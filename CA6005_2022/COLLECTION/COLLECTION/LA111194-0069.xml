   <HEADLINE> BUNDESTAG OPENS ON MODERATE NOTE ; GERMANY : SOCIALIST STEFAN HEYM , 81 , DELIVERS CONCILIATORY ADDRESS TO PARLIAMENT . SPEECH GETS APPLAUSE FROM SOME , SILENCE FROM KOHL AND HIS PARTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The former best-selling American novelist Stefan Heym opened Germany ' s 13th Bundestag on Thursday on an uncharacteristically conciliatory note , calling_on fellow members_of_Parliament to &quot; quarrel calmly &quot; about their &quot; widely divergent visions &quot; of Germany . &quot; I hope that we can concur on one thing : that chauvinism , racism , anti-Semitism and Stalinist methods should be forever banned from our country , &quot; said Heym , who at 81 is the oldest member of the lower house of the German Parliament , and thus empowered to conduct the opening session . His call_for moderation brought spontaneous applause from some leftist and centrist Parliament members , but stony silence from members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s conservative Christian Democratic Union . Heym , a German-born Jew who fled Hitler in 1933 and became a U.S. citizen , fled Sen . Joe McCarthy ' s anti-Communist witch hunts in the early 1950s and returned to live and write in East_Germany . He is a committed -- though unaffiliated -- socialist , and he ran_for the Bundestag on the ticket of the reconstituted East_German Communist_Party . Although the party has a new name -- the Party of Democratic Socialism -- and insists that it has broken_with the past , many Germans deeply distrust it and consider it improper that such an unrepentant leftist as Heym should have the opening-day honors in Germany ' s all-powerful Bundestag . On the eve of Heym ' s nationally televised speech , allegations were raised that he had gone so far as_to volunteer information to East_Germany ' s notorious secret_police , the Stasi , in 1958 . Heym , who was himself the subject of extensive Stasi spying and state harassment , has promised to address the allegations in a statement today . Until Thursday , there had been suggestions that mainstream members_of_Parliament might either heckle Heym when he opened the Bundestag or walk_out on his speech . Instead , they sat in a somber hush as the hunched , white-haired novelist recalled the events of the early 1930s , some of which he had witnessed personally : the election of Nazi leader Hermann Goering as president of the Reichstag , or legislature ; the election of Adolf Hitler as Germany ' s chancellor ; the dispatch of almost 200 members of the Reichstag to jails and concentration_camps , and the burning of the Reichstag building in central Berlin . Deputies from most of the other parties applauded Heym when he finished , but the Christian Democrats did not , and Kohl , a famously tough and unforgiving party leader , sat looking sharply around , making_sure no one in his ranks had made the mistake of clapping . Kohl , who since October ' s national elections has been negotiating the terms of the new government with the two parties that were his coalition partners in the last Bundestag , has come under sharp criticism in Germany lately for his perceived failure to bring any clear new vision to Germany ' s economic and political problems . Officially , 4.7 million Germans are unemployed or in state-subsidized unemployment-prevention programs , though social activists say the real figure is more like 6 million . Economists worry that even as the economy grows , new jobs are not being created fast enough . German business_leaders are crying_for an overhaul of their country ' s tax and regulatory structures . Taxed-to-death western Germans are bitter about the unexpectedly high cost of national unification , while easterners feel patronized by the west . Addressing such problems &quot; will be no less demanding a task than it was to bring a defeated Germany into the community of free nations in 1949 , &quot; says Walter Stuetzle , a senior editor of Tagesspiegel , a Berlin daily . And Kohl will be facing the problems from a seriously weakened position , once he is reelected chancellor , as expected , on Tuesday . The 134-seat majority his three-party coalition government enjoyed after the last general_election , in 1990 , was whittled to 10 seats in October ' s voting . One of Kohl ' s traditional coalition partners , the Free Democratic Party , was all but annihilated at the state level in a string of elections earlier this year . Newspapers here have been tallying up the number of potential dissidents within the Christian Democrats . But no matter how weak he may be , Kohl still managed to demonstrate Thursday that he is stronger than his political enemies . In a surprise move , his Christian Democrats voted to give a member of the left-of-center Greens a Bundestag vice presidency -- something the Greens have sought for more_than a decade -- stripping Kohl ' s top rivals , the Social Democrats , of the position .</TEXT>
