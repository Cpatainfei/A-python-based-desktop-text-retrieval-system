   <HEADLINE> U.S. MUST NOT RETREAT FROM A NON-NUCLEAR NORTH_KOREA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The most worrisome aspect of the crisis over North_Korea ' s nuclear-weapons program is that America ' s negotiating position has been weakened at each new turn of diplomacy . As a result , options have become starker , raising the choice of either acquiescence or a major crisis . The Clinton_Administration has failed to explain -- or perhaps to understand -- the nature of its problem . If , after much U.S. huffing and puffing , North_Korea emerges with a nuclear-weapons capability -- or a capability it can rapidly activate -- stability in Asia , the U.S. role in Asia and non-proliferation will all be gravely jeopardized . Specifically , U.S. troops in South_Korea , shorn of their tactical nuclear shield , will be in a precarious position ; South_Korea will be tempted to develop nuclear_weapons of its own ; Japan , within range of North_Korean missiles , will accelerate its nuclear-weapons and military programs ; China will speed_up its preparedness ; industrialized nations of Southeast_Asia -- and perhaps Taiwan -- will start their own nuclear programs ; rogue states will be encouraged to join the parade . The Administration ' s response has emphasized a bilateral diplomacy focused_on abstruse issues of inspection . To be sure , the diplomatic environment has not been congenial . China , Japan and South_Korea would seem to have more to lose from a nuclear North_Korea than the United States . But , in practice , they seem not to perceive their risks , though reports last week suggested that China may have played a role in persuading North_Korea to freeze its nuclear program . For its part , the Administration has oscillated among its options . In 1993 , the U.S. position was that North_Korea had to reverse its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty and accept the full inspection system of the International Atomic Agency , including suspect sites . Since then , the U.S. position has been watered_down to asking that North_Korea only suspend its withdrawal and only to discuss inspections of seven declared sites . The demand for inspections of two suspect sites has been dropped . The most significant retreat has been from the President ' s statement of &quot; North_Korea cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb &quot; to a policy that says the North need only stop developing its capability . In other words , North_Korea could keep the two nuclear bombs intelligence believes it may have built before 1992 and maintain its capacity to produce plutonium , which the IAEA estimates has doubled since 1992 . Acquiescing to what existed would make North_Korea a nuclear_power even if , in any one year , it stopped reprocessing its plutonium . These retreats may have given Pyongyang the idea that it could stall indefinitely . Despite a U.S. offer to cancel permanently its annual military exercises with Seoul if the North accepted IAEA inspections , in March , 1994 , Pyongyang refused any such inspections , and in May it began to remove enough plutonium from its reactor in Yongbyon that , if reprocessed , would yield five to seven nuclear_weapons . Finally , in June , 1994 , the Administration hesitantly decided to explore -- almost apologetically -- sanctions against North_Korea . Even this tentative and essentially meaningless measure was vitiated within days by the President ' s permission to former President Jimmy_Carter to visit North_Korea . Carter was known to be strongly opposed to sanctions ; he had said that the source of the crisis was not Pyongyang ' s conduct but a &quot; misunderstanding , &quot; easily removed by high-level contact . Permitting Carter to go was bound to embarrass countries that had agreed to sanctions . And it had to be construed in Pyongyang as an indication that the Administration was looking_for a way_out when confronted by Pyongyang ' s threat that sanctions spelled war . Not surprisingly , Kim il-Sung used the Carter visit to induce yet another U.S. retreat . The sanction effort was suspended . In return for &quot; good_faith &quot; negotiations -- and for so_long as these negotiations go_on -- Pyongyang has agreed not to reprocess the plutonium it had illegally removed from its reactor . And it agreed to discuss IAEA safeguards , though not for the two suspected sites . In return for stopping what should not have been done_in the first place , Pyongyang has asked_for U.S. recognition , a U.S. pledge not to use nuclear_weapons on the Korean_peninsula and for what amounts to an economic-aid program in the guise of resources for a light-water reactor . The much-touted Pyongyang concessions , however , are more compatible with an attempt to gain time than with a serious effort to solve the problem . Pyongyang ' s postponement of reprocessing the plutonium would be meaningful only if the forthcoming negotiations last more_than three months . For when plutonium emerges from nuclear_reactors , it is too radioactive to reprocess . A &quot; cooling_down &quot; period of several months is required . Thus , Pyongyang ' s overture may also be designed to prevent a U.S. air strike during the next three months , when the plutonium is not yet being processed and there is no danger of fallout . In the best of circumstances , the North will retain the essence of its nuclear program and the ability to sell nuclear technology , plutonium and ballistic_missiles . The beginning of wisdom is for U.S. policy-makers to recognize that no compromise is possible between a nuclear and a non-nuclear North_Korea . A freeze of the North ' s activities that leaves it in possible possession of weapons and a growing plutonium-producing capability would pose a mounting threat to vital U.S. interests in Asia , to Asian stability , and , in the longer_run , to the U.S. role in the region and to non-proliferation in_general . A rollback is needed . When the stakes are so high , unilateral action cannot be excluded . But no framework for it has been created . Unless the forthcoming talks with North_Korea make rapid progress toward ending the North_Korean weapons program , the United States should call a conference within the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty of nuclear states and Japan , because of its vital interests in Northeast Asia . The United States must stress its convictions and invite proposals , especially as the Non-Proliferation Treaty is coming_up for review in 1995 . Only after such a conference can it be determined whether the United States should proceed unilaterally . The U.S. message should be unambiguous . While the United States would welcome normal relations with Pyongyang and is prepared to help find alternative sources of energy for it , these measures cannot be extorted by a nuclear-weapons program . The precondition for improved relations must be_full compliance with IAEA inspections of all sites -- whether declared or suspected -- an accounting_for past production and a return to the Non-Proliferation Treaty . If North_Korea begins to refuel the reactor or reprocess the plutonium , talks with it should be broken_off and full sanctions against it sought . Before any military_action is implemented , another serious diplomatic effort is necessary . But it must have a definite time_limit ; it should remove , not entrench , the North_Korean weapons program . Meantime , the President should prepare himself , his Administration and the American people for the possibility that even the most dedicated diplomacy may_not succeed .</TEXT>
