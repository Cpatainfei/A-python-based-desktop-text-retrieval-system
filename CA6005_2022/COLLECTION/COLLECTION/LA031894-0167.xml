   <TEXT> A 71-year-old Simi Valley man has died of so-called valley_fever , a respiratory illness that may have been linked to the Northridge earthquake , health officials said Thursday . Eugene Walter Cole , a retired maintenance worker , received a diagnosis in February that he had the disease , which is contracted by breathing airborne spores that grow in the soil . He died March 2 in a North Hollywood hospital . Health officials have speculated that the Jan . 17 earthquake kicked_up fungus-laden dust that has infected many residents in the San Fernando Valley and eastern half of Ventura County , particularly in Simi Valley . The Centers_for_Disease_Control has documented 170 cases of valley_fever in Ventura County since the earthquake , more_than half of them in Simi Valley , said Gary Feldman , director of the Ventura County Department of Health . But Cole ' s death is the only reported fatality , health officials said . &quot; There was a lot of dust all_over Simi Valley , maybe this was why he was infected , &quot; said Rana Hajjeh , an epidemiologist with the Atlanta-based center . Hajjeh added that Cole had other health_problems that might have put him at risk . &quot; He was a diabetic , and diabetes sometimes can weaken your immune response. &quot; Cole ' s wife , Hazel , said her husband had a high fever and flu-like symptoms when he went_to the emergency_room Feb . 10 . He was sent home after being diagnosed as having pneumonia . Two days later , he returned to the hospital with a 103.6-degree fever and was admitted . &quot; When he left , he just said , ' See you tonight or in a_couple_of days. ' that ' s how sure he was that it wasn ' t serious , &quot; Hazel Cole said . However , he weakened quickly in the hospital and died March 2 . Feldman said the Health Department is investigating a possible link between the earthquake and the rise in valley_fever cases and plans to test 450 randomly selected Simi Valley residents to determine the magnitude of exposure in the area . Feldman said those who test positive for valley_fever would be interviewed &quot; to look_at factors they were exposed to. &quot; Although the number of valley_fever cases is above normal , health officials stress that death is uncommon . &quot; Even ( among ) those people who were_sick enough to come_to medical attention , very severe illness or fatality is quite rare , &quot; Feldman said . &quot; To the ordinary person , the risk is really quite low , so_much so that most people don ' t realize they have it. &quot; Patients with valley_fever report flu-like symptoms such_as headaches , coughs , fatigue and muscle aches , said Dr. Susan Reef of the Centers_for_Disease_Control . &quot; I think what is important to know is that 60 % ( of those infected ) have no symptoms , &quot; Reef said . &quot; Only . 5 % -- that ' s less than 1 % -- have the form that goes throughout the body. &quot; But health officials are taking_note anyway . The Centers_for_Disease_Control , which has set_up a valley_fever hot_line , released a report Thursday that addresses the outbreak of the disease in Ventura County . &quot; The increase in cases follows the Jan . 17 earthquake centered in Northridge , which may have exposed Ventura County residents to increased levels of airborne dust , &quot; the report states . &quot; The California Department of Health Services , local public agencies and the CDC are conducting an investigation to determine the magnitude of the outbreak , risk factors for infection and its possible association with the Northridge earthquake. &quot; The Ventura County Health Department ' s Simi Valley study could begin as early as Monday , Feldman said .
