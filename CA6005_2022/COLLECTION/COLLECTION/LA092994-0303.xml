   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : FULLERTON ; SEEING PEACE THROUGH A CHILD ' S EYES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To Chantel Miller , peace means &quot; being nice , helping , sharing , loving and caring for other people. &quot; The 11-year-old girl demonstrated what she meant with about 700 other students at Orangethorpe Elementary on Wednesday as part of the school ' s ninth annual commemoration of the United Nations ' International Day of Peace . Students spent the morning shaking hands , hugging , singing , cheering , reciting poetry and using sign_language to express their hopes for world peace . &quot; You should choose to be peaceful and stop all_the hate and crime . There should be peace throughout the world , &quot; 11-year-old Beau Gordon declared after a fourth-grade class sang &quot; We Are the World. &quot; &quot; We hope for peace because that way , we ' ll have a better life , &quot; said second-grader Chris Burgner , 8 . Added fourth-grader Matthew Mego , 10 : &quot; Peace is the greatest thing in the whole universe. &quot; Ann Rose , the school ' s special-education resource specialist and Peace Day coordinator , said the purpose of the event is to teach children to think_of ways to promote peace in school and life . &quot; We want them to learn that we can make a conscious choice to relate to other people in a peaceful manner and that it matters that each one of us make that decision , &quot; Rose said . &quot; If you ' re going to have peace in the world , you must start with the children. &quot; Teachers said the event also helps students learn to resolve conflicts in a positive manner . &quot; Peace has to start from within , and small people can make a big difference , and then it spreads , &quot; said Gretchen Francisco , a third-grade teacher . Fullerton School_Board President Robert C . Fisler watched the activities , which culminated with the release of a large helium balloon carrying messages of peace from the students . &quot; There ' s a great feeling of unity here , &quot; he said . &quot; This is an awfully nice feeling. &quot; MIMI KO</TEXT>
