   <HEADLINE> EVANGELICAL GROUP PUTS FOCUS_ON ENVIRONMENT ; ECOLOGY : NEW COALITION SPARKS SERIOUS DISPUTE . SOME CHURCH OFFICIALS SAY IT HAS EXAGGERATED EXTENT OF EARTH ' S POLLUTION AND THAT STRICTER REGULATIONS WOULD HURT ECONOMY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After years of focusing strictly on the needs of the human spirit , evangelicals are beginning to be concerned with the human habitat as well . But as they make their way through this new terrain , the path is marked by uncertainty , apprehension and sometimes discord . When evangelicals clash on the environment , the disagreement has more to do with differing views on science or the economy than on theological issues . Some evangelicals even question the reality of the so-called environmental crisis , citing a lack of conclusive scientific evidence . The controversy is painted against the backdrop of the newly formed Evangelical Environmental Network , a joint_venture of World Vision , a relief and humanitarian agency , and Evangelicals for Social_Action , a coalition of theologically conservative activists involved in a broad range of public policy issues . The group , which is based in suburban Philadelphia , released its first statement , &quot; An Evangelical Declaration on the Care of Creation , &quot; in March . These evangelical environmentalists have sparked some serious disputes . Robert Dugan , head of the Washington office of the National Assn . of Evangelicals , refused to sign the declaration and resigned from its advisory council last week . &quot; I have a concern that this issue is going_to balloon into something of greater importance to the churches than it needs to be , &quot; Dugan said . &quot; I appreciate their calling attention to the problem , but it must be kept_in perspective. &quot; Dugan is not the only one who believes the Evangelical Environmental Network exaggerated the environmental crisis and neglected the negative impact on the economy that stricter environmental laws will create . &quot; Extremist views like these promote destructive policies that will reduce the consumption of energy , &quot; said E . Calvin Beisner , an expert in public policy and environmental issues at Covenant College in Lookout Mountain , Ga . He has advised fellow evangelicals to stay clear of the group . &quot; There ' s a growing anti-environment backlash &quot; in the evangelical community , warned Richard Wright , an environmental scientist at Gordon College in Wenham , Mass. , and the academic dean of the Au Sable Institute . The critics fear that &quot; if people begin taking environmental issues seriously , it will lead to costly governmental regulations for small business and industry which will stifle our economy , &quot; Wright said . But caring for the Earth does take priority over economic considerations because &quot; environmental problems affect human_beings &quot; and human_beings are the most important part of creation , insisted Cliff Benzel , the group ' s director . &quot; The Earth has intrinsic value because God created it , &quot; he said . &quot; It is not our job to stamp it out. &quot; Jerry Wenger , a biology professor at Covenant College , also was invited to sign the environmental statement but declined because of its strong wording . &quot; Many statements were put_in such extreme terms , I felt they should be a little more moderate , &quot; he said . &quot; If the average person reads EEN ' s information , they get the idea that everything is so bad , &quot; Wenger said . Conclusions about the state of the environment are usually based more on personal ideas than on scientific evidence , he said .</TEXT>
