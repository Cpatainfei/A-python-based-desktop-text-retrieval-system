   <HEADLINE> SHOWDOWN AT_HAND OVER INDIAN VIDEO_GAMING BOOM ; GAMBLING : OFFICIALS TARGET MAJOR EQUIPMENT SUPPLIER AND OUTSIDE CASINO MANAGER . TRIBES INSIST DEVICES ARE LEGAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When video gambling machines started popping_up in California ' s Indian gambling halls in 1991 , San Diego County sheriff ' s officials thought they could halt use of the &quot; electronic slots &quot; by raiding three reservations and seizing 288 of the devices . It was a bad bet . Three years later , while authorities continue to insist that the machines are illegal in California , at least 16 of the state ' s tribes have them . And nowhere has California ' s emergence into the age of casino gambling been more evident than in San Diego County . Today , competing television ads openly tout the Las Vegas-style gambling on the same reservations raided in 1991 , except that these days they feature more_than 2 # 300 of the high-tech moneymakers -- as_many as the famed Mirage hotel . The machine gambling has become so widespread -- and profitable -- that wagering at tribal casinos is expected to pass the $ 1-billion-dollar mark in the state this year . But after three years of unbridled growth and official inaction amid a tangle of legal cases , a showdown finally appears to be at_hand over the slot-type gambling -- mostly pitting authorities against the tribes and their non-Indian casino managers , but also pitting factions of law_enforcement against each other . * In March , police in Los Angeles and Ventura counties seized records and computer boards from the offices of a Chatsworth business that supplies gambling machines to several tribal casinos , including the Barona Big Top here , a circus-themed addition to a bingo hall long_run by the Capitan Band of Mission Indians . This one reservation now has more_than a_thousand of the flashing , beeping machines that offer electronic versions of poker , keno and the old classic slot game , in which players try to win &quot; progressive &quot; jackpots by matching three spinning symbols -- diamonds , gold bars and the_like . * In May , a federal grand_jury in Los Angeles indicted the outside managers of another casino , on the Morongo Reservation , on racketeering charges that carry up_to 20 years in prison . The charges spotlighted the astounding economics of the machines : Federal prosecutors said the 140 installed at Morongo , a fraction of the number at some_other reservations , generated $ 10 million in the last year -- and that principals in the management firm , E . C . Investments Inc. , may have skimmed millions of the take from the Palm Springs-area tribe . * The head of the National Indian Gaming Commission , created by Congress to oversee tribal gambling , promptly said that more indictments could follow , especially of &quot; non-Indians who are , in fact , ripping_off the tribes. &quot; Then on June 16 , top representatives of the four U.S. attorney ' s offices in California met in San Francisco to coordinate a campaign against the machines , which had become &quot; of great concern to us , &quot; said Michael J . Yamaguchi , the U.S. attorney for Northern California . Just two weeks after the unprecedented meeting , however , the U.S. attorney in San Diego , Alan D . Bersin , announced his own agreement with the three tribes that have led the move_into the machine age -- an agreement far more conciliatory than the hard-line approach supported by his colleagues . Under the June 30 pact , sealed by handshakes during a tour of the reservations , tribal leaders promised to temporarily halt expansion of their casinos . Bersin , in turn , pledged to take no action against the controversial devices pending the outcome of the tribes ' three-year court battle to force the state to accept the video gambling , now before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals . Bersin said Monday that even the Wilson Administration , which has steadfastly opposed the machines , should welcome the deal because the tribes agreed that if they lose in court &quot; there would be a withdrawal &quot; of the devices . &quot; The point is we ' re talking_about very extensive operations , &quot; he said . &quot; To the same extent one would not shut_down the business of a defense_contractor pending final adjudication , nor should we in this context. &quot; But while the local pact was applauded by tribal leaders , it enraged other law_enforcement officials around the state , along with Anthony J . Hope , the Washington-based chairman of the National Indian Gaming Commission , the top regulator in the field . He accused Bersin of naively &quot; endorsing . . . illegal gambling &quot; for years to come_by taking a hands-off stance while drawn-out appeals of tribal lawsuits are argued to the U.S. Supreme Court . &quot; He can ' t do that ! &quot; Hope declared . Hope said Monday he may soon seek $ 250-a-day fines , per machine , against tribes using the devices without state approval -- meaning daily sanctions of more_than $ 250 # 000 for some . Yet despite such threats , almost monthly a new tribe gets_into the electronic slot business , seeking a share of the take from the gambling devices that generally earn from $ 100 to $ 400 a day . At that rate , they pay_for themselves in weeks and then each brings_in profits of $ 100 # 000 or more a year . Over Memorial_Day weekend , the Santa Ynez Band of Mission Indians unveiled 210 machines on its reservation in Santa Barbara County in time for the prime tourist season in adjoining Solvang . In a Northern California resort , a band of Pomo Indians is putting finishing touches_on an 18 # 000-square-foot casino alongside sparkling Clear Lake -- the third casino in remote Lake County alone , where the crowds that fish for bass each morning create the alluring promise of a new Lake Tahoe . &quot; For Indians , these machines bring_in more revenue than anything else , &quot; said Dan Tucker , chairman of the Sycuan Reservation outside El Cajon , which has the glitziest of the San Diego County gambling halls . But after recent events , Tucker acknowledged , &quot; We ' re at the edge of a situation that could go either way. &quot; * Although the current showplace of Indian gambling is 3 # 000 miles away , the industry ' s explosive growth had its roots in California . A legal fight between the Cabazon band and Riverside County a decade ago produced a U.S. Supreme Court decision -- and a federal law -- declaring that tribes could offer high-stakes versions of any gambling legal in their state . The first results were cavernous bingo halls that drew thousands of customers by offering $ 50 # 000 jackpots while competitors -- charity games -- were limited to $ 250 prizes . In California , nearly 100 reservations and small rancherias also were free to offer poker and off-track betting , other forms of gambling indisputably legal here . From the start , however , gambling promoters pushed tribes to offer more extensive wagering . After all , Las Vegas was not built_on bingo but on faster-paced money-makers such_as blackjack , craps . . . and slots . Where that term used to mean the &quot; one-armed_bandits &quot; with levers on the side and rotating reels , a new generation of machines allows players to simply touch a screen to set the lemons and other symbols spinning . Or gamblers can wager as little as 25 cents at poker machines that offer a 500-1 payoff for the top hand , a royal_flush . Guided by computer_programs to dole_out just enough winners to keep customers glued to their seats , such machines account_for 68 % of the gross in Atlantic_City casinos and a remarkable 82 % in Laughlin , Nev. , the blue-collar gambling town on the Colorado_River . &quot; Slot_machines are easier for new gamblers to adapt to , &quot; said William R . Eadington , director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada at Reno . Lower labor cost &quot; also is a very important part . . . . &quot; &quot; The point is that if you have the option to introduce slot_machines , you ' re certainly going_to do so. &quot; But in many states , such_as California , laws explicitly ban casino gambling . As a result , a legal cat-and-mouse game began in 1991 at the onset of negotiations of compacts between tribes and the state called_for under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act . Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren said he would never agree to the use of the machines . Some tribes began using them anyway . That October , a San Diego County sheriff ' s task_force raided the Sycuan , Barona and Viejas reservations and seized the 288 machines . Similar raids were staged in Lake and Fresno counties . A torrent of litigation followed : U.S. District Judge Marilyn Huff refused to return the machines to the San Diego reservations , but said the raids were improper because only federal authorities had criminal jurisdiction over tribal gambling . Federal prosecutors , however , were not ready to join the crackdown -- they wanted guidance from the fledgling National Indian Gaming Commission . By the time the Washington-based commission came_out against the use of machines without state approval , California ' s tribes were back in court to force Sacramento ' s hand . They argued that technology used in the California Lottery ' s own keno game had &quot; opened the door &quot; for tribal use of electronic slots . In a ruling that emboldened the tribes , a federal judge in Sacramento agreed and ordered the state to negotiate in good_faith with them . The state quickly appealed . Although the legal fight is far from resolved -- the 9th Circuit appellate judges are expected to issue their opinion any day now -- many of the state ' s tribes felt vindicated . In came more machines . By the hundreds . In a_few years , they had become impossible to resist , largely because of a role_model across the country , in Connecticut . There , after a court fight and hard lobbying , the Mashantucket Pequot tribe won the full range of games for its Foxwoods Casino , in exchange for sharing 25 % of the slot revenue with the state . Today , 3 # 051 gambling machines anchor a casino-hotel-entertainment complex . Drawing 140 # 000 customers a week , Foxwoods earns more_than $ 1 million a day from its slots , accounting_for most of the $ 650-million profit that will make_it the most successful casino in the world this year . Although the totals are far lower in California , tribal officials at Cabazon and Viejas say machines account_for 75 % of their revenue . Cabazon reports that $ 63 million was wagered last year at its casino in Indio . Officials will not disclose the net_profit , but it was enough to fund a child_care center , a museum , free housing and $ 60 # 000 payments to each of the 30 tribe members . At the Viejas Casino &amp; Turf Club in Alpine , 30 miles east of San Diego , the 1 # 000 machines generate about $ 100 each per day , a public relations agent said -- meaning they should bring_in $ 36 million in the next year . Then there ' s Sycuan , once a rocky square_mile of wasteland outside El Cajon . Its casino handled $ 120 million in wagers last year , earning $ 11 million for the tribe , according to chairman Tucker . With 230 machines , Sycuan is outnumbered by its San Diego County rivals , but heavy traffic means each machine earns $ 300 a day . &quot; Every other business gets_to use computers and new technology , &quot; Tucker said , &quot; but Indian tribes haven ' t been allowed the opportunity to move_into the 20th-Century electronic age. &quot; The debate often gets mired in semantics . Tribal officials painstakingly avoid using the term slot , pointing_out that the machines used here don ' t pay_out coins , for instance , but credits . Some machines -- video pull-tabs -- are downplayed as mere electronic &quot; dispensers &quot; of the lottery ticket-like cards sold at bingo halls . John James , the Cabazon chairman , complained that the way state and federal_officials look_at it , &quot; even a Coke machine is a slot_machine . . . . You put money in , you get something back. &quot; But Hope , the federal regulator , has grown tired_of what he sees as a word_game -- and many tribes ' flouting of the law . &quot; I was in Barona two months ago . I saw a lot of machines . All illegal , &quot; the commission chairman said . Hope applauded the May 11 Morongo indictment as &quot; heroic work &quot; by federal prosecutors in Los Angeles at a time when some of their counterparts elsewhere are reluctant to scrutinize tribal gambling for fear they will be accused of picking on a historically abused group . The Los Angeles team handled the sensitive prosecution by avoiding targeting the Native_Americans themselves -- through a raid , for instance -- and instead focusing_on the outside suppliers and gambling promoters who may be earning just as much , or more , from the disputed gambling . Among the allegations in this case is that the outsiders cheated the tribe in the process . Federal prosecutors said the management firm first persuaded the Morongo tribal council to lease , rather than buy , 140 video keno , poker and &quot; pot-o-gold &quot; machines . That is an arrangement sometimes preferred by tribes because they would not absorb the loss if the machines were seized . But a study by the Interior_Department ' s inspector_general in Michigan and Wisconsin suggested that such arrangements are virtual giveaways by the tribes . It found 13 leasing contracts for video gambling machines that could have been purchased for $ 3.2 million -- and instead were being rented for $ 40.3 million . In Morongo ' s case , this provided a way for the casino operators to increase their take above the 30 % of the profit called_for in a 1992 management contract , according to the indictment charging E . C . Investments Inc. and four individuals with illegal gambling , racketeering and money_laundering . Without telling the tribe of their personal interest , the defendants allegedly set_up a company with a post_office box and a bank_account in Washington , D.C. , to buy machines for about $ 5 # 000 each and lease them to the casino -- for another 25 % to 30 % of the net . With the machines taking_in more_than $ 10 million , the group received $ 3.3 million in lease payments between April 27 , 1993 , and May 1 , 1994 , according to the indictment . Assistant U.S. Atty . Jonathan Shapiro said the tribe cooperated fully and that the charges were part of &quot; an extensive and ongoing investigation , &quot; suggesting that there may be more to come . Already under review are records seized in March from San Fernando Valley and Ventura County locations that enabled a Chatsworth firm , SSK Game Enterprises , to supply video slots to Barona and several other tribal casinos . Hit were wood shops that made the cabinets , offices turning_out computer boards and trucking firms that carted the equipment . The operation &quot; was having slot cabinets shipped without the computer boards installed until they arrived on Indian land to avoid violating California Penal Code statutes , &quot; according to a search_warrant affidavit filed by Los Angeles Police Detective William D . Westermann , a veteran gambling investigator . Attorneys for SSK predicted that authorities would find no wrongdoing . Whereas the Morongo indictment &quot; cries_out_for relief . . . if you believe that these people lied to the Indians and , in_effect , defrauded them , &quot; the Valley firm had no management relationship with the tribes , said attorney Jon Artz . Tribal leaders also called the Morongo case an anomaly . &quot; Give Morongo a little credit . . . . The bottom_line is that the reservation caught these people , &quot; said David Dominguez , chairman of the Santa Ynez tribe , which had hired Morongo ' s management firm to open its casino Memorial_Day weekend , but &quot; terminated the contract &quot; after the indictment . &quot; We ' re going to be the operators , &quot; Dominguez said , adding that the indictment did not deter the tribe from leasing -- with an option to buy -- 210 gambling machines . &quot; We ' re going to generate some income for this whole Valley. &quot; That is one point not in_dispute -- the machines bring_in the cash . * To be sure , the setting of the Barona Big Top , which opened in January , will never be confused with the Vegas Strip . It is situated above San Diego ' s eastern suburbs , off a winding , two-lane road that crosses open cattle country . But when you pull_up , a valet parks your car . Inside , attendants push change carts over black-and-fuschia carpeting . Other casino workers offer free beverages to gamblers . There are uniformed security_guards and cameras everywhere , an ATM machine so players can replenish their funds , a cash cage , a buffet line offering reasonably good , cheap food . And everywhere , gamblers are perched on stools , feeding machines $ 5 and $ 20 bills , pushing_buttons and watching the screens flash with a crazy assortment of symbols . One of the hypnotic trappings of Las Vegas is missing -- the sound of coins clanking into steel buckets . Instead , large payoffs are signaled by the click-click-click of credits registering on the payoff window of each machine , which spits_out a small_white ticket . A floor attendant then cashes the ticket . The extra step hardly seemed to bother a housewife planted at a video poker machine on a recent afternoon . She had arrived with $ 100 and , 6 1 / 2 hours later , was holding $ 300 in fives . &quot; I just sit here and lose myself , &quot; she said as she played another round of poker . The sound resembled a machine_gun as the cards came_up on the screen , rat-a-tat-tatt . She got four of a kind and won another $ 50 . The video slots are a big winner for her and the tribe -- at least for the time_being . Electronic Gambling At least 16 California Indian_reservations or rancherias feature electronic gambling machines . 03 # 26 , 16 # 20 Reservation or Rancheria County Number of Machines 1 .
