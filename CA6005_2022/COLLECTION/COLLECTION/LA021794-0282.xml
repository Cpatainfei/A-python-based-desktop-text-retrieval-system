   <TEXT> The woman blended effortlessly with the hundreds of travelers negotiating the maze of security checkpoints , tax_collectors , passport stampers and bribe-takers at Murtala Muhammed Airport . She was a slender , 25-year-old Nigerian with braided hair , dressed in light cotton trousers and a T-shirt . She held a ticket for the late-night flight to Amsterdam . It was her container of palm_oil , a staple of Nigerian cooking , that raised the security officer ' s suspicions . &quot; You ' re taking this to Europe ? &quot; the officer asked . &quot; It ' s for my boyfriend , &quot; she replied . &quot; He ' s never had a meal cooked in palm oil. &quot; Skeptical Nigerian agents heated the gallon-sized jug of solidified oil and , lo and behold , a plastic bag of heroin bobbed to the surface . But for every smuggler the Nigerians catch , there are hundreds , probably thousands , who walk unchallenged through the gaping airport security net . Foreign drug agents based here estimate that every plane , every night , holds at least one passenger smuggling heroin or cocaine . In fact , lax security at the airport and a culture of corruption have made this city of 8 million people one of the busiest drug transit points in the world , international experts say . Heroin arrives here in bulk from the Far East , often via Lebanon or Pakistan ; cocaine arrives from South_America . Then nearly all_of it is exported , pound by pound , on the backs , in the luggage and , increasingly , in the bellies of Nigerian couriers . &quot; Nigeria is a major , major heroin trafficking and transit point , &quot; said Roger Guevara , a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington . &quot; I hate to say anything derogatory about Nigerians , but let ' s just say they ' re very good at what they do. &quot; In recent years , almost 80 % of the heroin seized at John F . Kennedy International Airport in New York has , at one point or another , passed_through Lagos , DEA and U.S. Customs officials report . Half of the heroin seized in the United States is being carried by Nigerians or other West_Africans . Just a_few weeks ago , agents busted a Nigerian drug smuggling ring based in San Francisco . &quot; Nigeria is a safe haven for individuals , drug barons and drug dealers , &quot; said a Western drug expert with three years ' experience in Nigeria . &quot; The reason ? C-o-r-r-u-p-t-i-o-n. &quot; Like other foreign drug agents here , he spoke on condition of anonymity . In the last year , one American drug agent and one Italian agent have been shot in ambushes . No arrests have been made . The battle by American and European authorities to close the Lagos loophole in the world drug network has been uphill . The American government , citing poor security , banned all direct flights between Lagos and the United States last August . In response , the Nigerians installed their first airport X-ray_machine . But American officials say security remains poor . A review of the flight ban is expected in March . If the airport isn ' t recertified , the United States is legally bound to suspend all non-humanitarian aid to Nigeria . Shutting_down direct flights to the United States has only changed the path of the drug highway . Now , American experts say , more Nigerians are smuggling drugs into the United States through European airports , overland from Canada and Mexico , and on flights from the Caribbean . The Nigerian government ' s anti-drug efforts are coordinated by the 4-year-old National Drug Law_Enforcement Agency , housed in a collection of dilapidated , unmarked buildings in a thicket of palm_trees on Lagos ' Victoria Island . Of its 2 # 000 agents , 200 are assigned to the 24-hour airport detail . Nigeria ' s drug agency is sharply criticized by foreign diplomats as incompetent and corrupt . The agency is especially plagued by cases of confiscated drugs that mysteriously disappear . Four agents were sent to jail last year for tampering with evidence . Nigerian authorities made 279 drug arrests last year and confiscated 135 pounds of cocaine and 80 pounds of heroin . But much more got_through . Authorities at London ' s Heathrow Airport arrested nearly one Nigerian a day last year . And those are just the couriers . Nigerian agents have been unable or unwilling to arrest any major drug barons , many of whom receive friendly escorts through airport checkpoints and flash their enormous wealth on the streets of Lagos . &quot; The Nigerian authorities are doing exactly nothing , except collecting money from the drug barons , &quot; a U.S. drug agent complained . &quot; It ' s a disgrace. &quot; At one border post two months ago , authorities had to fire tear_gas to break_up a dispute between Nigerian customs agents and drug enforcement agents . The fight , it turned_out , was over who could extort money from importers . Then , last month , a 560-pound shipment of heroin from Thailand was seized by Nigerian agents , acting_on a tip from British intelligence . Within days , some of the heroin was reported missing . &quot; We do not condone this at all , &quot; said Abiodun Adesola , chief spokesman for Nigeria ' s drug agency . As he talked , loud rock_music pulsed from a stereo_system at his elbow . The sign_on his desk read : &quot; A life of drug_addiction is a dead life. &quot; It is not drug_addiction , of course , but transportation , that is Nigeria ' s biggest problem . Although drug use in Nigeria is_on the increase , few can afford such an addiction in a country of nearly 100 million beset by crippling poverty . But the transport business is booming . In recent months , Nigerian drug barons have forged into new markets in the rest of Africa , especially in South_Africa . The DEA has three field agents in Lagos , the agency ' s only office in sub-Saharan Africa . But agency offers of assistance to the Nigerian government have , for the most part , been spurned . When the Americans gave two drug-sniffing dogs to local agents , for example , the animals were never used and eventually died . Nigerians blamed the heat . Nigerian officials acknowledge that their efforts to stop trafficking have been insufficient . They blame the country ' s political travails , which have seen three unelected dictators in power over the last year . And they also blame the American appetite for drugs . &quot; Nigeria is not a generator of this drug_traffic , &quot; said Jerry Gana , the government ' s minister of information . &quot; We are not a nation of crooks. &quot; But he acknowledged that Lagos has become one of the world ' s leading drug conduits &quot; because our laws were not applied firmly in the past. &quot; Adesola , of the Nigerian drug agency , contended that , although Nigeria has a duty to stop the drug_traffic in Lagos , &quot; the U.S. also has a duty to teach people not to use them . This is a problem forced on us by poverty and the ready market in the United States and all these developed countries . &quot; Our people are desperate to make ends meet , and they become tools , &quot; Adesola added . &quot; If you ( in the United States ) don ' t tackle the demand , it ' s difficult for us. &quot; While Nigerian drug barons are hardly innocent victims of the world ' s narcotics habits , American officers admit that the promise of a $ 1 # 000 cash payment can easily turn an impoverished Nigerian into a contraband courier . &quot; In Nigeria , you ' ve got 100 million people ready to take that chance , &quot; said a Western diplomat in Lagos . &quot; And even if they get nailed in London , they still get a nice jail_cell and good meals . There ' s an economic incentive right there. &quot; The lax security network and corruption are only two reasons for the growing number of Nigerian drug barons . U.S. drug agents admit that Nigerians are among the world ' s most sophisticated smugglers -- and the most difficult to stop . &quot; If Nigerians ever put their intelligence and energy into legal things , they would control the world , &quot; said another Western diplomat in Lagos . Couriers are promised that , if they are caught , their families will be taken_care of until they are freed . And they sign a vow of secrecy , which they respect , knowing that drug lords could harm their families . Couriers undergo rigorous training by the Lagos syndicates . In the drug barons ' fancy homes , couriers are taught how to avoid being caught , how to answer authorities ' questions and how to act if confronted . They are supplied with high-quality forged passports , which can be obtained in a_few days in Lagos . Swallowing heroin-filled condoms is the most common method of drug smuggling here , and couriers often perfect their technique by swallowing grapes . Couriers also often use okra soup , a favorite Nigerian dish , to help wash_down their stash . In fact , an effort to target the &quot; swallowers &quot; in 1992 was code-named &quot; Operation Soup Bowl. &quot; Foreign drug agents encourage flight_attendants on planes leaving Lagos to report any passengers who refuse to eat or drink . But they are often outwitted by drug lords who flood flights with couriers . Agents call this &quot; the army of ants tactic. &quot; And American agents say Nigerians are now recruiting more women , especially white_women , to be couriers . &quot; They don ' t just take the average Joe and say , ' Take this to America , ' &quot; a U.S. agent said . &quot; They are very sophisticated . They ' ve had on-the-job training , and they know how to beat us. &quot; The Nigerian Connection While there is no direct service between Lagos , Nigeria , and the United States , there are plenty of flights to European and African cities that have numerous daily flights to the United States .
