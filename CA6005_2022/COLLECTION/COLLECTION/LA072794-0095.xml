   <TEXT> Can you have a real business accounting program without those two dreaded words , debit and credit ? You won ' t find either one in the index to the users manual for One-Write Plus 4.0 , a $ 70 program aimed at very small businesses . All the debits and credits of a proper double-entry accounting_system are built into the program -- even if you don ' t have to know one from the other to use it . The program , which is published by NEBS Software Inc. of Nashua , N.H. , runs under the DOS operating system on IBM-compatible personal_computers . According to Chuck McGonagle , senior product manager , One-Write Plus provides a more rigorous audit trail than Intuit ' s Quick Books , a market leader in small-business accounting software . In addition , he says , it is easier for people with little or no knowledge of accounting procedures to get started with this program than with those from Peachtree and DacEasy that can handle larger businesses . In its fourth major revision since it was introduced in 1985 , One-Write Plus has all_the basic accounting functions needed by a small business , including accounts_payable , accounts receivable , invoicing , payroll and general_ledger . It produces more_than 40 reports and prints checks , invoices , statements , W-2s and 1099s . Although it can theoretically handle a business with up_to 500 employees and a general_ledger balance up_to $ 999 million , more_than 90 % of its users have sales of less than $ 1 million a year , according to McGonagle . The real audience for this program is small businesses that currently use manual bookkeeping systems . One popular manual system , known as the peg board or one-write system , provided the program its name and one of its most distinctive_features . In a peg board system , a bookkeeper is able to simultaneously write checks and make check register entries by using special checks with carbon strips on the back and a peg board to position each check accurately on the register . In One-Write Plus , the check register is displayed on the same screen as the check-writing form , and you can always see your account balance when you write a check . Of course , the advantage of computerized accounting is that all information is entered only once and then automatically distributed everywhere it needs to appear . * That distribution is governed by the chart of accounts . Setting_up a chart of accounts is the critical first_step to any accounting_system and one that usually requires a good understanding of accounting practices to accomplish . One-Write Plus comes_with pre-defined charts of accounts_for 14 types of businesses and organizations . You can get started merely by choosing the set appropriate for your operations . A neighbor of mine who has used the previous version of One-Write Plus to keep books for a small floor-covering company gives it high marks . She finds it easy to void erroneous entries , and she praised its payroll functions and bank_account reconciliation feature . It is also easy to generate a sales report for each salesperson , which the company finds handy in deciding who should call slow-paying customers to ask_for their check . Version 4.0 is a major advance over previous versions . You can now use a mouse to navigate the menus and functions and you can run it from Windows . But it is still a DOS program . And that can cause difficulties for a business that has adopted Windows applications for the rest of its computing needs , such_as word-processing , spreadsheet and database functions . * A Windows version of the program is now being written , but &quot; it ' s taking a lot longer than we ' d like , &quot; McGonagle said . The company is grappling with problems such_as retaining the ability to do everything from the keyboard rather than having to use the mouse . Version 4.0 features a new menu screen , navigated easily by mouse or keyboard , that takes you into the various forms and functions of the program . Once you leave the main menu , the program takes_on a different look . The menu structure disappears and is replaced with function buttons , generally at the top of the screen , which provide quick access to functions such_as &quot; save &quot; and &quot; help. &quot; They can be invoked either with the mouse or keystrokes . I think it ' s unfortunate that the button placement is often opposite where you would find the same function in a Windows program , but McGonagle said the placement generally matches the previous version of One-Write Plus . In addition to its accounting functions , One-Write Plus has a feature called SuperTrack that lets you define three kinds of &quot; card &quot; files for organizing information , such_as inventory , job costing and client-escrow funds . The cards work in conjunction with the regular program functions , so you can easily transfer information to them at_the_same_time you write a check or record an invoice or receipt . Check forms , invoices , receipts and all_the other forms that need to be printed are available from various sources for all_of the popular accounting programs . But One-Write Plus users can order their forms directly from the parent company of the program ' s publisher , New England Business Service Inc. , a major supplier of business and computer forms .
