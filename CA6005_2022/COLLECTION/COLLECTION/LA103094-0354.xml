   <HEADLINE> BOOK THAT LINKS LOW IQ TO RACE , POVERTY FUELS DEBATE ; RACE : AUTHORS SAY GENETICS ALONG WITH ENVIRONMENT ACCOUNT FOR INTELLIGENCE-TEST GAP BETWEEN WHITES , BLACKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For more_than a decade , conservative social theorist Charles Murray has made a living pushing the boundaries of politically acceptable debate about the welfare_state . But nothing the contrarian thinker has written in the past drew the level of vitriol now engulfing &quot; The Bell Curve , &quot; his new best-selling book linking IQ to race and poverty . Murray has spent the better part of the past two weeks fending off accusations that he and his late co-author , Richard J . Herrnstein , are reactionary racists . Yet only days ago , as he zipped along a Virginia highway toward his next talk_show , Murray insisted that his book actually boosts the liberal cause . &quot; Here ' s the great untold story of ' The Bell Curve , ' &quot; Murray said . &quot; Dick Herrnstein and I have uncovered more data to help the left than any other social_scientists , data which may be used to argue for massive redistribution of income. &quot; That Murray now applies this Alice-in-Wonderland spin to his thesis -- which argues that most low-IQ people are doomed to a life of poverty and possibly crime -- is a measure of how the national debate over helping the poor promises to become curiouser and curiouser in the coming months . Most of the hand-wringing punditry surrounding &quot; The Bell Curve &quot; has focused_on the so-called Chapter 13 problem -- an analysis by Murray and Herrnstein , who was a psychology professor at Harvard_University , that genetics as well as environmental factors account_for the 15-point gap between whites and blacks on IQ_tests . But the main thesis of this 845-page book -- that IQ is largely destiny -- is equally incendiary in a nation founded on egalitarianism , and it could further polarize Washington ' s already strained political dialogue over how to better the plight of the nation ' s poor . &quot; In the short run , it will make the debate more ugly , &quot; said Robert Rector , who has helped fashion Republican welfare legislation from his post as senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think_tank . Conservatives , likely to be emboldened after Election_Day with strong GOP gains in Congress , can use the book ' s findings to make the case that government attempts to train the underclass to perform in the new global economy are doomed to failure . And if liberals want fodder for the argument that broad-based welfare reform designed to curb out-of-wedlock births smacks of eugenics , they can flip to page 548 . There , Herrnstein and Murray claim that current U.S. welfare policies encourage the &quot; wrong women &quot; to have babies . With 93 charts and graphs , and a 110-page appendix designed as a statistics primer , Murray and Herrnstein pummel the quintessentially American notion that all men and women are created equal , that any citizen can buy a piece of the dream through hard work and a healthy dose of street smarts . &quot; The ideology of equality has done some good , &quot; they write , &quot; but most of its effects are bad. &quot; IQ_tests , the authors contend , are the best predictors of a person ' s success in life . America ' s poor , its criminals , its school dropouts and unwed mothers typically have low cognitive abilities , Murray and Herrnstein write . They fret that the nation ' s intellectual health is dropping because low-IQ people are having more babies than the &quot; cognitive elite , &quot; and because today ' s immigrants have lower IQs than past waves of newcomers . Furthermore , in an increasingly technology-driven society , they write , low-intelligence citizens &quot; are becoming not just increasingly expendable in economic terms ; they will . . . become a net drag. &quot; The refusal of U.S. policy-makers to come_to grips with these truths , say Murray and Herrnstein , accounts_for the spotty success of job training or educational_programs such_as Head_Start . &quot; Taken together , &quot; they write , &quot; the story of attempts to raise intelligence is one of high hopes , flamboyant claims , and disappointing results. &quot; Murray and Herrnstein set_forth what could be described as the ultimate root-cause argument for troubles of the nation ' s underclass : Poor people can ' t make_it because they ' re stupid . And those who work in poverty programs worry that the book will feed a do-nothing attitude on the part of a public already cynical about government intervention . &quot; The risk is that we lose sight of the potential of people to change , &quot; said Judith M . Gueron , president of New York ' s Manpower Demonstration Research Corp. , which designs and tests education and job-training programs for the disadvantaged . &quot; People move_in and out of poverty . They move_in and out of employment . We ' re in the midst of a very mean-spirited debate about welfare and poverty , and this argument risks fueling that. &quot; &quot; It ' s an incendiary book , &quot; said University of Pennsylvania sociologist Elijah Anderson , author of the 1990 inner-city study &quot; Streetwise. &quot; &quot; It gives aid and comfort to people who are privileged and encourages them to do nothing . It lets them off_the_hook . that ' s very dangerous. &quot; Anderson adds that Murray fails to examine the flight of jobs from the inner_city as a major component of the poor ' s troubles . But at the other end of the political spectrum , &quot; The Bell Curve &quot; -- with 200 # 000 copies in print and more to come -- is political poison_oak for conservatives who signed onto Murray ' s last incendiary cause : attacking high rates of out-of-wedlock births by cutting_off welfare payments to single mothers . &quot; There ' s no question that the proposals Murray makes on welfare are undercut by ' The Bell Curve , ' &quot; said Peter Wehner , policy director of Empower America , the William J . Bennett-Jack Kemp think_tank that has backed welfare reform aimed at curbing out-of-wedlock births . &quot; It ' s an inviting target for critics of his welfare proposals . But the welfare debate needs to be taken_on its own merits. &quot; While Murray and Herrnstein carefully distance themselves from the eugenics movement that earlier this century rationalized forced sterilizations and the Nazi Holocaust , the authors claim that America is suffering under &quot; dysgenic pressure &quot; -- the collective lowering of its intellectual potential because of immigration and higher fertility_rates among the low-IQ poor . With that assertion hanging_in the air , politicians who openly fret about out-of-wedlock births among the poor -- a concern that for the better part of a decade has underpinned Murray ' s own proposals to end federal welfare -- are treading into risky political territory . &quot; They have a very difficult mess in their back yard , &quot; a key congressional source said of lawmakers backing proposals to cut_off welfare to unwed mothers . Despite Murray ' s protestations to the contrary , this source adds , the policy of ending government payments to poor single women who have children &quot; is consistent with a eugenics program. &quot; The Heritage Foundation ' s Rector agrees that &quot; people will try to derail some policies by saying it ' s eugenics . But I don ' t think_over the long term it will bear fruit. &quot; Rector adds that &quot; The Bell Curve ' s &quot; findings only demonstrate that &quot; conventional marriage and family is all_the more important &quot; for low-IQ men and women in poverty , yet current welfare policies have undermined the family . Reducing births to unwed mothers is at the heart of the Republican approach to reform welfare in its much-touted &quot; contract with America. &quot; The legislation it promotes would prohibit cash payments but permit direct services to single mothers younger than 18 , and would enable states to extend that rule to the age of 20 . Welfare reform is expected to be a top priority for the Clinton_Administration next year . And while Murray ' s book makes conservative opponents inviting targets for name-calling , private comments by Administration officials suggest that they aren ' t eager to gain political capital by equating the removal of children born_out of wedlock from the welfare rolls with eugenics . that ' s largely because the President also hopes to address births outside of marriage by allowing states to cap payments for additional children , although the main focus of the White_House welfare proposal is a work requirement . Instead , sources in the Administration and on Capitol_Hill predict that the worst denunciations will emanate from groups further to the left , who already have denounced family caps and welfare cuts aimed at children born_out of wedlock as &quot; social engineering. &quot; Martha Davis , senior staff attorney at the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund , declined comment on &quot; The Bell Curve &quot; until she had read it , but noted that targeting the reproductive capacity of one population invites comparisons to eugenics . Murray insists his newest book won ' t throw more gasoline on the welfare debate . &quot; I don ' t buy the notion that this will be seized_on for nefarious purpose , &quot; he said . &quot; If you want to end welfare , do_it for reasons other_than IQ . The only way IQ is relevant is in thinking_about what kinds of reforms will or will not work. &quot; Murray ' s conclusion that society ' s less fortunate do poorly on IQ_tests will come as no surprise to those working in the field , poverty experts say . But advocates of the poor prefer to use euphemisms like &quot; low-skilled &quot; that suggest a person ' s abilities are not predetermined and can improve with outside guidance . Gueron of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corp . accedes that job-training programs historically have mixed results . However , looking_at the results of short-term interventions doesn ' t tell the full story , she adds . &quot; A six-month training_program is not the same thing as enrolling children in quality education for 12 years , &quot; she said . While Murray and Herrnstein assert that their arguments are in the mainstream of social_science , there remains in academia much disagreement about the use and effectiveness of IQ_tests in measuring innate intelligence . Critics say the pair overstate the genetic component while ignoring or dismissing important environmental factors . These critics add that Herrnstein and Murray are_on the shakiest empirical ground when they assert a genetic component in the 15-point IQ_test difference between blacks_and_whites . They used that claim to criticize affirmative_action in both education and hiring . Others , including some religious conservatives , are unnerved by the pair ' s fixation with intelligence at the expense of other human traits . &quot; We are created in the image of God , who doesn ' t make those kinds of distinctions , &quot; said Empower America ' s Wehner . &quot; IQ doesn ' t measure character or perseverance or loyalty. &quot; Ironically , it was Murray who paved a moral high road for conservatives pushing welfare reform . His first contribution was the 1984 book &quot; Losing Ground , &quot; which portrayed poor single women who had babies and then collected welfare checks as citizens making rational decisions in the face of an irrational social_welfare policy . That was followed last year by an influential Wall_Street Journal opinion piece that gave conservatives cover on the race issue by arguing that welfare reform was not just about black unwed mothers : Welfare was fostering a growing white underclass as well . The Iowa-born Murray , a Harvard graduate who insists he doesn ' t know his own IQ , spent the bulk of the 1960s in rural Thai villages , first helping the poor as a Peace Corps volunteer and later , as the Vietnam_War heated_up , conducting counterinsurgency research . He spent most of the 1970s studying the results of various social programs , particularly those aimed at criminal justice . His writings in the past decade are infused with his own experiences in the Thai countryside , as well as those from his current home town , a rural hamlet nestled in Maryland ' s picturesque hills . Murray ' s bottom-line belief is that America could regain its moorings if government stepped aside and allowed natural social pressures -- the kind found in these small-town settings -- to mold its residents into upstanding and informed citizens . On welfare , Murray has been able to push the bounds of respectable political debate . He and other like-minded thinkers encouraged conservatives to make the case that dismantling a welfare_state that distorted incentives -- ultimately hurting the poor -- was a compassionate position . Liberals , meanwhile , grew more comfortable discussing an out-of-wedlock birthrate that today hovers around 30 % . Even President Clinton last year said he agreed with Murray ' s analysis that welfare played a role in the breakdown of the family , although he stressed that he disagreed_with Murray ' s prescription to end welfare . Asked about Murray ' s latest work_at a press_conference earlier this month , Clinton said : &quot; I disagree_with the proposition that there are inherent racially based differences in the capacity of the American people to reach their full potential . . . . It goes_against our entire history and our whole tradition. &quot; In contrast to Murray ' s earlier writings , &quot; The Bell Curve &quot; takes a harsh view of the poor , asserting that their generally low cognitive abilities lead to , at best , short-sighted judgment calls and poor parenting and , at worst , to criminality . The authors ' rhetoric about poor single mothers is particularly sharp . &quot; The greatest problems afflict children unlucky enough to be born to and reared by unmarried mothers who are below average in intelligence -- about 20 % of children currently being born , &quot; Herrnstein and Murray write . &quot; They tend to do badly , socially and economically . . . . Inadequate nutrition , physical abuse , emotional neglect , lack of intellectual stimulation , a chaotic home environment . . . are very difficult to improve from outside the home when the single mother is incompetent . Incompetent mothers are highly concentrated among the least intelligent , and their numbers are growing. &quot; Murray says he wants his book to force policy-makers to take a more candid look_at the limitations of social programs . &quot; Let ' s be realistic , &quot; he said . &quot; There has been a lot of wishful_thinking that everyone can be trained for $ 18-an-hour jobs . We ' d better start thinking hard about how to create satisfying lives &quot; outside the workplace . Murray supports returning social_services to neighborhoods , where citizens can find fulfilling roles in life helping each other . He supports simplifying the criminal justice system -- with fixed and clearly stated punishments -- so that people with low mental_abilities can follow a brightly lit &quot; moral compass. &quot; And he favors shifting immigration law to emphasize competency rather than U.S. family connections in determining who can legally enter the country . In a twist typical of this unpredictable conservative , Murray also asserts that the country needs to adopt more measures to prop_up the value of the dead-end jobs that are left for the growing population of low-IQ poor . He cites the expansion of the earned income_tax credit and a negative income_tax -- both of which boost the incomes of the working poor -- as two options . &quot; Some sort of redistribution is here to stay , &quot; he and Herrnstein write . The media reaction to &quot; The Bell Curve &quot; has been overwhelmingly negative , with most editorialists denouncing the book as dangerous pseudoscience . The Wall_Street Journal and the New York Times Book_Review published positive reviews , but the New Republic experienced a near revolt among its staff over a decision to print a summary of the authors ' arguments on race . The magazine ' s editors responded to the rebellion by surrounding the article with 17 short commentaries , nearly all_of them trashing the book . Herrnstein , who enjoyed a career as a prominent Harvard scholar despite the controversy surrounding his early 1970s work_on IQ , died of cancer last summer . That leaves Murray alone to pick_up the fragments of the political grenade he has tossed . &quot; Waking_up to accusations in the paper every day that you ' re a racist loses its charm , &quot; he said caustically . &quot; I ' m surprised by the wall-to-wall vilification -- yes , that ' s the right word , vilification . The shrillness and hysteria are more marked than I would have thought . You have to give us some credit for good_faith . I expected abusive phone_calls . I expected hate mail . I did not expect so many people who present themselves as thoughtful intellectuals to knowingly misrepresent the book. &quot;</TEXT>
