   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON NORTH_KOREA ; A SPARK THAT MIGHT IGNITE ; U.S. POLICY IS MIRED IN COLD_WAR ILLUSION . PULL_OUT OUR TROOPS BEFORE THEY BECOME HOSTAGE TO HAIR-TRIGGER HOSTILITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An incident is some occurrence that may be trivial or serious , but that has effects wildly out of proportion to the actual damage done . Thus we speak_of a terrorist &quot; incident &quot; when a bombing or assassination sets_in_motion a train of events that would not normally be expected given the limited nature of the actual assault . The assassination of the Austrian crown_prince in 1914 led to World_War I ; the refusal of the Cossacks to fire on the people of St . Petersburg in 1917 led to the Russian_Revolution . The downing of a U.S. helicopter by North_Korea may also be such an incident . The pattern of events in the Pacific since the end of the Cold_War five years ago has been one of drift . Old Cold_War alignments disguise the extent of the shift in the global balance_of_power to Asia . American military deployments add_up to armed impotence under the new situations , and Americans are ill-prepared to cope_with this development . Meanwhile , what passes for strategic thought is largely public-relations posturing , bureaucratic infighting over turf and the pretense of competence by political officials in the main Pacific powers . Other likely candidates for a catalytic incident include the imminent death of Deng Xiaoping in China and the reversion of Hong Kong to mainland Chinese rule_in 1997 . But the Korean situation is , and long has been , a potential powder_keg . The United States became involved in Korea 45 years ago not because of a Korean civil_war but because of the influence of the former Soviet_Union and China on the peninsula and our belief that communist aggression in Korea was part of a global advance of communism into any susceptible society . We fought on the side of the Republic_of_Korea against armies from the North because North_Korea ' s backers were the Soviets and China . But since the Seoul Olympics of 1988 , the Republic_of_Korea has had friendly relations with both Russia and China and now has formal diplomatic ties with both . Because of the war of 1950-53 , we have ignored North_Korea ' s claims of legitimacy which it gained in the struggle against its former Japanese overlords and , as elsewhere in Asia , we refused to see that Asian communism was largely a vehicle for anti-colonial nationalism . Our presence in Korea is still locked_in a Cold_War mold . We have 37 # 000 front-line troops there , and North_Korea has been trying to catch our attention by developing nuclear_weapons . Earlier this year , North_Korea ' s intransigence over nuclear_weapons looked_like it would be the incident that would finally begin to alter Cold_War arrangements in East Asia . Through adroit diplomacy and by beating back Pentagon enthusiasts for &quot; surgical strikes , &quot; the United States seems to have defused a nuclear confrontation -- even though we still do not know exactly what happened . All we know for certain is that Kim Il Sung saw Jimmy_Carter and died . We are still waiting to find_out whether that was a natural death and we must remain alert to the probable instabilities of a successor regime in Pyongyang headed by Kim ' s son . But one thing is clear : The United States no longer has any reason to intervene in a Korean civil_war . The Republic_of_Korea has twice the population and 10 times the productive power of the North , from which come repeated reports of starvation among the population . Seoul should be fully capable of defending itself in any conflict not involving external powers or nuclear_weapons . The United States should continue to guarantee the Republic_of_Korea ' s security from nuclear attack but American ground forces should be withdrawn . Many American analysts agree but always add that the present_time is not appropriate . They fail to note that there will never be a perfect time . To leave U.S. ground forces there makes them hostage to possible events over which they have no control . The unification of Korea is today a topic of Korean politics . We can help , but we should not be caught in the middle . This is the significance of the downing last week of a U.S. Army helicopter that had strayed into North_Korean air space . The pilots probably did not know where they were ; but they had no real business being in Korea at all , and were not ready for the kind of hair-trigger mentality that exists along the Korean demilitarized zone . They were there because of Pentagon inertia and the lack of any kind of American strategic vision for post-Cold War Asia . One pilot died . When President Clinton said , &quot; This tragic loss of life was unnecessary , &quot; he did not know how close to home the responsibility for that death actually lies . Unless the United States reconceives its military , political and economic role in Asia , either this incident or some_other one will prove to be the detonator for a larger , more serious explosion .</TEXT>
