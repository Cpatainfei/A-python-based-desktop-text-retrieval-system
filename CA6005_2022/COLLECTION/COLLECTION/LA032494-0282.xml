   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : VOLUNTEERS TELL TALES OF RED_CROSS DEEDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Local American Red_Cross volunteers and people who have been served by the organization gathered Wednesday to share stories and celebrate American Red_Cross Month and the 100th anniversary of the Anaheim House . About 35 people listened to volunteers talk_about the rewards of their labor , and Mary Reed told of the dream the Red_Cross helped her to realize six months ago . In 1964 during the Vietnam_War , Reed , 36 , had been given_up for adoption by a mother desperate to get her ill child out of Saigon . Reed had contracted smallpox and was adopted by a_Thousand Oaks couple . Letters from her mother , Thanh Dao , stopped coming_after two years when Dao lost Reed ' s address during a bombing raid on her village . Dao was presumed dead . Six months ago , however , Reed was reunited with her mother , whom she hadn ' t seen in 29 years . The Red_Cross , which tracks lost family members in war-stricken areas , had searched for Dao for three years . Throughout &quot; my childhood and most of my adulthood , I always had one dream , to hold my mother in my arms , &quot; Reed said . &quot; After 29 years , my dream came true . . . . I have great respect and admiration for the Red_Cross for making my dream come true and changing my life . It ' s a happy ending. &quot; Red_Cross officials said many people don ' t know about the organization ' s free tracking service or other services that are offered throughout the year . &quot; We get a lot of coverage during the disasters , &quot; said Kara Lakkees , a spokeswoman for the Orange County chapter of the Red_Cross . &quot; But we ' re not like fairies in the night that just come_out when everything goes_bad . We ' re here all year round . Yesterday , today and always. &quot; Lakkees said aid is provided during disasters , but youth activities and social_services also are offered throughout the year . She said she hopes the celebration of Red_Cross Month will inform people about the many services offered by the organization and inspire people to become volunteers . Between tours of the Red Cross-owned and operated Anaheim House , a museum filled with Red_Cross memorabilia , Vivian Engelbrecht told why she has been a volunteer for 60 years . &quot; It ' s twofold , &quot; she explained . &quot; You get joy from doing for others and personal satisfaction . It sounds corny , but in reality it ' s the truth. &quot; MIMI KO</TEXT>
