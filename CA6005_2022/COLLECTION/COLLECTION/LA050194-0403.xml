   <HEADLINE> STATE POLITICIANS TAKE_AIM AT INMATES ' BILL OF RIGHTS ; CORRECTIONS : ANTI-CRIME FERVOR MAY DOOM THE STATUTE SIGNED BY REAGAN . IT ALLOWS CONJUGAL VISITS AND LETS PRISONERS WEAR THEIR HAIR AT ANY LENGTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the floor of the upper house , a senator launches into a harangue about Charles Manson profiting off his murderous crimes by selling song lyrics and demands repeal of the statute that would allow such an outrage . As he campaigns for office , an assemblyman lambastes Manson follower Tex Watson , charging that the same statute gave Watson the right to conjugal visits with his wife , during which he fathered three children while in prison . The focus of the politicians ' ire is the &quot; inmates bill of rights , &quot; a statute dating_back to Ronald Reagan ' s tenure as governor . In a year when baseball analogies are used as answers to crime , the inmates bill of rights is a hanging curve -- and politicians are slamming it up and down the state . It has become the stuff of sound_bites , headlines and talk_shows . With Gov . Pete Wilson ' s support , lawmakers are working to rid the state penal_code of a law they say allows imprisoned child_molesters , rapists and murderers to receive hard-core pornography , wear their hair as they choose , and sue over such slights as food that is too high in cholesterol . But lawyers for prisoners , and some state lawyers , have doubts that the statute ' s repeal will end many of the most often cited abuses . Court decisions in recent decades have affirmed that many prisoners ' rights are protected by the U.S. Constitution . The reasons behind the impending demise of the inmates bill of rights are many , some tied to the campaign season . Wilson , seeking reelection on an anti-crime platform , has made the statute ' s repeal a priority . Two bills to do_away_with the statute are being carried by Assemblyman Dean Andal ( R-Stockton ) and state Sen . Robert Presley ( D-Riverside ) . They are running against each other for a State Board of Equalization seat . But the movement to gut the statute goes beyond electioneering . The prison_guards union , an aggressive and well-financed lobby in Sacramento , is supporting the repeal effort , as are crime victims groups . As the prison population grows beyond 120 # 000 inmates , California Department of Corrections officials say it is more costly to provide benefits required by the bill of rights , such_as the right of mentally_ill prisoners to have court hearings before they are forced to take antipsychotic_drugs . Department of Corrections attorney Pam Smith-Steward also fears that in time , courts could interpret the statute so broadly that the 7 # 000 prisoners who work for the Prison Industry Authority making blue_jeans , furniture , license_plates and other products could receive minimum_wage of $ 4.25. As it is , they make an average of 55 cents an hour . Buried 586 pages deep in the California Penal Code , the inmates bill of rights is brief , only 52 words . In a single paragraph , it says that a person sentenced to prison arrives with the same rights as everyone else . Any narrowing of rights must be directly related to the prison ' s safe operation , and be the least restrictive alternative possible . A companion statute lists prisoners ' specific rights , among them , the right to marry , make wills , correspond confidentially with lawyers , own property and receive publications . Prisoner rights lawyers say most of the rights listed in the statutes are guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution . But state lawyers say court rulings have forced California to give prisoners far more_than is required by federal law . &quot; The ( California ) law says we may only restrict inmate rights if we can show a security link , &quot; Smith-Steward said . &quot; It isn ' t right . It ' s insidious. &quot; Although California is the only state with an inmates bill of rights , many states give prisoners rights beyond what is required by the U.S. Constitution . New York allows conjugal visits . Oregon pays prison workers minimum_wages . The origins of the inmates bill of rights date to Reagan ' s first term as governor . Red Nelson , then the nail-hard warden of San Quentin , recalls approaching Reagan at a reception early in 1967 . As they chatted , Reagan asked Nelson what he thought_of one of the issues of the day : Should inmates be granted overnight visits with their spouses ? It was an innovative concept . Some prison officials believed that the program would end homosexuality in prisons , and serve as a reward for good behavior . &quot; I thought it was a horrendous idea , &quot; Nelson said , and he recalls telling the governor so . Reagan did not take Nelson ' s counsel . In 1968 , he authorized conjugal visits as an experiment at one prison , and allowed prison officials to expand the policy systemwide in 1971 . &quot; We were in a period where people thought they ' re not_bad boys , &quot; Nelson said . &quot; That was the style . There was no stopping it. &quot; In 1968 , state Sen . Alan Sieroty , a liberal from Los Angeles ' Westside , teamed_up with the Friends Committee on Legislation , a Quaker lobbying organization , and proposed the legislation that first came_to be known as the inmates bill of rights . Pete Wilson , an assemblyman from San Diego , voted for it . So did George Deukmejian , then a state_senator from Long_Beach . Reagan signed it into law . At the time , politically active lawyers were attacking every aspect of the prison system , from restrictions on what inmates could read to indeterminate sentencing , which resulted in terms of up_to life for even minor crimes . It also was a time of political and racial unrest inside the prisons . George Jackson , serving time for robbery , published &quot; Soledad Brother &quot; and emerged as a leader of the Black Panthers , and a hero of leftist reformers and revolutionaries . Accused of killing a prison_guard at Soledad , Jackson was moved to the highest security block in the prison system , the Adjustment Center at San Quentin . In a visit , a gun was smuggled to Jackson in August , 1971 , setting_off the worst riot in California prison history . Jackson was shot to death , and three officers were killed . When Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr . became governor in 1974 , he brought with him some of the lawyers who had been suing the prisons . Sieroty and the Quakers saw a chance to expand the inmates bill of rights . &quot; The attitudes were so_much different in those days , &quot; said Sieroty , who retired from the Legislature in 1982 . &quot; There was a feeling that prison reform was a worthwhile thing. &quot; Although Brown was skeptical of Sieroty ' s bill , an aide to the then-governor recalled that Corrections Department chief Ray Procunier urged Brown to support it . &quot; His argument was that this would calm things down in the prison system , &quot; said the former aide . The bill was signed into law in 1975 . Today , Sieroty is upset that his work is threatened . He called the statute even more important now , given that the inmate population has sextupled since 1975 . &quot; Pornography was not the reason we wrote the bill , &quot; Sieroty said . &quot; The issues were much broader than that. &quot; The Department of Corrections has been trying to weaken the statute since at least 1987 , with no success . This year , however , the Legislature ' s attitude changed dramatically after the kidnap-murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas and arrest of parolee Richard Allen Davis for the crime . Crime quickly rose to the top of the California political agenda and , since the start of the year , the Legislature has been approving anti-crime bills at a frenetic pace . The inmates bill of rights has became a symbol for the &quot; coddling &quot; criminal justice system . In the Senate , Presley , the Legislature ' s top expert on prisons , introduced a bill to abolish the bill of rights . He said the costs of operating the prisons can be cut if the statute is repealed . His bill cleared the Senate overwhelmingly this month , and is awaiting Assembly action . In the Assembly , Andal introduced an identical bill , with Wilson ' s backing . Andal and Assemblyman Phil Isenberg ( D- Sacramento ) reworked the bill to have California adopt the the federal standard governing prisons . The bill passed the Assembly 60-0 Thursday and goes_to the Senate . Under the federal standard , wardens can impose restrictions if they are &quot; reasonably &quot; related to some prison-related interest . The current statute says any regulations must be the least restrictive . Lawyers who represent prisoners in civil_rights claims say the federal standard is toothless . But even under the federal standard , many rights in the inmates bill of rights -- to marry , maintain bank_accounts , file lawsuits , correspond confidentially with lawyers -- will be protected , said San Francisco attorney William B . Turner , an expert on prison law . With or without the state statute , Turner added , wardens will not be able to stop most pornography and racist material from getting_into the prisons . That , too , is protected by federal constitutional law . As the California law now reads , prisoners can receive almost anything the Postal Service will deliver -- short of writings about gambling , bomb making or escape . There likely will be lawsuits if the prisons try to significantly restrict pornography from reaching prisoners . Whether the state would win in court is unclear . Its track record has not been great . A man , imprisoned for second-degree murder for killing his 6-month-old daughter , received sadomasochistic photos of adult women . When prison officials seized the pictures , he sued in 1992 , and a federal judge urged state lawyers to settle the case . They did , giving_back some photos and paying the prisoner $ 1 # 200 for pictures officials had destroyed . There also is doubt among lawyers , including some who work for the state , that other often-cited abuses can be stopped . Sen . Charles Calderon ( D-Whittier ) is pushing a bill aimed at stopping prisoners such_as Manson from profiting from their crimes . Similar laws have been struck_down by federal_courts . Prison authorities do not expect immediate sweeping changes if the statute is repealed . Wilson would eliminate conjugal visits for sex offenders and those serving life terms , but prison authorities say the program helps promote better conduct by other inmates . The prison system permits 25 # 000 conjugal visits a year at a cost to the state of $ 3 million . As recently as last year , the Department of Corrections defended conjugal visits , saying in a memo to Andal that &quot; family visitation is a valuable tool for inmate management &quot; and a &quot; proven rehabilitative program. &quot; All this is not to say there would not be changes . Prisons would regain broader rights to control inmates ' hair or beard length . Authorities also may regain some powers lost as a result of court rulings interpreting the statute . One that bothers officials came_in 1986 , when a court of appeal held that the inmates bill of rights gave mentally_ill prisoners the right to demand a court hearing before they could be forced to take antipsychotic_drugs . The state has lost only 17 of the 494 court hearings since 1990 . But there are court and prison costs , and corrections officials say less expensive administrative_hearings should suffice in California . In the prisons , where small slights often loom large , there is talk_about the legislative effort to repeal the bill of rights . Hyperbolic flyers are circulating urging inmates to tell their families and friends to call lawmakers and voice their opposition to its repeal . &quot; You are in danger of losing all your rights , &quot; a flyer warns . Without the statute , the flyers say , prisoners will lose the right to marry , own property , make wills , sue , get visits , or correspond confidentially with lawyers -- though no politician is suggesting repealing such rights .</TEXT>
