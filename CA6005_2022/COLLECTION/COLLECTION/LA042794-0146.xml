   <HEADLINE> S . AFRICANS CAST HISTORIC VOTES ; ELECTION : HOSPITAL PATIENTS , THE DISABLED AND RETIREES FLOCK TO POLLS IN HIGH SPIRITS ON FIRST DAY . A BOMB EXPLODES AT JOHANNESBURG ' S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Democracy dawned with a flourish across South_Africa on Tuesday as hospital patients , pensioners , the disabled and other &quot; special voters &quot; flocked to this country ' s first all-race polls in unexpectedly high numbers and remarkably good_spirits . The opening day of the historic three-day election for the post-apartheid government was marred by widespread confusion and hundreds of complaints of logistic problems and technical glitches at urban and rural polling_stations . These included missing ballots , late starts and long lines . In a resurgence of violence apparently aimed at disrupting the watershed election , an explosion rocked the international departures hall at Johannesburg ' s Jan Smuts Airport today , wounding at least three people , police said . &quot; There was an explosion on the second floor of the international departures hall . . . . Three people have been injured , &quot; said Col . Jan Myburgh , according to the Reuters news_agency . The blast is the latest in a series of bombings that have killed 21 people and kept South_Africa on edge since the weekend . But there was no major poll violence on Tuesday . Sick and elderly black voters who have waited all their lives to cast a ballot began lining_up before dawn in cities , towns and townships across the nation . Some were carried in blankets and wheelbarrows . Many waited as long as eight hours under the baking sun in columns that extended for more_than half a mile . Far more voters showed_up than were anticipated , officials said , although no official count was available . The vast majority of the 22.7 million eligible voters -- including up_to 18 million first-time black voters -- will cast ballots at 9 # 000 heavily guarded polling_stations today and Thursday . It remains to be seen if the glitches that dogged Tuesday ' s balloting will become nightmarish obstacles and lead to violence under a flood of voters . Here in the country ' s largest black township , patients at the sprawling Baragwanath Hospital , one of the biggest hospitals in Africa , hobbled in on crutches , rolled_up in wheelchairs and marched up in tattered bathrobes and threadbare pajamas to vote . &quot; I never thought this day would come , &quot; said a beaming Mary Lele , 72 , clutching her grandson ' s arm as she walked slowly , but with pride , to cast her first ballot . &quot; I ' m very happy. &quot; Ruth Mashaba , 73 , carried her 2-year-old granddaughter in a red sling on her back . &quot; I want her to see freedom , &quot; she said with a toothless smile . Lettie Mogatwe , 42 , rode in a wheelchair , her broken left leg in a new cast . Despite the pain , she grinned with delight when she left the polling_booth . &quot; I think it ' s the end of apartheid , &quot; she said . &quot; we ' ll not be oppressed anymore . . . . we ' ll all be equal. &quot; But not all_the first day ' s 2 # 219 fixed and mobile polling_stations were equal . In the Zulu strongholds of KwaZulu and Natal , a plan to deliver special stickers to attach_to the ballots for supporters of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi ' s Inkatha Freedom Party apparently went awry . Scores of polling_booths did not receive the stickers , or got them late in the day , leaving thousands of disappointed and angry voters in one of the country ' s most volatile areas . Buthelezi , who only last week dropped his militant boycott of the elections , called_for an extension of the three-day voting period to alleviate the problem . &quot; I ' m extremely , extremely worried , &quot; Buthelezi told reporters . He also complained hourly to the head of the Independent Electoral Commission , Judge Johann Kriegler . At an evening news_conference , Kriegler said the voting could not be extended but acknowledged that the commission had been overwhelmed on its first day of voting . &quot; In a nutshell , the picture is far from perfect , but much , much further from disastrous , &quot; he said . But Kriegler , who has labored from the campaign ' s start to gloss_over allegations of inefficiency and disorganization in the election preparations , called the day a &quot; godsend. &quot; &quot; We had a trial run today and picked_up a large_number of bugs and hitches and glitches , &quot; he said . IEC Commissioner Ben van der Ross said the worst problems were in three areas . &quot; Very serious shortages &quot; of election materials were reported in Transkei , he said . Communications had broken_down in northern Transvaal . And several tribal_chiefs had tried to &quot; take the law into their own hands and commandeer the polling_stations &quot; in Natal , he said . Allegations of fraud were reported in several areas , but none was substantiated . Reports from other areas around the country were also worrisome . Voting was delayed for up_to eight hours because of missing ballots or equipment in the mining town of Kimberly , while voting at Durban General Hospital did not begin until midafternoon . Polling was also delayed up_to seven hours in townships in the East Rand and along the coast in Port Elizabeth and Port Shepstone . Only ballots for the National Assembly arrived in parts of Newcastle , although voters must mark another ballot for provincial legislatures . Officials reported tension at two prisons after voting was delayed until the afternoon . And the boat carrying election officials and ballot papers to Robben Island , the infamous prison that once was home to Nelson Mandela , broke_down in Cape_Town Harbor . The 700 prisoners voted later . South_Africans in 80 countries around the world were also able to vote . Mandela ' s niece Nomoza Patin was the first to cast a ballot , by virtue of her location in Wellington , New Zealand , which is closest to the international dateline . &quot; It means a restoration of dignity . . . for every South_African person , &quot; she told news services of her vote . In Johannesburg , African National Congress spokesman Pallo Jordan told a news_conference that the first day of voting had been rockier than expected . &quot; We aren ' t that shocked by it , although we are dismayed by it , &quot; he said . Still , enthusiasm and a sense of forgiving seemed the order_of_the_day for a_people finally able to choose their own leaders and rule their own land . &quot; It is an incredible feeling , like falling_in_love , &quot; gushed Anglican Archbishop Desmond M . Tutu , winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his outspoken campaign against apartheid . He will vote today . Frederik W . de Klerk , who will trade his job as Africa ' s last white head_of_state for one as deputy executive_vice_president under Mandela , said he had no regrets about freeing Mandela from prison in 1990 and starting the transition from apartheid to democracy . &quot; I wanted this election to take_place . . . . That is what I have been working for , &quot; he said as he escorted his 89-year-old mother , Corrie , to vote_in Pretoria . * RELATED STORY : B9 At the Ballot_Box Democracy has arrived in South_Africa , with a three-day nationwide election .
