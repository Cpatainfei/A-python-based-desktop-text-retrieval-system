   <HEADLINE> KOHL ' S PARTY SETS QUOTAS FOR WOMEN ; GERMANY : CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS WILL SET_ASIDE ONE-THIRD OF CANDIDACIES , POSTS . POLLS HAVE SHOWN A LOSS OF FEMALE VOTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s Christian Democratic Union , seeking to broaden its appeal after a bare-bones election victory , decided Monday to adopt a quota system to boost the power and profile of women in the party . The measure , narrowly approved at the Christian Democrats ' annual congress , ensures that a third of all party posts will go_to women and that women will make_up a third of CDU candidates in elections at all levels beginning next year . Kohl , who was reelected as chancellor for a fourth term this month by a one-vote margin in Parliament , spoke out for the quota system as a way to begin strengthening the party for 1998 elections . &quot; If we want to get a start into the future , we have to do_it now , &quot; Kohl said . &quot; The image of the CDU is colored by how it deals with change in society. &quot; The CDU and its Bavarian sister party , the Christian Social Union , are seen as socially conservative and dominated by graying men like Kohl , elected to his 11th term as party chief at the daylong congress . Women have been campaigning for more power within the party for years , yet less than 14 % of the CDU ' s new parliamentary delegation is female -- contrasted with an average of 26 % for the entire German legislature and 59 % for the leftist Greens party . The Social Democrats , Germany ' s leading opposition party , and the Greens adopted quotas in the 1980s , but the Christian Democrats had resisted . That was clear at the party congress , a predominantly suit-and-tie gathering where women delegates gathered_in groups to discuss strategy for prodding stodgy men . &quot; We have tried_for 10 years to change the situation and we have had no luck , &quot; delegate Ingeborg Mittelstaedt said . &quot; I think this quota system is necessary . There is a generation of men ( in_charge ) that believes a man is more intelligent , stronger and not disturbed by family affairs. &quot; The measure was controversial even among women , however , with some objecting that it reduced them to tokens and second-class citizens . &quot; I am decidedly against this quota , because we should judge people for their qualifications , not their gender , &quot; said delegate Tonia Meyer . &quot; For my part , I don ' t want to get elected to a post and afterward have all men look_at me with a patronizing air and thinking , ' Our quota woman. ' &quot; The party ' s most prominent woman and parliamentary leader , Rita Suessmuth , answered critics , saying that &quot; if it went_by ability and the qualification of women , we would n ' t be fighting about a third today but rather about an equal participation of women and men. &quot; The quota system was approved by a 416-361 vote . It goes_into effect next year for a five-year trial period . CDU polls showing that the party has lost women and younger voters clearly prompted Kohl to make one of the more surprising moves of his 12 years as chancellor -- naming a 28-year-old woman from the former East_Germany to his new Cabinet as minister for women , family , youth and pensioners . But the minister , Claudia Nolte , is a crusading Roman_Catholic anti-abortionist whose far-right positions are so extreme that some people in the party fear she could scare_off as_many women as she might attract . Nolte once suggested that women who have had abortions should be required to work in a hospital for a year to make amends . Since her appointment , she has said she strongly favors the idea of the state ' s paying women a cash bonus of 1 # 000 German marks ( about $ 640 ) for each newborn baby . Many women from the former East_Germany feel that they have lost rights since the fall of communism and the 1990 reunification with the former West Germany . Unemployment is high among eastern women , who under communism had guaranteed jobs and child_care centers . Even westerners have their doubts about the new minister , noted for having curtsied before Kohl at a party meeting in Dresden in her efforts to draw his attention . &quot; Perhaps she is not the figure to integrate the women in Germany , especially the ones in the east , &quot; said Karin Gedaschko , a lawyer and CDU delegate . &quot; Her problem seems to be that she is not typical of the women in the CDU and eastern Germany too , for her age . I ' m five years older , and I don ' t feel that she represents me too well. &quot; Kohl ' s attention to women ' s issues is groundwork for the 1998 election , when the chancellor has vowed to step_down . It is generally acknowledged that Kohl carried his governing coalition to its narrow , 10-seat majority in Parliament . The party needs to broaden its base if it hopes to continue its reign .</TEXT>
