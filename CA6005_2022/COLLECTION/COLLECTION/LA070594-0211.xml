   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN POLICE BACK PLAN FOR JOINT ANTI-MOB EFFORT ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : FBI CHIEF WINDS_UP TRIP THROUGH FORMER SOVIET BLOC . HE CITES NUCLEAR PIRACY FEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Warning that organized crime in Russia poses &quot; a significant and direct threat to the United States , &quot; FBI Director Louis J . Freeh won support from Russian police Monday for a joint crackdown on mobsters , including anyone trying to pirate and sell nuclear bomb-making material . &quot; We are proud to join in this battle with you , &quot; Freeh said in a pep talk to 500 elite officers at Russia ' s Interior Ministry Academy . He urged them to act decisively , but within the law , to stop Russia ' s mob from growing as powerful as the American Mafia of the 1920s and ' 30s . The half-hour address was the keynote of a three-day visit to lay_down what Freeh called &quot; a police-to-police bridge &quot; between the former Cold_War enemies . He closed with verse from the late Russian poet Anna Akhmatova : &quot; The hour for courage strikes upon our clocks , And courage will not desert us. &quot; Freeh is winding_up a 10-day trip -- the first by an FBI chief through the former Soviet Bloc -- that netted agreements allowing his agents to gather records , interview witnesses and seek criminal evidence in Germany , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary , Poland , Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia and Ukraine . A similar accord , to be signed here today , will clear the way for systematic exchanges between the FBI and Russian police to prevent and solve such crimes as drug trafficking , kidnaping , extortion , fraud , money_laundering and terrorism in both countries . To oversee these exchanges , the FBI is setting_up a permanent office in Moscow and staffing it with two Russian-speaking agents supervised by the U.S. ambassador . &quot; We have now already joined ( forces ) , &quot; Sergei V . Stepashin , chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service , said after meeting Freeh at his office inside one of the most dreaded Soviet landmarks -- the former KGB headquarters and execution chamber on Moscow ' s Lubyanka Square . &quot; When we are together , we ' re undefeatable , &quot; the Russian spymaster added . Yet it remains to be seen how much police cooperation there can be between two powerful nations that still spy on each other . It was only five months ago that the arrest of a high-level Russian &quot; mole &quot; inside the CIA shook_up the post-Soviet friendship between Washington and Moscow . Before Freeh ' s arrival Saturday night , Stepashin dismissed as unwarranted the nightmare scenario that prompted the visit in the first place -- that Russian nuclear_weapons and materials are vulnerable to terrorists and criminal groups throughout the old Soviet Bloc . &quot; All attempts to accuse Russia of being unable to control its nuclear_weapons have clear political goals , &quot; Alexander Mikhailov , a spokesman for Stepashin ' s spy agency , said last week . &quot; They are aimed at preparing Western public_opinion for the idea of establishing political control over Russian nuclear weapons. &quot; U.S. and German officials have reported three suspected diversions of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium material from Russia since 1993 . While the quantity of material in each case was thought to be insufficient to produce a bomb , Freeh said Monday that the risk of &quot; loose nukes &quot; is growing . &quot; We cannot afford to wait until there is a successful diversion of a significant amount of nuclear material before we develop and implement . . . a plan_of_action to address this grave threat , &quot; he told the academy officers . Lt . Andrei V . Tikhanov , a 29-year-old student in the packed auditorium , agreed . &quot; Worse come_to worst , the consequences would n ' t spare anyone , &quot; he said . &quot; Mr. Freeh calls_for cooperation just in time for us to be able to avert this menace. &quot; Judging from daily news_reports , the officers in the audience , who earn an average of $ 150 per month , are fighting a losing battle against rich and powerful criminal gangs that have mushroomed since the Soviet police_state collapsed in 1991 and now number an estimated 5 # 600 . While the United States is &quot; an increasingly desirable target of opportunity &quot; for such gangs , Freeh said , they pose an even greater danger to their own country ' s democratic hopes . He said Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin was right to call the mob Russia ' s top security threat . Eager to show their guest that Yeltsin ' s latest crackdown on crime is working , the police said Monday that they had arrested a gang for allegedly holding an 8-month-old girl hostage for 32 days and collecting a $ 270 # 000 ransom from her businessman father by threatening to cut_off her head . A separate announcement said police had seized members of a neo-Nazi skinhead group called Legion of Werewolf , accused of plotting to burn_down every Moscow theater showing the Oscar-winning film &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot;</TEXT>
