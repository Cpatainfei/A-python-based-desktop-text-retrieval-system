   <HEADLINE> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY : CITY_HALL LEARNS AN OLD MANURE PILE PROVES A FERTILE AREA FOR LITIGATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three city officials in Rolling Hills Estates could soon find themselves in court being grilled about horse manure . that ' s right , horse manure . Mayor Barbara Rauch , Councilman Robert Beck and City_Manager Doug Prichard have been subpoenaed by an attorney representing the Empty Saddle Club in a lawsuit filed by one of the owners of a property next to the riding club . The property_owner , John Robertson Jr. , is suing the club for dumping a reported 50-foot-high pile of manure and other waste onto the Chandler Trust property next door . He says the manure has been piling_up for years , and , for fairly obvious reasons , he wants it to stop . The club maintains it was given permission for the manure dumping by Robertson ' s grandfather , Linden H . Chandler , a long_time ago . Meanwhile , the city , which has been asked by attorney Robert L . Luty to provide documents and testify in court concerning the dumping , says it does not want to get involved . &quot; We want to see that thing cleaned_up , but we don ' t know who ' s at_fault , &quot; Prichard said . * When you think_about farming , you probably envision rich , fertile fields , golden rows of wheat , fluffy bolls of cotton or maybe some contented cows grazing in a vast pasture . But that ' s not farming in Los Angeles County , and the 48th ( Assembly ) District Agricultural Assn. , a group that promotes farming education in urban_areas , wants city kids to know that they don ' t have to live_out in the country to farm . The group offers free materials for projects about plants , animals and the joys of farming to area schools , including Catskill Elementary and Del Amo Elementary in Carson and Rogers Intermediate in Lawndale . &quot; The whole trick here is showing the kids that when you talk agriculture , you ' re not talking just cows and horses and being out on the farm , &quot; said Yvonne Savio , a spokeswoman for the program . &quot; It ' s hydroponics ( farming without soil ) and science and math as well . . . . We try to show them that growing your own little garden means having food , and growing cotton means T-shirts , &quot; Savio said . Last year , students and entire classrooms won more_than $ 18 # 000 for exhibits they made_for the program , and several teachers who participated won computers for their classrooms . * There may_not be enough room in Redondo Beach for the both of ' em . Redondo Beach City Treasurer Alice E . DeLong says she doesn ' t want City Councilman Joseph Dawidziak near her because he causes her &quot; distress. &quot; She also filed an incident report with the Police_Department last weekend , complaining that she felt Dawidziak was watching her . She made the report after an angry confrontation with the councilman Friday in City_Hall about a memo Dawidziak had written accusing Delong of a possible ethics violation . According to Dawidziak , DeLong confronted him in an &quot; agitated state , &quot; yelling and waving her arms about . &quot; She brought it all up , &quot; Dawidziak said at this week ' s council meeting . &quot; Called me the ' Bad Man of the West. ' It ' s not true. &quot; DeLong said the allegations against her are politically motivated . &quot; There ' s absolutely no conflict_of_interest , &quot; DeLong said , adding that she has reported the business interest Dawidziak talked_about in his memo every year on the disclosure documents she files . QUOTE OF THE WEEK &quot; See , at school I get respect for being smart , but on the street I get respect for being cool. &quot; George Lupersio , 14 , who just finished eighth grade at Lennox Middle_School , on the pull between continuing with his education or joining a gang .
