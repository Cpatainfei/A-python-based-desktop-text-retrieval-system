   <HEADLINE> RIGHTS GROUP ACCUSES NATIONS OF FINE WORDS , FOUL DEEDS ; REPORT : MANY GOVERNMENTS ARE HYPOCRITICAL , SOME ABUSE ACTIVISTS , AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL STUDY SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a depressing report scheduled for release today on the state of human_rights around the globe , Amnesty International accused most of the world ' s governments of pledging support for human_rights with lofty rhetoric , then abusing human_rights in practice . Many victims , in fact , are human_rights activists who are struggling against terrible odds to tell the truth about the woeful state of human_rights in their countries , the report said . &quot; Governments that victimize human_rights activists almost invariably have a great_deal to hide , &quot; Amnesty International said . As an example of hypocrisy , the report cited South_Korea , which arrested one of its most prominent human_rights advocates last year , just a_few weeks after the South_Korean foreign_minister told the U.N. World Conference on Human_Rights in Vienna : &quot; I am happy to report to you that human_rights have finally come_of_age in Korea. &quot; &quot; There was a lot of official talk_about human_rights in 1993 , &quot; Amnesty International said . &quot; The noise reached a crescendo . . . when government representatives met at the . . . conference . . . . But even as they were making worthy declarations . . activists were being threatened , imprisoned , tortured and gunned down. &quot; The report , issued annually , chronicled and assessed events in 1993 . But Amnesty International , a private worldwide group of volunteers devoted to protecting political_prisoners and other human_rights victims , added a supplement to update the problems in several countries . Summing_up the situation around the globe in 1993 , Amnesty International reported more_than 10 # 000 people -- half of them in Africa -- in 61 countries were executed by government forces without a trial or other judicial hearing . More_than 700 people , 200 in Iraq alone , in 27 countries &quot; disappeared &quot; after government forces took them away . Almost 4 # 000 prisoners were subjected_to torture , rape and other ill treatment in 112 countries , the report said . Also , more_than 600 people died of torture in 49 countries , more_than 100 # 000 were imprisoned without charges or trial in 58 countries , and almost 2 # 000 prisoners , 70 % of them in China , were executed in 33 countries , including 38 in the United States . The organization is unconditionally opposed to the death_penalty , which it considers &quot; a gross violation of human rights. &quot; In a country-by-country rundown , Amnesty International found continuation of grave human_rights violations in China , numerous killings of civilians in Turkey by both government forces and Kurdish rebels , and continued use of executions in the United States . Some other findings : * Haiti -- The military and its armed civilian auxiliaries have carried_out violations &quot; with complete impunity. &quot; A member of FRAPH -- one of the auxiliaries -- shot 17-year-old Saurel Guerrier through the heart in January &quot; because he was suspected of being connected with a children ' s home established by ( deposed President Jean-Bertrand ) Aristide. &quot; Amnesty International said that more_than 200 evident executions by the military and its allies between January and May of this year are under investigation . It also reported a surge in political rapes of &quot; women believed to support President Aristide ' s return and female relatives and friends of his supporters. &quot; The victims included pregnant women and children as young as 10 . * Mexico -- After the seizure of several municipalities in Chiapas by the Zapatista National Liberation Army in January , the report said , &quot; the Mexican army arbitrarily arrested hundreds of Mexican citizens and denied them due_process . While in custody , they were ill-treated and subjected_to various forms of torture. &quot; Amnesty International said 400 Mexican troops entered the village of Morelia on Jan . 7 , forcing everyone into the streets and smashing the heads of some of the men . Three villagers were tortured for five hours and then taken_away . Their bodies were found several weeks later . Fourteen other villagers &quot; disappeared &quot; with the troops , the report said . * Rwanda -- Amnesty International accepted U.N. and press estimates of more_than 200 # 000 dead since the massacres erupted in early April . &quot; Some reliable estimates put the number as high as half a_million , &quot; the organization said . &quot; In addition to the vast killings , numerous other human_rights violations have been committed. &quot;</TEXT>
