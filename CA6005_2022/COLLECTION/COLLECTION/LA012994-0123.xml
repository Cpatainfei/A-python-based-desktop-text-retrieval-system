   <HEADLINE> GRAF MAKES IT FOUR IN A ROW WITH AUSTRALIAN OPEN WIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steffi Graf , back to her dominance of yore , blasted forehand winners at will to defeat Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , 6-0 , 6-2 , Saturday to win her fourth Australian Open title . Graf , who won her fourth consecutive Grand_Slam title , finished the match in 57 minutes . She lost only 12 points in the first set as she overwhelmed Sanchez Vicario , much to the delight of Graf ' s kazoo-tooting fans . &quot; If this is the way that I ' m playing , I don ' t care about the score or the length or whether it ' s a final or the first round , &quot; Graf said . &quot; It ' s such a great feeling to be able to play that way. &quot; It was her 15th Grand_Slam title and her most overpowering performance in a Grand_Slam final since defeating Natalia Zvereva , 6-0 , 6-0 , in 32 minutes at the 1988 French Open . She earned $ 322 # 000 with Saturday ' s victory ; Sanchez Vicario got $ 161 # 000 . &quot; It ' s my fourth Grand_Slam in a row and I ' m pretty proud_of it , &quot; Graf said . The victory made_it 13 straight Grand_Slam titles that have been won by Graf or Monica Seles , a streak stretching back to the 1990 U.S. Open . Seles , who had won the previous three Australian Open titles , is recovering from being stabbed in the back by a spectator last April in Germany . Since Seles was injured , Graf has won all four of the Grand_Slam tournaments that have been contested . She needed three sets to win the_French Open and Wimbledon last year , and dropped six games to Helena Sukova while winning last year ' s U.S. Open . On Saturday , Graf was_on the attack from the start . The 24-year-old German breezed_through the first set_in 24 minutes , finishing it with a powerful cross-court winner on a service return . When Sanchez Vicario finally won a game early in the second set , she slammed a ball high in the air in celebration . But Graf soon finished_out the match , pumping her left fist in the air after completing the match with a backhand passing shot . &quot; I ' m very proud to finally make_it into the final here , but it was not my day , &quot; said Sanchez Vicario , a 23-year-old Spaniard who had lost in the semifinals the previous three years . &quot; I made a lot of errors and I didn ' t play well . My legs were not working today . I was late every time to the ball. &quot; Pete Sampras -- trying to become the third man to win Wimbledon , the U.S. Open and the Australian Open consecutively -- plays Todd Martin Sunday for the men ' s title in an all-American final . The last triple was accomplished by Roy Emerson in 1964-65 . Before that , Don Budge did_it in 1937-38 . Sampras has won both of his previous meetings with Martin , including a five-set victory at the 1992 U.S. Open . Sunday ' s match will be the first all-American final at the Australian Open since 1982 , when Johan Kriek defeated Steve Denton . Jim Courier , seeded third and ousted by Sampras in the semifinals , failed to become the first man to win three straight Australian Open titles since Emerson won five straight from 1963-67 . But he now has a 2-9 career record against Sampras . &quot; He was tough , &quot; Courier said . &quot; He didn ' t make any mistakes. &quot;</TEXT>
