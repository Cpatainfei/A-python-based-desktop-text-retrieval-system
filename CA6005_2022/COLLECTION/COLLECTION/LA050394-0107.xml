   <HEADLINE> YOUR BODY : BODY WATCH ; CURBING THE CRAVING FOR FATTY FOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Yesterday you promised yourself you would cut_down on fat-filled foods . Today you indulged in a single scoop of double chocolate_fudge -- but you were kind enough to hold the cone -- and your taste buds sent an all-points bulletin to your brain : We can ' t live without this stuff ! So how do you reduce fat in your diet without undue tears and deprivation ? Retrain that palate ! OK , so you ' re thinking what a failure it was when you tried to retrain your dog to like the couch less . But , really , it can be done . Learning to prefer lower-fat foods is one way . Another approach is to incorporate foods &quot; engineered &quot; to taste as if they still contain real fat . Each method has its pros and cons . * Heel , Palate ! : &quot; If you want to shift , eat foods naturally low in fat with no fat substitutes , &quot; advises Richard Mattes , a researcher and nutritionist at Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia . To eliminate urges for high-fat foods , Mattes says , &quot; you must reduce the exposure to ' mouth feel. ' &quot; that ' s scientific-ese for the great feeling of ice_cream and other high-fat foods sliding over your tongue . In fake-fat -- or modified -- foods , manufacturers try to re-create that mouth-feel without the fat grams , sometimes more successfully than others . Once you have avoided high-fat foods for eight to 12 weeks , you will begin to prefer lower-fat foods , Mattes says . He bases this on a recent study . * The Fat Study : Mattes assigned subjects_to three groups . One group was advised to follow a reduced-fat diet and omit all &quot; discretionary &quot; fat sources , such_as table spreads and mayonnaise . Another group was placed on the same reduced-fat diet but allowed to eat fat-modified products . The diet was not modified in the control group . After 12 weeks , the two groups on the diets had reduced fat intake about the same amount -- from more_than 30 % of total calories to less than 20 % . But the &quot; pleasantness &quot; ratings for high-fat food declined only in the group that did not use fat-modified products , says Mattes , whose study was published last year in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . Because they reduced their exposure to fat , he says , they began to want it less . * Whoa , Fat : While eating foods with fat substitutes or the fat removed will reduce overall fat intake , it won ' t retrain your palate , he says . You will continue to crave high-fat foods . &quot; If it feels_like fat in your mouth , that ' s what you should avoid , &quot; Mattes says . * A Vote for Fake Fats : Relying only on naturally low-fat foods is unrealistic , given hectic schedules and lifestyles , contends Alicia Moag-Stahlberg , a Chicago dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Assn . She sees no harm in_using a two-pronged approach , choosing lower-fat foods when you can , but also adding foods that have been modified to reduce or eliminate fat . ( Fat substitutes can be found in a number of foods , including ice_cream ; low-fat_milk is an example of modified fat. ) Liking the taste of fat is more_than a sensory experience , she says . It ' s tied_in to upbringing , family rituals and other factors . In her efforts to cut fat in the family diet , Moag-Stahlberg soon learned &quot; not to mess with ( her ) family ' s ice cream. &quot; Her husband and two children will tolerate fat substitutes in some foods , but not dessert . Her husband grew_up eating dessert every night and considers it a comforting family ritual . Moag-Stahlberg says more studies like Mattes ' are needed to prove that retraining the palate to prefer less fat can be accomplished in the eight to 12 week period he cites . * Caveats : Whether you try to reduce fat intake by eating foods naturally low in fat or foods engineered to be low in fat , beware : If you think you ' re eating low-fat foods , it ' s easy to overeat . In another study -- published last year in the International Journal of Obesity -- Mattes and researcher Florence Caputo gave 17 subjects the same meal over three 12-day time blocks . During one time block , they told the subjects that the meals contained about the same amount of fat as they normally ate . During another time block , they said the meals contained more fat than usual and during yet another time block , less fat . The subjects thought the study ' s purpose was to examine the effect of fat intake on odor perception . &quot; When people thought they were eating less fat , they ate more total calories , &quot; Mattes says . * Trimming Fat : Victoria Moran , author of &quot; Get the Fat Out : 501 Simple Ways to Cut the Fat in Any Diet , &quot; suggests : * Buying quality , non-stick cookware so you are less likely to throw_in a pat of butter while cooking . * Buying expensive knives so that chopping vegetables is less of a chore . * Considering gourmet condiments -- such_as raspberry vinegar , capers and Dijon mustard -- that don ' t add appreciable fat . * Using freshly ground pepper and salt . * Washing and spinning dry salad_greens before you put them in the refrigerator . When the time comes , making a salad will seem like less work . * Putting salad_oil in a spray bottle ( or buy_it that way ) ; you ' ll probably use less .</TEXT>
