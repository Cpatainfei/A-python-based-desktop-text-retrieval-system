   <HEADLINE> FEARS ABOUT ASSASSINATION OF ARISTIDE TROUBLE U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A recurring nightmare haunts Clinton_Administration officials laboring to make Haiti a functioning democracy -- that exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will return to the Caribbean nation Saturday and be cut_down by an assassin ' s bullet , plunging the country into a bloody civil_war . &quot; The first thing we have to do is to get Aristide back and keep him alive , &quot; a senior official said . &quot; that ' s the test of this weekend , whether Aristide gets_back and things stay under control. &quot; Aristide ' s principal American adviser agrees . &quot; I ' m fearful of the situation in Haiti , &quot; former Maryland Rep . Michael D . Barnes said . &quot; There are a large_number of heavily armed men who are opposed to the restoration of democracy. &quot; Aristide has already survived several assassination attempts , two of them in the first eight months of his presidency , before he was thrown_out by a military coup . If his opponents succeed in killing him now , one official said , &quot; the reaction in the streets could be an explosion of terrible violence. &quot; One senior official said the Administration is particularly worried about the first days after Aristide ' s return , in part because the Haitian leader does not have a government in place yet . As a result , the United States is mounting an extraordinary effort to keep Haiti ' s president safe in his own country . When Aristide arrives in Port-au-Prince on Saturday , a U.S. Army helicopter will whisk him from the airport to his re-inauguration ceremony . U.S. military_forces will ring the Presidential Palace where the president lives and works . &quot; No parade , &quot; a U.S. official said , saying it would be too dangerous to expose Aristide to crowds . The CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies have launched a crash program to detect possible plots against Aristide . One official said that several sabotage attempts by remnants of the military regime already have been foiled . And last week , the State_Department signed a million-dollar contract with a private Virginia security firm , MVM Inc. , to provide a personal bodyguard detail for Aristide until his Haitian security team can complete its training . &quot; Our people are already in country , &quot; said Karen Marquez , co-owner of the firm . &quot; They will be in President Aristide ' s security detail , along with his Haitian detail , until the State_Department decides that the Haitians are ready to take over. &quot; Under the contract , the United States will pay the salaries and expenses of 21 security experts , including former Secret_Service and State_Department bodyguards , for three to nine months . The total cost , depending_on the amount_of_time the bodyguards remain in Haiti , could approach $ 2 million , officials said . &quot; We took this route because we wanted to get the U.S._government out of the business of protecting Aristide as soon as possible , &quot; a senior official said . In his three years in exile in Washington , Aristide has been protected by the Secret_Service 24 hours a day . Aristide ' s daily briefings by American officials have included several long meetings to negotiate the details of his security arrangements , aides said . And during his last week in exile , amid frenzied preparations for his return to Haiti , Aristide took time_out to thank the Americans who helped move the Administration toward the assertive policy that finally pushed the military regime out of power . Aristide plans to return to Port-au-Prince in a caravan of at least two passenger jets , carrying not only his aides but members of the U.S. Congress , other supporters and anchors from four major American television networks . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher will go as head of the official U.S. delegation . The tangible prospect of death for anyone seeking democracy in Haiti was the theme of one of Aristide ' s farewell appearances here Wednesday , a memorial for Guy Malary , his justice minister who was assassinated last year . The ceremony , sponsored by the Robert F . Kennedy Memorial Center , also revealed how close Aristide has become with members of the Kennedy clan who took him under their wing in a Washington that was sometimes hostile . In his speech , Aristide said he has come_to address Ethel Kennedy , Robert F . Kennedy ' s widow , as &quot; Mom , &quot; and referred to her daughter Kerry Kennedy Cuomo as &quot; our dear Kerry. &quot; In a poignant , spiritual gesture , Aristide spoke_for several minutes directly to Malary : &quot; On Saturday , I will be in Haiti , but we will not be alone . We will be with you , &quot; he said , gazing straight ahead . &quot; We will build a state of law with you . We will build a new Haiti with you. &quot; Aristide also attended a gala reception at the Organization of American_States headquarters celebrating his restoration . Aristide ' s time during his last few days in America has been spent on substantive matters , Barnes said . &quot; He ' s in constant , round-the-clock meetings on the logistics of his return and the plans for his new government , &quot; Barnes said .</TEXT>
