   <HEADLINE> QUAYLE STRIKES BACK AT THE MEDIA ; STANDING_FIRM : A VICE-PRESIDENTIAL MEMOIR , BY DAN QUAYLE ( HARPERCOLLINS : $ 25 ; 336 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dan Qayle ' s &quot; Standing_Firm &quot; is a fine memoir : briskly written , closely argued , nuanced and persuasive . But reactions from the Beltway have been harsh . The politicos have damned Quayle for underscoring former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp ' s grandstanding and occasional public breaks from the Reagan_Administration ; and for hammering former Secretary_of_State James Baker for his handling of both Quayle ' s selection in 1988 and the entire Bush campaign . And there has been hand-wringing over Quayle ' s perceived play toward the Christian right . The former criticisms elevate some asides in the text to an undeserved prominence . The latter ' s just plain wrong . Quayle has , first and foremost , delivered a devastating indictment of journalism . It has teeth . It scores . It cannot , in fact , be answered . And in Round 1 of reactions to &quot; Standing_Firm , &quot; that indictment has been ignored . This happens to arguments that cannot be answered . Journalists , to an extent far beyond any other profession , suffer from a conceit about who they are and what they do . It is bred in their bones . They believe themselves to be gatekeepers , to be the elect , and the collective ego of the profession can only be compared to the hierarchy of the medieval church . They are the anointed , and it is their job to speak , yours to listen . This attitude condemned Quayle overnight , following his selection as Bush ' s running mate , and the machinery of the media then organized itself to confirm the initial snap judgment . Others could gaffe away , including Al Gore , who , without repercussion , once commented that a leopard could not change its stripes . The media ' s cheat sheet had judged Gore to be serious and thoughtful . Slips_of_the_tongue could be ignored . And they should be -- no public figure can avoid a stumble here or there . But for Quayle there would be no quarter given . The media coverage of the vice_president was more akin to surveillance . And when that surveillance yielded sound bytes supportive of the orthodox view , the gang retailed the clip over a_thousand outlets . To have spoken against this tide would have been courageous . And it would have been right . But courage and ethics are not much in_evidence among the exclusive club of opinion makers . Quayle ' s reputation was a sacrifice to this abandonment of independence . It ' s likely that some of the commentators didn ' t read the book , and went_on the air with a quick glance at the excerpts . That is standard_operating_procedure for folks from whom half-baked opinions are demanded on a weekly basis . But a larger share appear to have latched_on to the trivia in_order to avoid responding to the argument Quayle makes with a steady and finally overwhelming array of examples : The country ' s opinion aristocracy has become untethered from traditional notions of the media ' s role and its standards . This nation ' s media elite has abandoned the old virtues of journalism ; including objectivity , fairness , balance , context and -- critically -- any sense of relative import . Although Quayle does lay out cold some of his colleagues from the Bush campaign and the GOP , the biggest hits are not on other possible contenders for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 . Quayle instead strafes the growing legion of political apparatchiks , including consultants , pollsters and PR spinners . &quot; They ( have ) no ideology , &quot; Quayle comments . &quot; Their loyalty is to themselves. &quot; The list of names that comes_up for evaluation here is a who ' s who of opinion page experts . And , necessarily , Quayle does provide an estimate of the talent of the GOP ' s first string . The surprise is not that he found some to be incapable of delivering advice inconsistent with their own personal ambitions , but that so many potential rivals are given their due , including Dick Cheney , Colin Powell , Pete Wilson and Bill Bennett . Quayle ' s most complete portrait is of former Office of Management and Budget head Dick Darman . Quayle concludes that , on balance , Darman ' s strengths and contributions far outweighed his faults , a treatment that should stun the conservative faithful for whom denunciations of Darman are now the equivalent of Cato ' s call_for the destruction of Carthage . The political history that Quayle provides of the Bush years does add some critical insights , such_as the account of the December 1988 meeting , in which the future Secretary_of_the_Treasury , Nick Brady , campaign pollster Bob Teeter , James Baker and Quayle met with the president-elect to discuss deficit policy . Teeters ' contribution , that Bush would &quot; probably be going_to have to raise taxes , &quot; is for Quayle the first signal of the 1990 budget &quot; deal &quot; that would sink George_Bush ' s reelection . And Quayle ' s thoughtful reconsideration of the defeat of John Tower ' s nomination for Secretary_of_Defense is a crucial opportunity to reflect on what might have been had Tower not been denied . But Quayle ' s lasting contribution to the political literature is in the recounting of his four-year battle with the press . He does not grant his own record immunity . Every one of his gaffes is recounted in unsparing detail , including the &quot; defining moment , &quot; as Lee Atwater would have called it , involving the potato ( e ) . Quayle understood , it seems , that to critique the media would require an unflinching review of_his_own deposits in the media ' s vast reserves of anti-Quayle lore . And he practices a useful restraint . Where intelligence , balance and perspective were employed by one of the media ' s leading players , Quayle acknowledges the performance . He recounts , for example , Dan Rather ' s &quot; grasp of issues &quot; on the eve of Desert Storm : &quot; Rather threw all_of his political acumen into this conversation , raising possibility after possibility and I left glad that Saddam Hussein hadn ' t been able to overhear it , because had he followed Rather ' s line_of_reasoning he might have come closer to outfoxing us. &quot; In fact , unvarnished contempt for the ethics of individual journalists is rare in this memoir . Certainly the New York Times ' Maureen Dowd -- &quot; who ' s earned a reputation as the Princess of Creative Journalism . . . doesn ' t let the facts get_in her way . . . &quot; -- will find the book bracing , as will Sam Donaldson , Strobe Talbott , Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel , among others . But Quayle ' s argument is not so_much founded on the by-now cliched assertion that the elite media is &quot; liberal. &quot; Quayle levels far more serious charges : that media folks are lazy and , crucially , self-interested . At the highest level of the media food_chain , Quayle posits , there is an orthodoxy , a set of assumptions about people and policy , and to break_with that orthodoxy is to risk exile from the initiated ' s ranks . Unfortunately , orthodoxy forms quickly . The media ' s theology on Quayle was arguably cemented in place within 72 hours of his selection as Bush ' s running mate . Throughout the Bush years , very few of the opinion aristocracy were willing to break_with the pack with_regards_to Quayle ' s reputation . Three who did , Michael Barone of U.S. News &amp; World Report , and the Washington Post ' s Bob Woodward and David Broder , stood on such secure ground that they could afford to enter dissents to the otherwise solid wall of contempt for Quayle erected by our opinion barons . When Woodward and Broder committed themselves to an objective inquiry &quot; to find_out if Dan Quayle was qualified to be President and they answered yes , &quot; they did so on the reality of his centrality to the Administration and his substantial achievements in forums as varied as the Space Council and the regulatory watchdog unit run_by the Veep -- the Competitiveness Council . But their evolving evaluation of Quayle was ignored . The vast majority of opinion purveyors &quot; had invested too_much of themselves in the caricature , &quot; comments Quayle , and &quot; to change it now would have called into question their credibility. &quot; Perhaps Quayle is correct . Certainly he ' s right that the media ' s opinion of him could not be changed . But I doubt the issue was one of concern over credibility . I believe it was rather an overwhelming concern for their status within their peer_group . Only the most secure could cross the room and admit that Quayle had been the victim of a thorough bias . The vast majority huddled_together , secure in their giggles . &quot; He ' s the guy who tapped the keg , &quot; said one media friend of mine , in disbelief , on learning that I had found Quayle ' s book to be compelling reading . &quot; You don ' t believe he wrote it , do you ? &quot; Well , to the extent that any celebrity politician &quot; writes &quot; a book , yes , I do . I give Quayle the same credit for &quot; writing &quot; this book as I do Gore for his &quot; Earth in the Balance , &quot; or Mario Cuomo for his diaries . The same standard ought to apply . It is neither productive nor relevant to use &quot; Standing_Firm &quot; as a platform from which to speculate about who ' s up and who ' s down in the race for the Republican nomination in ' 96 . The book is , first and most importantly , an indictment of the elite media . It should be read for that reason alone . The book will not dent the opinion industry . As the chattering class has already demonstrated , Quayle ' s principal and principled arguments will not even be discussed . But the reading public ought to turn_off the background_noise long enough to judge Quayle and his book on_their_own merits , which are considerable . To do otherwise is to be led , and by a group of folks who may command attention , but cannot command respect .</TEXT>
