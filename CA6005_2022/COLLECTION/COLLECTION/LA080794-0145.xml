   <TEXT> There ' s shopping and then there ' s collecting . Fifteen years ago , Sydney and Audrey Irmas began shopping for the occasional photograph , initially influenced by their daughter , photo historian Deborah Irmas . After buying an 1862 albumen print by the eccentric Nadar , who photographed himself dressed in a fringed Native_American costume and wearing an 18th-Century-style wig , the couple decided to narrow their focus to self-portrait photography . It was the decisive moment that turned their shopping into collecting . They have since assembled a collection of approximately 140 works by artists as traditional as Edward Weston and as unconventional as Bruce Nauman , all revealing some unique aspect of themselves . The Irmases recently donated their collection to the L.A. County Museum of Art , where it will be presented as the exhibition &quot; The Camera I : The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Collection of Photographic Self-Portraits , &quot; opening Thursday . Spanning the last 150 years , the collection brings_together works both by unknowns and superstars , artists who use some aspect of photo-reproduction and commercial photographers , Americans and Europeans . And more women are included than in most institutional collections . This selection of self-portraits is remarkable in no small part for the surprises it may bring_to even the most seasoned observer of photography . As Deborah Irmas notes in her essay for the lavish book documenting her parents ' collection : &quot; We made many quixotic and idiosyncratic choices , records of the changes in our taste over time . . . . To choose freely , because of one ' s interest in an image , without pre-existing requirements , is often the most difficult of tasks. &quot; Deborah was still in graduate_school at Boston University when the collection was formally launched . Her parents relish the tale : Sometime around 1973 , Sydney remembers , when his daughter was home for Christmas vacation , she asked him to buy her a Karl Struss photograph from the Stephen White Gallery for $ 200 . The dealer would not sell the picture until the opening_night of the show , at which point Deborah would have returned to the East Coast . Sydney agreed and asked her to also pick_out a_few more photographs that he could purchase for himself . &quot; She gave me the numbers of the photos , &quot; recalls Sydney . &quot; I went_to the opening , made the deal , wrote the check . And I bought ( an image ) of Catalina Island because my family comes from there . ( Stephen White ) put red stars on the six things I bought . I figured I ' d better stay a little while , have a glass of wine . A man in an overcoat , hat and suit rushed in . He says to Stephen , ' My wife sent me out here to buy five photographs ! ' Well , they were the exact five Deborah had picked_out . &quot; ( The man ' s ) wife was a well-known photo dealer in New York . A few days later , I got a letter from her asking if we were willing to sell and for how much . At which point I got great respect for Deborah . &quot; That was Karl Struss ' first show at a gallery . He was 91 years old , but he was at the opening . We talked because he had been a cinematographer at the studios . I worked in the mail room at Fox when I was 17 years old. &quot; Laughing , Sydney adds , &quot; So we both came from a background in film. &quot; It was an auspicious beginning for the new collectors . The little-known Struss was soon discovered by the art world , and in no time his work increased in value by 200 % . But just collecting photography seemed too broad a mandate for the Irmases . Audrey says : &quot; I don ' t like pretty pictures . I tire of them easily . When it was first suggested that we collect photographs , I visualized Ansel Adams , and thought , ' I ' m not interested in that. ' Until we zeroed_in on the self-portraits . It was so interesting to see how different people are willing to reveal themselves . &quot; It was a lot of fun in the beginning because there was so_much material available . It was difficult toward the end to find things we didn ' t already have. &quot; Adds Sydney : &quot; Or that met our requirements of being vintage prints. &quot; Today , the Irmases live_in an expansive modern beach_house in Malibu , furnished by Mimi London with large-scale comfortable furniture . Glass walls reveal waves crashing outside . Inside is a single self-portrait photograph by the renowned German artist Joseph Beuys . Most of their photo collection is now at LACMA , and the walls of the house indicate the direction of their passion for contemporary art , with works by such artists as Barbara Kruger , Jenny Holzer , Eva Hesse , John Baldessari , Edward Ruscha and Malcolm Morley . A painting by Kenneth Noland hangs_in the hallway . Many other pieces are in storage awaiting completion of the couple ' s new home_in Holmby Hills . One work , featuring text on metal by Cady Noland , Sydney bought for personal reasons : It refers to Patty Hearst and her escapades with the Symbionese Liberation Army . Now retired from his practice as an attorney , Sydney defended Hearst in the L.A. component of the case . Visiting galleries and buying photography helped the Irmases develop their sensibility , and their avid interest in contemporary art brought them to a new association with the Museum of Contemporary Art , where Audrey is now a trustee . Paul Schimmel , MOCA chief curator , applauds the Irmases ' generosity to the institution , but notes that their photography collection belongs at LACMA , where it will be integrated with extensive existing photographic holdings . Robert A . Sobieszek , LACMA curator of photography , concurs : &quot; Fundamentally , their collection is the history of photography , from 1850 to the present , centered around a single theme -- self-portraiture and the artist . So it fits into our general collecting desire . It ' s almost as though we are collecting the same way they did -- wonderful 19th-Century pieces , modernism up_to the 1940s , with half the collection that is post-1940 . &quot; I think self-portraits , in whatever medium , are interesting , &quot; Sobieszek says . &quot; Psychology , temperament , biography , we are all fascinated by what goes_on in the mind of the creative_person . And it is good photography . The examples ( they ) collected are really remarkable . I don ' t know of any other collection in the U.S. or in Europe where a collector has amassed a collection of self-portraits. &quot; Although Deborah Irmas acted_as adviser at the outset , her mother became the primary force behind the collection . &quot; My mother has a good eye and likes classically beautiful things , &quot; says Deborah by phone from her home_in Paris . &quot; Once you let my mother loose , you cannot stop her . What ' s interesting is that they didn ' t really get any social credit for it , &quot; she continues . &quot; I was at parties at their house where people were saying , ' Why do they collect this stuff ? ' My mother was very sensitive to that and the fact that she continued to collect is to her -- to both of their -- credit. &quot; Hesitantly , the elder Irmases do take some credit . &quot; It ' s rewarding to know that what we ' ve been doing for 15 years is validated by others . It ' s pleasing to know you had an eye and went_down the right road . If you collect something , it should be what is pleasing to you , not to others , &quot; Audrey says . In the early 1970s , collecting photography did not have today ' s cachet . Nineteenth-Century photographs were especially abundant and , by today ' s standards , were reasonably priced . &quot; We made some wonderful buys and we made some mistakes , &quot; Sydney adds . For example , they thought their F . Holland Day photograph of a man in an Arab costume was a self-portrait and exceptionally rare , since most of Day ' s photographs were lost in a 1907 studio fire . After the donation to LACMA , it was discovered that Day had photographed a friend . &quot; We kept it for 15 years believing it was the creme de la creme of the collection , &quot; Sydney moaned . &quot; We were sold what we were told was a self-portrait by Baron ( Adolphe ) de Meyer . One day , ( the late photography collector ) Sam Wagstaff came_over and said , ' that ' s not Baron de Meyer . that ' s his chauffeur ! ' No matter how hard we tried to make_sure of what we were getting , mistakes happened. &quot; And miracles happened too . One day , two different dealers offered them self-portraits by the reclusive photographer Robert Frank . They managed to reach Frank by telephone and discovered these were the only two such prints in existence . They bought both . D ealers often called to offer them pictures . Robert Miller Gallery ' s Howard Reid tipped them off to the sale of the Diane Arbus self-portrait up for auction at Sotheby ' s . The startling 1945 black-and-white print shows the young photographer nude except for a pair of white cotton underpants , her belly slightly enlarged by her pregnancy , standing next to a view camera on a tripod photographing herself in a mirror . The image was made to announce her pregnancy to her husband , at the time a soldier stationed overseas . It was unique in Arbus ' oeuvre and certain to go above the auction_house ' s estimate . At auction , the Irmases watched other collectors bid up the price . &quot; Our strategy was not to bid , let others bid and see where it went , &quot; Audrey says . &quot; It more_than doubled in price , the bidding was so fast , and just as the auctioneer says , ' Is that it ? ' I shot in a bid . Everyone was so surprised that I got the piece for $ 20 # 000 . It was one of the most expensive ( of our collection ) . Within two months , I ' d been offered more_than $ 40 # 000 for it . &quot; I loved collecting photography , &quot; she adds . &quot; I really miss it. &quot; The Irmases decided to donate their collection to a museum in 1992 , after a scare from Westec private security officers . &quot; They called to say they felt the house in West L.A. was_on fire . The first thing I thought_about was the photo collection , &quot; Audrey recalls . &quot; They called_back and said the house wasn ' t on_fire , but I didn ' t want the responsibility after that . &quot; I wanted to share ( the collection ) , &quot; she continues . &quot; I wanted people to go see it . We always wanted it to be at LACMA because Syd was born ( in L.A. ) and I spent my whole life here . Our children and grandchildren are here for the most part. &quot; Sydney agrees . &quot; The incentive was the connection to L.A. , and a desire to have L.A. be the recipient of these pictures. &quot; Says Audrey : &quot; When Robert came and picked_up the photographs , I felt as though my children were leaving home to go_to college . I thought_of the many years I had devoted to them . Robert said , ' When the opening comes , it will feel as though they ' ve graduated.
