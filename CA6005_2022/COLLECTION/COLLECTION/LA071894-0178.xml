   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : WEIGHING SOFTWARE STOCKS ; AFTER THE MICROSOFT SETTLEMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After the federal_government and AT &amp; T announced their historic antitrust settlement late in the day Friday , Jan . 8 , 1982 , the lifting of that cloud was widely expected to re-energize the slumping stock_market the following Monday . Instead , investors ' excitement about a Bell System breakup and their relief that the government had concurrently dropped its antitrust_case against IBM Corp . were overcome by concerns about rising interest_rates . The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 16.07 points to 850.46 that Monday , even though AT &amp; T shares jumped $ 1.875 to $ 60.50 and IBM closed unchanged at $ 56.75 after trading as high as $ 58.75. The past weekend ' s landmark antitrust settlement between the Justice_Department and Microsoft Corp. , while not on the same scale as the AT &amp; T case , nonetheless has technology analysts using the same sort of language when they talk_about the potential fallout . They see a weight removed from Microsoft ' s shoulders now that the case is history , while at_the_same_time predicting a more level playing_field for the software giant ' s many competitors , including Novell Inc. , Lotus Development and Borland International . From the viewpoint of investors , guessing how the stocks will react today -- and picking the longer-term winners and losers based on the Microsoft settlement -- naturally is fraught with high risk . These are technology stocks , after all ; they are extraordinarily volatile and inherently speculative even without the government ' s hand in the marketplace . But given the sharp declines in most tech stocks over the past few months , while Microsoft shares have actually strengthened , the market backdrop suggests that a settlement that weakens Microsoft even marginally ( as this one purportedly will ) could hurt its shares_in the near term , while helping those of other software companies . Longer term , however , Microsoft is still the 800-pound gorilla in personal_computer software and potentially in the interactive electronic world that is evolving by the second . The payoff in dominating this new_world will certainly be measured ultimately in the billions -- in the number of users and the number of dollars of sales and earnings they will generate . The question isn ' t whether Microsoft is an attractive investment , but at what share price . Odd as it may sound , price was rarely a worry for Microsoft investors between 1989 and 1992 ; the stock closed each year far above the prior year ' s close as sales mushroomed thanks to the company ' s virtual lock on its markets . Here is a look_at some of the issues facing investors as they weigh the near-term and longer-term prospects for software stocks , in the wake of the Microsoft antitrust settlement . * For Microsoft ' s competitors : After battering many tech stocks in April , May and June on worries about slowing computer sales , investors just last week began to pile back into the sector , looking_for bargains . That change in mentality , coupled with the expectation that the Microsoft settlement will boost the prospects of some of its competitors , could give a further broad lift to tech shares_in the short run . Last week , bullish second-quarter earnings_reports from semiconductor giant Motorola , computer networker Chipcom and disk-drive maker Seagate Technology sparked a wave of buying_in the beaten-down tech area . Seagate stock , for example , rose $ 2.875 for the week , or 13 % , to $ 24.75 as the company ' s earnings_report helped allay some of the concerns about a slower economy translating into sharply lower computer sales , and thus lower earnings for tech companies . But on Friday , investors ' rising goodwill toward tech shares was deflated again , after semiconductor maker Texas Instruments warned that it indeed expects its growth_rate to slow in the second_half of the year . TI ' s stock tumbled $ 6.125 to $ 80.25 on Friday . Still , there ' s a reasonable argument that many of the software stocks , at least , have nowhere to go but up -- especially with an antitrust settlement that bars kingpin Microsoft from some sales practices that had clearly hurt its rivals . Novell shares , which have plunged from $ 26.25 earlier this year to $ 16.75 now , are trading for just 15 times estimated 1994 earnings per share . Yet Novell could be a big winner with its personal_computer networking systems , with Microsoft no longer able to bind computer makers to lengthy contracts that restricted their ability to use other operating software_systems . Microsoft ' s stock , in contrast , sells for about 24 times the $ 2 a share it is believed to have earned in the fiscal_year ended June 30 . Meanwhile , Lotus ' stock has been pummeled from $ 86.50 at its spring high to $ 39.625 now , in large part because the company warned in late June that it would n ' t meet analysts ' second-quarter earnings expectations . One of Lotus ' problems has been its inability to keep_up with Microsoft in desktop software development , especially for spreadsheet programs . If nothing else , the share price declines already experienced by Novell , Lotus , Borland and other Microsoft rivals this year may leave them less vulnerable than Microsoft to what is still the great market fear in the short term : that the U.S. economy will slow enough in the second_half to put a meaningful dent in the growth_rate of personal_computer sales . * For Microsoft : It remains to be seen whether Wall_Street will make any adjustments in its 1995 and 1996 earnings forecasts for Microsoft based solely on the antitrust settlement . But it ' s hard to imagine that any adjustments that might be made will be upward , rather than downward . No longer , for instance , will Microsoft necessarily earn a per-machine fee from major personal-computer makers even if they use a rival ' s operating system in their machines . While the early line from analysts over the weekend was that Microsoft ' s earnings won ' t be materially affected by the settlement ' s terms , an element of doubt has been injected into the immediate outlook . At the same time , of course , the simple fact that the settlement clears the air for Microsoft has some intangible value for the company and thus the stock . But unlike shares of Novell , Lotus , Borland and others , Microsoft ' s stock has been holding_up well in_advance of the settlement . At $ 48.625 , the stock is_well up from its 1994 low of $ 39 , though down from the high of $ 54.625. Part of the reason for the stock ' s relative strength this year was Standard &amp; Poor ' s Corp. ' s decision in the spring to add Microsoft to the S &amp; P 500 stock index . That sparked buying_in June by investors whose portfolios are set_up to mimic the S &amp; P 500 . That buying demand , however , should now be exhausted . Which leaves Microsoft investors dealing solely with the impact of the settlement , and with other fundamental issues . One continuing negative is the company ' s delay in introducing its long-awaited upgrade to its ubiquitous Windows software program , which runs_on an estimated 50 million personal_computers worldwide . The rollout for the upgrade , code-named Chicago , has been pushed from this spring to later this year . And rumors abound that Microsoft will announce at its annual meeting on Thursday that Chicago will again be delayed . With Chicago ' s problems and the antitrust settlement ' s apparent promise of a tougher competitive environment in the years ahead , Wall_Street may simply become much pickier about the valuation it affords Microsoft stock . How much is too_much to pay_for Microsoft ? If Wall_Street is correct in expecting earnings to advance about 20 % in fiscal 1995 , the stock ' s current price-to-earnings ratio of 24 means the shares are vulnerable to any disappointment . Still , there ' s also a good argument that the stock isn ' t dramatically overvalued today for long-term investors . This is still Microsoft , after all ; with its dominance in the personal-computer market , and the still-mushrooming nature of that market , Microsoft probably deserves a richer stock premium than its rivals for a simple reason : It can promise consistent , if slower , earnings growth in the years ahead , and consistency is increasingly a rare quality among technology companies . * MAIN STORY : A1 How Software Giants Stack Up How major software and computer networking stocks have fared this year , and the companies ' estimated sales and earnings per share ( EPS ) for 1994 .
