   <HEADLINE> AMERICAS SUMMIT ENDS ; CLINTON HAILS ' WATERSHED '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton and the leaders of 33 Western_Hemisphere nations concluded a weekend summit Sunday by signing a free-trade agreement that Clinton called &quot; a watershed in the history of the hemisphere. &quot; The leaders promised that the 32-page document , which agrees to create the largest free-trade zone in the world , will mean more jobs and prosperity for the region ' s citizens . &quot; Future generations will look_back on the Miami summit as a moment when the course of history in the Americas changed for the better , &quot; Clinton said in the closing ceremony of the Summit of the Americas at a downtown convention center , where he shared the stage with the presidents and prime_ministers of Canada , Latin_America and the Caribbean . Under the agreement , they resolved to begin building the Free_Trade Area of the Americas immediately and to conclude negotiations no later than the year 2005 . Countries or other regional trade groups will gradually be phased_in as their economies are ready to face competition . &quot; A key to prosperity is trade without barriers , without subsidies , without unfair practices and with an increasing stream of productive investments , &quot; the leaders said in their Declaration of Principles . After the summit ended , Clinton and the leaders of Mexico and Canada also invited Chile to join the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , a step intended to signal to other countries that they can be included once their economies are in good_shape . With the most well-ordered economy in Latin_America , Chile is expected to be able to complete the negotiations for entering NAFTA in about 15 months . While lavishing praise on the symbolism and promise of the summit , most officials acknowledged that Sunday ' s 34-nation pact is only the beginning of a long and ambitious process . Several said they hoped the fact that the United States sat_down with the rest of the hemisphere -- the first such meeting in 27 years -- signaled the start of a new relationship . &quot; This is the flight manual that will keep us busy for many years to come , &quot; Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria said . For the first time in history , &quot; Americans are really understanding . . . that they need us as much as we need them , &quot; said Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada . &quot; It ' s a sea change . . . . It ' s the first time we haven ' t come_to resist or to receive instructions. &quot; Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol said : &quot; Many people think to come_to the United States is to ask_for money , and many Americans think we come here to ask_for money . We came here looking_for business , investment and ( trade ) partners. &quot; For all_the upbeat talk , there were words of caution about the difficulties of ultimately phasing_in the free-trade zone , which will encompass 750 million people and goods and services worth more_than $ 14 trillion . It requires a number of countries to reform sluggish economic_systems , reduce high tariffs , eliminate subsidies and set_up legal mechanisms to guarantee property_rights . Furthermore , there is some question about how receptive the U.S. public -- which in large_numbers turned against Clinton and the Democratic leadership in midterm elections -- will be toward the expansion of commercial ties with Latin_America . &quot; The public is not ready for a free-trade agreement with Latin_America , &quot; said Mark B . Rosenberg , acting dean of urban and public affairs at Florida International University and an expert on Latin_America . &quot; In the post-Cold War environment , they don ' t understand what the dominant values are . The pace of change is so rapid , and Americans are very insecure. &quot; And smaller countries fear being left_out or put at a disadvantage . Prime_Minister Owen Arthur of Barbados cautioned that the coming &quot; tide &quot; of free_trade could be dangerous for Caribbean_island nations if special measures are not taken_to prepare their economies and give their products a share of the hemisphere ' s market . &quot; A rapidly rising tide can and does overturn small_boats , especially small , unbalanced boats , &quot; Arthur said . &quot; The Caribbean has small , unbalanced economies. &quot; Clinton and other leaders emphasized that the new economic partnership is aimed at creating employment and income by increasing the exports of all participating countries . Clinton claimed that 100 # 000 jobs have been added in the United States because of the year-old NAFTA . Bolivia ' s Sanchez de Lozada expressed optimism that more trade will mean development and employment in his country , the poorest in South_America . &quot; What we were talking_about at this summit was jobs , &quot; Sanchez de Lozada said . He said that while Clinton was &quot; obviously talking_about American jobs because he ' s got_to win an election , &quot; the United States must also buy more imports from Latin_America if the partnership is to work . In Sunday ' s closing summit ceremony , Clinton gave Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide a place of honor , inviting him to be the final speaker . Aristide , making his first trip to the United States since U.S. troops restored him to power Oct . 15 after three years in military-imposed exile , used his speech to effusively thank Clinton and the other leaders for their support . Aristide , speaking in French , English and Spanish , invited Clinton to visit Haiti . While much was said about trade at the summit here in balmy Miami , the participants failed to take significant action on some of the most serious festering problems in the Americas , such_as illegal drug trafficking and human_rights . In the documents signed Sunday , the presidents and prime_ministers agreed to &quot; encourage &quot; legislation that would freeze and confiscate assets produced by the laundering of drug money , estimated to be a $ 300-billion business . But the measure was watered_down from an earlier proposal that would have required such legislation . In addition , a tough U.S.-sponsored plan for cracking_down on drug production and smuggling never made_it to the final documents after Colombia , Bolivia and Peru objected . Human_rights activists complained that the summit , by concentrating so heavily on trade , ignored abuses that continue to go unpunished in Latin_America , still a violent region despite the end of most wars . &quot; The summit participants have sent precisely the wrong signal to human_rights abusers in the region -- that they can continue to get_away with murder , &quot; Jose Miguel Vivanco , director of the Americas division of Human_Rights Watch , said in a statement . Vivanco noted that summit participants pledged to strengthen judicial_systems to fight administrative corruption -- not to bring human_rights abusers to trial . Sanchez de Lozada said the summit declarations did not mention the Communist government of Cuba and the U.S. embargo against the island because of disagreement among the leaders on how to press for Cuban democracy . But Cuba was brought_up again and again in the summit ' s private discussions . Some leaders , including those of Mexico and Brazil , oppose the U.S. embargo and advocate dialogue with President Fidel Castro , who was not invited to the summit . Argentine President Carlos Menem supports the U.S. embargo . Guido di Tella , the_Argentine foreign_minister , said that if the summit had tried to reach agreement on Cuba , &quot; there would have been an impasse. &quot; The entire Declaration of Principles and Plan_of_Action signed by the 34 leaders was negotiated in_advance by lesser officials . The presidents and prime_ministers made no changes in the documents presented to them for signature . &quot; They went_over it very thoroughly but didn ' t change a word , &quot; said Charles Gillespie , the State_Department ' s chief negotiator for the summit . As a result , the contents are sometimes bland or vague where some would have preferred stronger language or more specific commitments , such_as in the area of drug trafficking . &quot; Drugs , like Cuba , is an area where we really don ' t have an answer , &quot; Sanchez de Lozada said . * FALLING TRADE_BARRIERS : Summit lays_down a challenge for the global economy .
