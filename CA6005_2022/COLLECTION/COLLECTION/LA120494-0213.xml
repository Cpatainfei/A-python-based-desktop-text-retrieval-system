   <HEADLINE> OPERA AT WARP SPEED ; IT ' S NOT THE NUDITY , ROUGH SEX OR A RESISTANCE TO NEW IDEAS THAT MAKE ' ROSA ' AND SIMILAR WORKS CONTROVERSIAL -- IT ' S THE WAY MUSIC MEETS THE STAGE , CREATING A NEW KIND OF OPERATIC EXPERIENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last month Netherlands Opera offered the world_premiere in Amsterdam of a new opera , &quot; Rosa , &quot; a collaboration between Holland ' s best-known composer -- aggressive minimalist Louis Andriessen -- and iconoclastic British filmmaker Peter Greenaway . On the surface there seems nothing particularly remarkable about that fact . New operas are presented all_the time these days . Also any number of major film directors , including Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman , have been drawn to the lyric stage . The opera , however , proved a sensation , generating a considerable wave of international attention , and even managed to somewhat scandalize the generally sophisticated Dutch audiences . Artistic directors from both the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Lincoln Center went_to Amsterdam to hear it , and a question much asked_in operatic circles_around New York these days is whether &quot; Rosa &quot; could possibly be performed in America , given the current political attitude toward what is and is not appropriate in art . It ' s not just that &quot; Rosa &quot; contains a fair amount of nudity and rough sex . That kind of thing , while perhaps not commonplace , does find its way , now and then , into mainstream opera_companies . Angelenos may remember Maria Ewing ' s strip in &quot; Salome &quot; at the Music Center , and the same soprano is currently at the Metropolitan Opera titillating audiences with her provocative lustiness in some soft-core Shostakovich , a new production of &quot; Lady Macbeth of Mtsenk. &quot; Nor is it potential audience resistance to new work . That seems to be something nearly forgotten . Even the major American opera_companies , which traditionally had been far less inclined to produce new work than many of their European counterparts , have been enjoying remarkable success with new operas in recent years , albeit conservative in tone and style . In fact , three seasons ago , when the Met staged John Corigliano ' s &quot; The Ghosts of Versailles , &quot; its first premiere in a quarter-century , the company found itself with an instant hit , so_much so that the company made a sudden decision to televise it , and now the opera is returning this season . Nearly as popular have been William Bolcom ' s &quot; McTeague &quot; in Chicago two years ago and , earlier this season , Conrad Susa ' s &quot; Dangerous Liaisons &quot; in San Francisco ( which already has been televised ) . Houston Grand_Opera thrives on regular doses of opera that is of our time . No , what makes &quot; Rosa &quot; shocking is that it really offers something new in opera . Although perfectly accessible , it is altogether different in the way it uses music and the stage , in its very conception of opera , from these other new audience-pleasing operas . Nor is &quot; Rosa &quot; alone . This season there have been other new operas -- Robert Ashley ' s four-part &quot; Now Eleanor ' s Idea , &quot; the conclusion to a 20-hour mega-opera ultimately intended for television in its final form ; Philip Glass ' &quot; La Belle et la Bete , &quot; a curious opera literally performed to the classic Cocteau film ; John Moran ' s authentically weird TV-age &quot; Mathew in the School of Life , &quot; and Tod Machover ' s high-tech extravaganza of opera as magic act for Penn &amp; Teller -- each in some way radically reinventing opera for our age and perhaps the future . In some cases -- actually in most cases -- they hardly look or sound like opera at all . With the exception of &quot; Rosa , &quot; they are not intended for the traditional opera_house , the traditional opera conductor , the traditional opera singer or the traditional opera-goer . ( And &quot; Rosa &quot; pretty much wreaks havoc with most of those traditions. ) * Indeed , these new operas are more likely to play to other sensibilities and at other venues , to be suited more for adventurous audiences and alternative spaces . ( Machover ' s opera had its premiere at the Media Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ) Whereas an opera like &quot; The Ghosts of Versailles &quot; is opera about opera and its conventions , these new operas are about life and culture as they exist today . They acknowledge the fact that everyone goes_to movies and watches television and that , in the age of multimedia , we are beginning to process information , audio and visual , very differently than we did_in the past . They are works that contend that opera itself must change , and because of them it surely will . Media and technology are the key elements that tie all these operas together . But that is nothing new for operatic progress . Opera has always responded to the changes in the other arts and culture in_general , as well as_to the advancements of technology . One could , for instance , study the evolution of the art_form as related to the development of stage lighting -- from the way flickering candlelight reflects elaborate Baroque ornamentation to the influence greater lighting possibilities had for Wagner ' s concept of opera as total artwork to the effect Robert Wilson ' s intense luminosity had_on Philip Glass ' early operatic work . Since film and television are the common_denominators of our culture , they are also inescapable in the latest opera aesthetic . In &quot; Rosa , &quot; for instance , Greenaway , who wrote its libretto and directed and designed it , has taken the interaction between film and music theater to a new level , and then from there all_the way over the top . Not only does the opera use actual film as an integral part of its narrative , but the opera is also structured like a film , lasting the typical unbroken two-hour length of a film . There is even a staged bit resembling the credits at the end of a movie . More remarkable , still , Greenaway , who is also a visual artist , employs here the whole range of his obsessions , obsessions that would seem realizable only on the screen . The work is based upon the murder of an obscure Brazilian composer , Juan Manuel de Rosa , who had studied seriously in Paris but wound_up in Uruguay writing music for Hollywood Westerns and was found shot in an abandoned abattoir in Fray Bentos . As Greenaway envisions the crime , Rosa , captivated by the Western films he scores , is shot by two cowboys in the film as he projects it . As anyone familiar_with such Greenaway films as &quot; The Cook , the Thief , His Wife &amp; Her Lover &quot; will by now have already suspected , &quot; Rosa &quot; is quite a nasty piece_of_work . Rosa is infatuated with his horse , which he keeps housed in a treadmill contraption . Rosa ' s fiancee , Esmeralda , spends most of the opera nude , paints herself black to look_like a horse and does a lot of neighing . In the end , she is stuffed into Rosa ' s horse , the composer ' s dead_body draped over it , and set_on_fire in what just might be the most malevolent immolation scene in all_of opera . Predictably , Greenaway ' s vision gets most of the attention in the theater . But what really makes &quot; Rosa &quot; so shocking ( movies , after all , commonly display worse ) is that &quot; Rosa &quot; is opera . While the artifice of the stage is always apparent , there is something absolutely devastating about the fact that those are opera singers , singing , while doing -- or being the victims of -- the unspeakable acts onstage . &quot; Rosa &quot; is a genuine opera . Andriessen ' s score is forceful , intricate and angry , and it doesn ' t loosen its grip upon the listener for a second . But the relationship of music to the staging is a radical one . While the strong score drives the drama and has its own integrity , it also inevitably functions , under such extreme circumstances , as a heightened soundtrack , and its ambiguous nature produces an altogether new kind of operatic experience . Glass ' &quot; La Belle et la Bete &quot; -- which recently completed a European tour and will have its American premiere on Wednesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music ( with an eventual American tour , although no dates or cities have yet been set ) -- also takes its originality from reinterpreting the relationships between music and film . Here , Glass has simply set an opera to Cocteau ' s screenplay , using singers and his ensemble players performing live to a screening of the film , turning the movie into an opera it had never intended to be . * This too alters our perception of opera in several different ways at_the_same_time . It obviously changes the film dramatically , removing not just Georges Auric ' s original score but also the actors ' voices . It adds that special heightened effect that live music , synchronized to film , can have . But the very nature of the project also profoundly influenced the kind of music Glass wrote , since his vocal lines had to be designed so that they could fit the delivery of the actors on the screen . The final result is supposed to make the original actors now seem like singers . And so the music itself becomes not exactly recitative but not song either . It is a paradoxical kind of singing that is entirely artificial in its relationship to the film ( where one expects speaking ) , yet far less artificial than typical operatic singing since the rhythm and pacing of the vocal lines are so closely tied to the pacing of speech . That fascinating area between speech and song is the most spectacularly and thoroughly investigated in Robert Ashley ' s operas . These operas are , in fact , one great opera , &quot; Ring &quot; -sized in_length and as elaborate a narrative . Their subject_matter , however , is the utterly mundane . Their characters are bank tellers and lowriders and various other unlikely operatic subjects . But their highly stylized texts , in which the mundane becomes poetry , are presented in an incandescent , trance-inducing manner that transforms all it touches into a sort of futuristic chant . Ashley ' s vocal style is a unique sung speech . Singers are given certain harmonic areas and key pitches , occasionally melodies , but the singer also participates in creating his or her own vocal line and style . The &quot; orchestra &quot; is a richly and subtlety textured background blend . Voices often intertwine , with each other and with melody , with chant and with speech . The four final operas in the project , the collective &quot; Now Eleanor ' s Idea , &quot; conclude a trilogy that began with &quot; Atalanta &quot; and &quot; Perfect Lives &quot; ; they may be performed live , as they were in an elegant , static staging at BAM last month , but are ultimately intended as an epic , serial television opera . Only the seven short &quot; Perfect Lives &quot; operas have been made as video thus far , but there is every indication that when the project is completed it will be the Joycean epic of the new video age . John Moran , a young composer and protege of Philip Glass , also transforms television images into opera but in a far less elegant , more Generation X manner . He has already , before turning 30 , produced an opera based on &quot; The Jack Benny Show &quot; and one on the life of Charles Manson that was originally also to include characters from &quot; Hawaii Five-O &quot; ( until CBS refused him permission ) . They are operas that were written not for opera singers but for a theatrical troupe , the Ridge Theater . The musical voices are usually electronic . A favorite effect is the use of spoken voice ( often from television ) electronically altered and then repeated over and over , as the actors too repeat their motions . * In &quot; Mathew in the School of Life , &quot; Moran , who plays Mathew , is a robotic creature who it seems is_on his way to something messianic . ( The first of its three intended parts had its premiere at the alternative space the Kitchen in October. ) So completely strange is the effect of the electronically produced score , with its constant allusions to popular culture , and this virtuoso troupe of faux opera characters , that it gives the impression of watching an entertainment from another planet . And yet , while there is not one aspect about Moran ' s work that one could call traditionally operatic , there is the curious sense , in watching it , that it could be nothing but opera . Compared to such experimentation , Tod Machover ' s opera for Penn &amp; Teller is little more_than a Las Vegas stage act , and that is where it will surely wind_up , when the magicians ultimately incorporate it into their regular repertoire . Penn &amp; Teller do actually sing some lines but nothing you ' d actually want to hear . Penn produces a pained kind of rock ' n ' roll recitative , accompanying himself on his electric bass , while the usually silent Teller is an even more pained mysterious voice of Houdini from beyond the grave . Yet this opera had its premiere in October as part of a prestigious and influential symposium offered by the Media Laboratory at MIT . Participants ranged from Laurie Anderson to Sony Chief_Executive_Officer Michael P . Schulhof to National Endowment for the Arts Chairman Jane Alexander . Even Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) dropped_by on a campaign stop . The audience seemed to include just about every CD-ROM developer in the country . Machover , a prominent composer at the Media Lab who organized the symposium , is one of the most interesting and inventive composers using new media -- his concerto for hyper-viola ( an electronically extended instrument ) was performed two seasons ago by the Los Angeles Philharmonic . For this occasion he , with the help of his engineering colleagues , created a sort of throne that made music just by having someone wave an arm in the vicinity , something that inspired great histrionics from Penn . * The significance of this opera is not just that it was seen , and rapturously enjoyed , by many of the people who will be responsible_for the vessels culture comes_in in the future but that Machover could actually create an opera -- and one that had interesting music produced by the goofy machine that completely upstaged the amusing performers -- intended to be part of a pop nightclub act . For Machover , this was nothing more_than a bit of good-natured slumming . He is a serious composer who has written a short , captivating opera based upon Philip K . Dick ' s visionary science-fiction novel &quot; Valis &quot; and is now developing a new opera in collaboration with Peter Sellars . He is a highly versatile composer who seems to be able to incorporate Boulezian complexity and rock ' n ' roll in his work . One of the most sophisticated composers working with technology today , he is part of a research organization with backing from the leaders in the media industry . Opera , thanks to Machover , has a place in that corporate technological view of the future . He even heads what is called Opera of the Future Group . But while that is only one vision of the future , the implications are clear . Opera is an art_form that is rushing into the future maybe faster and more aggressively than any time since Wagner proclaimed his the future . And , although you won ' t find it in the big opera_houses yet ( Houston Grand_Opera had originally commissioned the Machover-Sellars project , then backed_down ) , the future is already here with some important and potentially lasting new work .</TEXT>
