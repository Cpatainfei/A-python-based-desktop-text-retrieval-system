   <HEADLINE> MCMAHON LIFTS VIKINGS INTO PLAYOFFS ; PRO FOOTBALL : HE SPARKS 14-9 VICTORY OVER REDSKINS TO REACH POSTSEASON PLAY WITH HIS THIRD TEAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jim McMahon is back in the NFL playoffs . And this time it ' s the Minnesota Vikings he ' s taking with him . McMahon ' s 11-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Carter was just enough to beat the Washington Redskins , 14-9 , Friday and assure the Vikings a playoff spot for the second consecutive year under Coach Dennis Green . &quot; Jim is the guy who somehow finds the way to get the job done , &quot; Green said . &quot; They did a great_deal of blitzing . When they ' re pressuring you a lot , you ' re not going_to make a lot of great plays , but he had some nice throws. &quot; The Vikings ( 9-7 ) will likely face the loser of Sunday ' s Dallas-New York Giants game in a wild-card matchup . A loss Friday would have given New Orleans or Philadelphia a chance of taking the berth away from Minnesota . The 34-year-old quarterback , who took Chicago to the playoffs three times in the ' 80s and went there with Philadelphia three years ago , was 19 of 32 for 225 yards , enabling the Vikings to close the regular season with three consecutive victories for the first time since 1974 . &quot; It ' s a good feeling , a lot of people counted us out , &quot; Carter said . &quot; You want to play your best football in December . Hopefully , we can keep this going. &quot; For the Redskins ( 4-12 ) , it was a sorry end to their most dismal season in three decades . For the third time in four games , they failed to score a touchdown . The only question left is whether rookie Coach Richie Petitbon will keep his job a second year . The Redskins ' only scores were_on field_goals of 37 , 35 and 34 yards by Chip Lohmiller , who missed on two other attempts from 35 and 53 yards . The sole bright note for Washington was rookie running back Reggie Brooks , who rushed for 68 yards , giving him 1 # 063 for the season . McMahon found Carter open in the end zone with less than a minute remaining in the third quarter for what proved to be the winning touchdown after putting the Vikings into scoring position four plays earlier with a 30-yard pass to Cris Carter at the Redskin one . &quot; I missed some open guys . . . . but I really felt_like we made the big plays when we had to , &quot; McMahon said . &quot; Of course they had eight or nine guys on the line every play . Now it ' s a one-game season and anything can happen. &quot; The two Carters combined with McMahon for a total of 176 yards on 13 completions after the Redskins shut_down the Vikings ' running game , holding Scottie Graham to 37 yards in 20 carries . &quot; It ' s nice to have him back there , &quot; Cris Carter said of McMahon , who has thrown six touchdown passes in the Vikings ' last three games . &quot; He doesn ' t get flustered . He came_out in the third quarter and put_together a good drive that put us up by more_than a touchdown. &quot; Cris Carter caught a 24-yard pass at Washington ' s one in the second quarter to set_up Minnesota ' s first touchdown . The Vikings went_into a hurry-up offense 90 seconds before the half , but it backfired when McMahon , throwing from his 33 for Steve Jordan , was intercepted by Redskin linebacker Monte Coleman . A 14-yard return by Coleman set_up Lohmiller ' s first field_goal .</TEXT>
