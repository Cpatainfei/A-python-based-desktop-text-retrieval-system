   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN REBELS REJECT PEACE PLAN ; LATIN_AMERICA : ACTION BY INDIANS SPOTLIGHTS POTENTIAL FOR INSTABILITY AS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION NEARS . BUT BOTH SIDES INSIST THEY WILL HONOR CEASE-FIRE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Indian rebels overwhelmingly rejected the Mexican government ' s peace proposal , saying that it does not fulfill their political , economic and social demands , but both sides rushed to provide assurances Sunday that resumed fighting is unlikely . The rejection puts the government in a tight spot two months before the Aug . 21 presidential elections . Despite a 6-month-old cease fire , the rebellion -- which began New Year ' s Day in the southern state of Chiapas and left at least 145 people dead -- is a sign of continuing potential for instability in a country whose leaders have tried to portray it as an emerging economic force . The rebellion is a reminder of the impoverished rural communities that have been left_out of Mexico ' s widely acclaimed economic modernization . It is also a reminder that Mexicans might seek to express their will if the party that has ruled Mexico for 65 years tries to maintain control through vote fraud . Rebel leaders had hinted earlier that the proposal , made in March after nine days of negotiations , probably would not be acceptable to the rank-and-file members of the Zapatista National Liberation Army . A Zapatista delegation signed the proposal on the condition that its final approval was subject_to a vote of everyone who supported the insurrection , the estimated 3 # 000 fighters as well as about 20 # 000 suspected civilian supporters . After a complex consultation process , nearly 98 % of those voting rejected the proposal , according to three rebel communiques dated Saturday . Fewer than 4 % of the voters said they wanted to resume combat , and the communiques said the Zapatistas would fight only if attacked . The government responded by trying to allay fears . President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said in a statement that the Mexican army will continue to observe a cease-fire in_effect since Jan . 12 . Peace envoy Manuel Camacho Solis returned immediately to Chiapas to try to reopen peace talks . Rebels said they wanted a broader , national coalition to discuss issues that they say are important across Mexico . For that reason , they rejected the continuing intermediation of Roman_Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz . &quot; Unfortunately , the historical shortsightedness of the supreme government prevents it from seeing that failure to submit to the drive for democracy will bring painful confrontations with predictable consequences for the nation , &quot; one of the rebel communiques stated . In an earlier interview , rebel spokesman Subcommander Marcos had said that the Zapatistas have received letters of support from Indian and human_rights groups throughout the country and that they would like to include those groups in future talks . After they briefly invaded several county_seats near the Guatemalan border_on Jan . 1 , the rebels presented a list of 10 areas of contention : work , land , housing , health , education , independence , liberty , democracy , justice and peace . They then withdrew into a despoiled area of the Lacandon Rain_Forest . The government replied with a 32-point plan that largely ignored demands for democracy , liberty and justice , focusing_on economic issues in the area under rebel control . Separately , Mexico ' s three major political_parties negotiated a political and electoral reform package . The Zapatista delegates explained the government proposal during a long meeting in four indigenous languages with representatives of villages under their control . The representatives then took the proposals to their villages for a vote . Reporters were allowed to watch the first phase of the consultations but could not be present for the voting in the villages . The rebels also said that they will allow voting in August in the areas they control , which is roughly 17 % of one Mexican congressional_district , in a sign that they expect the renewed talks to drag_on through the presidential election . But it was not clear whether voting would be legal there because the deadline for picking_up voter credentials was Sunday and citizens in rebel territory have been unable to get credentials . Election officials had said earlier that they probably will call a special election in that district .</TEXT>
