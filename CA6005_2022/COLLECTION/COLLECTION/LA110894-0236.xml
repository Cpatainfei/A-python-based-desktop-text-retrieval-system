   <HEADLINE> TECHNOLOGY BEHIND OUR ANGST , FUTURIST SAYS ; COMMUNICATIONS : AMERICAN SOCIETY IS UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE CHANGING FROM AN INDUSTRIAL TO AN INFORMATIONAL SOCIETY , TOFFLER SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The paradox of the 1994 election -- that voters are grumpy and pessimistic despite the nation ' s strong and growing economy -- comes from the uncertainty people feel about the change to an information-driven society , futurist Alvin Toffler said Monday . That uncertainty is not likely to end soon because few of the nation ' s leaders understand what is happening , Toffler said at a conference of technology and media industry executives . He noted the simultaneous troubles the United States and other industrial nations are having in their justice , health , education , urban and family systems , all_of which were adapted more_than a century ago for the era of mass production . None are ready for the change away from mass production and distribution of goods , services and information , Toffler said . &quot; Most politicians rail against this or that crisis without understanding the larger crisis that these are all parts of , &quot; he said . Toffler ' s books call the move to the information age the &quot; third wave &quot; in history . &quot; Why are we so worried ? The reason is the old industrial-style systems are crashing and the new third-wave social and political structures are not yet in place , &quot; Toffler said . Focusing_on communications , Toffler noted that the systems used in agrarian society , the &quot; first wave &quot; in his model , were inadequate for the industrial age , or &quot; second wave. &quot; Now second-wave systems are trying to adapt for the third wave . Among the weaknesses companies are trying to fix in communications : inadequate interactivity , inadequate mobility , inability to simply convert information between text and speech , and poor access around the globe . But as that transition happens and gets a lot of attention , Toffler said , politics is being quietly divided between people committed to second-wave civilization and others ready to move to the third . &quot; One is tenaciously dedicated to preserving the core institutions of industrial mass society , including the nuclear_family , mass education system , giant corporations , mass trade_unions , centralized nation-state and politics of pseudo-representation , &quot; Toffler said . &quot; The other recognizes that most of today ' s urgent problems -- energy , poverty , ecological degradation and breakdown of familial relationships -- can no longer be stopped within the framework of industrial civilization. &quot;</TEXT>
