   <HEADLINE> NETWORKING AMONG REBEL GROUPS TROUBLES MEXICAN GOVERNMENT ; REVOLT : CHIAPAS REBELS ' CALL TO ARMS IS ANSWERED BY A SHADOWY PEASANT UNION THAT HAS OPERATED IN COUNTRY FOR TWO DECADES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Southern Mexico ' s Indian rebels did not have to wait long for a reply to their call early this month for other organizations to join their struggle : The next night , a car_bomb exploded in a shopping_center here . The rash of subsequent bombings and bomb threats in the capital and other cities bore the mark of the Revolutionary Worker Peasant Union of the People Party-Party of the Poor , a shadowy urban_guerrilla group that has operated in the country for the two decades since the last rural insurgents were destroyed . The peasant union is the patriarch of the country ' s guerrilla groups , descended directly from the schoolmaster-turned-rebel-hero Lucio Cabanas , who led the army on a seven-year chase through the_hills of southwestern Mexico until he was killed in December , 1974 . Since then , the peasant union has pulled_off sporadic feats of urban terrorism , such_as the bombing of IBM Mexico headquarters and a McDonald ' s restaurant two years ago , providing a constant reminder that Mexico may_not be quite as stable or as friendly to foreign capital as its leaders portray their country to be . The emergence of the Zapatista National Liberation Army in Chiapas , on the southern border , is a call to arms for the peasant union and other rebel groups , suspected to be scattered throughout the country . Reports of armed groups have grown frequent in parts of Hidalgo and Veracruz in the east , as well as Oaxaca and Guerrero in the south , states with traditional ties to the peasant union ' s urban_guerrillas . Many of those rural bands are thought to be defense groups that Indians and peasants formed to protect themselves against gunslingers hired by local ranchers . The independent news weekly Proceso reported that last spring , 80 people from the town of Paso de Aguila on the Tehuantepec Isthmus in the south bought guns and took_to the_hills . Gunmen from a local ranch ransacked the Indian village four times in four months , convincing townsfolk they had to defend themselves . A little farther north , the Eastern Mexican Democratic Front Emiliano Zapata -- named for the same revolutionary hero the Chiapas guerrillas chose to honor but otherwise seemingly unrelated to them -- has also taken_up arms . &quot; For more that 40 years , we asked_for help from the Agricultural Reform authorities without getting a solution , &quot; representatives of the group wrote in a letter to Amnesty International . &quot; For that reason , we decided to form an independent organization to defend the interests of our people. &quot; The group claims to have recovered more_than 80 # 000 acres -- communal lands they accuse rich ranchers of having stolen . These kinds of organizations can easily switch from defensive to offensive tactics , fast becoming guerrillas , said Jose Luis Moreno , a researcher at the Center for Studies of Armed Movements , a small think_tank of former rebels who study Mexico ' s resistance movements . &quot; If people are being killed , they organize to defend themselves , &quot; he said of the armed peasant groups . He suspects that the Zapatistas in Chiapas began as a self-defense group and then turned_to aggression when they grew frustrated that their peaceful protests brought no results . Moreno and his colleagues at the center are clearly impressed by the size and discipline of the Zapatista forces . &quot; It goes_for beyond anything we were ever involved in , &quot; said Moreno , who served two years in prison for his participation in kidnapings and bank robberies when he was part of the Sept . 23 League , a guerrilla organization . His sentence was cut_short by a 1977 amnesty for rebels . Experts at the center also said they were impressed by the ties_in other states , besides Chiapas , that allowed the Zapatistas to claim responsibility for destroying two electrical towers in central Mexico . The networking among rebel groups appears to be among the biggest worries for the Mexican government as it awaits the Chiapas guerrillas ' reply to proposals for peace talks . According to reports from the Interior Ministry , the peasant union and the Zapatistas already are in contact with each other , raising the threat of a network of violent underground groups that could disrupt the country indefinitely . The peasant union is the product of a merger between urban and rural guerrillas . After the army killed Cabanas , a group of his followers led by his brother , David , went underground . They were committed to continuing the struggle but had lost both their tactician and commissar when Cabanas died . &quot; It was a difficult period , mainly because nearly all_of us lacked a theoretical base , &quot; David Cabanas said in a 1991 jailhouse interview . By 1976 , the Cabanas group -- the Party of the Poor adjunct to the organization ' s name -- had made contact with the peasant union . It was founded in 1964 from the remnants of a guerrilla movement in the northern border state of Chihuahua , and in the 1960s and early 1970s was another set of initials in the alphabet soup of rebel movements that robbed banks and kidnaped politicians and industrialists throughout Mexico . But shortly before contacting the Party of the Poor , the peasant union hit on a strategy not previously tried in Mexico : the war of attrition . &quot; Their trademark became bombings , &quot; Moreno said . Shopping_centers , banks and government_offices were the usual targets . Then there was the statue of the soldier in a prominent intersection of Guadalajara . The group would bomb the concrete statue , leaving the figure crooked . City officials would restore it and a_few months later , the guerrillas would bomb it again . Moreno and his colleagues tell this story with humor but stop short of discounting the group as a force . &quot; Their practices are different from what we attempted , the creation of an army , &quot; Moreno said . &quot; The truth is , they are into their strategy and we are out of circulation. &quot; Laughing_at the urban_guerrillas , or even criticizing them , is dangerous . In 1984 , Francisco Fierro Loza won third prize in a contest for essays about the history of the state of Guerrero . His theme was the Party of the Poor . In July of that year , he was found murdered . A communique from the peasant union stated that he had been &quot; judged &quot; for falsehoods . Three years ago , two security_guards at the left-leaning newspaper La Journado died when a bomb delivered by peasant union partisans exploded . Interior Ministry officials refused repeated requests for interviews or information about the urban_guerrillas . As for the peasant union , no one is sure how large or how strong it is . &quot; That is part of the advantage in being clandestine , &quot; Moreno said . What is certain is that authorities have consistently underestimated the urban_guerrillas . The government has declared the group vanquished various times : when David Cabanas was arrested in 1990 ; after Felipe Martinez Soriano -- the former rector of the University of Oaxaca , who denies any ties to the group -- was imprisoned as the mastermind behind the deaths of the newspaper security_guards . Each time , the guerrillas have staged another assault . The group has attacked police_stations to steal arms or planted another of its trademark bombs . After this month ' s bombings , eight people were arrested , all_of whom deny membership in the group . Proletarian , the group ' s newspaper , which is distributed secretly at centers such_as public universities , also denies that the jailed suspects are guerrillas . In a measure of how the government is now treating rebel groups , though , after the latest bombing arrests , officials offered no new claims of having destroyed the peasant union . &quot; There are still a lot of people underground , &quot; said Moreno , who noted that poverty and desperation encourage others to join armed movements , whether in the_hills or cities . &quot; To the extent that people propose change peacefully and change does not come_about , &quot; he said , &quot; armed struggles will erupt -- as_many times as is necessary. &quot;</TEXT>
