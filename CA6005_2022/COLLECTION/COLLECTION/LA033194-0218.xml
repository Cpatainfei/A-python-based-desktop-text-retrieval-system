   <HEADLINE> DOG KILLING BRINGS TERM OF 60 DAYS , PROBATION ; COURTS : FULLERTON MAN WHO TAPED ANIMAL ' S MUZZLE TO QUIET BARKING MUST ALSO BUY_FOOD FOR DOGS OF AIDS SUFFERERS AS PART OF COMMUNITY SERVICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Fullerton man who pleaded no contest to charges that he killed a neighbor ' s dog by taping its mouth shut was sentenced Wednesday to 60 days ' confinement and ordered to make restitution by buying_food for dogs owned by people with AIDS . Municipal Judge Richard E . Behn also sentenced Robert Steven Sakall , 39 , to 250 hours of community service and three years of probation . The community service should be related to the care of animals , Behn said . Sakall ' s confinement might be served at_home because he has spinal injuries , the judge said . As part of Sakall ' s community service , the County Probation Department recommended that he pay $ 25 a week for three months to the AIDS Services Foundation , which , among other programs , helps people with AIDS take_care of their pets . Behn approved the idea . &quot; I have a dog . . . . If I lost him , I don ' t know how I would feel , &quot; Behn told Jeff and Debbie Hutchison , Sakall ' s neighbors , whose 5-year-old golden_retriever died . &quot; I have great sympathy for you. &quot; Sakall did not attend the sentencing because of extreme back pain , said his attorney , Robert Tuller . &quot; Mr. Sakall is extremely distraught , &quot; Tuller said . &quot; He was heartsick when he found_out that the dog died. &quot; Tuller said in court that he and his client have received death threats since Sakall was charged with the crime . Sakall pleaded no contest in February to charges of animal cruelty . Sakall told Fullerton police investigators that the animal ' s barking gave him painful headaches , and that he meant to quiet the animal , not kill it , by taping its muzzle , according to police . Tuller told the judge that his client was injured at_work and has been housebound for the last two years from pain . Numerous surgeries have done nothing , and now Sakall cannot sit or stand , but must remain lying_down , Tuller said . Even so , Behn called the muzzling of the dog &quot; mean-spirited. &quot; The dog died because it was unable to pant to release heat . Its temperature rose to 108 , according to a veterinarian who examined the dog . The Hutchisons said after the sentencing that their children are still upset by the loss of the family dog , named Dylan . Jeff Hutchison said his children have asked him , &quot; ' If we get a dog again , can we get one that doesn ' t bark , Daddy ? ' &quot; The Hutchisons have said that Dylan was never noisy and suggested that Sakall may have killed the wrong dog . Another neighbor has a German_shepherd that could have been the irritant , they said . Assistant Dist . Atty . Mary Anne McCauley said she was pleased with the sentence . She said she will ask the Probation Department to make Sakall serve his 60 days in jail rather than under electronic_surveillance at_home . Sakall was ordered to report to County Jail on May 18 . He also must pay $ 500 restitution for the dog and $ 213.75 for emergency medical fees , in addition to buying dog_food .</TEXT>
