   <HEADLINE> U.S. DRAFTS OPTIONS TO AID BOSNIA ARMY ; BALKANS : CLINTON_ADMINISTRATION COMPLIES WITH CONGRESSIONAL ORDER . BUT IT CITES RISKS AND COSTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration has complied with Congress ' order to draft options for arming and training Bosnian government forces , but it warns that carrying_out the proposal would be risky , costly and almost certain to jeopardize ties with major U.S. allies . The scenarios , outlined in classified briefings with leading lawmakers this week , call_for the United States to lift the current arms embargo unilaterally , to arm and train Bosnian government soldiers and to help evacuate allied troops now on peacekeeping duty in Bosnia-Herzegovina . But officials have warned that the operation would require a substantial U.S. air campaign , to protect Bosnian forces during training , and the deployment of thousands of American ground troops , with a risk of widening the ground war to many_more civilians . The cost could run as high as $ 4 billion , Administration officials said . They also have cautioned that any unilateral lifting of the arms embargo would so anger major U.S. allies -- such_as the_British , French and Dutch , who together have 19 # 000 ground troops in Bosnia -- that U.S. planes might not be allowed to use North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization bases . The Administration consistently has opposed any unilateral lifting of the arms embargo or outside training of Bosnian troops . But that position has been popular among lawmakers , many of whom are frustrated with the war and want to strengthen Bosnia ' s government forces , which are largely Muslim . However , officials said President Clinton may be hard-pressed to avert such a move after Republicans take_control of Congress in January . GOP lawmakers have been among the most vigorous proponents of lifting the embargo unilaterally . Under legislation passed earlier this year , Congress gave Clinton until Nov . 15 to persuade the U.N. Security_Council to lift the embargo multilaterally . If the world assembly refused , the law required Clinton to cease using U.S. military_personnel to help enforce the restrictions . The law also required him to submit detailed plans for lifting the embargo unilaterally and for training Bosnian government troops outside Bosnia , where they are subject_to the U.N. embargo . Unable to get the 15-country Security_Council to lift the embargo , Clinton issued orders last week prohibiting U.S. military_forces from helping to enforce the embargo . But he said the United States would continue to abide_by its terms and not sell arms to the Bosnian government troops . Defense_Department and intelligence officials flatly denied a report Thursday from Europe suggesting that the United States has been sharing satellite photos and other intelligence with the Muslim-led government following Clinton ' s decision to stop enforcing the embargo . The report , contained in the European , a London-based weekly newspaper , said that small teams of CIA operatives are working in Bosnia to train soldiers in military operations , provide them with satellite photos and control air traffic . The options the Administration outlined to lawmakers this week involved essentially two alternative approaches : One would be to pour enough tanks , artillery and weapons into Bosnian government hands to give its army the same level of equipment as the Bosnian Serbs . The alternative would be to concentrate_on exploiting government forces ' current advantage in manpower over the Bosnian Serb rebels by equipping them with more antitank weapons , rocket-propelled grenades and small arms to create a more effective infantry force . Depending_on the approach , U.S. officials said that arming the Bosnian government could cost between $ 500 million and $ 4 billion . And the move would bring_on a spate of problems : * Training the Bosnian forces fully would require a transitional period of a year or more , during which time they almost certainly would come under stepped-up attacks by the Serbs -- which the United States would have to counter with a substantial air campaign . * As soon as the United States lifted the embargo , Britain , France and the_Netherlands would pull their peacekeeping troops out of Bosnia . Since Washington is committed to helping to evacuate them , Clinton would have to send_in thousands of U.S. troops . * Without U.N. peacekeeping troops on the ground , any U.S. warplanes sent to protect Bosnian government units would be forced to operate without the help of forward air observers , making their bombing less accurate and more likely to hit civilians . * Renewed attacks by the Bosnian Serbs would widen the war to endanger more civilians than are being killed now and could well bring_in neighboring countries such_as Serbia and Croatia and even the major_powers . Separately Thursday , the State_Department said that unidentified gunmen in Sarajevo fired shots into the rooms of U.S. Ambassador Vic Jackovic at the Holiday Inn motel but that Jackovic was not in the room . A State_Department spokesman said there is no reason to believe that Jackovic was the target of the attack . The Bosnian presidential offices in Sarajevo also were attacked by a wire-guided missile Thursday , leaving two people wounded , wire_services reported .</TEXT>
