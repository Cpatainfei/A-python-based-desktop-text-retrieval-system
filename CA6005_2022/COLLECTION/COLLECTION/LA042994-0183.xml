   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN LEADERS SIGN ' CIVIC ACCORD ' AS RESPITE FROM STRIFE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Arrayed at a gleaming Kremlin table that seemed to be the size of a football_field , everyone who is anyone in Russia ' s political and social leadership turned_out Thursday to sign a &quot; civic accord &quot; meant to give the country a two-year break from strife . &quot; Russia is weary of torrents of mutual insults from various rostrums , of endless clashes in the media , &quot; President Boris N . Yeltsin told the gathering . &quot; We do not want verbal wars to turn_into street clashes and mass unrest. &quot; It remains to be seen whether the civic accord , on which Yeltsin has focused much of his energy in recent weeks , will actually keep any of its signers from striking , arguing or fighting in the streets as it is supposed to do . Other pieces_of_paper , like the constitution and the legal_code , have not . The best that could be said for the agreement signed Thursday was that Yeltsin actually managed to gather such an array of leaders -- from ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky to free-market economist Yegor T . Gaidar -- to sign it . Holdouts remained , among them the leader of Russia ' s Communist_Party , who attended but did not sign , several regional chiefs and leaders of the Agrarian and reformist Yabloko factions of Parliament . None of the hard-core opposition to Yeltsin , including former Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi , attended . The more_than 200 individuals who did appear included representatives of groups such_as the Union of Women of the Russian Navy , a union of private_detectives and two groups of Cossacks . But even those who might have been some of the greatest enthusiasts of the accord took the grandiose ceremony with some skepticism . Gaidar , now leader of the pro-Yeltsin Russia ' s Choice party , admitted that &quot; I have never had any illusions that one document , however serious it was , could solve the serious problems in Russia . However , at least there will be a basis for transforming political confrontation from its current uncivilized nature to a more civilized one. &quot; Zhirinovsky , in typical fashion , made a joke of the whole_thing . He told reporters on his way to the ceremony that he would decide whether to sign based on whether Yeltsin smiled at him . Diners at the post-signing banquet quipped back that they were treated to Zhirinovsky-brand vodka , with a map on its label of Russia expanded to the old borders of the Soviet_Union . Russian regional leaders appeared unimpressed with Thursday ' s pact . &quot; Who is arguing against accord ? Accord can be achieved only by real deeds , &quot; said Aman Tuleyevm , a leader of the government of Kemerovo in Western Siberia . &quot; Unfortunately , ordinary people downstairs will not feel better because ( leaders ) here signed something on paper and kissed each other. &quot; Boris G . Fyodorov , the former Russian finance_minister , put it even more bluntly : &quot; The more we sign various documents on accord , the more rows we will have. &quot; Thursday ' s proceedings began with a moment of silence for a lawmaker killed by a shotgun blast earlier this week in an apparently mob-related murder . The uproar in Parliament on Wednesday over the death threatened briefly to spoil the ceremony for the accord . But lawmakers contented themselves with their still-unsatisfied demand for Yeltsin to fire his interior minister for allegedly failing to crack_down sufficiently on organized_crime . Yeltsin chaired the ceremony and emphasized in his speeches that Russia cannot afford violent discord when it is in the midst of sweeping economic and political changes . &quot; We want peace in Russia , we want the strengthening of our united democratic state , &quot; he said . The accord , as he presented it , appeared to be his way of trying to guarantee that nothing like the clashes of last October -- which began after he dissolved the old Parliament and ended with his ordering the storming of the rebels holed_up in the Russian White_House -- would ever be repeated . Instead , it seemed to be drawing the battle_lines all_over again . Rutskoi , released from prison under last month ' s amnesty , has announced that he hopes to lead the opposition to Yeltsin and said he would use the accord to determine who his allies are . &quot; I will see who signs it , who voluntarily puts a muzzle on himself , &quot; Rutskoi told NTV last Sunday . &quot; And I will try to unite those left without a muzzle. &quot; The text of the accord , which was still being changed as late as Wednesday night , requires those signing to refrain_from calling_for early federal elections or proposing consitutional amendments that could destabilize society . They also pledge to keep rallies peaceful . The government , in turn , promises to lower inflation , improve taxes , pay overdue salaries and raise living standards . Unions vow not to organize strikes to squeeze more money out of the government . Regions promise to send taxes to Moscow more regularly . A reconciliation commission is created to oversee how the treaty is carried_out . Its continued last-minute metamorphosis reflected the great political pressures on Yeltsin stemming from Communists who wanted more mention of the gap between rich and poor , regional leaders worried about Moscow keeping its hands off their local laws , and others . The treaty appears to lack any teeth at all , providing_for no sanctions against those who violate the accord after signing it . It also remains open indefinitely for more people to sign .</TEXT>
