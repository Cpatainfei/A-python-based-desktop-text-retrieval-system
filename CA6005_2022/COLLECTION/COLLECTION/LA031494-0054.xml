   <HEADLINE> BOSNIA MUSLIMS , CROATS AGREE ON A CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Croats and Muslims announced agreement Sunday on a 52-page constitution for a new federation they hope to create from the war-ruined regions they hold_in Bosnia-Herzegovina . But in recognition that they can move no farther on_the_road to an overall peace settlement without the cooperation of Bosnian Serb rebels , the two factions that until a week ago had been battling each other conceded that the thorny details of their state-building will have to be postponed . The U.S.-mediated peace talks that have been taking_place at the American Embassy here for the last 10 days will move to Washington later this week for a ceremony to mark what both Bosnian parties emphasized is only a first_step in resolving the bitter conflict that has ravaged the former Yugoslav federation for the last three years . The U.S. special envoy for the Balkans crisis , Charles E . Redman , said the constitutional agreement will be signed_in Washington on Friday . &quot; It has been very successful this week , &quot; Redman told journalists shortly after the constitutional talks adjourned late Sunday . &quot; The next stage is to talk to the Bosnian Serbs to try to agree on an overall settlement. &quot; The pact setting_out a governing framework for the Bosnian federation being reconstructed by Croats and Muslims calls_for a strong central government , a presidency , a prime_minister , a federal legislature and an unspecified number of cantons that would be largely self-governing , Redman explained . But he brushed_aside questions about the number and shape of the cantons as secondary details , making clear the most divisive territorial issues remain to be worked_out . U.S. officials seeking to broker a reconciliation of Bosnia ' s warring factions announced in Washington on March 1 that Croats and Muslims had agreed to end the clashes that have ravaged central Bosnia for the last year . The agreement included a commitment to build a binational federation within the Bosnian territory that the two parties had been apportioned during a year of European-mediated peace talks in Geneva . Those negotiations sought to deed 17.5 % of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Croats , who make_up about that share of the republic ' s population , and 33.5 % to the Bosnian government , representing the Muslim Slavs -- about 44 % of the republic -- as well as several hundred_thousand citizens of other ethnic_groups who are still committed to a multicultural society . However , a large segment of that combined 51 % of Bosnian territory remains under Serbian occupation . Asked how much the success of the new Croatian-Muslim federation depends_on cooperation from the Serbs , Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic replied : &quot; A lot. &quot; Both Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic , representing the leadership of Croatia , which hopes to eventually forge an economic union with the new Bosnian federation , emphasized that the constitutional deal was only the beginning of a long process . &quot; Let ' s hope that this will be the first major step_in the peace agreement , &quot; Silajdzic said . Redman sought to portray the Vienna meetings as a breakthrough in the conflict that has inflicted the worst killing and displacement in Europe since World_War_II . &quot; It ' s been hard work , but from start to finish it was conducted in an excellent atmosphere , &quot; the U.S. envoy said of the constitution drafting . But he said further work_on territorial questions and the eventual Bosnian-Croatian alliance would have to wait until the Bosnian Serbs make their position clear . That third and most heavily armed faction in the 2-year-old Bosnian war has shown little interest in joining any common state with the Muslims and Croats , which may complicate the other parties ' attempts to forge a new state for themselves . Russia ' s special envoy for the former Yugoslav republics , Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S . Churkin , has also embarked_on what Western diplomats see as a two-pronged effort to restore peace in the Balkans , with the United States using its influence with the Croats and Muslims while Russia takes_advantage of its traditional ties with the Serbs . Redman and Churkin met in London last Friday to confer on the next steps of the East-West peace initiative , before Churkin traveled_to Sarajevo to assess the prospects for getting the Bosnian Serbs involved in the new federation-building process . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has warned that the Muslim-Croatian deal appears aimed at isolating and pressuring his rebels into giving_up territory they have taken , and the president of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament , Momcilo Krajisnik , dismissed the idea of a new federation as &quot; illogical. &quot; But under pressure from Churkin , the Serbs last month agreed to withdraw or surrender heavy_weapons that had been bombarding Sarajevo for 22 months and to allow Tuzla airport to be reopened for a humanitarian airlift .</TEXT>
