   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : LA PALMA ; MEASURE TO REIN IN TOBACCO PUT ON HOLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s not up in smoke , but a proposed city ordinance controlling tobacco products is nonetheless back in the carton . The City_Council Tuesday night unanimously voted to defer action on the ordinance until after the Nov . 8 election . Some on the council said uncertainty about a statewide initiative , Proposition 188 , figured in their decision . Proposition 188 , supported by the tobacco_industry , would overturn both the recently passed state law regulating smoking and would also negate all existing city ordinances controlling tobacco products . Councilman Larry A . Herman said that until voters decide the fate of Proposition 188 , the long-range ability of cities to regulate smoking is uncertain . &quot; We ' re in a kind of limbo , &quot; Herman said . &quot; We don ' t know what the future holds. &quot; Councilwoman Eva G . Miner , who introduced the anti-smoking ordinance , was among those voting to delay action . But later , in an interview , she said she voted to defer the ordinance only because she saw no support for immediate passage . &quot; We can always bring this ordinance back for action , &quot; she said . &quot; In the meantime , we ' re going to work in La Palma to educate people about Proposition 188 and to urge them to vote against it. &quot; Miner ' s proposed anti-smoking ordinance , among other things , would outlaw cigarette vending_machines . She and other anti-smoking advocates said that juveniles have easy access to vending_machines and thus can illegally purchase cigarettes . Councilman Duane F . Schuster told the council Tuesday night , however , that he had made a citywide survey and found only one business that has a cigarette vending machine . Maybe others don ' t have vending_machines now , Miner retorted , &quot; but they could in the future. &quot; No one in the audience at the meeting spoke against the proposed anti-smoking ordinance . Phillip J . Falcetti , a specialist with the Orange County Health_Care Agency , urged the council to pass a city ordinance that controls the machines . Falcetti said juvenile health is in danger because of easy access to cigarettes . BILL BILLITER</TEXT>
