   <TEXT> Occasional thundershowers and gray skies turned Memorial_Day somber in Orange County , discouraging attendance at local parks and beaches on the first holiday of the season . &quot; We had thundershowers coming and going , &quot; said state lifeguard Randall Roberts , who spent Monday at Bolsa Chica State Beach . &quot; But it really didn ' t stop all_the crowd from coming_out . &quot; People that made their plans to come here before the weather turned overcast seemed to follow_through on them , &quot; said Roberts , who estimated that 12 # 000 to 15 # 000 people visited the park Monday . With light surf , average crowds and weather described by some as &quot; yucky , &quot; lifeguards had a relatively easy day . Stingrays stung a_few swimmers at Bolsa Chica , and lifeguards made only five water rescues by 5 p.m. at Huntington State Beach , state lifeguard Jim Balok said . &quot; It was sunny for a little while , and rainy , and overcast , and windy , and not windy , &quot; Balok said . &quot; You name the weather , we had it today. &quot; Recreation officials at Carbon Canyon Park in Brea reported a moderate crowd , with people showing_up for picnics and softball and volleyball_games . Officials closed the park to vehicles about 10 a.m. after running_out of parking_space . It was reopened to cars at 3 p.m. Attendant Ray Davis at Ronald W . Caspers Regional Park said many people visited the park east of San Juan Capistrano for barbecuing and horseback_riding . Others visited the 7 # 600-acre park to hike on its more_than 30 miles of trails . &quot; We had between 50 and 100 wilderness permits issued today , &quot; Davis said . &quot; that ' s quite a_few -- on a typical weekend day , probably 20 or 30 are issued. &quot; Many Orange County sheriff ' s deputies reported to extra duty at two county parks Monday . Extra deputies were deployed at Mile Square Regional Park in Fountain Valley and Irvine Regional Park in Orange -- which were both filled to capacity -- but they saw limited action , Sheriff ' s Lt . Jay Mendez said . &quot; We only had one medical call , &quot; Mendez said . Overall , he said , &quot; It was a family-type atmosphere. &quot; Parts of the county were misty throughout the morning , but only one location -- El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station -- reported rainfall . El Toro had a trace amount of rain by 5 p.m. , according to Curtis Brack , a meteorologist with WeatherData , which provides forecasts for The Times . Laguna Beach had the lowest daytime temperature in the county , reporting a high of only 74 degrees , Brack said . Santa Ana had the county ' s high at 84 degrees , with humidity ranging from 66 % to 84 % . &quot; that ' s fairly muggy , &quot; said Brack , who attributed the conditions to a surge of tropical moisture from offshore . Weather_forecasters had expected that disturbance to move toward the coast today , not Monday . The moist , gray skies lent a solemn air to midday memorial ceremonies held at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana . Santa Ana ' s Saddleback High_School band played for about 2 # 500 visitors to the park , along with a men ' s choir and barbershop quartet , mortuary clerk John Aguilera said . Representatives of the armed forces stood before a looming white mausoleum , accompanied by a color_guard , and told seated guests about the sacrifices of military veterans , he said . Cemetery grounds were covered with U.S. flags , and cemetery employees were dressed in clothes evoking memories of the late 1800s and early 1900s , Aguilera said . &quot; We only had a_few drops of rain , &quot; Aguilera said . &quot; It was not hot , it was not cold -- it was just the right feel. &quot;</TEXT>
