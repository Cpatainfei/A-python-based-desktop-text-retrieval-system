   <HEADLINE> 7 ISRAELIS KILLED IN SUICIDE BOMBING ; MIDEAST : CAR DRIVEN BY PALESTINIAN EXPLODES NEAR BUS PICKING_UP STUDENTS , INJURING 45 OTHERS . EXTREMISTS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPARENT REPRISAL FOR HEBRON MASSACRE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A car packed with high_explosives , nails and propane gas driven by a Palestinian suicide bomber exploded near a commuter bus Wednesday as it stopped for students in northern Israel , killing at least seven Israelis as well as the car ' s driver and injuring 45 others . The attack was apparently a reprisal for a Jewish settler ' s massacre of about 30 Palestinian worshipers in Hebron on Feb . 25 ; it was timed to coincide with the 40th day of Islamic mourning for those killed in the Cave of the Patriarchs . Israeli police said Hamas , a radical Palestinian fundamentalist group , claimed responsibility for Wednesday ' s explosion , which sent pieces of the bus , car and their occupants flying dozens of yards in the sleepy blue-collar town of Afula . Witnesses described a horrible scene . The blast left its young victims mangled and burned , and a square_block was strewn with bodies and parts of bodies . The brutal incident shocked Israel on the eve of its annual Holocaust commemoration . Wednesday night at the Holocaust Museum here , Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin did not comment on the attack at ceremonies marking the day Israel has set_aside to recall the killing of 6 million Jews by Nazi Germany . But President Ezer Weizman declared : &quot; Today , on the eve of the Holocaust memorial_day , we paid a heavy price for being Jews , for working to live a peaceful life in the land of Israel . The long , historic cycle of blood continues . . . and this criminal act of terror took_place as the hope and expectations for peace are standing at the gate. &quot; Other Israelis expressed deeper anger at the bus bombing . At the blast scene in Afula , some chanted &quot; Death to Arabs. &quot; There were dozens of angry protest rallies across the country by opposition groups -- unprecedented on a day that Israel sets_aside for its Holocaust remembrance and quiet reflection . Wednesday ' s attack provoked fears of new retaliation and shook the peace process that has fueled escalating violence by extremist groups on both sides . As right-wing Jewish settlers staged demonstrations Wednesday night to protest both the attack and the Israeli government ' s decision to continue negotiating with the Palestine Liberation Organization over Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories , Israeli army and police officials braced for more bloodletting . All roads into Afula were closed . Israeli police and army reinforcements were rushed to nearby Arab towns . Police evacuated all Arab workers who were in Afula at the time to protect them . The army and police clamped more security measures on Israeli-occupied territories , already sealed_off after the Hebron massacre as a precaution against revenge attacks . Speaking amid the wreckage at the site of the noon bombing , Police Minister Moshe Shahal insisted that nothing could have prevented the attack . He said the massive police reinforcements and security precautions in place for the past month have prevented &quot; a big part of the intended ( revenge ) attacks. &quot; Police and army officials have said armed Palestinian fundamentalist and extremist groups vowed to retaliate against the Israelis for the Hebron killings , which Israel ' s government has blamed on a lone madman . But Rafi Peled , Israel ' s police_chief , said he will take even stricter measures in the territories , including barring all cars from the area entering Israel -- even with special permits -- for at least a week . Police said the car used in Wednesday ' s attack -- a light-blue Opel Ascona sedan with Israeli license_plates that didn ' t belong with it -- was stolen in Tel Aviv on March 23 . Investigators speculated that the vehicle was smuggled into the territories and kept there until Wednesday , when it crossed back into Israel from the northern West_Bank . The savagery of the attack in Afula -- a town hit in the past by Palestinian terrorists operating across Israel ' s more porous northern border with the occupied West_Bank -- brought calls from the Israeli opposition for suspension of negotiations with the PLO . Formal talks between Israel and the PLO reconvened in Egypt last week for the first time since the Hebron massacre . ( Those sessions were adjourned Wednesday until Sunday as Israeli delegates insisted on making a scheduled departure for Holocaust commemorations at home. ) Many Israelis were incensed that PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat , in Cairo for consultations on the autonomy talks , had not condemned the assault . The United States , which decried the attack , urged him to do so . &quot; The government ' s policy of nonstop concessions to the PLO and terrorism only brings us more and more terrorism , &quot; declared Benjamin Netanyahu , Likud Party chairman and leader of Israel ' s political right , which has opposed the Palestinian autonomy plan since its signing in Washington last September . &quot; The government should stop the peace talks immediately. &quot; He and other opposition leaders directly linked Wednesday ' s bombing to the return to the Gaza Strip and Jericho less than 24 hours earlier of 50 Palestinian deportees -- engineers of the intifada , the Palestinian uprising , and key activists of Arafat ' s Fatah wing who had been expelled years ago as suspected terrorist leaders . Their dramatic re-entry , a key concession by the Israeli government , was among the first real signs of change in the occupied lands , and it fueled hopes among many Palestinians and Israelis of an imminent agreement on Israel ' s long-delayed promise to withdraw its troops and allow Palestinian autonomy beginning in Gaza and Jericho . But Netanyahu observed , &quot; On the day that this government brings_back deported terrorists comes this despicable , murderous attack in Afula. &quot; Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , chief architect of the &quot; Gaza-Jericho first &quot; agreement , deflected the criticism and rejected calls to suspend the peace process . &quot; We know that there are people who want to murder peace , who want to kill Jews , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s no relation between the two . And I don ' t believe the Likud or anyone else can stop the flow of history. &quot; There were strong condemnations of the attack from PLO officials in the occupied territories . Diab Alouch , head of Arafat ' s information department in Gaza City , condemned Hamas , the group that claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement from Jordan , in a telephone_call to a Western news_agency in Jerusalem and through loudspeakers of mosques in the Gaza Strip . &quot; Personally , as a Palestinian , this hurts me , what happened in Afula , &quot; Alouch said . &quot; It also hurts me what happened in Jabaliya ( where six Arafat activists were slain by an Israeli undercover unit last week ) and what happened in Hebron . Everything I hear about killing and the spilling of blood always hurts me. &quot; Eyewitness accounts of the attack on the Eged Bus_Lines commuter coach as it made its second stop on Route No . 438 at 12:10 p.m. Wednesday were chilling enough to shock even people who have lived through this region ' s cycles of violence . A nearby school had just ended classes for the day . Young Jewish students streamed toward the approaching bus for home . Suddenly , the light-blue Opel , which had been parked not far away , blew_up . The explosion shook the town . &quot; When we arrived , the mushroom_cloud of smoke was still in the air , &quot; said a firefighter who was the first on the scene , which he described in vivid , gruesome terms . He said the street was covered with oil , seared metal and nails , which police said were packed in the car_bomb to maximize its effect . As of late Wednesday , police said they had managed to identify just four of the seven dead Israelis : the bus_driver , two 17-year-old girls and an Arab woman from a nearby village . The identity of the suicide bomber has not been confirmed . A caller -- who said that Hamas was responsible_for the attack -- identified the car ' s driver as Raid Zakarna , 19 , from a village just across the Green Line from Afula in the West_Bank . The caller said the car contained almost 400 pounds of explosives . Military sources confirmed that Zakarna was_on an Israeli army list of fugitive members of Hamas ' extremist armed wing , the Izzedine al Qassim Brigade . Police said they found a banner denouncing the peace process and a Koran , the Islamic holy book , near the debris of the car .</TEXT>
