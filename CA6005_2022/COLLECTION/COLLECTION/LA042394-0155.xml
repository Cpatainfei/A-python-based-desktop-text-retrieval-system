   <TEXT> As the stench of raw sewage wafts over her home , Grace Phaka knows exactly what she wants when the long-dreamed-for day of liberation finally arrives here on the edge of South_Africa ' s oldest black township . &quot; A real toilet , &quot; she said firmly . Then she points to the outdoor tap that she and her husband share with 20 other families . &quot; And clean water. &quot; Their house is a two-room shanty with no windows , across from a weed-filled graveyard used as a trash_heap and dumping ground for outhouses . &quot; We want to leave the shack and get proper housing , &quot; she declared . Then there ' s her hope of finding a job , learning to read , getting electricity , leaving this grim squatter camp and finding a better life . &quot; There ' s no clinic , there ' s no school , &quot; the shy 31-year-old woman added softly . &quot; Is that possible ? &quot; The possibilities -- and more importantly , the needs -- seem endless here in Alex , as Johannesburg ' s only official township is called . An estimated 350 # 000 blacks are crammed into a kilometer-square warren of tiny homes and hovels , many living in medieval squalor , less than a mile from the city ' s most opulent white suburbs . Hidden from whites behind an imposing fence dubbed the &quot; Berlin Wall , &quot; violent crime and unemployment are soaring . Tuberculosis and other infectious_diseases are endemic . Schooling has largely collapsed , and hundreds of families have lost loved ones to factional fighting in a neighborhood so bloody it is called &quot; Beirut. &quot; Alex is a microcosm of black South_Africa , so what happens here will be key to judging the success or failure of the policies of Nelson Mandela ' s African National Congress if , as expected , that party sweeps the national and provincial elections next week to become the first black-led government in the nation ' s troubled history . Many blacks have great expectations , while many whites have great fears . Balancing the two may be Mandela ' s biggest challenge , especially since the odds for success , some say , are slim . The ANC plans an ambitious program of reconstruction and development aimed at areas such_as Alex . Over the next five years , according to the latest draft of a still-evolving agenda , the ANC promises to build at least 1 million houses with sanitary facilities , electrify 2.5 million homes , create 2.5 million jobs in a public works program , and provide children with free health_care and 10 years of free compulsory primary schooling , among other pledges . Trevor Manuel , the ANC ' s chief economist , puts the cost of the five-year program at about $ 11.5 billion , with a target of $ 2.6 billion the first year . But he promises the money will come from squeezing savings and redirecting existing allocations in the $ 34-billion annual budget rather than from raising taxes or borrowing money . &quot; You don ' t need higher taxes , &quot; he said . &quot; You don ' t need an increased budget . You need far greater efficiency in the way money is spent. &quot; Manuel argues , for example , that the new government can slash the $ 3.1-billion defense budget . Other savings can be found , he said , by consolidating the 14 education_departments set_up under apartheid . &quot; You need a single education_department , &quot; he said . Another target , he said , is $ 1.1 billion in what he scorns as &quot; apartheid infrastructure , &quot; including lavish embassies maintained in London and Paris by the now-defunct homeland of Bophuthatswana . &quot; We don ' t say we can solve all this overnight , &quot; Manuel added . &quot; But these are reasonable targets. &quot; Many economists , business people and diplomats , however , are dubious . Even ANC supporters fear that the program is more a wish list of social goals than a hard outline of budgets and schedules . &quot; The price_tags are something short of meaningless , &quot; said a sympathetic Western economist here who has studied the ANC proposals . &quot; It ' s difficult to see how all this is going_to happen , partly because the ANC has not spelled_out how it ' s going_to happen . . . . There is no real economic data on what each program will cost , let alone whether it can be carried out. &quot; Skeptics warn that much of the promised post-apartheid savings may be as elusive as the so-called peace dividend has been in the United States since the end of the Cold_War . Defense cuts here , for example , will be partly offset by training , outfitting and deployment of the new 4 # 500-member National Peacekeeping Force , the new army of former black guerrillas and South_African soldiers . And efficiencies may be elusive . For example , the new country will have nine provinces , not four , so an infrastructure to support new capitals and departments will be required . The ANC has repeatedly pledged to pay salaries and pensions for the 1.7 million civil_servants , as well as create 2.5 million jobs . Then there ' s the party ' s commitment to affirmative_action . So cutting payrolls will not be easy . Derek Keys , the finance_minister in the lame-duck government of President Frederik W . de Klerk , warns that the ANC program is &quot; not responsible &quot; and can ' t be achieved in less than 10 to 15 years . The Development Bank of Southern Africa has given a similar assessment . &quot; There certainly will be a great many very disappointed people , &quot; Keys said . &quot; The delivery system will not be adequate. &quot; Last year , for example , the government built about 20 # 000 low-cost homes -- far fewer than its budget called_for -- blaming violence in the townships . Building 10 times that number each year will not be easy , even if peace breaks_out . For one thing , not enough contractors and builders exist in the townships today . Electricity may be the easiest service to deliver . The country has a surplus , and Eskom , the self-financed national utility , has said providing power to 2.5 million homes is possible providing it can raise the money on international markets . An Eskom official has already moved to London to seek financing . And the ANC hopes that millions of blacks who protested apartheid by refusing to pay taxes or for such services as electricity will pay their fair share . But economists warn that projecting spending on improved tax_collection is a dubious way to plan . Moreover , there is the harder question of how quickly an untested ANC government , largely led by people who spent decades in exile or prison , can master the sheer morass of bureaucratic and economic challenges that lie ahead . ANC officials insist that the promises can -- and will -- be kept to match fast-rising expectations . Apartheid ' s systematic racial_segregation in everything from education to employment has left 17 million people , in a population of 40 million , in extreme poverty . An estimated 12 million have no access to clean drinking_water , 7 million are homeless , and millions more live without decent schools , basic health_care or real jobs . &quot; We have to be able to deliver in a significant way , &quot; said Willie Hofmeyr , an ANC strategist . &quot; If , after five years ( when another election will be held ) , we have empty hands and broken promises , we ' ll have very big problems from the left. &quot; ANC information chief Pallo Jordan agreed . &quot; The price of failure would be a curse to South_Africa . If you can ' t place goods of freedom in the form of housing and so on before the people , you won ' t have stability . In the absence of stability , you jeopardize democracy , &quot; he said . But Eugene Nyati , an analyst at the independent Center for African Studies here , believes that the ANC will win a lengthy honeymoon after it takes_office . He says most poor blacks are voting for liberation , not instant material goods . &quot; This election is not about issues , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s about symbolism , history and race. &quot; But some issues may cause problems . Land is especially sensitive . Whites have forced blacks from their homes and land since colonial times . The evictions accelerated after 1948 , when the National Party invented apartheid . Millions of families were dumped in desolate reservations called homelands . Others were bulldozed out of their homes and trucked to crowded townships under a policy that removed &quot; black spots &quot; from &quot; white areas. &quot; Whites now control 87 % of the land , including farms that produce nearly all_the food . The ANC has taken pains to reassure nervous whites that their property is safe . &quot; No one ' s land will be forcibly taken_away from them , &quot; said Jay Naidoo , who is in_charge of the ANC reconstruction plan . But the ANC also promises to redistribute 30 % of the agricultural land to the dispossessed within five years . Land courts will adjudicate claims for those displaced under apartheid , government land will be distributed , and other property will be bought_at market_value , Naidoo said . Aninka Claasen , a land policy expert formerly with the Center for Applied Legal Studies here , says the program is unworkable . A last-minute change in the new constitution guarantees rights of existing land owners and limits legal expropriation of land only to such public uses as roads , dams and the_like . &quot; How do you not take_away anyone ' s land , yet redistribute a third of the land ? &quot; she asked . &quot; It ' s a contradiction . . . . The first expropriation of land will be challenged as unconstitutional. &quot; Other contradictions abound . Once famed for its Communist-inspired populist rhetoric , the ANC ' s official goal now is a Keynesian free-market economy with a strong state role , not unlike social democratic governments in Western Europe . And as the election nears , Mandela , the former Marxist revolutionary , has publicly pleaded with the country ' s leftist trade_unions -- who are among his most fervent backers -- to resist strikes and other militant job actions that helped propel him to power . At an appearance Friday at the Johannesburg Stock_Exchange , the world ' s 10th largest , Mandela pledged to &quot; restore economic stability &quot; after the election . He promised it would be built_on &quot; sound market principles , &quot; with development driven by economic_growth and an open_door to foreign investment . &quot; If you look_at our program , there ' s not a single sentence about nationalization , &quot; Mandela said , hoping to reassure nervous business_executives and investors here and abroad . Actually , the 147-page ANC plan does refer to nationalization as one of several potential ways to &quot; increase the public sector in strategic areas. &quot; But Manuel and other top ANC leaders insist that the ANC has no plans to take_over lucrative gold and diamond mines , or other industries . High_finance , of course , is a long way from the hard_times and tin-topped shanties of Alex . Here , hidden in a hollow close by the richest residential belt in all Africa , the concerns are far more basic . Half the adults do not have jobs , so knots of men spend their days drinking beer and playing checkers . Most children never attend the overcrowded schools , which usually lack books and equipment . The poorest area is the graveside squatter camp known as Stjwetla , where hovels are jammed together in a patchwork of packing crates , tin and broken bricks . In one shack , 55-year-old Sina Mogolapa stood_in a torn housedress under a low tin ceiling with plastic bags jammed in cracks to keep_out the rain . The tin house is an oven in summer , a freezer in winter . The front_room has a grate but no chimney , so it fills with smoke if Mogolapa lights a fire . There is no electricity , but a small TV is wired to a car_battery . One daughter works , and another goes_to school . It costs nearly $ 15 , a fortune here , to take a taxi to the nearest medical clinic . &quot; We haven ' t got any money , &quot; Mogolapa said . &quot; Nothing , really. &quot; But her hopes are high as she prepares to vote for the first time next week . &quot; Perhaps after the elections we will see some changes , &quot; she said with a smile . &quot; Perhaps we ' ll see a little help from the ANC. &quot;</TEXT>
