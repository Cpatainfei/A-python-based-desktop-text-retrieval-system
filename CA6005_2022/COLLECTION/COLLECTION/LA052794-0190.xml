   <HEADLINE> CANCER_DRUG CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS IN WOMB , STUDY SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> British scientists said today that a preliminary study showed that a controversial drug therapy used to prevent breast_cancer in high-risk women can cause womb abnormalities associated with uterine cancer . The study on the effects of tamoxifen is likely to deepen concern over a bigger British trial , in which 15 # 000 healthy women will take the drug for several years.The study was published in the_British medical journal Lancet . &quot; These findings confirm that tamoxifen can cause potentially malignant changes in the endometrium ( womb lining ) of postmenopausal women , &quot; the researchers said in their report , which called_for close monitoring of women taking low-dose tamoxifen to prevent breast_cancer from developing . Previous studies have already pointed to a link between tamoxifen , which is commonly used to prolong life in women who with advanced breast_cancer , and tumors in the womb . However , in many such cases doctors feel that the danger of a recurrence of breast_cancer outweighs the risk of the drug damaging the womb .</TEXT>
