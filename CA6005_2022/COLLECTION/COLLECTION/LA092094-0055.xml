   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; A NEW TEST FOR PEACEKEEPERS ; LESSONS LEARNED IN SOMALIA WILL HELP U.N. AVOID SAME PITFALLS IN HAITI , ANALYSTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After the bloody debacle in Somalia that led to withdrawal of American forces in March , the United Nations was not expected to take_on a similar mission anytime soon . But on paper at least , the U.N. takeover from American troops in Haiti due_to take_place in a_few months bears a troubling resemblance to the ill-fated succession in Africa . Nevertheless , analysts do not expect a repeat . For one thing , both the Clinton_Administration and the United Nations learned some bitter lessons from the Somali experience . Former Ambassador Robert B . Oakley , who served as the special representative of Presidents George_Bush and Bill_Clinton in Somalia and became an almost truculent critic of the U.N. mission there , says that both American and U.N. officials have planned the Haiti mission carefully and should avoid the pitfalls of Somalia . &quot; I ' ve talked with a lot of my buddies , &quot; he said in an interview Monday after the Americans went ashore , &quot; and I have a pretty good feel about how they are going_about it , and they have done a meticulous job in planning this. &quot; While &quot; there ' s always a question about what happens when you take a plan into the real_world , &quot; Oakley continued , he did not see a Somalia-like fiasco developing in Haiti . Under the terms of the Security_Council resolution that authorized the American intervention that began Monday , a United Nations peacekeeping force of 6 # 000 troops will take_over from the U.S. mission &quot; when a secure and stable environment has been established &quot; and the United Nations &quot; has adequate force capability and structure to assume the full range of its functions. &quot; Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , told reporters that the time for the takeover will be &quot; measured in months , not weeks. &quot; In Somalia , the U.N. takeover was delayed for almost six months , much to the annoyance of American officials like Oakley , who accused Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of dragging his feet . But Boutros-Ghali believed that the United Nations was being rushed into Somalia before the Americans had completed their job and before the U.N. force was strong enough to take_over . In this case , however , the secretary_general appears to be working in step with the Clinton_Administration . He issued a statement Monday welcoming &quot; the news that a military intervention has been averted in Haiti and that conditions have been created for the peaceful implementation &quot; of the Security_Council resolution . U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright kept Boutros-Ghali closely informed as she managed to steer the resolution through the Security_Council on July 31 . And , in_line with the resolution , he announced that he was sending 15 military observers to Haiti at the end of the week , from France , Argentina , Ireland , Malaysia , New Zealand and Bangladesh . The resolution authorizes him to send up_to 60 observers to monitor the U.S.-led operation and to prepare_for the future transfer of command to the United Nations . The makeup of the peacekeeping force has not yet been announced , but it is expected to include 3 # 000 American troops . According to U.N. spokesmen , offers of troops have also come from Bangladesh , Bolivia , France , Canada , Suriname , Russia , Nepal and some Caribbean states . It is understood that the force will be led by American commanders . This U.N. force is distinct from the American-led multilateral force of more_than 2 # 000 soldiers and police from 24 countries that will soon become part of the American-led task_force in Haiti . The Security_Council resolution , which was passed 12-0 on July 31 with China and Brazil abstaining and Rwanda absent , lays_down three main tasks for the American-led multinational force : * Facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military leadership . * Allow the prompt return of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his government . * Establish and maintain &quot; a secure and stable environment. &quot; The U.N. role , under the resolution , would be threefold : to help in the professionalization of the Haitian armed forces and a new , separate police_force , to sustain the security established by the American-led force , and to prepare a favorable climate for free and fair legislative elections in December . Although the resolution sets_down these mainly political tasks for the U.N. peacekeeping mission , it is widely assumed that the American forces will initiate the activities as soon as possible . In Somalia , in December 1992 , President Bush sent 28 # 000 troops into the East African_country on what he regarded_as a solely humanitarian mission to safeguard relief operations in the midst of a bloody civil_war . Boutros-Ghali , however , believed that the Americans should have disarmed Somalia ' s warring clans . When the Americans refused to do this , according to Boutros-Ghali , it failed to fulfill the Security_Council ' s mandate that it create &quot; a secure environment &quot; in Somalia . When a multinational U.N. force took_over from the United States and its allies in May , 1993 , it did try to disarm the factions , a mission that led to the disastrous manhunt for Gen . Mohammed Farah Aidid and the slaughter of 18 U.S. Rangers in an abortive raid on Aidid ' s lieutenants . The deaths shocked Congress and the American public and prompted President Clinton to announce the withdrawal of the American troops by March . The withdrawal of the Americans so weakened the U.N. mission in Somalia that most observers expect the United Nations to pull_out altogether by the end of the year -- leaving Somalia in renewed chaos . Analysts see clear differences in Somalia and Haiti despite the similarity in the process of a U.N. mission replacing a U.S.-led multilateral force . &quot; First of all , the military problem is much , much smaller in Haiti , &quot; said Edward C . Luck , senior policy adviser of the United Nations Assn . &quot; You just don ' t have the quantity of arms around nor the heavy weaponry around . And you don ' t have these armed tribal groups involved in a civil war. &quot; &quot; I think it ' s much more doable in Haiti , &quot; he went_on . &quot; I think the nature of the U.N. Haiti operation will hopefully be closer to traditional peacekeeping with an element of nation-building . The Somalia mission turned_into peace enforcement . I don ' t think you are going_to get_to that in Haiti. &quot; Luck also believes that the United States , if faced with problems in Haiti , will stick it out and not rush_off as it did_in Somalia , dooming the U.N. operation there . &quot; We were willing to go_into Haiti with guns blazing , &quot; he said . &quot; We ought to be able to stick_around if things get rough. &quot; Oakley also pointed_out that both the United States and the United Nations now agree on the importance of creating a professional police_force in Haiti . He insists that the United Nations was not committed to this in Somalia . &quot; This time , everyone understands you have to do that if you ' re going to have a neutral body to supervise law and order in a difficult environment , &quot; he said . He also said that the United States recognizes that the Americans will be &quot; the prime_mover &quot; in the Haiti operation , even when the United Nations takes_over . The United States refused to accept this in Somalia . But Oakley also sees evident problems ahead . &quot; The most difficult , &quot; he said , &quot; is the question of how much are the U.N. and the U.S. going_to be involved in running Haiti ' s affairs once the U.N role kicks in. &quot;</TEXT>
