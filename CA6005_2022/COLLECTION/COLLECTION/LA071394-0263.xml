   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 ; ALL EYES ON THE PRIZE ; SOCCER BECOMES BIGGER THAN A BIG STORY IN THE FOUR NATIONS IN THE SEMIFINALS : IT BECOMES THE ONLY STORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If there are Bulgarians in Italy tonight , they are silent Bulgarians . From the Alps to Sicily , nothing will move_in Italy beyond flickering images on TV_sets when the beloved Azzurri play Bulgaria in a World Cup semifinal game . More_than half the country -- about 30 million people , nearly half of them women -- will watch every move with unconcealed partisanship . In Bulgaria , the team ' s ascent has been compared to the fall of communism there in 1989 . A victory today would send hundreds of thousands of celebrants onto the streets of Sofia , some bearing beer and schnapps , others wearing masks of hero Hristo Stoitchkov ' s face . In Brazil , Luzinete Nunes de Santana , a 32-year-old domestic , again won ' t be able to watch her nation ' s semifinal game against Sweden without first taking tranquilizers . &quot; I scream , I cry , I kick ; whoever is at my side suffers , &quot; says De Santana , who spent most of her $ 64 monthly salary to buy a uniform resembling the national team ' s . &quot; I feel my heart pounding and I ' m afraid of getting sick. &quot; If Sweden wins , fans by the thousands , with faces painted in the blue and yellow of the Swedish flag , can again be expected to dance and strip and swim in the fountain of Stockholm ' s central square , Sergels Torg , reveling in cool water against the heat of victory and shouting &quot; Sweden , Sweden , Sweden , &quot; until they lose their voices . The fervor today in four nations with teams in the World Cup semifinals will stretch across class , color and geography , from the Rocinha slums of Brazil to the majesty of Rome . It will be all-consuming . &quot; It ' s hard for Americans to understand , &quot; says Vanderley Borges , Rio de Janeiro police press secretary . &quot; There ' s no equivalent_to it for them. &quot; * The local impact of this famous , long and contagious international athletic event rivals Carnival , outshines the Northern Lights , outdraws the pope , and , as party-starter down east , humbles the fall of communism . Yes , by now everybody knows the World Cup transfixes the world outside the United States , but today Brazil , Sweden , Italy and Bulgaria are most viscerally afflicted . The disparity of finalists is remarkable this year , rich and poor , large and small . There is an eastern team , a western team , a northern team and a southern team . Two teams that expected to be here ; two that most expected would be long gone_by now . &quot; The real miracle of this World Cup is not the presence of Italy in the semifinal , a point the team has reached four times in the last five editions . . . . The real miracle has been achieved by little Bulgaria , &quot; said Giorgio Tosatti in the Milan daily Corriere della Sera . Brazil and Italy , cases_in_point , are among the final four because that is where they belong . Any of the millions of soccer experts walking the streets of Sao Paulo or Milan this morning can explain why , although few would resist also criticizing the much-maligned Italian and Brazilian coaches . After Italy beat Spain to advance to the semifinals , a reporter asked Italian Coach Arrigo Sacchi why the same teams always seem to advance . &quot; It is not the case of a single tournament but of the history , the organization and the soccer environment in any given country , &quot; said Sacchi , who once coached AC Milan , which has consistently been the best team in the Italian League , itself the world ' s best . There are four soccer giants in the world , and Italy and Brazil , each three-time Cup winners , are two of them . Germany and Argentina , now among the 20 also-rans , are the others . Fans at_home , their opponents -- indeed , the entire world -- expect these teams to do_well . If they do not , heads roll as well as soccer_balls . There are no such lofty expectations in Sweden , which hasn ' t placed since 1958 and nearly didn ' t qualify this year , or Bulgaria , which had never won a World Cup match until this year . They have triumphed , even if they lose today . So is it that soccer-crazed millions in four competing nations will watch semifinal matches today from perspectives as disparate as the countries that engender them . BRAZIL In Brazil , millions of hearts teeter on the edge of collective agony and ecstasy with each game , particularly as the country advances closer to the final . Cardiologist Carlos Sheer has been busy . &quot; Last Cup , I took_care of various urgent calls of high_blood_pressure and chest_pain , &quot; Sheer said . &quot; This year , for the time being , I ' ve only received calls of people worrying if they could watch the game. &quot; So intense is the emotion in Brazil that when a power outage in the remote Amazon town of Pimento Bueono sent television pictures flickering off the screen , an enraged mob of 1 # 000 rushed_out of their homes , stoned the mayor ' s office and stormed the town ' s electrical_power plant , setting fire to a power_company car . And that was just for Brazil ' s first game . The entire country borders_on collective fanaticism , swept_up in futbol fever . Even in the middle of a presidential campaign and a complete change of the national currency , football , accompanied with a huge photo , has been the lead_story in every newspaper since the World Cup began . Nationally , congress adjourns , schools close , government_offices and local businesses shut_down early for every game that Brazil plays , a phenomenon akin to shutting_down all_of America for a playoff_game . Except for neighborhoods where tens of thousands gather to watch huge , big-screen televisions , urban_centers such_as Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo -- a total of 30 million people -- seem like ghost_towns . Nearly everybody is inside watching the game . &quot; Football is more emblematic for the Brazilian population than a change in the economy , &quot; says anthropologist Jose Carlos Rodrigues , professor at Pontifica Catholic University and Federal Fluminense University . &quot; We have our own mythology , like the Greeks have their own . Football is the God of our national mythology . It cauterizes emotions and makes each citizen feel_like part of the whole. &quot; Neighborhoods and even cities have been transformed into a sea of green and gold as residents have hung banners and canopies of streamers across streets that have been repainted in the national colors . One Sao Paulo store alone has sold 60 # 000 meters of decorative green and gold ribbon , enough to stretch the length of 650 football_fields . Exploding fireworks on game day give the city the sound of a war zone . And after each victory , streets are closed to vehicular_traffic as people pour into the streets to celebrate . With each victory , the anxiety is heightened . With a victory in the World Cup , the country will explode in a celebration bigger than the massive Carnival , which takes_over the city every year . &quot; It ' s so big that it ' s actually frightening , &quot; says Eloisa Leuzinger , a 45-year-old researcher . And if they lose ? &quot; we ' ll all cry , &quot; said Jorge Luiz Nascimento , 52 , head of a neighborhood association . &quot; The whole country . You don ' t want to see it. &quot; SWEDEN The headline in Monday ' s afternoon Aftonbladet tabloid in Sweden said it all : &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; This Was The Wildest Party of All , &quot; the paper said in its 16-page special section after Sweden defeated Romania on penalty kicks_in the quarterfinal on Sunday . So wild was it that one woman delivered a baby boy in the central square , unable to get_through the throngs to the hospital ; so wild that a man in the southern city of Malmo suffered a heart_attack watching the game but refused to let his wife call the hospital until the penalty shooting was over ; so wild that another woman fatally stabbed her husband who preferred the game to making_love . He and half the nation felt that way -- 4 million Swedes . Then , in the cities early Monday morning , drivers honked their horns , pedestrians climbed traffic_lights and lampposts to wave their flags higher , higher . &quot; We are so proud to be Swedish , &quot; enthused sports writer Bengt Olsson at Aftonbladet . &quot; We haven ' t had a success like this since ( Bjorn ) Borg won Wimbledon back in the ' 70s. &quot; Or since Sweden went_to the semifinals in 1958 . &quot; We made_it through from the torture_chamber of soccer , &quot; wrote Aftonbladet ' s Ulle Svenning . Svenning is a political columnist , but then what could be more important to the nation than soccer now ? &quot; This is a triumph for a team , not for any individual , &quot; he wrote . &quot; that ' s how we want it in Sweden . Nobody should be a hero , bigger than the team. &quot; Nobody but goalie Thomas Ravelli , perhaps , whose picture was plastered across the country . &quot; He Saves Us &quot; said the headline in Aftonbladet . &quot; England , France , Germany , Holland , Colombia -- All out , &quot; the Swedish paper Expressen celebrated . &quot; And Sweden in the semifinals against Brazil. &quot; Victory is thrilling , exciting , fantastic , Swedes said . Even the drunken fans , the soccer hooligans who turned_over a patrol_car and went_for a bus before police evacuated Sergels Torg , even they didn ' t dampen the national enthusiasm . &quot; Sports pulls people together , &quot; Olsson said . &quot; This is good nationalism. &quot; ITALY By this late stage in a madness that sweeps all_of Italy once every four years , newspapers can ' t keep soccer terms out of their headlines even when talking_of serious world affairs , such_as the outcome of the weekend G-7 meeting in Naples . &quot; Yeltsin wins the Mondiale ( World Cup ) of the Eight &quot; said La Stampa of Turin , hailing Russia as a new member of the group of the seven , now eight , leading industrialized countries . In their customary commentaries that put soccer on the front pages , columnists are not expecting an easy victory for Italy over Bulgaria , which has already beaten Argentina , Mexico and Germany . &quot; It will be another suffering , &quot; predicts Gianni Mura in La Repubblica . For Italy , suffering is the middle name of World Cup ' 94 . Gritty Bulgaria stormed into the semifinals . Mighty Italy limped , each game a Calvary ; every victory a last-minute miracle . Since the Cup began , Italians have been outwardly unhappy with the coach , the stars and the entire team -- singly , or in often arcane combination . Would they qualify ? Could they win ? Would they advance ? &quot; Ironically , now that they have made the semifinals , the pressure is off . The higher you go , the easier it gets , &quot; said commentator Giorgio Chinaglia , one of Italy ' s greatest former players . Now that honor is assured , every move that any player or coach makes in America is grist to immediate digestion and instant analysis . Nearly every day there is a consuming teapot tempest : It is too hot , it is too humid , the team runs too_much , the coach is a cretin , the team doesn ' t run enough , the coach is a genius . Italian police will watch tonight ' s proceedings along with everyone else , but after the game there will be work to do if Italy wins : Italians have never been known to celebrate in silence . Huge , happy crowds jam city_centers up and down the peninsula . After the quarterfinal victory over Spain , police banned cars from the center of Rome -- there were too many people in the streets . Naples , particularly , hankers for a festa . Italy ' s victory Saturday came when the ceremonial heart of the city was closed to Neapolitans and filled with VIPs -- President Clinton to Yeltsin to soccer fanatic Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi . The best Naples could muster last weekend was a roar when Italy scored its winning goal that interrupted a press_conference by visiting French President Francois Mitterand . Now the bigwigs are gone and Naples is an open city again , able to fully participate in a consuming national thirst for soccer victory . BULGARIA Perhaps David Miller , writing in the Times of London , best summed_up the feeling in Bulgaria : &quot; There is an element of national celebration in Bulgaria ' s victory that few in the United States for the finals can understand . For the nine million population of the country bordering the Black_Sea , this performance is a global representation of new liberties , a joyous statement of nationalism enacted far away in the world ' s most powerful country , where the population is busy searching for Bulgaria on the atlas . &quot; The exploits of Stoitchkov and Yordan Letchkov have done for Bulgaria what Hungary ' s triumphs did for theirs in the early Fifties , winning the Olympic Games and , so nearly , the World Cup , and most especially for what it then still meant , defeating England at Wembley for the first time. &quot; So it was not surprising that President Zhelyu Zhelev , in a nationwide broadcast , equated the soccer team ' s ascent to the fall of communism . &quot; Only after democracy came_to this country our soccer players were allowed to play abroad and to create their real talents , &quot; Zhelev said . &quot; So this victory comes naturally as a result of this development. &quot; A crowd of some 10 # 000 watched the quarterfinal victory over Germany on huge television screens in front of the National Palace of Culture . Hours after the game they formed a dancing and singing throng ; cars filled downtown Sofia , causing traffic gridlock and blocking public transportation . &quot; Our golden_boys made us forget the 10th of November , &quot; said Alexander Tomov , 40 , referring to the day in 1989 when former Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov was toppled . &quot; The 10th of July is our new national holiday. &quot; Maria Mihailova , 75 , who was_on the street celebrating with the young soccer fans , said she could not remember such a joyful event in Bulgaria . &quot; I feel at least 10 years younger , &quot; she said . Times staff writers Ron Harris in Sao Paulo and Marjorie Miller in Bonn , Germany ; special correspondent Janet Stobart in Rome and Times news services contributed to this story .</TEXT>
