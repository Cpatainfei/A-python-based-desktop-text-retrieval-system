   <HEADLINE> BELL ATLANTIC , NYNEX PLAN CELLULAR MERGER ; TELECOMMUNICATIONS : THE DEAL FUELS SPECULATION THAT AIRTOUCH COULD BECOME A THIRD PARTNER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bell Atlantic Corp . and Nynex Corp . formally announced Thursday that they will merge their cellular_telephone operations -- a move that industry executives and analysts said is just the first_step in the development of a nationwide wireless communications alliance that may ultimately include Sprint Corp . and California ' s Airtouch . The two big East Coast phone_companies said size and broad geographic coverage will be crucial for success in the fast-growing but increasingly competitive wireless communications business . With AT &amp; T Corp . seeking to buy McCaw Cellular , and MCI Communications allying itself with national wireless service provider Nextel , regional cellular operators will have little choice but to join forces , analysts said . &quot; You will see consortiums like mad among the regional players , &quot; said Sharon Armbrust , senior analyst at Paul Kagan &amp; Associates , a Carmel , Calif.-based research firm . If regulators approve -- and analysts expect little trouble on that front -- the merged cellular operations of Bell Atlantic and Nynex will be worth about $ 13 billion and cover a region with a population of 55 million , making the new entity the nation ' s second-largest cellular service provider behind McCaw . The deal is by far the largest ever between the Baby Bells created by the breakup of AT &amp; T a decade ago . But the new cellular behemoth will still be limited largely to the Northeast , and speculation was rife Thursday that Airtouch , recently spun_off from Pacific Telesis Group , will soon emerge as a third partner , either through an equity investment or a business alliance . Airtouch declined to comment specifically on the rumors . &quot; We ' ve been talking to companies about partnering to provide a seamless network , &quot; said Amy Damianakes , spokeswoman for Airtouch . Airtouch was set to make an announcement of a wireless deal with Nynex earlier this year but canceled at the last minute for unspecified reasons . Sprint Corp. , the No . 3 long-distance company and the only one without a major wireless alliance , was also cited as a likely partner . A number of recent developments have accelerated the trend toward consolidation in the cellular business . The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a communications deregulation bill that includes a provision allowing Bell companies to carry long-distance_calls that originate with cellular_telephones . And the Federal Communications Commission later this year will auction_off licenses for personal communications services , a new class of wireless services that will supplement and compete with cellular systems . Groups that want to form national wireless networks will need PCS licenses to fill_in missing patches in their networks . &quot; They ( the announcements ) have cleared the way to make wireless one of the greatest growth markets in the next 10 years , &quot; said Raymond W . Smith , chairman and chief_executive of Bell Atlantic . Paul Kagan &amp; Associates estimates the number of cellular subscribers nationwide will grow to 108 million in 10 years , from 17.5 million today . Analysts see most wireless providers eventually allying themselves with one of four or five groups , each capable of offering a range of services without the inconvenience of incompatible technologies and roaming charges from region to region . The push toward national consolidation began last year , when AT &amp; T announced it would spend $ 12.6 billion to acquire McCaw . Although that deal has been hung_up in the courts , the Nynex-Bell Atlantic transaction , by creating a powerful new competitor , may have unwittingly strengthened AT &amp; T ' s plea to the Justice_Department that it be allowed to complete the merger.. MCI Communications followed earlier this year by spending $ 1.3 billion for just under 20 % of Nextel Communications . Nextel , which uses Motorola technology to offer cellular-like services , says it will be able to cover 180 million people when its full system is in place . The company will also aggressively bid for PCS licenses . MCI spokesman Kevin Inda said the Bell Atlantic-Nynex merger &quot; validates what we have been saying . It ' s very important to deliver a national brand. &quot; Some industry insiders question how successful the East Coast group will be in building a national network . There are already companies such_as Cellular One that offer customers many of the benefits of a national brand . And skeptics say Nynex and Bell Atlantic are a long way from building the end-to-end networking capabilities that would be required to provide a real benefit to customers .</TEXT>
