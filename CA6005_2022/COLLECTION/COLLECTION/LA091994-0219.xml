   <TEXT> Bonnie Carlson had invited a new gentleman friend over for a home-cooked dinner . Carlson , a 44-year-old resident of the Santa Clarita Valley , fixed pasta , simmered her special homemade tomato_sauce , tossed a Caesar_salad and put candles on the table . The romantic spell was broken just after dinner , however , when her date , Greg Frank , 39 , broached a delicate subject . &quot; He asked whether I ' d been married before , &quot; she says . Yes , she had been married and divorced , Carlson told him . &quot; Four times. &quot; Since he had been divorced once , he understood how marriages can disintegrate . So they talked . And dated . And over Labor_Day weekend -- two years after that candlelight dinner -- they wed in Las Vegas . Carlson ' s after-dinner scenario reflects two facts of life for the multiply divorced , as this group is now called by researchers : * Fearing social stigma , they carefully choose whom to tell about their past . * Despite failures and caustic_remarks , most remain committed to finding a lifelong spouse . Only about 7 % of divorced people in the United States have been through three or more marital splits , according to federal_government estimates from 1988 , the latest year for which statistics are available . Experts have begun to monitor this group more closely and some say the figure could reach 10 % this year . The reasons for the rise , they say , include no-fault divorce , which since becoming law more_than two decades ago has made dissolution easier , and clinical papers suggesting a greater likelihood for divorce among those who have been through it before . Multiple divorce is &quot; the new scarlet_letter , &quot; contends Patricia Emerson , a USC sociology graduate_student who presented her study recently at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Assn . Today , she says , those who have divorced several times face the same social stigma endured by those who divorced once a_few generations ago . While she predicts that this stigma will fade eventually , she says it ' s still very much a part of life now . Studies about multiple divorce have been scarce partly because the population has been small . Craig A . Everett , co-author with his wife , Sandra Volgy Everett , of &quot; Healthy Divorce &quot; ( Jossey-Bass , 1994 ) , recalls that his graduate_students in the mid- ' 80s at Florida State University wanted to conduct such a study but could not gather enough subjects . Another barrier has been a reluctance to talk by those who have divorced many times . So when Emerson embarked_on her study , she promised confidentiality to her 12 subjects -- all Los Angeles residents , 35 to 73 , divorced three or more times , first married at age 17 to 25 . Overall , the group was highly educated , with at least a high_school diploma . More_than half have college degrees or postgraduate degrees . Once the six men and six women were guaranteed anonymity , the floodgates opened . In two-hour interviews , they detailed their turmoil and experiences . Many said they had received support and encouragement from family and friends during each divorce . But once the tally had risen to three or more , the reaction from society in_general was often not so tolerant . While celebrities seem to be forgiven for their inability to hold a marriage together , the everyday folks Emerson polled said they often heard rude comments by co-workers and bosses . One man , recently divorced , told Emerson : &quot; I do not want to hear that old phrase ' three-time loser ' one more time , from anybody ! I hear it every once in a while . . . supposedly in jest , but it bothers me because somebody is saying that you are stupid , you made a mistake , and you made three of them. &quot; To cope , many said they divide the world into those they can trust and those to whom they do not confide details about their past . A common stereotype -- that multiply divorced people take marriage lightly -- was disputed . &quot; They see a marriage as ( until ) death do us part , and that ' s their goal , &quot; whether the marriage is the first or the fifth , Emerson says . Many told her that they were opposed to living together before marriage . Splitting_up does not get easier with practice , the subjects also said , even though friends would make such comments as , &quot; Well , this divorce ought to be easy . You ' ve done this before. &quot; * Some , but not all , of Emerson ' s findings are borne_out in clinical practice , says Everett , now a Tucson family therapist who often counsels multiply divorced people . He and others say the stigma is already fading , partly because it is becoming more common . &quot; People are not nearly so embarrassed ( as in years past ) to come_into my office and say ' I ' ve been divorced three times , ' &quot; says Dr. Robert M . Counts , a psychiatrist at New York University Medical_Center and medical director of the Center for Marital and Family Therapy in Manhattan . &quot; Second and third divorces began to dramatically show_up in the overall divorce rate in 1986 , &quot; Counts wrote in a recent article in the Journal of Divorce &amp; Remarriage . The trend will continue for at least another 20 years and probably longer , says Counts , who has practiced psychiatry for 45 years . When statistics are analyzed for 1994 , Counts says , &quot; it is likely that 10 % of divorces will be No . 3 or beyond. &quot; Those who have experienced several divorces say they find truth in both Emerson ' s research and the therapists ' observations . Most are uneasy , at least initially , about divulging their marital history to a new dating partner . Carlson tried to keep a sense_of_humor . She still laughs when she remembers reactions from new dates after hearing about her four prior marriages . &quot; They either think , ' You ' re really good . . . ' or ' You ' re really baaad . ' &quot; Elaine Young , a well-known Beverly Hills real_estate_broker , used to dread being asked about her divorces . &quot; I ' d hold_up fingers , like a little kid ( telling age ) . &quot; Actually , Young , 59 , would hold_up one whole hand and another finger . But the stigma , she believes , has diminished . Bob Fletcher , 46 , a Burbank insurance_broker who is in the midst of a divorce from his third wife , simply volunteers the information . &quot; Most women say , ' Gee , you ' re such a nice guy . How did this happen ? ' &quot; he says . * Finding another partner is a typical goal . &quot; In my experience , probably 90 % are still hopeful about pursuing a new relationship , &quot; Everett says . It lends weight to the old saying , attributed to Samuel Johnson , that remarriage is &quot; the triumph of hope over experience. &quot; But not everyone is hopeful . Fletcher is wary of taking the plunge again . &quot; Today , I ' d have to say ' No. ' &quot; But , he ' s quick to add , &quot; I still believe_in marriage. &quot; Young ' s outlook is more the norm : &quot; I ' m looking_for No . 7 , &quot; she says brightly . Is this perseverance mentally healthy ? Counts isn ' t so sure it ' s healthy for everyone . In his research , he has identified those he calls &quot; divorce prone , &quot; who are surprisingly similar to never-married people he terms &quot; marriage phobic. &quot; Both groups have difficulties with intimate relationships , he says , &quot; but they manage the problem differently. &quot; The divorce-prone are more likely to bail_out when they face a major challenge in the relationship ; the marriage phobic simply avoid the whole situation . Whether marriage-minded or not , experiencing a second or third divorce often leads to an intense personal assessment , family therapist Everett says . Carlson , for instance , examined the reasons for her four divorces before marrying for the fifth time . &quot; I was brought_up in a home where I was taught it is not right to live with someone , &quot; she says . The men she divorced , however , turned_out &quot; not to be the people I thought they were. &quot; Her many attempts at marriage are also tied , she believes , to &quot; an overwhelming need for family life and a need to fit_in , &quot; which she attributes to her discovery , at age 31 , that she had been adopted . Anyone contemplating marriage -- for the second time or the 10th -- would be wise_to examine , as Carlson did , their motives and what caused past divorces , experts concur . Counts , while acknowledging that some divorces are more the result of bad_luck than bad judgment , stresses : &quot; The problems will be repeated unless there is treatment to understand why they ' ve made bad choices. &quot; Multiple Divorces Total number of divorces granted , U.S. , 1988 * : $ 1 # 167 , 000 1st divorces : 71 % ( 828 # 570 ) 2nd divorces : 22 % ( 256 # 740 ) 3rd or more divorces : 7 % ( 81 # 690 ) * 1988 is the latest year for which statistics are available .
