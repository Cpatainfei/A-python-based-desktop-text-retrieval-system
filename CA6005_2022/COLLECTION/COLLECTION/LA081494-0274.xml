   <HEADLINE> LAPD OFFICERS FAULTED IN 3 OF 4 SHOOTING CASES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three out of every four times that Los Angeles police_officers fire their weapons , superiors fault them for potentially life-threatening mistakes that warrant retraining or discipline , records show . Many officers succumbed to what one union leader called &quot; the John Wayne Syndrome , &quot; according to a Times review of nearly 700 shooting reports since 1989 . They tended to be too aggressive , abandoning well-established safeguards when moving_into armed confrontations . One officer fired at a possible burglar from nearly a football_field away . Another shot an unarmed teen-ager who was displaying nothing resembling a weapon . Three others shot out their own windshields while trying to stop suspects . A range of tactical errors , from poor communication to failure to take cover , may have led to dozens of other unnecessary shootings by officers in the Los Angeles Police_Department , internal reports show . One officer mistakenly shot another in the back as they converged in the darkness on an unarmed suspect . Commanders later blamed the incident on an &quot; oversight &quot; : The officers had not turned_on their flashlights . And in nearly 100 cases , on- and off-duty officers accidentally fired their weapons , sometimes resulting in injuries or deaths . An off-duty officer , leaving for the Persian_Gulf_War , wanted to give a friend a bullet from his . 38-caliber revolver as a goodby memento . The gun misfired , and the officer shot her through the thigh . LAPD officials have ruled that most non-accidental shootings were justified because the officers believed that lives were in danger when they pulled the trigger . Although they acknowledge some training weaknesses , officials maintain that the high rate of errors is chiefly a reflection of the department ' s overarching efforts to critique its own officers . &quot; People think we shined every shooting on like we weren ' t paying_attention , &quot; said former Police_Chief Daryl F . Gates , who signed_off on hundreds of shooting reports before resigning under_fire in 1992 . &quot; The fact is , we were hypercritical . . . . Every miscue is cited so we could learn from it. &quot; A Recurring Issue Police shootings have proved a recurring issue in Los Angeles since 1979 when two police_officers fatally shot Eulia Love , who was armed with a kitchen knife . This month , an LAPD officer shot and killed a man who was carrying a toy gun , prompting criticisms from some witnesses . After the Rodney G . King beating in 1991 , the Christopher Commission urged reforms involving the LAPD ' s use-of-force policies , including those for firearms . The department pledged a new use-of-force manual , but it is not yet completed . The Times found in reviewing 694 internal LAPD reports that shooting-related mistakes are no less frequent today than five years ago . No action was deemed necessary in 25 % of the cases . More_than half of all shootings led to retraining , while a quarter resulted in punishment , including reprimand , suspension or dismissal . Although policies vary among law_enforcement agencies , data from several suggests that officers in Los Angeles are cited for shooting-related mistakes far more frequently than elsewhere . Long_Beach police officials ordered training or administrative review to correct mistakes in less than half of recent police shootings . Chicago took action in about one in five shootings , and the Orange County Sheriff ' s Department in less than one in 10 . In Orange County , the rate of mistakes found in Sheriff ' s Department shootings was also far lower than in Los Angeles . Sheriff ' s Department spokesman Lt . Dan Martini said that out of 11 non-accidental shootings by Orange County deputies since 1992 , the department ordered discipline in only one case , taking no action in the rest . Unlike Los Angeles , the department does not consider training for officers involved in shootings , Martini said . The Orange County Sheriff ' s Department does not make public its internal reviews of officer-involved shootings . Last year , in one of the department ' s most controversial shootings , Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins was shot in the face and killed by fellow deputy Brian Scanlan during a Christmas_Day training drill behind a Lake Forest movie_theater . Scanlan had been using a loaded weapon during the drill_in violation of department policy . The Los Angeles Sheriff ' s Department also releases less information about shootings than the LAPD . But the available records indicate that the Sheriff ' s Department , with almost as_many officers as the LAPD , reports roughly half the number of shooting incidents each year . Investigations of 25 sheriff ' s shootings resulted in discipline against three deputies in the second_half of last year -- less than half the LAPD ' s rate for the year . It is unclear whether the numbers reflect disparities in the frequency of firearms-related errors , or the vigor of departments in addressing them . The LAPD does appear to take a tougher approach to post-shooting training than some_other departments . Training at some agencies usually means a supervisor simply sits_down with an officer to talk_about the shooting , while other departments forgo training altogether . In Chicago , officers in shootings are either disciplined or cleared ; there is no retraining . But even with such differences , one U.S. Justice_Department official who specializes in tracking law_enforcement data said the LAPD numbers still seem unusually high : &quot; It says either there was a lack of training , or . . . a lack of supervision when it came_to the use of ( deadly ) force. &quot; City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas , who as vice_chairman of the Public Safety Committee reviews police activities , said he too was surprised by the numbers . &quot; What this suggests to me is that force might not have been necessary in many of these shootings if individuals were_better trained , &quot; Ridley-Thomas said . Deputy Chief Lawrence E . Fetters , who heads the in-house shooting review panel , blamed many shooting errors on training deficiencies caused by high turnover on the 7 # 500-officer force . He noted a decline in the experience level among training officers . &quot; Sometimes , &quot; he said , &quot; it ' s kind of like the blind leading the blind. &quot; Needless Gunfire Dennis Tate had worked for years as an actor , with bit roles in movies and TV , even an award-winning off-Broadway performance . But by 1991 , the parts had stopped coming_in , and Tate was sweating his days away at two fast-food jobs and sleeping under tattered blankets on the floor of an abandoned South-Central house . Then the police came at 2 a.m. on March 23 . They had gotten a call -- groundless , it turned_out -- that there was a body in the house , and two officers went inside . All the 59-year-old Tate knew was that there were two men with flashlights , raising a ruckus in the next room . &quot; What is it ? &quot; demanded a groggy Tate , still wearing his Pizza Hut uniform . &quot; Police ! Get your ass out here ! &quot; came the response , according to a deposition Tate gave two years ago . &quot; Come out and take your hands_out of your pockets ! &quot; Tate did , but too quickly , and Officer Garland Hardeman fired , police said . The officers said they believed the belligerent suspect was reaching for a gun . &quot; I took my hands_out of my pocket and the next thing I know I heard something like a hand clap , and I fell on the floor , &quot; Tate recalled . &quot; There was a big gaping wound in my leg . . . . I said , ' I did what you wanted , and you shot me. ' &quot; Police officials later found the shooting unwarranted , records show , and they suspended Hardeman for five days . Tate won a $ 150 # 000 settlement from the city . But he walked with a cane after two surgeries and a month in the hospital . Earlier this year , after he apparently had cashed a disability_check , he was killed by muggers in Hollywood , his lawyer said . The Tate mishap is one of 58 shootings over the last five years in which the department issued its most serious finding : An officer was not justified in_using deadly force because there was no immediate threat to anyone . Once , an officer answering a gang call shot and killed a teacher ' s aide after mistaking a &quot; dark object &quot; for a gun ; it turned_out to be a camera . In other cases , a glove and a chrome-plated comb prompted police to shoot . In one 1990 confrontation with suspected car strippers , a police_officer shot an unarmed teen-ager in the abdomen . The officer said the youth appeared to be reaching for a gun . But Chief Gates disciplined the officer after finding that he &quot; did not see him holding anything that could even be construed as a weapon. &quot; The teen-ager was not charged , and the city agreed to a $ 1.4-million settlement . &quot; The common thread I ' ve seen , &quot; said attorney Jeffrey Galen , who represented Tate and others in lawsuits against police , &quot; is you see officers jumping the gun , shooting and asking questions later. &quot; Between 1989 and 1993 , records show , the LAPD reported 127 fatalities in officer-involved shootings . Last year , the city agreed to pay $ 5.6 million to settle police shootings , more_than half of all police litigation payouts . Unwarranted shootings , representing about one in 10 of all non-accidental shootings , often occurred at the close of a car chase , in a suspected drug house , or at the end of a dark alley as officers answered a call . But others came_after hours , when officers were off_duty . During an argument at her home , an officer fired into a Teddy_bear . During a traffic dispute , another officer sprayed 13 rounds across a busy street , wounding three people in the other car . A third off-duty officer went_on what investigators described as &quot; an aggressive , armed quest &quot; after spotting a &quot; beer run &quot; robbery at a convenience_store . Aided by his armed son , he ended_up in a shootout with the bandits and was wounded in the head . The department disciplined him for shooting without cause . In dozens of cases where officers did have reasons to shoot , the department found problems in the execution . Officers sometimes fired too many rounds or endangered bystanders by shooting at moving vehicles . One officer fired at a fleeing suspect from 283 feet away on a Downtown street . It is a precept of policing that officers should use their guns only as a last_resort -- when lives are in danger . At the LAPD , where 22 on-duty officers have been killed in the last decade , even warning shots are discouraged in all but the most dire situations . Many officers pride themselves on never using their weapons during years of service . Unlike some departments , the LAPD investigates all &quot; officer-involved shootings , &quot; whether the officer is_on duty or off , whether the shot is deliberate or accidental , whether anyone is hit . &quot; We are our own worst critics , I think , &quot; Fetters said . When an officer is found in violation of shooting policies , the case is sent to Internal Affairs for investigation . But usually only the most serious cases , or those in which the officer appeals disciplinary action , are publicly disclosed . Some victims advocates believe this shroud of secrecy has allowed LAPD abuses to go unchecked . &quot; Are we really disciplining these officers , or are we slapping their wrists ? &quot; asked Karol Heppe , executive_director of Police Watch , a lawyer referral service for alleged police victims . &quot; Who ' s keeping a watch on the trigger-happy officers ? &quot; The department insists that it is . In addition to ordering discipline for dozens of officers each year , officials say they also require thousands of hours of remedial training for shooting mistakes . Retraining can include a week in Tactical Awareness School , or a_few days in a firearms &quot; re-familiarization &quot; program . Although the department says that retraining is not punitive , Skaggs of the police union said : &quot; The officers view it as being_on trial . They don ' t ever feel they need the extra training , and they feel that their career sometimes is_on the line . That ( criticism ) goes_on your record. &quot; The district_attorney ' s office also reviews police shootings , but criminal filings are rare : In 284 LAPD shooting investigations since 1990 , prosecutors have brought charges once . Veteran Officer Douglas Iversen was charged with murder in the 1992 slaying of tow truck_driver John Daniels , who was driving_away from a gas_station as Iversen tried to stop him . The officer ' s trial is pending , and the LAPD has relieved him of duty pending an internal review . Tactical Mistakes One morning in 1989 , just south of Koreatown , two officers chased down a young_man suspected of robbing a pedestrian at gunpoint . &quot; Get your hands up ! &quot; one cop shouted at 23-year-old Vaughn Marshall . As Marshall approached , one of the officers walked_out from behind her car -- despite her partner ' s warning to &quot; keep your cover. &quot; The suspect reached toward his waist , police said . Fearful that his partner was exposed to a gunman , the senior officer fired twice . The second round hit Marshall on the right side of his skull , killing him . The victim , it turned_out , was not armed . Police found the shooting itself &quot; in policy , &quot; but they faulted the tactics leading_up to it . The junior officer , they said , should never have left her cover , and her &quot; poor tactics directly precipitated &quot; the shooting . Officers often ran_into problems when they simply tried to do too_much , displaying a hero ' s mentality more suited to the movie screen than to the streets : An officer races after an armed suspect without taking cover , splits from his partner and fails to ask_for a backup . Then , left to confront a suspect on_his_own , he opts to use his weapon . Bad communications posed the most frequent tactical problem , cited in 230 shootings -- or one in three . Officers neglected to tell their partners that someone had a gun . Many did not let their command_posts know what they were doing . And others did not give adequate orders to suspects . Tactical problems come_up so frequently that LAPD officials sometimes seemed exasperated when writing_up officers . &quot; Don ' t split_up ! &quot; Gates wrote after one 1990 shooting . Some mistakes bordered_on the bizarre . Like the time an officer threw a child ' s bike at a charging German_shepherd before shooting at the dog . Or when an undercover detective shot out his windshield as he struggled to extricate himself from a seat_belt while chasing a Van Nuys car thief . Police officials ordered &quot; additional training in exiting a vehicle. &quot; Records show that although the department often catches glaring shooting mistakes , commanders are also quick to criticize some officers who appeared to have done a good job , or even acted heroically . Last year , Officers Hilton Henry and Stephen Kehoe apprehended a suspected robber who took a 12-year-old girl hostage in east Hollywood . The officers helped free the girl unharmed , and Kehoe took two bullets in a shootout with the suspect , putting him out_of_work for two months . Chief Willie L . Williams lauded the &quot; courageous and heroic actions &quot; of the officers , but ordered training for both because of a series of tactical lapses . The most critical : Henry left his car unlocked and running when he first confronted the suspect . The wounded suspect jumped in the police_car , taking the girl . After a_few blocks , he rammed into another car and was captured . In another case , an officer was praised for &quot; exemplary &quot; work in killing a man who was raping a woman at scissors-point . But the officer and his partner were ordered to undergo training because they did not take cover when confronting the suspect . The safety of the officers demands such admonitions , Fetters said . &quot; We tell them : ' On the one hand , you ' re a hero because you saved a life , but you have to remember how exposed you were -- and that if you keep doing_it , we ' re going to have to go_to your funeral. ' &quot; Accidental Shootings The driver looked dangerous -- a druggie or &quot; a mental_case &quot; -- and he fit the description of a wanted burglar , the officer thought as he pulled_up behind a parked van . But , as commanders later concluded , the biggest threat that day in Canoga Park five years ago was not the burglary suspect , but a cop with a shotgun . His gun trained , the officer ordered the man out of the van . Then the scene turned violent . As the suspect struggled with a second officer , the officer leaned his gun against a car bumper and ran_over to help . When the gun was jostled , it fell and discharged , flattening one of the van ' s tires . No one was hurt , but the chief ordered disciplinary action , saying the officer ' s &quot; handling of the shotgun presented more of a threat to the officers than the suspect himself. &quot; Despite vigorous firearms training , accidental shootings remain a vexing problem : LAPD officers are disciplined at a rate of nearly two a month for unintentionally firing their weapons , and that rate climbed 60 % for the first six months of 1993 . The department has completed investigations into 96 accidental shootings since 1989 -- all but 20 of them on_duty . Virtually all led to discipline , usually for negligence . Stressful as police work is , department officials characterize most accidental shootings as inexcusable . &quot; Some , &quot; said Skaggs of the police union , &quot; are just stupidity. &quot; Consider some cases resulting in discipline : A SWAT team member , giving an equipment briefing to a visiting delegation of South_Korean dignitaries , saw a visitor handling a . 45-caliber pistol and tried to reactivate the safety . Instead , the officer fired a bullet into a nearby car . An off-duty officer fell_asleep at the wheel in Irvine with his hand on his gun , which was_on the seat . Then he ran_into a fence and shot himself in the leg . LAPD officials said the gun should have remained holstered . After the slaying of a detective , officers were assigned to guard the victim ' s Studio City home . One officer perused a commemorative rifle hung above the TV . But he did not check to see if it was loaded , and he fired a round through a painting . Gates sternly noted that the officer was &quot; assigned to protect the residence , not manhandle ( the slain detective ' s ) treasured belongings. &quot; Sometimes a stumbled step -- or a sudden alarm , or an elbow from a struggling suspect -- has been enough to prompt an officer to fire accidentally . Other times , officers have been cleaning their guns , or putting them away , or drinking and horsing_around with friends . Usually , records show , the officers broke a &quot; cardinal rule , &quot; putting a finger on the trigger before there was any need to fire . Their bullets have landed everywhere -- in soda machines , in parked cars , in police_station lockers and in frat-house walls . Usually , tragedy has been averted -- such_as last year when a stray bullet from an officer ' s gun lodged_in a bedroom floor just a_few feet from a sleeping 15-year-old girl . But other officers have not been so lucky . At least 17 times since 1989 , LAPD officers have accidentally wounded themselves or others . Two others have been killed . Marion Jminer Gray , a 52-year-old Compton woman who cares_for her schizophrenic brother , remembers the horror of seeing him lying_in their mother ' s garage one morning four years ago , shot in the leg by an LAPD officer . City officials termed the shooting an accident : Three officers , they said , were trying to calm the man and bring him to a medical facility . But as he resisted and tried to shut a garage door on them , one officer accidentally fired his gun . The officer was disciplined , the city agreed to pay the family $ 65 # 000 to cover the victim ' s injuries , and the case quietly went_away . But , looking_back , Gray still does not understand . &quot; He was all skin and bones -- maybe a_hundred pounds . All they had to do was grab him or something , &quot; she said . &quot; Why did they have to draw their guns ? &quot; Pausing a moment , she said : &quot; I just never thought they would fire. &quot; Crossing the Thin Blue Line ? In the last five years , LAPD officers were involved in nearly 700 shootings that have been reviewed by the department , and police officials ultimately ordered corrective action in three of every four cases . Here is a look_at the year-by-year breakdowns showing how often the department found that a shooting warranted no further action ; that at least one officer involved in a case needed training because of mistakes ; or that at least one officer needed disciplining . Year : 1989 Shootings : 152 No Action : 37 Training Only : 77 Discipline Required * : 38 Corrective Action ( Training or discipline required ) : 75.7 % * Year : 1990 Shootings : 164 No Action : 36 Training Only : 84 Discipline Required * : 44 Corrective Action ( Training or discipline required ) : 78 % * Year : 1991 Shootings : 130 No Action : 33 Training Only : 49 Discipline Required * : 48 Corrective Action ( Training or discipline required ) : 74.6 % * Year : 1992 Shootings : 154 No Action : 53 Training Only : 71 Discipline Required * : 30 Corrective Action ( Training or discipline required ) : 65.6 % * Year : 1993 * * Shootings : 94 No Action : 18 Training Only : 53 Discipline Required * : 23 Corrective Action ( Training or discipline required ) : 80.9 % * Total : Shootings : 694 No Action : 177 Training Only : 334 Discipline Required * : 183 Corrective Action ( Training or discipline required ) : 74.5 % * Some discipline cases also required training . * * Because of a backlog of cases , 1993 case reviews are complete only through midyear . From the Files The LAPD ' s internal reviews of department shootings include detailed critiques of an officer ' s performance , ranging from sharp criticism of an officer who shot an unarmed teen-ager , left , to high praise for an officer wounded in a shootout with gang members , right . Source : Times review of LAPD officer-involved shooting reports . Dangerous Mistakes The LAPD regularly cites its officers for errors in the course of shootings . Among several dozen problem areas , these were the most common in nearly 700 shootings from 1989-93 : 02 # 33 , 11 Mistake Shootings Bad communication 230 Poor planning 135 Failing to take cover 117 Accidental discharge 96 Failing to request backup 89 Splitting from partner 85 Fire_control / execution 67 Firing without immediate threat 58 Note : Some cases involved multiple errors Source : Times review of LAPD shooting records</TEXT>
