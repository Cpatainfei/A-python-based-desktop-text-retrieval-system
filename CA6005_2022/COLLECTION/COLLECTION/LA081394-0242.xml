   <HEADLINE> THEY TAKE AX TO ITALIAN GRAND PRIX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Italian Grand Prix was canceled by international racing authorities on Friday after local officials refused to go_along with safety demands by chopping_down 123 trees . The International Automobile Federation ( FIA ) said that it called_off the Sept . 11 race at Monza because it could not get a guarantee that the major curve on the track would be altered to slow the cars . The circuit is in a Milan park and the changes would have meant cutting centuries-old trees on a scale that outraged ecologists . Although a divided central government approved the work , local officials had the final say , and they refused . In Rome , Gianni Letta , a Cabinet secretary appealing on behalf of premier Silvio Berlusconi , sought a compromise . &quot; The race must be run and must be run at Monza , &quot; Letta said . He suggested that one or more curves could be added_to slow the racers down before the dangerous tree-lined curve . &quot; Attempts are being made to find another venue , &quot; said federation spokesman Martin Whitaker at the time trials of the Hungarian Grand Prix . He did not elaborate . The safety-plagued season ' s problems began at another Italian track , Imola , when three-time champion Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger were killed during the San Marino Grand Prix .</TEXT>
