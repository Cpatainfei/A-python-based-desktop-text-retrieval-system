   <TEXT> TELEVISION Walker to Leave Channel 2 : Amid speculation that KCBS Channel 2 is about to lay out a fortune to steal anchor Ann Martin from KABC Channel 7 , current KCBS anchor Bree Walker has announced that she is leaving the station and local news behind . Walker , who is_on vacation this week and next , plans to quit the business when her contract -- which reportedly pays her around $ 800 # 000 a year to anchor the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news -- expires in September . She said she is forming her own TV production company to do reality-based programming , movies of the week and perhaps a daytime talk_show . She also recently did a_couple_of small acting jobs in the movie &quot; The Chase &quot; and on the daytime soap &quot; The Bold and the Beautiful. &quot; KCBS , which has languished in last place in the news ratings throughout Walker ' s 5 1 / 2-year tenure , has not formally announced the hiring of KABC ' s Martin , who will become a free_agent in about two weeks .
