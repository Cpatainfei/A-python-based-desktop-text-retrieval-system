   <HEADLINE> 3RD PARTY SURFACES TO CLAIM ARTWORKS RECOVERED FROM THIEVES ; LAWSUIT : FOUNDATION JOINS TWO SIBLINGS IN PURSUING THE COLLECTION OF THE LATE ROSITA WINSTON . MEANWHILE , APPRAISERS CAST DOUBT ON THE PAINTINGS ' VALUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a difficult enough legal puzzle when a second claimant surfaced to assert ownership of a collection of modern artworks worth , by some accounts , $ 9 million , that had been stolen from a Northridge storage unit and recovered . Thursday , a third contender appeared . FBI_agents and Los Angeles police_officers last August returned the artworks to Eva Smith Weisager , 86 , of Van Nuys , who said she had inherited the paintings from her socialite sister . It seemed to be a happy ending until Weisager ' s brother , Daniel Greenway of Baja California , sued Weisager for $ 1 million in Los Angeles Superior_Court in March , accusing her of stealing the paintings from their deceased sister , Rosita Winston . It was revealed at a Superior_Court hearing on Thursday however that the director of a New York nonprofit charity founded by Rosita Winston ' s late husband has weighed in with a cross complaint , contending that neither Weisager nor Greenway are entitled to the paintings because they rightfully belong_to the charity , formally known as the Norman and Rosita Winston Foundation . Adding_to the confusion were statements made by an attorney at the hearing that appraisers for the Sotheby ' s auction_house in New York now believe that six of the works were not painted by the famous modern artists to whom they were originally attributed . Thomas Cano , an attorney representing Weisager , said the paintings may be worth only $ 100 apiece , not the millions originally reported . Cano said in an interview after the hearing that Weisager had turned_over eight of the paintings to Sotheby ' s , but appraisers have refused to authenticate six of them . She turned_over a ninth painting to a Los Angeles auction_house , he said . Judges in New York and Los Angeles have issued temporary restraining orders barring all three parties from selling the artworks , originally attributed to modern masters Pablo Picasso , Edgar Degas , Marc Chagall and Eugene Delacroix . Kenneth G . Petrulis , an attorney for the Winston foundation , said that despite her claims , Weisager did not inherit the paintings nor receive them as a gift from her sister , who was debilitated by a stroke in the late 1970s . Petrulis contends that the paintings are part of Norman Winston ' s estate and should have been passed along to his foundation upon his wife ' s death . Norman Winston amassed a fortune as a real_estate developer . &quot; We ' re the owners of the paintings , &quot; he said . Petrulis said he has asked the Los Angeles court to transfer the case to New York , where the Winstons ' documents are and where the paintings were allegedly stolen and where most of them are now located . Weisager contends she received the paintings as a gift from her sister and brother-in-law before they died . &quot; I think the allegations that the lady stole the paintings are a horrible thing to say , &quot; said Cano , Weisager ' s attorney . Cano said the foundation has no legal claim to the paintings since the Winstons did not own them when they died . Yet it is Weisager ' s own brother , Greenway , who accuses his sister in court papers of buying a Ford LTD station_wagon with the specific intent of looting their sister Rosita ' s plush New York condominium of the artwork . Greg Halif , an attorney for Greenway , maintained his client is entitled to a share of the paintings ' value because he did not know the art existed when their sister Rosita died and he settled her estate . A hearing has been set for July 6 in Los Angeles . In a related criminal case , three San Fernando Valley men are scheduled to stand trial later this month on criminal charges stemming from the theft of the paintings from Weisager ' s storage unit . Police said that the suspects ' attempts to sell the paintings came_to the attention of a person in the art world , who tipped_off the FBI , leading to their arrests .</TEXT>
