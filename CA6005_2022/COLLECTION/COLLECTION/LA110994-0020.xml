   <HEADLINE> GIFT FROM AN AGING EX-PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The handwritten public note from Ronald Reagan that he has Alzheimer ' s disease comes as sad news to all Americans , whether or not they agree with his conservative political philosophy . The former President has performed a singular and courageous service in calling attention to this little understood disease of_aging . Just as basketball legend Earvin ( Magic ) Johnson did for AIDS , Reagan has opened a window into what was once a matter of family shame . Barring a cure , the incidence of Alzheimer ' s is certain to climb dramatically over the next two decades -- because Americans are living longer . Alzheimer ' s afflicts 5 % of people over 65 years , 20 % over 75 and 47 % over 85 . So it is hardly surprising that Reagan , although still physically vigorous at 83 , would be experiencing the memory_loss and other mental deterioration associated with Alzheimer ' s . The National Institute on Aging estimates that the number of Alzheimer ' s patients will grow from 4 million today to as_many as 15 million by the year 2020 , failing a cure . Local offices of the Alzheimer ' s Assn . around the country have been flooded with calls this week . That means the elderly and their families are getting the courage to obtain facts and help . First , a reliable diagnosis is essential : A number of treatable conditions -- such_as certain thyroid ailments , excessive use of multiple prescription_drugs and depression -- can mimic Alzheimer ' s . True cases of Alzheimer ' s impose an enormous burden . Families find themselves struggling to accept that a perhaps once strong parent can no longer function well and trying to find ways to provide sensitive support . There is speculation that Reagan was suffering early symptoms when he was President . Such speculation is pointless . The more important message is that he and his wife , Nancy , have stopped trying to paper over his lapses and had the courage to raise awareness of the difficult journey many of us will ultimately make into what Reagan called the &quot; sunset &quot; of life .</TEXT>
