   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SANTA PAULA ; RESIDENTS OF MOBILE_HOMES PROTEST TAX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 700 mobile-home residents in Santa Paula received a surprise from the Ventura County tax_collector this week : a bill for $ 25 to help fund the Blanchard Community Library . On Tuesday , hundreds of residents deluged the tax_collector ' s office with telephone_calls , complaining that they are not obligated to pay the tax because they do not own the land on which their trailers sit . &quot; When I heard the first phone_call , I knew exactly what had happened , &quot; said Cynthia Simmons , public_service manager in tax_collector Harold S . Pittman ' s office . &quot; I was here nine years ago when it happened then. &quot; In November , voters approved a measure that assessed landowners inside the Blanchard Community Library District a $ 25 annual tax to help pay increasing operating_costs . Simmons said that a list of the district ' s tax rolls was forwarded to Blanchard Library Director Daniel Robles and that it inadvertently included mobile-home park residents . In 1985 , when the library district was established , those same residents received a $ 5 bill sent to them by mistake , she said . &quot; We didn ' t know anything about it until the tax_bills came_out on Monday , &quot; Robles said . &quot; But if they don ' t own the land , they ' re not liable for the tax. &quot; New letters advising mobile-home park residents not to pay the tax will be mailed this week , Simmons said . Refunds will be made to those who already paid . JEFF McDONALD</TEXT>
