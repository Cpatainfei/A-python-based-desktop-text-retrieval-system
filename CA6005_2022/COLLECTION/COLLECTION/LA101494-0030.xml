   <HEADLINE> ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I read with disbelief Brian O ' Leary Bennett ' s suggestion ( Commentary , Oct . 7 ) that Californians look_to Washington for a solution to the illegal immigration crisis . As a veteran of Washington politics , Bennett knows the liberal Democrat majority in Congress will never allow a vote to exclude illegal aliens from any government program.I and my Republican colleagues from California have proposed dozens of bills and amendments aimed at controlling illegal immigration . Liberal Democrats have used every parliamentary trick imaginable to prevent needed reforms from being voted on , much less enacted . Similar legislation in Sacramento has fallen victim to liberal legislative roadblocks as well . California voters are rightly addressing the issue by placing Prop . 187 , the &quot; Save Our State &quot; initiative , on the November ballot . Prop . 187 doesn ' t demonize immigrants , nor stigmatize anyone . The question is simple : Should illegal aliens be entitled to free education , housing , medical and other government benefits provided at taxpayer expense ? The only answer that makes_sense is no . We can no longer afford to provide a treasure_chest of benefits to every person who manages to cross our borders illegally . If we continue this giveaway , we do so to the detriment of_our_own citizens and legal residents . For instance , the WIC ( Women , Infant and Children ) program provides benefits to only 75 % of eligible mothers , yet illegal aliens continue to receive benefits . Every illegal alien serviced knocks an American or legal resident out of the program . Suggesting that taxpayer-funded government programs should benefit our own citizens and legal immigrants is not hateful or nativist . The American_dream is available to almost a_million legal immigrants a year . Spending California , and America , into bankruptcy to provide benefits to illegal aliens denies everyone the opportunity America offers . And that hurts immigrants and citizens alike . REP .
