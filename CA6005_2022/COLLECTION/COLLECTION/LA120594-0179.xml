   <HEADLINE> WASHINGTON OUTLOOK : CLINTON DRAWING VISIONARY BLUEPRINT OF GLOBAL ECONOMY ; HE CLEARS PATH FOR U.S. TO TAP INTO VIBRANT ECONOMIES AS HE HEADS FOR HEMISPHERIC SUMMIT IN MIAMI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With his congressional victory on the world trade treaty behind him and a market-opening hemispheric summit convening Friday in Miami , President Clinton is compiling a more ambitious record of trade liberalization than any President since at least Harry S . Truman . This record inverts the predictions -- common here and even more so abroad -- that Clinton ' s election would give protectionists the reins over U.S. trade_policy . Today , the spearhead of protectionism is a conservative populist movement led by Ross Perot and Patrick J . Buchanan . ( Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ' s painful hesitation before finally endorsing GATT was a weather_vane of their growing clout in the Republican Party. ) And it is Clinton who is sketching the expansive , even visionary , blueprint of a new architecture to guide international economic relations into the next century . The first piece came last year when Congress approved the North_American Free_Trade Agreement linking Mexico and Canada with the United States ; the second last week , when Congress approved the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , which should cut tariffs worldwide by more_than a third . Potentially , the next two steps are even more sweeping . Last month , Clinton -- and Indonesian President Suharto -- steered 17 Pacific Rim nations , including China and Japan , toward a broad commitment to eliminate trade_barriers in the region over the next quarter of a century . This Friday , 33 Caribbean , Central and South_American_nations will gather at the Summit of the Americas , where they are expected to endorse a free-trade zone stretching through the Western_Hemisphere . Clinton can ' t take all_the credit for this . The GATT train began chugging under President Ronald Reagan ; President George_Bush negotiated the heart of NAFTA and fleetingly floated wider arrangements in Asia and Latin_America . But it was Clinton who carried the NAFTA and GATT initiatives past international and congressional hurdles to conclusion . And he has planted the seeds for agreements that , if fulfilled , would reshape our economic dealings with the world ' s two fastest growing regions -- Asia and Latin_America . &quot; It adds_up to a pretty substantial achievement , &quot; said I.M. Destler , a trade scholar at the Institute for International Economics . No one in the Clinton_Administration underestimates the practical difficulties of putting flesh on free-trade visions across Asia and the Americas . While Latin_American countries are generally enthusiastic about uniting with the United States , the frustration attending U.S. efforts to open markets in China and Japan could foreshadow what ' s ahead in Asia . &quot; Integrating the Latin_American countries won ' t be that hard , &quot; said C . Michael Aho , senior international economist for Prudential Securities Inc. &quot; The real problem is going_to be South_Korea , Japan , China. &quot; The United States is not without leverage in these discussions : Most Asian_countries want the United States to maintain a strong military presence in the region -- partly as an offset to China -- and enhanced market access could be at least an implicit quid_pro_quo . ( Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher suggested as much at the first Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Seattle last year. ) And the move toward new trade ties is rooted in the same force that is prompting developing nations around the world to deregulate their domestic economies : hunger for the foreign investment that fuels development . &quot; What ' s driving the quest_for open trade . . . is a very competitive culture of economic liberalization , &quot; said Commerce Undersecretary Jeffrey E . Garten . &quot; If it wasn ' t for that , we never would have gotten_to this point. &quot; But even if the Latin and Asian_countries are sincere , enormous difficulties remain in marrying into open trade zones economies and societies built_on such divergent principles . The difficulty of bolstering environmental and labor standards in Mexico almost sank NAFTA ; but Mexico is practically a workers ' paradise compared to Asian_countries like China , which suppresses basic civil_liberties , or Malaysia and Indonesia , which deny the rights of workers to establish independent unions in key sectors . Sorting through all_of this will take years . It ' s possible that such inevitably prolonged negotiations may become meaningless or even worse : an excuse for deferring action on immediately pressing problems , such_as providing greater market access for American firms in Japan or China . Avoiding such delays is one reason Administration officials understand that these efforts must demonstrate tangible progress along the way . In Asia , they envision advancing &quot; horizontally &quot; with regionwide agreements on questions such_as an investment code and harmonizing technical standards ; in Latin_America they want to proceed &quot; vertically &quot; by adding countries sequentially to NAFTA . No one can predict whether Clinton ' s successors will reach the finish_line of free_trade throughout this hemisphere , much less across the deeper cultural and economic divides that separate us from Asia . But with America searching for foreign_policy principles to replace the obliterated moorings of the Cold_War , even setting the goal provides order and direction . The prospect of an expanding hemispheric free-trade zone through South_America could reinforce economic reform and democracy throughout the region . In Asia , the stakes are even larger . Japanese companies are now better positioned than American firms to profit from dynamic Asian growth ; by unmistakably signaling America ' s commitment to the market , the APEC negotiations should encourage U.S. firms to follow the flag with investment and trade . At the same time , the project should preempt exclusionary efforts to form an Asia-only bloc , and reassure Asians that America remains committed to the region ' s stability and balance . Ultimately , Clinton ' s trade agenda will be judged less for its impact on political stability abroad than its contribution to opportunity at_home . The congressional fights over NAFTA and GATT underscored the skepticism that many Americans feel about lowering trade_barriers at a time when wages are already stagnant or slipping . Those fears shouldn ' t be dismissed : While economists disagree on the magnitude , it is difficult to deny that absorbing millions of Third_World workers into the world economy will intensify the downward pressure on wages , especially for American workers without advanced training and education . But there ' s no turning_off the globalization process creating those competitors in Mexico or China ; it would continue if the United States voted_down GATT and dissolved NAFTA . The real question is how America can prosper in this difficult new_world economic order . Any long-term project to lower trade_barriers adds_to the urgency of greater public investment in training and education ( although Clinton may have difficulty convincing the new Republican Congress ) . But unless America can export more to the rising nations that are manufacturing products that used to be built here , we are unlikely to generate new jobs to replace those inexorably drifting to lower-wage countries . Today , Asian and Latin_American nations are in the market for the ligatures of modernization -- telecommunications_systems , roads , power_plants , hospitals -- and eventually a growing middle-class will open its wallets for Jeeps , software and movies . America can ' t prosper without securing its share of those sales . At a time when protectionist pressures are growing , Clinton has grasped that main point . Notwithstanding all_the practical and political hurdles that loom ahead , he is clearing a path for the United States to tap into the world ' s most vibrant economies . If he has hesitated on other foreign_policy challenges , in this contentious arena Clinton is doing precisely what a President is supposed to do : attacking insecurity by confidently defining the future . Trade Trouble President Clinton is trying to broaden American access to some of the world ' s fastest-growing economies . Our economic relations with many of these nations are seriously unbalanced : The United States is running a cumulative merchandise trade_deficit with the APEC nations and those that will gather this week in Miami for the summit . Some examples : U.S. merchandise trade_balances , January-September , 1994 ( in millions of dollars ) Deficit APEC * : -91 # 712 Japan : -47 # 268 China : -21 # 089 Canada : -9 # 503 Summit * : -7 # 100 S .
