   <HEADLINE> ELSMERE CANYON PACT EASES COUNTY TRASH CRISIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In response to an article appearing in the ( Nov . 27 ) Valley Commentary section of your newspaper from Mr. George Pederson , mayor of the city of Santa Clarita , I wish to offer the following information to clarify statements made which I believe are either incorrect or misleading . First , Mr. Pederson states that the Los Angeles County trash crisis will be hastened by the approval of the agreement , which would remove the city of Los Angeles ' use restriction from the Sunshine Canyon Landfill expansion ' s land use permit . Contrary to Mr. Pederson ' s claims , the agreement will expedite the availability of needed disposal capacity by removing current and future city litigation which could further delay the project so that the trash crisis becomes a reality before the landfill is operational . Although this action may be considered by some to relieve the city ' s responsibility for utilizing landfill space within its jurisdiction , the county intends to continue with its efforts to encourage the city to assume this responsibility . Second , the board ' s approval of the agreement , which authorizes the performance of feasibility studies and preliminary design of a freeway interchange to provide access to the proposed Elsmere Canyon Landfill , in no way constitutes or implies any current county approval of the construction of the interchange or the landfill . The willingness of BKK Corp. , the project applicant , to finance the cost of these studies does not in any way obligate the Board of Supervisors to approve the landfill project . The county ' s interest in approving this agreement stems from the realization that the environmental review , design and construction of the interchange project would in itself be an extremely long process which would take years to complete . By approving this interchange agreement , the Board of Supervisors is avoiding potentially costly delays in the development of the project should the landfill ' s proponent demonstrate that the site is environmentally sound and technically feasible . Third , Mr. Pederson ' s concerns on the impact of the Elsmere Landfill of wildlife and ground_water supplies will be addressed in the project ' s environmental impact report . I believe it is premature to take a position prior to completion of the environmental impact report . HARRY W . STONE Director of Public Works County of Los Angeles</TEXT>
