   <HEADLINE> 500 # 000 AFFECTED BY MTA STRIKE ; LABOR : WALKOUT BY MECHANICS IS HONORED BY DRIVERS AND CLERKS , TAKING 85 % OF BUSES OFF STREETS . NO FURTHER TALKS ARE SCHEDULED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles staggered to work Monday , car-pooling , hailing cabs , hitchhiking and even walking on the first day of a bus and train strike that left more_than half a_million riders desperately searching for other modes of transportation . The walkout by the Metropolitan Transit Authority ' s 1 # 900 mechanics -- honored by 5 # 000 bus and rail drivers and transit clerks -- came_after talks on a new contract broke_down between the MTA and the mechanics union late Sunday night . Although unions representing the drivers and clerks reached tentative last-minute contract agreements , they decided to support the mechanics ' strike . It was the first shutdown of the nation ' s second-largest transit system since 1982 , when drivers walked_off the job for five days . It was a day of aggravation , uncertainty , sore feet and occasional violence by striking workers who viewed themselves as pawns in the MTA ' s desperate effort to balance its annual budget of nearly $ 3 billion . In Beverly Hills , three striking drivers attempted to hijack an MTA bus driven by a temporary driver about noon , police said . The suspects boarded the bus and threatened the driver with violence while the sole passenger aboard fled , said Lt . John Dunkin , an LAPD spokesman . Two were arrested . The strike ' s full effect on traffic was not expected to be felt until today , when more bus and train riders , having more time to plan , turn_to cars . &quot; A lot of people just didn ' t go_to work ; some people just got scared_off , &quot; said Jerry Baxter , director of the local Caltrans office . At the MTA yard in Sun Valley , about 30 strikers -- some with_children and dogs in tow -- showed_up to heckle supervisors and the others who drove the few MTA buses on the streets . Spirits were high as they hoisted homemade signs and booed the drivers , reserving special venom for service inspectors , who normally board buses at random to check on whether the regular drivers are observing all regulations . But when a popular supervisor was at the wheel , the taunts were more in fun than anger . Some strikers apparently wondered whether the tone was too lighthearted , lacking the usual militant union touches . &quot; Maybe we should all be yelling ' scab ' or something like that when the buses go_by , &quot; a striker suggested at one point . On Day 1 : * Riders waited for hours in vain as only about 15 % of the buses hit the streets . Because the strike was not called until after midnight , many riders were unaware of it until they showed_up at their bus_stops . Only about 313 buses -- compared to the normal 1 # 200 -- rolled on the 30 busiest routes and service was limited to between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Substitute buses included yellow school_buses driven by private drivers hired by the transit agency at a total cost of $ 160 # 000 a day . White_paper covered the word school and the MTA ' s &quot; circle M &quot; symbol was added_to the front , sides and rear of the buses . As the news sunk_in , some called taxicabs , which reported booming business . Some raised their thumbs and tried to hitchhike , drawing occasional cooperation from commuters . Others called friends , and many simply gave_up and went_home . Moaned one San Fernando Valley rider : &quot; I have to pray for a ride. &quot; Riders waited , both patiently and impatiently , for buses to appear at San Fernando Valley stops . By 7:45 a.m. , more_than 50 people crowded three stops at Van Nuys and Ventura boulevards in Sherman Oaks , a major transfer point . At Van Nuys and Roscoe boulevards in Panorama City , a man waiting at a stop shouted to a friend in a passing car : &quot; Come on , man , I ' ve been waiting three hours ! &quot; Lou Cline and his wife finally gave_up waiting and started to walk home from the stop on Sepulveda Boulevard and Vose Street . &quot; Every day we take two buses to the senior center at Victory and Coldwater , &quot; said Cline , 85 . &quot; We have our friends there , have a little fun , a little entertainment. &quot; Now , they said , they must stay home until the buses begin running again . Pedro Ocampo was at the pay phones at Saticoy Street and Sepulveda telling his boss he was not going_to be able to work Monday . &quot; I work in San Fernando , and I don ' t have a way to get there , &quot; said the 37-year-old gardener . &quot; I ' ll just have to see about getting a ride there tomorrow. &quot; * No further negotiations were scheduled . There were signs that the strike could be prolonged because the main sticking point -- the transit agency ' s desire to contract_out some work now done_by unionized mechanics -- is a life-or-death issue to organized labor in many sectors of the economy . Complained Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan , an MTA board_member : &quot; The mechanics , representing less than a third of the ( striking ) work_force , have disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Angelenos -- all_in order to preserve archaic work rules that reward inefficiency and cost taxpayers millions of dollars. &quot; Responded Joe Drouin , a shop_steward for the Amalgamated Transit Union , who was walking on a picket_line outside a bus yard in Downtown Los Angeles : &quot; We ' re fighting for our livelihood. &quot; * The lack of buses caused unusually high absenteeism in schools across the city . At Monroe High in North Hills , there were 160 pupils absent out of 1 # 300 . Just 13 students showed_up in one class of about 30 . &quot; A day in summer school -- because of the focus and concentration -- is like the equivalent of five ( regular ) school_days , &quot; said Thane Opfell , Monroe assistant principal . &quot; If we have kids out five days , that would be very hard to get caught up. &quot; * The attempted hijacking by striking drivers was the harshest action of the day . It was foiled when police_officers noticed the bus pulled over in an odd spot near Wilshire and San Vicente boulevards and boarded it . Five-year MTA driver Benjamin Leyva and seven-year driver Ace Brawner , both of Los Angeles , were arrested and booked on suspicion of robbery . Police are seeking the third suspect , who fled . &quot; We don ' t advocate this ; we don ' t condone it . We certainly regret it , &quot; said Goldy Norton , spokesman for the United Transportation Union . &quot; Sometimes people just do things they shouldn ' t do . We think it ' s absolutely the wrong thing to do. &quot; The MTA reported 40 acts of vandalism against buses and property Monday . The city ' s Department_of_Transportation reported that eggs and rocks were also thrown at DASH buses and that a rock broke the windshield of a Commuter Express_bus . On the Streets At street_corners throughout town , despair set_in early among the transit-dependent who make the vast majority of the 1.2 million daily boardings of MTA buses . Bea Alexander , who lives_in Hollywood and works Downtown as a secretary , was fuming as she sat in a friend ' s house , waiting for a car ride that would get her to work hours late . Alexander , a regular MTA bus rider on a line that runs_on Sunset Boulevard , said she watched the 11 p.m. news Sunday night to see whether there was a strike , saw that it was still up_in_the_air , then went_to_bed and rose to get_to her regular bus_stop at 6:45 a.m. She waited 20 minutes . Then another rider , listening to the news on a radio with headphones , found_out about the strike . Alexander said she was mad that MTA had not provided any alternate bus_service on Sunset , a main artery toward Downtown . &quot; I stood_out there with a woman with a walker who was trying to get_to a doctor . I don ' t understand what people think we ' re going to do -- jump in our Mercedes ? Call a friend at 5:30 ( a.m. ) and say , ' Pick me up ? ' &quot; People who ride the buses , we ' re already challenged -- disabled people , elderly people , handicapped people , hard-working people who get_up at 5 a.m. to get a 6 a.m. bus . To stand_out and get treated like this because we don ' t own a car -- in a city where no one should own a car -- is ridiculous. &quot; In West Los Angeles , Santa Monica office manager Joyce Cohan waited 20 minutes at a bus_stop before she learned of the work_stoppage . &quot; It ' s going_to be a problem , &quot; she said . &quot; I have no other way to get_to work. &quot; After waiting an hour in Wilmington for a bus that never arrived , Holson Chang Lee walked 4 1 / 2 hours before he reached his Crenshaw home . The security_guard , who got_off work_at midnight , reached home at 5:30 a.m. At 8 a.m. , he once again waited for a ride , this time to take him to the bank so he could withdraw $ 1 # 600 to purchase a car . Groping_for Alternatives Commuters left stranded by the strike were desperately calling taxicab companies in unprecedented numbers , often from bus_stops and street_corners . Some taxi dispatchers reported their business was double that of a normal workday . &quot; Well , ( the strike ) might be bad news to the bus riders , but not to the taxi drivers , &quot; said Belinda Esnayra , a public_service agent for Checker Cab Co. , whose business shot_up 40 % during the morning commute . &quot; It ' s amazing how many people depend_on the bus. &quot; Still , the wait for a taxi was often more_than an hour during rush_hour , and cab_fares were a far_cry from $ 1.10 bus rides . &quot; We are very , very busy , &quot; explained Mae Caringal , a secretary at United Independent Taxi who was helping_out with dispatching Monday morning because of the extra workload . All 231 drivers were_on the road Monday instead of the usual 100 at a time , she said . People on street_corners even tried to flag_down the Skycar service , which mainly drives travelers to LAX , said dispatcher Tylee James . &quot; There are a lot of very desperate-sounding people who ' ve got_to get_to work , got_to get somewhere , and don ' t have buses to do that , &quot; James explained , adding that his drivers are trying to help_out as much as they can . MTA board_member John Fasana asked employers to be tolerant . &quot; We ' re urging all employers to cut a little extra slack for their employees today . It may be a little difficult for them to get_to work , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re asking everybody to try to help each other out over these next few days. &quot; Riders on the regular MTA buses were charged 50 cents . Passengers on school_buses rode for free because the buses have no fare collection equipment . The bus system will operate only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m in the initial days of the strike . Service on the Metro Red and Blue Lines will be virtually unaffected , but the trains will operate only on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Blue Line trains that ran from Downtown Los Angeles stopped at the Willow Street station in Long_Beach instead of continuing to the southern terminus in Long_Beach . Long_Beach buses ferried train riders to the end of the line . The Negotiating Stalemate Contracts between the MTA and its three major unions expired June 30 . The transit agency reached a tentative agreement at 3:15 p.m. Sunday with the United Transportation Union representing drivers and at 2 a.m. Monday with the Transportation Communications Union representing clerks . But the Amalgamated Transit Union and the transit agency remained at loggerheads over the issue of subcontracting . MTA officials want to contract_out work now performed by union mechanics , such_as making parts . At a news_conference at MTA headquarters Monday , officials said it costs the agency more to have union workers make dustpans and mop buckets than to buy them at a store . Union mechanics are skeptical of the transit agency ' s assurances that no employees will be laid_off . They regard subcontracting as a union-busting tactic and say it could reduce their wages and result in poorer quality work . &quot; They put subcontracting on the table , which is definitely something we are not going_to agree to -- that ' s taking_away our work and giving it to other people , &quot; said Mike Bujosa , president of the local chapter of the Amalgamated Transit Union . MTA chief negotiator Gordon Krischer said , &quot; There are items that we can purchase for less outside than it costs to make inside. &quot; He said that under the proposal on the table , union mechanics would be given an opportunity to bid on the work . &quot; Let our own employees bid on this work , &quot; he said . The union also opposes the MTA ' s desire to reduce the hourly wage for newly hired mechanics . Nevertheless , the strike appeared to be affecting the Los Angeles Unified School District ' s summer program , in which about 65 # 000 students are enrolled . Idelle Thaler , assistant principal of Birmingham High_School in Van Nuys , said she was advising students &quot; to call_up all their friends and neighbors and family members -- cousins , aunts and uncles -- to try to get a ride here . &quot; The vast majority of these kids are here for very specific reasons and this is very difficult on them. &quot; * A DAY OF WAITING : There was no outbreak of panic in the Valley , but people were running a bit late . B1 * BUS_SERVICE : Emergency service has been set_up on seven of the Valley ' s busiest routes . Map , B4</TEXT>
