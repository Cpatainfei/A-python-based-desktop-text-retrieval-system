   <HEADLINE> NEW TEST SPEEDS DIAGNOSIS OF HEART_ATTACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An inexpensive new blood_test developed by Texas researchers could improve the treatment of heart_attacks and save as much as $ 4 billion in medical costs each year by quickly identifying which patients who show_up at emergency_rooms with symptoms are actually having an attack . The test , which is already available to hospitals , could speed the treatment of heart_attack patients and reduce the use of potentially hazardous clot-busting drugs on patients who have symptoms but turn_out not to be having an attack . Now , only 10 % of the 5 million patients who enter U.S. emergency_rooms each year with symptoms are having a heart_attack . Nonetheless , a majority of them are admitted to expensive intensive care units as a safety measure . Determining whether they are having an attack can require 12 to 24 hours , by which time the damage from the attack is complete . In contrast , the new test , developed at Baylor College of Medicine , can identify actual victims in less than two hours , leaving time to minimize permanent damage to heart tissues , the team reports today in the New England Journal of Medicine . &quot; Had this test been used as a screening test , we could have reduced our coronary care admission rate by 70 % , &quot; said Dr. Peter R . Puleo , a Baylor cardiologist . &quot; If this turns_out to be as_good_as they say it is , it will give an enormous economic and patientcare benefit , &quot; said Dr. Pravin Shah of Loma Linda Medical_Center , a member of the American Heart Assn. ' s Council on Clinical Cardiology . &quot; At the present_time , emergency_room physicians tend to play it extra safe , largely for medico-legal reasons. &quot; The new test meshes well with the current debate about minimizing health_care costs , said Dr. George Sopko , a cardiologist at the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute . &quot; With the test , one can eliminate quite a_few unnecessary hospitalizations , and therefore reduce the cost , as well as using existing health_care facilities more appropriately . &quot; What I like about the test is that it can be used in just about every hospital . . . it ' s fairly simple , it can be done fast and it should be helpful for physicians. &quot; Heart_attack is the single largest killer of both men and women in the United States . Every year , about 1.5 million Americans have a heart_attack -- more correctly called myocardial_infarction -- and an estimated 481 # 000 die of it . Fully 250 # 000 of those die before reaching a hospital -- in large part because half of all heart_attack victims wait more_than two hours before seeking help . Television and movies tell us that physicians diagnose a heart_attack by hooking_up an electrocardiogram , or EKG , which measures electrical activity in the heart . That can be true , but only part of the time . About half of all heart_attack victims display a peculiar wiggle , called a Q wave , in their EKG that is unique to heart_attack victims . In other heart_attack cases , the EKG reveals little . In that case , physicians must rely_on a detailed clinical history and blood_tests . The most useful test looks_for the presence of an enzyme called CK-MB that leaks into blood from damaged heart tissues . Existing tests for CK-MB take_five to six hours and are about 50 % accurate in diagnosing heart_attacks . Because of this lag in diagnosis , many patients with chest_pain are admitted to intensive care by physicians practicing what Loma Linda ' s Shah calls &quot; defensive medicine. &quot; No more_than 30 % of those admitted are having heart_attacks . Studies have shown that the cost of this excess hospitalization is about $ 4 billion a year . Dr. Robert Roberts and his colleagues at Baylor have developed a new , 25-minute test that can detect an unusual form of CK-MB produced in heart_attacks at the extremely low concentrations present shortly after an attack . The test is manufactured by Helena Laboratories Inc. of Beaumont , Tex. , and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for monitoring the progress of heart_attack victims . Roberts , Puleo and their colleagues studied 1 # 110 patients who came_to the emergency_room of Ben Taub General Hospital in Houston with heart symptoms , testing blood for CK-MB every 30 to 60 minutes for at least six hours . They found that it was 93.9 % accurate in identifying those patients who had heart_attacks , compared to only 48 % for the conventional CK-MB test . It was 96.2 % accurate in identifying those who did not have a heart_attack . &quot; Until now , &quot; Roberts said , &quot; we had no great reason to make a diagnosis in two to four hours because we didn ' t have treatments . Now we know that time is muscle and we have clot-busters to save ( heart ) muscle , so we have a greater impetus for early diagnosis . This allows us to do it. &quot;</TEXT>
