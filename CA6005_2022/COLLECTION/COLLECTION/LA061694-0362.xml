   <HEADLINE> EARTHWATCH : A MIRACLE OF NATURE A SHORT VOYAGE AWAY ; * SEA_LIONS AND ELEPHANT_SEALS , ONCE HUNTED TO BRINK OF EXTINCTION , NOW THRIVE ON SAN MIGUEL ISLAND BREEDING GROUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Are you willing to trek 17 miles round_trip over a desert island just to see a miracle of nature ? Here ' s an incentive : There ' s a huge cast of pinnipeds involved . No , they ' re not L . Frank Baum creations , but sea_lions and elephant_seals -- about 50 # 000 of them , the largest aggregation anywhere in the world . And they were rescued from near extinction , it turns_out , right off our local shores , during our lifetime . Had I tried to find them during my Boy_Scout days , there would only have been a_few hundred alive . Though you can nearly see the island domain of these large dramatic beasts from the Ventura Pier , you can ' t go watch them &quot; haul out and pup , &quot; as the experts term it , unless you make arrangements with rangers from the U.S. Department_of_the_Interior ' s Channel Islands National_Park . Referring to a carefully supervised visit to San Miguel Island , which intrepid nature fans can arrange , Carol J . Spears , spokesperson for the Park Service told me : &quot; We want people to land and walk the 17 miles. &quot; This involves a $ 65 boat trip , which has to be booked through Island Packers , and takes a full day . You cannot do this with your own boat , by the way , because cruising near the island shore where the animals mate is against federal law . But what you ' ll see , if you make the proper arrangements , is unique in the world , according to Dr. Robert L . DeLong of the National Marine Mammal Laboratory , a unit of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . &quot; I ' ve worked in the Channel Islands for all_of my career , &quot; he said . But it wasn ' t until protective legislation was passed , first in the ' 40s and later during the Nixon Administration , DeLong said , that he finally saw an end to the indiscriminate killing of these creatures . The result , one of the unique reversals of mankind ' s depredations against a fellow animal , could be ranked with the return of the peregrine_falcon in our part of the world -- achieved by banning DDT -- and the restoration of the sea-run trout off the Japanese coast , achieved by voluntary limits on fishing . In the case of the local sea_lion , sometimes called &quot; the elephant of the deep , &quot; this was accomplished , for the most part , when we humans simply stopped attacking them during their annual mass breeding and birthing seasons . Besides San Miguel Island , the only other site of such activity -- on a smaller scale -- is_on a beach in South_Africa . Folks used to come_to the Channel Islands breeding grounds to hunt the elephant_seal herds and their cousins -- the harbor_seal , the fur_seal , the Stellar sea_lion and the California_sea_lion -- for sport and pelts . Modern folks , fortunately , just want to watch in amazement as the largest of these creatures , big as Hondas and pretty as Jabba the Hutt , ponderously act_out their annual drama . &quot; Half of the 15 # 000 elephant_seals born annually on San Miguel Island are pupped prior to this week ( beginning June 12 ) and half afterwards , &quot; DeLong said . &quot; But in the 1930s , only a_thousand were born annually. &quot; The main reason human_activity near the pinnipeds is closely monitored during this time_of_year is that we can , just by coming too close , panic the sea mammals in their multitudes and cause pups to be suffocated or abandoned in a stampede . The rangers involved in the public ' s visit to the San Miguel Island watch humans very closely while the humans view the pinnipeds through telescopes , which are provided . My own interest in this phenomenon of man nurturing , rather than exploiting , a fellow creature , was sparked by Dr. David Suzuki . During a speech I attended , the famous Canadian biologist was worrying aloud about the widespread destruction of species -- an issue he details frequently in his PBS TV series , &quot; The Nature Of Things. &quot; Then he cheered_up and cited the few exceptions . Ours was at the top of his list . * * FYI : For information about a hiking visit to the sea mammal breeding and birthing area on San Miguel Island this month , call Channel Islands National_Park , 658-5730 .</TEXT>
