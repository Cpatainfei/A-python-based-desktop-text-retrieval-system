   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS AT SOUTH_POLE GET BEST VIEW OF JUPITER ' S SHOW ; ASTRONOMY : ENDLESS NIGHT AND TEMPERATURES OF 80 BELOW ZERO ARE IDEAL FOR TELESCOPES , IF NOT FOR HUMANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a frozen wilderness where explorers once died for the sake of a penguin ' s egg and chunks of petrified wood , Hien Nguyen is collecting spectacular images of a fire in the sky . At the South_Pole -- atop an ice_pack two miles thick , where it is drier than the Sahara and colder than parts of Mars -- astronomers like Nguyen this week are getting what may be the clearest view on Earth as Jupiter and a comet clash in the heavens overhead . While their colleagues at other major observatories around the world contend with rain , fog , pollution and viewing opportunities constrained by daylight , Nguyen and his colleagues at the South_Pole Station can be assured of pristine darkness throughout the celestial encounter . At this time_of_year , the sun at the South_Pole never rises and Jupiter never sets , because the station is centered_on the axis of Earth ' s rotation . As the death rattles of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter ignited blazing fireballs and dark storms larger than Earth itself , almost the entire staff of the station huddled_together in the cold by Nguyen ' s small infrared telescope to marvel at the sight before them . &quot; For the first time , the whole station felt_like we were together , &quot; Nguyen reported Tuesday via a satellite link . Nguyen , who fled from Vietnam to Southern California in 1981 , is among 26 scientists spending the six months of continuous winter darkness under the blue geodesic_dome of the National Science Foundation ' s South_Pole Station . Now a research associate at the University of Chicago , he is the station science leader . The spreading bruise of debris and superheated gases left in Jupiter ' s southern_hemisphere by Monday ' s explosion of a two-mile-wide comet fragment now rivals the 300-year-old &quot; Great Red Spot &quot; as the most prominent feature on the planet ' s immense surface , astronomers said . The red spot measures 20 # 000 by 8 # 000 miles . Two more comet fragments hit Jupiter on Tuesday . The white-hot glow from one impact -- that of Fragment K -- was at least three times the size of Earth . Starting today , three more large fragments were to slam into the planet ' s upper atmosphere , hitting the same spot over a period of 20 hours . &quot; You ' ll have three -- boom , boom , boom , &quot; said planetary scientist Heidi B . Hammel , who is leading the scientists analyzing the images from the Hubble Space Telescope . &quot; You are going_to have one heck of a mess. &quot; By Tuesday , the South_Pole Infrared Explorer Telescope ( SPIREX ) that Nguyen is operating had detected five of the nine comet fragments that had struck Jupiter , he said in an interview conducted via electronic_mail . &quot; For this particular event , our polar site is unique since the sky is continuously dark during the impact period , &quot; he said . &quot; Had this occurred during the summertime , our detector would be immediately saturated by the shining sky background and probably would not be able to detect Jupiter itself , let alone the explosions. &quot; Conditions are so extreme -- the temperature Monday was minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit , with 25 m.p.h. winds drifting snow over the telescope -- that the atmospheric impurities and water_vapor that blur most astronomical images froze_out of the air . The frigid atmosphere over the South_Pole contains less than one-tenth the water_vapor found over the Mauna Kea observatories in Hawaii , one of the best telescope sites in_use . Infrared_light , an invisible form of energy radiated by any hot object , is more easily detected in the bitter chill . Because the telescope also is more sensitive when it is refrigerated , the small 24-inch SPIREX instrument is yielding some of the most dramatic and important images of the impacts on Jupiter . &quot; The atmosphere at the pole is many times more stable and transparent than for the best mid-latitude infrared observatories , &quot; said John P . Lynch , the National Science Foundation ' s director of polar aeronomy and astrophysics . &quot; Because of the cold , dry atmosphere and the cold telescope itself , a two-foot telescope at the South_Pole might be comparable_to a 30-foot telescope -- like the Keck at Mauna Kea -- at those infrared wavelengths. &quot; &quot; That is an awfully extreme thing to say , but that is what the numbers show , &quot; Lynch said . The science foundation-funded Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica set_up the infrared telescope earlier this year as part of a five-year , $ 20-million effort to transform the pole into a center for astronomy and astrophysics . A larger telescope is scheduled for construction there later this year . Mark Hereld , the principal_investigator for the SPIREX project at the University of Chicago , spent two months at the pole earlier this year assembling the telescope facility from 14 # 000 pounds of parts , computer equipment and infrared sensors . In Chicago this week , Hereld ' s only contact with Nguyen during the comet encounter is an intermittent computer link that depends_on two aging satellites . The satellites have strayed far enough from their original orbits to be briefly visible at the pole every day , when they can be used as relay stations . Nguyen never expected to end_up at the South_Pole . He fled Vietnam by boat when he was 17 , leaving_behind his mother and much of his family . He settled in Torrance long enough to learn English at El Camino College , then received a physics degree from UC Berkeley and went_on to Princeton_University for his graduate work . He moved to the University of Chicago in 1993 . Eventually , he hopes to set_up a planetarium and a major observatory in his native country . University officials are encouraging the project . &quot; He went from being a refugee afloat on a boat on the China Sea to being a Princeton graduate , a University of Chicago post-doctoral fellow , and now science leader at the South_Pole , &quot; Lynch said . &quot; That is a real success story. &quot; * SEVENTH_HEAVEN : A retired telescope builder has his eyes on the prize .
