   <HEADLINE> NIXON , GRAHAM WERE CLOSE FOR 44 YEARS ; FRIENDSHIP : MINISTER WHO WILL OFFICIATE AT FUNERAL HAD THE FORMER PRESIDENT ' S TRUST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was during a game of golf at the Burning Tree Country_Club in Washington 44 years ago that the Rev . Billy Graham and Richard Nixon became friends . But Nixon ' s daughter Julie has said their friendship was well-rooted . &quot; It stems from the days when my grandmother first began to follow the ministry of Dr. Graham , &quot; she told John Pollock , author of the evangelist ' s authorized biography . &quot; I ' m sure that part of my father ' s feeling that he can trust Billy Graham as a man of God stems from his knowledge that Nana believed with all her heart in the Graham mission. &quot; The 75-year-old minister will officiate at Nixon ' s funeral today at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda . It ' s the same setting where , with the Nixon family sitting silently at outdoor funeral services for Pat Nixon last June , Graham eulogized that &quot; few women in public life have suffered as she has suffered and done_it with such grace. &quot; Graham and his wife , Ruth , became close to the Nixons soon after their first meeting , arranged by the late Sen . Clyde Hoey of Graham ' s native North Carolina . The two men became golfing friends and confidants . They took long walks together on Florida beaches , where Graham urged Nixon to run_for President in 1968 . The night Nixon won , he asked Graham to join his family in a prayer before leaving his hotel_room to face the media . Graham gave the invocation at Nixon ' s first presidential inauguration in 1969 . Graham also participated in events at Nixon ' s second inauguration and presided over White_House religious_services many times . He gave the eulogy at the funeral of Nixon ' s mother , Hannah , and offered a dedicatory prayer at his Yorba Linda library ' s opening in 1990 . Nixon often took Graham ' s advice . In 1960 , for example , it was Graham who urged Nixon to stay_away_from making an issue of Jack_Kennedy being Catholic . Graham listened to Nixon , too . In 1982 , when Graham worried whether to take his gospel to Moscow , Graham biographer William Martin writes , Nixon told him : &quot; Billy , you know I believe_in taking big risks . This is a big risk , but I believe that in the long_run it will be for the benefit of the gospel you preach. &quot; Graham ' s adoration for Nixon remained_firm even in the face of criticism that he should have done more to influence Nixon on Vietnam and should have distanced himself during Watergate . Watergate did become a sore point for Graham , especially after he heard Nixon on the White_House tapes . Graham told biographer Marshal Frady : &quot; I ' d had a real love for ( Nixon ) . He ' d always been very attentive to his friends , he never forgot a birthday . He seemed to love his country , love his children , love Pat . But then the way it sounded on those tapes -- it was all something totally foreign to me in him . He was just suddenly somebody else. &quot; But Graham stood firmly by Nixon ' s side , and they remained close after Nixon was forced to resign . When they would meet , though , Nixon would always apologize for his language on the tapes , Graham says : &quot; It was the first thing he ' d mention. &quot; When Graham spoke at Pat Nixon ' s funeral , there was never any doubt that the family would ask him to return when it was time for the solemn occasion of the burial of his friend . His statement about Nixon ' s death : It &quot; marks the end of a remarkable career which touched the lives of people throughout the world . . . . America has lost a great statesman , and I have lost a great personal friend. &quot;</TEXT>
