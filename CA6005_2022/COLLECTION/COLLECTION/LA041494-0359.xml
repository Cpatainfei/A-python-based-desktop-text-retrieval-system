   <HEADLINE> BRIEFING BOOK / BETH KNOBEL : INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; UNPAID ENERGY BILLS SPLIT RUSSIA , NEIGHBORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ISSUE : Russia , the world ' s largest energy exporter , is turning_up the heat on countries that won ' t pay their power bills . Russia ' s cash-strapped neighbors in the Baltics and the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) are the worst offenders : Ukraine owes Russia nearly $ 3.5 billion for energy , including $ 900 million for natural_gas ; Belarus owes $ 240 million and tiny Latvia owes $ 23 million for Russian natural_gas . In early March , Russia tightened the screws and cut gas supplies to Ukraine and Belarus by up_to 65 % as a warning to all its debtors to pay_up . Russia argues that its whole energy sector risks paralysis if , due_to delays in payment , it lacks the cash to buy needed equipment and pay workers . BACKGROUND : When the Soviet_Union split_up in 1991 , many of the successor states were left with few energy resources . They turned_to the same place for oil and gas as they had in Soviet times -- Mother Russia , rich with 10 % of the world ' s known oil reserves and nearly 40 % of its natural_gas . At first , Russia continued to sell its neighbors the heavily subsidized petroleum that fueled their economies in Soviet days . But under prodding from Western monetary institutions , and to compensate for a slide in overall production that has worsened every year since 1987 , Russia has raised its prices for oil and gas exports nearly to world market levels . Accordingly , Commonwealth and Baltic nations are buying less Russian energy . Russian deliveries of oil to CIS nations dropped a hefty 47 % in 1993 compared with 1992 levels , falling to 40.4 million tons , and gas sales slipped_by 17 % to 80 billion cubic_meters . Many government-owned factories in the former Soviet nations have been closed due_to the energy crisis , and the shutdowns hinder these countries ' ability to pay_for the oil and gas they buy from Russia . In Ukraine , for instance , where industrial production fell 30 % last year , a senior official said the gas cutoff was like &quot; a bomb exploding on Ukraine. &quot; Russia , too , is caught in a vicious_circle . It says it cannot keep the pumps running unless customers pay their tabs . &quot; The total of non-payments has taken_on such huge proportions that in the near future . . . it could completely paralyze economic activities on the part of energy sector enterprises , &quot; the Russian energy ministry said . OUTLOOK : Having flexed its muscles , Russia restored most of the flow of gas to Ukraine and Belarus in mid-March -- but gave its neighbors until April 10 to pay_up or face another shut-off . Ukraine dispatched a high-level delegation to Moscow for talks with Russian officials , which began last Friday and are still under way , in hopes of resolving the non-payments crisis . An earlier round of talks , held_in March , failed to draw_up a payment plan acceptable to both sides . Belarus and Moldova have also been negotiating with Gazprom , Russia ' s gas-producing monopoly . To show their good_faith , Ukraine and Belarus each made payments of about $ 100 million toward their outstanding energy tabs . But they are going_to have to come_up with more_than that to satisfy the Russians in the long term . Because they are short on cash , Ukraine and Belarus -- like the other debtor nations -- are likely to turn_to two sources for financing . First , they will try to barter food , ships and industrial equipment for energy . &quot; We can supply Russia with various manufactured goods , &quot; Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk explained last month . &quot; Russian enterprises cannot buy them because they themselves have no money. &quot; The republic of Moldova has already agreed to send Gazprom $ 25 million dollars worth of fruit , vegetables and other agricultural products as part of its gas payment . Second , the former Soviet states will continue to seek Western loans and credits . As a stopgap , international institutions and individual nations have given aid to these debtor nations to buy energy in the past . STRATEGY : Countries buying Russian energy are looking_for other , cheaper sources . In the short run , some countries have turned_to other former Soviet producers for help . Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have energy to sell . But that ' s only a partial solution because those producers also won ' t tolerate late payments . In February , for instance , Turkmenistan cut_off gas supplies to Ukraine for non-payment of a $ 700-million gas bill . In the long_run , Commonwealth and Baltic nations are trying to boost their own energy production . Some countries , such_as Lithuania , are working to develop untapped sources of oil and gas . Others , such_as Armenia and Ukraine , are turning_to nuclear_energy . Ukraine , for instance , was to have closed the Chernobyl power_plant -- scene of the world ' s worst nuclear accident in 1986 -- last year . But the Ukrainian parliament voted to keep the plant open , even though it is acknowledged to be dangerous , and to beef_up other nuclear facilities . Last Friday , the United States said Ukraine had agreed to speed_up the closing of Chernobyl , that the shutdown could come as soon as this summer . But the Ukrainians say it may take them until 1998 to secure enough alternative_energy resources to be able to do without power from Chernobyl .</TEXT>
