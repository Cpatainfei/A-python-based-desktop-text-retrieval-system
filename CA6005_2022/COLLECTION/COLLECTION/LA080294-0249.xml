   <HEADLINE> FDA PANEL CITES POSSIBLE ABUSE OF NICOTINE SPRAY ; REGULATION : ADVISORY GROUP SAYS THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE , EXPERIMENTAL NASAL THERAPY CAN BE AS ADDICTIVE AS CIGARETTES . STRICT CONTROLS ARE URGED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An experimental nicotine nasal spray designed to help smokers quit cigarettes can be just as difficult for some to stop using as cigarettes , a federal advisory panel said Monday -- a conclusion that likely will weigh heavily in the current debate over regulating cigarettes . The Food and Drug Administration ' s drug_abuse advisory committee , which today will directly address the issue of whether nicotine is addictive and at what doses , said that the nasal spray has significant potential for abuse . It recommended that it be strictly controlled , if approved . Committee_members urged that the spray be available only by prescription , and that the label carry strong warnings about potential abuse . They also recommended that there be a limit on the number of refills available to users . The panel Monday listened to considerable data about nicotine withdrawal , as well as more_than a dozen case studies of patients in research studies who were able to give_up cigarettes by using the spray -- but then did not want to give_up the spray . &quot; We ' re worried that we have found a new dosage form for an old drug_of_abuse , &quot; said Dr. E . Douglas Kramer of the FDA , who examined the histories of patients in one study who quit smoking but who could not give_up the spray . The deliberations were significant because the agency , which has regulatory_authority over drugs , has been steadily building a case in recent months that cigarettes are , essentially , drug delivery systems -- with nicotine as the drug . The agency already regulates nicotine in smoking cessation products but has never before attempted to regulate cigarettes . If the panel Tuesday concludes that nicotine is indeed an addictive drug -- and that the levels found in cigarettes are addictive -- this almost certainly will open the way for the agency to act against cigarettes . For the last six months , the FDA has waged an intense investigation into nicotine , tobacco and the cigarette industry to determine whether companies control and manipulate nicotine levels to keep smokers hooked . Industry officials repeatedly have denied they control nicotine in cigarettes for this reason . They have said they do adjust levels of nicotine , but only to maintain taste and flavor and to achieve consistency in individual brands . They also have said they believe nicotine is not an addictive substance . Research has associated nicotine with heart_disease and has shown that it affects the brain and the fetus . The debate over nicotine replacement products often has focused_on whether users simply trade one harmful habit for another . The health dangers from cigarettes , however , which include lung_cancer , emphysema and other respiratory ailments and heart_disease , come less from nicotine than from inhaling the toxic substances produced by burning the tobacco leaf . Dr. Richard Hurt , who runs a smoking cessation program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. , said the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal can include depressed mood , insomnia , irritability , frustration and anger , anxiety , difficulty concentrating , restlessness , decreased heart_rate and increased appetite and weight gain . The FDA ' s Kramer told of patients who suffered nosebleeds and nasal ulcers , but still resisted stopping the spray and of one woman who &quot; can ' t bear the thought of being without it. &quot; After eight months of therapy , she had &quot; no temptation to smoke , but ( was ) hooked on spray , &quot; he said . The spray differs from current prescriptive nicotine therapies , such_as nicotine chewing gum and the nicotine patch . In the spray , nicotine is more rapidly absorbed and in greater concentrations -- similar to cigarettes -- although individuals metabolize drugs in different ways and at different rates . One dose -- two sprays -- of the drug delivers 1 milligram of nicotine . The average cigarette , regardless of whether it is a &quot; light &quot; version or a regular , contains from 7 to 9 milligrams of nicotine .</TEXT>
