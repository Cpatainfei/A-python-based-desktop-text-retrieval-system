   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : PACOIMA ; ORGANIZATION GIVES MINORITIES INTERNET ACCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the owner of a small nonprofit youth agency , Bee Hall knows firsthand how difficult it is to locate and obtain grants . When she got started in business two years ago , searching for grants was a time-consuming and confusing process , she says . That was before Hall learned how to tap into Internet , a computerized information network allowing people from all walks_of_life to communicate by computer . The network is a bank of information for all kinds of subjects , including grants offered by government entities and private_foundations . But gaining access to this network is no small feat for many minority business people , who often lack the know-how to take_advantage of computers , said Debra Santos , executive_director of Pacoima-based Keeping the World at_Peace Inc. , a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing computer_technology to poor and minority communities . Her organization offers access to computers that carry Internet . Computer training is also provided . &quot; The information age is creating tremendous wealth and business_activity that is bypassing the poor and minorities , &quot; Santos said . Hall , who runs a nonprofit youth agency called Youth For Positive Attitudes , raised $ 5 # 000 in grants using Internet . &quot; If you can write , then this system cannot discriminate against you , &quot; she said . &quot; There is no visual on you , so you can join in as a partner on projects . . . . You are only judged based on your ability. &quot; Internet started_out as a government funded military project , Santos said . Colleges and universities began dialing into the line . &quot; When the universities got_it , you had more access to information , so that people could talk to each other nationwide , &quot; she said . Internet also does marketing research , which helps would-be entrepreneurs draw_up business plans to help them get loans , Santos said . &quot; You can get the information you need to do a business plan in minutes , where it could take you months to research the data that you need to do a business plan , &quot; she said . &quot; We use it ourselves for grant writing , &quot; she said . &quot; We brought_in about $ 400 # 000 in federal , state and private grants , using Internet and other personal networking. &quot; Dannez Hunter of San Fernando has used Internet to help get funding for a documentary about Lewis Latimer , an African American who helped create the carbon filament used in Thomas_Edison ' s light_bulb . Using computers provided by Keeping the World at_Peace , he raised more_than $ 5 # 000 , which has allowed him to get the film to the second stage of production , he said . However , Hunter added , because the film , being produced by Creative African-American Productions , is expected to cost about $ 2 million to finish , the organization has to continue fund raising . It will use Internet to get_in_touch with people who may be interested in donating to the cause , he said . Some analysts caution , however , that Internet is not the solution for all minority entrepreneurs . Few businesses , for example , &quot; actually do a sale or a transaction over the network , &quot; said Mark Lottor , owner of Network Wizards in Menlo Park . Nonprofit agencies and businesses must still use other methods to get_ahead , including person-to-person contact , he said . &quot; And you still need to use your telephones and your fax machines , &quot; he added .
