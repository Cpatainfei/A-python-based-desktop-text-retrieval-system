   <HEADLINE> 112 TRAMPLED TO DEATH AS POLICE HALT INDIA MARCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A charge by baton-swinging police on protesters from one of the most destitute groups in Indian society sparked a stampede Wednesday in which at least 112 people were trampled to death , officials said . At least 500 people were injured in the panic in the city of Nagpur , Deputy Police_Commissioner Jawahar Singh said . Sources at the Government Medical College Hospital told the United News of India that the death toll could rise , as some of the injuries were very serious . Among the dead were 68 women and 28 children , said Maharashtra Home Minister Padamsinh Patil . He said they had been placed in the vanguard of a march that tried to break_through police barricades . Early today , Indian police said they arrested three leaders of the protest to prevent an outbreak of violence in the wake of the tragedy . Authorities also banned meetings and marches and stepped_up security in Nagpur . The deadly stampede was directly linked to the campaigns mounted by an increasing number of groups in this country ' s diverse society to demand the allocation of what they perceive as their fair share of government jobs , school admissions and other benefits . The legislature of Maharashtra state , which normally meets in Bombay , had convened for its winter session Monday in Nagpur , 375 miles south of New Delhi . An estimated 50 # 000 adivasis , members of indigent , uneducated tribes that dwell in the western state ' s forests and remote rural_areas , had massed under the banners of the Adivasi Struggle Society to demand that they be given &quot; scheduled tribe &quot; status under Indian law . &quot; Scheduled tribes &quot; are allocated quotas for government jobs and placement in state-run schools . At present , the adivasis are classified as &quot; other backward castes &quot; in the Byzantine hierarchy of India ' s many Hindu castes and other social strata . Such a designation , which by one estimate embraces four-fifths of India ' s 900 million people , entitles the adivasis to far fewer privileges than if they were incorporated on the list of &quot; scheduled tribes. &quot; Police sources said the trouble began when leaders of the protest insisted on taking a large delegation to meet with Maharashtra Chief Minister Sharad Pawar . When they were blocked , some marchers tried to smash their way through the barricades . According to Patil , male demonstrators pushed the women and children forward to pull_down the heavy police barricades and try to rush the Council Hall where the state lawmakers were meeting about a quarter-mile away . They also threw stones , Patil claimed . Police charged , armed with long , iron-tipped shafts of bamboo called lathis . When the marchers in front tried to fall_back to escape the blows , a stampede began , with many women and children falling_under the feet of the panicked crowd . Reporting from Nagpur , Reuters news_agency quoted officials as saying many demonstrators ran_into a small lane , which was blocked by a water tanker . It appeared many deaths occurred there , Reuters said . The quarter-mile from the site of the tragedy to the police_station was littered Wednesday night with torn clothes and discarded slippers and sandals . The area was cordoned off so the dead and injured could be evacuated . Prime_Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao , expressing shock and regret , asked Pawar , the state ' s chief minister , to investigate the incident . But Patil defended police_actions , saying , &quot; Not a single bullet was fired or tear-gas shell used on the mob. &quot; This year , the issue of job quotas has inflamed Indian politics from the southern state of Tamil Nadu to Uttar Pradesh , the northern state astride the Ganges that is the country ' s most populated . India ' s most downtrodden , including the harijan , or Untouchables , say they are only trying to get social justice after centuries of discrimination and oppression . But the priestly caste , known as Brahmins , and other higher-caste groups that have historically held power and prestige complain that merit is less and less a requirement for holding government_office or getting_into competitive government-run schools . By making caste a criterion for being hired , they say , members of castes that were traditionally regarded_as inferior or impure are perpetuating those stereotypes .</TEXT>
