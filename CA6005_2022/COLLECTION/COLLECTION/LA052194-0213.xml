   <HEADLINE> CRIMEA OKS CONSTITUTION DECLARING ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM UKRAINE ; BLACK_SEA : KIEV PROCLAIMS THE VOTE INVALID AND ISSUES AN ULTIMATUM . OBSERVERS WORRY THE CLASH MAY TURN EXPLOSIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The defiant Parliament of Crimea set_out on a perilous confrontation course with Kiev on Friday by adopting a constitution that in_effect declares the restive Black_Sea peninsula independent from Ukraine . Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk retaliated by asking Ukrainian lawmakers to proclaim the Crimean vote invalid . They promptly issued an ultimatum to Crimea to suspend its decision or face unspecified consequences . Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaly Radetsky warned that &quot; Crimea is part of Ukraine and we won ' t give it up_to anyone , no matter what it may cost us . Everyone should know that. &quot; Western and Russian observers worried aloud Friday that the fight threatened to turn explosive . One diplomat in Kiev commented that &quot; the only way Ukraine can stop ( the Crimeans ) is with the use of police power , and that runs the risk of confrontation. &quot; Jubilant Crimean deputies applauded and hugged each other after an overwhelming majority of 69 out of 73 present approved the bill restoring a 1992 constitution , which puts Crimea ' s relations with Ukraine on a foreign footing . Toward evening they went a step further by considering an appeal_to Moscow and Kiev to allow Crimea to move toward rejoining Russia , the Interfax news_agency reported . A worried group of dissidents in the Crimean Parliament warned that the vote on the constitution would lead to violence . &quot; I am very afraid , &quot; said Lila Budzhurova , an ethnic Tatar . &quot; This vote has put Crimea on the verge of civil war. &quot; The Crimean peninsula was part of Russia until 1954 , when the Soviet leadership made_it part of Ukraine , which was then one of 15 republics making_up the Soviet_Union . About 65 % of Crimea ' s 2.5 million people are ethnic Russians . Most of the rest are Ukrainians . Tatars , who commemorated the 50th anniversary of their Stalin-era deportation from the peninsula this week , number only 200 # 000 but wield disproportionate political clout . Earlier this week , Kravchuk cautioned Crimean lawmakers that they were going too far , and he showed some muscle Thursday by taking_over Crimea ' s Interior Ministry , which directs its police_force . In Moscow , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin said he had warned Kravchuk not to resort_to force against Crimea . He said Kravchuk had assured him that Kiev would stick_to peaceful means . But Russian television reports of commandos parachuting into Simferopol and tanks rumbling along Crimea ' s main_roads , though angrily denied by Ukrainian officials , added_to the sense of threat over the peninsula . Even Crimea ' s separatist new president , Yuri Meshkov , asked the lawmakers , most of whom won March elections on pro-Russian platforms , to put_off the vote , at least for now . However , the normally supportive Crimean deputies defied their own president by going_ahead with the vote . They also passed a law requiring Crimean draftees into the Ukrainian army to serve exclusively on the peninsula . &quot; We have no reason to fear Ukraine , &quot; declared Alexander Kruglov , a vehemently anti-Ukrainian deputy from Sevastopol , to his colleagues . &quot; There are 80 # 000 Russian Cossacks ready to defend Crimea. &quot; While Kruglov ' s numbers may be exaggerated , the involvement of any Russian paramilitary troops in Crimea would escalate the conflict . &quot; This will not only lead to a conflict between Ukraine , Crimea and Russia , it will lead to civil_war here , &quot; Budzhurova said . In May , 1992 , Russia ' s previous Parliament questioned the legality of Crimea ' s 1954 transfer from Russia to Ukraine , thus emboldening its Crimean counterpart to declare independence and adopt a separatist constitution that declared Ukraine a foreign country and provided_for Crimean citizenship and its own armed forces . That constitution , along with the declaration_of_independence , was withdrawn after Kiev issued an ultimatum . But the March elections produced a pro-Russian Parliament far less willing to back_down .</TEXT>
