   <HEADLINE> WORDS AND RACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I believe that Professor Kwaku Person-Lynn ( Voices , Nov . 28 , &quot; Language Keeps Racism Alive &quot; ) had something of_value to say . However , his manipulation of word definitions was truly outrageous . To begin with , word_processor programs do not provide extensive word definitions with the many variable meanings that exist in the_English language . Secondly , when I turned_to my dictionary ( The Concise Oxford_English Dictionary ) to see how it defined ethnic I was given the following : 1 . a . ( of a social_group ) having a common national or cultural tradition , b . ( of clothes , etc. ) resembling those of a non-European exotic people 2 . denoting origin by birth or descent rather than by nationality ( ethnic Turks ) 3 . relating to race or culture ( ethnic_group ; ethnic origins ) 4 ( archaic ) pagan , heathen In order to control our language we have to be aware of its origins . It is imperative that we know ethnic once meant a heathen person so we can ensure that it never happen again . Person-Lynn is just as guilty with his manipulation of word_meanings to validate his argument as those who use language to demean and control others . NANCY PERRY Santa Monica</TEXT>
