   <HEADLINE> JUDGE IMPOSES VALLEY ' S 1ST ' 3-STRIKES ' SENTENCE ; CRIME : BURGLAR ROBERT HARDY IS CONVICTED WITH THE HELP OF LOVE_LETTERS HE WROTE TO HIS GIRLFRIEND AND CO-DEFENDANT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only time will tell whether Robert E . Hardy ' s vows of eternal love for a woman he called &quot; angel eyes &quot; will stand the test of 30 years to life in state_prison . Hardy , a 29-year-old burglar with two prior convictions and a drug habit , on Thursday became the first_person in the San Fernando Valley convicted and sentenced to life in prison under the controversial &quot; three-strikes &quot; law . Among the evidence used against him this week at his Superior_Court trial on charges of stealing $ 15 # 000 worth of musical equipment and jewelry : love_letters to his girlfriend and co-defendant , 27-year-old Candice Bingaman . In the letters , Hardy not only professed his love , he offered Bingaman pointers on how to testify at his trial . &quot; I love you , baby . You hold the key for me , &quot; Hardy wrote in June from his cell in County Jail . &quot; My love for you will never end . But there is no way that I can do 15 , 25 , or 35 years . I just can ' t do_it , baby. &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Robert J . Schuit said Hardy begged Bingaman to lie for him on the witness_stand . &quot; The only way I can get_out of this is for you to say you gave Michelle the checks , &quot; he wrote . &quot; We didn ' t do NO burglary . You found those checks_in the trash . . . . Otherwise , I ' m gone_for good ! &quot; In the end , Bingaman chose a plea bargain over romance . She pleaded guilty Friday to a lesser charge of receiving stolen property and testified for the prosecution . She told Schuit about the letters , which she ' d kept_in her jail_cell . Jurors said those letters ultimately convinced them of Hardy ' s guilt . They deliberated less than three hours before returning the guilty verdict Thursday morning . By Thursday afternoon , Hardy was_on his way to state_prison . The jurors found Hardy guilty of burglarizing the home of a North Hollywood composer on March 16 -- just eight days after three strikes became law in California . Hardy and Bingaman were arrested when an accomplice , Michelle Spreuer , 26 , tried to buy tires with the stolen checks . Like Bingaman , Spreuer pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property . Both women are awaiting sentencing . Had Hardy committed the burglary before the law went_into effect , he could have faced a maximum sentence of 16 years in state_prison . Now , he won ' t be eligible for parole for 19 years , Schuit said . The prosecutor said Hardy is the type of criminal that lawmakers had_in_mind when they passed the so-called &quot; three-strikes-and-you ' re-out &quot; legislation . &quot; We named the three-strikes law after this guy , &quot; said Schuit . &quot; This is a guy you don ' t want on the street. &quot; A spokesman for the district_attorney ' s office said Hardy is among only a handful of Los Angeles County three-strikes convictions . As of Aug . 19 , prosecutors have filed 863 three-strikes cases . Defense_attorney Christopher Nance had argued that Hardy was not involved in the crime and was being framed by his accomplices , who testified for the prosecution . After the verdict , Hardy admitted to two 1989 burglary convictions . During a routine reading of his legal_rights , Schuit asked Hardy if anyone had threatened him or coerced him to admit his prior convictions . &quot; The law itself does that , &quot; Hardy mumbled . Judge Michael R . Hoff then sentenced Hardy , and he was handcuffed and led away . Afterward , Hoff brought the jurors back into the courtroom and told them they ' d just decided the Valley ' s first three-strikes trial , a fact that had been kept_from them . Several jurors reacted with surprise , but none seemed upset by Hardy ' s sentence .</TEXT>
