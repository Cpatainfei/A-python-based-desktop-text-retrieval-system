   <HEADLINE> STABILIZING WELFARE ROLLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Concerning the Dec . 16 article on the stabilization of the welfare rolls , the writer stated that the welfare levels may never decrease because of ( among other reasons ) the increasing number of adult and teen-age women who give_birth out of wedlock then become dependent_on government assistance . The statistics stated were of the rise in births out of wedlock this year relative to 1970 , which may or may_not have anything to do with an increase in welfare recipients since no statistics relating the two were cited . The information given and the way it was presented is fodder for those religious right politicians who demonize unwed mothers . I would like to make a_few points in defense of those unwed mothers who are_on welfare . If the fathers , who are half responsible_for the mother ' s situation , paid_for 50 % of the costs of the child , a lot fewer of these women would be_on welfare . Let those who have never had_sex out of marriage cast the first stone and pass judgment on these women for having_sex . No birth_control is 100 % effective or without side_effects . And , aren ' t these women doing exactly what the religious right would want them to do , that is , keeping their babies instead of having abortions ? Now that these mothers have made this decision , the religious right wishes to punish them by taking_away the help they need . How is a young_woman , alone , able to pay_for herself , a child and day_care on minimum_wage ? Let us not forget that for every unwed mother there is an unwed father who , more times than not , has shirked his responsibilities . PATTI HUDSON Co-coordinator , Simi-Conejo Chapter National Organization for Women * I offer a simple solution to a major disaster . Every time a woman delivers a baby out of wedlock , she pays a fine of $ 10 # 000 . If she can ' t pay it , she serves 10 years in prison , sans baby . If she can point_out the baby ' s father , the father shall be compelled to pay half the fine , or serve half of the 10-year prison sentence . If the unwed mother can demonstrate convincingly that the baby was the result of rape or incest , the father shall pay the $ 10 # 000 fine , serve the 10-year prison_term and submit to a surgical_procedure that will guarantee he will never father another baby . In family breakup situations , such_as divorce , when children are involved , the spouse that initiates the proceedings shall be compelled to take the children and provide_for their upbringing . Failure to perform adequately shall result in the penalties described above . At the same time , the states shall offer mothers and fathers a cash bonus , or a tax cut , for every baby delivered within the sanctuary of marriage . If it is a tax cut , it shall continue until the child reaches maturity as long as the parents stay_together and raise the child together . This approach is radical , but the magnitude of the problem has reached crisis proportions . When a natural disaster occurs , the government applies emergency_procedures . This is such an emergency , and it calls_for appropriate measure to stem the flood and rebuild society . SHMUEL ERDE Los Angeles * Your article on the GOP contract ( Dec . 18 ) explores myriad angles of what could happen if the basic welfare-state philosophy of the past 60 years ( that of the government ' s role as income redistributor ) , is to be diminished , and finds the prospect &quot; chilling. &quot; The article states &quot; more Americans are now living below the poverty_line , including more children since 1965. &quot; How should a working family feel after several generations of sacrifices into a system that swallows everything down the drain ?
