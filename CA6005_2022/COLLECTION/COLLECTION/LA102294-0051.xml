   <HEADLINE> CRAVEN ' S ' NIGHTMARE ' FINALLY GETS RESPECT ; MOVIES : HORROR FILM WAS A SURPRISE HIT OF THE TORONTO FEST LAST MONTH , SHOWING THERE IS QUALITY IN THE GENRE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All is not dark at the Wes Craven manse . Sure , there ' s the Poe-esque faux owl on the terrace peering icily over Craven ' s sweeping view of Nichols Canyon . And a very stuffed Rex greeting you at the door , in memory of his deadly canine performance in &quot; The People Under the Stairs. &quot; Not to mention such rarefied coffee-table fare as &quot; The History of Hell. &quot; But at the fairly adult age of 55 , Wes Craven is finding a certain sunniness to this horror movie business , which has consumed him since he stumbled onto it nearly 30 years ago . It has to do with the fact that after lo these many years , Craven has finally given_up bloodying his toes , as he puts it , &quot; kicking against the pricks , as Saint_Paul said . I think it means , literally kicking against the thorns . It ' s hard to kick against something that ' s obviously not meant to be kicked against . You should accept it . &quot; And the fact that I make horror films , there ' s always been a part of me that has always agreed with the worst of my critics , that this is a terrible thing to be doing . At a certain point , it ' s like , why ? You speak_to an audience . You express a legitimate part of yourself and of humanity . Why look down on it yourself ? Just love it. &quot; Indeed , his latest film , &quot; Wes Craven ' s New Nightmare , &quot; is something of a horror movie manifesto , declaring that yes , Virginia , there is quality in the genre , distinct from the masses of exploitation films and sequels that give scary movies a creepy name . Paradoxically , it ' s also a sequel of sorts itself , as the seventh vehicle for Craven ' s creation , Freddy Krueger , the monster behind the half-a-billion-dollar phenomenon known as &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street. &quot; But the latest $ 11-million movie doesn ' t just resurrect Freddy , who met his maker a sequel ago in &quot; Freddy ' s Dead : The Last Nightmare &quot; ( 1991 ) . It redefines him -- he ' s bigger , darker and more ancient -- and it reinvents the Freddy genre , busting it out of its largely adolescent prison into sophisticated adult fare that toys_with various levels of reality . The result was the surprise hit of the Toronto Film Festival last month and winner of a Golden Scroll of Outstanding Achievement from the Academy of Science_Fiction , Fantasy &amp; Horror Films . &quot; I ' m so glad people are loving this movie , &quot; says actor Robert Englund , the man behind Freddy ' s claw . &quot; I don ' t feel I have to defend the genre anymore . He ' s taken it to this whole other place . It ' s almost like ' Nightmare on Elm Street ' has been crossed with Robert Altman ' s ' The Player. ' It ' s a movie within a movie within a dream. &quot; * The premise is that the ancient evil that Freddy represents has vaulted the fourth wall , crossing over from film into the reality of the filmmakers ' lives . There and in the realms of nightmare and film -- society ' s collective dreams -- the uber Freddy wreaks havoc that jibes with Craven ' s own nightmares . In a scene with Freddy ' s first nemesis , actress Heather Langenkamp of the first and third &quot; Nightmare &quot; movies , Craven , playing himself , explains that Freddy was able to invade their lives because the story has passed_away in sequel-land , becoming too familiar and watered_down : &quot; When the story dies , the evil is set free. &quot; Death may be Craven ' s handmaiden , but not dead scripts . &quot; It ' s always annoyed me that many newspapers have called me the Guru of Gore , the Sultan of Slash and Slashmeister , &quot; he says in a soft voice , seated in the airy living_room the twice-divorced filmmaker shares with two cats and a dog . &quot; I ' ve always tried to put a great_deal of thought into my films . . . . I think most genres have 90 % crap and 10 % where people put their hearts into it . But in genre films , it hits you over the head -- no pun intended -- if they ' re really bad . Also , different criteria come_into play in horror films . There ' s an area they get_into that ' s almost unrecognizable as art to most people , where they ' re dealing with things almost Dionysian . And sometimes it ' s not a rational statement at all that ' s being made . . . about energy and rage . &quot; Sometimes I think you have to bring a whole different set of criteria to genre films , and most people aren ' t willing to do that . They ' re different critters many times . It deals with the painful . It deals with the verboten , the unspeakable . The insides of our bodies are released in ways that we ' re not prepared to contemplate . Our own mortality is depicted mostly simply by blood and guts . It ' s offensive to be reminded of the fragility of the human shell. &quot; Born into a fundamentalist family in Cleveland , Craven stumbled onto the genre after being miscast as a humanities professor at Clarkson College in Potsdam , N.Y. Craven ' s first film , &quot; Last House on the Left &quot; ( 1972 ) , which he made with Sean Cunningham ( &quot; Friday the 13th &quot; ) , was so vilified for its gore and violence that audiences stormed projection booths and projectionists cut the movie themselves after the filmmakers released it with a phony R rating . The film was a brutal and realistic depiction of kidnaping , rape and murder , and the experience pushed Craven into the realm of metaphor . * &quot; The first film was so painful , the emotions and situations were so real . . . I started to have a real feeling like if I don ' t get more abstract about this , I ' m prostituting myself or exploiting real feelings. &quot; Craven ' s most successful metaphor was Freddy , who wrested the filmmaker from cult obscurity when &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street &quot; debuted 10 years ago ( also introducing then-unknown Johnny Depp ) . He withdrew from the first &quot; Nightmare &quot; sequel because he didn ' t like the script , returning only for &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street 3 : Dream Warriors &quot; ( 1987 ) , as a writer . But even though Craven was Freddy ' s creator , he enjoyed little of the enormous profits stemming from films by other directors . He ' d signed_away his rights to sequels , and after nearly eight years of wrangling , Craven reportedly recovered $ 400 # 000 . &quot; I think that when it went public , things started to improve somewhat , &quot; he says . &quot; I started to get accountings and then when ( New Line Cinema founder and chairman ) Bob ( Shaye ) called me and he mentioned that he ' d heard over the years that I had various complaints . . . indeed , most of it was rectified in relatively short order. &quot; Craven says the days when his presence thinned_out dinner_parties are long behind him , and his growing acceptance helped net him his next project , &quot; Vampire in Brooklyn , &quot; which will begin shooting next month with Eddie Murphy in the eponymous role . But horror films have also posed a thorny problem for Craven -- he can ' t break_out of them . &quot; It so far has proved impossible to get those projects ( outside the genre ) , &quot; he says . &quot; You say the name Wes Craven , what does that bring into your mind ? It ' s a town of hiring specialists . There are some directors that do different kinds of films , but it ' s more the exception than the rule . . . which is unfortunate . It stifles the possible development of larger-scale artists in our culture because they don ' t get a chance to grow in other areas. &quot; ' It ' s always annoyed me that many newspapers have called me the Guru of Gore , the Sultan of Slash and Slashmeister.
