   <HEADLINE> LOSERS CRIED FOUL ; BAD GAME IN ' 90 CUP_FINAL MIGHT END UP GOOD FOR GAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To the casual observer , there is not the slightest connection between Olympic Stadium in Rome and Soldier Field in Chicago . But , to the soccer fan , the two stadiums are inextricably linked . Olympic Stadium was the scene of the last World Cup match , on July 8 , 1990 , and Soldier Field will be the scene of the next one , on June 17 , 1994 . Four years have passed since West Germany defeated Argentina , 1-0 , on a hotly disputed penalty kick to become world champion for the third time . And , because the Germans won , they , and not the_Argentines , have the honor of kicking_off the 1994 World Cup against Bolivia in Chicago 50 days from today . But there is not one Argentine who will tell you Germany deserves to be there . &quot; We were robbed ! &quot; was the cry heard from the presidential palace in Buenos Aires to the loneliest Gaucho camp on the pampas four years ago . Difficult to believe ? Well , consider this remark made after the match in reference_to the game ' s Mexican referee , Edgardo Codesal Mendez , a gynecologist : &quot; He should go_back to concentrating_on medicine and not carry_on causing damage to soccer. &quot; The speaker was Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem , an avid soccer fan . Menem ' s good friend , Diego Maradona , a player whom he had presented with an ambassadorial passport , went even further in expressing his outrage . &quot; There is a mafia even in the soccer world , &quot; Maradona screamed once his post-match tears had dried . &quot; The penalty didn ' t exist . It was given just to let the Germans win. &quot; For their part , the Germans took it all_in stride . While the_Argentines were whining , they were winning . Defender Andreas Brehme ' s 86th-minute penalty kick had made certain of that , slipping inside the left post , just beyond the dive of goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea . But did the_Argentines have a legitimate gripe ? Was Codesal wrong in awarding a penalty kick ? Was he merely trying to put an end to the worst Cup_final in history , an atrocious match that sent the crowd of 73 # 603 wandering off into the Rome night wondering about the future of the sport ? Four years later , those questions still are being debated . But no one argues the fact that -- no matter how bad -- the 1990 match succeeded in bringing change to the game . FIFA , world soccer ' s governing body , is notoriously slow to accept change , but the worldwide outcry after the Italia ' 90 tournament , and particularly the final , forced it to act . As a result , the 1994 World Cup promises to provide a more wide-open , free-flowing , adventurous brand of soccer . Rules have been modified to favor attacking players over defenders ; the points_system has been changed to reward victories more_than before . And , thanks to an abundance of top-flight strikers and the fact that most of the big-name defenders are past their prime , goals should , in theory , be plentiful this summer . But the nagging thought that a team could advance to the final by playing the same negative brand of soccer practiced by Argentina in 1990 persists . The first World Cup to be played in the United States is supposed to put a smile back on the face of the sport . The image left after 1990 was a pronounced scowl . The final was &quot; a totally unsatisfactory match , which was an affront to the game and an appalling advertisement for the world championship , &quot; wrote British author Jack Rollin . &quot; It epitomized much of what had been an undistinguished tournament. &quot; Viewing the match today , it is difficult to find_fault_with Rollin ' s viewpoint . The final was not five minutes old when Codesal reached_into his pocket for the first yellow card , cautioning Argentine striker Gustavo Dezotti for dissent . that ' s the polite way of saying Dezotti , obviously wound tighter than a spring , was yelling who knows what at the referee . Before the final whistle , Dezotti made a little more World Cup history . Germany attacked relentlessly throughout the first_half but was unable to finish its moves with any precision . Time and again chances were created , but each time the last , decisive pass was intercepted or the shot flew wide or high of its target or was smothered by Goycochea . Argentina , playing without four starters who had been suspended for infractions in earlier matches , defended resolutely and , as the game wore_on , increasingly crudely . At the start of the second_half , Argentine Coach Carlos Salvador Bilardo , who had led his country to its 1986 World Cup triumph -- a 3-2 victory over West Germany in a splendid final played before 114 # 000 fans at Azteca Stadium in Mexico_City -- made a fateful substitution . He sent_on defender Pedro Monzon in place of veteran Oscar Ruggeri , who was nursing an injury . Within 20 minutes , Monzon became the first player in World Cup history to be tossed_out of a championship match . It occurred in the 64th minute after Monzon fouled German striker Jurgen Klinsmann , who was breaking free down the right flank . The foul was bad -- Monzon driving his spikes into Klinsmann ' s shin in a crude tackle -- but it is debatable whether it was a red card offense . A warning seemed called_for instead . Klinsmann ' s spectacular fall had a touch of the theatrical about it . Reduced to 10 men , the_Argentines were trying desperately to survive the final half hour in the hope of sending the game to penalty kicks , where they might have a chance to steal the victory . In the 84th minute , however , an excellent pass_by German captain Lothar Matthaus found striker Rudi Voller in the penalty area with only defender Roberto Sensini and Goycochea to beat . Sensini stuck_out his leg , ostensibly to rob Voller of the ball . Voller tumbled . Codesal blew his whistle and pointed to the penalty kick spot . With a mere half-dozen minutes remaining , Germany had been awarded an almost certain goal . The Argentines were dumbfounded and protested long and loud . Codesal was not about to change the call . Argentina ' s only hope lay_in Goycochea , whose brilliant penalty-saving exploits had carried the South_Americans to victory over Yugoslavia in the quarterfinals and Italy in the semifinals . &quot; Saving penalties has very little to do with luck , more to do with intuition , &quot; he later told London ' s World Soccer magazine . &quot; A goalkeeper can do one of three things : dive left , dive right or stay_in_place . Often , you look_into the eyes of the penalty taker to try to find a clue . that ' s what I do. &quot; Brehme stepped_up to take the vital kick . The fans held their breath . Goycochea guessed correctly , flinging himself to his right and reached as far as he could , but Brehme ' s shot was perfectly placed and snuck in just inside the left post . Germany 1 , Argentina . &quot; I should have taken the kick , &quot; Matthaus said later , &quot; but I had problems with an ankle . You cannot gamble on something as vitally important to the nation as the World Cup_final . . . and I knew Andy would not let us down. &quot; There was time for more drama . With the seconds ticking away , German defender Jurgen Kohler was engaging in a bit of time-wasting down at his end of the field when Dezotti interceded . Trying to get the ball away from Kohler , Dezotti resorted_to a stranglehold on the German ' s neck . Codesal ' s reaction was immediate : red card . Now , two Argentines had been tossed_out and , on top of the penalty kick , it was all too_much to bear . The Argentines surrounded the referee , pushing and shoving and shouting . Maradona , who had been ineffective throughout the game , led the way . Codesal could have ejected even more players , but he resisted , content to give a yellow card to Maradona , bringing Argentina ' s total for the tournament to 22 yellows and three reds . Finally , it was over . The final whistle brought the_Argentine bench to its feet and onto the field . Codesal had to be protected . By the next afternoon , he was_on his way home and , before long , he announced that he would never referee again . Up in the VIP section of the stands , Argentine dignitaries fumed . Down on the field , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl cavorted with his victorious countrymen . It was left to German Coach Franz Beckenbauer to summarize the match . &quot; There were no doubts whatsoever who was going_to win , &quot; he said . &quot; For 90 minutes we attacked Argentina and there was no feeling of any danger that a goal would be scored against us . As I saw it , we outplayed them from beginning to end. &quot; Beckenbauer , who won the World Cup as a player in 1974 and became only the second man in history to also win it as a coach -- Brazil ' s Marion Zagalo was the first -- said the penalty &quot; was not the key to the game because in any case we would have scored , even if it had taken overtime.. . . 1-0 by a penalty doesn ' t give a fair idea of this game . &quot; We could have won , 3-0 . I don ' t remember a single chance Argentina had to score a goal . &quot; It ' s too_bad Argentina didn ' t participate in the game . They tried to destroy the game . They played a non-game . They were too weak to stand_up to us . Still , it ' s not up_to us to choose our opponents. &quot; Bilardo declined to comment about the penalty or the referee , saying only : &quot; Of course we are very disappointed , but we also have to be realistic . Going_into a match such_as this , against a team such_as West Germany , with four players suspended and others not really fit , was too big a burden for us. &quot; It was left to others to write what might have been . &quot; This was the first World Cup_final to be resolved by a single goal and it was also the worst final in memory , &quot; Ian Morrison wrote in his history of the World Cup . &quot; The game did little for football but there was one consolation : Had the_Argentines lifted the World Cup -- with two wins and five goals in their seven matches -- it would have been a catastrophe for the game . At least their awful approach to Italia ' 90 had gone unrewarded. &quot; Now , the World Cup is back . What ended in the Olympic Stadium in Rome four years ago begins anew at Soldier Field in Chicago 50 days from now .</TEXT>
