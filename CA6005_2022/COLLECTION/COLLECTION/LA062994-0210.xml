   <HEADLINE> NEW UV INDEX TO GAUGE SUN ' S DAMAGING RAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Weather watchers , especially those with a tendency to sunburn , soon will have another index to consider when planning their outdoor activities : the solar ultraviolet_radiation level . Starting today , the National Weather Service forecast will tally the strength of the day ' s rays in 58 cities , including Los Angeles . With ultraviolet_radiation from the sun now considered a culprit in a host of health_problems , including skin_cancer and cataracts , the new index will allow urbanites to take action to reduce their risks . The UV Index forecast will predict noontime UV exposures , when the sun ' s damaging rays are at their strongest . Residents of the sunny Los Angeles area today face an exposure index of 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 , considered &quot; high &quot; but just short of &quot; very high. &quot; An index of 1 or 2 indicates minimal exposure risk , with low-level exposure risk at 3 and 4 , and moderate exposure risk at 5 and 6 . Ratings of 7 , 8 and 9 are considered high , with elevated risks of sunburn and other damage for those not protected . The new forecasts will be available daily to meteorologists as part of the standard package of weather indicators that they receive from the Weather Service . The new program was announced Tuesday by the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- parent agency of the National Weather Service . The program is modeled on one started in Canada two years ago , with apparently dramatic success . Eight in 10 Canadians since have told pollsters that they are aware of the government ' s ultraviolet forecast and half of those surveyed said they have changed their behavior based on it by staying inside , covering_up or using sunscreen . In fact , the program appeared to prompt a boost in sales of such protective lotion . Officials predicted that by encouraging such precautions , the new forecasts might stem the dizzying rise of skin_cancers and cataracts in the United States . Scientists believe that the rise in such illnesses may be attributed to a progressive thinning of a protective layer of ozone in the Earth ' s upper atmosphere . They have urged steps both to protect that layer from further erosion from man-made chemicals and to warn people that they may be more vulnerable to the sun ' s damaging rays . In recent years , skin_cancer has become the fastest-growing form of cancer , with more_than 700 # 000 new cases each year . And 1.2 million cases of cataracts are diagnosed yearly in the United States , making the eye_disease the most costly single item in Medicare spending . Excessive exposure to the sun also is believed to cause premature aging of the skin and to affect the body ' s ability to fight_off diseases . &quot; This forecast is a public education tool and it ' s generally to increase awareness of the risks of exposure to UV rays , &quot; said Stephen Seidel , of the EPA . &quot; that ' s the real value of the program : It becomes part of your consciousness , hopefully. &quot; But a warning to all who have been caught in the rain without an umbrella : The forecasts are still in the experimental stage because scientists don ' t know yet how to predict with precision the strength of ultraviolet_radiation through such meteorological obstacles as clouds . Elbert W . Friday Jr. , director of the National Weather Service , said that meteorologists in his agency will use satellites , ground-based weather observations and computer models to generate a picture of a city ' s UV exposure at ground_level about 30 hours in_advance . Seidel said that the index should be especially useful to parents of young children , who face particular dangers from exposure to ultraviolet rays . Because children spend more of their time outdoors than adults do , about 80 % of their lifetime exposure to UV rays occurs before they turn 18 . And it is cumulative lifetime exposure to UV rays that appears to increase one ' s risk of developing skin_cancers or cataracts . The initiative may_not be a hit with everyone , however . Los Angeles weatherman Dallas Raines said that he will not use the new index in his broadcasts , because he does not think it communicates useful information . &quot; My time is so short on the air . that ' s the last thing I need is to take 15 more seconds out of my time just showing someone an index figure , &quot; said Raines , a meteorologist for KABC-TV . &quot; I ' m not one to try to scare people . I ' d rather explain to them what this means and why UV rays are dangerous. &quot; The Times begins publishing the index on its weather page today . Dangerous Rays The ultraviolet_radiation index is developed using satellite instruments to measure the amount of ozone in the upper atmosphere . The ozone_layer blocks incoming UV radiation but thin seasonally . Here is Tuesday ' s index for selected cities : EXPOSURE INDEX Minimal : 0-2 Very fair people may burn in 30 minutes Low : 3-4 Danger range 15-20 minutes for fair complexions Moderate : 5-6 Fair complexions safe for 10-12 minutes High : 7-9 Safe time only 7-8 minutes for fair complexions Very High : 10 + Danger range 4-6 minutes for those most at risk Source : National Weather Service , Times Washington Bureau</TEXT>
