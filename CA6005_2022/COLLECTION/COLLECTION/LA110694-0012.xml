   <HEADLINE> ON THE SET ; THE LAND OF SEUSS ; TNT DOCUMENTARY TAKES A WILD JOURNEY THROUGH THE AUTHOR ' S AMAZING LIFE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s so hot on the small sound stage where TNT ' s &quot; In Search of Dr. Seuss &quot; is shooting , you could probably cook green eggs and ham on the floor . It certainly isn ' t fit for a Cat in the Hat . Poor Matt Frewer , who plays Dr. Seuss ' wily feline , is perspiring buckets attired in a furry cat suit and top_hat . Kathy Najimy , who plays the inquisitive reporter in the documentary about the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dr. Seuss ( a.k.a. Theodor Geisel ) , looks equally wilted in a long black dress and high-heeled granny boots . But their spirits remain high , even after filming the big musical finale , &quot; Oh , the Places You ' ll Go , &quot; countless times . After a quick break , director Vincent Paterson yells , ' Action ! ' and Frewer and Najimy start singing and dancing to the audio playback . &quot; It was a lot of fun and hard work , &quot; Najimy ( &quot; Sister Act &quot; ) recalls a week later during another break_in the action . &quot; Who knew I would have ended_up a dancer in the movies ? This is like a big ride. &quot; &quot; In Search of Dr. Seuss , &quot; which premieres Sunday on TNT , is a wild ride into the life and career of Dr. Seuss , philosopher , humorist , humanist and author of such classic children ' s books as &quot; Green Eggs and Ham , &quot; &quot; The Cat in the Hat &quot; and &quot; How the Grinch Stole Christmas. &quot; Geisel died at age 87 in 1991 . The film eschews the typical documentary style of talking heads , film_clips and home_movies for a hipper vision of live-action and animated film mixed with song . Najimy ' s reporter arrives_at the Geisel home to get some background on a story she ' s writing_on the private Geisel and his public identity , Dr. Seuss . When she finds the book titled &quot; Open a Book , Open Your Imagination , &quot; the Cat in the Hat ( Frewer ) becomes her self-appointed tour guide through the world of Seuss . Scattered throughout are cameos by David Paymer , Andrea Martin , Patrick Stewart , Andrae Crouch , Eileen Brennan , Christopher Lloyd and Robin Williams . The real stars of the film , though , are production designer Tom Walsh ' s eye-popping Seuss-like sets and costume_designer Merrily Murray-Walsh ' s clever costumes . &quot; They are such magical reproductions , I think , &quot; Najimy says . &quot; I smell awards for these costumes and sets . They are truly brilliant , and I have never been one to gush over scenery. &quot; Twenty-one sets were created to bring the world of Seuss alive . &quot; They are not so_much recreations of his books as collages , &quot; Walsh explains . &quot; The whole show is a collage of 50 plus years of his work . We have been working_on the project well_over 2 1 / 2 years . It has been an ongoing collaboration of writing the script and conceiving the visuals simultaneously. &quot; Seuss , Walsh says , had an extraordinary use of the palate . &quot; He is absolutely fearless in his use of color and crayon colors , kids colors . He was a big kid who never grew up. &quot; The project has been celebration of not only his work and his life but his books , Walsh says . &quot; This has been great because we have been able to be theatrical like Seuss . It ' s not real . You are in a non-dimensional sort of space . In leaving it a little bit more free and loose , we don ' t have to make anything literal. &quot; &quot; The story we chose is not so_much him the person but his career as a writer , &quot; says producer Joni Levin . The challenge for Levin and writer Kevin C . Clarke was how to bring Seuss ' books to life , &quot; instead of just having someone read , &quot; Levin says . &quot; So we have all different ways . We do have Robin Williams doing a reading of ' Cat in the Hat. ' That made_sense to us . There ' s a dance number for ' Green Eggs and Ham ' and ' Oh , the Places You ' ll Go , &quot; which is the finale of the show . ' Yertle the Turtle ' is not so_much a dance , but an all-out musical number that ' s a gospel song . Our main goal was keeping the integrity of all his work. &quot; &quot; In Search of Dr. Seuss &quot; has been a very ambitious project . Perhaps a little too ambitious . &quot; I think the most difficult thing is that you have got 21 sets and some days you are_on two sets , &quot; Levin says . &quot; You don ' t have time for rehearsals because you are dealing with cameos who are committed for the next year-and-a-half and it ' s getting them for a day here or there . So that kind of pace is grueling . The turnaround of getting the set_in and out and not having that extra money for labor ... it always makes_it tough. &quot; Najimy acknowledges that she never read Dr. Seuss as a youngster . &quot; I grew_up very poor , and so any books that I had were rented from the library , &quot; she explains . &quot; They didn ' t allow Dr. Seuss in the library then . He certainly wasn ' t in the school libraries . You ' ll see when you watch this project that they thought he was too wild . They thought he was too risky. &quot; But now she ' s a huge fan . &quot; I do a lot of political theater , &quot; Najimy says . &quot; If someone can merge politics and entertainment , that really excites me . I think he does this . He has a strong_point of view. &quot; &quot; In Search of Dr. Seuss &quot; premieres Sunday at 5 and 7 p.m. on TNT ; the cable channel will also air &quot; Dr. Seuss &quot; animated specials throughout the day Sunday beginning at 6 a.m. and air specials throughout the month .</TEXT>
