   <HEADLINE> SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE ; OLYMPIC QUALIFYING HAS SOME SCRAMBLING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is there a fair way to pick an Olympic squad ? The simple answer is yes . Hold an Olympic trial and let the team select itself . However , this allows_for one-time fluke performances and sometimes keeps your best medal hopes at_home . Ask Dan O ' Brien , the world ' s best decathlete , who failed to make the 1992 Olympic team because he had a brain-cramp in pole_vault at the trials . For that reason , the U.S. ski team is correct in choosing its 22-person squad ( maximum of 14 of either gender ) based on overall performance on the World Cup circuit this season . On the ski tour -- where course conditions can change in minutes to the benefit of one skier over another -- holding a one-day trial would be unfair . Still , the selection process for the U.S. ski team , to be announced Feb . 7 , is raising eyebrows because of the strict criteria it has set for qualification . If the team were selected today , some of the United States ' top medal hopefuls would not be going_to Lillehammer . The list would include 1992 silver medalists Diann Roffe-Steinrotter and Hilary Lindh , and Julie Parisien , once the top-ranked slalom skier in the world . For the men , the qualifying criteria have been outlined as a top-eight or two top-15 finishes on the World Cup circuit . As of today , only Tommy Moe has locked_up a spot , with two top-three finishes -- one in downhill , the other in super-giant slalom . The criteria for the women are one of the following : a top-four finish , two top-eights or three top-15s . Based on the formula , two surprises on the women ' s team -- Heidi Voelker and Eva Twardokens , will secure Olympic spots . Voelker and Twardokens continued their success Wednesday in a giant slalom at Morzine , France , during which Voelker finished third and Twardokens fourth . Yet , proven Olympians such_as Roffe-Steinrotter , Lindh and Parisien are left to fight for their Olympic chances in World Cup races leading_up to Feb . 7 . This , of course , is the kind of competitive tension the U.S. ski team had_in_mind with the formula . &quot; It ' s an interesting situation , &quot; Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director , said last week on a conference_call to reporters . &quot; The top athletes support the idea , they support this concept , they ' re 100 % behind it. &quot; Even if it means leaving the_likes_of Parisien at_home ? &quot; Very accurate , &quot; Major said . &quot; And Julie knows it . Julie knows she needs to be a World Cup performer . She ' s had two top-15 results , she needs another top-15 result. &quot; While the ground_rules appear hard and fast , there no doubt will be room for maneuvering . Terrible course conditions in Europe last month wreaked havoc on the women ' s downhill circuit , making_it hard to evaluate so-so performances by Picabo Street and Lindh , who is coming_back from knee surgery . And while it was once rumored that Major was considering taking fewer skiers than the 22 allotted , he ' s leaning toward taking a complete team . &quot; I ' m unwilling to commit to that right now , looking_at where we ' re at , &quot; Major said . &quot; We have some weaknesses on the women ' s downhill team side and on the men ' s slalom side. &quot; Taking a full squad would allow_for the discretionary selection of skiers on the bubble . Major also said the team selection process would be twofold . He will take one group based on its chances of medaling in ' 94 . Another group will be composed of young skiers with projected medal hopes in 1998 . Those skiers would be selected if only to gain Olympic experience . &quot; Every athlete talks_about it , they need Olympic experience , &quot; Major said . &quot; They need to be able to go there . Tommy ( Moe ) talked_about it in ' 92 , how he was there , saw the hype and the pressure and how he dealt with that . So now he ' s going_to be ready for Lillehammer. &quot; That kind of decision-making could spell bad news for such veterans as Roffe-Steinrotter , the 1992 silver medalist in giant slalom , who has been in a slump since the Albertville Games . It ' s a tough call . Bill Johnson , the 1984 downhill gold medalist , was left_off the 1988 team based on poor World Cup performances that year , but he still argues he should have been named to the team based on his potential to win on a given day . There will be similar debate concerning Roffe-Steinrotter . Not ready to give_up the fight , she finished 13th at Wednesday ' s GS at Morzine . Major will be left to make the distinction between medal potential and sentiment . &quot; We ' re going to pick a hard line and stick_with it , &quot; he said , &quot; because we believe we have winners on this team . We don ' t just want to take people to participate . We want to take people who either have potential to medal in ' 94 or to medal in ' 98. &quot; Ski Notes Heidi Voelker has been promoted back to the Alpine A team after a month of outstanding World Cup results in Europe , including a career-best fifth in a GS at Tignes , France . Voelker has three top-10 finishes and two top-20s . . . . For the time being , Tommy Moe has surpassed AJ Kitt as America ' s best in speed events . . . . After a_few weeks of soul-searching in the United States , Jeremy Nobis will rejoin the World Cup men ' s team in Europe . Nobis , considered America ' s best hope in GS , has been a flop so far this season . For the sixth season , the Jeep / Eagle dealers and Chrysler are sponsoring a series of 14 free public ski_race clinics and race program at various California resorts . The series will include prizes and medals for participants . Skiers must hold a valid lift ticket for that day of competition . The event will be held at Snow Summit in Big Bear this weekend , at Snow Valley on Feb . 5-6 , at Mammoth on March 5-6 , and at Bear Mountain Feb . 12-13 and March 12-13 . Maybe it should come as no surprise in Norway that the first event to sell_out for the upcoming Olympic Games at Lillehammer , was cross-country_skiing . . . . Officials are hopeful snowboarding will be granted Olympic status for the 1998 Games at Nogano , Japan . The sport has already been recognized as an &quot; official discipline &quot; by the International Ski Federation ( FIS ) , and there are plans to sanction a World Cup snowboarding circuit for the 1994-95 season . Snowboarding will be a &quot; cultural exhibition &quot; at next months Olympic Games at Lillehammer . Skiing Magazine notes Snowboarding has a_couple_of other things going_for it : One , the Japanese , hosts for the 1988 Games , are nuts about the sport and , two , both the head of the International Olympic Committee and the FIS have children who are snowboarders . Next time you ' re in Aspen , see if you can bum a room off Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz , Saudi_Arabia ' s ambassador to the United States . In 1990 , the prince built a 55 # 000 square-foot vacation_home , valued at $ 25 million , that includes 15 bedrooms , 27 baths and 100 cable TV jacks . Feeling a bit cramped last year , the prince had constructed a cozy , 10 # 000 square-foot guest house .</TEXT>
