   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / ON-LINE UPDATE : SURE , THEY ' LL DOWNLOAD PHOTOS , BUT WILL THEY PAY FOR A TICKET ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the future , feature_films may travel directly to viewers ' televisions via the information superhighway , but studios have already started to use telecommunications technology to send their marketing campaigns straight into the homes and onto the computer_screens of potential moviegoers . In the last year , almost every major studio has done marketing for at least one of its films on such commercial on-line services as America Online and Compuserve . The studio ' s interactive kits , which subscribers choose by browsing through a listing of what ' s available , and then selecting and downloading onto their hard_drive , present basic information in tailor-made ways . For last summer ' s action film &quot; Blown Away , &quot; for example , users cut colored wires connected to bombs to read biographical information on the stars , look_at production notes , or view very short scenes from the film in a small onscreen window . The kit for &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; lets users point to a timeline to see various scenes from the movie , and Forrest himself even gives a multiple-choice quiz on recent American history , offering users a piece of chocolate when they answer questions correctly , and making such comments as &quot; Stupid is as stupid does &quot; when they do not . On-line marketing can give potential moviegoers more information about a film than a conventional print or television advertisement , and though the reach of such services is limited , studio marketing executives see on-line marketing as a key part of Hollywood ' s inevitable future . &quot; I think you have three groups , &quot; says Paramount marketing chief Arthur Cohen of film marketing decision-makers who are trying to evaluate on-line media . &quot; Enthusiastic people , people who go_along out of fear ( of being left_behind ) , and people who say we didn ' t need it before and we don ' t need it now. &quot; Cohen places himself in the first group , though he goes_on to say that on-line marketing ' s current effectiveness is difficult to measure statistically because of the relatively small size of the audience it reaches . Paramount and other studios including Columbia and Fine Line do much of their on-line marketing through Hollywood Online , a Santa Monica-based company that has emerged as a leader in the field . Using mostly existing media materials such_as film images and production notes , the company creates &quot; interactive_multimedia kits , &quot; which take about 20 minutes to download with a fairly high-speed modem . They can now be downloaded from Compuserve , America Online and eWorld , and Hollywood Online is now in discussions with other services about making them available elsewhere . &quot; ( The kits ) definitely help sustain word_of_mouth on a film , &quot; says Steven Katinsky , president of Hollywood Online . &quot; It ' s a very small investment for ( the studios ) and they ' re getting a very large return. &quot; Hollywood Online would n ' t say how much that investment is , although company officials and studio marketers agree it is still a very small part of a major film ' s marketing budget . The distribution package generally includes the creation and on-line distribution of the interactive media kit and the on-line distribution of downloadable video clips and still pictures . That distribution can vary considerably according to the public ' s interest in a film , and though the interactive kit for &quot; The Mask &quot; has been downloaded by more_than 3 # 100 users on America Online alone , the kit for &quot; It Could Happen to You &quot; generated just 300 downloads . A star ' s popularity can influence the number of times a film still is downloaded , and though a picture of Harrison Ford from &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger &quot; was downloaded an impressive 1 # 600 times on America Online , a picture of the comely &quot; Mask &quot; actress -- and relative newcomer -- Cameron Diaz was downloaded by more_than 4 # 500 people . A still from &quot; The Scout &quot; has already been downloaded 50 times . There are also other offerings for movie buffs . America Online , for example , also offers an on-line &quot; auditorium &quot; for hosting film_stars and directors who answer members ' questions ( Oliver Stone recently fielded softball questions about &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; on America Online , under the auspices of Wired magazine ) , and bulletin_boards dedicated to such subjects as new films , foreign films and Hollywood gossip . In many ways , the bulletin_boards are more of a forum for discussion and networking than part of a marketing plan , although they spread word-of-mouth about movies to an audience very interested in films . &quot; Sometimes Hollywood Online makes me want to see something more_than I would have if there are glowing reports , &quot; said Lincoln Kupchak , 24 , while on America Online . Deborah Baumrucker , who looks_at the information in Hollywood Online every couple of weeks , said that she saw &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; because of an on-line recommendation . &quot; Someone whose opinions I trust said it made ' Reservoir Dogs ' look_like ' Mary Poppins , ' &quot; she said via America Online . &quot; I guess it was easier than flipping through papers or news directories. &quot; &quot; We feel that we toe_the_line , &quot; says Stuart Halperin , the company ' s executive_vice_president of marketing . &quot; To the people on-line , we ' re an information provider . The studios view us as a conduit of entertaining information that can be viewed in a marketing sense. &quot; Hollywood Online started on America Online in July , 1993 , marketing &quot; In the Line_of_Fire &quot; ; it became available on Compuserve later that year . One of Hollywood Online ' s strong_points , said marketing executives , is the way it allows a self-selecting audience to find_out more about a film , and in April , the company ' s interactive kit for last year ' s &quot; Addams Family Values &quot; won an Advertising Age media award for informational on-line advertising and marketing . MGM , which has marketed films using Hollywood Online for almost a year , now gives an on-line marketing push to any film targeting the demographics of on-line services . Such upcoming science-fiction-oriented MGM / UA releases as &quot; TankGirl , &quot; &quot; Hackers &quot; and &quot; Species &quot; will be marketed heavily on-line , and the campaign for this month ' s &quot; Stargate &quot; will include an interactive kit from Hollywood Online . Moviegoing cybernauts have several places to go_for on-line film information , though Hollywood Online is the most marketing-oriented of their options . Compuserve ' s Entertainment Drive Forum , an information provider positioned as the &quot; Entertainment Tonight &quot; of cyberspace , maintains entertainment-oriented bulletin_boards and provides downloadable video clips and still images from films . The forum , which has registered more_than 53 # 000 members since launching in March , according to executive producer and president Michael Bolanos , makes a portion of the money people spend using its services , although it also gets money from studios to defray the cost of digitizing film_clips . Prodigy , which has about 2 million members , offers on-line celebrity press_conferences and an entertainment area that includes movie reviews , a movie guide and a poll of members ' reactions to films . Delphi has fewer users , but its recent purchase by Rupert Murdoch ' s News Corp . makes_it a strong contender . Delphi already runs bustling discussion groups devoted to &quot; The X Files &quot; and &quot; Melrose Place , &quot; and Matt Jacobson , Delphi ' s vice_president of entertainment services , sees Delphi ' s film discussions as a kind of &quot; virtual water cooler &quot; that can help spread the word_of_mouth about upcoming films . As more information about movies become available on-line , the question still remains : Does any of this cyber-marketing help put actual people in actual theater seats ? &quot; You ' re not going_to reach as_many people with a video clip as you ' re going to reach with a 30-second TV spot in a major market , &quot; says Elliot Stein , owner and operator of the ShowBiz Forum . &quot; ( But ) there ' s a lot of discussions on the forum -- after you read all this , what are you going_to do ? You ' re going to see the film. &quot; Others are more cautious , saying the medium is not yet effective for most films because of its size . &quot; On a CPM ( cost per thousand ) basis , it doesn ' t make_sense , &quot; says Chris Pula , president of theatrical marketing for New Line , who chose to market &quot; The Mask &quot; through Hollywood Online and Entertainment Drive because he thought the film ' s youthful appeal would dovetail with on-line users ' interests . &quot; It will get better , and frankly , it will get cheaper . . . I think what it is , is an investment in the future . It ' s not in our interests to ignore a new venue . . . . The fact that everyone is putting their toes in the water means the potential for an explosion is there. &quot;</TEXT>
