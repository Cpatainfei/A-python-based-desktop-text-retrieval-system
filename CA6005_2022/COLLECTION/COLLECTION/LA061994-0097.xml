   <HEADLINE> NIGERIA , AFRICA ' S OTHER GIANT , STUMBLES ON RUTTED PATHWAY TO DEMOCRACY ; VOTING : THURSDAY , JUNE 23 , IS THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY THE MILITARY NULLIFIED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> South_Africa holds a free election and installs a democracy . A former political_prisoner becomes president . History is written with a happy flourish . Nigeria , with twice as_many people , tries_for democracy but stumbles , tumbling deeper into dictatorship . The apparent president becomes a fugitive with a price on his head . Nearly a year separated these two decidedly different African elections . In between , the United States abandoned the smoldering shell of Somalia , wars waxed and waned in Liberia and Angola , and a sleek French jet carrying the president of Rwanda crashed mysteriously near his swimming_pool , setting_off a bloodletting of biblical proportions . This Thursday is the first anniversary of the day the military decided to nullify a democratic presidential election in Nigeria , a nation of 90 million people that is home to one of every six black_Africans . Since then , the slow descent of Africa ' s most populous nation has been overshadowed by the spectacle of an entire continent careening from the inspiring to the stomach-churning , from the golden horizons of hope in South_Africa to the red waves of horror in Rwanda . Malawi ' s president-for-life was thrown_out when he granted the first free election of his three decades in office . Ivory_Coast ' s only post-colonial ruler died on the 34th anniversary of the day he led it to independence , prompting one distraught admirer to feed himself to the alligators in the presidential moat . Fourteen West_African nations buckled under pressure from Paris and devalued their common French-backed currency by half . That made their agricultural products more attractive abroad , but caused price increases for imported medicines and food . Riots and strikes resulted . Exploited for centuries by slavers , superpowers and its own corrupt rulers , forced into geographic configurations devised by colonialists , Africa has endured the most tumultuous 12 months since the Cold_War ' s end rendered it strategically insignificant while offering the promise of reform and revival . The numbing decline in Nigeria has largely provided background_noise to the more spectacular developments in Somalia , Rwanda , Burundi and South_Africa . Nigeria has styled itself as the economic , cultural and military bulwark of black_Africa for decades , and has periodically lobbied for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security_Council . But when Nelson Mandela was elected president of South_Africa in April , Nigerians seemed to realize their claim to leadership was illusory . &quot; I felt thoroughly humiliated when Mandela took_over , remembering that Nigeria is still in the throes of a seized democratic mandate , &quot; said Claude Ake , a prominent sociologist . Retired Gen . Shehu Mus Yar ' Adua felt pangs of envy when once-hated South_Africa suddenly became the black-led beacon of the region . &quot; I could not sleep on the day Nelson Mandela was sworn into office , &quot; said Yar ' Adua , who was No . 2 man in the last Nigerian military government to willingly give_up power , in 1978 . Nigerians were embarrassed and aghast when Vice_President Al Gore apparently ignored the current military strongman , Gen . Sani Abacha , at Mandela ' s inauguration . Even the sole source of national pride these days , Nigeria ' s first-ever appearance in the World Cup soccer tournament , has been tainted by democracy ' s failure . Washington would not grant visas to Nigerian officials and reduced the number of flights for Nigerian soccer fans . &quot; We have lost in prestige and influence on a global scale , &quot; said Clement Nwankwo , head of the opposition Constitutional Rights Project . &quot; You can now safely assume that no one will take Nigeria seriously with a non-racial South Africa. &quot; After a decade of corrupt , incompetent military rule , Nigeria was poised in 1993 to complete the transition to civilian rule begun by Abacha ' s predecessor , Gen . Ibrahim Babangida . Moshood K . O . Abiola , a flamboyant media and transportation magnate with three wives , a platoon of mistresses and close ties to the military , apparently was elected president June 12 , 1993 , with surprising support that overcame the nation ' s ethnic and religious divisions . Many Nigerians who had been cynical about the election were suddenly elated when Abiola beat the candidate considered more favored by the military , even though Abiola suffers in comparisons with Mandela . South_Africa ' s new president spent 27 years in prison under apartheid . When the going got rough_in Nigeria , Abiola would flee in his private jet , saying he feared for his life . On June 15 , Babangida apparently had second_thoughts and said no more returns would be released . On June 23 , he annulled the election he had spent years organizing . Strikes and riots followed , leaving an estimated 200 people dead over three days . Plagued by infighting within his military circle , he stepped_down Aug . 26 . Abacha promptly threw_out the civilian administrator Babangida had left as his successor . Abacha , aloof , heavy-handed and lacking Babangida ' s political knack for putting a positive spin on the military ' s manipulations , has managed to do the unthinkable : make people miss the previous dictator . He clumsily dissolved the elected federal , state and local_governments Babangida had installed , replaced governors with soldiers and wiped_out years of market reforms . As the election anniversary approached , Abacha jailed at least two_dozen former senators and human_rights activists , closed newspapers and tightened visa requirements on foreign journalists . On June 11 , the day before the election anniversary , he sent soldiers to arrest Abiola , who had sworn himself in as president . Abiola had fled to a secret location in the city . Abacha also put a price , but not much of one , on the billionaire ' s head : 50 # 000 naira , about $ 2 # 300 at the official rate and $ 1 # 000 on the black_market . The general went_on television June 12 and echoed the unfulfilled promise of uniformed predecessors : Be patient . Democracy will come , someday . &quot; What we want is simple trust from the people , &quot; said Lt . Gen . Oladipo Diya , No . 2 in Abacha ' s junta . Few Nigerians believe their leaders any longer . Before the 1993 election was voided , the military spokesman , Gen . Fred Chijuka , spoke_of what a fine one it had been . While spasms of war and political unrest draw attention to Africa , the continent ' s deeper problems , epitomized by Nigeria , quietly cripple its long-term prospects . Sub-Saharan Africa has been the only region in the world to regress economically since 1980 . Average per capita income fell from $ 570 annually in 1980 to $ 350 in 1992 , the World_Bank said in March . Despite belt-tightening ordered by the World_Bank , the region ' s foreign debt inched up from $ 194 billion in 1992 to $ 199 billion last year . The number of Africans classified as undernourished by the U.N. Food_and_Agriculture_Organization rose from 129 million in 1979-81 to 175 million in 1988-90 . There was something in the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for everybody , except sub-Saharan Africa . It is the only region that stands to lose money on the deal : $ 2.7 billion a year , the World_Bank estimates . Still , lenders and investors are lining_up to pour money into South_Africa , which is , for now , a showcase African democracy . Abiola , ever the businessman , pointed_out early this month that membership in the global family of democracies has its privileges . &quot; Nigeria does not offer a foreign investor the kind of attraction which the same investor could find in a democratic , and apparently more stable , South_Africa , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
