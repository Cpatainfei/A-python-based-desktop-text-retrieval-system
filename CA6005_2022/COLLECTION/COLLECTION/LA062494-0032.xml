   <TEXT> MCA / Universal has surprised the industry by announcing that &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; Steven Spielberg ' s Oscar-winning Holocaust drama , is coming_to video on Aug . 17 and as a rental rather than to the sales market . The industry speculation had been that the movie , which won seven Oscars -- including best picture and best director -- would come_out late in the year and possibly at a price geared to the sales market , probably around $ 30 . Andrew Kairey , MCA / Universal ' s senior_vice_president of sales and marketing , said the decision was largely based on the film ' s current high awareness among consumers . &quot; With the Academy Award exposure and the movie doing so well in theaters , it seemed best to put it out this summer , when it ' s more in people ' s minds , &quot; he said of the movie , which has grossed more_than $ 95 million . There ' s also less competition in mid-August -- generally a rather slow period for video releases -- than late in the year , when many of the big summer movies make their debuts . &quot; The market is a lot more crowded in the fall , so the movie would n ' t get as much attention , &quot; Kairey said . &quot; It makes more sense to market it in the summer. &quot; &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; which runs three hours and 17 minutes , will be_on two cassettes , in both standard and letter-boxed versions . There will also be a limited edition ( about 100 # 000 copies ) of a collector ' s set , including the cassettes , a paperback novel , a soundtrack CD and a book of stills , priced at $ 140 . &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; will be released on laser Sept . 21 , at $ 45 for the basic version and $ 140 for the collector ' s edition . Videobits Disney ' s smartest marketing move with the four Johnny Carson videos was releasing them several weeks before Father ' s Day . Last Sunday , quite a_few fathers undoubtedly were gifted with one or more of the tapes that highlight Carson ' s &quot; Tonight Show &quot; years . A Disney spokesperson reported that by the end of this week 1.5 million cassettes will have been sold -- a hefty figure for this kind of non-theatrical collection . The spokesperson also said no one tape was significantly outselling the others and that the four-video set was selling as well as any single tape . A director ' s cut of &quot; A Streetcar Named Desire , &quot; with about three extra minutes sprinkled into the 1951 drama , comes_out July 6 ( Warner , $ 40 ) . Though it doesn ' t sound like much , this footage does illuminate the action and add voltage to what was already an electrifying drama , starring Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski and Vivien Leigh in her Oscar-winning performance as Blanche DuBois . Some video retailers are taking_advantage of the focus_on O.J. Simpson during the past two weeks by showcasing his best-known movies -- the first two &quot; Naked Gun &quot; comedies . You ' d think that with his arrest on two murder counts so fresh in everyone ' s mind , it would be hard to watch him in something so frivolous , but fans are still renting them . Last week there was a misprint of the title of a 1977 Gerard Depardieu drama just out on World Artists . The correct title is &quot; This Sweet Sickness. &quot; Special Interest New York Ranger fans are giddy about their hockey_team winning its first NHL championship in 54 years last week . Those who are still in a celebrating mood on July 6 will welcome ABC ' s rush-released video , &quot; 1994 Stanley Cup Champions : New York Rangers , &quot; for $ 20 . The tape ' s most appealing feature : interviews with players from that last championship team . Elvis Presley fans tired_of all_the muckraking about their idol might like &quot; Elvis : His Life and Times , &quot; a 90-minute BBC documentary from the late ' 80s . There are no revelations , just an old-fashioned , totally upbeat tribute , including footage from movies , shows and interviews . For $ 30 from Raycom , ( 704 ) 378-4488 . What ' s New on Video &quot; Tombstone &quot; ( Hollywood ) . The umpteenth retelling -- and arguably the best -- of the O.K. Corral gunfight , with Wyatt Earp ( Kurt Russell ) , Doc Holliday ( Val Kilmer ) and the Earp Brothers ( Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton ) taking_on the bad_guys . Kilmer ' s witty , charismatic Holliday steals the show , contrasting nicely with Russell ' s dour Earp . Despite some occasionally sloppy plotting , basically a gritty , very good -- and very violent -- Western . &quot; Geronimo : An American Legend &quot; ( Columbia TriStar ) . Army_officers on the trail of the Apache renegade . Wes Studi is first-rate as Geronimo , but you don ' t get enough of him since the focus is more on the Army_officers ( Jason Patric , Gene Hackman and Matt Damon ) . Directed by Walter Hill , this even-handed tale niftily steers clear of old Western stereotypes . &quot; Six Degrees of Separation &quot; ( MGM / UA ) . A glib , gay con_man ( Will Smith , TV ' s &quot; Fresh Prince of Bel-Air &quot; ) targets a snooty Manhattan couple ( Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing ) pretending to be Sidney Poitier ' s son . Based on John Guare ' s play , this sophisticated comedy / drama is a sharply satirical jab at the pretentious upper_class . At times , though , it ' s annoying listening to these unsavory phonies . Still , the acting is excellent , particularly Channing , who got a best actress Oscar nomination . &quot; Gunmen &quot; ( LIVE ) . Covers familiar territory , with good_guys ( Mario Van Peebles and Christopher Lambert ) battling drug barons in South_America . This one , though , has an added kick because of the imaginative casting -- Patrick Stewart and Denis Leary as the bad_guys . An expensive-looking B-movie adventure boasting some action sequences expertly staged by director Deran Sarafian .
