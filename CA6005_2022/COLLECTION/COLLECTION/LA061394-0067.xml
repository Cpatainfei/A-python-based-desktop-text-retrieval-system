   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE ; A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ; YOUNG FIRM AIMS TO MAKE LEARNING A MULTIMEDIA ADVENTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nearly every week at Knowledge Adventure ' s nondescript headquarters in La Crescenta , the company ' s chairman and founder , Bill Gross , watches as a group of children compare his latest experiments in interactive educational software -- &quot; Bug Adventure , &quot; say , or &quot; The Discoverers &quot; -- to video_games like &quot; Streetfighter II. &quot; And nearly every week , he says , they like the video_games better . &quot; We want to make open-ended exploring as exciting as a regular old video_game , and we ' re getting there -- I see glimmers of it from the kids who use our products , &quot; says the intense , bespectacled Gross . &quot; But we have a long way to go_to compete with MTV and ' Streetfighter. ' &quot; Nonetheless , the glimmers were bright enough to attract the attention of Hollywood producer-director Steven Spielberg , who last week said he plans to develop multimedia software projects with Knowledge Adventure . He has also made an equity investment in the 3-year-old firm . Like many multimedia investors , Spielberg is taking a flyer . Knowledge Adventure had sales of $ 18.5 million last year , but no profits . Yet the company is growing fast , with sales expected to reach $ 35 million this year , it says . Its crowded offices are bursting at the seams . Staff meetings are held_in the hallway . The work is so intense that Gross often sleeps only a_few hours a night . One sign of Knowledge Adventure ' s growing pains came_in February , when Chief_Executive Rod Turner resigned , citing a difference in visions for the company . Insiders said Turner wanted to take the company public sooner than Gross thought prudent . Gross says the company will go public eventually , but he won ' t say when . More important than Spielberg ' s investment , to Knowledge Adventure , is what he can offer in prestige and creativity . Revered in high-tech circles as one of the few Hollywood types who understand how to blend entertainment and technology , Spielberg was courted by a range of companies involved in multimedia , from video_game firms to software giant Microsoft Corp . That he chose Knowledge Adventure reflects the ascendance of interactive learning in a field long dominated by what are known in the industry as &quot; twitch games. &quot; Spielberg was not available for comment , but his business manager , Gerald Breslauer , did not rule_out the possibility that he would make another multimedia investment as well . For the moment , the $ 6-billion-a-year video_game business is where the multimedia money is . By contrast , American consumers bought about $ 400 million worth of educational computer_programs last year . But multimedia analysts and an increasing number of entrepreneurs like Gross believe that learning is the most natural application of the new technology , which lets users jump around at will through reams of video , graphics , text and sounds stored on a shiny CD-ROM . In an interview with The Times earlier this year , Spielberg said he had no interest in producing &quot; interactive movies &quot; or video_games , where players choose plot variations and different endings . &quot; I bemoan the loss of control , &quot; he said . &quot; It would be like making a film just to have everyone remake it over and over again. &quot; But the director -- known for his films &quot; E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial , &quot; &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; and &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; -- spent hours playing Knowledge Adventure ' s CD-ROM &quot; 3-D Body Adventure &quot; in the glass-walled conference_room at his Amblin Entertainment production company a_few months back . The program enables the user to fly around inside the heart chambers and arteries like a molecule traveling through the anatomy in a sort of multimedia &quot; Fantastic Voyage. &quot; &quot; He played every single module ! &quot; recalls Larry Gross , vice_president of customer satisfaction , who accompanied his older brother on the visit . &quot; It was pretty fun to see my brother . . . knocking the socks off Steven Spielberg. &quot; By all accounts the chemistry between Spielberg and Gross was key to the director ' s decision to work with privately held Knowledge Adventure , which just hired its 100th employee and boasts only about 4 % of the educational software market . For his part , Gross likes Spielberg ' s films all_right . But the self-described &quot; total engineering nerd &quot; was most impressed by the Hollywood mogul ' s fast-paced brainstorming on how to improve products like &quot; Body Adventure. &quot; So far , the firm ' s CD-ROM titles -- including &quot; Dinosaur Adventure , &quot; which came_out by happy coincidence around the same time as Spielberg ' s dino-thriller &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; last summer -- have been more like multimedia reference tools than stories . &quot; But he took one look_at ' Body Adventure ' and said , ' That human_body should walk on , look down , and notice he has no clothes on , ' &quot; Gross remembers . &quot; We would never have thought of that. &quot; Nerd or not , Gross , 35 , has some idea what it takes_to run a successful business . Raised in Encino , he and his brother started_out as a team at Portola Junior_High , where they found they could buy candy_bars in bulk for 4 cents each and resell them for 9 cents -- a penny less than the local candy_store . Moving_on to Caltech , where the introduction of the first IBM personal_computers changed their lives , the brothers started a firm called Gross_National_Products . They developed two programs that made the spreadsheet program Lotus 1-2-3 easier to use and accepted the firm ' s offer to acquire their start-up and employ them at Lotus ' Cambridge , Mass. , headquarters . By the summer of 1991 , Gross ' son David was 4 years old and about to start kindergarten . Like all kids , he liked to imitate his dad , which mostly meant sitting at a computer and typing away . In his quest to find something more appropriate than business applications for David to play with , Gross came_across a multimedia Beethoven CD-ROM ( now available commercially from Microsoft ) . &quot; I had goose bumps all_over my body about how great Beethoven was , &quot; Gross says . &quot; It let me in on a non-academic way to discover beautiful things on my own. &quot; A few months later , Gross founded Knowledge Adventure , collecting venture_capital funding and investments from Paramount Communications Inc. ( now a unit of Viacom Inc. ) and AT &amp; T along the way . But as part of the democratic culture he strives to instill , Gross has made_sure more_than half of the firm is owned by its employees . Although Knowledge Adventure is still losing money , its products have met with critical and commercial success , and it continues to churn_out new ones . In the past few months , for example , the firm has shipped five new products , including an interactive version of the IMAX movie &quot; The Discoverers , &quot; which producer Roger Holzberg describes as &quot; 30 minutes long and eight miles wide. &quot; At the title ' s premier at the IMAX theater in Los Angeles , Knowledge Adventure invited previous customers to watch the movie and then play the interactive version on computers set_up outside the auditorium . Michael Lamb , 13 , thought it was pretty neat , though &quot; Bug Adventure &quot; remains his favorite : &quot; The praying mantises are cool. &quot;</TEXT>
