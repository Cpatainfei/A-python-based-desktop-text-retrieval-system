   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; PIECE STILL MISSING IN GUATEMALA PEACE MOSAIC ; CENTRAL_AMERICA : THREE-YEAR DEADLOCK IN LENGTHY CIVIL WAR IS BROKEN . BUT THE QUESTION OF ATROCITIES REMAINS UNRESOLVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Intense international pressure has helped force the two sides in Guatemala ' s long civil_war to break a three-year deadlock and agree on a human_rights treaty and a timetable aimed at bringing peace by the end of the year . The accords , participants in the negotiations say , take Guatemala a big step closer to ending the oldest , last war in Central_America ; they give a boost to the besieged administration of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio . But when Guatemala ' s government and its leftist guerrillas gathered amid fanfare Tuesday evening in Mexico_City to sign the documents , a crucial element was missing : To get the government to sign , the guerrillas agreed to put aside , momentarily , their demand for a commission to investigate atrocities committed in a war that claimed some 100 # 000 lives , many of them Mayan peasants killed by security_forces . The two sides agreed to discuss the commission later , but its exclusion from the new and widely praised agreements underscores the fact that a host of sensitive and divisive issues that go_to the heart of the Guatemalan conflict have yet to be solved . Still , the accords , signed as a high-level mission from the United Nations and diplomats from six countries looked_on , come_after nearly three years of talks in which the Guatemalans could agree on little . Had participants failed to reach agreement , the talks probably would have been doomed . &quot; This is a historic date for peace in Guatemala , &quot; De Leon said in Guatemala_City . &quot; This is a good accomplishment , &quot; Miguel Angel Sandoval , a member of the guerrillas ' political committee , said Wednesday . &quot; It does not fill all_of our hopes , but it is a very positive step. &quot; Besides the human_rights accord , the two sides signed a timetable for monthly meetings to discuss issues ranging from land_reform to indigenous rights . The timetable establishes December as the date for a final peace_treaty and demobilization of the rebels who have fought Guatemalan governments for 33 years . Some of these problems -- like land -- have plagued Guatemala for a century ; some -- like the resettlement of refugees -- are extremely complicated . It is unclear how they will be resolved by the year ' s end . &quot; They are very complex ( issues ) , but if the will to solve them exists , they will be solved , &quot; Sandoval said . Most significant in the accords signed Tuesday , the government for the first time will allow U.N. human_rights monitors into Guatemala , a country with one of the worst human_rights records in the hemisphere . The accords also ban paramilitary groups and clandestine jails ; end forced army recruitment ; guarantee the right of free movement and association , and provide protection for human_rights workers . The guerrillas ' earlier insistence on including the war_crimes commission had been a major stumbling_block until now . Their willingness to postpone it helped make the accords possible , but it angered human_rights activists at_home . Spokesmen for the guerrillas , grouped in the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union , say they are confident the commission will be established by May . But the government , and especially the army that backs it , vigorously oppose an investigation of war atrocities . Guatemalan generals look with trepidation at neighboring El_Salvador , where a Truth Commission established as part of peace accords that ended the Salvadoran civil_war blamed most massacres and torture on the military . The Salvadoran army was purged and has lost much of its power . Still , veteran observers weary of Guatemalan talks that go nowhere were counting their blessings with the progress that was achieved . Besides the separation of the war_crimes commission , the talks advanced in large part because of pressure from the United Nations , the United States and five other countries that are lobbying for peace as the &quot; Friends of Guatemala. &quot; The United Nations late last year appointed gifted mediator Jean Arnault to assume control of the talks . And in negotiating sessions in Mexico in January and again last week , powerful U.N. trouble-shooter Marrack Goulding , undersecretary general for political affairs , sat_down with the two sides . Goulding was instrumental in the El_Salvador settlement , often cited as a U.N. success story despite lingering trouble there . American officials in Guatemala have also been taking a more activist role . They have impressed upon De Leon the importance of stopping the last war in the region as the best way to attract investment and heal Guatemala ' s battered economy .</TEXT>
