   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : SPECIAL REPORT ; REALITY CHECK ; IN ' 95 , TECHNOLOGIES WILL THRIVE ON PROFITS -- NOT PROMISES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Computer and communications technologies have been changing our world for decades , but it was not until the 1990s -- when the power of the computer chip reached a certain critical mass and communications networks began talking the language of computers -- that the cataclysmic implications of those changes started to become clear . By 1993 , sane , rational people were talking_of services that fused the two technologies , as in video on demand , long-distance learning , &quot; tele-medicine &quot; and &quot; anywhere , any time &quot; communications . And if 1993 was the year technology entered our collective consciousness , 1994 was the year of Infobahn euphoria . Politicians , businessmen , news reporters and would-be multimedia producers vied to see whose &quot; information superhighway &quot; metaphors stretched furthest as they predicted vast social change and digital nirvana just around the bend . By the end of the year , however , the cognoscenti were cynically referring to the &quot; super-hypeway , &quot; and it was becoming obvious that many of the promises had been off by years . Mergers between cable and phone_companies that were supposed to have helped to open the new age quickly came_apart . Interactive television trials were delayed . Congress did not pass a telecommunications deregulation bill as expected . Personal_computers flew off the store shelves , but consumers found themselves with a Pentium chip bug . So what of 1995 ? Call it the Year of the Reality Check . Next year will be the year the information wheat is separated from the digital chaff ; it will be the year in which technology trials and pilot marketing efforts finally begin to generate information . Instead of just talking a good game , companies will have to lay_down money and make hard decisions about which technologies they should back . One of the most critical decisions will involve the vision of an interactive , 500-channel television service . Cable and telephone_companies had been taking a &quot; Field of Dreams &quot; if-we-build-it-they-will-come approach . Just install the broad-band networks required to send video signals , they suggested , and a host of new businesses will flock to exploit it . Some called it the big bang approach . Better to call it the big bungle . Once it became clear that $ 1 # 000-per-household estimates for the new networks were_on the low side , aggressive rollout plans were rolled back . Look_for further trials instead . Time Warner , which was scheduled to begin offering services to 4 # 000 homes_in Orlando , Fla. , by early 1994 , finally got its trial under way this month after endless technical problems . Pacific Bell , which said last year it would wire 1.5 million homes by the end of 1996 , now says it will have only about 600 # 000 homes &quot; passed &quot; by then . And even those plans seem fraught with uncertainty . &quot; The technical hurdles are more daunting than the early visionaries had expected , &quot; said Gary Smaby , a technology consultant . &quot; A lot of this technology has never been tested outside the laboratory. &quot; Still , trial marketing will provide information that can guide future services . &quot; The trials will weed out some bad ideas , &quot; said Greg E . Blonder , chief technical officer of AT &amp; T ' s corporate strategy division . &quot; Consumers know when something is bad . They don ' t know if they like it. &quot; Industry insiders expect a lukewarm response , which would result in a go-slow approach to building new broad-band networks . &quot; I ' ve stood_in front of a Blockbuster store for an hour and watched people go_in and out , &quot; said James Cannavino , senior_vice_president for strategy and development at IBM . &quot; They all go_to different aisles and come_back with four or five tapes. &quot; After discussion , he says , the typical family narrows_down the selection of tapes and leaves , stopping by for fast food on the way home . &quot; We can ' t do that yet. &quot; A slower approach to infrastructure investments will give would-be interactive TV firms more time to make decisions about a key missing part of the proposed services : the set-top box . These devices will convert digital signals into forms that can be viewed on a television_set , manage the on-screen &quot; menus &quot; that will give viewers control over the systems and send_back the signals that will make the TV &quot; interactive. &quot; Depending_on the reaction to next year ' s trials , these machines could be souped-up cable TV boxes or they could be powerful machines that can perform simultaneously as game machines , shopping terminals and video telephones . Computer makers such_as Silicon Graphics are competing with General Instruments and other vendors of conventional cable TV equipment . So far , the major networks have been loath to commit themselves . &quot; Set-top boxes get twice as good every year , &quot; said Cannavino of IBM . &quot; Making decisions too early makes them obsolete. &quot; that ' s frustrating for the equipment suppliers , but cable industry executives grumble in private that when it comes_to the boxes , the equipment suppliers have promised the world and not delivered . And , many in the PC industry now say it is the personal_computer that will pave the interactive path into the home . Indeed , one of the most notable developments of 1994 was explosive growth in two related areas : the consumer PC business and on-line communications services . Commercial services such_as Prodigy and America Online , along with the network of networks known as the Internet , have emerged as popular precursors to the more elaborate broad-band networks planned . Already , cable companies are rushing to install technologies that will enable them to offer Internet &quot; channels &quot; and high access to commercial on-line services . Intel and other companies , for their part , are racing to market with &quot; cable modems &quot; that will , in 1995 , allow many PC users to tap into the high-capacity communications capabilities of their cable TV wires . &quot; You ' re seeing an example of a concept that has caught_fire , &quot; said William Savoy , president at Vulcan Ventures , the investment_company for billionaire Paul Allen , which recently cashed_in an investment in America Online for a big profit . &quot; More and more transactions are going_to be conducted on line , &quot; Savoy said . There will be virtual electronic marketplaces . We are still early in the cycle , but it ' s clearly cost-effective . But the growth of these services will be governed by their potential to make money . What that means , in turn , is that many of the technologies so heavily hyped to consumers in 1994 will begin to find niches in 1995 -- in the business world . Electronic commerce provides a useful example . There has been a lot of talk_about on-line shopping networks , with everyone from IBM to MCI and AT &amp; T experimenting in the arena . But public networks lack security , and there are still few areas where shopping by computer is quicker or cheaper than , say , using a catalogue and calling a mail-order 800 phone_number . The real action is in the business market , where factories are connecting with their suppliers and customers to speed_up orders and deliveries and to keep inventories down -- which can produce immediate savings . Similarly , the wireless gizmos known as personal digital assistants may have been marketed first as the wave of the future , but they ' re likely to retreat for the moment into specialized markets . Brian Sroub , vice_president of personal information_systems at Sony Corp. , knows_the_score . He saw the Newton , over-hyped by former Apple Chairman John Scully as an all-purpose communications device , flayed for falling far short of expectations . &quot; We have to make_sure we don ' t get too far ahead of the consumer , &quot; Sroub said . Sony ' s Newton-like device is being sold primarily as a way to collect and send e-mail . The machine uses Magic Cap , an operating system trumpeted for its capability to send_out packets of software instructions , or &quot; intelligent agents &quot; that go_out into the network on_their_own to make travel arrangements or reserve tickets to see Madonna . But don ' t try that trick just yet or you ' ll miss the concert . &quot; We see volume sales approaching the end of the century , &quot; Sroub said modestly , &quot; and 1998 and 1999 will be outstanding years. &quot; A technology not driven by business applications must have new mechanisms that make_it profitable . Sometimes that direction comes from competition . Cable companies are feeling pressure from satellite broadcasters that offer 150 channels to people who pay $ 600 to $ 700 for a satellite_receiver . While the competition may be unwelcome , their success suggests that customers will pay heavily for quality services . Sometimes it ' s just a new twist on an old idea . In the world of wireless communications , the bidding for wireless licenses will be completed in 1995 . Companies will begin drawing_up concrete plans for their services -- and the early focus will be_on the tried-and-true cellular_phones and paging . &quot; What the world knows and understands is the telephone , &quot; said Shafhi Rava , Hewlett-Packard ' s new business development manager . To technology watchers , last year ' s hoopla and next year ' s reality check are all part of the steady advancement of technology . &quot; It ' s a relentless march , just like killer_bees , &quot; said IBM ' s Cannavino . &quot; You keep reading about them , but each time they are another 100 miles north. &quot;</TEXT>
