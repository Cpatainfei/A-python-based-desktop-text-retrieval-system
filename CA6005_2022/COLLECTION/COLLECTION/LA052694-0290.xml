   <HEADLINE> HUBBLE CONFIRMS EXISTENCE OF HUGE BLACK_HOLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Hubble Space Telescope has confirmed for the first time the existence of a supermassive black_hole , ending a decades-long quest_for definitive proof , astronomers announced Wednesday . The orbiting observatory , with corrective lenses installed during a repair mission in December , was able to see clearly for the first time into the heart of the giant galaxy M87 , more_than 50 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo , where astronomers have long suspected that a monstrous black_hole was lurking . The telescope revealed the details so sharply that the observing team was able to &quot; weigh &quot; the object at the galaxy ' s center with unexpected ease , the astronomers said . The key was a pancake-shaped disc of hot gas spinning around , and being consumed , by something at the center . Measurements of its velocity showed that the central object has a mass 2 billion to 3 billion times the mass of the sun , compressed into an area about the size of our solar_system . &quot; If that isn ' t a black_hole , I don ' t know what it is , &quot; said Holland Ford of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore . He and Richard Harms of Applied Research Corp . in Landover , Md. , led the observing team and announced the findings Wednesday at National Aeronautics and Space Administration headquarters . The concept of a black_hole was built , at first , purely on mathematical equations and imaginings of theorists . They envisioned a massive , collapsing object ( a star or group of stars ) whose gravitational pull is so powerful that nothing -- not even light -- can come_out again after it has crossed the hole ' s threshold , known as the &quot; event horizon. &quot; Within this singular object , normal time and space come_to a halt . The known laws of physics do not apply . The immense gravity of the black_hole draws all nearby objects and material toward it , forming a whirlpool ( called an &quot; accretion disc &quot; ) that resembles water going_down a bathtub drain . In this maelstrom , matter crowds in , collides , heats_up and forms what Hubble saw as a pancake of gas around the hole , with high-speed jets of gas spewing from the disc near one or both poles of the hole . In recent years , increasingly sophisticated instruments gradually have piled_up convincing evidence that these objects exist . But , Ford said , &quot; skeptical colleagues were always clever enough to create computer models showing that some_other explanation was possible. &quot; Now , said Bruce Margon of the University of Washington , &quot; we no longer have an alternative theory. &quot; &quot; All reasonable astronomers will be convinced &quot; said NASA astronomer Stephen Maran of the Goddard Space Flight Center , who is also a spokesman for the American Astronomical Society . The &quot; smoking gun &quot; proof presented Wednesday was the measurement of the astounding velocity in the whirling disc of gas as it was sucked inward by the powerful gravity of the hole : At a distance of 60 light-years from the center , it was whipping around at 1.2 million m.p.h. ( A light-year is about 5.8 trillion miles. ) &quot; Once you get that measurement , all you need is straightforward Newtonian physics to calculate the mass of the central object that ' s making the disc spin , &quot; Harms said . In a similar way , astronomers have measured the motion of the planets to determine the sun ' s mass . M87 is a giant football-shaped collection of up_to a_trillion stars . It has fascinated astronomers since early in the century , when they detected a jet of hot ionized gas at least 4 # 000 light-years long shooting from its core . Such a jet is now thought to be one signature of a black_hole . The new observations show that the disc of whirling gas is positioned at a right_angle to the jet , just as predicted . Theorist Edwin E . Salpeter of Cornell University , after seeing the new Hubble data , said : &quot; A black_hole is now the least crazy model for what we ' re seeing. &quot; Thirty years ago , Salpeter and a Russian astronomer independently wrote papers essentially predicting Wednesday ' s findings . &quot; It ' s good to finally win the bet , &quot; he added . Recent observations indicate that black_holes may come_in a variety of sizes and may lie at the cores of many galaxies , including Earth ' s home galaxy , the Milky Way . In fact , recent observations indicate that these powerhouses may be commonplace in the universe , existing in all sizes and throughout time .</TEXT>
