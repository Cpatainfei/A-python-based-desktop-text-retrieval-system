   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; NOTEBOOK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About the time they hung another medal around Tommy Moe ' s neck , teammate AJ Kitt was packing for home . Kitt ' s work is done_in Lillehammer and he will return home today to Rochester , N.Y. , where he plans to rest before the resumption of the World Cup circuit , which moves to North_America after the Olympics . Kitt , before Moe ' s burst of fame , was America ' s most famous downhill racer . But he finished 17th in Sunday ' s downhill and went_off course in the super-giant slalom . He said it was just as well : &quot; Better than being fourth or fifth. &quot; Kitt didn ' t even have a mountain to blame . &quot; It is very suited to me , &quot; he said of the Kvitfjell course . &quot; Guys are just skiing better than me now. &quot; Kitt has never known Olympic glory . He finished ninth in the 1992 Olympic downhill at Albertville , France . He can , however , speak_of Moe ' s streak . Kitt , 25 , has been that hot before , though not with so_much at stake . Moe has never won a World Cup downhill . Kitt has . And Kitt , in ' 92 , finished second at Kitzbuhel , Austria , the Indy 500 of downhills . &quot; You know you ' ve got a shot every time you put the skis on , &quot; Kitt said of what Moe is feeling . &quot; It ' s just being in a groove , being confident , being in tune with your skis . It ' s hard to explain . I wish I would have written ideas down when I was in the groove , maybe it would be easier to find it again. &quot; * Who was Kyle Rasmussen kidding ? After losing his line on the super-G course , the American skied between the two poles of a slalom gate , disqualifying himself . Except that he kept_on skiing straight through to the finish . &quot; I thought to myself , ' Maybe nobody noticed , ' &quot; Rasmussen said . &quot; And then it was like , ' Yeah , right , this is the Olympics. ' &quot; * Moe ' s girlfriend , Megan Gerety of the U.S. women ' s Alpine team , did not see his silver-medal run . Gerety , who had flu , decided to watch the super-G from the Olympic village . When she couldn ' t get the race on television , she took the first bus to Kvitfjell , but arrived too late . She was_on the chairlift as Moe raced . CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
