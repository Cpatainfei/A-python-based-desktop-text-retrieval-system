   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; ASSOCIATION ANNOUNCES WAR ON MUSIC PIRACY IN RUSSIA ; COMMERCE : RECORDING INDUSTRY TRADE GROUP WANTS TO PROTECT RUSSIAN FIRMS AND LURE WESTERN LABELS TO THE MARKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every weekend , hundreds of Russian music fans flock to Moscow ' s Fili Park to shop for audio_recordings in a huge , open-air_market . Every kind of music , from Rachmaninoff to the Rolling Stones and even brand-new American releases , can be found on the sellers ' rickety tables . There ' s just one catch : Nearly every album , cassette and compact_disc is pirated . To combat the bootlegging that is strangling Russia ' s legitimate music business and infuriating Western studios and trade associations , a powerful international recording industry association declared war Monday on audio piracy in Russia . The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , which represents more_than 1 # 000 record companies worldwide , hopes to protect Russian recording firms and lure Western companies reluctant to set_up shop here lest their recordings , too , be sold on the black_market . The federation ' s new Moscow office will lobby for stronger anti-piracy laws and tougher prosecution of suspected bootleggers &quot; so that producers in other parts of the world , including California , will be able to think_about this market as one to invest in , &quot; said Nicholas Garnett , the group ' s general director . The federation plans to forge links with such Russian law_enforcement agencies as the Interior Ministry , the former KGB and the customs service , helping them launch a coordinated attack against bootlegging . &quot; If the government allows ( pirating ) to happen , it sends the wrong signal to companies ready to invest , &quot; Garnett said . &quot; Getting your intellectual property laws , your copyrights , your trademarks , your patents in place and properly enforced is a very important factor_in securing foreign investment. &quot; Russia ' s problem with audio piracy is massive , Garnett said , noting : &quot; You ' re talking 70 % , 80 % , 90 % pirated ( recordings ) in some kinds of repertoire . Most of the international market here is pirated. &quot; By comparison , the federation estimates that in the United States , only about 4 % of recordings sold are pirated . Although Russian artists and producers have complained bitterly about the illegal production and import of CDs and cassettes , few concrete steps have been taken until now to fight it . In the past two years , the Russian Parliament has passed several intellectual property protection laws , but enforcement remains sketchy . The federation plans to work with the newly formed Russian Phonographic Assn. , which represents 18 Russian recording houses , including London-based PolyGram Records and Melodiya , once the Soviet_Union ' s only record producer . Garnett acknowledges it won ' t be easy to stem the tide of illegal recordings that stream from China , Bulgaria , Ukraine , Belarus and elsewhere in the former Soviet_Union . &quot; It ' s very complicated , and in some ways a very dangerous situation , &quot; he said , alluding to the organized-crime faction believed to be taking a cut from the lucrative smuggling business . Irina Savelyeva , head of the federation ' s Moscow office , said that &quot; many other crimes can be tied_in to pirating -- racketeering , money laundering. &quot; Record company executives greeted the announcement warmly . &quot; I have 10 or 20 copies of different albums of ours from all_over the world , made illegally from CDs or music cassettes , &quot; said Vladimir Kozlov , owner of Moscow ' s ZeKo records . &quot; This organization has the money and the links to solve any problem in this area. &quot; * Inside Hollywood * For more Company Town coverage and insightful analysis of the entertainment_industry , sign_on to the TimesLink on-line service and &quot; jump &quot; to keyword &quot; Inside Hollywood. &quot; Details on_Times electronic services , B4</TEXT>
