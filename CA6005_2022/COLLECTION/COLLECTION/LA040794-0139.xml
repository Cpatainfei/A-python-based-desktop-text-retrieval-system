   <HEADLINE> SCIENCE COURSE ; ' PROFESSOR ' LU BRINGS TECHNICAL APPROACH TO CSUN VOLLEYBALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The year was 1987 and Lian Kang Lu could not believe what he was hearing . Lu , then an assistant women ' s volleyball coach at UC Santa Barbara , had asked David Rottman , an All-American outside hitter on the Gaucho men ' s team , to explain the proper hitting technique for a cross-court kill . Rottman was unable , despite having blasted thousands of cross-court kills during his career . &quot; He said it was just something he did , &quot; Lu said with a chuckle . &quot; He said he had never thought_about it , he had just done it. &quot; To Lu , who took_over the women ' s volleyball program at Cal State Northridge this year , such a statement would be considered a sacrilege . Lu , one of the top technical coaches in the world who is affectionately known as &quot; The Professor , &quot; says there is a correct technique for everything a player does -- serving , passing , setting , spiking , blocking or defense . Nothing is just done . In a similar vein , he maintains that for every offensive action that occurs during a match , there is a proper defensive reaction . Call it Lu ' s theory of volleyball relativity . Volleyball might seem simple , but Lu treats it as science . Nothing is as simple as it appears for Lu , 59 , a founder of the South China volleyball training base that produced women ' s teams that won World Cup titles in 1981 and ' 85 , the Olympic Games in 1984 and the World Championships in 1982 and ' 86 . Spiking might seem like a straightforward task , but Lu has designed instructional charts that list 20 different ways to hit the ball . &quot; The type of options you use will depend_on the strengths and weaknesses of the team you are playing , &quot; Lu said . Of course , even if a player grasps the myriad techniques Lu teaches , that player must put the knowledge to use in the heat of competition , when split-second decisions are required . That is where Lu ' s detailed training regimen comes_into play . Having broken volleyball into six basic components -- serving , passing , setting , spiking , blocking and defense -- Lu ' s training revolves_around his belief that a player must be competent in what he calls main skills areas before advancing to auxiliary skills and top skills . &quot; Everything I teach is like a little block , and it takes many , many blocks to make_up a big building , &quot; Lu said . Junior Heather Anderson , who has been a starting outside hitter at Northridge for the past two seasons , has already noticed the training differences between Lu and Matador predecessors Walt Ker -- who coached the team from 1979-92 -- and John Price ( 1993 ) . &quot; We practice a lot more without the balls , &quot; Anderson said . &quot; We do a lot more footwork and wrist work than we did before . We do a lot more agility drills where you get_to know how your body moves . . . . Before , we just went_out and played , but now we know exactly what we ' re going to do on any given play. &quot; As an intense , vocal and demonstrative coach , Lu , who coached at Santa Barbara from 1984 through 1993 , has been known to lose his cool every now and then . But UC Santa Barbara junior Chrissy Boehle says that &quot; 99 % of the time , his coaching is very positive. &quot; &quot; He gets angry , &quot; Boehle said . &quot; He gets upset at times , but it ' s usually done_in a very positive way. &quot; Anderson says that criticism is applied in a very direct and forthright manner . &quot; He is very on the table with everything , &quot; she said . &quot; He lets you know what your strengths are and what your weaknesses are right from the start. &quot; Lu is equally candid with reporters . Asked his first impressions of a Northridge team that compiled a 12-17 record last season , he said : &quot; Blocking is our strength . Defense is our weakness . The girls are working very hard , but they have a long way to go. &quot; Lu ' s ability to physically demonstrate what he wants done on the court could be one of his greatest assets as a coach . Although he is a month away from his 60th birthday , Lu is in superb physical condition and takes_pride in demonstrating the proper technique for a belly slide , a sprawl , a roll or a half-roll after digging a ball . &quot; My age is old , but I don ' t like people to know about it , &quot; he laughs . &quot; Forget my age . Remember my shape and great demonstrations. &quot; A need to illustrate exactly what he wants done is not the sole reason for Lu ' s adherence to a daily training regimen . He is convinced that an energetic coach can elevate a team ' s play to another level . &quot; If you don ' t have energy , your team will be down , &quot; he said . &quot; But if you have a lot of energy , a weak team can be good and a good team can be great. &quot; Lu said his assertive personality and upbeat manner are products of a demanding childhood . The youngest of five children , he was born in Shanghai on May 4 , 1934 . Although his parents were employed , Lu said his family was very poor and that &quot; life in China was very hard. &quot; &quot; Being very poor made me strong-willed , outgoing and aggressive , &quot; he said . &quot; I have to be that way to get what I want. &quot; As a multitalented athlete who competed in volleyball , basketball , soccer , gymnastics and table_tennis , Lu spent much of his childhood living with friends because &quot; their parents liked the fact that I could teach their children sports. &quot; Like millions of his countrymen , however , Lu ' s life was altered dramatically in the aftermath of the Chinese civil_war , which pitted the Communist forces of Mao Tse-tung against Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist army . The war began in 1946 -- shortly after World_War_II and China ' s liberation from Japanese rule -- and ended in 1949 when the Communists defeated the nationalists and drove Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters to the island of Taiwan , where they established Nationalist_China . Lu ' s father and sister had been living_in Taiwan during the war because economic opportunities there were better , but in the aftermath , travel between the island and the new People ' s Republic_of_China became severely limited and remained that way until the early part of this decade . Lu ' s parents never saw each other again -- his mother died in 1976 , his father in 1991 -- and he and his three brothers never saw their father again . Lu and his sister , Jin , were reunited in 1992 after 43 years , yet he seems to take solace in the fact that a separation like theirs was commonplace in postwar China . &quot; It was very sad , very tough for our family , &quot; Lu said . &quot; But a lot of families were like us . Hundreds of thousands , maybe millions , went_through the same thing. &quot; Shortly after the civil_war ended , Lu turned his athletic attention to volleyball . He was a setter on the city of Beijing ' s professional team for most of the 1960s and played_on the national team several times during that period . From 1968-81 , he coached the Beijing women ' s team , and in 1982 and 1983 , he coached the Mexican women ' s national team after being encouraged to do so by Ruben Acosta , now president of the International Volleyball Federation . It was during the 1970s and early 1980s that Lu earned his reputation as one of the world ' s top technical coaches . Arie Selinger , the U.S. women ' s coach in the 1984 Olympic Games , Doug Beal , the U.S. men ' s coach in ' 84 , and Marv Dunphy , the U.S. men ' s coach in ' 88 , are among the people who consider Lu a volleyball guru . Selinger helped Lu land the assistant coaching position at UC Santa Barbara , where he helped Kathy Gregory guide the Gauchos to a 231-121 record in 10 seasons . Santa Barbara qualified for the NCAA Division I playoffs during each of those years and was annually regarded_as one of the top defensive teams in the nation . Lu does not foresee instant success at Northridge , however . He inherits a program that is expected to have five senior starters next season , but Lu figures it will take two or three years before the Matadors -- with a roster comprising players he recruited -- completely reflect his coaching philosophy . Moreover , it might be another year or two before Northridge can rid itself of the stigma surrounding the program and the resultant recruiting disadvantage in the wake of Ker ' s sudden resignation in January of 1993 . Ker , who guided the Matadors to a 401-144 record over 14 seasons , cited &quot; family considerations &quot; for his decision . Later it was learned that Ker ' s resignation came_after two Northridge players filed a written complaint accusing him of sexual_harassment . Other former players also alleged that in the early 1980s , Ker had consensual sexual_relations with team members . Price , who guided Northridge to a runner-up finish in the NCAA men ' s championships last year , replaced Ker on a one-year interim basis after the four finalists for the job declined the position . Although Northridge won three NCAA Division II titles during the 1980s , the Matadors have qualified for the playoffs only once since moving to the Division I level in 1990 . &quot; It is impossible in one year to be successful , &quot; Lu said . &quot; You must be prepared to fail because your most-successful experiences are when you fail , not when you succeed. &quot; Lu is painfully aware of the difference in the way the Matador men ' s and women ' s teams are perceived . &quot; ( John Price ) can go_to recruits and say , ' We finished second in the nation , ' &quot; Lu said . &quot; Because of the program ' s success , his voice will be very loud and very strong . But it is different with the women ' s team . . . . Some people still don ' t know that Northridge is a Division I program. &quot; So why did Lu come_to Northridge , where he will have to battle traditional powers Cal State Long_Beach , UCLA , USC and UC Santa Barbara for recruits ? More_than anything , he wanted a collegiate program to call his own . Although he is grateful for the opportunity at UCSB , it was Kathy Gregory who got the credit . She was Northwest Region coach of the year in 1986 , ' 90 and ' 93 , the Big West coach of the year in 1990 and ' 93 , and the Division I coach of the year last season . &quot; At UCSB , the head coach recruited and handled other matters , &quot; Lu said matter-of-factly . &quot; I handled everyday training and year-round training . But at the end of the season , she was the one who got this award or that award. &quot; Despite the esteem he holds_in the volleyball community , it seems that &quot; The Professor &quot; would like to win a_few awards of_his_own at Northridge .</TEXT>
