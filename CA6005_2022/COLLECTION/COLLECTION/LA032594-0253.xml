   <HEADLINE> A DAY OF MOURNING ; PACOIMA : EATERY FILLS WITH SPECULATION AND REGRET AFTER THE KILLING . AREA RESIDENTS BLAME THE DRUG CARTEL , THE CHIAPAS REBELS AND THE SYSTEM ITSELF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At Lenchita ' s , a small restaurant and tortilleria in Pacoima favored by Mexican immigrants , reaction to the assassination of the man who would be president of Mexico varied from conspiracy theories involving Indian rebels from Chiapas or vengeful drug lords to indifference to a political_system that has allowed one party to rule for more_than 65 years . &quot; Something like this had to happen for things to change in Mexico , &quot; said Bernardo Quintana , 45 , who grew_up in Mexico and El Paso , Tex . Colosio &quot; was a beautiful person , but unfortunately he was with the old political system. &quot; The mystery surrounding the motives of the assassin who shot Luis Donaldo Colosio , 44 , the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , at a campaign appearance in Tijuana , left room for speculation among the noisy lunch crowd at Lenchita ' s . Although Mexican authorities arrested Mario Aburto Martinez , 23 , for the shooting , no motive had been determined when diners gathered_in the sparsely decorated restaurant tucked behind a Mexican deli and grocery_store in the 13600 block of Van Nuys Boulevard . &quot; I think it is connected to the Zapatista rebels from Chiapas , &quot; said Luis Saavedra , 21 , who left Michoacan seven years ago and now lives_in Pacoima . Saavedra noted that the accused gunman was originally from Michoacan . &quot; People from Michoacan love Cardenas , &quot; he said , referring to Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , 1988 presidential candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party , who many thought had actually won the election but was denied victory by PRI election officials . * The PRI has won every presidential election in 65 years and Colosio , in turn , was the handpicked successor of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , a practice resented by many Mexicans who would prefer a democratic vote . &quot; I think things are changing in Mexico , &quot; said Saavedra ' s dining_companion , Raul Sanchez of Zamora , oblivious to the patting sound of women making tortillas behind the counter . &quot; They ' re not stealing as much. &quot; But Maria Samano of San Fernando said that making the Indian rebels the prime suspects is exactly what drug dealers want . &quot; To me , it ' s the drug cartel that shot him , &quot; said Samano , 40 , who left her native Colima state in Mexico 30 years ago . &quot; They want to make_it look political , like it stems from Chiapas. &quot; Samano said she fears that violence and terrorism will break_out in Mexico and is now uncertain if she will allow her two teen-age daughters to travel alone to visit relatives there this summer . * Brenda Rivera , 28 , of Mission Hills , who was eating lunch with her parents , Andrew and Gloria Hernandez , sees the assassination not as a political issue but as a human tragedy . &quot; I don ' t know too_much about Mexican politics , but I think it is a shame that this would happen to someone who is trying to help others , &quot; Rivera said over the din of crying children and clanging silverware . &quot; For whatever reason , violence is not the answer . Rivera ' s mother , who described herself as a devout Jehovah ' s witness , said it ' s now all_in the hands of God . &quot; Politicians promise a lot but they don ' t deliver because they are not perfect , &quot; said Gloria Hernandez , a native of Durango , Mexico . &quot; But God is perfect . Men are not going_to be able to solve the problems of the world . Only God can do that. &quot;</TEXT>
