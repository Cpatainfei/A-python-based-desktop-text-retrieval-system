   <HEADLINE> COALITION ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR AIDS MEMORIAL WALL ON EASTSIDE ; HEALTH : SUPPORTERS HOPE THE MONUMENT WILL BREAK_DOWN A ' WALL OF DENIAL ' IN LATINO COMMUNITY ABOUT THE DISEASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Plans were announced Thursday for &quot; The Wall -- Las Memorias , &quot; a proposed memorial to be built_on Los Angeles ' Eastside to alert the Latino community to the deadly threat of AIDS . Tina Escareno , whose 25-year-old daughter died of AIDS , hopes to see it built soon &quot; so that grandmothers won ' t have to hear their 3-year-old grandson asking , ' When is my mother coming_home ? ' &quot; The monument has yet to be designed or funded , but Escareno was_on hand to express hope that the project will &quot; break_down the wall of denial &quot; over AIDS in the Latino community . Newly reported cases of AIDS are increasing faster among Latinos in Los Angeles than in any other ethnic_group . One-third of all AIDS cases reported in the county in 1993 were among Latinos , up from about one-fifth in 1988 , according to preliminary county health department figures . Last year in the county there were 548 deaths of Latinos with AIDS . The Roman_Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles joined gay organizations and local groups and officials , including City Councilmen Richard Alatorre and Mike Hernandez , in endorsing the project at the proposed site of the memorial , Plaza de la Raza in Lincoln Park . The memorial is envisioned as a semicircular wall with murals depicting Latino culture and listing 2 # 000 Latinos who have died of AIDS . Planners hope to sponsor a contest in local high_schools to select designs for the murals . Studies show that Latinas account_for a disproportionately high share of the women countywide who have AIDS or the human_immunodeficiency_virus that causes the deadly disease , and that many are passing the virus to their babies during pregnancy . Forty-two percent of the children in the county who have AIDS are Latino . Health officials believe those statistics reveal only part of the problem . Latinos , more_than any other group , seek treatment only in the late stages of the disease , officials say . Experts say ignorance , denial , shame and cultural and religious biases all contribute heavily to the spread of AIDS . Another factor is that illegal immigrants fear capture and deportation and do not seek testing or care_for AIDS . &quot; When you go_to a funeral on the Eastside and ask what did the person die of . . . sometimes ( you ' re met with ) silence , &quot; said Richard Zaldivar , an El Sereno activist leading the effort to build the memorial . &quot; We ' re not supposed to have this disease on the Eastside . We always believed it belonged on the other side of town . But that ' s not true anymore. &quot; Father Peter Liuzzi , the archdiocese ' s liaison to the lesbian and gay community , said he hopes the monument will &quot; educate and sensitize the Latino community about the reality of AIDS. &quot; &quot; The Catholic_Church is committed to education and prevention and outreach of compassion and solidarity with those who are infected by this disease , &quot; said Liuzzi , who has lost two cousins to AIDS . Part of the problem is that warnings often are in English rather than Spanish , said Dr. Aliza Lifshitz of the County AIDS Commission . Seeking to change that , federal health officials last week released controversial new commercials -- in English and Spanish -- that promote condom use to reduce the risk of AIDS transmission . Officials hope the public_service announcements will be broadcast on stations nationwide . &quot; Traditionally , the Latino community has always organized against enemies , such_as immigration raids , social injustice and discrimination , &quot; said Herbert Siguenza of the comedy group Culture Clash . &quot; AIDS is our new enemy . &quot; We all know a lover , a relative , a friend who has died of AIDS , &quot; he said . &quot; And if you don ' t , you will. &quot;</TEXT>
