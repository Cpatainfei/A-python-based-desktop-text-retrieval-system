   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / GRAHAME L . JONES ; WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; ITALY SHOWS GRACE , BULGARIA LOSES CHARM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; After the match is when you do the analysis , &quot; Bulgaria ' s Hristo Stoitchkov said . Well , it can hardly be done beforehand , can it ? But then , the Bulgarians got just about everything backward on Wednesday , losing to Italy , 2-1 , and seldom looking anything like the team that had beaten Argentina and Germany on its way to the World Cup semifinals . Where the Italians were quick , the Bulgarians were slow . Where the Italians were inventive , the Bulgarians were uncomplicated . Where the Italians were daring , the Bulgarians were dull . Both teams are now headed for Pasadena , but one will be playing in a largely meaningless third-place game Saturday and the other will be playing for the Cup on Sunday . After a 12-year wait , Italy is back in the World Cup_final . Only one member of this Italian team -- defender and captain Franco Baresi -- was_on Italy ' s 1982 World Cup-winning squad . And back then Baresi was a reserve . Now , even though he is recovering from an injury and diagnostic surgery only three weeks ago , Baresi could be called_on to step onto the greatest soccer stage of all and play in the final . If he does , it will be a fitting climax to a marvelous international career . But that ' s another story . The reason Italian Coach Arrigo Sacchi might be forced to play Baresi is that central defender Alessandro Costacurta made the biggest mistake of his career Wednesday , fouling Stoitchkov and earning a second yellow card that will keep him out of the final . It was virtually the only serious error the Italians made on an afternoon when they entertained a Giants Stadium crowd of 77 # 094 with what was unquestionably their best performance of the tournament . Led , not surprisingly , by Roberto Baggio , Italy was unstoppable during one 10-minute spell midway through the first_half . that ' s when Baggio scored his two goals and had the fans tossing flags at him in delight . The Bulgarians , whose defense had been one of the team ' s strongpoints , had no answer_for Baggio , who danced past both Zlatko Iankov and Petar Houbtchev before slotting the ball past goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov for his first goal . On his second , he simply outran the defense and fired a superb pass from Demetrio Albertini beyond Mihaylov ' s reach . Just like that it was 2-0 and the game was , for all intents and purposes , over . Italy ' s performances had been sporadic during its first five games , with occasional touches of inspiration surrounded by hours of plodding play . Beset by injuries and suspensions , the Azzurri seemed incapable of 90 minutes of coherent soccer . All that changed Wednesday . With Baggio and the unheralded Pierluigi Casiraghi playing as twin strikers up front and the midfield of Nicola Berti , Albertini , Dino Baggio and Roberto Donadoni winning the majority of its battles , the Italians were in command from the start . Albertini was especially effective . He started by probing the Bulgarian defense for weaknesses with long passes into the penalty area , then , after Baggio had given Italy the lead , began firing a_few shots himself . The first of these could easily have found the net . Antonio Benarrivo , whose excellent play_at left back has made him one of the discoveries of this tournament , started the move when he dribbled past Ilian Kiriakov on the left_wing and crossed to Roberto Baggio , who played the ball back into the path of Albertini . Albertini unleashed a fierce shot that slammed into the right post before being cleared . Seconds later , Albertini fired another stinging shot that Mihaylov did_well to tip_over the crossbar . This span of excellence was climaxed by Roberto Baggio ' s second goal . From then on , it was simply a matter of playing_out the last hour . The game ' s quality dropped perceptibly , especially after Stoitchkov had cut Bulgaria ' s deficit in half . There was nothing worth noting in the second 45 minutes . Bulgaria did not have the talent to pierce Italy ' s back four of Roberto Mussi , Costacurta , Paolo Maldini and Benarrivo , and goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was seldom troubled . The Bulgarians later complained that referee Joel Quiniou of France had twice denied them penalty kicks and was perhaps biased against Bulgaria . The claims were ludicrous and served only to impugn the reputation of a capable and experienced official . Italy was the better team and Italy is in the final . &quot; After the match is when you do the analysis , &quot; Stoitchkov said . But all he did was complain .</TEXT>
