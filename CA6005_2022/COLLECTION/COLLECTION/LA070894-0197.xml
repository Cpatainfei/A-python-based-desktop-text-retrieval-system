   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; WHAT DID HE SAY ? ; THEY MAY NOT SPEAK SAME LANGUAGE , BUT REFEREES CAN STILL PICK UP ON PLAYERS ' INTENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sandor Puhl , who is Hungarian , has been assigned to referee Saturday ' s World Cup quarterfinal game between Italy and Spain . According to his official biography , he speaks Hungarian and German . So if an Italian player calls him a goat or a Spanish player demeans his heritage , Puhl probably will not understand the exact terminology . But he doesn ' t have to be fluent in Italian or Spanish to get the gist of a player ' s remarks , pull_out his notebook and issue a yellow card for dissent or ungentlemanly conduct . Jose Torres Cadena of Colombia speaks Spanish , English and Portuguese . It ' s unlikely that he would know a Bulgarian vulgarity if he heard one , or that he would blush at a string of German curses if they were said with a smile . He will referee Sunday ' s quarterfinal game between Bulgaria and Germany , and , like Puhl , he need not be able to chat with players to decide that one has questioned his authority and deserves a caution . But how do referees know players are cursing them if they don ' t speak the languages of the teams whose games they are officiating ? &quot; Good question , &quot; said David Will , chairman of the FIFA referees ' committee . And the answer is that they often don ' t know . Not precisely , anyway . &quot; FIFA doesn ' t give you a dictionary , &quot; said Roy Gatewood , who has officiated at every level in the United States and was a FIFA referee liaison for World Cup games played in Orlando , Fla . &quot; You don ' t have time for one of those Sharp ( pocket ) translators . &quot; In a lot of instances , it ' s as much connotation and circumstance as what ' s actually said . It ' s not so_much cursing as the way a player is going at the ref or at another player. &quot; In the World Cup tournament , assignments are made based on the official ' s performances , not on the languages he speaks . His compatibility with his linesmen might be considered , but his fluency in the languages spoken by the competitors is not a factor . Even referees who speak an array of languages rarely are assigned to games in which they can use those skills . Peter Mikkelsen of Denmark , who speaks Danish , English , German and French ; Mario van der Ende of the_Netherlands , fluent in Dutch , English , French and German , and Manuel Diaz Vega of Spain , who can converse in Spanish , Portuguese , Italian and English , are the most versatile linguists on FIFA ' s tournament referee list . Yet even though they might be able to work as United Nations translators , they would need help to talk to players in most of the games they have officiated . Mikkelsen worked a first-round game between Spain and South_Korea . No Danish there . Van der Ende refereed Italy-Ireland -- he might have understood the_Irish players , but not the Italians . Diaz Vega was assigned the_Netherlands ' opener against Saudi_Arabia . If FIFA had wanted someone who could speak_to the Saudis , it could have sent Jamal Al-Sharif of Syria , who speaks Arabic and English . But Al-Sharif was busy refereeing Colombia ' s game against Romania . His second-round assignment was Mexico-Bulgaria . Puhl ' s other games included Brazil-Sweden and Norway-Mexico . No Hungarian spoken there . FIFA won ' t allow its referees and linesmen to talk with reporters during the tournament . However , Will , whose committee assigns the officials , and officials who have worked in top-level competition say a language_barrier is not a problem . Boorish behavior and what Will called &quot; visible protestation &quot; are obvious no matter the language , and the rules that deal with those cases are equally clear . Said Bob Heilmann of Tampa , Fla. , a FIFA-certified linesman who worked qualifying games leading_up to this World Cup , &quot; We have a handbook to help us , but it ' s not help in terms of learning what the F-word is in Spanish . It ' s survival skills , medical tips , how to say , ' Where is the bathroom ? ' not how to say , ' Go_to hell ! ' &quot; I ' m sure I ' ve been cursed in other languages . Many times I ' ve done games involving Greek teams , players with Greek backgrounds . They may be saying things about me I don ' t understand . My attitude is , ' Is he coming at me and is it dissentful and disrespectful ? ' &quot; Said Will : &quot; The referee has to judge by the player ' s action and tone . It really comes_down to dissent of the decision , if a player visibly protests in dissent of a decision. &quot; Will , who never refereed but has spent 20 years on national and international referees ' committees , also believes referees can give players leeway when emotions are running high . &quot; The laws give the referee discretion , &quot; Will said . &quot; He can shake his finger and say , ' that ' s enough of that , ' or give a yellow card if he wants to make_it formal . If ( the dissent ) continues , he has the right to order a player off , but only in an extreme case , such_as if he pushes or jostles the referee. &quot; To Gatewood , the key_word is discretion . &quot; In the high_school and college ranks , if ( a player ' s dissent ) is audible , it ' s a yellow card , &quot; he said . &quot; In some of those games that are_on TV , you can read the player ' s lips . In a larger stadium , you might be more tolerant because you can ' t hear what he ' s saying. &quot; Sometimes , it ' s not what a player says , but what he does . Germany ' s Stefan Effenberg displayed his middle_finger to the crowd after he was taken_out of a game against South_Korea , but Coach Berti Vogts sent him home before FIFA could take action . Romania sent striker Ion Vladoiu home for committing a vicious foul against Switzerland ' s Stephane Chapuisat and for arguing with an assistant coach . Joseph ( Sepp ) Blatter , general secretary of FIFA , said the organization would have suspended Effenberg had the gesture been reported and praised the two countries ' actions as in keeping with the spirit of fair play . Said FIFA press secretary Guido Tognoni : &quot; We believe behavior on the field is improving . . . . If you look_on the ( field ) you see many nice gestures between the players . This is what we like and not what we have seen too_much of in the past. &quot; But he hasn ' t seen every game and every gesture . &quot; I was a spectator at the Morocco-Netherlands game , &quot; Heilmann said . &quot; The referee was Peruvian ( Alberto Tejada Noriega ) . Moroccans speak whatever they speak , the Dutch speak whatever they speak . So he probably didn ' t understand what they might have said . &quot; I ' m convinced some of ( the seven cautions Noriega issued ) were for hand gestures . . . a ' give me a break ' kind of gesture , which is interpreted as ungentlemanly. &quot; Heilmann learned the hard way that it ' s important to pay close attention to gestures . &quot; I had the good_fortune of teaching a year in Boston and I was coaching hockey , &quot; he said . &quot; There were a lot of Italian kids on the team . I made a physical gesture that I thought nothing of , but the boys were aghast . I didn ' t know it , but it meant something else entirely to them . . . . &quot; The middle_finger is universal . An arm swing and slap across the biceps is too . Otherwise , we can pick it up and we deal with it accordingly . &quot; The great thing about soccer is it ' s universal . You don ' t need a common language. &quot;</TEXT>
