   <HEADLINE> CONGRESSIONAL SHAKE-UP SENDS SHOCK_WAVES ABROAD ; FOREIGN_POLICY : THE GOP ' S HUGE VICTORY CATCHES MANY INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS BY SURPRISE . TRADE , AID CONCERNS ARE RAISED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the eyes of the world on Thursday , President Clinton looked_like the walking wounded , facing two years of legislative gridlock with Republicans in control of Congress and the prospect of a one-term presidency . Political commentators -- from Asia to Europe and liberal to conservative -- expressed surprise over the scope of Democratic losses and concern that the Republican congressional majority could mean more isolationism and less commitment to free_trade . Across the map , newspapers and political commentators debated whether the Democrats ' drubbing was the result of a &quot; morose national mood , &quot; as the_French daily Le Figaro suggested -- that is , part of a global anti-incumbent trend -- or whether it marked a true shift to the right by the United States , as Canada ' s Toronto Star determined . &quot; Most voters embraced the Republican platform of fighting crime with more police , fighting the world with more defense spending and fighting the poor by slashing services and cutting taxes , &quot; the Star ' s editorial said . In either case , Clinton was the clear loser to just about anyone looking_at the electoral upheaval in the world ' s surviving superpower . The Republican victory was welcomed in some parts of the world , although few newspapers had kind words for the GOP ' s leaders . A reporter for Britain ' s pro-business Financial Times described House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) as &quot; a slash-and-burn conservative &quot; and another said Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R-N.Y ) would be the GOP &quot; chief attack_dog &quot; on the Whitewater affair as the new chairman of the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee . A commentary in Germany ' s conservative Die Welt newspaper called the prospect of 91-year-old Sen . Strom Thurmond ( R-S.C. ) at the head of the Armed Services Committee &quot; depressing. &quot; But most comment was reserved for the likely chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , right-wing Sen . Jesse Helms of North Carolina , whom even the conservative Times of London called &quot; a loose cannon. &quot; In foreign_policy issues , &quot; Bill_Clinton will find himself on a leash held by the all-powerful Senate , &quot; said an editorial in the left-leaning French newspaper Liberation . &quot; To be sure , Clinton ' s foreign_policy , particularly in Europe , was considered chaotic . But now national isolationism has a beautiful future ahead of it. &quot; Likewise , various newspapers added , there is a new generation of more populist Republican leaders , which means that the GOP is no longer necessarily the party of free_trade . Immediately at stake on the trade front is ratification of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ' s Uruguay Round pact , on which Congress is scheduled to vote later this month . The pact , the result of years of painful negotiations , is meant to dramatically reduce world trade_barriers and would create the World Trade Organization as the watchdog successor to GATT on Jan . 1 , 1995 . Failure to ratify the pact this year could deal &quot; a mortal blow &quot; to the multilateral trading system , GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland warned in Brussels . Clinton is scheduled to discuss trade with leaders of Pacific Rim nations in Jakarta , Indonesia , later this week and with Latin_American leaders in Miami on Dec . 9 and 10 . In Japan , some analysts voiced hope that traditional , pro-business Republicans would put a brake on the Administration ' s &quot; managed trade &quot; approach to Japan , which calls_for trade agreements based on measurable results , such_as a larger U.S. market share . But others feared that a Republican-dominated Congress would increase pressure on Tokyo to cut its bureaucratic red_tape and dismantle other hidden barriers that prevent newcomers from entering the Japanese market . The biggest concern centered_on Helms . The Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper , echoing other analysts , noted that Helms had strongly advocated sanctions against Japan in 1987 , when a Toshiba subsidiary was discovered to have sold submarine technology to the then-Soviet Union in violation of international agreements . &quot; He is known as a hard-liner toward Japan , &quot; the paper said . Helms has strong opinions on just about every foreign_policy issue . While it is widely known that he has called Haiti ' s President Jean-Bertrand Aristide &quot; a psychopath , &quot; it is less known that he has been an undying supporter of Taiwan in its 50-year conflict with China , though the United States does not recognize Taiwan as an independent country . Taiwan , along with the issue of human_rights , is among the most visceral for China ' s Communist leadership , which continues to view Taiwan as a province . Meanwhile , in Russia , which has been the most important foreign_policy issue for the Clinton_Administration , several political commentators expressed concern that Republican control of Congress could lead to a cooling of U.S-Russian relations . They predicted that Clinton will be pressed to distance the United States from Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin . &quot; The Republicans have been preparing_for a long_time for an attack against what as early as a year and a half ago was policy agreed upon by the two parties : the Russo-centric , East European orientation of the Administration , and also against the outdated policy of focusing_on the one figure ( Yeltsin ) in the Kremlin , &quot; wrote Izvestia ' s Washington correspondent . Because Republicans are viewed_as tough on Russia -- and sympathetic to an enlargement of NATO -- Poland and other former Communist countries eager for membership in the organization welcomed the U.S. election results . &quot; Today we have great support in both houses of the American Congress , &quot; said the centrist Zycie Warszawy newspaper . But in Germany , Europe ' s richest country and closest U.S. ally under Clinton , even the conservative Die Welt newspaper expressed fear that security issues in_general would be mishandled under feeble leadership . In Israel , the mass-circulation Yediot Aharanot worried that the Republican landslide might mean a reduction in aid -- Israel is the single largest recipient of U.S. aid -- and could lead to U.S. reluctance to contribute peacekeeping troops to police an eventual Israel-Syria peace_treaty . As the Israelis contemplate returning some or all_of the strategic Golan Heights to Syria , they are counting_on as_many as 1 # 000 U.S. troops participating in a multinational monitoring force that would be stationed in the area for years to come . Some Republicans , including Helms , have spoken against such a deployment of U.S. troops . &quot; American Jewish lobbyists are trying to calm us that no dramatic change is going_to take_place , not in the political support to Israel and not in the economic support . But the facts tell us otherwise , &quot; said the main editorial in Yediot on Thursday . Times staff writers Mary Curtius in Jerusalem , David Holley in Seoul , Teresa Watanabe in Tokyo , Scott Kraft in Paris , Dean E . Murphy in Warsaw , Rone Tempest in Beijing , William Tuohy in London and Craig Turner in Toronto contributed to this report , as did Andrei Ostroukh of The Times Moscow Bureau .</TEXT>
