   <HEADLINE> THE HIGH_SCHOOLS / MIKE HISERMAN : ARANGO ' S HIGHLIGHT COMES WITH A CATCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cameras were rolling at the Kennedy High football_field Friday night , most of them aimed in the direction of a receiver who hadn ' t caught a pass all season . They came_to capture the talents of Charlie Arango , and he didn ' t disappoint . In the third quarter , the Birmingham High senior was_on the receiving end of a 14-yard pass for a first down . The catch wasn ' t a big play in the game , which Kennedy won , 35-21 . But in the context of at least one young_man ' s life it was huge . Arango was born without a left hand , making his athletic career more challenging than most . &quot; It was great , &quot; Arango said . &quot; When I caught_it , a lot of pressure left my body. &quot; Arango estimates he had been the intended target of four other passes this season , all_of which fell incomplete . His teammates were happy for him , but at_the_same_time remained measured in their congratulations . To act too excited would have been a slap at Arango ' s talent . &quot; It was like normal , an everyday thing , &quot; said Birmingham wingback Tony Nichols , one of Arango ' s closest friends . &quot; Tony makes that catch all_the time in practice . It ' s not like we didn ' t know he could do it. &quot; Arango ' s catch was captured on film by three local television_camera crews . KCBS showed the play_on its sportscast Friday night . Arango , who was the subject of a feature story in The Times last month , was the focus of segments aired by KNBC and KMEX on Saturday . Now , if only that play would have gone_for a touchdown . . . . &quot; that ' s my only dream , my only goal that ' s left , &quot; he said . Stay tuned . * Eddie Lopez , Sylmar High ' s free safety , has the size college recruiters like to see in a defensive back . He is a tall and sinewy 6-foot-2 , 190 pounds . A converted quarterback , Lopez also possesses the requisite mental attributes for the job . He anticipates passing routes . His coach says he &quot; has a tremendous nose for the football. &quot; And he has speed . You want to talk_about speed ? We take you into the coaches ' office at Sylmar and roll some film . Sylmar vs . Reseda , second quarter : The Reseda quarterback is scrambling for his life . Lopez , dutifully patrolling the secondary , mistakenly comes_up_to protect against a run . The quarterback pulls_up and lofts a pass toward tight_end Alonso Arreola . Lopez is beaten . He has Arreola ahead of him , the ball sailing above him and 10 breathless teammates , who are watching in horror . Sylmar hasn ' t allowed a point in 16 consecutive quarters or a passing touchdown all season . Arreola has about a five-yard advantage as he pulls_in the pass -- a lead that quickly disappears . Lopez hauls him down at the seven-yard line . In the midst of his furious sprint , Lopez said one image dominated his thoughts -- Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman , his face contorted with rage . &quot; If he scores , I didn ' t want to have to face coach , &quot; Lopez said . &quot; He was not going_to score. &quot; And so he didn ' t . And neither did Reseda . A few plays later , Arreola -- perhaps still winded -- was wide right on a 22-yard field-goal attempt . The scoreless streak , now up_to 19 quarters , was saved . But not Lopez . He still got an earful from Engilman once he made his way to the sideline . Fear is such a wonderful stimulant . * Two scary scenes . Two false alarms . Two fortunate young_men . Eyan Schreibman of El Camino Real and Steve McKeon of Hart were taken from their respective Friday night football games by ambulance . Schreibman , a running back and defensive back , stayed stretched_out on the field for an extended period because of a neck injury . McKeon , the quarterback for Hart , experienced dizziness , a headache and chills after guiding the Indians to a 42-19 victory over rival Canyon . Both were fine by Saturday . El Camino Real Coach Bob Ganssle said Schreibman was released shortly after being examined at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills . The injury , which limited Schreibman ' s head movement , turned_out to be a mild muscle strain . He is expected to be practicing in a_couple_of days . McKeon ' s injury also appeared worse than it was . His father , Joe , said doctors diagnosed a mild concussion .</TEXT>
