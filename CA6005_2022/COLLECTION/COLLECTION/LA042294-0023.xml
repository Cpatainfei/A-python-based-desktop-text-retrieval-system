   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG : THE MEDIA ' S WHITEWATER RIDE SINKS ; TELEVISION : AS THE PRESS WEIGHS IN ON COVERAGE OF THE SCANDAL , MORE PIZAZZ THAN TRUTH EMERGES . ABC ' S ' VIEWPOINT ' TURNED_OUT TO BE A FIASCO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> And the Lord said , &quot; Forget light . Let there be pizazz. &quot; The mainstream media often operate like a daytime talk_show that devotes 75 % of an hour to exposing and slopping around in the dysfunction of its guests , then brings_on an advice-giving therapist to clean_up the mess . When it comes_to Whitewater coverage , this is now the mess-cleaning phase . Coverage of the Whitewater hubbub is now getting_to be almost as controversial and is receiving almost as much attention as Whitewater itself . Has there been too_much ? Too_little ? Has the reporting been fair or unfair ? You know the terrain . On Tuesday , C-SPAN carried a Washington print journalists ' forum on the topic , moderated by Steve Roberts of U.S. News &amp; World Report . With him were Washington Post columnist Mary McGrory , Alan Murray of the Wall_Street Journal , Francis Coombs of the Washington Times , Stan Crock of Business Week , Ellen Hume of the Annenberg School of Communications , media specialist Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia and Jody Powell , who was press secretary under President Jimmy_Carter . A pretty fair mix , though Powell ' s credentials as an objective observer wobble like gelatin . You get the impression that journalists who participate in these televised self-awareness clinics -- offering occasional mea culpas and nodding knowingly about the foibles of media -- afterward return to their jobs and robotically get_back to business as usual . Yet this one was reasoned and informative , all_in all a relatively calm , introspective and arresting session that may have given viewers some insight into the process of spectacle . Media coverage of it , media making of it . The verdict on Whitewater coverage was sort of split_down the middle , with the media-attacking Powell making an especially valid point about the press being much less diligent about regularly covering its own missteps than those of other great and powerful institutions . Fascinating . Speaking of missteps , though , later that same evening ABC News weighed in on Whitewater coverage , with Ted Koppel chairing a wee-hours &quot; Viewpoint &quot; discussion at Drake University in Des Moines , Iowa . On paper , it was a good idea . As information , though , it turned_out to be a fiasco . The panel ( whose initial salvos were later followed by mostly partisan questions from the studio audience ) included ABC News correspondent Brit Hume ; Bob Bartley , editorial page editor of the Wall_Street Journal ; Geneva Overholser , editor of the Des Moines Register ; attorney and First_Amendment specialist Floyd Abrams and Max Frankel , outgoing executive editor of the New York Times . Reasonable choices , though heavily tilted in support of aggressive Whitewater coverage , with the exception of Abrams . Deployed as centerpieces of this round-table , however , were shrill , knee-jerk , hyperbolizing political partisans James Carville and Rush Limbaugh , the latter participating by satellite . Sweet , lovable guys ? Of course . Do you even have to ask ? Except that Carville is the Democratic Party eel who steered President Clinton ' s White_House campaign and who now functions as a presidential adviser . Whatever his boss and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton do , he publicly endorses . Bank on it . And Limbaugh is the conservative comedian / radio and TV personality who never met an anti-Clinton slur he didn ' t like . Whatever the President and First_Lady do , he publicly opposes . Bank on it . Yes , what great choices to headline a dispassionate , illuminating tour of the ins and outs of Whitewater coverage . Inevitably , &quot; Viewpoint &quot; essentially became a partisan war between the predictable Carville and Limbaugh -- including a shrill fight about Clinton policy -- with ABC at times seeking to maximize its two stars by presenting them on split screen . What did all_of this point / counterpoint burlesque have to do with media coverage ? Often times nothing , unless you count what it said about the way some in the media examine media coverage . That included Overholser concluding , in_effect , that the studio audience ' s interest in Whitewater exemplified the general public ' s curiosity about the subject , which , in turn , validated the intensity of Whitewater reporting . that ' s a classic . In other words , it goes this way : The press creates and nourishes a story . Once in the public arena , that story proceeds to take_on a life of its own . Then the press uses the controversy it created as justification for its coverage , regardless of the story ' s disputed news value . If that has the ring of exotic doublespeak , then consider Limbaugh ' s &quot; Viewpoint &quot; denial of any responsibility for helping spread wild rumors concerning the suicide of White_House attorney Vincent Foster . It was_on March 10 that Limbaugh told his millions of listeners to &quot; brace yourselves &quot; for the contents of a fax he ' d received saying a Washington consultant firm was about to charge that Foster &quot; was murdered in an apartment owned by Hillary Clinton , and the body was then taken_to Fort Mercy Park. &quot; Following a commercial break , Limbaugh repeated what he now said was &quot; rumor , &quot; that a report would be published saying Foster ' s &quot; suicide was not a suicide. &quot; Much later in his broadcast , he attributed the &quot; rumor &quot; to an item in a newsletter from the Washington firm of Johnson Smick , which he said claimed that Foster had taken his life in an apartment owned by White_House associates , and that his body was later moved to the park where it was discovered . Thus , the newsletter had not mentioned an alleged murder or the First_Lady . And what it did charge -- a body-moving conspiracy -- has never been substantiated . Even giving Limbaugh the benefit of the doubt and crediting him for ultimately moderating the various versions of his &quot; brace yourselves &quot; bulletin , sending such wild speculation across the airwaves under any label was reckless . After all , many of his listeners accept everything that comes from his lips as fact . More importantly , meanwhile , was &quot; Viewpoint &quot; throbbing , electrifying television or what ? &quot; One of the reasons we asked you on , &quot; Koppel acknowledged good-naturedly to Carville and Limbaugh during a break_in the din , &quot; was that we knew you ' d bring a little pizazz to the program. &quot; Compared with C-SPAN , much pizazz , little light .</TEXT>
