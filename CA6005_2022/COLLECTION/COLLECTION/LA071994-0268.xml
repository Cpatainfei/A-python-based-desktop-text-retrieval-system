   <HEADLINE> STUDY CRITICIZES MODEST HEALTH REFORM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping to turn_up the heat on uncommitted lawmakers , President Clinton ' s allies on Capitol_Hill released a study Monday indicating that middle-class people who have health_insurance will pay higher premiums if Congress passes a health reform measure that falls_short_of guaranteeing universal coverage . In framing universal coverage as a middle-class issue , they hope to take some of the momentum out of several incremental measures that are gaining favor in both houses of Congress . At a news_conference , Sen . Patty Murray ( D-Wash. ) urged fellow members of Congress to &quot; remind ourselves what it is that we are trying to achieve and who we are trying to benefit. &quot; &quot; We want to put all_the pressure we can on wavering senators , &quot; added Sen . John D . ( Jay ) Rockefeller IV ( D-W.Va. ) , one of the Clinton plan ' s most ardent supporters . He contended that the modest measure that many lawmakers view_as an &quot; easy step &quot; would be &quot; a fatal blow to their constituents who are working middle-class Americans. &quot; The more modest approach , which is being touted in various forms by lawmakers of both parties , would encourage more competition among health providers and eliminate many widely criticized insurance industry practices , such_as those that make_it difficult for people with known illnesses to buy coverage . The various alternatives also would provide government subsidies to help those at or near the poverty_line afford health_insurance . Such proposals would not meet Clinton ' s bottom-line goal of assuring that everyone has health_insurance . The study by the Virginia consulting_firm Lewin-VHI Inc. , was commissioned by the Catholic Health Assn . of the United States . It indicated that the incremental approach would be more expensive for insured families earning between $ 20 # 000 and $ 75 # 000 a year . The firm concluded that , absent a requirement that everyone buy coverage , new policy-holders would in_general be sicker than the population as_a_whole , and , therefore , more expensive to cover . By comparison , it concluded , a bill guaranteeing universal coverage would lower the health costs of middle-class people who now have health_insurance , if it were combined with government-imposed cost constraint , such_as that envisioned in the Clinton plan . For a family earning between $ 30 # 000 and $ 40 # 000 , for instance , health costs would rise about $ 344 in 1998 under the incremental approach ; its spending would decline $ 165 in a system under which everyone was required to have coverage .</TEXT>
