   <HEADLINE> MANACLES ON ' CLEAN HANDS ' ? ; MAGISTRATE ' S RESIGNATION COULD SET_BACK ITALIAN CORRUPTION INQUIRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Antonio di Pietro , the Milan magistrate who has set the pace in Italy ' s long-running &quot; clean hands &quot; investigation into government corruption , abruptly announced his resignation Tuesday . He claimed he was being abused both by those who wished to interfere with his investigation and those who wished to use it for their own political ends . It was time , he said , to &quot; depersonalize &quot; the investigation by ending his association with it . Di Pietro has undeniably personified the &quot; clean hands &quot; investigation for millions of Italians , inspiring a country in which political corruption has been regarded_as inevitable with his own bold conviction that there need be nothing inevitable about it . After Di Pietro ' s announcement , newspapers in Italy were reportedly deluged with faxes urging him to reconsider . The popular fear , and we share it , is that a deeply salutary development in Italian political life may now be at risk . Di Pietro and his colleagues seemed on the point of truly changing the course of Italian history . A politician may defeat another politician , but this magistrate and the many for whom he was the leader and symbol defeated an entire political_party and overthrew a political regime . The Christian Democratic Party , dominant in Italy since the end of World_War_II , was so ruined by exposure of its pervasive corruption that the path was clear for a fresh_start . Ironically , the biggest beneficiary of &quot; clean hands &quot; may now have become its worst enemy . Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi ' s newly formed party , Forza Italia ( the name means , roughly , &quot; Go , Italy ! &quot; ) , came_to power by promising an end to the politics-as-usual that &quot; clean hands &quot; had exposed . However , as the continuing investigation has brought Berlusconi ' s giant Fininvest company and , finally , the prime_minister himself under scrutiny , he has suddenly discovered the virtues of &quot; normality . . . in the administration of justice. &quot; If Di Pietro is quitting , has Berlusconi won ? Like so many Italians , we hope not . Italy has celebrated Di Pietro because his investigation did not shrink_from indicting even Bettino Craxi , formerly prime_minister , now a fugitive_from_justice . Berlusconi may well have done nothing wrong , but Di Pietro ' s departure must_not be allowed to mean that the old Italy has defeated the new , or that the prime_minister is above the law .</TEXT>
