   <HEADLINE> CHOLERA EPIDEMIC IN RUSSIA SPREADS TO CRIMEA ; 4 DEAD ; HEALTH : MORE CASES ARE EXPECTED . INFECTIOUS DISEASES FLOURISHING IN FORMER U.S.S.R. AS LIVING STANDARDS FALL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The cholera epidemic that has been ravaging southern Russia has spread to Crimea , killing four people and infecting 58 others , public health officials said Monday . The outbreak in Crimea , a Black_Sea peninsula that is an autonomous region within Ukraine , came just as Russian public health authorities were declaring that the epidemic that killed 15 people in Dagestan and infected at least 1 # 000 others was finally subsiding . &quot; We thought it was under_control , and suddenly again you have an outbreak , &quot; said Loreta Colatosti of the World_Health_Organization in Copenhagen . Crimean public health chief Boris Lezhentsev told the Itar-Tass news_agency that he expects the epidemic to worsen because of an acute water shortage , a heat_wave and generally poor sanitation . Crimea , a subtropical vacation_spot , has suffered a sharp economic decline and chronic political instability over the past three years as the ethnic Russian population has attempted to separate from Ukraine and rejoin Russia . In the Crimean capital of Simferopol , markets were shut Monday , streets were cleaned and hospital_beds were being readied , Itar-Tass reported . Infectious_diseases of all sorts have flourished in the former Soviet_Union as living standards here have declined . The number of diphtheria cases jumped this year in nearly all_of the former Soviet republics , except Estonia , which reported no incidents , WHO reports . Russia reported 15 # 229 diphtheria cases in 1993 , but registered 14 # 334 cases in the first seven months of 1994 , the data show . Azerbaijan has had a tenfold increase in measles , Uzbekistan suffered an outbreak of polio and typhoid_fever has reappeared in Russia . Tuberculosis and syphilis are widespread , and the incidence of such children ' s diseases as whooping_cough and German_measles has increased sharply . This summer also brought outbreaks of anthrax from infected cattle , fatal salmonella poisoning from contaminated food and leptospirosis from rodent-contaminated meat , according to Russian news_reports . The cholera epidemic is blamed on the new freedom to travel and contract the disease abroad , as well as inadequate treatment of water and sewage that helps spread the bacteria at_home . &quot; Cholera is a disease of poverty , &quot; said Dr. Maria Neira of WHO in Geneva . &quot; If you don ' t have hygienic conditions and minimal public health standards , the vibrio ( bacteria ) can spread very quickly . . . . In the former Soviet_Union , the health infrastructure is now broken. &quot; This summer , cholera has struck in Russia , Moldova , Ukraine and Belarus . Four deaths have been reported in the breakaway southern Russian republic of Chechnya , though there is no official confirmation . Russia has no problem treating cholera patients once they are hospitalized , and even in underdeveloped Dagestan there is no shortage of medicine , said Mikhail I . Narkeyevich of the Russian Ministry of Health . The last death in Dagestan occurred nearly a month ago , and few new cases are appearing , raising hopes that the epidemic there is at last under_control , he said .</TEXT>
