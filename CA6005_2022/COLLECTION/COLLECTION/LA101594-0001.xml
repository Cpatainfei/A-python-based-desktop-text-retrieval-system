   <HEADLINE> RABIN , PERES AND ARAFAT SHARE NOBEL ; HONOR : PEACE PRIZE AWARDED FOR HISTORIC AGREEMENT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS . BUT SOLDIER ' S ABDUCTION CREATES STRAIN BETWEEN PARTIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 1994 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat for the vision and courage of their efforts to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict after generations of war and bloodshed . The long legacy of Middle_East violence , however , obscured the new hope that the Norwegian Nobel Committee had wanted to celebrate ; the fragility of peacemaking here and the uncertainty of success were all too clear Friday . A 19-year-old Israeli soldier abducted by Islamic militants was killed in a fierce gun battle north of Jerusalem along with three of his captors and an Israeli officer leading a rescue team . Relations between Israel and the PLO had been thrown into a serious new crisis by the abduction . There were also angry protests -- even from within the Nobel committee , one of whose five members resigned -- over awarding the prestigious peace prize to Arafat , whose Palestine Liberation Organization had used terrorism for years in its struggle against Israel . And some Palestinian leaders complained that the award was not only premature but a Western attempt to win popular acceptance for agreements that remain controversial on the occupied West_Bank and that are rejected by most Palestinian refugees . But the Norwegian Nobel Committee was clear in its intention of strengthening the search for peace in the Middle_East . It expressed hope that &quot; the award will serve as encouragement to all Israelis and Palestinians who are endeavoring to establish lasting peace in the region. &quot; &quot; For several decades , the conflict between Israel and its neighbor states and between Israelis and Palestinians have been among the most irreconcilable and menacing in international politics , &quot; the committee said in announcing the award in Oslo . &quot; By concluding the Oslo Accords ( on Palestinian self-rule ) and subsequently following them up , Arafat , Peres and Rabin have made substantial contributions to a historic process through which peace and cooperation can replace war and hate. &quot; The award recognized Arafat ' s political courage in accepting Israel ' s existence and legitimacy . And it noted Rabin ' s recognition , in return , of the Palestinians ' aspirations for self-determination and the right to govern themselves . &quot; This prize is for the whole nation , for the citizens of the state of Israel , for the bereaved families and the disabled , for the hundreds of thousands who have fought in Israel ' s wars , &quot; Rabin said in a statement . &quot; The work is not yet finished -- and the prize is a prize for the future more_than it is a reward for the efforts for peace that have been made_up until now. &quot; Arafat described the award as a tribute to Palestinians ' long struggle for recognition as a nation . &quot; This prize is not for me , &quot; he said in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria . &quot; It is for my people who have suffered much , for our martyrs , for our prisoners , for our children , so that we can have lasting peace. &quot; The inclusion of Peres , a surprise to some Nobel watchers , was a tribute both to his enduring vision of a Middle_East at_peace and the brilliance of his diplomacy in achieving the breakthrough agreement last year in months of secret negotiations with the PLO . &quot; We made the choice this way because we found it too difficult to distinguish between the efforts of Rabin and Peres , &quot; committee Chairman Francis Sejersted explained . &quot; On the ( Palestinian ) side , Arafat ' s contribution was clearly the most important. &quot; The three men will receive gold medals at a ceremony in Oslo on Dec . 10 , the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel , the Swedish industrialist who established the prizes , and they will share an award of $ 950 # 000 . Last year , the prize was awarded jointly to South_Africa ' s Nelson Mandela , now the nation ' s president , and his predecessor , Frederik W . de Klerk . It was the second time that the Nobel committee had honored participants in the search for a Middle_East peace : In 1978 , it had awarded the prize to Israeli Prime_Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat for their initiatives to make_peace between their two nations . The jubilation that might have been felt Friday both in Israel and the Palestinian territories was overshadowed by the death of kidnaped Israeli army Cpl . Nachshon Waxman , three of his Islamic militant captors and an Israeli officer during a botched rescue missue . Peres , in a statement expressing gratitude for the peace prize , delivered before the incident , said the militants had &quot; not only kidnaped a young_man . . . ( they were ) trying to kidnap the peace process and destroy it. &quot; Arafat , speaking after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher in Alexandria , said he was using all_the means that he had as chairman of the new Palestinian Authority -- ordering massive police searches of the Gaza Strip , roundups of Islamic militants and personal pleas to their leaders -- to try to secure Waxman ' s release . &quot; We are participants in preserving the peace from any acts of sabotage meant to damage this peace of the brave , &quot; he said . &quot; We hope the other side will understand that we should not give any extremist forces the chance to damage the peace process. &quot; The committee ' s decision to award the prize to Arafat was the most controversial in 20 years . Kaare Kristiansen , a conservative former government_minister in Norway , a staunch supporter of Israel and a member of the Nobel committee for three years , resigned in protest immediately after the announcement . He said the veteran guerrilla leader ' s &quot; past is too tainted with violence , terrorism and bloodshed , and his future is too unpredictable to make him a Nobel Peace Prize winner. &quot; In 1973 , the committee awarded the prize jointly to Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger and Le Duc Tho , a member of the Vietnamese Communist_Party Politburo , for their efforts to end the Vietnam_War . Two committee_members later resigned in protest , and Tho declined to accept the prize . Outside the Israeli Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem , right-wing demonstrators chanted &quot; Arafat is Hitler &quot; and &quot; Rabin and Peres are men of blood , &quot; and some carried Israeli flags painted with black lines . Benjamin Netanyahu , leader of the opposition Likud Party , called the award to Arafat &quot; shameful. &quot; &quot; The fact that the prize is given to the person who invented international terrorism , the archmurderer who says he decided to stop killing for a while but whose men killed seven Israelis this year -- this turns the prize into a farce , &quot; Netanyahu said . But Peres dismissed such criticism as simply blind to political realities . &quot; Peace is made with one ' s enemies , &quot; he declared . &quot; What ' s the alternative ? We all know that peace is made with yesterday ' s enemies so that there won ' t be a war tomorrow. &quot; Among Palestinians , there was criticism of a different kind . &quot; This is entirely premature , both for Arafat and for the Israelis , &quot; said Haidar Abdel-Shafi , the respected Gaza physician who led the Palestinian delegation to the Mideast peace talks . &quot; No one is certain that true peace will be realized in the region . All Israel ' s actions -- expansion of the settlements , the checkpoints and closures , the arrests -- show there is no peace. &quot; Hanan Ashrawi , chairwoman of the Palestinian Human_Rights Commission , called the award &quot; a tarnished trophy. &quot; &quot; The mission of peace has not been accomplished , and the peace process itself is in serious difficulties , &quot; she said . Mahmoud Zahhar , a leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip and a prominent critic of the accord , denounced Arafat as a &quot; servant of Western imperialism. &quot; &quot; It is_well known that this prize is only given to those who serve the policies of the West , &quot; Zahhar said to the cheers of worshipers at a Hamas-affiliated mosque in Gaza City . Secretary_of_State Christopher urged both sides to recognize the award as the commemoration of the &quot; great achievement of Arafat and Rabin in the peace accord signed just over a year ago in Washington and to keep the difficulties of reaching a full peace in perspective. &quot; &quot; We have to step back from the tragic events of the last few days , &quot; Christopher said , referring to the Waxman abduction , &quot; and remember the tremendous progress that was initiated by Prime_Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat. &quot; Times staff writer Norman Kempster in Alexandria , Egypt , researchers Dianna M . Cahn in Jerusalem and Summer Assad on the Israeli-occupied West_Bank also contributed to this report .</TEXT>
