   <TEXT> On a cool , breezy evening in Chinatown , beneath a soulful black-and-white portrait of a man wearing a turban and white beard , weekly visitors trickle into the comfortable living room of Lourdes and Vahid Sanaei . An unemployed secretary , a computer_programmer , a full-time mother , a flower shop owner , a building supervisor . White , black , Latino and Iranian . Some murmur an Arabic greeting : Allah ' u Abha : God is most glorious . Most have embarked_on spiritual quests to arrive here , at a Baha ' i &quot; fireside , &quot; an informal educational gathering that mingles believers in the Baha ' i faith with prospective followers and the merely curious . Under the photographic gaze of one of the faith ' s leaders , Baha ' is talked_about their independent religion . &quot; Los Angeles needs the Baha ' i faith , &quot; said Bob Hopper , 58 , a Baha ' i and a city tour guide who regularly attends firesides . &quot; Other religions have brought similar principles , but they need to be renewed and looked_at again , and that ' s what the Baha ' i faith does. &quot; Founded 150 years ago by a Tehran-born nobleman now called Baha ' u ' llah , the Baha ' i faith preaches unity through diversity and promotes a progressive agenda of social and economic justice and racial and gender equality . For believers , it is the means to accomplish what no war or political_movement has -- a peaceful world without borders uniting all people , all religions and gods . Baha ' u ' llah ' s central message , &quot; The earth is one country and mankind its citizens , &quot; followers say , has special resonance in Los Angeles , a city so recently shattered by racial divisions . &quot; We ' re pioneers in living_in unity and diversity , &quot; said Amin Banani , a Baha ' i and UCLA historian . &quot; Los Angeles is becoming a multiracial , multicultural place and we are a_people who have practiced living as a unified people and have a ( systematic ) plan for doing it. &quot; In Los Angeles , that plan has included launching an institute on healing racism , a multiethnic youth theater group and an after-school enrichment program and a multicultural gospel choir , all based out of the Baha ' i headquarters in Baldwin Hills . One of those groups , the Baha ' i Youth Workshop , founded in 1974 by Oscar and Freddie DeGruy in their living_room , has worked toward encouraging youths to find common interests . The traveling theater troupe , which has toured nationally , has included black , white , Latino , Asian , Iranian and about 10 % non-Baha ' i performers . As workshop members , &quot; they can be together from different religions and different cultures and different races and they can find a point of unity , &quot; Oscar DeGruy said . The group visits schools , community_centers and other sites and uses hip-hop , rap , jazz and other styles to address topics such_as peace , equality , education and social ills . &quot; We ' re brought_up to believe that if you don ' t fit , we don ' t want you , &quot; Oscar DeGruy said . &quot; We ' re all different for a reason and now it ' s time to share those differences with each other . . . . The Baha ' i faith gives ( the youths ) the opportunity to come together. &quot; The Los Angeles Baha ' i community ' s aim is to triple its active members from its base of 1 # 500 in the next two years . There are 5 # 000 active Baha ' i members in Southern California and about 110 # 000 nationwide . Already , the Baha ' i community in Southern California is one of the largest in the country . Its hub is the Baha ' i Center , located at the edge of Baldwin Hills at Rodeo Road and La Cienega Boulevard . Thornton Chase , an insurance_company executive who became the first American Baha ' i , is buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery and his grave site is considered a holy_place of pilgrimage . Los Angeles is also home to a Baha ' i radio show and Kalimat Press , one of three Baha ' i publishers in the country . The Los Angeles Baha ' i community formally organized in 1909 , making_it one of the country ' s earliest multiracial religious communities , said Muhtadia Rice , public information officer for the Baha ' is of Los Angeles . The religion forbids missionaries and Baha ' is are not allowed to proselytize , so the informal firesides held every week across the city are the foremost way believers spread the faith . Perhaps because of this low-key approach , the faith is relatively unknown , despite an 85-year presence in Los Angeles . &quot; We ' re confused with B ' nai B ' rith , we ' re confused with Buddhists , or people have never heard of us at all , &quot; Rice said . &quot; It ' s critical for us that we are accepted as credible and very mainstream. &quot; Islamic fundamentalists have called the Baha ' i heretics . Other critics dismiss the religion as a cult . Scholars still view the faith as somewhat new , small and exotic , and there are few non-Baha ' i specialists in academia . Nevertheless , said Diana Eck , a professor in comparative religions at Harvard_University , the Baha ' i faith is a world religion in the sense that , &quot; though it is neither very ancient nor very large , you can find Baha ' is all_over the world today. &quot; With 5 million members in 233 countries and territories worldwide , it is among the widest spread and fastest growing religions by percentage increase in the world , according to Baha ' i researchers . This modern faith has attracted followers ranging from entertainers Dizzy Gillespie and Jim Seals and Dash Crofts of the singing duo Seals &amp; Crofts , to jurists Dorothy W . Nelson , a U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge and her husband , retired state Judge James F . Nelson . The Nelsons have hosted weekly firesides in their home for 36 years , some of which have drawn more_than 200 people . &quot; At first we went_to firesides ( in the early 1950s ) to see if ( the Baha ' i religion ) was just one of those ' California things , ' &quot; admitted Dorothy Nelson , an elected member of the Baha ' i National Spiritual Assembly who was raised an Episcopalian . By 1954 , the Nelsons had left their traditional Christian backgrounds for the Baha ' i faith . Baha ' is believe racism is the greatest challenge facing Americans today . The faith demands that followers work toward the abolition of prejudice and encourages intermarriage to overcome racial barriers . In 1969 , Gloria Haithman-Ali , now a USC administrator , realized that Baha ' i principles of unity and racial equality gave a spiritual name to her personal beliefs . As a young black_woman in Greensboro , N.C. , she had protested and demonstrated against discrimination during the civil_rights movement . Later , as a mother in New York , she recalls seeking a home for her family and being shut_out of trailer_parks and neighborhoods because of her color . One day , she was invited to a Baha ' i retreat in Teaneck , N.J. &quot; At one point I looked_around ( the multicultural group ) and said ' These are the true Christians , ' and at that point , in my heart , I knew I was Baha ' i , &quot; recalled Haithman-Ali , who is vice chair of the Los Angeles Baha ' i Spiritual Assembly . After the riots , a group of Baha ' is formed the Institute for the Healing of Racism , and began offering nine-week courses in how to cure what the faith considers a moral and social_disease . &quot; There has really been a demand for ( the classes ) , &quot; said Haithman-Ali one of the institute ' s founders . &quot; At the end ( of the session ) , hopefully people realize it ' s really the beginning. &quot; What may distinguish the Baha ' i faith most from other religions is the belief that all religions are part of one religion and that each faith ' s prophet has provided humanity with updates from God . Baha ' u ' llah ( 1817-1892 ) is considered the most recent in a line of holy messengers sent by God to guide men on earth . Another messenger is expected in 1 # 000 years , according to Baha ' i teachings . &quot; The Baha ' i have a real perspective on the unique contributions of all_the different religions , &quot; Eck said . &quot; Other religions don ' t do that , especially the Western , monotheistic religions. &quot; In Islamic Iran , where orthodox Muslims believe Mohammed to be the last prophet , Baha ' is have been tortured and killed for their beliefs . Since the 1979 Islamic revolution , more_than 200 Baha ' is have been executed and Baha ' i scholars report that slayings occurred as recently as last year . An increasing number of Los Angeles Baha ' is are Iranian immigrants . The fact that the Baha ' i encourage openness and investigation of other religions appealed_to Lourdes Sanaei , 37 . Sanaei spent 14 years in Catholic_school and always wondered why , as a young_girl , her church taught that sinners -- everyone , including even children who were not baptized -- would be doomed to eternal hell . &quot; I had all these questions and the priests would say ' Oh , don ' t ask that . Have faith , ' &quot; recalled the mother of three . &quot; Then I started to read the Baha ' i writings and the answers I ' d looked_for were there . This is a religion that is very clear and there are no dogmas . It ' s like there were veils before my eyes and they fell away. &quot; Angelica Huerta remembers how her Catholic family became alienated from the church after the changes of Vatican II . Now 44 , she spent her early 20s investigating other religions and even traveled_to Jerusalem in search of answers . Then she discovered the Baha ' i community in Los Angeles . &quot; They were wonderful , warm people who had embraced all_the messengers of God and that made a lot of sense to me , &quot; Huerta said . One evening , she gathered her family and friends to announce her decision to convert . Family members thought she had been sucked into a fraud and found it hard to accept such a foreign-sounding religion , she said . &quot; They were very upset , let me tell you , &quot; she said . &quot; It was a scary situation. &quot; But within a year , her parents and five brothers and sisters had also converted . &quot; When people understand that it ' s not some irrational cult and it is the fulfillment of religious promise , it ' s not difficult to accept , &quot; said James Nelson , once a junior minister in the Presbyterian_Church who now chairs the National Spiritual Assembly . &quot; What ' s difficult for most people is to let_go_of the emotional attachment to traditional religion. &quot; Other key teachings of Baha ' u ' llah envision the elimination of economic injustice , a universal language and a world government to unite nations . Equality between men and women is also paramount . If a family can only afford to educate one child , it should send a girl to school , said Baha ' u ' llah , because mothers are the first teachers of the human_race . Despite idealistic principles , the faith does have contradictions . Mehdi Bozorgmehr , a UCLA sociologist , co-authored a study of Los Angeles Iranians in the 1980s and discovered that Iranian Baha ' is mingled more among their own kind than their faith mandates . &quot; Be careful how you write that , &quot; Bozorgmehr warned , the Baha ' i &quot; won ' t like it. &quot; In addition , Baha ' i scripture stresses the equality and importance of women in the faith , but also prohibits them from serving in the highest Baha ' i office , as members of the Universal House of Justice . Baha ' i writings explain this by saying only that the reason for it will someday be clear . &quot; It ' s perplexing , &quot; admitted James Nelson . &quot; But there are lots of things in life that are perplexing that we don ' t have answers to . It frustrates other activities that are in_progress to stop and worry about that one thing . . . . I don ' t understand it now , but I think I will. &quot; Baha ' is are not allowed to participate in partisan politics , criticize their governments or marry without the consent of their parents , if living . Divorce is allowed but discouraged . They are obligated to pray each day , consider their work as worship and fast for 19 designated days each March . They have no regular services , such_as Catholic Sunday Mass , although members can attend &quot; devotionals , &quot; or informal prayer_meetings in most communities . Perhaps the most important Baha ' i gathering is known_as the area feast , held every 19 days at the end of each Baha ' i month . ( The Baha ' i calendar is based on 19 months of 19 days each . The number 19 is significant among Baha ' is because in 19th Century Persia , the numerical Abjad system gave each letter a standard value , and the Arabic word for unity , Vahid , has a value of 19. ) The Nineteen Day feast is a community gathering that combines prayer , administration and socializing . It is the only Baha ' i activity that is closed to outsiders . The faith has no clergy and little ritual and is governed by a nine-member Local Spiritual Assembly elected by residents of that city . Campaigning and nominations for positions on the assembly are forbidden . Local members elect the National Spiritual Assembly , which in turn helps elect representatives to the Universal House of Justice , the nine-member international body based in Haifa , Israel , whose decisions on spiritual matters are considered to be infallible and guided by God . Fiona Missaghian , a 22-year-old German-born USC master ' s student , remembers being harassed for her beliefs by other children in her hometown near Cologne , Germany . &quot; As a child , sometimes it was difficult because you ' re different , &quot; said Missaghian , who , in jeans and a backpack looked very much like every_other student on campus . &quot; I remember in sixth grade a kid called me ' Miss World Peace , ' but eventually they all began to realize ( unity is ) something we have to achieve. &quot; some of which have drawn more_than 200 people . &quot; At first we went_to firesides ( in the early 1950s ) to see if ( the Baha ' i religion ) was just one of those ' California things , ' &quot; admitted Dorothy Nelson , an elected member of the Baha ' i National Spiritual Assembly who was raised an Episcopalian .
