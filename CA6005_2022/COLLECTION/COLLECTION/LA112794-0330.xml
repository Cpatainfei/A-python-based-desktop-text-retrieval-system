   <HEADLINE> SCHOOL STANDS_OUT FOR BETTER , FOR WORSE ; EDUCATION : FULLERTON ' S SUNNY HILLS HIGH IS FULL OF ACHIEVERS , BUT A_FEW OF ITS GRADS HAVE MADE GRISLY HEADLINES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sunny Hills High is a public_school with a zero percent dropout rate and no graffiti on the walls , a place where students brag about pulling all-nighters and compete in honors classes for the highest A-plus . Jackson Browne went there . So did All-Star major_league catcher Gary Carter . Its reputation stretches across the Pacific_Ocean , luring Korean immigrants in search of the best in American education , and to the elite Eastern colleges where graduates flock . But lately the sparkling test scores at the suburban campus have been overshadowed by a string of grisly headlines : A would-be valedictorian of the Class of 1993 convicted in the brutal slaying of an honor student . A 1990 grad accused this month of murdering his parents and brother . The 1988 Teacher of the Year charged with killing her lover , and another longtime teacher pleading guilty to molesting students . The former postal worker who terrorized the county with a spring , 1993 , shooting rampage is a Sunny Hills alum too . &quot; Our school ' s awesome , &quot; said junior Susu Irie , laughing as he stood_in the school courtyard one afternoon . &quot; We have everything from murderers to geniuses here. &quot; &quot; Now that ' s diversity , &quot; chimed_in senior Jason Fairchild . At Sunny Hills -- where scores of students sit with books open , pencils poised and calculators running during lunch -- the peer pressure is not to do drugs or join gangs . It ' s to earn straight A ' s , rack_up extracurriculars and break 1350 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test in the never-ending struggle to get_into the best colleges . Three-quarters of the graduates go straight to four-year universities . Of 399 seniors last year , 54 finished with a grade point average above 4.0 ; there were six valedictorians because that ' s how many students finished four years with nothing but A ' s in this school that is part of the Fullerton Union High_School District . &quot; A lot of times , popularity is based on looks and stuff . Here , it ' s how much you ' re involved and your academics , &quot; said sophomore Brian Kim . &quot; When everybody is overachieving and going_for it , it kind of brings other people along . It ' s like a race -- if everyone ' s going fast , you go fast. &quot; Senior Esther Yoon added : &quot; If I could sum_up Sunny Hills in one word , it ' s ' hyper-competitive. ' &quot; But students , parents and faculty say the competition is positive , pushing kids to their fullest potential . Fueling the emphasis on academics is the growing number of Asian families devoted to top-notch education who seek_out the campus . Founded in 1959 , Sunny Hills was for decades a predominantly white school nestled in a neighborhood of upper-middle class , college-educated professionals . Now many of the homes , which range_in price from $ 300 # 000 to $ 1 million , are bought mostly by Asian families attracted by the high_school ' s record . Koo Oh , a Fullerton dentist who heads the Korean American Assn . of Orange County , said many Koreans consider Sunny Hills &quot; the best high_school in California. &quot; Some families even remain in Asia but send their children to live_in Fullerton and attend Sunny Hills . Others from throughout Southern California borrow addresses from people who live_in the school ' s attendance area to make their children eligible . In 1985 , the student body was 71.8 % white and 17.9 % Asian . Now it is 48.4 % Asian and 39.4 % white . Four years ago , there were no &quot; limited English proficiency &quot; students -- now there are 163 . The shift will likely continue : Asians are 45 % of the Class of 1995 , 51 % of the Class of 1998 . &quot; They have a mini-United Nations up here , &quot; said assistant principal Diane Hockersmith . &quot; But when you get that many different ethnicities in a place , it takes a little to keep everybody happy and calmed down. &quot; Many students said they have individual friends of varied races , but that cliques form along color_lines . At break , lunch and after school , Koreans dominate the center of the quad , whites mingle on the fringes of the leafy courtyard and Latinos -- 8.5 % of the student body -- gather elsewhere on campus . Koreans and whites park in different rows in the student lots . There is a Korean Family Support Group separate from the white-dominated Parent-Teacher-Student Assn . In a school newspaper_column last year , editor Jhoanna Infante complained that even at International Day , an event lauded for promoting cultural awareness , booths were segregated by race and adult volunteers gave free food to students of the same ethnicity . &quot; The Asians don ' t like the whites because they ' re all sports and the whites don ' t like the Asians because they ' re all academics and money , &quot; said senior Brian Ashton , who has a reputation on campus for mixing easily among Asian and white cliques . There also are divisions among Koreans , who make_up 27 % of the students and 57 % of the Asians . Acculturated Korean-Americans tease &quot; FOBs &quot; -- students who are &quot; fresh off the boat &quot; -- and disdain the &quot; gangsters &quot; -- Koreans who wear baggy pants , carry beepers and boast about their connections to crime . &quot; Within Koreans , there ' s discrimination too , &quot; said sophomore Stephen Sohn , who was born in the United States a_few years after his parents came here from Korea . &quot; If you don ' t know your language , they make_fun of you . Some people speak Korean to each other when they don ' t want other people to understand. &quot; The changing demographics have coincided with Sunny Hills ' growing reputation for achievement . Long known within Orange County as an academic powerhouse , the school now stacks_up among the best in the state and nation , according to test scores . This year ' s senior_class includes a student who earned a perfect score on the American College Achievement Test -- the first in the school ' s history . Last year , there was a perfect SAT score -- also a Sunny Hills first . And there currently are 27 National Merit Scholarship semi-finalists on campus , the most ever and third in California behind only the elite private Harvard-Westlake school and Peninsula High_School in Palos Verdes . Some students and staff acknowledged that skyrocketing standards of parents drive the achievement culture . &quot; When I was in high_school my parents didn ' t even know what the SAT was , &quot; said English_teacher Kimberley Stein , the school newspaper adviser . &quot; There are Korean parents here who don ' t even speak English but know the cutoff ( SAT score needed ) to get_into Stanford. &quot; Sohn said his parents expect perfection . &quot; Anything below an A is failure . I hate that , so I try to avoid that by getting_the_best grades I can. &quot; Faculty and administrators attribute much of the achievement to the school ' s International Baccalaureate program , a rigorous set of advanced classes that provide a global , interdisciplinary education . More_than a quarter of Sunny Hills students take IB classes , and there are 55 candidates this year for a special IB diploma , ranking the school ' s IB program third in the United States ( out of 150 schools ) . About 100 students each year apply from outside the Fullerton district to attend Sunny Hills , most attracted by the IB program . The level below honors , &quot; college prep , &quot; is viewed_as average on campus , though the curriculum is more advanced than that of many public high_schools . Students involved in IB often are overloaded with extracurricular_activities . Both school counselors said their biggest struggle during registration each semester is talking campus leaders out of taking too many honors classes . The most popular students on campus also are the ones with the overstuffed schedules . &quot; Since you go_to Sunny Hills , you have to get good grades , you have to be involved , &quot; sophomore Brianne Gates said as she sat in the courtyard in her black-and-gold cheerleader ' s uniform . &quot; You have to be the perfect student. &quot; Junior Shilpa Gupta said classmates &quot; look the other way &quot; when they hear she is not in honors math . Jimmy McGuire , a senior , recounted a friend saying , &quot; Oh , I ' d thought you were smart &quot; upon learning that McGuire had 13 Bs over six semesters . &quot; People have a 4.0 and they feel inferior , &quot; McGuire quipped . &quot; I have a 4.3 , and it ' s like , ' What am I doing wrong ? ' &quot; The campus atmosphere is more like a prep_school or private college than a public high_school . Honors students try to one-up each other on how much work they have or how little sleep they ' ve gotten and brag about addictions to No Doz and Vivarin . Guidance counselors Cynthia Martini and Don Joynt said they spend 80 % to 90 % of their time working with students on college admissions and even assemble applications to private colleges for the students ( last year they did 500 applications for 200 students ) . Each summer , history teacher Patrick Lampman takes 30 youngsters on a tour of Ivy League and other East Coast schools . Many students take expensive classes or have private tutors to prepare them for the SAT , and some hire outside college consultants . It works : Last year , eight were accepted to Ivy League schools , eight more to Stanford . Seventy-eight got_into UC Irvine , 65 into UCLA and 48 into UC Berkeley . &quot; People are planning for college from their freshman year , &quot; McGuire said . &quot; They ' re working on their perfect transcript. &quot; &quot; No , &quot; jumped in senior Jane Kim , &quot; They start earlier than that. &quot; But some complain that too_much attention is paid to the top achievers , leaving mid-level students behind . Senior Hiromi Hiraoka said her college prep English_class was once told there was no money for a field trip bus because it was reserved for IB classes . Others said it is difficult for students who are not applying to the most competitive colleges to get an appointment with a guidance counselor . &quot; What ' s average at Sunny Hills is kind of scary , &quot; said Martini , the counselor . &quot; If I had a child here , that would be a concern for me , because what ' s average here is not average anywhere else. &quot; Still , teachers and administrators said the academic focus and extremely high motivation of the students makes Sunny Hills an ideal place to work . For Lampman , who came_to the school in 1988 after 15 years of teaching elsewhere , &quot; it ' s been an intellectual Renaissance. &quot; In addition to the much acclaimed IB program , Sunny Hills is the only high_school in California to offer five levels of Korean . Starting this spring , it will become the first high_school in the state to offer a double-immersion bilingual program in Korean and English . Sunny Hills also takes an innovative approach with its limited-English speaking students , hurrying them into college-preparatory classes rather than giving them lower-level academics . What ' s more , Sunny Hills is one of only nine high_schools in Orange County with an agriculture program , where students raise chickens , turkeys , pigs , sheep and steers on a seven-acre farm and study agribusiness , floriculture and veterinary science . Teachers at all levels said they have more time for instruction because discipline is a virtual non-issue at the school . Students rarely skip class , giving Sunny Hills an average daily attendance rate of 99.6 % . ( Those who miss a day can make_it up at Saturday school. ) Last year , there were only three students found to have drugs on campus , and two caught with knives ( one was fake ) . Hockersmith , the assistant principal , said she sees about one fight each month . &quot; I knew it was different when I came for my interview and saw all these roses , &quot; French_teacher Lynn Johnson said of the flourishing red , pink , white and yellow flowers that decorate the immaculate campus . &quot; The school I was at before , the kids would not have allowed a rose to bloom -- they would have stampeded anything living. &quot; The challenge teachers at Sunny Hills face is staying ahead of students who read books in_advance and do homework on_time , often turning_in projects more elaborate than what was assigned . &quot; They look way beyond what ' s due on Monday , &quot; said Gwen Almeida , who teaches both honors and college prep English . &quot; It ' s not just , ' What am I going_to get_on this assignment ? ' They have a plan that ' s beyond high school. &quot; Despite its increasing success , the past few years have been rough for Sunny Hills , with the rash of criminal incidents connected to the campus causing alarm . Long derided as &quot; Snobby Hills &quot; because of its affluent student body , the school has recently earned a second taunting nickname from cross-town rivals : &quot; Scummy Thrills. &quot; At least two students have attempted suicide this fall , overdosing on pills , administrators said . Some wonder whether the competitive atmosphere compounded other problems in leading to the string of arrests in recent years . But many students , staff and parents insist the problems are pure coincidence and unrelated to the school . &quot; There ' s no connection between the school and these crazy incidents , &quot; said George Giokaris , Sunny Hills principal from 1989 to 1993 . &quot; There would have been no way to have ever predicted that these kinds of things would happen. &quot; Still , senior Sommer Jensen said she is embarrassed to tell people where she goes_to school because they think it ' s &quot; Murder Inc. &quot; &quot; People in my class are just waiting for something bad to happen this year , &quot; senior Grace Fujimoto said quietly . &quot; Because in the Class of 1995 , something bad has happened every year. &quot; Since the grisly headlines began in January , 1993 , with the arrest of five students for the well-rehearsed slaying of a Foothill High honors student , there has been a complete administrative turnover at the school , bringing Loring Davies into the principal ' s chair . A balding , bearded man who looks older than his 34 years , Davies keeps his office door open and spends hours each day roaming the campus , walkie-talkie in_hand . &quot; The students here have an incredible amount of self-confidence , &quot; Davies said . &quot; To take these students ( who ) are already bright and have excelled beyond their years and help them continue to grow can be very difficult . . . . Some people say , ' Gosh , you ' re putting too_much pressure on students. ' I don ' t know that you can have it both ways all_the time. &quot; Massy Tadjedin is not exactly a typical Sunny Hills student -- she ' s more like the ideal . Massy , president of the student body , is in class from 6:45 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. every day . She volunteers at the Red_Cross , works_at Laura Ashley on Sunday afternoons , and was_on the homecoming court . She got 1450 on her SAT and applied early to Harvard . Just shy of 18 , Massy said she gets only a_couple_of hours of sleep a night ( her mother said it ' s more like four ) and is addicted to caffeine -- &quot; coffee , Coke , chocolate , anything. &quot; She doesn ' t watch TV . She doesn ' t have time . &quot; I never felt_like I was in high_school . I felt_like I went straight from junior_high to college , &quot; Massy said as she lugged her loaded backpack , a thick biology text in_hand for constant cramming . &quot; There was a time when I was questioning whether I was enjoying my youth , &quot; she reflected . &quot; that ' s a huge fear I have . Am I going_to look_back on this and say I didn ' t have any fun in high_school ? &quot; Decade of Change The ethnicity of the Sunny Hills High_School student body has undergone a massive shift during the past decade . Many Korean immigrants have moved to the affluent Fullerton neighborhood where the school is located , largely because its excellent academic reputation extends across the Pacific .
