   <HEADLINE> CORPORATE DOWNSIZING CAN BE DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD ; RESTRUCTURING : IT DOESN ' T ALWAYS IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY -- AND IT MIGHT END UP COSTING MONEY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Millions of employee layoffs have helped corporate America cut expenses . But evidence is growing that the strategy known as downsizing produces destructive side_effects that range from demoralized workers to job burnout . Moreover , researchers and strategists say the attempt to strengthen profits and productivity through cutting layers of workers may actually have cost many companies billions of dollars . Nor is it clear that downsizing has made businesses as productive as initially hoped . &quot; Much of the downsizing of the last 10 years has been an enormous waste_of_time and energy , and in many cases has been spectacularly unsuccessful , &quot; said Michael Hammer , a consultant specializing in re-engineering efforts . &quot; I ' m seeing many companies go that route and then regret it. &quot; To be sure , there is a powerful argument for cutting unnecessary workers in an age when technology can do the work of several people . If American industry is to remain competitive on costs , work_force cutbacks are still seen as an obvious way to achieve the goal . Indeed , on Wall_Street , a main barometer of corporate performance , investors usually act favorably to word of cost-cutting . Stock prices often jump when companies terminate workers . Others , however , charge that re-engineering has become a fad , with companies embracing the strategy without considering the consequences . Hammer estimates that 70 % of the corporate cost-cutting he has observed has not achieved hoped-for results . And a survey of top_executives by the consulting_firm Arthur D . Little shows about two-thirds are not satisfied . In hindsight , many said they should have planned more carefully . Part of the problem , the study found , was a conflict between the executives ' objectives , motivations and expectations . Still , Peter Scott-Morgan , associate director at Little and author of the book &quot; The Unwritten Rules of the Game , &quot; said not surprisingly , chief_executives have been reluctant to address their failures . &quot; There has been a conspiracy_of_silence , &quot; Scott-Morgan said . &quot; But many feel the changes have been too slow or too patchy . &quot; The tragedy is that so many people are suffering and the reasons for which they have had to suffer not being achieved , &quot; he said . Beyond the obvious emotional and financial cost to employees is the less-publicized and not insignificant cost to companies themselves . American corporations are spending between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion a year on re-engineering , Scott-Morgan estimates . Many of America ' s largest companies have been shrinking since the mid-1980s and the economic recovery has not slowed the pace . For example , after eliminating about 100 # 000 jobs since 1984 , AT &amp; T is still dropping 1 # 000 a month , spokesman Burke Stinson said . From 1983 to 1993 , Fortune 500 companies eliminated 4.7 million people from their payrolls , or one-quarter of their work_force , said David Birch , president of Cognetics , a Cambridge , Mass. , business research firm . Still , a study for the Census_Bureau ' s Center for Economic Study questions whether job cuts and improved productivity -- a key rationale for many restructurings -- necessarily go hand-in-hand . &quot; In many ways the message is that we need to be careful when we look_at trends in the economy and then apply them to all industries , &quot; said University of Maryland economics professor John Haltiwanger , one of the study ' s authors . An analysis of productivity at 140 # 000 factories during the 1980s found that while 55 % of gains came where the work_force fell , the other 45 % came at plants with growing employment . David Noer , author of &quot; Healing the Wounds : Overcoming the Trauma of Layoffs and Revitalizing Downsized Operations , &quot; said the anger and fear among employees who survive layoffs limit their risk-taking -- and hurt productivity . Part of the problem , Hammer and other strategists say , is that in their quest_for efficiency , many companies have ignored the human side of the drama , that restructuring efforts are changing how employees view their work lives . Previously , loyalty was a given : If you worked hard , you attained . An employee gave the company loyalty and received a steady job , service pins and a secure retirement . &quot; The new reality is that people come_to the office understanding . . . that to rely_on the paternalism of the company is a mistake , &quot; Stinson said . Although companies have found loyalty is hard to engender amid massive layoffs , they are also beginning to recognize that without significant commitment from workers the changes won ' t be successful . Executives also have not considered how restructuring affects the workload of remaining employees . &quot; All many companies are doing is eliminating people , throwing them over the side of the boat , and they aren ' t eliminating work , &quot; Hammer said . &quot; Companies then have to work the remaining people harder and they become stressed and unhappy. &quot;</TEXT>
