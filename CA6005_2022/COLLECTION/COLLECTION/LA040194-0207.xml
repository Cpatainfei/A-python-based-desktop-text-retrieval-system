   <HEADLINE> MAJOR ART ROBBERY CASE GETS MORE ABSTRACT ; SUIT : BROTHER CHALLENGES SISTER ' S OWNERSHIP OF THE WORKS , WHICH WERE RECOVERED LAST YEAR AFTER A THEFT FROM A NORTHRIDGE STORAGE UNIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the biggest art robberies in Los Angeles history seemed to have ended happily in August when it was announced the FBI and police had recovered $ 9 million worth of modern art stolen from a Northridge rental storage unit . But now , Eva Smith Weisager , the 86-year-old woman who told police she had inherited the artworks from her socialite sister , is being accused of stealing them herself back in the late 1970s , a charge a spokesman for her denied . Weisager ' s brother , Daniel Greenway , filed suit in Los Angeles Superior_Court Wednesday contending that Weisager took the paintings and drawings -- including a possible Picasso -- from the home of their sister , Rosita Winston , after Winston was debilitated by a stroke . Greenway further contends that when Winston -- who was the widow of highly successful real_estate developer Norman Winston -- died in 1979 , he should have shared_in the artworks under the terms of her will . The nine paintings and drawings include &quot; The Party , &quot; a painting attributed to Pablo Picasso , although leading experts on the artist said they had no knowledge of the work . If authenticated , the signed painting would be worth about $ 5 million . Other paintings and drawings in the group were by such well-known artists as Edgar Degas , Marc Chagall , Amedeo Modigliani and Eugene Delacroix . Greenway said in his suit that he is entitled to at least $ 1 million -- one-ninth the value of the paintings , plus punitive damages and costs . He is a resident of Mexico and could not be reached for comment . His lawyer , based in Claremont , did not return telephone_calls . Weisager ' s son-in-law , Ken Tate , said Weisager was too upset to comment on the_matter . Tate also would not comment in detail on the suit , other_than to call it groundless . &quot; There is not one thing in there that is true , &quot; Tate said , speaking from his office in Reseda . &quot; The truth will come_out and this will all just go away. &quot; The artworks were recovered in an early morning raid Aug . 10 at the homes of Chatsworth carpenter Peter MacKenzie and Granada Hills electrician Alan McArthur . Several of the works , police said , were found hidden in the wall of MacKenzie ' s bedroom . The two men and restaurant owner Vasilios Mirmaras , who was accused of trying to sell the paintings , are scheduled to go_on trial this month . Weisager reported the artworks missing Feb . 5 , 1992 , from the public storage unit where she had kept them for 13 years . She was living_in a modest Van Nuys apartment and had no insurance on the works , she told police . An insurance_policy , in addition to protecting her against loss , would probably have bolstered her claim to ownership . Art insurers normally require proof that a valuable work is owned by the person or institution taking_out the policy . Tate would not comment on whether the paintings were now insured , or even if Weisager still had them in her possession . Detective Bill Martin , who heads the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s art theft division , said he had no reason at the time of the investigation to doubt Weisager owned the works . &quot; If anything , it was just the opposite , &quot; Martin said Wednesday . &quot; This was an elderly woman who was very nice , very cooperative , who had never been in_trouble with the law . &quot; She gave us materials to show that the paintings had been in her family for many years. &quot; The Winstons were_well known in New York art circles for their collection . A photograph of Rosita Winston that appeared in_Vogue magazine in the mid-1950s shows &quot; The Party &quot; hanging_on the wall of their apartment . Greenway contends in the suit that Weisager bought a station_wagon in 1978 &quot; for the specific purpose of looting Rosita Winston ' s plush condominium of valuable works of art. &quot; He further states that Weisager , who is the only defendant in the suit , was assisted in taking the art by her daughter and a servant . Greenway further states in the suit that he never knew what had happened to the paintings until he read a Times story in August about their recovery . Tate said that Weisager and Greenway had stayed in contact over the years and had seen each other as recently as about two weeks ago . He said he did not know if they ever discussed the artworks.ART COLLEC</TEXT>
