   <TEXT> Scandinavian researchers have produced the first long-term evidence that lowering cholesterol levels with drugs can substantially increase survival in patients who have already had a heart_attack or who have heart_disease . The five-year study of nearly 4 # 500 patients between the ages of 35 and 70 showed that those who took the drug simvastatin were 43 % less likely to die of heart_disease , 34 % less likely to suffer a nonfatal heart_attack or other &quot; coronary event &quot; and 37 % less likely to require a coronary_artery bypass or other invasive procedures , the researchers will report today at a meeting of the American Heart Assn . in Dallas . Equally important , those who successfully lowered their cholesterol were no more likely to die of other causes , including cancer , suicide and violence , as had been suggested by some earlier studies . The results were so dramatic that the study was ended prematurely and the drug offered to all those receiving a placebo . The findings appear to confirm the role of cholesterol as a major risk factor_in heart_disease . More_than 85 % of the 12 million Americans with heart_disease have high cholesterol levels , according to the National Institutes of Health , and as_many as 6 million could potentially benefit from use of the drug . Heart_disease is the leading cause of death in the United States , killing more_than 923 # 000 people each year . &quot; This study is unique because it is the first to conclusively demonstrate improved survival -- people living longer , &quot; said Dr. Terje R . Pedersen of Aker University Hospital in Oslo , a co-leader of the study . &quot; Over the next five years , &quot; said his colleague , Dr. John Kjekahus of the University of Oslo , &quot; we expect these findings to have a tremendous impact on standard treatment for heart_attack and angina patients. &quot; In terms of reducing risk , he said , &quot; Taking simvastatin is just as important as quitting smoking. &quot; &quot; This is a landmark study , &quot; said Dr. Roger Illingworth of the Oregon Health Sciences University , one of the few outside researchers familiar_with the results . &quot; If you take a population with heart_disease and moderate elevations of cholesterol and give them this drug , the patients live longer and you don ' t increase the risk of other side_effects . That is a very important finding . . . . And the longer you give the drug , the greater the benefit. &quot; The study provides a strong message for the public and physicians , said Dr. James Cleeman , coordinator of the National Cholesterol Education Project at the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute . High cholesterol levels in heart_disease patients , he said , should be treated aggressively with diet therapy and , if that fails , with drugs . Whether with diet or drugs , he added , lowering cholesterol can save lives . &quot; The payoff seems quite clear. &quot; Simvastatin , manufactured by Merck &amp; Co. , is one of a family of chemically similar cholesterol-lowering drugs that also includes lovastatin and pravastatin . Lovastatin , the best known , is isolated from a fungus and blocks the action of an enzyme that is crucial to the synthesis of cholesterol in the body . Simvastatin is a chemically modified variant of lovastatin that binds to the enzyme more tightly , thereby blocking its function more effectively . Simvastatin has been available in Europe since 1988 and in the United States since 1991 . Most previous studies have been performed with lovastatin , which lowers cholesterol levels by about 10 % , according to the National Institutes of Health . &quot; We ' ve had small studies before that have shown that lowering cholesterol produces significant benefits . . . but the data wasn ' t conclusive and it didn ' t show a significant trend toward reduced mortality , &quot; Cleeman said . The new , larger study found that simvastatin reduced cholesterol 25 % and lowered low-density_lipoprotein ( LDL ) , the so-called bad cholesterol , by 35 % . &quot; This is the most effective cholesterol-lowering agent we know of , &quot; Pedersen said . The researchers recruited 7 # 027 patients who had had a heart_attack or unstable angina and who had cholesterol levels in the range 212 to 309 milligrams per deciliter of blood . All patients were given dietary advice and sent home for two months to see if they could reduce those levels . Those who could not and were medically approved were enrolled in the study . Half the 4 # 444 participants received dietary intervention and simvastatin . The other half received dietary intervention and a placebo . The participants were monitored for an average of 5.4 years , and the researchers will continue to monitor them in the future . In the study , 256 patients in the placebo group died , compared to 182 in the drug group , a 29 % reduction . In the placebo group , 189 died of coronary causes , compared to 111 in the drug group . Also in the placebo category , 622 suffered either fatal or major , nonfatal heart_attacks , compared to 431 in the simvastatin group . Those in the drug group were also 37 % less likely to require a coronary_artery bypass or angioplasty , in which a balloon-tipped catheter is used to open blood_vessels feeding the heart . The patients receiving simvastatin had &quot; minimal adverse events , &quot; Pedersen said . The main side_effect of the drug is a reversible malfunction of the liver . The number of patients who dropped_out of the study because of adverse effects was 129 in the placebo group and 126 in the drug group . There were no significant differences in the numbers of cases of suicide , cancer or deaths due_to violence , in contrast to some controversial previous studies that found an increased incidence of such deaths among people who lowered their cholesterol . The study , Kjekahus said , demonstrates &quot; beyond a doubt that physicians can use a well-tolerated medicine to influence the course of coronary heart_disease and help people live longer. &quot; Results of the study are scheduled to be published Saturday in the international medical journal Lancet . The study was funded by Merck . More heart information * For more information on cholesterol and heart_disease , call TimesLine at 808-8463 and select category * 5154 .
