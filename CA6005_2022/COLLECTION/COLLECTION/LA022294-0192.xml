   <HEADLINE> TRASH LANDING ; HISTORY : SMITHSONIAN CLAIMS SHUTTLE ENGINE MOCK-UPS ARE AT MUSEUM , BUT ROCKWELL SAYS THEY WERE UNCEREMONIOUSLY DUMPED IN A LANDFILL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Depending_on whom you believe , an important part of this country ' s space exploration history is either in the Smithsonian Institution or decaying in the hot sun in a Palmdale landfill . Space shuttle builder Rockwell International says that more_than a decade ago it sent to the dump a set of shuttle engine mock-ups that were used as part of the test program for the Enterprise -- the first orbiter ever built . But what Rockwell said it disposed_of at the dump are the same exact things the National Air and Space Museum in Washington believes it has in its collection . The museum says the shuttle engine nozzles are attached_to the back of the Enterprise , a non-flying orbiter used for testing in the late 1970s that was donated by NASA to the museum in 1985 . The mock-ups were used in approach and landing tests that included putting Enterprise atop a modified 747 and releasing it 26 # 000 feet above the expansive dry lake_beds at Edwards Air_Force Base to see if it could , in fact , glide to an unpowered landing . Rockwell officials said just one set of the mock-ups was built and they are the ones at the dump . &quot; If the real approach and landing nozzles are out there in California , then what do we have ? &quot; asked Valerie Neal , a curator for the museum ' s department of space history . Fred Valentino , who has been general_manager of the Palmdale dump for nearly two decades , said the three shuttle engine nozzles , which were designed to simulate the size , shape and weight of the real space shuttle main engines , arrived_at the landfill several years ago during the town ' s annual cleanup week . Rockwell , which builds the space shuttles at its facility at Air_Force Plant 42 in Palmdale , no longer had a use for the nozzles and so , with the blessing of the government , disposed_of them . &quot; Rather than storing them , because they have no functional value or purpose down the line , Rockwell and NASA property managers decided to dispose_of them , &quot; said Alan Buis , a spokesman for Rockwell Space Systems Division . &quot; that ' s how they ended_up where they currently are. &quot; But museum curator Neal is confident Rockwell must be mistaken about the mock-ups it sent to the dump . &quot; I talked to a couple people who were here when Enterprise was delivered , &quot; she said . &quot; We were never notified that anything on Enterprise was not part of the test configuration. &quot; But if Rockwell is right , historians and museum curators fear that a piece of history is weathering in the desert sun , in a dump , no less . &quot; That is disturbing , &quot; said Derek Elliott , who was curator of the Air and Space Museum ' s manned space collection at the time Enterprise arrived . Elliott is now a history professor at Tennessee State University in Nashville . Elliott said that when Enterprise was given to the museum , no one thought to ask if the nozzles were the ones used in the tests at Edwards Air_Force Base . It was just assumed they were . Through an agreement between NASA and the Smithsonian , NASA is supposed to offer anything considered a potential artifact to the museum before discarding it . Elliott said it is possible that when the nozzles were dumped , the process broke_down or NASA didn ' t realize their historical value . &quot; Even if we didn ' t acquire them , I can almost guarantee some_other space history museum or center would be interested in something like that , &quot; Elliott said . &quot; It ' s part of this nation ' s history , the history of the space shuttle. &quot; But , Elliott said , items that historians and curators believe significant are not always judged as such by others . James Hartsfield , NASA shuttle program spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in Texas , said , &quot; It ' s not unique that you found engine mock-ups in a dump in California. &quot; He said various junked mock-ups from the Apollo_program can be found at landfills near the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . Meanwhile , Palmdale landfill manager Valentino isn ' t all that eager to give_up what he sees as his piece of space history . Although he ' s never been sure exactly what they are , he has kept the mock-ups from being buried under tons of grass clippings , tin_cans and used tires . They sit near an old , discarded dinghy and appear to be used as a resting place and toilet facility for the many dump-scavenging birds that frequent the landfill . It may_not be the Smithsonian , but eventually , Valentino says he ' s going_to put the three engine nozzles on display and show them during tours .</TEXT>
