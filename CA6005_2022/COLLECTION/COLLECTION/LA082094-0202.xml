   <HEADLINE> RUNNING / JOHN ORTEGA ; HAMSTRUNG BY INJURY , BECK PASSES ON EUROPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A promising season has turned_into a summer of discontent for Marty Beck of Nike International L.A. The former standout at Glendale College and UCLA placed fifth in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles in the USA Track &amp; Field championships in June after lowering his personal best to 49.53 seconds in a heat , but he has not raced since because of a strained left hamstring . Beck suffered the injury on July 9 , the day before he was to race in the U.S. Olympic Festival . It forced him to cancel what would have been his first tour on the European track circuit . Beck withdrew from such events as The World Games in Helsinki , Finland , and the Bislett Games in Oslo . While the strained hamstring has been &quot; very frustrating &quot; to Beck because it is his first serious injury , the setback also has been hard on his bank_account . Beck , 24 , would have received appearance money in Europe and he has performance incentives in his contract with Nike . As Beck puts it , the injury &quot; has taken food out of my ' fridge. &quot; * Trivia question : Who is the only male athlete to win six individual titles in the state high_school championships ? Hint : He is the last man to win the shotput and discus in the Olympic Games . * Turning the tables : Regina Jacobs of the Mizuno Track Club has a reputation for performing below par against top international competition , but the Argyll Academy -- now Campbell Hall High -- graduate scored a big victory in the 1 # 500 in last week ' s USA-Pan Africa meet at Duke University . Jacobs , 30 , had failed to qualify for the finals of the last two Olympics as well as the 1987 and ' 91 World Championships . But in the Pan Africa meet , she ran 4 minutes 10.24 seconds to edge Algeria ' s Olympic champion , Hassiba Boulmerka ( 4:10.63 ) . Boulmerka also won the 1991 World title . * Comeback trail : After winning four state titles in cross-country and track at Agoura High , Bryan Dameworth was one of the nation ' s most highly recruited distance runners in 1990 . But as he prepares_for his fifth -- and final -- year at Wisconsin , he is not thinking_about NCAA championships or All-American finishes . He simply would like to complete the fall season without injury . Dameworth posted personal bests of 4:09.32 in the mile and 8:53.26 in the 3 # 200 meters during his senior season at Agoura but has been plagued by physical maladies since . The most recent injury -- a strained lower back -- occurred in March and prevented Dameworth from competing during the outdoor track season . During the indoor season , he had run personal bests of 8:14 in the 3 # 000 and 14:13 in the 5 # 000 . &quot; After doing_well indoors , I was looking_forward to the outdoor season , but it never happened , &quot; he said . &quot; I was working_out one day and my back felt fine at the start of the run , but it was really hurting at the end. &quot; Despite the injuries , Dameworth remains optimistic about his future . &quot; I ' m going_to keep going until I drop , &quot; he said . &quot; I still feel_like I can run some good times if I put it all together . . . . I ' m hoping that ( the injuries ) have made me hungrier. &quot; * Dropping_down : The Agoura High girls ' cross-country team , a Division I power since the state championships began in 1987 , will compete at the Division II level this year . Although Agoura was classified as a Division II school for the past four years based on its enrollment , Charger Coach Bill Duley petitioned the California Interscholastic Federation to move_up to the Division I level because he wanted his team to run in the top division . After finishing second to Palos Verdes -- now Peninsula -- in the first three state championships , Agoura won the Division I title from 1990-92 and placed fifth last year . The Chargers might not be as strong this year as in seasons past , but that did not influence his decision , Duley said . Instead , he cited concern about the boys ' team , which has remained at the Division II level the past four years . &quot; I moved_up to Division I because I wanted to beat Peninsula , &quot; Duley said . &quot; But I noticed that the boys kind of got washed over in the last couple of years because they were at a lower level . that ' s not good for the program. &quot; * Record watch : Denean Howard still holds the national high_school record in the girls ' 400 with her 50.87 clocking for Kennedy in 1982 , but Charlynna Foster of Clearwater , Fla. , broke Howard ' s age-14 record in last month ' s USA Track &amp; Field Junior Olympics . Foster ran 53.43 to trim nearly four-tenths of a second from Howard ' s mark of 53.82 set_in 1979 . * The beat goes_on : Mark Covert ' s running streak turned 26 last month and shows no signs of ending . Covert , the men ' s and women ' s cross-country and track coach at Antelope Valley College , has run at least three miles a day every day since July 23 , 1968 , the summer before his freshman year at Valley College . According to Covert , he had run 108 # 759 miles by the anniversary . that ' s an average of about 11 miles a day , 80 miles a week and 349 miles a month . Covert is believed to have the longest active streak in the world and is closing_in on the record of 28 years 8 months set by Great Britain ' s Ron Hill . * Trivia answer : Clarence ( Bud ) Houser was a double winner in the shotput and discus in the 1920 , ' 21 and ' 22 state championships for Oxnard High . Houser won the shotput and discus in the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris and repeated his victory in the discus in the 1928 Games in Amsterdam .</TEXT>
