   <HEADLINE> HIV-POSITIVE CANDIDATE THINKS POSITIVE ; MASSACHUSETTS : DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR LIEUTENANT_GOVERNOR , A HEMOPHILIAC , CONTRACTED VIRUS THROUGH A CONTAMINATED TRANSFUSION , BUT HAS NOT DEVELOPED AIDS . HIS GOAL IS TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a child , bleeding in his joints caused by hemophilia tortured his limbs . As a young_man , a contaminated transfusion left him with the virus that causes AIDS . Now Bob Massie is the Democratic candidate for lieutenant_governor , perhaps the first HIV-positive candidate for statewide office . &quot; I ' m very , very aware that you only have a certain time on this Earth and some people have more and some have less , &quot; he said , &quot; and the goal is to live life to the fullest within that span . &quot; Let ' s do the stuff that ' s important to do_in the time that we have , &quot; he said of his first bid for public office . Massie , running with gubernatorial candidate Mark Roosevelt in what is clearly a long-shot candidacy , said he wants to help boost small business and work_on heath care reform . But he emphasizes that he hasn ' t made his HIV status the centerpiece of the campaign . &quot; It ' s not a qualification for government . It ' s part of who I am , &quot; he said . &quot; It says something about my determination and about my candor. &quot; Massie , diagnosed with HIV in 1984 , said he hasn ' t developed any illnesses associated with HIV or AIDS . His opponents have not made his health an issue . Massie and Roosevelt face popular incumbent Republicans , Gov . William Weld and Lt . Gov . Paul Cellucci , in the November election . Massie is believed to be the first HIV-positive candidate to run_for statewide office , according to Kathleen DeBold , deputy director of the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund in Washington . &quot; There ' s often a shame and silence that surrounds HIV and there ' s really no reason for that , &quot; she said . Massie ' s candidacy &quot; sends a message that the lives of people with HIV are_full and active. &quot; His hemophilia -- a hereditary blood-clotting disorder -- was a spark for his father , Robert K . Massie , to write &quot; Nicholas and Alexandra , &quot; a best-selling novel about the last Russian czar through the eyes of the czar ' s son , Alexis , a hemophiliac . The Massie family ' s ties to the literary world have turned_into contributions from writers Erica Jong , Peter Maas and David McCullough , and from singer Barbra Streisand . Peter , Paul and Mary gave him a benefit_concert . Massie , 38 , says he is prepared_for the job of lieutenant_governor . He ' s helped the poor and sick as an Episcopal minister , fathered two children , written a book about his life called &quot; Journey , &quot; and picked_up three Ivy League degrees , including a business degree from Harvard and a divinity degree from Yale . And growing_up with hemophilia also taught him a_few lessons . He said he was often bedridden with internal bleeding and excruciating joint pain and continues to have painful arthritis in his knees and ankles . &quot; It ' s very hard to for me to dismiss the suffering of others , to just go_by it , because I know what it ' s like , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
