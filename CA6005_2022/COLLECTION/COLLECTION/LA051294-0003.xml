   <TEXT> I am not a fan of conspiracy theories . Nevertheless , I was amazed that in your Associated Press article ( &quot; Graphic J.F.K. Assassination Car Photos , Records Released , &quot; May 4 ) the definite statement is made that the released documents &quot; shed little additional light on the assassination. &quot; This conclusion was reached one day after 50 # 000 documents in 224 boxes were released to the public .
