   <HEADLINE> SCIENTIST DEFENDS TOBACCO RESEARCH GROUP ; CONGRESS : CHAIRMAN OF INDUSTRY-FUNDED COUNCIL CLAIMS MANUFACTURERS HAD NO INFLUENCE ON SMOKING STUDIES . BUT DOCUMENTS SUGGEST OTHERWISE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The head of the Council for Tobacco Research acknowledged Thursday that his organization acted_as an industry &quot; conduit , &quot; steering research grants to favored scientists in hopes of getting results that reflected positively on the industry . But he insisted that most of the researchers who did_work for the council were &quot; assured complete scientific freedom. &quot; Dr. James F . Glenn , chairman of the industry-funded council , which awards scientific grants to researchers studying the relationship between smoking and health , told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment that the work supported by his organization &quot; is performed by independent scientists &quot; and that the results are made available to the public . The council &quot; does not consider whether the research will be favorable or not favorable , &quot; he said . &quot; We are scientists . . . . Industry exercises no control. &quot; Under questioning by Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , chairman of the subcommittee , however , Glenn admitted that the council had bypassed a scientific advisory_board of outside experts to award &quot; special project &quot; grants requested by industry lawyers who wanted research that could bolster the industry ' s position in future litigation . Glenn said , however , that the council did so because of its own expertise in administering grants . The existence of such &quot; special projects &quot; was reported in Thursday ' s Los Angeles Times . Glenn , who also serves as chief_of_staff at the University of Kentucky Medical College Hospital , said the council has awarded more_than $ 220 million to finance more_than 1 # 380 research projects . Waxman released a series of documents written in 1953 and 1954 by officials at the public relations firm of Hill &amp; Knowlton indicating that the council was created solely to counter public concerns over early studies linking cigarettes to health_problems . One Hill &amp; Knowlton memo advised that &quot; the underlying purpose of any activity at this stage should be reassurance of the public . . . . It is important that the public recognize the existence of weighty scientific views which hold there is no proof that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer. &quot; One of the firm ' s major suggestions was the formation of a special research committee . &quot; The word ' research ' should be included in the name of the committee to establish the fact that the group will carry_on or sponsor fundamental scientific_research , &quot; the memo said . Moreover , it recommended that the group have a director who was &quot; a medical research authority of unquestioned national repute &quot; and an advisory_board of &quot; men whose integrity is beyond question. &quot; The first public statement of the committee should be &quot; designed to reassure the public that the industry ' s first and foremost interest is the public health ( and ) there is no proof of the claims which link smoking and lung_cancer . . . . &quot; Waxman said this &quot; paints a disturbing picture of public relations masquerading as science. &quot; In response , Glenn asked Waxman : &quot; Are you impugning my integrity ? &quot; In an exchange with Rep . Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) , another Capitol_Hill tobacco foe , Glenn said he believed that smoking is a &quot; risk factor &quot; for lung_cancer , but refused to acknowledge there was a &quot; causal &quot; relationship between the two . &quot; I reject your premise that we are a biased organization , I reject the premise that smoking causes cancer and I reject the inference that our activities have been to obscure the truth , &quot; he said . &quot; On the contrary , they ' ve been dedicated to developing scientific truth . &quot; No one has been able to demonstrate that smoking causes any disease , &quot; he added . He acknowledged that 80 % of lung_cancers occur among smokers but noted that many smokers do not develop lung_cancer and 20 % of lung_cancers occur among nonsmokers . &quot; Smoking is a risk factor . What we ' ve got_to find_out is why the cell goes wrong. &quot; &quot; Do you believe smoking causes cancer ? &quot; Wyden asked . &quot; No sir , &quot; Glenn replied . &quot; Do you believe smoking is an addiction , &quot; Wyden asked . &quot; No sir , &quot; Glenn replied . &quot; You are in isolation , &quot; Wyden said , citing the numerous medical experts and public health organizations who disagree .</TEXT>
