   <TEXT> The Times today publishes a special report , &quot; Coping With the Quake , &quot; a resources guide that includes information on construction and tells how to clean_up , and how to guard your personal and financial health . This material appears in Section B and takes the place of the Metro section . As a result of the quake , there may be delays in receiving papers and difficulty in reaching The Times . We hope to correct these problems as soon as possible .</TEXT>
