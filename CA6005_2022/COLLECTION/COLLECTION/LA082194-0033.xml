   <HEADLINE> PALM LATITUDES : MIND AND BODY ; PERSECUTION COMPLEX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After seeing several of their peers charged with sexual malfeasance , getting sued for purportedly encouraging the recovery of false memories and just generally getting hauled into courts for any number of problems , real and imagined , many California psychotherapists are , well , paranoid . And , perhaps , with good reason . There are 8 # 000 to 10 # 000 lawsuits against therapists pending in U.S. courts , according to the Philadelphia-based False Memory Syndrome Foundation , and at least 1 # 000 of them are in California . Orange County , says attorney O . Brandt Caudill , is the epicenter of recovered memory lawsuits . &quot; Maybe California has more of these lawsuits because we ' ve got more touchy-feely therapists doing experimental things , &quot; suggests Newport Beach psychoanalyst Lawrence E . Hedges . &quot; California has more therapists per capita than any other state , and many have limited training , &quot; he adds . In an effort to educate the mental_health community , Hedges , along with psychotherapists Robert Hilton and Virginia Wink Hilton , organized &quot; Therapists at Risk , &quot; a seminar held earlier this year in Anaheim . More_than 100 people came_to learn about &quot; the perils of the intimacy of the psychotherapy relationship in the current climate of accusation and litigation. &quot; Plundering the past is a double-edged sword , says Wink Hilton . &quot; Therapists should be very cautious about ever leading or directing a client into recovery of lost memories ; at_the_same_time , this brings_about a reticence to explore the very issues the client might need to deal with. &quot; This dilemma has resulted in several new support groups . The Los Angeles Society of Clinical Psychologists and the Los Angeles-based Professional Advocacy Network have both recently established groups for therapists who have been accused of an ethical or legal breach . The validity of the accusations is not at_issue ; the forums exist solely to allow participants to air their feelings about the perils of the psychic territory they mine , as well as the litigious nature of contemporary America . The network is already reporting up_to 100 calls a month -- half from California . Ellen Alperstein</TEXT>
