   <TEXT> Frustrated by bans on smoking in restaurants that have been enacted by more_than 100 California cities and counties , Philip Morris U.S.A. -- the nation ' s biggest cigarette maker -- and a small number of restaurant owners are pushing a ballot initiative to invalidate such ordinances . The initiative would leave regulation of smoking to the Legislature , where smoking laws could be changed only on a two-thirds vote . Tobacco_industry lobbyists , who make big campaign contributions to selected politicians , would thus have to buy the favors of only a handful of legislators in Sacramento to kill controls on smoking in restaurants and workplaces . What this effort to override local controls and sound health policy seeks isn ' t just a license to foul the air but -- given passive smoke ' s toxicity -- a license to kill . As the U.S. surgeon_general keeps reminding us , 44 # 000 nonsmoking Americans die each year because of exposure to tobacco smoke . If passed , this initiative would significantly increase nonsmokers ' risks . The cynicism behind this effort , the disregard of a mountain of scientific studies , boggles the mind . The evidence linking tobacco smoking to heart_disease and a variety of cancers is overwhelming . The sponsors of the so-called California Uniform Tobacco Control Act nonetheless hope they can get enough signatures to qualify it for the November ballot . Natural disasters , like earthquakes , can ' t be prevented . But some gross human stupidities can be . No Californian should lend his or her signature to this outrageous initiative .</TEXT>
