   <HEADLINE> RUNNING THE RISK ; WHY WOULD SOMEONE ENTER A SHAKY BUILDING ? TO GRAB ANYTHING , EVEN NAILS , LINKING THEM TO AN OLD LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Andre Rogers was trembling and out_of_breath from his last dash into the ruins of his condemned apartment . But he was smiling . &quot; Jesus didn ' t save me from a 6.6 quake to kill me now ' cause I came_back for my shoes . No sir . No sir . If I didn ' t die at 4:31 a.m. , I ' m not going_to die now . I believe it ! &quot; In the days after the Northridge earthquake , Rogers , 26 , and thousands of other survivors continue to risk life and limb sneaking back into the unstable rubble they once called home . And they are doing_it for every imaginable reason -- or non-reason , depending_on your perspective . A young_woman climbs through a broken window to rescue a parakeet trapped in a collapsed kitchen . A man slides_down the 45-degree incline of his sunken living_room to grab a stack of CDs he &quot; can ' t live without. &quot; Jim Taylor , 51 , ducks under a newly fallen I-beam in the carport beneath his Granada Hills apartment complex to retrieve a can of nails . &quot; I needed them to hang some pictures in my new place , &quot; he says with a shrug . A man in a baseball_cap pulls_up his truck to the front of a condo on the outskirts of Reseda . Without a word , he hands each of his teen-age sons a hammer and leads them into the ruins of their home . Quickly and quietly , they empty the swaying rooms of what little is left . Ten nerve-racking minutes later , the 13-year-old has retrieved two plastic milk crates and an old football . His 17-year-old brother has rescued a pink receipt for a lottery ticket and a cork bulletin_board papered with family messages and reminders of long-passed doctors ' appointments . &quot; Aren ' t you afraid to go_in there ? &quot; the older_boy is asked . &quot; Oh , well , sure , ' cause it ' s unsafe . But Dad says we ' re not scared -- I mean , Dad says it ' s OK . So we ' re not scared . . . . You do what you gotta do sometimes , right ? that ' s what Dad says. &quot; * What makes people take such risks ? When is a human life worth a can of nails ? In the throes of disaster , psychologists agree , people cannot be expected to always act rationally . &quot; Of course , this sort of behavior is irrational , but it ' s not abnormal -- not for what these people have been through . Emotions are never rational , &quot; says Carl Frederick , the UCLA professor who wrote the mental_health section of the national Disaster Relief Act . Brett , 35 , has been in and out of his condemned apartment several times . The first time was for blankets and water to get_through the first day and night . The second time was to save his late grandmother ' s &quot; truly irreplaceable &quot; Bible . &quot; I couldn ' t have lived with myself if I hadn ' t got that out , &quot; he says . Although Brett feared for his life when he was caught in his shaky building during one of the aftershocks , he says what he feared most was being caught by police . &quot; that ' s why I ' m not giving you my last_name . I ' m an artist and I ' ve had to get all sorts of important pieces out of my place , but I don ' t want to go_to jail for it. &quot; Entering a condemned building is a violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code and is punishable by fines of up_to $ 1 # 500 and six months imprisonment . The law is designed to protect displaced residents from their perilous impulses . But as fears grow for the safety of those entering buildings severely damaged by the quake and aftershocks , building and fire officials are mobilizing inspection and escort services to help survivors retrieve belongings from structures in no immediate danger of collapse . &quot; But people going_in alone past the red condemned signs may very well be risking their lives , &quot; warns Robert Picott , deputy superintendent of the city ' s Building and Safety Department . &quot; We understand how traumatized these people are and we ' re willing to help them , but our first obligation is to protect them from harm. &quot; Fierce attachments to our belongings are not unique to Americans . Medical psychologist Frederick , who has studied survivors ' reactions to disaster all_over the world , says we may indeed be materialistic , but such feelings are even more intense in other cultures . &quot; After Hurricane Fifi hit Honduras in 1974 , 5 # 000 people lost their homes and it was like losing a part of themselves , &quot; Frederick recalls . &quot; When they were told they could never return , hundreds of them committed suicide . They died rather than leave that piece_of_land . If somebody in Beverly Hills had lost their home and were told to move and get another one some place else , they would n ' t kill themselves over it. &quot; Still , it is not unusual in times of great loss for some victims to seem possessed by their possessions , says Barbara Blasdel , a San Francisco trauma therapist . &quot; We pick things that will give us some sense of control . An old pair of shoes may be a sign of comfort . It ' s a way of trying to impose some sort of control over the chaos , &quot; Blasdel says . &quot; Going_back for something is a way of reaching back for fragments of their old lives so they can start again . Even if it is dangerous. &quot; But the very danger of going_back may be comforting -- or at least distracting -- for others , suggests psychologist Keith Johnsgard , who has spent four decades studying risk-taking behavior . &quot; Sensation-seeking is a basic human trait with a biological component . Some of us are just born at the high end of the scale , &quot; says Johnsgard , 66 , who recently gave_up parachuting so it would n ' t interfere with his mountain climbing . &quot; Cops and robbers , parachuters , mountain climbers all tend to have low levels of ( the brain chemical ) serotonin . Maybe risk is the body ' s way of adjusting for that . We really don ' t know . But we do know that risk-takers assess risk differently than everybody else . And more likely than not , they tend to be young and they tend to be men . What would be very scary for many of us would be exciting for them. &quot; Andre Rogers , panting from the last trip into his unsteady apartment , is stopped short by a question from the sidewalk . &quot; Would I die for this pair of shoes ? &quot; Whoa . I didn ' t think_about that . What I was thinking was I just got_to take the chance , got_to take the chance. &quot;</TEXT>
