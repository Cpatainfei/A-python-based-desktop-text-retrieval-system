   <HEADLINE> CHRISTMAS IN JANUARY FOR ARMENIANS ; RELIGION : KAREKIN II , BASED IN BEIRUT , OFFICIATES AT CEREMONY AT A CONGREGATION IN ENCINO . CHURCH IS ONE OF A HANDFUL THAT HOLDS THE OBSERVANCE EARLY IN THE NEW YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Armenian pontiff Catholicos Karekin II celebrated Christmas rites Thursday before 2 # 500 worshipers , including a woman who last saw him in 1983 in Cyprus and a 22-year-old convert who was impressed with the ceremonial pomp . Karekin II , based in Beirut , is one of two spiritual_leaders in the world for Armenian Christians who follow the ancient rites . He began a 19-day California visit this week . Alice Halladjian traveled from Glendale to the Holy Martyrs Armenian Apostolic Church in Encino so that she could see Karekin II arrive for the 11 a.m. Pontifical Divine Liturgy . The Armenian Apostolic Church is one of a handful of Eastern church bodies that have kept an early January date for Christmas , in contrast to the December observance in most of Christendom . &quot; She never misses a Sunday or any other service , &quot; Kevork Halladjian said of his mother , who emigrated from Greece in 1990 . Emerging later in gold-embroidered vestments and miter ( and the inevitable portable microphone almost invisible in the folds of his garb ) , the 61-year-old Karekin II stepped under a red canopy and onto a red_carpet as incense wafted along his route to the large church hall . Watching all this while holding a 2-month-old baby wrapped in a blanket was red-haired Angelique Meshefedjian , 22 , of Van Nuys , who has been married to a man of Armenian heritage for two years . &quot; I was married and baptized in this church , but this is the first time I ' ve come for a service , &quot; she said , adding that her background is nondenominational Christian . &quot; I like the atmosphere , &quot; she said . &quot; They put_on a nice performance. &quot; Karekin II , an Oxford-educated prelate who is articulate in English but speaks mostly in Armenian at services , will officiate at Armenian Memorial_Day ceremonies today at Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn Memorial Park and at the Armenian Martyrs Monument in Montebello ' s Bicknell Park . He will return Saturday night to Holy Martyrs church to speak at a fund-raising banquet for the church ' s high_school . The congregation also has a school campus in Northridge for lower grades . In an animated sermon during Thursday ' s three-hour rites , the pontiff exhorted church_members to make personal sacrifices to support Armenian schools . He referred briefly in English to Gov . Pete Wilson ' s State of the State Address on Wednesday in which the governor said new jobs and safe streets were going_to be twin pillars of his administration this year . &quot; How can we get safe streets and new jobs without genuine education ? &quot; Karekin II asked . As thousands crowded the church ' s main hall and the 250-seat church where the services were relayed by close-circuit television , hundreds of other Armenian Americans were attending St . Peter Armenian Church not far away in Van Nuys . St . Peter is aligned with the branch of the ancient church based in Etchmaidzin , the Republic of Armenia , currently headed by Vazken I . The break occurred in 1933 in_disputes over whether the Armenian-based church was free_of Soviet influence . But with the breakup of the Soviet_Union and especially after the disastrous 1988 earthquake in Armenia , leaders of the two church bodies have worked toward reconciliation . &quot; We have unity , the only questions left are administrative , &quot; Karekin II said to reporters Thursday . &quot; In due course , it will happen if we get stronger cooperation in the ranks of ordinary people. &quot; An estimated 300 # 000 Armenians in Southern California are associated with one wing of the historic church or the other . Nevertheless , many Armenian Americans have gravitated to other churches , such_as former Gov . George Deukmejian , an Episcopalian , and the 1 # 000 active members of the United Armenian Congregational Church in Cahuenga Pass . That congregation held Christmas services on both Dec . 25 and Thursday night in keeping with their bicultural tradition . When Jan . 6 falls on a weekday , Armenian churches have found that morning rites have not been well-attended -- except in recent years as the tide of immigrants has grown , priests said . Holy Martyrs church especially has a high proportion of new arrivals in its congregation , according to the priests . But the occasion of His Holiness Karekin II officiating at the Christmas rites drew a much larger crowd . &quot; Last year , when Jan . 6 was_on a Monday , we had only 25 % of this crowd , &quot; estimated Harout Shakelian , a car broker . &quot; This is extraordinary. &quot;</TEXT>
