   <TEXT> Regarding &quot; Zanzibar : Adventure on Tanzania ' s Spice Island &quot; by Jessica Misuraca : I visited Dar es Salaam in March . Ms . Misuraca ' s description of it as &quot; delightfully unspoiled &quot; is misleading . The city is a dangerous place for tourists . The merchants close their businesses before darkness sets_in because the streets are unsafe at night . In fact , there is not much , if any , in the way of night street lighting . During the day , the streets are dangerous , especially for tourists foolish enough to carry backpacks , cameras , purses , luggage or anything of_value . ALLAN B . STRELLER Santa Monica I was born in Zanzibar and have spent most of my life in Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam . It appears that Ms . Misuraca and group did not meet the right person or guide to take them around and show them good hotels , good restaurants and places of interest . Zanzibar has a number of good hotels , among them Hotel Bwawani , Africa House , Zanzibar Hotel , Narrow Street Hotel , Uroa Beach Hotel , High Hill Hotel and Hotel International . All have restaurants . There are also a number of guest houses and beach hotels with accommodations that serve food . PRAVIN V . MEHTA Corona I have traveled extensively in Africa on many &quot; offbeat &quot; safaris over the years , including much bush walking , hiking around the southern rim of Lake Turkana , crossing the Sahara in the east and west , and spending weeks in the mud of the Sudd . I have traveled_to more_than 80 countries around the world and nowhere else quite competes with Africa . I am planning a year and a half safari by four-wheel drive across Africa . We will cross the Sahara , explore the cultural delights of West Africa , crawl through the Zaire forest , track game in East and Southern Africa , and learn about the new democracy in South_Africa . This trip will be much more comprehensive and run at a slower pace than the commercially available trips . Anyone interested in sharing costs and an adventure can contact me at 5532 Woodruff Ave. , Suite 196 , Lakewood , Calif . 90713 .
