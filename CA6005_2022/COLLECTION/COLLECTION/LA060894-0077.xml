   <HEADLINE> CLINTON BACKS PLAN TO DIVIDE BOSNIA IN TWO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , discussing the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina , told French leaders Tuesday that he supports a partition plan that would give Bosnian Serbs almost half of the former Yugoslav republic ' s territory . Clinton also said for the first time that he supports a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire plan that is opposed by the Bosnian Muslims , who have been the victims of more_than two years of aggression and land grabs by Bosnian Serbs . In a rare speech before the_French National Assembly , Clinton endorsed a proposal by U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi for a four-month cessation of hostilities . The Bosnian Muslims want a much shorter cease-fire , fearing that the Serbs will use the time to consolidate their gains and fortify their positions . Officials traveling with Clinton said that both U.S. positions represent a shift from earlier policies on Bosnia . The Administration had opposed the partition plan , which would give 51 % of Bosnian territory to Bosnian Muslims and Croats and 49 % to Bosnian Serbs , as unfair . But in recent months , the Americans have reluctantly come_to accept the plan as the best the Bosnian Muslims can hope to get , given their inferior military_position . The Administration endorsed the Akashi cease-fire plan in part to pressure the Bosnian Muslims to make concessions to bring a speedier resolution of the civil_war . But officials said the length and the terms of the cease-fire remain to be negotiated . &quot; We ' re not saying that the cessation of hostilities has to be four months , &quot; a senior Administration official said . &quot; If the parties were to agree to some_other period_of_time , we would support that as well . The essential thing is to support the cessation of hostilities. &quot; In his speech before the National Assembly , Clinton cited the conflict in Bosnia as painful evidence of the need for European unity against racial and ethnic violence . The speech -- given from the podium of the imposing , semicircular hall where the Assembly meets -- marked the first time in 75 years that a U.S. leader has been accorded the honor of speaking_to the_French Parliament . President Woodrow Wilson addressed the Assembly in February , 1919 , telling France it was the &quot; frontier of freedom &quot; and elaborating on his proposal for a League of Nations . Two other foreign heads_of_state -- King Juan Carlos of Spain and Queen Beatrice of the_Netherlands -- have spoken before the_French Parliament in the last year . Clinton used the occasion to call_for greater social and economic integration in Europe , including the states of the former Soviet_Union , and the strengthening of freedom against threats from anti-democratic forces . &quot; We can already see the grim alternative , &quot; Clinton said , as marble statues representing Liberty and Public Order gazed down on him . &quot; Militant nationalism is_on the rise , transforming the healthy pride of nations , tribes , religious and ethnic_groups into cancerous prejudice , eating_away at states and leaving their people addicted to the political painkillers of violence and demagoguery. &quot; He said the slaughter in Bosnia and the random violence of skinheads in Europe and the United States are symptoms of this disease . He said weaving the various European_nations and cultures together in peaceful alliance will be the work of &quot; years , even decades. &quot; It is a particularly difficult challenge , Clinton said , because the peoples of Europe &quot; do not feel themselves in imminent peril to confront more distant threats &quot; like Nazism or Soviet expansionism . During his day in Paris , Clinton met with French business_leaders and top government officials , including Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac , Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur and President Francois Mitterrand . The subject of Bosnia came_up in each of the official meetings , and Clinton went_out of his way to express solidarity with the_French . &quot; All of us want to bring an end to the fighting , &quot; Clinton said . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said Washington and Paris , after having been at_odds for months over Bosnia policy , now have &quot; very convergent &quot; views . Another top aide said that over the past weeks , the United States has &quot; reluctantly &quot; come closer to the European view of the conflict in the former Yugoslav federation . Hillary Rodham Clinton accompanied her husband to the National Assembly but had a full schedule on_her_own the rest of the day . She had breakfast with Social_Affairs Minister Simone Veil , an outspoken advocate of legalized abortion and state support for child_care . In her remarks at the event , Mrs . Clinton said that France is &quot; far ahead of the U.S. on children and family issues . There is much the United States can learn from that kind of national commitment. &quot; Before the day ' s final official event , a state dinner , Clinton took a half-hour jog along the Seine and through the Tuileries Gardens . One stroller in the gardens , surprised to see a major world leader jogging in small blue shorts , commented : &quot; Mitterrand ne jog pas . Il est trop vieux. &quot; ( &quot; Mitterrand does not jog . He is too old. &quot; ) The French leader is 77 .</TEXT>
