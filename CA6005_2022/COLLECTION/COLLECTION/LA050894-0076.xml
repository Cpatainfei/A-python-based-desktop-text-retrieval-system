   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : FOR MOMS , WHO KNOW WHAT TRUE LOVE IS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Today , I will probably make dinner for my mother , tell her that I love her and that it thrills me to see her with my daughter -- her grandchild -- to whom she is so tenderly devoted . I will probably thank God my mother is alive after a critical illness last year , then snap_at her when she gets_on my nerves . I will probably wonder how the emotions of a seemingly sane , loving daughter can zing between love and irritability without good reason , like a pinball in_play . And I will probably be stung by remorse , until I remind myself that passion , in all its forms , is what this most primal of connections is all about . Mother and child . There is never any real resolution between mothers and children , nor should there be , I suppose , because this great roller_coaster of a relationship is eternal . I have seen my mother hovering at death ' s door . Or maybe it was death hovering at hers . Such moments suck the adult right out of you , leaving only a teary child pleading for her mommy . My pleas , fortunately , were answered . And I promise I will try not to snap_at her today . As I gratefully spend the day with my mom , I would also like to offer my appreciation to a laundry list ( how appropriate ) of mothers I know , all_of whom have taught me a thing or two about love . So Happy Mother ' s Day . . . . * To Kathleen , a motherless child , who gave_birth to a beautiful boy one year ago : You struggle every day with the memory of_your_own mother , who killed herself when you were only 8 , and you prove every day , with your fierce love for your son , that children can triumph over legacies of pain . You inspire me . To the teen mothers at the Business Industry School in Los Angeles , young_women who have taken_on the greatest responsibility of all , and often by accident : By staying in school and taking_advantage of the extraordinary child-care center_on your campus , you are proving that the circle can be broken . You are living examples of hope . To Julie , pregnant now with a boy , who has decided that parenthood must_not be missed , even if there is no man with whom to share it -- at least not right now : You can ' t possibly know the struggles and turmoil that await you as a single mother , but the goodness and generosity you have shown your friends over the years will surely be repaid when you need them . And you will need them . To Kathryn , the frustrated mother of an adolescent girl all but abandoned by her affluent father : Your fight for what is rightfully your child ' s -- thousands upon thousands of dollars in back child_support -- now spans oceans with his move to another country . Yet you persist , while facing poverty , illness and a callous legal_system that has let you down time and again . Your tenacity will , and must , be repaid . To Janie , who has known financial struggles that would make mere mortals weep : Although the demons prowled at your door , you created a safe , magical cocoon for your 4-year-old daughter , a spirited , loving child with an imagination as big as her mother ' s heart . To Guillermina , who came_to this country illegally at 15 to give her unborn children a better life : Terrified but determined , you crossed a river that rose to your chin and nearly suffocated in the trunk of a car to get here . You are legal now , you own a home and pay your taxes . And you are the mother of two beautiful American girls , who are sure to be proud_of you when you finally tell them your story . To Saundra , who came_home from work one terrible day to find that her toddler son had been caught in gang cross-fire , shot in the head : Your faith in the Lord and your dedication to your son ' s recovery have meant the difference between a half-life and full one for this astonishing , resilient little boy . To Janice , whose beloved sister died_suddenly and unexpectedly last month , leaving two children alone in the world but for her : Your decision to raise your nephews , while still caring_for your ailing mother , is the very definition of selflessness and courage . To my grandmother , Annie , who even at 89 is a mother lion with her three cubs , aging lions themselves of 70 , 65 and 56 : Two weeks ago , when the natural_order turned_on its head , I took you to see your son -- my father -- recovering from a heart_attack . How I wish I ' d had a camera to record that precious moment of concerned motherhood -- you , with your walker , and Dad with his IV pole , inching down the hospital hallway together . And to all mothers , wherever you are , may today be_full of love and laughter . . . and may your children hold their tongues .</TEXT>
