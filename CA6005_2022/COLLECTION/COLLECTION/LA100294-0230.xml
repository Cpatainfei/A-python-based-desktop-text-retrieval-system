   <HEADLINE> SCOTT HARRIS : ODD PAIR OF GADFLIES IN A BUZZ OVER HATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They sat together amid the vacant seats near the front , this odd couple united by their distrust of the Glendale City_Council . Emzy Veazy III and David E . Wallis Jr . have been called gadflies , and every city needs a_few . These allies have distinct viewpoints , and other differences as well . Veazy is a 43-year-old unemployed African American whose business_card identifies him as a &quot; rugged_individualist , &quot; among other things . On this day he was dressed casually and toted a video camera , expecting to record an abuse of civil_rights . Wallis is 57 , well-to-do and white , though he prefers the term &quot; Anglo-Saxon. &quot; He ' s a retired Jet_Propulsion Laboratory engineer who has twice waged unsuccessful campaigns for elective office . They had come_to challenge Mayor Eileen Givens ' noble experiment to make Glendale a friendlier town and spruce_up its image . Not to paint with a broad brush , but Glendale , as the mayor knows , has long suffered from an image of what may politely be described as ethnic intolerance . Givens appointed a task_force that drew_up a list of proposals , most notably the creation of a &quot; community response team &quot; to comfort the victims of hate crimes and decry such acts . It is said that you can ' t legislate morality , but only two days after the task_force announced its proposals , its strategy was put to a test . Six orange swastikas were found on Temple Sinai , Glendale ' s only synagogue . The mayor , police_chief and City_Council promptly pitched_in with paint_rollers and words of support . It was the talk_of_the_town . But Emzy Veazy didn ' t want to discuss Temple Sinai . He handed the camcorder to Wallis and stood before the council . Why , he wondered , weren ' t there any blacks on Givens ' task_force ? * It ' s a good question . Why is it that blacks -- who after Armenians have been Glendale ' s second-most-frequent target of hate crimes since 1986 -- were unrepresented on the panel ? Gadflies often raise good questions . Unfortunately , diplomacy is seldom a strong suit . Wallis aimed the camera as Veazy delivered his diatribe . &quot; I give Mayor Eileen Givens ' secret meeting and anti-black people Blue_Ribbon Task_Force on Community Relations the thumbs down and call it a prejudicial group which represents a high crime against humanity ! &quot; Veazy declared . &quot; Mayor Givens , you and your rude hate crime task_force members need to be renamed the OK No Blacks Task_Force in Our Community Relations . It is Glendale historically at its best to continue to send_out to the community and the world that Glendale prides itself in excluding black people from full participation , as it does exclude its civic-minded council watchers. &quot; Veazy , the only regular &quot; civic-minded council watcher &quot; among black Glendale residents , wondered why he wasn ' t appointed to the mayor ' s task_force . The answer seemed obvious . Next came Wallis ' turn , with Veazy serving as cameraman . Someday , all_of this may appear on the Glendale public-access cable show that Veazy produces . Wallis ' delivery was measured and professorial . Unlike Veazy , who argued that Givens ' project didn ' t go_far enough , Wallis argued that she went too far , calling the task_force an &quot; overreaction &quot; that should be disbanded . &quot; As an American of Anglo-Saxon ethnicity and democratic tradition , &quot; Wallis said , &quot; I strongly object to political propagandizing and overreaction with_regard_to special-interest groups , including ethnic or religious ones . I want city government to carry_out city functions , such_as ensuring that the streets are clean . . . . It is not a city function to organize to ' denounce ' anyone or anything . . . . The city should not overextend itself into social do-gooding beyond its competence , nor overreact to its detriment . . . . The therapy is worse than the disease ! &quot; The odd couple . One levels charges of racism . The other wonders what all_the fuss is about . Veazy and Wallis failed to make the City_Council see the light . Councilman Sheldon Baker drew applause after angrily slamming into Wallis ' suggestion that swastikas at Temple Sinai should not be a concern of the City_Council . Councilman Larry Zarian rose to the defense of Givens , who said she chooses not to respond to personal attacks . Representatives of the Glendale Chamber_of_Commerce took time to laud the task_force proposal . The vote was 5-0 to adopt the recommendations . But the questions linger . * Why weren ' t there any African Americans on the task_force ? The mayor says she tried , but admits that she did not try hard . After all , for all its ethnic diversity -- the city has large Latino , Armenian and Asian populations -- Glendale remains less than 2 % black and is therefore short on black community leaders . Givens says she is hopeful that African Americans will participate on the community response team proposed by the task_force . Then there ' s Wallis ' question . Is the therapy worse than the disease ? Wallis worries that the anti-hate campaign will backfire , inspiring hard-core bigots and perverse pranksters . Indeed , Wallis suggests that , were it not for the task_force , the swastikas at Temple Sinai may have never appeared . Many people speculate that the vandalism was an answer to the task_force proposals and the presence of the synagogue ' s rabbi , Carole Meyers , on the panel . In an earlier address to the council , Meyers delivered what in retrospect may be considered a rebuttal to Wallis ' views . Whatever the vandals ' motive , she said , the community is wise_to condemn such deeds . She reminded the council that , seven years earlier , Temple Sinai had to confront a similar desecration on its own . &quot; There was no plan like this -- and nothing happened , &quot; Meyers recalled . &quot; We quietly and quickly scrubbed the swastikas . . . . We thought we had done a good job . . . . Then we entered our sanctuary and mourned and grieved in silence. &quot; This time , Temple Sinai was &quot; grateful beyond words &quot; for the way that the symbols of hate inspired acts of kindness and brotherly_love . And Temple Sinai , the rabbi added , won ' t forget its friends when it is their time of need . I asked Emzy Veazy III whether he had videotaped the rabbi . He hadn ' t .
