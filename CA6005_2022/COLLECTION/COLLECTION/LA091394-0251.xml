   <TEXT> &quot; Never before , &quot; said the congressman , &quot; has society been confronted with a power so full of potential danger . . . ( a ) menace to our people. &quot; No , he wasn ' t talking_about nuclear_energy in the 1950s or about electromagnetic fields in the 1990s ; he was talking_about the internal_combustion engine in the 1850s . Americans have always had what Michael Fumento , in his book &quot; Science Under Siege , &quot; calls a &quot; fear and loathing of technology , &quot; and that fear plays a major role in the central paradox of our time : Thanks largely to technology , Americans are &quot; safer than ever before , &quot; says Lester Lave , an economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh . &quot; But at_the_same_time , they are more concerned about health and safety than ever before. &quot; The news media , which should be able to alleviate public anxiety by explaining the benefits of modern technology -- and by putting the risks of technology in perspective -- instead often exacerbate anxiety with ignorant and / or alarmist coverage . But risk assessment studies have repeatedly shown that despite reassurances from scientists ( and even , at times , from the media ) , people are frightened by nuclear_energy , electromagnetic fields , pesticides and other new chemicals and technologies precisely because they are new -- exotic , unfamiliar and , frequently , invisible . that ' s more unnerving to most people than the familiar , visible bicycle or swimming_pool , both of which are involved in several hundred deaths a year . Risk assessment experts say many Americans are afraid of modern technology in part because they have lost faith in technology . If our supposedly superior technology couldn ' t win the war in Vietnam or even rescue a_few dozen hostages in Iran , this thinking suggests , how can it be trusted to develop safe medical devices , pesticides or cellular_telephones . Some social critics see this as part of a larger loss of faith in everything from government to so-called experts to the media to American industry itself . In this bleak view : The government lied to us about Watergate and Vietnam . The experts are wrong about everything from the economy to criminal trials . The media hide behind the 1st Amendment , but they really only want to sell papers and boost ratings . The automobile companies said they couldn ' t afford to put seat_belts or passive restraints in cars because people would n ' t pay_for them . The tobacco companies still say smoking cigarettes hasn ' t been proven to cause lung_cancer . Can anyone be believed anymore ? Or does everyone have a vested_interest in promoting a specific agenda ? Experts in risk assessment say these are key components in many people ' s perception of risk , regardless of what the experts or the media say : Why should I take a risk when someone else gets the benefit ? If you enjoy smoking , fine ; but I don ' t , so why should I have to take_a_chance on jeopardizing my health -- or why do I have to suffer the discomfort of inhaling your smoke ? But there are almost as_many factors_in people ' s perception of risk as there are elements in the atmosphere . The California Environmental Protection Agency tried to address some of those concerns this year in a 640-page comparative risk report urging that a higher priority be given to environmental problems that affect people ' s peace_of_mind and &quot; good mental health. &quot; Just as people are more likely to be suspicious of artificial pesticides than of natural pesticides , so are they more likely to worry about risks they cannot control ( airplane crashes ) than about risks they think they can control ( car crashes ) , even though actuarial data are overwhelmingly against them . Studies have shown that as_many as 85 % of drivers think they are &quot; better than average , &quot; a perception that is disproved not only by statistical probability but by the statistics on highway carnage . More_than 40 # 000 Americans a year die in traffic accidents . Your chance of being one of them is about 1 in 6 # 000 . Last week ' s tragic crash of a USAir jet near Pittsburgh notwithstanding , your chance of being killed in the crash of a First World commercial airliner , according to MIT , is 1 in 4.4 million . For a domestic_flight , the risk is even smaller -- 1 in 11 million if you ' re on an established air carrier on a coast-to-coast flight . But one-third of Americans don ' t even bother to wear seat_belts in their cars , and just as the media devote far more coverage to air crashes than to highway deaths , so most Americans worry more about flying than about driving . One reason for this , of course , is that most fatal car accidents involve relatively few people . When a commercial airliner goes_down , hundreds may die . That high toll -- along with the relative rarity of a major air crash -- powerfully concentrates both the human mind and the media spotlight . Perhaps the greatest distinction people make in evaluating risks -- consciously or not -- is the degree to which they willingly assume the risk . Study after study has shown that people resent most strongly those risks , real or imagined , that have been thrust upon them -- as is the case with everything from pesticides to nuclear_power plants ; they are far more tolerant of risks they assume voluntarily . The U.S. Department_of_Transportation has estimated , for example , that Americans ' increased preference for small cars has led to an additional 1 # 300 traffic deaths annually . But no one forced Americans to buy those smaller cars or concealed from them the greater vulnerability to severe collision damage . People decided to trade off greater safety for greater fuel efficiency -- assuming they thought_about the trade-off at all . &quot; If you choose to smoke , if you choose to drive a car , if you choose to sky-dive . . . if you choose to eat movie popcorn , those are all voluntary choices you ' re making , realizing that there ' s some degree of risk involved , &quot; says Rae Tyson , who writes_about the environment for USA Today . &quot; Being exposed to some chemical that ' s emanating from the wallboard in your living room is not a voluntary risk. &quot; It ' s the involuntary risks that get the most media coverage because it ' s the involuntary risks that most outrage the public . Ironically , many social_scientists say , there is one overriding explanation for our outrage : Medical_science and economic advancement have so reduced or eliminated many of our longstanding , legitimate fears -- and so improved our standard_of_living -- that we ( in the news media and the public alike ) have the luxury to worry about many essentially peripheral and hypothetical problems . &quot; A richer society can afford to worry more about de minimus risks , &quot; says Bud Ward , executive_director of the National Health Center of the National Safety Council . &quot; The wealthier we become , the better educated we become , probably the more risk-averse we ' re going to become . &quot; I don ' t think the people in Rwanda now . . . worry much about radon or Alar or lead poisoning. &quot; The millions of poor people in the world , the homeless and the starving , are not the ones calling loudly for bans on smoking , nuclear_power plants , pesticides and silicone breast_implants . Nor are they the editors of the newspapers or the news directors of the television_stations that decide to give prominent play to these demands . The leaders of most protests against pesticides or power_plants and of most news organizations tend to be people with higher-than-average education and socioeconomic status , people who can afford a desire for what the late political_scientist Aaron Wildavsky and social_anthropologist Mary Douglas called &quot; a sense of individual control over social forces &quot; ; they have enough of a stake in the world that they want to be absolutely sure they live long enough to enjoy it . Among activists , &quot; this want is so imperious that their demands tend to be ' non-negotiable , ' &quot; Wildavsky and Douglas said in their book &quot; Risk and Culture. &quot; Many forces in society -- the media , the government , special_interest groups , the scientific community itself -- cater to and exploit that zeal , even when it clearly runs contrary to good science , good government and good journalism . To get reelected , most politicians pass laws and fund programs that address their constituents ' fears rather than trying to persuade the body_politic that common_sense and medical research clearly demonstrate that a particular &quot; risk &quot; is virtually no risk at all . Special_interest pressure_groups contribute significantly to that process . The environmental movement awakened Americans -- and American politicians -- to many serious problems , says Gregg Easterbrook , a contributing editor at Newsweek and the author of a forthcoming book on the environment . Because of these efforts , Easterbrook says , air and water_pollution and toxic emissions by industry have all decreased , and ocean-dumping of sludge has been outlawed . But Easterbrook argues that the continuing &quot; institutional need on the part of the environmental movement to promote doomsday as a concept &quot; has led to continuing panic campaigns that often ignore &quot; observed facts of the natural world &quot; in favor of political goals that are not always rationally defensible . A doomsday scenario is &quot; a much better fund-raiser than guarded optimism , &quot; Easterbrook says . Even scientists are not immune to issuing doomsday scenarios . &quot; Often scientists hype and build_up their own findings ( to get ) . . . more funding , &quot; says Dr. Kenneth Olden , director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences . Too often , reporters uncritically accept what they ' re told by scientists . &quot; Science journalism is where political journalism was before Watergate , &quot; says Sharon Begley , a senior writer who covers science and the environment for Newsweek . &quot; We are still too in_awe_of our sources . . . . We succumb to the fallacy that an academic does not come_to an issue with the same biases or prejudices as someone whose salary is paid by &quot; a chemical company or an environmental group . &quot; Ideology can be as strong an influence as money , if not stronger , &quot; Begley says , and journalists are wrong to think scientists are purely objective , searching for &quot; Truth with a capital T . that ' s one of the most pernicious fallacies we as journalists can buy_into and our readers or viewers tend to be duped into. &quot; Moreover , the media often fail to accurately communicate to the public the inherent limitations on science , that science is just &quot; an approximation &quot; of reality at a given point_in_time , subject_to constant revision , says Dianne Dumanoski , a longtime environment writer for the Boston Globe who is now on_leave to write a book about the effect of artificial chemicals on fetal development . With scientists being increasingly called_upon to make policy recommendations these days , the line between pure science and political advocacy can be blurred , as U.S. News &amp; World Report pointed_out in December in a lengthy story debunking several doomsday myths about environmental hazards . A few other news organizations -- including ABC News , the New York Times and the New Republic -- have carried similar stories in recent years , and other publications -- the Washington Post , Science magazine , the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune among them -- have also published stories critically examining the conjunction of science and risk in society . Fumento examined the issue at considerable and provocative length in his 1993 book &quot; Science Under Siege. &quot; But these are isolated examples . Risk is &quot; a very hard subject_to cover well , and by and large , I don ' t think we do cover it terribly well , &quot; says Nicholas Wade , science and health editor of the New York Times . Journalists face many problems in trying to cover risk issues , and -- like Pogo in the old Walt Kelly comic_strip -- they often find that &quot; the enemy is us. &quot; In earlier years , journalists were often faulted for ignoring risks , especially in the work place ; now they ' re faulted for overstating risks . But risk issues are among the most complex to cover . They often involve not just science and medicine but politics and economics as well . Although some major news organizations have trained , experienced specialists covering risk areas , most do not . In a survey last year of 512 print and broadcast journalists nationwide , 72 % told the Los Angeles-based Foundation for American Communications that , in_general , reporters lack the training and background necessary to properly cover stories on technical environmental issues . Social_scientists Eleanor Singer and Phyllis Endreny , in their 1993 book &quot; Reporting on Risk , &quot; examined 42 news_stories on risk and found that 76 % had two or more errors . Because risk issues are often so technical and so complicated , even experienced reporters with specialized training may oversimplify issues -- unintentionally , while hurtling from deadline to deadline , or even intentionally , if only to have an impact on their first readers : their editors . &quot; Editors like conflict , drama , strong views , &quot; say Jim Detjen of the Philadelphia Inquirer , president of the Society for Environmental Journalists . &quot; Very often , many journalists know that to get a story on the front page or to get their editors interested in giving them time to pursue a story , &quot; they have to overplay those components . When an editor ' s desire for a strong story combines with a reporter ' s desire to be_on Page 1 , the result is not a pretty sight . Dumanoski of the Boston Globe recalls &quot; a big argument with a top editor at the Globe , on deadline &quot; about a story in which a Harvard_University scientist said there was &quot; a very high probability &quot; of a large hole in the ozone_layer in the Northern_Hemisphere before the end of the century . Dumanoski says her editor told her the story would be worthy of Page 1 only if the scientist said there definitely would be a large hole ; &quot; high probability &quot; wasn ' t good_enough to warrant Page 1 . Dumanoski thought the story was important and warranted Page 1 . She called the scientist back and &quot; negotiated something that really wasn ' t accurate . . . something much balder than what was true , &quot; as she puts it now . The story ran_on Page 1 . In an effort to simplify complicated issues for readers , as well as for their editors , reporters often over simplify in other ways , allowing qualifying and delimiting statements of scientists to &quot; fall by the wayside &quot; amid overstated conclusions , says Boyce Rensberger , longtime science writer for the Washington Post . Worse , reporters too often fail to put a given risk in context . Suppose some new substance is said to have a one in 600 # 000 chance of giving someone cancer . The government might well ban such a substance . But given that one out of three Americans will be found to have some kind of cancer in their lifetime , shouldn ' t the media make_it clear that this additional risk is actually relatively slight ? Too often , the media fail to give readers and viewers that context . Nor do they point_out that dire warnings in the past ( about cranberries and sacharine , for example ) have often proved needlessly alarmist -- and that science moves slowly toward any conclusions . &quot; I try to put numbers and risk in perspective every time I write a story , &quot; says Cristine Russell , a special health correspondent for the Washington Post , who spent a year studying risk while on an Alicia Patterson Foundation fellowship . &quot; I try to find just the right modifiers and emphasize when the data are preliminary or uncertain , whether the source is highly reputable or new , whether it ' s a large or small study , how long it will take_for more research to come_up with more definitive answers. &quot; Walt Bogdanich , a former Wall_Street Journal reporter who works for ABC News , says most good reporters try to do what Russell suggests . The mistakes they make , he says , are &quot; the inherent failings of the first rough draft of history , &quot; as Philip Graham , then the publisher of the Washington Post , once described the daily newspaper . &quot; I don ' t think health and science reporters are any different than other reporters , &quot; says Bogdanich , who has reported often on scientific and medical issues . &quot; We tend to go_for the quick hit , the headlines , the news value as we see it . . . and we end_up by failing to put_in context . We end_up exaggerating events . I ' m troubled by it and always have been. &quot; But Bogdanich says reporters fail to put risks in perspective , &quot; not necessarily because we ' re bad people or we ' re unintelligent people or uncaring people but because of time constraints and the pressures of what we do for a living . . . . We react too quickly , without thinking , in some cases. &quot; Baruch Fischhoff , a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University and a frequent defender of the media , says , however , that media coverage of risk is &quot; not always up_to the standards found in other topic areas. &quot; &quot; Most news organizations would not tolerate sports or business reporting by reporters who do not understand the subject , &quot; he told Victor Cohn of the Washington Post for his book &quot; Reporting on Risk. &quot; &quot; The same is not always true of . . . the technical and social dimensions of risk messages. &quot; Scientists say too many journalists who cover risk issues , in their zeal to beat the competition -- and to provide the drama of conflict and what they see as the fairness of balance -- often sacrifice context and perspective by going_for predictable , controversial quotes from extremist sources . Journalists want to &quot; bracket the truth with experts or participants on either side &quot; of any controversy , says Rob Stavins , who teaches environmental economics and public policy at Harvard . &quot; The natural tendency , if you want to make_sure that the truth lies somewhere within the range of what you ' ve got , is to make those brackets as far apart as possible . My opinion is that ' s one of the motivations , in addition to the drama motivation , for most often quoting and relying_upon what I call the ' flamethrowers ' on either side of the spectrum. &quot; Journalists would probably serve their readers better , Stavins says , if they narrowed that range considerably , focusing_on opinions from the responsible middle and eliminating the extremes . But even in the middle , there ' s almost invariably more_than one opinion , and reporters are trained to present both sides . On risk issues , that presents a problem . &quot; The journalist ' s model of the world ( is ) that there are the good_guys and the bad_guys and there ' s two sides to everything , &quot; says Clarence ( Terry ) Davies , director of the Center for Risk Management at Resources for the Future , a Washington think_tank that specializes in environmental issues . &quot; that ' s pretty distorting in terms of a lot of environmental stories , I think . There aren ' t two sides to most environmental stories ; there ' s usually seven sides or 15 sides . . . . Sometimes there ' s only one side. &quot; The latter point is one Larry Stammer of the Los Angeles Times finds particularly unsettling . &quot; We don ' t have the expertise to say that their science is wrong or someone else ' s science is right , &quot; says Stammer , a former environment reporter and political writer who now writes_about religion . &quot; So . . . what papers tend to do is give equal play to both . . . sides , even though one side doesn ' t have a whole_lot of credibility . Using the political model , we do a ' he said , she said ' story. &quot; John Kenney , chairman of the commission that investigated the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island , had experience with this syndrome , and as a result , he said he expected some day to read a newspaper story that began : &quot; Three scientists by the names of Galileo , Newton and Einstein have concluded that the Earth is round . However , the New York Times has learned authoritatively that professor John_Doe has exclusive evidence that the Earth is flat. &quot; Perhaps the biggest -- and most inevitable -- flaw in media coverage of risk is the tendency for bad news to drive_out good news . Risk -- hazard -- is , by definition , bad news . Robert Samuelson , in Newsweek , and Richard Harwood , in the Washington Post , have recently criticized this tendency of the news media to be compulsive bad news bearers , especially in their coverage of risk . Harwood ticked_off several examples of &quot; good news &quot; about risk , then said : &quot; There ' s plenty to cheer about out there . We just don ' t print much of it . It ' s neither culturally nor commercially correct in the news business. &quot; Thus , when the Center for Science in the Public Interest issued periodic reports over the last year saying that Italian food , Chinese food , Mexican food and movie_theater popcorn are unhealthy , their findings made Page 1 headlines and television_news programs . Media coverage of the popcorn story was especially heavy . &quot; You got the impression from the wildly excited press coverage that after a movie ends the ushers have to use forklifts to clear the bloated corpses out of the theater , &quot; wrote syndicated columnist Dave Barry . But on June 27 -- two months after the popcorn report , three weeks before the assault on chili rellenos -- the center announced that it wanted consumers to know that &quot; there ' s also good news in the world of food and nutrition. &quot; The center released a report on &quot; Top 10 Foods for Healthy Summer Fun &quot; -- brand-name lists for everything from frozen_yogurt to fat-free tortilla_chips . A search of databases shows that not one major television_news program , not one major magazine and only one major newspaper used the story . That paper , the Dallas Morning News , gave it two paragraphs at the bottom of a health roundup on Page 3 of its third section . Jacci Cenacveira of the Times editorial library assisted with the research for this series . The Cancer Threat What scientists say are the most likely causes of cancer in humans do not necessarily end_up on the evening newscast or in the morning paper . Here is a look_at cancer from two viewpoints : The Scientific Perspective Percentage of scientists who say the following cause cancer : Smoking tobacco : 96 % Sunlight : 54 % Diet : 52 % Secondhand smoke : 42 % Chemicals in the workplace : 37 % Sexually transmitted diseases : 28 % Pesticides and herbicides : 26 % Air and water_pollution : 26 % Infectious_diseases : 14 % Drugs : 13 % Food_additives , preservatives : 10 % Medical radiation : 10 % Chemicals at_home : 7 % Nuclear power : 7 % NOTE : The survey was done with 401 randomly selected current members of the American Assn . for Cancer Research . * * * The Media Blitz The number of times the following cancer causes were referred to in news_stories , 1972-1992 : Man-made chemicals : 498 Tobacco : 292 Food_additives : 273 Heredity : 272 Drugs : 268 Pollution : 222 Man-made radiation : 212 Infection : 200 Pesticides : 194 Asbestos : 163 NOTE : News organizations surveyed included ABC , CBS and NBC evening newscasts ; Time , Newsweek , U.S. News and World Report , New York Times , Washington Post and Wall_Street Journal .
