   <HEADLINE> U.S. EXPELS RUSSIAN OVER SPY SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration on Friday expelled Russia ' s reputed espionage station chief , who officials said has worked here under diplomatic cover as a counselor in the Russian Embassy . President Clinton ordered the expulsion of Aleksandr Iosifovich Lysenko -- described by U.S. officials as the &quot; resident , &quot; or chief intelligence_officer -- at the Russian Embassy after Russia failed to withdraw him voluntarily . Administration officials had demanded his withdrawal after the arrest of CIA officer Aldrich H . Ames on charges of having been a Kremlin double_agent . U.S. officials said they continue to hope that the Russians would voluntarily take other actions the Administration had insisted upon , including reducing the total number of intelligence_agents in the United States and publicly identifying others . They suggested that further moves might be taken if the Russians declined . &quot; We do not rule_out taking additional action against any other Russian diplomats who are subsequently implicated in the Ames affair , &quot; State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said . The Russian government formally protested the action , issuing a statement complaining that there are &quot; circles both in the United States and in Russia that are not interested in the friendship of the two major powers. &quot; &quot; We are against the attempts by special ( intelligence ) services to drag political_leaders of the countries into their own mutual relations , &quot; the statement said . The expulsion came only hours after Clinton , at a press_conference , vowed that the United States would act &quot; soon &quot; if Russia did not take &quot; appropriate action &quot; in the Ames case . At the same time , Clinton appealed_to Congress not to torpedo the Administration ' s plans for financial_aid to Russia . In a morning meeting at the White_House , congressional leaders warned Clinton that aid requests for Russia are in danger because of the spying incident . &quot; There were at least two of us in the room of each party who indicated that Russian aid , at least as it is currently constructed , is in some trouble , &quot; Sen . Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) said afterward . In his press_conference , Clinton acknowledged the complaints from lawmakers and said he &quot; urged them to resist calls to reduce or suspend our assistance for reform in Russia. &quot; &quot; Support of the United States for reform in Russia does not flow_from a sense of charity or blind faith , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; Our policy is based on our clear American interests clearly pursued. &quot; Much of the U.S. money goes_to help dismantle nuclear_weapons that the former Soviet_Union once aimed at the United States , he noted . Most of the rest , he said , goes not to the Russian government but to groups trying to put_together private enterprises in the country . The U.S._government has long known that a certain number of Russians in the United States as diplomats are , in fact , spies working under cover . The government tolerates their presence up_to a point because the CIA uses the same sort of diplomatic cover in its overseas operations . When spy cases become public , as the Ames case did this week , expulsions generally follow . Expelling Lysenko -- declaring him persona_non_grata in formal diplomatic parlance -- was in some ways an unusually harsh sanction . In most past spy cases , the United States has expelled lower-ranking agents rather than the resident himself . At the same time , the United States softened the blow by not expelling others and by giving Lysenko seven days to depart , rather than the 48-hour Cold_War standard . The expulsions were the first since 1986 when , in a massive operation , the Ronald Reagan_Administration kicked 80 Soviet officials out of the country -- a move that set_off a retaliatory war of diplomatic expulsions that lasted for several months . &quot; It was a much different time , &quot; McCurry said , referring to that case . &quot; That was the time of the adversarial relationship we had with the then-Soviet Union in the Cold_War . This is a much different era , I think , as you all know. &quot; McCurry said the Administration chose to expel Lysenko , who apparently has only held the resident post for a_few months , because he was &quot; in a position to be responsible_for the activities associated with the Ames espionage case. &quot; Earlier in the week , U.S. officials had privately demanded that the Russians make a voluntary act of contrition . But as the Russians dragged their feet on that request , Clinton began to come under heavy fire from Congress . &quot; This is not the time to negotiate , &quot; Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) said Friday before the expulsion was ordered . &quot; When people are caught with their hands in the cookie_jar , then they ought to be expelled. &quot; Asked about Nunn ' s comments , Clinton denied the United States had been &quot; negotiating &quot; with the Russians , saying that his Administration had told Russian officials what it expected and had given them a set amount_of_time in which to act . The President also downplayed suggestions in some news_reports that federal investigators believe a second double_agent may have been involved in the Ames case . &quot; Sometimes it happens that when you ' re in a criminal investigation and you ' re onto something , the investigation turns_up information that could not have been anticipated at the beginning , &quot; Clinton said . But , he quickly added , &quot; I ' m not trying to raise some tantalizing inference , I ' m just saying that we have to keep going and try to root it out. &quot; Times staff writer Ronald J . Ostrow contributed to this story .</TEXT>
