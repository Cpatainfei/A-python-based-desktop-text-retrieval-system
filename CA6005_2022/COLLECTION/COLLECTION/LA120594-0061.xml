   <HEADLINE> STREET SMART / RICHARD SIMON : YOU CAN FILL UP IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE AT NEW BREED OF SERVICE_STATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Regular , ethyl or cafe latte ? At Charles Khalil ' s gas_station , you can now sit_down at a table and sip cappuccino while filling your tank . It ' s on Los Angeles ' Westside , naturally , offering not merely premium coffee but gourmet cheese , fine wine , fresh flowers and holiday gift baskets . Khalil is not the only gas dealer to trade_in his grease rack for a $ 15 # 000 espresso machine . Gas dealers throughout Southern California -- who once relied_on Blue_Chip stamps , free glassware and other giveaways to attract business -- are finding new ways to appeal_to customers ' tastes . At a Unocal station at the Grapevine , customers can order a Nathan ' s Famous hot dog over a &quot; talking pump. &quot; The economic benefits of trying to refuel humans , not just machines , are clear : 16 % of restaurant meals sold in the United States are ordered from automobiles ; 10 % are eaten_in the car , according to a Chicago-area marketing firm , NPD Crest , which tracks the consumer habits of 13 # 000 households . It is not clear whether the automobile is moving or stopped when the meal is being eaten . that ' s why car_makers added cup holders . And consider this new product arriving just in time for Christmas : a bib for commuters . It absorbs spills and contains a wide pocket to catch crumbs . ( Rolls-Royces have trays for back-seat passengers , but no one has yet proposed trays in front. ) Of course , gas_stations for years have sold items such_as cigarettes , chewing gum and soda_pop . But sales of food and other specialty items gained popularity only during the oil shortages of the 1970s . Stations underwent a transformation , from places where a friendly attendant would pump your gas , clean your windshield , check your oil and give you Blue_Chip stamps to a place where you pay first to a stone-faced attendant behind a high-security window and then serve yourself . Perhaps speculating that energy-conscious drivers would want to avoid buying gas and then driving elsewhere for food and groceries , Arco opened its first AM / PM Mini Market in 1975 at the corner of Brookhurst Street and Trask Avenue in Garden Grove . It ' s still there ( though no one has proposed that it be declared a landmark like Brentwood ' s famous Spanish Colonial-style gas_station ) , and these days Arco rakes_in about $ 500 million a year from sales of items in nearly 900 AM / PM Mini Market in five Western states . &quot; We don ' t open stores now that have just gasoline , &quot; said Arco spokesman Al Greenstein . &quot; It is simply not as profitable. &quot; &quot; Anything and everything that is a convenience to the consumer is being tried , &quot; said Trilby Lundberg , publisher of the Los Angeles-based Lundberg Letter , which tracks petroleum and consumer trends . One new trend is fast-food restaurants at gas_stations . Rally ' s hamburgers are slung at a Unocal in Lakewood . Dunkin Donuts are sold_out of a Mobil in Brentwood . And at a Texaco in Carson -- across the street , ironically , from the Arco refinery -- customers can buy a Subway sandwich or a Taco Bell burrito , withdraw cash from an ATM , shop for groceries . . . oh , yes , and fill their tank . The idea of selling cappuccino at a gas_station began in the Pacific Northwest , according to industry officials . &quot; It ' s fairly big up there , and it ' s just now coming_down here in Southern California , &quot; said Ron Sharp , merchandising specialist for Chevron USA Products Co . Indeed , cappuccino carts have shown_up at some stations in Riverside and San Diego counties . But few gas dealers have gone as far as Khalil , whose Mobil station is at Olympic and Westwood boulevards . Khalil said he got the do-it-yourself cappuccino machine because he wanted to improve the gasoline buying experience -- and maximize his bottom_line . &quot; I can see the trend , &quot; said Khalil , a Lebanese immigrant who admittedly doesn ' t know how to change a tire . &quot; When you think_of a gas_station , the first thing you think_of probably is the smell . Gas stinks , &quot; he noted . But now , the smell of brewing coffee wafts through the air . &quot; I want to create something that truly fits the neighborhood. &quot; A cup of cappuccino or cafe latte sells for $ 1.50. A single espresso is 99 cents . But don ' t stop at the cappuccino machine , said Khalil , who invites visitors to see the bathroom . It is decorated Grecian style with imitation marble tile and plaster columns and automated sensors that activate the sink and toilet . Khalil ' s wife , Kaaren , said the couple is contemplating a &quot; cut-through &quot; window where the magazine_rack is now , installing a deli there so you can yell out your sandwich selection from the pump and get_it after your fill-up . Unocal is testing a TV screen on gas_pumps at a station in Saugus . The talking screen instructs customers how to use the pump , but also plays commercials -- without , they insist , subliminal advertising . So far , however , there have been no reports of Southern California gas_station owners imitating their British counterparts . In some British stations , motorists are treated to a free five-minute massage of the head , shoulders and hands aimed at &quot; alleviating stress and combatting road rage among drivers. &quot; British officials point_out that road rage was first identified in America .</TEXT>
