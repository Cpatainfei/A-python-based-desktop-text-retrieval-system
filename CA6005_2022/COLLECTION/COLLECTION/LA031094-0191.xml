   <HEADLINE> HEBRON GUNMAN CARRIED CONFESSION , PANEL IS TOLD ; MASSACRE : COMMISSION ASKS TO SEE LETTER ARMY_OFFICER SAYS WAS IN KILLER ' S BAG . POSSIBILITY OF COVER-UP IS RAISED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Israeli settler who massacred about 30 Palestinians as they prayed here in a mosque two weeks ago brought with him , in the same bag with his extra ammunition , a confession explaining his motives , the army_officer on_duty at the site said Wednesday . Second Lt . Rotem Ravivi told a special commission investigating the Feb . 25 attack that he found &quot; a letter of confession &quot; in Dr. Baruch Goldstein ' s purple flight bag after worshipers had overpowered the killer and beaten him to death . Although two letters from Goldstein to city officials and other physicians in Kiryat Arba , the settlement where he lived and worked , had obliquely hinted at his plans and had been released quickly , the confession found at the Cave of the Patriarchs here had never been disclosed , though a confidential army report referred to it . Chief_Justice Meir Shamgar , commission chairman , called_upon the army to produce the confession when the commission resumes its hearings in Jerusalem today . Disclosure of the confession and other information that emerged in the panel ' s daylong inspection of the shrine here raised anew the possibility of an attempted cover-up by the Israeli military . Based on the army investigation , Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and other Israeli leaders have described Goldstein as &quot; crazy , &quot; &quot; a lunatic &quot; and &quot; one man acting alone , &quot; rather than a member of an underground group of Jewish extremists determined to upset peace negotiations with the Palestinians and thus prevent Israel ' s withdrawal from the West_Bank . But even early testimony by witnesses has indicated that Goldstein acted with premeditation , careful planning -- and perhaps not alone . Palestinian leaders have already suggested that Israeli soldiers , or perhaps other settlers in uniform , may also have been part of the attack . According to soldiers on_duty that Friday , Goldstein was driven to the shrine by an unidentified man before dawn . He was dressed in a uniform and carried seven magazines of ammunition for his assault_rifle -- a full load for foot_soldiers in the troubled West_Bank but an extraordinary amount for an army doctor . Around his neck he wore the type of ear protectors used on firing_ranges . Questions also arose Wednesday about how Goldstein managed to slip around Ravivi into the Muslim side of the shrine , whether Goldstein had entered through another door that had been left unlocked and how Goldstein left the flight bag in a hall where 13 Jewish men were praying without any seeing him . And why , local Muslim leaders asked the commission , did the Israeli military_governor of Hebron order the mosque cleansed of blood -- and perhaps much physical evidence -- with high-powered fire_hoses just before the commission began its investigation ? They had asked , they said , that everything be left as it was to allow a full , independent inquiry . Guarded by hundreds of soldiers , the commission inspected the Ibrahim Mosque at the Cave of the Patriarchs and other sites in Hebron for seven hours Wednesday , retracing Goldstein ' s path , step by step , through the murder at the shrine , then following the spread of riots through the city . Since the massacre , the public has been barred from the Cave of the Patriarchs , a shrine holy to Jews and Muslims as the traditional burial place of such biblical figures as Abraham , Sarah , Isaac and Jacob . Soldiers from half_a_dozen different Israeli divisions , along with paramilitary border troops and police , were stationed on roofs and in the streets near the 2 # 000-year-old Cave of the Patriarchs and throughout central Hebron . Streets were deserted because of an army-imposed curfew that has kept the city ' s 70 # 000 Palestinians at_home since the massacre . About 100 journalists were allowed_in the shrine but barred from Isaac ' s Hall , where the massacre occurred . Accounts of the visit and testimony were provided later by the Israeli news_agency Itim , the Government Press Office and the Justice Ministry . Ravivi told the commission that he saw Goldstein enter the door to Abraham Hall , where Jews pray , and from which it is possible to enter Isaac Hall , where Muslims pray . Ravivi did not keep his eyes on Goldstein and so could not say how he entered Isaac Hall . When he heard shooting , Ravivi continued , he tried to enter Isaac Hall but was blocked , finding two doors locked and the third filled with a crush of people trying to escape the firing . It took three minutes from the start of shooting until the incident was over . Palestinians living adjacent to the shrine , some of whom had been praying there at the time of the massacre , came_out of their houses to offer versions of events that conflicted sharply with that provided by the Israeli military . &quot; More_than 50 were killed -- we saw their bodies , we went_to their funerals , &quot; one woman said . A neighbor added : &quot; It was not Goldstein alone -- we saw the soldiers shooting too. &quot; The army investigation put the number of people killed by Goldstein in the mosque at 29 . Three more were trampled to death in the effort to flee , the army found , and five were killed by soldiers in the ensuing riots . The Palestine Human_Rights Information Center put the deaths at 48 at the mosque and five later in the city . &quot; We doubt that this commission is interested in the truth , &quot; said Zleikha Muhtaseb , 30 , a teacher . &quot; They are Jews , and Jews will never do any harm to their people . Still , I will testify about what I saw that day because the truth requires it . Let ' s see if they listen. &quot; Muhtaseb , who was in the adjacent chapel for Muslim women when Goldstein started shooting , said she saw from the doorway at least four soldiers shooting Palestinians in Isaac Hall . The Israeli army has said all 110 cartridges it found in the mosque came from Goldstein ' s rifle . Local Muslim leaders promised Shamgar that Hebron residents who were at the Cave of the Patriarchs or around it on the day of the massacre will testify during the investigation . At the commission ' s opening hearing Tuesday , Maj . Gen . Danny Yatom , acting commander of Israeli forces throughout central Israel and the West_Bank , testified that , had the full_complement of soldiers and police been present in the Cave of the Patriarchs that morning , Goldstein ' s attack could have been prevented or quickly halted . But five men were missing -- three overslept , one had been reassigned and one rarely came . &quot; Due_to a severe breach in discipline , or for some_other reason not yet known , the ( shrine ) was , in_effect , abandoned at a most critical moment , &quot; Zeev Schiff , Israel ' s leading military commentator , wrote Wednesday in the influential newspaper Haaretz . &quot; This fact will undoubtedly add_to the wave of rumors among the Arabs according to which Goldstein did not act alone and that there may have been a conspiracy to carry_out the deed. &quot;</TEXT>
