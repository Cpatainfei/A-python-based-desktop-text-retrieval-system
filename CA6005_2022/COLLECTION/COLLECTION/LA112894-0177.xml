   <HEADLINE> PROJECTIONS : SANGUINETTI TO LEAD URUGUAY ; SOUTH_AMERICA : THE FORMER PRESIDENT WINS CLOSE VOTE . ELECTION IS FIRST IN WHICH THIRD GROUP HAS SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED TWO TRADITIONAL PARTIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti won the presidential election in a close , three-way contest Sunday , according to projections based on incomplete official returns . Sanguinetti , 58 , and his traditional Colorado Party defeated the governing National , or Blanco ( White ) , Party and the leftist Broad Front coalition , the polling firm Cifras declared . Its projections gave the Colorados 33.5 % of the vote against 31 % for the Blancos and 30 % for the Broad Front and its allies , who ran as the Progressive Encounter . In declaring Sanguinetti the winner early today , Cifras said the trend was &quot; irreversible. &quot; Projections by another firm , Equipos Consultores , confirmed Sanguinetti ' s victory . Sanguinetti will take_office March 1 , five years after ending his first term . The veteran political insider previously served as a congressman , minister of industry and commerce and minister of education and culture . He will succeed President Luis Alberto Lacalle of the Blanco Party . During the campaign , Sanguinetti portrayed himself as a social democrat . He criticized Lacalle for rushing into the Mercosur free-trade agreement with neighboring South_American_countries without adequately preparing Uruguay for foreign competition . &quot; Today we are all workers in the foundry of Uruguayan democracy , &quot; Sanguinetti said in a short victory speech to cheering supporters . &quot; I simply say I assume this responsibility understanding that I must be the first in effort. &quot; A total of 20 presidential candidates ran . Sanguinetti ' s closest rivals were lawyer Alberto Volonte and former Interior Minister Juan Andres Ramirez of the governing National Party , and Socialist_Party physician Tabare Vazquez of the Broad Front coalition . The race marked the first time that a third political force has seriously challenged the Colorado and Blanco parties , which have dominated Uruguayan politics for 158 years . The Broad Front coalition includes Vazquez ' s Socialist_Party , the Communist_Party and former Tupamaro guerrillas . In 1973 , when Tupamaro violence shook Uruguay ' s political foundations , the armed forces shut_down the Congress and imposed a harshly repressive regime . Sanguinetti , elected in 1984 , was the first civilian president after military rule . Sanguinetti ' s Colorado Party lost power in 1989 elections , and Lacalle took_office in March , 1990 . The constitution bars presidents from running_for successive terms . The Broad Front won 21 % of the vote_in 1989 , nearly 18 percentage_points behind the winning Blancos . Analysts attribute the growth of the Broad Front partly to Vazquez ' s popularity in Montevideo , where he was mayor until July . Voters also have grown impatient with Uruguay ' s slow economic recovery under Colorado and Blanco administrations after decades of stagnation and decline , the analysts say . Many young Uruguayans , less steeped in the two-party system than their parents , voted for the third force . Washington Aguirre , 19 , said he voted for the Broad Front because he wants to try something different from the Colorado and Blanco administrations he has seen . &quot; I didn ' t like them , &quot; Aguirre said . &quot; It ' s always the same , always traditional . They don ' t change things. &quot; Sunday ' s balloting was also for mayors and members of Congress . The next president will face the challenge of getting legislation through a Congress in which an array of opposition parties will hold an overwhelming majority . Another challenge for the five-year administration will be adjusting Uruguay ' s small economy to Mercosur , which eliminates import tariffs beginning Jan . 1 among Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay and Uruguay . The market of 200 million people offers new opportunities for Uruguayan industry and agriculture but also opens them up_to competition from stronger and more advanced producers . The Uruguayan constitution allows more_than one presidential candidate from each party , and each party ' s first-place candidate gets all his party ' s votes . The Colorado Party had four presidential candidates ; the Blanco Party , three ; and the Broad Front , one .</TEXT>
