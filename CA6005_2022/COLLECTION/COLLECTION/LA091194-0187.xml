   <HEADLINE> SHOPPING : GREAT_BRITAIN ; IN STAFFORDSHIRE , HOME OF WEDGWOOD AND SPODE , THE VILLAGES OF STOKE-ON- TRENT SELL SOME OF THE BEST CERAMICS AT BARGAIN PRICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Looking_for the quintessential English gift to take_home ; something classy , classic and history laced ? After living_in London for several years , I was in the same position . Having exhausted the usual tea-related gifts , I was searching for something new for the holidays . The obvious solution : a trip to Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire . Stoke-on-Trent is the center of the Staffordshire pottery-making industry that produces almost all_of Britain ' s world-famous ceramics . A visit there last fall provided not just a shopping experience , but an introduction to some of England ' s finest pottery . It was in Stoke-on-Trent , during the mid-18th Century , that Josiah Wedgwood created the process for a new form of cream-colored earthenware that replaced expensive porcelain and black pottery as the first light-colored ceramics affordable to the_English middle_class . Prior to that , porcelain -- which was developed by the Chinese and , centuries later , mastered by the Germans -- had been available but at prices so high that only the wealthy could afford it . The Staffordshire area was also home to other pioneers in the pottery industry , including Josiah Spode , who is credited with creating bone_china ( porcelain made with bone ) in about 1799 . And so it is that in Stoke-on-Trent almost all forms of ceramics -- including porcelain , earthenware , bone_china and fine china -- were either created , perfected or amplified , and are manufactured and sold today in varying forms . The county of Staffordshire is rich with industrial heritage and little has changed in its villages for hundreds of years . Filled with Victorian_architecture and surrounded by beautiful countryside , each of its towns has a distinct identity and character , yet all share one common theme : pottery . The potteries are contained within six different villages that are incorporated into the town of Stoke-on-Trent , along the River Trent . The villages of Burslem , Stoke , Hanley , Fenton , Longton and Barlaston are about a 3 1 / 2-hour drive northwest of London , or a two-hour ride by train . Taking the train is a viable option for travelers since threading through each village is China Link , a privately owned bus_service that picks_up travelers at the Stoke Railway_Station , tours many of the china attractions and allows visitors to stop , shop and board the next bus when they wish . Buses run from village to village , manufacturer to manufacturer during business hours , Monday through Saturday , except on holidays . Tickets cost about $ 6.50 for a day pass and can be purchased on the buses . The potteries of Stoke-on-Trent offer great bargains . Although individual shops vary greatly , most sell items 30 % to 50 % less than retail shops in London and are stocked with patterns and styles not seen in the United States . The shops contain everything from perfect-quality china to end-of-the-line close-outs to discontinued lines and seconds ( imperfect pieces ) . Although discounts on perfect items are slight , excellent bargains can be found among discontinued lines and seconds . To search the shops is to take a lesson in history , as well as in design . The factories don ' t look impressive . They are mostly block-long brick buildings with , perhaps , a glass-fronted factory showroom . I noticed the characteristic brick bottle-shaped ovens at many , although most kilns are now fired by gas and electricity and the ovens are slowly disappearing . Some of the factories have showrooms , brightly lit and neat ; others seem less professional , more factory-like and are set_up so that visitors need to rummage for treasures . We liked those the best . Most conduct their own tours , demonstrating working methods and skills , and usually they take about two hours . This means that a day is really not enough time to visit all_of the factories , museums and visitor centers , although we made_it work as a shopping expedition . Were I to do_it again , however , I would plan two or three days to explore the manufacturers , learn about the craft and shop_at leisure . A friend and I loaded_up the car with a nice picnic lunch and embarked_on a great shopping experience . * Following an early morning drive along easily navigated highways surrounded by farms , villages and tree-studded countryside , we arrived_at our first stop , Burslem , birthplace of Josiah Wedgwood and -- on site of his first factory -- one of the first successful pottery towns . On Sandbach Road , east of the city_center , we found Moorcroft Potters . Well-known among aficionados for its method of production and hand-painting , which involves putting the decoration on before the first firing , the pottery is still a family_business . Moorcroft produces a special powder-blue china and the shop sells a variety of items including handmade pottery , bowls and plates that are all quite beautiful . Not far from the center of Burslem , around the corner on Nile Street , is one of the many Royal Doulton pottery factories . Royal Doulton carries more_than 30 # 000 individual items and manufactures such lines as Minton , Royal Crown Derby and Royal Albert . The Royal Doulton shop sells Royal Doulton figures , character jugs ( mugs with a character ' s face incorporated into the design ) , dinner and tea_services , gift ware and child-size china called nursery ware . We were interested in several pieces of Bunnykins nursery ware . Designed by a nun 60 years ago , the china is decorated with rabbits and delightful country nursery scenes . The baby set , which included a baby plate and two-handle mug , was priced at about $ 30 for perfect quality . Next we drove to Stoke , about 20 minutes southeast , to visit Minton -- one of the most famous potteries in all_of England . Described by Britain ' s Queen Victoria as &quot; makers of the world ' s most beautiful china , &quot; the Minton factory on London Road sells bone_china dinner and tea_services , including perfect pieces and seconds . Visitors can also order perfect-quality items for shipment home , including limited_editions of selected Minton Bicentenary commemorative pieces . A perfect-quality , five-piece place setting of Dutch Blue Delft china was about $ 95 . * On Church Street , Spode Potteries sells slightly imperfect and best-quality fine bone_china , stone china and imperial earthenware . Also available was boxed gift ware and a wide range of their famous Christmas_Tree pattern : gold-edged pottery with decorated Christmas_trees ornamenting each piece . We traveled_to Hanley to find Mason ' s Ironstone , Land of Legend and Aynsley China potteries , as well as the Potteries Shopping Centre , which houses several of the city ' s famous potteries under one roof . At the Aynsley China shop I found a perfect-quality five-piece place setting of Moselle china , delicately edged_in a scallop pattern for about $ 100 . At Mason ' s Ironstone , near the center of town , I was quickly attracted to the Blue Denmark China , which is reminiscent_of the Blue Dutch Delft . A perfect-quality , five-piece place setting was about $ 25 and seconds were 40 % less . But it was the Potteries Shopping Centre in Hanley that was our favorite stop for fast finds . Visitors can purchase brand-name china , gift ware , crystal and porcelain , including Royal Doulton , Spode and Royal Worcester at reduced prices . The center is ideal if you are_on a tight schedule , although selections are more limited than at individual factories . On Litchfield Street in Hanley is Coalport Pottery , a division of Wedgwood . Coalport ' s fine bone_china vases , flowers , earrings , figurines and tableware are known for exquisite hand-painted , lightly decorated floral designs . The gift_shop also has a selection of seconds , including Wedgwood crystal and tableware at reduced prices . One of my favorite figurines was eight-inch-tall , auburn-haired Bridget , who is demurely elegant in her periwinkle-blue gown for about $ 145 . Southeast of the village of Longton ' s town center , on Normacot Road , is Portmeirion Potteries Ltd . A favorite of many china collectors , Portmeirion is_best known for earthenware and durable white stoneware turned_out as colorfully decorated wildlife and plants . The factory store sells seconds on boldly and colorfully drawn oven-to-tableware in famous patterns of botanical_gardens , birds of Britain and summer strawberries . Staffordshire Enamels on Weston Coyney Road in Longton had already produced its Christmas collection when I was there . I liked the limited_edition enameled Christmas_box decorated with a scene inspired by &quot; nine drummers drumming , &quot; from the Christmas song , &quot; The Twelve Days of Christmas. &quot; It sold for about $ 100 . The village of Longton also has many other small potteries , with names known to china collectors including Amber China Ltd. , Birchcroft Fine Bone_China , John Beswick and Royal Grafton . About six miles south of Stoke is Barlaston , which was to be the last village on our tour . It was there that we visited the Wedgwood Visitor Center , which can be found by following brown signs decorated with a Portland vase logo posted on main_streets around town . Queen Charlotte , wife of George_III , was fond of Wedgwood pottery . As a result , Wedgwood ' s design became widely recognized as Queen ' s ware . Wedgwood is equally well-known for its nursery ware , Mason ' s ironstone , crystal and fine bone_china . Also at Wedgwood , we saw one of their newest designs , Cantana , a fine china pattern that has bands of deep blue and gold edging its borders . Complementing pieces also feature a full border of the marbleized blue design . A best-quality teacup and saucer was about $ 30 . It was a long day as we loaded_up the car with great gift bargains -- including several pieces of Bunnykins nursery ware , a Royal Doulton picture plate , a set of Spode Christmas_tree china , a small Coalport porcelain figurine , a Staffordshire enamel keepsake box and a large Moselle platter for Thanksgiving turkey . We also bought a_few beautiful pieces for ourselves , including Wedgwood trinket boxes , a pale blue Wedgwood Jasper cameo pin , dessert dishes and Minton bone_china tea_sets and headed back to London . . . grateful that we didn ' t have to carry our purchases onto an airplane .
