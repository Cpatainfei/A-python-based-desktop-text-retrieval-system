   <TEXT> An unstable mass of air trailing Thursday ' s chilly storm dropped scattered rain , hail and snow on Southern California on Friday evening , and forecasters said a new storm should bring more precipitation tonight and Sunday . Despite briefly heavy rain in a number of areas Friday , there were no reports of new mudslides on the hillsides that were denuded during last fall ' s destructive brush_fires in Malibu , Altadena and Laguna Beach . There were some slides in Malibu on Thursday , but damage was generally light . Pea-size hail was reported during a blustery thundershower in Banning on Friday , and National Weather Service observers said their radar showed ice pellets in several cloudbursts . Officials said heavy snow fell Friday afternoon in Idyllwild , Wrightwood and Big Bear City , with as much as six inches piling_up in some areas by nightfall . Snow levels as low as 3 # 000 feet , with temperatures dropping into the 20s , were reported in some parts of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains Friday night . Police said driving conditions were hazardous in most mountain areas . No measurable rain had fallen at the Los Angeles Civic Center by 5 p.m. , the time at which each day ' s last measurements are reported . The 0.77 of an inch that fell there Thursday raised the total for the season -- which is measured from July 1 to June 30 -- to 4.41 inches , less than half the normal season ' s total for the date and about one-fifth of the 21.85 inches that had fallen by Feb . 18 last year .
