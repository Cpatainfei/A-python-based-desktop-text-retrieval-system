   <TEXT> Swedish midfielder Kennet Andersson , on his team ' s advance to the semifinals against Brazil : &quot; It ' s kind of a dream.I can ' t explain it in English . I don ' t think I can explain it in Swedish , either. &quot; But Sweden ' s Coach Tommy Svensson is , like most of his players , remarkably calm . Even as his team seemed to be_on the verge of elimination Sunday , he said he didn ' t get too excited . &quot; You keep hope sometimes and desperation other times , &quot; he said . &quot; When we were one goal down and lost a player , it seemed difficult. &quot; JULIE CART</TEXT>
