   <HEADLINE> OUT WITH THE OLD IN MEXICO AND BRAZIL ; REFORM : LATIN_AMERICA ' S LARGEST NATIONS SEEM SERIOUS ABOUT CUTTING TIES WITH THE PAST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The most important news in the Americas this month is not from the Miami summit but in Latin_America itself . Historic changes are occurring , especially in Brazil and Mexico , the region ' s largest nations . From both countries there is evidence that steps will finally be taken_to address key problems that have worsened in recent years : social and equity issues and problems of governance , justice and accountability . For while Latin_American economies have moved from authoritarian rule toward democratic politics , they have also been plagued by rampant corruption , violence , manipulation and disenchantment with democratic institutions . And although Latin_America ' s major economies have stabilized and begun to grow , most have also become even more unjust , with poverty deepening while the wealthy get richer on the basis of free-market reforms . Perhaps the most exciting breakthrough is occurring in Brazil , a country with a population and an economy as large as Russia ' s . After 10 years of disastrous political false starts and hyper-inflation , Brazil has in the past six months reduced inflation to less than 3 % a month and held exemplary national elections in which some 98 million Brazilians participated . The successful architect of the anti-inflation plan , Fernando Henrique Cardoso , won a decisive mandate by capturing 54 % of the vote_in an eight-candidate race . Cardoso , a sociologist whose writings are known by every student of Latin_American affairs , was exiled by Brazil ' s military regime in the 1960s and entered political life in the first legislative elections allowed by the military in 1978 . Since then , he has served with distinction in both houses of the legislature and as foreign and finance_minister . With demonstrated talent at coalition building , Cardoso promises to focus first on consolidating the victory over inflation by assuring fiscal balance , reforming the social_security system , and privatizing public enterprises ; to promote political reforms to make government more accountable and effective ; and to increase strategic investments in education , infrastructure and social_services . For the first time since the military coup of 1964 , Brazil seems poised to realize its enormous potential . A similar sense of historic opportunity can be felt in Mexico , where President Ernesto Zedillo stunned the country with the content and tone of his strong inaugural_address . Abandoning the usual technocratic recitation of economic indicators , Zedillo spoke forcefully on the issues that thoughtful Mexicans are most concerned about : achieving the rule_of_law and equal justice , fighting corruption and curbing political violence . While signaling continuity of the Salinas regime ' s economic_policies by naming members of the outgoing government to new posts , Zedillo broke_with the governing party ' s political approach by naming an opposition party leader to the sensitive post of attorney_general . Zedillo promised sweeping electoral reforms to separate the ruling party from government authority and also made tough statements on corruption , abuse of authority and accountability . Whether he can deliver on his bold promises remains to be seen , but he has staked his administration ' s reputation on political reform .</TEXT>
