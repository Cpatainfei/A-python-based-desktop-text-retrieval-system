   <TEXT> Ray Loynd ' s Jan . 15 review ( &quot; Diana Ross in ' Darkness ' Spotlight &quot; ) of the ABC television drama &quot; Out of Darkness , &quot; which he described as &quot; . . . Ross ' shattering portrait of a woman ' s battle with paranoia / schizophrenia , &quot; contains one very disturbing sentence : &quot; We never sense the real source of Paulie ' s ( Ross ) illness , except once when she self-mockingly describes herself as ' my father ' s son , ' a curdling line. &quot; As diabetes is a disease of the pancreas , schizophrenia is a disease of the brain -- genetically or biologically induced .
