   <HEADLINE> PASSOVER ; A MARRIAGE OF TWO SEDERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Passover Seder , which begins Saturday evening , commemorates the exodus of the Jews from Egypt , an event that is still being celebrated in much the same way it was more_than 2 # 000 years ago . Jews today still eat the unleavened_bread ( matzo ) , taste the bitter herbs , ask the four ritual questions , drink four cups of wine and open the door for Elijah the prophet to come_in and take_part . Yet there are significant differences in contemporary observances of Passover . Indeed , the way each family observes the Seder reflects its particular background , family history , preservation of traditions and adaptation to change . But not until I attended the Seder of my husband ' s family more_than 20 years ago did I fully realize how different those observances could be . Our Seder in Providence , R.I. , included the immediate family , invited students from nearby Brown University and , often , Christian friends . My parents ' Seder never began with the meal itself . Cocktails and hors d ' oeuvres came first -- a startling aberration , I learned later , from Jewish tradition . Then came matzo with pickled herring , chopped liver and gefilte_fish balls . I preferred the herring ; the only good thing about the gefilte_fish seemed to be the horseradish around it . ( Years later , when I tasted my mother-in-law ' s homemade gefilte_fish , I realized it could be delicious. ) * Finally , the Seder began . Our mahogany dining_table was set with symbolic foods placed on a flat cut-glass plate in the center , my father ' s silver bar_mitzvah cup from his native Germany alongside it for the Kiddush ( the blessing over the wine ) and a copy of the Haggadah , the narration of the exodus , on each plate . Our Haggadah was invariably a children ' s version -- short , slightly food-stained from Seders past and , most important , in English . Sitting next to my father also had its disadvantages . Even though Dad had been leading a Seder for 40 years , he was never comfortable with that role and took_on an exaggerated seriousness that often provoked my laughter . It seemed to me that at least every_other Seder I was temporarily excused from the table , overwhelmed by giggles . My late father did not grow_up with a Seder . His mother , Grandmother Lina , would explain , &quot; My religion is in my heart. &quot; Grandpa Rudolph refused even to participate in the ritual . But my American-born mother , a woman of Hungarian and Polish origin who has always maintained she brought fresh ideas into her husband ' s German family , insisted upon starting married life with a family Seder . * A deal was made . If Dad would lead an annual Seder , she would learn how to make chremselach , a deep-fried fritter filled with raisins and almonds served during Passover at his grandmother ' s home_in Germany . Dad carefully planned the service -- straight out of the children ' s Haggadah , his only model . For a child , not only the flavors but the rituals make the Seder different from every_other meal . One tradition was the beautiful Seder plate my mother prepared . The roasted egg and the shank bone recall the sacrifices performed in the temple in Jerusalem . The chopped apple and nut haroset symbolize the bricks and mortar used by the Jewish slaves for Pharaoh ' s buildings . To me , the most poignant part of the Passover food ritual was the lifting of the parsley , symbol of spring , and then dipping it into salted water in recollection of the tears shed by the Israelites during their Egyptian exile . After drinking the second of the four cups of wine required by ritual , we were ready to eat . Our meal was always an abbreviated version of a menu from &quot; The Settlement Cook Book. &quot; * The meal began with clear chicken_broth in which two light matzo_balls and a sprig of parsley floated . &quot; How delicately light the matzo_balls are , &quot; Dad would exclaim after his first bite . Mom would beam with a sigh of relief . For my mother , an otherwise eclectic cook , the lightness of her matzo_balls indicated her success as a Jewish mother , cook and wife . Thank goodness my husband , Allan , approved of light matzo_balls as well . Some Jews prefer matzo_balls that plummet like cannonballs , and marriages have been shattered over less . Our main_course was a crusty leg_of_lamb with new potatoes , fresh asparagus and green_salad . &quot; How shocking , &quot; a conservative friend once burst_out when I described this menu . &quot; But it ' s in the Bible , &quot; I insisted . &quot; ' And they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened_bread ; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. ' &quot; * &quot; Meat may_not be roasted for Passover until the Temple is rebuilt in Jerusalem , &quot; she replied , &quot; since roasted meat symbolizes the sacrifices performed in the Temple. &quot; Moreover , she added , leg_of_lamb is not a kosher cut . And anyway , a proper Passover meal requires three kinds of meat : a brisket , baked chicken and a chicken-veal-beef meat_loaf . My mother ' s response to such quibbling was firm . If leg_of_lamb was good_enough for &quot; The Settlement Cookbook , &quot; it was good_enough for her . Dessert was chremselach and a kiss torte , a meringue shell with strawberries and topped with whipped cream . As far as Mom was concerned , the meringue met the Passover requirement that no flour be used . She was not concerned about the whipped cream , as we did not observe the separation of milk and meat . We rarely finished drinking the third and fourth cups of wine , but Elijah the prophet was ceremoniously welcomed each year . The Seder ended when we began singing Passover songs , mostly off-key . My husband was , however , taken_aback by other features of my family ' s Seder . Traditionally and -- perhaps equally important -- according to his mother ' s way , the matzo_ball soup should have been preceded by hard-cooked eggs in salted water and by gefilte_fish . For my part , I was shocked when I learned that my in-laws did not consider the kosher Israeli dry Cabernet Sauvignon a suitable substitute for Manischewitz sweet . ( To the Gersons , wine was not wine if it was not sweet. ) * The Gerson family Seder , when I first encountered it , was profoundly different with the one I ' d grown_up with . The story was the same and the matzos were still square , but that about sums_up the similarities . As we entered Allan ' s parents ' apartment in the_Bronx , we were welcomed by the aroma of chicken_soup and a barrage of introductions to his entire family . The tiny living_room was crammed with borrowed tables and chairs to seat about 40 . Allan ' s mother , Peshka , secretly delighted , moaned over the number of relatives attending , all from the same small_town in Poland . For weeks she had been preparing the gefilte_fish ( although aunts Ruchsa and Chuma insisted behind her back that Peshka ' s lacked the right amount of almonds and salt ) . No one would think_of missing the Seder , even aunts and uncles who had not spoken_to each other for years . Seating was therefore arranged accordingly . * Allan ' s late father , Mottel , conducted the Seder in perfect Hebrew and Yiddish and halting English . The men listened , the women hovered . Mottel had learned how to conduct a Seder from his father , and Allan learned by watching and listening to Mottel . Mottel , a Holocaust survivor , always made his annual heartfelt speech in hesitant English , reminding us of the World_War_II Warsaw ghetto uprising as an analogy to the flight for freedom long ago in Egypt . He wanted his children to remember their Jewish roots and the horrors that befell his family before the Gersons migrated to the United States . For years , Allan and I alternated between attending Seders at his parents ' and my parents ' homes until we had our own children . His father has passed_away . My father has passed_away . Now we create our own traditions , a combination of both the cultural and culinary backgrounds of two similar yet very different families . Our three children look_forward to our annual Passover celebration the way Allan and I did when we were young , although I tend toward a more traditional Seder than that of my childhood . The service is left up_to Allan , while I focus_on choosing and preparing special foods . With the help of my mother-in-law , I make the light matzo_balls and her gefilte_fish . Each year , I try different kinds of harosets and make_sure there are asparagus and strawberries , symbolic of spring , as well as my mother ' s chremselach , as delectable as I remember it from my own childhood . And each year , Allan searches for just the right words , the special message , to make his Seder as meaningful to his children as his father did for him .

More Seder Ideas The following recipes , from Nathan ' s just-released &quot; Jewish Cooking in America &quot; ( Knopf , 1994 ; 466 pp. ; $ 30 ) show that Passover foods vary not only from family to family , but from culture to culture . Nathan ' s book demonstrates that Jewish cuisine can come from Turkey , Italy , or even from the sophisticated world of contemporary American restaurants . * The dessert fritters called bunuelos are a medieval Spanish heritage of Sephardic Jews . &quot; In New Mexico today , &quot; she writes , &quot; ( bunuelos ) are sometimes made with a rosette iron , fried and later dipped in a sugar-cinnamon combination . In Istanbul , a Jewish recipe that came_to Turkey with the Inquisition is a matzo bunuelo , sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. &quot; PASSOVER BUNUELOS 1 cup matzo_meal Dash salt 1 1 / 2 cups water 2 large eggs Vegetable_oil Hard-boiled eggs Sugar Cinnamon Maple_syrup Mix matzo_meal , salt , water and eggs in bowl . Beat well . Place about 2 inches of oil for deep-frying in large skillet . Heat oil to 375 degrees . Drop batter by heaping tablespoons into oil . Fry over medium-low heat few minutes on each side . Drain . Serve with hard-boiled_eggs or sugar and cinnamon or maple_syrup to taste . Makes about 12 bumuelos . Each serving contains about : 63 calories ; 30 mg sodium ; 35 mg cholesterol ; 2 grams fat ; 15 grams carbohydrates ; 2 grams protein ; 0.04 grams fiber . * Nathan writes , &quot; This matzo salad , created at the now defunct Quilted Giraffe Restaurant in New York , is the Passover equivalent of the Middle Eastern fattoush salad with toasted pita bread . It is delicious , a great accompaniment to pot roast. &quot; BARRY WINE ' S MATZO SALAD 10 squares matzo 4 tablespoons chicken fat or margarine 1 sweet red_pepper , finely diced 1 cucumber , finely diced 2 to 3 teaspoons capers , optional 1 bunch chives , finely chopped Salt , pepper Run rolling pin over matzo to break_up into small pieces no larger than 1 / 4 inch . Then cook in dry saute pan or slightly toast in 300-degree oven 10 minutes . Set_aside . Heat chicken fat in saucepan . Add sweet red_pepper and cucumber . Cook 1 minute over medium heat . Turn_off heat . Add capers and chives . Combine caper mixture and toasted matzo in bowl . Mix well . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Serve at room_temperature or slightly warm surrounding brisket . Makes 6 servings . Each serving contains about : 262 calories ; 241 mg sodium ; mg cholesterol ; 8 grams fat ; 42 grams carbohydrates ; 6 grams protein ; 160.40 grams fiber . * Nathan got this recipe from cookbook writer Carol Field . &quot; Field ' s description of the food served at a Roman Seder meal , &quot; Nathan writes , &quot; which the Italians call Pasqua Ebraica ( Jewish Easter ) , is mouth-watering . The Roman feast itself includes such dishes as bresaola ( air-dried beef served with hard-boiled_eggs ) and carciofi alla giudea ( artichokes cooked the Jewish way ) , and risotto containing asparagus , artichokes or fresh peas . Scacchi , a Sephardic layered dish like lasagna , called mina in Turkey , with layers of meat and sauteed vegetables alternating with matzo , takes the place of pasta and is served at the Seder Field attends in Berkeley ( Field comes from a fifth-generation San Francisco family that arrived with the Gold_Rush ) . Try this dish with or without the meat . For garlic lovers who like a lemony taste to their vegetables , this is a real winner . &quot; SCACCHI ( Roman Layered Vegetable Dish ) 2 pounds spinach , rinsed and stemmed 4 artichoke hearts , cleaned , chokes and fibrous leaves removed Juice 1 lemon 12 standard matzos 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive_oil 1 pound chopped ground_beef , optional Salt Freshly ground pepper 1 1 / 2 pounds onions , thinly sliced 6 cloves garlic , minced 3 / 4 teaspoon minced rosemary 3 / 4 teaspoon minced sage 1 peperoncino ( dried red chile ) , seeded and minced 1 / 2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 pound mushrooms , sliced 6 large eggs 1 / 2 cup lemon_juice 1 cup beef_broth or water Cook artichokes about 20 minutes in pot with water and juice of 1 lemon . Set_aside . Cook spinach 4 to 5 minutes in pot with only water left on leaves . Squeeze dry . Set_aside . Cover matzos with water in bowl and let sit until wet and almost crumbling . Heat 1 tablespoon olive_oil in skillet if using beef . Saute ground_beef , stirring until no longer red . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Drain . Set_aside . Saute onions in large skillet with 1 / 4 cup olive_oil . Drain . Set_aside . Saute artichokes in medium skillet with 1 / 4 cup olive_oil , 2 cloves garlic , rosemary and sage . Season to taste with salt . Drain . Set_aside . ( If using canned hearts , cut_in half. ) Saute spinach in skillet with 1 / 4 cup of olive_oil , 2 cloves garlic , peperoncino , nutmeg and salt to taste . Drain . Set_aside . Saute mushrooms in skillet with 1 / 4 cup olive_oil and remaining 2 cloves garlic , 3 to 4 minutes . Season to taste with salt . Grease 13x9-inch baking dish . Add sauteed ground meat . Cover with 1 layer of 3 matzos . Matzos may fall_apart . Cover with layer of onions . Layer 3 more matzos on top , alternating with artichokes , spinach and mushrooms . Beat eggs together in bowl and add remaining 1 / 2 cup lemon_juice . Pour over top of dish . Add enough broth to moisten well . Bake at 400 degrees about 30 minutes or until mixture is set and cooked through . Makes 8 to 10 servings .
