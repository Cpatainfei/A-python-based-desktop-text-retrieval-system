   <HEADLINE> WHY THE SCARLET ' A ' WORKS AGAINST US ; SEX OFFENDERS : PUNISHING THE GUILTY WITH HARD TIME AND LIFELONG LABELS ONLY ENSURES THAT THE PROBLEM WILL GROW WORSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I ' m riding along in my car against the background_noise of a radio talk-show host working_up her audience over the prospect that a sex offender might be living nearby . The discussion centers_on the federal crime bill , which encourages police to pass_out photos and addresses of anyone in the neighborhood who has been previously convicted of molestation . ( California has gone_further by dispensing names , ZIP_codes and photos of sex offenders to any and all who might ask. ) The host ' s diagnoses range from &quot; monsters &quot; to &quot; scum_bags &quot; and her policy proposals range from leafleting to the death_penalty . Then , a soft-spoken male caller offers a simple solution : Sex offenders should be made to wear large identifying tags around their necks , with immediate imprisonment should they be caught without them . &quot; You know -- like Hitler did with the Jews. &quot; A brief silence follows and the host moves_on to other matters . For the past decade , I ' ve been treating these &quot; perpetrators , &quot; as the stilted language of law_enforcement puts it . They usually suffer from one or another of the 50 so-called sexual paraphilias . Few are strangers to their victims . Most are friends and family members who have harmed their own . Few are violent , and unlike demons , they tend not to fall_out of the sky . I think_of Sean , a 14-year-old hockey and baseball_player who wants desperately to be straight and macho but who , from age 11 , has been attracted to younger boys . Hiding this from his family , his jock buddies and himself , he clings_to the hope that all will eventually be_well . Then one day , a tease turns serious and Sean and a 10-year-old boy are involved in month-long series of convoluted sexual encounters . Sean is arrested , and though he is being effectively treated , will probably carry the label of sex offender for the rest of his life . Then there was Pablo , a handsome 15-year-old from Central_America convicted of fondling a 13-year-old girl at a swimming_pool . As his treatment unfolds , familiar patterns emerge : abandoned at age 6 by his homosexual father ( who had not molested him ) only to be sodomized at age 9 by his mother ' s new , otherwise aggressively heterosexual husband . Bill , 24 , was questioned by the police after he approached a 12-year-old boy . &quot; If you have a problem , &quot; they said , &quot; we ' ll help you find treatment. &quot; Weighed_down with the guilt of unwelcome impulses since puberty , Bill unburdened himself -- revealing a secret sexual encounter he ' d had with a boy five years earlier . He didn ' t mention his more fearsome secret -- that he had been sodomized by his older brother two or three times a week from age 8 to 13 . He feared the revelation would destroy his mother and jeopardize his brother ' s career as a Marine fighter_pilot . Bill ' s treatment turned_out to be a 10-year sentence to the state penitentiary . Take 26-year-old Scott , who came_to us charged with sexual_assault . The incident arose out of a consensual bondage scenario with his girlfriend that suddenly turned violent . He had no history of sexual offending . However , as a teen-aged juvenile he was sentenced to an adult prison for burglary . Two months later , he was gang-raped . His inability to fend_off his attackers anointed him a cell block &quot; punk. &quot; For the next three years , he was made to serve on demand the sundry sexual needs of straight , non-sex-offender inmates . Scott returned to the streets transfixed by violent sexual obsessions . The painful dilemmas that wind their way through these lives are seldom well-addressed through the criminal-justice system and even less so through vigilantism . John Money , the eminent Johns Hopkins University researcher studying sexual compulsions , summarized it best . &quot; The adversarial system for the treatment of paraphilia by means of prosecution and punishment , &quot; he said , &quot; must be pronounced an abject failure. &quot; Despite the popular view that sex offenders are untreatable , research shows otherwise . Studies done_in Canada , California and Vermont demonstrate that appropriate treatment can substantially cut the chances of a sex offender re-offending . Unfortunately , in the current national hysteria , a troubled pedophile dare not talk much about himself or his past without a high probability of his therapist reporting him to the authorities . The risk doesn ' t end there . Take 13-year-old Troy , grossly sexually abused by a 25-year-old friend of his older sister when he was 11 . Shortly thereafter he attempted the same thing with his 8-year-old sister . He was locked_up for a number of months , then released for treatment at a local mental_health center . The adolescent group members had to begin each therapy session with this mantra : &quot; My name is ------ . I am a sex offender and I will be one for the rest of my life. &quot; The ritual troubled Troy and he asked his mother , Why ? The therapist told her that she had seen it on &quot; Oprah. &quot; Understandably , sex offenders anger us . But often our reaction seems to go beyond indignation and taps more primitive impulses . Indeed , the first recorded execution of a youngster in this country involved a 17th-Century Massachusetts farm_boy who was discovered engaging in sexual play with one of his pet animals . The teen-ager was forced to watch as his pets were hanged one-by-one in front of him , after which he was himself dispatched on the gallows . In the end , all_the hot_lines , leaflets , talk-show kitsch and vigilantism won ' t slow the rate of sexual abuse . Precisely the reverse . As troubled individuals are tagged and driven from neighborhoods and families and friends and slip into that nether world of isolation and trance that feeds perverse fantasy , sexual offending can only grow more dangerous and egregious .</TEXT>
