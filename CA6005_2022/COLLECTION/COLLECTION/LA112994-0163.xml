   <HEADLINE> NORWAY ' S VOTERS REJECT JOINING EUROPEAN UNION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a move heavy with significance for both Norway and the drive toward a united Europe , Norwegians voting in a national referendum Monday narrowly rejected membership in the European Union . With 94 % of the vote counted , Norwegians were saying &quot; no &quot; by a slim 52.6 % to 47.4 % . The result was virtually a repeat of a referendum held_on the same issue 22 years ago . A three-quarters majority in the 165-seat Parliament would be needed to approve membership , and more_than the quarter of lawmakers needed to block approval have already said they would oppose it . Monday ' s ballot effectively split the country . The rural , agrarian north , fearful of losing subsidies , had enough &quot; no &quot; votes to counter the urban , business-oriented south , which voted strongly in favor of EU membership . After several hours of tense vote-counting , Anne Enger Lahnstein , the leader of the agrarian-based Center Party -- who was dubbed &quot; The No Queen &quot; during the campaign -- gave what amounted to a victory statement . &quot; We ' ve experienced that people at the grass-roots got involved and fought with a will we ' ve never seen the_likes_of before , &quot; she said . &quot; They have worked for the values they believed_in . We ' ve not said ' no ' to Europe or ' no ' to international cooperation ; we ' ve said ' no ' to union. &quot; The biggest personal loser in the referendum is undoubtedly the country ' s prime_minister , Gro Harlem Brundtland , who risked much of her political prestige in heading the &quot; yes &quot; movement . &quot; The result is a heavy defeat for her , &quot; said Knut Heidar , an Oslo University political_scientist . However , her overall popularity and the absence of any obvious challenger within her party would seem to assure her future as premier for at least the short term . The implications for Norway and for the drive to create a politically and economically united Europe seem less certain in the wake of Monday ' s vote . For Europe , the impact of Norway ' s rejection is likely to be blunted . It follows strong &quot; yes &quot; votes_in three other countries this year -- Austria , Sweden and Finland -- a development that means the EU will expand in January from 12 to 15 nations . While the Norwegian rejection must be seen as a psychological setback for advocates of deeper European unity , some analysts argued Monday that it could be a blessing in disguise for them . Speaking before the results were announced , one Brussels-based political analyst said he was hoping for a &quot; no &quot; vote . &quot; I prefer Norway to say no , &quot; said Daniel Gross , a senior research fellow at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels . &quot; They would be another problem country . It would be a help if they are not at the 1996 conference because they ' d just put the brakes on. &quot; In 1996 , the EU is committed to a wholesale review of the Maastricht Treaty that commits member nations to political and economic union . That conference is expected to be a de_facto constitutional convention . &quot; In the end , this is going_to make_it tougher for Norway than for Europe , &quot; predicted Uwe Nerlich , deputy director of the Ebenhausen Institute , a German think thank near Munich . Certainly conditions for Norway outside the EU are likely to be much more difficult than they were in the years after its 1972 rejection . With Sweden and Finland soon to be members , Norway risks being isolated from all its traditional Nordic partners . It would also be outside any EU defense union that might develop over the next few years . Monday ' s vote followed an emotional , sometimes bitter campaign that at times brought tempers to a boil in a country known for its low-keyed approach to life . In recent days , Brundtland and some_other leading figures of the &quot; yes &quot; campaign received veiled threats , including letters containing live ammunition . For many Norwegians , the vote was about nothing less than the future of the nation -- whether their country should now cast its fate with that of mainstream Europe or go_forward alone . Positive referendums in Finland on Oct . 16 and in Sweden on Nov . 13 only tightened the race and heightened the already high political temperature , as &quot; yes &quot; advocates argued that rejection would leave Norway gloriously , but dangerously , isolated . Opponents warned that a vote to join the EU would deliver Norway into the hands of faraway , insensitive Brussels bureaucrats who would dismantle the nation ' s politically sensitive farming and fishing industries . While the campaign has dominated the Nordic country ' s political agenda since the terms of its entry were negotiated in Brussels last winter , the question of whether Norway should become a part of the drive for deeper European integration has dogged the country over a generation . Charles de Gaulle effectively vetoed two Norwegian applications to join during the 1960s , when he was president of France . In 1972 , Norwegians themselves became the only people to reject membership by voting &quot; no &quot; in a national referendum . With a healthy economy , a comfortable trade_balance , enough North_Sea oil to last a generation and rich gas fields with reserves that will last another century , Norway hardly needs the EU ' s financial assistance . The country ' s wealth supports a liberal welfare system that makes poverty almost nonexistent and provides subsidies that keep farming and fishing communities alive in remote northern areas .</TEXT>
