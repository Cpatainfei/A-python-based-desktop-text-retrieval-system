   <HEADLINE> WILL ' WHO LOST RUSSIA ? ' BECOME ' WHO LOST EUROPE ? '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the wake of the fascist and communist surge in Russia ' s December elections and the resignations of prominent reformers , pundits are already asking , &quot; Who lost Russia ? &quot; But this is not the right question . Here ' s why : U.S. interests in Russian reform are part and parcel of America ' s broader interests in a secure , democratic and prosperous Europe . By focusing_on Moscow , to the detriment of our other interests , we run the risk of failing to consolidate democratic gains in Central and Eastern Europe . The fading fortunes of economic reform in countries formerly behind the Iron_Curtain have fed an alarming rise in virulent nationalism -- even neo-fascism . The nightmare America and her allies must avoid is a fractured and fascist Europe . Yet , most observers have only noticed the bad news out of Moscow . The twin champions of reform , Prime_Minister Yegor T . Gaidar and Finance_Minister Boris G . Fyodorov , have resigned -- with the latter blasting Strobe Talbott , the State_Department ' s &quot; Russia czar &quot; and soon-to-be deputy secretary_of_state . A cast of apparatchiks have seemingly taken_control . These events have caused consternation in Western capitals , but talk_of a &quot; lost &quot; Russia is wrongheaded , for at least two reasons : First , Russia has not been &quot; lost. &quot; In microeconomic terms , the economic situation has improved , in many respects , over the last year . More_than 75 % of Russia ' s small businesses and retail shops are in private hands . More_than 25 % of the labor_force is employed in the private sector . Unfortunately , the growth of the private sector has been accompanied by a rampant increase in organized -- and violent -- crime . Bribery and corruption are widespread tools of business . Reformers , like Democrats in Washington , need to become as anti-crime as their opponents . The main risk to reform is_on the macroeconomic front . Fyodorov ' s efforts had just begun to pay_off . Inflation was coming_down . Indeed , the chief impediment to bringing inflation under_control was -- and is -- Central_Bank Chairman Viktor V . Gerashchenko , a communist holdover and bitter opponent of reform . that ' s why the resignations are so disturbing . Personnel determine policy . With the departure of the reformers and their replacement by &quot; Red managers , &quot; there are few left in Moscow ' s upper reaches -- other_than Boris N . Yeltsin himself -- with any tested commitment to reform . These resignations are reminiscent_of Eduard A . Shevardnadze ' s resignation as Soviet foreign_minister in 1990 . President Mikhail S . Gorbachev felt he could continue reform without his trusted colleague -- only to have his new associates from the old_guard attempt to depose him in a coup . Gains made by Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky ' s Liberal Democratic Party -- neither liberal nor democratic nor truly a party -- in the Dec . 12 elections are a basic cause of much of Russia ' s current turmoil . They reveal the extent of popular opposition to Yeltsin ' s economic reform program and the people ' s willingness to look_for simplistic solutions . Yet , the Russian people also approved a constitution giving the government , not the Parliament , power . It is not whistling past the graveyard to say Yeltsin has the tools to accelerate reform . The question is : Does he have the will -- and the personnel -- to do so ? Second , the West cannot &quot; lose &quot; Russia . Russia can be &quot; lost &quot; -- but only by the Russian people and their leaders . Russia is a nation of more_than 150 million people , spanning 12 time_zones . Great powers are &quot; great &quot; primarily because they determine their own destinies . Ultimately , the choices Russians make will shape their future . Only they can lose a nascent democratic Russia to fascism or communism . What the West can lose , however , is the opportunity to reshape Europe . While the West ' s influence over events in Russia is marginal , our influence over events in the emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe can be decisive . But recent events there have been no more conducive to reform than those in Moscow . In Belarus , Prime_Minister Stanislav Shushkevich , another committed reformer , has been ousted by Parliament for pushing reform too aggressively and failing to align Minsk ' s foreign_policy with Moscow ' s . In Kiev , the Parliament has again failed to ratify the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . This despite the Clinton_Administration ' s promise to double aid to the Ukrainian government so it will do the very thing it has promised us twice before it would do . Meanwhile , inflation in Ukraine has reached 100 % a month , effectively undermining the people ' s economic independence . And in recent elections in the Crimea , a Russian secessionist won 73 % of the vote . Farther west , in the Balkans , the war winds on -- and up , not down . The Bosnian Serbs have instituted a general mobilization . There are reports both Serbia and Croatia are sending regular_army units into Bosnia-Herzegovina . In Belgrade on a trip , Zhirinovsky tied these events together when he said , &quot; The retreat has ended , we are launching a general offensive , let all our enemies fear us . . . . Let them squirm in Paris , London , Washington and Tel Aviv. &quot; Zhirinovsky ' s trip to the Balkans symbolizes the danger the West faces . We should take him seriously -- both because of what he says and where he says it . By his words , Zhirinovsky tells us what he opposes . Except for Serbian &quot; ethnic cleansing , &quot; what he supports is unclear . He is against democracy ; against free markets ; against the West , and against non-Russians and nonwhites -- depending_on the audience . Anger over Russia ' s losses is his driving force , as is resentment against those who allegedly caused them : Westerners , capitalists , Jews . Zhirinovsky is , plain and simple , a fascist . The nation is supreme , the individual subservient . To him , being Russian is intrinsically good . Being anything else is intrinsically bad -- unless for tactical purposes he wants to unite Russians with Serbs in a Slavic brotherhood or Russians with white Europeans and Americans against the &quot; blacks. &quot; Where he ' s been making his pronouncements is equally disturbing . Last week , he found a receptive audience in Serbia . He and Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic are , in many ways , soul_mates . Each feeds_on a hypernationalism that combines authoritarianism at_home with contempt for everything foreign . The danger is that the Milosevics and the Zhirinovskys will continue to preach their message of intolerance and hate , even conspiring in their efforts , putting pressure on other leaders to &quot; defend &quot; their peoples . Soon , ethnicity , not democracy , could become the organizing principle for the region . History would tell us that ' s likely . Here ' s where that could lead . Serbia could extend its ethnic cleansing to Albanians in Kosovo and Sandjak and to Hungarians in Vojvodina . Tensions could increase between Greece and Albania over the Albanians already expelled from Greece and the 60 # 000 to 300 # 000 Greeks living_in Albania . ( So contentious is the issue already that Greece and Albania cannot agree on the actual number. ) These tensions are likely to rebound in Turkey -- where there will be calls_for defense of the primarily Muslim Albanians , as well as the approximately 800 # 000 ethnic Turks in Bulgaria . Hungarian nationalists could come_to power on promises to protect the more_than 4 million ethnic Hungarians in neighboring states . Of course , this pales in comparison with the potential conflicts over the 25 million Russians living_in the &quot; near abroad. &quot; Obviously , the Baltics are a flash_point . But so , too , are northern Kazakhstan and eastern Ukraine -- where many Russians live and nuclear_weapons remain . In short , U.S. interests in Europe and Eurasia comprise more_than who does what to whom inside the Kremlin walls . Not all problems in Europe can be solved via the Moscow-Washington hot_line . In the weeks ahead , President Bill_Clinton and his key aides need to ask and answer five questions : One , how can the West contain the conflict in the Balkans and prevent it from becoming a broader Balkan war ? The West may_not be able to stop the war in Bosnia at an acceptable cost , but with resolve and foresight , it can prevent one from starting in Macedonia , Albania , Hungary or other neighboring states . Two , how can the West integrate those Central and Eastern European democracies that meet objective criteria ( e.g. , Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic ) for full membership in Western institutions ? The Partnership for Peace is an evasion . Third , how can we promote the independence of the non-Russian former Soviet states while working to denuclearize them ? Clinton missed an opportunity to support democracy when he failed to visit Kyrgyzstan . Under Askar Akayev , this state is moving toward democracy and hasn ' t made and then broken promises . Fourth , what can be done to support democracy and free markets in Russia -- now that most reformers have left the government ? Let ' s hope the West doesn ' t panic and cut_off support to reformers at the local levels and in the private sector who now desperately need our support . Finally , what can Washington do to increase West-West coordination and cooperation ? If America and her West European allies can ' t agree on a course of action , then a Europe whole and free surely will be lost to a Europe fractured and fascist . Then the question will not be , &quot; Who lost Russia ? &quot; It will be , &quot; Who lost Europe ? &quot; *</TEXT>
