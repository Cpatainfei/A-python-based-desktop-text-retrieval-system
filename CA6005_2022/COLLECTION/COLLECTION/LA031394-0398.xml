   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : GOAL FOR A SOCCER SUMMER : GETTING FOOT IN HOTEL DOOR ; LODGING : AS STADIUMS ACROSS U.S. FILL FOR WORLD CUP , SO WILL ROOMS AND FLIGHTS . BOOK EARLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is our right , as free Americans , to value baseball , football and basketball above soccer and turn a deaf ear to the upcoming World Cup competition in this country . But those who ignore soccer this summer may be punished . Depending_on how this first U.S. staging of the World Cup goes , the ignorant American traveler could either stumble into a city full of inflated rates and booked-up hotels , or hand_over full price to a hotelier who is_on the brink of resorting_to &quot; fire_sale &quot; rates . The upcoming soccer competition , bringing hundreds of international athletes to this country for the world ' s largest professional sporting spectacle , will stretch from June 17 to July 17 with matches in nine U.S. cities . Organizers say they expect all stadiums involved to sell_out . An influx of up_to 1 million foreign spectators has been forecast . Faced with such numbers , World Cup organizers started setting_aside hotel_rooms in 1992 , and by late last year had reserved an estimated 2 million room-nights at hotels nationwide . Some of those beds have since been released , and as hotel room-deposit deadlines arrive in mid-April and May , many_more rooms may or may_not be released . If international travelers beat a path here , as organizers predict , the number of rooms released will be small , and the result for other travelers to those cities will be lower availability and higher rates . In that event , said World Cup Accommodations Bureau spokesman John Parker , non-soccer travelers should &quot; use their own experience of a Super Bowl &quot; in deciding whether to brave affected cities . That is , book rooms months ahead or stay away . On the other hand , if foreign fans stay home , or sleep six to a room , or lodge under the roofs of family and friends , or sleep_in bags under the stars , hoteliers here could find themselves with thousands of rooms to dump in June and July . Despite the avowed confidence of World Cup organizers , John Marks , president of the San Francisco Convention and Visitor Bureau , noted that many hoteliers in his area are &quot; very uncertain &quot; about the World Cup projection they ' ve heard . Marks estimated that nearly 10 # 000 of the 50 # 000 hotel_rooms in the greater San Francisco area were blocked for the World Cup as of mid-February -- a figure comparable_to the number the city gets for gatherings of the National Auto Dealers Assn . or the American Dental Assn . Marks said he has been told to expect up_to 10 # 000 Brazilians , 5 # 000-6 # 000 Colombians , 3 # 000-6 # 000 Swiss , and smaller numbers of Russians and Cameroonians . Will the soccer pilgrims prove as predictable as convention-bound dentists ? The summer hotel outlook , in the Bay Area and beyond , depends in part on the answer to that question . To get a sense of availability , check for newly released rooms after the deposit deadlines in mid-April and mid-May . There ' s another level to this , too . After the initial round of matches , winners and their fans advance to new cities , potentially complicating air_travel as well as ground accommodations . Protect yourself and book early . Here ' s a rundown of World Cup dates and the affected metropolitan areas .
