   <HEADLINE> FDA COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS NEW AIDS DRUG ; HEALTH : SCIENTISTS ASK GOVERNMENT TO APPROVE STAVUDINE , OR D4T , AFTER SOME SUCCESS IN CLINICAL STUDIES . BUT PANEL URGES CAUTION REGARDING ITS RISKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A panel of scientists recommended Friday that the federal_government approve a new drug to battle the AIDS virus -- but with strong warnings that doctors still don ' t know enough about the medicine to say who should take it . An advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration said Stavudine , or d4T , probably provides some benefit over the three existing AIDS drugs . But the panel couldn ' t say just who would benefit , just how safe it was or whether the manufacturer was_on the right track to answer the many questions . &quot; I ' m not sure how good our advice was today , &quot; said Dr. Deborah Cotton , a Harvard_University professor who chaired the panel . The FDA is considering whether to permit the sale of d4T under a special procedure that allows promising drugs for life-threatening diseases on the market before their makers prove definitively that they work . Permission could be revoked if the drug maker fails to meet the FDA ' s conditions . The FDA has not said when it will decide on d4T . It is not bound by the advisory_board ' s decisions , but generally follows them . Bristol-Myers Squibb says d4T appears to help raise the immunity of people with the human_immunodeficiency_virus while causing fewer side_effects than other AIDS drugs . Currently , there are three approved AIDS drugs , AZT , or Zidovudine ; ddI , or Didanosine ; and ddC , or Zalcitabine . Each works by blocking the action of an enzyme called reverse_transcriptase that the virus uses to replicate . All cause fairly severe side_effects , and the virus can mutate to resist them . Some patients experience resistance to AZT , the most widely used drug , as soon as six months after starting treatment . Officials said d4T works in a similar manner . But there are major unsettled questions about the new drug : Who will it benefit ? Are there short-term benefits ? Does_it increase AIDS patients ' survival ? Are there fewer side_effects , as the manufacturer claims ? The company asked the FDA to approve d4T for AIDS patients who cannot take any of the other drugs because of serious side_effects or drug resistance . It has studied 10 # 000 such people , giving them two different doses of d4T . After a year and a half , 79 % are still alive , but 21 % have experienced some peripheral neuropathy , a painful nerve disorder , which some critics called an unacceptable risk . But the study , still incomplete , could not prove whether the neuropathy was caused by d4T or by AIDS . It indicated that a lower dose of d4T -- 20 milligrams twice a day -- poses less of a risk of neuropathy . But the advisory committee said that evidence was troubling because the patients in another study who had_the_best benefits needed 40 milligrams twice a day . The advisory committee said the best test given so far was in 359 patients who had taken AZT for six months . Half were given d4T and the rest continued taking AZT . Preliminary data shows those on d4T had a very small increase in CD4 cells , the body ' s master immune cell . The increase -- though only about 20 to 25 cells per milliliter of blood -- was significant because the AZT patients saw their CD4 cells continuously drop . The d4T patients also experienced a small weight gain and told the company through questionnaires that they felt some improvement in quality_of_life . &quot; It just might be that this drug is a better drug than Zidovudine . . . but we haven ' t seen any data to prove that , &quot; said Dr. Paul Lietman , an advisory committee_member and professor at Johns Hopkins University . Some AIDS activists said there are still too many unanswered questions about d4T . &quot; We don ' t know how or when or if to use this drug , &quot; said Derrick Link of Gay_Men ' s Health Crisis . The scientists agreed . They urged Bristol-Myers to study how d4T will interact with other AIDS drugs -- because patients commonly take more_than one -- and how it will interact with drugs they need for tuberculosis and other AIDS-related infections . They told Bristol-Myers to study d4T in children , women and minorities because the studies to date are primarily in young white_men .</TEXT>
