   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / GROUP_A PREVIEW ; NOBODIES NO LONGER ; IN EARNING FIRST WORLD CUP BERTH IN 28 YEARS , SWISS PROVE THEY CAN PRODUCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One little tabloid newspaper report and the_Swiss national soccer team was catapulted into a debate that was anything but neutral . Coach Roy Hodgson , it was reported , had issued a directive . No sex for his players from early June until the conclusion of the World Cup . The ensuing worldwide uproar -- sprinkled with knowing chuckles -- temporarily threatened to overshadow the fact that the_Swiss would be in the event for the first time in 28 years . What kind of headlines were next ? Strikers Who Love Too_Much ? Last Tango in Zurich ? Oprah and Geraldo , however , can rest easy . Hodgson , stunned and irritated by the attention &quot; this rubbish &quot; was receiving , relaxed the all-out decree and limited the ban to simply the day before games . If it were only so simple to handle the larger challenge at_hand . The Swiss will be playing the United States in its World Cup opener June 18 at the Silverdome in Pontiac , Mich . While it won ' t be as disquieting as playing Italy in Rome , being indoors in humid conditions against the host country in a rare morning game ( 11:30 ) is an imposing enough test in itself . Swiss soccer fans , though , were able to gain some measure of comfort when FIFA recently granted special permission to jangle cowbells at World Cup matches . To get here , Switzerland had to maneuver through a rugged qualifying group . It finished one point behind Italy , scoring 22 goals and giving_up seven in 10 qualifying matches . The Swiss team went 6-1-3 , losing once to Portugal but also defeating Italy , 1-0 . Perhaps the turning point came against Italy in Cagliari on Oct . 14 , 1992 , when Switzerland took a 2-0 lead before finishing with a 2-2 tie . Beforehand , Swiss defender Alain Geiger watched a television_program promoting the match and heard his team called &quot; nobodies. &quot; that ' s obviously not true anymore . But the_Swiss national team certainly did not have much recent credibility until Hodgson took_over two years ago from former German World Cup star Uli Stielike . Hodgson , a cigar-smoking Englishman , is credited with reshaping the team ' s mental_state , providing an infusion of confidence . The Swiss have what is considered a good blend of youth and experience , relying_on four players from the German Bundesliga : forwards Stephane Chapuisat and Adrian Knup , and midfielders Ciriaco ( Ciri ) Sforza and Alain Sutter . To have any success against the_Swiss , it generally is agreed that Chapuisat , who scored 17 goals with Borussia Dortmund this season , must be contained . The 24-year-old is blessed with an impressive pedigree and already has demonstrated star qualities , having been voted the top player in the Bundesliga in 1992-93 . His father , Pierre-Albert , a former Swiss international player , was known as being a hothead , but Stephane has earned a reputation as a calm , left-footed sniper . He is also versatile , capable of playing_up front or on the left_wing . Yet Chapuisat isn ' t a solo act ; he is surrounded by an impressive supporting cast up front . Knup , 26 , scored 11 goals in 11 games in his first season with Switzerland in 1991 . He is strong in the air , and a broken cheekbone suffered last year against Portugal has not caused him to physically back_off . Sforza , 24 , considered a superb playmaker , can play in support of his strikers at midfield or drop_back as sweeper . His skills have improved rapidly , and he scored eight goals this season in the Bundesliga . Sutter , with his long , blond hair , is probably the most recognizable player on the team . Once regarded_as a child_prodigy , the left-footer made his national debut at 17 , playing in the_Swiss first division with the Zurich Grasshoppers . The defense is not as highly regarded . The back four could be Geiger , the team ' s captain ; Dominique Herr , Yvan Quentin and Marc Hottiger . There is also Andy Egli , a 36-year-old veteran defender , who has survived two knee operations and a newspaper poll in January in which 6 # 000 readers were surveyed and 79 % voted_in favor of dropping him from the national team . Goalkeeper Marco Pascolo , who once played for Hodgson at Xamax Neuchatel , has been hampered by an injured Achilles ' tendon , missing a June 3 tuneup against Italy . This will be Switzerland ' s seventh appearance in the World Cup . It has reached the quarterfinals three times ( 1934 , 1938 and 1954 ) but most recently appeared in the event in 1966 . That year , the accomplishment was marred when two star Swiss players were suspended for breaking curfew . Without them , Switzerland lost to West Germany , 5-0 . The most impressive World Cup for Switzerland was in 1954 , when it played host to the event . The Swiss reached the quarterfinals by beating Italy twice , then lost to Austria in a highly unusual match . Austria won , 7-5 , after it trailed , 3-0 , within the first 23 minutes .</TEXT>
