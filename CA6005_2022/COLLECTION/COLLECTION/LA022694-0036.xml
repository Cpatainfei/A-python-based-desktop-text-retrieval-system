   <HEADLINE> AL MARTINEZ : THE MEN AT THE OFFICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> His name is Juan Carlos Ruiz . He ' s a husky , 30-year-old Latino who doesn ' t expose himself , bother little children or urinate on street_corners . Ask him if he does those things and he feels insulted . &quot; Do you ? &quot; he demands , and when you shake your head no , he replies , &quot; Then why do you think I would ? &quot; Well , it ' s because he ' s got , you know , brown skin and talks funny . It ' s because he ' s Mexican . It ' s because he ' s one of those day_laborers you see trying to hustle work_on street_corners . &quot; I need food and I need rent money , but I don ' t break the law , &quot; Juan Carlos will tell you proudly . &quot; I ' m here to work. &quot; that ' s no crime . Not yet . But if L.A. County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke has her way , it will be . Burke is proposing a law that would criminalize what Juan Carlos Ruiz and hundreds of others throughout the county are doing : soliciting jobs on street_corners . She ' s responding to complaints from residents in Ladera Heights who just don ' t want the men there . Forget that they ' re trying to survive . Forget that they vehemently deny doing the kinds of things they ' re accused of . &quot; They say we ' re gambling , &quot; Juan Carlos says . &quot; You know what that consists_of ? &quot; He takes a nickel from his pocket and flips it into the air . &quot; We toss coins , &quot; he says incredulously . &quot; We toss nickels to pass the time ! &quot; Do they , as accused , begin drinking about noon and stay drunk half the day ? Juan Carlos shakes his head and waves the question off with a broad gesture . &quot; We can ' t , &quot; he finally says with a sigh . &quot; We have to stay sober to watch for immigration agents. &quot; * They call their corner at Slauson and Fairfax avenues &quot; the office , &quot; and they ' re usually there from about 7 a.m. until 4 p.m. They ' ve become a family of men , good friends who help each other get_by in difficult times . Recently they came_up with $ 60 in donations to help a fellow_worker injured in an automobile accident . This at a time when even the nickels they toss are hard to come_by , earned with picks and shovels and the sweat of their brow . Burke ' s ordinance , delayed 45 days for review , would end all that . It ' s not because most of them aren ' t good people , she told me the other day . It ' s just that some of them ruin it for others . Sadly , Burke is another example of a legislator unwittingly pandering to a rising incidence of hatred directed toward Latinos . Rooted in the recession , it has come_to embrace not only illegal immigrants , but anyone with brown skin , whether or not he ' s on the public dole . Those we dignify as homeless are free to beg at whatever street_corner they choose , sleep_in any doorway available and piss in any park . You want drunks or addicts , try wandering among these people . But get the Latinos off the street_corners . I ' ve tried a dozen or more times to hire homeless whites to do light yardwork for $ 6 an hour and haven ' t had a taker yet , despite the signs they hold offering to labor for food . You ' ll find them on street_corners too , often with small children , in a bid for sympathy that opens wallets and empties pockets . . . without ever swinging a pick or lifting a load . * I dislike being an advocate for any group , despite my surname . I don ' t speak Spanish , I don ' t live_in a barrio , frijoles don ' t turn me on and I ' ll be damned if I ' ll ever sing &quot; La Cucaracha &quot; in a crowded cantina . But this isn ' t a question of ethnic defense . It ' s a question of human decency . I never expected that L.A. , its history rooted in Hispanic culture , would be mean in an effort to solve or explain economic problems that immigrants had little or nothing to do with . Mexicans didn ' t plunge this country into financial chaos . Nicaraguans didn ' t shut_down the defense industry . Salvadorans didn ' t chase General Motors out of the Valley . Peruvians don ' t control pork-barrel politics . But I hear everyone from Bill_Clinton to Pete Wilson damn the immigrants . I hear Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer damn the immigrants . I hear City_Council members damn the street vendors . And now I hear Yvonne Brathwaite Burke damn the day_laborers . Even in disaster , the hard voices rise : no long-term earthquake assistance for illegals , they cry . To hell with compassion . To hell with mercy . You don ' t have to be a Latino to sense the hatred , but the men at the office are feeling it the most , and the pain is intense . A Nicaraguan day_laborer in my community , where they are also under_attack , said it best when he said , &quot; They ' re turning the lights out on us. &quot; He was talking_about the lamp beside the golden door .</TEXT>
