   <HEADLINE> BONES DUG FROM PARK DATED 4 # 000 YEARS OLD ; ARCHEOLOGY : ANOTHER SET OF HUMAN REMAINS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE 2 # 000 YEARS OLD . THE FINDS WERE REBURIED WITHOUT TESTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As with many amateur archeologists , Sam Massey ' s claims of finding ancient human remains in a regional park were met with initial skepticism . But this time , his find proved true . After heavy rains fell_in Aliso Viejo last October , Massey , of Laguna Hills , headed off-trail in Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park . He began searching newly exposed layers of dirt by the creek . &quot; I look_for opportunities like that , &quot; he said . In two days , he found three areas with human bones . &quot; I had to be careful &quot; of legal and religious regulations . Massey contacted the Orange County Natural_History Assn. , several museums and various professional archeologists for three months . But nobody believed him , he said . Finally , the history association asked its former curator , environmental data systems archeologist Gary Hurd , to go take_a_look with Massey . &quot; It ' s usually a sheep or deer , &quot; Hurd said of people ' s claims of finding archeological artifacts . &quot; Most folks see big bones and think it ' s human . In this case , Massey was correct. &quot; Hurd contacted the county ' s park services , the coroner and the Juaneno Native_Americans ' tribal council . The finding led to a search conducted by archeologists this month in Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park , where they found more of the remains of a couple estimated to be at least 4 # 000 years old , said Huntington Beach archeologist Mike Macko . Macko , who led the 10-day search requested by the county , said the five-member team found a skull and left arm of an apparent male , and most of the remains of an apparent female . The two appeared to have been buried together , although no burial artifacts were found . Estimates of carbon levels in the soil led to the 4 # 000-year age estimate . The group , which consisted_of Macko and two of his staff_members plus two representatives of the Juaneno tribe , also found the remains of two other , younger humans scattered separately about 200 feet from the couple . Macko estimated these humans , who apparently were buried in fetal positions rather than straight like the couple , at 2 # 000 years old or less . Of the older two , Macko said : &quot; The uniqueness is not only that the female is intact except for a lower limb . . . but that these two were at a relatively young age when they died , even considering the shorter life span . They were clearly in their prime. &quot; He added , &quot; There are so many things we ' d like to ask of these remains , but we ' re restricted. &quot; He was referring to rights of the Juanenos under state law to have the remains reburied without testing , because they might be ancestors of that tribe . But , he said , &quot; they deserve to be put_back to rest. &quot; Local Native_American representatives have determined in this case to rebury the bones away from the creek . The 3 # 400-acre park has many California oaks , whose acorns were a staple of ancient inhabitants of the area , said Tim Miller , regional manager . He said that the exact location of the site would be kept secret . &quot; We don ' t want anybody knowing the location and going there to dig for bones , &quot; he said . The archeological findings are no surprise , said Macko , who is waiting for the monthlong specific soil analyses to come_in . Soil samples could help determine diet , climate and other information , said Hurd . For instance , pollen could be found in soil taken from abdominal areas of the remains , indicating what season it was . Because Aliso Creek is used so extensively for flood_control drainage , much of its banks have been eroded and many of the bones were lost that way , Macko said . &quot; It ' s unfortunate the erosion results in more damage like this. &quot; Massey said he took_care not to break the law in terms of disturbing the sites where he first found the remains . He added that though he would n ' t want to see the remains disturbed for research , he regrets what won ' t be learned . &quot; The bones belong back in the ground , &quot; Massey said . &quot; But the information belongs_to everybody. &quot;</TEXT>
