   <HEADLINE> CAMERON MITCHELL ; MULTIFACETED ACTOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cameron Mitchell , veteran character_actor perhaps best remembered for his role as Happy in the stage and screen versions of &quot; Death of a Salesman , &quot; has died . He was 75 . Mitchell died of lung_cancer Wednesday night at his home_in Pacific Palisades , his son , Chip , and Mitchell ' s agent , Ronald Leif of Contemporary Artists Ltd. , said Thursday . &quot; A true actor isn ' t tagged . He isn ' t a heavy , a comic or a juvenile -- he can assume any personality the role demands and play it convincingly . Such a man is Cameron Mitchell , &quot; Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper wrote in 1952 . Mitchell did assume many personalities over nearly four decades in more_than 90 films and the television series &quot; High Chaparral. &quot; His films varied from Westerns to the serious &quot; Les Miserables &quot; in 1952 to the lighter &quot; How to Marry a Millionaire &quot; in 1953 to the role of Jigger in &quot; Carousel &quot; in 1956 . Other films included &quot; What Next , Corporal Hargrove ? &quot; and &quot; They Were Expendable , &quot; which marked his screen debut in 1945 ; also , &quot; Homecoming , &quot; &quot; Command Decision , &quot; &quot; Okinawa , &quot; &quot; Outcasts of Poker Flat , &quot; &quot; Powder River , &quot; &quot; Hell and High_Water , &quot; &quot; Garden of Evil , &quot; &quot; Desiree , &quot; &quot; Strange Lady in Town , &quot; &quot; Love Me or Leave Me , &quot; &quot; House of Bamboo , &quot; &quot; The Tall Men &quot; and &quot; All Mine to Give. &quot; In the 1960s , Mitchell worked mostly abroad , doing foreign-language films in Italy , France , Germany and Spain . He was cast in such roles as Julius Caesar , Harald the Viking and Cesare Borgia . Mitchell , a teetotaler , returned to Hollywood in 1967 to play drunken cowhand Buck Cannon in the NBC Western television series &quot; High Chaparral , &quot; which ran_for four years . &quot; I firmly believe that our show is the best of all_the Westerns , &quot; he told The Times at the outset of the Arizona-based series . &quot; There is nothing like it . It ' s not hip . I ' m sick_of hip -- it ' s old_style . The realism is wonderful . It ' s like it was. &quot; Mitchell became a student of Western lore and read widely on the history of Arizona . &quot; On location , where we do most of our shooting , &quot; he rhapsodized , &quot; I ' ve walked where Cochise actually walked the land . I ' ve talked to the people , some of the real pioneers of the West . For me , this series is not just a series , it ' s one long story. &quot; In the 1970s , Mitchell was in lesser films such_as &quot; Nightmare in Wax , &quot; &quot; Buck and the Preacher , &quot; &quot; The Klansmen , &quot; &quot; The Taste of the Savage , &quot; &quot; Viva Knievel ! &quot; and &quot; The Toolbox Murders. &quot; He said he no longer cared to be in movies , noting during his television stint : &quot; Thank God I worked with the great ones : Gable , Cooper , Power . The respect , mystique and imagination are gone from the movies . The old movies were better . Today they ' re junk. &quot; Mitchell ' s fortune took a downturn along with his career , and he twice filed for bankruptcy , in 1965 and in 1974 . Mitchell was born in Dallastown , Pa. , and grew_up in Shrewsbury , Pa. , the son of a minister . He began his career on Broadway and served as a bombardier in World_War_II before he moved to Los Angeles to work in films . &quot; He isn ' t handsome . He isn ' t one of the lucky-break boys or the overnight flashes , &quot; Hopper said in the early 1950s when Mitchell was getting his most_desirable roles . &quot; Cam has gotten there the hard way over an uphill , obstacle-ridden course. &quot; In addition to his son , Charles ( Chip ) Mitchell , the actor is survived by his wife , Johanna , five other children -- Fred , Camille , Jake , Jono and Katie , and five grandchildren . Funeral services will be private . The family said a public memorial service will be scheduled within a month .</TEXT>
