   <TEXT> * Robert Kurtz ' s letter ( Dec . 29 ) suggests he was either misinformed or he misunderstood how taxes on Social_Security benefits are appropriated.Income taxes on Social_Security benefits are deposited into the Social_Security retirement and survivors ( OASI ) trust_fund . Taxation of Social_Security benefits for some recipients will increase from 50 % to 85 % after 1993 . Taxes on the increase ( 35 % ) are deposited into the Medicare trust_fund which , combined with the 1.45 % Social_Security tax ( FICA ) , pays_for hospital benefits under Medicare . Treatment of taxes resulting from the initial 50 % will not change after 1993 -- these taxes will continue to be deposited into the OASI trust_fund . WANDA H .
