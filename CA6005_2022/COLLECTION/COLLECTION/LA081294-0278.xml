   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : EUROPE BUMPS UP RATES , THROWING INVESTORS A CURVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Federal_Reserve_Board ' s inflation paranoia appears to be catching_on , and it ' s making_for another round of misery in_stock and bond markets worldwide . In a shocker Thursday , the central_banks of Sweden and Italy separately raised short-term interest_rates -- the first increases in European short rates since autumn of 1992 . Predictably , stock prices tumbled in Europe and long-term bond yields soared on the news . In language all too familiar to Americans this year , both the Swedes and the Italians cited the need for higher rates to head_off inflation as the world economy picks_up steam . Internal politics also may be guiding the authorities at Sweden ' s Riksbank and at the Bank of Italy : The budget_deficits of both countries have been ballooning , and the central_banks are trying to make clear to their governments that the price of continued heavy deficit financing will be higher interest_rates , economists say . Still , there is enough strength in the European economy this summer to make the inflation concerns of the Riksbank and the Bank of Italy believable . Believable , if not justifiable in the eyes of many global investors . * Indeed , just as critics of the U.S. Fed have contended that Chairman Alan Greenspan sees inflation where it doesn ' t exist , many investors in European stocks argued Thursday that the Swedes and Italians are jumping the gun , endangering an economic recovery that began only this year . Higher rates &quot; just don ' t make any sense from an economic point_of_view , &quot; said Malcolm Clinger , chief investment officer for Swiss Bank Corp. ' s private banking unit in New York . David Peebles , manager of the USAA Investment International stock fund in San Antonio , also expressed surprise at the rate hikes and noted what the disheartening outcome is likely to be : an end to what had been widespread expectations that European interest_rates could still move lower this year , especially in the key economies of Germany and France . In theory , rates in Europe are already too high , given the Continent ' s generally low inflation_rates and high unemployment_rates , the latter a seeming guarantee that huge labor surpluses exist and will keep wage inflation nonexistent in Europe . Until the Swedes and Italians made their moves Thursday , investors like Peebles had been betting_on European stocks in part because the interest_rate outlook appeared favorable at best and neutral at worst , especially compared to the rising-rate environment of the United States . Now , some global investors admit they must rethink Europe if higher interest_rates are coming this soon in an economic recovery . British stocks may be most vulnerable , because Britain is further along than the Continent in recovery and thus more prone to inflationary pressures and rising rates . &quot; We will be cutting_back our U.K. stock holdings &quot; today , Clinger said . But is a turn_in European short-term interest_rates enough to bring_on a full-blown bear_market in_stocks there ? On that question , the U.S. experience may be a good model . While the U.S. market has been in turmoil this year , most broad stock indexes are off only marginally measured since Jan . 1 . And while it hasn ' t been easy to make money in U.S. stocks as interest_rates have risen , savvy stock pickers have done_it . Most European markets are already down more this year than the U.S. market , correcting some of last year ' s surge . From here , some pros say the right approach to European stocks is to view that economy in the same light as the U.S. economy : It ' s growing , and it will continue to grow even as the central_banks work their sorcery with interest_rates . A recession soon is not in the cards . That means European corporate earnings will rise into 1995 , assuring there should always be something for stock investors to get excited about -- if only during interest_rate lulls . Anthony Cragg , manager of the Strong International Stock fund in Milwaukee , says an interest_rate turn_in Europe means &quot; we ' re past the point of buying lousy companies for a turnaround &quot; -- a relatively easy game , he notes . Now the turnaround is here , and stock picking gets much tougher , Cragg says . For global mutual_fund managers , this is when the true pros are separated from the amateurs and pretenders . The Rate Conundrum European short-term interest rates--already well above U.S. rates--are rising again , though inflation remains low in Europe and the unemployment_rate is sky-high . 04 # 15 , 12 # 11 , 11 Short-term interest Inflation Unemploy .
