   <TEXT> Most letters to the editor refer to published accounts in The Times , but I am writing_about a flagrant omission . In the Academy Awards , Deborah Kerr was the only star awarded a career Oscar , but , except for a blurb in the briefs section of Calendar in January when it was originally announced , The Times has ignored this long-overdue tribute to one of the major stars of the ' 40s , ' 50s and ' 60s and arguably one of the most respected . Calendar devoted an enormous amount of space on Sunday , March 20 , amounting to pages and pages chock-a-block full of stories , including the views of small community film critics , acting coaches , the White_House screening room upholstery , and a myriad of trivial tidbits about Oscar history , but apparently no room for six-time nominee Deborah Kerr . There was even an article about the academy ' s love_affair with British actors , but no room for Deborah . In the coverage of the ceremony itself on March 22 , there was nothing about her tentative moments upon being introduced , then coming_alive , bringing a roar of laughter from the audience when she demonstrated her not oft-known sense_of_humor . Nothing about the strong , clear , lyrical voice that is still there which in a minute and half eloquently and passionately expressed her thanks . And nothing about the longest standing_ovation of the evening . Longer than Newman ' s , longer than Hanks ' , and , yes , even longer than Spielberg ' s . The folks at Calendar definitely dropped the ball on this one . MICHAEL RUSSNOW West Hollywood An article on Deborah Kerr and her career appeared in Calendar on March 21 . * I am very curious as_to the reception of the past two best actress Oscar winners , Emma Thompson and Holly Hunter . Why were there no standing_ovations for these women when the men , Al Pacino and Tom Hanks , each received a rousing standing_ovation ? Why were these women neglected the same honor ? Furthermore , when Emma Thompson delivered an acceptance speech that was beautifully eloquent , the audience responded with polite applause . Why do these strong , successful women not get the same treatment as men ? PRUDENCE HORNE San Diego * David Gritten ' s article &quot; Rue , Brittanica &quot; was written tongue in cheek , I hope . It would be reasonable to assume that Britain would be proud_of their illustrious actors who are perennially nominated for the Academy Award and very often win . There are no finer performers than Emma Thompson , Daniel Day-Lewis , Jeremy Irons and Kenneth Branagh . And of course , Anthony Hopkins is in a class by himself because he overcame personal traumas to win the Brits ' respect and admiration . According to Gritten , the others did the unforgivable . They attained fame early on without struggles with drug_addiction or alcoholism . We in America also idolize the stars are who difficult and troubled . And scandal always enhances their bankability . We &quot; reward &quot; them for being colorful and for selling tabloids , newspapers , movie and TV_shows . If the tabloids are able to convince the Brits that Day-Lewis really is mentally unbalanced , they may acknowledge that he truly is one of the great actors of our time . Meanwhile , he can laugh all_the way to the bank and the Oscars . SADI HAYASHI Van Nuys * Regarding screenings in the White_House movie_theater , you neglected to mention that President Eisenhower ' s all-time favorite movie was 1952 ' s &quot; Angels in the Outfield , &quot; written by my mother , Dorothy Kingsley , and George Wells , directed by Clarence Brown , and screened at the White_House 11 times ! Now &quot; Angels &quot; has been remade by Disney and will be released this summer . I doubt if President Clinton will screen the new version more_than once , but no doubt he could use some angelic help right now . TERRY KINGSLEY-SMITH Los Angeles * What makes you think Kalle Matso and Scott White represent the &quot; twentysomething culture &quot; ? I don ' t want to insult them or anything but I ' m in my mid-40s and I found their perspective on the Oscars wonderfully refreshing . What I can ' t explain is how I can identify with both sides of opposing points_of_view . These two guys have a balance of irreverence and conservatism that makes me laugh . Let ' s see their act more often . JERRY HASSON Los Angeles * I miss the Academy Awards of yesteryear when there was an air of mystery before &quot; the Big Night. &quot; Nowadays , when the newspapers and television announce the winners days ahead , the whole event loses its appeal . I , for one , had hoped the media was wrong . I hoped that &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; would win . That film is , in my opinion , perfect ! Spielberg and his film won because the voters felt that Spielberg deserved an award after all this while . The film is just another Jewish Holocaust story . CECILIA KELLY Encinitas * Kenneth Turan ' s comment that the three Asian films up for the best foreign-language film Oscar &quot; look_to cancel one another out &quot; ( &quot; Oskar ' s Race Is All but Over , &quot; March 20 ) reflects the subconscious racism that permeates Hollywood . Did he say this because all Asians are supposed to look alike , hence , all their films ? Would Turan have made the same remark if there had been three films from Europe in competition ? Would films from Italy , France and Poland cancel each other out because they were all made by Caucasians ? As a working screenwriter who has been asked to &quot; de-ethnicize &quot; his scripts to facilitate casting , the Eurocentric take of the academy and the powers-that-be in this town continues to gripe me . There are fabulous films being made in Asia , and Asian Americans have a lot to contribute to our industry , if given the chance . The notion that &quot; the squeaky wheel gets the grease &quot; is foreign in the acculturation of Asians , but my advice to them is to start squeaking , and loudly . Maybe studio executives , casting agents and people like Turan will hear . EDWARD KOVACH Los Angeles * In your March 20 interview with Robert Wise , he explains the paucity of top actresses in the current market : &quot; That whole ability for a woman to carry a picture is gone -- because of such an emphasis over the years on these action pictures. &quot; For the record , Mr. Wise , there are quite a_few women who are asking_for leading roles in these action pictures -- and countless more women who are writing action scripts . Sooner or later , one of the men who has the power to &quot; green-light &quot; a project will have the courage to make an action film written by women for women from a woman ' s point_of_view . Not only will that place women back on the box-office lists , but it might be just what ' s needed to revitalize a genre whose market impact is waning . CATHERINE CLINCH Los Angeles</TEXT>
