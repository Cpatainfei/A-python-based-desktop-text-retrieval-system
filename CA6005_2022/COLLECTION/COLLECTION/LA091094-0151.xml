   <HEADLINE> IT ' S NO . 1 VS . NO . 2 FOR WOMEN ' S TITLE ; TENNIS : GRAF DEFEATS NOVOTNA AND SANCHEZ VICARIO DOWNS SABATINI IN U.S. OPEN SEMIFINALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In two tense women ' s semifinals at the U.S. Open on Friday , when the going got_tough and the collars got tight , Steffi Graf and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario were able to draw unimpeded breaths and play unimpeded tennis . And so today ' s final will match the top players in this tournament ' s seedings , and in the world . No . 1 Graf of Germany , already the winner of 15 Grand_Slam event titles , will be going_after another against No . 2 Sanchez Vicario of Spain , already the winner of two . Graf played with her usual iron will in a 6-3 , 7-5 victory over Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic , the seventh-seeded player here . Graf trailed in the second set , 2-5 and 15-40 , and fought_back into the set and , eventually , the match . Sanchez Vicario , beaten by Graf in this year ' s Australian final but the winner of the_French after Mary Pierce had upset Graf , also steeled herself to the tension and the windy conditions on Stadium Court in a 6-1 , 7-6 ( 8-6 ) victory over Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina , the No . 8-seeded player here . Sanchez Vicario lost two match_points at 5-4 of the second set , then fought_off a set_point for Sabatini in the tiebreaker before closing out the match with a reflex lob volley that Sabatini , strangely , chased down and tried to return by hitting the ball between her legs , her back to the net . &quot; I could have just hit it normal but I just went_for it , &quot; Sabatini said . If this was an unusual way to end a Grand_Slam semifinal match , or any match for that matter , then these semifinals had lots of unusual elements . Novotna seemed to be in fine shape to win the second set , when Graf stepped to the service line at 2-5 and 15-40 and spun in a 79-m.p.h. second serve . Novotna netted it . At 30-40 , Novotna hit a forehand long . After two deuces , Novotna got set_point No . 3 , and hit a lob long . When questioned about her nerves in that situation she said : &quot; I missed the forehand return , then I make the easy error , but after that , she passed me , she did great . There was nothing I could do. &quot; Then Novotna , serving at 5-3 , was broken quickly at 15-40 , putting Graf back on serve . Graf accomplished the break by starting the game with a net-cord passing-shot winner and got the 15-all point with an incredible running forehand cross-court passing_shot that left Novotna so devastated that she netted two forehands for the break . Soon , similarities of the 1993 Novotna-Graf Wimbledon final began coming_to_mind . In that memorable match , Novotna , serving in the third set at 4-1 and 40-30 , double-faulted that point and appeared to fall_apart the rest of the way , eventually crying on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent during the awards ceremony . Here , serving at 5-5 , Novotna hit a second serve into the net at 74 m.p.h , got passed_by Graf for love-30 , and followed with two more double faults , the second a feeble shank off the frame of her racket that had so little velocity it didn ' t even register on the speed gun . &quot; I was not getting tense at all , &quot; Novotna said . &quot; I think it was very windy conditions today. &quot; Graf , apparently able to get more of that wind down her throat in key situations , then served out the match -- after Novotna , fighting hard to the end , saved one match_point before succumbing to yet another big inside-out forehand by Graf . Graf , asked if thoughts of that ' 93 Wimbledon final had come_to_mind while she watched Novotna hit three double faults in one game , said , &quot; Like when guys are always saying choking , you know , I don ' t think it happened . Definitely not until 5-all , but OK , she makes three double faults , that is really difficult. &quot; A similar tension problem appeared to affect Sabatini . She hit nine double faults , made 48 unforced errors and won only 34 % of the points on her second serve . Nerves seemed to bother her most seriously in the tiebreaker , when she hit a 62-m.p.h. first serve on set_point at 6-5 , then followed that with a 67-m.p.h. first serve when she lost the 6-5 point . Both times , Sanchez Vicario used the soft serves to take_control of the point and hit backhand winners . And then , there was the ill-fated match_point , the between-the-legs shot by Sabatini that looked_like something the Jensen brothers would try_out on Court 22 purely for crowd reaction . Sanchez Vicario ' s reaction was quite simple . &quot; I would not do that at match_point , &quot; she said . &quot; Or any other time. &quot; Tennis Notes In one of the strangest endings to an important moment in Grand_Slam doubles , the top-seeded women ' s team of Gigi Fernandez and Natalie Zvereva , seeking a sweep of the Grand_Slam titles this year , lost in the semifinals to the unseeded team of Katerina Maleeva and Robin White , 7-6 ( 7-2 ) , 1-6 , 6-3 . Maleeva was serving at 5-3 and 30-love of the final game when the rains came . After about a 1 1 / 2-hour delay , they returned , and Maleeva got the game to 40-love before Zvereva and Fernandez fought_back to 40-30 . Then , Maleeva hit a first serve near the line , Fernandez shanked a return that went barely two feet in front of her -- and stood stunned as the line_judge called the serve good . Last year , Zvereva and Fernandez also won the first three Grand_Slam doubles titles of the year and then lost in the semifinals of the U.S. Open . Meilen Tu , the junior player from Northridge who won a spot in the main draw and lost in a tough first-round match , got_through to the semifinals of the junior girls ' draw . Tu , who won the U.S. Tennis Assn. ' s girls ' 18 title earlier in the year to gain the wild-card spot in the main draw , beat Tara Snyder , 0-6 , 6-4 , 6-4 . Tu , of Granada Hills High , who won ' t turn 17 until January , is seeded fourth among the junior girls here . * MEN ' S SEMIFINALS Unseeded Andre Agassi continues his spirited run at the U.S. Open today when he plays Todd Martin .
