   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; QUIET ALGERIAN AWAITS HIS CUE IN HAITI ; DIPLOMACY : LAKDHAR BRAHIMI , BOUTROS-GHALI ' S TROUBLE-SHOOTER , WILL BE IN CHARGE WHEN U.N. PEACEKEEPERS TAKE_OVER FROM THE UNITED STATES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When U.N. peacekeepers take_over the Haiti mission from the United States in six months or so , the most powerful foreign official in Haiti will be an ascetic-looking , soft-spoken Algerian who has become Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ' s favorite trouble-shooter . As Boutros-Ghali ' s new special representative for Haiti , 60-year-old Lakdhar Brahimi has a title that sounds innocuous . But his is the single most important post in any U.N. peacekeeping mission . Brahimi , a former Algerian foreign_minister , will be in_charge of the entire operation , with the authority even to veto decisions by the military commander of the 6 # 000 troops in the U.N. mission . In a little more_than a year , Brahimi , who is not a regular U.N. bureaucrat , has served Boutros-Ghali as a special envoy or special representative to Zaire , South_Africa , Yemen and Liberia . Although his work is completed only in South_Africa , Brahimi will give_up all other duties and devote himself entirely to Haiti . American officials worked with him closely in Zaire as he tried to mediate a bitter political conflict that was pushing the country close to chaos . His work draws high praise from U.S. diplomats . &quot; Brahimi had a significant impact in getting the parties together , &quot; said an admiring U.S. official . The only complaint from the Americans was that Boutros-Ghali , in their view , sent Brahimi off to other trouble spots too soon . The appointment of Brahimi signifies a reversal of policy for Boutros-Ghali in organizing a U.N. mission that will take_over from the American-run mission . In Somalia , the only precedent , Boutros-Ghali gave_in to American pressure and appointed an American as special representative -- retired Adm . Jonathan Howe , personally selected for the job by U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake . When the Somalia mission turned_into a debacle , officials in Washington put all_the blame on Boutros-Ghali , even though he had given Howe full rein to run things in Mogadishu . In Haiti , Boutros-Ghali has clearly put his own man in_charge . According to U.N. sources , the Clinton_Administration is pressuring the secretary_general to put an American commander in_charge of the military_force . U.S. troops are expected to make_up half the total force . Boutros-Ghali , according to these same sources , was strongly against this several weeks ago because he did not want the U.N. peacekeeping mission to be confused with any American military operation that invaded Haiti forcibly . Now that Americans have landed in Haiti peacefully , the sources said , Boutros-Ghali is more amenable to the idea of naming an American military commander . Brahimi is looked_on as a leading practitioner of what the U.N. calls &quot; preventive diplomacy &quot; -- the art of negotiating a settlement before a conflict breaks_out rather than afterward . Perhaps that is why he is so little known in the United States . He is not a high-profile U.N. official . &quot; Diplomacy is at its very , very best in preventive diplomacy , &quot; Brahimi said in a recent interview . &quot; The best that can happen to you is that no one notices what you do . And since nobody sees anything , why should anyone say thank_you ? When a problem appears , then you have failed. &quot; Brahimi has had a long and distinguished diplomatic career . He served as Algeria ' s foreign_minister from 1991 to 1993 and began his diplomatic work , in fact , during the Algerian war of independence , acting_as the ambassador to Southeast_Asia of the National Liberation Front from 1956 to 1961 . Later , the newly independent Algerian government named him ambassador to Egypt and then to Britain . From 1981 to 1984 , he was the diplomatic adviser to Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid . From 1984 to 1991 , he was the undersecretary general of the League of Arab States . Boutros-Ghali named him special envoy to Zaire in July , 1993 ; special representative to South_Africa in December , 1993 ; special envoy to Yemen in June , 1994 , and a special envoy to Liberia in July , 1994 . In dealing with the problems in many countries where he served , Brahimi said he faced limitations . &quot; All you have is your personal skill and some moral authority , &quot; he said . &quot; I have no money and no army. &quot;</TEXT>
