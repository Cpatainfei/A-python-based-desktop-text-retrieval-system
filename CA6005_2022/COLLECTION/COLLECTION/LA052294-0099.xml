   <HEADLINE> A DANCE WITH DEATH ; THE FALLACY OF THE SMOKING BAN IS THAT IT ' S A FUTILE ATTEMPT TO AVOID THE INEVITABLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Why are we so preoccupied by the dangers of smoking ? At a time when polls indicate an increasing number of Americans would legalize drugs , when every sort of behavior is justified on the after noon talk_shows , smokers are outcasts . At a time when death may be the price to be paid_for a careless night of sex , the hotel_clerk will ask you if you want a nonsmoking room . Earlier in this century , some Americans tried to keep other Americans from alcohol . Within the fierce Puritan moralism of the temperance movement , one , nonetheless , sensed a generous notion of commonwealth -- fear that alcohol was bad for the entire society . Today ' s civic morality is different to the degree that it seems justified by self-concern : &quot; I don ' t care what some jerk does to his own lungs . Just don ' t expect me to breathe his secondhand smoke. &quot; As the quality of our lives seems to be diminishing , when there is no more clean air , clean air becomes a right . My space is my space . Americans end_up shooting one another over parking_spaces . We used to speak_of the inevitability of life and death . We used to bend to a sense of fate and construct our morality within an acceptance of life ' s limits . Today , as the world around us seems so out of control , the sense of inevitability is replaced by notions of &quot; choice. &quot; We choose when to give_birth , we choose when to die , precisely because we feel ourselves unable to control random death . Polls show growing support for Dr. Jack Ke- vorkian and &quot; the right to suicide , &quot; although smoking is not allowed inside our restaurants . Thank_you for not smoking . Not so many decades ago , ladies did not smoke in public . It took a great First_Lady , Eleanor Roosevelt , to break the taboo . At almost the same moment in American history , in &quot; Now Voyager , &quot; Paul Henreid lit a pair of cigarettes in his mouth , then handed one to Bette Davis . One did not need a Freudian handbook to understand that cigarettes in the movies were all about sex . But if it is true that cigarettes are sexual , then what does today ' s repugnance regarding cigarettes mean ? Was the rise of the anti-smoking movement in the 1970s related to the increased use of the birth-control pill in those same years ? Certainly , smoking in America used to be associated with sociability -- a cocktail glass , a cigarette -- these were social tools . The cigarette was a means of loosening conversation , laughter . Now , we send the smoker outside while the rest of us talk . The &quot; smoke-filled room &quot; is today associated by many Americans with corruption and deceit . But smoking used to be associated with intense human_activity , parties and laughter , and also intense concentration and solitude . A smoker confides to me that his habit is a tool of concentration , a means of discipline . ( &quot; I light a cigarette before making a phone call. &quot; ) Thus was Paul Henreid related to the solitary Marlboro Man . The cigarette was both urbane and Western . Today , smoking is only a private pleasure . Another smoker confesses : &quot; So many awful behaviors my cigarette keeps under_control . Smoking is such a privacy . A lovely deception . It steadies my hand . Too_bad it will probably kill me. &quot; Even as American pop culture moves_into parts of the world where it is regarded_as morally contaminating , Americans are also internationally famous for a preoccupation with health . For decades , Americans have been famous for our obsession . No more so than in California . No more so than now . In California , people do not die . We pass_away . We do not grow old -- we get plastic_surgery . California ' s contribution to the culinary_arts is haute hygiene . But I am beginning to think that the old cliche about the American fear of death needs to be readjusted . In 1994 , I do not think that Americans look too_little at death . Rather , I think we are overwhelmed by death , death everywhere around us . Children are gunning each other down on the playground . Women are being snatched from shopping-mall parking_lots and murdered . There is carnage -- three people dead -- on the San Diego Freeway this morning . Earlier in the century , Evelyn Waugh and Aldous Huxley wrote satirically of the Californian evasion of death . They were British and mocked our evasion for being characteristically American . But , as a boy , I was in_love with California precisely because it refused to acknowledge death . I was happy that California was so distant from the morbidity of Mexico . The ancient sadness of my family ' s mournful Catholic statues , the darkness that rang in Mexican laughter . Now , Los Angeles seems a city of death , so different from the city I used to love . And life has become a burden , a sorrow . Yet , California is not becoming infused with a sense of Catholic sadness as much as with a pagan stoicism . In the bookstores today , you can find best_sellers about a happier afterlife . ( Your lover is waiting for you on the other side of death ' s divide. ) Also near the top of the best-seller list is a book called &quot; How We Die. &quot; The ancient conversation human_beings have with God begins with the question &quot; Why do we live only to die ? &quot; But in 1994 , we seek consolation in another question . Not &quot; why &quot; but &quot; how. &quot; We do not talk to God anymore . Today , all we know is the body -- how it works and , finally , stops . We are not troubled by mystery ; we seek to control . We are interested in Oprah Winfrey ' s new diet book , which promises us french fries without calories . Health replaces holiness in today ' s America . It is not possible to turn_on the evening news without encountering a resident TV physician or &quot; health reporter. &quot; And the news is dire : Beware movie-theater popcorn . There is danger within the shrouded cube of margarine . A man I know who was , two years ago , a drug_addict is now &quot; clean. &quot; He works as a personal trainer . He has a heroic body ; he can tell you what to eat and not to eat ; he takes enemas weekly ; he doesn ' t smoke . He drinks bottle after bottle of mineral_water . And wasn ' t that a lovely joke in &quot; The Player , &quot; Robert Altman ' s movie satire on Hollywood ? How Altman ' s vision of Hollywood was of a corrupt gang of agents and producers and writers . Our hero , who was also a murderer , was obsessed by water , imported water . Water from some clean locale like Switzerland . Water instead of food . Water instead of sacramental confession . In an America that consumes water , is consumed by the need for cleansing , it is not odd that so_much attention is given to the dangers of smoking . Oh , do not misunderstand . I am no apologist for the R.J. Reynolds Company . I hate the stench of old smoke on my sofa , on hair , on clothes , on lips . I wish the person I love most in the world would quit smoking . But I also understand when another friend remembers her grandfather dying of emphysema . &quot; God , how he wanted a cigarette -- even on his last day. &quot; The old_man , wheezing , begged for a smoke . But no one would oblige , except his granddaughter . She took the old_man ' s $ 5 and went_to the store and bought him a pack . &quot; Give a rat enough of anything , and the rat ' s going_to die , &quot; says one smoker . Sometimes , I think the reason I like being with smokers , enjoy their throaty laugh , their Dorothy Parker lack of sentimentality , is they are the only ones prepared to tell the truth about the inevitability of death and life in America .</TEXT>
