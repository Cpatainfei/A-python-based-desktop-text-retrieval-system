   <HEADLINE> THE TIMES POLL ; ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION PROP . 187 KEEPS 2-TO-1 EDGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With California voters increasingly convinced that illegal immigration is one of the major problems facing the state , Proposition 187 , the emotionally divisive anti-illegal immigration initiative , continues to hold a strong lead in the Los Angeles Times Poll . Less than a month before the election , the get-tough measure is favored by a margin of 59 % to 33 % among likely voters -- a 26-point margin . Among all registered voters , the split is 61 % to 32 % . The margin was 33 points among likely voters in mid-September , when the Times Poll reported a 62 % to 29 % lead . Registered voters were split by a similar margin . With the campaign heating_up , interest in Proposition 187 is now as high as it is for the governor ' s race between Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown and Republican incumbent Pete Wilson , whose opposition to illegal immigration is a hallmark of his reelection bid . Moreover , nearly twice as_many registered voters said Proposition 187 would motivate them to cast ballots as would the U.S. Senate_race between Democratic incumbent Sen . Dianne Feinstein and Republican Rep . Mike Huffington . Despite the efforts of a wide-scale coalition of mainstream education , health and law_enforcement organizations to defeat the measure , Proposition 187 continues to win majority support among Democrats as well as Republicans , and voters of both sexes and all age_groups and income levels . Although some of the staunchest opposition to the measure has come from Cardinal Roger M . Mahony and organized labor_leaders , poll results suggest that they have had limited influence . The initiative is favored 56 % to 37 % among Catholic voters and 55 % to 34 % among union_members . The Times Poll found that arguments against the measure seemed to have little impact on voter attitudes . Support for Proposition 187 remained steady after three pro and three con arguments were read to poll respondents . If anything , pro-187 arguments appeared to sway voters more_than such anti-187 arguments as the possibility of a public health hazard because illegal immigrants would be denied immunizations against communicable_diseases . &quot; Many people have made_up their minds , &quot; said Assistant Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus . Pinkus cautioned that about one-third of voters remain unfamiliar_with the details of Proposition 187 -- which would terminate most government services to illegal immigrants and require local health , education and law_enforcement officials to turn_in the names of suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities . Among likely voters who were familiar_with Proposition 187 , the margin of support is 45 % to 25 % . A second high-profile , send-a-message measure , the &quot; three strikes &quot; crime initiative , also continues to draw strong support in the Times Poll . Proposition 184 , which calls_for prison_terms of 25 years to life for third-time felony offenders , is favored by a 58 % -32 % margin among likely voters . But Proposition 186 , which calls_for a state-run health system , has failed to find a constituency . More_than 50 % of likely voters are unfamiliar_with the single-payer health initiative when just read the ballot label . When they were read a synopsis , the split against it was 64 % to 25 % . The closest race among the major November initiatives involves Proposition 188 , the tobacco industry-backed measure to establish statewide regulations on smoking restrictions . Half of likely voters said they were familiar_with the measure and those voters split 3 to 2 against Proposition 188 . After being read an explanation summarized from the ballot pamphlet mailed to all California voters , likely voters favored it by a 49 % to 43 % margin . The summary read to poll respondents , like the title and summary in the state ' s ballot pamphlet , does not make clear that one of the prime backers of the initiative is tobacco giant Philip Morris . Political analysts believe that voters would be more likely to reject the measure , which would repeal local no-smoking laws , if they knew of its backing from the tobacco_industry . The Times Poll , conducted by telephone Oct . 8 through Tuesday , questioned 1 # 232 registered voters , 821 of whom are considered to be likely to vote Nov . 8 . The poll ' s margin of sampling error for registered voters is 3 percentage_points in either direction . For likely voters it is 4 points in either direction . Margins of error for smaller subgroups of voters may be larger . The poll ' s results make clear that illegal immigration , which has begun receiving widespread attention in news_stories , editorials and in TV ads touting Wilson ' s reelection bid , is a hot topic among Californians . Among all registered voters , more people cited illegal immigration than either education or the economy as the state ' s most pressing issue . Only crime and unemployment ranked higher . In a Times Poll last month , crime also was cited as the state ' s most important problem . But unemployment , the economy , education and immigration were all clustered together far behind . Last month , only 6 % of voters in The Times Poll said Proposition 187 would particularly motivate them to cast ballots -- compared to 19 % for the governor ' s race . In the new poll , the ballot measure and the governor ' s race each were cited by 19 % of registered voters . Among the 19 % motivated to vote by Proposition 187 , 58 % favor the initiative and 40 % oppose it . Support for Proposition 187 is particularly strong among Republican voters -- 75 % to 19 % -- andwhite voters -- 64 % to 28 % . But the measure also continues to lead among Democrats -- 52 % to 40 % -- and independents -- 57 % to 34 % . The only two major blocs of registered voters not favoring Proposition 187 are liberal Democrats , opposed by a 51 % -44 % margin , and Latinos , who opposed it by a small margin ( 48 % to 46 % ) . Last month , registered Latinos favored the measure by a 52 % -42 % margin . In recent interviews , leading opponents of Proposition 187 have said they are convinced they can still turn public_opinion around if they can raise enough money to mount a significant statewide advertising_campaign . Earlier this week , an anti-Proposition 187 coalition that includes the state PTA , school_boards association and teachers association , began running its first radio spot attacking the ballot measure . However , The Times Poll , seeking to gauge the influence of various pro and con arguments , found no significant shift in support after six arguments were read to poll respondents . Before the arguments were read , likely voters favored the measure 59 % to 33 % . After the arguments were read , the margin was 60 % to 32 % . &quot; The arguments made no impact , &quot; Pinkus said . &quot; They reinforced people voting for Proposition 187. &quot; The strongest argument in favor of the measure was one stating it would save the state millions of dollars a year by stopping illegal immigrants from getting health , education and child welfare benefits . Nearly 60 % of likely voters said that argument would make them more likely to vote for Proposition 187 . In contrast , an argument that the initiative might cost California billions of dollars in federal aid since some of its provisions violate federal law resulted in only 26 % of likely voters saying they were less likely to vote for the ballot measure . Pro-187 arguments that illegal immigration is hurting California and that the initiative would require law_enforcement agencies to check the immigrant status of those arrested for crimes each led more_than 50 % of poll respondents to say they were more likely to vote for the measure . Anti-187 arguments that the measure could cause a public health hazard and an increase in juvenile crime if hundreds of thousands of children are ejected from public_schools led far fewer voters -- roughly one-third in each case -- to say they were less likely to cast ballots for the measure . &quot; I realize we ' re talking_about kids and I have grandkids and great-grandkids myself , &quot; said poll respondent Albert Brower , 80 , of Sacramento . &quot; But I ' m against a wide-open door to the welfare business in our state . &quot; I pretty much have got my mind made_up , &quot; said Brower , a Baptist minister and a registered Republican . A Catholic Toluca Lake resident said he favors Proposition 187 regardless of the position of Mahony and many personal friends . &quot; Anyone in this country illegally should get nothing , &quot; said the 43-year-old travel_agent . However , some poll respondents who favor Proposition 187 said they are open-minded . &quot; My kids losing almost all_of their school programs because the state of California has no money is a big swayer for me , &quot; said Marilyn Bailey , 39 , a printer from Visalia . &quot; But one thing I hadn ' t heard about before was the lack of immunizations for illegals . &quot; I may change my mind , &quot; said Bailey , a Democrat . &quot; My goodness , I don ' t want new babies to go without shots. &quot; THE TIMES POLL How They Would Vote The anti-illegal immigration initiative , Proposition 187 , continues to hold a strong lead among likely California voters .
