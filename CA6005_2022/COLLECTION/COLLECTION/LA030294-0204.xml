   <HEADLINE> GAS CO . EMPLOYEES APPROVE CONTRACT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a highly visible campaign , the unions representing most Southern California Gas Co . employees have voted to accept a new contract that includes the provision union leaders had most hotly contested : a company proposal that could lead to the use of outside contractors to replace some full-time employees , including meter readers . Sixty percent of participating union_members voted to accept the two-year contract.It includes an immediate 0.25 % raise , a 2.5 % raise effective April 1 and a 3 % raise a year later . Contract negotiations broke_down in August , primarily over plans by the utility to increase efficiency in various departments . Union leaders said that could include replacing up_to 1 # 100 current employees with contract personnel . Union employees staged a one-day strike Oct . 1 , but members voted_in December and January against longer strikes . &quot; I think everyone is happy to get this behind us , &quot; said Joyce Rowland , Gas Co . manager of labor relations . Rowland said workers and union and company representatives have been meeting to find cost-saving improvements but that some goals may be difficult to reach . She estimated that the company wants to save 45 % of the costs attributed to meter_reading , a task that employs 450 people . Union leaders say their members were afraid to vote against the contract . &quot; The company just killed us to death with threats to replace the workers , &quot; said Janet Jones , secretary-treasurer of Local 132 of the Utility Workers Union of America , which led the negotiations for union locals representing 6 # 000 of the company ' s 9 # 200 employees .</TEXT>
