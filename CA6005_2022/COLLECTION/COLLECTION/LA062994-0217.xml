   <HEADLINE> PRINCE CHARLES RAISES HACKLES WITH TV DOCUMENTARY ; BRITAIN : IN PROGRAM AIRING TONIGHT , HE REPORTEDLY ADMITS TO ADULTERY AND SAYS , AS KING , HE WOULD DROP THE TITLE ' DEFENDER OF THE FAITH. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prince Charles , heir to the_British throne , has created a whirlwind of controversy by his outspoken participation in a television documentary that is scheduled to air tonight but excerpts of which have already been leaked . The 2 1 / 2-hour program , with broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby , is frank to an unprecedented degree , with the prince reportedly admitting for the first time to committing adultery during his marriage to Princess Diana . He also says in the documentary , marking the 25th anniversary of his investiture as Prince of Wales , that he wants to end the sovereign ' s role as head of the Church_of_England . He suggests this by noting that , if he became king , he would drop his traditional royal description as &quot; defender of the faith , &quot; meaning the Church_of_England . He sees himself , instead , as a defender of all faiths in Britain . Several religious commentators have criticized this view and said that it puts him at_odds with the Establishment as well as his mother , Queen Elizabeth_II . The transcript of the documentary has been closely held , but one version was leaked to Independent Television_News . Buckingham Palace and ITN say the final version is still subject_to last-minute editing . But in the program , Dimbleby reportedly asks Charles , 45 , whether he was faithful to the princess . He answers &quot; Yes , &quot; pauses and adds , &quot; until it became clear that the marriage had irretrievably broken down. &quot; There is no direct mention of Camilla Parker-Bowles , the woman with whom the prince is said to have conducted a long affair ; an intimate telephone_conversation between the two , with embarrassing sexual exchanges , was intercepted in 1989 . Neither the prince nor Parker-Bowles has denied conducting that conversation . The prince , in the documentary , reportedly does refer to Parker-Bowles and her husband , Brig . Andrew Parker-Bowles , as &quot; dear friends. &quot; But it is unclear when he thinks his marriage broke_down . A raft of books and articles suggest that Charles maintained a close relationship with Parker-Bowles from the earliest days of his marriage . Popular speculation long has held that their relationship was a central reason for the breakup of his marriage , officially announced 18 months ago . Princess Diana has reportedly told friends that her marriage was over , almost from the start , when she found that Charles was still in contact with Parker-Bowles , whom he had escorted before their engagement . The princess has also indicated to friends that they had not shared a bed since 1987 . Later in the program , the prince , asked about the breakdown of his marriage , is said to have grown irritated and snapped : &quot; Look , come_on . It happens to half the country and it happened to me . It is not something I wanted to happen. &quot; Some Anglican churchmen , including George Austin , Archdeacon of York , have insisted that an heir to the throne who admitted infidelity could not take the coronation oath . But on Tuesday , Austin seemed to change his mind , declaring that if the affair was over , &quot; I don ' t think there is a problem for the future . All Christians make mistakes and do things which are contrary to God ' s will. &quot; But the Rev . Tony Highton , a leading member of the General Synod , disagreed , arguing Tuesday : &quot; From what I understand , there does not appear to be any hint of penitence . And that is going_to cause him very serious problems . I , therefore , do not think he is fit to become defender of the faith and supreme governor of the Church of England. &quot; Harry Greenway , a Conservative member_of_Parliament , said bluntly , &quot; You cannot hold several faiths at_the_same_time , so the idea of becoming defender of all_of them is absurd. &quot; Although many have applauded Charles for acknowledging the multiplicity of religious_beliefs in modern British society , they have suggested he was asking_for_trouble in bringing_up the issue today . Charles also has been criticized for his decision to submit to the documentary , the filming of which lasted more_than a year and was designed to improve his image with the_British people . The entire Royal_Family , critics and supporters have agreed , has been in dire need of a public relations boost as , in recent years , all_the queen ' s married children have been divorced or separated . And the monarch herself has been forced to pay_for the repair of fire-damaged Windsor Castle and to submit to income_taxes on part of her holdings . As for the documentary , palace observers said Charles may have made a major misjudgment in speaking so openly in an exercise designed to win him support -- and that it could end_up having the opposite effect .</TEXT>
