   <HEADLINE> RACISM CROPS_UP IN UNLIKELY PLACES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Is there no place safe from racist remarks ? Even here in this nice quiet community , described by some as intellectual , racism lives . Right after I moved here last spring I saw a horrible racist remark on the front of the building that now houses BJ ' s pizzeria , right there on beautiful Main_Street ! And last weekend I was faced with just how racist people are.I met a woman who reportedly is a caring individual , giving to the community , someone respected within the community . During the course of a conversation she said ( speaking about her black church_members ) , &quot; They are not a book-reading group. &quot; Now perhaps my interpretation of this remark could be wrong -- perhaps she was referring to a small group of people , and not all blacks . But how could she make such an authoritive statement about a group whom I ' m quite certain she doesn ' t know , individually or intimately . Regardless of the context or intent ( she tried to &quot; explain &quot; her statement ) , it was like a slap in the face . You see , she had no idea she was talking to a black_woman . Why must I , just because I look white , be subjected_to your racist remarks ? It behooves all_of us to think before we speak . You never know who you ' ll hurt or anger ! One last thought , why can ' t people who do make racist remarks simply say &quot; I ' m sorry &quot; when confronted with it ? Why must they always tell you about all their black friends and all_the wonderful things they do_in the community and how they love Africa ? Give me a break ! J . MILLER Seal Beach</TEXT>
