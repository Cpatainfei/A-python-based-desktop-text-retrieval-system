   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; U.S. , ALLIES READY TO PAY FOR PEACE ; AID : PLAN SEEKS TO STIMULATE GROWTH , FOSTER DEMOCRACY . TAB IS LIKELY TO BE $ 550 MILLION IN FIRST YEAR ALONE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No matter how or when Haiti ' s military_leaders leave power , U.S. officials promise one sure thing about the reconstruction effort that will follow : It will cost real money . The United States and its allies have already promised to shoulder much of the burden of rebuilding Haiti ' s ravaged economy , a task that will cost an estimated $ 550 million in the first year alone and stretch well into the 21st Century . The first U.S. aid workers will land in Haiti with military troops , tackling immediate problems of getting food , water and electricity flowing . The Clinton_Administration has made plans to feed as_many as 2 million of Haiti ' s 6.6 million people for a year or more . Once emergency aid is flowing , U.S. officials plan to launch an ambitious reconstruction plan to lift Haiti from its poverty . But the economic aid program has an explicit political aim as well : to help democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide break the power of the country ' s monied oligarchy by building a new capitalist class . The money won ' t all be American ; more_than half will come from other wealthy countries . The United States has already pledged at least $ 100 million in direct aid in the first year , with more to come . &quot; The aim is to lift Haiti out of its position as the poorest country of the region , and that is a long-haul proposition , &quot; said Mark L . Schneider , assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development , the U.S. foreign_aid agency . &quot; This is an economy that has suffered three years of devastation , &quot; he said . Even before the September , 1991 , military coup that overthrew Aristide and led to a series of increasingly punishing international trade sanctions , most Haitians survived on an annual income of less than $ 100 per person . Even then , the country had to import food , its farm production held_back by poor soil and backward technology . During the past year , both industry and agriculture have virtually collapsed . Even under the embargo , the United States has been providing food relief for about 1 million Haitians . The aim of the international aid program designed by AID , other donors and Aristide advisers , however , is not merely to feed Haiti ' s impoverished masses . Instead , U.S. officials say , they hope to help transform Haiti ' s economic and political structure so democracy can take_root in the island nation for the first time in its history . &quot; You ' re going to wipe_away a corrupt political_system of overlords from the top down that has robbed and stolen what the society has been able to produce , &quot; Schneider said . &quot; The key part of this is reawakening and stimulating the private sector -- but not the same private sector that has dominated the country until now , &quot; he said . To address that problem , he said , the United States and other donors have agreed to support a plan proposed by Aristide to break_up Haiti ' s state-protected monopolies in such sectors as sugar and cement , and turn those enterprises over to their employees and other small investors . The program will also include loans and other support for small businesses and farmers , he said . Schneider and other officials said a major aid program will be needed for at least five to seven years , and probably beyond that , with the total bill impossible to estimate . Of the $ 550 million needed for the first year , the United States has promised $ 100 million and other countries and international_organizations have promised $ 350 million , for a total of $ 450 million already pledged . The United States has offered to help make_up the remaining $ 100 million if others join in . Last month , as a key part of the planning , the United States and other donors met in Paris with Aristide advisers and agreed on the basic terms of an economic recovery plan . The plan , formally proposed by Aristide , would cost $ 770 million over two years . The donors agreed to a U.S. proposal to quickly write_off $ 81 million in overdue foreign debts owed by the Haitian government , enabling international lending_institutions to extend about $ 150 million in credit for new projects . The plan would begin with an immediate shot in the arm to Haiti ' s economy , about $ 95 million for food , health services and the creation of about 50 # 000 jobs . Some of those jobs , largely in road-building and other infrastructure repair projects , would be available to former soldiers drummed_out of Haiti ' s armed forces , Schneider said . But the number of former soldiers is likely to be 5 # 000 or fewer , so they would receive only a small fraction of the public works jobs , he added . An additional $ 85 million would be available for political reforms , including training a new police_force , setting_up a new judicial_system , establishing better protection of human_rights and holding parliamentary elections at the end of this year . If all this sounds like nation-building -- a mission Clinton and his aides have forsworn -- Schneider said it should not turn_out that way . &quot; The Haitians have to do most of the work themselves , &quot; he said . Besides , he added , &quot; the international community is fully involved , &quot; meaning Haiti won ' t just be a U.S. responsibility . The biggest danger , he said , is that Americans and others may hope for too_much progress too soon in a country that has long been an economic basket case . &quot; We have to be sure that our expectations are based on what Haiti has been in the past , &quot; he said . &quot; The change is going_to be gradual. &quot;</TEXT>
