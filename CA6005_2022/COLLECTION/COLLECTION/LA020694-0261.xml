   <HEADLINE> CASE OF SHADOWY DOCTOR INCLUDES POISONINGS , LIES , DEATHS , HUBRIS ; MEDICINE : MICHAEL SWANGO CHARMED HIS WAY INTO JOBS DESPITE HIS TROUBLED PAST . MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT RARELY CHECKED HIS STORIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Barron Harris walked into a New York hospital last September , sick with pneumonia . Days later , he lapsed into a coma . Weeks later , he died . No one knew why . Weeks earlier , Andrew Woods had entered the same hospital . He , too , had pneumonia , and he says he developed seizures . He didn ' t know why . The two military veterans of two generations had one common bond : Michael Kirk , the charming doctor who had prescribed some of their medication and hovered attentively nearby . But Kirk was concealing a web of frightening secrets : He had lied to his patients about his name , he had lied to his superiors about his criminal_record , and he had lied to everyone about his troubled past . The solicitous doctor -- real name , Michael Joseph Swango -- had served two years in an Illinois prison for tainting fellow paramedics ' food with ant poison . He had been under suspicion years ago in several Ohio hospital deaths . His medical license had been revoked in two states . And he had been kicked_out of a South_Dakota medical_school . Then came New York , the latest stop in a bizarre 11-year odyssey of a troubled man so determined to be a doctor that he stitched together half-truths and out-and-out lies to manipulate the medical Establishment , exploit the legal_system and cajole his way into a world of life-and-death decisions . Swango lost his job in New York when his past was revealed . He has not been charged with wrongdoing there , but the FBI is investigating . His story is more_than a tale of a once brilliant , promising young student with a diabolical mind and a ghoulish fascination with gore . It ' s a cautionary example of how medical authorities blindly trusted one of_their_own , violating their own common-sense policies . &quot; It ' s outrageous that something like this could pop_up time and time again , &quot; said Dennis Cashman , the Illinois judge who sentenced Swango to prison in 1985 for the poisonings . * Last summer , Michael Swango was among 12 of 190 applicants to win a psychiatric residency at what was then the University Hospital at Stony Brook . Just months earlier , the school ' s emergency medical department -- nine floors up -- had rejected his application , citing too many gaps in his resume . While being interviewed by Dr. Alan Miller , director of the Psychiatric Residency Program , Swango volunteered that he had been convicted of battery in a barroom brawl . He did not mention , however , that he had served time for poisoning colleagues . No one checked his story or his credentials , a violation of policy . But it was not the first time Swango had sweet-talked his way into a job . &quot; He was a pathological charmer , &quot; said Stephen Villano , associate dean at the medical_school . &quot; He found a sympathetic ear and pushed the right buttons , asking to be given a second chance. &quot; &quot; This was no slouch that he had to convince , &quot; Villano said of Miller , a respected mental_health expert who has served as a consultant worldwide . &quot; But Swango was so polished he was able to fool this giant. &quot; Swango , 39 , was assigned to Northport Veterans Administration Medical_Center in August . At some point , he changed his name . He told some folks that it was to make a fresh_start , others that it was his stepfather ' s name . The reports were glowing . &quot; He was extremely caring , &quot; said Andrew Woods , a 41-year-old Vietnam veteran and Northport patient . &quot; He ' d spend a long_time , sometimes hours , just talking , asking me how I was. &quot; Woods said Kirk -- the name he knew him by -- never gave him medication directly , but wrote prescriptions for it . When he developed mysterious seizures , he said , his wife had him transferred . Barron Harris , a 60-year-old Korean_War veteran , was hospitalized Sept . 29 with a fever . The retired cabinet-maker , who had emphysema , was transferred to intensive care , where he became agitated and began tearing out his IV tubes , his widow said . Elsie Harris said Swango -- they , too , knew him as Kirk -- told her he gave her husband a sedative Oct . 2 . A day later , Harris lapsed into a coma . &quot; I said to Dr. Kirk , ' How ? Why ? ' &quot; she recalled . Elsie Harris said he told her he hoped it wasn ' t something he -- or others there -- had done to put her husband in that state . Harris died Nov . 9 ; autopsy results have yet to be released . The Harris and Woods families and a third patient have filed suits totaling $ 30 million against the State of New York , alleging malpractice and negligence , but Swango has not been sued . His whereabouts are unknown . Efforts by the Associated Press to reach him at his former apartment and through a stepbrother were unsuccessful . He was dismissed by Stony Brook in October , and Miller resigned days later . But that doesn ' t ease the pain for some who had trusted him . &quot; He was someone you would want to bring_home to meet your daughter , &quot; Elsie Harris said of Swango . &quot; Sometimes , I would walk in and he ' d be standing there alone at the head of my husband ' s bed , just looking_at him . &quot; Right now , &quot; she added , &quot; we would like to rip him apart. &quot; * The road to New York began in Quincy , Ill. , a quiet Mississippi_River town , where Michael Swango seemed destined for success . The blond , hazel-eyed student was a clarinet player , school band president and valedictorian . He was voted Most Likely to Succeed in the class of 1972 . Classmate Steve Siebers said Swango was highly motivated and &quot; probably the smartest kid I ' ve ever known. &quot; He remembers him excelling in a physics class that bewildered everyone else . He also recalls that Swango seemed to overreact when peers teased him . Swango ' s father , now dead , was a decorated Army veteran who served in Vietnam . The son won a music scholarship , but dropped_out to join the Marines . After the military , Swango enrolled in Quincy College , hoping to become a doctor . &quot; I wrote glowing reports for him to get_into medical_school . He was very conscientious , &quot; recalled William Gasser , his chemistry professor -- who later analyzed tea Swango had been suspected of poisoning . John Natalini , his college adviser , admired Swango ' s tenacity . &quot; He got very good grades . He spoke well . He was a gentleman , &quot; said Natalini , who later shipped science journals to Swango in prison . &quot; Nothing would say there ' s going_to be problems in the future. &quot; But the problems started soon after . At Southern Illinois University School_of_Medicine in Springfield , Swango was regarded_as a loner ; peers called his last-minute cramming &quot; Swango-ing , &quot; and he stretched himself even more by working part time as a paramedic . At the end of his last year in medical_school , some members of a student governing body moved to have him expelled . Dr. David Chapman , a classmate who now is a doctor in Springfield , said he and others thought Swango was doing a superficial job working with patients -- he would jot_down their histories in five minutes , when they should take an hour . The group failed to win the unanimous backing required for expulsion , but did succeed in holding Swango back in school , Chapman said . Swango lost a neurosurgery residency in Iowa , but he did graduate . * His next stop was Ohio . There was more trouble there . Swango lasted only one year at an Ohio State University Hospitals internship that was supposed to lead to a three-year neurosurgery residency . He left in 1984 . The official reason : He didn ' t perform well . More_than a year later , Ohio authorities , contacted by the Quincy Police_Department for a background check on Swango , discovered there was more to it . Edward Morgan , an assistant Franklin County prosecutor , said he and Ohio State police learned the hospitals had conducted a secret , internal probe prompted by an unusual number of code blues , or emergency alerts , that led to several unexpected patient deaths or suspicious illnesses . All occurred in areas where Swango had worked , Morgan said . In an affidavit taken by campus police at least 18 months later , a nurse said she entered a woman ' s room to find Swango &quot; putting what appeared to be something into the patient ' s IV tube line with a syringe. &quot; A code blue was called ; the patient had stopped breathing . After the patient was revived , she wrote a note saying a blond person had injected her IV . A nurse ' s aide said she saw Swango leave a room down the hall and found a syringe in a sink_in that room . Morgan said three bodies were exhumed to test for poisons ; none was found . But he also noted that castor_beans found in Swango ' s Quincy apartment can be used to produce a poison that tests can ' t detect . In one exhumation , a man believed to have died in 1984 due_to injuries from an automobile accident was found to have a wad of gauze stuck down his throat . There was no medical reason for it , said attorney Wayne Link , who represented the widow in an unsuccessful suit against the hospital . The coroner ruled the death a homicide . Link said the widow had learned of her husband ' s death from Swango , who called her and kept repeating the news to her . Morgan reported another strange occurrence : Doctors at a hospital on Swango ' s rotation became violently ill -- some vomited so hard they broke blood_vessels in their eyes -- after eating chicken Swango purportedly purchased at a fast-food restaurant . The prosecutor said the symptoms were consistent with arsenic poisoning . But the trail was cold by time his office learned what had gone_on , Morgan said . Syringes and other physical evidence had disappeared , fingerprints weren ' t taken , and Swango hadn ' t been interviewed by a trained investigator . &quot; I can ' t tell you what a hospital should do when they think they have an intern running amok , &quot; Morgan said . &quot; They made an inquiry to what the heck was going_on and . . . they got_rid_of the problem . But the problem continued for other people. &quot; Malcolm Baroway , director of communications at Ohio State University , said the hospital ' s first internal probe was aided by an attorney who said they didn ' t have evidence that would hold_up in court . When the Quincy case surfaced , the university president , who had been unaware of the hospital probe , ordered an investigation . That report concluded the first probe was inadequate , but noted that personal animosities and low morale may have given_rise for someone &quot; to find blame when none was warranted. &quot; Morgan doesn ' t buy_it . ' If it was just one or two incidents , fine , &quot; he said . &quot; If you add it all together , you ' ve got a sick puppy here. &quot; &quot; Where ' s there smoke , there ' s fire . And there was a lot of smoke. &quot; * By the summer of 1984 , Swango was back in Quincy , working part time as a paramedic . That fall , several paramedics reported becoming ill after eating doughnuts he brought_to work . Brent Unmisig ate one and vomited . The next night , the paramedic says , Swango handed him a soft_drink at a football game . He got sick again . He and other paramedics discovered that their symptoms -- nausea , vomiting , dizziness , headaches -- matched those of arsenic poisoning . Weeks later , Unmisig said , when some paramedics faked a call 35 minutes away to divert Swango , others found arsenic-based ant poison in his bag . Later , one paramedic left a pitcher of unsweetened tea when a crew was dispatched for a call . When they returned , it was sweet ; a co-worker said he saw Swango leaving the area . Tests found arsenic in the tea . After Swango was arrested , Tero ant poison , books on satanism , guns , survival knives and recipe cards for pesticides , botulism and cyanide mixtures were found in his apartment . Some co-workers were not surprised . &quot; He would call people on calls that had been pretty gruesome and try to elicit details , &quot; said Mark Krzystofczyk , a former paramedic . &quot; He kept a scrapbook. &quot; Trial testimony painted a grisly portrait : Swango cheering TV reports of a shooting rampage in California , saying , &quot; Every time I get a good idea , someone beats me to it , &quot; expressing admiration for serial_killers , and saying the ultimate call would be a tanker crashing into a busload of kids , creating an explosion that would impale them . Swango denied the poisonings , but admitted to some ghoulish remarks , saying he was trying to defuse tension . Medical professionals concede that black humor is common in such situations . And paramedics concede there was another side to him -- the calm , cool , consummate professional . &quot; The worse the call , &quot; Unmisig said , &quot; the better he would act and perform. &quot; Prosecutors said they didn ' t think he was trying to kill anyone , and Swango was convicted of aggravated battery . &quot; I really don ' t know what his motive was , &quot; Unmisig said . &quot; I was never mean to the man . I didn ' t do anything to harm him or embarrass him. &quot; In sentencing Swango to the maximum five years , Judge Cashman said he didn ' t understand how someone so smart could leave such a blatant trail . But Swango maintained his innocence . &quot; In no way , shape or form , under no conceivable circumstances , &quot; he said , &quot; am I now or could I ever be , a danger to any human_being on the face of the earth. &quot; Swango served two years in prison and was released in August , 1987 . Before his release , in a 1986 interview with the ABC-TV show &quot; 20 / 20 , &quot; he again denied wrongdoing . &quot; I could never do any of the things that have been alleged I ' ve done , &quot; he said . &quot; I think my whole life speaks_for that , everything I ' ve done_in the past -- my work , both as a paramedic and a doctor -- and . . . I simply could have not done those things. &quot; * After Swango ' s release , Cashman said , he received calls from private medical-placement groups , including one in Atlanta , inquiring about Swango ' s character . &quot; I just told them it probably would be wise_to stay_away_from assisting him , &quot; he said . The judge also said he heard reports that Swango had forged documents suggesting he helped a fellow doctor in a brawl and had been pardoned for his crime . He is angry that those accounts have been accepted at face_value . &quot; The medical_profession has a certain arrogance that they would choose to believe a doctor over the courts , &quot; Cashman said . Published reports in 1989 indicate Swango worked_at a medical-career vocational_school and placement_center in Newport News , Va. , where three co-workers became ill ; police say they don ' t comment on investigations unless charges are filed . In 1990 , Swango legally changed his name to David Jackson Adams and was certified as an emergency medical technician in Virginia . While working for an ambulance company , a hospital nurse recognized him -- possibly from the TV interview -- as a doctor who had served time in prison . In November , 1991 , hospital officials told the state Office of Emergency Medical Services they had learned that Adams -- who had reverted back to Swango by then -- had been convicted in a poisoning case , agency official Scott Winston said . Winston notified Swango of potential problems because of a state law prohibiting felons from holding that job . Swango repeatedly balked when asked_for records pertaining to his conviction , Winston said , and the issue died . He retained his job . Around the same time , using the Adams name , he applied to the Ohio Valley Medical_Center in Wheeling , W.Va. &quot; To tell you the truth , we liked the guy , &quot; said Dr. Jeffrey Shultz , who heads the internal_medicine residency program . But the name change and an admission that he had been in prison -- he again claimed it was for a bar fight -- alarmed Shultz , who contacted Illinois authorities and learned the truth . &quot; It made the hair stand_up on the back of my neck , &quot; he said . From 1989 to 1991 , Ohio State received inquiries about Swango from hospital or medical boards in North_Dakota ; Washington , D.C. ; and Virginia . It ' s not known if those were the only places where he tried to get a foothold back into medicine . In 1992 , Swango was back in a hospital setting again -- despite his admission that he had served time for poisoning co-workers . * &quot; You ' ve got_to know this guy , &quot; said Dr. Anthony Salem , director of the internal_medicine residency program at the University of South_Dakota School_of_Medicine , which accepted Swango into a one-year program . &quot; He had convinced me not only that he was not_guilty . . . but that it was a total miscarriage of justice. &quot; Salem said Swango told him he didn ' t understand why he had been arrested in the poisonings because he had gotten sick himself . He said he ' d changed his name to start over , but had reverted to his original one when it became a hassle . &quot; I believed him rather than calling the court and saying , ' Send me the documents. ' . . . I said , ' Well , shoot , let ' s give him a chance. ' &quot; Salem said he did check Swango out -- he knew he lost his medical license in Illinois and Ohio for an unspecified felony and was denied a license in Virginia -- but thought he knew why , so he didn ' t pursue it . But just before Thanksgiving , 1992 , South_Dakota officials were alerted to Swango ' s past by two developments , Salem said : He applied for membership in the American Medical Assn. , and some hospital employees saw an updated rerun of his &quot; 20 / 20 &quot; interview on cable . Swango was confronted , dismissed and lost his appeal in February , 1993 . Ironically , just before those events , Salem said he told Swango he was performing well enough to keep him past his year ' s residency . A check of medical_records in cases where Swango may have been involved found no irregularities , Salem added . Though Salem said he ' s embarrassed , he ' s not calling_for new safeguards to prevent this from happening again . &quot; Do you set_up a major national system to catch this aberration that comes_up 1 in 1 million or 2 million ? &quot; he asked . &quot; There was ample opportunity for those people we contacted to say , you better think_about this. &quot; Eventually , at least one hospital decided to take the initiative in doing just that . After he was dismissed , officials at Stony Brook sent letters to 126 medical_schools -- where Swango must apply to complete his residency -- alerting them to his history . Villano said more_than 60 requested his photo . Of course , that was_after Swango had slipped through their safety net . * Despite his strange history , Michael Swango still arouses sympathy . &quot; Do I still think he ' s a human_being capable of being a contributing member to society ? Yes , I do , &quot; said attorney Daniel Cook , who represented Swango in Quincy and was his high_school history teacher . &quot; It ' s somewhat of a shame to see him in this situation , &quot; said high_school classmate Siebers . &quot; I would have expected a lot of great things from him. &quot; Others are less charitable , and more leery of his next step . &quot; He ' s trying to find a niche where somebody is going_to believe his smiling face and take him at his word , &quot; said Chet Vahle , who prosecuted Swango in Quincy . &quot; He wants to be a doctor and he ' s willing to do anything he has to do to get there. &quot; Krzystofczyk , the former paramedic , puts it another way . &quot; We all figure , &quot; he said , &quot; Mike ' s not done yet. &quot; Pat Milton , an AP correspondent in Mineola , N.Y. , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
