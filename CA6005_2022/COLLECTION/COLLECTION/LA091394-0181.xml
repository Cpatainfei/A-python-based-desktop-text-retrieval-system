   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; UNCERTAINTY SHUFFLES THE DECK IN JAPANESE POLITICS ; PREDICTABILITY HAS DISSOLVED ALONG WITH THE DOMINATION OF A SINGLE PARTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rule_of_thumb that once applied to Japanese prospects -- political control by a single party that would preside over an ever-prospering economy -- has disappeared . And no new guidepost has appeared . Politics has been turned_on its head . Total uncertainty has replaced virtual predictability . The turmoil , combined with burgeoning growth in Asia and the end of the Cold_War , also has contributed to snarled trade negotiations with the United States and a reduced importance placed both on ties with Washington and on the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty that permits U.S. bases in Japan . Yet no new geopolitical visions are emerging . Suddenly , an economy in which setbacks had always been cyclical , and eventual return to long-range growth a foregone_conclusion , now appears unpredictable . What economist Isamu Miyazaki called &quot; the biggest , longest and broadest &quot; recession in post-World War II history -- a reaction to Japan ' s rocketing &quot; bubble economy &quot; of the late 1980s -- has sent corporate profits , stocks and land prices plummeting , staggered banks with bad loans , raised the specter of growing unemployment , reversed investment from boom to bust and resisted $ 300 billion worth of government pump-priming . Only one familiar element remains : Japan ' s trade surpluses and growing exports , spurred on by the recession at_home even as Japan ' s stronger yen cuts_into trade profits . Yesterday ' s unthinkable -- a Socialist prime_minister -- has become today ' s reality . &quot; It was as if an east_German had been named chancellor of Germany , &quot; an astonished former Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said when Tomiichi Murayama was elected June 29 . The August , 1993 , election of Hosokawa , head of a fledgling , 15-month-old political_party , had itself been only slightly less astonishing . Within the last 13 months , a country that had not ousted the Liberal Democratic Party as its single ruling party for 38 years has seen two changes of government , the ouster of three prime_ministers and the sharing of power by 11 political_parties . Former archrivals -- the Socialists , who suffered their worst defeat in the last election and may_not survive the next , and the Liberal Democrats -- now rule the country together . Reforms unattainable under stability were carried_out amid instability . The most sweeping overhaul of the political_system since the postwar U.S. occupation , to be completed this fall , will slash the disproportionate electoral clout of farmers by about a third . It also will plunge the country into the unknown when the next ballot for the lower house of Parliament is held . The possible post-election scenarios for change are many . In an ideal development envisioned by former Defense Minister Kazuo Aichi , politics would revolve_around two large parties . Representatives would vote on bills as they do_in the United States -- largely by individual decision , not mandatory party dictates . Yet voters in new single-seat districts would cast ballots with the aim of making their candidate ' s party leader the next prime_minister , like the_British parliamentary system , he said . Policies , and not the pork_barrel , would highlight campaigns , said Aichi , a policy-maker in the opposition Renewal Party , which staged a mass defection in June , 1993 , to deprive the Liberal Democrats of their historic majority in the powerful lower house . But another scenario , though remote , would see conservatives regrouping , making the LDP a bigger monolith than before , Aichi acknowledged . Already , one band of LDP defectors , the splinter New Party Harbinger , has rejoined the Liberal Democrats as a junior partner in the coalition . &quot; Right now , the LDP is halfway back into power , &quot; said former Prime_Minister Kiichi Miyazawa . An old confrontation that perennially dogged Japanese defense_policy disappeared as Murayama scrapped his Socialist_Party ' s bedrock insistence on dismantling the nation ' s 240 # 000-strong armed forces and abolishing its security treaty with the United States . Yet military experts like Seiki Nishihiro , a former vice defense minister , worry about a &quot; hollowing_out &quot; of support for the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty on both sides of the Pacific . He said that with the Soviet threat gone , some Americans are asking , &quot; Why do we need Japan ? &quot; Similarly , some Japanese are asking , &quot; Why do we need the U.S. bases in Japan ? &quot; LDP politicians in Okinawa , where 75 % of the U.S. bases are located , in July started advocating abolition of all American military facilities there in a bid to curry favor with voters on the southern island . But party headquarters in Tokyo , led by Foreign Minister Yohei Kono , has said nothing opposing U.S. bases in Japan . Although President Clinton and Murayama affirmed the importance of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in July -- as leaders of the two countries always have done -- neither they nor any other top official has bothered to explain why the treaty is still important , Nishihiro complained . To Japanese defense experts , the importance is to ensure that the United States retains a military presence in Asia as a &quot; balancer , &quot; Nishihiro said . &quot; Japan abandoned its World_War_II goal of seeking hegemony in Asia . But that does not mean it wants China or Russia to assume hegemony. &quot; Murayama ' s turnabout included acceptance of dispatching troops overseas to participate in humanitarian and noncombat U.N. peacekeeping missions -- a move his party opposed vociferously only two years ago . But other_than pledging to work for disarmament , the prime_minister has offered no vision for a new security policy . And now that America ' s relative economic importance to Japan is dwindling in_proportion_to growth in Asia , where Japan ' s trade surplus now exceeds its black ink with the United States , U.S.-Japan trade disputes that once caused alarm in Tokyo draw far less attention from both prime_ministers and the press . &quot; The 21st Century will be China ' s century -- and Japan ' s foreign_policy will revolve on the dual axis of Japan-U.S. relations and Japan-China relations , &quot; said Kosuke Ito , a member of the Liberal Democrats ' policy board . Previously , the United States was cited as the only axis of Japan ' s diplomacy . The choice of Murayama as prime_minister and his policy flip-flop , which proved that even the wildest of presumably inconceivable events was possible , wiped_out the credibility of political forecasting in Tokyo . &quot; So_much has changed that we don ' t know which precedents mean anything for the future , &quot; said an American political analyst , who asked not to be named . Policy differences that remain -- such_as whether to do as much , or as little , as possible , to help solve international disputes -- now divide individual politicians more_than party_lines . Doves and hawks roost across the spectrum . &quot; can ' t Find an Axle for Political Confrontation , &quot; an Asahi headline said of the new political structure . New political jokes have emerged . An example : &quot; To a Japanese politician , policy is like a subway_station . You only stand on the platform until the train comes in. &quot; Koichi Kato , a rising star in the Liberal Democrat ranks , predicted that Japan would be ruled by coalition governments for at least five , and possibly 10 , years . Minoru Morita , a respected political commentator , said an expected Socialist debacle in an upper house election next July could mark the end of the present government . The Socialists ' alliance with the Liberal Democrats will deprive the party of the large_number of anti-LDP protest votes it once received , said Katsumi Samata , who served 35 years as a Socialist staff_member . And now that Murayama has wiped_out the old doctrine , Socialists are likely to lose the party ' s ideologues as well , he pointed_out . &quot; Murayama is being called the ' chairman of the Socialists ' funeral committee ' -- in_charge of burying the party , &quot; Samata said . Political analysts , however , are making few other predictions . They confess they are not even sure what groups will run in the next lower house election . Already defections , feuds and shifting alliances have created a new political map splotched with 17 political_parties and &quot; associations. &quot; The Liberal Democrats , for example , have lost nearly a third of the seats they held_in 1993 through defections alone . In 1989 , Takeo Tanaka , who runs a children ' s clothing_store in the Kameari section of Tokyo , was enraged by LDP politicians pocketing windfall_profits from capital_gains in a stock-for-favors scandal even as they imposed a consumption tax on daily necessities of the Japanese people . And his opinion of politicians hasn ' t changed today as politicians debate increasing the consumption-tax rate . &quot; Before raising the tax , why don ' t politicians reform government to cut expenses and set a model themselves ? &quot; he complained . &quot; In Japan , as soon as you become a politician , you become rich. &quot; Polls show once again that the political_party favored by the biggest plurality is &quot; none of the above. &quot; Average Japanese , nonetheless , consistently express high levels of satisfaction with their living standards . Nearly 90 % of families consider themselves middle_class . And despite astronomical costs of housing , nearly two-thirds of Japanese are satisfied with their present living conditions , a poll by the prime_minister ' s office showed in August . Indeed , 60 % of families own their own living unit . Despite the political turmoil and the economic recession , &quot; most people don ' t have a sense of crisis . They aren ' t worried about their livelihoods , &quot; said Ryoko Yamaguchi , a therapist . &quot; In our family , our biggest concern is whether our son ( who is 22 and will graduate from college next March ) will get a job or not . He ' s not worried . If he doesn ' t find a job , he says he ' ll support himself for a year doing part-time work , and try again next year . And he is telling us : ' Don ' t worry . I won ' t impose on you , ' &quot; she said . The recession , nonetheless , is making consumers more cautious . &quot; People who used to think that using things and throwing them away after a while was fine are now trying to conserve goods . The feeling that money will keep flowing in is gone , &quot; Yamaguchi said . Shopkeeper Tanaka has felt the impact directly . &quot; Fifteen or 16 ( neighboring ) shops have closed , and it ' s the same in every neighborhood , &quot; he said . But the villain is only partially the recession , which he said &quot; has tightened the purse_strings of consumers. &quot; The bigger blow , he said , has come from revisions of the Large Retail_Store Law that were carried_out at the insistence of the George_Bush Administration on the theory that large stores handle more imports than mom-and-pop shops . Government restrictions on the hours and the number of days that department_stores and supermarkets can operate have been eased , squeezing the shop sector , Tanaka complained . &quot; It ' s now useless to oppose the opening of new large stores , &quot; he added . &quot; The law may as well have been repealed. &quot; Hosokawa succeeded in putting deregulation -- the easing and removal of government restrictions on business -- near the top of the political agenda , said economist Miyazaki , a former vice minister of the government ' s Economic Planning Agency who now heads the Daiwa Research Institute . &quot; Nowadays , kisei kanwa ( easing of restrictions ) appears everywhere in government reports , &quot; he said . Hideo Ishihara , chairman of Goldman Sachs Japan , added , &quot; For the first time in history , we are re-examining and reappraising our system on our own , without being forced to do so by Americans. &quot; But he also said he was &quot; not optimistic about deregulation because so many people have their vested_interests and livelihood at stake. &quot; Despite the political upheaval of the last year , very little change has occurred in daily life , he noted . The common_denominator today is uncertainty . Although the Economic Planning Agency declared last week that the economy has taken a turn toward &quot; moderate recovery , &quot; pessimism remains widespread . &quot; Capital markets play the role of a heart which pumps blood to the economy . Just as a politician with a weak heart cannot become a top-class statesman , an economy with a weak heart cannot become top class in the world . Right now , ( capital markets ) are not functioning . The surgeon is trying to make_up his mind whether to prescribe medication or conduct a major_surgery , &quot; said Hideo Sakamaki , president of Nomura Securities . Kenneth S . Courtis , strategist and senior economist for Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Asia , said bad_debts held by banks &quot; represent a massive negative for the entire economy &quot; that make_it &quot; problematic for the economy to expand anytime soon. &quot; And without domestic growth to pull_in imports , Japan ' s trade surpluses for the decade of the 1990s could reach $ 1 trillion , he warned . Corporate income has plunged by more_than 50 % , driving volume on the stagnant Tokyo Stock_Market down to a quarter of its peak and sending prices plummeting to barely half their previous level , said Sakamaki , the Nomura Securities president . &quot; Six times the central discount_rate has been lowered . Three overall economic ( pump-priming ) packages have been announced . But the economy still hasn ' t taken_off , &quot; he said . Miyazaki also said he was confounded by the failure of the pump-priming packages to make an impact on the economy . &quot; Where has all that money gone ? &quot; he asked . &quot; It ' s not clear. &quot; &quot; The economy that emerges from the recession will be -- and must be -- completely different from the one that existed before the recession , &quot; Miyazaki said . Already , even with no increase in domestic demand , labor-intensive manufactured imports from neighboring Asian_nations are increasing , he noted . Yen appreciation , in_effect , is forcing Japan to &quot; import labor &quot; indirectly to cut costs , and that trend will be a feature of the &quot; new economy , &quot; he insisted . As a result , Japan will face , for the first time , &quot; jobless growth , &quot; or an economy in which the GNP rises by an annual 3.5 % or more without producing new jobs . Unemployment , he said , is likely to become a new issue for the country .
