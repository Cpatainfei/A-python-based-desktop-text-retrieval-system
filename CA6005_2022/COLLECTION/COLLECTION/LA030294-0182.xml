   <TEXT> David Scott Lewis calls himself an &quot; infomaniac. &quot; In 1975 , when he was 17 , he built a personal_computer from the first available Altair kits . He became a &quot; hacker &quot; and served as a consultant to &quot; WarGames , &quot; a 1983 film about a teen-age computer nerd who nearly triggers a nuclear war . Today , the 35-year-old Lewis cruises the Internet , the global electronic supernetwork known simply as &quot; the Net &quot; that links 20 # 000 computer_networks and boasts 20 million users . He spends an hour or more a day perusing more_than 200 groups of on-line information . He even acquired an Internet address -- a sort of ID number -- for his 19-week-old daughter on the day she was born . So naturally , this walking encyclopedia and information junkie is a fitting editor and publisher of an Internet magazine , Hot Off The Tree , which summarizes more_than 100 printed publications and explores our technological world . His &quot; publication &quot; circulates electronically -- only in cyberspace -- and is a sign of the coming grass-roots explosion in the electronic publishing world . &quot; I think the Internet may be as important to publishing as the Gutenberg printing_press , &quot; he said . &quot; It means that anybody can be a publisher , as long as they understand the Internet . I haven ' t spent a nickel and I ' m putting_out an international magazine and rounding_up tens of thousands of subscribers. &quot; * Lewis got the urge to start a free electronic magazine to track the hottest and the worst technologies after reading a 1992 NASA-Pentagon report that suggested techies might prefer reading on-line . &quot; Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch , watch_out , &quot; Lewis jokes . Susan Jurist , a visual arts librarian at UC San Diego , published Hot Off The Tree for about a year before it became too_much of a burden . She had 2 # 000 subscribers when she halted publication last fall . In December , Lewis asked if he could take it over , and she agreed . UCSD officials agreed to maintain the mailing_list in the beginning for his first few issues , which will not carry advertising . Lewis intends to publish and edit HOTT about 10 times a year in his spare_time from his home_in Irvine . Lewis has taken steps to dramatically boost HOTT ' s circulation . He sent a mass solicitation to various Internet user groups in January and included the text of the speech by AT &amp; T executive Robert Kavner at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas . A direct mailing on paper could have cost him at least $ 45 # 000 , but providing the same information on the Internet cost nothing . After less than two months , more_than 31 # 000 people sent Lewis messages saying they wanted to subscribe_to HOTT , which he calls the &quot; first periodical for the global citizenry in cyberspace. &quot; Lewis ' electronic magazine venture is expected to cost him less than $ 5 # 000 . Loading the magazine onto the Internet costs nothing more_than getting an Internet address , which he has for free thanks to his work over the past seven years as an editor of a quarterly journal for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers . * Once Lewis completes an issue , he sends it to an Internet host computer in San Jose , which transmits it to a computer_system at UC San Diego , where the mailing_list is kept . Then the university transmits it worldwide to everyone on the list . &quot; I could do this from a ski slope in Wyoming as long as I had access to a computer and modem , &quot; he said . Kathryn McCabe , editor-in-chief of Online Access , a printed magazine that covers electronic_bulletin_boards , said her journal keeps track of 150 electronic magazines . Most electronic journals , ranging from Computer Underground Digest to AIDS Treatment News , hit a focused readership and compete only with printed trade journals of limited circulation . &quot; If he has 31 # 000 people , that is successful , &quot; said McCabe , &quot; These things have taken_off on the Internet because the economics are so_much better when you don ' t have to print on paper. &quot; Lewis ' magazine should also draw additional readers because it will be posted for viewing on a variety of computer_networks within the Internet , including an Air_Force network and numerous overseas networks . Lewis has received hundreds of electronic letters asking_for subscriptions , from a Russian scientist working_at the University of Sains in Malaysia to academics in Beijing . Not_bad for an electronic magazine that will resume publishing later this month . It ' s difficult to determine how many people actually read an on-line magazine and even to define what one is , said Daniel Dern , author of the Internet Guide for New Users and outgoing editor of Internet World magazine in Newton Center , Mass . &quot; What Mr. Lewis is doing with HOTT is exciting in itself and also as a demonstration of how to reach a large audience on-line , &quot; said Dern . &quot; It really is experimental. &quot; * The timing for these &quot; e-zines &quot; couldn ' t be better . With the growing popularity of the information superhighway , the general media have published more_than 2 # 000 articles on the ' Net . How-to books for Internet novices proliferate . Lewis believes his magazine will become must reading among the 2.5 million serious ' Net users like himself . &quot; We ' ve hit upon a publishing phenomenon , &quot; said Rosalind Resnick , a Hollywood , Fla. , resident who monitors electronic newspapers and magazines and started her own Internet publication , the Interactive Publishing Alert , this month . &quot; After sending_out e-mail , I got my first paying subscriber in seven hours. &quot; Lewis said he will keep his full-time job while working as editor , publisher and sole employee of HOTT . Since January , he has been president of Cellsys Inc. , a start-up Van Nuys company that is creating wireless communications products , such_as radio-controlled home_appliances . Previously , he worked for eight years as a marketing executive for a factory automation firm in Irvine , Noubas . His bookshelf includes &quot; fun &quot; titles such_as &quot; Neurocomputing , &quot; &quot; Virtual Reality Systems , &quot; &quot; Silicon_Valley Fever , &quot; &quot; Numerical Analysis , &quot; and &quot; Technological Forecasting for Decision Making. &quot; &quot; If anyone can pull this off , David can , &quot; said Ira Moskatel , a high-tech attorney in Century City who has known Lewis for nine years . &quot; He ' s a walking encyclopedia. &quot; Larry Lasker , who co-wrote the screenplay for &quot; WarGames , &quot; said Lewis has a talent for making technological subjects understandable to novices . &quot; As a hacker , you could tell he knew his way around , &quot; Lasker said . &quot; He was an incredibly fast reader . He was always motivated to find information if he didn ' t have it. &quot; Edward Roberts , a professor of management information at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said Lewis clearly has the energy to be successful with HOTT . &quot; He has a craze for scanning information and cramming it into his head and putting it together into tidbits. &quot; Lewis boils_down newspaper_articles from about 100 newspapers and trade journals into summaries because most busy users don ' t want the entire story as long as they know where to find the full text . Summaries can be useful because the Internet is more like an ocean of information , where it is difficult to find things , than a highway . Lewis said he doesn ' t have to pay royalties to publications as long as he gives proper credit . Because of its combination academic and &quot; cyberpunk &quot; outlaw roots , commercial advertising on the Internet often draws the wrath of users fond of &quot; flaming. &quot; Because messages on the ' Net go uncensored , users often unload curses and vitriol on the advertising sponsor . But Lewis believes users will accept tasteful ads in the form of promotional stories known as &quot; advertorials , &quot; which in HOTT will take the form of perspectives from computer company chief_executives , helpful hints , or new product announcements . &quot; The market will speak , &quot; said Dern . &quot; It ' s hard to know what the reaction will be and it depends_on how it ' s done. &quot; * Lewis says HOTT will have eight times as much news in it as ads . Once the circulation hits 50 # 000 , Lewis said he will seek sponsors who would be charged somewhere between $ 2 # 000 and $ 3 # 500 per screen of advertorial . A few sponsors have already approached him . Since HOTT is targeting the heaviest users of the Internet , Lewis believes advertisers will pay dearly to reach them . &quot; I hope to make_good money as the circulation goes_up , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; Although I ' m not sure if it ' s more of an adventure or a venture. &quot; Hot Off The Tree ( HOTT ) at a Glance * Founded : January , 1994 * Headquarters : Irvine * How to subscribe : Send an electronic_mail request to : listserv.ucsd.edu.
