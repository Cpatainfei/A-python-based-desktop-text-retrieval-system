   <HEADLINE> BUT WILL THE SERBS GET THE MESSAGE ? ; BOMBING OF POSITIONS NEAR GORAZDE HARDENS NATO ' S LINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It has been 10 months since the U.N. Security_Council authorized the United Nations to employ &quot; all necessary means , including the use of force , &quot; to defend designated &quot; safe areas &quot; in Bosnia against Serbian attacks . On Sunday and again on Monday , after hundreds of civilians had already been killed and wounded in the Serbian siege of one of those safe areas , force was finally used in the form of very limited air strikes by NATO -- meaning American -- planes . As Serbian gunners kept_up their indiscriminate shelling of the Muslim population in Gorazde , the U.N. commander asked_for and quickly got approval for tactical air_attacks . Their objective was to compel the Serbs to respect the protected status of Gorazde and to impel them to return to negotiations for a political settlement to the Bosnian war . But , by the end of the second day of direct NATO involvement in that war , it remained far from clear whether either of these goals would soon be met . YELTSIN ' S HOWL : Russia has protested loudly about the U.S. air_raids , though whether more from hurt feelings because it wasn ' t consulted in_advance or out of historic affinity with the Serbs it ' s hard to say . Probably a bit of both . President Boris Yeltsin ' s government has lately used every possible occasion to reassert Russia ' s claim to be a great_power to whom attention must be paid , and has been taking a much more nationalistic foreign-policy line generally ever since its far-right opponents did so well in last December ' s legislative elections . The change in Moscow ' s position on Bosnia became especially evident less than two weeks ago . It was then that Russia , despite its earlier support for using force in Bosnia , prevented the Security_Council from adopting a weak statement condemning Serbian attacks on Gorazde . Had Russia reaffirmed its support for putting military_force behind the expressed U.N. will , the siege of Gorazde might have been ended and a lot of suffering might have been prevented . CLINTON ' S CALL : President Clinton of course did the right thing in authorizing the use of U.S. air_power against Serb positions . As the central power in NATO and as the key decision-maker in the Security_Council , this country had only one course if it hoped to preserve the credibility of both organizations : to act in the face of continued flagrant aggression . But it ' s clear at_the_same_time that Washington , aware of the lack of support for deep U.S. involvement in Bosnia among the public , in Congress and in the Pentagon , has no intention of extending itself too deeply . What it desperately wants is a negotiated end to this brutal conflict , even if that means letting the Serbs keep most of their territorial spoils . The next day or two should tell if the Serbs have been sufficiently sobered by the American air strikes to rethink their strategy . NATO Secretary_General Manfred Woerner warns that any effort by the Serbs to retaliate against U.N. peacekeepers would see NATO react &quot; very forcefully. &quot; that ' s as it should be . But at_the_same_time it would be helpful to know just whose armed forces Woerner is threatening to react with . Is the show in the skies over Bosnia supposed to be exclusively American , or will the alliance in fact start to behave like an alliance ?</TEXT>
