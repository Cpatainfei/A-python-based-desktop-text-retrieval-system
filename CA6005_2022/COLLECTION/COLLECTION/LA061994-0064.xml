   <HEADLINE> VOICES : NONSTOP FANATICO ; LA OPINION ' S SOCCER WRITER HOPES THE WORLD CUP WILL SPEED THE SPORT ' S ACCEPTANCE IN THE U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Soccer will continue to grow here and it will continue to be popular among the youth and college-age people in Southern California after the World Cup has come and gone . It ' s a sport that you can play easily , and you don ' t need a lot of money . But it will take time , even after the World Cup , for it to develop here at the professional level . The big problem with professional sports in the United States is Americans want to make all_the sports similar . Soccer is not like football or baseball . You can ' t go_to a college right now and draft players like you would in football because the college players are not as_good_as the international players . In most countries 500 to 600 teams feed the professional teams , and the boys go_through the ranks until they reach the very best teams . The kids will play 20 years before they make_it to the professional teams . At the college_level in the United States , there is a problem with discrimination against Latino players . Colleges and universities would prefer to attract a European player and some don ' t like the way Latinos play . It ' s a way of thinking that is dangerous and could exclude Latino players . In the past , there have been efforts in the United States to change soccer . And this is a game that hasn ' t really changed in 100 years . that ' s important because any referee can go anywhere and referee a game . He doesn ' t need to speak the languages because the players will know what he is doing . It will take time for soccer to take_root here . And one of the biggest problems will be the press , because they don ' t give it coverage . For example , Mexico played the United States the other day and I only saw two small articles . You had 91 # 000 fans at the Rose Bowl , and that ' s a big deal . And there is a lot of negative coverage too . For example , with the World Cup there has been a lot of talk_about the hooligans of soccer , and that really only involves England . If you look_at the teams playing_at the Rose Bowl -- the Romanians , Colombians and the United States -- they ' ve never really had problems . But on television they ' ve made_it seem as if the police really needed to prepare_for potential problems with perhaps the Colombian team . And that really is a slight for all Latinos . Soccer is the No . 1 sport all_over the world . Americans need to broaden the identification of soccer beyond just appealing_to Latinos . If they form a new professional league here , they must start_out attracting players from all_over the world , including Mexico , Central and South_America , because that can help attract fans here in the United States . An effort must be made to bring_in more European players and Latino players until soccer takes_root here . You need better players . The opportunity the World Cup offers is for the public to see good games , and if the people here get a chance to see good games it could really help promote soccer . But if the games are bad , a game that is 0-0 and boring , it won ' t help soccer here . The team that is really playing well now is Colombia . If they come_to the World Cup and they continue to play fast football , it ' ll help to promote soccer in the United States .</TEXT>
