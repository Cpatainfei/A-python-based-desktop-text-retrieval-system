   <HEADLINE> CANDIDATES SEEK VOTES IN O.C. , ACROSS THE STATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Campaigning the length of California , the four major candidates for U.S. Senate and governor readied their final pitches Sunday , the two Republicans appearing at an Orange County rally and all expressing a politician ' s confidence in their chances for election 48 hours hence . Gubernatorial candidates Kathleen Brown and Pete Wilson continued their angry back-and-forth about illegal immigration , Proposition 187 and crime , issues that have dominated their campaign in recent weeks . While giving his standard endorsement of Proposition 187 before a rally of 500 to 750 people in Costa Mesa -- amid chants from a small band of demonstrators nearby -- Wilson made a special appeal_to Orange County Republican loyalists . He urged Orange County voters to deliver a wide enough ratio to offset Democratic strongholds in other parts of the state , recognizing that Republicans for statewide office need 2-to-1 vote ratios in the county to maximize their chances of victory . &quot; Work , my friends , work until the polls are closed to get every Orange County vote_out , &quot; Wilson implored in a rally that included Senate candidate Rep . Mike Huffington and other GOP candidates for statewide office . &quot; The last time there was a statewide election for this office , I counted_on Orange County. &quot; As he did at an earlier campaign stop in Monrovia , Wilson told GOP volunteers that they should not be swayed by his lead in the polls but should work hard until election_day . &quot; Run_up the score , &quot; he told them . Brown was upbeat during a day of campaign stops . &quot; I should be dead . I oppose the death_penalty . I ' m Jerry Brown ' s sister . I am a woman . I ' m running against an incumbent . I ' m being outspent by 3 to 1 , and I have ( opposed ) an initiative that was going_to win by 66 % of the vote up until two weeks ago and even now it ' s on the edge , &quot; Brown told reporters . &quot; I should be dead . I don ' t feel dead for some reason . I feel really great , so we ' ll see. &quot; Senate candidates Dianne Feinstein , the incumbent Democrat , and Huffington kept a somewhat slower pace but the heat of their rhetoric was nonetheless intense . Feinstein reminded voters of her work_on the federal crime bill and the ban on military assault_rifles ; Huffington spoke in favor of the initiative on the California ballot that would imprison for 25 years to life those who commit three felonies . Huffington , in Monrovia , called Feinstein and U.S. Sen . Barbara Boxer the &quot; Thelma and Louise &quot; of politics . &quot; And you remember what happened at the end of the movie , &quot; he said , alluding to the characters ' demise off the end of a cliff . &quot; We ' re going to send Dianne Feinstein home_in two days to the city by the bay. &quot; For her part , Feinstein was more confident than she has been in recent weeks and exhorted her followers to work hard through Election_Day . &quot; If we let these races be bought , if we let these people who have huge amounts_of_money go_on and run slanderous ads and you can ' t do anything about it . . . the American political process will be rent asunder , &quot; Feinstein said in Pasadena . Brown , whose campaign aides said they were convinced that the treasurer is making_up ground , campaigned vigorously , her speeches firm and feisty despite a weekend spent explaining her campaign ' s financial troubles . She made campaign stops in San Diego , Sacramento and in Los Angeles , where Brown spoke at a rally against Proposition 187 , which would deny public education and non-emergency state services to illegal immigrants . She said the election presented a distinction between &quot; politicians who use issues just to hold onto power and politicians who use power to address the issues of the day. &quot; Brown characterized Wilson as one who &quot; would use our fears and our anger and our frustration just to hold onto power. &quot; &quot; It has happened before , &quot; she said to a standing_ovation at the West Los Angeles United Methodist_Church . &quot; We must_not let it happen again. &quot; Speaking_to reporters later , Brown dismissed the open worries of many Democrats that her campaign ' s decision to air virtually no television advertisements on the final weekend before the election would be harmful to her and other party candidates . Brown aides said Saturday that they were unable to air ads this weekend because they had essentially run_out of money last week . They still planned to run two anti-Wilson immigration ads beginning today . Brown said she had decided instead to put her campaign money into a field operation that could persuade voters to turn_out on Tuesday . Asked if she felt that her staff had mismanaged the finances -- as White_House officials had grumbled Saturday during the President ' s visit to California -- she said , &quot; I think you evaluate all_of that afterward. &quot; But Brown defended her campaign against accusations that it had violated the first rule of financing -- make_sure there is money for the end of the campaign . &quot; It ' s also been a rule of politics for the last decade and a half that you don ' t put one dime into the field , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s a rule of politics that you spend it all on TV . I have not done that . I have been unconventional in a whole variety of ways in this campaign. &quot; Wilson spent the day with other GOP candidates at a series of events that exuded Americana , from the huge American flag and Marine Corps hymn that greeted him in Riverside to the Little Leaguers with caramel popcorn and hot dogs in Monrovia . In Orange County , security was increased -- a sign of the high emotions running_through both sides of the Proposition 187 campaign . As Wilson pleaded with voters to pass Proposition 187 , the voices of protesters could be heard from outside the fence of the Orange County Fairgrounds where the rally was held . Almost three dozen people , waving the flags of the United States and Mexico , chanted : &quot; Children yes , Wilson no. &quot; Accusing the federal_government of not doing enough to help California with problems related to illegal immigration , Wilson told the cheering crowd : &quot; We will take it into our own hands . We will fix it . We will vote yes on 187. &quot; State Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren , who shared the stage Sunday with Wilson , said after the Orange County rally that he had not yet decided how he would vote on Proposition 187 , but that he would announce his position today , the day before the election . In a brief news_conference after the Orange County event , Wilson continued his criticism of Clinton , who campaigned in California this weekend . &quot; If he had done his job , there would have been no need for 187 , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; I think , frankly , his performance in this state has been pathetic. &quot; At the Monrovia rally in favor of the &quot; three strikes &quot; proposition , Wilson exhorted voters to pass that measure and dismissed suggestions that it might lock_up felons who are not truly dangerous . &quot; They are incurable , incorrigible repeat offenders , &quot; Wilson said of the measure ' s targets . Feinstein spent the final Sunday of her campaign at a union hall in San Luis Obispo and before supporters in Pasadena , where she talked_about the ban she authored on military assault_rifles . She said illegal immigration and campaign finance reform would be her top priorities if she wins a full_term in the Senate . With an eye toward the $ 28 million of_his_own money that Huffington has already spent on_his_own behalf , Feinstein said her reforms would include meaningful spending limits . As she has many times before , Feinstein used the Pasadena event to tout her bipartisan support and was joined by the city ' s Republican vice mayor , Bill Paparian . He announced not only his support but Feinstein ' s endorsement by the Armenian National Committee , a politically conservative group that is supporting Wilson and carries some sway with the state ' s 500 # 000 Armenians . Huffington , meanwhile , appeared at two events with Wilson and other GOP candidates . At one , the rally for the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative , he brought_up the recent deaths of two South Carolina boys , allegedly at the hands of their mother . &quot; I was disgusted , &quot; he said . &quot; I cried . I was racked with pain . Our society is too lenient . We have too many liberals saying it ' s our fault , it ' s society ' s fault . &quot; No , it ' s not . It ' s the criminals ' fault . Let ' s elect a senator to the United States Senate who is going_to appoint the toughest judges available. &quot; This article was written by Decker in Los Angeles and reported by Times staff writers Martinez in Orange County , Greg Krikorian with Feinstein , Amy Wallace with Brown and Dan Weintraub with Wilson and Huffington .
