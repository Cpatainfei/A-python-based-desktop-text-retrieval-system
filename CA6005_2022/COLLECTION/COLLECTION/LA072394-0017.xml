   <HEADLINE> U.S. TRADE_DEFICIT WITH CHINA WILL REACH $ 28 BILLION THIS YEAR , CIA SAYS ; ECONOMY : IN REPORT TO CONGRESS , AGENCY NOTES IMBALANCE IS NOW SECOND ONLY TO THAT BETWEEN AMERICA AND JAPAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The CIA predicted Friday that the U.S. trade_deficit with China will grow to $ 28 billion this year , bolstering recent predictions of senior Clinton_Administration officials that China is fast closing_in on Japan as America ' s leading trade problem . In its annual report to Congress on the Chinese economy , the CIA noted that China ' s exports of labor-intensive goods such_as toys , shoes and clothes -- which have increasingly filled the shelves of American discount_chains and retail_stores -- are now being augmented by new sales of medium-technology products such_as telephones . At the same time , while American companies are having trouble increasing their exports to China , Japan ' s sales in the world ' s most populous country have been shooting_up rapidly , the CIA found . Like the United States , Japan had a trade_deficit with China , but it was much smaller -- $ 3.3 billion in 1993 . At a hearing Friday , Sen . Jeff Bingaman ( D-N.M. ) termed the existing U.S. trade_deficit with China &quot; unacceptable . . . . It is growing faster than that with any other trading partner. &quot; If current rates of increase -- more_than 20 % a year -- continue , the trade imbalance with China will reach $ 40 billion by the presidential election year of 1996 . The U.S. trade_deficit with Japan has been running at annual levels of $ 50 billion to $ 60 billion . &quot; They ( China ) have learned the wrong lessons from Japan , frankly , &quot; U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told The Times last month . The Clinton_Administration is now engaged in trade talks with China aimed at resolving disputes over such issues as China ' s pirating of copyrighted software , tape_recordings and movies . These violations of intellectual property reduce levels of U.S. exports to China . So rapidly are Chinese goods taking_hold in the U.S. market that shoes and sneakers made in China accounted_for 40 % of all imported footwear last year , up from 30 % in 1992 . About half of all_the luggage imported into the United States in 1993 came from China , as did nearly 40 % of all_the toys , games and baby_carriages . But CIA specialists on the Chinese economy pointed_out that , if China , Taiwan and Hong Kong are lumped together , the increase in the trade_deficit does not seem quite so dramatic . The reason is that , as Hong Kong and Taiwanese companies transfer their factories to China to take_advantage of cheaper labor , the U.S. trade_deficit with these other jurisdictions is reduced while the imbalance with China goes_up . &quot; Much of China ' s success in the U.S. marketplace is_due to the relocation of manufacturing facilities from other rapidly developing regions in Asia to China , &quot; said Martin Petersen , CIA director of East Asian analysis . In the seven-year period from 1987 to 1993 , the U.S. trade imbalance with China increased by 700 % . But the deficit with what is now commonly called &quot; greater China &quot; -- the amalgamation of China , Hong Kong and Taiwan -- was up by a much more modest 20 % in the same period , Petersen said . The CIA report , released Friday by Congress ' Joint Economic Committee , pointed to a major change in China ' s economy last year : Japan , in past years a reluctant , cool partner in economic relations with China , has begun dramatically increasing sales and investment there . In 1992 , China was Japan ' s fifth-largest trading partner . But in 1993 , it shot_up to second on Japan ' s list -- behind the United States -- primarily because of a huge increase in Japanese exports to China . Japan ' s sales in China shot_up by 45 % last year , to $ 17.3 billion . Some of this increase was linked to exports of steel and iron , which more_than doubled as Japan rushed building_materials to help support China ' s boom in construction . In contrast with Japan , the United States increased its exports to China by a much smaller amount , 17 % , to $ 8.8 billion , with airplanes and cars making_up the largest share of the total . The CIA said Japan ' s foreign_aid to China helped support the increase in its exports . China is now the second-largest recipient of Japanese aid in the world . &quot; Although these credits are officially untied ( that is , not made conditional on the purchase of Japanese products ) , Japanese firms usually perform the feasibility studies for the credits , giving Japan an advantage in the bidding process , &quot; the CIA concluded . Japan ' s exports to China were also helped by a nearly 60 % increase in Japanese investment in the country last year . The CIA said new projects funded by Japanese investment probably helped increase Japanese sales of machinery , boilers and appliances . The CIA also reported a huge increase in overall foreign investment in China last year . It said China absorbed about $ 26 billion in foreign funds in 1993 , compared with $ 12 billion or so the previous year . Joint_ventures and other foreign-owned enterprises made_up 11 % of China ' s industrial output last year and now employ nearly 10 million Chinese workers .</TEXT>
