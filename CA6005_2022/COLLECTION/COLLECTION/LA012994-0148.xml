   <HEADLINE> ROOM TO GROW ; WHITE WICKER , FLOWERED WALLPAPER AND DOLLS ARE FINE FOR LITTLE_GIRLS . BUT AFTER ASHLEY WILLIAMS ENTERED COLLEGE , HER TASTES GRADUATED TOO . DESIGNER MARY DIVEL GUIDED WILLIAMS THROUGH TRANSFORMING THE YOUTHFUL BEDROOM INTO AN EXOTIC ADULT INTERIOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Ashley Williams turned 21 , it seemed time her bedroom grew_up too . * &quot; The room had white wallpaper with flowers , white wicker furniture and white shelves holding my doll and music_box collections , &quot; she said . &quot; I was tired_of it. &quot; Williams , a student at Saddleback College , packed the collections away in the garage of the Laguna Niguel home where she lives with her parents and set_out on a quest_for a new , adult look . For help she turned_to artist / designer Mary Divel , who is also a family friend . The finished room is dramatically different : It has a rich color_scheme and exotic touches . Most of the new look was achieved by reworking the existing furnishings . Only a_few items were bought for the redesign . The biggest changes were made with the all-time agent of versatility : paint . It was applied -- often in multiple layers -- to walls and furniture . All plans have to start somewhere , and the plans for Williams ' room started with a white bedspread that her mother wanted her to use . Because the white would make the bed less suitable for sitting , Williams decided she needed a separate lounging and reading area . Designating one corner of the room as this area , Williams and Divel upholstered a piece of curving foam-rubber to create a futon on the floor . They covered it in a combination of zebra-print and tapestry fabrics , a decision that was to inspire other changes in the room . They added a custom railing designed by wrought-iron artist David Brunetta and stacked many oversize pillows against the wall and rail . To further enliven the sitting area , a large mirror found in an antique store was refinished and added_to the mix . The mirror was scrubbed of its painted color down to a metallic gold and rubbed with a black wash ; a touch of the zebra print fabric was added . The completed reading / sitting area is one Williams uses often : &quot; It ' s really comfortable , &quot; she says . By the time the sitting area was done , Williams had decided she liked the drama of the darker colors . She decided to buy a black bedspread , which meant she ended_up not using the original white bedspread that started the whole project . &quot; That is how I like to work , &quot; said Divel . &quot; It ' s more fun because you create as you go_along . You ' re able to add something you ' d never thought_of until you came_across it , and you solve problems that you never anticipated . When Ashley and I went shopping for the original fabric for the futon , it took hours . And then when we picked the fabric we liked , only a black bedspread would look good with it . that ' s what made_it fun and not some by-the-book look. &quot; Among the existing furnishings that underwent a dramatic change was the metal bed frame . It had been painted with many coats of white paint through the years . &quot; We sand-blasted it down to a natural metal , almost pewter color , &quot; said Divel . &quot; Then we started painting it using the combination we used on everything : metallic copper , gold and a little bit of silver. &quot; At the head of the bed they draped gauze fabric to give the illusion of being in a tent in the Moroccan desert and then held the gauze back with two golden lion heads they found in an antique shop . When a new mattress was purchased for the bed , it was so_much higher than the original one that the bedside table they had also picked_up in an antique store now seemed too short . The solution : add metallic balls to make_it taller . &quot; Originally I was just going_to crackle the table to go_with the rest of the furniture , but since it was so low we added the gold balls in the center to raise it up . It was never all that valuable , so we didn ' t ruin any priceless antique , &quot; Divel said . The new , fantasy-like table goes better with the all-over look of the room than the original one ever would have . On the bed , Divel made over-sized pillows to coordinate with the ones on the floor , and a lamp purchased by Williams ' mother was added_to the side table . * Much of the drama in the room comes from the rich golden color Williams and Divel added_to of the walls . After removing the original wallpaper -- white with blue and pink flowers -- they painted the room . The gold paint was applied with rollers , and then old T-shirts were used to wipe the still-wet paint off in sweeping motions . The process gave the walls a warm , weathered look . It was difficult to achieve a consistent effect because the paint needed to be rubbed before it dried . Track lighting on the wood cathedral ceiling illuminates the artwork and filters through the gauze around the bed , making shadow patterns on the walls . &quot; Getting the shadows right was very important to me , &quot; said Williams . &quot; I like the look they cast_on the walls. &quot; In the far end of the room , a wooden chest of drawers that was once white has been given a crackled finish using the copper , gold and silver motif . On top of the chest is a lion lamp painted in the same colors -- it was also once white . &quot; I wanted that lamp out of the room , &quot; said Divel , &quot; but Ashley liked it , so we painted it and added a black lampshade with the zebra print on it . That was a good compromise. &quot; Williams ' favorite painting is Van Gogh ' s &quot; Sunflowers , &quot; so Divel found a print of it , added an antiqued frame and matted it to coordinate with the mirror frame . Left_over from her young-girl ' s room are a Mexican desk and chair that were left unchanged except for the addition of a tapestry cushion to the chair . A black metal Mexican lamp on the table casts the shadows on the wall that Williams loves . The original off-white carpeting was also kept , although Williams and Divel are both on the lookout for a rug to go_on top of it . * The drapes , made of an off-white fabric painted with gold vertical stripes , hang from a wrought-iron rod , also designed by Brunetta . In the adjoining bathroom , cabinets and walls were repainted in a blend of gold , red , blue and copper tones that suggest an ethereal sunset . For the light fixture , Divel took an old , long , rusted piece of metal and drilled_holes in it for dressing-room-like light_bulbs . The fixture runs the entire length of the bathroom mirror . &quot; Every time that we thought we were finished , we came_up with another idea , &quot; said Williams . In working with Divel on the project , Williams said she succeeded not only in leaving_behind the young-girl look of her room , but also in opening open_up an artistic side of herself she hadn ' t used before .</TEXT>
