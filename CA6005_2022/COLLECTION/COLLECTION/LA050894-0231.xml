   <HEADLINE> THE 21ST CENTURY IS NOW ; WITH SMALL , EVERYDAY CHOICES -- WHETHER TO GREET A STRANGER , WHERE TO BUY A CARTON OF MILK -- WE ' VE ALREADY DETERMINED THE SHAPE AND FEEL OF THE NEXT MILLENNIUM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The year 2000 . . . we ' ve heard about that date all our lives . The phrase itself has become a staple of our language , signifying the moment when the real future begins . Our civilization has been talking_about &quot; the year 2000 &quot; incessantly , it seems , at least since 1905 , when historian Henry Adams predicted that &quot; every American who lived into the year 2000 would know how to control unlimited power. &quot; We ' ve prophesied , fantasized , invented , planned , revised our plans and revised them again . Somehow it ' s always seemed so far off , that fabled year . But in less than six years we ' ll be writing that date in our checkbooks and on our letters ; we ' ll see that date on our newspapers and on our license_plates . And after all this anticipation , we will wake to the year 2000 surprised , perhaps even amazed , to find that the citizens of the 21st Century are not a marvelous generation of some brave new_world ; no , they are only you and I . Just us folks . For , in fact , the 21st Century is our time , and its formation is our task . ( Does a little voice say to you as it says to me , &quot; Oh my God , if we ' re the A-team , we ' re in_trouble ? &quot; ) I suspect that the first morning of the year 2000 will be very much like one of those birthdays that are supposed to mean so_much , the &quot; turning-point &quot; birthdays : 21 , 30 , 40 , 50 . On such a morning you don ' t feel very different from how you felt the day before . You look the same . Your dilemmas haven ' t changed . Your political and religious views are the same and so are your feelings for your family . You are hours older and not very much wiser , and you still must go_to work in the same car , or on the same bus , to pay the same rent or the same mortgage . If anything , your anxiety on such a morning is not at the arrival of change but at the lack of it . You may have feared turning , say , 40 , but you also expected a certain level of maturity by the time you got that far . So on top of your usual anxiety there ' s a sense that something ' s missing . If you ' re at all like me on such landmark dates , you expect a little more of yourself , but you don ' t quite know how to go_about being what you expect . This can make_for a quiet but pervasive mood of disorientation . Imagine an entire civilization going_through such a turning point and feeling such disorientation . That , rather than any brave new_world , is likely to be our society ' s general atmosphere in the year 2000 , the first year of the 21st Century . For it ' s as though we ' ve imagined , collectively , that in the year 2000 some huge ceremonial door would open , and we ' d all walk through , in stately fashion , to a new_world order that was somehow already laid_out for us , as though our destiny required no more of us than that we show_up . But if it ' s not like that . . . if Jan . 1 , 2000 , is not going_to be so terribly different from Dec . 31 , 1999 . . . and since 1999 is only five years away . . . then in a sense we ' re already living_in the 21st Century . Like a lot that ' s happened in the past few decades , the 21st Century has arrived out_of_breath , earlier than expected , without asking anyone ' s permission and without waiting for us to get ready . The car you buy_in the next couple of years is probably the car you ( or someone who buys_it used ) will drive into the next millennium . Not Batman ' s car , not an anti-gravity car that floats above the road , probably not even an electric or ethanol car , but your car . So today is not a prelude , nor an in-between time , nor an interlude , nor a rehearsal . Today is it . Welcome to the 21st Century . HOW ARE WE CREATING THIS 21ST CENTURY OF OURS ? WE ' RE NOT SITTING_down and planning it . We ' re creating it by the impact of millions of people making hundreds of millions of small choices every day . The creation and re-creation of civilization is not about great thinkers and inventors and policians -- the &quot; newsmakers &quot; who number only a tiny percentage of the population . ( After all , their innovations only count insofar as the rest of us take them to heart. ) Civilization , or the lack of it , is about what normal struggling people do from morning till bedtime . Take a basic human_activity like shopping . Until about 40 years ago , people shopped_at small stores and markets in their neighborhoods and towns . Shoppers knew their clerks and store owners by name . Credit wasn ' t based on a TRW rating , it was based on your personal reputation . Then &quot; supermarkets &quot; came_in . There was more selection , higher volume , lower prices , and people liked that . But you didn ' t know the clerks anymore , you never met the owners , and you couldn ' t run_up a tab . On a less obvious level , the money spent in the community didn ' t stay in the community ; it went_to the company that owned the supermarket . Things became more convenient but less personal . And the strength of the community went elsewhere . It didn ' t feel_like we were making a major decision about society ; it felt_like we were choosing to buy milk for a nickel less a carton . Nevertheless , a massive collective decision was being made that turned the direction of our civilization . Nobody was forced to give_up community for convenience ; the choice was presented to us , and we chose . We may bemoan the loss of community now , but this is one of the ways we lost_it . Then , about 30 years ago , supermarkets begat malls . All over America , small-town and neighborhood storefronts became empty as malls grew . Again , malls were more convenient . All one ' s shopping could be done from one parking place . And again , we thought we were just going shopping . We didn ' t realize we were building the basic atmosphere of the 21st Century . Then some more inventors and entrepreneurs came_along and offered us cable_television . Dozens of channels will soon become hundreds of channels . Many of those channels are shopping channels , and they ' re already doing very well . Some predict that within a decade much of our shopping will be done electronically . So in half a century we will have gone from family stores to supermarkets to malls to a world in which stores as we know them may become an endangered species . And what will disappear with the stores ? Shopping by cable , of course , is convenient , and convenience is something we all like . But television shopping means we need fewer stores , and fewer local jobs -- fewer clerks , drivers , janitors , mechanics , plumbers , construction workers and managers . So people move , following the work , and our communities become less stable . We don ' t mean to destabilize them , but we do nonetheless -- just because of the way our shopping has changed . The decrease in advertising will decrease ad revenues for newspapers and magazines , so you ' ll have to be hooked_up to a computer news service to get the in-depth coverage that broadcast news isn ' t designed for -- if you can afford a computer , i.e. , if you ' re not one of the people who ' s lost a good job because of the way shopping has changed . It ' s a rather innocent 21st Century activity , shopping . We take it for granted and yet willy-nilly we ' ve each helped do_away_with the communities we miss so_much . And nobody meant to . We were just trying to buy a carton of milk for a_few pennies less , and we turned the 20th Century into the 21st . When we lost those communities we also lost our political stability . Political parties meant something in our old communities , both in small_towns and big cities . Parties were organized into stable power blocs that , whatever their faults , could get basic things done for local people . But when we streamlined commerce and destabilized those communities , the power blocs went the way of the jobs , and on a political level it became much harder to get anything done . We don ' t have time to conceive_of , or build , the new political institutions necessary for our new fragmented communities . We don ' t have time to make them accountable or even decipherable . We ' re too busy trying to find some kind of job security in a world where jobs are disappearing and changing faster than we can keep track . But the politicians don ' t really have time to reconstitute our institutions either . They ' re scrambling through a frantic agenda of patchwork and catch-up , trying ( with various levels of sincerity ) to make a rickety system cope_with a situation that is not only new but that won ' t stay_put . They can ' t help but be ineffectual . Now a majority of us have stopped voting because we don ' t believe_in the political_system anymore -- a political_system that ' s changed partly ( but not insignificantly ) because of things like how we shop . So we arrive_at a 21st Century where we want more employment , but the choices we ' ve made about commerce decrease employment . We want more cohesive communities , but the choices we ' ve made about commerce take the economic and social spine out of communities . We want the politicians to address these issues , but the choices we ' ve made about commerce make the politicians more and more powerless . We thought we were merely changing a form -- merely changing how we did something . We didn ' t mean to change the entire context and content of what we did . But the catch is : When you change a form , no matter how innocently , you often dump the old content . In the form of the old way of shopping , the content was community and familiarity . With the new form , one-to-one human contact is gone and with it eventually goes community . We could write to our congressperson , but what would we say ? We could stage a demonstration , but what would we demand ? We can ' t have the old forms back , and the new forms are driving us crazy . The massive effect of our millions of daily-life choices has left us in a millennium ( albeit a_few years ahead of time ) that no one can fathom , predict or control . WELL , WHAT ' S DONE IS VERY MUCH DONE . I GET_UP IN THE MORNING IN A small apartment in a big city , Los Angeles , 3 # 000 miles from where I was born . My family lives in Boston , New York and Florida . Most of my friends are scattered ( one called today to tell me she might manage a restaurant in Hanoi. ) There are 32 apartments in this building . A close friend lives in one of them , and I ' m thankful for that -- it ' s a blessing most people don ' t have in this or any big city anymore , a close friend down the hall . I know four or five other neighbors to talk to on the stairs as we pass . Every month , it seems , faces change , people I didn ' t know move_out , people I probably won ' t know move_in . With the exception of one couple , every person in this building lives alone . In fact , in this society almost 25 % of us live alone . This is extraordinary . No society ever organized itself this way -- although the word &quot; organized &quot; doesn ' t describe what ' s happened . It just fell_out like this , with the dissolution of communities . This means that 25 % of our people have no one to care_for them if they are ill . No one to talk to when they come_home from work , no sense of being footsteps away from people to whom our welfare is crucial . We exaggerate the importance of celebrities and pundits on TV because they ' re the faces we see most consistently , outside of work . that ' s what a cheaper carton of milk has come_to cost in the 21st Century . Another 17 % of American households with_children are headed by single parents who are far from their families , without much adult companionship except at_work and no social life . That makes_it hard to build a sense of community -- hard even to feel a part of a neighborhood . Kids look_at how their parents are living , isolated and worried about an economy in which they could lose even the life they have ; this drains the children of a sense_of_purpose . It feels_like a chaotic world in which just holding_on is an exhausting exercise , and what we ' re holding to isn ' t really what we want . There is something humiliating about having to hold so hard to something so far from our ideals . It ' s no wonder that so many of us slip , no wonder that America has far higher percentages of its people in prisons and in need of psychiatric care than anywhere else in the world . Our politicians don ' t talk much about the daily lives of their constituents : If they spoke realistically about how we live we ' d expect them to do something about it , and who knows what to do ? So they talk_about foreign_policy and international trade . Or they try to relate to us with issues like health_care and crime -- important issues , but when we had real communities our health_care was more personal and far less expensive , and crime was mostly something that happened in the movies . Hence many Americans wake_up as I do , in small apartments in big cities , confused about what ' s next , what to do , where to go , how to be . We talk to our acquaintances about the weather , sports or the week ' s most sensational news_item , not because we ' re especially interested but because that ' s all we think we have in common . It ' s a lonely , frightened and insecure time , but we can ' t talk_about our anxieties , so a lot of us think that we ' re all alone feeling lonely , frightened and insecure . Actually , that ' s what we really have in common . And the brave fronts we put_up can ' t create that sense of community without which so_much feels hollow . The sky is still blue , sunsets are still beautiful , spring still follows winter , and occasionally there ' s even a movie that can make you laugh or cry . But I watch my neighbors go_off in the morning to jobs they don ' t seem especially happy about ( though any job is better than no job ) . I stand_in line for coffee at the corner cafe with people I see every day but barely speak_to . And I know that they ' re looking_at me the way I ' m looking_at them . We are all citizens of the 21st Century , people from whom all_the old answers have been stripped , people looking_for ways to live_in this fast-forward world . Many technologists , scientists , writers and even a_few politicians assure us that the dilemmas of our new millennium will be addressed by what they call &quot; the information superhighway. &quot; By this they mean the extension of a world-wide computer_network already in the making -- a network which many are looking_to with profound hope . Right now , any individual with a basic computer and modem can tap into this new_world network , can call_up information about almost anything from almost anywhere and communicate with people all_over the world . With new electronic advances hooking_up telephones , televisions , faxes and computers , a worldwide electronic nervous_system will connect any place that can generate electricity . Cities can be rearranged . Many businesses are run and managed by individuals working in their homes connected by computer to &quot; virtual offices , &quot; though the workers are miles and even whole states apart . &quot; Virtual communities &quot; link like-minded individuals who communicate solely by computer , whether their interest is chess , pornography or the stock_market , and any individual with a computer can belong_to many virtual communities simultaneously . You may be a citizen of Los Angeles or Austin , Tex. , but your community can include China , Michigan , Brazil , Germany , Israel , India and Algeria . There will probably soon be computer_programs that automatically and instantaneously translate any language into a language you can read on your screen . You can travel this information superhighway anywhere , for any reason , at any time , and you don ' t have to leave your desk . But after you ' ve spent some time as a computer citizen of the world , what happens to your allegiances ? Multinational corporations have already eroded national power and national interests on a multinational scale ; what will be the effect of multinational citizens ? Totalitarian states like China have discovered that they can ' t compete economically without plugging into the incredibly fluid , and intrinsically empowering and freedom-expanding technology of the West . This has threatened their authority over their own people . But all states , even democratic ones , like to exercise at least a little authority over their own people . How does one govern millions of individuals whose daily interests cross national boundaries and whom one can ' t control except by shutting_down the very system that one ' s economy is based on ? After these millions are acclimated to an international world_view , how does that change the way they vote_in the country where their computer happens to be ? Will the very idea of &quot; nation &quot; blur in individuals as it has in corporations ? What interests will the President of the United States appeal_to when both daily life and the national economy are international as a matter_of_course ? A President today already has far less power than a President in the days of Lyndon B . Johnson and Richard M . Nixon . Can our system of government stand a presidency that is even weaker ? Again : You can ' t change the form without changing the content . Both our economy and our technology are pushing us toward this new way of being , or not being , American citizens of the 21st Century . But what remains American when many of our most affluent , intelligent and productive citizens ( for it takes a certain amount of affluence , intelligence and productivity to plug into the system ) spend lots of &quot; virtual time &quot; away from America ? We assume , at least in rhetoric , that the information superhighway will solve our economic problems , but we forget that while information aids in the making of things , it doesn ' t , in and of itself , do the making . People working in factories do most of the making . The computers we use are made by factory_workers in places like Japan and South_Korea , which is why their economies have boomed while ours has limped . Information doesn ' t construct houses , harvest vegetables , herd cattle or build furniture . Even in the 21st Century work remains manual . And countries in which such jobs abound may have a better chance at a more viable future than those countries in which they don ' t -- especially when many millions of new workers join the worldwide work_force every year . The technocrats who want us to solve our problems by being more dependent_on information industries tend to miss this point . We cannot be strong , economically or politically , when we ' re dependent_on other countries for everything from socks to computers , no matter how much information we have . Since the information superhighway is the best our most enlightened politicians can offer ; and since the industries that make socks , computers and most everything else are gone_for good ; then American citizens of the 21st Century have to reframe their questions . If it ' s unrealistic to seek to be strong , shouldn ' t we seek to be something else ? What is the point of being a superpower , on an information superhighway , if we can ' t afford what ' s at the supermarket ? WE CITIZENS OF THE 21ST CENTURY DON ' T WAKE_UP IN THE MORNING with this question at the tip of our tongues , but it is becoming implicit_in our lives . It affects the way we walk down the street ( secure or frightened ? ) , the way we do our jobs , the way we watch TV . It affects whom we listen to and what we listen for . Bubbling under our discourse are other questions , such_as : What is more important now , convenience or community ? What should we spend our money on , military super-status or stable neighborhoods ? Where ' s the balance , what are the trade-offs ? The questions haven ' t been formulated in the public discourse yet , but our eyes are troubled with them . Issues like foreign_policy will ultimately be decided not by the newsmakers , but by whether we might be willing to live_in a less powerful country if we could live more cohesive lives . These questions hover on the edge of our daily lives , but we wake_up concerned with more immediate things . Basic issues like the meaning of marriage , what it means to be a man or a woman and how we should behave toward our own and other people ' s children are like potholes in the sidewalk that we trip over every day . In these matters , so crucial to our daily happiness , we have no one to turn_to but ourselves and each other in the 21st , as in any century . It is no coincidence that when communities were stable , family life tended to be stable . Not necessarily happy , or even fulfilling ( there is certainly plenty of data showing that women were not fulfilled ) , but stable . Now the way we ' ve chosen to conduct commerce , and the inventions we ' ve eagerly brought into our homes ( and it ' s worth repeating that no one forced us to buy the TVs , the stereos , cable and the computers ; we ' ve worked ourselves ragged to have these things ) -- these have fragmented our communities . So we ' re trying to make a life among the fragments . Take the example that ' s become apocryphal in America today : How do you react to a child you don ' t know ? If the child ' s in some difficulty , do you ignore the child because you ' re afraid of being sued ? Do you show kindness , though even kindness brings one under suspicion these days ? Do you act according to your best instincts and take your chances ? What are your responsibilities to the child and what are your responsibilities to yourself ? Whatever you do , you ' re setting a precedent -- you ' re becoming part of a collective precedent-setting that ' s going_on in all parts of our lives as we try to find manners for communities in which people do not know , and therefore do not trust , one another . It is difficult to conceive how different such communities are from those in which people have lived till this new millennium . In Africa they used to say , &quot; It takes a whole village to raise a child. &quot; This means that everyone in the village was trusted , because to be born in a village -- an African , a European , a New England or a Southern village -- was to know in your bones that you would be seeing the people around you for the rest of your life . Now I live_in an apartment_building where there are new faces almost every month . To say &quot; good_morning &quot; to a stranger is a small act of courage , often greeted with uneasiness ; not to say it is an act of submission to an atmosphere of mutual suspicion . In such living conditions , every word makes or breaks a pattern . That is why the &quot; politically correct &quot; debate rages furiously , along with the issues raised by the religious right and the gay community . Rightly or wrongly , factions are trying , some by legislation and some by instigation , to force new patterns and set new precedents . The social stress of daily life is largely the stress of living in an absolutely new , raw era that gives us nothing to go_by . What can a man say to a woman on_the_job ? Men and women have never worked as equals before , at the same jobs , in any civilization we know about . Can teachers express their own views to a class or must they go_by rigid codes ? This is perhaps the most intimidating quality of our 21st Century . It is so malleable that no one can guess even so_much as what will be considered acceptable manners in 10 or 20 years . Predictions are pointless . All the fancy think_tanks and all_the best-selling authors , not to mention the CIA and the National Security_Council and all_of our elected officials , apparently did not know in 1988 what awaited us in 1989 , the year the Soviet Bloc crumbled of its own weight with hardly_a shot fired . There is no point in looking_to that stratum of society for guidance . Nobody knows what ' s coming , except that it will be an extension of how we live every day . If we live with courage , there will be courage to draw_on in the future . If we don ' t , there won ' t be . If we act_out of fear and suspicion and intolerance , then fear and suspicion and intolerance will build the coming world . The 21st Century will be what we are , not what we imagine . What am I then , in this small apartment , in this big city ? In part I ' m somebody who isn ' t interested in another statistic and who won ' t believe another prediction . I don ' t trust television , but I get most of my information there . Many people not so very different from me are showing_up on talk_shows , hosted by people like Oprah , talking on TV to strangers about what they don ' t usually talk_about to their neighbors -- we ' re that hungry to share our anxieties and opinions . We call_in to radio shows to give opinions about what we half-know , what we have incomplete information about . Then we tune_in to news_shows , where our leaders seem to have little more information than we do ( sometimes they seem to have less ) . When we look_to where the centers should be , where they ' ve been in the past , we often find a confusion that is greater than ours . Thus far the distinguishing feature of our 21st Century is that we are_on our own . The dissolution of our communities and the helplessness of those in authority have left us exposed to . . . ourselves . Our limits , our depths , our lacks , our abilities . So who I am , in this small apartment , is a person whose era , whose time in history , forces me back upon my own resources , on my own spirit . How that fact is met in this apartment , and in all_the other small apartments and mortgaged houses , will determine the history of tomorrow . For history is not a spectator sport . It is what you think and I do . There is no comfort but to remember that everything we do now is an exploration -- potentially as exciting as it is frightening . ( It ' s frightening , after all , because it ' s exciting . Dull things aren ' t scary. ) Far from being powerless , we who must move through our days making the millions of small decisions that create our world -- it is we who exert enormous power . How we shop , what we eat , how we entertain ourselves ; our attitudes toward strangers , people of other races , our neighbors ' children ; whether we decide to vote and on what we base that vote ; where we decide to live , and what we tolerate or do not tolerate in our surroundings -- these are the building_blocks of what will come . The new millennium has begun .</TEXT>
