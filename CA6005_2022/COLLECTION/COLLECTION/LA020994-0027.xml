   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / RUTH ROSEN : MACKINNON DOES NOT SPEAK FOR ME ; THE LEGAL SCHOLAR IS WRONG TO MAKE PORNOGRAPHY , NOT POVERTY , THE MOST URGENT FEMINIST ISSUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Poverty , not pornography , is the most pressing feminist issue of the 1990s . But try telling that to Catharine MacKinnon , the charismatic legal scholar who has been waging a passionate campaign against pornography . MacKinnon is a superstar on the college lecture circuit , and her fans have played a decisive role in derailing the feminist_movement from addressing women ' s most urgent problems . The controversy is hardly new . Feminists have clashed over pornography since the 1970s . Some have closed their eyes and held their noses , committed to the principle of free speech . Others , like MacKinnon , have argued that since pornography causes sexual violence against women -- an unproved premise hotly contested by social_scientists -- it should be banned . In her new book , &quot; Only Words , &quot; Mac-Kinnon goes_further , arguing that pornography is not merely speech but a hostile act that must be banned as a violation of women ' s civil_rights . For MacKinnon , words are the same as acts ; like sticks and stones , they break your bones . Her argument is seductively clever : If pornography is a hostile act , then protecting women from violence is more important than defending smut as &quot; free speech. &quot; MacKinnon ' s claim that sexual violence is a violation of women ' s civil_rights is right on target ; rape is a terrorist act that reinforces women ' s inequality . But sexual violence and pornography are not the same thing . And what if pornography is -- as_many contend -- a symptom but not a cause of American society ' s misogynist depiction and treatment of women ? Then MacKinnon ' s effort to pit free speech against women ' s equality creates a bogus choice . Chipping_away_at the First_Amendment is rarely a good idea , and especially dangerous for groups committed to radical social change . Censorship , as history teaches , is more likely to be used to silence leftists and feminists than pornographers . The situation in Canada is a case_in_point . In 1992 , MacKinnon ' s analysis influenced the Canadian Supreme Court to permit censorship of pornography when it portrays &quot; women as a class as objects for sexual exploitation. &quot; Not surprisingly , Canadian censors first targeted gay and lesbian bookstores . Uninformed and confused customs officials have seized books written by Oscar Wilde , Audre Lorde , Marguerite Duras and Jean Genet . Poverty , not pornography , is what steals women ' s dreams and starves their spirits . The much publicized glass ceiling is not what afflicts most American women ; it is the sticky floor that keeps so many women glued to poverty . Think_about it . How many women would identify pornography as the source of their misery ? Ask a single mother raising her children on minimum_wage if pornography is her greatest problem . Ask a battered wife if pornography is what she most fears . Visit an illegal sweatshop and ask immigrant women if pornography is the cause of their degraded existence . Ask a mother who tries to shield her children from stray bullets if pornography is her worst nightmare . Go_to a poor neighborhood polluted by toxic_waste and ask the mothers if pornography is what most threatens the health of their families . Consider , instead , what does affect women ' s daily lives : poverty and the fear of domestic and sexual violence . Without economic equality , women can ' t leave violent husbands . Without accessible , quality child_care , women can ' t work -- or get_off welfare . Without an adequate minimum_wage , women can ' t feed their families . Without paid family leave , many working mothers must choose between survival or neglect of their babies . Without a ban against guns and assault weapons , women fear for their children ' s safety . Without a drastic change in the social_contract , women can ' t walk the streets or relax at_home without fearing violence . In the wake of the Cold_War ' s end , we have the political opportunity to form a feminist economic agenda that crosses class and race lines . Pornography is not the worst obscenity . Yes , it reinforces degraded views of women , but real obscenity is a hungry child , a teen-ager without hope , a homeless family , a battered wife or the permanently unemployed victims of capital flight . The greatest indecency in America is not pornography but poverty in the midst of plenty .</TEXT>
