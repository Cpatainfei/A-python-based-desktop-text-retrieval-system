   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : SOUTH-CENTRAL ; POSTERS AND DOCUMENTS TRACE HISTORY OF BLACK PANTHERS ; UNTIL THE LIONS HAVE THEIR HISTORIANS , TALES OF HUNTING WILL ALWAYS GLORIFY THE HUNTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This African proverb acts_as a bookend to &quot; All Power to the People , &quot; a showcase of protest posters , graphics , newspapers and government documents produced during the height of the Black Panther Party . Compiled by the West Los Angeles-based Center for the Study of Political Graphics , the 94-piece exhibition is at the Southern California Library for Social Studies and Research , 6120 S . Vermont Ave. , through Jan . 31 . &quot; We can ' t understand the present if we don ' t understand history , &quot; said Carol Wells , one of the founders of the center and curator of the show . &quot; If we really want to understand history , we have to look_at these posters. &quot; The 31-year-old library and the center are nonprofit operations that collect material on social struggles and political_movements . The exhibition , which borrows its name from a 1969 poster by Black Panther artist Emory Douglas , takes the viewer on a historical tour from the beginnings of the party to its triumphant days of political empowerment and its demise through government intervention and intra-party splintering . &quot; All the issues that the Panthers tried to struggle against -- racism , illiteracy , health_care , hunger -- are still issues today that need to be confronted , &quot; Wells said . &quot; This is a show of what the Panthers wanted to accomplish and what happened to them . We are providing an introduction of what they were. &quot; Scenes of police brutality and racial violence captured on film or depicted by artists hang side-by-side , testament to the volatility of an era of black political empowerment that followed the 1965 Watts riots . Part 1 of the series , &quot; A Call to Arms , &quot; outlines how the party was modeled after the Community Alert Patrol , a watchdog organization formed to protect black citizens of Watts from unlawful police_actions . Founded by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale , the Black Panther Party called_on its members to bear weapons for self-defense . The notorious 1970 poster of Newton in Panther garb , sitting in a peacock chair wielding an African spear in one hand and a machine_gun in the other , opens the second series , &quot; Serving the People. &quot; Eighteen posters and other media report the party ' s political ambitions , from free medical health clinics to a grocery giveaway . Three other sections depict how the party grew and then was dismantled by violence and government subversion . FBI documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act hang as evidence of government action to stymie the party ' s growth . &quot; The Struggle Continues , &quot; the last portion of the display , brings the party to the present with poster No . 90 , &quot; Free Geronimo Pratt. &quot; Pratt , who was the party ' s deputy minister of defense and head of the South-Central chapter , is serving a life sentence in the 1968 killing of a schoolteacher and the wounding of her husband . Pratt has steadfastly maintained that he was elsewhere at the time . Because the Panthers split in 1970 , Wells said , Pratt was forgotten during his trial by infighting party members . &quot; When we do these ( types of ) exhibits , we don ' t expect people to agree . There are different ways in seeing the world , &quot; Wells said . &quot; In collecting these posters , we are the historians for the ' lions. ' &quot; ENRIQUE LAVIN</TEXT>
