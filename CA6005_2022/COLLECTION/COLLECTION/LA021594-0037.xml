   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin is scheduled to give his first Russian version of a State of the Union address on Friday , as required by the country ' s newly adopted constitution . Looking_for widespread acceptance , he has invited lawmakers from both houses of Parliament , members of his Cabinet , leaders of all_the republics in the Russian Federation , foreign ambassadors and the press to hear the speech in the Kremlin ' s Marble Hall . The president is expected to lay out his legislative and political agenda for the first time since he crushed a revolt by hard-line lawmakers last October . His administration is taking special pains to cultivate the new Parliament , but early indications suggest that the Duma , or lower house , may prove as hostile to Yeltsin as the Supreme Soviet he dissolved .</TEXT>
