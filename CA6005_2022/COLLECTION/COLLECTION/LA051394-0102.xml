   <HEADLINE> BUILDING AN IMPRESSION ; * AN EXHIBIT BY SEVEN ARTISTS EXPLORES HOW ARCHITECTURE INFLUENCES THE WAY WE THINK AND FEEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Architecture has an impact on us every day of our lives . The dwellings we live and work in can provide the foundation for a better life or an uncomfortable existence . In some circum stances , such_as earthquakes , they can even collapse on us and kill us . Despite architecture ' s omnipresence , how much thought do we really give to the effect a building ' s design and construction has_on us ? &quot; Architecture is so_much a part of our lives , and we take it for granted , &quot; Artspace gallery director Scott Canty said . &quot; It ' s funny how we build these huge , monumental structures like the ones Downtown . We want to show we ' re the best . It reminds me of the story of Babel. &quot; He has organized the exhibit , &quot; Artists and Architecture , &quot; in the Woodland Hills gallery to &quot; explore and question how our architecture influences the way we think and feel , &quot; he said . The seven artists in the show &quot; use elements of architecture to talk_about something else : social , spiritual and environmental concerns. &quot; Candice Gawne accentuates the potential for excitement in our living environments with her dramatic use of light . The open_doors of the assemblage , &quot; Mi Casa es Su Casa &quot; invite viewers into a domicile pulsating with neon . The room in the painting , &quot; The Bed , &quot; has been energetically illuminated by two lamps on either side of the bed . With this light and the painting ' s contrasting dark , moody palette , one is given the sense that something mysterious is about to take_place here , or maybe it already did . Richard Sedivy works with oil , varnish and phosphorescent paint on Masonite to realize his visions of home , which glow in the dark . In &quot; The Joy House , &quot; a simple , angular dwelling stands next to the word , &quot; joy , &quot; presented in bubbly , flowing curves that convey the exhilaration inherent in the word . The outright gaiety of &quot; The Joy House &quot; seems somewhat tempered in &quot; Rosy Blemish : A Sense of Alacrity &quot; by the many screws that have been driven into its structure . Yet , the symbols of nature -- among them a flower , fruit , leaf and branches -- suggest a liveliness about the structure . Michael Hughes contemplates worlds beyond the home environment in his oil on canvas and wood panel &quot; L.A. Mystery. &quot; It pulls viewers in with seductive images typical of a good mystery novel or film set_in L.A. -- palm_trees , a bungalow , silhouetted figures , car headlights beaming in the night . In the oil on burlap and wood panels of &quot; Cathedrals , &quot; an industrial_plant rests above two cathedrals resembling Notre Dame . Below the cathedrals , another picture suggests an urban skyline . Underneath it is a wavy form , much like a snake . &quot; There is a sense of the story but the plot_line is not truly revealed . The viewer supplies that which is missing to complete the plot , &quot; Hughes writes_about these works . &quot; This incomplete story creates a mystery or enigma about the meaning of each piece and the relationship of the characters in it. &quot; Freeways are central to Seta Injeyan ' s feelings about nature , architecture and us . In the middle of each painting is her photograph of a freeway section . From the photograph she moves_out onto the canvas with her paints , creating expressionistic views of_her_own inner landscape as well as the physical one before her eyes . Kristan Marvell questions humankind ' s use of natural , organic forms in its designs and construction in his dimly lit installation &quot; Requisite Columns. &quot; The sturdy-looking , wood-like beams that seem to come_out of or hold_up the roof are actually made from Styrofoam he carved and painted . In exploring the artist ' s role in society , Richard Turner created &quot; I Was Hitler ' s Curator. &quot; Reading about the art of the Third_Reich , Turner learned that Hitler had planned a grand museum to house the works his Nazi regime had commissioned , purchased and stolen . Taking the role of Hitler ' s curator and architect , Turner has drawn an imaginary floor_plan for this museum , which is in the form of the words , Kunst Halle ( Art Hall ) . The artwork titles and artists listed in the drawings were taken from books about the art of the Third_Reich . Turner writes : &quot; The piece poses the question , What would I have done had I been an artist in Hitler ' s Germany ? Would I have resisted enlistment in the National_Socialist enterprise and been persecuted or driven into exile , or would I have allowed myself to become co-opted by the state like the artists whose names and works make_up this drawing ? &quot; Also in the show is photographic work by Jody Zellen . WHERE AND WHEN What : &quot; Artists and Architecture. &quot; Location : Artspace Gallery , 21800 Oxnard St. , Woodland Hills . Hours : Noon to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays . Ends June 25 . Also : &quot; Conversations with the Artists , &quot; 1:30 p.m. May 28 . Call : ( 818 ) 716-2786 .</TEXT>
