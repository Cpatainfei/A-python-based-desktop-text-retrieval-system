   <HEADLINE> MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ : TASTE OF CHILDHOOD ; FOOD MAKERS ZEROING IN ON YOUNG PALATES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When a single piece of broccoli is tossed into an otherwise innocuous bowl of chopped lettuce , what ' s left is nothing short of a sabotaged salad . Just ask any salad-wise kid . But give that same kid a chance to decide what gets glopped onto the lettuce -- a pizza-flavored dressing , say -- and suddenly that salad has a prayer of passing the kid test . Just ask any kid-wise marketer . In the mounting battle for the estimated $ 132 billion in annual product purchases that children influence , the country ' s big food makers are trying to entice youngsters to nag their folks for groceries that few kids have cared much about -- such_as salad_dressings , yogurt and luncheon_meats . The rub is that some marketers are accomplishing this by adding ingredients that kids love but which few parents want their children to eat : sugar , fat and salt . For years , cereal makers have tried this kids-directed marketing with great success , but now it ' s fast-descending to foods rarely targeted to children . Yet there are trade-offs . While the pizza and nacho-cheese-flavored salad_dressings are fatty , they can coax kids into eating more salad . Several big yogurt makers are adding colorful , sugary toppings -- packaged separately and displayed so kids can ' t miss them -- in_order to get children to at least consider swallowing yogurt . And to attract kids to its newest &quot; lunch kit &quot; of sliced meats and cheeses , one food firm recently began slipping_in very visible packets of candy . The food giants say they are simply selling quality products that appeal_to children . But some marketing experts believe that the food makers may be taking the low road to profits . &quot; You can turn anything into a junk food if you work_on it , &quot; said Alex Molnar , professor of education at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee . &quot; All these marketers ask themselves is this : ' Will it sell ? ' I ' m still waiting for one to come_out with chocolate-covered broccoli. &quot; Ironically , all_of this comes when many food_companies are increasingly making healthier foods for grown-ups who are concerned about more fiber and less fat in their diets . &quot; What you have are food_products getting healthier for adults but less healthy for kids , &quot; said Jayne Hurley , nutritionist at the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest . &quot; I don ' t know why the trend toward healthier eating has excluded kids. &quot; It is one thing to try to attract children by putting cartoon characters on the product label , &quot; but if you ' re making a product less nutritional in_order to sell it to kids , I call that manipulation , &quot; said Dan Acuff , president of Glendale-based Youth Market Systems Consulting . The companies marketing the new products say they are merely selling what consumers tell them they want . The maker of the new salad_dressings , Hidden Valley Ranch , retained a youth marketing expert who went_to shopping_malls in four cities -- including Los Angeles -- and asked 300 children and parents their opinions on salads . Late last week , Hidden Valley , a division of Clorox Co. , set_up a huge salad_bar in front of 200 students at a San Francisco elementary_school to see which of its new dressing flavors -- pizza , nacho cheese or taco -- kids preferred . On that day , Pizza Ranch reigned . Admitted Kenneth Phan , an 11-year-old who was very careful to keep any trace of cabbage out of his salad_bowl oozing with dressing : &quot; I like the dressing more_than the salad. &quot; As for the high fat content of its new dressings -- some 90 % of the calories come from fat , according to the label -- executives at Hidden Valley say that ' s beside the point . * &quot; They encourage kids to eat more salads and vegetables , &quot; said Sandy Sullivan , brand manager at Hidden Valley , whose new dressings begin national distribution this month . &quot; Besides , kids need a certain amount of fat in their diets. &quot; Concerned about the high fat content of the dressings , Samuel Gidding , a pediatric cardiologist at Children ' s Memorial Hospital in Chicago , suggests that children use only one tablespoon instead of the recommended two per serving . Some food makers are using packaging as a way to attract kids to products they might not otherwise consider eating . Several yogurt makers are attempting that by packaging sugary toppings in see-through containers atop the carton . Among the most successful is Dannon ' s , with its Sprinkl ' ins brand yogurt with rainbow-colored sugar sprinkles . &quot; It ' s a great way to get kids who would not eat yogurt to at least try it , &quot; said Diana Allwein , associate product manager at Dannon , who said the yogurt is aimed primarily at children 6 to 12 years old . As for the added sugar , the company says that ' s no big deal . &quot; Four grams of sugar per package isn ' t all that much , &quot; said Becky Ryan , a Dannon spokeswoman . Gidding , who also serves on the American Heart Assn. ' s nutrition committee , said it ' s far better to add fruit than sugar to yogurt . Most important , he said , is to eat low-fat yogurt . * Executives at Oscar Mayer Foods recently decided their &quot; Lunchable Funpacks &quot; -- featuring separately wrapped meats , cheeses and crackers -- weren ' t attracting enough business . So they decided to add M &amp; Ms candy . Sales have picked_up steadily since then , company executives say . Gidding has serious reservations about the Lunchables : &quot; It sounds like a nutritional disaster , &quot; primarily because of the high fat and high salt content , he said . Oscar Mayer executives scoff at that notion . &quot; This is not some big corporate plot to fatten_up kids . This is what kids want , &quot; company spokeswoman Jean Cowden said . &quot; There are very few kids out there who will eat rice cakes and tofu. &quot; Briefly . . . There were smiles all around at Creative Artists Agency on Monday when Coca-Cola introduced its 1994 TV ad_campaign . Some 25 of 28 new TV spots for the soft_drink company were created by the Beverly Hills talent firm . Today Coke is expected to announce a global marketing agreement with the National Basketball Assn . . . . Ketchum Advertising / Los Angeles has picked_up two new pieces of business : the estimated $ 15-million account_for Cypress-based PacifiCare Health Systems and the $ 8-million account_for KFC Southern California Co-Op . PacifiCare was formerly handled by Baxter Stone ; KFC was handled by Lord Dentsu / Los Angeles . Los Angeles-based Davis , Ball &amp; Colombatto has won_back the estimated $ 6-million Knott ' s Berry Farm ad account that has been handled by Santa Monica-based Suissa Miller . . . . The creative portion of the advertising for health club chain Bally ' s Health &amp; Tennis Corp . -- formerly handled by Suissa Miller -- has been handed to the Chicago office of Hal Riney &amp; Partners . Catering to Kids Food_product makers are paying increased attention to children . The numbers tell why . * $ 132 billion in annual purchases are influenced by children . * 650 children ' s products were introduced into grocery_stores in the last five years . * 52 % of boys and 64 % of girls say they sometimes or always accompany parents to the grocery_store . * 62 % of children visit supermarkets each week . * 50 % of children participate in food or brand selection . * 50 % of children say they prefer a different salad dressing than their mothers ' . * 81 % of children prepare their own food at least twice a week . * 78 % of children say they influence family selection of cold_cereal . * Fewer than 20 % of 6-to-14-year-olds say they never shop with their parents . * There are 50 million children ages 5 to 19 in the United States . * A &quot; lifetime &quot; customer can be worth up_to $ 100 # 000 to a retailer .
