   <HEADLINE> BIOTECH ' S VICTORY ON HOLD ; AMGEN IS AMONG 3 FIRMS CLAIMING A BREAKTHROUGH IN BLOOD SCIENCE , WHILE WALL_STREET YAWNS AND WAITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thrombopoietin was given its unwieldy name before anyone was sure it existed . For decades , this mystery hormone was the Holy_Grail of blood science -- believed to be a mere speck in the vast reaches of the blood system , but one with awesome power to make blood_clot . Now , three biotechnology companies , including Thousands Oaks-based Amgen Inc. , say they ' ve found the speck , and cloned it . The announcements , made within a month of each other , represent a breakthrough for science and hope for thousands of cancer patients , whose blood often loses the ability to clot during treatment . Doctors now rely_on risky transfusions to keep such patients from bleeding to death , and they ' re elated at the news about thrombopoietin . &quot; We all want to get our hands on it , &quot; said Stephanie Williams , a doctor who treats cancer patients in Chicago . Financial analysts , though , are more stoic . As promising as the discovery appears to be , it is five years or more from the market . Wall_Street is more interested in what new products these companies have to offer now . And for Amgen , that ' s not much . Under the leadership of chief_executive Gordon Binder , the company is still going strong with two , hugely successful products it developed in the late 1980s . Thanks to those two blood cell-producing drugs , Epogen and Neupogen , 14-year-old Amgen is now the world ' s premier biotechnology company , with a 1993 profit of $ 383.3 million on revenue of $ 1.37 billion . Sales of Neupogen alone were $ 719.4 million in 1993 . If thrombopoietin is approved , most analysts estimate its sales could range from $ 250 million to $ 500 million per year . Demand could be even higher if it turns_out that higher doses of chemotherapy -- which might become more common with the drug in_use -- are effective in fighting cancer . The long process of getting approval for thrombopoietin starts with animal tests . Then , the Food and Drug Administration requires three separate phases of clinical trials on humans , followed by an FDA review . The process can take years , and for new , genetically-engineered products , development costs are typically $ 250 million to $ 400 million , according to Amgen . Analysts say they are looking_for a more immediate encore to Epogen and Neupogen that would propel Amgen ' s growth through the end of the decade , after sales of its existing products level_off . Thrombopoietin &quot; has captured people ' s imagination . . . but in terms of the commercial aspects , this is still a long way off , &quot; said Edmund A . Debler , an analyst at the health-care investment_firm Mehta and Isaly in New York . &quot; Amgen ' s ( research ) pipeline is still weak. &quot; It ' s a criticism that ' s been leveled at Amgen before . Although Amgen is still credited for its stunning rise , some now say its streak has faded . Debler , the analyst , said the problem is this : Although Amgen should continue to be profitable , a gap in its growth may come_in the late 1990s because the company has come_up with no new , blockbuster products that will hit the market by then . This , despite a mammoth budget_for research : Amgen ' s research-and-development budget totaled $ 255 million last year . This problem can ' t be solved by thrombopoietin , which has come too late to tide Amgen over for the rest of this decade , Debler said . Neupogen and Epogen &quot; made Amgen the company of the ' 80s . But what will make them the company of 2000 ? &quot; * Such nay-saying is the curse of success , responded Amgen ' s senior_vice_president for research , Daniel Vapnek . While acknowledging that thrombopoietin is &quot; the most exciting thing we have now , &quot; Vapnek was adamant that there is nothing wrong with Amgen ' s science . Rather , he said , the problem is undue expectations built_upon the company ' s explosive entry into the market . Biotechnology &quot; is a home-run business , &quot; he said , and Amgen hit two early on with Neupogen and Epogen . &quot; It ' s difficult to come_up with products like that on a regular basis , &quot; said Vapnek . Whether thrombopoietin will be another home_run depends_on how well Amgen fares against its competitors in the race for a patent . South San Francisco-based Genentech , and Seattle-based Zymogenetics Inc. , a subsidiary of Novo Nordisk A / S of Denmark , published their findings on thrombopoietin in the June 16 issue of the_British journal Nature . Amgen -- which is working_on thrombopoietin with the pharmaceutical arm of Japan ' s Kirin Brewery -- published its report July 1 in the American journal Cell . All three appear to have isolated the same molecule and are now poised to begin the various stages of clinical trials . * Because all three companies published their results so close_together , a protracted patent process , possibly ending in a court battle , seems inevitable , said Debler , the analyst . In this country , &quot; it will probably come_down to opening_up the lab books to see who found it first , &quot; he said . Alternatively , the companies could avoid a court battle by settling among themselves and marketing the drug jointly , added Debler . But that would mean sharing the potential profits from sales of the drug . The route to market may be quicker if thrombopoietin proves as effective as early signs indicate . The three companies appear to have cloned the same highly specific , highly potent molecule that the body manufactures to stimulate the production of certain blood_cells called platelets . Platelets are wafer-shaped cells that cause blood to clot . Without them , you would bleed to death , either after cutting yourself , or through spontaneous internal bleeding that can ' t be stopped once it ' s started . Platelets pose big problems for cancer patients undergoing certain types of chemotherapy , which involves bombarding the body with poisonous drugs that kill cancer_cells . &quot; They try to give the dose that kills the tumor without killing the person , &quot; explained Don Foster , a molecular biologist at Zymogenetics and senior author of the Nature paper . Chemotherapy can lead to the loss of certain blood_cells . Patients who lose too many white_blood_cells get infections ; those that lose too many platelets have problems with bleeding . Drugs are available that help replenish white_blood_cells -- including Amgen ' s Neupogen . But so far , there is no corresponding drug to replenish platelets . That means doctors must limit doses of chemotherapy to give the blood a chance to restore platelet levels -- hence , the grueling back-and-forth race of cancer treatment , in which chemical attacks on tumors are reined_in just long enough to give the blood a breather . Doctors try to give the body an edge by using other , secondary treatments , such_as platelet transfusions . But these are difficult , risky and expensive . Worse , some patients develop immunity to platelet transfusions , creating a profound dilemma for patient and doctor . The choice is often to continue chemotherapy and hope the patient doesn ' t bleed to death , said Gary Schiller , a doctor who treats leukemia and other cancer patients at UCLA ' s Bowyer Oncology Center . &quot; Sometimes there are miracles. &quot; Doctors believe that doses of thrombopoietin could induce a frenzy of platelet-making in the blood , allowing chemotherapy to resume . That could eliminate the need for platelet transfusions . Other possible applications of the drug could include speeding recovery of cancer patients after bone_marrow transplants and treatment of various blood_disorders . * For now , hopes for thrombopoietin are high -- some say unduly so for a substance that was just a name and a mystery until recently . &quot; It clearly is the right thing . . . . This is the missing puzzle piece in how the bone_marrow manufactures blood_cells , &quot; enthused Zymogenetics ' Foster , noting that the substance yielded a 400 % increase in platelet production when administered to mice . But that confidence may take a while to reach Wall_Street : &quot; The medical experts get excited , &quot; said Joyce Lonergan , an analyst at the investment_firm Cowen &amp; Co . in New York . &quot; But you become jaded as a biotech analyst. &quot;</TEXT>
