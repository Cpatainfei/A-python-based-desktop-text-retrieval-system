   <HEADLINE> CONGRESSMAN MEETS MYANMAR DISSIDENT ; ASIA : DEMOCRAT BECOMES THE FIRST NON-FAMILY MEMBER TO VISIT NOBEL LAUREATE SINCE HER ' 89 HOUSE_ARREST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A U.S. congressman met with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday in the first non-family visit allowed the Nobel Peace Prize_winner in her nearly five years of house_arrest . Rep . Bill Richardson ( D-N.M. ) also engaged in shuttle diplomacy with the ruling military junta to press for her release . But there was no sign of any change in the government ' s position that it will free her only if she agrees to leave Myanmar and live_in exile abroad . &quot; I will not leave the country , &quot; the 1991 winner of the Peace Prize reportedly told Richardson at her home_in the capital , where she has been detained without charge or trial since July , 1989 . &quot; The concept of driving somebody out of_their_own country is totally unacceptable to me , &quot; she told a New York Times reporter who accompanied Richardson , according to today ' s editions of the newspaper . The newspaper said she was in good_spirits and apparently good_health , but noted that she had sold much of the house ' s furniture to buy_food . She also was quoted as saying she had never been allowed to leave the compound of her home during her years in detention . Suu Kyi also told the newspaper that she is willing to negotiate other matters with the military , other_than her leaving the country . But the military has &quot; made no moves to have a dialogue of any kind except on the terms under which I would leave Burma , &quot; she said . Burma is Myanmar ' s former name . Suu Kyi , the daughter of assassinated independence leader Aung San , said she is determined to continue the struggle for democracy in Myanmar , an informed source reported . She expressed interest in discussions with the junta but said she already had been informed that her detention has been extended at least until January , 1995 . She appeared to be in good_health , sources said . Richardson delivered a letter to her from President Clinton , who has called publicly for her release . Both the junta and Suu Kyi sought to benefit from the meeting , which took_place a week before the U.N. Human_Rights Commission is expected to take_up the issue of Myanmar ' s human_rights record , described by international monitoring groups as one of the world ' s worst . According to the State_Department ' s annual human_rights report earlier this month , at least 500 people remain in prison for political reasons despite a clemency program begun in April , 1992 . The junta , which has been trying to improve its image , says more_than 2 # 000 political_prisoners have been released . Monday ' s meeting occurred amid a debate within the U.S._government over the sometimes competing interests of upholding human_rights and suppressing drug trafficking in Myanmar . The country is the world ' s largest source of illicit opium and heroin .</TEXT>
