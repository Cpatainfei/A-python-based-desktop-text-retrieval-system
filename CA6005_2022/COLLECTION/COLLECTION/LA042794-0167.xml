   <HEADLINE> FOOD SAFETY BILL TARGETS CHEMICAL RULES , PESTICIDES ; HEALTH : THE PROPOSAL DRAWS MIXED REVIEWS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL AND INDUSTRY GROUPS . IT WOULD ENCOURAGE FARMERS TO USE SAFER PEST CONTROL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration introduced legislation Tuesday to overhaul food safety and pesticide laws by relaxing the standards for cancer-causing chemicals in processed foods and phasing_out the use of hazardous pesticides on fresh fruits and vegetables . The proposal , which was crafted by the Environmental Protection Agency , the Department_of_Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration , would encourage farmers to use safer pest-control methods while placing new restrictions on the use of chemical pesticides . &quot; We have an urgent need to protect public health by reducing the risks of pesticides , &quot; said EPA Administrator Carol Browner , noting that the use of pesticides has virtually doubled in the last three decades . &quot; Today we have a sound , realistic proposal for ensuring a safe food supply for all Americans , especially our children. &quot; Concerns have risen in recent years over the ingestion of pesticide-treated food by children , whose smaller body_weights may make their exposure riskier . The plan , first announced last September , has drawn mixed reviews from environmental and industry groups . Environmentalists have praised the emphasis on safer farming practices but oppose loosening a Congress-passed ban on cancer-causing chemical residues in processed foods . The food industry has long sought to replace the ban but has attacked other aspects of the plan . The measure would require one standard for determining the amount of pesticide residue that could safely be allowed_in food sold in U.S. markets , replacing the current patchwork of confusing and inconsistent standards . While the so-called &quot; negligible risk &quot; standard would replace the more restrictive ban in the case of processed foods , it also would tighten regulations governing fresh fruits and vegetables . Those regulations now permit the use of some hazardous pesticides for economic reasons . The proposal also restricts the ability of farmers and the food industry to justify use of pesticides for economic reasons and it sets procedures for phasing_out chemicals that pose a significant health risk . The bill gives chemical manufacturers seven years to prove that pesticide residues in food are safe . It also expands the FDA ' s authority to recall and embargo food that contains pesticide levels in excess of those set by the regulations . Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , who , with Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) , has long sought greater regulation of pesticides , called it &quot; imperative that we amend our pesticide laws in_order to protect the public. &quot; It &quot; is especially compelling &quot; because &quot; our laws are wholly inadequate in protecting children from pesticides that may cause them serious harm , &quot; Waxman declared . The public interest Natural_Resources Defense Council praised elements of the plan but said that further reforms are needed . It is &quot; a step_in the right direction -- particularly for our children , &quot; said Erik Olson , a senior attorney for the organization . &quot; Unfortunately , it doesn ' t go_far enough. &quot; The council said that it supports tightening food safety regulations to better protect infants and children and the streamlining of government procedures to cancel the most dangerous pesticides . But the group criticized the bill for failing to prohibit the most dangerous pesticides . A spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America said that the organization supports replacing the &quot; antiquated &quot; ban on all cancer-causing residues but had &quot; significant concerns about the real practicality &quot; of the overall proposal . The National Food_Processors Assn . called the Administration proposal &quot; costly and unworkable. &quot;</TEXT>
