   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : FOUNTAIN VALLEY ; HIGH_SCHOOL WINS TECHNOLOGY GRANT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fountain Valley High_School has won a $ 63 # 000 technology grant from the state_Department of Education . The money will be used to buy new equipment , such_as computers , and for teacher training . The project that won the award involves making &quot; changes in our curriculum and the way we deliver instruction to students , &quot; Assistant Principal Carol Osbrink said . She said that a specific goal will be to link the teaching of English and social studies using computers and other technology . Osbrink said a common teaching theme would be selected for the two classes . &quot; An example might be the theme of ethics , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' d make a thematic instruction project out of ethics , and students in English_classes would read literature on the subject while students in social studies would research historical cases involving ethics. &quot; Computers and laser disks would enable both students and teachers to gather vast amounts of information on theme subjects , Osbrink said . &quot; Teaching this will not only make connections between two subjects but also connect to real_things students can relate to and understand , &quot; Osbrink said . David Hagen , superintendent of the Huntington Beach Union High_School District , which includes Fountain Valley High , praised Principal Gary Ernst and Fountain Valley High for winning the grant . &quot; It is very significant because competition is intense for these grants , &quot; Hagen said.BILL BILLITER</TEXT>
