   <HEADLINE> SHUN NATO , YELTSIN WARNS EX-SATELLITES ; RUSSIA : PRESIDENT CONDEMNS LITHUANIA ' S REQUEST FOR MEMBERSHIP . HE CRITICIZES ' BLOC PSYCHOLOGY ' OF SEEKING PROTECTION FROM MOSCOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin moved swiftly Wednesday to denounce a request from Lithuania for NATO membership and criticize the &quot; bloc psychology &quot; of former Soviet satellites that seek a military alliance to protect them from Russia . Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslav V . Kostikov said the extension of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization to Russia ' s very borders would provoke a negative reaction among the Russian public . He said it would also &quot; promote the development of undesirable moods in civilian and military circles , &quot; a barely veiled reference_to newly elected neo-fascist lawmaker Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , who wants to restore Russia ' s lost empire . Yeltsin fears that a burgeoning NATO could eventually &quot; trigger military-political destabilization in the region which is key for the future of the world , &quot; Kostikov said . The Russian statement followed soothing remarks made Tuesday by U.S. officials , who are backing a &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; program for the Eastern European and Baltic nations as an alternative to NATO membership , to avoid any hint of alienating the Russians . Just days before President Clinton leaves for his first European summit , the United States has been advertising the Partnership for Peace plan as a way to ease European fears without irritating Moscow and re-polarizing Europe . On Wednesday , outgoing U.S. Defense_Secretary Les Aspin telephoned Russian Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev , using a new hot_line that links their offices , to personally invite Russia to join the Partnership for Peace . Aspin said Grachev expressed &quot; interest &quot; during their 55-minute conversation but did not indicate whether Russia might join , the Associated Press reported . A senior U.S. official was optimistic . &quot; I expect Russia will join the Partnership for Peace very soon , &quot; the official said , raising the possibility that an announcement could be made at the upcoming summit . A Russian Defense Ministry spokeswoman said Grachev favors not the expansion of NATO but &quot; the path leading to a truly pan-European security system. &quot; Grachev noted that Russia and NATO already cooperate bilaterally and through multinational groups . While Russia ' s pro-Western Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev has been warm_to the partnership plan , a senior Russian analyst said Wednesday that some Kremlin officials consider it NATO by another name . &quot; For some of them , this Partnership for Peace is just the first_step to expand and absorb the Central European_nations , &quot; said Andrei V . Kortunov , a researcher at Moscow ' s U.S.A. and Canada Institute and an informal adviser to the Yeltsin government . &quot; They are suspicious. &quot; The NATO plan tries to avoid East-West polarization by allowing any country to join and offering no hard and fast promise of NATO rescue in case of attack . To join the partnership , countries would have to demonstrate a commitment to democracy and the peaceful resolution of disputes , along with civilian control of the military . But some of Yeltsin ' s advisers were raised to view NATO as &quot; a sinister plot of Western imperialism &quot; and &quot; somewhere in their souls , they still have this image , &quot; Kortunov said . Lithuania , a nation of 3.7 million that was occupied by the Soviet_Union for nearly five decades , formally requested NATO membership on Tuesday . The other Baltic nations , Estonia and Latvia , have also said they will eventually ask_for membership . Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic are also pushing for admission , while Slovakia wants NATO security guarantees .</TEXT>
