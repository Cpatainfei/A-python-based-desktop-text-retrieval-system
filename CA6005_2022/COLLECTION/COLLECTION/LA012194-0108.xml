   <HEADLINE> GOP LAWYER PICKED TO PROBE WHITEWATER ; PRESIDENCY : EX-N.Y. PROSECUTOR FISKE IS CHOSEN AS SPECIAL COUNSEL BY RENO . HE SAYS HE PLANS TO QUESTION THE CLINTONS ABOUT TANGLED S &amp; L AFFAIR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fulfilling a White_House promise made in response to GOP demands , Atty . Gen . Janet Reno on Thursday appointed former U.S. Atty . Robert B . Fiske Jr. , a Republican , as special counsel to look_into the tangled Whitewater affair . Fiske immediately pledged &quot; a complete , thorough and impartial &quot; inquiry into the_matter , which involves investments by President Clinton and his wife , Hillary , in an Ozark Mountain resort and loans to the Clintons by a failed savings and loan . Fiske also indicated that he is likely to take the unprecedented step of taking sworn statements from a sitting President . Asked if he planned to question the Clintons , Fiske replied : &quot; I would certainly expect before this investigation is over , I would question both the President and the First_Lady , and it would be under oath. &quot; A President has never been put_under oath in an independent counsel investigation , although former President Ronald Reagan agreed to give a videotaped deposition in the trial of an Iran-Contra defendant . Clinton indicated later that he was willing to be questioned by Fiske . &quot; Whatever he wants to do . . . I didn ' t do anything wrong , &quot; Clinton said during an appearance on CNN ' s &quot; Larry King Live. &quot; The President also said that he is eager to have the issue settled . &quot; The main thing I want to do is to just have that turned_over to him so we can go_back to work , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; I just want to do my job. &quot; In announcing Fiske ' s appointment , Reno praised him for his reputation of &quot; fairness and impartiality &quot; and said that the ex-prosecutor from New York fulfilled her pledge last week to appoint someone &quot; ruggedly independent. &quot; The new appointee , with Reno standing at his side , said he would recruit additional &quot; experienced former prosecutors from across the country &quot; to take_over total control of the investigation from the Justice_Department . Investigators will look_into possible criminal wrongdoing in the cases of Whitewater Development Corp . and Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan . Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , who has led demands by his party for appointment of a special counsel , said he did not know Fiske personally but felt he was &quot; extremely well-qualified. &quot; Fiske , 63 , was appointed in 1976 as Manhattan ' s federal prosecutor during the Gerald R . Ford Administration and was known as a hard-driving , hands-on U.S. attorney who focused_on white-collar and organized crime prosecutions . He was so well regarded in law_enforcement circles that Democrat Jimmy_Carter kept him in place after assuming the presidency in 1977 . He has become a Wall_Street lawyer prominent in white-collar defense work since leaving government service in 1980 . He is a past president of the American College of Trial_Lawyers . Fiske told reporters Thursday that he demanded and received &quot; very broad authority &quot; from Reno as a condition of accepting the appointment . He said he would take a leave_of_absence Monday from his Manhattan law_firm and would open an office in Little_Rock , Ark. , where a federal grand_jury has been hearing witnesses in recent weeks . His first_steps will include obtaining a full briefing from Justice_Department investigators who have been working_on the Whitewater case , along with subpoenaed documents they have obtained . But he stressed that he would hire &quot; a totally new staff of lawyers . . . so that we may conduct a truly independent investigation. &quot; &quot; I should have people working for me who are not at_the_same_time reporting to the attorney_general , &quot; he explained . * Fiske will have assistance from a cadre of FBI_agents , as is customary for independent counsels . FBI Director Louis J . Freeh &quot; has assured me the FBI will be at my complete disposal , &quot; he said . He said the suicide last July of deputy White_House counsel Vincent Foster &quot; would be one of the things &quot; encompassed by his probe . Among papers found in Foster ' s office after his death was a file on the Clintons ' Whitewater investment . Central questions to be answered in the Whitewater affair include whether the Clintons , as half-owners of the land-development venture , were aware that their partner and longtime friend , James B . McDougal , may have been co-mingling funds from his savings and loan in the land business ' accounts . Also at_issue is whether Clinton ' s political influence as governor helped keep the high-rolling S &amp; L open longer than it otherwise would have been , increasing the cost to the federal_government of its eventual federal bailout . Bank_examiners say the cost to taxpayers was $ 47 million . Complicating the investigation is McDougal ' s notoriously sloppy record-keeping , officials said . Fiske said that he would complete his investigation &quot; as quickly as I can consistent with doing the job right. &quot; Asked if that might take several months , he said &quot; probably more_than months. &quot; Reno originally opposed demands from Congress that she appoint a special counsel , saying anyone she selected would be subject_to charges of not being truly independent . The government had had a mechanism in place under which a panel of federal judges would appoint such independent counsels , but Congress allowed the statute to lapse . * Reno capitulated , however , when Clinton , reacting to congressional and public pressure , asked her to make an appointment . She said Thursday that she had taken every precaution to guarantee Fiske ' s &quot; complete independence. &quot; &quot; I wanted him to define the scope of his investigation and his staff , &quot; Reno said . &quot; I wanted him to be as independent as possible . I don ' t expect him to report to me , I expect him to report to the American people . And I don ' t expect to monitor this investigation. &quot; Under Fiske ' s legal mandate , he has full authority to seek criminal indictments from a federal grand_jury without Justice_Department approval . At the end of his inquiry , he is required to make a full public report of his findings . As to calls_for a parallel congressional investigation of Whitewater , Fiske said , &quot; I ' m not concerned about that at this point. &quot; But he acknowledged that given the propensity of Congress to grant limited immunity from prosecution to important witnesses , &quot; history shows it is difficult to conduct criminal investigations at_the_same_time as congressional investigations. &quot; Fiske was a law partner and early adviser to Lawrence E . Walsh , the independent counsel who just completed a seven-year probe of the Iran-Contra scandal . Walsh found that congressional grants of immunity caused two convictions to be overturned . Fiske , however , said the two investigations are &quot; totally different. &quot; Dole , meeting reporters in Topeka , Kan. , greeted the appointment with cautious optimism . &quot; I don ' t know Robert Fiske , &quot; he said . &quot; But my reaction is to wait and see what happens . They ' ve chosen someone . that ' s what we asked them to do . &quot; As far as I know , people who know him think he is extremely well-qualified , is independent , &quot; Dole said . He added : &quot; He has some Republican leanings . . . but some of the conservative Republicans have not been happy with him. &quot; Dole was referring to opposition from conservatives when former Atty . Gen . Dick Thornburgh once proposed Fiske as his top deputy during the George_Bush Administration . Conservatives , including Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee , raised such strong objections that Fiske ' s appointment was dropped . Fiske had incurred their ire when he chaired the American Bar Assn. ' s committee that evaluated potential court nominees . Conservatives blamed him for the ABA ' s tepid endorsement of the 1987 Supreme Court nomination of Robert H . Bork , who ultimately was blocked by the Senate . * A graduate of Yale_University and the University of Michigan law_school , Fiske tried several important cases during his government career , obtaining the convictions of narcotics kingpin Leroy ( Nicky ) Barnes and Mafia-connected labor racketeers Anthony Scotto and Anthony Anastasio . In both public and private life , Fiske has been known for his passion for detail . Popular among former colleagues at the Justice_Department and in his Manhattan law_firm , he has a talent for breaking_down a case to its essence and then arguing persuasively in court , associates said . In recent years , Fiske was among defense_attorneys who represented legendary Washington lawyer and power_broker Clark M . Clifford in his successful battle against bank fraud charges in the BCCI banking scandal . Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R -- N.Y. ) , who knows Fiske personally , calls him &quot; one of the most honorable and most skilled lawyers anywhere. &quot; During his four years in public office , Fiske supervised the drafting of thousands of indictments and obtained convictions of at least one defendant in 95 % of his cases .
