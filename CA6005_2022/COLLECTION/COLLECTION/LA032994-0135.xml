   <HEADLINE> LITTLE EFFECT SEEN FROM JAPAN ' S MOVE ; TRADE : AUTO PARTS AND CONSTRUCTION FIRMS MAY BENEFIT FROM THE MARKET-OPENING MEASURES , ANALYSTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Automotive suppliers may sell more parts and heavy-construction firms may get a better crack at major projects , but in_general the new package of market-opening measures unveiled in Tokyo early today will have negligible impact on California firms and other U.S. companies seeking inroads into Japan , industry representatives and analysts said . Among the key elements of the still-ambiguous program is a government pledge to &quot; facilitate &quot; the local purchase of parts by Japanese auto plants overseas and the expansion of_imports of foreign autos and parts into Japan . In the government procurement sector , the plan calls_for establishment procedures to disseminate information on large-scale telecommunication projects and medical equipment purchases at least 90 days before public calls_for bids . Collusion and bid-rigging by Japanese firms privy to project specifications before public announcements have been among the main complaints of foreign construction firms seeking business there . But the government did not say what information would be made available early or whether it would liberalize the Byzantine system of qualifications for non-Japanese bidders . It also said it would wait until June before deciding whether , or by how much , to expand its public works budget . &quot; Everything depends_on what information they release 90 days before , &quot; said James McNulty , senior_vice_president of Ralph M . Parsons Co. , a Pasadena-based heavy-construction firm active in the Japanese market through a series of joint_ventures with Japanese building firms . &quot; It ' s one thing to know there ' s a project out there , but what about information about bidding criteria ? &quot; Before the government ' s announcement , Japanese auto_makers separately on Monday said they would set higher goals for purchases of U.S.-made parts . Toyota Motor Corp. , for example , said it plans to increase total purchases of U.S.-made parts to $ 6.45 billion in fiscal 1996 from $ 4.43 billion in fiscal 1992 . Mitsubishi Motors Corp . similarly said it would purchase about $ 2 billion worth of U.S. parts in fiscal 1996 . All of these figures , however , are plans , not promises , and are dependent_on stronger sales and improved competitiveness by U.S. suppliers . &quot; Overall , this would have a modest impact on this industry , &quot; said George Peterson , president of AutoPacific Group Inc. , a Santa Ana-based automotive marketing and consulting firm . The plan , he said , is &quot; more_than a token response &quot; to American government pressure to open_up the Japanese market but &quot; not an open-arms response considering the fact that U.S. parts are cheaper than Japanese parts. &quot; In general , Japan ' s proposals were greeted coolly by industry representatives who have long awaited a significant liberalization in Japanese trade practices . In Washington , the American Electronics Assn. , a key high-tech industry trade group , criticized Japan for not proposing specific actions to boost imports of U.S. equipment . The industry has complained that the Japanese government ' s procurement practices exclude outsiders , particularly those selling telecommunications gear and medical equipment . However , spokeswoman Debra Waggoner noted that the &quot; rhetoric coming_out of Japan the last two weeks has really lowered everyone ' s expectations. &quot; &quot; Patience is running_out among the American medical manufacturers who are intensely interested in seeing results , &quot; said David Anast , publisher of the Biomedical Market Newsletter in Costa Mesa . Others said that the lack of quantifiable import goals in today ' s package typified Japan ' s practice of making vague and unenforceable promises . &quot; The 20-year history of U.S.-Japan trade relations is marked by promises unkept with no numerical guideposts , &quot; said Michael C . Maibach , a Washington lobbyist for semiconductor giant Intel Corp . Still , some industrialists said they saw some reason for optimism in the government program . &quot; It ' s a positive step , &quot; said McNulty of the Parsons Corp .
