   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S HOSOKAWA GIVES_UP PLANS TO FORM NEW CABINET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After two weeks of futile efforts to win approval from his coalition partners , Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced late Wednesday that he is abandoning plans to form a new Cabinet to carry_out economic reforms . In his third late-night news_conference in three months , Hosokawa said he will retain his existing Cabinet , at least until Japan ' s fiscal 1994 budget is enacted , to maintain unity of the seven lower house and eight upper house_parties supporting him . The new blow to his leadership nonetheless displayed what appears to be an irreparable split between the right and left wings of his coalition , which embraces a political spectrum ranging from Liberal Democratic Party defectors to Marxist-imbued Socialists . It also forces him to retain as a chief aide and coordinator of the Cabinet a leader who has openly questioned his decisions . The flap created a two-week hiatus in Japan ' s efforts to resolve trade frictions with the United States . After failing to reach agreement on a framework for economic relations in a meeting with President Clinton on Feb . 11 , Hosokawa promised to act &quot; urgently &quot; to come_up with a new Japanese proposal . But now a deadline has been set for the end of March . In a nationally televised news_conference that began after 11 p.m. , Hosokawa said he had wanted to form a new Cabinet to focus_on economic reforms and U.S.-Japan economic relations . The mission of enacting political reforms , the Cabinet ' s initial goal when Hosokawa took_over last August , has largely been accomplished , he added . But he could not win approval from the left-leaning wing of his coalition , Hosokawa said . Constitutionally , the prime_minister is empowered to act alone in appointing and dismissing cabinets or ministers . &quot; The coalition is built_upon a delicate balance . A zigzag course is unavoidable , &quot; Hosokawa admitted . It was the second time in two months that the prime_minister was forced to bow to his coalition ' s left wing . In January , Socialist rebels defeated Hosokawa ' s political reform bills in the upper house , forcing him to accept a compromise with the opposition Liberal Democrats . And in February , when Hosokawa announced his intention to raise a controversial consumption tax to finance income_tax cuts -- also in a middle-of-the-night news_conference -- the Socialists threatened to bolt the coalition . A day later , Hosokawa withdrew his decision . Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura , who sided with the Socialists against Hosokawa ' s tax proposal , refused to resign or accept another Cabinet post . Socialists and the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist_Party supported Takemura and warned that any Cabinet shuffle would split the coalition . Takemura condemned as &quot; imperialistic &quot; a Hosokawa proposal to amalgamate the coalition parties into a single parliamentary negotiating group to deal with the opposition . The prime_minister said he had scolded Takemura but had received assurances of future cooperation from the leader of the New Party Harbinger .</TEXT>
