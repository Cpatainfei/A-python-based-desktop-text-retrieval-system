   <HEADLINE> CULTURAL CENTER BECOMES A SYMBOL OF POLITICAL DEBATE ; ASIA : SOME SEE $ 3-MILLION FACILITY IN EL MONTE AS A HAVEN FOR OVERSEAS CHINESE . BUT PRO-INDEPENDENCE TAIWANESE LOYALISTS SEE IT AS AN INSULT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What ' s in a name ? Plenty when it comes_to the Chinese Cultural Center in El Monte . Many say the $ 3-million facility built by the Taiwanese government is a haven where overseas Chinese can rekindle ties with their historic culture . But others , who believe Taiwan should be independent of China , see the center as a slap in the face . They want it renamed the Taiwanese Cultural Center to reflect who funded the facility , with its 900-seat theater , classrooms and a library . They also accuse center officials of discriminating against them because of their political views . As evidence , they claim that center officials have not made rooms available when they call to schedule meetings . &quot; They intentionally discourage ( pro-independence ) Taiwanese Americans from using the center ; a lot of us don ' t want to do any activities under that flag , &quot; said Jack Liu of Palos Verdes , president of the Collegiate Alumni Assn . of Taiwan , referring to the Taiwanese flag that adorns the center ' s lobby . To draw attention to their concerns , Liu and other pro-independence Taiwanese Americans_planned a press_conference today at a San Gabriel restaurant . Some said they will boycott the center until the name is changed . Daniel Liao , director of the center , denied Liu ' s claim and said the center welcomes all overseas Chinese organizations . He said thousands of Chinese Americans use the center each week to take_out books , hold conferences or learn calligraphy . &quot; We ' re willing to serve people , welcome people , regardless of their political associations , Liao said . &quot; I have no grudge with them . I respect their opinions . But there is a current reality existing . What will happen in the future we can ' t tell. &quot; The debate offers a rare public peek at the complex political crosscurrents battering Taiwan today that have blown across the Pacific to pit many of the 500 # 000 to 600 # 000 overseas Chinese in Southern California against each other . On one side stand pro-independence Taiwanese Americans such_as Liu who think that Taiwan ' s 21 million people should forget about negotiating a reunification with the People ' s Republic_of_China and declare themselves a free and separate nation . On the other side are Taiwanese Americans such_as Marina Tse , president of the Chinese American Educator ' s Assn . Tse , whose father was a senator in Taiwan , supports the government , which seeks an eventual reunification with mainland_China under a non-communist government . &quot; It ' s a very sensitive issue , &quot; Tse said . But , referring to those favoring a free and separate Taiwan , she said : &quot; Their ancestors moved from mainland_China , so when they claim they ' re not Chinese and they want to be independent , I don ' t feel they ' re justified. &quot; Caught in the middle are people such_as Louis Kuan of Alhambra , who is president of the Chinese Americans Voter Education Foundation . Kuan ' s parents were born in mainland_China . He was born in Taiwan . He sees himself as both Taiwanese and Chinese , comparing it to being an American and a Texan . &quot; I feel perplexed and very ambivalent ; it ' s a touchy situation , &quot; he said . &quot; But whatever happens to the destiny of Taiwan , it should be in the voters ' hands . It ' s not up_to us in America or overseas to determine what they should be called. &quot; Kuan said the center provides a valuable service by giving people of Chinese origin in the San Gabriel Valley a place to meet and sponsor events , functioning as an unofficial town square . Bao-Tyan Wang , a professor in clinical sciences at Cal State Dominguez Hills , used the facility last month to hold a symposium on high-tech products . Wang said the debate has not affected his willingness to use the center because his interests lie more in academia than politics . But Liu claims that when his group held a conference there last year , the lights and the air conditioning went_out suddenly , leading him to suspect that the center was trying to sabotage him , a charge that center officials deny . The 26 # 500-square-foot center , located in an industrial_park , opened in December , 1992 , and is one of two run_by the Coordination Council for North_American Affairs , Taiwan ' s unofficial consulate in the United States . There is a second center in Chinatown . Taiwan calls itself the Republic_of_China . Mainland China , under its communist government , is the People ' s Republic_of_China . The feud between the two dates_back 50 years , to when Mao Tse Tung ' s communists fought Chiang Kai-shek ' s Kuomintang party for control of the mainland . By 1949 , Mao had won and the Kuomintang fled to Taiwan , where they established a government in exile with the aim of eventually returning to the mainland once communism had been vanquished . They are still waiting . Despite the political differences , strong ties remain between the two nations separated by just 90 miles of water . More_than 1.5 million Taiwanese visited mainland_China last year and spent $ 600 million . Taiwan is China ' s biggest investor , with $ 11 billion in joint_ventures . Although some Taiwanese Americans here have entrenched themselves in the conflict , others believe the debate is being blown_out of proportion . &quot; A lot of people here are too busy for politics , &quot; Tse said . &quot; They ' re just struggling to survive. &quot;</TEXT>
