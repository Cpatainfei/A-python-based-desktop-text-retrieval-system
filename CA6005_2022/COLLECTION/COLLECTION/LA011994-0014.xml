   <HEADLINE> GIRLS ' SCHOOLS ARE BEST FOR GIRLS ; CO-ED SETTINGS NOT ONLY BRING MISSED OPPORTUNITY , BUT ALSO DROPPING_OUT AND EARLY PREGNANCY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is a growing national pattern of female academic failure and underachievement in this country that is directly tied to the way we educate girls and young_women and that has consequences that resonate throughout our society . The recent decision by three California coeducational schools to institute all-girl mathematics classes again raises the issue of the appropriateness of single-sex education , especially in public_schools . Despite such criticism , it remains the best way to counter an increasingly serious trend of poorer gains by girls and young_women in co-ed classrooms . Beginning with the examination of worldwide education for girls commissioned to mark Mount Holyoke College ' s Sesquicentennial in 1987 , study after study has found that girls are overlooked and undervalued in most coeducational classes , especially in math and science . David and Myra Sadker ' s &quot; Failing at Fairness : How America ' s Schools Cheat Girls &quot; -- a 20-year study of education at all levels due_to be released next month -- found that students who have survived this treatment in middle and high_school experience a continuing erosion of self-confidence in many colleges and universities . There is no doubt that girls show_up on their first day of grammar_school just as ready , willing_and_able to succeed as do boys . But as the Sadkers will show in their survey of classroom settings across the country , teachers call_on boys more frequently , spend more time with them and encourage their initiative and inquisitiveness more_than they do girls . By grade six , girls have become more tentative , far less likely to call_out answers and more reluctant to take_part in class demonstrations . Once children enter middle_school , the situation worsens . Girls who have previously held the edge_in subjects , including mathematics , begin to lose points in every category of national tests . This decline , most precipitous in math , continues throughout high_school , so that by the time juniors take national Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Tests , boys outscore girls by an average 50 points . While 18 # 000 boys typically reach the highest PSAT categories , only 8 # 000 girls do . Crucially , the Sadker study will document a &quot; self-esteem slide &quot; for girls that takes_hold most strongly in the middle-school years . Tests show that girls fall approximately 10 points behind boys in confidence in their academic abilities during grammar_school . During the three years of middle_school , that confidence drops another 16 points . By high_school graduation , only 29 % of girls tested think they can do their work . This erosion cannot be tied entirely to the difference in attention by teachers . It is also closely tied to the growing pervasiveness of sexual_harassment in high_schools and middle_schools . This problem has grown to such proportions that conversations with 150 high_school and middle-school students in California last year revealed nearly all had seen , experienced or participated in some form of sexual_harassment . Our schools are becoming threatening places in which girls seek to avoid calling attention to themselves and move to the rear of the class . This movement , especially in math and the sciences , is reinforced by stereotyping among teachers . Thus , the number of male college graduates gravitating toward fields dominated by math and science far eclipses the number of females , although the percentages of women ' s college graduates pursuing these fields is markedly higher than graduates of co-ed institutions . In 1979 , Mount Holyoke College started an intensive summer mathematics program for 15-year-old girls and their teachers that has become a national model . SummerMath gives girls the opportunity to conceptualize problems , translate life situations into numerical formulas and visualize changing relationships of numbers . In nearby Holyoke , one of the least affluent cities in Massachusetts , the college joined the city in 1988 in instituting a successful magnet school that pays special attention to the learning needs of the girls . The results have been astonishing . The program has bolstered success for all : Academic performance has skyrocketed , attendance has improved and pregnancies are few . The problem of subtle but still unequal education for women has more serious consequences than the disproportionately small number of women scientists , mathematicians , researchers and engineers . The Mount Holyoke College study showed that the only single , universal predictor of early pregnancy was truncation of education . I will be the first to call_for coeducation at Mount Holyoke , the country ' s oldest_women ' s college , when single-sex education becomes obsolete . We are a long way from that . Single-sex education for girls is a proven method for ensuring that they reach their fullest potential . Let those who want to abandon it propose more effective ways to educate young_women .</TEXT>
