   <HEADLINE> THE HILLBILLY CAT ; ELVIS PRESLEY ON THE BRINK OF STARDOM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Elvis Presley ' s first record ( &quot; that ' s All Right &quot; and &quot; Blue_Moon of Kentucky &quot; ) was recorded on July 5 , 1954 . It was released on the Sun label two weeks later . Elvis was 19 years old . He had never appeared anywhere professionally . In fact , he had only met the two members of his band , guitarist Scotty Moore and bass player Bill Black , the day before the initial session . On July 30 , Elvis made what amounted to his official debut on a country_and_western jamboree , headlined by Slim Whitman , at Memphis ' Overton Park shell . Even in the midst of a seasoned professional cast and despite a pronounced case of stage_fright , he was an immediate sensation . Over the next few weeks , his record proved to be a big hit in Memphis , and he made a number of club appearances . But Sun Records president Sam Phillips had bigger plans . Phillips , who had pioneered in the recording of blues men like B.B. King , Howlin ' Wolf , Ike Turner and Little Junior Parker over the previous four years , saw an opportunity for Presley to make a national mark . To that end , Phillips approached Grand Ole Opry head Jim Denny , who was less than enthusiastic but agreed to think_about it . * IT WAS A 200-MILE RIDE FROM MEMPHIS TO NASHVILLE , BUT THE FOUR OF THEM WERE COMFORTABLE enough in Sam Phillips ' four-door black 1951 Cadillac , with Bill ' s bass strapped to the roof . It was Saturday , Oct . 2 . Elvis , Scotty and Bill had played their regular Friday-night gig at the Eagle ' s Nest ; their record , &quot; Blue_Moon of Kentucky , &quot; was near the top of the charts in Memphis and just beginning to break_in Nashville and New Orleans , and they had every reason to feel that they had reached the pinnacle of their musical career -- because tonight they were going_to play the Opry . Jim Denny had finally succumbed to Sam ' s argument that there was no need to think_about putting the boy on as a regular , he didn ' t have to think_of this as a normal &quot; tryout , &quot; just give the boy a chance . Denny , who had become manager of the Opry in 1947 , seemed no more convinced than he had been in the first place -- perhaps he was just worn down by Sam ' s persistence -- but he agreed to give the young_man a one-time spot on Hank Snow ' s segment of the show . He could perform a single song with his band , the country number &quot; Blue_Moon of Kentucky. &quot; If it was worth it to Sam and the boys to drive over just for that , well , then , Denny was willing to give them the shot . In the meantime , Sam had also heard from the Louisiana Hayride , the Opry ' s innovative rival in Shreveport , which actually wanted this new act . The Hayride , which Denny referred to derisively as the Opry ' s farm_club because so many of its big acts eventually defected to Nashville , had discovered Hank Williams in 1948 and broken such stars as Slim Whitman , Webb Pierce , and , most recently , Jim Reeves and Faron Young . But Sam put them off because , he explained to Hayride booking_agent Pappy Covington , he wanted to play the Opry first . As soon as the boys had fulfilled this prior commitment , he told Pappy , stretching the truth a little , Elvis could appear on the Hayride . There was no doubt in his mind , he said , that Elvis could make a hit with the Hayride audience , and they could set it up for just a week or two after the Opry appearance , but he had committed himself to Jim Denny . Sam was walking a thin line , he knew . He didn ' t for a minute want to lose the Hayride , but he wasn ' t going_to give_up the opportunity to see a new , untried artist get his national debut on the hallowed Grand Ole Opry . Ryman Auditorium was like a tattered shrine to the three musicians , none of whom had ever even attended a show at the Opry before . They wandered around the dilapidated building , erected as a tabernacle in 1886 and still retaining the old wooden pews for seats , in something of a daze . They were both overwhelmed at the sense of history contained in the room -- the music they had been listening to all their lives emanated from this cramped little stage -- and somewhat disillusioned , too , that the Grand Ole Opry was not , well , grander . Backstage , the other musicians mingled freely , exchanging small_talk and greetings , tuning_up , donning makeup and costumes , without any of the formality or protocol you might have expected from stars but with all_of the remoteness , whether real or perceived , of big leaguers sniffing at bushers just up from the minors . Twenty-one-year-old bass player Buddy Killen came_up_to the obviously out-of-place young singer and introduced himself . &quot; ( Elvis ) said , ' They ' re going to hate me. ' I said , ' They ' re not going_to hate you . You ' re going to be fine. ' He said , ' If they ' d just let me leave , I ' d go right now. ' &quot; Marty Robbins saw evidence of the same insecurity , but when Elvis spotted Chet Atkins backstage , he introduced himself and then , knowing Scotty ' s admiration for Atkins ' guitar playing , pulled Scotty over , too , saying , &quot; My guitar_player wants to meet you. &quot; Atkins noted with asperity that the kid appeared to be wearing eye makeup . Probably of all_the Opry legends , the one they were most leery of running_into was Bill Monroe . Many in the country field continued to view the Sun version of &quot; Blue_Moon of Kentucky &quot; as a desecration , and even Sam had heard that Monroe was going_to take their head_off for their untrammeled interpretation of his stately lament . But when they met Monroe , conservatively dressed in dark suit and tie and trademark white hat and at 43 already an elder_statesman possessed of a dignity that permitted neither insincerity nor informality , he came right out and complimented them . As a matter_of_fact , he told them , he had cut a new version of the song for Decca , due out next week , that followed their pattern . There were two additional surprises . Sam Phillips ' assistant , Marion Keisker , left_behind in Memphis to keep the studio doors open , abandoned her post and caught a bus to Nashville , where she thought at first she would just stay out_in the audience so as not to spook them but before long found her way backstage . Then Bill peeked out at the audience and , to his surprise , discovered his wife , Evelyn , and Scotty ' s wife , Bobbie , in the front row . &quot; I think he was kind of glad to see us , &quot; said Bobbie , &quot; ' cause they were wanting to come_back to Memphis that night . But when Scotty saw me backstage , it was like he ' d seen a ghost. &quot; At 10:15 Grant Turner announced the Hank Snow segment of the show , sponsored by Royal Crown Cola , and Snow got lost in his introduction of a young_man from Memphis who has just made a hit record , let ' s give him a nice round of applause , to_the_point that he forgot the young singer ' s name . Elvis bounced_out the same way that he always did , as if he had just fallen_off a fast-moving train , and did his one number . Scotty and Bill were more nervous than he was ; to them , it seemed , there was nowhere to go but down from here , and they could sense from the polite , but tepid , reception that this was exactly where they were going . Afterward they were like a boxing management team trying to rationalize defeat . Everyone was nice to them as they gawked and huddled ; they ' d gotten a good reception , Bobbie and Evelyn insisted , and Bill introduced himself to everyone , laughing and cracking jokes , while Scotty stood off to one side a little stiffly , waiting to be introduced . Before leaving , Sam conferred briefly with Mr. Denny , who confirmed that Elvis Presley just did not fit the Opry mold , but , he told Sam , &quot; ' This boy is not bad. ' He didn ' t give me any great accolades , he just grabbed me by my skinny arm and said , ' This boy is not bad. ' Well , people put_down Jim Denny , nobody much liked Jim , he was a damn tough man , but he did me a favor . &quot; They left not long afterward and wandered down the_hill to 417 Broadway , the location of the Ernest Tubb Record Shop , where they were scheduled to play the famous Midnight Jamboree ( which went_on the air live from the record store at the conclusion of the Opry broadcast ) . Someone introduced Elvis to Ernest Tubb , and Tubb , the most gracious and courteous of entertainers , listened patiently as the 19-year-old poured_out his love for Tubb ' s music and told him that it was his real ambition to sing country_music . &quot; He said , ' They tell me if I ' m going_to make any money , though , I ' ve got_to sing ( this other kind of music ) . What should I do ? ' I said , ' Elvis , you ever have any money ? ' He said , ' No , sir. ' I said , ' Well , you just go_ahead and do what they tell you to do . Make your money . Then you can do what you want to do. ' &quot; Scotty and Bill headed back to Memphis with their wives after the broadcast . They felt simultaneously elated and depressed ( they had made_it to the big_time , even if they were now in all likelihood on_the_road to oblivion ) , but for Sam Phillips the evening was an unmitigated triumph . To play the Opry -- and then to get approval , however grudging , from Jim Denny and Bill Monroe ! Even the criticism would not hurt . It could be used , Sam was firmly convinced , to further the boy ' s appeal -- if he could just turn_around some of this damn rejection he was getting , if he could just straighten_out some of the wrongheaded thinking he was encountering , the blind could be made to see , the lame could be made to walk . &quot; I needed the attention that I got from the people that hated what I was doing , that acted like : ' Here is somebody trying to thrust junk on us and classify it as our music. ' Well , f- - - them , let them do the classifying . I just had to peak that damn pyramid , or else the damn son_of_a_bitch would have fallen down. &quot; And with Elvis Presley , Sam Phillips was sure he had the means to peak the pyramid . ELVIS PRESLEY ' S SECOND SUN SINGLE WAS RELEASED SIX DAYS BEFORE his Opry appearance . It was , if anything , an even bolder declaration of intent than &quot; that ' s All Right , &quot; especially the strident blues number &quot; Good Rockin ' Tonight , &quot; which rocked more confidently than anything they could have imagined in those first , uncertain days in the studio . Maybe Sam still couldn ' t diagram the path , but , he felt , they were finally beginning to find their way to &quot; that damn row that hadn ' t been plowed. &quot; They had seized every opportunity they could to get_into the studio all through August , but Sam was_on the road so_much , and the band was working so many weekends ( while still holding_down full-time jobs ) , that this was easier said than accomplished . On Aug . 19 they spent hours doing take_after take of &quot; Blue_Moon , &quot; in an eerie , clippity-clop version that resembled a cross between Slim Whitman ' s &quot; Indian Love Call &quot; and some of the falsetto flights of the rhythm-and-blues &quot; bird &quot; groups ( the Orioles , the Ravens , the Larks ) . After it was all_over , Sam wasn ' t satisfied that they had anything worth releasing , but he never uttered a word of demurral for fear of discouraging the unfettered freshness and enthusiasm of the singer . &quot; The sessions would go_on and on , &quot; said Marion Keisker . &quot; Each record was sweated out . Sam showed patience beyond belief -- in a personality that ' s not really given to patience. &quot; The problem did not appear to have so_much to do with time , in any case , as with confidence and direction . They had captured the ring once , seemingly by accident , but now no one appeared to have a clear vision of how to capture it again , and Sam was reluctant to impose his own . &quot; I had a mental_picture , as sure as God is_on His throne , I had a mental_picture of what I wanted to hear , certainly not note for note , but I knew the essence of what we were trying to do . But I also knew that the worst thing I could do was to be impatient , to try to force the issue -- sometimes you can make a suggestion just ( to change ) one bar and you kill the whole song . And sometimes you can be too cocky around people who are insecure and just intimidate them . I mean , as far as actually saying , ' Hey , man , don ' t be scared , ' I ' ve never told anybody in my life not to be scared of the microphone -- don ' t go calling attention to the thing you know they are already scared of . I was never a real forward person , because I didn ' t give_a_damn about jumping_out in front to be seen , but I tried to envelop them in my feelings of security. &quot; Over the course of the next few weeks they made several attempts at &quot; Satisfied , &quot; Martha Carson ' s rousing spiritual hit from 1951 , and &quot; Tomorrow Night , &quot; the Lonnie Johnson blues ballad that Elvis had crooned so often to his girlfriend Dixie . They made any number of false starts on other tunes , all_of them erased because tape was expensive , after all , and they just weren ' t going anywhere . The slow numbers , Sam said , &quot; would hang you out_to dry , &quot; but he was determined to give Elvis ' creative imagination free play . He was equally determined , said Marion , not to release anything even a jot below the standard they had already set ; he wanted to be sure he had done all that he could to make every record as_good_as it was &quot; humanly possible to make it. &quot; From Sam ' s point_of_view : &quot; I wanted simplicity , where we could look_at what we were hearing mentally and say , ' Man , this guy has just got it. ' But I wanted some biting bulls- - - , too . Everything had to be a stinger . To me every one of those sessions was like I was filming ' Gone With the Wind. ' &quot; Finally , starting on Sept . 10 , they hit a streak -- once again it seemed almost as if they had stumbled onto it by accident , but when they did , it was , as Sam Phillips said , as if it had been waiting for them all along . They cut &quot; Just Because , &quot; a rollicking , honky-tonk blues that the Shelton Brothers had originally recorded as the Lone Star Cowboys in 1933 . The great good_humor and burbling effervescence of the new trio version can be traced in equal parts to Elvis ' confident exploitation of his gospel-learned technique ( here for the first time we hear the characteristic Presley drop to a slurred lower register ) , Bill Black ' s almost comically thumping bass and Scotty ' s increasingly rhythm-driven guitar . &quot; It was almost a total rhythm thing , &quot; Scotty said . &quot; With only the three of us , we had to make every note count. &quot; Although Sam never released this cut or the next one either , a weepy version of Jimmy Wakely ' s 1941 &quot; I ' ll Never Let You Go ( Little Darlin ' ) &quot; with a tagged-on , double-time ending , both are characterized by the kind of playfulness and adventurousness of spirit that Sam was looking_for , the fresh , almost &quot; impudent &quot; attitude that he was seeking to unlock . With &quot; I Don ' t Care If the Sun Don ' t Shine , &quot; an even more unlikely transformation took_place . Originally written for the Disney animated feature &quot; Cinderella &quot; by Mack David ( brother of the celebrated pop composer Hal David ) , the song didn ' t make the film score ' s final cut , but it was popularized in 1950 by both Patti Page and Dean Martin . The rhythmic approach couldn ' t have been more different , but it was Martin ' s version on which Elvis ' is clearly based ; for all_the energy that Elvis , Scotty and Bill impart to the song , and for all_the high spirits of Elvis ' vocalizing , it is Martin ' s lazily insouciant spirit that comes_through . It ' s as if Dennis the Menace met the drawling English character_actor George Sanders . &quot; that ' s what he heard in Dean , &quot; said Sam , &quot; that little bit of mischievousness that he had in his soul when he cut_up a little bit -- ( that ' s why ) he loved Dean Martin ' s singing. &quot; With the last song of the session , Wynonie Harris ' R &amp; B classic &quot; Good Rockin ' Tonight , &quot; everything finally fell_into_place . By this time , everyone may have been getting a little testy , and no one was really sure whether they had anything , but as Scotty said , &quot; Sam had an uncanny knack for pulling stuff out of you . Once you got a direction , he ' d work you so hard you ' d work your butt off , he ' d make you so mad you ' d want to kill him , but he would n ' t let_go until he got that little something extra sometimes you didn ' t even know you had. &quot; Sam would insist that they play nothing but rhythm , he would have them change keys just when they finally got used to the one they were in , and he called_for tempos so slow sometimes that everyone was ready to scream . &quot; A lot of times it was a tempo that I absolutely knew they weren ' t going_to like , but we were in a situation where we just weren ' t getting anywhere , and when they came_back ( to the original tempo ) , it was like they ' d hit a home run. &quot; To Marion Keisker it was like a puzzle to which only Sam had the key . &quot; I still remember the times when everyone would be so tired , and then some little funny thing would set us off -- I ' d see Elvis literally rolling_around on the floor , and Bill Black just stretched_out with his old broken-down bass_fiddle , just laughing and goofing off . It was a great spirit of -- I don ' t know , everyone was trying very hard , but everyone was trying to hang very loose through the whole_thing . ( Sometimes ) if Elvis would do something absolutely extraordinary and somebody would hit a clinker or something would go_wrong before the tape was completed , Sam would say , ' Well , let ' s go_back , and you hold_on to what you did there . I want that. ' And Elvis would say , ' What did I do ? What did I do ? ' Because it was all so instinctive that he simply didn ' t know. &quot; Sam ' s one organizing principle was that it had to be fun . &quot; I could tolerate anything , we could have tensions as long as I knew that we all had confidence in what we were trying to do , and I could get everybody relaxed to_the_point where they could hear and react to something without that threshold of apprehension where you almost get_to a point where you can ' t do anything right . Every time we did a number , I wanted to make_sure . . . that everybody enjoyed it. &quot; In the case of this final number , that sense of enjoyment comes_through from the very first note , as Elvis ' voice takes_on a burr of aggression that is missing from the previous recordings , the band for the first time becomes the fused rhythm instrument that Sam had been seeking all along , and there is a sense of driving , high-flying good times almost in defiance of societal norms . &quot; Have you heard the news ? &quot; is the opening declaration , drawn_out and dramatic . &quot; There ' s good rocking tonight. &quot; The other dramatic element to declare itself was the quality that Sam thought he had sensed in Elvis from the start , that strange , unexpected impulse that had led the boy to launch himself into &quot; that ' s All Right &quot; in the first place -- it seemed to come_out of nowhere , and yet , Sam felt , he heard something of the same feeling in the sentimental ballads , too . He equated the insecurity that came_through so unmistakably in the boy ' s stance and demeanor with the sense of inferiority -- social , psychological , perceptual -- that was projected by the great Negro talents he had sought_out and recorded . Sam couldn ' t be sure , he thought he sensed in Elvis a kindred spirit , someone who shared with him a secret , almost subversive attraction not just to black music but to black culture , to an inchoate striving , a belief in the equality of man . This was something that Sam felt could never be articulated ; each man was doomed to stumble in his own darkness , if only because the stakes were so high . &quot; I had to keep my nose clean . They could have said , ' This goddamn rebel down here is gonna turn his back on us . Why should we give this nigger-loving son_of_a_bitch a break ? ' It took some subtle thinking on my part -- I ' m telling you ( some ) resolute facts here . But I had the ability to be patient . I was able to hold_on almost with a religious fervor , but definitely subdued -- I wasn ' t looking_for no tall stumps to preach from . And I sensed in him the same kind of empathy . I don ' t think he was aware of my motivation for doing what I was trying to do -- not consciously anyway -- but intuitively he felt it . I never discussed it -- I don ' t think it would have been very wise_to talk_about it , for me to say , ' Hey , man , we ' re going against . . . ' Or , ' We ' re trying to put pop_music down and bring_in black . . . ' The lack of prejudice on the part of Elvis had to be one of the biggest things that ever could have happened to us , though . It was almost subversive , sneaking around through the music -- but we hit things a little bit , don ' t you think ? I went_out into this no-man ' s land , and I knocked the s- - - out of the color line. &quot; Sam knew that he had found a kindred spirit in other ways as well . Over the course of the next month , as he worked_at trying to set_up the Opry appearance , as he took around an acetate of the new single and encountered the same resistance in Nashville from old friends like WLAC deejay Gene Nobles and one-stop record distributors Randy Wood and Ernie Young , all strictly rhythm-and-blues men , he nevertheless knew that his instincts had not been wrong . Getting_to know the boy a little better , getting him to open_up a little more , having the chance to talk to him not just about music but about life and love and women , he sensed a potential that even he had not fully anticipated . &quot; I was amazed . Here I am 12 years older than him , I ' m 31 and he ' s 19 , and I ' ve been exposed to all kinds of music and lived through the damn Depression , and yet he had the most intuitive ability to hear songs without ever having to classify them , or himself , of anyone I ' ve ever known outside of Jerry Lee Lewis and myself . It seemed like he had a photographic memory for every damn song he ever heard -- and he was one of the most introspective human_beings that I ' ve ever met . You see , Elvis Presley knew what it was like to be poor , but that damn sure didn ' t make him prejudiced . He didn ' t draw any lines . And like ( Billboard editor ) Paul Ackerman said , you have to be an awful smart person or dumb as hell ( and you know he wasn ' t dumb ) to put_out that kind of thinking. &quot; SAM CALLED PAPPY COVINGTON , THE TALENT BOOKER for The Hayride , on the Monday after the Opry appearance and settled_on a date less than two weeks away . The Hayride was a little more_than 6 years old . It had been predated by a similar program , the KWKH Saturday Night Roundup , before the war and was probably the second-most popular hillbilly program on the air , with a 50 # 000-watt clear-channel signal that rivaled the Opry ' s , reaching up_to 28 states , and a CBS hookup that enabled it to reach 198 stations for an hour on the third Saturday of every month . The hallmark of the Hayride was innovation , and it was as the Opry ' s brash younger cousin that the Hayride really made its mark . Hank Williams , Kitty Wells , Webb Pierce , Faron Young , the Carlisles , David Houston , Jim Reeves -- all debuted on the Hayride before eventually lighting out for Nashville , and under the leadership of Horace Logan , it continued to be a haven for new talent and fast-paced variety . The Hayride audiences in the 3 # 800-seat Municipal Auditorium showed the same kind of enthusiasm as the performers , and Logan placed microphones out among the crowd to register its reaction , whether to something that was going_out over the air or to longtime announcer Ray Bartlett ( who broadcast during the day as rhythm-and-blues deejay Groovey Boy ) doing unrestrained somersaults and back flips onstage . Shreveport was a lively music town , just on the cusp of oil affluence and with the kind of unassuming racial mix ( nothing like desegregation , of course , but with two populations living cheek by jowl , locked_in an inescapable cultural alliance ) that gave Memphis its own musical flavor . The Hayride had everything , in fact , except an aggressive booking agency to support its acts ( Pappy Covington had the job only because he had a lease on the building ) and record companies to sign them . This was the principal reason for the one-way migration to Nashville , but in the fall of 1954 it looked as if the supply of new talent might be inexhaustible , and the Hayride had grown accustomed to thumbing its nose at the Opry , which Horace Logan referred to frequently on the air as &quot; the Tennessee branch of the Hayride. &quot; Sam , Elvis , Scotty and Bill set_out for Shreveport , a good seven- or eight-hour ride from Memphis , not long after the boys got_off work_at their regular Friday-night gig at the Eagle ' s Nest . They missed the turnoff at Greenville , Miss. , because Bill had everybody laughing so hard at one of his jokes , and then Scotty almost hit a team of mules as they struggled to make_up the time . When they finally got_to Shreveport , they checked_into the Captain Shreve Hotel downtown , but then they had to wait forever while Elvis combed his hair . Sam took the boys around to meet Pappy , who made them feel &quot; like four_hundred million dollars , just this kindly , fatherly old_man who made you feel_like you were the greatest thing that could ever walk into his office . I thought that was the best thing that could happen for these young_men and even myself. &quot; From there , he and Elvis went and paid their respects_to disc_jockey T . Tommy Cutrer , who had broken &quot; that ' s All Right &quot; on KCIJ . Elvis was wearing a typical black and pink outfit and , according to T . Tommy , &quot; his hair was long and greasy and he didn ' t look clean . My wife commented afterwards ; she said , ' That boy needs to wash his neck. ' &quot; T . Tommy , a highly astute , charming and capable man who kept_up a little band of_his_own at the time and went_on to become a Tennessee state_senator and a top Teamsters official , still had doubts about how far this boy was going_to go , and Elvis scarcely opened his mouth the whole time . But Sam was such a believer , and T . Tommy was nothing if not a pragmatist , so he figured , Well , let ' s just see where it goes . From there Sam made the rest of his rounds . He stopped by Stan ' s Record Shop_at 728 Texas St. , just around the corner from the auditorium , where they chatted with Stan Lewis , a prematurely white-haired 27-year-old veteran of the music business who had started_out supplying five jukeboxes from the back of his parents ' Italian grocery_store . Stan had known Sam Phillips ever since Sam first went_into the business . As the principal independent distributor in the area , he was without question interested in this new artist -- but not too interested , because not only was the artist unknown , the genre was untried . Still , Stan was always open_to new talent , he told Sam ; what was good for one was good for all . Elvis meanwhile drifted over to the auditorium . It was bigger than the Opry , with spacious dressing_rooms for the stars and a large common dressing_room on the second floor . The folding_chairs on the floor could be taken_up for dances or basketball exhibitions , and the balcony curved around on either side of the stage , giving the room a natural echo . He walked_out on the stage with his eyes fixed on the floor , looked_up once briefly as if measuring the crowd , and then walked back to the hotel . The Negro shacks in the Bottoms , just a_few blocks from the grand auditorium entrance , were not much different than the ramshackle structures of Shake Rag , the poor black neighborhood in Tupelo , or the primitive shotguns of South Memphis ; Shreveport ' s bustling downtown just a_couple_of blocks away was busy and full_of_life , and when he ran_into Scotty and Bill in the hotel coffee_shop , Bill already had his eye on a pretty waitress . . . . When Elvis arrived back at the auditorium that night , it was completely different , transformed by the presence not just of an audience and musicians in colorful Western outfits but by the almost palpable anticipation that something was going_to happen . He was wearing a pink jacket , white pants , a black shirt , a brightly colored clip-on bow_tie and the kind of two-tone shoes that were known as co-respondent shoes , because they were the kind that a snappy salesman or a co-respondent in a divorce case might be expected to wear . Scotty and Bill were wearing matching Western shirts with decorative bibs and dark ties . Bill ' s battered bass looked as if it were held together with baling wire , Elvis cradled his child-size guitar , and only Scotty ' s handsome Gibson ES 295 lent a touch of professional class to the trio . But everyone was taken with the boy . Pappy Covington greeted Sam and the boys warmly , as if he hadn ' t seen them in months . Even Horace Logan , renowned not just for his impresario ' s instincts but for his frosty air of self-congratulation , seemed to take_to the boy -- there was something about him that brought_out almost a protective quality , even in seasoned professionals . Sam left to take his seat in the audience . Although he had put_up a brave front all day , he really didn ' t know how it was going_to come_out , and he felt_like he should do his best to at least try to cue up a sympathetic response from the crowd . He had to admit that he was worried ; the boy looked as if he was scared to death , and even though you could rationalize that they were all experienced veterans by now -- all those nights at the Eagle ' s Nest , the original triumph at Overton Park and of course their Opry appearance -- in another way everyone knew that this could be the end of the line . Horace Logan was out onstage . &quot; Is there anyone from Mississippi ? Anyone from Arkansas ? Let ' s hear it from the folks from Oklahoma . Now who here ' s from Louisiana ? Now how many of y ' all are from the great state of Texas ? &quot; A mighty roar went_up as the Western Union clock_on the wall registered 8 o ' clock precisely and the band struck_up the familiar Hayride theme , based on the old Negro &quot; minstrel &quot; song , &quot; Raise a Ruckus Tonight. &quot; &quot; Come along , everybody come_along , &quot; the audience all joined in , &quot; while the moon is shining bright / We ' re going to have a wonderful time / At the Louisiana Hayride tonight. &quot; A tall , skinny singer from Shreveport with a television_show in Monroe sidled_up to the new sensation -- he was barely 20 himself and had been knocked_out by Elvis Presley ever since hearing the first record at Jiffy Fowler ' s Twin City Amusements , a jukebox operation in West Monroe . &quot; I said , ' Hello , Elvis , my name is Merle Kilgore. ' He turned_around and said , ' Oh , you worked with Hank Williams. ' I said , ' Yeah. ' He said , ' You wrote &quot; More and More &quot; ( a No . 1 hit for Webb Pierce in the fall of 1954 ) . ' I said , ' Yeah. ' He said , ' I want to meet Tibby Edwards. ' It was the first thing he said to me . Tibby recorded for Mercury , and he was a star . I said , ' He ' s my buddy , we room together here in Shreveport. ' And I went and got Tibby and introduced him to Elvis . that ' s how we got_to be friends. &quot; &quot; JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO , &quot; intoned announcer Frank Page ' s impressively measured radio voice , &quot; a young_man from Memphis , Tenn. , recorded a song on the Sun label , and in just a matter of a_few weeks that record has skyrocketed right up the charts . It ' s really doing_good all_over the country . He ' s only 19 years old . He has a new , distinctive style . Elvis Presley . Let ' s give him a nice hand . . . Elvis , how are you this evening ? &quot; &quot; Just fine , how are you , sir ? &quot; &quot; You all geared_up with your band -- &quot; &quot; I ' m all geared_up ! &quot; &quot; To let us hear your songs ? &quot; &quot; Well , I ' d like to say how happy we are to be out here . It ' s a real honor for us to hav -- get a chance to appear on the Louisiana Hayride . And we ' re going to do a song for you . You got anything else to say , sir ? &quot; &quot; No , I ' m ready. &quot; &quot; We ' re gonna do a song for you we got_on the Sun record , it goes something like this . . . &quot; And with that , he launched into the first side of his first Sun single . The cheers that went_up from the audience were encouraged by Frank Page and Horace Logan as they stood to the side of the Lucky Strike backdrop . The microphones hanging_out over the floor were turned_up when Scotty took a somewhat uncertain solo , and the audience politely responded . Elvis was visibly nervous , his knees were practically knocking together , and the jackknife action of his legs was about all , Sam Phillips was convinced , that was preventing him from blowing his brains out . The reaction was not all that different from the one he had gotten_on the Opry -- he was so ill_at_ease it was hard for the audience to really like him , even though it was clear to Sam that they might want to do just that , that they were ready , like Memphis audiences , to respond to the boy ' s charm . In between shows Sam went backstage to talk to Elvis . Merle Kilgore noticed them off in a corner huddled together as Sam exhorted Elvis to just relax : The people were there to see him , just let them see what you got , put_on your kind of show , if it didn ' t work , well , the hell with it , at least we can say we tried . Elvis , Merle noted , looked_like he was scared stiff . Sam Phillips went_to take his seat among the audience ; after a little while the trio came_out to do their two numbers , but this time it was entirely different . Much of the younger audience from the first show had stayed for the second , and now they were ready for what the new singer had to offer . For Sam it was a moment never to be forgotten . &quot; There was a college up in Texarkana where Elvis ' records had gotten hot , and some of the young people from that college had turned_up . Well , when he got_through that first number , they were_on their feet -- and not just them either . Some big fat lady -- I mean , it took an effort for her to get_up , and she got_up and didn ' t stop talking , right in the middle of the next number , she didn ' t know who I was , she just said , ' Man , have you ever heard anything that good ? ' And , honestly , the tonal impact couldn ' t have competed with the Maddox Brothers and Rose , or the Carlisles , who had been_on the week before -- I mean , they were pros . But Elvis had this factor of communication , I think the audience saw in him the desire to please , he had that little innocence about him , and yet he had something about him that was almost impudent in a way , that was his crutch . He certainly didn ' t mean to be impudent , but he had enough of that along with what he could convey that was just beautiful and lovely -- and I ' m not talking_about his physical beauty , because he didn ' t look that pretty then or that good-looking , by conventional standards he should have been thrown_off that stage . But I calculated that stuff in my mind : Are they going_to resent him with his long sideburns -- that could be a plus or a minus . But when he came_through like he did , it was neither . He stood on_his_own . &quot; He did the same two numbers that he had for the first show -- there were no encores , because Mr. Logan was very strict about encores , you didn ' t take one unless there was a genuine eruption of the sort that overwhelmed Hank Williams when he sang &quot; Lovesick Blues &quot; seven times in a row and could have kept going all night . For Elvis and Scotty and Bill it wasn ' t anything like that , but all three grew visibly more confident , and Elvis , for all_the terror that had just engulfed him , responded warmly to the crowd ' s enthusiasm for him . Some of the Hayride veterans , like 27-year-old Jimmy &quot; C &quot; Newman , who had just had his first big hit with &quot; Cry , Cry Darling , &quot; regarded the proceedings with a certain amount of suspicion . &quot; I ' d never seen anything like it before . Here comes this guy , I guess you could almost call him an amateur , rings of dirt on his neck , but he had it all_right from the start . He didn ' t work into it , he just knew what he was going_to do . We ' d just stand_in the wings and shake our heads . ' It can ' t be , it can ' t last , it ' s got_to be a fad. ' &quot; &quot; I think he scared them a little ( in the first show ) , &quot; said Merle Kilgore . &quot; He was really on the toes of his feet singing . I think they thought he was going_to jump_off the stage . But when he came_back out , he destroyed them -- by now they knew he wasn ' t going_to jump_off the stage and beat them , and they absolutely exploded. &quot; &quot; What he did , &quot; said Jim- my &quot; C &quot; Newman , &quot; was he changed it all around . After that we had to go_to Texas to work , there wasn ' t any work anywhere else , because all they wanted was someone to imitate Elvis , to jump up and down on the stage and make a fool of themselves . It was embarrassing to me to see it -- Elvis could do_it , but few others could. &quot; * From &quot; Last Train to Memphis , &quot; 1994 by Peter Guralnick .
