   <HEADLINE> GAY RELATIONSHIPS ALSO SUBJECT TO ' BATTERED PERSON ' S SYNDROME ' ; VIOLENCE : PROVING THE PRIOR ABUSE CAN BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE POLICE USUALLY ARE NOT CALLED . JURISTS AND LAWS OFTEN ARE UNSYMPATHETIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The quarrel began at a bar and continued when John Wigglesworth III and Kenneth Smith returned home after midnight . Wigglesworth pushed Smith into an aquarium and Smith stabbed him . Wigglesworth crawled across the street -- Smith followed , and stood_by crying as a neighbor tried to plug three stab wounds . &quot; You would n ' t understand . He ' s my lover . Please tell me that he ' s OK . Please , please say yes , &quot; Smith pleaded as he watched . Wigglesworth died after a lovers ' quarrel , authorities say . Smith ' s lawyer , John Mitchell Jr. , said except for its fatal conclusion , the incident was not unusual . The two had been together for a year , and early on Wigglesworth had started beating his client , Mitchell said -- a_couple_of times a month , in bars and at_home . This was to be Smith ' s defense -- the &quot; battered person ' s syndrome. &quot; Usually it is applied to women or sometimes children who have been pressed to violence in response to the violence they suffered . But rarely has it been used as a defense in a case involving a gay couple . One reason is that courts have refused to hear it ; another is that gays who have been battered rarely go_to authorities , so they have little evidence of the abuse that led them to fight_back . &quot; Many people . . . don ' t trust discussing an issue so volatile with a heterosexual who might not respect their relationship to begin with , &quot; said Robin Kane , a spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task_Force . Smith , however , did have a record of abuse he could cite : Mitchell said there were battery charges pending against Wigglesworth at the time of the killing for an incident where Smith ' s ribs were bruised . Nonetheless , Kanawha County Circuit Judge John Hey ruled that he would not allow Smith to claim he was a victim of battered person ' s syndrome . Though the state accepted the defense in 1987 for a woman who killed her husband , &quot; there ' s no precedent in West_Virginia for using that defense in the case of homosexuals , &quot; Hey said during the August hearing . Smith pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was given five years ' probation and credit for the year he served in home confinement . The courts ' opposition does not surprise gay-rights advocates . &quot; We see the law as using our relationships only as weapons , as justification , in the hands of our murderers far more often than we see the law taking our relationships seriously in_order to protect us , &quot; said Evan Wolfson of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund , which supports gay causes . Matt Foreman , executive_director of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project , said homosexuals who report spousal abuse face slim odds that their abusers will be convicted . About 350 cases of battery among homosexual partners are reported to his organization every year , but only about three make_it to court , he said . In the three most recent cases , two of the accused batterers were acquitted . In 1991 , an Ohio appellate_court ruled the state ' s domestic violence laws must cover homosexuals . But experts are unaware of similar rulings elsewhere , and some states ' laws explicitly exclude gay and lesbian couples . In this kind of a hostile environment , it is little wonder that battered person ' s syndrome is nearly unheard of in cases involving homosexuals . Denise Bricker , now a federal judge ' s clerk in New Haven , Conn. , said the first time a woman used the defense in connection with her female lover ' s death was in West Palm Beach , Fla. , in 1989 . Annette Green was convicted of fatally shooting her lover , but the judge gave her the minimum prison_term , sympathizing_with her claim that she acted in self-defense after years of abuse . &quot; It ' s a relationship among humans , &quot; Circuit Judge Tom Waddell said . Last year , in a very different kind of case , Peter Schneider said he was driven to kill his male boss , Dennis Waymire , after being sexually assaulted repeatedly . Schneider is heterosexual and Waymire was bisexual , Schneider ' s attorney said . The court in Yakima , Wash. , ruled that Schneider was a victim of battered person ' s syndrome and sentenced him to 21 months in prison for manslaughter , 10 months less than the standard sentence for the crime . &quot; When you view the deliberation and planning that went_into the killing of Dennis Waymire , it has to be done through the prism of the battered person syndrome , &quot; the judge said at sentencing . Paul Mones , a Santa Monica , Calif. , lawyer and an expert on battered person ' s syndrome , was one of Schneider ' s attorneys . &quot; We argued equal protection . If you have battered woman ' s syndrome , why should it be limited by gender if one can show that the same dynamics are there for men as well ? &quot; Mones said . &quot; What ' s really at_issue is not the sexual orientation , but the intimate relationship and the power dynamics , &quot; said Charles Patrick Ewing , an associate_professor of law and psychology at the State University of New York at Buffalo . &quot; To say that it ' s not valid simply because two people were members of the same sex strikes me as untenable , &quot; Ewing said . He said gay_men face double discrimination in the courts &quot; on the theory that a man certainly would n ' t find himself in that kind of situation where he was trapped and couldn ' t escape_from his abuser. &quot; But Kane of the National Gay and Lesbian Task_Force acknowledged that the gay community has only recently begun to address the issue . &quot; In the past five years there has been an increase in visibility in this issue . . . so people can feel safe stepping_forward , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
