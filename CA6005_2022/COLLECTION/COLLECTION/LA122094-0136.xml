   <HEADLINE> FEW GET RICH , MOST STRUGGLE IN CRACK ' S GRIM ECONOMY ; DRUGS : IN JOB-POOR AREAS , MANY TURN TO DEALING . BUT RICHES OFTEN ARE ILLUSORY , RIP-OFFS AND ARRESTS ALL TOO REAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sweat glistened on Nutty Boy ' s fuzzy lip as he dumped the dregs of his cocaine into a jar of steaming water . A 17-year-old high_school dropout , pudgy underneath an oversized T-shirt and sagging jeans , he is Los Angeles ' typical crack dealer . He lives with his aunt in a decaying cluster of South-Central apartments . He drives an American sedan punctured with bullet_holes . He once had a $ 100-a-week job planting trees , but discovered he could pocket that in a_few hours if he was willing to risk jail or death . With a kitchen mitt , he set the glass container inside a blackened saucepan , heating the solution until it lumped up into a pale , gray , gum-sized wad . In less than a minute , a teaspoon of worthless crumbs from the bottom of his stash had been recycled into a $ 40 rock -- a simple chemical_reaction that can be redeemed on almost any corner for instant cash . &quot; I pay my bills with this , keep myself dressed , eat every day and put gas in my car , &quot; said Nutty Boy , before running_out to peddle his creation . &quot; I ain ' t really trying to be no big bad king of L.A. dope dealers . It ' s more like a temporary way of getting by. &quot; In the mythology of urban Los Angeles , crack has bestowed fantastic wealth on an army of Uzi-toting gangbangers , teen-age Darth Vaders battling over the blood_money that floods their lawless streets . So lucrative is their trade , according to popular imagination , that thousands of youths have eschewed honest work for thick rolls of $ 100 bills , mocking a society of clock-punchers as they flaunt their beepers and fat gold chains . The economic reality of crack ' s hold_on Los Angeles is a far grimmer picture -- a poisonous mirage that promises riches for the destitute , but instead lures them down an even more virulent path . In the last decade , millions of dollars have flowed through the most depressed inner-city communities , only to evaporate like an addict ' s high . Rather than a ticket out of poverty , the crack business has amounted to a harsh underground economy , a fast-food drug trade financing the mundane basics of working-class life . Swarming legions of peddlers , brazenly parading their wares , have become fixtures of a bleak curbside marketplace , flagging_down cars and pouncing on customers everywhere from the meanest Pico-Union tenement to the farthest corner of the San Fernando Valley . Night and day , hawking and haggling and hustling , they turn residential streets into open-air drug bazaars , verdant parks into treacherous battlefields , abandoned buildings into fetid smoke houses . At a ramshackle recycling center in South-Central , gaunt addicts eliminate the middleman , exchanging shopping_carts full of cans and bottles directly for their next rock . In the cheesy motels along Figueroa Street , the drug has devalued human flesh to what must be an all-time low . On the bustling fringes of MacArthur Park , crack is the vortex of a full-fledged black_market -- along with fraudulent green_cards , pirated telephone_calling cards and unlicensed gypsy cabs -- all taxed by street gangs who charge a daily &quot; rent &quot; of $ 20 to $ 40 per merchant . &quot; If you plan on profiting , you got_to take it like a serious job , &quot; said Nutty Boy , still hunched_over the kitchen_stove , just a_few steps from a group of neighborhood children in the living room watching after-school cartoons . &quot; From the 1st to the 5th , that ' s when most of the money rolls in , when the county checks arrive , &quot; he explained , estimating that he can take_in as much as $ 1 # 000 a day after his customers receive their welfare benefits . By the end of the month , though , the cash usually is long gone , which means Nutty Boy also must scrape to get_by . &quot; When they get paid , I get paid , &quot; he said , inspecting the lowly lump of crack he just pasted together . &quot; Right now , I ' ll probably have to give all_of this out on credit. &quot; No other drug has ever been marketed this way , or become so thoroughly enmeshed in the community ' s economic fabric . Unlike marijuana or heroin , whose effects generally sate the user for hours or even days , crack ' s short-lived high_commands the addict to return again and again as often as money will allow -- a relentless cycle of misery nurtured and exploited for commercial gain . When measured in $ 20 rocks , the drug may seem inexpensive , which is what lures both the seller and buyer so readily into the trade . But there ' s nothing cheap about a business that strips consumers of everything they own , fills prisons with tens of thousands of bodies and sparks shocking spasms of violence , some of it racially charged , as traffickers vie over the scarce resources in their neighborhoods . &quot; It ' s a sucker ' s game all around , &quot; said Earl Massey , 41 , a former dealer and recovering addict , who ended_up living_by candlelight , cooking by campfire and burning the walls_in his four-bedroom Pomona home for heat . &quot; The dealers become hooked just like the addicts : They ' re both a slave to the business , doing whatever the drug demands them to do. &quot; Far from a Mafia of ghetto godfathers , most crack dealers are small fish on the drug ' s international food_chain , the last retail link in an industry ultimately controlled by South_America ' s iron-fisted cartels . The median wage , according to a landmark 1989 RAND Corp . study of traffickers in Washington , amounts to just $ 721 a month . Even if a_few manage to make_it big , they usually fall victim to the vicissitudes of an illicit , cash-only world , without the benefits of insurance or credit . If their profit isn ' t consumed by food and shelter , it ' s invariably seized by police , consumed by legal_fees , stolen by rivals or squandered on conspicuous excesses that do nothing to enhance long-term economic health . &quot; Out of 20 # 000 gang members I ' ve known , I can count_on one hand the number who make enough from dope to cover a $ 600 apartment and a $ 400 car payment and take_care of their old_lady and kids , &quot; said Jim Galipeau , a veteran Los Angeles County probation_officer in the department ' s Metropolitan Specialized Gang Unit . &quot; Most of them would give it all up for a righteous $ 8-an-hour job with medical and dental. &quot; In an era of shrinking legitimate prospects , however , crack has become an equal-opportunity alternative , the employer of last_resort in many of Los Angeles ' poorest neighborhoods . It is the domain not just of gangbangers and criminal misfits , but of laid-off factory_workers who ' ll never recoup their union wages in an age of global competition , impressionable teen-agers who ' ve been told they need sneakers with triple-digit prices to be cool , single moms who can ' t pay the rent on single incomes . Some of them end_up becoming addicts themselves , selling just enough of the drug to support their own habit . But for most dealers , it ' s merely a commodity , a means to an end , which they ' d gladly exchange for widgets if that would generate the same rewards . In its own nefarious way , crack has created a new sub-class of urban entrepreneurs -- high-risk capitalists who speak not of breaking the law , but of &quot; getting paid. &quot; &quot; I knew people who were doing_it , but I said never , &quot; recalled a former crack dealer known as Arnell , who had the benefit of a stable , middle-class childhood in Inglewood , a parochial_school diploma and three years of Navy service that qualified him for work as a Northrop technician . &quot; It was kind of like a moral thing . I knew it just wasn ' t right. &quot; But Arnell ' s sense of morality proved no match for necessity ' s demands . Six months after landing his $ 11.20-an-hour aerospace job , he was broke -- one of thousands laid_off in 1986 after Northrop failed to sell its troubled F-20 fighter jet to the Pentagon . Day after day , Arnell said , he looked_for work without luck . His bills were stacking_up . His supply of instant noodles , the staple of his cupboard , was running_low . He fell a month behind on his $ 455 rent . It didn ' t help that his childhood friends , most of whom had begun peddling crack while he was in the military , were now living_in nicer apartments , driving nicer cars , wearing nicer clothes and eating nicer meals . &quot; I still had the idea that I was going_to find a real job , &quot; said Arnell , a solemn , soft-spoken , 29-year-old father of three . &quot; But I had to get paid. &quot; His initiation -- merely delivering half a kilo for his buddies -- netted him $ 1 # 000 in cash . With their help , he was soon dressing in silk Italian suits , driving a turbo Porsche and dropping $ 5 # 000 a hand on blackjack at Caesars Palace . By the following year , he had been shot with an Uzi during a drug heist and lost a home_in Rancho Cucamonga to a money-laundering scam . He also watched his cousin , a former firefighter whom he occasionally supplied with drugs , turn_into a destitute addict scrounging for his next rock on Skid_Row . &quot; that ' s when it began to wear_on my conscience , when I saw what the drugs were actually doing , &quot; said Arnell , who was lucky enough to salvage $ 12 # 000 in crack profits and buy himself a big-rig . Today , he still has a bullet lodged_in his shoulder , but his cousin is clean , and Arnell now supports his wife and kids hauling coal . &quot; I saw the glitter and thought it was gold , &quot; he said . &quot; But it ' s a game that nobody wins . It ain ' t designed for that . I was stupid and fell_into the trap. &quot; The crack trade has not just realigned inner-city commerce , it has infiltrated virtually every stratum of the Southern California economy -- from cellular_phone companies to paraphernalia manufacturers to the American banking system . Drugs literally have touched so_much money here that at least three-quarters of all bills in circulation are estimated to have trace amounts of cocaine . The Los Angeles branch of the Federal_Reserve_Bank has now surpassed Miami as the nation ' s cash-surplus leader -- an indicator , according U.S. Treasury agents , of the billions of dollars in profit that traffickers are laundering into legitimate channels . Some of the money passes_through legal businesses , such_as BMW dealers and Rolex merchants , who capitalize on crack ' s symbiotic relationship with the mainstream economy . But some white-collar crooks have gone_out of their way to cater to drug lords , such_as the proprietors of AMS Auto Sales , a La Cienega Boulevard dealership that routinely sold $ 60 # 000 luxury sedans for suitcases full of $ 100 bills -- sometimes even for kilos of cocaine -- no questions asked . &quot; In my mind , they ' re equally if not more culpable than the actual drug dealers , &quot; said former Assistant U.S. Atty . Michael Fitzgerald , who prosecuted the AMS owners . &quot; The people who get involved in that end of the business are very sophisticated and intelligent -- the exact sort of people who could easily have made a legitimate living. &quot; Lawyers have made millions representing suspected traffickers , even though they risk losing their fees if it can be proven that the money came from illicit sources . Westside attorney Alan Fenster -- who defended Freeway Ricky Ross , one of Los Angeles ' richest cocaine dealers -- said his own discomfort over &quot; profiting from these ill-begotten proceeds &quot; helped persuade him to abandon his practice for several years . The law_enforcement community has similarly tasted the riches of cocaine -- in ways both beneficial and corrupt . Police agencies have reaped so_much money in asset forfeitures , for example , that when Burbank Chief David P . Newsham dedicated his city ' s new heliport in September , he jokingly thanked narcotics dealers for being &quot; good_enough to pay their share. &quot; But the temptation to grab a share of drug profits also brought_down nearly the entire anti-narcotics team of the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department in the 1980s . At last count , more_than two_dozen deputies had been convicted in the worst money-skimming scandal in local law_enforcement history . &quot; We still demonize the people standing on the street_corner with a bag in their hand , or the mythical godfather-type running the show , but the truth is . . . everybody ' s suspect , &quot; said ex-Assistant U.S. Atty . Thomas Hagemann , the lead prosecutor in the case . &quot; I suppose it ' s about as powerful as any temptation we know. &quot; If a well-trained , middle-class professional sworn to uphold the law can succumb , it takes even less for a defiant teen-ager who feels the deck already is stacked against him . Nowhere has that theme echoed more hauntingly than in South-Central Los Angeles , where crack ' s impact was felt first and probably fiercest . Although crack now touches almost every corner of the region , South-Central ' s long history of economic deprivation , racial oppression and social isolation left it particularly susceptible to the drug ' s financial lure . &quot; When you come from having nothing , and everyone around you has nothing , what ' s wrong ? I mean what ' s really considered wrong ? &quot; said DJ Pooh , one of South-Central ' s hottest-selling rap producers , who bought his first turntable a decade ago with crack profits . &quot; When pushed , all people -- and I mean all people -- are animals . They ' ll do whatever ' s necessary to survive. &quot; The drug ' s arrival was paved by a wave of deindustrialization that convulsed the Southern California economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s , wiping_out tens of thousands of high-wage factory jobs made obsolete by foreign competition . At the same time , Los Angeles ' safety net of social programs was being slashed by Proposition 13 and Reagan_Administration cutbacks , more bad news for the unskilled and unemployed . Since then , economists say that Los Angeles ' work_force has grown only more polarized , with new jobs being created in the high-paying technical fields and minimum-wage service sector -- but little in between . In South-Central Los Angeles , according to U.S. Census data , that translated into just a 6.5 % gain in per capita income during the 1980s , while an increase of 14.8 % was posted citywide . &quot; You can be as strong as you want and have_the_best values in the world , &quot; said Karen Bass , executive_director of the Community Coalition for Substance_Abuse Prevention and Treatment . &quot; But there ' s nothing that destabilizes a family quicker than unemployment and nothing that destroys an individual ' s self-esteem like not being able to feed their own children. &quot; Into that void flowed a new cut-rate stimulant , potent , compact , durable and neatly packaged in units small enough for anyone to afford -- &quot; like McDonald ' s bringing 15-cent hamburgers to everyone on the streets , &quot; said U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration special_agent John Marcello . Crack tapped into a market that was hungry for smokable cocaine , serving_up a drug that was easier and less hazardous to use than earlier freebase methods . But crack was also invented as a scheme to expand the market at a time when a glut of cocaine threatened to drive prices downward . Although the identities of those who concocted the formula remain unclear , there ' s no doubting the effectiveness of their ploy . &quot; If you were going_to introduce a new product and wanted cheap labor and huge profits -- without advertising , investment or infrastructure -- you would n ' t look in Beverly Hills , &quot; said J . Eugene Grigsby , director of UCLA ' s Center for African American Studies . &quot; From the perspective of a pure marketing analysis , the conditions in most African American urban_areas were ripe to spawn an alternative economic structure. &quot; Demand for the intense but fleeting high was insatiable , the customer base captive . A huge labor_pool , already alienated from the mainstream work_force , jumped at the promise of an instant payday . Getting a piece of the action required no job_application , no educational background and no special training -- other_than street savvy , one of the few skills already in plentiful supply . &quot; It was like , ' I don ' t need no education , I don ' t got_to kiss nobody ' s ass , I ' m the boss , this is my enterprise -- and I ' m only 16 , ' &quot; said ex-gangster T . Rodgers , a founding father of the Bloods , who ruled over a now-defunct crack empire during the 1980s . &quot; Any kid old enough to hold a rock could become king for a day. &quot; South-Central street gangs , viewed by the cocaine smugglers as tough but expendable foot_soldiers , provided a ready-made distribution network for the marketing of this new discount commodity . In a so-called &quot; Dun and Bradstreet Primer &quot; issued in 1989 by the U.S. attorney_general , the Bloods and Crips were described as the nation ' s most powerful crack-trafficking ring , urban terrorists who had achieved dominance in at least 47 cities , &quot; due in part to their steady recourse to murderous violence. &quot; The most sophisticated gang factions , along with their prison-based leadership , do control a large share of the wholesale trade , sometimes buying directly from Colombian suppliers . They also have embarked_on an unprecedented cross-country migration , lured by profits many times higher than on Los Angeles ' saturated streets . But most authorities ultimately have come_to see the gangs less as huge conglomerates than as independent contractors -- bandit franchisees duking it out_in a cutthroat market . Unlike Mafias of past generations , which were able to parlay their ill-gotten gains into legitimate enterprises , most street gangs haven ' t demonstrated that kind of cohesiveness or business acumen . Even if tainted , such ventures might at least have created a_few more avenues to mainstream success in the city ' s most desolate neighborhoods . Instead , like a giant plantation economy , crack has only intensified the financial vacuum , siphoning up the spare change of people who have nothing left to spare . &quot; Crack may have allowed some people to kind of take_care of business and support their families , but it ' s essentially a redistributive , zero-sum economy that squeezes the last cents out of the poorest communities in America , &quot; said Los Angeles historian Mike Davis , who has written extensively about the trade . &quot; Despite all_the gangsta rap images of these new robber-baron coke-dealers . . . I think black Americans will emerge from this pretty much as they always have : the victims. &quot; Norman Tillman was bigger than most street-level dealers ever dream of becoming , a true high-rolling , fast-living , crack impresario . &quot; But it ' s an illusion -- a delusion , &quot; said Tillman , 35 , who figures he was worth about $ 700 # 000 before his coast-to-coast drug ring collapsed in the late 1980s . A graduate of Dorsey High in Southwest Los Angeles , Tillman spent his teen-age years toiling in a string of low-paying jobs , from pumping gas to marinating fast-food chicken to stripping paint . Later , he served in the Marine Corps and won a tennis scholarship to The Citadel in South Carolina , but broke his ankle and ended_up living_on a $ 250-a-month unemployment check . When childhood friends sent him a first-class plane_ticket back to California in 1983 , they enlisted Tillman in one of the most prolific crack-dealing crews ever to rise_up from Los Angeles ' streets . In the span of a_few years , he moved from selling crack on the curbside to supervising a network of rock houses to netting about $ 50 # 000 a week distributing kilos to other dealers across the country . &quot; It had all_the trappings of legitimacy , &quot; said Tillman , an imposing , statuesque man with a shaved head and silver hoop earring . &quot; I felt as successful as any other successful businessman . . . on the same par as a Ph.D. graduate with money-management skills. &quot; But Tillman ' s success was as ephemeral as a $ 20 rock . In rapid succession , his cohorts got busted -- in Chicago , in Boston , in Indianapolis -- costing him hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost product , bail_bonds and legal_fees . After his supplier was indicted , Tillman lost even more buying bogus dope from unreliable connections . He invested $ 80 # 000 in a children ' s photography studio that he called Tiny Tots , but his employees walked_off with the cameras . At home , meanwhile , Tillman ' s poison also was taking its toll . A brother , now in rehab , got hooked on crack . So did a sister , who was forced to surrender a child to foster care . Another brother was gunned_down in a drive-by . And their father , a disabled steelworker , died of a stroke -- just as he filled his lungs with a long drag of cocaine smoke . &quot; I had lost_control of the animal , &quot; Tillman said . &quot; The animal had turned_into a beast. &quot; Broke and repentant , Tillman recently tried his hand at the condom business , peddling a new skin-toned brand on the very South-Central streets where he once dealt crack . But with a profit-margin of just 8 cents per prophylactic , he gave it up in November and headed back to his native Chicago , where he hopes to land a job in a housing authority drug recovery program . &quot; When he was handling all that cash , I tried to tell him , ' You can ' t keep this up , &quot; ' said Tillman ' s 72-year-old mother , Bernice , a retired cafeteria worker . &quot; But he didn ' t listen . All those millions -- and the powers-that-be got_it all back. &quot; Few dealers , in fact , ever make_it out of the bottom rungs of the business , which has spawned almost unlimited entry-level opportunities but little real hope for long-term advancement . In pure financial terms , they barely rank above the Huallaga Valley ' s campesinos , poor Andean farmers who make_up for their own lack of economic mobility by harvesting the coca leaves in the first place . The big bucks always have gone_to those who control the cocaine pipeline between South_America and the United States : cartels in Colombia , smugglers in Mexico , corrupt politicians and bribe-taking police from Latin_America to California . Ex-Medellin kingpin Pablo Escobar probably lost more to mildew -- $ 400 million of his cash reportedly once rotted in a Los Angeles stash house -- than the Bloods or Crips ever made in a decade . Whenever a dope dealer does make_it big -- or a basketball_player or a rapper -- their success becomes entwined in the folklore of the streets , inspiring others to follow that route . This is a country , after all , that not only prizes the entrepreneurial spirit , but heaps scorn on those who fail to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps . Although the odds are slim , most young hustlers have nothing but a dismal future to lose . For all its horrific costs , crack has at least served as an antidote to defeat . &quot; I got one homeboy , I guess he don ' t like money or he ' s just stupid , because he goes_around with his pocket empty all_the time , &quot; said Ozzy , 21 , who can make more money in one night selling crack than most families in his Eastside housing project ever see in a month . Like many dealers , he ' s got little to show for it , other_than tales of cruising in limos , renting motel_rooms for nights on end and buying an ' 83 Cadillac , which his friends promptly smashed_up , unlicensed and uninsured . But Ozzy , who hasn ' t asked his parents for a dime since dropping_out of the eighth grade , takes_pride in knowing that he ' s got the cash to burn . &quot; As long as I got money in my pocket , &quot; he said , after handing a friend a_few bucks to fetch him a cheeseburger , &quot; I must be doing something right. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) About This Series In this four-part series , The Times examines how Los Angeles County ' s neighborhoods , institutions and morals have been ravaged by a decade of crack , the most addictive form of cocaine ever devised . * Sunday : Crack drains funds from vital public agencies , imposing a hidden_tax on everyone . * Monday : Crack creates a new_wave of homelessness , bringing more crime and despair to the streets . * Today : Crack forges an underground economy , luring a generation with false promises . * Wednesday : Crack takes_down a neighborhood -- but the spirit of its residents brings it back . ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) The Economics of Crack Over the last decade , crack has spawned an underground economy in Los Angeles that employs thousands of traffickers , many of whom view the illicit trade as their only financial option . Before it arrives on the streets , the drug passes_through many hands , each time increasing in value . 1 ) Harvesting : Hundreds of thousands of poor South_American farmers earn their livelihood growing coca leaves . Price : In Bolivia , one carga of leaves , or about 100 pounds , fetches between $ 38 and $ 51 . 2 ) Refining : In makeshift labs throughout the Andean countries , the leaves are soaked in kerosene and acid , turning them into cocaine sulfate , also known as coca paste . The paste is further treated with chemical solvents , resulting in powdered cocaine . Price : Before it leaves South_America , a kilogram of powder , or 2.2 pounds , is worth between $ 950 and $ 1 # 200 . 3 ) Shipping : As a result of crackdowns off the Florida coast , most shipments have been redirected to California via overland routes . Mexican smuggling rings now handle an estimated 70 % of the cocaine bound here . Price : For their trouble , they charge their Los Angeles connections between $ 12 # 000 and $ 14 # 000 per kilo . 4 ) Wholesaling : Southland street gangs and their prison-based leadership control most wholesale distribution of the drug , which they cook into crack by adding baking soda and water . Price : When resold , often in one-ounce packets , each kilo can bring_in between $ 25 # 000 and $ 35 # 000 . Retailing : The retail trade is a laissez-faire market , open_to just about anybody willing to stand on a street_corner with a plastic bag of crack . Price : The standard curbside price is $ 20 per rock , a small nugget that averages about 0.2 of a gram . A kilo broken_into these individual rocks will generate at least $ 100 # 000 , and as much as $ 200 # 000 if cut with adulterants such_as lidocaine and procaine . Using : Crack ' s potent but short-lived punch commands addicts to return again and again as often as money will allow . Price : The average crack user , according to one study , smokes about seven or eight rocks a day -- a habit that runs about $ 1 # 050 a week .
