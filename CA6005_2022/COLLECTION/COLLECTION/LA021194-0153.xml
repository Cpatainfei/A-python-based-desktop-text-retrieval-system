   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : VAN NUYS ; GROUP COOKS_UP QUAKE AID FROM BIG RIGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s the ultimate in meals on wheels . Driving semi-trucks loaded with portable cooking gear and volunteers from five states have converged at the Van Nuys Airport to cook meals for earthquake victims and relief workers . &quot; By the end of this week , we ' ll have cooked more_than 1 million meals , &quot; said 59-year-old Jerry Bob &quot; JB &quot; Taylor of Stanton , Tex. , who heads the Texas delegation for the Southern Baptist Convention Disaster Relief program . The meals are picked_up and delivered to Valley shelters by the American Red_Cross , which also provides the food . The meals , some of which are second helpings , are devoured by earthquake victims , volunteers and others who work to provide earthquake relief . The organization whipped_up nearly 4 million meals in parts of Florida and Louisiana in the two months following Hurricane Andrew . The Texas delegation is working with volunteers from four other states -- Missouri , Mississippi , California and Oklahoma . They have been cooking outside a hangar since Jan . 19 , two days after the earthquake . The menu -- three meals a day -- tends to lean toward stews and one-dish meals . &quot; When we talk_about meals , we ' re not talking_about a meat , a vegetable , a dessert and a salad , &quot; said Taylor . &quot; We need to feed a lot of people in a little time , &quot; said Taylor , a 24-year veteran of relief efforts . &quot; I can fix 2 # 000 meals in 40 minutes , &quot; he said . To this end , the trucks are equipped with an armament of culinary aids for any disaster . This includes water purification tanks , 28-gallon cooking pots , food storage containers that keep food hot , and even ham radios to take food orders when phone_lines are down . Like buses that carry rock_stars on concert tours , the side of each truck is also inscribed with the locations of the disasters to which they have rushed . There are 37 disaster locations on the Texas truck alone -- from the Paris , Tex. , tornado in 1984 to the Mexico_City earthquake of 1985 . But each disaster requires a slightly different menu , Taylor said . In the San Fernando Valley , for example , the majority of people receiving food are Latino , so his crew of volunteers make the food somewhat spicy . Even so , Taylor said he has to keep_an_eye_on volunteer Milton Schmidt of Irving , Tex . The 65-year-old Schmidt , who sometimes carries a bottle of Texas hot_sauce in a holster , often tries to sneak a little jalapeno and chili_peppers into whatever he ' s cooking . &quot; We have to kind of hold him down a little bit during disasters , &quot; Taylor said , &quot; so he doesn ' t make_it too hot. &quot; JEFF SCHNAUFER</TEXT>
