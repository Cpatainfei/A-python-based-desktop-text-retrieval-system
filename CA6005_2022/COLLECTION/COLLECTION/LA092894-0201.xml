   <TEXT> If you need access to Internet resources but don ' t want to pay the $ 20 or so a month that most commercial providers charge , you might consider a local Freenet . Freenets operate like large computer bulletin_boards , providing access to information resources and offering e-mail.Currently there are 15 Freenets in the United States . In the Los Angeles area , the local Freenet is based in Encino . You can enter some areas of the system for free . But a $ 10 annual fee is required if you want to send and receive e-mail through the Internet , post messages , use the chat area or access enhanced features . One of the main goals of Freenets is to provide a user-friendly interface to popular Internet services . The L.A. Freenet uses a series of menus to help you select the data you want and provides access to a vast array of resources , covering everything from aikido dojos to mountain climbing . To access the L.A. Freenet , set your modem software to 8 bits , no parity and 1 stop bit -- the standard settings for reaching a BBS -- and have your computer dial ( 818 ) 776-5000 . For further information , you can call L.A. Freenet at ( 818 ) 954-0080 . ADAM S . BAUMAN</TEXT>
