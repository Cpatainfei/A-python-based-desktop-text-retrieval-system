   <HEADLINE> CYBURBS OFFER REFUGE TO LIFE-WEARY URBANITES ; COMPUTERS : THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY LEADS TO THE LAND OF GAMES , BUT IT ' S A PATH THAT MAY BE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Welcome to the Cyburbs , that computer-driven game land on the outskirts of Reality just off the Information Highway where more of us are stopping these days to avoid getting a life . Apparently , we ' re succeeding . For while we may cluck publicly about our kids wasting time and mind with TV video_games like &quot; Mortal Kombat , &quot; it turns_out that we , their parents , are privately firing_up the PC and going bug-eyed till dawn playing &quot; Falcon3 , &quot; the next best thing to a government warplane simulator . Or &quot; Links 386 Pro , &quot; which simulates a round_of_golf at Hilton Head Island . Or &quot; Betrayal at Krondor , &quot; or &quot; The 7th Guest , &quot; or &quot; The Castle of Dr. Brain &quot; or &quot; CyberStrike. &quot; Or you name it . Highly sophisticated computer_games -- both the boxed variety available in software stores and those available only through on-line network services -- have gotten their hooks into more grown-ups than would like to admit it . &quot; Computer_games have the potential for real addictiveness , &quot; says Johnny Wilson , editor of Computer_Gaming World , where gamers who go overboard are jokingly referred to as &quot; cyburbs. &quot; But Michelle M . Weil , of Orange , Calif. , a recognized authority on the effects of computer use on the psyche , isn ' t joking when she says , &quot; Computer_games are extremely addictive. &quot; And not just the store-bought ones . &quot; I think playing on-line network games has a much higher addictive potential than regular computer_games , &quot; says Weil . &quot; With a ( boxed ) computer_game , you ' re always aware it is a game . With on-line types of services , people can spend lots of time talking in the protection of_their_own home or office with no face-to-face interaction . The underlying danger : The more time you spend facing the screen the less time you spend doing other things. &quot; Endless anecdotes scroll forth from gaming groups about people spending $ 800 or more a year on boxed computer_games , or those spending so_much time playing multi-player , on-line games with unseen opponents at $ 3 an hour that they run_up annual bills as high as $ 15 # 000 . Some networks , recognizing the potential for problems , encourage subscribers to set limits on the amount_of_time they spend . Says one network representative , &quot; They are so engrossing that players have no perception of time . People have to slap you on the head or set an alarm to tell you when to quit. &quot; &quot; It ' s not unlike alcohol consumption , &quot; says gamer Steve Ames , a free-lance photographer in Alexandria , Va. , by day and devotee of &quot; Falcon3 &quot; in his off hours . &quot; Some people savor the flavor . Some just like to take the edge off . And then there are those that binge . Some make the joke , ' I should have a life. ' There ' s more_than a little bit of nervous laughter about that. &quot; And there should be , says Valerie Lorenz , a Baltimore psychologist who heads the National Center for Pathological Gambling Inc. &quot; We know that many people become totally mesmerized by computer_games , &quot; says Lorenz , who sees many similar behavior patterns between avid computer gamers and compulsive gamblers . &quot; Unfortunately , nothing is ever done about it . There is no visible negative impact other_than the tremendous amount_of_time spent . There is no concrete problem such_as loss of money , so people tend not to see it as a problem , where it really is. &quot; When GEnie , a Rockville , Md.-based company that offers games and a variety of information services , agreed to arrange an on-line question-and-answer session for the Baltimore Sun , about 40 players from across the United States and Canada weighed in with their comments during a two-hour period . Most said the cost of gaming wasn ' t an issue for them , but they were divided on whether heavy game-playing kept them from real-life friendships . &quot; If you spend too_much time on-line , the real_world can suffer to_the_point that the only people you are left with is the on-line types , &quot; offered Bruce Gessleman from Texas . Another player , identified only as Jay from Sun Valley , Calif. , added , &quot; Sure , you can play games and have relationships on-line , but it just isn ' t the same as a face-to-face relationship. &quot; And it ' s time , not money , that is at_issue . &quot; With my job and Army Reserves and gaming , the family does resent the time I spend , &quot; said an attorney from Annandale , Va. , commenting via the GEnie network . &quot; But at least I ' m home most nights. &quot; that ' s similar to what another &quot; Falcon3 &quot; buff from Virginia said earlier . &quot; I tell my wife it could be much worse . I could have bought a bass boat and still have nothing to show and be gone_on weekends. &quot; But such arguments sound a lot like rationalizing to Lorenz . &quot; It ' s classic denial , &quot; she says . &quot; Anything done to excess , one would have to evaluate the real reason for it , not the stated reason . Compulsive gamblers say they gamble for money , but they gamble because they can ' t tolerate the pain or the difficulty they are having in relating to their family or job stresses. &quot;</TEXT>
