   <HEADLINE> CENTERPIECE : PULLING OFF SOME SEASONAL MAGIC ; YOU CAN ENSURE THAT FESTIVITIES ARE A CELEBRATION INSTEAD OF A CHORE BY MAKING USE OF SPECIALITY SERVICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tick . Tick . Tick . If you hadn ' t noticed before today , the sight of Santa Claus bringing_up the rear of a Thanksgiving_Day parade probably pounded the point into your head : The holidays are upon us , big_time . With Hanukkah , Christmas and New Year ' s looming ahead , there are parties to host and attend ; out-of-town guests to house , feed and entertain ; food to buy and prepare ; cards to send_out ; gifts to select , pay_for , and deliver ; houses and trees to decorate . Time is tight enough February through October for the average Ventura County resident . But add_on the extra holiday chores ( sorry , make that pleasures ) and there ' s not much time left to breathe . And better make that a shallow breath . A deep one and you ' ve wasted a good three to five seconds . Tick . Tick . Tick . Wasn ' t it about this time last year you said , &quot; Next year , I ' ll shop early , say no to hosting the family get-together , and just keep it simple ? &quot; Oops . Forgot about that , didn ' t you ? We don ' t mean to seem Scrooge-like -- the holidays are a festive time_of_year . Time can be a problem , but as with most problems , there are solutions . We here at Life would like to offer some suggestions on saving time this holiday season . You may be one of those independent types who likes to take_on a challenge all alone , but don ' t be ashamed to accept help . There are plenty of businesses more_than willing to lend a hand as the holidays gain momentum and the stress builds . But before we get_to the tips , let ' s talk briefly about the stress . With relatives visiting and malls packed with shoppers , lack of time is only one aspect of holiday stress . Judith Sitko , a Ventura therapist , sees another . &quot; What I hear most about holiday stress is the guilt , the feeling of obligation , &quot; she said of the mandatory gift-giving and party-throwing . &quot; If someone doesn ' t have the time to do everything , but they don ' t feel guilty about it , they just say , ' I ' m just not going_to do_it this year. ' &quot; Thus , no sense of obligation , no guilt , no stress over the shortage of time . It ' s great if you can do_it . But for those of you who do feel that obligation , and do hear the ticking of the holiday clock , here are some suggestions regarding gift-giving , party planning and house decorating . LIMITING THE LIST we ' ll begin with the gifts . Sitko suggests limiting the list of recipients to a precious few -- maybe just the very closest relatives and friends . &quot; I buy gifts just for the children , &quot; she said , &quot; and that has eased a lot of the stress for me. &quot; There ' s always the generic gift certificate , to save on_time . And don ' t forget , you can always invoke that &quot; naughty or nice &quot; clause for the undeserving . Catalogues and home shopping networks are two other ways to go . You can shop to your heart ' s content by phone without leaving the comforts of your favorite chair . Unfortunately , it ' s a little late in the game , since you often must allow four to six weeks for delivery . If it ultimately comes_down to conventional department_store shopping , however , there ' s still no need to feel overwhelmed . At Bullock ' s in Thousand Oaks , there ' s a person on staff who helps people shop . And if you can afford to spend an extra few bucks , you can hire someone to shop for you . We tracked_down a_few of them . Robin Albanese of Simi Valley loves to shop . She had considered turning the pastime into gainful employment for several years , but it wasn ' t until a_couple_of months ago that she finally started her Shop Around Town service . &quot; My husband is a crisis negotiator for the city of Los Angeles ( Police_Department ) . He was at the mansion when O.J. surrendered . There was all this hoopla around him , &quot; said Albanese . &quot; I said , ' You know , honey , you get_to do a lot of fun things . You ' ve done what you wanted to do your whole life . Don ' t you think it ' s time I get_to do what I want to do ? ' &quot; Thus , Shop Around Town was born . &quot; There are a fair amount of people in our community who have the financial resources , but they have those financial resources because they are workaholics . They have the money , but what they don ' t have is the time , &quot; said Albanese . &quot; Most of my clients are men because they lack the real desire to shop . Absolutely one of the most distasteful things for them to do is enter a mall. &quot; Sometimes Albanese ' s clients know exactly what they want her to buy , other times she needs to conduct an interview . She may offer suggestions , or let them browse through her couple of hundred catalogues . &quot; Most of us buy gifts we enjoy receiving , so it ' s not so_much that I need to understand who the recipient is , but who the giver is , &quot; she said . &quot; I try to please the giver . If they are proud_of the gift and pleased to give it , then my job is done. &quot; Oak View ' s Lynne Stanfield , operator of Santa ' s Little Helper , a year-round personal shopping service , sees her business as a way of helping people prioritize their chores during the holidays . &quot; It allows people to take_away one of the pressures of the holidays . It ' s enough to sit_down and make a shopping list , &quot; she said . &quot; If someone is willing to do your buying and even wrap the gifts for you , then that allows you to focus_on spending time with the family , or planning a dinner , or putting_up decorations , or sending_out cards. &quot; Stanfield ' s clients range from men who don ' t have a clue about what to buy for that special person , to women who don ' t like to shop or can ' t fit the activity into an already hectic schedule . Nonetheless , like Stanfield , her clients realize the significance of gift-giving . &quot; It ' s one of the basic things in our culture that shows caring , &quot; Stanfield said . &quot; It ' s a tradition of showing love and respect. &quot; Before meeting with prospective clients , Stanfield conducts introductory telephone_conversations to determine general needs . Then , like Albanese , she meets with the gift-givers to determine specifics . &quot; I find_out their needs and directions . Do they know specifically what they want ? Do they need ideas ? Shopping is my specialty and I have a knack for knowing where to find something . I know the importance of efficiency and I know the value of a dollar , &quot; said Stanfield . PLAYING HOST As with gift giving , there are simple solutions to the hassles of hosting a holiday dinner , whether it be for a large group of friends or a small collection of relatives . Just say no , would be one , said therapist Sitko . Short of that , a potluck might do wonders . &quot; Potlucks are very popular , &quot; she said . &quot; People are beginning to ask guests to bring a pie or the vegetables . I know some people say that ' s not appropriate , but it ' s becoming more accepted . People like to be invited to parties , so they don ' t care if they have to bring something. &quot; If you do end_up stuck_with the entire holiday meal , you may want to consider hiring a caterer or a personal chef . Let ' s start with the personal chef . Phyllis Kidd of Mira Monte , a perennial finalist in local cooking contests , is such a person . Earlier this month , she began her What ' s for Dinner ? business , in which she meets with clients , prepares a menu , buys the groceries and delivers 10 customized dinners to be frozen and heated when desired . Kidd had an instant response when she first promoted her business , and expects a feeding frenzy over the holidays . &quot; Women will spend three weeks planning , shopping and preparing_for just one meal -- Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner , &quot; she said . &quot; This is stuff you can go_home and heat_up ; the longest takes about 30 minutes. &quot; Just pop them into the oven when the guests arrive . Kidd greets prospective clients with a food questionnaire to help her plan the menu . Typically , the result is five different sets of meals prepared_for two . But she ' ll gladly prepare a holiday party and charges a set fee per 10 meals . When you ' re talking catering , however , often it means large_orders . But there are independent caterers who will serve small gatherings . Kay Corning of Kay ' s Gourmet Catering in Westlake tends to do huge events ( such_as the Sears Roebuck employees party ) , but she and her staff are available for groups as small as 25 . And if you pick_up the precooked food rather than having it delivered , served and cleaned_up , she will prepare as few as 10 meals . Of course , your pocketbook may dictate the amount of food you have catered . But if you ' re willing to take_on some of the main dish cooking chores , you might want a caterer who just provides the appetizers or desserts . &quot; Usually people call us because they want a dessert that ' s a little fancier than they ' ve normally dealt with in the past , and the idea of trying to make_it during the holidays is a little overwhelming for them , &quot; said La Starr Heiliger , owner of La Starr and Company in Ventura . And what about the most obvious form of dinner help ? Just because you ' re hosting a fancy feast , doesn ' t mean you should ignore takeout_food . And the ultimate in takeout may very well be The Town Waiter , operated by Rick and Meredith Solano . The Town Waiter offers a stable of drivers who will pick_up meals from selected restaurants around town and deliver them to your home ( provided you live_in Ventura , Oxnard , Port Hueneme or Camarillo. ) Though they are closed Christmas_Eve and Day , and New Year ' s Eve , they plan to be busy the rest of the season . &quot; People have already begun making Christmas plans and parties , &quot; Rick Solano said . &quot; They call and reserve a time , even though they don ' t know what they ' re having yet. &quot; One last suggestion : Suppose you are more_than happy to prepare all_the food yourself , or you manage to get guests to bring dishes . What about the cleanup ? Guests are more likely to race toward the front_door than toward the kitchen_sink . Heiliger , an instructor in Oxnard College ' s Hotel , Restaurant , Management program , suggests employing some of her students . &quot; They can do service and then clean_up , &quot; she said . LIGHTING DECOR You know those Christmas lights you shoved into a box several years ago and have never found the time to restring on the outside of the house ? would n ' t it be nice if they would magically attach themselves to the eaves ? Well , sorry , they won ' t . But there are people out there willing to do the hanging for you . They ' re called handymen , or painters , or anyone with the right tools and skills . Camarillo ' s Eric Kinsey has hung lights for friends and family in past years , but this season is extending the service to total strangers . &quot; Once word got_around , I realized how great the demand was , &quot; Kinsey said . &quot; I talked to people after last Christmas and they said , ' Yeah , we really wanted to hang lights but we didn ' t have the time. ' &quot; Kinsey said time really is the major obstacle . &quot; Most people pretty much have a set way of how they want their homes decorated , they just want someone to do_it , &quot; he said . But that doesn ' t mean Kinsey won ' t offer some decorating advice . Bill Hartman of Hartman Handyman Service in Ventura has been asked to hang lights on occasion . He said it ' s usually a last-minute thing , when people find they ' ve run_out of time to do_it themselves . He ' s also been asked to pick_up and haul_away Christmas_trees , and even put_together those daunting gifts that require assembly . &quot; I once got a call_on Christmas_Day , &quot; he said , &quot; to put_together a dollhouse. &quot; So there you have it . There ' s no need to worry about time as long as you have a little extra money to pay someone to work for you . That , or some very close friends who will pitch_in for free . Now you can breathe easier , right ? Take a deep breath . Tick . Tick . Tick . 10 Ways to Save Time Here are 10 tips to help you save time over the hectic holidays , as offered_up by local experts : * Instead of preparing all_the food for your holiday dinner_party , make_it a potluck . * If you don ' t want to have a potluck , have the dinner catered , or suggest instead that everyone go_to a restaurant . * Buy gifts for a select group of friends and family , not everyone you ' ve ever met . * Or consider drawing names out of a hat , especially if you have a large family . Buy a gift only for the person whose name you pulled . * Hire a personal shopper . * Hire a personal gift wrapper . * Get a handyman to put_up the Christmas lights . * Pay someone to haul the Christmas_tree from the farm to your front_door . If selecting a tree is too_much of a tradition to tamper with , at least hire someone to dispose_of the tree after the holidays . * If you end_up with one of those hard-to-assemble gifts , contact the neighborhood handyman for some help , rather than fuss over it for hours . * Get_out of town .
