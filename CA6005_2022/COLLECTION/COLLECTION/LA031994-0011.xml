   <HEADLINE> MARINES PIN BARS ON MAN THEY DISMISSED ; CIVIL RIGHTS : AFTER A 5-YEAR LEGAL BATTLE OVER RACIAL DISCRIMINATION , BRUCE YAMASHITA IS COMMISSIONED A CAPTAIN IN THE CORPS RESERVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bruce I . Yamashita finally was commissioned as a captain in the Marine Corps reserve Friday , five years after he was dismissed from the corps ' officers candidate school in what has become a major civil_rights case for Asian-Americans . Yamashita , 38 , a third-generation American whose grandparents came_to Hawaii a century ago , was subjected_to racial taunts and epithets throughout a 10-week course in 1989 , then kicked_out two days before graduation on grounds that he had exhibited &quot; leadership failure. &quot; Now an attorney in Washington , Yamashita waged a five-year legal battle against the Marine Corps that ultimately resulted in a high-level apology , an overhaul in Marine Corps officer-training procedures and the offer of a commission , albeit in the reserves . On Friday , a green uniformed Yamashita -- sporting a Marine Corps-style crew_cut and straining to hold_back his emotions -- took his oath as an officer and beamed as his captain ' s bars were pinned on by retired Marine Maj . Ernest Kimoto , his co-counsel in the case . &quot; For five years now , I have thought_about this moment , &quot; Yamashita told a crowd of relatives and well-wishers in the flag-bedecked House Armed Services Committee hearing room on Capitol_Hill . &quot; It means much more to me now than ever I could have imagined five years ago. &quot; The commissioning , which lasted only a_few minutes , had all_the trappings of a celebration , as lawmakers and civil_rights advocates -- many of them from Hawaii and wearing ceremonial leis made of maile vine to mark the occasion -- praised Yamashita for taking his stand . &quot; His commissioning today is a tribute to his dedication , a tribute to his courage , &quot; said Rep . Norman Y . Mineta ( D-San Jose ) , a prominent Japanese-American lawmaker and one of several members of Congress who supported Yamashita when he was waging his fight . Conspicuously absent were representatives of the Marine Corps . Aside from Yamashita and Marine Capt . Peter Keating , the Washington-area recruiting officer who administered the oath , the only green-uniformed attendee was a spokesman from the public affairs office . Sponsors of the commissioning ceremony said that Yamashita had invited Gen . Carl E . Mundy Jr. , commandant of the Marine Corps , but that Mundy ultimately declined , citing conflicts in scheduling . For his part , Yamashita was a model of restraint , reiterating that he had fought his battle for &quot; the principle &quot; and urging Navy and Marine Corps officials to do more to make_sure that the abuses he suffered would not happen again . Technically , Yamashita has the right to apply for a transfer to active-duty status but he made clear Friday that he probably would remain in civilian life . &quot; I just want to savor today , &quot; he told reporters before the ceremony . One poignant moment came_after several spokesmen of Japanese-American organizations pronounced Yamashita ' s last_name the traditional Japanese way -- ya-mash-ta -- even though his own family prefers the more-Americanized pronunciation , ya-ma-SHI-ta . The disparity finally was resolved -- with grace -- by Sen . Daniel K . Akaka ( D-Hawaii ) . &quot; You ' ve heard it mentioned as ya-mash-ta , &quot; Akaka said , chuckling over the growing dispute . &quot; Well , in Hawaii , we say ya-ma-SHI-ta . &quot; Yamashita ' s ordeal in OCS now is history . On the first day of class , one staff_sergeant told him : &quot; We don ' t want your kind around here -- go_back to your country ! &quot; Another suggested that he join the Japanese army . And he was routinely called Toyota and Honda . Backed by the Japanese-American Citizens ' League , Yamashita gathered evidence showing that between 1982 and 1990 , the officers ' course had shown &quot; a pattern of discrimination &quot; against minorities , who were being dismissed at a far-higher rate than white officer candidates . After two separate investigations -- and rejections by high-level Navy review boards -- Yamashita eventually was offered a commission as a second_lieutenant . He turned it down on grounds that it did not reflect the time he had lost while appealing the case . Earlier this year , Navy_Secretary John H . Dalton and Assistant Secretary_of_the_Navy Frederick F . Y . Pang ordered another review , and the Marines finally offered Yamashita a commission as a captain in the reserves .</TEXT>
