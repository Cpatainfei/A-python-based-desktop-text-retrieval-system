   <HEADLINE> S . KOREA RULING PARTY RAMRODS PREMIER ' S RATIFICATION ; ASIA : OPPONENTS BOYCOTT VOTE . THEY HINGED COOPERATION ON PRESIDENT ' S OK OF A CORRUPTION PROBE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> South_Korea ' s ruling party forced through the appointment of new Prime_Minister Lee Yung Duk on Friday after opposition forces boycotted the vote amid mounting criticism that the Kim Young Sam administration is increasingly authoritarian . The opposition Democratic Party had refused to ratify the Lee appointment unless Kim agreed to launch an investigation into allegations that illegal campaign contributions from a construction firm were funneled to his 1992 presidential campaign . But after a week of political paralysis , the two sides failed to agree on terms of the investigation -- including who should be called as witnesses . That left the ruling Democratic Liberal_Party to ram through the appointment on the last_day of the National Assembly session . According to Korean press reports , Kim was impatient with the impasse and believed that he could not waste any more time with looming problems such_as North_Korea ' s nuclear threat and mounting market-access demands . With local elections scheduled for next year , Kim reportedly believes that he has only this year to complete his programs before he becomes a lame_duck . Still , the political confrontation has fueled criticism that Kim , the nation ' s first civilian president after three decades of military dictatorship , is losing his moral authority as a reformist figure . Besides the allegations of dirty campaign money was Kim ' s firing last week of the highly popular prime_minister , Lee Hoi Chang , for challenging presidential authority . Lee , a former Supreme Court justice nicknamed &quot; Bamboo &quot; for his incorruptible adherence to principles , had opposed Kim ' s order to form a committee on unification and national security issues under the president ' s direct supervision . Kim hoped such a committee would cut_down on his administration ' s disarray and discord over North_Korea policy , but Lee objected to being cut_out of the loop and balked at implementing the order . Kim , outraged by what he reportedly viewed_as a close ally ' s personal betrayal , fired him -- and was roundly criticized . &quot; Surely , Kim ' s rash and intolerant dismissal of the popular prime_minister has dealt a heavy blow to a prestige and popularity that had been enhanced by his ambitious reform drive , &quot; the Korea Times said in an editorial this week . Chang Dal Joong , a political_science professor at Seoul National University , said many intellectuals have defected from Kim , whom they initially welcomed as the leader who would usher South_Korea into a new era of civilian democracy . But in the last year , he said , Kim has backed_off from campaign promises to reform business conglomerates , known as chaebols , and has begun to bring_back many of the old faces of the former military governments . Despite his high-profile campaign against corruption , allegations of scandals involving him or his close aides are popping_up regularly . The opposition charges that a construction company diverted millions of dollars into Kim ' s 1992 presidential election fund from profits gained from a project to relocate the Sangmudae military base from downtown Kwangju to the city ' s outskirts . The leader of an herb dealer group has said he secretly gave $ 150 # 000 in lobbying funds to Kim ' s son , Kim Hyon Chol , which were later siphoned into the presidential election campaign . Kim ' s son has denied the charges and filed a libel suit against the herb dealer . Two of Kim ' s close allies , the mayor of Inchon and the governor of north Chungchong province , were recently caught distributing gifts in violation of election laws . And Kim ' s Home Affairs Ministry is under_attack for official negligence and abuse of power for failing to stop ruffians from attacking Buddhist monks protesting corruption against their leader last month . The monks filed a complaint Friday with the Seoul district prosecutor ' s office . &quot; Kim ' s popularity seems to be facing a serious challenge from now on , &quot; Chang said . &quot; The moral basis of his reform politics seems destroyed quite a bit. &quot; Ruling party spokesman Ha Soon Bong blamed an internal power struggle between opposition leaders Kim Dae Jung and Lee Ki Taek for prolonging the nation ' s political paralysis . As a power_play to show who was tougher , they ended_up making what they knew were unreasonable demands -- for instance , to call President Kim as a witness in the Sangmudae scandal -- leading to the impasse , he said . Lee , the new prime_minister , is regarded_as a specialist in North-South issues . Appointed deputy prime_minister and unification minister last year , Lee was chief negotiator in the Red Cross-sponsored talks_over family reunification in the 1970s . A Pyongyang native , he also served as dean of Myong Ji University . He is considered conservative , although he has said he dislikes that term . He is not expected to show the same independence as his predecessor . A political cartoon this week portrayed him prostrating himself before Kim .</TEXT>
