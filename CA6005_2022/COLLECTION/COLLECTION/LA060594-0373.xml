   <HEADLINE> BORDER CROSSING ; UNHINDERED INTERSTATE BANKING IS ABOUT TO ARRIVE . FOR THE FIRST TIME , ACCOUNTS WILL FOLLOW CONSUMERS ACROSS STATE_LINES . AND MEGA-BANKS ARE SURE TO GROW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The banking world of tomorrow is going_to be one vast national forest where some big lenders will range at will across state borders , chewing_up local competitors , while others aggressively defend their turf . And like speedy ferrets , hundreds of the leanest independent banks will continue to thrive -- on the lookout , as always , for entrepreneurs who want to do lunch and arrange a quick line_of_credit . This is what the financial landscape should look_like in 1997 , when the last barriers to interstate banking are likely to fall , flattened by the growth of big banking empires , modern computer communications and the diminished political clout of small banks . The revolution will be completed by a historic piece of legislation virtually certain to be approved by Congress later this year as it rushes to catch_up_with the modern realities of the financial world and to put an end to a piecemeal system more suited to a time without interstate highways , computers or automatic_teller_machines . What happens on Capitol_Hill is often an &quot; earthquake phenomenon , &quot; explained Washington banking consultant Edward Furash . &quot; For a long_time nothing seems to be happening , and suddenly something does . Then people understand there were tremors building_up for a long time. &quot; Indeed , banking has changed more in the past 15 years than at any time since the Depression : Mega-banks sprang_up and moved across state_lines , while about 2 # 700 banks and thrifts disappeared . Consolidating those trends , the interstate banking bill -- which awaits the approval of a House-Senate conference committee and would be implemented in phases within three years -- promises common-sense conveniences and alluring new business opportunities for consumers and lenders alike . Among them : * Customers will be able to do business with their bank across state_lines -- making deposits , writing checks and borrowing money without regard_to borders . They shouldn ' t have to open a new account whenever they move to take a new job , go_on a long vacation or buy a retirement home . * All 50 states will be wide open for acquisitions . Any bank will be able to venture into a state to buy any other bank . * Banks that already operate in more_than one state -- but with separate corporate structures in each and computers that can ' t communicate -- will be able to convert all operations into branches of the parent bank . The industry savings could total in the billions of dollars . In 1980 , there were just 16 interstate bank holding companies , with just $ 85 billion in assets . In 1994 , there are approximately 190 holding companies operating in multiple states , with an estimated $ 2.5 trillion in assets -- about two-thirds of all commercial_bank assets , according to James Barth , professor of finance at Auburn University . Meanwhile , the assets held by independent banks shrank_from $ 405 billion in 1980 to $ 215 billion last year . What happened ? A consolidation began in_earnest during the early 1980s , when Congress allowed banks and thrifts to acquire failing financial_institutions in other states . Healthy firms bought the industry casualties -- with generous financial help from the federal deposit insurance funds . In other cases , sound lenders eager to expand persuaded state legislatures to allow reciprocal entry with other states . The results were the so-called regional compacts , in which states opened their banking markets to their neighbors . But the wave of consolidation , while it brought more total assets to the growing banks , did not make life easier for customers . While a banker ' s name and logo may have crossed state borders , convenience didn ' t travel with it . There are , for example , 60 million Americans living and working in metropolitan areas that span state_lines . These consumers are unable to follow their banks across the geographical boundaries for something so simple as making a deposit or cashing a check . Thus Chase Manhattan customers who bank in Greenwich , Conn. , but work in New York City cannot walk into Chase offices in New York to make their deposits , because the Chase banks in the two states are separate entities . This system &quot; doesn ' t make any sense , &quot; said Rep . Stephen L . Neal ( D-N.C. ) , chairman of the financial_institutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee . &quot; It would be as if Sears in each state had a separate board of directors , separate operating systems , separate computers and credit cards. &quot; Each house of Congress has adopted its own version of legislation that would tear the barriers down . Once you had an account , it could go everywhere your bank operates . &quot; You can keep your same checking and savings accounts when you move from Bakersfield to Phoenix or Phoenix to Sacramento , &quot; said Luke Helms , vice_chairman of BankAmerica , which is forced to run separate banking systems in 10 different states . Once Congress acts , there should be no more angry customers like Debra Kilpatrick of Richmond , Va. , who told a Senate hearing last year about a vacation gone awry because of the arcane rules that govern banking . Kilpatrick said she didn ' t have time to deposit a mutual_fund check at her local NationsBank branch in Virginia before heading south to North Carolina for a holiday . &quot; Imagine my consternation , &quot; she told the lawmakers , &quot; when the bank in North Carolina told me that because of interstate banking regulations , I was unable to deposit my check . . . in my own bank_account because my account was a Virginia account and I was trying to deposit it in North Carolina. &quot; It is anybody ' s guess which lenders will become the interstate aggressors when the barriers come_down . As many states began opening their doors over the last 15 years , the conventional wisdom was that a handful of gigantic money-center banks would be the ones to &quot; watch and fear , &quot; Federal_Reserve_Board member Susan M . Phillips told a recent banking conference . Instead , she noted , local banks grew_into super-regionals and leapfrogged across the country . &quot; Who expanded ? &quot; said Phillips . &quot; It ' s been the banks from Charlotte , N.C. ; Columbus , Ohio ; Providence , R.I. , and Minneapolis , Minn. &quot; Phillips was referring to NationsBank Corp. , Banc One Corp. , Fleet Financial Group Inc. and Norwest Corp. , each of which grew from a comparatively minor local bank into the ranks of the nation ' s 15 biggest bank holding companies . These super-regional competitors might head right for California once the barriers are down completely , according to Julius Loeser , senior_vice_president for government relations at First Interstate Bancorp , the Los Angeles-based parent of a pioneer multi-state banking web . &quot; California is a very attractive market , &quot; Loeser said . &quot; We have hundreds of small , inexpensive banks that could be bought fairly easily. &quot; But California and the other Far Western states may prove a tough region for outsiders to penetrate . &quot; There are still some advantages to markets similar to the ones you operate in , &quot; said Fred Furlong , vice_president for banking and regional studies at the Federal_Reserve_Bank of San Francisco . &quot; Phoenix is more like Los Angeles than New York. &quot; Three of the nation ' s top 15 bank holding companies are based in California -- Bank of America Corp. , First Interstate Bancorp , and Wells Fargo &amp; Co . -- and all three are concentrating_on deepening and developing the markets where they already do business . &quot; Our plate is kind of full right now , &quot; said Bank of America ' s Helms . &quot; We are in states with terrific growth opportunities &quot; -- among them California , Nevada , Washington and Texas . If somebody wants to grab a piece of Bank of America ' s business , he said , &quot; they ' re going to have to work pretty hard to take it away from us. &quot; At Chase Manhattan ' s headquarters in New York , the regional outlook is much the same . &quot; We view ourselves as having a corridor of business running from Boston to the metropolitan Washington area , &quot; said John Hanley , vice_president for government relations . The pending legislation would not have been possible without the grudging acceptance of independent bankers , who traditionally have wielded substantial political power and long have feared the arrival of big rivals in their local communities . The gradual opening of markets , combined with a new Democratic Administration in the White_House , convinced them that sustaining their opposition would be futile . &quot; The fight has gone_out of it at the state level , &quot; said Ken Guenther , executive_director of the Independent Bankers Assn . of America . &quot; If there are only 10 states that do not already have their doors open fully , that means you have only 20 senators to fight on your side . The rest don ' t care. &quot; And , said Guenther , &quot; President Clinton wanted the bill very strongly. &quot; Clinton , he noted , sat in the private box of Hugh McColl , hard-charging chairman of NationsBank , at the NCAA basketball championship this year in Charlotte . McColl was an early and enthusiastic backer of Clinton ' s run_for the presidency . For NationsBank , meanwhile , the consolidation of separate state units could mean savings of an estimated $ 50 million or more per year . In backing interstate banking legislation , the White_House insisted on a so-called &quot; clean bill &quot; -- one stripped of many of the things that consumer groups wanted : special attention to the credit needs of poor and minority neighborhoods , for example , and assurances that banks would n ' t wipe_out branches in all but the most affluent sections . &quot; We were steamrollered , &quot; said Michelle Meier , lobbyist for Consumers Union . No matter how much the giant banks grow through interstate expansion , many independent bankers are confident they will keep their profitable niche of dealing with up-and-coming manufacturers , distributors and vendors , as well as wealthy professionals . For these customers , the &quot; personal financial situation is intertwined with their business , &quot; said George H . Benter Jr. , president and chief operating officer of City National_Bank in Beverly Hills . Such clients might need rapid approval for a loan to make a corporate acquisition or advice about some personal investments . Or they might just want to have lunch with the bank president to talk_about where interest_rates are going . At another independent , Marathon National in Los Angeles , president Chip Morrow figures that &quot; a boutique bank like ours serves 3 % or 4 % of the population -- people who want individual service and the ability to talk to the president. &quot; Morrow believes he can live peacefully in the new forest of banking , getting enough to eat without being trampled by the giants . And if one of the big companies makes him a financial offer he can ' t refuse -- in the form of a generous proposal to buy the bank -- that ' s not so bad , either . &quot; that ' s the nature of the beast , &quot; said Morrow . &quot; Anyone running a business hopes one day to retire when someone offers a humongous amount_of_money to buy you out. &quot; Border Crossing Over the last decade , the nation ' s biggest banking_companies have broken free_of the bonds that tied them to their home states , spreading across state borders even without congressional authorization of interstate banking . Of today ' s top 15 bank holding companies , ranked here by total assets , only two -- Los Angeles-based First Interstate and Minneapolis-based Norwest -- operated in more_than one state in 1980 . In 1994 , only one -- San Francisco-based Wells Fargo -- limits its operations to a single state . 1 .

The March to Interstate Banking The obstacles to bank expansion have fallen , bit by bit , over the past 70 years : 1927 McFadden Act : Allows nationally-chartered banks to branch within their communities , if state-chartered banks are allowed to have multiple branches . Banks barred from branching outside their home states . 1933 Banking Act : Allows federally-chartered banks to locate statewide in states where state-chartered banks are permitted to branch . 1975 : First interstate banking law . Maine says a holding company based in another state can acquire a Maine bank , if that state allots similar privileges to Maine banks . 1982 Garn-St . Germain Act : Permits acquisition of a large , failing savings and loan association ( with assets of $ 500 million or more ) in one state by a bank from another state , regardless of state laws . 1983 : First regional compact . New England states allow reciprocal interstate banking . 1985-1992 : Wave of bank and thrift failures . Encouraged by federal regulators , healthy banks and thrifts spread across the country , acquiring ailing or insolvent institutions . 1994 : House and Senate pass separate bills opening all states to interstate banking . Final version expected to be adopted and signed by President Clinton later this year . Source : Furash &amp; Co , Times staff reports</TEXT>
