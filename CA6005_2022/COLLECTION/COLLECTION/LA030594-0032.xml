   <HEADLINE> ROSE FIRM AIDES SHREDDED FOSTER PAPERS ; PROBE : COURIER SAYS HE , ROOMMATE WERE TOLD TO DESTROY ITEMS . LAWYERS SAY DOCUMENTS WERE UNRELATED TO WHITEWATER INQUIRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A courier employed by the Rose Law_Firm acknowledged Friday that he shredded documents belonging_to late White_House counsel Vincent Foster in January , a_few weeks before the firm received a broadly worded subpoena for documents from Whitewater special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . Clayton Lindsey , 19 , of Little_Rock , told The Times that both he and his roommate , Jeremy Hedges , also a courier at the law_firm , were instructed to destroy the papers . He declined to describe the contents of the documents but said they could have been internal materials , as spokesmen for the firm have suggested , rather than files related to the Whitewater controversy . Lindsey testified about the shredding to a federal grand_jury on Feb . 16 . His and Hedges ' testimony apparently led Fiske to issue the subpoena to the law_firm . Lawyers at the firm , where Foster practiced law before January , 1993 , along with now-First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and two current Administration officials , do not deny that some documents belonging_to Foster were shredded , but they have maintained that they never destroyed any materials that might be pertinent to Fiske ' s investigation . Reports of the shredding , which first appeared in the Washington Times and the New York Times , added_to the many difficulties that the law_firm -- reputed to be the oldest west of the Mississippi_River -- has encountered since it came under scrutiny as a result of its involvement in the Whitewater controversy . In the last few weeks , the firm ' s lawyers have been forced to respond to allegations of conflict_of_interest , overbilling and destroying evidence . Fiske is looking_into allegations that President Clinton may have benefited improperly from his association with James B . McDougal , owner of a failed savings and loan and partner with the Clintons in a real_estate development firm known as Whitewater Development Corp . Although the inquiry centers_on Whitewater , Fiske is also investigating the apparent suicide of Foster last summer . His investigation also is looking_at the role played by Hillary Clinton and her firm in representing Whitewater and McDougal ' s Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan . In response to the couriers ' story , a spokesman for the law_firm has acknowledged that some files belonging_to Foster were found earlier this year when one lawyer was moving to a new office . He said those documents were discarded because they were nothing more_than &quot; internal Rose firm materials , &quot; such_as notes of committee_meetings . Lindsey , a college_student who works part time at the law_firm , said the documents he and Hedges shredded were plainly marked as belonging_to Foster . After the couriers testified , Fiske sent a subpoena to the firm warning against the shredding or destruction of documents . At the time , the subpoena was characterized by Rose lawyers as &quot; extremely broadly worded , &quot; but it is not known if discarded committee_meeting notes and other internal documents would have been covered . On Friday , Fiske declined to discuss the subpoena . A special grand_jury is expected to be impaneled later this month to begin hearing testimony in the Whitewater matter . The couriers appeared before a regular grand_jury , which sat three days last month to hear a variety of preliminary matters related to Whitewater . In interviews with The Times over the last month , several Rose Law_Firm partners have strongly denied reports that the firm ever shredded any documents related to Whitewater , which would be a criminal act . Even before the subpoena was received , the firm ' s lawyers were ethically bound to preserve evidence . &quot; You think if we were going_to shred some documents from Madison and Whitewater , we would call_in some clerks and say : ' Here , we are going_to shred Whitewater documents ? ' &quot; asked Alan Bird , who represents the firm in Washington . &quot; And do you think we would do_it in the middle of the day ? &quot; Many law_firms routinely destroy confidential documents that are no longer needed . According to Rose partners , their firm did not own a shredder until 1992 , when one was purchased in response to indications that news reporters covering the Clinton presidential campaign were foraging through the firm ' s trash . Lindsey said he and Hedges testified before the grand_jury with the knowledge and approval of their employer , but they hired a lawyer from another firm to accompany them into the grand_jury room . He said his testimony has done nothing to undermine his employment at the firm , where he runs errands and does other tasks . Hedges was working_at the firm on Friday and could not be reached . Times staff writer James Risen contributed to this story from Washington .</TEXT>
