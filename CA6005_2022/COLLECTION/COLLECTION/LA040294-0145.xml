   <HEADLINE> PEOPLE DISCRIMINATE , BUT AIDS DOES NOT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is in response to Sharon Biggers ' March 26 letter regarding Tom Hanks ' Oscar speech . It seems she believes that the entire AIDS epidemic has contained itself within the entertainment and artistic community and that she , as part of the rest of the nation , should not be made to feel guilty or responsible_for these individuals since it was their choices that led to the contraction of the disease . She went as far as equating AIDS to smoke-induced lung_cancer or a drug overdose . Let ' s put aside the fact that AIDS is the No . 3 cause of death in babies , or that the fastest growing risk group seems to be young adults from 12-17 who are experimenting with drugs and sex -- most while still under the care and tutelage of their parents . Let ' s forget the fact that the AIDS epidemic is spreading as quickly in women as it is in men and that every sexual partner you and your spouse-lover has had in the past 10 years can affect your life . Let ' s even scoff at the idea that a large and constantly growing number of doctors are saying that homosexuality is genetically predetermined . Let ' s focus_on the fact that this strong and compelling movie ( &quot; Philadelphia &quot; ) was made to help open the public ' s eye to the way AIDS is dealt with in society today . Not only with the victims , their families and loved ones , but with the people they come_in contact with daily . The movie shows the bigotry and ignorance they face , the pain , humiliation and fear they experience and the courage they possess when the disease wreaks havoc through the fragile thing we call a body . I can only hope that Ms . Biggers will open her mind a bit and read about a disease she obviously knows little about . I know information is available -- even in Orange County . Or better yet , maybe she could push herself away from her table of self-righteousness and visit an AIDS ward or hospice . Maybe she can find the compassion she seems to have lost behind the face of a 5-month-old baby whose body is racked with convulsions . She can counsel the mother of the 13-year-old with the fact that it was a predominantly behavior-related disease that killed her child . And as the man in the chair next to her mourns over pictures of his lover when he was a robust 180 pounds , instead of the 70 pounds he is now , maybe she can ask him what part of the entertainment_industry he ' s in . Yes , Ms . Biggers , the entire nation should feel responsible -- if for nothing else than to teach our children that bigotry and ignorance are not acceptable in any form . And guilty for the fact that by our careless words , not their actions , we make people ashamed of who and what they are . So , if you are concerned with the fact that the heavens are crowded with &quot; angels &quot; who have been lost to this deadly disease -- console yourself with the fact that the judgmental are rarely admitted .
