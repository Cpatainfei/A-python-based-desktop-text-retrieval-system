   <HEADLINE> A GRAMMAR QUESTION ? THIS TEACHER IS AT YOUR BECK AND CALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Millions of people out there carry the private shame of the grammatically challenged . Short-shrifted by their public_schools or simply baffled by their mother_tongue , they suffer the torment and occasional public embarrassment of poor spelling , bad syntax and awful punctuation . But in those moments of deepest despair -- when they are stumped trying to get pronouns to agree with antecedents or divine the difference between affect and effect -- one Michael Strumpf and his Grammar Hotline are there to help . &quot; Hello , Syracuse , &quot; Strumpf says into the phone after the caller identifies herself as Mary , a former schoolteacher in that city . &quot; No , no , it ' s nothing to be embarrassed about . Go_ahead and read me the sentence. &quot; And so it goes . Strumpf sets the woman straight , bids her farewell and goes_on to his regular work grading English papers at Moorpark College . Piled high on his desk are essays from about 100 students assigned to his three introductory writing classes . Each student will write seven essays over the semester , and Strumpf will go_over the essays with each student one-on-one . The workload grows even greater as he demands that the papers be rewritten when they don ' t measure_up . &quot; They have to explain every comma , &quot; he said . Along with the hundreds of essays he grades every semester , Strumpf , 60 , answers about 300 calls a week from all_over the country on the 20-year-old hot_line . After a recent article circulated nationwide about his service , calls poured in . &quot; Unbelievable ! We ' ve had 317 calls today , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s an epidemic of calls -- Monitor Radio , the Canadian Broadcast System , CBS Radio , KNX , the Boston Herald , &quot; he said . &quot; And you know the one question they all asked me : ' How much do you get paid ? ' They can ' t believe anyone would do this for free . But that ' s the reason we ' re alive , right ? -- to help other people. &quot; It ' s not just about helping other people , though . Strumpf , a self-styled guru of grammar , is_on a mission to rid the United States of sentences slovenly strewn together with a careless disregard for proper English . * He sees this as a national issue . He dreams of a Literacy Corps -- an organization modeled after the Peace Corps whose volunteers would answer questions of grammar and punctuation for any American who cared to inquire . &quot; Don ' t get me wrong , &quot; he said . &quot; America is the greatest country in the world . But I travel_to other countries , and people there are speaking and writing properly . Why can ' t we ? &quot; For Strumpf , bad grammar is one more symptom of the societal decay he sees demonstrated by increased crime , drug use , political corruption and the decline of the family . Strumpf faults the public_school system for graduating_students who lack basic skills in their own language . And he has some radical ideas of how to reform things . &quot; Get_rid_of the boards_of_education , all_the administrators and the fat that doesn ' t have anything to do with teaching kids , &quot; he said , launching into a short_list of quick_fixes for the country ' s schools . &quot; Start testing teachers -- make_sure they are professionals , &quot; he said . Get_rid_of tenure -- bad teachers hide behind it and good teachers don ' t need it . Start paying classroom teachers more -- they should be the second-most-important focus next to students. &quot; * Strumpf himself ended his quest_for a doctorate in English at USC just one year short of the degree . &quot; Ph.D. stands_for ' Piled Higher and Deep &quot; he said . A teacher for the past 38 years , Strumpf supplements his college work with tutoring and consulting for corporations . He has also worked as an expert witness in legal cases that hinge_on the grammatical interpretation of contracts . He swears he was an expert witness on a case that was decided on the implication of a single semicolon . He has also managed to write several nonfiction books and is working_on two novels and a play . He developed his devotion to language growing_up in New York City , learning Greek and Latin at school and the art of conversation at_home . His love for words and their usage can lead to sharp criticism of those who break the rules . He recently fired off a harsh missive to the Moorpark College newspaper , for example , after finding a page rife_with errors . Showing the offending page , he pointed_out a misspelling in a headline and the misuse of the word due . &quot; They can ' t spell do , &quot; he said in disbelief . &quot; This is college we ' re talking_about here. &quot; Strumpf does not fault the students . For him , the mistakes are another example of a failed educational system . &quot; If they can ' t teach these kids properly in 12 years , something is terribly wrong , &quot; he said . * On other fronts , he said , our language is constantly being ravaged by pop culture . He singles_out star athletes in particular , shaking his head at the damage he says they have wreaked upon English . He wants professional teams to require their players to attend a weekend seminar on proper grammar . &quot; A weekend would be enough , &quot; he said . &quot; Just give me a weekend. &quot; More and more students coming_into his classes_struggle with simple English expression , a problem his school shares with major universities , he said , adding that it ' s not all_the schools ' fault . Students &quot; are not dumber today . But they ' ve taken more punches to the head and they ' re having a hard_time standing_up , &quot; he said . So Strumpf does what he can . He has the hot_line that takes calls Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. And every Monday night at a local restaurant he hosts a meeting for any student struggling with grammar . &quot; I want them to know I ' m on their side , &quot; he said , &quot; but there are rules. &quot; He starts each of his college classes by shaking hands with all his students . &quot; We then have a sort of contract to get_down to work , &quot; he said . When he addresses a student , he will preface his or her name with &quot; Great , &quot; as in &quot; Great Mary , do you have a question ? &quot; And he likes to refer to his students as &quot; scholars in training. &quot; * Still , he is no pushover . He drops students who miss more_than five classes and regularly gives_out Ds and Fs . &quot; Students need to know there is a right and wrong , &quot; he said . &quot; They don ' t mind being told they ' ve done something wrong . They just need reasons . that ' s why people call the hot_line . They don ' t just want answers , they want to know why. &quot; The people who call range from executives and journalists to parents and teachers . Strumpf ' s message for those trying to remember lessons from long-ago English_classes is simple . &quot; I can help , &quot; he said . &quot; All you have to do is call. &quot; FYI Call the Grammar Hotline at ( 805 ) 378-1494 on weekdays between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. Moorpark College professor Michael Strumpf will respond at no charge .</TEXT>
