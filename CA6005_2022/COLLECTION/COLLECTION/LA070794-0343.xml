   <HEADLINE> U.S. , FOREIGN NEW-CAR SALES REMAIN ROBUST ; AUTOS : THE STRONG DEMAND IS EXPECTED INTO 1995 . LOCAL IMPORTERS REPORT DRAMATIC SURGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The big auto_makers of Detroit and Japan on Wednesday reported robust new-car sales in the United States for the first_half of the year -- a trend that is expected to continue into 1995 . And while sales were strong for the giant car_companies , sales figures have practically skyrocketed for the automotive importers based in Orange County , who make_up the so-called second tier of Asian auto_companies in this country . Led by Cypress-based Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America -- with a 34 % sales hike -- four members of the quintet reported that their combined six-month sales through June 30 were up 24 % from the same period in 1993 . Excluding Kia Motors North_America , which did not begin selling its Korean-built cars in the United States until February , the Orange County-based importers sold 394 # 653 cars and trucks in the first_half of the year . &quot; We ' re on a real roll this year , &quot; said Richard D . Recchia , chief operating officer of Mitsubishi Motor Sales . &quot; This is the sixth consecutive month our sales have been above 1993 levels. &quot; Referring to the overall sales gains by Japanese importers , Recchia said that &quot; reports of the death of the Japanese auto_makers in the U.S. because of the weak yen ( which boosts the price of_imports ) were premature . . . people forgot that we all sell a lot of cars that are built here in the U.S. &quot; Domestic auto_makers -- General Motors , Ford and Chrysler -- sold 5.74 million vehicles in the first_half of the year , a 9.1 % increase , and the major Japanese importers -- Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. and American Honda Motor Co. , both in Torrance , and Nissan Motor Corp . U.S.A. , in Carson -- sold a total of 1.3 million vehicles for an 11.3 % hike . Most European auto_makers also were reporting significant sales increases , although their numbers are comparatively small . Auto analysts expect total car , truck and minivan sales in the United States to hit 15.5 million this year , up from 14 million in 1993 . The buying binge comes from pent-up demand as most of the nation recovers from the recession . Sales in Southern California , where the economy remains sluggish , also have begun picking_up , but not at a pace that matches the national rate . The Orange County importers , ranked in_order of first-half sales , are : Mazda Motor of America Inc. , Irvine , 197 # 983 , up 24 % ; Mitsubishi , 119 # 560 , up 34 % ; Hyundai Motor America Inc. , Fountain Valley , 61 # 867 , up 9 % ; and American Suzuki Motor Corp. , Brea , 15 # 243 , up 26 % . Kia , also in Irvine , has sold 4 # 646 cars since it began U.S. sales five months ago . The company won ' t be a nationwide distributor until late 1995 or early 1996 . So far , Kia has 66 dealerships in 11 states .</TEXT>
