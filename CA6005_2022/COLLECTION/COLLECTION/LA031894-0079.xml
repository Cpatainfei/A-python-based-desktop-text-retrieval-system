   <HEADLINE> A SUPER-GIANT WAY TO BOW_OUT ; SKIING : OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST DIANN ROFFE-STEINROTTER WINS HER FIRST WORLD CUP SUPER-G IN HER FINAL INTERNATIONAL RACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a ski_racing farewell comparable_to Ted Williams ' final at-bat , the retiring Diann Roffe-Steinrotter went_deep Thursday , winning her first World Cup super-giant slalom in her last international race . Roffe-Steinrotter ' s upset at the World Cup_finals was nearly as improbable and emotional as her recent Olympic gold-medal victory in super-G had been . Nine years had passed since her only World Cup victory -- in a 1985 giant slalom at Lake Placid , N.Y. &quot; This is everything I ' ve dreamed about for nine years , &quot; she said . Because ski racing is not baseball , and final ski_runs don ' t rank in lore with final home_runs , the shelf_life of Roffe-Steinrotter ' s feat outside the ski industry figures to be short . Nevertheless , Roffe-Steinrotter ' s hands trembled in victory . When the 22nd and last racer crossed the finish , eliminating the chance of an upset of her upset , Roffe-Steinrotter extended her arms skyward and burst into tears . The 26-year-old from Potsdam , N.Y. , had not , as she had feared , bowed_out of her 11-year career with a middle-of-the-pack showing , leaving the naysayers to doubt the significance of a career punctuated with periodic bursts of brilliance , yet lacking in World Cup consistency . Instead , Roffe-Steinrotter seized the day with her winning run of 1 minute 24.93 seconds from the fourth starting position . Unlike in the Olympics , where she got a break when Germany ' s Katja Seizinger , the world ' s top super-G racer , crashed , Roffe-Steinrotter defeated Seizinger straight up_on the Vail course . Seizinger , skiing ninth , crossed 0.14 seconds slower . Admittedly , the German had more to lose , and skied tentatively to assure a finish and clinch the World Cup super-G title . Appropriately , Austria ' s Anita Wachter , who had shared with Roffe-Steinrotter the silver in giant slalom at the 1992 Albertville Olympics , finished third . Roffe-Steinrotter had announced her retirement at the Olympics , and that apparently helped soften Thursday ' s emotional blow for her . &quot; It ' s sad , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t want to stop , but I have to stop , because I said I was going_to stop. &quot; Would she reconsider ? &quot; No , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s 100 % . that ' s why I was crying. &quot; Her victory was similar to her gold-medal run at Lillehammer . There , she started first and sweated out the rest of the field . Here , she started fourth and did the same , first surviving Seizinger , then two Italians , Isolde Kostner , the Olympic super-G bronze medalist , and Bibiana Perez , ranked second in super-G . Both crashed . Then came Wachter , skiing 17th , who made a mad dash to beat Roffe-Steinrotter ' s time , only to fall . 16 short . Only then did the American nervously start accepting congratulations , not yet comprehending what she had done . &quot; Unbelievable , &quot; her husband , Willi , said in the finish corral . Who was going_to argue ? &quot; At Lillehammer , it was just hard work paying_off , sort of like back at you , guys , &quot; Diann said . &quot; This was just an emotional release . I said to myself , ' It ' s over . It ' s going_to end now. ' &quot; The Norwegians dominated the men ' s afternoon super-G , with Jan Einar Thorsen defeating teammate Lasse Kjus by . 44 . Hans Knaus of Austria finished third . American Tommy Moe , a pre-race favorite , skied sloppily but still finished a strong sixth . &quot; I knew I could win if I skied flawless , &quot; Moe said . &quot; But Thorsen won by almost a half second . I skied good . It was just a tough course . But I had a great season. &quot; With the victory , Thorsen leap-frogged over Moe , Austria ' s Guenther Mader and Luxembourg ' s Marc Girardelli to claim the men ' s super-G title . Girardelli blew a 69-point lead over Thorsen when he finished 10th . Thorsen , awarded 100 points for his victory , defeated Girardelli by five . &quot; I had a bad run_on the lower part , &quot; said Girardelli , who had won the World Cup downhill title Wednesday . &quot; I ' ll have to try next year again. &quot; World Cup Notes With his fourth-place finish in super-G , Norway ' s Kjetil Andre Aamodt clinched the overall men ' s title with two races remaining . It was the first overall title for the 22-year-old Aamodt , who finished second last year to five-time champion Marc Girardelli . &quot; It ' s the greatest title you can win in skiing , in my eyes , &quot; Aamodt said . Aamodt , who has supplanted Girardelli as &quot; the world ' s greatest skier , &quot; already has won five Olympic medals . Sweden ' s Pernilla Wiberg , injured in Wednesday ' s downhill , did not race Thursday , which virtually assures Switzerland ' s Vreni Schneider of the overall women ' s title.. . . Although Diann Roffe-Steinrotter ' s World Cup career ended Thursday , she plans to race in next week ' s U.S. Nationals at Winter Park , Colo . Switzerland ' s William Besse , the winner of Wednesday ' s downhill , tore a ligament in his left knee during a nasty fall during the super-G . . . . After a day_off today , the World Cup_finals resume Saturday with the giant slalom , followed by Sunday ' s slalom .</TEXT>
