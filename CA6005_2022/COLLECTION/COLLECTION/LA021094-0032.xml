   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / ARTHUR GERARD MELVILLE : MEXICO ' S REAL TERRORISTS BEAR THE FLAG ; CHIAPAS REPRESENTS ALL THOSE BETRAYED BY THEIR GOVERNMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Having had the experience of being arrested and jailed in Chiapas , having been turned_over to and mistreated by the Mexican army , and having been beaten and almost killed at the hands of the Mexican secret_police , I feel a need to speak about the rebellion taking_place there . The uprising of the indigenous people in Chiapas in no way surprises me . What does surprise me is that these people have for so_long endured their horrific condition , a result of purposeful neglect by the government and racist oppression by the large landowners . The brutal attempt by the Mexican government to suppress the uprising is also no surprise . Official corruption , white-collar crimes , fraudulent elections , incessant bribery , police brutality and drug-trafficking run rampant in Mexico . But when poor people stand_up for their dignity and human_rights , authoritative indignation in the form of official armed violence is the prompt response . My knowledge of Chiapas comes from having lived for six years in the mountains of Huehuetenango , Guatemala , where I was accustomed to ride my horse across the border into the towns of Chiapas to buy provisions . My experience of Chiapas was both wonderful and sad . Never in my life have I met a more loving and generous people than the Mexican campesinos . Those with only one meal were willing to share it . A stranger had a place to stay . But it was always sad to see how these same people suffered . Through my work as a Catholic priest among the peasants of Guatemala , I slowly realized that all legal means for attaining the rights of the poor had long been exhausted . After painstaking deliberation , I joined the Guatemalan Revolutionary Movement . I concluded that the movement was not violent per se , but was the only means left to the people for standing_up to the institutionalized violence of the government . And since the Catholic_Church had always sent its chaplains into the official armed conflicts of the wealthy , no matter how unjust the cause , I thought it appropriate that I , as a priest , should be part of a truly just armed conflict . Those who enter the first stages of a revolutionary movement are not suicidal . They generally are people who have little to lose except their lives , and willingly give of themselves in_order that their children and those that follow might have more . In conversations with the comandante of the Guatemalan movement ' s forces , a man who was to give his life , I learned of the commitment of people in taking the only dignified step left to them . When my participation in the movement was discovered , I was condemned by ecclesiastical and governmental authorities and expelled from Guatemala . I spent the next four months &quot; underground &quot; in Mexico , much of that time in Chiapas , again witnessing Mayan Indians living_in conditions similar to those of their people in Guatemala . One day , as I left San Cristobal de Las Casas , the focal_point of the present uprising of the Zapatistas , I was arrested by border police and jailed . I then had the brief privilege of existing at the level of the indigenous poor and of gaining further insight into their oppression . From the jail I was taken_to the army_base in Tuxtla Gutierrez , the state_capital , gaining additional insight into the plight of the poor who , forced into the military , are trained to fight against their own people . Turned_over to the secret_police , I was nearly murdered , saved only through the kindness and courage of a Mexican priest . The uprising in Mexico is an infant compared to the war that the Guatemalan government has been waging against its people and their revolutionary forces , now in its 33rd year . Many seers and American business investors say that the revolt in Mexico will be short-lived . I doubt it , having seen the capacity of the people . Since it is no longer politically correct to use the term communists for the revolutionaries of southern Mexico , with what despicable label will we insult the poor and oppressed who are now standing_up for their rights ? Terrorists seems to be the politically acceptable word . As the Mexican government claims that &quot; professional terrorists &quot; are leading the &quot; simple Indians , &quot; what then do we call the real professional terrorists of the Mexican government and military who order bombings of civilian populations and summary executions of peasants ? It is unfortunate that the original inhabitants of that beautiful land are forced to take_up the gun . Their present effort may be contained by the promoters of &quot; progress , &quot; but since &quot; free_trade &quot; is commonly known to be simply another step_in putting the interests of the wealthy over those of the poor , I feel sure that what is happening now in Chiapas is only the beginning .</TEXT>
