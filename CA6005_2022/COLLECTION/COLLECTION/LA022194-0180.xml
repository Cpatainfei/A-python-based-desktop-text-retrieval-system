   <HEADLINE> NEW FUND SEES INDUSTRY RESURGENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Ernest Mysogland has things figured_out right , you ' ll be hearing a lot more about the comeback of industrial America . Mysogland maintains that old-line U.S. smokestack companies like the Big Three auto_manufacturers have embarked_on more_than just a temporary upswing in their long-flagging fortunes . He has set_up the portfolio of the new mutual_fund he manages to try to benefit from their resurgence . &quot; Chicken Little was wrong . The sky is not falling , &quot; declares the 51-year-old Mysogland , echoing the sentiments of the bovine statuette labeled &quot; Ernie the Bull &quot; that sits beside his desk . Among the holdings of the NWNL Northstar Income and Growth Fund , which began operations in November and now has more_than $ 50 million in assets , are the stocks of the Big Three car_manufacturers . In a portfolio of 48 % stocks , 28 % bonds , 20 % convertible_securities and 4 % cash equivalents , General Motors represent the single biggest position . &quot; This epitomizes everything that is going well in the United States , &quot; Mysogland says . &quot; Instead of not being able to compete , we are clobbering Japan . We export more of our gross_domestic_product than Japan. &quot;</TEXT>
