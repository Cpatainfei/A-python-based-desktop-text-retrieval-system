   <HEADLINE> A HISTORY WORTH WORKING FOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A history free_of bias . That was the goal of Carter G . Woodson , an African American historian who in 1926 -- when this nation was racially divided by law and custom -- proposed devoting one week to celebrate and study black history and culture . In an effort to dispel stereotypes about black Americans , the Harvard-trained professor called_for selection of the second week in February because that week included the birthdays of two famous orators and abolitionists : Frederick Douglass , the black journalist , and Abraham_Lincoln , the president who freed the slaves . In 1976 , during the American Bicentennial celebration and 50 years after the first observance , Negro History Week was expanded to Black History Month . Since then February has become a time to annually acknowledge the accomplishments of black Americans . For many non-blacks it is the only time to formally remember the ravages of slavery , the shackles of Jim Crow and the legacy of discrimination . For too many , it is the lone opportunity to acknowledge the battles to overcome discrimination and all_the work that remains to be done . American history is the story of a rainbow of cultures and contributions . All should be included equally . Carter Woodson , an integrationist , envisioned a time when no separate celebration would be needed to call attention to the accomplishments of black Americans . His ultimate goal was an integrated history that reflected no bias . That remains a worthwhile objective .</TEXT>
