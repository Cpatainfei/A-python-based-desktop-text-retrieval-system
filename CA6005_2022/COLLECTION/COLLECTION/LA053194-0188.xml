   <HEADLINE> CLINTON SALUTES WAR DEAD , CALLS FOR VIGILANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the cusp of the 50th anniversary of D-day , President Clinton remembered America ' s war dead Monday as &quot; the backbone that secured our nation ' s liberty &quot; as thousands gathered at Arlington National Cemetery to pay homage to the fallen . Addressing a Memorial_Day throng of veterans , families and friends , Clinton said &quot; it was the independence and the can-do confidence of the sons and daughters of American and the other democracies that won the day &quot; on June 6 , 1944 , when Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of northern France and laid the foundation for Hitler ' s defeat . The President leaves Wednesday for an eight-day trip to Italy , France and Britain , his first visit to those countries since taking_office . A highlight will be ceremonies to commemorate D-day ' s golden anniversary . More_than 10 # 000 Allied soldiers were slain or wounded in the Normandy landing , which Clinton said started a battle that &quot; was not just between two armies . It was as clearly as any conflict in all_of human history a battle between two ways of life. &quot; Clinton said he mourned the suicide earlier this month of Lewis Puller Jr. , a disabled Vietnam_War veteran who wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning book after returning from the conflict . Puller was the son of the most decorated Marine in history . &quot; This morning when I got_up I thought_of Lew Puller and the countless other heroes he has joined and the terrible sacrifices men and women have been willing to make_for this great land , &quot; Clinton said . He laid a red , white and blue-flowered wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at the cemetery earlier in the day . The President also hosted a White_House breakfast for veterans , telling them the nation must be vigilant in fighting to uphold its freedoms . &quot; We owe our liberty and prosperity to the strength and valor of those who fought &quot; in World_War_II , he told the veterans . &quot; But we also inherit the responsibility of defending that gift. &quot; Clinton ' s Arlington Cemetery speech was greeted with warm applause from the 4 # 000 people packed into an open-air amphitheater . He ignored a lone heckler , who shouted &quot; Go_back to Oxford , you traitor , draft-dodger. &quot; Clinton ' s avoidance of the military draft while in college in the late 1960s brought harsh criticism from veterans during his 1992 presidential campaign , and last Memorial_Day -- his first as commander_in_chief -- he met with heckling and a cool reception when he spoke at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial . The President tried to comfort families of Vietnam soldiers still missing in action by underscoring &quot; our solemn obligation to find answers_for those whose loved ones served but were never accounted for. &quot; He urged parents to teach their children about World_War_II , offering as an example the story of a Missouri elementary_school librarian who brings D-day veterans and other war survivors to speak_to students every year . &quot; To honor , we must remember , &quot; he said . &quot; Today , somewhere in America , a curious child rummaging through an attic will stumble upon his grandfather ' s insignia patches , a pocket guide to France , a metal ' cricket , ' a black-and-white photo of a smiling young_man in uniform . But learning about those times and those deeds must be more_than accidental. &quot; Soldiers signaled with metal &quot; crickets &quot; to locate each other in the dark . Veterans of wars from World_War I to the Persian_Gulf_War knelt or laid flowers among the rows of white headstones that blanket the gentle green slopes of the cemetery . Soldiers from a nearby Army_base planted small American flags in the soil in front of each of the 250 # 000 graves last week . Among those attending the ceremony was Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , who was injured in combat in World_War_II . Afterward he signed autographs with his wife , Elizabeth , explaining that &quot; I come_out here every time I get a chance when I ' m not home. &quot; &quot; It ' s a very important day for all_the reasons everyone already knows , but it ' s also a time to think_about what a great country we live_in , &quot; he said . &quot; We think_about those who lost their lives and those who were wounded , but I think the sacrifice was worth it. &quot; * SOUTHLAND OBSERVANCES : The Southland observed the holiday with symbols of sacrifice and heroism .
