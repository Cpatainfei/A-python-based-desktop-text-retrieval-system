   <HEADLINE> KISSING THE 19TH CENTURY GOODBY ; WITH &quot; MARY SHELLEY ' S FRANKENSTEIN ' BEHIND HER , HELENA BONHAM CARTER VOWS TO GET AWAY FROM PERIOD MOVIES . BUT SHE ' S DONE SO WELL AS THE PRIM AND PROPER ENGLISH LADY . ( EXCEPT FOR THE STRIPPING THING. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Helena Bonham Carter , whose face one might think could save the_British film_industry if there were a British film_industry , is sitting on a bench somewhere inside the secret gardens of the Hotel Bel-Air , yes , having tea . But as you get closer , the picture of her is not exactly right -- or exactly Edwardian at least . The late-afternoon light rests softly on her rising cheekbones ; she is wearing a muted floral print dress that reaches down to her black socks and white canvas sneakers ; the beguiling pair of dark eyes and eyebrows are acutely familiar from her roles on screen as E.M. Forster heroines . But , but . . . two of her fingers are down inside that cup , poking_into the hot water , pinching the tea_bag to squeeze the essence of Twinings more to her liking . It is a practical method , but one nonetheless that would never go_with cucumber sandwiches . &quot; The English know how to make tea , but I ' m not a great tea drinker , &quot; she says . &quot; We don ' t have regular tea in the afternoon at home. &quot; Helena Bonham Carter would like to point_out , in fact , that she is not nearly so English or proper as some people assume after seeing her in &quot; A Room With a View , &quot; &quot; Howards End &quot; and &quot; Where Angels Fear to Tread , &quot; not to mention in Franco Zeffirelli ' s &quot; Hamlet , &quot; playing Ophelia to Mel Gibson ' s brooding prince . She has certainly done some_other un-Edwardian things , such_as play the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald in an American television movie , take_off her clothes as a working-class stripper in a British TV movie last year and , most recently , be cast as the wife of a New York sportswriter in Woody Allen ' s new film , which has started shooting in New York . Can this be true ? &quot; My brother got_married at the beginning of the month , &quot; she says , retracing her recent jet-lagged itinerary . &quot; I did the wedding , got totally drunk , then got_on a plane the next morning and then started filming on the Woody Allen ( movie ) on Monday , which was stupid. &quot; She says it was a nice wedding . &quot; Very nice wedding . Very nice . Very romantic . You need to relax sometimes. &quot; But relaxation is over and now she has taken_leave of the Allen set and flown into Los Angeles for the premiere of &quot; Mary Shelley ' s Frankenstein , &quot; director Kenneth Branagh ' s foray_into big-budget cinema for TriStar . She is the film ' s leading lady , Victor Frankenstein ' s adopted sister , Elizabeth , and the love of his life . Branagh himself plays Frankenstein and Robert De Niro the monster he creates in an attempt to cheat death . A story this morning in the Wall_Street Journal handicapping the fall movies has described her as an actress &quot; known only to the art-house crowd , &quot; a description she says suits her fine even though it was used against her in predicting the box-office potential for the picture . &quot; I ' m happy being an art-house person . I ' d much rather that than the reverse . I ' m not that famous , and frankly , I ' d like to keep the fame in a sort of limited amount. &quot; Such words always sound eerie , as if sure to be followed by a crack of thunder and a lightning bolt when uttered within cruising range of Morton ' s , and , as it happens , tend to carry an accent other_than American . &quot; Do you mind if I smoke a cigarette ? &quot; she asks her interviewer . &quot; I wonder if it ' s illegal ? &quot; * Regular tea drinker or not , Bonham Carter , who attended the exclusive Westminster school in London , then passed_up a university education to become an actress , comes from a prominent British political family . Her great-grandfather Herbert Henry Asquith was the last Liberal_Party prime_minister , the political_leader of Great Britain at the outbreak of World_War I . &quot; We ' re not that posh , though , &quot; she says . &quot; There ' s a misconception here that I ' m very aristocratic , which I ' m not . We have no country_house , we ' re not very blue-blooded . Another misconception about me is that I ' m terribly English . But my mother is French-Spanish , and , in fact , my looks take_after her , and yet ( the_British press ) have resolutely called me ' English rose , ' although I don ' t have the blue eyes and the blond hair . I ' m only 50 % Anglo-Saxon , but they ' ve been blinded by my name I guess . It sounds so English. &quot; She seemed the prime specimen of Edwardian nubility in the Merchant Ivory adaptations of Forster ' s &quot; A Room With a View , &quot; in which she played the repressed young_lady awakened to sex while on a holiday in Italy , and &quot; Howards End , &quot; in which she was Helen , the passionate sister driven to distraction by her concern for the unfortunate clerk put_out of work by the imperious Anthony Hopkins . But even these roles , she says , have been too quickly relegated in the movie press to limited status as period-piece decoration . &quot; Helen was absolutely bonkers , &quot; she says of her &quot; Howards End &quot; role . &quot; I loved her . She ' s off the wall and very up front and expressive , and yet people are determined to talk_about me as being in period costume drama playing repressed characters . Well , I don ' t think that ' s totally accurate. &quot; As Bonham Carter unloads these minor frustrations and sets the record straight , she does so with a minimum of anger or irritation . At 28 , she seems to have retained a capacity to be amused by the trials of show_business . She laughs easily , in a low rumble that can go_on for a sentence or two . About her role in the Woody Allen picture , she says , &quot; I have no idea what I ' m doing . It ' s contemporary , it ' s a romantic love_story , a comedy , and I ' m attempting to be American and contemporary -- indeed , I ' m attempting to be contemporary . &quot; Big laugh . &quot; I ' m his wife -- from Mrs . Frankenstein to Mrs . Allen. &quot; In &quot; Mary Shelley ' s Frankenstein , &quot; her feverish gentility gives_way to some bodice-ripping ardor in a role that Branagh and his screenwriters largely invented to add a romantic dimension to Shelley ' s original horror story . &quot; I wasn ' t actually that enthusiastic about playing this part to begin with because , for obvious reasons , it was another period role , &quot; she says . &quot; I ' ve done a_few too many period roles perhaps for my own good . At least in E.M. Forster they tend to be the central parts and they tend to be stronger than the men ' s roles . But with a Gothic horror story they tend to be passive and rather like the damsel-in-distress kind of part . They don ' t do the interesting things -- like make the monsters , you know. &quot; Branagh talked her into it by promising to make Elizabeth his equal . The director did this by reconceiving Elizabeth as more like Mary Shelley herself . &quot; The biggest part of the script development was bringing her on screen , &quot; Branagh says . &quot; This was a remarkable woman , who eloped at 16 with a married_man with two kids ; at 19 she had written this nightmarish tale , was married to a superstar ( poet Percy Bysshe Shelley ) ; she lost kids in childbirth , her mother died giving_birth to her ; she was haunted by all these images . And she was Percy Shelley ' s equal intellectually . &quot; So that was my idea , to bring Mary Shelley on board , have an equal partner who gives him an alternative to his obsession : work versus home , ambition versus love. &quot; Bonham Carter and Branagh met in 1988 when both took_part in a poetry reading on a boat floating down the Thames . She saw him again when she worked with Branagh ' s wife , Emma Thompson , who won an Oscar for playing her sister in &quot; Howards End. &quot; &quot; But we ' d never actually sat_down and had a proper conversation , we figured_out , &quot; the actress says . &quot; When I went_up for the interview ( for ' Frankenstein ' ) , it was all very , ' Oh , love your work ' and ' Yes , love yours , ' and that was it. &quot; Was it different working for a director who , unlike James Ivory , was also the leading man ? &quot; It certainly was because he ' s wearing funny clothes when he ' s giving you notes . And the first day or so I was a little paranoid that while acting opposite me , he ' s meanwhile taking_notes about my bad acting . But it got better . Now I ' m getting Ken one day and Woody another ; I ' m getting used to the director being the leading man. &quot; &quot; I ' ve always admired her , &quot; Branagh says , &quot; because she started right in the limelight . The idea of being in a movie like ' Room With a View ' when you ' re 18 , you know , and hanging_in there and getting better and not sort of being thrown by the whole_thing is indicative_of a very strong and resilient artist. &quot; Yet despite the international reputation she established in the decade since &quot; Room With a View , &quot; she apparently still was not a big enough star to make TriStar executives thrilled about Branagh ' s choice . &quot; I don ' t think they wanted an English actress , let alone me , because I was too sort of art-housey for them , &quot; she says . &quot; I think a bit of an argument went_on , but Ken got his way. &quot; On the phone from New York , Woody Allen recalls how he came_to cast her in his new movie . &quot; I had only seen her in passing in some of those Merchant Ivory films and someone suggested her to me , &quot; Allen says . &quot; The question was , of course , could she be contemporary ? I saw no reason why she couldn ' t , but I wasn ' t 100 % sure . But as soon as you meet her , you realize she is a totally contemporary person who ' s really been playing roles over the years . &quot; And when she ' s free to play who she actually is , when she ' s not bound in by corsets -- not that she hasn ' t done that great , she has -- but in fact , I think she ' s more potent , more interesting and more beautiful as a contemporary heroine . If I had known her then , she would have made a good character for ' Bullets Over Broadway. ' &quot; Bonham Carter has spent what she describes as a &quot; really minimal &quot; amount_of_time in Los Angeles , mainly for publicity purposes from time to time . &quot; I can ' t say that I know Los Angeles , &quot; she says inhaling a cigarette deeply and pondering the subject at_hand . &quot; I wonder if there ' s anything to know ? I sort of feel there ' s an empty center to it . It seems incredibly attractive and is very seductive given the weather and everything , although I don ' t think I could live_in a place that is quite so seasonless . And it is so completely different from where I come from , which is London. &quot; Back in London , she has attracted more_than a little curiosity over the fact that she still lives with her parents in the house she grew_up in . Her mother is a psychotherapist , her father a retired merchant banker . &quot; There ' s no great psychological thing to it , though people try to make_it into something more significant than it is . I mean , I just get_on_with them . My brothers moved_out , married , and I didn ' t . Also , I never went_to university or drama school , which is when most kids move_out . So it never really occurred to me . I always had a great amount of freedom and privacy -- and I move_around a lot . And they are exceptionally nice people. &quot; Still , this arrangement must propose a challenge for suitors ? &quot; Yes , &quot; she says , &quot; a bit . But once they meet them , they want to move_in . My parents are very liberal and deeply unshockable. &quot; The movie in which she played the &quot; strip-o-gram &quot; stripper , &quot; Dancing Queen &quot; ( which has not been seen in the United States ) , she insists is &quot; definitely one of the best things I ' ve ever done. &quot; &quot; But there ' s nothing salacious about it . I got_to be contemporary and working-class and took my clothes off -- for obvious reasons . A lovely script , very funny . The attitude is so different toward television in England . We have very good television , very good writers , maybe because we have no movie_industry . &quot; I did a strip to that ABBA song , ' Dancing Queen ' and ' Do You Want to Touch Me ? ' by Gary Glitter . Haven ' t you heard of Gary Glitter ? He ' s an icon of campdom . And it was a good thing to strip to . It went , ' Do you want to touch me ? There ? Where ? There ? Yeah. ' It was pretty direct . It got the point over . &quot; I had Velcro hearts stuck_in various strategic places that came_off . It was great fun to do , although I could never get my bra off . It was probably deeply psychosomatic , but it had to happen on the beat , and I thought it would be quite funny to have a ' strip-o-gram ' who couldn ' t get her clothes off . But the director , for some reason , thought it was less effective than achieving the full exposure . Not that you see that much . You have about two frames worth . And I only had to do the top . Because frankly the bottom would have taken me so_long . &quot; . . . I ' m not a sort of natural show-off type , I don ' t think , and I ' d prefer , frankly , to lose myself or hide behind a character . And if I ' m terrified , then that ' s what saves me . Because you ' re concealing yourself or you ' re bringing out another part of yourself that you don ' t show in your normal existence. &quot; In her normal existence , if it can be said that even art-house heroines have a normal existence , Bonham Carter listens to songs from Fred Astaire musicals , Cole Porter , Louis Armstrong . &quot; I ' m pretty un-hip . I ' m not a particular fan of rock_and_roll and certainly this acid , migraine-inducing monotonous thing that ' s going_on . I don ' t get_it . I ' ve got a bit of credibility with Eric Clapton . I ' ve been listening to Jacques Brel , but he ' s a bit for the suicide hour , I ' d say. &quot; Judy Davis has been her role_model since she saw her in &quot; My Brilliant Career , &quot; when she was 12 . &quot; That was my favorite film , &quot; she says . &quot; She ' s been a heroine of mine. &quot; The two finally acted together in the 1992 film of Forster ' s &quot; Where Angels Fear to Tread. &quot; &quot; Jennifer Jason Leigh is somebody I admire a lot because she ' s known for being different in her range of choices . That kind of sequence of roles I ' d love to have access to . Which I think is getting there bit by bit . If I play it right . . . . I ' m leaving the ingenue , girlie type and graduating into womanhood. &quot; And the fame thing she would like to keep at a comfortable distance . &quot; Somewhere this side , miles , light_years away from Julia Roberts , I think . And I think you can . The fame wasn ' t the thing that attracted me in the first place , and it ' s less attractive the more famous I seem to have got_over the years . &quot; It ' s true that people get trained in acting , but they don ' t get trained to deal with fame . And they may be great at taking_on other people ' s personalities , but their own personality could use a lot of work. &quot;</TEXT>
