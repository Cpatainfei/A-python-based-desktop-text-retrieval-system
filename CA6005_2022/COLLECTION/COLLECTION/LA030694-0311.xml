   <HEADLINE> ' POWER RANGERS ' SEEN AS UNRULY MODELS TO YOUTHS ; RESEARCH : CAL STATE FULLERTON STUDY CONCLUDES THAT CHILDREN EXPOSED TO TV HEROES ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE TOWARD COUNTERPARTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Allowing your children to watch &quot; Mighty Morphin Power Rangers &quot; can be dangerous to other children ' s health . That warning comes from Cal State Fullerton researchers , who observed as children exposed to a &quot; Power Rangers &quot; episode immediately responded by harassing playmates with karate kicks and aggressive shoves . Children who weren ' t allowed to watch the single episode of the Fox mega-hit did nothing worse than take other youngsters ' crayons in the hour after the show , the observers found in their two-day study last fall . &quot; One of the scary things about violence in the media is it gives children new ideas about how to be aggressive and be violent , &quot; said Chris Boyatzis , an assistant_professor in Cal State Fullerton ' s child development department , who oversaw the study . The show &quot; transmits specific forms of violent behavior that the kids may_not know &quot; before they watch. &quot; &quot; I think parents need to observe what their children are watching , &quot; said Kristen Nesbitt , a 23-year-old senior who said she will submit the results of what began as a simple class project for publication in a psychology journal . &quot; A lot of times , kids take what they see on TV out_to the real world. &quot; What millions of children see each week on &quot; Power Rangers &quot; is five teen-agers &quot; morphing &quot; into spandex-clad super-heroes who use karate chops and magic swords to conquer monsters sent to Earth by &quot; Rita Repulsa , the Empress of Evil. &quot; The show ' s creators at Saban Entertainment deny that it makes youngsters violent , saying that each episode concludes with a positive message , and that children who watch the live-action show know the fight scenes are just fantasy . A publicist for the producer declined further comment , saying he had not yet seen the study . But Boyatzis called that argument &quot; dangerous and misleading . &quot; Even if the producers think it ' s clearly marked as fantasy , the kids are still going_to copy it , fantasy or not , &quot; Boyatzis said . Boyatzis acknowledged that his students ' observations merely validate &quot; hundreds &quot; of earlier research studies showing that violence on television can lead to violent behavior in real_life . But he said that the &quot; contribution of our study is that we ' re looking_at ' Power Rangers , ' which is the hottest thing right now . Here is clear evidence that ' Power Rangers ' is leading to more aggressive behavior in children. &quot; Last October , Nesbitt and research partner Gina Matillo , another undergraduate studying child development , split 52 after-school day-care students at Brea ' s Mariposa Elementary School into two groups . They showed one group of the 6- to 11-year-olds a 23-minute episode of &quot; Power Rangers &quot; that contained 140 aggressive acts , according to their count . Then the researchers watched the children play indoors , just as they do each afternoon as they await their parents . Parents gave permission for the children to participate in the research . The next day , the researchers watched the second group playing with the same toys in the same room , but without having first seen &quot; Power Rangers. &quot; The students watched each child in the two groups for two minutes apiece , logging every act of aggression , including karate moves , hitting , pushing and stealing . They found that the children who had just watched &quot; Power Rangers &quot; were aggressive six times more often than the children who had not watched the show . The children who had watched &quot; Power Rangers &quot; imitated the martial_arts sequences down to specific kicks , somersaults and arm movements -- even echoing the sounds that the characters made during the show ' s fight scenes , the researchers reported . The monster battle scenes were part of a Japanese television_program show from several years ago that has been dubbed and incorporated into &quot; Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. &quot; Boyatzis and his students are preparing their findings for submission to a psychology journal and have submitted them to the Social Ecology Research Conference to be held at UC Irvine in April . They have not heard if their paper has been accepted . Boyatzis said the brief study and small sample did not detract from the validity of the researchers ' conclusions . &quot; If we can get such heightened aggression from just one episode , then that ' s all_the more reason to be alarmed , &quot; he said . He said the sample of 52 children was &quot; legitimate &quot; for research purposes . The show grabbed headlines last year when it became the nation ' s top-ranked children ' s program and parents scrambled to find &quot; Power Rangers &quot; action figures in the midst of a Christmastime shortage . Boyatzis said he is one of those who has not joined the craze . &quot; I have a daughter who ' s 7 1 / 2 . I ' ve never let her watch it and I probably never will. &quot;</TEXT>
