   <HEADLINE> CHILD_CARE A KEY HURDLE TO CLINTON WELFARE PLAN ; REFORM : PRESIDENT ' S TASK_FORCE IS HARD-PRESSED TO DESIGN AFFORDABLE PLAN TO KEEP HIS PLEDGE TO END WELFARE ' AS WE KNOW IT. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like thousands of other single mothers who support their families on welfare , Carolyn Bates is trying to do what President Clinton wants her to do -- make_it on_her_own . The obstacles are no less formidable for their familiarity : only a high_school diploma , an all-but-empty resume and a home_in a poor , crime-infested part of Baltimore far from any job . But Bates said that arranging reliable child_care for her 6-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son is the biggest hurdle . Although her on-the-job training_program provides money for day_care , the only licensed centers in her area that seem safe and comfortable also have long waiting_lists . Relatives who agreed to watch the children were not dependable . So for now she leaves her training job early to pick_up her children from school . But she knows this will not be possible when she finds a real job . &quot; I want a very good job , &quot; said Bates , 34 . &quot; Something me and my kids can live_off . But if I can ' t find good child_care where my kids are comfortable , I ' m going_to wind_up not working. &quot; &quot; But I need to work , &quot; she said , her voice filling with anxiety . &quot; I don ' t want to lay_around getting checks . I ' m not happy doing that . I am able and I want to work. &quot; Like Bates , many single mothers nationally cannot work because their children have nowhere to go . Her predicament , multiplied millions of times , poses a huge challenge for the policy designers assigned by President Clinton to come_up with an affordable plan to keep his campaign pledge to &quot; end welfare as we know it. &quot; With yearly per-child costs running from $ 3 # 000 to $ 5 # 000 , child_care is the most expensive part of welfare reform plans that require parents to work instead of staying_at home . Child_care is in short supply in many poor urban neighborhoods and rural_areas -- especially high-quality care available at the odd hours that are typical of the bottom-of-the-ladder jobs that former welfare recipients often get . An Administration task_force is grappling with this issue as it prepares a welfare reform program for Clinton ' s consideration . What appears to be its preferred approach -- limiting welfare benefits to two years and then turning recipients out onto the job market -- would send as_many as 2 million of the youngest welfare recipients searching for child_care . The Administration ' s welfare reformers said they have not estimated how many new children would need government-subsidized child_care under that approach , but they expressed confidence the supply will be adequate . &quot; We agree that child_care is one of the most important parts of the equation , &quot; said Walter D . Broadnax , who as deputy secretary of health and human services is_on the welfare reform task_force . &quot; The only problem is paying_for it. &quot; For starters , the Administration is considering more_than doubling the $ 1.5 billion a year that the government now spends for child_care for the working poor . Administration officials are counting_on private businesses , nonprofit organizations and even former welfare recipients to respond to the increased demand for child_care . Not everyone is so hopeful . &quot; What you ' re talking_about is thousands and thousands currently on waiting lists for subsidized child_care slots and welfare reform is going_to create thousands and thousands more , &quot; said Rep . Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) . &quot; We ' re talking_about a tidal_wave for a system that is already stressed out. &quot; Wyden said the federal_government will have to provide substantial new money and to regulate child_care more closely . &quot; You can ' t do welfare reform unless you do child_care reform , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' ve got_to make_sure the welfare reformers understand that this is too important to be short shrifted. &quot; Some conservatives argue that child_care costs are so huge that welfare reform should be targeted to put recipients who need the least child_care -- those with older children -- into training and jobs first . The Administration ' s current favored reform concept takes the opposite approach , targeting recipients under the age of 25 . But they are the most likely to have additional children who will need child_care for the longest period_of_time . Federal and state assistance for child_care has mushroomed in the last five years , with the federal contribution growing from $ 660 million in 1988 to about $ 1.5 billion this year . But federally subsidized care_for people leaving welfare is guaranteed for only a year . Lucretia Dean , a single mother who stopped getting welfare checks and started working last October , already sees a child_care deadline looming . As a nurse ' s aide at a Baltimore nursing_home , Dean earns $ 6.25 an hour -- more_than many former welfare recipients -- but only on a part-time basis . She said she hopes to get a job at a local hospital before her year of transitional child_care is used_up . But even then , she would earn only another $ 1.25 an hour , and paying $ 85 a week for child_care would still be impossible . &quot; If you ' re just starting_out , they ' re going to give you minimum_wage or a little more , and that doesn ' t come_close to covering rent , utilities , transportation , food and day_care , &quot; Dean said as she picked_up her 4-year-old son from a child_care center in a working-class neighborhood . &quot; But they don ' t think_about that when they say : ' Everybody get a job. ' Child_care really is the biggest issue when you ' re trying to get_off welfare and stay off. &quot; Illinois ' welfare policy-makers thought they had a solution . They took another federally funded child_care program -- for people at risk of going_on welfare because their incomes are less than 75 % of the median -- and targeted it at former welfare recipients whose year of transitional day_care subsidies had been exhausted . The hope was that their incomes would increase to_the_point where they no longer would be eligible for subsidies of any kind . But more_than two-thirds of those who received extensions were still using them a year later . &quot; A lot of these jobs do not have career ladders that will ever enable them to afford child_care , &quot; said Michelle Piel , the manager of child_care and development at the Illinois Department of Public Aid . Now , because the maximum number of people are using the &quot; at risk &quot; child_care program , the state is cutting former welfare recipients off after the year of transitional care . Some of those people already are back on welfare , Piel said . In a 1990 survey of 7 # 000 recipients of aid to families with dependent children , a quarter of the respondents said they quit a job or school because of child_care , Piel said . In Texas , acclaimed for setting_up a particularly efficient subsidized child_care system , the number of children receiving care soared from fewer than 17 # 000 in 1989 to more_than 60 # 000 in 1994 . Yet many working poor families still cannot get the services for which they are eligible . &quot; There are at least as_many children on waiting lists as there are in care , &quot; said Charlotte Brandtley , director of child_care for the Texas Social_Services Department . For public_treasuries , it is clearly cheaper over the short term to let welfare recipients stay home with their children rather than pay_for their child_care while they receive training and go_to work . Staying_at home , a mother of two preschool children in Illinois would receive a $ 367 welfare check each month . But if she took a minimum-wage job , the government would still pay her $ 135 a month in welfare benefits plus $ 600- $ 800 a month for child_care for a year . Cost notwithstanding , a consensus is forming among policy-makers that it is better for everybody -- welfare recipients , their children and society at_large -- if single parents are required to work . Welfare recipients themselves are not so sure . &quot; I don ' t think the government should make_it mandatory for a parent to put a small child in day_care before the child can talk , &quot; said Angela Candy , 33 , a mother of three who is trying to make the transition from welfare to work . &quot; What if something bad is happening to the child ? &quot; &quot; I feel the opposite , &quot; said Rhonda Clark , 24 , who recently started a job and went_off welfare after receiving it off and on for seven years . She and her two children live across the street from a public housing project , and she says she sees the terrible influence on the children when their parents collect welfare checks every month . &quot; As long as a child is in the home , he or she only gets what the parent has to offer , &quot; Clark said . &quot; And if that parent is staying home all day_watching TV and chatting with friends , that ' s the only life the child knows . that ' s why most of them grow_up and end_up on social_services too. &quot; She said children as young as 1 or 2 years old are_better served by having their mothers working : &quot; They ' re at a very impressionable age . Things stick_in their minds . The more exposure they get_to other lifestyles the better. &quot;</TEXT>
