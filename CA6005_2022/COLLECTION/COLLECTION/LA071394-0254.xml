   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; RESIGNATION MAY WORK IN NEPALESE LEADER ' S FAVOR ; ASIA : GIRIJA PRASAD KOIRALA RETAINS POWER AS CARETAKER PREMIER WHILE PEDDLING HIS PLATFORM TO THE VOTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For three years , a septuagenarian workaholic who suffers from fainting spells served as prime_minister of Nepal as the poor , isolated Shangri-La experimented with parliamentary_democracy . This week , assailed by lawmakers he thought were his allies as well as by opposition Communists , the beleaguered Girija Prasad Koirala resigned . Elections have been called_for Nov . 13 . The jury is still out on Koirala ' s performance . But the leader from the Nepali Congress Party would have done_well to heed the old_French nobleman ' s prayer -- &quot; God protect me from my friends , I ' ll take_care of my enemies &quot; -- for it was Koirala ' s supposed party buddies who did him in . The moment of truth came Sunday . During a crucial parliamentary vote on his government ' s program , 36 dissident Congress legislators abstained . Koirala was able to muster only 74 &quot; yes &quot; votes_in the 205-seat House of Representatives . &quot; I have no moral authority to stay in office , &quot; Koirala announced , then tendered his resignation to Nepal ' s king . Delighted by his fall , hundreds of people staged a victory march through Katmandu ' s streets , chanting , &quot; Democracy , hi , hi , Giriji , bye-bye ! &quot; The cheering , though , was premature . As the painful story of the infancy of Nepalese democracy continues to be written , it may well be Koirala who has the last laugh . Until recently , Nepal , a land the size of Arkansas , was ruled by a Hindu absolute monarch , Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev . In 1990 , after a long political struggle in which up_to 500 people died , the Eton- and Harvard-educated king gave_in , delegating sovereignty to his subjects . * The next year , after creation of a constitutional monarchy and Parliament , the Nepalese were able to vote_in multi-party elections for the first time in three decades . On May 29 , 1991 , as a result of the election victory of the Nepali Congress , Koirala , 71 , the brother of two former prime_ministers , took_over the reins . As a seasoned leader of the Congress , spearhead of the popular movement that successfully campaigned for the establishment of European-style democracy , Koirala vowed to deliver immediate relief to his 20 million fellow citizens . But within three months of the premier ' s swearing in , his comrade in arms , Ganesh Man Singh , commander_in_chief of the 1990 pro-democracy movement , was calling loudly for his resignation . One reason , it appears , was Singh ' s failure to get a cousin appointed to the Planning_Commission ; another was the failure of the now-ailing &quot; supremo &quot; of the Congress , unlike Koirala , to be one of his party ' s 114 members elected to the House of Representatives . The third powerful party figure , Nepali Congress President Krishna Prasad Bhattarai , also proved incapable of winning election . His most recent bid , when he was beaten by the widow of a Communist leader this February , was a fiasco . This month Koirala buried the hatchet with Bhattarai . But that wasn ' t enough to snuff_out the mutiny by party dissidents who accused him of sabotaging Bhattarai ' s campaign and who withheld support last weekend . According to Koirala ' s own analysis , the root of his problems lay_in the fact that although Congress campaigned for free elections , it never concerned itself about what to do if it won . &quot; We had not done our homework and we were not psychologically prepared , &quot; he said recently . But his government also came_to be widely accused of incompetence and corruption , and symptoms of the same post-democratic hangover that has affected the ex-Soviet Union became chronic in Nepal . * &quot; Shangri-La &quot; is the evocative nickname often given to Nepal , with its majestic , snow-clad Himalayan peaks and emerald valleys . But for most who live there , it is no Eden . More_than four-fifths of the Nepalese eke_out a living through subsistence_farming . Public health is still so poor that each year 45 # 000 children die of diarrhea . Political scientists , such_as Prof . Lok Raj Baral of Katmandu ' s Tribhuvan University , see Nepal as in an uneasy transitional phase_in which institutions from the old absolute monarchy coexist with democracy . &quot; The bureaucracy is intact , it ' s the same army and police , &quot; Baral says . &quot; The only new people are the ones in Parliament. &quot; He accuses Koirala and his colleagues of having been too slow and timid in asserting their authority , both in government and over the fractious Nepali Congress . Koirala ' s foes on the left also became near-permanent sources of concern . Communist support gave the pro-democracy movement a crucial boost , and the Communists won 81 seats in Parliament . But when Koirala ' s government was only 29 days old , the Communists began leading strikes and protests . After Koirala ' s resignation , both the Communists and Bhattarai on behalf of the Congress demanded the chance to form a new government . But the route out of the governmental crisis that was unexpectedly chosen by King Birendra has given Koirala a second chance . A royal communique issued Monday said Koirala had been asked to stay_on as Nepal ' s caretaker premier and organize the November parliamentary elections . So instead of having to hand power over now to a successor government , Koirala gets_to wield the perks of his office for four more months , then to appeal directly to voters for their support . He now seems keen on doing so . &quot; I don ' t see any other alternative to going_to people and seeking their fresh mandate , &quot; he told reporters . * Dahlburg , The Times ' New Delhi Bureau chief , recently was_on assignment in Nepal .</TEXT>
