   <TEXT> EVOLUTIONARY MEDICINE : Rethinking the Origins of Disease by Marc Lappe . ( Sierra Club Books : $ 30 ; 255 pp. ) . One of the great weasel phrases of science , as even most scientists will agree , is &quot; . . . provided all other variables are kept constant. &quot; It ' s a momentous qualification , for in real_life variables vary -- almost invariably , one wants to add -- and render true_statements inaccurate nanoseconds after they ' ve been uttered . that ' s the issue at the heart of &quot; Evolutionary Medicine , &quot; although Marc Lappe , a pathologist and director of the Center for Ethics and Toxic Substances in Gualala , states it more narrowly ; he argues that by looking_at diseases such_as AIDS , malaria , tuberculosis , etc. , in frozen , &quot; snapshot &quot; form rather than as ever-evolving products of an ever-changing environment , the medical Establishment has limited its chances to eradicate or ameliorate them . One simple fact demonstrates the power of Lappe ' s case : some bacteria can pass_through 30 generations in a single day , meaning that they can mutate into new , antibiotic-resistant forms almost before the physician has turned his back . One problem with modern medicine , Lappe writes , is that doctors , being trained to treat individual patients , may worsen the health of the species as_a_whole ; by over-prescribing antibiotics , utilizing outdated courses of chemotherapy and ignoring viruses ' ability to reproduce quickly , they end_up creating broadly resistant bacteria , cancer_cells unresponsive to numerous drugs and more potent viruses . There is hope , however ; perhaps the most fascinating section of the book is Lappe ' s brief discussion of one speculative AIDS treatment , a &quot; controlled selection &quot; in which a patient ' s HIV virus is encouraged to back-mutate into a form susceptible to , say , AZT. &quot; Evolutionary Medicine &quot; is_full of such thought-provoking proposals , but most valuable in providing a new lens through which to view intractable medical problems . It ' s only reasonable to think that medicine , itself a product of nature , is more likely to make progress working with natural forces rather than by bending them to its will .</TEXT>
