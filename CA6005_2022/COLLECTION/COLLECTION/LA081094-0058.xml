   <HEADLINE> RING OF GOLD ; A LOOK_AT THE 1984 U.S. OLYMPIC BOXING TEAM ; THE COUNT REACHES 10 ; SOME ARE OUT , BUT AT LEAST TWO OF NINE GOLD MEDALISTS ARE STILL GOING STRONG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ten years ago Thursday , American boxing ' s class of ' 84 jump-started the playing of the national_anthem nine times . The boxers cried a bit on the medal platform , hugged each other , then embarked_on pro careers that a decade later continue in prosperous fashion for two -- Pernell Whitaker and Virgil Hill -- but have gone_off the tracks for all_the rest . They fought to a record nine gold medals in the Sports Arena , barely missing a 10th when a future heavyweight champion , Evander Holyfield , was disqualified in a light-heavyweight semifinal bout . Nine . A big number . In two Olympics since then , U.S. boxing gold medals total four . True , boxing powerhouse Cuba and most East Bloc countries boycotted the L.A. Olympics , making the going much easier for the the U.S. team . Still , about half the members of that team earned more_than a_million dollars as pros , with Holyfield and lightweight Whitaker becoming the richest . Holyfield has grossed roughly $ 100 million since then , including boxing and endorsement income . Whitaker would rank a distant second . Holyfield was responsible_for one of the most dramatic , unforgettable moments of the L.A. Olympics . Before 11 # 729 , in a semifinal match , he flattened New Zealander Kevin Barry with a left hook that landed a split_second after the referee ' s &quot; Stop ! &quot; command . Instantly , Yugoslav referee Anton Josipovic gave the signal that he had disqualified the American . Holyfield , who had appeared to be not only on his way to a gold medal but the tournament ' s outstanding-boxer award as well -- seemed stunned . Enraged , U.S. Coach Pat Nappi tried to charge into the ring after Josipovic but was restrained by assistant Roosevelt Sanders . The crowd was near-riotous . A two-syllable expletive was chanted , and trash sailed into the ring . But the disqualification stuck , and Holyfield received the loudest ovation of all on gold-medal awards night when he was given the bronze , and Barry , who had won the gold , hauled him up onto the top spot of the platform so the crowd could salute him . Ten summers ago , the biggest winner seemed to be Mark Breland , the skinny New York welterweight who , though booed repeatedly during the tournament , finished his amateur career with the best mark in the history of amateur boxing , 110-1 . He then signed a pro deal that remains the richest ever for an amateur turning pro . But his pro career ( 30-3-1 ) , when measured against expectations in 1984 , was something of a bust . The biggest surprise of the class of ' 84 ? Undoubtedly , middleweight silver medalist Hill , who a decade later as a light-heavyweight champion has lost only once in his pro career and still regularly commands six-digit paydays . A 10-year update , on the class of ' 84 : PAUL GONZALES : Gold Medalist ( 106 pounds ) Gonzales remembers a flash of anger when he stepped onto the medal platform to receive his gold medal . &quot; I wanted to bring my mother up_on the platform for the ceremony , but they would n ' t let me , &quot; he said . &quot; But still , I ' ll never forget that moment -- holding American and Mexican flags in my hands , listening to the national_anthem , and feeling so proud_of who I was. &quot; It fell to Gonzales , through the luck of the draw , to set the tone for the U.S. sweep_through the tournament . On day one , Gonzales drew South_Korean Kim Kwang-Sun . He and Gonzales were ranked 1-2 in the world at the time . Gonzales dominated Kim , knocking him down early , showing_off all his considerable boxing skills and winning an easy decision . STEVE McCRORY : Gold Medalist ( 112 pounds ) To hear his manager tell it , McCrory was done_in by two human flaws , impatience and jealousy . The Detroit boxer , younger brother of former welterweight champion Milton McCrory , wasn ' t offered much to turn pro . He wound_up with his brother in the Kronk Gym stable operated by Manny Steward . &quot; By 1985 , Steve had become unhappy that the other Olympic kids were making much more money than he was , &quot; Steward said recently . &quot; He was undefeated and wanted to take a fight in Australia with Jeff Fenech for his bantamweight title , and I advised against it . I felt Fenech was too strong for him , that Steve just wasn ' t ready . But he insisted -- he demanded -- I make the fight . &quot; Steve just ran_out of gas in the late rounds , and Fenech beat him . And his career never really bounced_back . &quot; If he ' d taken more of the fights I wanted him to take early on , he ' d have been much tougher later. &quot; ROBERT SHANNON : ( 119 pounds ) Shannon is the answer to the boxing trivia question : &quot; Which ' 84 U.S. Olympic boxer did not win a medal ? &quot; Left-handed , possessing a solid left hook and little defensive prowess , Shannon ' s fights , amateur and pro , tended to be quick and exciting . In fact , his Olympic defeat went_down in the minds of many as the most memorable of the tournament . In a nonstop , multiple-knockdown brawl with a South_Korean , Moon Sung-Kil , Shannon was stopped in the third round of the preliminaries . Shannon was the team barber . He charged teammates $ 2 for a trim , $ 5 for a style cut . Today , at 31 , he ' s a professional barber in Lynnwood , Wash . And it ' s $ 9 per trim . Afterward , there was no big contract . He earned $ 1 # 500 for his first pro bout in 1984 and in a career that ended in 1990 with an 18-6-2 record , his biggest purse was $ 10 # 000 . His most vivid Olympic memory : &quot; Just walking_around in L.A. with my USA sweats on , and having so many people come_up_to me -- not even knowing what sport I was involved in -- and wishing me luck . It was a great experience , all_of it. &quot; MELDRICK TAYLOR : Gold Medalist ( 125 pounds ) It ' s commonly believed_in boxing circles that Taylor ' s pro career flamed out on a 1990 spring night in Las Vegas when he lost in the final seconds to Julio Cesar Chavez , and wound_up in the hospital . The conventional wisdom : He was never the same . Maybe so , but Taylor throughout his career had a nemesis more formidable than Chavez , the scales . Once , when he was 17 , on a night before a U.S. team was to box the Cubans , Nappi made bed_checks and found Taylor tucked_in with a pizza , hours before he had to make 125 pounds . It was always like that for the extravagantly talented Philadelphia featherweight -- the hard-hitting kid who couldn ' t make weight . Six years later , Taylor came within seconds of beating perhaps the greatest fighter of his time , Chavez . Despite Chavez ' s great rally in the late rounds of a memorable battle of 140-pounders , two judges had Taylor comfortably ahead when disaster struck him with seconds left . Taylor , bleeding from the nose and mouth and with his left eye closing , was felled by a right . He arose at the six-count , and when referee Richard Steele asked , &quot; Are you OK ? &quot; he got no response . Steele stopped it , igniting a controversy that still fuels arguments . He signaled the fight ' s end with two seconds to go , and raised Chavez ' s hand . Taylor never seemed the same fighter after that . More worrisome , he didn ' t sound the same . His speech was slurred . Friends begged him to retire . He didn ' t . In fact , he will fight Chavez again on Sept . 17 . PERNELL WHITAKER : Gold Medalist ( 132 pounds ) &quot; Sweet_Pea , &quot; his teammates of ' 84 called him . He might have been the best of all , even then , as now . Breland was the team ' s headliner in Los Angeles , but Whitaker , the left-hander from Norfolk , was also world-class . When he defeated Cuba ' s Angel Herrera in that USA-Cuba dual meet early that year , it was the third consecutive time he had beaten Herrera , one of amateur boxing ' s great champions at the time . But Whitaker and Breland were pals then , as now , and he never seemed uncomfortable in Breland ' s shadow . &quot; I feel I ' m the best ( amateur ) fighter in the world , but if people want to say Mark is , well , he ' s my friend , so that ' s OK , &quot; he said , when the team arrived in Los Angeles . His adviser since 1984 , Shelly Finkel , said Whitaker as a pro &quot; lived_up_to every bit of potential we saw in him then , and went beyond that. &quot; Finkel talked_of two pro fights Whitaker won with broken hands as examples of his professionalism and courage . But the eye-opener occurred on Aug . 20 , 1989 , in Norfolk , Va. , he said . &quot; That was the day he beat Jose Luis Ramirez so decisively , after he ' d had a decision over Ramirez stolen from him in Paris the year before , &quot; Finkel said . &quot; His attitude that day , his will -- that showed me there was no limit to what he could achieve. &quot; JERRY PAGE : Gold Medalist ( 139 pounds ) Page won an Olympic gold medal , had a cup of coffee in pro boxing , retiring with an 11-4 record , and now says he ' s happy . Page , 33 , and his wife , Christy , live_in Page ' s hometown of Columbus , Ohio , and have five children . The gold medal is in a desk drawer , he says . Page works for the Columbus Police Athletic League , coaching youth boxers . His most enduring ' 84 memory : &quot; Walking_out_of that tunnel during the opening ceremonies , seeing all those people , hearing the music -- it hit me like , bam ! There was a feeling of reality to it that I ' ll never forget. &quot; Page ' s gold medal was achieved with some controversy . When he was given a 5-0 decision over Thawee Umpormaha of Thailand , the Thais screamed . Page , who retired in 1990 , said he passed_up chances to make more money than he did professionally . &quot; I was offered as much as $ 60 # 000 to sign with people , but everyone wanted me to move someplace , &quot; he said . &quot; I wanted to box_in Columbus . And I had a bad knee then and I wasn ' t confident about how it ' d hold_up . I didn ' t want to take money under false pretenses . &quot; As it turned_out , my biggest purse was $ 12 # 500 . I have no complaints . Boxing was good to me. &quot; MARK BRELAND : Gold Medalist ( 147 pounds ) A decade later , Breland remains the king of boxing ' s bonus babies . Three months after he won gold in L.A. , he was earning $ 100 # 000 for his first bout , had signed a $ 3-million dollar ABC deal , was driving a luxury car and lived_on Park_Avenue . Appropriately , when he and seven Olympic teammates turned pro in Madison Square Garden on Nov . 15 , 1984 , Breland had &quot; Goldbusters &quot; T-shirts printed up for everyone . He had a good career . He was even a welterweight champion for a while . But considering the huge buildup , he was something of a bust as a pro . New Yorkers turned_on the Brooklyn fighter quickly when his soft chin was exposed by Marlon Starling in 1987 . In 1992 , at 30-3-1 , he retired . He says he ' s not disappointed . &quot; I enjoyed my boxing career . A lot of people were saying I was going_to be a ( Sugar Ray ) Leonard or a ( Thomas ) Hearns . Then when things didn ' t work_out like that , they said , ' Well , he ' s sure no Leonard or Hearns. ' &quot; I never said that . It never bothered me that I didn ' t live_up_to what other people expected. &quot; This year , at 30 , an annuity established in 1984 by his adviser , Finkel , kicks_in . From it , Breland will receive $ 100 # 000 a year for life . FRANK TATE : Gold Medalist ( 156 pounds ) As was Taylor ' s , Tate ' s early pro career might have been a weight class too low . Making the light-middleweight limit of 156 was a daily grind for Tate at the L.A. Olympics , and so was 160 when he turned pro . It all caught_up to him when he faded in the late rounds and lost his piece of the world middleweight title to Michael Nunn in 1988 . Tate had perhaps the easiest journey of all to ' 84 gold . In fact , he had a harder_time in the Olympic trials final against U.S. rival Ron Essett than against any of five foes in the Games . In Los Angeles , he started with two 5-0 decisions , stopped another opponent in one round , got a medical walkover in the semifinals and then won a 5-0 decision over Canadian Shawn O ' Sullivan for the gold medal . Tate ' s pro career was temporarily in limbo after Nunn stopped him in the ninth round . Tate , still active at 31-4 , moved_up to light-heavyweight in 1990 . His old L.A. teammate , Hill , has twice lured him to Bismarck , N.D. , and beaten him on decisions . VIRGIL HILL : Silver Medalist ( 165 pounds ) In strictly a boxing sense , Hill has been one of the most successful of the class of ' 84 . Holyfield , Whitaker and Taylor have made more money , but none of the 12 can match his record of 38-1 , including 17-1 in championship fights . And with the exception of taking a fight with Hearns in 1991 -- his only loss -- he has made the best decisions of any of his teammates and been the best managed . From the outset , Hill has concentrated_on being a big-time star in his home state , North_Dakota . He ' s the biggest sports name there since Roger Maris . His portrait hangs_in the state capitol in Bismarck . Hill could book a fight in Bismarck with Roseanne Arnold , put 8 # 000 in the Civic Center -- with the governor at ringside -- and make $ 300 # 000 . The boxer thought by some to have been the weak link on the ' 84 Olympic team has grossed about $ 4 million . He trains virtually year-around , watches his diet between fights , and is still fighting at the same weight , 175 , as when he turned pro in 1984 . No other ' 84 Olympian can make that claim . EVANDER HOLYFIELD : Bronze Medalist ( 178 pounds ) Early in 1984 , Ricky Womack of Detroit was thought to be a cinch for the Olympic team . A natural light-heavyweight , Womack was fearless , a hard hitter and had beaten every contender in_sight . Then along came Holyfield , a skinny kid who earned pocket_money by gassing_up small planes at a suburban Atlanta airport . He came_on with a rush in the team selection process , before losing a 3-2 decision to Womack in the semifinals of the Olympic trials . But in the box-off three weeks later , he beat Womack twice in two days to make the team , both on 4-1 decisions . Late in the Olympic tournament , Holyfield looked_to be_on his way to a gold medal and the outstanding-boxer award -- won by Gonzales , as it turned_out . &quot; I never saw a kid improve in six months like this kid has , &quot; said Nappi , who was coaching his third Olympic team . Through all_the commotion and controversy of his unjust disqualification , Holyfield maintained a quiet dignity that remains with him today . Not once did he curse the referee , punch a wall or throw furniture . A pro turning point ? His one-punch , second-round knockout of Adilson Rodrigues at Lake Tahoe in 1989 . &quot; That showed me and everyone else he was a legitimate heavyweight , that his punch would have to be respected by anyone , &quot; Finkel said . Holyfield ' s career is at least on hold . A congenital heart problem was discovered after he lost his heavyweight championship to Michael Moorer last April , and Holyfield continues to undergo medical tests . And Womack ? His old amateur rival is serving a 12- to 25-year prison sentence in Michigan for armed robbery . HENRY TILLMAN : Gold Medalist ( 201 pounds ) It was perhaps the most improbable story of them all , that Henry Tillman , two years after trying_on a pair of boxing gloves for the first time , won an Olympic gold medal . Tillman didn ' t have much of a pro career ( 25-6 ) , but his Olympic story remains one of the best . In 1982 , he signed_up for a boxing class at the California Youth Authority facility at Chino , where he was serving a year on an armed-robbery conviction . Tillman ' s career will forever be linked with Mike Tyson ' s . It was Tillman who prevented the 17-year-old New York slugger from making the ' 84 team , beating him twice in the trials . And in 1989 , Tillman was selected as Tyson ' s first opponent after his shocking knockout loss to Buster Douglas in Japan . Tyson knocked_out Tillman in one round . Tyson , an Olympic team alternate , wound_up being Nappi ' s go-fer at the Olympics . Four years later , Tyson grossed $ 50 million . Today , Tillman , 34 , lives in the Diamond Bar home he bought with the $ 350 # 000 earned in the Tyson fight . He is married to Gina Hemphill Tillman , whom he met during the ' 84 Games . Hemphill , a granddaughter of Jesse Owens , carried the Olympic torch during the opening ceremonies . Tillman has studied real_estate and frequently does public_speaking . &quot; I wanted to be the world heavyweight champion when I turned pro , &quot; he said . &quot; But I ' m not sorry it never happened . It was time to move_on . I did all right. &quot; TYRELL BIGGS : Gold Medalist ( 201 + pounds ) Biggs , more_than anyone else on the ' 84 team , benefited from Cuba ' s boycott of the L.A. Olympics . Cuba ' s triple Olympic champion , Teofilo Stevenson , was 33 then , but still on top of his game and 2-0 against Biggs . Biggs won a decision from a ponderous Italian , Francesco Damiani , for the gold . Pro trainers were intrigued by Biggs , who was 6 feet 5 and 220 pounds , had graceful ring movement and a workmanlike left jab . It was apparent he lacked knockout power , but many believed that through athleticism and boxing ability , he could become a prime-time heavyweight . Largely unknown at the outset of his pro career , however , was that Biggs had a drug problem dating to his Philadelphia high_school days . Also , Biggs was always a much better interview than boxer . Great fighters all have , somewhere , a nasty streak . Biggs didn ' t . Now 33 , he lives_in Costa Mesa on some of the $ 1.25 million he earned from his 1987 Mike Tyson fight , the money having been put_in trust for him . And he says he has been clean of drugs for nearly 10 years . With his pro career ( 27-9 ) over , he would like to train young boxers . &quot; I never really had a trainer who could develop the skills I had , &quot; he said . &quot; Most pro trainers are big-punch oriented and tried to make me a puncher , when I wasn ' t. &quot; Biggs ' career was never the same after Tyson defeated him in 1987 . Biggs was 15-0 at the time , but lost his next three bouts was 24-5 by 1991 . * Footnote : Nappi died at 75 in 1992 . Not a single member of his ' 84 Olympic team attended the funeral at West_Point , N.Y.
