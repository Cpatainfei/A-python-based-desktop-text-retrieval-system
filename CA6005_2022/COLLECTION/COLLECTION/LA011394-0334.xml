   <HEADLINE> ' THE CISCO KID ' WALKS BETWEEN TWO WORLDS ; TELEVISION : FILMMAKERS GET_BACK TO THEIR ROOTS IN THE TNT MOVIE , FOLLOWING THE FOOTSTEPS OF A LEGENDARY HERO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rebellious black stallion had finally let Jimmy Smits mount him and the six child actors playing Cheech Marin ' s brood were primed to pay their father a tearful goodby when the first raindrops fell . A clap of thunder sent the cast and crew of Turner Network Television ' s made-for-TV movie &quot; The Cisco Kid &quot; running_for the cover of an adobe_house in this mountain village , their sixth location in as_many weeks . &quot; that ' s the way it ' s been , always trying to beat something -- the rain or the dark , &quot; said Marin , who plays sidekick Pancho to Smits ' Cisco . He laughed and added : &quot; We ride for hours . Every day I wake_up with new bruises . Had I known , I would have asked_for more money. &quot; After more_than a month of 20-hour days , hailstorms and saddle_sores , the &quot; Cisco Kid &quot; stars were getting punchy . But just past the jokes was a sense_of_purpose -- Chicano filmmakers who have come_to Mexico to work with colleagues here in revising the legend of a 19th-Century Californio ' s role in helping Mexico regain its independence during the_French occupation . The $ 6-million project , which premieres on TNT Feb . 6 , brought_together : Smits , &quot; L.A. Law ' s &quot; brooding , idealistic Victor Sifuentes ; Marin of the Cheech &amp; Chong comedy team and , more recently , &quot; Born in East L.A. , &quot; the tongue-in-cheek saga of a Chicano ' s sojourn in Mexico ; Luis Valdez , who directed &quot; La Bamba &quot; and &quot; Zoot Suit &quot; ; and Moctesuma Esparza , who along with partner Robert Katz produced &quot; Gettysburg , &quot; &quot; The Milagro Beanfield War &quot; and &quot; The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. &quot; * Mexicans with extensive international credits , such_as cinematographer Guillermo Navarro , handled much of the film ' s technical side and supporting roles . &quot; This is a collaboration of Chicano and Mexican filmmakers to portray both our history , &quot; Esparza said . That attitude permeated the set , where about the only English spoken was the actors ' lines and a_few phrases of show-business jargon that crossed the border along with the first Hollywood movie-makers to film in Mexico . Valdez brought his wife and teen-age sons along for the entire filming and encouraged other members of the cast and crew to invite their families to the set . Villagers who wanted to watch the filming were welcomed and often offered small roles , giving the production the atmosphere of a family outing . A new purpose is also evident in the movie ' s story line . In this version , the character based on an O . Henry story , &quot; The Caballero ' s Way , &quot; remains the Wild_West adventurer brought_to the screen by actors Stan Dunn , Warner Baxter , Cesar Romero and Duncan Renaldo . But this Cisco has the added dimension of a man in search of himself . He was born in California when it was still part of Mexico but made a fortune as a ' 49er in the Gold_Rush and fought in the Civil War as an American . He travels_to Mexico on a secret mission from the U.S._government to supply guns to Mexican rebels . &quot; Cisco is probably the first Chicano , &quot; said Smits , a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent . &quot; There is a whole question of identity , ' Where do I belong ? ' &quot; * That question was reflected in the costuming that production designer Joe Aubel developed for Smits . In early scenes , he wears high boots and a leather belt typical of a Civil War veteran , along with striped trousers used on the border during that era . As Cisco travels farther into Mexico , he dons the black charro , or Mexican cowboy costume that identifies the Cisco Kid character the way the Lone Ranger is known by his mask . &quot; The costume evolves as he finds himself , &quot; Aubel explained . Cisco ' s clothes become part of exploring his Mexican side , as does his friendship with Pancho . &quot; Pancho fulfills a part of him that he is trying to tap into , &quot; Smits said . That portrayal of Pancho -- radically different from the slovenly buffoon shown in earlier productions of &quot; The Cisco Kid &quot; -- attracted Marin to the script that Michael Kane co-wrote with director Valdez . &quot; What has really shifted is who Pancho is in_relation_to Cisco , &quot; Marin said . &quot; He is the revolutionary , the idealist. &quot; Scenes being filmed on one recent day were crucial to establishing the relationship between gun-runner Cisco and freedom fighter Pancho -- compatriots separated by a border . Aubel covered a tin roof with red tiles to transform the Telesforo Sanchez family home into the house where an 1860s Pancho lived with his wife , Rosa ( Yareli Arizmendi , who played the eldest daughter in &quot; Like Water for Chocolate &quot; ) , and their six children . Over a tequila breakfast , Pancho and Rosa try to persuade Cisco to join the insurgency against the_French occupation . &quot; You ' re a lucky man , Pancho , &quot; Smits tells Marin . &quot; You have a home , a good wife , children -- lots of them -- and a country to fight for. &quot; &quot; It ' s your country too , isn ' t it ? &quot; Arizmendi asks . &quot; It used to be , &quot; Smits replies . Director Valdez said , &quot; We used the_French intervention to give Pancho a background , a political context. &quot; It was also a chance to inform viewers , Esparza said . &quot; Most Americans don ' t know that the_French invaded Mexico and attempted to establish a monarchy , &quot; he said . A Mexican victory against enormous odds in an 1862 battle of the insurgency against the_French occupation is the fete that is celebrated every May 5 as Cinco de Mayo . * The 15-minute downpour that the cast and crew experienced here was a mere inconvenience compared to other weather problems the movie suffered . A week earlier , the Mexican army was sent_out to rescue the production troupe . A hailstorm had caught them on a desert mountaintop in the middle of a battle scene . &quot; We had 50 horses freaking_out , &quot; Marin recalled . &quot; It was scary because all you can do is stand there and get rained on. &quot; Besides the impromptu rescue , Mexican soldiers played a crucial planned role in &quot; The Cisco Kid. &quot; Both the_French and insurgent troops seen in the movie are really Mexican cavalry , with a_few cowboys thrown_in to increase the numbers . &quot; Where else are you going_to find people who can ride in formation ? &quot; asked Esparza . The Mexican government also cooperated in easing the way for gun and gunpowder permits , difficult to obtain here . The production roamed throughout the country , from the colonial city of Zacatecas to the desert village of Sombrerete to the organ_pipe cactus region known as Los Organos . &quot; These images are not going_to be the images American audiences have typically seen of Mexico , &quot; Esparza said . &quot; We are going_to show lush , green countryside . . . . We are trying to create a three-dimensional aspect of history while we entertain. &quot; That historical aspect was brought_home to Valdez during one location shot . &quot; In Sombrerete , we were shooting across the street from a house with a plaque that said ' Benito Juarez slept here , ' &quot; he recalled . His voice was tinged with the awe he still felt at having retraced the steps of the hero who freed Mexico from the_French occupation and introduced reforms , such_as the separation of church and state , that are central to government in Mexico today . &quot; I have thoroughly enjoyed interacting with Mexican crews , &quot; the director said . &quot; This has been a watershed year. &quot; Such a watershed , in fact , that Valdez even shaved the mustache he has worn for 35 years in_order to play a cameo role of Juarez . &quot; He is one of the great democratic heroes of the Americas , &quot; Valdez explained . &quot; I have identified with him since I was a kid. &quot; As for the lost mustache , Valdez said : &quot; At 18 , I started to grow a mustache to emphasize my Mexican heritage . . . . It has become part of my permanent image . But now , I no longer need a mustache to affirm my Mexican heritage. &quot;</TEXT>
