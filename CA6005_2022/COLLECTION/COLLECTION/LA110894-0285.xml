   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN ULTRANATIONALIST TELLS S.F. AUDIENCE HE ' S A DOVE ; SPEECH : IN ADDRESS TO WORLD AFFAIRS COUNCIL , VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY SAYS HE HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF LIES . UNCONVINCED DEMONSTRATORS DENOUNCE HIM AS A BIGOT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Never has a man been so woefully misquoted . Russian ultranationalist legislator Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , a flamboyant demagogue on his first visit to the United States , delivered a fiery speech Monday before the nonprofit World Affairs Council with one simple message : None of it is true . The vow to annex Alaska ? Slander . The accusations of anti-Semitism ? Lies . The threats to create a dictatorship , shoot 100 # 000 citizens , deploy nuclear_weapons ? Bald falsehoods . Before a disbelieving audience , including scores of Russian immigrants , Zhirinovsky described himself as a moderate , a dove , a friend to all ethnic_groups . &quot; I stand here before you to tell the world that our party believes_in multi-party democracy . We support no discrimination on ethnic , social , racial or religious grounds. &quot; Unconvinced , several hundred demonstrators gathered outside to distribute some of his most shocking quotes and denounce him as a bigot . &quot; We want to expose the real Zhirinovsky -- his virulent anti-Semitism , his fascism , &quot; said Rabbi Douglas Kahn , who helped organize the demonstration . &quot; We want to make him understand how repugnant the people of San Francisco find his message. &quot; Or , as Russian immigrant Yelena Bilyak said : &quot; He ' s the monster of the century. &quot; Zhirinovsky first railed his way to prominence in 1991 , when his harangues and pandering promises of cheap vodka helped him snatch nearly 8 % of the votes_in Russia ' s first presidential election . His raw confidence in Russia ' s prowess and his visions of military triumph and economic dominance gained further appeal over the next few years , as Russia slipped swiftly from superpower status . Zhirinovsky ' s misleadingly named Liberal Democratic Party captured an astounding 25 % of the votes_in the December , 1993 , parliamentary election . Zhirinovsky entered the lower house of Parliament in triumph -- already brazenly preparing a run_for the presidency in 1996 . Perhaps in preparation for that campaign , Zhirinovsky on Monday tested a stump_speech that could have passed muster_in most American districts : He promised to fight crime , banish ethnic conflict and boost the economy through tax reform . He even pledged goodies for the local audience : strong trade links between San Francisco and Russia ' s eastern towns . Zhirinovsky repeatedly warned that unless his party captures the presidency , Russia will collapse into anarchic civil_war . &quot; The worsening of conditions in Russia would bring big conflict over the entire Eurasian continent . It would come_close to the United States , &quot; he said . As an indication of his country ' s instability , Zhirinovsky asserted that Russian soldiers educated at Harvard_University are poised to overthrow their military command as part of an ongoing American attempt to meddle in Russian politics . A master conspiracy theorist who has blamed the AIDS epidemic on the United States , Zhirinovsky said he believes that the U.S. media are attempting to discredit him by misquoting his inflammatory rhetoric . &quot; Again -- lies , false information , &quot; he said . And later he added , &quot; Please listen to me , not to those papers that make special reports on me to diminish my popularity. &quot; Zhirinovsky even sought to distance himself from the bombastic jingoism of his autobiography , &quot; The Last Dash to the South. &quot; His vision of Russian soldiers bathing their feet in the Indian_Ocean -- interpreted as a call to conquest -- represents merely a &quot; prediction , &quot; Zhirinovsky said , and not a goal . &quot; Why does this book always interest you ? &quot; he asked reporters with evident irritation . Zhirinovsky ' s antics appear to have cost him some support in Russia . But polls show that he maintains a core backing of 5 % to 10 % -- not enough , perhaps , to win the presidency , but an indication that his hard-line views appeal_to millions of voters . Showcasing the deep frustration that Zhirinovsky taps into , thousands of demonstrators in Moscow , St . Petersburg and other Russian cities marched Monday in nostalgic commemoration of the 77th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution . While the mostly elderly demonstrators would probably not back Zhirinovsky -- who has blasted communism at every opportunity -- many held anti-reform placards that echo some of his platforms . Like the demonstrators , Zhirinovsky has harshly criticized Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s reformist government . On Monday , he called it &quot; 100 % Communist , &quot; accused it of establishing a &quot; totalitarian regime &quot; and said it had &quot; given property to the former Communists , the mafia and criminal elements. &quot; Clearly aware that his denunciation of Yeltsin did not sway many audience members his way , Zhirinovsky sought to spin the hostility to his advantage . &quot; I do not need your support , &quot; he said , predicting that his party will sweep 90 % of the vote_in Russia ' s next presidential election . &quot; Please do not praise our party , &quot; he exhorted . &quot; We would like you and your press to describe us with the worst words -- then we will get a lot of votes. &quot; Zhirinovsky ' s two-week tour of the United States will take him to New York and Miami .</TEXT>
