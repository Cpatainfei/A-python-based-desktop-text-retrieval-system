   <HEADLINE> RIGHTISTS REJECT PARTICIPATION IN S . AFRICA VOTING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the latest dip of this country ' s political roller_coaster , militant leaders of the far right Saturday overwhelmingly rejected a last-ditch plan to participate in next month ' s elections and warned again of civil_war if they are not granted an independent white homeland . As a result , retired Gen . Constand Viljoen , the most moderate leader of a white separatists ' coalition called the Afrikaner Volksfront , announced that he will honor the right-wing boycott of the country ' s first all-race elections . Viljoen had unexpectedly registered a hastily formed political_party , the Freedom Front , shortly before a Friday midnight deadline for the election expired . But he backed_down Saturday afternoon in the face of fierce opposition by pro-apartheid Volksfront leaders during a stormy , closed-door session here . A grim-faced Viljoen told reporters later that he will not submit a list of the party ' s candidates by Wednesday , as the law requires for the party to be listed on the final ballot . &quot; I will do nothing , &quot; Viljoen said . The Freedom Front ' s registration &quot; will just lapse. &quot; He added , &quot; This is the wish of the people. &quot; Ferdi Hartzenberg , the fiery president of the pro-apartheid Conservative_Party , first announced the decision to continue the election boycott to about 150 right-wingers who had gathered_in a Dutch Reform Church hall here . &quot; If we took_part in the election , we would lend it legitimacy , &quot; he said to cheers and applause . &quot; We would just be endorsing the oppression of our people , and that would be unacceptable. &quot; The Volksfront claims to represent the nation ' s 3 million Afrikaners , descendants of 17th-Century , mostly Dutch settlers . But polls have shown their support is far smaller and shrinking steadily as neo-Nazi and other openly racist zealots push the fractious organization further from the mainstream . Still , the sharp repudiation of Viljoen ' s pro-election maneuver dashed a surge of hopes and headlines that right-wingers would drop their opposition to a democratic vote and a peaceful transition to black majority_rule . It also appeared to split the Freedom Alliance open , because the right-wingers ' chief black ally , Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi ' s Inkatha Freedom Party , registered for the election Friday . Buthelezi said , however , that his participation in the campaign is contingent_on using international mediation to forge a solution to Inkatha ' s demand that the constitution be rewritten to provide far greater autonomy for Zulus in Natal province . Nelson Mandela , head of the African National Congress and expected to be the first black president , said Saturday that he is prepared to accept mediation by the United Nations , the Organization of African Unity , the Commonwealth or another international body . &quot; These are the organizations that must be entrusted with the task of international mediation , &quot; he said . Polls show the ANC is likely to sweep the April 26-28 elections . Mandela ' s chief rival , President Frederik W . de Klerk ' s National Party , stands to gain by the renewed right-wing boycott , because polls suggest many Afrikaners will seek a chance to vote against the ANC . But at least one of Viljoen ' s supporters , retired Gen . Tienie Groenewald , said Buthelezi may also benefit . The daylong meeting of the Volksfront ' s so-called Boer Parliament , which defiant right-wingers created in January as an ostensible governing body for Afrikaners until they are granted a homeland , was also supposed to finally choose the boundaries of the territory the separatists hope to occupy . The map was not released , but the hard-liners apparently won that debate as well . Despite the fact that whites are not in a majority in any part of the country , the Volksfront plan reportedly calls_for annexing more_than one-third of South_Africa ' s territory for a self-ruled , whites-only state . The proposed map includes the Transvaal , Orange Free_State and a slice of Natal province . The land , which includes the administrative capital of Pretoria , corresponds to the Boer republics that were conquered and colonized by the_British in 1902 after the second Boer_War . It is almost inconceivable that such a state could be created . Both Mandela and De Klerk have repeatedly said they would oppose the division of the post-apartheid nation into ethnic or racial territories . Many of the Afrikaners who attended the Saturday session , however , warned that they would go_to_war rather than submit to an ANC-led government . &quot; We must fight them , &quot; said a 64-year-old , white-haired woman wearing pearls and a necklace emblazoned with the swastika-like symbol of the Afrikaner Resistance Front , the best-known of the pro-apartheid groups . &quot; You sign your own death_warrant if you come under them . They don ' t understand democracy the way we do. &quot;</TEXT>
