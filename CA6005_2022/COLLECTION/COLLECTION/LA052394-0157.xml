   <TEXT> John_Henry Weidner , the Dutch-born hero decorated by many nations for rescuing more_than 1 # 000 Jews and Allied airmen from the Nazis during World_War_II , has died at his home_in Monterey Park . He was 81 . Weidner , who moved to the United States in the mid-1950s to escape memories of the war , died Saturday of heart_failure , the Southern California Conference of Seventh-day Adventists announced Sunday . The pacifist son of a Seventh-day Adventist minister , Weidner was a leader of the Dutch-Paris underground , which operated escape routes from war-torn Holland , Belgium and France into neutral Switzerland . He was captured repeatedly , interrogated by Klaus Barbie , the infamous &quot; Butcher of Lyon , &quot; and tortured by the Gestapo and France ' s Milice secret_police . He always escaped , jumping_off trains , swimming the Rhine under Nazi fire , and once diving out a third-floor prison window just prior to his scheduled execution . For his efforts , Weidner earned the Order of the_British Empire , the Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau and Medal of Resistance , the_French Croix de Guerre and the Medaille de la Resistance , Belgium ' s Order of King Leopold II and the U.S. Medal of Freedom with Gold Palms . He was also designated an officer of the_French Legion of Honor . Israel , recognizing him as a &quot; Righteous Gentile , &quot; entered his name as a hero in the Golden Book of Jerusalem and planted a tree with his name on the_Hill of Remembrance along the Avenue of the Righteous at Yad Vashem . Also recognized by the Simon Wiesenthal Center , Weidner was one of seven people chosen to light candles at last year ' s opening of the Holocaust Memorial in Washington , D.C. Weidner ' s wartime exploits were chronicled in the 1966 book by Herbert Ford titled &quot; Flee the Captor. &quot; Atlantic Union College last year established the John_Henry Weidner Center for the Cultivation of the Altruistic Spirit , which will sponsor lectures , concerts , classes , exhibits and social programs promoting altruism . &quot; During my father ' s lifetime , &quot; Weidner said in a speech in Pasadena honoring Holocaust victims in 1989 , &quot; he taught me , my family , his parishioners and the community that the most important quality in a human_being was to love , respect and treat our fellow man as we wished to be loved , respected and treated. &quot; &quot; I was a witness to the barbaric treatment of the Jews by the Nazis . I personally observed the crushing of the skull of a Jewish infant who was torn out of the arms of its mother , &quot; he said . &quot; I was determined to heed the teachings and example of my father and I did everything that I could to save as_many lives as possible. &quot; Weidner grew_up and was educated in France , where his father taught Greek and Hebrew at a Seventh-day Adventist college near the_Swiss border . Still in France when the war broke_out , the young businessman worked with the ecumenical Geneva-based World_Council of Churches to shepherd Jewish refugees to Switzerland . He became one of the Gestapo ' s most wanted men in Europe with a 5-million-franc price on his head , partially because of the prominence of some he saved . They included Gerni van Heuven Godehart , who later won a Nobel Prize , and Lt . Bram Van der Stok , who became minister of justice for the Dutch government-in-exile . Weidner aided in prosecuting war_criminals after the war . Moving to Southern California , Weidner married an American and opened a chain of health_food stores in the San Gabriel Valley called Weidner Nutrition . Weidner is survived by his wife , Naomi ; a sister , Annette Hipleh , and a nephew . Another sister , Gabrielle , died in the Nazis ' Ravensbrueck concentration_camp . A public memorial service is scheduled at 2 p.m. Saturday at the Seventh-day Adventist Church at 9664 E . Broadway , Temple City .</TEXT>
