   <HEADLINE> LAW STARTS SCHOOL SHOPPING FRENZY ; EDUCATION : OPEN ENROLLMENT PROMPTS FAMILIES TO PORE OVER OPTIONS . SOME TAKE ANOTHER LOOK_AT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District , parents are buzzing : Finally , they can enroll their children anywhere in the system regardless of where they live . School shopping has become a full-time job for some parents , who are interviewing principals , attending classes and orientation meetings and collecting test scores . Even parents who were considering private_schools are rethinking their options . &quot; This is the topic everywhere -- at the park , at PTA meetings , if you run_into a friend who has a 4-year-old . There is no one who doesn ' t talk_about this , &quot; said Maggie Scott , a parent in the Miracle Mile area who is shopping for an elementary_school for her son . The Board_of_Education this week gave parents more freedom to choose a new school within the Los Angeles district -- as long as racial balances remain intact and classroom seats are available . Under the new guidelines , parents no longer have to receive the principal ' s permission before withdrawing children from their school and enrolling them elsewhere . Although the open enrollment policy leaves families with some obstacles -- especially the lack of space at many desirable schools -- a great number of parents view it as a new lease on school life . Many parents have complained about low test scores , bad teachers , bilingual education hindering the progress of other students and campus violence but have been unable to move because of district red_tape and a policy encouraging parents to stay with neighborhood schools . Parents in some Orange County school districts also have been busy discussing how parental choice may change their schools . &quot; People here have been talking_about it since Proposition 174 ( mandating open enrollment ) was proposed , &quot; said Marilyn Buchi , a Fullerton Joint Union High_School District trustee . &quot; We ' ve had some choices before , but not this wide open . People like this. &quot; The school choice program is just getting underway in the Capistrano Unified School District , which serves 32 # 000 students . According to district spokeswoman Jacqueline Price , 6 % of the district ' s students have requested to go_to a school outside their neighborhood . She said that percentage is typical for large California school districts . Two schools , Aliso Niguel High in Aliso Viejo and the new John Malcom Elementary in Laguna Niguel , had more applicants than room . A lottery will be held to fill the openings . In the Santa Ana and Irvine school districts , where open enrollment has been in place for at least 10 years , the passage of the school choice law last fall was met almost with indifference . &quot; What we will need to do is simply remind our parents that they have that option and make_sure they ' re aware of the different programs being offered in many of our schools , &quot; said Diane Thomas , a spokeswoman for the Santa Ana Unified School District . In Los Angeles , even before school offices received the bulletin outlining the open enrollment rules , campuses began fielding calls from parents . Schools primarily on the Westside and in the west San Fernando Valley are drawing the most attention . Kristi Thomas , office manager at Tarzana Elementary School , said : &quot; The parents seem to know more about this than we at the schools know. &quot; That may be because parents have made the open enrollment season their game , analyzing test scores , class sizes , even racial balances in search of an ideal , or at least acceptable , school . One parent attended a school play one night recently to check_out the other parents . &quot; I ' m totally consumed by this whole_thing right now , &quot; said Janet DiMartino , a Sherman Oaks parent who is looking_at public and private_schools for her son . &quot; The range is just unbelievable. &quot; Nancy Broadsky , a parent from Encino , said : &quot; I ' ve gone_to a lot of meetings . I ' ve talked to five different principals . I ' ve gone_through the phone_book and every source that I can. &quot; She has even put_together her own comparative school guide highlighting the issues that are important to her : academic_program , athletics and enrichment programs . Principals say they are getting calls from parents whose children attend private_schools and who are now considering enrolling them in public_schools . DiMartino said she is treating public_school as a more serious option now that open enrollment is possible . The maze of enrollment policies and admission permits -- and the dearth of guiding information from the school district -- has left many parents frustrated . Some parents say they rely mostly on neighborhood rumor mills for information about one of the most important decisions they will make_for their children . &quot; You are_on your own and there is a great_deal of confusion , &quot; said Scott , the Miracle Mile mother . &quot; What I would like to see from the district -- although I am sure they will tell me there are a_million reasons why it can ' t be done -- is a single document , a guide that outlines all_the various ways you can go_to a school , from day-care permits to magnet schools. &quot; Parent frustrations likely will grow as the school shopping frenzy reaches_a_peak after May 16 , the day that schools will release their count of available slots and make applications available . Many of the schools that parents regard_as most_desirable will not have nearly enough space to satisfy demand . District officials say they have the solution . Rather than traditional waiting_lists , principals will hold lotteries to draw names of parents who want their children to attend a particular school . The state-mandated random drawings , scheduled for June 14 , will be monitored by a three-member committee : the principal , a teacher and a parent . But some highly sought-after schools may_not get_to the lottery stage . Principals at schools with high parent interest -- Carpenter Avenue Elementary in Studio City , Third Street Elementary in Hancock Park and Welby Way in Canoga Park -- say they likely will not have much space to begin with . The state law that ordered school districts to allow open enrollment gives first priority for space to students who live_in the neighborhood . Students who are bused for integration and to relieve overcrowding also have priority , along with students whose parents work or use day_care in the area . &quot; I ' m telling parents that the good news is there ' s open enrollment ; the bad news is we don ' t have space , &quot; said Joan Marks , the principal at Carpenter , where hundreds of parents typically show_up for orientation meetings . A few miles away , at Sherman Oaks Elementary School , Principal Ed Krojansky said he expects to have room for about 75 students . &quot; This school does have a reputation for having a high-quality program so I was not surprised by the level of interest , &quot; he said . &quot; We welcome it and we ' re ready. &quot; If the new enrollment policy is a boon to parents , it can also benefit schools . With more students , principals can hire more teachers , offer more classes and increase parent involvement . It also could improve morale . &quot; It gives us a nice boost that people are appreciating what we do , &quot; said Linda Pacheco , principal at Germain Street School in Northridge . Although some school_board members have hailed open enrollment as a major step_in education reform , others have expressed reservations . Board President Leticia Quezada said parents ' expectations have been raised too high and that excitement over the program could sour if parents are shut_out of their first choices . &quot; The crux of this issue will be what schools are_on the list and whether the available space matches the interest out_in the parent community , &quot; Quezada said . &quot; If they don ' t match , then we are going_to have a lot of frustrated parents out there and I really want to minimize that. &quot; Because the open enrollment policy does not guarantee bus transportation , Quezada and others said options for some parents could be limited . &quot; Unfortunately , parents in my district find themselves working two jobs . Often they don ' t have cars to even transport them to work , &quot; said Quezada , who represents parts of the Eastside and the northeast Valley . &quot; They really don ' t have a choice . Choice means nothing. &quot; Although district officials have estimated 50 # 000 openings in 500 schools , parents say they are skeptical about where those openings will be . &quot; The real question is : Is there really going_to be any spots for choice applications in the best schools , in the schools everyone cares about ? &quot; asked Susan Bernard , a Westside parent . &quot; It seems there is going_to be a lot of space , but where ? &quot; As board_member Julie Korenstein put it : &quot; I think it ' s going_to take at least a year before we see whether it was a real option or something on paper that just looked nice. &quot; The state law , authored by Assemblywoman Dede Alpert ( D-Coronado ) , directed all school districts to adopt similar open enrollment guidelines . The law was sparked by the school voucher movement that offered parents tax_credits to help offset private_school tuition . The policy does not apply to the magnet schools -- where enrollment is by districtwide lottery of applicants on lengthy waiting_lists -- or charter schools , which operate independently of district regulations .
