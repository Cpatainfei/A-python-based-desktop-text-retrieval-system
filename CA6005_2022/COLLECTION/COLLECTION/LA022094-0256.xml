   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; THE STREETS ARE LINED WITH SILVER ; ALPINE SKIING : COUNTERCULTURE FAMILY DISPLAYS AMERICAN FLAG AS DAUGHTER PICABO STREAKS TO SECOND PLACE IN DOWNHILL , GIVING U.S. YET ANOTHER MEDAL . SEIZINGER WINS GOLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The father , who dropped LSD with Timothy Leary , &quot; before it was illegal , &quot; who named one daughter Picabo Street and another Sunny Main , who almost moved to Canada during the Vietnam_War , who would n ' t look_out of place among the Grateful Dead , stood starry-eyed in the finish area Saturday with an American flag draped over his shoulders . &quot; This makes_up for all_the times I wasn ' t proud to be an American , &quot; Ron Street said . &quot; Today , I say , ' God Bless America. ' &quot; Picabo Street , his daughter , had won the Olympic silver medal in women ' s downhill at Kvitfjell . Imagine that . The hippy ' s little_girl . Street , from Sun Valley , Ida. , lost out on gold only because the world ' s top woman downhill racer , Germany ' s Katja Seizinger , brought her best stuff to Norway and posted an outstanding time of 1 minute 35.93 seconds . After Seizinger , who skied third , everyone else was racing for second . It was sweet redemption for Seizinger , 21 . Despite being named the international Alpine skier of the year for 1993 , she took a pounding in the German press after crashing in last week ' s Olympic super-G , a race she was favored to win . It also eased the pain of her fourth-place downhill finish at the Albertville Olympics two years ago . Street , at 1:36.59 , and Italian bronze medalist Isolde Kostner , at 1:36.85 , were the only other racers faster than 1:37 . With Street ' s performance , U.S. skiers have earned two golds and two silvers , and need only one more Alpine medal in the next eight days to match their most successful Olympics , the 1984 Games in Sarajevo , when skiers had three golds and two silvers . Street ' s success was somewhat of a surprise . She hasn ' t won a world circuit event in her two years on the tour . Her best finish was second in a combined event at last year ' s world championships in Japan . But her practice times here were excellent , including the day ' s best time in the final downhill run Friday . Still , she almost got_into trouble during the race . Street shot through the first_half of the run without a hitch but ran so fast into the tricky section called &quot; the corkscrew &quot; near the bottom that she got_ahead of herself in the gates and barely salvaged a jump . &quot; She really shanked it at the bottom , &quot; said Paul Major , the U.S. women ' s coach . &quot; She almost came_to a stop at the end of that one jump . If she hadn ' t had that , she ' d have been in there fighting for the gold. &quot; After the race , Picabo ' s freckle-faced grin was brighter than the snow . Three years after the U.S. ski team suspended her for insubordination , she had effectively proven wrong everyone who &quot; thought I was a dirt bag. &quot; As for the Street ' s family , well , their moon was in the seventh house . Picabo ' s mother , Dee -- who raised two children , chickens and rabbits and cooked 18 years on a wood stove in the Street ' s small two-bedroom home -- held court near the finish area and took_on the waves of reporters who wanted to know , real quick , &quot; How ' d Picabo get her name again ? &quot; Dee , a folk_singer and Joan Baez devotee , fielded questions with aplomb , explaining that Picabo , a small_town in Idaho , was an Nez Perce Indian word meaning &quot; shining waters , &quot; though later was changed to Silver Creek . Even better : Silver Creek wins silver . Baba , Picabo ' s older brother , removed his sunglasses at the race finish to show reporters a scar near his right eye that was caused when Picabo hurled a cup at him in anger when they were kids . &quot; I think it was over chores , who had to vacuum , &quot; Baba said . Baba ' s given named is Roland Wayne Street III , but father really wanted to name him Juan Way Street . Nearby , Stubby , 54 , recounted his reckless youth : how he failed in his first marriage ; how he used to hang_out at Berkeley with the acid-king , Leary , and how he got_in on the ground_floor of the &quot; psychedelic revolution. &quot; Reporter : &quot; So , you dropped acid ? &quot; Stubby : &quot; I thought everyone did . &quot; I ' m a pothead.But I ' ve never liked alcohol , tobacco and firearms . I ' ve always been down on those. &quot; The Streets certainly put a new twist on the classic American success story . Yet , theirs is a tale of inspiration and devotion . Dee and Stubby , who moved to Triumph , Ida. , from Reno , in the late ' 60s , have been married 27 years . They never left their children with baby sitters . Together , the family cooked and cleaned and traveled . Had it not been for laws , the children would have been schooled at_home . Though precocious and headstrong , Picabo comes from common_stock . She is not the spoiled-brat offspring of rich ski academy parents . Her father is a stone mason . The Streets gave their children room to stretch , to succeed and fail on_their_own . &quot; They ' d let us walk into things where they know we would hit the brick wall , &quot; Picabo said . &quot; Then they ' d pick us up , brush us off and say , ' On your way. ' &quot; Picabo once insisted on celebrating her parents ' wedding_anniversary , so her parents allowed her to drink herself sick on champagne , to_the_point , Picabo said , &quot; that I never wanted to drink again. &quot; Yet , within the loose framework of 1960s attitudes , there was moral base . The Streets were_well mannered and did their chores . &quot; It was ' please ' and ' thank_you , ' &quot; Picabo said . Still , there were many Picabo potholes on_the_road to success . Her temper and competitiveness were fierce . Picabo was the red-haired , red-faced terror of Triumph , a two-horse-hitch town ruled by Baba and his renegades . Picabo says she learned how to win by competing against the boys . &quot; I think that ' s what makes me as tough as I am , &quot; she said . Picabo followed Baba everywhere , into and out of trouble . &quot; Once , she threw a stick at me with a nail in it , and it hit me in the back , &quot; Baba said . &quot; I turned_around to chase her and she was gone. &quot; Through it all , though , family came first . When Street was shipped home from the U.S. ski team ' s summer_camp in 1990 , it greatly disappointed her parents . Eventually , she joined them in Hawaii , where her dad was working_on a construction project . Under his watchful eye , Picabo rededicated herself to training . &quot; My father set me straight , &quot; she said . &quot; I was wandering astray. &quot; Somehow , it all ended wrapped in an Olympic bow in Norway . The Streets did not always think ahead , but the path to the Olympic podium was_well rooted . At 10 , Picabo , already a top-notch ski racer , told her father she was going_to win an Olympic medal . &quot; We caught eyes , &quot; she said of the moment , &quot; and he realized I was serious. &quot; Picabo said a lot of things , but no one dared dash her dreams . In fact , a friend gave Stubby an American flag to hold_in Olympic escrow . &quot; He said , ' I ' ll give it to you as long as you display it if she ever gets there , ' &quot; Stubby said . The flag had been_on display for years in the Streets ' living room . Saturday , it was displayed on Stubby ' s back . He guessed there was more_than one right way to raise an Olympian . And a family .</TEXT>
