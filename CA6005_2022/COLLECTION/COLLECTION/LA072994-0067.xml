   <TEXT> In North_Korea , the sacred Mt . Paekdu mourned for Kim Il Sung , the dictator who ruled the country from 1948 until he died July 8 . A double rainbow signaled his death . Paying tribute , swallows hovered above statues of him scattered throughout the country . Such was the culmination , as reported by North_Korean media , of the cult_of_personality of Kim Il Sung , which the 82-year-old leader began building half a century ago with Soviet guidance after Josef Stalin picked him to lead the northern half of Korea . Now , the cult , the unquestioning obedience it produced and the country itself , with 1.1 million troops and nuclear_weapons capability , have been handed_over to Kim Jong Il , 52 , the reclusive eldest son of &quot; the Great Leader. &quot; Can it work for the son as it had for the father ? The answer may be no -- but in North_Korea , there are no definitive answers to questions of the future . In TV footage relayed to the world from the capital , Pyongyang , since Kim ' s fatal heart_attack , the world caught_a_glimpse of the Orwellian society that Kim Jong Il has inherited . Day after day , tens of thousands of citizens sobbed , wailed and flailed their arms in unison before a towering statue of the late Kim in central Pyongyang . Kim ' s longevity , the relative prosperity he initially created from the poverty left by 35 years of Japanese colonialism , and the fierce independence he established for Koreans whose intense nationalism borders_on xenophobia all were factors_in bolstering the cult . But fiction , not fact , was its base . According to the cult , it was Kim , not the United States , that defeated Japan and liberated Korea ; it was the United States , not he , who started the Korean_War . Even his name -- adopted from that of a romanticized guerrilla fighter of the past -- was fiction . Terrorist attacks staged over the years against South_Korea were never his doing , according to the fabrication . Rather , they were incidents staged by South_Koreans as plots in Seoul ' s own domestic political manipulations . Kim Il Sung-ism and the ideology of juche ( self-reliance ) -- taught in the schools , drilled into the minds of workers at factories and offices , and instilled in the armed forces -- found no contradictions . TV_sets in North_Korea receive only state broadcasts . Only single-channel radios are sold . No satellite dishes or foreign publications are found there . And in nearly half a century of national division , no mail , no phone_calls and virtually no contacts between ordinary citizens of North and South_Korea have been permitted . &quot; You have Christ . The Muslims have Allah . We have Kim Il Sung , &quot; Pyongyang officials reportedly told an American when asked about the leader ' s overwhelming persona . Farmers praised him for bountiful harvests . Mothers thanked him for the successful birth of children . In the only exchange of visits between relatives separated on both halves of the peninsula , a South_Korean Catholic bishop was told by his North_Korean sister : &quot; What do you mean by ' heaven ' ? This is heaven , where we are living with our Great Leader , Kim Il Sung ! &quot; Fantasies of the phenomenon of nature enforcing the righteousness of Kim found fertile ground in the mythology , shamanistic animism and superstition that remains deeply rooted in Korean culture , both North and South . Mt . Paekdu , for example , is where the nation ' s mythological founder , Dankun , descended to Earth to conceive the first Koreans in a union with a bear-turned-human . And in the myth North_Korea started building two decades ago for Kim Jong Il , Mt . Paekdu replaced Siberia as his birthplace . From ancient monarchy through Japanese colonial rule through Kim Il Sung ' s reign , North_Koreans have never been exposed to anything resembling freedom_of_speech or thought . Post-World War II American occupation troops introduced democracy to the South for the first time . Kim Jong Il ' s inheritance of his father ' s cult following appears certain to guarantee him , at least initially , a solid base of public support . The way was paved for his smooth ascension to power in the past three weeks -- contradicting predictions of some foreign analysts that the Great Leader ' s passing would precipitate a rebellion . But how long the cult will sustain Kim Jong Il is anybody ' s guess . Four days after his father ' s death , new propaganda started being churned_out for Kim Jong Il . The older_man ' s dying words , North_Korean media reported , were : &quot; Ask the people to unite and be loyal to Kim Jong Il as they were to me. &quot; Citing what it called an example of Kim Jong Il ' s &quot; humane love &quot; for his people , Radio Pyongyang last week quoted the new leader as saying , &quot; If the people want , I would plant flowers and make them bloom in rocks and pull stars from the sky. &quot; Children were composing essays and poems praising him . Woefully lacking the charisma of his father -- and Kim Il Sung ' s power to command authority -- short , chubby Kim Jong Il certainly won ' t find sustaining the cult as easy as his father did , said a Western diplomat , who asked not to be named . &quot; The apparatus can crank and puff all its wants to , but in the end , there has to be a wizard in Oz , &quot; the diplomat said . Kim Jong Il , however , hasn ' t even given a speech since he took_over the country ' s leadership . Indeed , he has never publicly given a speech as far as outsiders know . Kim Do Kyoung , research_director at the Lucky-Goldstar Research Institute here , said that , if Kim Jong Il is to stay around , he ' ll need to make some mark , something to feed the cult machine . &quot; Some degree of relief &quot; from four years of decline in the economy might do the trick , he said : &quot; If people are eating well , they will forgive a lot of other things. &quot; Only recently has news of the outside world started trickling into North_Korea -- mainly through China . Contacts at the countries ' common border are relatively unfettered , and North_Koreans have been able to sneak home pocket-size Chinese-made radios that open a crack to news of the outside world . Even if the cult falters , however , many outside analysts agree that a civilian uprising is highly unlikely . The ruling Workers Party ' s control of the society and the armed forces is too tight to allow unrest to erupt . But Han Sung Joo , South_Korea ' s foreign_minister , insists that North_Korea ' s new leaders will at least have to pay_attention to public sentiment . &quot; With his charisma and his stature , the late president could make_up for some of the serious economic difficulties . But a new leadership probably would be more vulnerable to a deterioration of the economic situation , &quot; he said . Members of the ruling group , who know what is going_on in South_Korea and the rest of the world , are unlikely to be swayed by the cult beyond the degree to which it helps them maintain power . They know , for example , the lie of the cult that teaches that South_Korea suffers in poverty as a vassal of the United States with its 37 # 000 troops here . ( South_Korea , with twice the population of the North , operates an economy 12 times the size of the North ' s. ) North_Korea ' s closed society , however , has rendered reading tea leaves a useless occupation . As Winston Lord , assistant secretary_of_state for Asia , said last week in Washington , &quot; If anyone gives you flat assurances or predictions or analyses of what ' s happening in North_Korea , immediately distrust him or her. &quot;</TEXT>
