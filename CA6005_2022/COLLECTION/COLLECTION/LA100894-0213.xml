   <HEADLINE> PARISHIONERS RELUCTANT TO ADMIT EATING ILLS TO CLERGY ; NUTRITION : RELIGIOUS GROUPS NEED TO LIFT VEIL OF SECRECY AROUND FOOD ABUSE AND TREAT IT AS A SERIOUS SPIRITUAL AND EMOTIONAL ISSUE , EXPERTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a graduate_student , Mary Louise Bringle would go_for days or weeks ingesting huge quantities of food , such_as whole bags of cookies or half gallons of ice_cream at a single sitting . Then , ridden with guilt , she would fast for an equal number of days on coffee and an occasional glass of diluted grapefruit_juice . She suffered leg and stomach cramps from abusing laxatives and diuretics . Yet in therapy with a pastoral counselor for five years , the theological student only mentioned her discomfort with food once . When the therapist responded that she was not fat , Bringle did not persist . &quot; Secrecy seemed , after all , the proper setting for such disgusting practices , &quot; she revealed in the recent issue of the Journal of Pastoral Care . Half of Americans regularly thank God before meals , but food is more often a curse than a blessing to millions with eating disorders . Caught within a culture that glorifies physical perfection and centuries of religious teachings warning of temptations of the flesh , they feast or fast in private . Although religious groups have begun to come_to grips with the sexual revolution -- elevating the goodness of sexuality even as they painfully struggle with the ground_rules -- food abuse remains the final taboo , some scholars and counselors say . &quot; We have so trivialized food issues that it is much easier for people to talk_about their sexual issues , &quot; said Bringle , now a professor of religious studies at St . Andrews Presbyterian College in Laurinburg , N.C. The problem is not hidden . On an average day , an estimated 65 million Americans are dieting , including 50 % to 80 % of fourth-grade girls and nearly two-thirds of female high_school students . As_many as a third of female college_students use laxatives , vomiting and diuretics to rid their bodies of unwanted food and weight , Bringle said in the journal article . But that does not mean the issue is out_in the open in sanctuaries . Kim Chernin , a Berkeley counselor who has written three books on eating disorders , says women will speak more easily to her about issues of incest and child_abuse than food abuse . &quot; There is a greater shame and sense of taboo about it , &quot; she said . &quot; Every one of them feels as if it is unique to them. &quot; From a religious standpoint , the secrecy seems understandable . Since early times , there has been a tendency in Western Christianity to distrust the body as the locus of temptation , lust , pain and mortality , according to Bringle , author of &quot; The God of Thinness : Gluttony and Other Weighty Matters. &quot; &quot; No wonder so many women among us feel deeply ashamed of our bodies ; no wonder so many of us get caught_up in vicious_cycles of compulsive eating to swallow the shame , and compulsive dieting to do penance for the excesses of our fallen flesh , &quot; said Bringle , who speaks from the experience of someone who spent 30 years as a compulsive eater , and six years as a full-fledged bulimic . The first thing religious groups need to do is lift the veil of secrecy around food abuse , and treat it as a serious spiritual and emotional issue rather than a problem of vanity , Bringle and Chernin say . Religious_leaders should then encourage women to follow the biblical injunction to glorify God in their body by learning to appreciate the many sizes and shapes of human_bodies and enjoying food as a divine gift . Bringle says one way some Christian dieting programs fall_off the religious scale is by encouraging compulsive dieting to reach a cultural ideal that love and acceptance come from a model-like figure . &quot; It ' s as much making a god of the belly -- the flat belly -- as it is to ingest tremendous amounts of food , &quot; she said . For all its tortured history regarding elements of the body , Christian tradition offers a rich resource for a healthier attitude toward food , according to Bringle and Chernin . Even John_Calvin -- hardly the faith ' s most noted hedonist -- created a category of &quot; legitimate enjoyment &quot; of the blessings of the world , Bringle points_out . According to a December , 1993 , Gallup Poll , slightly more_than half of Americans always or frequently say grace or give_thanks to God before meals . An additional 34 % occasionally say grace before meals . Recovering the profound theological meaning of grace by treating it as a shared celebration of God ' s gift of food rather than as a perfunctory exercise can go_a_long_way toward treating the shame and guilt of eating disorders , which flourish in private , according to Chernin and Bringle . &quot; If we started making our spiritual and religious celebrations around food . . . we would certainly have changed our idea of food as sinful and shameful to a celebration of a collective sense of the spirit of God , &quot; Chernin said .</TEXT>
