   <HEADLINE> ' CREDIT SCORING ' MAY DETERMINE IF YOU GET LOAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How you fare with your next home mortgage_application could hinge_on your performance on a complex mathematical test you ' ve never heard of , never taken and probably will never see on paper . It ' s called &quot; credit scoring , &quot; and it ' s one of the hottest -- if least publicized -- developments under way this year in the home mortgage market . Your credit score could convince a lender to give you a mortgage on excellent terms -- despite obvious blotches on your credit record that would have drawn an automatic rejection in the past . But the reverse could happen as well : You could find yourself turned_down for a mortgage that your lender would n ' t have thought_twice about before credit scoring . What ' s this all about ? What are its implications for you as an applicant ? Here ' s a quick overview : Mortgage lenders are under increasing pressure from federal regulators to squeeze every bit of potential bias out of their application evaluations . They ' re also discovering they can increase business and profits by more accurately identifying the combinations of characteristics of their customers that produce the highest risk of default and foreclosure . To achieve both objectives , lenders are quietly turning_to statistical models of borrower behavior that predict who ' s likely to be a problem , and who ' s not . The models often are based on extensive computer analyses of samples of the lender ' s existing or prior customers . They highlight the combinations of risk factors that &quot; matter &quot; in a statistical sense -- which may be different from those that matter in traditional , face-to-face underwriting . Then they assign numerical values to the risk factors to create a test for measuring new applicants . * Your credit score might run anywhere from zero to 1 # 000 . It ' s what you get when your specific set of characteristics -- your income , marital_status , length of employment , number of jobs held , installment_debt payment history , length of time in your present house and other factors -- are run_through the statistical model . It ' s the composite you : Sliced , diced and stacked_up as a potential borrower against the lender ' s real-life experiences with everybody else . So what if your monthly debt-to-income ratios are higher than the 28 % or 33 % allowed by traditional cookie-cutter underwriting standards ? So what if you ' re only able to put_up a small down_payment ? Those factors may_not be crucial . The credit-scoring model may reveal instead that you ' re a solid risk overall . You can handle the load -- at least statistically . The mortgage company would be turning_down good business if it sent you out the door . &quot; It ' s potentially a very powerful tool for evaluating individuals in an objective way , &quot; said Thomas M . Holloway , director of risk analysis for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp . ( Freddie Mac ) . Holloway and two colleagues recently studied a cross-section of 10 # 000 loans from Freddie Mac ' s vast portfolio . They examined what each borrower looked_like as an applicant across the table , and applied a credit scoring analysis to each . Then they checked how the borrower performed on payments . Their conclusion : Credit scoring works . Had Freddie Mac used such a test when the loans were made , it would have avoided lots of subsequent headaches with default-prone applicants . The company now plans to begin a series of pilot_programs with mortgage bankers and other lenders around the country later in the year . * Credit-scoring technology will allow far quicker decisions on applicants . Local lenders will be able to transmit basic financial data by computer to Freddie Mac , and get yes or no decisions within minutes by computer . A yes will mean that the applicant passes muster as a credit risk , and that Freddie Mac will likely buy the loan from the originating lender . Credit scoring has been available for years , but traditionally has been used by retail and consumer_credit providers -- department_stores , sellers of major appliances and banks offering credit_cards . Using scores supplied by credit_bureaus like TRW or Equifax , they ' ve been able to make quick , relatively accurate decisions on whether to extend credit to an applicant or not . Mortgage lenders , by contrast , have relied almost exclusively on underwriting standards that combine objective tests -- like debt-to-income ratios -- with more subjective , person-to-person evaluations . The latter , however , have stirred charges of racial , ethnic , gender and age discrimination recently . Commercial_banks and mortgage bankers are now being investigated and sued by regulators if they reject disproportionate numbers of minorities at the mortgage_application stage . Credit scoring for the mortgage field is growing fast because &quot; it ' s objective , it ' s colorblind and it ' s based on factors you can demonstrate to anybody are statistically linked to borrower performance , &quot; said Joy G . Witherspoon , an executive with Atlanta , Ga.-based MDS , a consulting_firm that creates credit-scoring models . Where ' s the potential downside to widespread , automated credit scoring in mortgage underwriting ? To the extent that it draws heavily on data supplied by credit_bureaus , there ' s the possibility that outdated or uncorrected information in your computer_file could foul_up your overall score . If the lender didn ' t incorporate some form of direct , person-to-person follow-up -- and Freddie Mac says it plans to -- you might be shot_down electronically before your application even gets_off_the_ground .</TEXT>
