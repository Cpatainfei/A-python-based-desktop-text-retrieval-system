   <HEADLINE> COLLISION IGNITES OIL_TANKER IN TURKISH STRAIT ; 15 KILLED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Firefighters fought an oil_tanker fire in Istanbul ' s Bosporus Strait on Monday after a late-night collision with a freighter killed at least 15 seamen and choked one of the world ' s busiest shipping lanes , officials said . Sixteen other crew_members from the two ships were missing , and there seemed little hope of finding survivors from the inferno that ripped through the tanker Nassia and the Shipbroker , a cargo_ship , Sunday night.Both flew the Cypriot flag . The accident was the worst in the Bosporus since a 1979 collision when an oil_tanker exploded , killing 43 seamen . Officials said the 19-mile strait will stay closed to shipping until all hazards from the collision have been cleared . Turkey , worried about environmental risks , unveiled new safety rules for the strait in January and will enforce them beginning July 1 . Ankara wants to ensure that expanded exports of oil and gas from the former Soviet_Union reach Europe via projected pipelines across Turkey to the Mediterranean , not through the Bosporus .</TEXT>
