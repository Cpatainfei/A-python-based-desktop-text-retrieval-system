   <HEADLINE> GLOBOCARS : THE NEXT CENTURY ; LATIN_AMERICAN PRODUCERS PUT PEDALS TO METAL ; NO COUNTRY IN THE REGION HAS A MASS MARKET YET . BUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY IS BOOMING AS NEVER BEFORE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Abram Boczkowski wanted a new car , so he joined &quot; the plan , &quot; a national sales lottery , hoping that his number -- and his car -- would come_up in the monthly drawing . Just for the opportunity to buy , he had to pledge to make monthly payments of $ 300 for five years . And if his number didn ' t come_up , he ' d still have to keep making them . Lottery systems such_as Argentina ' s remain a popular way to buy a car in a region where demand outruns supply and often-rampant inflation has discouraged long-term loans typical in the United States and elsewhere . Boczkowski was not lucky . &quot; I waited 15 months and didn ' t win the draw , &quot; said the 67-year-old accountant with sparse gray hair and wire-rimmed glasses . So he opted for the monthly bid , another variation on the plan . Bidders offer to pay , in a lump sum , any number of their monthly payments . &quot; I offered $ 8 # 000 for them to deliver the car to me , &quot; Boczkowski said . &quot; If someone else offered $ 9 # 000 , the car would be delivered to him. &quot; But Boczkowski ' s turned_out to be the winning bid . Now he was in the paperwork department of the Serra Lima auto agency , making his payment and filling_out forms . Whether through &quot; the plan &quot; or standard purchase programs such_as bank loans , now increasingly available as inflation subsides , Argentines and other Latin_Americans are buying more cars , boosting the importance and potential of the automobile in this region of 450 million people . While economic development and living standards have yet to reach levels that would give any Latin_American country a mass market , the automobile_industry is booming as never before . Last year , Brazilian and Argentine manufacturers produced record numbers of vehicles . Mexico had a record 1992 . Volkswagen , Ford , General Motors and Fiat manufacture complete cars in Brazil . Ford , VW , Renault , Fiat and Peugeot do so in Argentina . In Mexico it ' s Ford , GM , Chrysler , Nissan and VW . In some_other Latin_American countries , including Chile , multinational companies assemble cars from imported components . Trade_barriers have been lowered , opening the door to more imports and exports . With free-market reforms and less customs protection , Latin_American auto industries have had to become more competitive , and many car prices have been reduced . Bank credit is more accessible to buyers . If prices keep dropping , and purchasing power keeps rising , automotive analysts foresee years of expansion in manufacturing and sales . Here is a brief survey of Latin_America ' s Big Three auto markets : * In 1987 , when Latin_American economies were slogging through a deep slump , Brazil ' s vehicle production ( cars , trucks and buses ) plunged to barely 600 # 000 a year , about half the historic peak of the late 1970s . All Brazilian car_makers were hit hard , and the two largest joined forces to survive . In both Brazil and Argentina , the manufacturing subsidiaries of Ford and Volkswagen merged to form a new automotive giant , Autolatina . Autolatina went_through a bumper-to-bumper overhaul -- scaling_down staffs , renewing machinery and unifying assembly processes . Its current work_force -- 47 # 000 in Brazil and 7 # 000 in Argentina -- is 30 % thinner than seven years ago . Last year , the slump seemed like distant history . Brazil produced a record 1.4 million vehicles ( Autolatina 550 # 000 ) . Exports ran more_than 20 % of total automotive output . Brazilian manufacturers say their early reports show 1993 production will put Brazil in 10th place among world auto_makers , up from 14th in the mid-1980s and ahead of Italy and Mexico . By the year 2000 , industry leaders predict , they will sell 2 million units . Free-market reforms since 1990 have pried open Brazil ' s closed economy , lifting bans on imported cars and gradually reducing duties . Competition has forced all companies to begin voluntary retirement_programs to reduce the labor_force . Industry employment has been slashed from 158 # 000 in 1986 to 119 # 500 . Brazil is a long way from putting a car in every garage . This country of 150 million people has about 15 million vehicles , including buses and trucks . But even that number has created severe environmental problems . Greater Sao Paulo , the only Brazilian city where atmospheric pollution is systematically measured , has 3.5 million cars for 16.5 million inhabitants -- and a sky blackened with exhaust . Belatedly , Brazil began introducing pollution-control methods in 1988 , concentrating_on the engines and exhaust_systems of light vehicles , which contribute 80 % of the carbon_monoxide emissions . By 1997 , if further planned controls are implemented , Brazil will achieve the U.S. standards in_force in 1983 . * Mexico ' s industry is rapidly moving from a domestic to a hemispheric focus . Auto_makers are refitting their old plants around Mexico_City to make them more competitive by international standards . By 1984 , Mexico was making 2.4 million engines a year -- most of them for export , because the country produced only 357 # 000 finished vehicles . Soon afterward , companies built modern assembly_plants near the U.S. border to manufacture cars for export . Today , autos are second only to oil in Mexican industry , accounting_for 2.4 % of the gross_domestic_product and 9.6 % of manufacturing . About 457 # 000 Mexicans , one of every seven factory_workers , are employed in some phase of auto making . Last year , auto_makers were allowed to import fully assembled foreign cars for the first time in three decades , and that opening will continue under the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , which went_into effect Jan . 1 . By 1998 , Mexico will be required to lift all restrictions on imports of new cars made in North_America , and by 2019 all North_American used cars must be allowed into the country as well . Auto_makers are already producing for a unified North_American market by shifting production among plants in the United States , Canada and Mexico . Mexico ' s domestic auto sales reached a record high in 1992 . The 1993 recession , combined with tougher tax rules for company cars , put a damper on sales , but some middle-class consumers are still able to buy economical , compact models that sell for about 10 % to 30 % more_than U.S. retail . The Volkswagen Beetle is still king of the road in Mexico , not only because of the low price but also for the company ' s creative financing schemes . VW runs a lottery like the plan in Argentina . About 5 million automobiles in Mexico_City are responsible_for 70 % of the metropolitan area ' s choking air_pollution . City-sponsored awareness campaigns encourage people to drive less , but overcrowded buses and subways are not appealing alternatives . * When the government opened the_Argentine market to auto imports , local auto_makers groaned . &quot; We weren ' t accustomed to competition , &quot; said Rodolfo Ceretti , a longtime Ford executive . &quot; Now we are getting accustomed. &quot; One in every four cars bought by Argentines today is an import . &quot; It ' s a threat , but it is a challenge to be efficient , &quot; Ceretti said . Indeed , Argentina ' s total vehicle production -- including cars , trucks , utility vehicles and buses -- rose from 99 # 600 in 1990 , in the depths of a long economic_crisis , to a record 342 # 000 in 1993 . Argentina , with a population of 33 million , is the smallest Latin_American country with a full-scale auto industry . One strategy for efficiency has been mergers . Argentina ' s Fiat and Peugeot manufacture jointly , as do Ford and VW in Autolatina , the Brazilian-Argentine joint_venture . General Motors , which left Argentina more_than a decade ago , is coming_back to join the_Argentine subsidiary of Renault in the manufacture of pickups and is expected to get_back into building cars . That would give GM manufacturing interests in both Argentina and Brazil , something that Ford , VW and Fiat already have -- a cross-border presence . By combining to produce for both markets , car plants on both sides of the border cut costs by producing vehicles in larger quantities . Mercosur , an economic integration project scheduled to take full effect at the end of this year , will combine the markets of Argentina , Brazil , Uruguay and Paraguay . &quot; With integration with Brazil , it has become necessary for all companies there or here to be_on both sides , &quot; said Dasso of the Assn . of Automotive Factories . Argentine auto_makers are also reaching for a piece of the global market . Argentine-made Uno motors , for example , are exported to Fiat in Italy . Argentina ' s total automotive exports were valued at $ 800 million in 1993 , up from $ 167 million in 1990 . The national market is also expected to keep growing . With 6 million cars in the country , industry planners calculate that a 10-year replacement cycle will require 600 # 000 new cars a year , 258 # 000 more_than the record production of 1993 . Growth will add_to urban air_pollution , but breezy Buenos Aires has natural defenses . Widespread use of natural_gas as automobile fuel also helps . More_than 250 # 000 vehicles , mostly taxis heavily concentrated in Buenos Aires , run_on clean-burning gas . * Times staff writer Juanita Darling in Mexico_City and special correspondent Mac Margolis in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this report .
