   <TEXT> * * * * &quot; Up at Minton ' s , &quot; Stanley Turrentine , Blue_Note . This two-CD set , recorded in 1961 at the famed Harlem jazz spot , documents a jazz style that , sadly , is rapidly disappearing.Turrentine , who grew_up revering Don Byas and Earl Bostic and then went_on to play with Max Roach , incorporates the complexities of be-bop , the assured drive of swing and the comfort and familiarity of the blues into a singular approach . This music cooks . Turrentine , guitarist Grant Green , pianist Horace Parlan and their rhythm team investigate &quot; Broadway &quot; and &quot; Love for_Sale &quot; at brisk paces , their resilient and accessible statements flowing like a river : smooth and relaxed here , charged and forceful there . The slower tunes -- &quot; Come Rain or Come Shine , &quot; among them -- are equally compelling . Albums are rated on a scale of one star ( poor ) , two stars ( fair ) , three stars ( good , recommended ) , four stars ( excellent ) . Five-star ratings are reserved for classic reissues .
