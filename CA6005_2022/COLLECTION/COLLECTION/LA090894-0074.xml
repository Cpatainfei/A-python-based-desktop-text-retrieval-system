   <HEADLINE> SUMMER FOOD ; GARDEN FRESH ; AN EGGPLANT PALETTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s as though Mother Nature created her collection of eggplants as an art_school assignment : sensuous teardrops , curvy bells , curlicued crescents , noble globes , sleek egg shapes , slinky snakes , plump spindles , fluted spheres and flawless orbs . The palette and finish are from the pots and kilns of a Chinese enamel works : moon white , primrose yellow , celadon , jade , vermillion , violet , pink and purple dark as midnight . And , of course , all fruits are capped with stars of green leaves that cling -- when you lift them , the skin beneath is pale as ivory . The large globes of European eggplants are elegant enough for a dinner_party centerpiece ; try them with curly parsley and cabbage roses . But Mother Nature was in a giddy mood when she created eggplants for Asia , merrily pulling globes into pendulous shapes , making look-alikes of peas , plums , grapes , ruffled tomatoes , and eggs of turtles , hens and dinosaurs . As compensation for her pranks , she made the taste of Asian eggplants most appealing . Long , skinny , inky-colored ones ( commonly called Japanese ) , luminous purples ( commonly called Chinese ) and long Thai green eggplants have thinner skin , mild flavor , fine flesh and few seeds . Egg-shaped Asian varieties are particularly tender . The flesh of all these can be used in any recipe calling_for the common globe eggplant . Perhaps the best way to appreciate the silvery nutted flavor of slender eggplants is to eat them raw , a pleasing addition to crudites . Slice them crosswise 1 / 8-inch thick , then submerge the slices ( weight with a plate ) in cold water salted to taste . Soak four to five minutes , drain and repeat . The flesh and rim of color are crisped and brightened . Drain the slices and heap in a pretty dish . They won ' t discolor for a_couple_of hours . * To roast whole Asian eggplants , pierce , then roast on a dish at 400 degrees until thoroughly tender , 20 to 25 minutes , turning once or twice . Roasted slender eggplants are easily turned_into Mediterranean treats . Mash with olive_oil and lemon_juice and serve spread on crackers at room_temperature . Or slice in half lengthwise and accompany with strips of roasted sweet red_peppers , dark olives and hunks of feta cheese as a first course . Or cut_in chunks and toss with ribbons of basil , minced red chilies and olive_oil as a sauce for pasta . About frying eggplant : Eggplant absorbs oil like a sponge -- a pound can pull_in almost 2 / 3 cup . However , when the flesh is salted for 30 to 60 minutes , then drained , rinsed and dried , the same pound will absorb only a quarter cup of oil in frying . But you don ' t have to add salt and oil to a low-sodium , nonfat vegetable . I get creamy-on-the-inside crispy-on the-outside pieces of eggplant using my trusty , heavy non-stick skillet . First steam the eggplant whole . Bring to a boil an inch or so of water in the skillet ( or use any other vessel you like ) . Set a round cake rack in it and lay the slender eggplants on the rack . Cover the skillet with a tall , close-fitting lid , lower the heat just enough so steam curls out , and steam until tender , about 15 minutes . Now cut the eggplant into any shape you like -- small chunks probably work best . Empty out the water , wipe the skillet dry , heat over high heat , add the chunks and brown over medium-high heat , turning gently . It takes only a_few minutes . * Eggplants are highly perishable , and those you grow will be incomparable . They ' re also among the easiest and most ornamental of crops for the mixed border . Most Asian eggplants grow only two to three feet tall , although the bushes of some cultivars can be thorny . The flowers are lavender bells , and sometimes the leaves are striped with lavender . No matter where you live , start seeds indoors about two months before the soil will be warm and the weather settled . Eggplants love heat from the start . Germinate the seeds in moist paper_towels in a plastic bag kept at 80 to 90 degrees . A gas_oven with a pilot_light and the door ajar is ideal , the top of the water_heater is the next best place . Grow the germinated seeds in three-inch pots with soil mix kept at 70 degrees . Plant in full sun in ultra-rich soil ( lots of compost and manure dug_in ) . If you have eggplant pests , cover after transplanting with a floating row cover . Fertilize monthly with half kelp solution and half fish emulsion , and water so the plants never dry_out . When the plant is a foot tall , mulch well . Using snips , pick fruits while they are still brilliantly glossy and are smaller than described in the catalogue . Use as soon as possible . If you lack space , eggplants are ideal subjects for containers . Grow each plant in a three-gallon container . * To choose from a dazzling array of eggplants and to support a good cause , join the Seed Savers Exchange -- in their yearbook you ' ll find eggplants native to Turkey , Thailand , Ghana , Bolivia , Hawaii , Puerto Rico , Laos and from the Hmong people of Vietnam . Beyond their beauty of form and flavor , Asian eggplants have a little-known virtue . A 5th-Century book from China tells us that women of the imperial court used dye made from black eggplant skins to stain their teeth a gun-metal gray , which was then given a high gloss with polishing . Dame fashion was ever a hard taskmistress . Sources : * Fresh at Asian and Latino markets . * Seeds of Chinese , Japanese and Thai eggplants from Evergreen Y.H.
