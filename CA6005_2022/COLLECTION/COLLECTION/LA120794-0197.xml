   <HEADLINE> JOYOUS REUNION FOR MOTHER , CHILD ; FBI , RUSSIAN AGENCY JOIN FORCES TO RESCUE GIRL 11 MONTHS AFTER ABDUCTION FROM L.A.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Her boyfriend said he was taking her 2-year-old daughter on a birthday visit to Disneyland . Instead , Nataliya Kaminskaya ' s little_girl began an international odyssey nearly a year ago when she was kidnaped to Russia from her Los Angeles home . On Tuesday , the FBI disclosed that Monique Michelle was rescued by its counterpart in Moscow -- Russian MVD agents helping to enforce a new U.S. law that prohibits international parental abductions . The toddler played_at her mother ' s feet and sang nursery_rhymes in Russian as the 38-year-old Kaminskaya thanked FBI_agents at their Westwood headquarters and observed : &quot; So many things have changed in Russia. &quot; Suspected kidnaper Michael Belakovsky , a Russian businessman who had been running an import company in the Hollywood area , will be extradited to the United States under the new law . He could face both federal and state charges , officials said . &quot; This law became effective three weeks before Monique ' s abduction , &quot; said Charlie Parsons , special_agent in_charge of the FBI ' s Los Angeles office . &quot; This is the very first indictment under this statute. &quot; A federal grand_jury unanimously indicted Belakovsky , 63 , although he is not the girl ' s father , Parsons said . The kidnaping apparently &quot; wasn ' t for the love of the child , but to harm the mother , &quot; he said . Neither he nor the mother would identify the child ' s father or disclose any specific motive for the abduction . Kaminskaya , a hairdresser who has lived_in this country for three years , said she and Belakovsky had been friends for several months before Monique ' s disappearance last Dec . 29 . She said Belakovsky would sometimes baby-sit the girl . She said she called a private_investigator after the abduction and toyed_with the idea of asking_for help from the famed Israeli intelligence agency , the Mossad , before a friend urged her to contact the FBI . &quot; My friend said , ' We ' ve lived_in America many years , we have to believe_in them , ' &quot; Kaminskaya explained . * Kaminskaya feared the worst when Belakovsky wrote and warned : &quot; You ' ll never see your baby again , never. ' &quot; The Russian MVD -- short for Ministry of Internal Affairs -- took_up the case in July when FBI Director Louis J . Freeh visited Moscow to meet with the ministry ' s organized crime office . Belakovsky was arrested Nov . 23 . Although no extradition treaty exists between the United States and Russia , authorities here voiced confidence that he will soon be returned . &quot; This represents one of the first tangible results of our new relationship with Russian law_enforcement , &quot; Parsons said . But it ' s unlikely to be the last . Next week , Parsons said , the FBI is launching its own &quot; Russian organized crime squad &quot; to investigate crimes ranging from money-laundering to murder for hire among the estimated 500 # 000 Russian immigrants living_in the Los Angeles area , he said . &quot; We ' re trying to learn from our experience . In the 1930s , law_enforcement was very slow to attack the Cosa Nostra , &quot; he said . At the time of her rescue , Monique was living_in Cyprus with Belakovsky ' s girlfriend , investigators said . Well cared_for during the 11 months , she was reunited with her mother and her 15-year-old sister , Stella , on Friday . Russian-speaking FBI_agent Pakala Bennett escorted her home from Cyprus . Kaminskaya said Monique will celebrate her third birthday Dec . 31 . &quot; I ' ll cook a big cake , &quot; she said . And there won ' t be any Disney characters on top , either . &quot; I ' ll put the three letters on it . FBI. &quot;</TEXT>
