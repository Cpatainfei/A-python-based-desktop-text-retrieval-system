   <HEADLINE> BORIS AND THE BIG FIVE ; INTERESTING IF VAGUE IDEAS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS CONTROL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Creative and intriguing &quot; was the way Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , summed_up Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s proposal for a treaty among the five big nuclear_powers to reduce their arsenals and more tightly control fissionable material . Yes , but what about practical ? At first glance it ' s hard to imagine circumstances under which China , Britain and France , the other members of the club , would agree to scrap any significant portion of their nuclear arsenals . If nothing else , a stockpile of such weapons is regarded_as affirming a country ' s claim to be a major player in global affairs and so as something to be jealously guarded . But first glances seldom provide a full picture . Maybe as the missing details of Yeltsin ' s idea are filled_in it will begin to look more feasible . The more immediately appealing parts of Yeltsin ' s proposal , made in an address to the U.N. General_Assembly , have to do with halting the production of material for nuclear_weapons and banning the recycling of warhead material from dismantled missiles . These at least partially address growing concerns over weapons-grade nuclear products being dispersed to countries with secret agendas for becoming nuclear_powers . Again , Yeltsin offered no specifics . But here certainly is an area where the five major nuclear_powers should try quickly to seek accord , in the interest of a safer world for all_of them .</TEXT>
