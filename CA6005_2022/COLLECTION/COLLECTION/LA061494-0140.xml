   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; LIFE AFTER THE REBBE A PUZZLE ; CHABAD ' S FUTURE IS CLOUDED BY THE DEATH OF THE MAN SOME THOUGHT WAS THE MESSIAH . HOW IT COPES WITHOUT ITS LEADER WILL SHAPE FATE OF THE ORTHODOX JEWISH SECT AND ITS VAST FUND-RAISING AND SOCIAL_SERVICE NETWORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Can Chabad Outlive the Rebbe ? &quot; asked the headline in a recent edition of a leading Jewish journal , as the 92-year-old leader of one of Judaism ' s most aggressive and charismatic sects lay comatose in a New York hospital . After the death Sunday of Menachem Mendel Schneerson , the seventh leader , or rebbe , of the Chabad Lubavitch movement , that question is at_hand . At stake is the future of an organization that Schneerson personally transformed in his 44 years of leadership from a provincial sect into what Allen Nadler , an expert on the group ' s activities , describes as the &quot; most famous and powerful movement in contemporary Orthodox Judaism. &quot; Hinging_on the future ideological and political course of the movement is the exploitation of millions of dollars in real_estate holdings and the fate of an extensive network of schools , synagogues and such social programs as drug rehabilitation centers . What happens may depend_on how Chabad as_a_whole comes_to terms with Schneerson ' s death . Chabad claims more_than 250 # 000 members in more_than 30 countries , although outside observers call that an overstatement and place the number of adherents at as little as 25 # 000 . Thousands of non-members contribute to Chabad programs , including a highly publicized annual telethon in Los Angeles , worship at its synagogues and support its political and social initiatives . The group has played a significant role in recent Israeli politics and lobbies forcefully in Washington on behalf of its social_welfare activities . Schneerson ' s speeches and sermons are the core of an enormous recorded library and are regularly broadcast across the globe on radio and satellite TV . Chabad also sponsors a large fund-raising network whose benefactors include leading Jewish families and business people , smaller contributors and government programs . Its annual budget_for charitable enterprises and missionary activities among fellow Jews has been estimated at $ 100 million . The budget_for its Los Angeles outpost alone is more_than $ 16 million , according to its leader , Schneerson disciple Rabbi Boruch Shlomo Cunin . But the rebbe ' s illness -- he suffered a stroke in 1992 and spent the last few months in a coma -- provoked a major crisis within the sect as its other top leaders split over issues ranging from the proper medical_care due Schneerson to the movement ' s theological direction . Some sources say the resulting uncertainty has cut substantially into the group ' s charitable receipts . But Chabad ' s problems are rooted in the increasingly Messianic character the sect assumed in recent years , with many adherents going so far as_to identify Schneerson himself as the Messiah -- and thus possibly immortal . This belief not only conflicted with mainstream Jewish views of the nature of the Messiah , but established an obvious hurdle for the organization ' s continuity after his death . By Chabad practice , only Schneerson could appoint a successor , as he was appointed in 1951 by his father-in-law , the previous rebbe . He died without naming an heir , although many believe that he has left a will . The rebbe ' s passing without his revelation as the Messiah would be &quot; such a devastating blow that a majority of people would never recover , &quot; Rabbi Shlomo Schwartz , a former Chabad chaplain at UCLA who broke_with Cunin ' s organization but not with Chabad , said in an interview shortly before Schneerson ' s death . * The only appropriate successor would have to be &quot; somebody with unbelievable talent to have the allegiance of 200 # 000 people -- doctors , lawyers , Indian_chiefs , people in the entertainment_industry , &quot; Schwartz said . &quot; There ' s no one who has all his facets in one person. &quot; In an interview Monday , Cunin himself gave no indication that his faith has been rocked by Schneerson ' s death . &quot; We believe the Messiah is coming any day , &quot; he said . &quot; We believe the dead will come_back to life . Our belief in both of these is completely in place . The rebbe has his people in_charge all_over the world. &quot; Asked if a successor would be named , Cunin said : &quot; No , not from the way I see it . He ' s still with us. &quot; But other observers say that even if it survives in some form , Chabad cannot help but be seriously shaken by the passing of its charismatic leader . &quot; Some people will leave the movement , maybe even a majority , but some will become more dedicated , &quot; said Menachem Friedman , an expert in ultra-Orthodox sects at Hebrew University in Jerusalem . &quot; One can ' t be sure to which side the future belongs . But death is never a major obstacle to dedicated believers in a Messiah ; see Christianity. &quot; For all that , Schneerson ' s leadership -- even critics acknowledged his charisma and strong personal presence -- was key to the group ' s growth and influence . He gave the organization its mission of preserving and glorifying Jewish identity in the face of modern pressure to assimilate -- a message with appeal even to the assimilated , whose contributions help fill the coffers of Chabad Lubavitch . ( &quot; Chabad &quot; is an acronym from the Hebrew for wisdom , understanding and knowledge ; Lubavitch is the Lithuanian hamlet where the sect began. ) &quot; Until the last crisis ( of the rebbe ' s illness ) , they found getting financing easy among people concerned about intermarriage and the possibility of Jewishness disappearing from the modern American world , &quot; said Friedman . &quot; Chabad was fighting that much better than any other Jewish organization , so people concerned about it were donating to Chabad. &quot; Ironically , he said , Chabad was unique among Orthodox groups in its willingness to broadcast its message over the very technological advances that characterized the menacing modern_world , including satellite television . Adherents , supporters , or the merely curious could engage Chabad members over the Internet , the global network of computer users . &quot; Traditionally , the Jewish Messiah ushers_in a new era of universal peace and knowledge of God , rebuilds the Temple in Jerusalem , and restores exiles to Israel , &quot; said Allen Nadler , an expert in Jewish_orthodoxy at the Yivo Institute in New York . &quot; Chabad ' s Messianism shows a lot of American Christian influences . In fact , the very way the Lubavitchers deliver their message is very similar in technique and form to our fundamentalist and evangelical Christians in their use of TV , brochures and missionaries. &quot; Over the years , Schneerson and his followers and supporters rarely shrank_from employing his tremendous authority on behalf of their goals in politics . Among the group ' s most controversial steps was its agitation in support of a change in Israel ' s Law of Return , which grants citizenship to all Jews returning to the country . Chabad in 1989 tried to force an amendment to the law denying citizenship to those who had been converted by rabbis in the Conservative and Reform_movements . The campaign eventually failed , although it has remained a source of resentment among Reform and Conservative Jews . Schneerson , who never visited Israel himself , also spoke out against the Camp David peace accords and against Israeli government policies he interpreted as relinquishing Israeli territory . * On occasion his authority was pressed into service for other ends . Last year , Australian and American securities regulators suspended trading in shares of Great Central Mines , an Australian gold and diamond mining concern , amid indications that the rebbe himself was indirectly behind the stock ' s tripling in price -- to $ 14 , from just under $ 5 -- in the month after its debut in U.S. trading . The company ' s chairman , Joseph L . Gutnick , a major contributor to Chabad , used a video featuring Schneerson as part of his pitch to new American investors . The video showed the rebbe apparently pointing to a map of the Greater Nabberu region of Australia , where Gutnick contended the company was about to make a major strike . Gutnick also said publicly that the rebbe had &quot; assured &quot; him &quot; both publicly and privately that I will be involved with major discoveries in both gold and diamonds. &quot; But Great Central ' s own joint_venture partner on the Nabberu mine downplayed its potential . In the end , the company itself withdrew from all diamond mining in the region , and the stock price settled_down . It closed Monday at $ 7.125 in NASDAQ trading . It was Schneerson ' s potent personal authority that gave Chabad followers a strength of conviction that critics said sometimes has manifested itself as an inclination to run_roughshod over opponents -- an end-justifies-the-means approach to everything from proselytizing to fund-raising . Chabad branches have been at the center of courthouse fights over their determination to erect Chanukah menorahs and other religious symbols on public lands . Some financial supporters have said that they have been asked to lend money to local Chabad organizations , only to run_into later difficulty collecting repayment . Under Chabad ' s structure every local group owes nominal allegiance to headquarters at 770 Eastern Parkway in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn -- a place known among adherents simply as &quot; 770 &quot; -- but they remain legally and financially autonomous . That provided the organization room to maneuver when financial problems enveloped Chabad of Irvine , a branch founded in 1979 by Rabbi Mendel Duchman . Duchman resigned his post in 1991 , leaving his congregation burdened by debts of some $ 1.2 million and three lawsuits filed by former members and a local bank . The members charged that Duchman persuaded them to co-sign loans for Chabad by misrepresenting the terms and alleged that he defaulted_on the loans and left them to pay the creditors . The congregation later was reorganized . By most accounts , Cunin is one of Schneerson ' s most vigorous and successful disciples . Since coming west 27 years ago on Schneerson ' s injunction , &quot; Go -- California is yours , &quot; Cunin has built Chabad here into one of the group ' s most active centers . Chabad operates a drug rehabilitation_program in Los Angeles and Chabad Houses , or educational centers , near several colleges . And Cunin has become a familiar figure via Chabad of California ' s annual telethon , on which he has shared the stage for 13 years with such Hollywood celebrities as Jon Voight and Shelley Winters . The telethon reportedly raises more_than $ 3 million a year . But Cunin ' s rise has not come without controversy . At one point , Chabad of California owed $ 18 million to 40 banks and 18 individuals -- &quot; and all_of it ( secured by ) my beard , &quot; as Cunin put it in a 1990 interview with The Times . All the creditors were eventually paid_off , he said Monday . While seeking contributions to fund the deficit , Cunin met Beverly Hills matron Hermine J . Weinberg , who gave him a $ 1 # 000 contribution and later , without the knowledge of her husband or children , rewrote her will to cut_off her closest relatives in favor of the Westwood Chabad House . She completed the change just days before taking her own life in 1985 . William Weinberg and his children sued to overturn the bequest , charging that Chabad officials took_advantage of a woman with a history of mental problems , a charge Cunin denied . The case was settled in 1988 with an agreement that awarded about $ 21 million to Chabad , a sum Cunin later called &quot; the Weinberg miracle. &quot; * Within a_few years that money was depleted , according to Jerry Weintraub , the producer of &quot; The Karate Kid &quot; and other Hollywood movies , who acts_as a co-host of the annual telethon and a major fund-raiser and informal financial adviser to Cunin . &quot; Their finances are a mess , &quot; Weintraub said last week , adding that Cunin ' s determination to accede_to most of the charitable requests crossing his desk confounded efforts to stabilize Chabad of California by creating an endowment_fund . Now , branches such_as Cunin ' s are faced with the task of carrying_on without their leader ' s physical presence . &quot; They ' re all_in inner turmoil , &quot; observed Weintraub in an interview shortly before the rebbe ' s death . &quot; Yet they try to carry_on . I think when they close the door at night , they ' re frightened. &quot;</TEXT>
