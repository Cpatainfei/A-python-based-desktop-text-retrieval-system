   <TEXT> THE ROAD PAST ALTAMONT by Gabrielle Roy , translated from the_French by Joyce Marshall ( Bison : $ 7.95 ; 146 pp. ) and STREET OF RICHES by Gabrielle Roy , translated from the_French by Harry Binsse ( Bison : $ 8.95 ; 246 pp. ) . The gently elegiac tone of these two books of stories and sketches by the popular Canadian writer suggests a mixture of Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder . Roy ' s semi-autobiographical work focuses_on a French-Canadian family living at the outskirts of Winnipeg in the early 20th Century . Beyond their yard stretch the vast plains of Manitoba , whose emptiness delineates their lives . &quot; The Road Past Altamont &quot; describes how the narrator ' s perceptions of her mother and grandmother shift over time . In one moving passage , Roy describes a child ' s awe at her grandmother ' s ability to craft a doll from household odds and ends : &quot; For a long_time I was haunted by the idea that it could not possibly be a man who made the world . But perhaps it was an old_woman with extremely capable hands. &quot; &quot; Street of Riches &quot; expands the vision to encompass the narrator ' s first experiences in the world beyond her small provincial city .</TEXT>
