   <HEADLINE> THINK OF THE MIAMI SUMMIT AS A GIANT ROTARY MEETING OF THE AMERICAS ; TRADE : GATT AND NAFTA HAVE PERSUADED LATIN_AMERICA THAT THE UNITED STATES IS SERIOUS ABOUT ECONOMIC COOPERATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The conventional wisdom in the U.S. news media regards presidential summits as little more_than glorified photo opportunities . Even we journalistic policy wonks who write for the editorial pages tend to share that somewhat cynical view . But while the meeting President Clinton will hold_in Miami this weekend with the 33 other elected leaders of North and South_America will surely have its share of carefully staged &quot; photo ops , &quot; the pictures that result this time will be notably different than those shot in 1967 , when the last hemispheric summit was held at Punta del Este , Uruguay . For one thing , there won ' t be any military_uniforms on the dais . For the first time , every government at a Western_Hemisphere summit will be represented by a civilian . Cuba ' s increasingly anachronistic leader Fidel Castro wasn ' t invited , obviously . He wasn ' t invited to Punta del Este , either . But some of the &quot; democratic &quot; leaders President Lyndon Johnson met with in 1967 -- like Paraguay ' s Alfredo Stroessner and Nicaragua ' s Anastasio Somoza -- were not a whole_lot better than Castro . They weren ' t Marxists , however , which is all that counted during the Cold_War . In Miami , for the first time since World_War_II , the Western_Hemisphere ' s leaders will meet without any external threats -- and the attendant &quot; security issues &quot; -- to deflect them from the far more important issue that Clinton has put at the top of the agenda : closer economic cooperation in the Americas . In effect , this will be less a political gathering than a business meeting . Kind of a high-level Rotary convention . Granted , economic cooperation is no stranger to summits . But this time , the Latin_American leaders , most of them elected on promises of national prosperity , are primed to do something about opening_up trade . The debut this year of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement and , more recently , the U.S. entry into the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , gives Clinton a strong hand to take into the meetings . By signing onto NAFTA and GATT , the United States proved it is not just going_to sermonize against protectionism but is willing to live_by free-trade rules that give other countries the same access to our home market that we want to theirs . And for the first time ever , the other countries in the hemisphere agree with us . All are opening their economies to outside investment and lining_up for the chance to sign onto an expanded NAFTA or other regional trade pacts , such_as Mercosur , which covers Brazil , Argentina and Uruguay . After decades of protectionist trade_policies and statist economic plans that led even wealthy nations like Argentina to fiscal disaster , a new generation of Latin_American political_leaders has come_to_the_fore . They not only believe_in free markets and open economies ; they have pinned their political futures on them . I refer here not just to Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo or his predecessor , Carlos Salinas de Gortari , who studied economics at Ivy League universities , but even to home-bred leaders like Argentina ' s Carlos Saul Menem . Consider this anecdote from Peter Hakim , the president of the Inter-American Dialogue , a forum of business , professional and political_leaders from throughout the hemisphere . At a meeting with some leaders of the guerrilla movement that nearly toppled the U.S.-backed government of El_Salvador in the 1980s , Hakim asked what the former rebels wanted from the United States . Investment , they replied . Just a_few years earlier , these former Marxists were targeting every U.S. link , from the embassy to soft-drink distributors , and running their capitalist countrymen out of their homeland at gunpoint . Now , I am not suggesting that the Miami summit will mark the dawn of an economic millennium for the Western_Hemisphere . El_Salvador , to cite just one case , still has monumental problems to resolve in the aftermath of its bloody civil_war . And so does the United States . Nasty gestures of anti-foreign sentiment , like California ' s vote_in favor of Proposition 187 , or the opposition to NAFTA and GATT by political dingbats like Ross Perot , are sad proof that the increasing cultural and economic integration between Latin and Anglo America won ' t be smooth . Still , it ' s inevitable , as any of those neatly tailored suits gathering for the summit photo ops in Miami could tell you . Opening doors is just too darn good for business .</TEXT>
