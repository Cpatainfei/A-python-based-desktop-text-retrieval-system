   <HEADLINE> THE FASHION-MINDED PROFESSOR ; THEY ' RE COOL . THEY ' RE CASUAL . AND THEY ' RE DEFINITELY NOT YOUR STEREOTYPICAL TWEED-WEARING INSTRUCTORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s no dress code at college , nor is there a sign posted in the ivy that says &quot; No shirts , no shoes , no education. &quot; But wearing shirts , shoes and something in between is encouraged . Jack Sterk , faculty president of Val ley College and notorious down-dresser , once admonished a student for wearing only a Speedo swimsuit to class . &quot; I thought that was inappropriate , he needed a shirt , &quot; says Sterk , who in 24 years of teaching has never worn a suit and tie to class . It should come as no surprise that some students dress as casually as possible , but so do some professors . What seems to be missing from the class picture is the college professor who wears a rumpled tweed jacket with leather elbow patches . &quot; They ' re a stereotype . First came the college professor wearing robes , then the tweed jacket . But even that has faded with time , &quot; says Sterk , who says tweed sports coats are a preppy affectation of the East Coast Ivy League . Sterk prefers a more wash-and-wear kind of style , as do many of his colleagues . The proponents of the surf-washed West Coast collegiate look say they are driven to their clothing choices by the climate and economics . Some instructors claim a casual style works as a teaching_aid , others say they use clothing as a personal statement . There are a_few renegade clotheshorses and still others who position themselves as futurists , responding to the globalization of fashion . Bart Kosko is one of the most flagrant down-dressers . He wears jogging shorts and tank_tops to teach fuzzy_logic at USC , &quot; and I do_it without apology , &quot; says the associate_professor of engineering . &quot; I bring_down the dress code for the entire department. &quot; Kosko didn ' t always dress for demotion ; there was a time when he wore the working-stiff uniform of suit and tie -- and hated it . &quot; I used to have a hard_time being a free man wearing a tie , &quot; he says . &quot; I came_to the university directly from a job in the aerospace industry . I noticed there was no dress code on campus . Before long the tie came_off , then the button-down shirt . Eventually I wondered if I had the courage to dress as I pleased or was I a coward ? I chose to dress as I pleased and have for several years. &quot; His minuscule workout clothes cause comment within the engineering department , &quot; often jokes , often not , &quot; he admits . But rather than worry about intra-departmental sniping , he finds solace in his fashion leadership role . &quot; I used to give fuzzy_logic seminars to people in the computer_industry . On the first day of the seminar they would all show_up in coats and tie , then they ' d see me . By noon the ties would be gone . By the second day most of the suits were gone. &quot; Kosko has found most men are eager to shed their three-piece suits for more relaxed clothing . He cites the business_community ' s adoption of dress-down Fridays as an example of one tiny step_in his direction -- only he ' s bypassed all_the intermediate levels of sport clothes and gone straight to the Ts and sweats . The changing college styles are most noticeable among men . Deviations from the standard suit stand_out . Women , however , have always had more latitude in what is deemed acceptable professional attire . Still , there are those who can find ways to rebel . Wendy Adest , for example . The 45-year-old Art Center instructor who wears baby doll dresses , had , until recently , curly baby blond hair . Now she is scalped like an Army recruit . She found as much liberation cutting her hair as Kosko did abandoning his ties . &quot; My old hairstyle seemed to be an old approach to beauty . I think this is high_fashion and pretty . My style of dress is very feminine -- sheer little dresses and lace blouses -- and this hairstyle is a counterpoint to that . My new haircut is really about being who I am in a way that is not traditionally attractive . It ' s about being strong , &quot; she says . Adest , a sculptor , teaches art history at the Pasadena school . &quot; I don ' t have to have that traditional tweed look . Being an artist gives me license to have a different aesthetic . There is a code of dress , though you notice it more among the men . They wear khaki pants and blue work shirts . The head of the graduate studies program must have 200 blue work shirts. &quot; One exception to Art Center ' s mode of chambray shirts is illustration instructor David Mocarski . He wears designer clothes -- Japanese designer clothes . &quot; I have some Yohji Yamamoto , Comme Des Garcon , Fuji silk , Go silk and some Armani , &quot; he says lapsing into Italian . &quot; Artists are about explorations and experimentation . Every aspect of my life is like that , whether it ' s the clothes I wear or where I live , &quot; says Mocarski , a resident of the old Pabst brewery Downtown and owner of a Lotus Esprit . His appreciation of the finer things in life is made affordable by his sideline graphic design company . Even though he dresses in fine style , Mocarski , like Kosko , receives negative reactions from the school administrators . &quot; During teacher reviews , they comment that I dress too well to be an art_teacher , when they are supposed to be commenting on my teaching ability , &quot; he grumbles . Sterk bypasses any style conflicts by dressing for the heat and humility . He finds his students relate to him better if he dresses like them . &quot; I teach critical thinking , and I try and evoke comments from my students . If I dress too formally , they view me as an authority figure and are reticent to speak_up , &quot; Sterk says . &quot; It ' s also a matter of survival and income . Many of our buildings are not air conditioned , and we haven ' t gotten a raise in five years. &quot; Even in more traditionally conservative scholastic environments , dress styles have changed . The students at Fuller Theological Seminary aren ' t impressed with coats and ties or even clerical_collars , says Isaac Canales , director of Hispanic Church Studies and professor of New Testament at Fuller , and pastor at Eben-Ezer Family Church in Carson . &quot; The generation that is preparing_for the ministry is more relaxed than previous generations , so I am more relaxed in the classroom and the pulpit . It ' s not surprising , or strange , to see a pastor in more informal attire in the pulpit or conducting business in short sleeves without a tie , &quot; he says . Canales says the casual dress style for teachers and ministers has been gaining momentum since the societal revolutions of the ' 60s . Once we relaxed our dress codes , we began to assimilate global influences , he says . &quot; Look_at the Israeli Parliament . No one wears a tie . In Latin_America , the guayabera is considered professional attire , &quot; says Canales , who wears the traditional white shirt with pin tucks and patch_pockets . &quot; Even the way we shop for our clothes has changed , &quot; he says . &quot; Years ago , you would never think_of shopping outside Sears or JCPenney . And look_at the massive swap meets we have today . It ' s more like the way the rest of the world shops . As we become more internationalized , it ' s reflected in our attire. &quot; Canales says his clothing choices -- guayaberas , slacks and sandals -- are a result of who he is and where he lives . &quot; The guayabera is part of my Hispanic culture ; my sandals are more reflective of Southern California surfer attire , &quot; he says . But he quickly adds : &quot; On Sunday , I wear shoes. &quot;</TEXT>
