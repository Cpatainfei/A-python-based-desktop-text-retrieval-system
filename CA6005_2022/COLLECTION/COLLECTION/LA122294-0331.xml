   <HEADLINE> ' JUNGLE ' GOES_BACK TO DRAWING BOARD ; MOVIES : DISNEY ' S LIVE-ACTION VERSION OF THE KIPLING TALE HAS THE SAME BASIC STORY AS THE ANIMATED HIT . BUT UNLIKE THAT ONE , THIS FILM HAS REAL ANIMALS AND A BALANCE-OF-NATURE MESSAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Film remakes themselves are certainly not news ; this year alone has seen new versions of &quot; Love_Affair , &quot; &quot; Miracle on 34th Street &quot; and &quot; Little Women , &quot; among others . But Disney ' s forthcoming version of the classic Rudyard Kipling tale &quot; The Jungle Book &quot; is noteworthy not only because it ' s the third film version of the tale , but because Disney is also gambling by remaking its own very successful animated version , released in 1967 , into a live-action version . &quot; Rudyard Kipling ' s the Jungle Book , &quot; which stars Cary Elwes , Sam Neill and Jason Scott Lee as Mowgli and opens Sunday , is based only loosely on the first &quot; Jungle Book &quot; ( 1942 ) , which starred Sabu as Mowgli , the wild boy raised by a wolf_pack to respect the ways of nature and distrust man , and the later animated musical version , which featured the voices of Sebastian Cabot and Phil Harris . But the basic story is the same , and parents everywhere may well wonder , why tell the story again , especially when the musical version remains a family favorite ? Edward S . Feldman ( &quot; Witness , &quot; &quot; Save the Tiger &quot; ) says the first version &quot; had no jungle . It was made in a vacuum -- on a sound stage in Burbank during wartime. &quot; Director and screenwriter Stephen Sommers , who had not seen the 1942 version before signing_on , agrees . &quot; I felt we could never outdo the animated version ; it ' s actually my favorite Disney film , &quot; Sommers said . &quot; But we could do some things they didn ' t do . For instance , we could show how the animals ' names came from the Hindi language . We tried to pay some homage to the previous version by keeping the names the same. &quot; Indeed , King Louie , Bagheera and Shir Kahn are all back this time_out . As Feldman says , &quot; If you didn ' t keep the same animals , the audience would laugh you out of the theater. &quot; There was also the chance to make what Feldman calls &quot; a plea for the animals &quot; in this edition . Sommers points to Kipling ' s use of the &quot; law of the jungle &quot; in his stories , and the film carries a low-key message of preservation of the balance of nature , a thread Disney seems to be following lately with &quot; The Lion King &quot; and next summer ' s &quot; Pocahontas. &quot; The Disney decision to revisit its own material started in the early ' 90s , when co-producer Raju Patel ( &quot; Bachelor_Party &quot; ) and his father , Sharad , brought Disney a &quot; Jungle Book &quot; script they had commissioned , and ended in Disney ' s commitment to the $ 30-million film . Disney brought Sommers aboard as writer and director and called_upon the veteran Feldman to produce . Sommers , who directed 1993 ' s &quot; The Return of Huck Finn &quot; for Disney , wrote a new script that kept a lot of the Kipling story of Mowgli ' s encounter with the imperial British but added an adventure element that had been lacking in the animated &quot; Jungle Book. &quot; &quot; They said it would be a_couple_of weeks shooting in India , &quot; Feldman says , laughing . &quot; A couple of weeks . . . . &quot; The location work in Jodhpur , in fact , took about eight weeks . Sommers points to three major challenges to the shoot : &quot; Kids , animals and India . We used all real animals ; we couldn ' t use animatronics because we were dealing with animals people are used to seeing -- bears , tigers , wolves. &quot; The crew tried one robot monkey , but &quot; we all cracked_up when we saw it on film ; it just wasn ' t right , &quot; Sommers says . &quot; People know how these animals really look and move ; it ' s not dinosaurs or monsters. &quot;</TEXT>
