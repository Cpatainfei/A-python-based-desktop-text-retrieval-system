   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; JARDINE PULLS FLAGSHIP AFFILIATES FROM HONG KONG STOCK_MARKET ; TRADING : FIRM ' S LARGELY SYMBOLIC RETREAT , BEGUN A DECADE AGO , NEARS COMPLETION AS REVERSION TO CHINESE RULE LOOMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jardine Matheson , the powerful trading house that helped transform this colony into a jewel of the_British Empire , moved closer Wednesday to completing a symbolic retreat begun a decade ago when Britain agreed to return Hong Kong to China . Jardine , which inspired James Clavell ' s novel &quot; Noble House , &quot; removed two of its flagship affiliates -- Jardine Matheson Holdings and Jardine Strategic Holdings -- from the stock_market here . The companies will be traded on the Singapore stock_market next year . Jardine also plans to list in Singapore three other affiliate companies currently traded_in Hong Kong . Jardine began pulling_out in 1984 , in part , it said , to protect itself from a hostile Beijing government . The moves are largely symbolic , however , because Jardine ' s headquarters will remain in Hong Kong and it has substantial operations in both Hong Kong and China . &quot; We have 60 joint_ventures on the mainland and almost 80 # 000 employees there . About 60 % of our profits come from Hong Kong and China , &quot; said Neil McNamara , a Jardine spokesman . Jardine ' s first move_in 1984 was to change its legal domicile to Bermuda . In 1992 , it removed its main listing from the Hong Kong market , which prompted other companies to follow_suit . By next March , almost the entire Jardine Matheson group will be safely ensconced in Singapore and Bermuda . &quot; All Jardine is doing is maintaining the status_quo , &quot; McNamara said . &quot; We are a British company operating in Hong Kong , and that will remain the same. &quot; As the July 1 , 1997 , reversion to Chinese rule nears , Jardine fears it may become a target of Chinese-backed hostile_takeovers , or worse . The fears are not unfounded . Whenever Beijing wants to make Jardine uncomfortable , it brings_up the company ' s &quot; perfidious &quot; origins . As the oldest British trading company , or hong , Jardine made its fortune trading opium for tea and silk in China , and it was influential in getting Britain to fight the Opium War , the 1840-41 clash in which the_British took the island of Hong Kong . In 1937 , China achieved some revenge by nationalizing Jardine ' s headquarters in Shanghai and its Chinese holdings . Recently , the basis of China ' s displeasure with Jardine has been the company ' s support of something China fears could be as addictive as opium : democracy . Jardine was the only hong to condemn the Chinese government for its massacre of student demonstrators in Tian An Men Square in 1989 . The company ' s executives have also backed Hong Kong Gov . Chris Patten ' s recent democratic reforms , which have riled Beijing . The company protests that it has been made a scapegoat . &quot; We ' re not involved in politics between Britain and China , &quot; McNamara said . &quot; We ' re just in business. &quot; But recent run-ins between Jardine and Beijing seem to show that in Hong Kong , politics and business aren ' t easily separated . Beijing has refused to approve a $ 1.6-billion container terminal project , complaining that Jardine received the contract as a reward for political support . Soon after , a Jardine-owned construction company came under_fire after it was chosen to build China ' s naval base in Hong Kong . Jardine may have anticipated such attacks when it took its main listing off the Hang Seng index in 1992 -- an action Beijing called irresponsible . Or , as some analysts suggest , the firm may have sealed its fate . &quot; We ' ve been caught_up somewhat in a struggle in which we had no control , &quot; McNamara said . &quot; We won ' t be released from that until the conflict is resolved. &quot; Hong Kong ' s other hongs seem to be taking a different tack , convinced that change is the key to success in China ' s burgeoning market . The contrast is especially apparent with Swire Pacific , Jardine ' s sometime partner and longtime rival . &quot; Swire has changed their tune , &quot; said Gordon Crosbie-Walsh , a financial analyst at Nomura Research Institute . &quot; They made a significant effort to improve their relationship with China , and it ' s paying off. &quot; The company has traded its British image for a more Asian one , replacing the Union_Jacks on the tails of its Cathay Pacific airplanes with a bird-like brush stroke of Chinese calligraphy . It formed partnerships with the mainland company Citic Pacific , whose head , Rong Yiren , is now vice_president of China , and won the Coca-Cola bottling franchise for China ' s large and thirsty market . &quot; Swire will be the winner in China , but not overall , &quot; Crosbie-Walsh said . &quot; Jardine is capturing growth all_over the world . Swire will have the growth from China , but also the risk. &quot; * More International Business * Reprints of Times articles about doing business in foreign countries are available .
