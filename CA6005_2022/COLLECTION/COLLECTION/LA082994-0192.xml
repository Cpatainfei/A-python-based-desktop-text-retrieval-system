   <HEADLINE> MEXICO ELECTION : FRAUD AROUND THE FRINGES ; ZEDILLO HAS POTENTIAL TO RISE ABOVE THE LIMITED IRREGULARITIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The final ballots from Mexico ' s historic elections of Aug . 21 have come_into Mexico_City from the isolated hinterlands . The rural vote did not help Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon , candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , avoid the dubious distinction of being the first Mexican president in this century elected with less than 50 % of the vote . That will not be a point of pride for the PRI , a political_machine that has not lost a presidential election in the 65 years since it was founded . But it can be a matter of pride for Zedillo . When the vote count was completed , Zedillo had 48.77 % of the vote . Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the rightist National Action Party took 25.94 % and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party got 16.6 % , with the balance spoiled or divided among six minor-party candidates . Zedillo ' s winning margin is the lowest ever for a PRI presidential candidate . In 1988 , when outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari defeated Cardenas in a tight election that many Mexicans believe was tainted by fraud , he eked out his controversial victory with 50.47 % of the vote . There were many impressive numbers in the Mexican election in which that nation can take_pride -- a 77.5 % voter_turnout ; $ 730 million spent by the Salinas administration to create an ultramodern and largely fraud-resistant system of voter registration and identification ; more_than 35 # 000 Mexican citizens and 1 # 000 foreign visitors dispatched to far-flung areas of the country to watch the voting process and attest to its honesty . For now , Zedillo ' s winning margin of 48.77 % is not a number that belongs on that list , for it is tainted by fraud around the fringes . To cite just one of many troubling examples , the largest of the Mexican observer groups , a coalition of prominent citizens dubbed the Civic Alliance , reported that in 34 % of the precincts its observers visited , ballots were not cast in secret . In rural_areas of Mexico , especially , that leaves open the possibility that voters would have been subject_to retaliation by local political_bosses if they did not vote the &quot; right &quot; way . To be sure , the Civic Alliance and most other independent election observers agree with the assessment of James Jones , the U.S. ambassador to Mexico , that there was not enough fraud or voter intimidation to discredit Zedillo ' s victory . But enough voting irregularities were reported to pose a challenge to Zedillo , who pledged during his campaign to eliminate such blatant official corruption . If he does nothing else in his six-year term but end corruption , Mexicans would regard Zedillo as a great president . Most Mexicans -- and the many foreigners who care about that nation -- fervently hope that Zedillo will be able to rise above these voting irregularities to become just that -- as his predecessor , Salinas , was able to . In moving toward that goal , it would be_well for Zedillo to remember that many great and widely admired political_leaders , from Abraham_Lincoln to Margaret Thatcher , did not get more_than 50 % of the vote_in winning public office .</TEXT>
