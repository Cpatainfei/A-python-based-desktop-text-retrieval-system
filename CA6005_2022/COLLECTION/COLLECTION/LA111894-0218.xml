   <HEADLINE> L.A. JOINS CHALLENGE TO PROP . 187 ; IMMIGRATION : LEGAL MOVE COMES AMID DEBATE OVER GETTING INVOLVED WHEN MANY ARE CALLING FOR IMMEDIATE ENFORCEMENT . CITY ATTORNEY DEFENDS ACTION AS NECESSARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The city of Los Angeles jumped into the legal fray over Proposition 187 on Thursday , with City Atty . James K . Hahn filing court papers to join in a federal lawsuit seeking to toss_out the anti-illegal immigration ballot measure . The move came amid continuing debate on the City_Council about whether the city should get involved in court action over the initiative , particularly when many constituents are clamoring for its immediate enforcement . Hahn ' s office said the action was necessary to clarify the city ' s responsibilities under the measure , which was approved by state voters last week by a 59 % -41 % margin . Meanwhile , sponsors of the initiative said they were neither surprised nor dismayed by Wednesday ' s issuance of a temporary restraining order by a federal judge in Los Angeles covering most portions of the sweeping measure . They added , however , that many grass-roots supporters have their phones ringing off_the_hooks , expressing outrage that the initiative has not taken_effect immediately . &quot; People are really offended that their vote , their will and their voice doesn ' t mean anything -- that the court can just tell them to stuff a sock in their mouth and tell them to shut_up , &quot; said Harold Ezell , a co-author of the measure and a former federal immigration official . &quot; But people should not be surprised or discouraged . &quot; You have to go_through all_of this exercise of going_through the courts . They did_it with Proposition 13 , they did_it with Proposition 103 . . . . It ' s just part of the system. &quot; Since voters approved the get-tough initiative , eight lawsuits have been filed to overturn it in state and federal_courts from Sacramento to Los Angeles . The legal filings by government_agencies , including the Los Angeles Unified School District , have resulted in a strong backlash from voters . The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors backed_away from undertaking a similar suit and proponents of the ballot measure announced plans for a recall drive against Los Angeles School_Board President Mark Slavkin . Last week , the Los Angeles City_Council also voted to take legal_action in an effort to overturn the measure . But Wednesday , several council_members began an effort to retract the vote and to instead ask the courts to clarify how the ballot measure should be applied by city departments . The city ' s latest action puts it on the side of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California , the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , the Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California and other civil_rights groups that are attempting to overturn the initiative . In his legal papers seeking to join the case as an intervenor , Hahn blasted the initiative in no uncertain terms , saying it is &quot; vague , over-broad and may result in thousands of persons suffering violations of their constitutional right against discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity. &quot; Attorneys in Hahn ' s office maintained that the tough language was necessary for the city to be allowed to enter the law case at all . &quot; We adopt the pleadings of the ACLU and they are asking_for . . . relief ( from the proposition ) but our mission is to find_out what the law means and what the city ' s duties and obligations under it are , &quot; said Jessica F . Heinz , the deputy city attorney who drafted the city ' s legal papers . Heinz said that the federal_courts do not allow parties to simply enter litigation in a neutral position to seek answers to questions . Instead , they must show what harm they might suffer if the initiative is not clarified . &quot; To get standing in the court we have to show that we have a real interest and a real stake , &quot; Heinz said . &quot; We have to let the court know there is a very real problem facing the city. &quot; Two law professors who are experts in federal civil procedure agreed that the city must stake out a clear position in_order to intervene in the suit . The federal_courts probably would ignore a simple request for clarification of the law , in the form of a friend_of_the_court brief , said Profs . Stephen Yeazell of UCLA and Erwin Chemerinsky of USC . City Councilman Joel Wachs has argued that the City_Council should reverse its earlier stand pursuing &quot; any and all legal_action to . . . set_aside the provisions of Proposition 187 . . . by challenging its constitutionality. &quot; Wachs said he will press the City_Council today to reverse that stand and &quot; not take that activist position . That is what the public is really angry about , seeing their money used to try to overturn their action . That is what the public sees as an arrogance. &quot; Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg countered that because the entire City_Council has asked_for clarification of the law , it has no choice but to follow the city attorney ' s advice . Hours after Proposition 187 ' s approval , a San Francisco judge temporarily blocked the educational provisions from taking_effect . On Wednesday , U.S. District Judge W . Matthew Byrne Jr. , acting_on four separate cases filed by civil_rights groups and private attorneys , halted immediate enforcement of the initiative ' s ban on non-emergency medical , educational and social_services for illegal immigrants . Declaring that portions of Proposition 187 raise serious federal constitutional questions , Byrne also temporarily blocked implementation of its requirement that police and government_agencies report suspected illegal immigrants to immigration authorities . Until hearings are held_on requests for preliminary injunctions -- which are designed to block implementation of the initiative until its legality is determined in court -- the only portion that Byrne ruled could take_effect is a section providing increased state penalties for the sale and use of fraudulent citizenship documents . Byrne ' s ruling came_in suits brought by the civil_rights groups , the Center for Human_Rights &amp; Constitutional Law and two private attorneys . In its wake , leading Proposition 187 proponents have weighed in with decidedly measured responses . Gov . Pete Wilson , for one , said a comprehensive court process could prove beneficial to the measure ' s supporters . &quot; I think that it is more important that there be a full and complete record before the U.S. Supreme Court actually considers the questions that have been presented by 187 , &quot; Wilson said late Wednesday . Pro-187 campaign Chairman Ron Prince , who viewed the proceedings Wednesday , praised Byrne ' s performance , even if he disagreed_with the judge ' s ruling . &quot; I was very impressed by Judge Byrne , &quot; said Prince . &quot; I thought his questions were fair and he certainly gave the attorney_general ' s representatives ample opportunity to present a case . In fact , he was almost presenting their case for them in the absence of any effort on the part of the deputy attorney_general to do_it himself. &quot; Prince termed Wednesday ' s ruling a partial victory because Byrne upheld the initiative ' s sections on fraudulent documents , which call_for penalties of up_to five years in prison for illegal immigrants who use false citizenship papers . Prince added that he had expected -- and had made clear repeatedly during the long campaign -- that the education , health and social_service provisions of the ballot measure would take months or years for courts to resolve . His only surprise , he said , was that Byrne did not allow the immediate implementation of a requirement that police verify the immigration status of anyone who is arrested in California . Byrne , during Wednesday ' s proceedings , made pointed comments about the initiative ' s apparent legal deficiencies . At one point , noting that the measure contains several different definitions of illegal immigrants , he said : &quot; It looks as if it ' s been drafted by committee. &quot; Prince said he is not fearful of a backlash against the sponsors of Proposition 187 if judges continue to raise questions about the measure ' s constitutionality because of its specific provisions or the manner in which it was written . &quot; It doesn ' t matter how the initiative was written , &quot; he said . &quot; The minute you challenge special_interests , they ' re going to try to fight you every way that they can. &quot; At a meeting late Thursday of Proposition 187 supporters , a crowd of more_than 350 loudly applauded speakers who called_for the ouster of Los Angeles school and City_Council officials who mount taxpayer-funded attacks on the measure . Addressing an audience packed into the auditorium of a Sherman Oaks school , one speaker protested what he called &quot; the invasion of the United States. &quot; Glenn Spencer , head of the Voice of Citizens Together , pledged to rewrite the three &quot; Rs &quot; for the Los Angeles School District , which he accused of &quot; harboring criminals. &quot; &quot; Instead of reading , ' riting and ' rithmetic , it will be recall , remove and replace , &quot; Spencer said . Spencer ' s group had announced plans Wednesday to launch a petition drive to recall Slavkin . Prince told the group that the initiative has sent a message to state and federal_officials , especially President Clinton . &quot; We ' re not going_to allow them to overturn the will of the people , &quot; he said . Earlier Thursday , Proposition co-sponsor Barbara Coe , who heads the California Coalition for Immigration Reform , said the restraining order &quot; wasn ' t a surprise to supporters of 187. &quot; Coe said she agrees with voters who do not understand why the courts would even get involved in ballot measures that win approval at the polls . &quot; In an ideal world , when the people spoke , that would be the end of the subject -- it would be the law , &quot; Coe said . &quot; In many ways , there certainly is no need for a court system when we look_at the greedy and unethical people who are using it for their own purpose and results. &quot; Those comments brought a shocked reaction from Chemerinsky , a constitutional law professor . &quot; Ever since the earliest days of our country , courts have been able to declare laws unconstitutional -- no matter how popular they might be -- if they violate the Constitution , &quot; Chemerinsky said . &quot; The whole point of the Constitution is to make_sure that our basic values won ' t be trampled by the short-term wishes of the majority. &quot; Suits concerning California initiatives are hardly new , Chemerinsky added , citing the ongoing litigation over the fate of Proposition 103 , the insurance reform measure approved by voters in 1988 . Even more to_the_point , the professor said , was Proposition 14 , the 1964 ballot measure that overturned state and local anti-discrimination housing laws . Three years later , the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the measure violated the federal Constitution by involving the state in racial discrimination .
