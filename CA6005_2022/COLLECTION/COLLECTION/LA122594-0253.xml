   <HEADLINE> FIGHTING SLOWS IN BOSNIA , U.N. OFFICIALS SAY ; BALKANS : SITUATION AFTER CEASE-FIRE CALLED ' GOOD ' EVERYWHERE EXCEPT IN BIHAC POCKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.N. officials said Saturday that a cease-fire had slowed fighting across Bosnia except in the northwest enclave of Bihac , where Croatian Serbs and rebel Muslims were attacking government forces . The United Nations hoped to build a peace settlement around the cease-fire , which went_into effect at noon Saturday . But Croatian Serbs and the rebel Muslim troops , who did not sign the cease-fire pact , pressed ahead with attacks on Bosnian government troops around the town of Velika Kladusa in the north of the Bihac enclave , a U.N. spokesman said . Col . Gary Coward , military spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force , told reporters , &quot; The situation throughout Bosnia , including Sarajevo , is good with one exception , which is Velika Kladusa. &quot; He said Croatian Serbs and Muslim rebels &quot; continued with warring activities south of Kladusa . There were a_few shells and significant small arms and heavy machine-gun fire. &quot; Edward Joseph , a U.N. spokesman in the Bihac pocket , said by telephone Saturday evening that the organized assault on Velika Kladusa had come from rebel Krajina Serb-held territory in Croatia . &quot; There has been a concerted attack from the territory controlled by the RSK , &quot; the self-declared Republic of Serb Krajina , Joseph said , adding that it was unclear whether the forces involved were purely rebel Muslims . The fighting had hampered the movement of a U.N. refugee agency aid convoy for the region , he said . Bosnian Serb radio , quoting rebel Muslim radio , said the rebels were pressing south to &quot; liberate the whole of western Bosnia &quot; from the government army ' s 5th Corps . Sarajevo was peaceful despite three shots that rang_out on the city ' s notorious &quot; sniper alley &quot; seven minutes after the truce deadline but caused no casualties . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic signed the seven-day cease-fire with the United Nations on Friday and agreed to negotiate a four-month &quot; cessation of hostilities &quot; by next Sunday . If the cease-fire succeeds in halting almost 33 months of war , talks will resume on an international peace plan to divide the country between Serbs and a federation of Muslims and Croats . A trail of broken cease-fires in the past prompted caution among the Contact Group of nations -- the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany -- promoting the plan . The group said in a statement that talks would start only when the United Nations verified that the cease-fire was working and the Serbs accepted the peace plan as a starting point for negotiations . The United Nations always knew the Bihac pocket was a weak link in the cease-fire based on mediation by former U.S. President Jimmy_Carter , who was invited to Bosnia-Herzegovina by Karadzic last week in an effort to break months of deadlock in the peace process . * The Muslim enclave of Bihac has been the scene of heavy fighting since October . Although Bosnian Serb army commander Gen . Ratko Mladic signed the cease-fire , the Croatian Serbs and rebel Muslim forces loyal to local businessman Fikret Abdic were not even invited to follow_suit . But Bihac is essentially a sideshow compared with the broader war and diplomatic struggle between Bosnian Serbs and Sarajevo ' s Muslim-led government . Karadzic ordered his forces to stop fighting Friday , and U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U said there was &quot; a dramatic drop_in military activity throughout Bosnia ( on Friday ) . &quot; The cease-fire agreement was boiled_down to its essentials to remove issues over which the Serbs and Muslims have been wrangling for months . These will be tackled as negotiators aim for a cessation of hostilities -- under which U.N. peacekeepers will be deployed between the warring sides . The issues include a Muslim withdrawal from the demilitarized zone on Mt . Igman west of Sarajevo , the demilitarization of Muslim enclaves in Bosnian Serb territory and the exchange of prisoners_of_war and information about missing people .</TEXT>
