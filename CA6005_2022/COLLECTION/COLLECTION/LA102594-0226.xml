   <HEADLINE> EXPANDED WORLD CUP TOPS FIFA AGENDA ; SOCCER : WORLD GOVERNING BODY TO FOCUS_ON 1998 TOURNAMENT , ' 96 OLYMPICS AND PLANNED PROFESSIONAL LEAGUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is decision week for FIFA , and possibly for Major_League Soccer , Alan Rothenberg ' s touted but so far unrealized professional soccer league . The leaders of FIFA , the sport ' s international governing body , are in New York for three days of meetings . Topping the agenda is deciding how to allocate eight more places for the 1998 World Cup in France . Also scheduled is a briefing from Olympic officials on the soccer competition in the 1996 Games in Atlanta , when both men ' s and women ' s tournaments will be held . In addition , there is the possibility that MLS will make the long-awaited announcement on its future : Will the league start next spring as promised or will it be postponed a year ? Then , too , a decision is expected on whether former Argentine star Diego Maradona is violating terms of his 15-month drug-related banishment from the sport by serving as an unpaid coach . But France ' 98 is the key matter . For the first time since 1980 , when the field for the 1982 World Cup in Spain was increased from 16 teams to 24 , FIFA is having to grapple with demands from all six of its member confederations for extra places in the finals . When FIFA President Joao Havelange of Brazil announced last year that the 1998 World Cup would be contested by 32 teams , it set_off a flurry of backstage maneuvering and politicking that continues . Europe , for example , has demanded 15 places , plus host France , an automatic qualifier . That would mean 16 European teams , or half the field . The argument is that Europe is where the best soccer is played , as evidenced by the fact that seven of the eight World Cup ' 94 quarterfinalists were European . Europe had 13 teams in World Cup ' 94 . South_America , too , is asking_for greater representation . Having had four teams in USA ' 94 , it wants five places in France ' 98 , including Brazil , which qualifies automatically as the defending champion . The South_Americans also have suggested that each of the five major confederations ( ignoring Oceania ) be given one additional place , with the other three places being awarded to the first- , second- and third-place finishers in 1994 -- namely , Brazil , Italy and Sweden . Africa and Asia , meanwhile , are demanding two additional berths each in the finals . Africa currently has three , Asia two . Where does this leave FIFA ? On Wednesday , its World Cup Organizing Committee will meet here to decide what recommendation it will make to the Executive Committee . On Thursday , the Executive Committee will announce its decision . Chances are , Europe will be given three additional places ; Asia , Africa , South_America and CONCACAF ( the North and Central_American and Caribbean region ) will each get one , and the eighth will be up for grabs , possibly going_to the winner of a playoff between teams from Asia and Oceania . So far , the Olympic soccer tournaments have generated little controversy , FIFA and the International Olympic Committee -- of which Havelange is a member -- having earlier agreed that the 16 men ' s teams each will be allowed to field three &quot; over-age &quot; players in what would otherwise be an under-23 tournament . That opens the way for a limited number of World Cup stars to play , something the IOC wanted . In return , the IOC added women ' s soccer as a medal sport . There are no age restrictions on the women ' s teams and the defending world champion United States is the early gold-medal favorite . In the case of Maradona , FIFA seems likely to turn_a_blind_eye to his coaching duties at Deportivo Mandiyu , a modest Argentine team headed nowhere . Under Argentine soccer federation rules , Maradona cannot become a professional coach until he completes a two-year coaching course . In the meantime , he is serving as an unpaid , albeit outspoken , &quot; assistant &quot; for Deportivo Mandiyu . FIFA handed Maradona his second 15-month ban after he failed a postgame drug test during last summer ' s World Cup . As for MLS , Rothenberg , president of the U.S. Soccer Federation and head of the proposed new league , said an announcement could be made this week , possibly during the FIFA meetings . MLS has been struggling to get_off_the_ground , with investors showing only lukewarm interest . Its fate could hinge_on a USSF Board of Directors meeting scheduled for Sunday in Los Angeles .</TEXT>
