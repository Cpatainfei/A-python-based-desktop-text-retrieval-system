   <HEADLINE> TOLL PUT AT FOUR IN FISHING BOAT SINKING OFF O.C.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They work long hours for little pay on rickety boats that often lack basic safety equipment . That portrait of a gill-net fisherman ' s risky existence emerged Thursday as authorities continued their investigation into the sinking of a fishing_boat in a busy shipping lane 10 miles off the coast here . Coast Guard officials said Thursday that four men apparently were_on board the 45-foot fishing vessel Tammy , which was based in Los Angeles Harbor . The bodies of two -- Nhieu Van Nguyen , 52 , a licensed fisherman from El Monte , and Khanh Nguyen , 50 , of Alhambra -- were recovered amid boat debris Tuesday morning . The discovery set_off a daylong air and sea search by the Coast Guard , but the vessel and the other two bodies have not been found . The boat ' s owner , Cong Minh Ta , 54 , of San Gabriel , is missing and presumed dead , officials said . Authorities identified the fourth man as Gioi Nguyen , 59 , of San Pedro , a sometime fishing partner of the other victims , whose son reported him missing . None of the victims were related , officials said . Four vessels had passed_through the shipping corridor overnight Monday and will be examined for signs of a collision when they reach port , officials said . As authorities sought to determine what happened to the Tammy , relatives and seamen described the risky existence of gill-net fishermen . &quot; People are always writing_about cops getting killed , but this happens to us all_the time , &quot; said Andy Stanojevich , a San Pedro fisherman who sails from the same port where the Tammy used to dock . &quot; It ' s a much higher risk occupation. &quot; A state ban on gill-net fishing , which went_into effect on Jan . 1 but has been tied_up by lawsuits , has forced the fishermen -- who anchor long nets in the sea floor to snare fish and sea_cucumbers -- into deeper waters . Many of the estimated 300 fishing_boats docked in Los Angeles Harbor are said to be poorly maintained and to lack good lighting and navigational equipment for work that often goes_on at night so that the fishermen can reach the market by morning . Coast Guard inspector F.L. McClain said federal regulations require safety gear , such_as life_jackets and emergency beacons , but boat inspections are not mandatory . &quot; On the average they ' re in really bad shape , &quot; said Coast Guard Petty_Officer Randy Reid . &quot; Just being_on board for a short time , I ' m always worried for my safety -- wondering whether it ' s going_to sink. &quot; Close_calls with the mammoth freighters and tankers that travel the same waters are part of everyday life , prompting suspicions among fishermen that the Tammy sank after a collision . &quot; It ' s a ritual for ( the ships ) to come as close as they can , &quot; said fisherman Bob Aguilar . &quot; It ' s like they do_it on purpose. &quot; Nhieu Van Nguyen , whose body was recovered Tuesday , knew those perils better than anyone , his family said in interviews Thursday . He escaped with a broken rib when a boat he owned sank three years ago after being struck by a steamer , according to friends and relatives . Nguyen was listed as a skipper for two other fishing_boats . Both of them sank this year , but he was not aboard either one , investigators said . &quot; Nhieu was fishing for his whole life , &quot; said younger brother Kieu Nguyen , 34 , of San Gabriel . The brothers moved from Vietnam 12 years ago . &quot; When we came here , I told him I could get him another job , doing gardening or cleaning . But he said , ' No . Only fishing. ' &quot; Ta , the owner of the Tammy , bought the 30-year-old , steel-hulled vessel last fall and poured $ 30 # 000 into making_it suitable for gill-net fishing , friends said . Nhieu Nguyen was always at his side . During the repair , a Coast Guard inspector cited Ta once for leaking diesel_fuel into the harbor , and an inspector who went aboard the docked boat urged him to stop welding because the boat lacked working fire_extinguishers , authorities said . Work_on the boat was finished last spring . &quot; They worked_on the boat for about six months , &quot; said Liem Nguyen , 21 , Nhieu ' s only daughter . &quot; He thought it was just like new. &quot; In keeping with Vietnamese tradition , Kieu Nguyen will hang a picture of his older brother beside incense , fruit and a statue of Buddha in his San Gabriel home after Saturday ' s funeral . Kieu Nguyen said he had not seen his brother in about three weeks and learned of his death through television reports . Nhieu Van Nguyen lived most recently in El Monte , but he often stayed with friends elsewhere in the San Gabriel Valley . &quot; Sometimes I didn ' t know where he was staying , &quot; Kieu Nguyen said . &quot; But if I wanted to see him , I ' d just go_to the docks. &quot; Times staff writer Susan Woodward contributed to this story .</TEXT>
