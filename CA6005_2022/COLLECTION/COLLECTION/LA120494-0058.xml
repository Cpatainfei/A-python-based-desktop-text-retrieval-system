   <HEADLINE> AFGHANISTAN SINKS DEEPER INTO THE MISERY OF A FORGOTTEN WAR ; KABUL : RIVAL FACTIONS CONTINUE TO CLASH DAILY IN THE COUNTRY ' S BESIEGED CAPITAL . AFTER 15 YEARS , NO END OF THE FIGHTING IS IN SIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Call it the Kabul wake-up call . Well before the sun rises over the jagged , snowcapped mountains of the Hindu Kush , the gunmen of Kabul fire their screeching rockets . They unleash a mighty thunder , jolt the population from slumber and send hearts racing into overdrive . By daybreak , jet fighters are roaring through the skies , machine_guns are crackling and the long-suffering people of Kabul are braced for another nightmarish day of urban warfare in one of the most brutal wars in the world . Some of the most intense day-to-day combat in the world is in the Afghan capital , where rebellious Prime_Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his ally , warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum , reignited a simmering civil_war with a blistering assault on the capital at 4 a.m. last New Year ' s Day . The guns have blazed ever since . Despite the relentless rocket attacks , Hekmatyar ' s troops have been pushed_back several miles to the southern and eastern fringes of the city and have virtually no chance of driving President Burhanuddin Rabbani from the Presidential Palace . The sheer routine of the stalemated war is_best illustrated by the daily battles in the southwestern corner of the city . The president ' s men are fighting from the abandoned Dehmazang Prison , separated from Hekmatyar ' s forces by a_few hundred yards and crumbling buildings that now look_like ancient ruins . The acting commander of the presidential force , Syed Kadar Shah , lives and works in a dank , cramped former prison_cell . Shafts_of_light filter through the window bars and highlight the smoke from the cigarettes that never leave his right_hand . Incessant bursts of gunfire drown_out his words , yet he sits like a man at a picnic , his legs casually crossed as he talks_about the roaring battle across the street . &quot; This is normal . The shooting has been like this here every day for the past seven weeks , &quot; said Shah . &quot; When the rockets land in the streets , people are killed all_the time . But we are safe here. &quot; His words fail to reassure . Every wall of the prison has been hit . Many have collapsed into heaps of rubble , or have gaping holes punched by mortars and rockets . Shah is not worried . He pulls_back his right sleeve to show several dark scars left by shrapnel . He points to his left shoulder where a bullet once ripped_off a chunk of flesh . Now 37 , Shah was a young_man when he became a guerrilla in the war to evict Soviet troops from Afghanistan . That enemy has been vanquished and now he is a prominent commander in the presidential army . Yet Shah finds himself barricaded inside a prison under constant attack and without a clue as_to when he will get_out . He is a prisoner_of_war , a metaphor that extends_to most everyone in Afghanistan . The Islamic holy warriors , or moujahedeen , were national heroes and somewhat united when they drove_out Soviet forces in 1989 and toppled a communist Afghan government in April , 1992 . The ferociously independent guerrillas quickly turned their guns on each other in a fight for control of Kabul . Nine separate factions are involved in the civil_war , and today the fighters are widely reviled as ruthless killers by helpless civilians , who account_for most of the city ' s estimated 30 # 000 dead and wounded this year . No faction is powerful enough to win an outright military victory and all peace efforts have collapsed . All factions want an Islamic government , and the feud is seen as little more_than a raw struggle for power among a handful of warlords . Hekmatyar , a fiery Islamic fundamentalist , was named prime_minister last year in an attempted compromise , but he has yet to set foot in Kabul . He wants Rabbani replaced as president by a neutral interim government that would hold elections . Rabbani , a reclusive , soft-spoken academic with a flowing white beard , says he will step_down to make_way for a loya jirga , or a council of leaders , who would choose a future government . A United Nations special envoy , Mehmood Mestiri , has been flying in and out of Afghanistan from his base in neighboring Pakistan in a bid to reconcile the positions , but the forecast is for continued fighting . Soldiers on both sides are dug_in and rarely risk ground assaults , preferring to heave rockets at one another from a safe distance , though they often miss their targets . The front_lines seldom change , which allows Hekmatyar to maintain his headquarters in Charasyab , only 15 miles south of the Presidential Palace in downtown Kabul . It is the civilians who suffer . Mohammed Ajmal , 12 , has been lying_in the Indira Gandhi Children ' s Hospital for a month with shrapnel embedded in his chest . He was flying a kite in his yard when a rocket hit . The doctors have no plans to operate at present because the main chest surgeon has left the country and the hospital lacks oxygen required for such surgery . &quot; We haven ' t seen kindness from any of the military groups , &quot; said Shah Jahn , Mohammed ' s mother . &quot; All the military sides are our enemies. &quot; More_than 250 # 000 people -- one-fourth of Kabul ' s population -- have fled the city , most settling in refugee camps on rocky , wind-swept plains near the eastern city of Jalalabad . Almost all foreign organizations have pulled_out of Kabul , except for a_few determined aid groups , led by the International Red_Cross . The Red_Cross ' administrative house was so badly damaged by shelling that the group had to move earlier this year . Its cars have been hijacked on the presidential side of the front . On Hekmatyar ' s side , Red_Cross food and medicine convoys have been stopped from entering the city . Peter Stocker , head of the Red_Cross delegation , said his group is now out of 30 of 180 essential items for their medical work . &quot; The knife is to our neck , &quot; said Stocker . &quot; We spend weeks negotiating with one commander . Then he ' s not there when our trucks come_through and they get_held up. &quot; Rabbani ' s nominal government barely functions , there is no formal economy and food prices have skyrocketed . The city ' s commercial center , along the Kabul River in the southeast , has been smashed into a huge pile of brown bricks . It is devoid_of people , except for shepherds who bring their flocks to nibble on the grass along the river bank . But Afghans are legendary survivors and have adapted their behavior to deal with rockets . When shells begin pounding one area , a street will clear instantly . Shop owners close their shutters . Vegetable sellers push their carts of tomatoes and carrots around the corner . Three streets away , business carries_on uninterrupted . But the main business of Kabul is still fighting . &quot; Being a soldier is the only way to make money , &quot; said Jhan Agha , a 17-year-old government fighter who gets the equivalent of $ 15 a month and makes three times that amount collecting &quot; taxes &quot; at his checkpoint .</TEXT>
