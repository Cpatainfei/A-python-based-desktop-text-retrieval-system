   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / MICHAEL KINSLEY : DOGS OF WAR ARE SNAPPING_AT CLINTON ; AT THE 1984 D-DAY CEREMONIES , NO ONE QUESTIONED REAGAN ' S WARTIME ' SERVICE ' IN HOLLYWOOD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ronald Reagan spent World_War_II in Hollywood . &quot; My job , &quot; he recalls artlessly in his autobiography , &quot; was to narrate the ' pilot training ' films . . . then say , ' Bombs away ' at the appropriate time. &quot; Reagan was ostensibly barred from overseas duty because of poor eyesight . It is possible , I suppose , that a man who could read perfectly from a Teleprompter on D-day 1984 had worse eyesight four decades earlier than all_the millions of Americans who did risk their lives in battle . But I cherish suspicions . In any event , Reagan ' s own war record didn ' t even merit a mention in the Washington Post report 10 years ago on his 40th anniversary speech at Omaha Beach . &quot; They knew some things are worth dying for , &quot; Reagan declared . &quot; One ' s country is worth dying for ; and democracy is worth dying for. &quot; You can bet that Bill_Clinton will not be so lucky when he delivers his own D-day speech next week . Already , the alleged difficulties arising from his avoidance of military_service form the predominant theme in the coverage of his European trip . The contrast must infuriate Clinton . Why could Reagan get_away with noble talk_of men dying for a great cause without snickers of contempt , when he can ' t ? There are several answers . First , there was Reagan ' s famous &quot; magic , &quot; which is another way of saying that his performance skills could ride over little anomalies like his own record in the very war being commemorated . Reagan was an &quot; actor &quot; ; Clinton is a &quot; phony. &quot; The difference is a matter of style , not morality , but c ' est la guerre . Then , too , the press is a lot harder on Clinton than it ever was_on Reagan . The Clintonites are right to feel that the political opposition is more poisonous , and more organized , than what Reagan faced . It keeps the &quot; draft_dodger &quot; issue bubbling . But there ' s also no denying that Clinton ' s slippery avoidance of military_service keeps coming_up because it plays into larger , and legitimate , doubts that people have about his character . And those doubts , unfortunately , are metastasizing with every day ' s newspaper . He ' s got_to do something to stop this . His presidency ' s at stake . No kidding . that ' s why I hope that Clinton uses a bit of time in his own D-day speech next week to take a risk and reach deeper than he has in the past on the subject of his generation ' s war and his own relationship to it . Clinton ' s previous riffs on this theme , such_as his remarks to hecklers when he spoke at the Vietnam Memorial on Memorial_Day , 1993 , have been banal reflections that America is a great country because we ' re all free to disagree . &quot; Just as war is freedom ' s cost , disagreement is freedom ' s privilege , &quot; etc . that ' s evasive . The key points are three . Unlike Ronald Reagan ( or Dan Quayle ) , Bill_Clinton avoided putting his life at risk in a cause he thought was morally wrong . What ' s more , he devoted considerable effort to foreclosing the necessity for others to put their lives at risk , either . Most important , the country ultimately decided that Bill_Clinton was right . This was a war that , in the end , a large majority of American citizens didn ' t want to fight . That doesn ' t absolve Clinton completely . He pulled several fast_ones to escape military_service , and his motives almost certainly were mixed . But -- with all due honor to Vietnam veterans -- no American needs to feel ashamed of not having fought in Vietnam . And any American who participated in the nonviolent protests that helped to end the killing and dying in that war can be proud_of his or her &quot; record. &quot; Clinton has nominated Sam Brown to be U.S. ambassador to the CSCE ( an international_organization based in Vienna ; you don ' t care what CSCE stands_for any more_than I do ) . Brown ' s nomination has been blocked by a Republican filabuster in the Senate because he was the leader of one of the big -- and peaceful -- antiwar marches . The reason the Republicans can get_away with this is that the country is not being honest with itself about Vietnam . We decided as a nation that the game was not worth the candle . Now many wish to blame the antiwar movement for losing the war for us . Clinton ' s tendency , as_many have noted , is to try to please everybody . It would certainly not please everybody if he were to use the occasion of D-day for a word or two in forthright defense of_his_own opposition to a later war . But , fairly or unfairly , Clinton will not enjoy Ronald Reagan ' s luxury of gliding past D-day on a cloud of tears and pretty language . His avoidance of military_service will be_on many minds , and those minds will be pondering whether it was mainly a matter of principle or a matter of cowardice . Some rhetorical courage on the day might help to resolve doubts .</TEXT>
