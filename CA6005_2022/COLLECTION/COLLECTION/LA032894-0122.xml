   <HEADLINE> MILLIONS OF ITALIANS VOTE AT END OF BITTER CAMPAIGNS ; EUROPE : PERSONALITIES AND PARTIES OVERSHADOW THE ISSUES . BALLOTING WILL CONTINUE TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Under sparkling Palm_Sunday skies , the vanguard of 48 million Italian voters meandered leisurely to the polls for national elections expected to recast their troubled nation ' s political future . Voting to renew a bicameral national legislature resumes this morning and continues until 10 p.m. Exit polls should be available around noon Pacific_time , but Interior Ministry officials do not expect authoritative returns before Tuesday . Issues weighed less in the campaign than stark left , center and right divisions carved around personalities and their political_parties . In all three camps , there is broad agreement that Italy should remain an integral part of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and the European Union , that its economy should remain free market with a strong social awareness , that major government-controlled industries should be privatized and that a national government saddled with huge public_debts should be made more efficient . Such general consensus was obscured , however , by campaign vitriol with Cold_War echoes . With many voters undecided until the last minute and no polls published in the last two weeks of the campaign , the outcome was anybody ' s guess . For the first time , voters chose candidates rather than parties in winner-take-all voting for three-quarters of the 630 seats in the lower house and 315 seats in the Senate . &quot; These elections are without doubt a decisive moment in the history of our country , &quot; President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro said after voting . Alarmed by the volume and tone of campaign venom , he had called_for candidates to tone_down their rhetoric . Most analysts predicted a tight finish between a three-party right-wing alliance headed by political newcomer Silvio Berlusconi , one of Italy ' s richest_men , and an eight-party leftist alliance centered_on the former Italian Communist_Party led by Achille Occhetto . Berlusconi , a self-made Milan billionaire , ran_on an anti-communism platform and the promises of more jobs and lower taxes . &quot; Oppressor , &quot; he snarled at Occhetto in a vituperative televised debate . Occhetto , who transformed what was once the largest Communist_Party in the West into the social_democratic_Party of the Democratic Left , ran_on conservative economics and experience -- his party has administered virtually every major Italian city in recent years . &quot; Demagogue , &quot; Occhetto snapped_at Berlusconi . By all accounts , the elections will strip authority from the political center , embodied by the former Christian Democrats who dominated all 52 Italian governments since World_War_II . Decimated and splintered by a corruption scandal that has tarred thousands of politicians and businessmen , the best the Christian Democrats could hope for this time is a junior partnership in a new coalition government dominated by newcomers of either the left or right . The elections were extended_to a second day to allow members of Italy ' s small Jewish community observing Passover to vote after sundown today . Fewer than half of the 519 voters registered at Precinct 2397 in the heart of Rome ' s old Jewish ghetto voted Sunday . &quot; Because of where we are and who we are , we expect the big rush tomorrow after the sun goes_down , &quot; said Giancarlo Ministieri , poll-watcher for the leftist alliance at a middle_school turned polling_station in the ghetto . Compared to the venomous campaign , Election_Day itself was_quiet -- a street festival for many Romans . No major incidents were reported in a country where electoral high_jinks are not unknown . In the past , the dead have been known to vote_in southern areas of the country where organized crime plays a major political role . On Sunday , by contrast , Calabrians could vote for the dead . Domenico Longo , a neo-fascist candidate in the town of Cosenza , died after the ballots were printed , but judges said votes for him would count .</TEXT>
