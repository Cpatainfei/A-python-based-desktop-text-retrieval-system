   <TEXT> As a senior in political_science at Cal State L.A. , I applied for a summer congressional internship in Washington . To my dismay , I was informed by the director of the program at my school that I could not apply for the position because I was white . He apologetically explained to me that this internship was limited to members of minority groups . He refused to even accept my application . My initial reaction was disbelief and anger . I couldn ' t understand how a university in the ' 90s could overtly tell a student that he is barred from submitting an application because of his skin_color . School officials informed me that my exclusion was not their policy , but that of the Washington Center , which oversees the internship program . I think it is important to note here that I ' m not a skinhead , a radical right-wing conservative or a Rush Limbaugh fan . I ' m simply a college_student trying to get an education . I am certainly understanding of the plight of many minority groups and share many of their concerns . But the practice of barring certain applicants from applying for a position based on race seems almost an impossible one to defend . It is somewhat disconcerting that this liberal movement , the same movement in which so many fought so hard to reverse discriminatory practices , is now partly responsible_for breeding and defending this new kind of bias . Looking_at Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , I don ' t think the intention of the affirmative_action legislation was to create these types of policies . If applicants for positions had equal qualifications under affirmative_action the employer had to hire or promote the minority applicant . Today the practice of affirmative_action seems to have changed . Today some white males are barred from even submitting applications to compare their qualifications with others . Affirmative_action has changed to some_other type of action and I no longer think it ' s an affirmative one . Students and others are silently suffering from these increasingly common practices , such_as the 5 # 000 white applicants barred from taking the Los Angeles Fire_Department ' s written exam in February . I fear that the silent complacency that seems to exist will aggravate existing racial tensions . It seems if you question these discriminatory policies and practices , as I have , there will be those who will not hesitate to call you a racist . Many will claim that you ' re against the advancement of minorities and want to limit their success . This couldn ' t be farther from the truth . But the threat of those accusations is so real and so frightening that many are too afraid to even raise the issue . I do not know the answers , but I do know it is time for discourse and frank discussion on these volatile issues . If this kind of bias were practiced against any minority , I would be one of the first ones calling_for change . Unfortunately , all I hear is silence .</TEXT>
