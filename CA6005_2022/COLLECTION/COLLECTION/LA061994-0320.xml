   <HEADLINE> LESSONS FROM SOMALIA APPLIED TO TEACH U.S. TROOPS HOW TO WAGE PEACE ; TRAINING : MOCK VILLAGES AT FT . POLK LEND REALITY TO SIMULATED CONFRONTATIONS MILITARY MAY ENCOUNTER AS PEACEKEEPERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; CARNIS VILLAGE , Republic of Cortina &quot; -- For Army Maj . Stuart Patton , this has been the military equivalent of a bad hair day . First his heavily armed security_force failed to link up with a humanitarian relief convoy near this mud-bedecked &quot; Third_World &quot; village . Then a land_mine killed six villagers , including the wife of a local chieftain the major had hoped to win_over . And now Darren McConnell , a youthful , cocksure field agent for a private aid organization , is ignoring Patton ' s suggestion that the relief convoy stay out of a guerrilla-held area until the Americans can provide adequate protection . Patton finds none of this pleasant . A member of a special forces_unit , he has been trained to brook no nonsense in a combat situation . But now he is_on a peacekeeping mission . He quietly explains the situation . Eventually , McConnell goes_along . The incident is fabricated . Only Patton and his soldiers are real . The villagers , the township of Carnis and the entire Republic of Cortina are all props in a peacekeeping exercise conducted by the Joint Readiness Training Center at Ft . Polk , La . This is the new look in military_training in the post-Cold War era . The services , convinced that peacekeeping is going_to become a major part of their mission in coming years , are preparing troops to make not only war but peace . Strategists are starting to use many of the lessons learned in places such_as Somalia to get U.S. forces ready for potential peacekeeping operations in other areas -- possibly even Bosnia or Haiti if the Clinton_Administration succeeds in paving the way diplomatically . Much of Ft . Polk ' s sprawling woodland has been turned_into mock villages where troops can be trained in various operations , from fending off surprise_attacks to taking_care not to run_over villagers ' geese with Humvees . The U.S.-run Combat Training Maneuver Center in Germany is adopting similar techniques to conduct training exercises for heavy-armor divisions in case the Administration sends peace enforcement troops to Bosnia . The Pentagon ' s joint staff published the first all-service peacekeeping doctrine last fall . The joint U.S. Atlantic Command is developing new training_programs , and the Army is completing a new field manual . And all_the individual war colleges offer courses on peace operations . Moreover , the services are beginning to modify some equipment for peace operations . The Air_Force , for example , is revamping its parachute pallets for delivering humanitarian relief supplies . By analyzing lessons learned from the U.S.-led operation in Somalia , strategists &quot; are gaining a better understanding of how to tailor their forces . . . to respond more effectively to the challenges presented by peace operations , &quot; said Assistant Defense_Secretary Edward L . Warner III . Finally -- and perhaps most important -- the Administration itself is beginning to formulate a clearer policy about how it intends to use U.S. troops in peace operations around the globe -- a far_cry from earlier months , when it seemed to waver on the issue . In early May , the White_House unveiled a presidential decision directive , dubbed PDD-25 , that sets stringent conditions on the use of U.S. forces in peace operations , again mostly as a result of lessons learned from the situations in Somalia and Bosnia . The lessons being incorporated in the new doctrine and training policies include : * The United States should insist on a clear chain of command under which military commanders are given a firm say in the operations they are asked to mount . Although U.S. troops might be temporarily under U.N. command , American officers must retain final control . * U.S. forces must never again appear to be taking sides in a civil dispute , as they did when they began hunting Somali leader Mohammed Farah Aidid after his militia ambushed Pakistani U.N. troops last summer . The policy led to increased U.S. casualties . * U.S. forces should not be sent into peace operations without adequate firepower and troops . The fact that Army Rangers were asked to hunt Aidid without the armor they requested was blamed by some analysts for the heavy casualty toll in an ill-fated Oct . 3 raid . * Peacekeeping forces must be given clear rules of engagement that spell_out when they may fire on belligerents and civilians . They need sufficient flexibility to enable them to defend themselves while showing restraint when possible . * Policy-makers and military commanders must be alert to changes in the original mission of a peace operation , as when U.N. forces began hunting Aidid in Somalia . They must make_sure the troops -- and the general public -- understand changes thoroughly when they occur . U.S. strategists say peacekeeping units also need to learn narrower skills more effectively , such_as operating checkpoints along a road , dealing with private relief organizations , negotiating with villagers and handling refugees . Students at Ft . Polk ' s Joint Readiness Training Center , which trains Air_Force and Navy commandos as well as Army troops , are put_through a 12-day curriculum that combines practice at light-infantry combat operations with realistic experience in peace operations . Besides Carnis , the center has set_up two other &quot; villages &quot; in &quot; Cortina &quot; and the neighboring country of &quot; Atlantica &quot; -- complete with actors playing villagers , tribal leaders , snipers and Cortina &quot; national police , &quot; and a collection of geese , pigs , mules and goats . Although the broad situations are scripted in_advance , the bulk of the interplay between the soldiers and the villagers is free-form . As a result , no one knows when a &quot; terrorist &quot; is going_to throw a grenade . An ill-timed remark by an infantryman could start a revolt . The exercises , carefully monitored by on-the-scene observers and enhanced by electronic_devices that beep when a participant has been &quot; killed &quot; by a land_mine or rifle fire , are followed by after-action critiques in which a unit ' s mistakes are reviewed . &quot; Most of it is just plain common_sense , &quot; said James B . Williams , technical leader for BDM Management Services Co. , a consulting_firm that puts_together the role-playing operation for the Army . Inevitably , the mistakes -- by far the school ' s best teaching tool -- are legion . A few days ago , soldiers driving through a &quot; contaminated &quot; area donned protective masks but did not provide them for their civilian passengers , who &quot; died &quot; on the way to their destination . In another incident , a failure to listen to warnings from local villagers led two U.S. convoys into an &quot; ambush &quot; by opposing forces , who are played -- with a vengeance -- by Army troops stationed permanently at Ft . Polk . &quot; This is probably the most realistic wartime scenario we will ever play , &quot; Patton said as his unit helped make_sure that the &quot; bodies &quot; of villagers &quot; killed &quot; by that day ' s mine blasts are respectfully loaded onto trucks for transportation . &quot; The quickest way to get thrown_out of a country is to anger the people who live_in it , &quot; he said . &quot; This teaches us to react to various situations . You can learn those lessons here without paying the price. &quot; Canadian army Capt . John Errington , who recently returned from deployment with U.N. forces in Bosnia , agrees . &quot; The potential is all here , &quot; he said of the course at Ft . Polk . If the United States does send troops to Bosnia , &quot; every unit ought to go_through here. &quot; Army Lt . Col . Jack Clarke , a military analyst at the Army ' s Training and Doctrine Command in Norfolk , Va. , and one of the authors of a new field manual on peace operations , warns that the curriculum must be kept general in_order to keep troops prepared_for all situations . &quot; There are valuable lessons to be learned from Somalia , but we also want to be careful not to look_at all peacekeeping operations through that same lens , &quot; he said . The difficulty is that , despite the new presidential directive , the Administration still has not spelled_out precisely when and how it plans to use U.S. forces for peacekeeping operations in other areas of the world . During the 1992 presidential campaign , President Clinton unveiled an ambitious proposal to establish an international army , including some U.S. troops , that would be ready to stand &quot; at the borders of countries threatened by aggression , &quot; preventing mass violence . But the Administration ' s inability to work_out a firm policy in Bosnia , combined with the Oct . 3 raid in Somalia , in which 18 Rangers were killed , clipped the Administration ' s enthusiasm for peace operations and forced it to scale back its plans . The new White_House directive rejects suggestions that the United States support a standing U.N. army , or even that it earmark specific U.S. military_units for participation in U.N. operations . It also concludes that Washington is spending too_much on peacekeeping worldwide . White_House caution in approving U.N. military operations in Rwanda prompted the U.N. Security_Council to put_off a proposal for dispatching 5 # 500 more troops to that country earlier this month , the first such impact from PDD-25 since the new policy was announced . And while the White_House has pledged that it will send U.S. troops to Bosnia to help enforce any new peace accord there , it has laid_down so many strict conditions that some analysts say it makes the prospect of using U.S. forces there anything but a certainty . Many U.S. officials say they now believe that , given the adverse reaction to the Oct . 3 firefight in Somalia , the United States would be better_off providing logistic_support and intelligence for peace operations , leaving ground fighting to other countries . Indeed , Col . Sam Thompson , operations commander at the Ft . Polk training center , argues that even with all their training , U.S. forces may be_better geared to securing an area initially -- as they did_in Somalia -- than to enforcing the peace , which takes more patience . &quot; We ' re just not by nature very well-suited for these other things , &quot; he said . Even so , most analysts agree that preparation for peace operations will continue to be a mainstay of the post-Cold War military , along with maintaining conventional combat readiness and improving U.S. capability to counterattacks by weapons of mass destruction .</TEXT>
