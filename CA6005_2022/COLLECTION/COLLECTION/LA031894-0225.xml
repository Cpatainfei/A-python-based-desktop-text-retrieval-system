   <HEADLINE> 18 LAUSD SCHOOLS SEEK MAGNET STATUS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Motivated by falling test scores and the loss of high-achieving students , 18 schools -- three times the number that typically apply -- want to become part of the highly prized magnet system of the Los Angeles Unified School District . The schools hope to offer specialized courses ranging from Latin music to journalism and media technology . Magnets -- considered the gem of the school_system -- offer smaller classes , more money for special activities and facilities , and a handpicked faculty . Students must apply for entrance and the competition is stiff . Application brochures are available beginning today at all schools and Los Angeles public_libraries . But while the pull of the magnet is strong , funding could prevent many schools from achieving their goals . Because the students and teachers choose magnets rather than being assigned to them , principals report lower absenteeism , higher staff morale , greater parent involvement , even higher test scores . &quot; Our test scores are going_down , down , down , &quot; said Jan Walsh , principal at Gledhill Elementary in North Hills . &quot; We feel something is needed . We have to find something to turn these kids around . We ' re in a desperate situation. &quot; The new magnets also could attract students who plan to leave regular schools . Principals across the district say they lose some of their high-achieving students to magnets . About 38 # 000 students apply to magnets every year for 9 # 500 openings . &quot; I lose many good kids , &quot; said Marilyn Erickson , principal at Haskell Elementary School in Granada Hills , which wants to specialize in math , science and technology . &quot; It would be a way of keeping kids at my school and provide a program for parents who want magnet schools for their children. &quot; At Millikan Middle_School in Sherman Oaks , which is proposing to offer performing-arts courses , Principal Pete Ferry said the campus could tap parents who work in the entertainment_industry for support . Students at the school already are excited about the prospect . &quot; One boy told me he has to check with his agent to see if he could do these kinds of things for free , &quot; Ferry said . &quot; But there ' s a lot of interest. &quot; Millikan also loses students to magnets and other campuses , Ferry said . The magnet center could attract students to the campus . &quot; We ' re trying to plug up the drain , &quot; Ferry said . But whatever their intentions , the principals have hurdles ahead . The Board_of_Education must approve their requests and limited funding could be the death blow for schools ' plans . The board likely will consider the applications in the next few weeks . Board_member Julie Korenstein , whose daughter attended magnet schools , said the problem is strictly financial . &quot; I wish I could make every school a magnet , &quot; Korenstein said . &quot; It ' s going_to be a tough choice with the limited amount of funding we have. &quot; Korenstein represents the district with the most magnet students : 8 # 086 . She also has the greatest number of students on the district ' s waiting list -- 6 # 367 . The district expects to receive about 38 # 000 applications for the 108 magnets next year . &quot; Wherever they are and whatever they specialize in , students are doing better , &quot; Korenstein said . The district receives about 80 % of the magnets ' funding from the state . A onetime , $ 10-million federal grant from the National_Guard is paying in part for the math and science magnets . That grant could be another reason for the increased number of schools applying to be magnets . &quot; When there ' s money and the word goes_out , applications start coming_in , &quot; school_board President Leticia Quezada said . &quot; My preference is to establish the spirit and the environment in all our schools . &quot; The greatest benefit will be when all our schools become much more like our magnets , &quot; she added . Created during the divisive busing battles of the late 1970s , magnets are intended to provide students from across the sprawling district with smaller , ethnically diverse student bodies and specialized educational_programs . To many principals , the change will benefit parents who are seeking a better education for their children . &quot; Magnets carry an aura of superior programs and instruction , &quot; said Merle Price , the principal of Palisades High_School in Pacific Palisades . &quot; With all_the recent concern about the quality of public education , I think there ' s a built-in constituency. &quot; Added Anna McLinn , principal at Marvin Avenue Elementary in West Los Angeles : &quot; I think it ' s a last chance for our district . To me , it ' s the answer to low test scores. &quot; District officials are cautioning schools that becoming a magnet takes commitment and a strong desire to make the change . &quot; You can ' t just pin a label on the school door , &quot; said Richard Battaglia , who oversees the district ' s magnet program . &quot; Doing a good job in a magnet takes work. &quot; Aside from students , teachers also select magnets . Principals interview and hire teachers who are interested in their particular programs . At Granada Hills High , which launched a magnet last year , 60 teachers applied for seven openings . After a month ' s delay , the magnet brochure and application -- entitled &quot; Choices &quot; -- is available and the deadline is April 15 . Students who are currently enrolled in magnets are given priority , along with siblings of magnet students and those whose names already are_on the waiting list . If any new magnets are approved , a supplemental application and brochure will be printed , officials said . On a recent day at Gledhill Elementary , about 20 students lined_up to use the sole computer in the third-grade classroom . On another day , students showed_up before and after school to use a classroom terminal . Along with eight other schools , Gledhill proposes to specialize in math , science and technology . &quot; Children are so turned_on by technology , &quot; said Walsh , the principal . &quot; They need to be entertained all_the time . The computers give them another vehicle for learning. &quot; The Pull of the Magnet Eighteen Los Angeles schools have submitted applications to become magnet centers next year . The following is a list of the schools with their proposed specialties . San Fernando Valley campuses are in boldface and with an ( * ) asterisk .
