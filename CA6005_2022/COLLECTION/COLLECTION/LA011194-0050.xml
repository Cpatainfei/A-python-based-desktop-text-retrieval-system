   <TEXT> Their lives are not what they could be . True , the world ' s progress in providing education and health_care to children has been greater during the last 50 years than in the previous 2 # 000 , says a recently released U.N. report . But that progress falls_short_of technology ' s promise . For instance , immunizations could eradicate most childhood scourges , such_as polio , measles and diphtheria . But millions of children are not immunized . Poverty also exacts a toll . Malnutrition stunts the body and mind of one in three children living outside industrialized nations , says the report , &quot; The State of the World ' s Children 1994. &quot; In fact , the state of health and education among the young varies widely region to region . Malnutrition Malnutrition is a factor_in one-third of the annual 13 million deaths of children under 5 years old . It is the most damaging in the mother ' s last trimester of pregnancy and in the first year after birth , when brain development is nearing completion and the immune_system is weak . Poorly nourished mothers tend to give_birth to underweight , malnourished babies . Percentage of infants with low birth weight ( under 2 # 500 grams , or about 5 1 / 2 pounds ) : Sub-Saharan Africa : 16 % Middle_East and North Africa : 10 % South Asia : 34 % East Asia and Pacific : 11 % Latin_America and Caribbean : 11 % Industrialized countries : 6 % Developing countries : 19 % Least developed countries : 24 % Education Education is critical to the quality_of_life for children and their societies -- enabling them to compete economically and to sustain democracies , among other skills . There have been greater gains here , but disparities persist by region and gender . Gross primary_school enrollment * 1960 : 03 # 30 , 06 # 07 Boys Girls Sub-Saharan Africa 46 24 Middle_East and North Africa 72 40 South Asia 77 39 East Asia and Pacific 120 85 Latin_America and Caribbean 76 71 Industrialized countries 109 107 Developing countries 93 62 Least developed countries 48 23 Gross primary_school enrollment * 1990 : 03 # 30 , 06 # 07 Boys Girls Sub-Saharan Africa 76 60 Middle_East and North Africa 103 87 South Asia 97 73 East Asia and Pacific 128 120 Latin_America and Caribbean 105 102 Industrialized countries 103 103 Developing countries 107 92 Least developed countries 74 57 * The number of pupils enrolled in primary_school , divided by the number of children of primary_school age . Figures sometimes exceed 100 because some children enter primary_school early or are enrolled beyond the typical age of graduation . Health Infant_mortality has dropped , often dramatically , throughout the world . Immunizations and the technique of oral rehydration ( continuously providing food and water to diarrhea victims ) save millions each year . Still , there are major disparities . The United Nations ' goal for the year 2000 is for 90 % of children to be immunized . Percentage of 1-year-olds immunized around the world for polio : Sub-Saharan Africa : 45 % Middle_East and North Africa : 82 % South Asia : 83 % East Asia and Pacific : 92 % Latin_America and Caribbean : 76 % Industrialized countries : 85 % Developing countries : 78 % Least developed countries : 51 % Number of infants per 1 # 000 who die before their first birthday : Sub-Saharan Africa 1960 : 152 1990 : 111 Middle_East and North Africa 1960 : 155 1990 : 57 South Asia 1960 : 145 1990 : 88 East Asia and Pacific 1960 : 132 1990 : 42 Latin_America and Caribbean 1960 : 105 1990 : 39 Industrialized countries 1960 : 36 1990 : 9 Developing countries 1960 : 137 1990 : 70 Least developed countries 1960 : 171 1990 : 114</TEXT>
