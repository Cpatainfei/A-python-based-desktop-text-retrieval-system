   <HEADLINE> ' THE BURNING SEASON ' FIRES_UP AUDIENCE ; TELEVISION : THE BRAZILIAN PREMIERE OF HBO ' S STORY OF MURDERED RUBBER TAPPER CHICO MENDES , STARRING RAUL JULIA , ELICITS BOOS , CHEERS AND TEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Minutes before the glitzy premiere here of HBO ' s film &quot; The Burning Season , &quot; the story of murdered Brazilian rubber tapper Chico Mendes , Andrew Revkin said that he had one wish . &quot; I just hope it creates an emotional reaction , &quot; said Revkin , author of the book on which the movie about the champion of the Amazon preservation movement is based . It did . &quot; This is a horrible movie , &quot; one patron shouted from the balcony of the city ' s elegant Municipal Theater to the 1 # 000-member audience , which was filled with members of Brazil ' s movie , television and art community . &quot; It wasn ' t the Americans who made this cause . It was us , Brazilians , &quot; shouted another man as the final credits ran , irked that local activists didn ' t get more credit in the film for their efforts in support of Mendes . By the time the movie ended last Thursday , emotions in the crowd ranged from admiration to sadness , shame and disappointment . The $ 11-million film , shot in Mexico and directed by John Frankenheimer , stars Raul Julia as Mendes and includes Brazilian actress Sonia Braga , American actor Edward James Olmos and Cuban-born actor Tomas Milian . It airs on HBO in the United States on Sept . 17 . HBO premiered the work here at the invitation of the Rio de Janeiro Film Festival . &quot; The movie was a surprise , &quot; said Carlos Reichembach , a Brazilian film director . &quot; It ' s not an easy film . It ' s a difficult film . It ' s not a film that has an easy commercial appeal. &quot; Giovanna Gold , a well-known Brazilian actress , said the film was moving but inappropriate to start a film festival . &quot; We are here to have fun and enjoy movies , and the trees are still burning , &quot; she said , referring to the practice of burning off huge tracts of the Amazon forest to make_way for large ranches -- part of the deforestation that Mendes opposed . &quot; That makes me feel uncomfortable. &quot; &quot; It started slow , &quot; said Felicia Krumholz , a landscape_architect , &quot; but as we got toward the end , I was there with tears streaming down my face . I am sort of a child of Chico Mendes . I got involved in recycling and other projects because of him. &quot; Others found the movie boring . &quot; Too_bad good intentions don ' t always make_good movies , &quot; said engineer Marcos Venicios . Some were irritated by the fact that a work about a Brazilian hero was made by an American company and not a Brazilian one . &quot; I feel ashamed because we ( Brazilians ) needed the foreign media to show us what was happening right here in our own country , &quot; said Beth Silveira , a theatrical producer . Many complaints concerned the veracity of the film . &quot; The big error of the movie was made before the film begins , when it says ( on screen ) that it ' s a true story and not inspired by a true story , &quot; said Zuenir Ventura , a respected Brazilian reporter who covered the trials of the two men convicted of murdering Mendes in 1988 and who later adopted the boy whose testimony helped send them to prison . ( One man later escaped and the other is awaiting a new trial. ) For example , some said , central to the film is Mendes ' staunch opposition to the construction of a road into the Amazon forest . Journalists , rubber tappers who worked with Mendes and even writer Revkin said that Mendes never opposed the road . &quot; We need roads , we want roads , &quot; said Jorge Antonio Alves , 31 , a rubber tapper who worked with Mendes and is currently president of the workers ' cooperative in the town of Xapuri , where Mendes was murdered . &quot; Chico was against the unfair distribution of the land . He was against the way the road was going_to be used to promote more burning and clearing of the forest. &quot; He also took_exception to a scene in which a child is killed when gunmen hired by land owners fire into a crowd of demonstrators . &quot; They dramatized a little too_much , &quot; Alves said . &quot; No children were ever killed. &quot; &quot; Chico Mendes was a more complex person than the person presented in the movie , &quot; said Ventura . &quot; He was a militant of the ' 90s , not an activist of the ' 60s . In the film , they painted him like Martin_Luther_King or Gandhi , but that wasn ' t his style. &quot; Mendes was an aggressive communist , he said , whose activism was rooted in class_struggle . But over all , both Alves and Ventura gave the film a passing grade . &quot; The film shows clearly that ( Mendes ) was a champion , &quot; Alves said . &quot; I think it shows the reality of what we ' re going through . &quot; Our struggle is not over . Two percent of the ( western ) state of Acre has been burned this year , and 6 % was burned last year. &quot; Even the Chico Mendes Preserve -- 2.5 million acres deeded to the rubber tappers and their families after Mendes ' death -- has already been invaded by lumber cutters , he added . &quot; Unfortunately , Chico Mendes was so little known in Brazil that the image of him ( in the film ) , with all its problems , will be accepted as the truth , &quot; Ventura said . &quot; Whether that ' s good or bad , I don ' t know . . . . &quot; There is a mixture of shame and pride . Shame that we allowed this to happen , and pride in a Brazilian hero. &quot;</TEXT>
