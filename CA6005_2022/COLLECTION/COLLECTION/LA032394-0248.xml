   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; SPOTLIGHT ON MALAYSIA ; THE MALAYSIAN ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Following years of rapid industrialization , the nation is now in a period of consolidation . It must manage its success while dealing with a labor shortage , infrastructure bottlenecks and the threat of inflation . A pragmatic and efficient government hopes to slow growth to a sustainable rate while diversifying the economy . The country benefits from minimal corruption and an educated work_force . Manufactured Exports Malaysia is the world ' s largest exporter of computer chips and the third-largest chip producer , after the United States and Japan . It is home to Intel Corp. ' s largest overseas plant . The nation has also become a major producer of VCRs and air-conditioning units . By 1991 , electrical machinery , appliances and parts grew to 58 % of total exports , which exceeded $ 40 billion last year . Labor Shortage Malaysia is essentially at full_employment , with labor shortages in the industrial regions . Restrictions on foreign workers were lifted in 1992 , but multinational firms generally must draw workers from rural_areas . Wages and benefits have risen faster than productivity . The average daily wage was about $ 6.50 last year , compared to $ 1.50 in Indonesia and Vietnam . However , Malaysia ' s skilled labor_force has begun to resemble those of countries with higher labor rates , such_as Singapore , South_Korea and Taiwan . Agriculture The government has encouraged palm_oil production since 1960 , and Malaysia is now the largest producer and exporter of the oil , accounting_for about 55 % of world production in 1992 . Overall , agriculture provided about 15.7 % of gross_domestic_product in 1992 and engaged 26 % of the population . But income is distributed unevenly in rural_areas because agriculture is divided into relatively high-income estates , predominantly owned by ethnic Indians and Chinese , and a low-productivity sector composed of indigenous groups . A major aim of the government has been to redress the balance . Consumer Demand Growth has created a large lower-middle class that seeks credit to buy durable goods and property . Although the government hopes to dampen demand for imports by restricting credit , consumer spending is robust . Passenger_car sales rose a remarkable 32.7 % in the third quarter of 1993 , and a new local vehicle factory is beginning operations . Rubber Traditionally the principal export , rubber has declined in importance . The acreage planted with rubber trees has been cut due_to falling prices and the labor shortage . In 1991 , Indonesia and Thailand superseded Malaysia as the world ' s major rubber producers . Tin and Oil Tin , another traditional export , has declined , making Malaysia the world ' s fifth- instead of second-largest producer . Of 847 tin mines operating in 1980 , only 63 were open in early 1993 . Meanwhile , oil has emerged as the largest export earner , accounting_for almost 9 % of the total in 1992 . About a quarter of the oil goes_to Singapore , while most of the rest is sent to Japan , South_Korea and Thailand . Reserves , mostly offshore , should keep production at current levels for at least another decade .
