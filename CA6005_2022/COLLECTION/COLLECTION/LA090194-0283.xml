   <HEADLINE> L.A. EXECUTIVE EXPECTED TO GET HELMICK ' S IOC SEAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch probably will recommend that James L . Easton , president of archery ' s international federation , fill the U.S. vacancy in the IOC , sources close to Samaranch said Wednesday . A Samaranch endorsement would virtually ensure Easton ' s election by the IOC ' s 89 members Monday . If this occurs , both IOC representatives in the United States will be from Los Angeles . Anita DeFrantz was elected in 1986 . Samaranch was expected to meet with U.S. Olympic Committee officials at the conclusion of the Olympic Centennial Congress ' second session Wednesday night to inform them of his decision . In July , USOC President LeRoy Walker presented Samaranch with a list of four preferred candidates that included former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young , USOC Executive_Director Harvey Schiller , USOC Vice_President Michael Lenard and International Swimming Federation Vice_President Ross Wales . Samaranch expanded the search to include the three international federation presidents from the United States -- Easton , George Killian of basketball and Don Porter of softball . Ultimately , sources said , it was Easton ' s involvement with a sports federation that earned him Samaranch ' s support over Young , chairman of Atlanta ' s organizing committee for the 1996 Games . In step with the Congress ' theme of unity , Samaranch has promised to give federations more representation within the IOC . Of 10 members due_to be elected Monday , he said this week that six will be presidents of international federations . But there has been so_much political infighting among candidates for those 10 positions and their supporters that Samaranch has threatened to postpone the election until next year . That , sources said , would be the only obstacle preventing Easton from becoming an IOC member Monday . It also would be frustrating for those involved with the Olympic movement in the United States , which has been without a second IOC member since Robert Helmick resigned under pressure amid a conflict-of-interest inquiry in 1991 . Easton , 59 , is president of a $ 100-million-a-year international sporting goods manufacturer , James D . Easton , Inc. and Easton Aluminum , Inc. of Van Nuys . Started by his father , the company was initially known for the aluminum arrows it manufactured but has diversified under Easton ' s leadership to produce ice_hockey sticks , baseball and softball bats , golf_club shafts , ski_poles and bicycle tubing . Like DeFrantz , Easton was an official with the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee in 1984 . Besides his duties as commissioner of archery , he also was mayor of the athletes ' village at his alma_mater , UCLA . Elected in 1989 as president of FITA , archery ' s international federation , he introduced changes to the competition that are credited with persuading the IOC that the sport should not be considered for elimination from the Olympics .</TEXT>
