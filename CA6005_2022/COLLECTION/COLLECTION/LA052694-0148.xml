   <HEADLINE> OIL FIRM SEEKS PUBLIC AGENCY DISPATCH FILES IN SPILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Threatened with legal_action from Ventura County , attorneys for the company that spilled 84 # 000 gallons of heavy crude into McGrath Lake have requested dispatch records from police and fire crews that were slow to respond . In a letter received this week , Mark R . Pachowicz , a former prosecutor who now works for a private law_firm , seeks &quot; any and all Oxnard Police_Department dispatch logs which pertain to or involve the release of oil at issue. &quot; The request on behalf of Bush Oil comes the same week that county supervisors declined to pursue a federal grant to fund an inventory of the area ' s underground oil and gas pipes . Three other significant pipeline-related leaks have blackened Ventura County canyons and waterways since the McGrath Lake spill near Oxnard , a fact that prompted supervisors to consider mapping underground pipes . No such maps now exist . The letter to the city of Oxnard also asks_for copies of all fire logs , tapes of communications between the city and the Ventura County Sheriff ' s Department , and any written police correspondence about the oil spill , which soiled miles of beaches and killed hundreds of migratory birds . Oxnard Assistant City Atty . Paula Kimbrell said the request , addressed to City Clerk Daniel Martinez , with copies sent to the city attorney and the police and fire_chiefs , would be complied with as soon as feasible . The letter comes as investigators wind down their probe of Bush Oil and Berry Petroleum , its Taft-based parent company . Criminal charges in the case could be filed within weeks , a prosecutor said Wednesday . An underground pipe operated by Bush Oil near Harbor Boulevard and Gonzales Road leaked for at least three days before federal_officials patrolling offshore_rigs noticed an oily sheen on the ocean Christmas morning . But by then , more_than 2 # 000 barrels of thick black crude had spilled from the ruptured pipeline , which Bush officials said transported no more_than 600 barrels of crude a day . A barrel contains 42 gallons . The Public Records Act request is an apparent attempt to limit the responsibility of Bush Oil , since at least six emergency response agencies , including Oxnard police and fire crews , ignored early reports of the spill . One state park ranger alerted by campers the day before Christmas about oil leaking into McGrath Lake was subsequently disciplined for failing to follow_up_on that sighting . Another Christmas_Eve morning report from a Ventura electrician to the Channel Islands Harbor Patrol was referred to Oxnard police and fire dispatchers without further investigation . Pachowicz said Wednesday that he does not know what information may be_on the dispatch logs he requested . &quot; I don ' t know whether it ' s going_to hurt or help our case , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t know what ' s in them . This is merely a request that we be provided the information. &quot; * Raymond Hatch , a Berry executive who has served as the firm ' s spokesman , would not discuss the case Wednesday . Special prosecutor Glen M . Reiser , the Oxnard attorney retained by the district_attorney to handle the case , said Wednesday that criminal charges could be filed against the oil_company within weeks . But Reiser downplayed the impact that the requested information would have_on the oil_company ' s defense . &quot; How quickly government_agencies reacted to the spill is meaningful from a public_service standpoint , but it doesn ' t relate to Berry ' s responsibility , &quot; he said . Reiser said criminal charges could result in state_prison for Berry executives if it can be proved that the oil_company knew or should have known that it was responsible_for allowing crude into marine waters . The criminal case could be filed either as a felony or misdemeanor , Reiser said , although even the lesser charge could mean County Jail time and a fine of $ 500 # 000 for each day that Bush is found liable . * The state_attorney general ' s office is putting_together a potential civil case , which must prove specific environmental damages . State inspectors are now assessing the immediate and long-term effects of the spill , Reiser said . &quot; Obviously , you can ' t make a decision overnight as_to what the environmental impact -- both chemically and geologically -- has been to the area , &quot; the special prosecutor said . State Fish and Game and other wildlife experts estimated shortly after the spill that it would take years , perhaps decades , for McGrath Lake to fully recover . In a related development , the Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday not to apply for a federal grant to map the lattice-work of underground oil and gas pipes_in the county and to assess the risk of future pipeline failures . Supervisors said they did not want to duplicate the efforts of Assemblyman Jack O ' Connell ( D-Carpinteria ) , who has introduced a bill that would require mapping of most of the buried oil and natural_gas pipes_in California . A hearing on that bill -- AB 3261 -- is scheduled June 1 before the Assembly Ways and Means committee , said Gavin Payne , O ' Connell ' s chief_of_staff . * Some board_members also said they are less concerned now about the risk of future pipeline breaks than they were immediately after the four winter spills . &quot; We have a much better state of affairs than we initially thought , &quot; said Supervisor Susan K . Lacey , who represents the McGrath Lake area . &quot; There were several leaks in a row and that led us to worry . But when we took a harder look_at it . . . everybody ' s comfort level went up. &quot; Supervisor John K . Flynn went even further , saying he opposes O ' Connell ' s efforts to map underground pipelines . &quot; The oil_companies pretty much know where those lines are , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t want to see the state come_down with all kinds of regulations that aren ' t going_to produce anything but a huge bill. &quot; Environmentalists Wednesday criticized the board ' s decision , saying local officials should not rely_on the state to define the extent of future problems . &quot; The least we could do is map the pipelines , &quot; said Cynthia Leake , vice_president of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County . Pat Baggerly , an Ojai Valley environmentalist , said supervisors apparently bowed to pressure from local oil interests . &quot; It sounds like they ' re courting the oil_industry , &quot; she said . &quot; But they can court the oil_industry and still know where all_the pipelines are. &quot; Times staff writer Daryl Kelley contributed to this report .</TEXT>
