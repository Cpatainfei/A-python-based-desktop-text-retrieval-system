   <HEADLINE> DORNAN ' S MILITARY OUSTER PROPOSAL FAILS ; LEGISLATION : O.C. CONGRESSMAN ' S EFFORT TO REMOVE SERVICE MEMBERS WHO ARE LIMITED BY HIV OR OTHER AILMENTS IS SUPPLANTED BY A MILDER VERSION IN THE HOUSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An effort by an Orange County congressman to oust from the military all service members who are HIV-positive or are restricted by a chronic illness was defeated Wednesday when the House approved a milder version that would allow discharge but would not require it . The requirement drafted by Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) as part of the annual defense authorization bill could have led to the immediate discharge of any member of the military whose assignment is limited by HIV , asthma , heart_disease , cancer or diabetes , among other ailments . But an offense mounted by Rep . Jane Harman ( D-Marina del Rey ) succeeded in heading_off Dornan ' s plan -- passed_by the House Armed Services Committee last month -- putting an end to a provision that could have removed about 3 # 600 service members . &quot; People who are_sick and serve well should be able to get_well , &quot; Harman said before her amendment carried , 227 to 192 . The Dornan provision was approved by the Armed Services Committee last month in what was later described by some as a harried , uninformed vote . Current military policy dictates that service members restricted by a medical condition be classified as &quot; non-worldwide assignable , &quot; meaning they are limited to serving stateside . Pentagon officials have testified that the existing policy works just fine . But Dornan argued that the policy places an unfair burden on healthier service members and is foolish in an era of dwindling defense budgets , when every military member must be at_the_ready . Dornan later acknowledged that his greatest concern was ridding the service of HIV-infected members , those , as he put it , &quot; who broke the law by sticking a needle in their arm. &quot; His plan was opposed not only by the Pentagon but by a roster of gay rights groups and medical associations , including the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Assn . If similar language is passed_by the Senate , the Harman amendment would still effect a new policy -- although a much less radical one -- that would allow discharge on a case-by-case basis if military officials see fit .</TEXT>
