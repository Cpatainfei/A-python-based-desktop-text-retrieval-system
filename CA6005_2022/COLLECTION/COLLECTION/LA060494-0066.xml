   <HEADLINE> COURIER SENT PACKING AS SPANIARDS RULE DAY ; FRENCH OPEN : BRUGUERA AND BERASATEGUI WIN THEIR MATCHES TO REACH SUNDAY ' S FINAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The French Open went south Friday as Spain ' s Sergi Bruguera and Alberto Berasategui advanced to the men ' s final in a dazzling display of clay-court tennis . Bruguera overwhelmed two-time champion Jim Courier , 6-3 , 5-7 , 6-3 , 6-3 , in one semifinal , and No . 24 Berasategui kept his record spotless with a 6-3 , 6-4 , 6-1 victory over No . 46 Magnus Larsson of Sweden in the other . Berasategui , 20 , has yet to lose a set_in his third French Open . So , two good friends will become foes Sunday on Center Court in the first all-Spanish final of any Grand_Slam tournament . They will follow another Spanish finalist , Aranxta Sanchez Vicario , who plays Mary Pierce today for the women ' s title . Which of the men will the Spanish favor ? &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; Bruguera said . &quot; Call and ask. &quot; Although not the biggest names in tennis , Bruguera and Berasategui have a lot to offer to all those weekend hackers . Like junkball pitchers , the Spaniards have won with guile , happily frustrating big servers with spinning forehands that lope to the baseline . On a blustery spring day in Paris , No . 6 Bruguera and No . 7 Courier met in a repeat of last year ' s final , won by the Spaniard in a dramatic five-setter . Yet , when the match began at noon Friday , Center Court was less than half full . When Courier lost his serve in the third game , Bruguera , who played only one Grand_Slam match between the 1993 and ' 94 French Opens , was in fine form . And it seemed he would win his sixth consecutive straight-set match after taking a 5-2 lead in the second set . Courier had lost his serve and his nerve in the fourth game when he was given a warning for uttering an obscenity . Courier ' s outburst resulted from a foot-fault . In the next game , he directed his anger inward , screaming at himself to swing at Bruguera ' s deep volleys after he had let one drop that he thought was long . But it was not until the ninth game , when the two had a rally befitting a Grand_Slam semifinal , that Courier quickened the pace . He became more aggressive and dictated Bruguera ' s movement . Taking_five consecutive games , Courier won the set and tied the score . Luis Bruguera said he was satisfied by his son ' s reaction to that . &quot; He ' s not a player who goes_down easily , &quot; the elder Bruguera said . &quot; He had no fear at that point. &quot; Luis Bruguera said Sergi ' s fighting spirit is his finest quality . Courier knows something about perseverance , too . But instead of finding his rhythm , Courier made some crucial mental mistakes in the third set , and the chance to reach his fourth consecutive final in Paris slipped_away . &quot; I was feeling that I had more power than him , that I can move him around and he cannot attack as well as last year , &quot; Bruguera said . Courier was disappointed with his play . &quot; What I lacked a little bit ( at ) the defining moments of the match was aggression , &quot; he said . &quot; I only seemed to find my aggression when I was down. &quot; Although it worked for him in the second set , once Courier fell_behind in the third and fourth sets Bruguera increased the pressure . He sent arching forehands into the deep recesses of the court , and Courier returned many into the net . Despite the swirling gusts that kicked_up dust_devils on the red_clay , Bruguera had an outstanding service game . He had seven aces , only one double fault . Courier , who made 64 unforced errors , had eight double faults . &quot; To beat Jim here is not easy , &quot; said Manuel Santana , Spain ' s two-time French Open champion from the 1960s . &quot; On clay , ( Sergi ) is the best player in the world. &quot; That might be true , but anyone who has watched Berasategui ' s clever game is expecting Sunday ' s final to be the kind of match that strains necks . Yet Berasategui , who grew_up in a Basque village near Bilbao , Spain , is not sure what to make of his run . &quot; I don ' t really believe it , &quot; he said . &quot; Someone has to come_up_to me and wake me up. &quot; Playing in a French Open final against Bruguera is not something he thought possible . Berasategui grew_up playing soccer and surfing the rugged coast of northwest Spain . But when his father , owner of an industrial construction firm , built a tennis_court near his office , Berasategui took_up the sport . He developed as a junior player , but nothing suggested such a rise . &quot; I simply can ' t imagine this situation , &quot; said Imanol Bollegui , Berasategui ' s youth coach . Larsson , Berasategui ' s semifinal opponent , could . With the wind playing havoc with his serve , Larsson was powerless . The lanky Swede needed to serve and volley effectively to stop Berasategui from running him off the court . &quot; Berasategui ' s forehand is so fast and so quick it is really hard to read where the ball goes , &quot; Larsson said . It goes_to the_French Open final , where Berasategui becomes the first unseeded player to reach the championship match since Mikael Pernfors in 1986 . Tennis Notes Lindsay Davenport and Lisa Raymond advanced to the women ' s doubles final with a 7-6 ( 7-2 ) , 6-7 ( 8-6 ) , 6-4 victory over Amanda Coetzer of South_Africa and Ines Gorrochategui of Argentina . They will face Gigi Fernandez and Natalia Zvereva of Belarus , 4-6 , 6-2 , 6-4 winners over France ' s Julie Halard and Nathalie Tauziat . . . . Bryon Black , a former USC star , and Jonathan Stark , formerly of Stanford , will play Sweden ' s Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman in the men ' s doubles final . Larisa Neiland of Ukraine and Andrei Olhovskiy of Russia will play Kristie Boogert and Menno Oosting of the_Netherlands in the mixed doubles final . For the record : Steffi Graf lost to Monica Seles in the 1993 Australian Open final . Graf ' s recent performance in Grand_Slam events was incorrect in a story in The Times on Friday .</TEXT>
