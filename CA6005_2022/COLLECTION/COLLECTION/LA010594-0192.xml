   <HEADLINE> BIG THREE ' S AUTO SALES SURGE 10.4 % ; CARS : DETROIT CONTINUED TO GRAB MARKET SHARE FROM THE JAPANESE IN 1993 . ANALYSTS SEE THE TREND LASTING SEVERAL YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chrysler Corp . picked an unusual venue for a dinner during the Detroit International Auto Show this week : a comedy club in the Motor_City ' s downtown theater district . Chairman Robert Eaton delivered a serious but upbeat state-of-the-company speech Monday night -- followed by a clever skit with the Second City comedy troupe that had his audience laughing out loud . &quot; This is where people come_to have fun , &quot; Eaton said . &quot; And we at Chrysler are having fun. &quot; The auto_maker has some company in Detroit . The Big Three -- all but given_up for dead three years ago -- reported Tuesday that their 1993 sales increased more_than 10.4 % over the previous year . Overall , sales in America of both domestic and import vehicles climbed 8.5 % to their highest level since 1990 . U.S. auto_makers continued to grab market share from their Japanese competitors . Just as important , there is growing recognition that the quality of U.S. cars and the efficiency of U.S. factories are at world-class levels . The expectations : Market trends will continue for several years , and auto sales should rise from 14 million last year to 15 million in 1994 . Bullish industry officials expect sales of a record 17 million within a_few years . &quot; The next two years can be seen as the years of the American car industry , &quot; said an admiring Helmut Panke , chairman and chief_executive of BMW ' s U.S. operations . The recovery in Detroit has come_with remarkable speed . Just two years ago -- when Chrysler , Ford and General Motors together had operating losses of about $ 4 billion -- the Big Three embarrassingly went hat in_hand to Japan with President Bush asking_for trade concessions . Now it is the Japanese who have long faces at the auto shows -- and the U.S. auto_makers who are gloating . The quick reversal of roles is as much a matter of circumstance and luck as it is the result of several years of gut-wrenching change and corporate soul-searching . In part , the sales surge has been spurred by pent-up demand and aggressive marketing . The average car in_use today is more_than 8 years old . People simply need to replace aging vehicles . Lower interest_rates and mortgage refinancings have freed up cash , putting willing buyers in the showrooms . The companies are advertising &quot; value &quot; prices , offering vehicles equipped with lots of options at lower costs . And all this interest in buying cars came just as the Japanese were being hampered by adverse currency fluctuations and economic problems in Tokyo . The yen gained more_than 15 % in value against the dollar before weakening slightly toward year ' s end . The yen ' s rise forced up the price of Japanese cars , giving U.S. auto_makers a price advantage of more_than $ 2 # 000 on most competing models . Just last week , Toyota and Nissan raised prices again . A severe recession in Japan has made matters worse . All the major Japanese auto_makers saw income drop sharply last year . The problems at_home were felt in U.S. subsidiaries , as management shake-ups and layoffs became commonplace . The reverberations left their mark on the marketplace . The Big Three now control 74 % of the U.S. market , up from 72.4 % at the end of 1992 . The Japanese have a 23 % share , down a point from the end of 1992 and down 3 points from year-end 1991 . Chrysler President Robert Lutz said Japan ' s share of the U.S. auto market could decline another 4 % to 5 % over the next four to five years . But others are more cautious . &quot; The Japanese are in a little bit of an uphill struggle , but I do not for one second undersell their ability to react , &quot; said Richard Wagoner , chief financial_officer of GM . Indeed , Toyota , Nissan and Honda are fighting_back by moving more production to the United States to counteract the yen ' s strength . They are also luring customers with incentives and attractive financing programs . &quot; We will take an aggressive position with short-term leasing , &quot; said Richard Colliver , Honda ' s vice_president of sales . Honda ' s sales were down 6.8 % in 1993 , apparently dropping the company to third place among importers , behind Toyota and a resurgent Nissan . The Japanese are also being hurt because they sell few trucks -- the hottest and most profitable segment of the U.S. vehicle market . That segment , which includes minivans , sport utility vehicles and pickups , is dominated by the Big Three . Detroit ' s truck sales were up 16 % last year ; car sales were up only 6 % . Ford ' s truck sales shot_up 19 % in 1993 , accounting_for 48 % of its total 3.6 million in U.S. sales . Chrysler reported an 18 % increase in truck sales , selling more_than 500 # 000 minivans . GM ' s truck sales jumped 13 % . Ford again counted the best-selling truck and car among its models : The F-Series pickup edged out Chevrolet ' s C / K pickup , and the Taurus sedan easily beat the Honda Accord for the second year in a row . Such news is apparent in Cobo Center , site of the Detroit Auto Show . The Big Three have held elaborate news_conferences , highlighted by the latest video technology and gimmickry . The Japanese firms ' announcements have been terse , somber affairs . Even GM executives appeared optimistic . The company has lost nearly $ 18 billion in North_America since 1990 . While it will report a loss in North_America for 1993 , the red ink has been sharply reduced , and GM promises a profit on the continent this year . John F . Smith , GM ' s chief_executive and president , said sales and profit should improve in 1994 as the company continues to cut costs and introduces new products , including a redesigned Chevrolet Cavalier and new GMC Jimmy sport utility vehicle . Probably no company is more upbeat than Chrysler . On Monday , the auto_maker announced that it will sell its subcompact Neon for a base price of $ 8 # 975 . On Tuesday , Chrysler used a secret-agent spoof to unveil its new Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus , which will go_on sale in the fall . An American Success Story Detroit auto_makers recaptured a chunk of the domestic market from their Japanese competitors in 1993 , driving total U.S. car and truck sales up for the year .
