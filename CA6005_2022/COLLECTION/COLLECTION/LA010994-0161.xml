   <HEADLINE> THE DOOMSDAY SPIN ; TALES OF RADIOATION TESTS SEEM TO PROVE EVERY CITIZEN ' S WORST NIGHTMARE ABOUT GOVERNMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The revelation could not have been more shocking : In 1945 , Eda Charlton , a seamstress who checked_into a Rochester , N.Y. , hospital for routine care , was , without her knowledge , injected with plutonium as part of a secret Manhattan_Project program to test the effects of radiation on human_beings . By the time she died in 1983 , at age 85 , Charlton had never been told the truth . Her children only recently learned the full details , when disclosures of secret tests of radioactivity on unsuspecting citizens became a leading news_event . Since any medical test performed without informed consent is an abomination , government mistreatment of Charlton was an outrage ; as were radiation tests staged , the Department_of_Energy admitted last month , on an estimated 800 additional Americans during the 1940s and 1950s with no meaningful approval from the subjects . Public anger about government duplicity and violation of rights is amply justified . But to maximize the instant-doomsday spin , the current controversy is skipping_over an inconvenient little complication : Hardly any actual harm was done , because the exposures involved were to extremely low levels of radiation . What ' s really going_on in the radiation testing controversy ? Consider several aspects . After the story broke , the Washington Post , reflecting the conventional wisdom , declared plutonium to be so dangerous that &quot; human contact with even one particle is guaranteed to cause cancer. &quot; Yet , Charlton was injected with far more and lived an additional four decades -- some 30 years longer than statistical expectancy for a white_woman of her birth year . And when she died , it was_due to a heart_attack -- not cancer . News_reports focus_on the violation of Charlton ' s rights and the scary facts of the experiment -- without mentioning the dose was incredibly tiny . Charlton received one-third of a microcurie of plutonium . A microcurie is millionth of a curie : One-third of a microcurie is far less radiation than caused by the new low-dose X-ray_machines . A common assertion in instant-doomsday literature is that plutonium has an almost mystical hyper-toxicity . No one doubts plutonium is extremely dangerous . But if what the Charlton case shows is that plutonium is just another dangerous substance that must be controlled , this would be terrible news to instant-doomsday orthodoxy . Similarly , many commentators now suggest that shocking horrors occurred when radiation was released in the 1940s and 1950s from the federal nuclear-bomb production plant at Hanford , Wash. , a facility that had minimal environmental safeguards in the Cold_War years , and , though now closed , still suffers from ecological blunders during its cleanup . Hanford releases are now regularly described in news accounts as &quot; hundreds of times worse than Three Mile Island. &quot; This is true -- but it tells more about the smallness of the Three Mile Island release than anything else . Average exposure downwind of Three Mile Island was about 10 millirems -- or about 3 % of the average annual background_level of 360 millirems that Americans receive from natural sources . Researchers have been studying the workers and 270 # 000 downwind residents of Hanford for seven years and , so far , have found &quot; no firm evidence that any of the releases harmed human health , &quot; the technical journal , Science , reported last week . The English researcher Alice Stewart , a leading authority on radiation , has studied Hanford workers from the Cold_War years -- workers being far more directly exposed than residents downwind . Stewart found they have , so far , experienced slightly less cancer than typical for Washington state . To my knowledge , none of the many news accounts about Hanford have mentioned Stewart ' s work . These new radiation stories resonate because the government has a history of lying_about early Cold_War atomic abuses . Federal_officials have long denied the truth about severe health damage suffered in the 1940s and 1950s by uranium miners , mainly Navajo Indians , who worked under subhuman conditions ; officials lied for years about the harm suffered by people living downwind of 1950s open-air nuclear tests and by soldiers deliberately exposed to fallout from atomic tests . This history of federal lies_about radiation abuses during the 1950s inclines commentators and the public to assume the worst about any new disclosure . Such an assumption is wise , for federal credibility on atomic matters is low to nonexistent . The Department_of_Energy has been claiming for years that the awful truth about the 1950s is finally out . This promise keeps turning_out to be false . In 1986 , the DOE declassified information about the infamous Green Run at Hanford , a test where radiation was emitted to track its distribution downwind . At that time , the DOE said the last abuses of the 1950s had finally been made public . Three years later , however , the DOE , under new Secretary James D . Watkins , began to admit to many_more unreported 1950s radiation leaks . Today , the new energy_secretary , Hazel R . O ' Leary , swears the last awful details are public . Who believes her ? No one . This scandal also resonates because a significant number of Americans exhibit an almost clinical paranoia in believing themselves victims of secret government tests -- the same way people regard fluoride in drinking_water as a conspiracy . Supermarket tabloids and right-wing call-in shows thrive on claims that people have suffered horrible , unsubstantiated abuses at the hands of evil government_agents , usually from an agency far more secret than the CIA . Now comes word that 800 people were actual victims of secret government tests : What great news for the paranoia industry ! Perhaps more to_the_point , in the United States one person in four develops cancer . This means there are millions of Americans who might wonder if their cancers were caused by evil government tests -- or might prefer to believe they were , rather than blame themselves for the lifestyles choices ( mainly cigarette smoking , high-fat diets and lack of exercise ) that medical researchers now believe account_for around 80 % of cancers . For , while many specifics of the testing scandal are new , much else is not . Information about the Green Run experiment was declassified in 1986 . The recently quoted memorandum warning top government officials that radiation medical tests suggest a &quot; touch of Buchenwald &quot; was declassified in 1974 . Some radiation tests currently being revealed as shocking new disclosures were even reported in open medical literature during the 1950s -- though with identifying details deleted . References_to the tests can be found in textbooks of radiological medicine . These tests formed the basis of radiological medicine . Of course , most people don ' t know that , since who , except bleary-eyed med students , ever opens a radiology textbook ? Some commentators have attempted limited defenses of these tests , by noting that 1950s politics were driven by Cold_War fears in which many sacrifices for nuclear knowledge seemed justified . And , at any rate , in the 1950s no one really knew whether radiation was dangerous , and research standards of the time were far loose than today . Now , the point about ignorance of radiation in the 1950s is true . For example , in the late 1940s , it was common for shoes_stores to blast children ' s feet with far stronger X-rays than today used in chest X-rays , in a gimmicky search for the &quot; scientific fit. &quot; This practice stopped only after a public campaign against it lead by a then-obscure pediatric surgeon named C . Everett Koop . Through the mid-1950s it was common for obstetricians , especially in England , to blast pregnant women ' s wombs with X-rays far stronger than the worst exposure in the current radiation testing controversy , to view the developing fetus . ( Harmless sonogram viewing of the fetus had yet to be developed. ) This practice , which today seems insane -- given that X-rays were shined on the fetus during early cell_division , the phase most vulnerable to mutation -- was stopped only after a campaign lead by Alice Stewart . But the rationale that standards of consent were more relaxed is a whitewash . The standards were just as strong in the 1950s as today . The reason researchers were sneaking around about the radiation tests is that they knew the subjects would never give consent if fully informed . This violation of patients ' right represents a genuine outrage , undimmed by any notion of changing ethics . To emphasize the mad-scientist spin , accounts suggest people were exposed to radiation in the 1950s to make them sick . In the case of prison inmates , whose testicles were irradiated to induce sterility , this is true and an ethical outrage . But in other cases , the radiation was used not to induce sickness but as a tracer in a test of something else . For example , the children at the Fernald State School in Waltham , Mass. , who , without parents ' true consent , received breakfast cereal that was slightly radioactive were being studied to see how the body absorbs nutrients . Using radiation as a tracer is an entirely respectable form of research or therapy : exactly what a barium scan is , for instance . That many of the 1950s tests involved radiation being used as a tracer is being downplayed . Because in tracer experiments , only minute doses are used ; doomsayers would rather that go unmentioned . For years , a large team of federal researchers has been engaged in something called the Hanford Dose Reconstruction Study , trying to estimate how much radioactivity was released . The study ' s authors now believe that , from 1944-47 -- the peak period for Hanford leaks -- about 685 # 000 curies of radiation were released . The Three Mile Island leak was about 17 curies . Yet it may be that Hanford workers are not especially sick . The most basic reason for this counterintuitive outcome is that most of the radiation , like most radiation in bomb-test fallout , did not result in exposure . Though nuclear wastes have half-lives thousands of years long , the most common form of radioactivity in fallout and Hanford leaks was iodine 131 -- with a half-life of eight days . If washed_out of the air by rain , iodine 131 can be quite dangerous . If carried_away on the winds , it soon cools to harmlessness . Most of the Hanford leaks , like most nuclear-test fallout , was carried_away rather than washed_down onto the innocent . There were tragic and horrible exceptions . Some people who lived immediately downwind , particularly children who played outside because their parents were not warned , suffered horrible deaths at young ages . But the majority of &quot; downwinders &quot; were only mildly exposed . Another reason the Hanford leaks may have done less harm than expected is the emerging scientific understanding that all mammal bodies possess some genetic resistance to radiation . After all , human_beings evolved in an environment constantly exposed to natural radiation from the sun and from mild natural radioactivity in some ores and some forms of soil . Here ' s a paradox : The natural background_radiation in Denver , Colo. , is about 50 % higher than in most U.S. cities , because Colorado has mildly radioactive soil and the thinner air of the mile-high_city allows_in more solar and cosmic radiation . Yet , Denver also has a notably lower rate of cancer than other cities . Oddities such_as this have caused some researchers , prominently Rosalyn Yalow , to suspect that small exposures to radiation may be slightly beneficial . Yallow won the Nobel Prize in 1977 for her part in the development of the radioimmunoassay -- the basic test by which radioactive harm to the body is measured . The important message of the unauthorized 1950s radiation tests is that even liberal democratic governments sometimes cheerfully ignore the rights of citizens . No warning of the danger of casual government abuse of civilians can ever be exaggerated . By contrast , the instant-doomsday aspects of the scandal appear largely hyperbole . For years , the environmental community has advanced the notion that even small amounts of radiation represent a mystical mega-danger , of which society ought to live_in utter dread . Why do they so vehemently warn against what is , at worst , a speculative threat ? Because nuclear-power plants cannot explode but can emit tiny amounts of radiation . Continuing public dread of even tiny levels of radiation is the enviros ' main argument against nuclear_power -- which has many problems but which , on ecological grounds , may actually be good for society . ( No greenhouse gases , no air_pollution , no strip_mining or oil spills. ) Now , as the radiation-testing abuses and radiation leaks of the 1950s continue to be disclosed and assessed , and the health damage caused continues to appear nowhere near as bad as projected , the 1950s scandals may become an argument that low levels of radiation are far less worrisome than once assumed .</TEXT>
