   <TEXT> * In response to &quot; Taming the Monster : Get Rid of the Guns , &quot; Dec . 28 : As stated by this editorial , the whole answer to our nation ' s crime and homicide problem is to get_rid_of guns . Personally , I think it is absurd . Look_at just this past year ; how many random shooting sprees there have been -- from San Francisco to just recently in New York , where a gunman opened_fire on innocent civilians . If just one of our many law-abiding citizens was concealing a weapon , the massacres could have ended before they started . If responsible , educated , law-abiding gun owners give_up their guns , no doubt their chance of becoming a statistic will increase dramatically . RON DAUB Woodland Hills * We strongly support your stand on gun_control . suggest that you take an additional step : Call_for repeal of the anachronistic Second Amendment to the Constitution . Rather than go_through the already well-researched and rehearsed reasons supporting repeal , we will content ourselves with noting that the Second Amendment can well be likened to the vermiform_appendix in the human_body . Both appendixes , human and political , while having served useful functions in the evolutionary and political past , now serve only as centers of danger and inflammation . AUGUSTINE and HORACE GAIMS Los Angeles * You ask the question : Who could be against such measures as mandatory waiting periods , heavy taxes and limits on ammunition and restrictions on certain types of guns ? I could ! I am a law-abiding citizen who happens to enjoy shooting sports . Your editorial position continues to miss the point : Your virtually total ban on guns will only affect people like me and will not reduce violent crime . The only guns turned_in under a total ban on private gun ownership will be by citizens like myself . The criminals who use guns to ply their trade will not be handing in theirs . The federal_government has done a miserable job of controlling drug_traffic ( drugs are still the major cause of gang-related violence -- hint , hint ) . How can they enforce a ban on guns carried by criminals ? MICHAEL E . SMITH Placentia * Your editorial does not go_far enough . The government should immediately prohibit the sale of all handgun and assault weapon ammunition . This would prohibit the importation of these goods , and the manufacturing of them in the United States . This would greatly shorten the &quot; shelf_life &quot; of those weapons which are currently in the hands of those who use them to break the law , as well as those which cause accidents . The Second Amendment clearly qualifies the right to bear arms as it relates to the security of a free_state , and a well-regulated militia . What the National Rifle Assn . has promoted has resulted in a non-regulated anarchy which threatens not only the security of our free_states , but the militias ( police ) of those free_states as well . When the constitutional rights of the few who own ammunition plants meet head-on with the former rights of the many thousands killed by the bullets they make , is there any question as_to whose rights should be curtailed until a better solution is found ? DAVID V . SHEEHAN II San Clemente * Your implicit editorializing on the positions that armed criminals can be trusted to turn_in their guns , and that otherwise law-abiding citizens who don ' t should be imprisoned , is thoroughly asinine . THOMAS R . KRAG Arcadia * I feel that you avoid the problem . Your proposal deals with those who seek to buy guns legally . The problem does not lie_with law-abiding citizens , though they do account_for a minute portion of gun-related deaths . The problem lies_with the underground -- the criminal element . What needs to be done is enactment of tougher laws on gun dealers and also on those caught with guns that were illegally obtained . There are many different opposing arguments to gun_control , one of the most important being the constitutional defense . But it primarily comes_down to whether or not we , as a_people , are going_to allow ourselves to be armed against those who choose to violate our property , our family , our society , and fundamentally , our freedom . WILLIAM PERALES Cerritos * Kudos for the revealing series , &quot; America ' s Gun Epidemic. &quot; Finally Russia , the &quot; evil empire , &quot; accepts the futility of an arms race with the U.S. and we can ' t handle it . We start our own , as too many paranoid Americans rush to buy more guns under the guise of protection . can ' t they understand that if the money used to buy these guns was donated to law_enforcement professionals it would go_a_long_way toward solving escalating crime tragedies ?
