   <HEADLINE> CSUN ATHLETICS PROGRAM WORTH SUPPORTING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In response to your article and editorial regarding the Cal State Northridge athletic referendum that was defeated , I think that Bob Heigert has a point . As a former cheerleader , student and graduate of CSUN , I am glad that the athletic program at Northridge was strong during my years there . It not only gave me the opportunity to experience what Heigert calls &quot; the college experience , &quot; but it also gave me a perspective on how hard it is for players to not only cope_with school , grades and jobs ( part and full-time ) , but also to play_on an athletic team . To defeat this referendum and to say that the CSUN administration needs to &quot; rethink &quot; its position on backing the athletics program is a slap in the face to all those athletes who are working , playing and learning at_the_same_time . It ' s a fact : Northridge has had a hard year . But to say that athletics needs to suffer because of it is wrong . CSUN ' s athletic programs are successful and win -- check it out , go_to a game and then make a decision . And to the older and job-holding students , take your children to a game . Northridge sports aren ' t just for &quot; college-age &quot; students , they are for the community . PAMELA HOFFMAN Calabasas * Your editorial , &quot; Heed CSUN Student Vote on Sports &quot; ( Oct . 23 ) makes a valid point about listening to students ' needs , but it reveals some shortsightedness as well . CSUN , by its own admission , has been struggling for fame while it lingers in the shadows of UCLA and USC . Sports bring that fame , and fame brings money . How popular would Duke University be if its basketball_team weren ' t on TV every Saturday during basketball_season ? And what would people think_of Notre Dame if it got no recognition from football ? Both Duke and Notre Dame have strong academic traditions , but chances are neither would be as popular as they are , nor would they have the money to spend on faculty , campus improvements and other areas of importance , if sports didn ' t play such a big role for them . Sports generate revenue . By passing the referendum , students would have committed themselves to an extra $ 49 per semester . That would have been an added pressure to some but an investment in a long-term commitment to the university . CSUN has a good reputation in Southern California , but beyond that many people have never heard of it . A strong sports program is likely to attract local TV and corporate sponsorship , which in turn means donations from local and national companies , For now , that money is earmarked for athletics . But as soon as those programs are up and running , the money goes_to the business , science and music_departments . As a graduate of CSUN , I know part of the reason so few students voted is because so few care to have a voice in student politics . But a recognizable campus -- for sports and academics -- will mean a more active student body , a more recognized university and a more respected name in the community .
