   <HEADLINE> BACKPACK &amp; BUDGET ; NEW HOSTEL HAS IRISH EYES SMILING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new Belfast International Youth_Hostel is_due to open April 1 in a convenient central location in Northern_Ireland ' s capital . The 128-bed hostel , at 22 Donegall Road ( from the United States , phone 011-44-232-324733 ) , is near Queen ' s University , the Ulster Museum and the Botanic Rail Station . Two- and four-bedded rooms start at $ 11.75 per night . Three family_rooms , each with six beds , are also available . The hostel ' s central location -- and the fact that it will be open 24 hours , with a security officer on_duty -- is a boon for backpackers who arrive in off-hours . Belfast lacks public luggage-storage facilities due_to its political problems . The old Belfast youth_hostel , which is closing at the end of this month , was about 2 1 / 2 miles outside the city . Security may well be_on the minds of novice visitors to Belfast . According to the authors of the 1994 edition of &quot; Let ' s Go : Ireland &quot; ( Harvard Student Agencies ; $ 15.99 ) , &quot; Belfast is actually safer for tourists than most American cities . The city_center , the ' Golden Mile , ' and the university area to its south rarely see any trouble. &quot; They warn , however , that West Belfast , &quot; full of joblessness , anger and amazing political art , should only be seen by day. &quot; The 384-page guidebook also advises travelers of areas in which not to walk or hitchhike at night , and warns them to avoid taking photos of the military , to cross borders only at approved checkpoints and to avoid big cities when large marches are scheduled . Those who travel_to any Irish port by sea can often get discounts with their student , youth or youth_hostel membership_card . There are ferry services directly to Belfast from Liverpool , England , and to Larne ( five miles from Belfast ) from Stranraer , Scotland . Two lines -- B &amp; I and Sealink -- offer members of Hostelling International a 25 % discount . B &amp; I also offers a 25 % discount to International Student Identity_Card holders and a 50 % discount to students who purchase a special Travelsave stamp from the_Irish Student Travel Service . Last fall , the Youth_Hostels Assn . of Northern_Ireland ( YHANI ) and the Northern_Ireland Tourist Board introduced a new computerized booking system for the seven YHANI hostels in Northern_Ireland . It ' s now possible to go_into any tourist information center in Ireland and , for a small fee , make a reservation for a bed in any YHANI hostel . Outside of Belfast , the fee for a bed averages about $ 9 per night . Although most guests are under 25 , there are no age restrictions . * Northern_Ireland is barely 85 miles from north to south and slightly wider east to west . One of the country ' s most popular tourist sites is the Giant ' s Causeway . Formed by volcanic activity , it consists_of 38 # 000 tightly packed columns , some of them 40 feet tall , which form stepping stones to the sea . The following hostels , all_of them inspected by the tourist board , are situated near the Giant ' s Causeway : * YHANI Whitepark Bay Youth_Hostel , Whitepark Road , Ballintoy , is seven miles from the Causeway . It has 44 beds , and rates start at $ 8.75. * McCool ' s Independent Youth_Hostel , 5 Causeway View Terrace , Portruksh , actually has a view of the Causeway . It has 14 beds , and rates start at $ 9 . * Causeway Coast Independent Hostel , 4 Victoria Terrace , Portstewart , has a direct bus link to Giant ' s Causeway from the hostel . Beds start at $ 7.35.
