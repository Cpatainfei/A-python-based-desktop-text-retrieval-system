   <HEADLINE> SLIDE IN PRICE OF OIL LEADS TO BUST AND BOON ; ENERGY : LOCAL COMPANIES FARE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THEIR ROLE IN THE INDUSTRY . SOME ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR OUTLOOK BY DIVERSIFYING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A sharp drop_in oil prices over the past year has hurt two local oil producers and a drilling equipment company , but the change has also helped a maker of liquid asphalt . The production companies -- Benton Oil and Gas Co . in Oxnard and Agoura Hills-based Fortune Petroleum Corp . -- both reported large losses in 1993 , due in part to the decline in oil prices . Santa Paula-based H &amp; H Oil Tool Co. , which supplies drilling equipment and services to oil and gas producers , has seen its profits and revenues climb even though its business has slowed in some areas because low oil prices have contributed to a slowing of certain drilling activities . However , Huntway Partners in Valencia had a profit turnaround in the latter part of 1993 , after losses in 1992 and the first_half of last year . Part of the reason for the improvement is that crude_oil is the key ingredient in the liquid asphalt Huntway makes , so low oil prices amount to big cost savings for the company . Oil prices , notoriously vulnerable to political events , spiked as high as $ 40 a barrel during the Gulf War in 1991 . But in the past year , prices have been held_down by worldwide oversupply as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has failed to reach agreement to cut production . The price of crude_oil hit about $ 13 a barrel in early April , down from $ 20 about a year ago . Although oil prices have risen to about $ 16.50 currently , many analysts expect them to remain soft for some time . John M . Selser , an oil and natural_gas analyst at the investment_firm Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs in New Orleans , expects that oil prices will remain in the $ 15-to- $ 16-a-barrel range for the next couple of years . Benton Oil and Fortune Petroleum say they ' ve responded to falling oil prices by spending more money exploring for natural_gas , which has had relatively strong prices recently . The price of natural_gas is currently about $ 2.15 per 1 # 000 cubic_feet , compared with as little as $ 1 a_couple_of years ago . Analyst Selser thinks gas will reach $ 2.25 next year . Local oil_companies have had other troubles as well . Benton Oil last month reported a $ 4.8-million net loss for 1993 , compared with a year-earlier loss of $ 2.9 million , while its revenue fell 9 % , to $ 7.8 million from $ 8.6 million in 1992 . The big loss and revenue decline last year was mostly due_to lower domestic oil and gas production , the company said . But Benton Oil spokesman Gregory Grabar said declining oil prices probably accounted_for 10 % of the drop_in revenue . This year the company is curtailing its domestic oil activities , centered in the Gulf Coast region of Louisiana , and is instead planning to drill four to six deep natural_gas wells there . &quot; We as a company right now are about 90 % oil , &quot; said Grabar . &quot; We ' d like to change that mix and get more natural_gas production. &quot; He said Benton will also cut capital_expenditures on its Russian joint_venture in western Siberia because of a $ 4.70-per-barrel oil export tax imposed by the Russians -- which Benton and other American oil_companies are hoping will be rescinded -- coupled with low oil prices . However , Grabar said Benton will continue to emphasize its oil and gas projects in its third production area , in Venezuela . Benton doesn ' t actually own the oil and gas reserves from its Venezuelan drilling operations , but rather is paid by the country under an agreement that gives Benton some protection from the ups and downs of the prices of those commodities . Falling oil prices were cited by Fortune Petroleum as a major reason for its big 1993 loss . The company took a one-time , $ 1.9-million charge in the fourth quarter because of lower oil prices , which contributed to its $ 3.65-million loss for the year on a 31 % increase in revenue to $ 2.83 million . Tyrone J . Fairbanks , Fortune ' s vice_president and chief financial_officer , said that his company derived 80 % of its revenue from California oil_production a_few years ago , but it has shifted focus and made acquisitions to lessen its dependence on oil . It is now positioned to receive about 75 % of its revenue from natural_gas production in Texas , he said , which should begin showing_up in the company ' s financial results this year . Fairbanks said there are other factors making natural_gas more attractive . The demand for natural_gas , a relatively clean-burning fuel , will strengthen as states and municipalities enforce clean-air requirements and if auto_makers ever mass-produce natural-gas vehicles , he said . &quot; We ' re quite intently focusing_on natural_gas and not on oil_production , &quot; Fairbanks said . &quot; We want to make_sure Fortune is positioned for what the future is going_to bring. &quot; H &amp; H Oil Tool President and Chief_Executive Henry H . Rushing said that low oil prices combined with California ' s discouraging regulatory climate has hurt his business renting drilling and production equipment . &quot; We can ' t make_it if the oil_companies can ' t make_it , &quot; he said . Indeed , 75 % of H &amp; H ' s revenue last year came from California , but Rushing said its California operations were not profitable . H &amp; H did report a $ 1.55-million profit for 1993 , compared to a year-earlier loss of $ 1.76 million , while its revenue rose 9 % to $ 21.7 million from $ 19.9 million . But Rushing said all_the earnings were generated by its operations in Rocky Mountain_states such_as Utah and Wyoming that it acquired over the past few years . Natural_gas and even some oil_production has continued in the Rocky Mountain region , he said , because the costs for complying with regulations there are far lower for oil exploration companies than in California . For that reason , Rushing said that H &amp; H will continue to emphasize its out-of-state business . Last year , the company spent half its capital budget outside California ; this year , it will be 75 % , he said . While some companies have been hurt by low oil prices , for Huntway Partners the price drop has provided needed relief . A year ago , the company revised its loss for the first nine months of 1992 to $ 10.9 million , compared to a $ 1.9-million loss it had reported earlier . It said its former chief financial_officer had misstated inventories , accounts_payable and other assets . Huntway has since restructured its debt and shut_down its Arizona liquid asphalt refinery operations to cut costs . It recovered with a $ 1.09-million profit in the fourth quarter of last year , although for all_of 1993 it lost $ 18.7 million on a 4 % decline in revenue to $ 100.9 million . Warren J . Nelson , Huntway ' s executive_vice_president and chief financial_officer , hired after his predecessor was fired for the accounting errors , said that oil prices are critical to the company because crude_oil is the main ingredient in its products and its biggest cost item . In the fourth quarter of 1993 , Nelson said , Huntway ' s average price for crude_oil was about $ 3 a barrel cheaper than in the second quarter . With sales of about 1.2 million barrels a quarter , that represents a savings of $ 3.6 million . Although some of those savings dissipate as Huntway lowers prices on its asphalt products , much of it goes_to the bottom_line , Nelson said , and so has helped the company regain profitability .</TEXT>
