   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; WATERFRONT LAWMEN ; LITTLE-KNOWN PORT POLICE_OFFICERS PATROL ON LAND , SEA AND AIR TO SAFEGUARD LIVES AND PROPERTY IN THE SPRAWLING HARBOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a city swarming with law_enforcement agencies , the Port Police may be the least-known cops who ever walked , drove , pedaled , flew or swam a beat . Everybody has heard of the Los Angeles Police_Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department . Most people are probably aware of airport , transit and school police , not to mention local police_departments from Burbank to El Segundo . Except for those who live or work_at the Port of Los Angeles , it ' s probably fair to say that most Angelenos have never heard of the Port Police . In fact , while South Bay residents may be aware that the Port of Los Angeles is one of the busiest commercial shipping ports in the world , people in Van Nuys or Pasadena or Beverly Hills tend to think that the port is some kind of marina . Actually , it ' s a teeming center of industrialism interspersed with pockets of recreational activity , 28 miles of waterfront where oil tank farms , lumber yards and auto storage facilities sit cheek by jowl with marinas and beaches and restaurants with harbor views . It ' s a place where freighters tie_up near luxury cruise_ships , where grimy commercial fishing_boats share the water with private yachts . Every year more_than $ 60 billion worth of goods pass_through the port , bound to and from almost every country in the world . Every day about 50 # 000 people pour into the port area to work . For hundreds of others , the &quot; live-aboards &quot; in the more_than 4 # 000 marina slips , the port is their permanent home . For others , the transients who sneak into container yards and set_up housekeeping in empty shipping boxes , the port is a temporary home . Patrolling and protecting all that are the Port Police , 55 sworn officers who patrol on land , in the air , on the water and even under the water . But you ' ll never read a book or see a movie in which the hero draws his gun and shouts , &quot; Freeze ! LAPP ! &quot; &quot; We ' re the best-kept secret in law_enforcement , &quot; says Lt . Ronald Boyd , Port Police operations commander . * When he ' s working his special assignment beat , Port Police_Officer Robert Myers doesn ' t come face to face with criminals . He comes face to face with fish . About twice a month , Myers and others on the Port Police dive team put_on scuba gear and descend into the oily , silty , bacteria-rich black water of the Port of Los Angeles to search ships . Armed only with flashlights , and working in water where the visibility may be measured in inches , they creep slowly along the bottoms of boats , looking_for stashes of drugs concealed in rudders or stabilizer tubes or sea_chests , the large grated openings that serve as water intakes for engine cooling systems . Sometimes they find what they ' re looking_for . A couple of years ago , for example , dive team members found 55 kilos of cocaine sealed_in welded metal boxes hidden below the waterline on a freighter from South_America . Myers admits that it can get kind of spooky down there . &quot; When everything around you is black and all you can hear is the sound of your breathing , it gets a little claustrophobic , &quot; says Myers , 36 , an officer for the last dozen years , first with the Burbank Airport Police and for five years with the Port Police . &quot; We ' ve had some people drop_out after their first dive . It ' s not exactly fun diving . But after a while , you get used to it. &quot; It ' s not exactly clean diving , either , particularly after a downpour sends every conceivable kind of bacteria and assorted other crud flowing through the storm drains and into the harbor . If the bacteria level is too high , the divers won ' t dive unless it ' s an emergency . They all carry mouthwash and anti-bacterial eardrops to reduce the risk of infection from a dive . The 12-member dive team was formed in 1989 . All its members are volunteers who work patrol or other duties but are called_in when divers are needed . Dive team members do ship searches -- in conjunction with the U.S. Customs Service -- rescues , underwater searches for contraband or evidence ( such_as weapons ) , even retrieval of Harbor Department equipment from the ocean_bottom . In water that ranges from 30 to 60 feet deep , dive team members have to be prepared to find virtually anything on the bottom . &quot; There are crabs down there , &quot; says Myers . &quot; When you ' re doing a bottom search , you can ' t see very well because the silt gets stirred_up . So when you pick_up something and it bites you , it ' s a little surprising. &quot; There ' s also the usual jetsam : beer_cans and bottles , as well as boat parts , tools -- almost anything that can fall_off a boat or wash through the storm drains . Divers recently found a 40-foot-long piece of machinery . Sometimes they find stolen cars . And in the past , they occasionally found cars with bodies in them . &quot; Until a_few years ago , at least twice a year we ' d get people and cars going_into the water , &quot; says Lt . Martin Renteria , Port Police_investigations and administration commander , who heads the dive team . Most of those cases were distraught people who drove their cars off wharves . After the port began putting_up barricades at potential suicide sites , Renteria said , the port suicide rate dropped dramatically . * Swimming around in murky water is only one of the duties of the Port Police . Operating under the Los Angeles Harbor Department , with an annual budget of about $ 6 million , the officers also protect the port and enforce environmental laws . Burglaries , robberies , truck hijackings , domestic arguments in the marinas , car thefts , assaults , and traffic violations by boats and vehicles all part of the job . Port Police_officers also perform foot and bike patrols in the Ports O ' Call Village , a waterfront restaurant and retail complex ; the World Cruise Center , the embarking point for cruise_ships , and at the Cabrillo Beach recreation area . Port Police_officers make about 175 arrests each year . The safety and environmental duties are more unusual . Last year , Port Police_officers conducted nearly 30 # 000 safety inspections in container terminals , oil tank farms and ships berthing at the port . They also check the channels and other harbor areas for illegal dumping or discharge of hazardous wastes . According to the people they serve , the port cops are doing a bang-up job . &quot; They ' re great , &quot; says Damaris Rausch , manager of the California Yacht Marina in the eastern portion of the port . &quot; Any time we ' ve called they ' ve gotten_out here immediately . They always seem friendly , and they ' re very helpful. &quot; Bob Kleist , a spokesman for Evergreen shipping lines , one of the port ' s largest companies , agrees . &quot; They ' re totally professional , extremely cooperative , well-motivated , well-directed , &quot; Kleist said . &quot; I think they do an outstanding job. &quot; Despite recurrent rumors that the Port Police would be absorbed by the Los Angeles Police_Department , Boyd says it ' s not true . &quot; That rumor has been downgraded to even less than a rumor , &quot; he says . &quot; This is our swimming_pool , and we ' re going to continue to protect it. &quot; Like most police_officers , they feel underpaid : a non-supervisory officer makes about $ 2 # 800 to $ 3 # 200 a month . The salary is a sore point with most of them , as are the limited retirement and disability_benefits . But most port officers say they would n ' t want to work anywhere else . They especially like the diversity of the job . One day they ' re on patrol in a squad_car , another day they ' re on bikes , another day they may be diving or making environmental inspections from a helicopter . &quot; I like the flexibility , &quot; says Officer Daniel Aleman , a 13-year veteran . &quot; For example , I ' m a helicopter observer , I ' m on the bike team , and I ' m a senior patrol_boat officer . This job allows us to wear a lot of different hats. &quot; * &quot; Water looks pretty clean today , &quot; Aleman says as he peers out the window of a Bell 206 helicopter , 600 feet above the port . Aleman is an observer on the chopper , which is owned and operated by the city General Services_Department . Aleman ' s mission is to check the water for signs of environmental contamination . That can range from a leaky oil pipe connection to a commercial fisherman illegally pumping out his bilges in the harbor . Aleman also checks for breached fences at container terminals , evidence of break-ins on warehouse roofs and signs of anything out of the ordinary . If he spots something on the water , he will summon the Port Police patrol_boat by radio to check it out , and if necessary cite the offender . If he spots something on the ground , a land unit takes_care of it . * &quot; It ' s definitely not like being a forest ranger , &quot; says Port Police_Officer Robert Reynolds as he steers his patrol_car through a huge yard full of metal shipping containers stacked three and four high . &quot; There ' s a lot of chemicals around here , hazardous waste stuff . You don ' t even know what it is. &quot; Reynolds , a five-year veteran who earlier worked as an airport police_officer , is_on routine patrol today , which means that he ' ll cruise through everything from container yards to junk yards to slag heaps to the marinas -- some upscale and some not -- that line the waterfront . At night , some of the container storage yards become home to transient drug_addicts and prostitutes . There ' s also a lot of people contact . And not all_of it is bad . As Reynolds drives through a marina parking_lot , the owner comes_out to greet him . &quot; Appreciate you coming_by , &quot; the owner says , waving . &quot; Nice to see you. &quot; &quot; People down here are pretty friendly , &quot; Reynolds says . &quot; I think that ' s because we ' re friendly . We know all_the people . We were doing community-based policing before they even called it community-based policing. &quot; * &quot; It ' s kind of like a housing project , &quot; Officer Dave Knight , 51 , says as Port Police patrol_boat Bravo 15 cruises past a marina . &quot; You get everything here that you ' d get_in any residential_area -- burglaries , domestic fights , drugs , everything. &quot; Knight and his partner , Officer Henry Gomez , 41 , are two of the six Port Police_officers permanently assigned to the department ' s two patrol_boats . Knight has spent the last eight years on the boats . He is a 15-year veteran of the Port Police . &quot; It ' s a good job , &quot; he says . &quot; I like being out on the water. &quot; Not everyone is necessarily glad to see him , though . On this day Knight spots a boater who ' s exceeding the 5 m.p.h. inner harbor speed_limit . He waves him over and does a safety inspection -- checking for life_jackets and other safety gear -- and then cautions him about speeding . The boat driver has an explanation : He was having motor trouble and needed to rev_up a little to keep the motor running . Knight lets him go . Ten or 20 times a weekend , people aren ' t so lucky . They ' ll get speeding or safety violation citations . &quot; We try to maintain good relations with the public , &quot; Knight says . &quot; But we have to think_about safety too. &quot; * Port Police Detective Ken Huerta remembers well the strangest thing that he ' s ever seen stolen by cargo thieves . It was an entire truckload of rubber adult toys . It just goes_to show you , Huerta says , that cargo thieves will steal anything . Cargo_containers , also known as &quot; cans , &quot; are the 20- to 40-foot metal boxes that can be transferred from a ship to a truck or rail car . Port thefts have included containers packed full of disposable diapers , children ' s clothes , toys , bottled water , and quart cans of motor_oil . It ' s not uncommon for thieves to sneak into a freight yard somewhere in the vast industrial sections of the Los Angeles area , hot-wire a parked semi-tractor trailer and simply drive through a gate or crash a fence . Other times , they will catch a truck_driver at a stop light , stick a gun in his face and take the truck . The thieves can be murderous . Last year , hijackers shot and killed a truck_driver near Wilmington . Sometimes , though , the drivers are in on it . A &quot; broker &quot; will approach a driver who ' s making $ 5 an hour , non-union , and offer him $ 5 # 000 to give_up a truck and then report it stolen . Often , Huerta says , the broker gets the truck and pays the driver only $ 500 or so , if he pays him at all . It ' s a huge business , probably the biggest criminal enterprise in Los Angeles , next to drug dealing . A container full of Pampers , for example , may be worth $ 40 # 000 , and can be sold illegally , wholesale , for about $ 20 # 000 . Container burglaries , in which the can is broken_into in a yard and some of its contents taken , are a different category of crime . Huerta figures that every day in the Los Angeles area , about $ 1 million worth of goods are stolen or hijacked by cargo thieves . Four years ago it was even worse , Huerta says . that ' s when several law_enforcement agencies -- including the Port Police , Sheriff ' s Department , LAPD and FBI -- created Cargo CATs , the Cargo Criminal Apprehension Team . Huerta , 42 , a burly ex-Marine and 13-year Port Police veteran , is his department ' s specialist in container thefts . Most of Huerta ' s work takes_place outside the port . Although several years ago the theft or hijacking of containers was a serious problem in the port area , recent security measures suggested by the Port Police -- such_as encircling the container yards with heavy cables in addition to fences -- have virtually eliminated the problem inside the port . In 1993 , five containers were stolen from inside the port area , compared to more_than 500 container thefts and truck hijackings in the rest of the L.A. Basin . As for container burglaries , Huerta says about one or two are reported to the Port Police every month , although the actual number may be much higher . Often , shipping_companies don ' t bother to report such break-ins . That , Huerta says , is part of the problem . Too many companies accept cargo thefts as a fact of life , and don ' t invest in security measures . &quot; A lot of big shipping_companies just factor_in a 5 % loss of their cans , &quot; he says . &quot; They don ' t care because that loss just gets passed_on to the consumer. &quot; The stolen merchandise usually doesn ' t wind_up in flea_markets or the black_market , either , Huerta says . &quot; Most of the buyers are so-called legitimate businesses who buy_it for one-third or one-half wholesale , &quot; Huerta says . &quot; A lot of them will then sell the stuff at close-out sales. &quot; But things have gotten_tougher for cargo thieves since Cargo CATs was created , Huerta says . So far , the unit has made more_than 400 arrests and recovered more_than $ 70 million in stolen property . But Huerta estimates that the recoveries are less than a quarter of the items stolen . And he doesn ' t figure he ' ll be out_of_work anytime soon . &quot; Crooks are stupid and lazy , &quot; he says . &quot; We catch a lot of them . But there are always more where they came from. &quot;</TEXT>
