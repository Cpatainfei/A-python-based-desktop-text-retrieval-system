   <HEADLINE> TURKISH WARPLANES BLITZ KURDISH REBEL CAMP ; ATTACK : RAID IS BIGGEST IN 10-YEAR-OLD UPRISING . PREMIER VOWS TO BRING GROUP ' S TERRORISM UNDER CONTROL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 50 Turkish F-16 and F-4 warplanes blitzed a Kurdish rebel camp deep inside Iraq on Friday with a barrage of 500-pound to 2 # 000-pound bombs , the Turkish armed forces said . The raid was the biggest in Turkey ' s 10-year-old struggle with the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , a Stalinist group whose aims include an independent state for the 20 million ethnic Kurds in the mountains straddling Turkey , Iran , Iraq and Syria . &quot; We will bring terrorism ( Kurdish separatism ) under_control in 1994 . This is a determined political decision , &quot; declared Prime_Minister Tansu Ciller , who monitored progress of the raid on big screens at Turkish military_headquarters . Armed Forces spokesman Col . Dogu Silahcioglu said he could not estimate casualties because the target_area was covered to a height of 3 # 000 feet by a black pall of smoke from an exploding rebel ammunition dump . The Kurdish rebels insisted that the only dead were four Iraqi Kurds from a nearby village . &quot; We had expected such an attack and had taken precautions , &quot; rebel spokesman Kani Yilmaz said . Iraqi Kurdish spokesman Hoshyar Zibari said two Iranian Kurds , probably smugglers , were killed and two other civilians injured . At least nine badly wounded PKK guerrillas were taken_to a hospital in a town several hours away by foot from the camp , he added . Yilmaz alleged that Ankara had ordered the raid to cover_up a crisis atmosphere in Turkey , where the national currency has fallen more_than 20 % and stock prices by more_than half since Jan . 1 . &quot; Such an attack is a demonstration of the dead_end that the Turkish Republic is in , &quot; he said . The target camp , at Zaleh , lies 70 miles south of Turkey in an old smugglers ' valley tucked between mountains on the Iraqi-Iranian border . The guerrillas have used Zaleh as a main training and logistics base since American and Turkish pressure on Syria forced the closure of their big camp in Lebanon ' s Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley . Briefing reporters , Turkish spokesmen showed a mock-up of the camp marking almost every tree and flimsy tent in the Zaleh base . The rocky , scrub-covered region is loosely under the rule of Iraqi Kurdish guerrillas , who are close to Turkey ; they oppose Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the Marxist ideology of the Turkish Kurdish rebels . Turkish officers did not deny that one target of the raid was the camp commander , Osman Ocalan , the brother of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan . To hit the Zaleh camp , Turkish warplanes had to cross a &quot; no-fly &quot; zone patrolled by U.S. and allied warplanes to protect the Kurds of northern Iraq from Hussein . Turkey may also have counted_on a recent improvement in relations with Tehran to conduct operations virtually on the Iranian border . While NATO-member Turkey has garnered growing Western support in its fight against the PKK -- which has not hesitated to use terrorist killings to show its power -- some Western governments are frustrated at human_rights violations by the Turkish security_forces and Ankara ' s refusal to enact reforms allowing freedom of expression . For its part , Turkey feels its very existence is threatened . Armed forces generals said they were ready to renew the blitz , triggering speculation that the army may now be embarking_on another of its regular offensives to wipe_out the PKK . Preparations for an exceptional crackdown this year have included lengthening national service for conscripts among at least 150 # 000 troops serving in the southeast . The number of guerrillas facing the security_forces has also risen steadily over the years and was recently estimated at about 10 # 000 by the Turkish government . Nearly 4 # 000 people were killed in 1993 , a record in the 10 years of conflict that have killed a total of 10 # 600 people .</TEXT>
