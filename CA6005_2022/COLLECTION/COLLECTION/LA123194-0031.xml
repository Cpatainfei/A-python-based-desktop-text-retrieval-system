   <TEXT> Contrary to the opinions expressed by Dr. Henry I . Miller in Commentary ( Dec . 12 ) , science , the law and sound public-health policy considerations continue to determine the decisions made by the Food and Drug Administration . And , in fact , those were the reasons for the approval of the female condom.At the time of approval , the agency clearly stated its scientific analysis and underlined the limitations of the female condom for preventing pregnancy and protecting against sexually transmitted diseases . The agency also stated that , in an era of AIDS , it was important to provide women with the means to protect themselves without depending_on the cooperation of their partners . Simply stated , the decision was based on science , the law and public-health concerns ; and that is also the case in biotechnology where the agency continues to follow the policy announced in May , 1992 . A thorough scientific review of the approval for ( the milk-stimulating drug , bovine somatotropin ) rBST was appropriate , especially in light of the concerns voiced in many quarters . This review has enabled the agency to defend strongly and appropriately its decision . If Miller wants to venture from the realm of opinion into the world of facts , he needs to do his homework . JAMES A . O ' HARA III Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs Department of Health &amp; Human Services Rockville , Md .</TEXT>
