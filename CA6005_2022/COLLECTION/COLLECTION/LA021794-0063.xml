   <TEXT> More_than 200 students at San Gabriel High_School in Alhambra gave_up their scheduled day_off Friday to learn more about combatting HIV , the virus that causes AIDS . They were inspired by English_teacher Joe Cornish ' s public announcement that he has AIDS and the AIDS-related death of a school counselor ' s best_friend . Sponsored by Pasadena ' s AIDS Service Center , the program on HIV and AIDS awareness included lectures and instruction in safe_sex , including the proper use of condoms by rolling them onto bananas . Students who took_part in the session will visit classrooms to discuss safe_sex during the school ' s AIDS Awareness Week from March 7-11 , said Susan Cohen , coordinator of education and training at the service center . The daylong program concluded in the school ' s auditorium , where two HIV-positive women , Sarah Hart , 29 , and Viviana Martinez , 21 -- along with Hart ' s AIDS-diagnosed daughter Jessica , 10 -- discussed how they cope_with the deadly virus . &quot; It ' s sad because even after all these years , people really are not listening , &quot; said Hart , who told the students she probably was infected with HIV in 1982 when she was 17 but was not officially diagnosed until Jessica fell ill with pneumonia three years ago . &quot; ( People ) don ' t realize that there are choices they can make in their lives that can save them from AIDS , &quot; she said . Jessica quieted the audience when she talked_about how her elementary-school friends reacted when she told them she had AIDS . &quot; I used to have a whole handful of good friends , &quot; she said in a tiny voice that was barely picked_up by the microphone . &quot; But then , when I told them ( about having AIDS ) , I found_out that I didn ' t have such good friends after all. &quot; Students said the program had shaken_off their &quot; It won ' t happen to me &quot; attitudes . &quot; The thing that makes an impact is when people with AIDS come and talk_about it , &quot; said junior Carly Sheffer , 16 . She added that Cornish , the teacher who helped make AIDS awareness an issue at the school , could not make the program because of illness .</TEXT>
