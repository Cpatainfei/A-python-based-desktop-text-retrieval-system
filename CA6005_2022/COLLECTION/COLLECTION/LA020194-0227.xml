   <HEADLINE> TEMPORARY HALT IS CALLED_ON THE MERGERS OF MUTUAL S &amp; LS ; THRIFTS : THE MORATORIUM IS CALLED A GOOD FIRST_STEP TO PROTECT DEPOSITORS WHEN THE INSTITUTIONS ARE ACQUIRED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a crackdown on windfall_profits for some insiders , federal regulators imposed a moratorium Monday on mergers in which the stock of a depositor-owned savings and loan institutions is sold to the public . The action by the Office of Thrift Supervision was welcomed by Rep . Henry B . Gonzalez , chairman of the House Banking Committee . The Texas Democrat said it is a good first_step to protect depositors when so-called mutual S &amp; Ls are acquired by other companies . In calling a temporary halt to the merger activity , the OTS said it also intends to review standard conversions in which mutual S &amp; Ls decide on_their_own to offer stock to the public . The agency said it will continue to process applications for standard conversions during the review . &quot; I applaud the OTS for its decision today to impose a moratorium on merger conversions , which are the most egregious type of conversion because the depositors . . . are not always able to purchase the savings bank stock , whereas the bank insiders always go_home with their pockets lined , &quot; Gonzalez said . He urged the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . to impose a similar temporary ban on merger conversions for mutual S &amp; Ls . The FDIC and OTS share responsibility for regulating the savings industry . At a House banking subcommittee hearing last week , several lawmakers expressed concern that some insiders are getting rich_in the deals . Acting FDIC Chairman Andrew Hove promised the panel it will examine the conversions more closely . He said the agency is considering requiring special vouchers be issued to depositors when mutual savings institutions sell stock . The vouchers would let the holders buy stock , or they could be sold by depositors who so choose . Acting OTS director Jonathan Fiechter said the moratorium will remain in_effect until the agency drafts rules to protect depositors . Mutual S &amp; Ls have $ 250 billion in assets , about a fourth of the nation ' s savings and loan industry . Last year , 112 mutual S &amp; Ls converted to publicly owned stock -- including 29 that were bought by banks , industry groups reported . OTS said managers of mutual thrift_institutions often get lavish stock_options and retirement pay when the S &amp; Ls merge . It also said , acquiring banks can reap big profits by purchasing the mutual at a steep discount from its market_value .</TEXT>
