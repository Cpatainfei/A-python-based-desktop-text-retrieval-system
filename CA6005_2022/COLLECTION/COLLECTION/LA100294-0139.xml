   <HEADLINE> CHANGING JAPANESE POLITICS , NOT TRADE , IS GREATEST THREAT TO U.S.-JAPAN RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Whatever the eventual outcome of the &quot; framework talks &quot; on trade between Japan and the United States , agreement or sanctions , it will have little effect on the political fortunes of Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama ' s ruling coalition or on the short-term course of Japanese politics . In the long term , however , relations could be damaged by underlying political trends in Japan reinforced by the way the Clinton_Administration has handled the talks . The name of the game in Japan today is not policy but political power and survival . Few things illustrate this more_than the union of the leftist Socialist_Party with its longtime nemesis , the conservative Liberal Democratic Party , to form a surprisingly solid government . The continuing efforts of the other major parties to merge into a &quot; New New Party &quot; reflects the opposition ' s need to offset the coalition ' s formidable political strength . While there are differences both between and within the various political groupings on issues like taxes and policy toward Korea , they , on the whole , have not been drivers of political affiliation . Certainly , trade_policy is not a defining issue . The turnaround by the Socialists on virtually every major political issue has undercut the opposition ' s ability to mount an effective challenge . Even if policy differences were a more formative factor_in party affiliation , the Socialists have defused the disagreements by renouncing their previous positions and embracing the goals of former &quot; reformist &quot; governments . Whether on trade , nuclear_power or national-security , the Socialist-led government is nearly indistinguishable from its predecessors . This has made_it difficult for opposition parties to criticize it , since they would , in_effect , be criticizing themselves . It also has contributed to a sharp rise in support for the coalition . The Japanese public , furthermore , is tired_of U.S. hectoring on trade issues and its threats to &quot; retaliate &quot; against Japan with economic sanctions . Far from constituting pressure for change in Japanese trade_policies , the public mood in Japan today is a mixture of confidence and resignation : confidence that Japan can survive any punitive measures the United States might impose , and resignation that a standoff may be unavoidable if Japan is ever going_to end U.S. pressure . This mood means that the coalition government will neither benefit much from a negotiated agreement nor suffer greatly from a breakdown in talks . It also means the government will be under no significant pressure to lash_out against potentially harsh U.S. measures . The good news buried in these political trends is that we are not likely to see a rupture in the broader U.S.-Japan relationship -- at least not one that is precipitated by Japan . Japanese political_leaders have their hands full coping_with their domestic situation . The sharply polarized Japanese politics of recent times has given_way to one characterized by a large , new &quot; middle &quot; ground that , while subsuming important policy differences , shares fundamental values and national objectives . Most significant , as reflected in the transformation of the Socialist_Party , a broad consensus now exists in Japan on the importance of the United States to Japanese national interests . The bad news is that the ground is shifting . For one thing , the framework negotiations have seriously eroded mutual trust and respect . The Clinton_Administration ' s insistence on &quot; objective criteria , &quot; by which to measure Japanese faithfulness in honoring their commitments , has been particularly corrosive . This has fostered greater agreement among Japanese leaders that , while ties with the United States remain critical , Japan must do more to develop other dimensions of its foreign_policy . The pronounced emphasis on Asia in recent Japanese diplomacy is one early product of this shift in thinking . Equally worrisome is the development of a new political equation in Japan . In the past , the priority was to accommodate U.S. wishes . Today , a willingness to stand_up to Washington is becoming the measure of political leadership . This change could literally blow the U.S.-Japan relationship apart if a really serious issue -- like responding to North_Korea ' s continuing nuclear program -- became the vehicle for demonstrating Japan ' s toughness . Already , Japanese financial_support for U.S. military bases in Japan has become a political football . The most immediate danger , however , comes not from any specific act by one or the other country . Rather , it comes from the growing indifference of each to the other as a result of the domestic preoccupations of the two countries ' leaderships . In a sense , each side is becoming impervious to the other . Left unchecked , the result will almost surely be increasing distance -- not so_much a &quot; pulling &quot; as a &quot; drifting &quot; apart that undermines a sense of common interests .</TEXT>
