   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : FULLERTON ; MERGER AT CAL STATE UNDER NEW STUDY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cal State Fullerton ' s criminal justice and political_science departments , which merged two years ago , are re-evaluating the union . Some professors , alumni and students want the criminal justice_department , which has been growing in popularity for years , to be independent again . Despite two votes by faculty_members last year to keep the departments together , a committee has been formed to re-examine the merger , said Sandra Sutphen , chairwoman of the joint division . She said it is possible the committee will recommend dissolving the union . Sutphen said , however , she thinks that would be unlikely . Other recommendations that could be considered include keeping the departments together or consolidating them so the criminal justice_department would no longer be offered as a major . Jim Lasley , a professor in the criminal justice_department , said students who want to concentrate their studies on criminal justice will suffer if the department disappears . He says the political_science department is trying to force criminal justice students to take political_science courses because the department has had problems attracting students to the major . The political_science department &quot; is trying to stay alive , &quot; Lasley said . Last semester , there were 608 criminal justice majors and 397 political_science majors , according to Donald Castro , dean of the School of Humanities and Social_Sciences . Marc Mitzner , an Alumni Assn . member and former Associated Students president , graduated from Cal State Fullerton with a bachelor ' s degree in criminal justice before the division was created . He said he chose the university and its criminal justice program because of its reputation for producing top graduates , many of whom have become police_chiefs , politicians , attorneys and high-ranking officers in the criminal justice field . &quot; Once the merger is a done deal , criminal justice virtually disappears , &quot; Mitzner said . &quot; It will fall_under political_science , and students will no longer be able to major in criminal justice . . . . The professors are having debates over that , expressing a moral dilemma . If the professors aren ' t happy , then that will affect the education of the students. &quot; Sutphen said the departments were combined administratively only on a trial basis in an effort to save money but that students can still major in either criminal justice or political_science . Castro said he does not believe a problem exists . He said it is highly unlikely that the newly formed committee will recommend separating the two departments or dropping the criminal justice major . &quot; To spread the rumor that this is a move to make criminal justice disappear is so way off the mark that it ' s ridiculous , &quot; Castro said . W . Garrett Capune , a criminal justice professor , said he believes the committee will fairly evaluate the merger and try to find ways to improve it . MIMI KO</TEXT>
