   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : SOUTHEAST : LIBRARY HELPS YOUTH SIGN ON TO INTERNET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Senior Reference Librarian Marie Kaneko is determined to make_sure the much-heralded information superhighway doesn ' t leave some travelers in the dust . &quot; It ' s the information-poor who will be left_behind in the future , &quot; said Kaneko , who heads the city ' s Central Library . &quot; that ' s why it ' s good to get kids hooked on the Internet at an early age. &quot; In Commerce , a city that is 91 % Latino , that means increasing awareness about the potential for multicultural and multilingual access to the burgeoning global computer_network . With that goal in mind , the library ' s Bristow Park branch hosted a free information session last week to discuss Spanish-language resources on the Internet . Expanding bilingual access to the Internet is the result , in part , of a project funded earlier this year by the Federal Library Services and Construction Act . The project provides 182 participating libraries with equipment , training and 100 hours of Internet connect time . In each library , a lead staff_member and community resident are responsible_for experimenting with a variety of public uses of the Internet , training others and sharing their experiences with each other and other libraries . Using a modem , printer and a personal_computer , interested parties at a recent information session learned how to tap into a database with information on topics ranging from Mayan archeological digs to Mexican American soirees in Torrance to the latest news on the rebellion in Chiapas , Mexico . Bert Gallego , a social studies teacher with Montebello Unified Schools who attended the session , said he has come_across such contrasting information as gossip between people living_on different continents and a brilliant essay on recent political events . &quot; There aren ' t any standards yet , so you just don ' t know what you ' re going to get when you access a given database , &quot; Gallego said . Still , Gallego said , it is essential for as_many people as possible to get access to the flood of information available on the Internet and other computer_networks . &quot; At this point the Internet is just anarchy , &quot; Gallego said . &quot; There ' s a race right now to acquire equal access to information , and it ' s clear who ' s winning -- those with enough money to have computers in their homes. &quot; SIMON ROMERO</TEXT>
