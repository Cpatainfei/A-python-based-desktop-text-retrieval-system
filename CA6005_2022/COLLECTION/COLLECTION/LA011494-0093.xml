   <HEADLINE> WITH CHIAPAS CEASE-FIRE , POLITICAL FALLOUT BEGINS ; MEXICO : THE SAME SEMI-FEUDAL POWER_STRUCTURE THAT SHUT OUT REBELLIOUS INDIANS HAS LONG DELIVERED THE VOTE FOR PRI .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fighting appeared to have halted in southern Mexico on Thursday , but the political fallout from 12 days of guerrilla warfare has barely begun . The uprising that cost more_than 100 lives , observers say , is an indictment of a semi-feudal system that has left many Indians feeling powerless , with no way to resolve their problems by peaceful means . Yet that same system is what guarantees that Chiapas , the state bordering Guatemala , turns_out a solid majority for the ruling party election after election . With a presidential vote upcoming in August , analysts said , politicians may be reluctant to dismantle the power_structure in a state that has become known as a strategic reserve of votes for the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI . But they seemingly have little choice . &quot; Chiapas may be a mother lode of votes for the PRI , but it could also be its tomb , &quot; warned Cecilia Romero , assistant secretary_general of the National Action Party , the major right-wing opposition party . Even as the government appeared to be moving toward peace with the rebels by meeting two of their demands for negotiations -- calling a unilateral cease-fire Wednesday and recognizing them Thursday as a &quot; political and military_force &quot; -- the consequences of the uprising were becoming more clear . Besides crowding the presidential campaign off the front page , the rebels have changed the focus of the debate , pushing issues of poverty and unequal distribution of wealth into the foreground . Further , the violence in Chiapas has pointed_out the pitfalls of what critics of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari call Salinas - troika : perestroika ( restructuring ) without glasnost ( political openness or reform ) . Salinas ' fast-track , free-market economic reforms contrast sharply with the lack of change in a political patronage system that has kept his party in power for six decades . Salinas supporters have argued that economic change had to precede political shifts to avoid the risk of social upheaval . The appearance of the Zapatista National Liberation Army in Chiapas , combined with the immediate support the group received from urban_guerrillas setting_off bombs in the capital and other cities , makes that reasoning seem dubious now , analysts said . Freedom and democracy lead the list of the rebels ' demands . Chiapas ' Indians are governed by traditional leaders -- caciques ( political_bosses ) who are closely tied to the PRI . Those who live outside their ancestral villages generally work for large cattle_ranches whose owners also have close PRI alliances . In the 1991 midterm congressional elections , more_than three-fourths of Chiapas voters cast ballots for the ruling party , according to the Federal Electoral Institute . That compares with 60 % nationwide . In four remote communities , the PRI won 100 % of the votes . * Those high percentages raise suspicions of fraud . Andrea Dabrowski -- of the campaign of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , an opposition party presidential candidate -- observed that , &quot; Almost everyone has pointed to the political closure , not allowing a legal means of expression , as being at the root of the violence. &quot; Those lessons have resulted in a major victory for the progressive wing of the PRI , evident in the appointment of human_rights advocate Jorge Carpizo MacGregor as Mexican interior minister , said Roderic Camp , a political_scientist at Tulane University . Carpizo , who replaces an old-style PRI politician , will be responsible not only for domestic policy in the current crisis but also for organizing and certifying the legitimacy of the August presidential elections . &quot; His personal integrity is such_that he would not be willing to certify an election that was broadly fraudulent , &quot; said Camp . That increases the pressure on PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio to win cleanly at_the_same_time the focus of the campaign is shifting to issues , such_as social concerns , that may_not favor his party or him personally . As social development minister , Colosio was in_charge of the Solidarity anti-poverty program , which was supposed to solve the desperate problems of starvation and illness that the Zapatistas say are at the heart of their rebellion . Adding_to the embarrassment , Salinas has called_on skilled negotiator Manuel Camacho Solis to reach an agreement with the rebels . Many Mexicans felt that the popular former Mexico_City mayor should have been his party ' s presidential pick . &quot; Colosio looks less and less like a good candidate , &quot; said Castaneda . At the same time , the violence has made left-leaning Cardenas look less radical . &quot; People are starting to ask , what ' s worse , &quot; said Castaneda , &quot; Cardenas or the guerrillas blowing_up the whole place ? &quot;</TEXT>
