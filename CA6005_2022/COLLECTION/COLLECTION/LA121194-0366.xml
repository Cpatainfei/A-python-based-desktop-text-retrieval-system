   <HEADLINE> HOUSE HUNTS BY COMPUTER SAVING TIME AND TEDIUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I want this one ! &quot; Three-year-old Evan Donnelly is pointing to the color photograph of a tile-roofed house on his parents ' computer_screen . &quot; No , this house is too small , I can tell , &quot; said Mary Donnelly , sitting with her son in their Yorba Linda bedroom . &quot; Go_to the next one , &quot; she tells her husband , Brian . With a click of the mouse , the computer brings_up another listed property that matches the family ' s preferences . The routine is a familiar one for the Donnellys . They ' ve been spending evenings shopping for their dream house -- without ever leaving home . The Donnellys &quot; visit &quot; properties after work via computer . By using a CD-ROM program , they say , they have found a way to eliminate some of the tedium , frustration and stress of house-hunting . There ' s no need to drive through unfamiliar neighborhoods on weekends . &quot; With two children , looking_for a home can be an exhausting process , &quot; Mary Donnelly said . &quot; This makes_it easy. &quot; The Donnellys aren ' t alone in turning_to computers for house-shopping help . When more_than 17 # 000 real_estate_brokers gathered_in Anaheim last month for their annual national conference , the group focused_on how to give clients more electronically packaged information . Computers anchored almost every booth as the brokers gathered to buzz about the latest high-tech marketing tools . The reason : Most agents have come_to realize that colorful yard signs , open_houses and a smiling realtor are no longer the best ways to sell residential property . Real_estate_agents in the San Fernando Valley and Orange County are among the first in the nation to use on-line systems that tap sophisticated data sources . And , as major real_estate companies rush toward the information superhighway , brokers still using outdated methods could be left rolling behind in the dirt like lost hubcaps . Sales agents are betting that , like the Donnellys , their clients will demand more and better information before they begin shopping for a home . Though some brokers are nervous about giving_up some control , most predict that shoppers one day will work only with brokers who provide the most complete and current information . &quot; The floodgates are about to open , &quot; said Mark Surfas , director of on-line communications at Coldwell Banker Residential Real_Estate in Mission Viejo , one of the nation ' s largest real_estate brokerages . &quot; We ' re blending a lot of different technologies together and turning this into a real_estate information Disneyland. &quot; These days , shoppers can select their next dwelling at computer kiosks in seven California malls . A kiosk is slated to be installed in the Glendale Galleria and five other malls next year . Computers have replaced model homes_in Aliso Viejo . Prospective buyers instead look_at computerized images of home designs developed by two Orange County companies . And , for the ultimate home-buying experience , consumers may one day use virtual_reality centers -- with computer-generated , three-dimensional house designs -- to &quot; walk through &quot; rooms in houses or even entire neighborhoods without ever going outdoors . While on-line networks are not yet available in most of Southern California , the San Fernando Valley Assn . of Realtors has unveiled a system that lets buyers use a computer_network to choose a dwelling to buy , electronically fill_out escrow and title forms and get preliminary approval of a mortgage loan in a single visit . &quot; They are the only board in the country doing this . . . , &quot; said Almon R . Smith , executive_vice_president of National Assn . of Realtors , which is developing a nationwide system based on the Valley model . &quot; It is sweeping the entire industry . When you get_down to it , real_estate -- more_than anything else -- is about the flow of information . Everyone ' s trying to figure_out how to link things together. &quot; With 7 # 500 members , the San Fernando board is the nation ' s third largest real_estate board and the largest in California . It is the first to offer its members a network that stores up_to 10 color photographs of each listing with full descriptions of each house , recent improvements and information on schools in the area . The Pacific Bell-designed system can also screen and select listings to fit a buyer ' s specifications and print out maps showing the location of each address . At a Century 21 office just up the street from the Meadows apartment complex in Northridge , where 16 tenants died in the Jan . 17 earthquake , Lisa and Bill Smith are shopping for their &quot; first real home. &quot; The couple ' s condo was damaged in the earthquake , but neither is willing to give_up on the Northridge area . Both admitted , though , that neighborhoods littered with earthquake-damaged houses add a special challenge to home buying . &quot; You can see right here , the chimney is gone , &quot; said their realty agent , Marc D . Schwartz , pointing to one house shown on the screen . Schwartz plugs into the computer the Smiths ' specifications -- three bedrooms , maximum price of $ 160 # 000 , favorite neighborhoods -- and pulls_up 75 properties . The Smiths quickly scan the photos on the screen and discard the undesirables , especially those with serious earthquake damage . &quot; She wants a big house , and I want a big garage , &quot; said Bill Smith , 30 , who owns a window cleaning company . &quot; This saves us so_much time because we discuss it right here. &quot; At the Mission Viejo Mall , a computer kiosk designed by New Home Search offers photos and floor_plans of listed homes . Using CD-ROM technology , buyers can tour both new and resale properties just by touching a computer_screen . &quot; Looking_for a home is a grueling process , &quot; said John Giamo , head of Visual Listings Inc. in Brea , who joined Jeff Meyers of the Meyers Group , a Newport Beach real_estate data company , to create New Home Search in 1991 . Visual Listings also produces a real_estate CD-ROM packed with up_to 25 # 000 listings . The Donnellys are among a test-marketing group of about 30 clients who receive the disc free at_home each week , and about 100 brokerages subscribe_to the CD-ROM service for $ 35 a disc . The company charges brokers about $ 20 to place a listing for a resale home_in the database ; it charges builders $ 150 to list new houses . Critics of the service say the cost of manufacturing a CD-ROM is prohibitive ( the company says a disc costs about $ 6 now , and could get cheaper ) . They point_out that listings can expire quickly . Giamo admits that the program is still developing , but said computer users will be able to get the listings on the Internet by spring . Giamo said the system developed in the San Fernando Valley is tailored to brokers ' needs , not those of consumers . His system , he said , is designed specifically for buyers . And that , he says , makes Orange County realtors a little nervous . &quot; It ' s been a very frustrating situation with Orange County brokers ; they have not embraced the technology , but consumers love it , &quot; Giamo said . Chuck Smith , executive_vice_president of the East Orange County Assn . of Realtors -- which has 2 # 100 members in Santa Ana , Orange , Anaheim Hills and Tustin -- acknowledged a certain resistance to change . But his group ' s agents can now put listings on the Prodigy on-line service , and he said he believes that eventually , all brokers will be_on line . &quot; We have been looking_at similar things to what San Fernando Valley has done . We find our members are very receptive to some of the high-tech innovations , &quot; Smith said . &quot; But there is always some resistance to anything new. &quot; The Internet , a global connection of computer_networks and databases , will help provide a more intimate setting in which to shop for a house . Offers and listings are already appearing on the World Wide Web , a subdivision of the Internet where members can advertise . The system allows_for text to be combined with sound and even video , providing an opportunity to show many features of a home . Coldwell Banker Residential Real_Estate and Century 21 Real_Estate Corp . -- are spending millions of dollars to get their hundreds of thousands of brokers wired with the latest high-tech sales gadgets . Coldwell Banker is expanding its fledgling Scoop software program so that by early next year , consumers can walk into a Coldwell Banker office to look_at pictures of homes , check_out schools and shop for a mortgage loan on the computer . Prudential Real_Estate Affiliates of Costa Mesa is building a $ 1-million center_on the East Coast with interactive television to view homes -- virtual_reality centers where potential buyers will &quot; walk &quot; through dozens of homes without leaving the office . The only thing missing is the sales agent . &quot; There will be no salespeople there -- but you can find_out about everything : homes for_sale , mortgages and escrows , &quot; Prudential spokesman Ron Tepper said . &quot; The real_estate transaction is the most barbaric thing there is . We want to change that and give consumers what they want. &quot; Not all brokers embrace the idea of multimedia house-hunting . Realtors , through their local boards , are used to controlling the information on listed properties and don ' t like the idea of direct customer access . &quot; This is still a lot of electronic sizzle , &quot; said Dick Rafferty , a broker with Electronic Realty Associates in Fountain Valley . &quot; People don ' t buy homes off the computer . They have to go look_at it. &quot; And many realtors said that although the computers can supply customers with the most up-to-date information , many buyers will still need a professional real_estate_broker to guide them through purchasing the house of their choice .</TEXT>
