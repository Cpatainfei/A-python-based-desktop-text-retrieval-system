   <HEADLINE> A NEW BEGINNING ; MISSING WOMAN ' S PARENTS LEAVING NEWPORT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It has been three years to the day since her daughter , Denise , disappeared without a trace in the middle of the night , but Ione Huber feels the pain of not knowing what happened to her as if it were yesterday . At least now , however , there is something in her future other_than anguish-filled days and nights waiting for the phone to ring with news about her only daughter . In July , Ione Huber and her husband , Dennis , will move_back to their native North_Dakota . &quot; We need a new beginning , &quot; Ione Huber said Thursday . &quot; We ' re going back to where we grew_up , and that is going_to be better for us. &quot; Twenty-seven years ago , the Hubers rolled_out of neighboring South_Dakota -- where they had moved after marrying -- on a journey that would take them to Modesto , where Denise was born , to Sacramento , to Northridge , to Richardson , Tex. , and back to California -- this time to Newport Beach , where they established a home seven years ago . The couple leave distraught that three years have passed and they still have no word on their daughter ' s fate , angry that someone they believe has information that could give them peace is withholding it . &quot; Who ' s responsible_for not letting us know what has happened ? that ' s what embitters you , &quot; Ione Huber , 51 , said . &quot; The torture of not knowing -- that embitters you . What did they do with her body ? Where is she so that we can put ( an end ) to all_of this ? &quot; It ' s hard to deal with it . Those are the things I wish we could find_out . It would make the move a lot easier. &quot; Ione Huber is sure , however , that if her daughter were alive , she would have found a way to communicate with them . &quot; She was too caring a person . . . to put us through that , &quot; Ione Huber said . Early on June 3 , 1991 , Denise Anette Huber , then 23 , dropped_off a friend at his Huntington Beach residence . They had been at a rock_concert at the Forum in Inglewood earlier that night . That was the last time Denise was seen . The next day , police found her 1988 Honda Accord abandoned on a shoulder of the Corona del Mar Freeway , a_few dozen feet south of the Bear Street off-ramp and just 2 1 / 2 miles from home . The car had a flat_tire . But police were never able to determine exactly what happened at the scene , and Huber ' s body has never been found . Tracking dogs followed her scent for a while but lost_it abruptly , causing investigators to believe she might have entered another vehicle . * An intense search by police , family , friends and scores of volunteers followed . Thousands of flyers and bumper stickers seeking information on Denise Huber ' s whereabouts were distributed throughout Orange County . Billboards and banners asked_for help . A huge sign with the missing girl ' s likeness was posted near the spot where her car was found . Relatives and friends raised a $ 10 # 000 reward , and the television_shows &quot; America ' s Most Wanted &quot; and &quot; Inside Edition &quot; publicized the case nationwide . The family hired a private_detective and psychics . Police checked every lead -- including human bones unearthed in February , 1992 , near Interstate 10 in Indio . All to no avail . But Costa Mesa police continued the investigation . Sgt . Tom Boylan , who was assigned to the case five months ago , said recent news_reports on the sensational disappearance are bringing fresh leads in an otherwise extremely tough case . The case &quot; is fairly unusual ( because ) in almost three years there ' s been no substantial leads and she hasn ' t turned_up , &quot; Boylan said . &quot; That doesn ' t happen every day. &quot; Ione Huber , who since the disappearance has successfully battled breast_cancer , says she recently found the strength to begin cleaning_out Denise ' s room . She has begun giving_away her daughter ' s clothes and is keeping souvenirs and mementos -- &quot; things that were important to her. &quot; She has also kept possessions that are important to her as a mother : &quot; Things from preschool , elementary ( school ) and high_school , things that were kind of special -- Mom ' s Day cards and drawings &quot; among them , she said . The Hubers will move at the end of July to Mandan , N.D. -- a small_town near Bismarck -- to a home that abuts the Mississippi_River . Dennis Huber , 55 , a mortgage banker here , plans to sell computer software that can be used in that industry . Ione Huber , who has worked as a substitute teacher in this area , said she plans to sell real_estate . Ione Huber said she wants her son Jeff , 24 , and his family -- including his 21-month-old daughter Ashley Denise -- to move to Mandan sometime in the future because , she believes , Southern California is getting too dangerous . &quot; Every day you read about crime . It just seems like it ' s getting_worse , &quot; she said . That is why , she said , &quot; we ' re getting_back to where we grew_up and that is going_to be better for us. &quot; But Denise will forever be there , a part of them , she said . &quot; Denise will always be part of our lives , part of our memories , &quot; she said . &quot; She will always be with us. &quot;</TEXT>
