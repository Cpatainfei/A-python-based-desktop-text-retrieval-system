   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN GENERAL , IN CORRUPTION TRIAL , SAYS HE OBEYED ORDERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In what the defendant complained was a show_trial meant to squelch claims of unchecked corruption in the Russian military , a prominent air_force general came_before the Supreme Court on Tuesday facing charges of embezzlement and bribery . Maj . Gen . Nikolai Seliverstov , 49 , was the highest-ranking officer yet brought_to trial for alleged involvement in the shady dealings that were reportedly widespread among the Western Group of Forces that served in Germany . The Russian troops completed their withdrawal in August . Although the investigation began in 1992 , Seliverstov ' s trial came at a time when the Russian military particularly needed to demonstrate that it can police its own . &quot; I have been picked as a scapegoat , &quot; Seliverstov declared to reporters during a break_in the proceedings . &quot; I categorically reject all_the false charges and allegations against me. &quot; A Russian reporter , Dmitry Kholodov , who specialized in digging_up dirt on the troops in Germany , was killed last month by an exploding briefcase . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , saying he needed to preserve the honor of the army , later dumped the former commander of the Western Group of Forces from his new post as deputy defense minister . Public attacks on the Russian military climaxed in Parliament on Friday , when beleaguered Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev was forced to answer lawmakers ' pointed questions for hours . Fortunately for Grachev , Parliament does not have the constitutional power to remove him . Seliverstov , speaking_to reporters , worried that &quot; the timing of this case is not beneficial to me , &quot; coming so soon after Kholodov ' s death . Prosecutors said Tuesday that they had arrested a suspect in the case , but it has yet to be declared solved . Seliverstov ' s trial could , however , benefit the army . Beginning his defense on Tuesday , Seliverstov offered an unusually sympathetic glimpse of the under-the-table life among the cash-strapped Russian officers in Germany . He told the court that , in 1991 , the Defense Ministry issued a directive saying that &quot; we had to earn money to support ourselves -- not defend the motherland as a priority . . . . If there had been no such order , there would have been no money made , and hence , there would be no court proceedings against me today. &quot; In 1991 and 1992 , Seliverstov said , he helped pull_in $ 1 million through air exhibitions , the sale of equipment and transportation services . To help make ends meet , Seliverstov agreed to arrange several cargo flights of humanitarian aid to Kazakhstan for some German priests . The indictment said he allegedly took not only tens of thousands of dollars for the flights but $ 13 # 000 in bribes for himself . The relatively measly sum fueled Seliverstov ' s complaints that he had been singled_out for punishment . &quot; Aren ' t there any instances of corruption in places other_than ( the Western Group of Forces ? ) &quot; he demanded . &quot; And on a far greater scale , too ! . . . To lay the emphasis on the fact that this is the biggest ( case of corruption ) is simply dishonest. &quot; No one would dispute that Seliverstov ' s alleged take was small , especially considering that he now faces_up to 15 years in prison . The problem is that despite German descriptions of Russian under-the-table dealings and even an investigation by Russia ' s former top corruption fighter , little else has been pinned_down . Military prosecutors say that only nine Western Group soldiers have been convicted for theft and corruption since 1992 , among them two colonels , a captain and a major . But the Russian press , especially since Kholodov ' s death , has carried allegations of army supplies sold illegally to dealers , stolen weapons making their way to world markets and military money slipping into secret personal accounts abroad .
