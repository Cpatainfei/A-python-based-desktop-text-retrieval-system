   <HEADLINE> 1994 -- A YEAR OF HOT SPOTS AND FRAGMENTING COUNTRIES ; NATIONS : IS THE CYCLE OF THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY AROUND THE GLOBE JUST ABOUT OVER ? CAN THESE NEW GOVERNMENTS FULFILL THEIR CITIZENS ' EXPECTATIONS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fasten your seat_belts , folks , because 1994 is here . In contrast to the often euphoric five years since the onset of global change , 1994 could well be the bloodiest and most frustrating period of the post-Cold War world . It will have redeeming moments -- particularly as the Middle_East and South_Africa implement peace pacts this spring . Indeed , from history ' s perspective , the mid-1990s are likely to be regarded_as critical in shaping a new epoch . Yet from the short-term perspective of those living through it , 1994 will often feel hellacious , as a host of flash_points from central_Africa to Central Asia implode , as the scramble for the deadliest weapons accelerates and as even states experiencing positive change go_through rough , sorting-out periods . The year will have its share of sexy headline grabbers . Washington is already speculating , for example , about whether North_Korea ' s nuclear potential will be for Bill_Clinton what Cuba ' s missile crisis was to John F . Kennedy -- though Pyongyang has more to gain from mediation , including aid , than confrontation . Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping will defy the odds if he survives the year . His passing offers a pretext for change , or new demands for it , in the world ' s last empire -- even though China ' s course , post-Deng , appears charted . Several 1993 holdovers offer hopeful prospects -- even if based more on wishful_thinking than reality . New scuttlebutt suggests Iraq ' s Saddam Hussein survived a roadside bombing during a trip last fall known only to his inner_circle . And , of course , the year will have its &quot; surprises &quot; -- though many are already predictable . In Algeria , Muslim resistance since the 1992 military coup is becoming the kind of landmark for the broader Islamic movement that the legendary battle of Algiers was to Third_World independence three decades ago . And upheaval seems unavoidable in Zaire , the massive country in the belly of Africa where the currency has fallen against the dollar -- from 300 to $ 1 , in 1990 , to more_than 100 million to $ 1 last month . Human-rights abuses are reportedly the worst since the 1960s civil_war . But rather than specific hot spots , 1994 ' s place in history is likely to be judged by overall progress on democracy -- a trend now in serious trouble . &quot; The cycle ' s about run_out , &quot; Joe Ryan of Freedom House , a human-rights monitoring group , reflected on the eve of 1994 . From the Andes to the Atlas mountains , from Siberia ' s frozen tundra to India ' s steamy slums , the basic problem is that democracy is failing to penetrate deep enough into either state apparatus or societies to survive myriad challenges . Threats will play_out on several fronts . The first is in elections , where the results of change are likely to be increasingly uneven -- often bringing_to power either the undesirable or the unexpected , and altering the agenda . The rise of ultra-nationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky in Russia ' s parliamentary elections last month , for example , ensures that states on the periphery -- from Latvia in the Baltics to Kazakhstan in Central Asia -- will increasingly be flash_points in 1994 . Zhirinovsky has threatened trade restrictions and even military intervention in response to real or alleged problems of Russian minorities in former Soviet republics -- an issue Boris N . Yeltsin will have to address to preempt his powerful rival . Yet , not surprisingly , the new states are installing their own officials and agendas , unsettling local Russians . On the other end of the spectrum is Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , known as Lula , a socialist planning to run_for president of Brazil in 1994 -- and favored 2 to 1 over his nearest rival in recent polls . As in many new democracies , Brazilians ' faith in pluralism is being tested by painful economic reforms , crime and corruption . In Latin_America , only Chile has successfully mixed market economics with social_policies to reduce poverty . Brazil ' s annual inflation last year hit 2 # 500 % , as free markets helped widen the already enormous gap between rich and poor . A corruption scandal forced Brazil ' s democratically elected president to resign in 1992 , while , in 1993 , congress launched investigations into corruption charges against dozens of deputies , governors and former government_ministers . Both Zhirinovsky and Lula are symbols of broader challenges in young democracies unable to meet expectations of newly empowered constituents . Their rise is_due as much to fear as_to personal_appeal . But either way , they are unlikely to be lone examples by the end of 1994 . Second , demands for greater participation will often contribute as much to dismembering states as_to changing them within -- again , in part , because democracy hasn ' t penetrated deeply enough or calmed nationalist insecurities . But disintegration is less likely to be along neat , predetermined borders -- as when the 15 Soviet republics became 15 independent states in 1991 . Redrawing the world map will often be messier , opening_up whole new conflicts -- and perhaps making Bosnia a model for the 1990s as Lebanon was to the 1980s . Problems are not limited to developing countries . Canada ' s Quebec question , for example , may be settled by 1994 elections . If the separatist Parti Quebecois wins , as polls suggest , a vote on secession is expected to follow . The party has already set June 24 , 1995 for independence . that ' s the easy part . Quebec then has to deal with native_Americans -- and whether they , too , gain independence . Since the late ' 80s , a growing native-rights movement has had both peaceful and bloody confrontations with Quebec authorities . Canada has already agreed to create a self-governed Inuit homeland , called Nunavut , in 1999 . Third , countries from North Africa to Southeast_Asia , attempting to forestall greater participation , will also be bigger flash_points in 1994 . Besides Algeria , crises are already looming in states from Egypt to Tajikistan , where Islam appears to be a popular alternative but governments are balking rather than accommodating strong public sentiments . Finally , democracy ' s progress is affected by peace in unusual ways . Precedents in 1993 , between Palestinians and Israelis and between South_Africa ' s blacks_and_whites , bode well this year in other areas of prolonged conflict . Barring unexpected events -- such_as death of a major player or tangential crises -- Israeli pacts with Syria and Jordan are likely in 1994 . Yet peace opens_up as_many issues as it resolves . Ending the Arab-Israeli conflict , for example , eliminates the defining issue for several Arab leaders . Rather than stability , peace may instead usher_in greater short-term instability -- as an opposition sees change is possible and wants more of it . So even in lands of peace and hope , the ride may get rough . But the democracy movement isn ' t being derailed . Too many people now know their rights to allow a long-term reversal . The biggest challenge of the year will thus be helping democracy overcome the obstacles and take permanent hold -- so 1995 will be better .</TEXT>
