   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : ADMAN ' S NIRVANA ; BUS MOVIE STRIKES ' BUDDHA ' CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It took a while , but advertisements for &quot; Little Buddha &quot; are finally up_to &quot; Speed. &quot; When Bernardo Bertolucci ' s film about an American boy who is believed to be the reincarnation of an important Buddhist lama opened in May , distributor Miramax Films created an ad_campaign that tried to capture the mystical nature of the fable . &quot; From the creator of ' The Last Emperor , ' &quot; read the opening-day print ad , &quot; comes a magical journey to a place where the past and the present meet. &quot; Pictured beneath was a blond boy surrounded by robed Buddhist youths . The boy ' s face , bathed in light , looked_back toward the camera . But in case you didn ' t notice , the movie_starred Keanu Reeves . What a difference a_few weeks have made . Since &quot; Little Buddha &quot; debuted , Reeves has become one of Hollywood ' s hottest stars with his role as an LAPD cop trying to defuse a bomb on board a bus in &quot; Speed. &quot; The 20th Century Fox movie has grossed more_than $ 100 million and Reeves has attracted a large female audience . Now Miramax is belatedly trying to cash_in_on Reeves ' star status in its latest round of ads for &quot; Little Buddha. &quot; The new ads show a virile Reeves , shirtless from the waist up , his hair braided and cascading down his shoulders . &quot; Keanu Reeves , the summer ' s most explosive star in the season ' s most dazzling spectacle ! &quot; gush the latest newspaper_ads . Whereas the old ads stressed the spectacle of the movie itself -- &quot; A richly entertaining , visually stunning masterpiece , &quot; read one review quoted in the opening day ad -- the new ones use portions of reviews that focus_on Reeves . &quot; Keanu Reeves ' carefully nuanced turn , alongside his performance in ' Speed , ' shows he is here to stay ! &quot; the ads quote the New York Post . &quot; Bertolucci ' s choice of Keanu Reeves pays_off ! &quot; says Time magazine in another . Miramax officials said they are not trying to mislead the public into believing that &quot; Little Buddha , &quot; a thoughtful period_piece , is either somehow like &quot; Speed &quot; or filled with sexy scenes of Reeves . &quot; We ' re not trying to sex up the ad , &quot; said David Dinerstein , vice_president of marketing . &quot; We ' re trying to utilize Keanu . We feel this film has a lot of different elements to it and Keanu is one of the more important roles. &quot; Dinerstein conceded that Reeves ' success in &quot; Speed &quot; prompted Miramax to alter its print advertising , but he explained that the company often changes ad_campaigns in midstream to keep alive interest in its films . In &quot; The Piano , &quot; for instance , the initial ad_campaign depicted close-ups of Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel , but this was later changed to a shot of Hunter on the beach with a piano . &quot; Our hallmark is the ability to keep films in theaters four to six months , &quot; Dinerstein explained . &quot; Like Water for Chocolate , &quot; he noted , is in its 75th week of release . Miramax expects &quot; Little Buddha &quot; to play into the fall , Dinerstein said . There are financial reasons for keeping the movie going . Miramax reportedly spent $ 7 million to $ 9 million to acquire the North_American rights . The film has grossed less than $ 4.5 million .</TEXT>
