   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN ROCKET FORCES LEFT IN THE DARK -- AND FUMING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia ' s nuclear arsenal survived intact for three decades of Cold_War showdown with the West , but its custodians were reeling Thursday from a humiliating sneak attack on their headquarters . It came not from a weapon of destruction , nor a terrorist , nor a thief in the night . It happened in broad daylight and has been blamed on a fearless but faceless bureaucrat at the Moscow power_company . For at least 74 minutes Wednesday , the utility shut_off electricity to the Strategic Rocket Forces command center for failure to pay its $ 645 # 000 in overdue bills . The command_post -- in an underground bunker , full of communications gear with launch codes and monitoring equipment for 744 intercontinental_ballistic_missiles across the former Soviet_Union -- switched to emergency backup power . A statement from the base said &quot; the military preparedness of the Strategic Rocket Forces was not impaired. &quot; But the country ' s security Establishment erupted with fury Thursday over the bizarre blackout , which Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin called &quot; scandalous. &quot; To many , the incident seemed to show how the economic disorder and breakdown of authority in post-Soviet Russia pose indiscriminate threats to vital national interests . Some officials suggested that it could undermine efforts by Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin at his summit next week with President Clinton to portray Russia as an increasingly stable country worthy of Western trust , aid and investment . &quot; The Americans will have doubts now whether Russia and the Yeltsin administration , in particular , are capable of being responsible_for the conditions under which nuclear arms are stored , &quot; said Alexei G . Arbatov , a disarmament specialist and member_of_Parliament . &quot; The people responsible should be put_on trial and sent to prison. &quot; What happened Wednesday is still a matter of conflicting accounts from the two antagonists : the Russian Defense Ministry -- which hasn ' t paid_for a kilowatt since January -- and Mosenergo , the Moscow utility that claims the complete military owes it a total of 50 billion rubles , or about $ 21.5 million . A government rule prohibits power cutoffs to strategic military_installations . But Mosenergo officials claimed not to understand that they were violating this regulation . They said they simply cut power at 2:30 p.m. to a Defense Ministry &quot; object &quot; known to them only by a code number . &quot; We turned_off a cable to remind the leadership of this object to undertake measures to pay its debt , &quot; said Igor Goryunov , the utility ' s deputy director . Mosenergo officials said power was restored at 3:44 p.m. after a telephone_call from Gen . Igor Sergeyev , commander of the rocket forces base 12 miles west of Moscow . They said the general agreed to meet next week to discuss a debt payment schedule . Sergeyev did not sound agreeable at all . &quot; There are no words in the Russian language , even unprintable ones , to comment on what happened , &quot; he declared . Rocket forces officers said the blackout lasted four hours , and the utility knew exactly what it was doing . They said only the bunker , several hundred feet underground , lost power while officers ' quarters on the base were unaffected . According to Western and Russian specialists , communications_equipment in the bunker can transmit launch codes via land lines , satellite and high-frequency radio to nuclear missiles . The equipment also lets Russian officers monitor missiles for tampering . These systems are periodically checked to test backup emergency systems -- battery power_packs and diesel generators , the specialists said . Even if backups fail , they added , missiles can be monitored and launched from Defense Ministry headquarters on Arbat Street in Moscow . &quot; A blackout by itself would n ' t cause a dire degradation of the rocket forces ' combat capability , &quot; said Bruce Blair , an arms control specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington . &quot; But it might be a symptom of the weakness of Russia ' s central authority. &quot; Top Russian authorities took it as an affront . Even as he assigned his energy minister to investigate the incident , Chernomyrdin sided with the armed forces and said , &quot; Whoever is responsible_for this disgrace will be punished today. &quot; Many in the armed forces are angry at Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin for threatening to withhold part of their $ 20.5-billion budget allocation for 1994 because of lagging tax_revenue -- a move that could cut defense spending to as little as half the 1993 level . Budget-cutting across the board has tamed Russia ' s inflation and created a measure of stability that Yeltsin will tout at next week ' s White_House summit . But it has caused a payments crisis that grows as government_agencies , state-subsidized companies and their clients limp along by building_up huge debts to each other . Wednesday ' s blackout was a nightmarish example of how much clout the debt crisis gives bureaucrats and bill collectors . As the government struggles for an orderly way to save essential or healthy enterprises and nudge unsound ones into bankruptcy , creditors in government_agencies are making their own decisions on whom to cut_off . &quot; It is simply unthinkable , &quot; said Valery F . Davydov , a Russian specialist on nuclear_weapons . &quot; How could a rank-and-file clerk at Mosenergo make a decision affecting the security of 170 million Russian people ? He has demonstrated to the world what our lives are worth -- 50 billion rubles. &quot;</TEXT>
