   <HEADLINE> COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI ; AREN ' T COACHES SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO JUDGE TALENT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What ' s thicker : Joe Paterno ' s glasses or the skull of the bozo coach who voted Penn State No . 6 in the latest USA Today / CNN poll ? This must have been some ballot . Our best guess of Coach Moron ' s top six : 1 ) Nebraska , 2 ) Yeshiva University , 3 ) Allegheny County Community_College , 4 ) Notre Dame , 5 ) Nebraska ( Kearney campus ) , 6 ) Penn State . Of course , we ' ll never know who made a fool of himself , mostly because the USA Today / CNN poll protects the identities of the 62 voting coaches . And mock the media members who vote_in the Associated Press poll all you want , but at least they don ' t hide behind anonymity ( and we ' ve got the angry West_Virginia postcards from 1993 to prove it ) . As an educational service to the coach who stuck it to Joe Pa , we devote this week ' s column to an easy-to-use national championship handicapping system . Your odds : PENN STATE ( 2-1 ) PROS : Of the five undefeated teams , the No . 2-ranked Nittany Lions have the easiest path to a perfect season . Penn State travels_to Illinois on Saturday , then returns home for games against Northwestern and Michigan State . The Illini will cause some problems , but Northwestern won ' t . As for Michigan State , expect the Spartans to be in their weepy Win-One-For-Coach- George-Perles mode . Perles is gone at season ' s end , the loser of an ugly power struggle in East Lansing . The Spartans will hang tough for a quarter , maybe two , and then Penn State will blow their helmet flaps inside out . After that , the Nittany Lions will face either Donald Duck , USC or Arizona in the Rose Bowl . Oregon ' s Quack Attack makes_for a heartwarming story , but please--an Oregon Stuns Penn State headline ? We don ' t think so . A USC-Penn State rematch would be interesting if you conveniently ignore two things : The Nittany Lions dominated the Trojans in the Sept . 10 game and the same thing would happen Jan . 2 . And Arizona ? Great defense , but the offense couldn ' t keep_up with Penn State . In four of their last five game , the Wildcats have scored 16 or fewer points . BOTTOM_LINE : Penn State is loaded and Paterno doesn ' t lose many games when he has five weeks to prepare , as he would for the Rose Bowl . CONS : The schedule . Victories over Illinois , Northwestern , Michigan State and , say , Oregon , don ' t exactly send voter adrenaline rates off the charts . Also , if No . 1 Nebraska wins its Orange Bowl game the night before , some of the incentive for Penn State is gone . The chances of the Nittany Lions jumping over a 13-0 Cornhusker team aren ' t good , no matter how convincingly they beat their Rose Bowl opponent . Sadly , Penn State might need the help of others . NEBRASKA ( 3-1 ) PROS : The top-ranked Cornhuskers control their own poll destiny . If they convincingly beat Iowa State on Saturday and Oklahoma on Nov . 25 , they finish the regular season 12-0 and go_to the Orange Bowl , where they ' ll probably face Miami or Florida State . Win that game and the national championship is Nebraska ' s . Simple . The Cornhuskers can do_it too . Their offensive line makes blocking sleds wince . Their defense doesn ' t get the publicity it deserves , but ask Colorado Coach Bill McCartney if he has seen anything better . Their I-back , Lawrence Phillips , is standard Nebraska issue : tough , fast and durable . Their quarterback , Brook Berringer , continues to make believers . And then there is Tom Osborne , whose coaching staff is among the best in the business . CONS : The Iowa State and Oklahoma games are_on the road . The Cornhuskers can ' t afford to struggle in either one , or else they risk losing some first-place votes . And expect Oklahoma to play harder than usual , because it might be the final game for embattled Sooner Coach Gary Gibbs . Even if Nebraska reaches the Orange Bowl undefeated and No . 1 , it still has to beat the Hurricanes on Miami ' s home field or defeat the Seminoles in their home state . That could be a problem , considering that since 1984 , the Cornhuskers are 0-5 in Orange Bowl games and a combined 0-7 against Miami and Florida State in postseason games . ALABAMA ( 4-1 ) PROS : The luckiest team in America has the kind of finishing schedule that could sway voters . If unbeaten and sixth-ranked Alabama runs the table against No . 20 Mississippi State at Starkville , No . 3 Auburn at Birmingham , No . 4 Florida at the Southeastern Conference Championship and then , say , No . 8 Florida State in the Sugar_Bowl , you could make a very strong case for a Crimson Tide share of the national title . Alabama has the incredibly consistent Jay Barker at quarterback , a great defense , a very solid running attack and hasn ' t had a bad break since someone told Coach Gene Stallings he looks good in houndstooth . CONS : A one-dimensional offense . That killer schedule . The law of averages . MIAMI ( 5-1 ) PROS : Positioned nicely at No . 5 , the Hurricanes could be as high as No . 3 or No . 4 if Auburn loses to Alabama or Florida loses to Florida State . Miami ' s schedule is kind : Pittsburgh at the Orange Bowl , a trip to Temple and a visit from unpredictable Boston College to close the regular season . Win those games and it would be hard for the Orange Bowl committee to ignore the Hurricanes . As for matchups , the Hurricanes , led by Warren Sapp , have one of the few defensive lines capable of giving Nebraska ' s offensive line a challenge . Miami also would have the home-field advantage , a huge factor_in a national championship game . CONS : Quarterback Frank Costa doesn ' t remind anyone of Jim Kelly , Bernie Kosar , Vinny Testaverde , Craig Erickson , Steve Walsh or Gino Torretta . The biggest problem for Miami , though , is that one loss against Washington . The Hurricanes have to jump over at least two teams in the AP poll--Nebraska and Penn State--and as_many as four , depending_on what Alabama , Auburn and Florida do . Things are a little easier in the coaches poll . The Hurricanes are ranked No . 3 . AUBURN ( 8-1 ) PROS : The Tigers are two victories away ( they play Georgia at_home and Alabama on_the_road ) from a second consecutive 11-0 season . NCAA sanctions prevent them from playing in a bowl game , but it might not matter . How about this for a hypothetical : Auburn is 11-0 ( again ) , Nebraska loses in the Orange Bowl , Penn State loses or struggles in the Rose Bowl , Alabama loses in the Sugar_Bowl or Florida wins . Who ' s No . 1 ? Our guess is that Auburn will get enough AP votes to make a run at the national title . Sure , the Tigers are serving time in the NCAA big house , but that doesn ' t prevent them from finishing No . 1 in the AP poll . And yes , they don ' t play a bowl game , but that ' s not the fault of this team or Coach Terry Bowden . They ' ve won every game they played , and if the Tigers finish as the only undefeated team , they ' d be our likely choice as No . 1 . CONS : Out-of-sight , out-of-mind mentality of voters could kill Auburn . The Tigers ' season ends Nov . 19 . The next AP vote is Jan . 3 , after the bowl games . Also , a victory over Alabama at Crimson Tide-friendly Birmingham is no gimme . Plus , the Tigers need lots of assistance on Jan . 1 and 2 . FLORIDA ( 9-1 ) PROS : The Gators face South Carolina , Vanderbilt and Florida State to finish the regular season and play Alabama in the SEC championship . A 4-0 finish like that gets noticed , as would a Sugar_Bowl victory against Miami or a possible rematch against the Seminoles . If the AP rankings stay the same going into January--Nebraska , Penn State , Auburn , Florida--the Gators could jump to No . 1 with Cornhusker and Nittany Lion losses on bowl day . that ' s because even if Auburn ends the regular season 11-0 , the Gators will finish with two more games , both of them against probable top 10 opponents--Alabama and Miami or Florida State . If Florida is 13-1 and Auburn 11-0 , voters might lean toward the Gators because of the extra quality victories . CONS : That loss to Auburn . Mutiny at the quarterback position . Florida ' s record against the Seminoles ( 1-3 under Coach Steve Spurrier , 1-6 since 1987 ) . The possibility of Sugar_Bowl officials ignoring a Florida-Florida State rematch and instead choosing TV-attractive Notre Dame for the Gators . FLORIDA STATE ( 50-1 ) PROS : The Seminoles almost always finish strong and could do_it again with victories over Notre Dame , North Carolina State and Florida . After that , they ' d probably play in the Sugar_Bowl , where the Seminoles could face undefeated Alabama . If Florida State wins and Nebraska and Penn State lose , Coach Bobby Bowden might own a share of the national championship . CONS : Multiply Miami ' s problem by two . The Seminoles not only have a loss , but they have a loss to the Hurricanes . To position themselves for a chance at the national title , the Seminoles have to finish ahead of Miami in the regular-season poll . Even then , it might not be enough . If Penn State loses in the Rose Bowl and Miami and Florida State win their bowl games , voters might use head-to-head results to determine No . 1 . If so , the Hurricanes were decisive winners over the Seminoles earlier in the season . Also remember that coalition rules allow the Sugar_Bowl to overrule a Gator-Seminole rematch . TEXAS A &amp; M ( 1 # 000-1 ) PROS : Could finish the regular season with a 10-0-1 record . If everyone else loses their bowl games and Auburn gets ignored and . . . ah , forget it . The Aggies have no chance . THE REST As usual , Nebraska ' s Osborne is grousing about the likelihood of facing Miami or Florida State in the Orange Bowl . OK , so it isn ' t geographically fair . But if Osborne thinks his annual complaints will have any effect on the Orange Bowl committee ' s selection process , think again . &quot; Absolutely not , &quot; said a bowl official . &quot; No way . That will have no influence. &quot; Instead , the Orange Bowl will take the highest-ranked team available . If it is Florida State or Miami , tough . . . . One last Nebraska item : Despite impressive games from Berringer and Phillips in last Saturday ' s 45-17 victory over Kansas , the Cornhusker coaching staff chose offensive tackle Zach Wiegert as its nominee for Big Eight Conference player of the week honors . Why ? Wiegert received a perfect grade in each of the 70 plays against the Jayhawks . &quot; We just thought that was such an amazing thing , &quot; said Osborne , who couldn ' t remember another player in his 30-year career who had done_it .
