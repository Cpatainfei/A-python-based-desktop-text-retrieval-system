   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S ENERGY PLAN MAY FUEL SPREAD OF PLUTONIUM ; ASIA : NEW REACTOR COULD BE FIRST_STEP IN MAKING JAPAN SELF-SUFFICIENT . BUT CRITICS SAY IT AIDS NORTH_KOREA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While the world struggles to block North_Korea from building atomic_bombs , Japan is pursuing a plutonium energy program that critics say undermines such anti-proliferation efforts . A prototype &quot; fast breeder &quot; plutonium nuclear_reactor is set to begin operation next month in an isolated coastal valley near this old Japan Sea fishing port . It is the first in a planned series of plutonium-fueled reactors that could eventually make Japan virtually self-sufficient in energy . But the program gives North_Korea an excuse to pursue its own production of plutonium , which seems intended for nuclear arms -- an issue of top concern to the Clinton_Administration . Washington has been trying , without notable success , to block that Communist state ' s effort through International Atomic Energy Agency inspections . The hard-line Pyongyang regime claims its research is peaceful but charges that Japan ' s effort aims at stockpiling plutonium for possible weapons use . Tokyo vehemently denies this charge . But critics at_home and abroad say that even if Japan ' s intentions are entirely peaceful , in a world trying to stop the spread of nuclear_weapons , it is simply too risky for anyone to build this kind of reactor . Breeder_reactors not only use plutonium as fuel but also convert uranium into more plutonium than they consume . The main attraction of the technology is that this newly created plutonium can be concentrated and itself used as fuel in a continuing cycle that holds hope for almost inexhaustible energy supplies . But plutonium is a far more dangerous substance than uranium -- the fuel used in most nuclear_power plants in Japan and abroad . Plutonium is intensely radioactive , and in the concentrations needed for breeder_reactors , it is directly usable as the raw_material for atomic_bombs , which is not the case for other kinds of nuclear_reactor fuel . The new government-owned research reactor near Tsuruga will provide the first test of an energy strategy conceived in the 1950s . Plans call_for progressively larger facilities to be built until the program reaches fruition in the 2030s with construction of economically viable plutonium power_plants . If all goes well , Japan could also export the technology to other countries . U.S._government policy toward Japan ' s program is ambiguous . Washington has never exercised its power , as a supplier of uranium to Japan , to directly block the drive to build plutonium-fueled energy plants . But embassy officials here have consistently opposed their development . &quot; Our basic policy , for quite a_few years , is that we ' ve been against it , &quot; said a U.S. diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity . &quot; We are trying to discourage the Japanese on plutonium. &quot; The major immediate problem , this diplomat said , is that Japan ' s possession of large quantities of plutonium makes_it all_the more difficult to curb plutonium production in North_Korea . &quot; It ' s hard to go_to North_Korea and say , ' You can ' t do this , ' when Japan does have a very active program , &quot; he said . There are also some fears that Japan itself might someday make nuclear_weapons , as well as concerns that terrorists or agents of renegade nations could raid Japan ' s stockpiles to get material for bombs . During the George_Bush Administration , the diplomat said , another embassy official &quot; tried very hard to get the State_Department involved in telling the Japanese we ' re very much against this . But politically it never happened. &quot; Japan is unlikely to abandon its program , he added . &quot; Energy security is an important part of their national policy , &quot; he explained . &quot; If you have your own breeder_reactor program , you certainly would n ' t need outside energy sources. &quot; The use of plutonium in a &quot; fast breeder &quot; reactor provides Japan a more technically advanced option than current uranium-fueled reactors . The description &quot; fast breeder &quot; comes from the use of fast-moving neutrons -- a kind of subatomic_particle -- to breed more plutonium than is used_up . At the reactor outside Tsuruga , plutonium pellets are now being packed into a core surrounded by uranium . Once enough fuel is inserted -- a process due for completion in April -- a chain_reaction occurs . The plutonium breaks_down into other elements , giving_off heat , which is used for electric_power . Neutrons are also emitted , striking uranium atoms and turning them into plutonium . The 280-megawatt reactor is designed to produce 1.2 tons of plutonium for every ton it consumes . The only resource limitation is the availability of uranium -- and enough of that exists to keep this kind of process going_on a large scale for many centuries , long after the world ' s supply of oil is exhausted . In acknowledgment of the risks as well as the potential benefits of their endeavor , the builders of this first reactor named it &quot; Monju , &quot; a Buddhist figure symbolizing wisdom , who sits calm and serene in total mastery upon a fearsome lion . &quot; The Monju Buddha controlled the lion with wisdom , &quot; said Tadao Aoki , a senior official at Monju . &quot; The rest you can imagine : Monju is controlling nuclear_power with wisdom. &quot; For partisans of the program , even the unhappy diplomatic fallout over nuclear proliferation and a looming global surplus of uranium and plutonium , as Cold_War weapons are dismantled , are insufficient reasons to stop and rethink the plutonium energy strategy . &quot; We are looking perhaps 30 or 50 or 100 years ahead , &quot; Aoki said . &quot; We now have the problem of plutonium abundance . But that ' s just a matter of a_few years or 10 years. &quot; Critics , however , fear that the plutonium lion will prove too wild for human wisdom to tame . For them , Monju is a symbol of technology gone wild , of national pride and bureaucratic inertia leading to danger . &quot; A reactor like Monju has some possibility to explode like a nuclear bomb , because the density of fissionable material in the core is very high , &quot; said Jinzaburo Takagi , a nuclear chemist who is Japan ' s leading campaigner against the program . &quot; Also , because it uses sodium ( as a coolant ) , there is some possibility Monju will experience a sodium explosion. &quot; Aoki acknowledged that theoretically Monju could explode &quot; if you allow everything to be broken &quot; and &quot; an uncontrollable situation happens. &quot; But in reality , he asserted , such a disaster is not possible because of the safeguards built into Monju ' s design and construction . Takagi and other critics also say that the more plutonium in the world , the greater the chances that some may be diverted to nuclear_weapons . &quot; If plutonium is bred at our plants , Japan will possess a huge stockpile of plutonium , and it will be a proliferation concern to the whole world , &quot; Takagi said . Other countries , including the United States and France -- which has an even more technically advanced breeder_reactor called the SuperPhenix -- also once shared the dream of virtually endless energy supplies . The United States dropped its breeder_reactor plans in the 1970s , but research continued . In February , in an effort to discourage plutonium use by the world ' s nuclear industry , Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary canceled $ 112 million worth of research into the use of plutonium in nuclear_reactors . &quot; These projects . . . are totally counter to where we want to go_in our non-proliferation &quot; efforts , she said . France ' s SuperPhenix was shut_down in 1990 because of the danger of fires caused by leakage of liquid sodium . France has decided to restart the plant , but observers generally do not expect Paris to resume wholehearted development of breeder_reactors . This leaves Japan as the only country seriously pursuing a plutonium-based energy policy . Hit by practical difficulties and international pressure , the Japanese program faces various delays , but both critics and supporters say the commitment of the Japanese government to develop this technology has not wavered . The Federation of Electric_Power Companies decided in January to postpone its plan to start construction of a second , larger breeder_reactor by the end of this decade . Difficulty in determining a site and acquiring land were cited as the main reason for the delay . The new target date is 2005 . Delays are nothing new . Monju itself is starting_up two years behind schedule because of technical difficulties , but that seems not to have cooled the enthusiasm of its supporters . &quot; From the point_of_view of Japanese energy security policy , it ' s very important to have . . . the technology to produce electricity from plutonium , &quot; said Yoshikazu Kato , a Science and Technology Agency official . &quot; I don ' t think that basic point_of_view will be influenced by concerns about proliferation or the international situation. &quot; Japan may , however , take steps to cool the criticism , Kato said . &quot; We understand that there is international suspicion that Japan might develop nuclear_weapons , and Japan cannot just ignore such things , &quot; he explained . He noted , for example , that while work_on Japan ' s first plutonium reprocessing plant is continuing , Japanese media have reported that the second plant , originally scheduled for completion in 2010 , is now expected to be delayed about 20 years . Such reprocessing plants can extract plutonium either from spent uranium fuel from regular nuclear_power plants , or from the uranium packed around the plutonium core in a breeder_reactor . Without quite confirming the revised plan , which has not been formally announced , Kato noted that because the cost of uranium has not risen as fast as expected , construction of commercial fast-breeder reactors may be delayed . This in turn would delay the need for a second reprocessing plant , he said . Until Japan completes construction of its large-scale reprocessing plant -- a project that is now under way -- it will remain dependent_on reprocessing plants in France and England . Under long-term contracts , Japan is sending used fuel to those countries for extraction of plutonium . The first shipment of plutonium back to Japan from France arrived here early last year after an international uproar over the voyage of the Akatsuki Maru and its 1.7-ton cargo . Its 20 # 000-mile journey around Africa ' s Cape_of_Good_Hope , past Australia and through the Pacific drew official protests from more_than a dozen countries . Critics charged the ship could sink and pollute the ocean , or perhaps be attacked by terrorists seeking material for nuclear_weapons . The world ' s reaction prompted new questioning in Japan . &quot; Is the Akatsuki Maru a treasure_ship bearing plentiful energy supplies or a ship of gloom that will push the world into an abyss of nuclear proliferation ? &quot; asked an editorial in Asahi Shimbun , one of Japan ' s leading newspapers . Bands of activists , including local organizations and international groups such_as Greenpeace , are mobilizing to protest the start-up of Monju . Anti-nuclear activists face &quot; a chronic situation of frustration , &quot; said Aileen Mioko Smith , an American born in Japan who heads a group called &quot; Stop the Monju. &quot; Most Japanese , she said , &quot; still sort of believe that without nuclear_power the lights will go out. &quot;</TEXT>
