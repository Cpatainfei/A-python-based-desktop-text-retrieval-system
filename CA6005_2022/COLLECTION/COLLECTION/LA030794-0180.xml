   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : TIGHTER CREDIT MAY NOT SQUEEZE WALL_STREET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Coming soon to the Economy Theater , a horror tale : &quot; The Tightening , Part II. &quot; But will it be anywhere near as violent and bloody as the first one ? After another batch of healthy economic reports last week , many Wall Streeters are betting that the Federal_Reserve_Board will tighten credit again soon , for the second time in a month . Brokerage CS First Boston in New York told clients Friday that the Fed could act_as early as today by raising its discount_rate from 3 % to 3.5 % . That rate , which banks pay_for short-term loans from the Fed , hasn ' t been increased since early 1989 . A discount-rate hike , after the Fed ' s quarter-point boost in another key short-term interest_rate on Feb . 4 , would signify that the central_bank is serious about restraining the economy and with it the potential for higher inflation . But the Fed , as more often than not , finds itself in the difficult position of trying to orchestrate the economy without driving stock and bond markets to ruin . And there has been plenty of ruin to go_around in recent weeks , as Wall_Street has responded to the Fed ' s first tightening with a deeper sense of anguish than most pros had expected : Long-term bond yields have surged nearly a half-point since Feb . 4 , while stocks have slumped . Now , however , some experts believe the markets have factored in not only the first Fed rate boost , but the next one as well . That could mean that , if the Fed does act this week , stocks and bonds will respond either favorably to the news , or not at all . Analysts point to the markets ' action on Friday , after the government reported a surprising drop_in the nation ' s unemployment_rate , to 6.5 % from 6.7 % in January : * Short-term Treasury_bill yields jumped_on the news , indicating that traders believe the Fed will seize_on the strong employment report to boost rates again . Yields on 3-month T-bills shot_up to 3.62 % from 3.56 % on Thursday . The T-bill yield was 3.06 % just before the Fed surprised markets with its first rate hike on Feb . 4 . Because that initial hike was just a quarter-point , while the T-bill yield has since risen 0.56 points , it ' s obvious that markets are assuming the Fed will do more , and soon . * While short-term yields surged , long-term bond yields closed little changed on Friday after an initial rise . The 30-year T-bond yield closed at 6.83 % , unchanged from Thursday after hitting 6.88 % early in the day . The reappearance of bond buyers , despite the February employment news , suggested that the market may be comfortable with long-term yields at current levels even if the Fed raises short-term rates further . Indeed , the Fed has made clear that its No . 1 goal in tightening credit early is to quash inflation , which should in theory make the bond market happy because long-term interest_rates are ultimately determined by the level of inflation . * The stock_market had a good_day Friday , signaling that many investors are responding more to the promise of higher corporate profits in a healthy economy than to the risk posed by a gradual rise in short-term rates . The Dow Jones industrials gained 7.88 points to 3 # 832.30 on Friday , and rising issues solidly outnumbered losers on the New York Stock_Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock_Market . Perhaps most significant , the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks leaped 5.97 points to 790.55 on Friday , and is now just 1.2 % below its all-time high of 800.47 set_on Jan . 31 . The Dow , in contrast , is off 3.7 % from its peak . Some Wall Streeters say the surprising strength of smaller stocks in recent weeks may herald another rally in the aging bull_market , despite the rising number of bears who believe that higher interest_rates spell certain death for the bull . &quot; This is a fight between rising ( corporate ) earnings and fear of higher interest_rates , and I think earnings will win , &quot; says Louis Navellier , an Incline Village , Nev. , money manager who runs $ 900 million for clients . But can the bond market also win ? Many pros are less sanguine about bonds ' longer-term prospects , even if the market sails_through the next Fed hike . that ' s because Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and others may keep harping about the possibility of still-higher rates in the future , making_it tough for bond investors to regain their composure . &quot; It ' s difficult for the bond market to look through to the fundamentals of low inflation when so many Federal_Reserve officials are talking_about the next tightening , &quot; says Lacy Hunt , chief U.S. economist for HSBC Holdings , a Hong Kong banking giant . He believes that the Fed ought to lay_low for now . Noting the surge in bond yields and the plunge in_stock markets worldwide since Feb . 4 , Hunt says , &quot; I think the Fed has induced a considerable amount of restraint in the ( economy ) &quot; just with its initial quarter-point interest_rate hike . Gary Schlossberg , economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco , also believes the Fed can afford to hold_off , even though the market is already expecting another quarter-point rate increase . Ironically , he says , the Fed may take its next cue from the bond market : If long-term yields continue to rise , suggesting that investors believe higher inflation is coming , the Fed may have to aggressively boost short rates to demonstrate its resolve to fight inflation . * No Bonus For CDs : Though short-term interest_rates are rising , you ' ll be waiting a long_time for bank and S &amp; L certificate_of_deposit yields to move_up much , warns Bob Heady , publisher of Bank_Rate Monitor . &quot; Godot will show_up sooner , &quot; he jokes . CD yields have barely budged despite the Fed ' s quarter-point rate hike a month ago . The national average yield on 1-year CDs is now 3.14 % , up from 3.08 % immediately before the Fed move , according to Bank_Rate Monitor . &quot; Banks pay what they can get_away with , &quot; Heady notes , and most banks simply don ' t need more deposits today . Given the wide spread between U.S. Treasury security yields and CD yields , most savers in 6-month and 1-year CDs would be better_off buying Treasury securities of those terms direct . * SCEcorp Dividend Cut ? Southern California Edison ' s parent company is warning its 136 # 000 shareholders that their cash dividend may have to be cut , and Wall_Street is acting as if it ' s a done deal . The electric utility ' s holding company , SCEcorp , tells shareholders in the 1993 annual report now in the mail that its earnings are being squeezed as regulators lower its allowed rate of return . In language clearly meant to raise a red flag , John E . Bryson , SCE ' s chief , says in his shareholder letter that reduced returns &quot; unavoidably . . . will affect our ability to raise or possibly even retain current dividend levels. &quot; Companies rarely spook shareholders with talk_of a lower dividend unless chances are substantial that such a cut will occur . Electric utilities are particularly sensitive about their dividends because that payout , not share price appreciation , is the primary reason investors own the stocks . On Wall_Street , SCEcorp shares have plunged with other electric utilities since last fall . Much of that decline has been related to rising interest_rates , which force utility shares down in_order to force their dividend yields_up , so that the stocks are competitive with bonds and other income investments . But SCEcorp ' s 29 % stock slide , from $ 25.75 last fall to $ 18.25 now , has far exceeded the declines of most other utilities . At the current price , SCEcorp ' s annual dividend of $ 1.42 a share provides a yield of 7.8 % -- well above the yields of most other major utility stocks . That return is so high , in fact , it ' s a sign that Wall_Street doesn ' t believe it can continue . Many analysts believe investors have pushed the price down in anticipation of a dividend cut by SCEcorp , effectively valuing the stock based on some lower future dividend . &quot; I think it ' s at least 50-50 that they ' ll cut the dividend , and maybe a little stronger , &quot; said Linda Byus , analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps . SCEcorp ' s net earnings were $ 1.43 a share_in 1993 after one-time charges , which means earnings barely covered the $ 1.42-a-share dividend . This year , Byus expects earnings to be no higher than $ 1.45 a share . Typically , utilities aim to pay_out no more_than 75 % to 80 % of their earnings in dividends . Besides state regulators ' decision to lower what SCEcorp can earn in_line with the long-term decline in interest_rates in recent years ( that ' s how utility returns are set ) , the company has also suffered from the Southland economy ' s recession and from lower-than-expected contributions from its Mission Energy independent power arm . * ZAP FOR INVESTORS ? Is Southern California Edison planning a dividend cut ? D4 CD Yields vs . Treasuries Certificate_of_deposit rates at banks and S &amp; Ls have begun to creep_up with the rise in short-term market interest_rates . But if you have the wherewithal to buy U.S. Treasury securities direct , you can earn much higher yields than on CDs . 04 # 10 , 11 # 13 , 26 Maturity Bank CDs * Treasuries * Treasury yield Advantage 6-month 2.83 % 3.86 % + 1.03 points 1-year 3.14 % 4.27 % + 1.13 points 2 1 / 2-year 3.65 % 5.08 % + 1.43 points 5-year 4.69 % 5.81 % + 1.12 points * Current annualized yields Bank CD yields are national averages .
