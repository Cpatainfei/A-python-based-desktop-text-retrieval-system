   <HEADLINE> LAWYER DETAILS SIMPSON ' S DAY IN GRIPPING TALE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was the central act in a week of high drama , a spine-tingling glimpse at the torment haunting America ' s best-known fugitive . When O.J. Simpson ' s lawyer , under_fire for failing to surrender his client , summoned the media to Century City on Friday afternoon , there was no hint that it would be anything more_than a curt denial that he knew of the ex-football star ' s whereabouts . Instead , over the next half an hour , attorney Robert Shapiro produced a remarkably detailed account of the hours leading_up to Simpson ' s disappearance , all_the while defending his own reputation . In what was surely one of the most captivating news_conferences ever on live TV , it also became apparent that Simpson ' s life -- by his own hand-written account -- could be headed for a sad , tortured end . As a normally jaded press corps listened_in rapt silence , the unflappable Shapiro strode to the polished oak podium in a slate-blue double-breasted suit , and without any introduction , said : &quot; O.J. , wherever you are , for the sake of your family , for the sake of your children , surrender immediately . . . please do_it immediately. &quot; Shapiro , who first gained fame for successfully defending adult film_star Linda Lovelace on cocaine charges , then launched into a flawless description of how a seemingly suicidal Simpson sneaked_away just minutes before police came_to arrest him for the June 12 murders of his ex-wife and her waiter friend . After attending Thursday ' s funeral for Nicole Brown Simpson , Shapiro disclosed , the 46-year-old former running_back chose not to return to his Brentwood home . Instead he was taken_to a sprawling and secluded San Fernando Valley residence , where Simpson was sedated and kept under the supervision of psychiatrists and physicians due_to his &quot; frail and fragile emotional state. &quot; &quot; What I was thinking , &quot; Shapiro said , &quot; and what I told the police_department and the D.A. was that he was suicidal. &quot; About 8:30 a.m. on Friday , Shapiro said , he was contacted at_home by authorities with word that Simpson would be charged with the two murders and was expected to surrender by 11 a.m. Shapiro immediately traveled_to the hideaway and broke the news just as Simpson was waking . The prime suspect was examined again by his internist , whom Shapiro said had found an inflamed lymph_node under one of Simpson ' s armpits . While Shapiro kept_in touch with Los Angeles police every 15 minutes , Simpson called his personal lawyer and updated his will . &quot; We were never concerned he might run , &quot; Shapiro said in his own defense , explaining that he had made similar arrangements to surrender Erik Menendez on murder_charges several years ago . &quot; I believe having four physicians there and his best_friend -- a former professional_football player -- there ' s no way we could have been_better prepared. &quot; When 11 a.m. came and went , anxious police officials called Shapiro , saying they were no longer going_to wait for Simpson to arrive_at Parker Center . At that point , authorities told the lawyer , &quot; We must announce O.J. as a fugitive , wherever he is. &quot; Officers asked_for the address and said they would send a patrol_car to pick him . By then , Simpson was downstairs with former USC and Buffalo Bills teammate Al Cowlings , &quot; wailing. &quot; Although the attorney said he never tipped his client that police were_on the way , Simpson and Cowlings stealthily slipped out of the large house while Shapiro and the doctors waited upstairs in a conference_room . Shapiro said that Simpson was not carrying his wallet or any identification , although he had been given $ 60 in cash to help cover his expenses in jail . &quot; I ' ve never felt worse in my professional career , &quot; said Shapiro , 51 . He added : &quot; I ' ve always kept my word and my clients have always kept their word. &quot; The revelations were another twist in what already had been an emotional roller-coaster -- a week of anonymous accusations and vehement denials that had stirred feelings of anger , grief and betrayal among an entranced public . But there was more , a bombshell that Shapiro had saved for last . Simpson , the lawyer said , had taken the time Friday morning to put his agony in writing . There were three letters , one to his children , one to his mother , and one for the public . Not only would these contain the first statements from Simpson about the accusations , but the one meant for public consumption would be read -- right there and then . &quot; To whom it may concern , &quot; began Robert Kardashian , a businessman and lifelong confidante of Simpson ' s who had been counseling the Hall of Famer during the past few days . It was written with black pen , the letters printed on white , unlined paper . The pages were filled with crossed-out words , marked with corrections and addenda . &quot; First , everyone understand I had nothing to do with Nicole ' s murder , &quot; Kardashian continued reading to his astonished audience . &quot; I loved her , always have , and always will . If we had a problem , it ' s because I loved her so much. &quot; Simpson acknowledged that there been stormy times in the past , noting a widely publicized 1989 New Year ' s fight that left his then-wife bloodied and bruised . Despite his earlier admissions that police had been summoned numerous times to their home , he characterized the dispute as an aberration . &quot; Unlike what has been written in the press , Nicole and I had a great relationship for most of our lives together , &quot; Simpson wrote . &quot; Like all long-term relationships , we had a_few downs and ups. &quot; At one point , he even characterized himself as a &quot; battered husband. &quot; He then thanked all_the people who had filled his life with joy , referring to several dozen friends , former teammates and golfing buddies -- most of them just by their first_names . As he went_on , it sounded more and more like Simpson was saying goodby . &quot; I think_of my life and feel I ' ve done most of the right things , &quot; he said . &quot; So why do I end_up like this ? I can ' t go_on . No matter what the outcome , people will look and point . I can ' t take that . I can ' t subject my children to that . This way they can move_on and go_on with their lives. &quot; As soon as Kardashian had finished reading , reporters began firing questions at Shapiro , who fielded them in an unflinching voice . How did Simpson leave the house unnoticed ? &quot; The house has a front_door , the house has a back_door , &quot; the lawyer dead-panned . Was the letter a suicide note ? &quot; After talking with the four doctors , &quot; he said , &quot; clearly that was their interpretation. &quot; Do you still think he is innocent ? &quot; Next question , &quot; Shapiro barked . Afterward , Kardashian briefly showed the letter to reporters , then folded it in thirds and tucked it in the breast_pocket of his sports jacket . Those close enough to get a glimpse saw this salutation : Peace and love , O.J. Inside the O , he had drawn a happy face .</TEXT>
