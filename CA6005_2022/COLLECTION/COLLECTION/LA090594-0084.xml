   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENT ; GREAT PREDATOR OF THE SEA FINDS ITSELF A VICTIM OF PREDATION ; DESPITE FEDERAL CONTROLS ON OVERFISHING , SHARKS IN THE ATLANTIC ARE UNDER THREAT . SCIENTISTS URGE PLACING SOME SPECIES ON THE ENDANGERED LIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two years after the imposition of strict federal quotas on shark fishing and a ban on the related practice of &quot; finning , &quot; there is little evidence that the depleted population of large coastal sharks in the Atlantic_Ocean is recovering from years of overfishing . In fact , many scientists say that the threat to the ocean ' s most fearsome fish , including the great_white_shark of &quot; Jaws &quot; fame , is so severe that some species should now be listed as endangered and given the same type of global protections that apply to whales and dolphins . Driving the commercial market for sharks is the Asian demand for fins , used in a soup believed to act_as a sexual stimulant . Florida-based brokers pay_up to $ 24 a pound for top-grade shark fins . That price makes finning -- cutting_off the shark ' s dorsal_fin and dumping the wounded animal in the sea to die -- highly profitable . But a growing U.S. taste for shark meat has also helped spawn a directed fishery so vast and efficient that some prized species of large coastal sharks could be wiped_out , scientists warn . Beneath the waves , the disappearance of the marine world ' s top predator would ripple down the food_chain , triggering catastrophic fluctuations in entire populations of stingrays , octopuses , bait fish , lobsters , sea_birds and even mammals . &quot; I don ' t think most people understand what happens when you drastically reduce an apex predator population from the environment , &quot; said shark expert Steve Branstetter , who notes that the numbers of some heavily fished shark species have declined by as much as 75 % in the last two decades . &quot; There are no good_examples in the marine world . But we know that on land , if you remove coyotes or wolves from the environment , you see rabbit populations go wild . They eat all_the vegetation , then the deer population crashes and you have cycles of rise and fall . &quot; The worst part is that I don ' t think anybody cares , &quot; said Branstetter , a biologist with the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Development Foundation in Tampa , Fla . &quot; To many people , a good shark is a dead shark. &quot; Indeed , 19 years after the movie &quot; Jaws &quot; reduced an age-old human fear to a two-hour horror story , shark hunting remains popular as sport and rite of passage . Photographs of beaming fishermen standing next to dead makos and hammerheads are still a sports page cliche . But recreational fishing is no longer the chief threat to large coastal sharks . The U.S. commercial catch of sharks topped 15 million pounds in 1994 , producing a harvest valued at $ 20 million . Last year a shark-management plan drawn_up by the National Marine Fisheries Service set quotas for 39 species of shark found in the Atlantic , the Gulf_of_Mexico and the Caribbean , and banned the practice of finning . When this year ' s quota of 3 # 060 metric_tons was met Aug . 10 , the commercial season closed . The 1995 quota is supposed to rise to 3 # 800 metric_tons . However , two Marine Fisheries Service advisory committees , alarmed by the sharks ' slow recovery rate , have recommended that next year ' s quota be held at the 1994 level . The U.S. Commerce_Department is expected to approve the lower limits . &quot; I think we overestimated the potential for the stock to recover , &quot; Branstetter said . &quot; It ' s going_to take a decade or more even to get sharks back to the level of 1986 , when they were already reduced from 1970s levels by as much as 50 % . &quot; ( There is no quota on sharks caught in the Pacific_Ocean , although a 1994 California law prohibits the taking of great_white_sharks without a permit from the state_Department of Fish and Game. ) The U.S. shark catch began to grow exponentially in the early 1980s , first behind a burgeoning recreational interest fueled by a post- &quot; Jaws &quot; mystique of sharks as the grizzlies of the deep and a glut of big-money tournaments . But by the late 1980s , when consumers began discovering shark meat as table fare and as the Asian market for fins continued to build , the commercial catch_on longlines and in gill_nets far outstripped the recreational take . In 1979 , the total commercial shark catch_on the East Coast was 135 tons . Ten years later the total was 7 # 122 tons , an increase of more_than 5 # 000 % . While several states and a_few other countries have passed laws to regulate shark fishing , some scientists favor global actions to protect shark species that are in decline . That issue is expected to be taken_up in November when representatives of more_than 120 nations meet at the Convention on International Trade_in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora in Ft . Lauderdale , Fla . International_laws protecting sharks are still years away , scientists say . But according to Sonja Fordham of the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington , &quot; it ' s definitely time for international management . Because of their slow growth_rate , late maturity and small number of young , sharks cannot withstand intense fishing pressure . When that happens , the populations just collapse. &quot; The notion that sharks -- sleek , efficient predators that have ruled the world ' s oceans for 400 million years -- could themselves be the victims of predation is difficult for many to accept . Sharks do occasionally bite people -- an average of 23 shark attacks in U.S. waters , mostly off Florida , are reported each year -- and some commercial fishermen say that they catch as_many sharks as ever . Rusty Hudson , who brokers shark fins for a Hong Kong dealer from his home_in Port Orange , Fla. , says government bureaucrats use inaccurate catch data and are &quot; playing politics with science &quot; to keep quotas too low . But most commercial fishermen and scientists agree : Shark stocks have plummeted in recent years . In Chesapeake Bay , studies by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science show that numbers of sandbar_sharks , a large-finned species that accounts_for the bulk of the East Coast commercial catch , have declined by as much as 80 % over the last 20 years . Virginia Institute biologist John A . Musick says declines in populations of dusky_sharks , another commercially valuable species , are similar . Eric Sander , 37 , who operates the 40-foot commercial boat Marsea out of Daytona Beach , Fla. , also has noticed . A few hours and several miles off Florida ' s east coast , Sander and his crew throw_out 600 baited hooks_on longlines that can stretch over eight miles of ocean_floor . &quot; We used to catch 40 to 50 sharks a night , &quot; he said . &quot; Now it might be eight or 10 . There has been a definite decline. &quot; To enable independent fishermen like Sander to compete with bigger commercial fleets , a 4 # 000-pound &quot; trip limit &quot; was imposed this year , meaning that every boat must return to the dock when that quota is met . But Sander sees the day approaching when each fisherman , in addition to the federal license now required , will also be issued an individual seasonal quota on sharks . &quot; As restrictive as that is , it ' s probably the only way to get a handle on the overfishing , &quot; he said . Since sharks reproduce slowly -- at a rate of only 2 % annually -- more restrictions are likely . Fordham is lobbying the Marine Fisheries Service to ban fishing in known shark pupping grounds during the months of April , May and June . She said she favors drastically reducing the number of shark-fishing licenses issued , a figure that now exceeds 1 # 500 . A shark-management plan for the Pacific has also been discussed . &quot; The management plan we have now is a start , but it ' s not strong enough , &quot; she said . &quot; Sharks are extremely vulnerable , and a sustainable fishery may_not be possible . &quot; At least people are looking_at the big picture now . People see that footage on the Discovery Channel of sharks being finned and they are appalled . I ' d like to think that the tide is turning. &quot;</TEXT>
