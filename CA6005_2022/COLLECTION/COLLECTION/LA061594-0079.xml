   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION : VENTURA ; PHYSICS CLASS MAKES ITS OWN UPS AND DOWNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since last fall , Ventura High_School teacher Louise Komp had planned to take her ninth-grade physics class to Magic Mountain amusement_park at the end of the school_year . The plan was for the students to apply what they had learned during the year by testing the velocity , momentum and acceleration of the roller coasters they would ride . But Komp had to take_time_off work this spring because of illness , forcing her to cancel the class trip . So the ninth-graders built their own amusement_park rides . Made of newspaper rolled into chutes and tubes stuck_together with glue , tape and paste , the model rides , which students brought_to class Tuesday , ranged up_to about 5 feet high and several feet long . Although many students regretted they were not_able to go_to Magic Mountain , some said that building the model rides had certain advantages . &quot; We were all kind of disappointed that we didn ' t get_to go , &quot; 15-year-old Nathan Ashby said . &quot; But this was fun . You could make your own ride . If you didn ' t like the loop , you could make_it smaller. &quot; Nathan was one of four boys who built a model called the Dino Rider . Like all_of the projects , the Dino Rider had a prehistoric theme fitting for a &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; -type amusement_park . Each model was required to include tubes or chutes that made a full loop , at least four turns and a four-inch drop . The Dino Rider , for example , had a &quot; stomach-swallowing loop , a heart-stomach drop , four neck-wrenching banked turns and one amazing , spine-crush launch ramp , &quot; its creators said in their written report . But hyping the rides was not enough . As 15-year-old Joey Hays , a co-creator of Dino Rider , said : &quot; It ' s supposed to work. &quot; The test for each of the rides was whether a tiny plastic ball or model car could move through the twists and turns without falling_off or getting stuck . Because the assignment was to build models that worked , the project was a fitting end to the yearlong physics course , Komp said . While most high_school physics classes emphasize using pencil and paper to test mathematical formulas , Ventura High ' s ninth-grade conceptual physics class teaches the principles of physics through discussion and application .
