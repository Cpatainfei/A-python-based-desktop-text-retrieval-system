   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : ' SUTURE ' SWITCH ; HEY , JOHN RANDOLPH ONCE TURNED INTO ROCK HUDSON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scenario : An evil half-brother angles to switch identities with -- then murder -- his semblance in_order to escape suspicion for their father ' s murder . The twist ? Although the characters in the story perform as if the two family members are interchangeable , one supposedly &quot; identical &quot; brother is white , the other black . Welcome to &quot; Suture , &quot; a lush black-and-white , cinematic labyrinth created by first-time filmmakers Scott McGehee and David Siegel , who wrote , directed and produced the film . It opened recently in Los Angeles and New York after winning the best cinematography award at this year ' s Sundance Film Festival ( it will gradually open wider by the end of April ) . As the title implies , there ' s a certain fascination with things surgical in the film as the physical and psychological identity of the black_man , Clay Arlington ( played by Dennis Haysbert , who starred in &quot; Love Field &quot; ) , is &quot; reconstructed &quot; as if he were his privileged , white half-brother , Vincent Towers ( Michael Harris ) , after Vincent ' s diabolical plan to dispatch him fails . In this disturbingly simple achromic world , neither Clay ' s psychiatrist nor his seductive reconstructive surgeon ( played by &quot; thirtysomething ' s &quot; Mel Harris ) , nor any of the other players seem to notice that a ruse informs their story line : that Clay ' s new , post-surgical Vincent is in fact still the African American Dennis Haysbert , not the WASPish Michael Harris . Shot in Phoenix , the low-budget feature may seem like a wildly humorous yarn , a cruel and bewildering deceit , or an insolent slice of neophyte filmmaking . And for different factions of the audience , it will be all_of the above . A filmmaking team since 1989 when they collaborated on short films in San Francisco , &quot; Suture &quot; creators Siegel , 34 , a Rhode Island School of Design alum , and McGehee , 31 , a Japanese film aficionado since leaving Columbia University , insist that they have not made a &quot; film about race. &quot; &quot; We were interested in trying to write a movie about identity , about the relationship between the interior and exterior , and the importance we give to exterior versus interior , and how we come_to know who we are , &quot; Siegel says . For McGehee , the appeal is that &quot; the audience is actually privy to something that the people within the movie are not . Clay ' s physical exterior , for the audience , ends_up being a kind of marker for something that isn ' t there within the story. &quot; But the filmmakers won ' t be pinned_down on exactly what is depicted -- a sole black_man in a movie made by white filmmakers ? A black_man playing a white_man , which renders any distinction moot ? &quot; ( Dennis ) is the only ( African American ) in the film . We were very careful about that , it was very planned , &quot; McGehee says . For his part , Haysbert , who transforms in name only from Clay to Vincent , isn ' t troubled by this aspect of the film . &quot; They didn ' t want to confuse matters by putting any more black characters in it . I had no quarrel with that at all. &quot; For Haysbert , &quot; Suture &quot; addresses &quot; levels of perception. &quot; Mel Harris says she knows that some viewers may_not &quot; get it. &quot; &quot; If you ' re willing to suspend belief about certain things you may visually see , and go_with what people are doing , it ' s a different experience than if you sit there with your arms folded and don ' t take anything in. &quot; McGehee freely admits that &quot; Suture ' s &quot; cinematic tone owes a lot to Japanese auteurs , specifically Hiroshi Teshigahara , whose 1966 surrealistic film &quot; The Face of Another &quot; centers_on an executive whose scarred visage , and very existence , is remade by a plastic_surgeon . The medical accouterments like cellular skin-tissue maps mounted on the wall_in &quot; Suture ' s &quot; doctor ' s office , are , he says , directly lifted from &quot; The Face of Another. &quot; &quot; We wanted the whole world that Clay / Vincent occupied to be a gleaming white world , &quot; Siegel says , &quot; a world where his physical difference would be manifest , both to highlight the formal conceit and to highlight what we felt were the social metaphors of the film. &quot; Though rife_with issues -- from the class_struggle between privileged and marginalized whites to interracial relations when Harris ' rather archly named Dr. Renee Descartes strikes_up an affair with her patient -- it remains to be seen whether the two filmmakers can control the mixed messages . Steven Soderbergh ( &quot; sex , lies , and videotape &quot; ) , who helped raise completion money for the project , considers it &quot; a very bold movie. &quot; He believes that in its budgetary category ( the $ 1-million range ) , the movie outstrips any of its competition . &quot; You see so few films that operate_on that many levels , &quot; he says . Regardless of what the debut filmmakers had_in_mind , &quot; Suture &quot; is destined for a subtextual life of its own . &quot; It tends to break that kind of seamless seduction that goes_on between the viewer and the characters within the story , &quot; McGehee points_out . &quot; Clay is his own Vincent , &quot; Haysbert says . &quot; I kind of wanted to use this ( line ) as the advertising for the film : ' You can love this film , or you can hate it , but you can ' t dismiss it. ' It is very polarizing. &quot;</TEXT>
