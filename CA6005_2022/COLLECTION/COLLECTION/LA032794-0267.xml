   <TEXT> As Assistant Secretary_of_State Winston Lord pronounced the Korean_peninsula &quot; in a serious situation &quot; but not on the &quot; brink of war , &quot; North and South_Korea continued to escalate their fiery rhetoric Saturday , exchanging martial taunts and warnings . Addressing the conflict over North_Korea ' s refusal to allow complete inspection of its nuclear facilities , Lord said , &quot; It ' s a time for firm resolve , patience , preparedness , but it ' s not an imminent crisis. &quot; Nevertheless , angry words from both sides served to fuel a crisis-like atmosphere . In South_Korea , Prime_Minister Lee Hoi Chang was quoted by a Korean news_agency as admonishing his troops at a military camp near the border to &quot; faithfully do their best to drive_off any North_Korean aggression with just one stroke. &quot; In turn , North_Korea , speaking through its official news_agency , condemned South_Korea for placing its armed forces on alert and called the decision a &quot; very dangerous development which may cause a catastrophic crisis on the Korean peninsula. &quot; The South_Koreans said they had readied their troops only after North_Korea put its much larger army on alert . North_Korea maintains a military_force of more_than 1 million , while South_Korea has armed forces of 650 # 000 , bolstered by 35 # 000 U.S. troops . Japan also drew a sharp rebuke from the North_Koreans for supporting a hard-line stance against them . The Korean Workers Party daily , Rodong Sinmun , the main newspaper in Pyongyang , warned that &quot; if the situation on the Korean_peninsula gets_worse and a war breaks_out , Japan will never be safe either. &quot; Attacking Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata for demanding more inspections of North_Korea ' s nuclear facilities , Rodong Sinmun said , &quot; The reckless military_action of the Japanese reactionaries against the Korean people will result in digging their own grave. &quot; Lord , who is in_charge of East Asian and Pacific affairs at the State_Department , said in an appearance on CNN ' s &quot; Newsmaker Saturday &quot; that the Clinton_Administration ' s own display of words and diplomacy in the conflict is at a &quot; perfect_pitch , perfect level of rhetoric. &quot; After a series of negotiations at U.N. headquarters in New York and Geneva last year , U.S. officials believed that they had persuaded the North_Koreans to abide_by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and allow inspections of their nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency . The IAEA has been trying to determine whether North_Korea is diverting the plutonium that comes_out of its nuclear_power plants for use as fuel in nuclear bombs . Lord said &quot; most in the intelligence community think there ' s a better than 50 % chance that they have one or two bombs. &quot; But when inspectors arrived in early March , the North_Koreans refused to grant them access to all their nuclear plants . As a result , the IAEA board of governors in Vienna announced that it could not guarantee that North_Korea had no clandestine nuclear_weapons program , and the agency referred the issue to the U.N. Security_Council . The United States then suspended talks with North_Korea and introduced a resolution in the Security_Council calling_on Pyongyang to submit to full inspections of its nuclear facilities within a month . China , an ally of the Communist North_Korean regime , has balked at the resolution . Because China has a veto , the Security_Council cannot act unless China agrees or abstains . Appearing on the news_show with Lord , both Donald Gregg , who was the George_Bush Administration ' s ambassador to South_Korea , and Rep . Gary L . Ackerman ( D-N.Y. ) suggested that the Administration should do more to defuse the situation since North_Korea is , as Gregg put it , &quot; the strongest conventional military threat that we face anywhere in the world. &quot; Gregg suggested that the Administration needs to open a new channel of communication with the North_Koreans . With its official negotiations now suspended , the United States apparently has relied only on public statements made in Washington and at the United Nations deploring North_Korea ' s refusal to allow the inspections . Lord said , however , that while there have been no behind-the-scenes contacts with North_Korea , the Clinton_Administration is trying to reach influential North_Koreans with a public message that they have a choice : &quot; They can stay in isolation and possible confrontation or they can take the diplomatic track we ' ve offered them and look_to better economic and political_relations with the world. &quot; Lord acknowledged that the Administration had been hampered by the Chinese refusal to support a Security_Council resolution calling_for North_Korean cooperation . But Lord said he hoped that the Chinese might agree to another form of pressure -- perhaps a statement , rather than a formal resolution -- urging North_Korean cooperation . A statement , however , lacks the moral or legal force of a resolution .</TEXT>
