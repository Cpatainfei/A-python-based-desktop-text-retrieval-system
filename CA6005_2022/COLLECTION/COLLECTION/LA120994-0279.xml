   <HEADLINE> FOR MIAMI , SUMMIT IS A CHANCE TO SHOW ITS STUFF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With leaders of 33 foreign countries planning to be present , the Summit of the Americas promises to be a huge international event . But on the eve of the historic weekend conference hosted by President Clinton , the stakes for Miami may loom even larger . &quot; It ' s a big , big show , a celebration for Miami and a chance for the city to clean_up its image , &quot; said Eduardo A . Gamarra , acting director of the Latin_American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University . &quot; What Miami can do is demonstrate its political maturity , transcend exile politics and show that the city can indeed be the site of one of these international meetings. &quot; In a metropolitan area routinely ablaze with impassioned Cuban exile politics , and just this week ranked again by the FBI as No . 1 in the nation in violent crime , summit planners are praying that all international incidents are confined to the official meeting rooms . If not , the world will know . More_than 4 # 500 journalists are expected to be_on hand to record and analyze every word and gesture of the presidents and prime_ministers , as well as those uttered by scores of top diplomats and U.S. officials . In terms of media attention , even the Super Bowl -- which , incidentally , takes_place here Jan . 29 -- pales . Miami was picked as the summit site after intensive lobbying from , among others , Florida Gov . Lawton Chiles and Miami lawyer Hugh Rodham , the President ' s brother-in-law and an unsuccessful Senate candidate . The also-rans : Los Angeles and Chicago . The prestige of hosting the first such summit in 27 years -- and the first in the United States -- could not only burnish Miami ' s image as the commercial gateway to Latin_America , but provide a positive jolt to South Florida ' s sagging tourist economy . Dade County ' s poshest hotels , finest caterers and biggest limousine services have been booked solid for months . Security will be intense . Besides local police , more_than 1 # 000 U.S. Secret_Service agents , along with up_to 4 # 000 other law_enforcement officers from the FBI , U.S. Marshals Service and even Florida National_Guard troops , will be mobilized . Included in those ranks will be rooftop sharpshooters , SWAT teams and frogmen . &quot; We had the Pope a_few years ago ( Pope John Paul II , in 1987 ) , and the hurricane ( Andrew , 1992 ) , but this is without doubt the largest security effort ever , &quot; said Pat Brickman , a spokesman for Metro-Dade ' s 2 # 900-member police_force , which switched to 12-hour shifts Thursday before Clinton ' s arrival . The costs of hosting the summit are enormous . Dade County officials say police overtime alone could top $ 2.5 million . The city of Miami expects to spend $ 800 # 000 on police overtime and supplies . Miami , Coral Gables and the county already have spent $ 15 million to plant 20 # 000 trees and repave 240 miles of roadway over which the prime_ministers and presidents will be chauffeured from one gala to another . Each of the 34 national_leaders will go_home with a bagful of gifts , including nine Swatch watches , a sterling_silver paperweight , an art_deco ceramic pot , a leather-bound journal from Tiffany and a $ 400 crystal globe in a Brazilian wood presentation box . Miami Beach has budgeted $ 130 # 000 just to throw a welcome party Thursday for the working journalists . Of course , there will be several political demonstrations . The largest promises to be what is billed as a &quot; silent march &quot; of Cuban exiles Saturday through the streets of Little Havana to the Orange Bowl , where up_to 100 # 000 people will listen to anti-Castro speeches . Art , music and entertainment are_on the agenda too . A galaxy of stars , including Tito Puente , Liza Minnelli and Rita Marley are to perform Saturday in a Kennedy Center Gala of the Americas . Downtown Miami skyscrapers have been spotlighted with a rainbow of colors , while the homeless encampments under nearby freeways have been bulldozed . The occupants have either gone_into shelters or scattered .</TEXT>
