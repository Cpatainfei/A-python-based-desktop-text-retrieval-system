   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / MEMORIES ; WILLIAM D . MONTALBANO ; SOCCER EXCITEMENT NOT FOREIGN TO HIM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On one coast I met a daughter whom I first deposited on a soccer field when she was 6 . Only yesterday , it seems , but she ' s a Manhattan fast-tracker now , and all month she ' s been watching with kinsmen ' s approval as World Cup defenders scythe impudent attackers . My daughter , four years an All-Ivy sweeper , recited the fullback ' s credo : &quot; The ball can go_past , and the man can go_past , but the man cannot go_past with the ball. &quot; On the other coast , inside the Rose Bowl on Sunday , I met a son playing hooky from a weekend soccer team in Northern California on which he is the only starter who does not speak Spanish as a first_language . My son wore a badge that proclaimed him on-site counsel for one of the USA ' 94 support companies . &quot; The fact is , nobody here needs a lawyer as much as I needed a Cup fix , &quot; he said . I ' m the one who has been watching USA ' 94 from the other end of the telescope . After years of living in Latin_America and Europe , soccer is an old friend . Over cappuccino every morning tifosi of Roma and Lazio taunt one another across our neighborhood bar . I don ' t say much : My morning friends understand that I hail from a soccer-disadvantaged land . Truth is , though , I think it ' s funky to come from a country that can go_to the moon but might never beat Brazil . What has fascinated me in USA ' 94 is less the game itself than the interplay of sport and place . A foreigner ' s game come_home to America . We ' ve both learned from the summer encounter . About size , for one thing . America is so big . Big cars , big cities , big people , big portions . It strikes me every time I come_home . The sense of space and proportion is utterly different here than in Europe . Many of the foreign fans I talked to commented on_their_own need to adapt to impressive new dimensions . A wholesome reset , too ; an eye-opener for visitors who came braced for the glitzy , saccharin , dangerous America that Hollywood has foreshortened into a television_tube . For their part , the most cursory inspection of USA ' 94 might bring_home to Americans the reality that bigger is not necessarily better . Hard to grasp , perhaps , while American_football players bench_press aircraft_carriers and basketball centers endanger low-flying planes . But there is room in the world athletic jungle for cheetahs too . Foot wizards from Italy , Brazil , Bulgaria and half_a_dozen other Cup countries -- typically 5-6 and 155 pounds soaking wet -- are true international giants , Jakarta to Joburg to Jutland . Did American space , all those lovely green fields stretching till morning , influence Cup play ? Experts will tell you better , but I saw a more open , buoyant and interesting soccer this year than I did_in Italia ' 90 . From the press_box at least , it looked_like more fun for players and fans alike . It occurs to me that in its fullness America has also given soccer refreshing space for the psyche . I first went_to a big soccer game on a long-ago Sunday as an exchange student in Buenos Aires . What I remember best were the mounted riot police resolutely separating the blue and yellows from the red and whites . At the 1990 Cup , I covered riots in Sardinia started by hooligan British fans ; violence is no stranger to international soccer . With that as preface , I was nonplussed at my first game here to be engulfed at Giants Stadium by intermingling hordes of Irish and Italian patriots -- raucous , loud , wrapped in their flags , partisan and proud . A recipe for tear_gas , I thought . Wrong . Inside the stadium , 77 # 000 people cheered their lungs out , Ireland won , and everybody went_home peacefully . A few days later in Foxboro , I saw something even more extraordinary ; a huge , human blue and white carpet filing noisily into a lovely suburban stadium . HE-LLAS , screamed the dark_blues for Greece . AR-GEN-TINA , screamed the light blues parading alongside them . I have covered both countries , mind you , and never found many sanguine people in either . But that day , and in all_the others to follow , hardly anybody at America ' s Cup confused sport and life . The message of crowds cheering for 24 countries at fields around the country seems clear : The assertion of difference does not require hostility . For me , such reaffirmation of an old-fashioned American principle may be the most valuable World Cup postscript . For the United States , and for a world riveted to USA ' 94 , and to surprising images of a country it knows too well -- and too_little .</TEXT>
