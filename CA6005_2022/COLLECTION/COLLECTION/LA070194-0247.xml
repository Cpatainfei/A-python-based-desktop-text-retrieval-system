   <TEXT> You could say that I got trapped . I really could not escape ; there was no one to help me -- victims were all around me , and they didn ' t even know that they were victims . I had always thought that the only victims were weaklings and silly impressionable girls , ones that succumbed to peer pressure too easily and followed trends and fads . But me , I was a strong person and with my stout stubborn heart , no way . . . no possible way . I never listened to any one , not even myself . And that was my downfall . In the beginning , the only enemy was my boyfriend , who nagged me about my weight once . So in my haughty pride I dumped him immediately . I figured that was about 145 pounds right there . Then , slowly but steadily , I began to wonder : Am I fat ? Am I overweight ? Maybe Glamour or Vogue said that I could stand to lose a_few pounds , but that didn ' t bother me . After all , what simpleton would put any faith in a magazine that has_on one page an article titled &quot; How to Pop Your Biggest Pimple , &quot; and on the next , &quot; Homicidal Tendencies and You. &quot; Then I got caught_up in the web . I began to exercise like crazy . I kept a diary of all_of the foods I ate and their calorie count . Last summer I went_on a 900-calorie-a-day diet of leaves and twigs . ( Just in case some of you aren ' t proficient in the art of calorie-counting , 900 calories is about half of what you eat for lunch. ) Then I tried a thick shake that supposedly replaces breakfast and lunch . But I gave that up two weeks later when I realized that my body_waste came_out looking remarkably like my breakfast . Well , here I am now , eating normal food . I have come_to terms with myself and my body , curves and all . Don ' t think that my behavior makes me some strange creature . Or that no one can ever act like I did . I don ' t need you to tell me what I already know , that I shouldn ' t let that &quot; stuff &quot; affect me . I am an honors student , meaning that I ' m pretty good at playing the game . And I ' m a strong person , but it happened to me . No one is immune .</TEXT>
