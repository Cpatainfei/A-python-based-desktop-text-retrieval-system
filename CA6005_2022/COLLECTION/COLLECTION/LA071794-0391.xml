   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; THE WINNER IS . . . BRAZIL . . . OR ITALY ; PREDICTIONS : OMARR SEES SHINING STARS , FRITZ SEES CLOUDS FOR THE ITALIANS AND RILEY ' S NOT SAYING WHICH TEAM WILL FOUR-PEAT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The World Cup_final is here at last in the Rose Bowl , the place where anyone with a hunch , a gut feeling or a painted face can select a winner before the game and have no less than a 50-50 chance of getting_it right . It ' s going_to be Brazil or Italy , that ' s for_sure , mainly because everyone else has already been eliminated . Choosing one of the three-time Cup winners , how tough can it be ? Pretty tough , actually , especially for novices . Picking a winner with any degree of expertise , well , it ' s not that simple . Just to show you that the guesswork goes like clockwork when you ' re really in the know , maybe it ' s a good idea to check with experts in the field . Better consult the Prediction People . Start with somebody knowledgeable_about anything associated with a round ball . Make that New York Knick Coach Pat Riley , who is truly accomplished in making predictions . In 1987 when he was with the Lakers , he predicted that the Lakers would repeat in 1988 as NBA champions , which they did . Despite his track record for prognostication , Riley is reluctant to forecast today ' s winner . &quot; I ' d hate to alienate myself on a worldwide basis , &quot; Riley said . &quot; I feel very strongly that the two best teams are in it . It ' s a tossup ; whoever scores first and then plays that four-corner offense like Dean Smith is sitting on the bench. &quot; In Las Vegas , the race and sports books are counting the money wagered on the final . Vinny Magliulo , director of the race and sports book at Caesar ' s Palace , expects more_than $ 5 million to be wagered legally in Nevada , which is more_than the earlier projections . Brazil is still slightly favored by the oddsmakers . For people like weatherman Fritz Coleman of Channel 4 , this is welcome news . Coleman , who is into the predicting business , spent Friday morning with his face stuck in a telescope , studying the comet that was about to sock Jupiter . Coleman was doing this for two reasons : He wanted to make_sure that comet wasn ' t going_to make a right turn and head for California and he wanted to take his mind off the possibility that Brazil might lose . You see , Coleman is a big Brazil-backer , and with good reason . &quot; that ' s because I am a screaming coffee addict and I don ' t want any international incident to stem the flow of coffee_beans from Sao Paulo , &quot; he said . He ' s kidding , right ? &quot; It ' s so close to the truth I could cry , &quot; he said . Sydney Omarr is as close to an expert in forecasting events as anyone , at least for the purposes of this article . For years , Omarr has written a daily syndicated astrological forecast for newspapers , The Times being one of them . But long before Omarr followed the stars , he made predictions about people who saw them . Yes , he picked the fights . He earned his first stars for predictions in 1947 when he told the Philadelphia Record that Jersey Joe Walcott would beat Joe Louis , but he would not get the decision , which is just how it happened . Anyway , after that , the sky was the limit for Omarr . Now , on to soccer . He agreed to predict the fortunes of three key players in today ' s final -- Roberto Baggio of Italy and Bebeto and Romario of Brazil -- using his fine-tuned astrological know-how . Omarr was given only the players ' birth dates , not their names , and here is what he came_up with : Feb . 18 , 1967 ( Baggio ) : &quot; He has a very spiritual personality , although maybe not in the orthodox fashion . He seeks perfection and tends to be moody and ultra-sensitive . He ' s his own severest critic . He ' ll be not so good on offense . He ' ll be somewhat locked_up . He ' ll have a tendency to choke. &quot; Feb . 16 , 1964 ( Bebeto ) : &quot; His play will be somewhat unorthodox . His team will depend_on him more so than ever . He will do some sensational things and when they work he will be a hero . If they don ' t work , he will be subjected_to criticism and ridicule . He either will be very bad or very good. &quot; Jan . 29 , 1966 ( Romario ) : &quot; He depends a lot on intuition . He will be very powerful . In fact , some of the players will feel as if he has taken_over . He doesn ' t tell people what to do , he knows what should be done . And he doesn ' t choke. &quot; But if you include other factors , Omarr ' s syndicated astrological forecast for today ' s World Cup_final might seem inconclusive . Baggio , Bebeto and Romario are Aquarians and , as we all know , the moon is in Scorpio for these three guys under this sign . Now , forget the Three Tenors . Omarr ' s astrological forecast for the Three Aquarians today actually includes this message : &quot; ( the ) ability to win on athletic field. &quot; And is this important ? Omarr ' s own astrological forecast ( Leo ) for today says , in part : &quot; Get_rid_of false notions about situations , people. &quot; So that ' s that . The stars don ' t lie , but they might fudge a little bit sometimes . Find some more prediction experts . John Langbein , in_charge of the Parkfield quake prediction experiment for the U.S. Geological Survey , refused to make a prediction . Actually , this may be good news for both teams , judging by the Parkfield track record -- his group predicted there was a 95 % chance of an earthquake of at least a 6 magnitude at Parkfield between 1985 and 1993 . It didn ' t happen . Someone who ought to know a thing or two about predictions is Lucile Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey and Caltech . If the ground shakes today , she can be reasonably sure that either we are having another earthquake or Bebeto , Romario and Mazinho are dancing again . &quot; Let ' s put it this way : My son , Sven , thinks it ' s going_to be Brazil , and he ' s a soccer expert , &quot; Jones said . &quot; He ' s 7 and he ' s gone World Cup mad too. &quot; Brad Glasman is a financial adviser for Prudential Securities in Encino . His job requires him to know something about the future , at least as far as money goes . Anyway , Glasman is an expert in_stocks , bonds and Brazil , which he thinks is going_to win . If Brazil wins , Glasman has some free advice . &quot; Buy Telebras , the biggest telephone_company in Brazil , &quot; Glasman said . &quot; I figure that if Brazil wins , some of those telephone_bills down there are going_to be astronomical and the stock is going_to go sky high. &quot; And what if Brazil loses ? &quot; Buy the lira , &quot; Glasman said .</TEXT>
