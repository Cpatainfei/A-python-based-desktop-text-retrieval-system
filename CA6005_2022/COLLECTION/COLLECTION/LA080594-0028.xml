   <HEADLINE> ACHIEVING TRUE JUSTICE IN RWANDA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new government of Rwanda wants to bring thousands of killers to justice . That is appropriate , for ethnic massacres cannot go unpunished in Africa or anywhere else . But the Rwandan Patriotic Front , victors in that country ' s bloody civil_war , should leave any war-crimes trials to impartial international authorities . Its new government , dominated by Tutsi tribe members , cannot risk even the appearance of revenge on members of the Hutu tribe . That would discourage relief efforts and possibly trigger another cycle of violence . The world , though slow to give a hand during the Rwandan crisis , is not ignoring what the United Nations described as &quot; the planned and concerted &quot; killing of an estimated 500 # 000 Tutsi civilians and their moderate Hutu neighbors . On Monday , U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali named three African legal_experts to investigate reports of genocide and other atrocities . A similar approach was recently used in Bosnia . The U.N. Security_Council set_up the Balkans War_Crimes Tribunal for &quot; ethnic cleansing , &quot; murder , rapes and other related offenses committed in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina . That step was viewed last year as historic because it was the first international war-crimes tribunal set_up since the Nuremberg trials at the end of World_War_II . Rwanda ' s nascent government understandably does not want to wait_on the United Nations . But the Patriotic Front is not exactly blameless in the Rwandan conflict . U.N. officials found evidence that it carried_out arbitrary executions . In this atmosphere , patience is the best prescription for a country trying to recover from an unprecedented blood bath . More_than 1 million Rwandans fled the chaos . Among the refugees are defeated soldiers who are evading justice . Anywhere from 20 # 000 to 40 # 000 Hutu soldiers fled to Zaire , for example . They have not relinquished their antagonisms or their promise to retake Rwanda . These former soldiers are not innocent refugees . Many are war_criminals standing in_line next to people who were their victims . These are the people the Rwandan government wants to put_on trial . But it cannot act_on its own . To do so would only make reconciliation more difficult between Hutus and Tutsis , and make_peace all but impossible in the country they all call home .</TEXT>
