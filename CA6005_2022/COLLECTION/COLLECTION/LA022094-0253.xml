   <HEADLINE> A CALMER GONZALEZ BEATS CARBAJAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Finesse , not a free-for-all . Smarts , not heart . To the shock of almost everyone except Humberto ( Chiquita ) Gonzalez , the sequel to a slugfest began sleepily , developed subtly and was won with a demonstration of precision . Using a frustrating style and ignoring a deep gash that opened_up in the early rounds over his left eye , Gonzalez avoided the all-out pace of his first fight against Michael Carbajal , and avoided Carbajal ' s jolting left hook in the process . The result was Gonzalez winning by split_decision , and taking two-thirds of the light-flyweight championship from Carbajal on Saturday night before 10 # 333 at the Forum in a fight that never seemed to fall_into a real rhythm . There were flashes of fury and occasional blasts like the past , but for the most part , the rematch was a faint echo of the first raucous fight between Carbajal and Gonzalez , two fighters who had grown more wary , not wild , after almost a year . Carbajal at times tried to get Gonzalez to join him in a brawl , and landed some heavy right_hands in the process , but looked frustrated by the middle rounds and never jarred Gonzalez . There were no knockdowns , in direct_contrast to the first fight , in which Carbajal was sent to the canvas twice before knocking_out Gonzalez in the seventh . &quot; I was trying to get him to fight , &quot; Carbajal said . &quot; He ' s a fighter . But against me , it ' s a different story. &quot; Judge Hank Elespuru of Sacramento scored it 117-113 for Gonzalez , and Ray Solis of Mexico scored it 115-113 for the winner . Mike Munoz from Phoenix scored it 115-114 for Carbajal . Carbajal now is 30-1 , Gonzalez 38-2 . Obviously recalling the devastating knockout he suffered last March 13 at Carbajal ' s hands , Gonzalez , from Mexico , never was in serious trouble Saturday night , though his nimble retreats did draw some boos . He slowly gained momentum starting with the fifth round and won the ninth through the 12th on two of the three judges ' cards . &quot; My plan was to put_on pressure in the later rounds , &quot; said Gonzalez , the new International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Council champion . It ' s the second time Gonzalez has regained the WBC crown . &quot; That was my plan from beginning to end , to start slow and build momentum . I kept going. &quot; Gonzalez stayed_away_from Carbajal ' s power punches through most of the first four rounds , and the blood streaming down his left cheek never seemed to quicken his pace or bother him . In the fifth , Gonzalez finally began moving forward , plying Carbajal with sharp combinations from a left-handed stance . The first signs of a possible repeat of the action of the first fight came_in the sixth round , with Gonzalez zeroing_in on Carbajal and Carbajal answering with overhand rights . In the eighth , Gonzalez waded in again , scoring against Carbajal ' s head with several right and left hooks . But he backed_away before he could do any real damage . By the ninth , Gonzalez was scoring often , but neither fighter had hurt the other . The 10th was a triumph of Gonzalez ' s strategy , as he leaned in_for effective combinations , then pulled_out of the way before Carbajal could catch him with any meaningful punches . Gonzalez started quickly again in the 11th , and again bounced away from close quarters before Carbajal could unleash . He stuck and moved through most of the rest of the round , then landed several heavy shots in the final minute , appearing to daze Carbajal at 2:55 of the round . Both men were bloodied as the 12th and final round started , and Gonzalez opened it with another flurry that had Carbajal backpedaling . As the bell rang , both men lifted their arms in celebration . &quot; I have no excuses , &quot; Carbajal said . &quot; The judges said he won , what can I do ? I don ' t agree . I believe I landed more solid punches , I pressed the fight. &quot; Carbajal , who never flinched at giving Gonzalez a rematch after their first fight , said he expects one from Gonzalez . &quot; He better give me the rematch , &quot; Carbajal said . &quot; I want a rematch as soon as possible. &quot;</TEXT>
