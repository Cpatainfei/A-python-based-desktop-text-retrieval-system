   <HEADLINE> UNOCAL TO WRITE OFF $ 500 MILLION ; MOVE PUTS IT IN THE RED ; ENERGY : CHARGE REFLECTS LOWER VALUES FOR FIELDS AND AN ONGOING REORGANIZATION . ANALYSTS CALL THE MOVE A POSITIVE ONE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a move that will plunge the company into the red this year , Unocal Corp . said Monday that it will write_off nearly $ 500 million after taxes to reflect lower values for gas and oil fields and larger-than-expected environmental cleanup costs . The big fourth-quarter charge reflects an ongoing reorganization at the Los Angeles-based energy company , which is cutting operating_costs and trimming money-losing operations , industry_analysts said . The charge includes , for example , $ 15 million to cover a 40 % reduction in corporate staff announced last month . The cuts will eliminate about 630 jobs over two years . &quot; It is part and parcel of the broad changes going_on &quot; at Unocal , said energy analyst Eugene L . Nowak at Dean Witter in New York . &quot; It ' s a realistic adjustment to what ' s happening . It should be viewed_as a positive. &quot; Unocal and analysts said the oil and gas write-off is primarily an accounting change that will have no cash impact . The lower values of some domestic natural_gas and oil fields will actually reduce Unocal ' s depreciation expenses by about $ 70 million , the company said . About $ 275 million of the after-tax charge comes from a change in the way the company values its oil and natural_gas reserves . Instead of putting a value on all Unocal properties in one country , the company broke the value down on a field-by-field basis to get a more accurate look_at the performance of its holdings , spokesman Barry Lane said . Many fields whose value was reduced are located in the Central United States , including Texas and Louisiana . Oil fields off the California coast are also included . The company also wrote_down $ 22 million after taxes on non-oil and gas properties . Lane said the revaluation of property values was not related to any other changes at the company . But Nowak at Dean Witter said the field write-offs could be a prelude to their possible sale . Several big oil_companies have been selling their U.S. oil fields in favor of overseas holdings . &quot; They will be selling a lot of properties , &quot; Nowak said . &quot; They will try to focus_on profitable products. &quot; * Unocal said it will also add between $ 93 million and $ 155 million after taxes to reserves earmarked for environmental cleanup after discovering that the costs of cleaning_up properties either closed or sold were higher than expected . In addition , the company expects to record a $ 22-million after-tax charge for litigation expenses . Lane said the increase is not related to a particular case .</TEXT>
