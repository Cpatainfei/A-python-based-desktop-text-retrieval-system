   <HEADLINE> PROPOSALS WOULD SLASH FAMILY WELFARE BENEFITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taking a page from President Clinton ' s welfare reform plan , Gov . Pete Wilson joined a growing list of governors Friday who are proposing that able-bodied adult recipients be limited to two years of cash benefits . In a renewed assault on welfare costs , the Republican governor presented the Legislature with spending proposals that , in addition to imposing time_limits , deeply cut cash benefits , provide tough new tools for fraud detection and put aid restrictions on teen-age mothers . The reductions are aimed at Aid to Families With Dependent Children , by far the largest welfare program . Wilson ' s proposals would produce $ 460 million in savings in the $ 2.7-billion AFDC budget . Many of the recommendations borrow heavily from the governor ' s Proposition 165 , a welfare plan that was soundly defeated by voters in 1992 . But this year Administration officials said they hope to succeed in the Legislature because several of the governor ' s proposals previously rejected by lawmakers now parallel programs being considered by Clinton ' s welfare reform task_force . Two proposals that Wilson again included in his budget are getting attention in Washington : eliminating benefits for children born to mothers on welfare and for teen-agers who do not reside with their parents . Wilson said he was recommending steep cuts_in grants in an effort to control costs , encourage adult recipients to work and curtail growth of the welfare rolls . His cuts would reduce grants by 10 % beginning July , 1994 , and by an additional 15 % in January , 1995 , for all families that included an able-bodied adult . The cuts would be offset somewhat by an increased allotment of food_stamps . For a typical family of three -- a mother and two children -- the maximum monthly cash grant would eventually drop to $ 464 , the least California has paid since 1981 . Wilson ' s attempts to impose reductions of similar magnitude in previous budget years have been rejected by the Democrat-controlled Legislature , although lawmakers have approved smaller cuts_in each of the last three years . Under Wilson ' s plan , beginning in 1996 all able-bodied adult recipients who had collected benefits for a combined 24 months would be cut from the rolls . Their children would still receive benefits and the entire family would qualify for medical_aid and food_stamps . State officials estimated that the time_limits would apply to about 39 % of the caseload , or 479 # 000 families . Similar limits are being considered in Vermont and Iowa and have been enacted in Wisconsin . Social_Services Department Director Eloise Anderson said the Republican governor ' s proposals reflect a nationwide move to redesign AFDC to promote the work ethic . &quot; We have to look_at AFDC as a program to help you work . The philosophical basis for AFDC is no longer to help a mom stay home with her kids , &quot; she said . But advocates for the poor called the proposals punitive . &quot; Perhaps the governor is trying to make the streets safer because he knows his welfare plan will mean more families will be living_in them , &quot; said Jamie Court , associate director of Harbor Interfaith Shelter . Unlike the national welfare proposals , Court said , Wilson ' s plan did not include some programs that would make the transition off welfare easier . He said that for many families to move off welfare , they would need job programs , subsidized child_care and in some cases community service jobs . Declining Welfare Grants California ' s maximum monthly cash grant for a family of three receiving assistance under the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program continues to decline sharply . 03 # 12 , 07 # 11 YEAR GRANT % DECLINE Aug . 1989 $ 694 Sept . 1991 $ 663 4.4 % Nov . 1992 $ 633 4.5 % Dec . 1992 $ 624 1.3 % Sept . 1993 $ 607 2.7 % July 1994 $ 546 10 % * Jan . 1995 $ 464 15 % * * Proposed in 1994-95 spending plan . The January cut would apply only to families in which there is an able-bodied adult . Source : California Department of Social_Services .</TEXT>
