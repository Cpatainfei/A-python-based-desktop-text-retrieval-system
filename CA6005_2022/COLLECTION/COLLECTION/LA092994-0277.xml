   <HEADLINE> DOG GONE , AND IT COULD PUT OFFICIAL OUT OF COMMISSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the second time , Cassie -- or maybe it ' s Lady -- is missing . So the search is_on again in a dog-custody case that has pitted a Lawndale planning commissioner against a local family , Lennox sheriff ' s detectives , the district_attorney ' s office and several members of the City_Council . The 2-year-old unlicensed black dog was last seen Monday night in the back yard of Planning Commissioner Edie Warwick ' s home . The problem , officials say , is that Warwick is not the owner of the missing dog she calls Lady . Its name is Cassie , they say , and it belongs_to Lawndale residents Joseph and Vicky French , who claim Warwick has been holding the chow mix against its will . Now Warwick is facing criminal charges for keeping the dog and dismissal from her job as commissioner . * The problem started Sept . 11 when Cassie disappeared from the_Frenches ' yard . After a futile search , the family placed a lost dog ad in a local paper . That same day , Warwick found a black dog wandering several blocks from her home . She took it home , named it Lady and took_out a &quot; found dog &quot; ad , she said . When the_Frenches saw Warwick ' s ad on Sept . 16 , Joseph French and his two sons , ages 11 and 7 , went_to retrieve their wayward pooch . French produced a photo of himself with the dog , but Warwick says the dog failed three times to &quot; bound across the floor and leap into his arms. &quot; Because French produced no vet bills , dog license or a clear photograph , she decided he was not the owner and refused to release the dog . &quot; I know he is not the rightful owner , &quot; she said . French called the sheriff . Warwick called the mayor . When sheriff ' s deputies arrived , they demanded the dog be handed_over to the_Frenches . Warwick refused , saying she feared for the dog ' s well-being . Mayor Harold E . Hofman and Councilman Larry Rudolph asked Warwick to release the dog . Still Warwick refused . Sheriff ' s officials assured the_Frenches they would get their dog back and turned the case over to detectives . But Detective H . D . Garcia had no luck , either . * Despite his warnings that she would be charged , Garcia said , Warwick refused to give_up the dog . On Friday , the district_attorney charged Warwick with delaying an investigation and misappropriating lost property . She is scheduled to be arraigned Oct . 6 . Warwick said she would only yield to a judge ' s ruling . &quot; You have to figure_out what you are about and live a life that shows it , &quot; she said . But in the meantime , Cassie -- or Lady -- has disappeared again . Warwick says she went shopping Monday evening , and when she returned , she found her two white American Eskimo show dogs alone in the back yard with no sign of the black chow . The Frenches blame Warwick . &quot; Does she really believe we ' d believe ( the dog ) just disappeared ? &quot; Vicky French asked . * Warwick said she has no idea where the dog is and denied she has hidden it . &quot; I ' m in enough trouble already -- why would I do something so stupid ? &quot; she asked . Deputy Dist . Atty . Ralph Shaprio said he intends to prosecute Warwick on the initial charges and vowed that more charges could be filed if evidence is found that Warwick has hidden the dog . Warwick says her friends have abandoned her , and the City_Council is discussing her removal from the Planning_Commission . &quot; I thought these people were my friends , &quot; she said . And the_Frenches still have no dog . &quot; I told my boys , ' Don ' t worry , we ' ve got the law on our side , we ' ll get Cassie back , ' &quot; Vicky French said . &quot; Now what do I tell them ? I can sue , but that doesn ' t mean we ' ll get our dog back. &quot;</TEXT>
