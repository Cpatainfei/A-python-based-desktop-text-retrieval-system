   <TEXT> There was reason for jubilation at the annual meeting of the National Federation of Interfaith Volunteer Caregivers Inc. , held April 23-26 in Arrowhead Springs . Not only did the organization mark a decade of providing non-medical care to incapacitated and chronically ill people , but it also announced a $ 23-million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to a Faith in Action campaign to add 900 local care-giver programs to the 400 in existence across the country , including eight in Southern California . According to Kenneth Johnson , a Kingston , N.Y. , physician who persuaded the foundation to fund an initial grant to launch the program 10 years ago , &quot; The point is to make_it possible for frail and disabled people and those who love and look_after them to live their lives to the fullest . Who can better make that a reality than the faith community ? &quot; Local care-giver programs are independent and autonomous , although affiliated with the federation , which provides training in interfaith outreach , volunteer supervision and fund raising . Patricia Meredith is the executive_director of Caregivers : Volunteers Assisting the Elderly in Ventura County , one of the first programs in the nation . It became self-sufficient three years after receiving a start-up grant from the foundation in 1984 , and now runs_on assistance from individuals , businesses , religious organizations and United Way . It has volunteers from 22 churches and synagogues . &quot; Our society does not provide very good services for frail elderly people , &quot; Meredith said . &quot; It is_better not to let the inability to buy groceries or get_to the doctor land them in a board and care facility or nursing_home . That is both bad for them and a burden to society . Our program is the first line_of_defense for people who want to stay in their own homes. &quot; In Ventura County , most but not all volunteers are retirees . &quot; We do have_younger people , &quot; Meredith said , &quot; but our clients need help mostly during working hours. &quot; Churches , synagogues , mosques , Buddhist temples and other organizations interested in starting a care-giver organization are encouraged to apply to the Faith in Action program for start-up grants of $ 25 # 000 to $ 40 # 000 .
