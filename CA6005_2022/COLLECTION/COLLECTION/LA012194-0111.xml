   <TEXT> When Richard M . Nixon mounted the stage at his presidential library Thursday , he wrapped one arm around the man who had been his second vice_president , and waved to the gathering of friends and former colleagues who had come_to pay him tribute . One almost expected his waving hand to make the &quot; V &quot; for victory sign that became his trademark during a long political career , flashed for the cameras even on the day he left the White_House after resigning under threat of impeachment from the Watergate scandal . But Nixon didn ' t do_it on this 25th anniversary of his first presidential inauguration . He didn ' t have to . Because in the eyes of his assembled friends and colleagues , Nixon , 81 , has transcended his time as a mere politician to become a world statesman , with the shame of Watergate receding into the past . His legacy should not be that he was the only American President who resigned from office , Nixon stalwarts argue , but that he was the American leader who re-established relations with China , opened the first_period of detente with the Soviet_Union , and knew precisely what America ' s Cold_War role should be . Now , almost 20 years after leaving the White_House , the image of Nixon the ruthless politician may be fading into what one historian describes as &quot; not just our elder_statesman , he ' s our beloved elder statesman. &quot; &quot; He ' s back , and he ' s respected , and he is welcome in the White_House , and people do turn_to him for advice , and his books are bestsellers , &quot; said Stephen E . Ambrose , a Nixon biographer and a history professor at the University of New Orleans . &quot; It ' s almost a miracle. &quot; * A new policy center at the Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace that was formally announced Thursday is expected to add historical focus to Nixon ' s achievements , particularly in the area of foreign_policy . But never , political observers say , will revisionists be able to separate Nixon from the Watergate scandal that brought_down his presidency . &quot; I think it will be impossible in our lifetime not to think_of Watergate when we think_of President Nixon , &quot; said Suzanne Garment , a resident scholar of the American Enterprise Institute who has written_about the mistrust and cynicism that has marked the American political_system in recent times , and whose husband , attorney Leonard Garment , was an insider in the Nixon White_House . &quot; What happens . . . is that we are coming_to think_of him in a much more complex way . . . . That complexity grows and makes him a much more fascinating figure. &quot; &quot; There are some respects in which he is a more mellow man , with more interesting judgment than ever before , &quot; Garment added . &quot; On the other hand , Watergate will not disappear . So you take the good with the bad. &quot; A former staffer , Dewey Clower , recently recounted a conversation he had with Nixon shortly after the resignation in which the former President said that &quot; Watergate was like a gnat flying around my face until it got so big it swallowed me. &quot; But ultimately , Nixon would not be swallowed by political defeat , Clower added . &quot; I think he has probably made the greatest recovery that ' s possible. &quot; * His staying power -- his ability to bounce_back long after foes have proclaimed him politically dead -- was touched_on during the reunion by those who served in his Administrations . &quot; When thinking_about President Nixon and how he helped to meet and to win some of our greatest public challenges of all time , and how he met and prevailed in a myriad of personal challenges as well , it comes_down to two words in my opinion : resolve and resilience , &quot; former President Gerald R . Ford said in a speech at Thursday ' s ceremonies . &quot; The resolve to stay the course against communism , against all odds . . . the resilience to outlast , sometimes even outlive his critics in one personal crisis after another. &quot; Clearly , few national politicians in American history suffered the harsh treatment that Nixon endured . Nixon jokingly called attention to the criticism he has received as he stood before about 1 # 000 friends and former Cabinet officers . Referring to a small but noisy group of protesters stationed on the perimeter of the museum grounds , Nixon said , &quot; I hope you haven ' t been distressed by some of that background_noise that we ' ve had here . I remind our young people out there that I ' ve been heckled by experts. &quot; But Nixon was not always so mellow in reacting to demonstrators , particularly Vietnam protesters , some of whom ended_up on his political &quot; enemies list. &quot; In his lengthy public career , Nixon ' s political misfortunes took_on hyperbolic proportions . Comedians hunched their shoulders , stuck_out their chins and shook their heads in imitations of &quot; Tricky Dick , &quot; repeating his famous phrases : &quot; You ' re not going_to have Dick Nixon to kick_around anymore , &quot; and &quot; I am not a crook. &quot; * While his present-day promoters tend to focus_on his achievements , little is said about his secret decision to invade Cambodia , which set the stage for a Communist takeover of that country , or the decision to send_in the National_Guard to break_up anti-war demonstrations at Kent State University in Ohio , which resulted in four deaths and gave the anti-war movement one of its most enduring images . After resigning the presidency and suffering a lengthy self-imposed exile from the public light , Nixon has worked to restore his tarnished image . He has written his memoirs and other books about global politics -- his 10th is scheduled to be published in June -- and he has continued his involvement in foreign affairs . Nixon also has advised every President who has succeeded him , according to his staff , and has held policy discussions with leaders of other nations . But more_than any policy center or book Nixon authors , the former President himself is the best reminder of his greatness , said Ambrose , the Nixon biographer . &quot; Sitting at a table with Nixon is to sit with history as you can do with no other person , &quot; Ambrose said , noting that Nixon ' s national political involvement -- which began with his election to Congress in 1946 -- spanned the Cold_War . &quot; You want to talk_about Khrushchev ? Nixon can talk_about Khrushchev . He was there . He knew him. &quot; Nixon demonstrated the depth of his expertise during the ceremony at which he spoke_for almost half an hour without relying_on notes . As he reminisced about the past and shared his views on how to maintain peace beyond the Cold_War , he recited anecdotes about world leaders such_as Mao Tse Tung , and quoted the_likes_of Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle . After the ceremonies , those who were invited to watch Nixon ' s reunion with his former Cabinet officers said he still had much to offer American policy planners . &quot; He has served his country through World_War_II , the Korean_War , the Vietnam_War and the Cold_War , and if you don ' t put him in that perspective -- a leader who has guided this nation through many crises -- you won ' t see the great man , &quot; said 32-year-old John Carvelli of Orange . John Stahter , 43 , also of Orange , said &quot; Richard Nixon has an uncanny ability to sense the importance of events and he knows how to influence them . In some ways , his ability to influence world events is greater now than it has ever been because there is hardly anyone left of his generation. &quot; While Nixon has tended to focus his attention in recent years almost exclusively on foreign_policy matters , he also revealed Thursday that he is still mindful of the pressures of domestic politics . Remarking on Adm . Bobby Inman ' s decision to withdraw his name from consideration for defense_secretary because of public attacks he expected -- a statement that Nixon called &quot; strange and sad &quot; -- the former President posed the question : &quot; Was it worth it ? &quot; &quot; Well , my answer , very briefly , is this . Politics is never going_to be heaven , and sometimes it ' s hell . But it was worth the trip. &quot; Times staff writers Matt Lait and Lily Dizon contributed to this story .</TEXT>
