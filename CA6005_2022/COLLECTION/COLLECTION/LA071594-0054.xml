   <HEADLINE> GERMAN TROOPS JOIN BASTILLE DAY PARADE IN PARIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> German soldiers paraded down the famed Champs Elysees on Thursday , the 205th anniversary of the_French Revolution , riding armored vehicles through the city for the first time since 1944 in a grand though controversial gesture of French and German reconciliation . The 200 German troops , part of a new , five-nation Eurocorps commanded by German Gen . Helmut Willmann , joined 7 # 000 marchers in the annual military parade , passing in review before French President Francois Mitterrand , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other visiting dignitaries . &quot; I felt a lot of emotions , &quot; Mitterrand , a Resistance leader during the 1940-44 Nazi occupation , said later . &quot; But , most of all , I was happy that we are able to choose between the past and the future , and that we choose the future. &quot; Mitterrand had invited Kohl and the Eurocorps to the annual Bastille Day festivities in hopes of ending , once and for all , the legacy of bitterness stemming from World_War_II . But the decision was sharply criticized by many in France , where it touched_off emotional opposition from those who find it difficult to forgive the four-year Nazi occupation of this country . German officials were deliberately not invited to commemorations last month of the 50th anniversary of the Allied D-day landings in Normandy . But Mitterrand said the parade on Bastille Day -- which marks the storming of a notorious prison , an event that launched the revolution against the monarchy -- was the proper occasion for closing the book on the past . The young German soldiers from the 294th Panzer Grenadier Battalion paraded as part of the Eurocorps contingent , made_up of soldiers from Germany , France , Spain , Belgium and Luxembourg . The force will not be fully operational until October , 1995 , officials say . The Germans roared down the broad avenue , from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde , in armored vehicles bearing a black-and-white military cross that closely resembles the Iron Cross of World_War_II . A French military_band played Beethoven ' s &quot; Ode to Joy , &quot; the official Eurocorps anthem , as the multinational units arrived_at the reviewing stand . Thousands of onlookers lined the avenue on a warm , overcast day and greeted the procession with loud applause , an ovation repeated for two other crowd favorites , the_French Foreign Legion and the Fire_Brigade . Jet fighters sailed over the wide avenue , leaving trails of smoke in the blue , white and red colors of the_French flag . For most in France , especially those born after the war , the goodwill gesture was welcome . Recent opinion polls indicated that about two-thirds of the_French public supported the invitation . But many older_French , especially those who had relatives killed by the Nazi war machine , grumbled . They said they see these German soldiers not as symbols of a future unified Europe but rather as descendants of a regime that nearly succeeded in stealing France from the_French . French Adm . Philippe de Gaulle , son of the late president and leader of Free France during the war , said he was opposed to the spectacle . &quot; This is neither the place nor the date , &quot; he said . The opposition cut_across party_lines , from the Communist_Party to former President Valery Giscard d ' Estaing to at least one minister in the current conservative government . Charles Pasqua , minister of the interior and a former Resistance fighter , joined those arguing that it was too soon . &quot; This is the 50th anniversary of the liberation , &quot; he said . &quot; Next year would have been a better choice. &quot; Mitterrand , 77 , who was wounded and taken prisoner during the war , said he sympathized_with Pasqua and remembered his own &quot; profound sadness &quot; when the Germans marched into Paris . &quot; But today , I feel joy at the thought that half a century has been enough to resolve the problems of two world_wars , &quot; Mitterrand said . Pasqua and others were &quot; thinking_of the past , &quot; he added . &quot; I am thinking_of the future . We must think_of Europe and we must prepare a united Europe . We can ' t spend our time lamenting the past. &quot; Kohl appeared to be sensitive to the feelings of many in Europe during this year of World_War_II anniversaries . In a move welcomed by many in France , Kohl brought with him to the parade Thursday three sons of Germans executed for their links to the failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler in July , 1944 . Among the sons was Manfred Rommel , 65 , the mayor of Stuttgart . His father , Field_Marshal Erwin Rommel , whose military genius was respected on both sides of the war , was forced to commit suicide by Hitler when his ties to the plotters were revealed . Kohl said the invitation to appear here , half a century after the Nazi soldiers were driven from the city in defeat , was &quot; a great gesture &quot; and proof of French-German friendship and European cooperation . &quot; Now , we are together , and that is fantastic , &quot; he said after the parade . In an interview with the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper this week , Kohl recalled that &quot; the last time German soldiers walked down the Champs Elysees , they were prisoners , they were spat and sworn at. &quot; As for those who opposed the German presence , Kohl said : &quot; Those who don ' t understand how things have changed can ' t be helped. &quot; But , for many of the old_French Resistance fighters , the memories of the Nazi occupation are still as fresh as yesterday . Four days after seizing Paris on June 14 , 1940 , the German army rolled_down the Champs Elysees , as victorious French armies had for two centuries before ; they goose-stepped down the street every day at noon during the occupation . The Allies arrived on the shores of Normandy on June 6 , 1944 , and Paris was liberated Aug . 23 , 1944 . &quot; I still have in front of my eyes the images of the Germans marching down the Champs Elysees in 1940 , &quot; said Adam Raisky , an elderly man who wore a yellow star on his vest as a reminder of the Jews killed in World_War_II . &quot; In my head , I can still hear the noise of their boots. &quot; M . Laurent , a nurse in the_French Resistance during the war , boycotted the parade this year . &quot; I ' m not going_to watch it , &quot; she said . &quot; It is scandalous . It makes me feel sick. &quot; Times staff writer Marjorie Miller in Bonn contributed to this report .</TEXT>
