   <HEADLINE> CENTERPIECE : OFF THE BEATEN TRACK ; A KEEN EYE IS THE MAIN REQUIREMENT FOR THE RIGORS OF COUNTY HASH RUNS . FOR THESE TREKKERS , FITNESS COMES SECOND TO FRIENDLINESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rocks are small , rounded , and plentiful . Most interesting , they are covered with a disquieting faded brown goo , giving the appearance of a cobblestone street after a long-ago parade involving many horses . This is disquieting because we are treading_on these rocks , running actually , lurching through a culvert on the outskirts of Ojai . &quot; Gosh , this is strange colored rock , &quot; says Colleen Bruns . &quot; I wonder if it ' s just sediment. &quot; This statement is couched as a question , but by the way Bruns delicately sidesteps the more sorely stained rocks , you can tell she ' s not far from an answer . You don ' t have to be a public works employee of the month to know that culverts can house questionable stuff , which is precisely why they ' re the sort of places hashers seek_out . A true hasher views shiggy with relish -- shiggy being a Hash term that refers to any liquid or solid that looks bad , smells worse and impedes forward progress . Sane people avoid such gleck ; drastically reducing the chances of ruining their shoes , not to mention contracting boils , lesions and nausea . But hashers are not sane . Fact is , we could have avoided the culvert entirely . Moments earlier , Bruns and I , along with several other members of the Ventura County Hash_House Harriers , had arrived_at a juncture . Etched by the roadside in white chalk were two words . One said &quot; Eagle , &quot; and was accompanied by an arrow pointing down into the culvert . The other said &quot; Turkey. &quot; That arrow pointed_up the road on which we had been running . To the true adventurer the choice seemed obvious , though not everyone agreed . One suspicious hasher eyed the culvert with disgust . &quot; I ' m not going that way , &quot; he snorted . &quot; God knows what ' s down there. &quot; He may , but we don ' t . Still , Bruns is a good sport about it . &quot; We do get_off the beaten path , &quot; she said , cheerily picking her way around the uglier splotches of goo . To fathom such behavior it is important to understand the Hash_House Harriers . The Hash , as it is known to its disciples , claims to be the largest running organization in the world , and given its members ' erratic habits and dispositions , only a fool would dispute them . According to the &quot; World Hash Handbook and Directory , &quot; there are close to 1 # 100 hash clubs worldwide , allowing_for a sort of global hostel in which a hasher from Antarctica might drop_in on a hasher from Jakarta , whereupon they might immediately procure a rubber chicken and go careening through the jungle . THE HASH The Hash has been called many things , often involving descriptive phrases that would flush the cheeks of a longshoreman . But the modus_operandi of the Hash can be_best grasped by perusing the group ' s written rules . Penned , fittingly enough , 12 years after the Hash came_into existence , the Hash charter gives requisite mention to fitness , then goes_on to laud hashing ' s regenerative powers , namely through &quot; acquiring a good thirst and satisfying it in beer. &quot; This is not to say that swilling beer is part of every Hash run . Soda and water are usually offered , too . Teetotalers are not derided , possibly because it means more beer for the rest of the hashers . The Hash dates_back to times no one cares about , with things coalescing in 1938 when a gentleman named Albert Stephen Gispert , borrowing from the_English children ' s game hares and hounds , started what is largely recognized as the first Hash at a British outpost in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia . Gispert was described by friends as a &quot; short , stout , rubicund fellow with a keen wit. &quot; He was not described as an athlete . Unquestionably some hashers have been bona_fide athletes and have accomplished much , among them Graham Douglas , who trekked the Himalayas numerous times without mishap , then suffered multiple fractures in his wrists and elbows when he fell_through the roof of his home . Truth is , though the Hash does involve bouts of jogging , athleticism is not a prerequisite for membership . &quot; You don ' t have to be a fast runner , you don ' t have to be a slow runner -- we don ' t care , &quot; Ventura County Hash Grand Master John Eckhart told me shortly before the Ventura Hash set_off on a run_on a recent Sunday . &quot; As a matter_of_fact , you don ' t have to be in any physical shape at all. &quot; You do have to be observant . A Hash run proceeds as follows . Hashers follow a trail laid by members dubbed hares . The hares deposit droppings -- paper , flour , chalk marks , foot powder -- to mark the trail . They make the trail as confusing as possible . Trailing runners ardently pursue the trail in floor-of-the-stock-exchange fashion , blowing bugles , tooting whistles and shouting things like &quot; On , on ! &quot; ( meaning they are_on the trail ) or milling about and staring at the ground like drunks who have just stepped off a merry-go-round ( meaning they are lost ) . Distances vary , but generally fall between three and six miles . &quot; We don ' t want anyone dying , &quot; said Eckhart . Not that there aren ' t risks . Clever hares lead their hapless minions to some interesting places . Hashers have dashed through jungles , hair dressing parlors and funerals . A Hash in Texas purportedly trotted through a papal assembly . Another Hash wandered through the Library of Congress . Members of the Ventura County Hash have run_through shopping_malls , sewage treatment plants and across freeways . This has given some members pause , though they are always wise in their choice of options . &quot; I didn ' t want to run_across the freeway , &quot; explained Hash member Wendy Lascher , &quot; but going_around would have meant running another mile or two. &quot; Lascher , today ' s hare , may_not be much for freeway wind sprints , but apparently she has no objection to bacteria . She laid the trail that will send us , among other places , through the questionable culvert . Before the start of the run , Lascher went_over some guidelines . The three new hashers listened intently as she explained the rules of the run , while the 20-some veteran members milled_about paying no attention at all . When Lascher was done , Grand Master Eckhart explained the reason for this indifference . &quot; There are no rules , &quot; he said . &quot; You can cheat all you want. &quot; At the run ' s start , marked by most of the hashers wandering slowly off , I fell_in next to a polite woman wearing a T-shirt that proclaimed &quot; Yee Sook Kung Virgin Run. &quot; &quot; Drop Shorts , &quot; she said , extending a hand . NICKNAMES This was not a command . This is Maxine Dewbury ' s Hash name . All hashers have nicknames , awarded them by their fellow hashers who have hit on some personal quirk , embarrassing circumstance or no good reason at all . Among larger hashes it is not uncommon for two hashers who have run together for months to know each other only as &quot; Scumhead &quot; and &quot; Captain Naked. &quot; Ventura County Hash members are less intent_on maintaining anonymity , though during runs they address each other solely by their Hash tags . Wendy Lascher , an appeals attorney , is &quot; Bananappeal. &quot; Eckhart , who at one time worked as a well driller , is &quot; Deep Thrill Her. &quot; Among the 60-some members of the Ventura County Hash , you ' ll also find &quot; Fertilize Her &quot; ( a landscape_architect ) , &quot; Butter Cup &quot; ( drives a yellow pickup ) , &quot; Mend Strait &quot; ( a seamstress ) , &quot; Major Dad &quot; ( former Marine , current father ) , &quot; Roc Doc &quot; ( a geologist ) and &quot; Bunns &quot; ( Bruns , give_and_take a consonant ) . Those are the names that can appear in print . &quot; Some of the names are so bad that people just use initials , &quot; explained Drop Shorts . &quot; I wasn ' t going_to argue with Drop Shorts . It could have been a lot worse. &quot; Yes , women belong_to the Hash , lots of them actually ; about one-third of the Ventura County Hash are women . Hashing was once an all-male pursuit , and in some places it still is . But for the most part both men and women frequent the Hash , though it isn ' t always easy to tell the difference . A Hash run in Oxnard once required sleep wear . &quot; You don ' t see men wearing women ' s lingerie very often , &quot; said Drop Shorts . Membership in the Ventura County Hash isn ' t exclusive , nor is it expensive . Members pay $ 4 at each run ; the money covers beer , soda , chips and a monthly newsletter that goes_out to each member . Hash clubs have existed in Ojai and Santa Barbara . But the Ventura County Hash is the only Hash in the county that ' s up and running , which may be good news to hikers unaccustomed to the sight of muddy , flour-caked personages bursting from the shrubbery wearing rabbit ears . Actually , the Ventura County Hash is fairly conservative . Runs are family oriented . Wardrobe , for the most part , is conventional and stays_in_place . This is not always the case among other Hash clubs . Drop Shorts has seen her share of derriere during a Hash career that has done stints in Tennessee and Georgia , and she hasn ' t been overly impressed . &quot; Sometimes it ' s OK , &quot; she said . &quot; But , you know , some men ' s bare buns are pretty ugly. &quot; ON THE TRAIL Drop Shorts and I followed the trail which swung up the side of a steep hill and onto the shoulder of Highway 33 in Oak View . Actually , I followed Drop Shorts while she followed the trail ; I had yet to glimpse a single trail marker . I scanned the road ' s shoulder intently while Drop Shorts pointed_out markers : small piles of flour that resembled tidy droppings from an overfed Pillsbury Dough Boy . &quot; Finding the markers takes some getting used to , &quot; she said . &quot; You ' ve just got_to pay attention. &quot; Drop Shorts paused . &quot; Make_sure you don ' t get run_over , &quot; she said . Eventually the trail made a right turn_into the woods , good news for local motorists , but bad news for me because Drop Shorts had run_off . Still there were other hashers around . I stopped for a moment near a curious burst of green foliage . An elderly fellow with the body fat of bamboo ran past . &quot; Hey boot , keep running ! &quot; he shouted . Perhaps feeling badly , he glanced back over his shoulder . &quot; Keep an eye out for poison_oak , &quot; he said . The trail wound through scrub and an occasional stand of oak , then turned_down into a dry river bed . At least I thought it did . I hadn ' t seen any markings for at least 10 minutes . I drew hope , however , from the blasts of a whistle up ahead . Soon I came_upon the whistle blower , a short , dusty woman walking slowly along the trail . I commended her for her wise and selfless use of the whistle to keep others on course . &quot; Actually , I carry it in case I get lost , &quot; she said . A crafty hare , it turns_out , lays numerous false trails along with the real McCoy . Consequently , hashers routinely go astray , sometimes in grand fashion . Once an entire club got lost in the Malay jungle . When word got_back to the wife of one of the hashers , she was unperturbed . &quot; Well it serves the old bastard right , &quot; she said . Fortunately , a_few minutes later I came_upon Lascher . She set the trail ; she would know where we were headed . Maybe so , maybe not . At one point she paused , brow knit , gazing at an arrow chalked in the dust . &quot; You know we set this trail almost five hours ago , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s not always easy to remember what you did. &quot; Hashers are nice people , but they aren ' t much for organization . Lascher learned this on her very first Hash run . Out for a jog on the outskirts of Ojai , she happened on the Ventura Hash in mid-chase and was invited along . Shortly thereafter she came_upon a large orchard . Hashers were scurrying back and forth like schizophrenic bird_dogs . &quot; They were running_up and down trying to find where it was they had put the beer , &quot; said Lascher . We are more fortunate . Several miles into the run , a car is parked by the side of the road . Hashers are cloistered about the car ' s upraised trunk . I am encouraged . Sustenance is my reward at the conclusion of a hot , dusty haul . &quot; Nope , &quot; said Drop Shorts . &quot; If this was the finish , they ' d have the beer chest out. &quot; REST STOP For regular runners , drinking on the fly means snatching a liquid the color of radiator fluid and tossing large portions of it down their front . Hashers are more circumspect in their hydration . We stood_in the shade and made idle chit-chat , casually sipping water , soda or beer . I opted for beer , hoping it might rescue my mouth , which felt_like a sandbox . Still , I had enough experience drinking cold beer under a hot sun to realize the potential drawbacks . A gentleman named P-Nile -- short , of course , for Peter of the Nile -- assuaged my concerns . &quot; Not to worry , &quot; he said . &quot; The liquid part will just come_out as sweat . Kind of concentrates the alcohol. &quot; In pairs and in groups the hashers slowly trotted back onto the trail . The Hash frowns_on competition . More to_the_point , many hashers are in no hurry at all . &quot; The faster runners go_out , get lost and come_back , &quot; explained one hasher , as we walked through a quiet neighborhood . &quot; By the time we get there , they ' ve figured_out which trail is the right one and we ' re spared the work. &quot; She paused , nostrils flaring . &quot; Smell that ? &quot; she said . &quot; Someone burned breakfast . When you move slowly you can really get a sense of a place. &quot; Or establish a ZIP_code . All of this might lead one to conclude that the Hash is composed of loud , slow-moving drunks with a fondness for nudity and convoluted outdoor travel . While this isn ' t entirely off the mark , it isn ' t accurate either . &quot; We ' ve been called a drinking club with a running problem and that ' s part of it , but it ' s not the focus in my opinion , &quot; said Bruns , post-run . &quot; The idea is to get_together with people and go_for a run with a little bit of challenge and a lot of fun . Some of my best friendships have been cultivated through the Hash. &quot; Noxious ? Infantile ? Good , dirty fun ? Your decision . Hashers won ' t explain their behavior , much less defend it , probably because they feel no need to . &quot; Some of us can be a little childish from time to time , &quot; said Bruns . &quot; We don ' t always have to grow up. &quot; Details * WHO : The Ventura County Hash_House Harriers . * WHAT : Fun-loving people who run_off the beaten track , make_noise and drink beer afterward . And sometimes before . And , on occasion , in mid-run . * WHERE : Sorry . That would defeat the purpose . * WHEN : Every three weeks . * WHY : Camaraderie , liquid refreshment , an opportunity to break_in new shoes . * ETC : For more information , call 488-9798 .</TEXT>
