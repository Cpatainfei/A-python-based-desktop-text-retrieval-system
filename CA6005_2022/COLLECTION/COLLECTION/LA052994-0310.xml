   <HEADLINE> DORNAN PUSHES TO DISCHARGE SERVICE MEMBERS WITH AIDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A battle is shaping_up in the House of Representatives over a provision that would immediately discharge from the military anyone infected with the AIDS virus or whose duties are restricted by other medical ailments such_as heart_disease , cancer , asthma or diabetes . The requirement , included as an amendment to the annual defense appropriations_bill , was introduced by Orange County Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) and approved by the House Armed Services Committee this month in what was described as a hurried vote preceded by little discussion . If passed_by the House and Senate , the provision could lead to the immediate discharge of more_than 3 # 500 members of the military -- a small fraction of the nation ' s 1.7-million force -- who are classified as &quot; non-worldwide assignable , &quot; meaning their medical conditions restrict where and how they can be deployed . &quot; How can we afford to retain those who cannot perform all military duties ? &quot; said Dornan , a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a staunch conservative . He contended that in these times of military downsizing , every soldier and sailor must be fully useful . The amendment is a long way from becoming law , and formidable opposition to it is already taking_shape . The Pentagon itself is against it , contending that the number of chronically ill_service members with restricted assignments is so small that it poses no threat to military readiness . Others on record opposing Dornan ' s plan are the AIDS Action Council , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American Heart Assn . and the American Cancer Society . Rep . Jane Harman ( D-Marina del Rey ) is prepared to introduce after the Memorial_Day recess language that would undercut the Dornan amendment , although it would stop short of killing it outright . &quot; They may have served ably and may still be fit to serve , and putting them in a desk job where they can use their training seems more appropriate than forcing them out , &quot; said Harman , also an Armed Services Committee_member . The current practice of finding appropriate jobs for the military ' s chronically ill was instituted under President Ronald Reagan , when the advent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome forced the military to forge a policy on what to do with infected service members . It evolved to include other chronically ill members as well , officials said . Dornan ' s amendment would require discharge of those service members , unless the condition was sustained in the line_of_duty or the service member possesses a skill considered of_value to the military . Dornan contends that restricted assignments are unwise in an era of dwindling defense resources in which every member of the ranks should be militarily ready . Dornan estimates that immediate discharge would save the military about $ 3.5 million a year in hospital costs . He also said it would relieve healthy service members of the burden of taking assignments that cannot be filled by those with medical ailments . &quot; By sticking a dirty needle in his arm , he has broken the law , &quot; Dornan said , arguing that most service members who have tested positive for the AIDS virus are drug_users . &quot; It ' s unfair to keep a person in who can ' t go_into a combat unit. &quot; Critics said the amendment is an attempt to discriminate against the chronically ill , particularly those infected with the AIDS virus , and note that it was brought by a congressman who for years has been harshly critical of gays . About 40 % of service members restricted by medical conditions are HIV-positive . &quot; It ' s certainly pure Dornan , someone so obsessed with hatred of gay people he will run_roughshod over every principle of fairness . . . even when it means attacking people who are serving their country and who the military itself regards_as perfectly fit to serve , &quot; said Evan Wolfson , senior staff lawyer at Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund , a New York-based gay-rights group . &quot; The general policy set_forth in the Americans With Disabilities Act is that people who can do the job should not be penalized . . . . that ' s a better policy. &quot; Harman expressed surprise that the idea progressed this far , saying the House Armed Services Committee passed it on a harried May 5 vote . Committee_members were being summoned to the House floor for roll_call votes that day and were distracted when they approved Dornan ' s plan by a voice vote that Harman , also a committee_member , said she believes to have been ill-considered . &quot; There was very little conversation , &quot; Harman said . &quot; I think they did not know what they were voting on. &quot; Harman is preparing to introduce a counter amendment that would undercut Dornan ' s ; the Harman language would give the Pentagon leeway to do what it does now -- avoid discharge entirely by concluding that restricted service members pose no threat to the military ' s ability to carry_out its mission . Some civil_rights groups expressed worry that Harman ' s amendment does not go_far enough and say that they would like to see any reference_to discharge stricken . But House observers said the odds of killing the language outright are slim .</TEXT>
