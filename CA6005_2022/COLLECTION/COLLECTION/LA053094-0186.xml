   <HEADLINE> OFFSPRING : FAVORITE_SON IN PUNK WORLD ; POP_MUSIC : IT WAS JUST ANOTHER PUNK BAND -- UNTIL A RARE BREAK FROM THE SONG ' COME OUT AND PLAY ' GOT THE BAND ' S MOTOR RUNNING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As 1994 began , the Offspring was just another obscure punk band hoping it could make_it to the next gig without its bus breaking_down . The motor would seize up_on the road to Bakersfield . The transmission would give_out en route to Arizona . When they finally got the engine rebuilt , the four band members drove across country on a winter tour , shivering all_the way because they couldn ' t get the heater to work . &quot; It was awful , but it would cost too_much to fix it , &quot; recalled drummer Ron Welty , 23 . &quot; We were punk about it. &quot; With its school_bus body still bearing the green paint job and Holiday Inn logo from its previous incarnation as a hotel shuttle , the Offspring ' s chariot now sits ready in a cul-de-sac in a peaceful Orange County subdivision . This time it has to be in good working order : Suddenly , the Offspring appears to be going places . * In April , KROQ , the alternative-rock station , put the band ' s song &quot; Come Out and Play &quot; into regular rotation , playing it every three or four hours . It ' s a rare break for a punk band on a small , independent label , but the song is a rare combination of punk rawness and pop savvy -- an insinuating , deftly constructed track that grabs a listener ' s interest and holds it with a succession of catchy , diverse musical hooks . The Offspring ' s fortunes had been_on the rise even before &quot; Come Out and Play &quot; started generating numerous request calls from KROQ listeners . While band members Welty , Bryan Holland , Greg Kriesel and Kevin Wasserman were trying to stay warm on their bus last winter , sales of their 1992 release , &quot; Ignition , &quot; were heating_up . The Offspring ' s label , Epitaph Records , had managed to place several songs from the album with producers who make action videos for fans of surfing , snowboarding and skateboarding . The payoff was almost immediate . According to Holland , the band ' s singer and songwriter , in a matter of four months sales shot from 16 # 000 to 46 # 000 -- an impressive total for an independent punk release . When &quot; Smash , &quot; the Offspring ' s third album , came_out in mid-April , there was a substantial corps of new fans waiting for it . Andy Kaulkin , Epitaph ' s marketing director , says 75 # 000 copies have been shipped to stores . Now the label , which has been hailed for its ability to top the 100 # 000 sales mark with hard-core faves Bad Religion and Pennywise , smells the possibility of a hit that could cross over to the much larger alternative crowd ( as always , MTV will be the final arbiter of that ) . The Offspring ' s members don ' t seem to be letting any of this go_to their heads . Sitting around a table in the pleasant , walled-in back yard of the home where bassist Kriesel grew_up , they came_off as a relaxed , down-to-earth , good-natured bunch who are eager to see what happens next , but have no great hankering for rock stardom . After playing in obscurity for most of their 10-year existence , the Offspring , whose members range_in age from 23 to 31 , see a touch of absurdity in their suddenly unfolding success . Wasserman was nonplussed after Holland finished quoting the band ' s KROQ airplay statistics : &quot; A tinny little punk band from OC &quot; ? * The band began in 1984 , inspired by such local precursors as the Adolescents , Agent_Orange and T.S.O.L. By 1992 , Holland had learned to write catchy , sing-along chorus melodies for songs that typically offer acerbic but alert commentaries on everything from geopolitics to relationship pitfalls to the difficulty of remaining an individual in a world that rewards conformism . With &quot; Smash , &quot; the Offspring has come_into its own , crafting a full album of solid songs . Many of the tracks feature not just one good musical hook , but several . Holland , who clones viruses in his parallel life as a Ph.D candidate at USC , fronts the band with an interesting voice , part reedy and part chesty , that calls to mind a less bleating Ozzy Osbourne . &quot; It ' s hard to do both , &quot; Holland said of possible conflicts between punk_rock and microbiology . &quot; If it comes_down to it , I ' m going_to quit school , because I don ' t want to pass_up what ' s happening now. &quot; * The Offspring is_on the bill for the KROQ &quot; Weenie_Roast , &quot; June 11 at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre .</TEXT>
