   <HEADLINE> THEY TOLD THE SECRETS OF AMERICA ' S BEDROOMS ; LIFESTYLES : THEY COULDN ' T GET FEDERAL FUNDING , BUT WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THEIR STUDY , THESE THREE RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN SEX IS A NATIONAL ISSUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How do you persuade the U.S._government to fund a huge study about sex ? Easy , thought Edward O . Laumann , Robert T . Michael and John H . Gagnon -- senior scholars in their respective fields of social_organization , economics and social_psychology . You couch your request for government funds behind an innocuous heading -- perhaps a neat little term of art like &quot; Social and Behavioral Aspects of Health and Fertility-Related Behavior. &quot; &quot; I still chortle over that one , &quot; said Laumann , who holds the imposing title of George Herbert Mead Distinguished Service Professor of Sociology at the University of Chicago . But certain segments of official Washington were less amused . &quot; It got noticed , &quot; said Gagnon , a professor of sociology and psychology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook . Sex is generally good for a political hurricane , and the prospect of a comprehensive survey of this most private of pastimes proved to be no exception . All of a sudden , the three mild-mannered academics began hearing rumors that they were working_on a pornographic questionnaire . One day , it all boiled_over on the floor of Senate , whose members were debating funding for the project . Gagnon heard Sen . Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) rail &quot; that my elevator didn ' t go all_the way to the top. &quot; Gagnon , 62 , decided not to be offended ; he considered the remark &quot; an honorific. &quot; With the publication last week of &quot; Sex in America &quot; ( Little , Brown and Co. ; New York Times science writer Gina Kolata is listed as a co-author ) , the three researchers have found themselves back in the fray . Headlines are touting their finding that most Americans lead very tame sex lives , and radio talk_show hosts are wondering what rocks the researchers had to crawl under to find married people who say they have better sex -- and more often -- than their unmarried friends and neighbors . A denser , more academic version of the trio ' s conclusions , titled &quot; The Social_Organizations of Sexuality , &quot; will be published next week by the University of Chicago Press . Rebuffed in their search for federal funds , Laumann , Michael and Gagnon financed their &quot; National Sex Survey of Adults , &quot; which forms the basis for both books , through grants from eight private_foundations . The three social_scientists devised a questionnaire and deployed a small army of professional pollsters to conduct in-person interviews with 3 # 423 demographically diverse Americans , ages 18 to 59 . The 1992 study was conducted under the aegis of the University of Chicago ' s National Opinion Research_Center . In telephone_interviews , Laumann , Michael and Gagnon explained that they proposed a vast , scientifically accurate survey of sexual practices in this country in 1987 , in an attempt to demystify the AIDS epidemic . To understand the disease as it began exploding into the culture , they reasoned , scientists needed a kind of sexual behavior base line -- a broad sample that simply looked_at habits and practices . &quot; There ' s an awful lot of policy and decision-making based around these private activities , &quot; said Michael , a 52-year-old economist with &quot; expertise and a keen interest &quot; in family choice issues . But in a field laced with prurience and tinged with ambivalence , he said , &quot; It seems we are supposed to make these decisions in total ignorance . There just aren ' t any other topics that I can think_of where we care so_much , get bombarded so heavily -- and know so little. &quot; Even the most conservative factions of Washington , Michael said , would not place a knowledge ban on any other issue . &quot; Sewer_systems we ( can ) know about . But not sex. &quot; Many assumptions about the intimate lives of ordinary Americans were based on outmoded and unscientific studies , the trio said . Pioneer sex researcher Alfred Kinsey , Laumann said , based his findings from the 1940s on non-random , largely self-selected samples , &quot; whoever he happened to talk to and could recruit. &quot; William Masters and Virginia Johnson undertook clinical studies that also failed to examine a general population , they said . And Laumann , for one , dismissed the best-selling &quot; reports &quot; of author Shere Hite as &quot; junk statistics. &quot; By contrast , their own research was reviewed by &quot; a pile of graduate_students , &quot; including &quot; nuns and ordained priests , &quot; said Laumann , 56 . The material was examined dispassionately , they insisted , with neither an agenda nor a set of preconceptions . What was most important about their findings , Gagnon said , was &quot; not any individual numbers , but the collective portrait -- a mirror of a society in which sexuality turns_out to be extraordinarily conventional. &quot; Chandelier-swinging , partner-switching and other raucous practices may occupy an enormous space in America ' s fantasy_life , &quot; but in everyday life , sexuality is really a rather modest pleasure , &quot; he said . For better or for worse , Gagnon added , &quot; it ' s not ' Pretty Woman. ' &quot; But the almost boring quality of their results does not detract from the sensitivity of their subject_matter . Scholars of lesser stature might have shied_away_from such a public sex study -- hardly_a sure-sell in the increasingly conservative environment of many universities . &quot; It was not a way to get tenure , &quot; said Michael , who , as the Eliakim Hastings Moore Distinguished Service Professor and dean of the Irving B . Harris Graduate_School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago , was unconcerned by such matters , Of the three researchers , only Gagnon had conducted earlier studies on sexuality . He had contributed to three other books about sex , focusing_on such topics as sex offenses , sexuality in adolescence and the roles of families , communities and television in sex education . But despite Gagnon ' s earlier research , the new study gave him pause . &quot; I ' m a man , and I ' m a victim of all that men believe , desire and fantasize about , &quot; he said . &quot; I think I always knew that sexual life was governed by the same processes that all other life was governed by . But like everyone else in the culture , I ' d like magic . &quot; I looked_at the numbers &quot; -- figures that showed that most American women have two sexual partners in life and most U.S. men have six -- &quot; and I thought , ' Can it be this low ? ' &quot; Gagnon said . For Michael , the eight-year odyssey of the National Adult Sex Survey was only a beginning of research he hopes to continue . &quot; It ' s like finding a whole new planet , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' ve uncovered a good bit . But almost on every topic we found 10 more things we would like to know. &quot; Laumann said he was hopeful that the study might encourage greater cross-disciplinary exploration of issues pertaining to sex and gender . At the University of Chicago , he said he has begun leading monthly workshops about sex that attract researchers from fields ranging from economics to endocrinology . But Laumann said his research team was still reeling from its &quot; Kafka-esque &quot; collision with the federal bureaucracy -- including a run-in with something called the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1942 . Years of studying the inner workings of government systems left him unprepared for this firsthand encounter , Laumann said . &quot; Somehow , &quot; he said , &quot; I never dreamed I would be using the information I had gathered about official Washington to fend_off this ( funding ) firestorm we provoked. &quot; But at least these three were left with their senses_of_humor intact . Of course , they said , they are planning to send an autographed copy of &quot; Sex in America &quot; to Capitol_Hill -- to the attention of Sen . Helms .</TEXT>
