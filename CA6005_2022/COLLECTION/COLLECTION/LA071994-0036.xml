   <TEXT> Arthur Dong ' s informative , consciousness-raising &quot; Coming Out Under Fire &quot; ( at the Nuart Thursday through July 27 ) documents the experiences of nine gay and lesbian World_War_II veterans amid a plethora of archival footage and framed within the context of the recent and ongoing debate over gays in the military . All the men and women state that they had no problems getting_along_with straights , many of whom assumed their sexual orientation and were not upset by it , but that they lived_in constant fear of being denounced and subjected_to the Draconian anti-gay regulations established early in the war . Most left with well-earned honorable discharges , but several were not so fortunate , bearing scars from those experiences to this day . Yet if a gay male didn ' t lie to get_into the service , the alternative was to be sent home bearing the stigma of &quot; sexual pervert. &quot; Dong , who based his film on Allan Berube ' s 1990 book of the same name , makes clear that World_War_II was the first time gays and lesbians were brought_together in large_numbers ; this breaking_down of isolation laid the foundation for the eventual gay_liberation_movement . Information : ( 310 ) 478-6379 . To Austin for Music : In a thoroughly captivating , laid-back way Tara Veneruso ' s &quot; Janis Joplin Slept Here &quot; ( presented Thursday by EZTV at RESOLUTION Gallery , 6518 Hollywood Blvd. ) chronicles the last three decades or so in the amazingly vibrant , varied and enduring music scene of Austin , Tex . In the course of interviewing , in a mere two hours , 74 musicians , artists ' managers , club owners , DJs , critics and even a simpatico retired cop , Veneruso reminds us of what a major music capital Austin has long been . &quot; Janis Joplin Slept Here &quot; makes you wish you had been to local landmark clubs , past and present , where you could enjoy everyone from Muddy Waters , the Sex Pistols , Johnny Winter , Bruce Springsteen ( &quot; when he was just a long name &quot; ) , Stevie Ray Vaughn to Joplin herself -- not to mention scores more . Information : ( 213 ) 466-6232 . Malcolm X Documentary : &quot; Brother Minister : The Assassination of Malcolm X &quot; ( at the Sunset 5 at noon only for one week starting Friday ) is a powder_keg of a documentary directed by Jack Baxter , a former private_investigator , who co-produced and co-wrote the film with Jefri Aalmuhammed , a Black Muslim who was a consultant on Spike Lee ' s &quot; Malcolm X. &quot; In a series of interviews with Malcolm X ' s colleagues , coupled with much potent and often rare archival materials , the filmmakers raise many unanswered questions surrounding the assassination of Malcolm X in February , 1965 , in Harlem ' s Audubon Ballroom . &quot; Brother Minister &quot; brings considerable clarity to an exceedingly complex , highly charged event , pointing a lot of fingers along the way and suggesting that the death of the ever-evolving Malcolm was a tragic loss to the ranks of African American leaders . At the very least , the film makes a strong case for a congressional investigation into Malcolm ' s assassination . Information : ( 213 ) 848-3500 . Yukon Gold_Rush : &quot; The Trail of ' 98 &quot; ( at the Silent Movie Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. ) is short on plot and characterization but is a knockout 1928 spectacle , tracing with a documentary-like fidelity a grueling journey to the Klondike Gold_Rush in the Yukon . Among those who endure blizzards , raging rivers , an avalanche and a climactic Dawson saloon fire are a stalwart Ralph Forbes , a demure Dolores Del Rio and a villainous Harry Carey . Alas , it takes 55 minutes for them just to get_to Dawson , and not even skilled director Clarence Brown can make these lightly sketched characters come_alive until the final two reels . What makes &quot; The Trail of ' 98 &quot; worth seeing is the meticulously detailed authenticity of its production design , which includes even pre-earthquake footage of San Francisco ' s original Palace Hotel . Harry Carey Jr . will appear in_person , to autograph his &quot; Company of Heroes : My Life in the John Ford Stock Company. &quot; Information : ( 213 ) 653-2389 .</TEXT>
