   <HEADLINE> BURUNDI TEETERS BETWEEN PEACE , RENEWED KILLING ; AFRICA : UNLIKE IN NEARBY RWANDA , THE TUTSI MINORITY CONTROLS THE ARMY . PEOPLE SAY THAT IS WHAT HAS SAVED THEM FROM A NEW ROUND OF SLAUGHTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All but forgotten by the world , this nation hangs_in nerve-racking suspension , balanced between forces that dare pray for conciliation and those who would turn this troubled land into another Rwanda . The slightest misstep could tip the balance . And after a year in which Burundi witnessed its first free elections , the murder of two of its presidents and a massacre that claimed as_many as 100 # 000 lives , the specter of uncontrolled slaughter in a neighboring land is very real , very chilling . &quot; Rwanda is terrifying and terrible , &quot; said Venerand Bakevyumusaya , Burundi ' s minister of labor . &quot; One would think it would have taught us to avoid that kind of madness , but there is a very real danger that what happened there could happen here . The calm you see here now is not a reassuring calm. &quot; In colonial times , the two countries were governed first by Germany , then Belgium , as part of a single territory known as Ruanda-Urundi . As in Rwanda , the Tutsis here are a minority , making_up 15 % of Burundi ' s 6 million people . But unlike in Rwanda , the Tutsis still control the army , and that , people here say , is what has spared them from genocide . The deep mistrust between the Tutsis and Hutus in Burundi , combined with fears that chaos in Rwanda could inflame extremists on both sides here , has filled this ramshackle capital with anxiety and a well-founded xenophobia . The countdown is under way , but no one knows if it is toward war or peace . Expatriates have started talking in code -- using the word trees for the tall Tutsis and bushes for the shorter Hutus -- to protect conversations from eavesdroppers . The U.S. Embassy , like other foreign_missions , has sent dependents home and cut_back to a skeleton staff of six officers . Business has slowed . For months , there have been no tourists heading for the game parks or the source of the Nile_River . The neighborhoods where Tutsis and Hutus once lived side_by_side and often intermarried have become largely segregated -- voluntarily -- after violent clashes in Bujumbura over the winter and into the spring . Victims hacked to death were almost always Tutsis ; those killed by bullets were Hutus . &quot; It is a very uneasy feeling , &quot; said a Tutsi businessman , &quot; because you pass someone on the street and he smiles at you . But you wonder if , in his heart , he has thoughts of killing you. &quot; Sadly , only last June , Burundi was being hailed as a model of democratic reform in Africa . Its president , Col . Pierre Buyoya , a Tutsi , was soundly defeated by the civilian Hutu candidate , Melchior Ndadaye , in the country ' s first free elections . And , much to everyone ' s surprise , Buyoya agreed to honor the results . Ndadaye pledged a new era in human_rights . Four months later , in October , Ndadaye was spirited away one night to an army camp where he was beaten , stabbed and strangled . The vice_president and several other senior government officials were also killed . In a response that drew little attention in the world , Hutu mobs throughout the countryside hunted_down and killed as_many as 100 # 000 Tutsis . The Hutus called the massacre a preemptive strike . Five days after the assassination , Foreign Minister Sylvestre Ntibantunganya , a Hutu and the de_facto head of government , summoned Bujumbura ' s tiny diplomatic corps , which includes North_Korea and Russia as a holdover from Cold_War days . The diplomats pleaded with Ntibantunganya -- whose wife had been killed in the blood-letting and who himself had barely managed to escape with his life -- to denounce the killings and to act to end the bloodshed . &quot; Ntibantunganya was unmoved , &quot; said an envoy at the meeting . He told the diplomats that they were asking_for something he could not do . Pope John Paul II ' s representative at the meeting wept . The assassination apparently convinced Hutu extremists that even though they had won political power via elections -- including 80 % of the seats in Parliament and 60 % of the Cabinet posts -- real power would not be theirs until they controlled the guns . In clandestine fashion , they began arming civilians with South_African weapons slipped into the country from Rwanda via Zaire . The shipments gave_rise to a rebel army , created , ironically enough , by a government wanting to protect itself from its own institutions . Hundreds of Tutsis took_to the streets in Bujumbura on April 6 to dance and march in celebration when the Hutu presidents of Burundi and Rwanda -- Cyprian Ntaryamira and Juvenal Habyarimana , respectively -- were killed in Kigali . The crash of their plane , which had been hit by a rocket , unleashed an orgy of massacres in Rwanda . To date , aid workers estimate the blood-letting has claimed 200 # 000 to 500 # 000 lives . In Bujumbura , Ntibantunganya , apparently having learned some lessons from the October massacres , went_on national television within hours of the crash . Flanked by the minister of defense and army chief_of_staff , he urged his countrymen to stay calm . Their presence signaled that the army and government had reached some sort of understanding . Lamb was recently on assignment in Burundi .</TEXT>
