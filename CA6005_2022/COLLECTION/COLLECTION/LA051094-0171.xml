   <HEADLINE> TRANSIENT CONVICTED IN COUNTY-USC RAMPAGE ; CRIME : DAMASCIO TORRES IS FOUND GUILTY OF WOUNDING THREE DOCTORS AND TAKING TWO EMPLOYEES HOSTAGE . HE ADMITTED THE FEBRUARY , 1993 , ATTACK DURING TESTIMONY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a five-day trial during which he recounted his armed attack on an emergency_room at Los Angeles County-USC Medical_Center , a Skid_Row loner was convicted Monday of wounding three doctors in the rampage and taking two other employees hostage . A Superior_Court jury deliberated a little more_than four hours before reaching the verdicts against Damascio Ybarra Torres , 41 . Torres admitted the attack during his testimony , saying he went_to the hospital with two handguns , a rifle and a knife because he believed that physicians there had injected him with the virus that causes AIDS , then repeatedly referred him to a mental_health unit when he returned seeking treatment for resulting physical illnesses . The February , 1993 , shooting raised concerns about security at often-crowded , government-run medical_centers , where impatient or unbalanced patients sometimes become violent . After the rampage , security measures were tightened at County-USC , which is one of the busiest medical facilities in the nation . On Monday , Torres sat silently next to his lawyer as a court clerk read the verdicts against him -- guilty of three counts of attempted murder with intent to do great bodily harm , two counts of felony imprisonment and using guns in committing the crimes . Torres faces three life sentences on the attempted murder_charges alone at his June 1 sentencing . The jury agreed with a defense expert who testified that Torres suffers from persecution delusions but concluded that he was rational enough to methodically plan and execute his crime , said a juror who talked to reporters outside the courtroom and who asked that her name not be made public . Before his trial began , Torres had withdrawn his plea of innocent by reason of insanity against the advice of his lawyer , Deputy Public_Defender Joan Croker . He also insisted on testifying on_his_own behalf , Croker said . After the verdicts , Croker told reporters that she had hoped the jury would find Torres guilty of lesser charges , especially after they saw &quot; how delusional he was &quot; during his testimony . &quot; He believed he was used in an experiment related to AIDS in 1982 , &quot; Croker said . &quot; He said he went_to the hospital to make a statement. &quot; His testimony , however , coupled with a 34-point plan Torres wrote the night before the rampage indicating how he would carry_out the attack , helped convince the jury that he was lucid enough to be held responsible_for his actions , Deputy Dist . Atty . Anne Ingalls said . Ingalls said she drew that conclusion from private discussions she had with jurors after they were dismissed . Critically injured in the attack at the hospital were Dr. Richard May , Dr. Glen Rogers and Dr. Paul Kaszubowski . Rogers testified that he had treated Torres twice in the year before the rampage . May and Kaszubowski have been unable to return to work as a result of their injuries . The two hostages , a physician and a receptionist , were released unhurt after Torres surrendered to a SWAT team after holding officers at_bay for several hours . One of the hostages , Dr. Anne Tournay , testified that before she was taken prisoner she heard a man yelling : &quot; I don ' t want nurses . I want doctors . I want white coats. &quot; Later , when police searched Torres ' room at a Downtown transients ' hotel , they found the written plan for the attack .</TEXT>
