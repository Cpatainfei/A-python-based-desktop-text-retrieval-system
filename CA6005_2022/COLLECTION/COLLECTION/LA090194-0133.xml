   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OXNARD ; A SMALL DOG CAUSES LARGE FREEWAY TIE-UP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even though he lacks the nine lives of his feline counterparts , a 20-pound runaway dog chose to defy the fates Wednesday -- and the patience of motorists on the Ventura Freeway . &quot; There was absolutely no reason why he wasn ' t killed over a_hundred times on the freeway , &quot; said Kathy Jenks , director of the Ventura County Animal Regulation Department . The pooch ' s big adventure began about 1:45 p.m. when the black cocker_spaniel mix started trotting against traffic in the freeway ' s northbound lanes at Rose Avenue in Oxnard . With the California Highway Patrol in pursuit , the dog veered from startled motorists and jogged all_the way up_to the Vineyard Avenue off-ramp before returning to the freeway , CHP Officer T.J. McAllister said . The dog then trotted another three-quarters of a mile to the Ventura Road off-ramp , where he exited for good , McAllister said . Traffic had snarled during the chase that at its peak , involved five sheriff ' s cruisers , an Oxnard police_car , two CHP units , a motorcycle officer and some civilian motorists , Jenks said . Not until about 40 minutes later , after Animal Control Officer Mike Stewart grabbed the dog as it darted from under a truck on Vineyard Avenue , did things return to normal , Jenks said . But alarmed by the commotion , the dog gave Stewart several nips on his hands . The dog will be quarantined for 10 days to ensure that he has nothing contagious , Jenks said . She said the dog_did not wear an identification tag . GREG RIPPEE</TEXT>
