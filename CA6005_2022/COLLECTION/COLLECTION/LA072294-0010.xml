   <HEADLINE> BUT IS THE WORLD EQUAL TO THIS CATASTROPHE ? ; RWANDA : HOW WASHINGTON CAN BEST HELP_OUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rwanda is perhaps only the latest African apocalypse , but if the pattern of horror seems familiar , the scale of the suffering is extreme even by Third_World standards . War and ethnic slaughter have killed as_many as 700 # 000 and forced more_than double that number to flee . Now , a deadly cholera epidemic sweeps the overflowing refugee camps in neighboring Zaire , threatening to bring the death toll to more_than 1 million . Misery , on this unfathomable scale , begs for international intervention immediately . President Clinton ordered Washington on Thursday to respond &quot; quickly &quot; with &quot; a practical plan_of_action , &quot; while pledging an additional $ 35 million in aid beyond $ 41.4 million approved earlier . That humanitarian plan should provide the planes , portable hospitals , medical supplies , food , trucks and people -- but not combat troops or police -- needed to save lives on a scale heretofore unknown even in Ethiopia and Somalia . Fortunately , Rwanda politically looks_to be no Somalia . The brutal attacks on Americans in Mogadishu and the lack of a quick-fix solution in Somalia soured much of the West on helping in similar crises . THE FRENCH CONNECTION : There has been no rush to intervene in Rwanda ' s civil_war between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority in spite of the genocide . Only France , which has had a checkered history at best in Africa , responded to Rwanda ' s screams , with help from troops from Senegal and Ghana . Give Paris some credit , however . The 2 # 500 French troops have slowed the exodus in their area , though they cannot staunch the human hemorrhaging . They need reinforcements to help stop the crisis that began after a suspicious April 6 plane crash killed Juvenal Habyarimana , the first Hutu president of Rwanda . In response to that plane crash , Hutus slaughtered as_many as 500 # 000 Tutsis -- the tall , educated minority so favored by the Belgian Colonial rulers . Before independence , the Tutsis , though barely 15 % of the population , dominated the short Hutus , who tended to be farmers and peasants . That blood rivalry has been exacerbated by the most recent massacres . In this conflict , the Tutsi rebels have prevailed , and their Rwandan Patriotic Front leaders were sworn_in on Tuesday . In victory , the new government includes two Hutu leaders , a figurehead president and a prime_minister . But the symbolic inclusion of a_few Hutus and the Tutsi promise of no reprisals has not reassured those many Hutus who fear revenge . Their fears have been stirred_up by some ousted Hutu officials , who are forcing their ethnic brethren to flee . But some of these naysayers are the same evil Hutus who ordered the slaughter of Tutsis . Given the deadly conditions of the refugee camps , their latest campaign of rejectionism -- nearsighted and self-serving -- could have the effect of sending more innocent Hutus to their slaughter . THE U.S. CONNECTION : Cholera stalks the refugee camps in Goma , Zaire . The disease is relatively easy to treat if clean water , fluids and basic supplies are available . Sadly , that is not the case in the refugee camps : Relief workers cannot handle the overwhelming demand for emergency provisions unless the small airport is expanded . Additional air-traffic controllers and cargo handlers are also desperately needed to allow more cargo planes to land . If there is any hope for Rwanda , and Africa , Good_Samaritans from around the world must send help to stop the exodus and dying and allow rebuilding . Americans , understandably snakebitten by Somalia , do not want to get bogged down in a conflict that has nothing to do with this country , but our prosperity and heritage require the United States to respond humanely , and immediately . That doesn ' t mean combat troops , or even military_police ; but it does mean just about everything else .</TEXT>
