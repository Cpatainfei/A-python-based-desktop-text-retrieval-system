   <HEADLINE> HONG KONG AIRPORT SPREADS WINGS DESPITE CHINA ' S OFFICIAL RESISTANCE ; ASIA : PLANES MUST LAND AND TAKE OFF OVER A FOREST OF APARTMENT_BUILDINGS , AN APPROACH SO HAZARDOUS THAT PILOTS MUST QUALIFY FOR A SPECIAL ENDORSEMENT ON THEIR LICENSES . BUT ALL THIS WILL SOON CHANGE FOR THE BETTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Many of the 22 million passengers who land at Kai Tak International Airport every year feel as if they ' ve just auditioned for the U.S. Air_Force Thunderbirds aerobatic team . Incoming planes flying the colors of more_than 50 international airlines take_aim at Checkerboard Hill , a steep outcropping painted red and white to aid navigation into this British island colony . With the low peak in_sight , pilots make a gut-wrenching right turn seconds before touchdown on Kai Tak ' s short runway . On Nov . 3 an incoming China Airlines jumbo jet carrying 296 passengers skidded off the rain-slick runway and landed in Hong Kong Harbor . Twenty-three people were reported injured . It was the worst accident at the airport since a Chinese plane went_off the runway in 1988 , killing six . The worst accident in Kai Tak ' s history occurred in 1967 , when a Thai airliner plunged into the harbor , killing 24 people . Intensifying the airport ' s danger , planes must land and take_off directly over a forest of high-rise apartment_buildings , one of the most densely populated square_miles on Earth . In the flight_path live more_than 340 # 000 people who can look_out their apartment and automobile windows into the cabins of passing airliners . So hazardous is the approach into Kai Tak that pilots must qualify for a special endorsement on their licenses . But all this is about to change . Kai Tak , now the third-busiest cargo airport and fourth-busiest passenger airport in the world , will close_in four years . Despite a diplomatic standoff with Beijing , Hong Kong is moving ahead with plans to build a new airport , part of a $ 21-billion development program . The plan ' s ultimate purpose is to ensure that Hong Kong remains Asia ' s No . 1 financial_center and southern China ' s main port . An army of construction workers already is filling_in the South_China_Sea immediately off Lantau Island , building a 3 # 000-acre platform for the new Chek Lap Kok Airport , which is expected to open in 1997 . A high-speed railroad and expressway on the world ' s longest suspension_bridge will link the new airport with Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island . &quot; The world is queuing_up to lend us money , &quot; said Paul Brown , an official of the Hong Kong Airport Core Program . &quot; Everyone wants a piece of the action. &quot; Everyone , that is , but China , which will gain sovereignty over the colony in 1997 . So far , authorities in Beijing have balked at helping finance the new airport and nine other development projects in Hong Kong . The projects include freeways , rail and subway lines , a new town and reclaimed land the size of 700 football_fields , on which housing for 90 # 000 people would be built . The impasse has left the development scheme in a twilight zone . But work is proceeding on projects that don ' t need China ' s approval . They include the airport platform and the 4 # 518-foot-long Tsing Ma suspension_bridge , which will be 318 feet longer than San Francisco ' s Golden Gate Bridge , now the world ' s longest . Two-thirds of all_the dredges in the world , including half of the largest ones , have assembled in the waters off Hong Kong to start the massive landfill operation . But China says the construction is too grandiose and will erode the wealthy colony ' s financial reserves . Chinese officials maintain that Hong Kong ' s riches should be left intact until after 1997 . Hong Kong authorities reject these arguments , citing &quot; greed and democracy factors &quot; as the reasons Beijing has withheld support for such projects as a new tunnel under the city ' s harbor and a new downtown terminal for the airport rail_line . &quot; The Chinese see private investment as loans , and they don ' t want the debt , &quot; Paul Brown said . &quot; We suspect the Chinese have plans to get their hands deep in the cash register. &quot; Beyond that , Hong Kong authorities say , the Chinese are furious about the continued efforts of the colony ' s popular and outspoken governor , Chris Patten , to increase the legislature ' s democratic base before 1997 . Chinese-language newspapers issue almost daily denunciations of Patten , his plans and his government . &quot; Officially the Chinese deny linkage , &quot; said Mark Pinkstone , a spokesman for the Hong Kong government . &quot; But every time we talk_about giving Hong Kong more democracy , the Chinese find an excuse to muck_up the airport negotiations. &quot; Hong Kong officials say that China ' s reluctance to help pay_for the airport construction projects won ' t jeopardize their completion . &quot; All of the $ 21 billion will be spent by 1997 , when the first runway at Chek Lap Lok opens , &quot; Brown said . &quot; But because of the Chinese impediments , the work , using private capital , is going_to be much more costly. &quot; Difficulties with Chinese politicians , however , aren ' t Hong Kong ' s only problem . The colony faces competition from a recently opened airport just across the Chinese border in Shenzhen and from new airports being built_in the nearby Portuguese colony of Macau , in Osaka , Japan , and near Seoul , South_Korea . Osaka ' s $ 14-billion Kansai International Airport , plagued by construction delays because the man-made island on which it is built keeps sinking into Osaka Bay , is finally scheduled to open next year . The $ 13-billion New Seoul Metropolitan Airport on Cheju Island already is being touted as the largest airport in Asia , years before it begins operation toward the end of the decade . Singapore , long championed as Asia ' s most efficient gateway , plans a third runway and two more passenger terminals at its ultramodern Changi International Airport . None of these challenges surprises Brown or Henry Townsend , chief_executive_officer of Hong Kong ' s provisional Airport Authority . Noting that the Asia-Pacific region will account_for 40 % of international passenger traffic by 2000 , Townsend said Hong Kong will remain a major gateway for China after 1997 . He predicts that travelers using Chek Lap Kok Airport will increase 3.5 % annually between 1997 and 2010 . &quot; Macau , Osaka , Seoul -- everyone -- is discovering that you can build airports on islands , &quot; Brown said . &quot; It ' s a little like the Hula-Hoop . Once you understand how to do_it , you can build an airport anywhere. &quot;</TEXT>
