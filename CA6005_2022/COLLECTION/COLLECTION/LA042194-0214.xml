   <TEXT> Health_care for the needy in northwest Pasadena is a step closer , now that the city has acquired a building for a proposed community health center . The next hurdle is finding funding for treatment . &quot; It ' s going_to bring critical services for a population that ' s been underserved , &quot; said Jacqueline Stiff , the city ' s health officer . She said the city will seek grants from the federal_government and private_foundations to treat patients at the proposed Pasadena Community Health Center at 1845 N . Fair Oaks Ave . The center will serve the one in four Pasadena residents who have no medical insurance -- about 33 # 000 people -- as well as those with inadequate coverage . Many of them live_in the northwest part of the city . The center also will handle Medi-Cal patients . Pasadena officials announced in February that they had purchased the 61 # 000-square-foot former Pasadena Community Hospital for $ 1.7 million . The site , which includes three buildings , will be renovated at a cost of about $ 5.5 million . The city has issued bonds , secured a grant and other funds to pay_for the purchase and renovation . The amount_of_money that must be raised for treatment has not been determined , Stiff said . The health center could open in early 1996 . The facility is expected to house a public health clinic offering outpatient services , including well-child and prenatal care , alcohol- and drug-recovery programs , and testing and treatment for HIV and tuberculosis . It will have a contingent of doctors and nurses to treat routine injuries and illnesses . Serious cases , such_as heart_attacks and major injuries , will be referred to area hospitals , most likely Huntington Memorial Hospital and St . Luke Medical_Center , Stiff said . The center also will house most of the city Health Department ' s administrative offices , which are presently in several locations throughout Pasadena . * Representatives of the Black Males Forum , a group of community activists , and others called_on city officials several years ago to establish a health center in northwest Pasadena , one of the city ' s poorer areas . Councilmen Chris Holden and Isaac Richard supported the campaign that led to the recent purchase of the old hospital site , a forum spokesman said . Spokesman Marcus Williams said group members will serve an advisory role to ensure that the health center provides a range of services , along with an emphasis on preventive care . &quot; We want our people to have access to doctors for preventive care , not just when something happens , &quot; Williams said . &quot; We ' d like to see a lot of that in that building. &quot;</TEXT>
