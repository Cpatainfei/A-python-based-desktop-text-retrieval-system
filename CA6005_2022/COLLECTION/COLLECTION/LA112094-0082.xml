   <HEADLINE> SCHOLARS CONTINUE TO REVEAL MAO ' S MONSTROSITIES ; ASIA : EXILED CHINESE HISTORIANS EMERGE WITH EVIDENCE OF CANNIBALISM AND UP TO 80 MILLION DEATHS UNDER THE COMMUNIST LEADER ' S REGIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gong Xiaoxia recalls the blank expression on the man ' s face as he was beaten to death by a Chinese mob . He died without a name , becoming another statistic among millions . &quot; I remember him so vividly , he really had no expression on his face , &quot; Gong said . &quot; After about 10 or 20 minutes , God knows how long , someone took_out a knife and hit him right into the heart. &quot; He was then strung on a pole and left dangling and rotting for two months . &quot; I think the most terrible thing , when I recall that period , the most terrible thing that struck me was our indifference , &quot; said Gong , today a 38-year-old graduate_student at Harvard researching her own history . That terrible period was China ' s 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution . The blinding indifference was in the name of Chairman Mao Tse-tung and the Communist_Party . Gong is among a new_wave of scholars and intellectuals , both Western and Chinese , who believe modern Chinese history needs rewriting . While the focus of many books and articles today is_on China ' s successful economic reforms , dramatic new figures for the number of people who died as a result of Mao Tse-tung ' s policies are surfacing , along with horrifying proof of cannibalism during the Cultural Revolution . It is now believed that as_many as 60 million to 80 million people may have died because of Mao ' s policies -- making him responsible_for more deaths than Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin combined . Gong said killer is not a strong enough word to describe Mao . &quot; He was a monster , &quot; she said . Hitler ' s policies led to tens of millions of deaths during World_War_II and in concentration_camps , and Stalin is blamed for tens of millions more . Chinese government figures say between 15 million and 25 million people died unnatural deaths during Mao ' s reign from 1949 until his death in 1976 . But both Chinese and Western scholars know those figures are no longer valid . One document , published in the Shanghai University journal Society last year -- and immediately yanked from shelves -- said 40 million people died during the great famine of 1959-1961 . Some China experts say it is time to move_on and put the past to rest . But so_much new information is coming_out about China ' s recent past that this handful of scholars , some of whom recently fled China , feel it must be recorded so that future generations will learn from it . Like the relentless scholars of the Holocaust , they hope to prevent history from repeating itself . &quot; I think that the upheavals in the middle of the century , the famine and the Cultural Revolution , are still very much locked into the soul of China , &quot; said Perry Link , a professor at Princeton . &quot; Modern China ' s not going_to find its way into the 21st Century unless the Chinese people can feel that they really got_to the bottom of how such things happened. &quot; Andrew Walder , a Harvard sociologist working with Gong to examine hundreds of recently obtained Chinese documents on atrocities during the Cultural Revolution , acknowledged that some colleagues feel Mao ' s failures are old news . &quot; Most China scholars are not really interested in delving back into those issues , &quot; Walder said . &quot; I think , with_regard_to violence with the Cultural Revolution , that ' s what we ' ve done , we ' ve had a sense of complacency. &quot; The Tian An Men Square pro-democracy movement of 1989 played a role in making much of this new information available to the West . The crackdown forced some Communist_Party members and leading intellectuals to flee the country -- taking with them secret documents and new resolve to uncover the truth about how many died during Mao ' s rule , and to tell just how they died . One of the best-known is Chen Yizi , a Communist_Party member who was an architect of the economic reforms of the 1980s and founder of several government think_tanks . During the pro-democracy movement in the spring of 1989 , Chen urged the government to negotiate with the demonstrators . After the tanks rolled and untold numbers of people died -- estimates range from about 500 to several thousands -- Chen became one of the seven most-wanted -- dead or alive -- dissidents in China . Chen , now 54 , fled to the United States and founded the Center for Modern China , based in Princeton , N.J. Using smuggled government documents , Chinese population statistics and interviews with police and villagers in four Chinese provinces , Chen calculated that as_many as 43 million people died during the famine that followed Mao ' s absurd industrial campaign , the Great Leap Forward of 1958-60 . &quot; The truth will be much higher than this figure -- believe it , &quot; Chen said during a recent interview at his Princeton apartment . &quot; The biggest problem for the Communist_Party is they never learned how to treat human_beings like human beings. &quot; Chen believes that , from the Communist takeover in 1949 through the landlord and intellectual purges of the 1950s , the Great Leap Forward , the Cultural Revolution and the prison system , at least 80 million met unnatural deaths . &quot; Of course , there ' s no doubt about it , &quot; Chen said . &quot; Americans just can ' t understand that such a thing could happen . Only when I went_to the countryside did I myself realize the truth. &quot; One of the provinces Chen visited was Anhui , about 500 miles south of Beijing . One official_document shows that , in one county alone , 60 # 245 people died , or about 7.7 % of the population . How Mao could be so callous about the millions who pledged their faith in him is still a mystery . &quot; The story of Mao still just isn ' t known , &quot; said Link , a professor of East Asian studies at Princeton . &quot; I think he will rank with Stalin and Hitler when the dust settles. &quot; New documents are being made available , and a book has been written by Li Zhisui , Mao ' s personal physician for 22 years . &quot; The Private Life of Chairman Mao , &quot; released last month , paints Mao as an unfeeling man who refused to be treated for sexually transmitted disease despite infecting the many young_women who shared his bed . The memoir describes an imperial court of decadence and ruthless intrigue . Mao , a classical poet , knew little about economics . But he insisted on trying to lead the country out of the Middle_Ages overnight . The masses joined the race to increase steel output with back-yard furnaces , believing the Great Helmsman would lead them out of their long history of poverty and feudalism . But in doing so , farmers left their fields . And having no skills at steel-making , the metal was poor quality , and most of it was useless . After the first bad harvest , Mao ' s aides began to warn him of famine . After two more poor harvests , the nation was plunged into starvation , forced to ration , steal and scavenge for roots and rodents . Mao never admitted that the Great Leap was a failure , although he did step aside while top party pragmatists -- including Deng Xiaoping -- rescued the country by focusing_on agriculture . Harry Wu remembers the Great Famine . During its worst year , 1960 , after he graduated from college , he was arrested for speaking out at a Communist_Party Youth League meeting . He spent 19 years in China ' s labor-reform camps . Wu is a resident scholar at Stanford_University who published an account of his ordeal in the book &quot; Bitter Winds &quot; last year . He recalls eating rats and snakes during the famine to supplement his prison rations , and burying countless fellow inmates who starved to death . Zheng Yi was one of China ' s leading contemporary writers before he fled Beijing after helping to organize intellectuals during the Tian An Men uprising . He arrived_at Princeton , a center for many Chinese dissidents , in 1992 and finished a book about political cannibalism during the Cultural Revolution . &quot; Red Memorial , &quot; to be published in English next year , offers some of the most gruesome accounts ever of the Cultural Revolution , which was unleashed by Mao in a last-ditch campaign to rejuvenate himself after the famine . The 47-year-old writer who grew_up in Beijing was sent to the countryside for the decade of the Cultural Revolution to work_on farms and in mining . He heard tales of cannibalism , but he couldn ' t imagine they were true . So he and his wife , anthropologist Bei Ming , set_off for Guangxi province to interview villagers and officials in six counties . &quot; I realized it was the most important thing I could do , &quot; said Zheng , who wears the black-rimmed glasses of a Chinese intellectual . &quot; I read a lot of books about Nazi Germany , and I admired the writers who had told the truth -- so I felt the need to do the same thing. &quot; He secretly photographed police files and some of the accused killers . Zheng ' s voice softened when he spoke_of one 86-year-old man , Yi Wansheng of Sixiao village in Zhongshan county , who spoke freely and with pride about murdering and dividing up the organs of one young_man . Deng Jifang had fled his village as a young boy after his brother and father , who belonged_to the hated landlord class , were killed by the government in the 1950s . But in 1968 , villagers trying to comply with a Red Guard frenzy for rounding_up &quot; class enemies &quot; hunted_down Deng , then 20 , in a neighboring village . They carried him in a bamboo cage back to Sixiao , where the villagers beat him and poked him with hot iron rods until he passed_out . The villagers then carried him to the river , and while he was still alive , Yi slit his chest and pulled_out Deng ' s heart and liver . &quot; Because he was a class enemy , it wasn ' t enough to kill him , &quot; Zheng said . &quot; You had to eat him . It was a symbol of loyalty to the party. &quot; Because of not having full access to government documents , Zheng was never able to give an accurate number of how many people were cannibalized . He did , however , get full access to the archives of Wuxuan county , where 64 people were eaten_in 1968 . There , 56 hearts and livers and 13 sets of genitals were eaten . Seven people were disemboweled while still alive . Cannibalism was practiced in ancient times because some believed human blood held medicinal powers . During the Great Famine , it occurred in matters of life or death . But this type of political cannibalism was unprecedented . As the death toll continues to rise and tales of terrors unfold , former prisoner Wu reflects an opinion held by many when they consider Mao : &quot; I don ' t even care about 80 million , 60 million killed . The simple one fact is he ' s a monster , he ' s evil , he ' s a ghost , he ' s nothing but a criminal . The Chinese can never forgive him. &quot;</TEXT>
