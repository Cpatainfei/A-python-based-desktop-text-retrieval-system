   <HEADLINE> CRAFT LAUNCHED IN NASA STUDY OF SOLAR WIND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A NASA spacecraft called Wind rocketed into orbit Tuesday on a three-year journey to study the electrified particles that stream from the sun . The unmanned Delta rocket blasted_off from Cape Canaveral Air_Force Station , 10 miles from the Kennedy Space Center , where shuttle Atlantis awaits a Thursday launch . Eight instruments -- six U.S. , one French and the first Russian instrument to fly_on an American spacecraft -- will analyze solar_wind , the energy hurtling from the sun at more_than 1 million m.p.h. Solar wind gusts can cause geomagnetic storms that can disrupt electrical_power , radio communications and satellite operations . Scientists hope Wind ' s findings will help them foresee outbursts . In 1996 , plans call_for Wind to be catapulted out of Earth ' s orbit into a circle 200 # 000 miles in diameter , 1 million miles from Earth and 92 million miles from the sun . At that point , the gravities of Earth and the sun balance and should keep the craft there forever .</TEXT>
