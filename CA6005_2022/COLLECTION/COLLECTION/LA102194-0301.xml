   <HEADLINE> MISSED TAX APPEAL DEADLINES MAY COST COUNTY ; GOVERNMENT : SEVERAL HUNDRED PROPERTY_OWNERS FAILED TO GET TIMELY HEARINGS OF ASSESSMENT CHALLENGES . OFFICIALS SCRAMBLE TO LEARN THE FISCAL RAMIFICATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> County officials are frantically scrambling to size_up the potential damage after learning that they might have to refund tax dollars to several hundred property_owners for failing to hear their assessment appeals within the legal deadline . * &quot; we ' ll be working_through the weekend so we can determine the magnitude of the problem , &quot; County Administrator Ernie Schneider said Thursday . The investigation was launched after an assessment appeals_board ruled Monday that the county must accept the Bank of America ' s valuation of a property in Brea that was about $ 100 million less than the county claimed , because the county missed a Sept . 15 cutoff date to hold an appeals hearing . By violating a state law requiring appeals_to be heard within two years , county officials figure , the county now will be obliged to refund to Bank of America $ 1 million a year for up_to three years , the period between the date the county assessor received the bank ' s notice of appeal and the next reassessment of the property . Schneider said it has been estimated that assessment appeals for as_many as 300 other parcels also may be near or past the deadline . Most of these properties are residences , which means the tax dollars in_dispute won ' t be nearly as great as in the Bank of America case . He said he is investigating to find how the Bank of America mishap occurred and who might be responsible . He said he would have expected the county clerk to schedule the hearing before the expiration date , but he would also have expected the assessor ' s caseworker to be aware of upcoming deadlines . County Assessor Bradley L . Jacobs denied any blame Thursday , pointing at the supervisors and the county clerk . &quot; The assessor department does not handle the appeals process , &quot; Jacobs said . &quot; Under the laws of the state , the appeals process is handled by the Board of Supervisors in their duty as a local board of equalization , and they appoint the hearing board . &quot; The clerk is the officer of the administrative proceedings , handles schedules and is responsible to obtain waivers. &quot; Phyllis Henderson , the county clerk , was unavailable for comment Thursday . However , other county officials said she had a written opinion , issued previously by the county counsel ' s office , that she is not responsible_for alerting the assessor to pending deadlines . Supervisor William G . Steiner said he was upset by the amount of &quot; finger-pointing. &quot; &quot; It appears to me that authority has been divided between the assessor and the clerk of the board , and if that is true , it ' s pretty difficult to hold people accountable . People start playing the blame game. &quot; Steiner added that the loss of county revenues in the Bank of America case represented &quot; a significant amount_of_money , especially when our budget is already strained. &quot; He said he was surprised by the situation , particularly because the board &quot; led the effort to get the clerk of the board and the assessor the resources they needed to deal with their very heavy workload . . . . I don ' t understand why this has occurred. &quot; Supervisor Roger R . Stanton said he also would like &quot; to get a straight answer. &quot; &quot; It seems we can ' t associate a name and face with this misdeed , &quot; he said . &quot; There has to be some accountability . People shouldn ' t be allowed to hide behind this shroud of bureaucracy. &quot; Stanton equated the county to a business that has taken steps to reduce its expenditures and work_force , then &quot; fails to collect on its accounts receivable. &quot; Jacobs acknowledged that the county has been struggling to keep_up with a flood of appeals that has hit the assessor ' s office since a real_estate recession sent property values plummeting . He said his office has held or reduced assessments on 257 # 000 properties this year . In addition , he said his office has resolved 27 # 000 appeals of the 1992 and 1993 tax_assessment rolls . Nonetheless , Schneider said , the county is working_through a backlog of 36 # 000 remaining appeals . &quot; Of those , 300 have somehow fallen_through the cracks , &quot; he said . Henderson , the county clerk , was unable to find the original copies of those appeals_to check whether the appeals review time has lapsed , Schneider said . Schneider said Henderson contends that the assessor ' s office neglected to send them to her . Cary Walker , a spokesman for Bank of America , denied that the bank will be receiving a windfall from the county ' s oversight . &quot; I think it ' s been suggested that Orange County will lose a considerable amount of tax_revenue because it failed to grant in a timely manner a hearing that the Bank of America was entitled to , &quot; he said . &quot; But that assumes the county ' s $ 119.8-million valuation would have prevailed at the hearing . In fact , we believe our valuation of $ 23.9 million is the correct one. &quot; He said the property , which became excess with the merger of Bank of America and Security Pacific , is now on the market at an asking price of $ 55 million .</TEXT>
