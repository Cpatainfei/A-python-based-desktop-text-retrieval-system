   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : IRVINE ; BOARD WILL ASSESS ITS SCHOOL SAFETY EFFORT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Irvine Unified School District ' s Board_of_Education will review its yearlong effort to improve school safety and reduce youth violence . The discussion will give school officials and board_members a chance to assess what steps the district has already taken and look_at what officials should do next . The public can watch the presentation tonight at 7:30 on cable_television Channel 3 . Youth violence has been a key issue in Irvine . A committee made_up of city and school officials delivered a comprehensive report on the subject last spring . The Safe Community Task_Force made more_than 50 recommendations for reducing youth violence . School officials have already begun implementing some suggestions , including : * Hiring school safety officers for high_schools and middle_schools . * Increasing the use of &quot; conflict management &quot; training to prevent physical confrontations among students . These nonviolent conflict resolution techniques rely in part on students who help other students work_out their differences without fighting . * Increasing the use of ethics curricula in schools . Board_member Margie Wakeham praised the district ' s efforts for going beyond simple security measures and attempting to change the way students look_at conflict and violence . She praised the conflict management programs for helping students &quot; look clearly at the issues ( involved in a dispute ) and find ways to resolve conflicts and ( remain ) friends. &quot; Ethics training such_as the kind being taught to ninth-graders at Woodbridge High_School is considered a model for other programs around the nation , Wakeham said . &quot; It ' s not just about the importance of being honest , &quot; she said . &quot; It looks_at things like tolerance and respecting other people ' s rights. &quot; Wakeham said the district might consider placing intercoms or telephones into portable classrooms that currently don ' t have them . Teachers have suggested the idea as a way of maintaining instant two-way communications with other school officials . SHELBY GRAD</TEXT>
