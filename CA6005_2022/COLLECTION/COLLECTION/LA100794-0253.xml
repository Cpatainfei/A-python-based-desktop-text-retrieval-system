   <HEADLINE> OC HIGH : STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS ; A FRENCH CONNECTION ; CUSTOMS : GROUP FINDS ATTITUDES TOWARD AMERICANS GENERALLY FAVORABLE AND FINDS ITS ADMIRATION FOR THE HOST NATION GROWING AS WELL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So what ' s it like in France ? Besides wanting to learn the language , our group focused_on French life -- the social attitudes , business attitudes and attitudes toward Americans . The French supposedly have a reputation for showing not-so-good manners toward Americans . Yet after interacting and people-watching for five weeks in various parts of France , the seven in our group encountered mostly polite gestures . &quot; I found the people to be a lot nicer than the stereotype about them being rude , &quot; Costa Mesa High_School senior Susan Channels said . Sunny Hills High_School junior Jessica Johnson agreed . &quot; If they see someone who looks lost , they help . I was never looked down upon as an American. &quot; The 50th anniversary of D-Day enhanced the warm reception for Americans . Pride in our American heritage swelled when we saw flags and banners strung between buildings , across streets and in shop windows reading &quot; Welcome to our liberators. &quot; The French appeared to be very generous with charities . Many French citizens budget a set amount_of_money for monthly donations to a variety of causes . An advertisement in the metro station asked : &quot; What will you tell your children when they ask what you did for Rwanda ? &quot; Listed below the question were social_organizations -- les O.N.G ( or Organizations Non Gouvernmentales ) -- to contact . In general , public awareness of contemporary issues seems to take a high priority . For example , while the issues of sex and AIDS are cautiously discussed in the United States , in France there are billboards openly advising protection and the use of preservatifs . &quot; I really noticed the AIDS posters , &quot; said Michelle French , a junior at Los Alamitos High_School . &quot; Here , things dealing with the body are much more censored . In France , art with nudity is seen as beautiful art ; here it ( can be ) pornography . It ' s a different sense of propriety. &quot; Not all health issues are addressed so strongly . Very few French adolescents view smoking as a risk . For Americans who are used to walking into restaurants that prohibit smoking , the contrast is startling . Oxygen becomes precious at a discotheque . Drinking seems to be a smaller problem . The drinking_age in France is 16 , and drinking is considered part of the culture rather than a rite of passage . Great pride in food and wine teaches French teens to consume responsibly . As a group , we avoided alcohol at summer school meals and parties -- and were seen as prudish . Americans fascinated the staff and other students at the language_school we attended . They wanted to know what we ate for breakfast at_home and if we constantly went_to concerts and movies . Many of the students at the school spoke some English . We wanted to practice our French ; they wanted to practice their English . As a result , an alternative &quot; Franglais &quot; was often spoken . An American pastime that seems to be just catching_on in French stores is browsing . The French expect customers entering a shop to buy a specific item . Browsing with no intent to buy is often looked_upon with suspicion . Some stores give permission to browse by posting a sign , entree libre -- free entry . &quot; Culturally , I was surprised by the non-browsing thing , &quot; said Katie Tucker , a junior at Sunny Hills . &quot; I ' m used to walking in and looking and then walking_out . Instead , I was getting the ' evil eye. ' &quot; We noticed a large divergence between the retail and food_shops when it came_to politeness . Clothing_stores , especially , had curt employees . Specialty food_shop owners had the most patience and courtesy -- and probably not surprisingly for teens , we spent most of our francs on food . In French restaurants and cafes , there is a &quot; self-serve &quot; flavor . Instead of waiting to be seated , customers find their own cafe table and wait for service . There is no rush when eating . In fact , the customer must ask_for the l ' addition -- or bill -- because it is considered rude for the waiter to bring it without being summoned . Negotiating the_French language at school and in town attuned our ears to French rhythms . As comprehension increased , so did our confidence . We participated in everyday activities and grew accustomed to them starting a l ' heure -- on_time . Our admiration of French customs grew as we better understood the society . LAURIE CARPER</TEXT>
