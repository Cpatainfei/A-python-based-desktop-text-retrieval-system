   <HEADLINE> IT ' S JUST ANOTHER DAY IN GERMANY ; D-DAY : THERE WILL BE NO CEREMONIES OR MOMENTS OF SILENCE . CITIZENS HAVE ' MIXED FEELINGS , ' AND BONN PREFERS TO ' LOOK FORWARD. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A small building set_in a grove of chestnut_trees on Berlin ' s once-grand Unter den Linden houses Germany ' s central war memorial : Inside its walls , heavily incised by machine-gun fire from half a century ago , stands a single bronze sculpture of a woman cradling the body of her son . &quot; To the victims of war and tyranny , &quot; reads the inscription . If there were any interest on the part of Germans in commemorating the Normandy landings today , it ought to be evident here . Young_men drafted into Hitler ' s Wehrmacht were , after all , victims of war -- about 100 # 000 German soldiers died in the two months it took the Allies to consolidate a front in northern France . But in unavoidable contrast to the surging crowds and victors ' pageantry marking D-day ' s 50th anniversary day 700-odd miles to the west , this shrine stands silent and largely empty . A little rain falls_through the open-air skylight above the sculpture ; a_few wilted bouquets lie on the stone floor in front of the statue ; visitors trickle silently in and out the door . That is all . &quot; Germany looks_at the D-day festivities with mixed feelings , &quot; noted Klaus Bering of the German news_agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur . &quot; While the Allies celebrate , the Germans are just watching from the sidelines. &quot; Indeed , there are no ceremonies in Germany today , no government pronouncements , no scheduled moment of silence . German television is airing &quot; The Longest Day , &quot; and a_few German veterans are making independent pilgrimages to the_French beaches , but on the whole , the proceedings that have captured so_much attention in the United States have made_for a virtual non-event here . True , for Germany , the landings in Normandy were really just a sideshow to the 1942-43 Battle of Stalingrad , which for this country was the turning point of World_War_II . And Germany doesn ' t commemorate that high-casualty catastrophe either , because the Allied occupiers banned veterans groups here in the first years after the war , and a clubby veterans tradition has not flourished in Germany the way it has in the United States . But Germany ' s reluctance to note the passing of the D-day anniversary is more_than just a reflection of how few veterans groups there are or of how much greater emphasis Germans place on the Eastern Front than on France . It is also a reflection of Germany ' s everlasting struggle to come_to terms with its past . Even 50 years of good relations with the Western democracies and a successful grafting of democratic tissue onto the German character have not been enough to erase the horror of the Third_Reich . So reluctant are most Germans today to connect with their collective past that they are slow even to salute their dead . In Bonn , for instance , there were hurt feelings when the_French left Chancellor Helmut Kohl off the official Normandy guest list . Yet Kohl merely responded that he hadn ' t wanted to go_to Normandy anyway , and he went_on to forbid German diplomats to participate in most D-day events . &quot; Let these people celebrate this day , &quot; Kohl said in a recent interview with the_British Broadcasting Corp . &quot; Let the survivors commemorate it in honor of their fallen comrades . . . . This is no day for us Germans to join in the commemoration. &quot; The symbol-loving Kohl will , however , meet with French President Francois Mitterrand just two days after the D-day ceremonies , during a youth festival in Heidelberg . And he has said German diplomats may attend events in France if they lack a military character and &quot; look_forward to the future. &quot; Indeed , to the extent there has been any discussion of D-day among German commentators in the last week , virtually all_of it has &quot; looked_forward , &quot; dealing with the years since World_War_II and not the war years themselves , or any other aspect of National_Socialism . Much of the commentary has been upbeat , concentrating_on the achievements of the last half-century , the fruitful association with the United States and calling the fall of the Third_Reich a &quot; liberation &quot; for Germans too . But a recent survey highlights the difficulty Germans still have , half a century after the war , in coming_to grips with the rise of Hitler and agreeing upon what it may say about German society . When asked who was to blame for the start of World_War_II , 56 % of those surveyed named Germany , but a full quarter said they blamed &quot; the confused international situation. &quot; More_than 90 % said they had no doubt that the Nazi Holocaust had really happened , but when asked how they viewed the political concepts of the Nazis , nearly a quarter -- 24 % -- said they were &quot; not so bad at all. &quot; The German weekly Die Woche , which published the survey results , called this level of tolerance for Nazi ideology alarming and noted that the only good thing about such a figure was that it was smaller than it had been in previous surveys . In 1955 , according to Die Woche , almost half of West Germans said they would have considered Hitler a great statesman if he hadn ' t tried to wipe_out the Jews . In 1989 , another survey turned_up 46 % of Germans saying they could find some good things about National_Socialism .</TEXT>
