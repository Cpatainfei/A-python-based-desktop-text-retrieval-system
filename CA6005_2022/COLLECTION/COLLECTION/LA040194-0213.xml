   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; GROUP PLANS CANCER INFORMATION PUSH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The American Cancer Society-Orange County region plans to set_up new satellite offices countywide in an attempt to reach more people with information about cancer prevention and detection . &quot; We realized that in our Orange County unit , we were only reaching people within a 12-mile radius of our office in Santa Ana , &quot; said Margaret Edwards , American Cancer Society spokeswoman . The American Cancer Society plans to set_up community information centers and small satellite offices in cities across Orange County in hospitals , business parks , shopping_centers , churches and office_buildings . &quot; Our goal is to move our staff out into satellite community_centers , so that in all parts of the county we ' ll have facilities close to the people who need the services , &quot; said George Hedley , member of the board of directors and vice_president of administration . &quot; By each community having their own center , we can focus_on their needs and not the whole county ' s needs. &quot; The organization plans to open six satellite offices in north , south , central and west county areas this year , Edwards said . Each office would be self-governed by a board of directors and oversee its own operations . &quot; Eventually , our goal is to have one in every community , &quot; Hedley said . Services will include support group meetings , breast and prostate cancer education , stop-smoking classes , patient transportation to medical appointments , early prevention and detection measures , and nutrition information . Next month , an information center is expected to open at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical_Center . It will complement the hospital ' s own cancer services , which include the Orange County Regional Cancer Center , a nonprofit organization established for the purpose of furthering cancer research and education , hospital officials said . &quot; We ' re excited about the cancer society creating a unit here to be associated with our Orange County Regional Cancer Center , &quot; said Dr. Terence O ' Heany , who specializes in gynecology and is interim director of the oncology program . &quot; What this means is we can develop a comprehensive program where the patient can have everything done on this campus. &quot; An information center in a medical_building near Mission Hospital Regional Medical_Center in Mission Viejo already provides some informational and referral services , said Gloria Ruston , American Cancer Society district representative for South County . Ruston said the cancer society is in need of donated space for satellite offices . While more_than 10 # 000 volunteers currently are involved with the local American Cancer Society , Hedley said more people are needed to carry_out the plan to reach the public with its services and programs . &quot; We need to reach more people with less staff people and more volunteers , &quot; Edwards said . &quot; We ' re trying to increase the volunteer base by 15 % this year . People can give as little or as much as they want . But whatever they give , it will make a difference . The donation of time is an invaluable resource for us. &quot; More information is available by calling ( 714 ) 751-0441 . DEBRA CANO</TEXT>
