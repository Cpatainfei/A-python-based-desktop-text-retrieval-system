   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; SMOKING BAN IS CLOUDED IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fate of a strict smoking ban in restaurants and workplaces has become hazy , with the City_Council backing_away from a broad ban it had supported last month . Council_members voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to hold two more public meetings on the issue and conduct a survey of restaurant owners about enforcing their own smoking controls . &quot; Confrontation on this issue is very , very unwise , &quot; said Councilman Carl Boyer , who asked_for the additional meetings . &quot; It ' s one of those issues that will tear_apart the community . One side always loses. &quot; Santa Clarita ' s proposed tobacco control ordinance would prohibit smoking in restaurants , workplaces and enclosed public areas . Bars that generate less than 25 % of their income from food sales would be exempted . The council decision frustrated anti-smoking advocates who thought that the issue was resolved Dec . 14 when the council voted 4 to 1 in favor of the ban . &quot; I think we ' re going back to Square 1 . We ' re going back to where we were six months ago , &quot; said Councilwoman Jill Klajic , who -- joined by Mayor George Pederson -- opposed the additional meetings . &quot; We ' ve had hearings . We ' ve had lots of hearings . Why are we opening it up again ? &quot; One reason was the nearly 200 people who packed the council_chambers Tuesday night . It was the first time that discussion of the smoking ban had drawn a large crowd . Restaurant owners complained that a ban would drive customers out of Santa Clarita and into nearby unincorporated areas where patrons could smoke without restrictions . Others called the legislation intrusive . &quot; Why aren ' t we going_to restaurants and telling people they can ' t serve fatty food because it ' s bad for people ? &quot; one restaurant owner said . Although Los Angeles and dozens of other cities in the state have smoking controls , the one proposed by Santa Clarita is broader than most . Banks , Laundromats , shopping_centers , theaters , restaurants and retail_stores are among the establishments covered by the proposal . City officials say adoption of smoking controls in other nearby cities , most notably Los Angeles , brought the debate into Santa Clarita . &quot; In six years , I don ' t think I got one complaint about smoking in Santa Clarita until Los Angeles passed its ordinance , &quot; said Councilwoman Jan Heidt , who prefers to allow businesses to make their own rules about smoking . Supporters of the strong smoking controls say the issue is one of health rather than personal freedom . &quot; People don ' t have the right to interfere with the health of another person , &quot; said Donna Pugh , the Canyon Country resident who began the anti-smoking drive last year . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s a smokers versus nonsmokers issue , &quot; Klajic said . &quot; I certainly don ' t think it has anything to do with your rights . It ' s a health issue. &quot; Smoke Out Areas where smoking is restricted in and around the San Fernando Valley : Agoura Hills : Most restaurants and public places . Calabasas : Most restaurants and public places . Burbank : Places of general_assembly , such_as theaters , and some City_Hall offices . Glendale : A proposed ban on restaurant smoking was shot down by business opposition several years ago . Lancaster : City buildings and most enclosed public places . Los Angeles : Hospitals , police_stations , elevators , theaters , City_Hall and most restaurants . Palmdale : Buses , cabs and most enclosed public places . Santa Clarita : City_Council says it will survey restaurant owners and hold two more public meetings before making a decision on a proposed smoking ban . San Fernando : City_Council is considering a resolution that would limit smoking in restaurants . Westlake Village : Smoking banned in restaurants , workplaces , hospitals and recreation areas .
