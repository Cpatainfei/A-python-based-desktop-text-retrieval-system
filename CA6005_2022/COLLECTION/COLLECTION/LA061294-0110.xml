   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; ANTHONY BLAIR ; THE FAIR-HAIRED BOY OF THE LABOR_PARTY -- AND BRITAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just across Parliament Square from the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben is a nondescript building of small , cramped offices . Among them is the office of Britain ' s Shadow Home_Secretary . It is almost comically narrow and claustrophobic . But this is how Britain treats its opposition leaders -- which is why winning power here is everything . For four consecutive national elections -- almost 16 years -- the Labor_Party has been out of power . But now its supporters have hope , and the reason is Anthony Charles Lynton Blair , known to all as &quot; Tony. &quot; At the young age of 41 -- and after only 11 years in Parliament -- the personable and articulate Blair appears the Labor ' s leading choice to become its next leader in the July 21 balloting -- replacing John Smith , who died_suddenly of a heart_attack in May . A Scot with an English accent , Blair attended a private_school in Edinburgh , graduated from Oxford_University and was elected to Parliament from the mining country in Durham . In 1984 , barely 30 , he became a member of Labor ' s &quot; Shadow Cabinet. &quot; He and his wife , Cherie , a lawyer , have three children . If elected party leader , Blair would be in position to be the next prime_minister -- unless the persistently flagging fortunes of the Conservative_Party under John Major improve markedly . Blair is the opposition party ' s leading &quot; modernizer &quot; -- intent_on attracting not just working-class voters and intellectuals but mainstream Britons who ordinarily vote Conservative or Liberal Democrat . At least this is what supporters fervently hope -- that Blair is the man of the future whose centrist policies appeal_to a wide spectrum . His opponents , however , say Blair is just a glamorous new face on the old Labor_Party , with its militant leftist tendencies and scary collectivist policies . Yet , even his most severe political critics take Blair seriously , knowing he may be the brightest young_man in the opposition today , and the brightest Labor_leader to appear in many_a day . That man in the cramped office bodes to someday occupy a far grander space -- at No . 10 Downing Street . * Question : The impression one has of the Labor_Party is that it ' s part and party to socialism , of nationalization of industry , of the large welfare_state , with high taxation and lots of centralized government . Is this view wrong ? Answer : I think that view is fairly out of date . The Labor_Party -- in common with most left-of-center parties in the last 20 or 30 years in Europe -- has undergone a considerable amount of change . Not changing its basic_principles but updating those principles for the modern_world . The argument between public versus private sector is really a dead argument within the Labor_Party . Socialism is a word I know that has a particular meaning in the United States , ( but ) socialism to most of us within the Labor_Party is a basic set of_values , it ' s a view of society and the individual and the belief that individuals prosper best within a strong and cohesive society and community . And that value system is what the modern Labor_Party is about rather than economic prescriptions that may have been fine for particular generations or have some historical connection with certain perspectives about socialism but don ' t really represent the Labor_Party as it is today . Q : Bill_Clinton moved his party to the center and won the election . Is it your view that the only sensible political ground these days is the middle ? A : I don ' t think the governing ground need be the consensus of the lowest common_denominator , and the least offensive to people . But we do have to break_through some of the stereotypes around left and right . For example , it ' s interesting that people in the Soviet_Union who are old statists and who want state control are regarded_as right_wing . Left_wing , to me , means radical , and I think we do need a radical party , but it should be a radical party for today ' s world -- not the world of 40 or 50 years ago . Now the great historical change this century . . . was the acknowledgment that as the state grew in power , so there were vested_interests that could grow_up around it that could be every bit as powerful and occasionally every bit as oppressive as the vested_interests of capital . And , therefore , what we require for today ' s world is a notion of the public interest , society ' s interest as_a_whole , where you set certain key objectives in an attempt to fulfill them -- but don ' t have an ideological predisposition that they must be fulfilled by the public sector or the private sector . That notion of partnership -- of working together , public and private sector -- is much more where it ' s at for most left-of-center politics in Europe now . Q : Your critics say your modern Labor politicians might make a good speech or have a good non-threatening image but break_through that imagery and behind it you have the old burnt-out socialism . A : Yup , well , they would say that ( laughing ) . No , what has burnt_out , in the same way that 19th Century liberalism has burnt_out , is the notion of socialism as a form of state control and ownership of everything . Socialism a la the Soviet_Union -- yeah , that ' s burnt_out . But socialism , for most of my generation in the Labor_Party , never meant that . What it meant was a set of_values -- a basic set of beliefs . And there are two different types of beliefs in politics . One is a very strictly individualist view -- which is the sort of Thatcherite view ; and one is a view that places the individual in the broader community , which is the social view of human_beings . . . . In a sense , you can say that the huge ideological battles of the earlier part of the century -- the notion that there would be one governing ideology that took the world over , whether of right or left -- those days are gone . The right has had to accept the existence of public provision and public_services , and the left has had to accept the existence of a market_economy and enterprise . To that extent , there ' s been some coming_together . . . . The most extraordinary statistic of the Thatcher years is that , at the end of her reign , public spending , as a proportion of our national_income , was higher than it was under our last Labor government . Now you can draw one or two conclusions from that . You can either say she was a closet socialist -- which is unlikely ; or you can say any modern society will have a significant public-welfare provision . The arguments should transfer much more toward what are the key objectives that we want to meet as a society , and how you rebuild social cohesion in our country , rather than focusing_on whether it ' s public or private sector or some argument about the state versus the market -- which is an intellectually dead argument . Q : But is your party prepared to take the position that if the rate of taxation had been any greater under Thatcher , it would have had a stifling effect on the economy ? A : There ' s clearly got_to be a balance struck there . But the great problem we ' ve got with public spending in this country is the enormous bills for high unemployment . We are now living with a structural unemployment_rate that is 8 % to 10 % . And that is massive , and that has huge social costs , and it has huge direct costs in terms of public expenditure . And one of the reasons why conservatives have had to put_up taxes . . . is to pay the costs of economic and social failure . The theme I have been developing is , in a sense , rebuilding this country as one nation , where people have a stake in our society , particularly young people , but where we are demanding respect and proper conduct in return . We should give chances and expect people to take them . It ' s a very important restatement of the left-of-center position -- that you believe_in society , but that it ' s a two-way deal for individuals . Q : But isn ' t it religious_leaders and educators who have the most legitimate role in building social cohesion ? A : Yeah , but government can assist the process , because its economic and social_policies will either enable people to develop opportunity and self-reliance and enterprise , or occasionally they can stifle them . Or , simply by getting government out of everything and just leaving the market to rule , they can allow those who can do_well to do_well and , therefore , those who are deprived of the opportunities not to do_well ; and we just waste a lot of our talent and ability . We have 1 million people here under the age of 25 out_of_work . For us , that ' s a helluva lot of people . Yet , we ' re surprised at the crime and drug scene . The reason why Labor has not been in power for 15 years or more is that , first of all , it took some really wrong turnings in the early 1980s . But then when it changed . . . it was never clear that it had changed and why it changed . . . . We weren ' t explaining it to people in terms of our basic values and principles . . . . You take the issue of crime . The issue of crime has just been sitting there as . . . a Labor_Party issue for years , and we felt difficult about talking_about it . There was a very strong civil-liberties lobby and that ' s fine -- the civil_liberties of people are very important . But we had allowed ourselves as being perceived as people who were more interested in the civil_liberties of people accused of crime than the civil_liberties of those getting their houses broken_into and beaten_up and mugged in the street . Now crime is a Labor_Party issue . Why ? Because it ' s the poorest , most vulnerable , most disadvantaged people in society that suffer from it . It ' s not people who can afford to put 10-foot perimeter walls around their houses and have the latest burglar_alarm installed ; it ' s some poor woman living_in the inner_city . . . and when she goes_down the stairs of her council house , she gets mugged . I mean , if we ' re the party that represents those people , then we represent those people by talking_about crime and having policies about crime that are tough on crime and are tough on the causes of crime . We don ' t ignore those social causes about crime , but we don ' t start excusing people from responsibility when they commit crimes . Q : Britain has always been America ' s closest ally . But , right now , the two seem to be having problems with their foreign_policy . How would a Labor government improve this ? A : If Britain could get its relationship with Europe sorted_out properly , then I think it could then act in a central mode toward developing a better understanding between America and Europe . My appreciation of Britain ' s relationship with the United States is that there are tremendous sentimental ties . I ' m struck everytime I am in Washington that if you come_over as a dignitary of the European Community , then people really want to get_to grips with what you are saying . But if you come from Britain . . . then there is this great fund of emotion , and all_the rest of it , but people are aware that Britain in Europe is a stronger thing . . . . ( Fortunately ) Labor has a clear position with_regard_to Europe . And , on the whole , with certain exceptions , because it is a pretty big issue , the party is united . . . . The party_favors cooperation within Europe . And , I think , too , that , with the Clinton_Administration , there will be clear ties between the two governments . Q : Given the activist press , what will happen to your privacy if you find yourself in high office ? Have you begun reconciling yourself to that ? A : Well , I ' ve certainly had a taste of it over the past couple of weeks . It ' s a very difficult issue , because I think , in the end , the public needs to ask itself what it wants of its politicians . From over here , when you look_across the water and see what is happening to Clinton , you do wonder what politics is supposed to be about . Whether he is a good President or not does not , in any way , appear to be connected to what most of which we appear to read about . And there ' s got_to be some fairly open debate about that . . . . Politicians use the media , so they can ' t really complain when the media comes_after them . And this is the love-hate relationship between the media and politicians that always exists . But what does have to happen . . . in terms of an understanding is how politics can work if it is to be feasible and in the interests of the public , there has to be some sense of where the boundaries are . . . . Given the nature of the press , ( you have to be aware ) of the fickleness with which they treat politicians . If I was in any doubt , I could always cross the Atlantic . . . . Q : You have to be a saint to be prime_minister ? A : If you do have to be a saint , you won ' t get a prime_minister . What you ' ll get is a prime_minister who is a liar. *</TEXT>
