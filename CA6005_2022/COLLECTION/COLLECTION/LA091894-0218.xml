   <HEADLINE> PIZZA CASE UNLIKELY FOCUS OF ' 3 STRIKES ' DEBATE ; COURTS : DEFENSE_LAWYER SAYS SUSPECT DOESN ' T SEE HOW WHAT HE ALLEGEDLY DID COULD SEND HIM TO PRISON FOR 25 YEARS TO LIFE . OFFICIALS BACK PROSECUTION OF SMALL-TIME STREET CRIMINAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jerry Dewayne Williams hardly seemed destined to become a well-known figure in the annals of American crime . A small-time street criminal with an almost ludicrous propensity for getting caught , Williams until recently was simply an anonymous bit player in the vast criminal justice system game , a revolving-door felon who had never done anything that society thought was worth more_than a short stretch in jail . None of his four felonies had ever rated even a single line of newspaper ink , or a mention on a news broadcast . But things have changed for Williams , 27 . Now , because of California ' s new &quot; three strikes &quot; law mandating long prison_terms for repeat felons , Williams is famous -- or infamous -- as the central figure in the so-called Three Strikes Pizza Case . He ' s looking_at spending 25 years to life in prison for allegedly stealing a slice of pepperoni_pizza from four youngsters in Redondo Beach . Perhaps because it revolves_around something so mundane -- pizza -- the case has attracted widespread attention . It ' s been the subject of numerous local and national newspaper , radio and television_news reports . Gov . Pete Wilson and California Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren have said publicly that they support the &quot; three strikes &quot; prosecution in the case . A South Bay-based group called Citizens Against Crime has been formed to monitor court proceedings against Williams . On the opposite side , the American Civil Liberties Union , which opposes the &quot; three strikes &quot; law , is looking_into the case , although the group has not decided whether to take any action . In short , Williams and that slice of pepperoni_pizza have become focal_points in the debate over whether California ' s &quot; three strikes &quot; law is too Draconian , or is instead just what the doctor ordered for a society fed up with crime and criminals . The case also has taken_on racial overtones , with some people , including Williams , complaining that it would have been handled differently if not for the fact that he is black and his four young alleged victims are white -- a charge the district_attorney ' s office vehemently denies . &quot; The whole city . . . sees me as this big black_man who ' s taken food from four small_white children , &quot; Williams , who is 6 feet 4 and weighs about 225 pounds , wrote in a letter from jail . &quot; And it was not like that at all. &quot; To his friends , and to Williams himself , it seems almost impossible that the crime in_question could carry such punishment . &quot; Life ? For a piece of pizza ? &quot; says Williams ' girlfriend , Tina White , who shared a house with him in Watts . &quot; That ain ' t right . There ain ' t no way that ' s right. &quot; &quot; He feels_like this just can ' t be true , &quot; Williams ' lawyer , veteran Deputy Public_Defender Arnold Lester , says of his client , who has pleaded innocent to robbery charges in the case . &quot; He just doesn ' t understand how what he allegedly did could send him to prison for 25 years to life. &quot; But prosecutors and supporters of the law take a different view . They say if Williams goes_to prison for life it won ' t be just because of the pizza , but because of his seemingly chronic inability to stop committing felonies . And despite all_the publicity , prosecutors say the case against Williams actually is routine , simply one of almost 1 # 000 &quot; three strikes &quot; cases filed_in Los Angeles County since the law took_effect in March . Williams , they say , deserves no sympathy . &quot; This case is about a robbery , &quot; says Deputy Dist . Atty . Ralph Shapiro , who is prosecuting Williams . &quot; It doesn ' t matter whether it was pizza or anything else . Because of his past record , I believe he deserves a substantial prison sentence. &quot; Whether he deserves it or not , it ' s clear that Williams ' already troubled life took a potentially disastrous turn for the worse one day early last month , when Shapiro scrawled three Xs at the top of the case work sheet -- shorthand for &quot; three strikes. &quot; According to friends , Williams grew_up in Compton , one of five children in a single-parent home . A later probation report said he started smoking marijuana at the age of 16 and at age 19 began using cocaine . He worked briefly as a laborer and as a kitchen helper at a convalescent home . A rap sheet lists arrests in Seattle , where he lived for a time , for vandalism , burglary and carrying an unregistered firearm . * Williams ' first felony conviction came at the age of 19 , when he pleaded guilty to drug possession and was sentenced to three years probation . The strikes started piling_up rapidly after that . In September , 1986 , Williams and a friend jumped a Compton man , knocked him down , punched him and stole his wallet with $ 1 # 100 in it . Williams -- who gave police the alias Kevin Dewayne Williamson , the first of several a.k.a. ' s -- later said the man had ripped_off his friend in a drug deal . The man was not seriously hurt . Williams pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to one year in County Jail and five years probation . In March , 1989 , sheriff ' s deputies in Lynwood saw Williams riding a stolen 1988 Honda motorcycle . When they pulled him over , they said Williams told them , &quot; I know the bike is stolen , but I didn ' t steal it. &quot; He pleaded guilty to joy riding , a felony , and served 225 days in County Jail , with another three years probation . In July , 1992 , Williams was in_trouble again , this time for chasing a 22-year-old man in Compton , knocking him down and trying to pull a gold chain from his neck . In what friends say was a more or less typical Williams maneuver , he did_it right in front of a Compton police_sergeant , who arrested him . &quot; He always got caught whatever he did , &quot; says an acquaintance who asked that her name not be used . &quot; It was always just dumb things , dumb , dumb. &quot; Williams pleaded guilty to attempted robbery , and was sentenced to 16 months in state_prison . He served eight months and was paroled from the California Correctional Center in Susanville in April , 1993 . Williams seemed to be getting things together after his prison_term . His parole officer later testified that &quot; he was doing_good , &quot; reporting to the parole office regularly and testing clean for drugs . He was released from parole early , in April , because of his good behavior . &quot; He was working every day , &quot; says White , his girlfriend , displaying Williams ' pay stubs from a temporary employment_agency . &quot; He was a good_guy . We were going_to get_married on his birthday in October. &quot; Then on July 30 , Williams and five friends , including Tina White and her sister Tynia White , decided to go_to the beach . According to police , shortly before dusk Williams and his friends were walking near the Redondo Beach Pier , in an area of small food_shops , when Williams and another man approached four children who were sitting at an outside table in front of Adam ' s Pizza . The children , Michael Adkins , 12 , his brother Terry , then 15 , both of El Segundo , and their out-of-state cousins Kevin and Amy Callahan , ages 10 and 7 , were eating an extra_large New York-style pepperoni_pizza . At a preliminary hearing last month , Michael testified that Williams ' companion &quot; said they were starving and asked us for a piece of pizza . . . . My brother said , ' Sorry , no you can ' t , ' and they asked again. &quot; Then , Michael testified , &quot; they reached_out , grabbed it and said , ' Thanks. ' &quot; &quot; Were you scared ? &quot; prosecutor Shapiro asked him . &quot; Yes . . . because they were much bigger than me , &quot; Michael testified . Williams ' friends tell a different story . &quot; They were just fooling_around , you know , &quot; Tynia White says . &quot; Jerry asked the boy if he could have a piece of pizza and the kid said yes . Jerry took the pizza , but then he threw it away because he doesn ' t eat pork. &quot; &quot; If he eats pork he faints , &quot; Tina White added . After the men walked away from the table , the pizza_shop manager called police . &quot; If I knew he ( Williams ) would go_for life , maybe I would have thought_twice about calling the police , &quot; the manager , who declined to be identified by name , said later . &quot; I don ' t know if he should go_for life . But he needs to be taught a lesson not to do this to children . They were small kids , and he ' s a big guy . They were scared. &quot; After police arrived , Michael Adkins pointed_out Williams at a nearby video arcade ; the other man was not identified . Tynia White says the group offered to pay_for the pizza , but the police arrested Williams anyway . According to prosecutor Shapiro , Williams gave police the alias Lafayette Eddie Hicks . Williams is being held_in County Jail in lieu of $ 100 # 000 bail . * Defense_attorney Lester believes the whole_thing was blown_out of proportion -- perhaps because of race . &quot; I have a feeling if it had been a white_person , or if it was a black guy and black kids in Compton , the police would have treated the_matter differently , &quot; Lester says . Prosecutors are given some leeway in handling &quot; three strikes &quot; cases . For example , in another recent South Bay case a man accused of stealing some underwear for his daughter was charged with breaking the &quot; three strikes &quot; law because he had been convicted of felonies in 1975 and 1979 . Because the prior convictions were so old , however , prosecutors dropped one of the strikes in a plea bargain . The man still got 32 months in prison under the &quot; second strike &quot; provision of the law , which defense_attorneys say was far more_than he would have gotten before &quot; three strikes &quot; was passed . But that is the exception , Shapiro says . When Redondo Beach police brought the Williams case to his office shortly after the arrest , he says , it was an easy &quot; three strikes &quot; call . &quot; It has been the district_attorney ' s position that ( ' three strikes ' ) is the law and we ' re going to enforce it , &quot; Shapiro said . &quot; The facts of the case indicated it was a robbery , which is a felony ; he had serious priors , he had just gotten_off parole . . . . It was almost automatic . . . . I put three Xs at the top of the work sheet. &quot; After a preliminary hearing , a Torrance judge ordered Williams held for trial on two counts of second-degree robbery and one count of felony petty theft with a prior . A pretrial hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday .</TEXT>
