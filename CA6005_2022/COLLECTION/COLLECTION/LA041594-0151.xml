   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; RARE VITALITY SHINES THROUGH IN ' ALI ' ; FASSBINDER ' S STORY OF INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE AND RACISM IS DRIVEN BY THE GERMAN FILMMAKER ' S FERVOR AND HONESTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During the late ' 60s and early ' 70s , Rainer Werner Fassbinder was the tireless road_runner of the German cinema . Between 1969 and 1973 , the politically minded filmmaker churned_out 19 movies , a prodigious amount by any standard . Fassbinder didn ' t waste any time between projects -- he ' d finish one in the morning and start another by afternoon . It was during this particularly fertile period that Fassbinder made &quot; Ali -- Fear Eats the Soul , &quot; a story about an interracial marriage between an elderly German washerwoman and a younger Moroccan worker . The 1973 release ( screening tonight at Saddleback College ) is characteristic of the Fassbinder style , meaning it explores injustice and intolerance in human terms . Fassbinder has been described as a quixotic figure in the international film scene , simply because his commitment to creating challenging movies was often tested by a public , and even many critics , that neglected his work . * A fuller appreciation of his career came_after 1982 , when Fassbinder was found slumped over an editing table , a cigarette between his fingers , apparently the victim of a drug overdose . He ' s remembered these days as a director with an irrepressible social vision and the willfulness to match . &quot; Ali &quot; was one of the early films that did reach a fairly large audience . It was his first to open in London and it went_on to win the critics ' prize at the 1974 Cannes International Film Festival . The tale is melodramatic , which is typical of Fassbinder . Emmi ( Brigitte Mira ) meets the shy Ali ( El Hedi Ben Salem ) in an isolated bar she has ducked into to escape a rainstorm . Despite their backgrounds and ages ( he ' s at least 20 years younger ) , they discover how alike they are . Their openness and compassion link them , but their friends and neighbors aren ' t so generous . Ali and Emmi are ostracized , and Fassbinder uses that to probe his themes of racism and Germans ' distrust of foreigners . &quot; Ali &quot; is , like many of Fassbinder ' s movies , slight and messy , but it ' s driven by his usual fervor and honesty . There ' s a sense that he was working fast , through a compellingly personal inspiration , and that gives the film a rare vitality . The picture also features one of Fassbinder ' s better-known scenes , coming soon after Emmi and Ali meet . They begin to dance , his cheek tight against her forehead , eyes closed_in something approaching bliss . She clutches him but gazes out , a shade of anxiety to her face . The passage is about love and need , but it ' s also about fear and foreboding . * Rainer Werner Fassbinder ' s &quot; Ali -- Fear Eats the Soul &quot; will screen tonight at 7 at Saddleback College ' s Science / Math Building , room 313 , 28000 Marguerite Parkway , Mission Viejo .
