   <TEXT> The Scene : Wednesday ' s premiere of Columbia and Castle Rock ' s &quot; City_Slickers II : The Legend of Curly ' s Gold &quot; at the Motion_Picture Academy . Four blocks of red_carpet went from the theater to the party in an enclosed lot at Wilshire and Palm . With 1 # 700 guests marching , this was a Beverly Hills-style cattle drive . Will There Be a Third ? In his speech before the screening , Billy Crystal joked that he was considering two sequels : &quot; When Harry Left Sally , &quot; and &quot; City_Slickers III : Beating a Dead Horse. &quot; Who Was There : The film ' s stars -- Crystal , Jack Palance , Daniel Stern , Jon Lovitz and Patricia Wettig -- and director Paul Weiland ; plus guests including Rita Rudner ; James Coburn ; Carl Reiner ; David Spade ; Ron Silver ; James Woods ; Castle Rock ' s Alan Horn , Martin Shafer and Rob Reiner ; Columbia ' s Peter Guber and Mark Canton . Also on_hand were co-screenwriters Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz . &quot; For those who ask if that ' s his real name , it ' s not , &quot; said Crystal . &quot; It ' s Al Ganz. &quot; Fashion Statement : To go_with the film ' s Western setting there was a sprinkling of cowboy_boots , blue_jeans and bolo_ties . Although one woman from New York said , &quot; Fashion ? What fashion ? Cowboy_boots are not fashion. &quot; Jack ' s Been Around a Long_Time : When asked what was the best part about doing the movie , Palance replied , &quot; Getting paid. &quot; The Oscar winner doesn ' t like seeing himself on screen , so he slipped_away to have a turkey sandwich and mashed potatoes at Kate Mantilini ' s during the screening . When it was mentioned that Palance hadn ' t seen either of the &quot; City_Slicker &quot; films , Crystal said : &quot; Listen , he hasn ' t seen ' Shane ' yet. &quot; Signs of the Start of the Summer Movie Season : Stars clutch bottles of Evian water as they enter screenings . And studio execs talk despondently about the competition : &quot; It ' s a blood bath , &quot; said one . &quot; There ' s going_to be a_few big hits and a lot of slaughter. &quot; Of course , he was one of the more optimistic . Money Matters : The party was free for guests , but Castle Rock made a $ 25 # 000 donation to Comic Relief . And two $ 180 # 000 checks ( part of the $ 7.8 million raised at Comic Relief VI ) were presented to the Venice Family Clinic and Homeless Health_Care L.A. Why It Was Good to Have an Outdoor Party : A screenwriter rhapsodizing on what is rapidly becoming the semi-illicit joy of smoking : &quot; It ' s your best_friend . It picks you up , it calms you down . You only have_sex because a cigarette tastes better afterward. &quot;</TEXT>
