   <HEADLINE> MAJOR EARTHQUAKE IN BOLIVIA IS FELT AS FAR AWAY AS TORONTO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A major earthquake rumbled through northern Bolivia on Wednesday and was reportedly felt as far away as Los Angeles and Toronto , the U.S. Geological Survey said . No injuries or serious damage were immediately reported . The quake , which struck a relatively unpopulated area roughly 200 miles northeast of the Bolivian capital , La Paz , had a magnitude of between 7.5 and 8 , officials at the Geological Survey said . A large swath of North_America was jolted by the quake . It was felt as &quot; a very gentle motion &quot; in Los Angeles , said Jim Mori , head of the U.S. Geological Survey in Southern California , at a news_conference in Pasadena . Tremors were also felt in Toronto , the Minneapolis area , Sioux Falls , S.D. , Omaha and Baja California . In Sioux_City , Iowa , Jane Eckerman said she felt the tremors for two to three minutes at her home . &quot; My daughter jumped_out of her chair like someone bit her . It was so weird , &quot; Eckerman told the Sioux_City Journal . In Chile , police said thousands of people took_to the streets in panic in Arica , Iquique , Calama and other cities . Power and telephone_service were knocked_out in several cities . Hundreds of people also fled buildings in La Paz , officials said . Officials said the earthquake , which struck at 5:33 p.m. PDT , appeared to have been very deep , about 400 miles below Earth ' s surface . &quot; The result was that people felt it all_over North_America , 5 # 000 miles away from the source , &quot; Mori said . He said earthquake waves travel much more efficiently from that depth , but he added , &quot; we would n ' t expect a lot of damage even near the source because it ' s so deep. &quot; Mori added that the experience with such unusal earthquakes is that there are far fewer aftershocks than occur in such quakes as Northridge , which are much closer to the surface .</TEXT>
