   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 ROUND OF 16 ; SPOTLIGHT ; PRIORITIES IN ORDER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the first things Jorge and Eduardo Solari did when they came_to Riyadh to coach the Saudi_Arabia national team four months before the World Cup_finals was develop a training schedule . &quot; As soon as we turned it in , they gave it back , &quot; Eduardo said . The Solaris , from Argentina , did not leave time for the players to pray . &quot; We had to adopt our training to their prayer times , &quot; Solari said . &quot; That doesn ' t happen anywhere else. &quot; The Solaris were speaking_to a member of the royal_family before their World Cup match against Morocco when the conversation stopped suddenly . &quot; I need to pray , &quot; he told them . &quot; He went_to a corner of the room and looked toward Mecca and prayed . You could be buying a house or a car , but when it ' s time to pray they close everything . Everything can wait except their faith , &quot; Solari said . ELLIOTT ALMOND</TEXT>
