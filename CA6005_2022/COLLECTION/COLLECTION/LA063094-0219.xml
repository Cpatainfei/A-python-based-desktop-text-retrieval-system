   <HEADLINE> SOCIALIST NAMED PREMIER IN JAPAN ; ASIA : TOMIICHI MURAYAMA IS CHOSEN WITH SUPPORT OF HIS PARTY ' S ARCHENEMIES . ANALYSTS EXPECT GREATER STRAIN ON U.S. TRADE RELATIONS , WHILE TOKYO BUSINESS WORLD IS SHOCKED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan ' s wild politics took a stunning turn Wednesday as Socialist Tomiichi Murayama withstood the vigorous opposition of two former prime_ministers and won this nation ' s top job -- with the support of his party ' s archenemies . Murayama ' s election as prime_minister -- he is the first Socialist to hold the position since the postwar poverty and confusion of 1947 -- sent shocks through the Japanese business world and was expected to raise alarm in Washington as well . that ' s because Japan ' s Socialists have espoused views that disturb many , both here and abroad . They have , for example , held the Communist government of North_Korea in warm regard and have demanded that Japan reject any sanctions against Pyongyang over its resistance to inspections of its nuclear facilities . The Socialists have advocated the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty , though they have tempered their position . They argue that Japan ' s own armed forces are &quot; unconstitutional but legal , &quot; and they oppose opening their nation ' s agricultural markets . Analysts said Murayama ' s election will place new strains on U.S.-Japan trade relations because his government will probably be even less accommodating to the United States and largely unwilling to dismantle regulations that protect farmers ' -- or workers ' -- jobs . As he began work to form a Cabinet this morning , Murayama acknowledged &quot; the selection of me , a person with no experience , has created a feeling of uneasiness in various circles. &quot; He said he wanted to &quot; put people ' s minds at ease. &quot; The left-leaning Socialists , of course , will be reined_in as they try to translate their ideology into practice and as they became part of a once-unimaginable coalition that will now attempt to govern Japan . Their most powerful partners will be members of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party . The Liberal Democrats have been the Socialists ' bane , often ridiculing them , and key LDP leaders -- including the two former prime_ministers -- fought a pitched battle Wednesday to prevent the ascension of Murayama , 70 , the seventh of 11 children of a fisherman . After the Liberal Democrats approved Murayama as their candidate to succeed Tsutomu Hata , who resigned as prime_minister Saturday , former Prime_Minister Toshiki Kaifu suddenly declared himself a candidate for Japan ' s top job . Bolting the Liberal Democrats less than two hours before the election , Kaifu , who was known as &quot; Mr. Reform &quot; when he served from 1989 to 1991 , said he was acting to &quot; preserve political reform. &quot; &quot; I cannot bring myself to write the name of Murayama on the ballot , &quot; Kaifu said of his opponent , who entered politics after a career as an activist and leader , first in a fishermen ' s union and then in the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers Union . Yasuhiro Nakasone , another former prime_minister , noted the significant foreign_policy challenges looming now for Japan , including a July 8-10 economic summit of major industrial nations in Naples , Italy , and the continuing North_Korean crisis . He declared that he could not back a Socialist like Murayama because it &quot; runs counter to the national interest. &quot; Before the balloting , Nakasone declared : &quot; To protect Japan ' s destiny , I support Kaifu. &quot; But by a vote of 261-214 ( with 29 void ballots ) , Murayama -- who has served as a city and prefectural assemblyman , a member of the lower house of Parliament since 1972 and chairman of his party since September -- won the runoff election . Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe said in_advance that he would vote against Murayama -- and he did . In all , 42 members of the Japan Socialist_Party , the Liberal Democratic Party and the New Party Harbinger that joined the new coalition failed to follow party orders in the runoff , conducted 2 1 / 2 hours before Parliament ended its session . Morihiro Hosokawa , another former prime_minister , called the newest coalition government &quot; an illicit union , &quot; noting that it links two parties with almost diametrically opposing views . Ironically , the Socialists , who had long been staunch opponents of the LDP , gave the Liberal Democrats back a chunk of the clout they lost last summer after 38 years of unilateral rule . &quot; At last , we have returned to power , &quot; declared Yoshiro Mori , the LDP ' s second in command . In a meeting that ended at almost 4 this morning , Murayama , Masayoshi Takemura , the Harbinger leader , and Yohei Kono , the LDP president , agreed to dub Murayama ' s government &quot; the dove Cabinet &quot; to promote peace . They also agreed to end decision-making by bureaucrats and run a government led by politicians . They rejected a Finance Ministry demand to guarantee to legislate by the end of the year a future increase in the 3 % consumption tax . Instead , they promised only to &quot; make efforts &quot; to pass tax reforms by December . Some Hata supporters predicted that Japan ' s newest prime_minister , the seventh in the last five years , will preside , as his immediate predecessor had , over an unstable , short-lived government . Hata served 63 days , the briefest period of any prime_minister under the postwar constitution . But with the Liberal Democrats accepting all Socialist demands on immediate policy issues , the first foreseeable clash of interests may_not come until next summer , when an upper house election is scheduled . A large_number of Socialists and Liberal Democrats will be running against each other at that time . Even before then , Murayama -- who has never before served as a Cabinet_minister -- will be forced to tackle utterly unfamiliar challenges . He is , for example , to meet with President Clinton -- who issued a statement saying he looks_forward to working with the Murayama government -- before the Naples summit to discuss the North_Korea issue and U.S. demands for a framework governing U.S.-Japan trade . This will be Murayama ' s first plunge into international diplomacy -- and may give the earliest indications of what many analysts predict may be the single area of greatest change under the Socialists : foreign_policy . Both the Socialists and the New Party Harbinger oppose Japan ' s joining the U.N. Security_Council as a permanent member with veto rights , saying to do so would force Japan to develop a coherent foreign_policy and take clear stands on a host of issues it now often ignores . Murayama and Takemura have expressed particular concern over the possibility that Japan would be coerced into dispatching Japanese troops to participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations . The U.N. issue is just part of a broader debate over foreign_policy . Hata ' s forces -- especially Ichiro Ozawa , his chief strategist -- strongly sought a permanent Security_Council seat and advocated that Japan assume more international responsibility and play a greater global role , including in U.N. peacekeeping missions . Takemura , a former Liberal Democrat who bolted the party in June , 1993 , clashed with both Ozawa and Hosokawa , under whom he served as chief Cabinet secretary . Although he and his party voted for Hata as prime_minister in April , he refused to join Hata ' s Cabinet . Kaifu insisted that he had consulted no one before hurling his bombshell and condemning the party in which he served for 35 years . But the instant support he won from all seven parties and splinter_groups of Hata ' s coalition belied his disavowal . His action bore the marks of a plot by Ozawa , who has long advocated splitting the Socialists and the Liberal Democrats to create a viable system of two parties -- instead of the current 15 -- capable of changing government periodically . All Wednesday , Ozawa stubbornly insisted that the Socialists specify the percentage to which they would agree to raise the current 3 % consumption tax three years from now in exchange for implementing income_tax cuts_to spur the economy now . The demand , which went unmet , appeared designed to shove the Socialists , who walked_out_of Hata ' s coalition in April , into the arms of the Liberal Democrats -- and precipitate precisely the rebellion that occurred in the ranks of both parties . The only trouble was that the rebellion , carried_out without a head_count , fell_short . NHK , the semi-governmental television network , calculated that 61 rebels , including 36 Liberal Democrats , voted against their party ' s orders on the first ballot , which required a majority . Murayama won 241 votes , 12 shy of the required majority ; Kaifu polled 220 , precipitating the runoff . But as the lower house recessed , a pro_forma ballot in the upper house gave Murayama an overwhelming victory of 61 % of the votes , or enough to deflate the uprising . Although the defeat doomed Hata ' s coalition to opposition status , the fight added 31 votes to its ranks and created a pool of potential defectors within the incoming coalition . &quot; Now , we have a healthy opposition party , &quot; declared Kozo Watanabe , a member of the Renewal Party led by Hata and Ozawa . &quot; I don ' t really feel_like we were defeated. &quot; * RELATED STORIES : D1 , D2</TEXT>
