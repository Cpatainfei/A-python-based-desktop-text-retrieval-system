   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; U.S. FINDS ITSELF ON THE HOT_SEAT ; FIRST ROUND : GAME AGAINST SWITZERLAND IN EXPECTED HUMIDITY OF SILVERDOME SHAPES UP AS A MUST-WIN SITUATION FOR BOTH TEAMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They have brought it on themselves , the players and their leader . If there is pressure on the U.S. World Cup team to advance beyond the first round -- and there is , to a considerable degree -- the team can blame its own sporadic success and the brash prediction of the president of the U.S. Soccer Federation , a man well familiar_with hyperbole . &quot; We are a lead-pipe cinch to get_out of the first round , &quot; Alan Rothenberg said . He made that bold and hopeful boast months ago . But it comes_home to roost today , when the United States opens its World Cup campaign against Switzerland in the Silverdome . The U.S. players are hoping they don ' t have to dine on Rothenberg ' s words . Not since 1930 , when the United States was invited to play in the World Cup in Uruguay , has an American team made_it to the second round . It is a fact that rides uncomfortably against another : Never has the host team failed to make_it past the first round . All of which makes today ' s game something of a must-win situation . U.S. coaches , U.S. Soccer Federation officials and , until recently , U.S. players , all have commented that to advance , they must beat Switzerland . The theory is that among the Group_A teams , which include Colombia and Romania , Switzerland is the team the United States has_the_best chance to beat . In the_Swiss camp , of course , the sentiment is the same about the vulnerability of the United States . The constant drumbeat of must-win has receded recently and been replaced by a let ' s-be-sensible approach , which notes that if the Americans can ' t earn the three points for a victory over the_Swiss , there are always Colombia on June 22 and Romania on June 26 . &quot; We want to win , yes , everybody wants to win , &quot; U.S. midfielder John Harkes said . &quot; But it ' s not devastating if we don ' t win the first game . It ' s not like if we lose against Switzerland , our hopes have gone and we will wither away. &quot; Harkes was_on the U.S. World Cup team in 1990 , the much-maligned &quot; bunch of college kids , &quot; the youngest team in the tournament with an average age of 24 . Six players on this team were_on the 1990 team , and each professes to be eager to erase the memory of three consecutive losses . &quot; We are a different team , better and more experienced , &quot; said Tab Ramos , another veteran of 1990 . The USSF has spent millions to make_sure the team is different . In Italy , U.S. players were encamped in a bleak facility in Tirrenia and visited with their families through bars in a fence . This team is ensconced in a posh resort at Dana Point and works_out at a multimillion-dollar training center built to the specifications of Coach Bora Milutinovic . It is the presence of Milutinovic , more_than anything , that has raised the expectations of the team . Indeed , so influential has Milutinovic been that the team has taken_on his unpredictable personality , showing flashes of brilliance amid periods of mediocrity . Milutinovic ' s coyness with reporters extends_to the team as well . No player , with the possible exception of goalkeeper Tony Meola , has been told if he is starting , and the defenders have not been told if the team will play with four backs in a flat formation or with a sweeper who roams behind three defenders . Milutinovic probably will play the four-back scheme against Switzerland . In the four-back system , Thomas Dooley plays as a defensive midfielder , where he can help initiate the offense while also being available to mark an opponent . The suggestion that Harkes play_at right back rather than in the midfield appears to have been rejected . That means the defense will line_up with Alexi Lalas , Marcelo Balboa , Cle Kooiman and Paul Caligiuri . With Claudio Reyna nursing a strained hamstring , the midfield figures to be manned by Ramos , Dooley , Mike Sorber and Harkes . Eric Wynalda will play_at forward and Ernie Stewart at striker . From Switzerland , the United States can expect an organized , disciplined attack . &quot; They put pressure on the ball , but at_the_same_time they have some weaknesses we can exploit , &quot; U.S. assistant coach Timo Liekoski said . &quot; If we win the ball early enough , I think it ' s important that we try to play the ball forward quickly so they can ' t set_up defensively. &quot; Pressure-cooker conditions will probably prevail in the Silverdome . The plexiglass-covered arena is likely to be a cozy , humid environment for the revolutionary indoor grass , a pampered lawn that was cultivated in Camarillo , Calif. , and nurtured in the Silverdome parking_lot . If they could spend $ 1.5 million on grass , you ' d think someone might have been able to spring for an air conditioner , but the Silverdome , seldom used in the summer , has none -- and temperatures in the Midwest the last few days have been in the 90s , with high humidity . When Germany and England played here last summer , the players raved about the condition of the field but most estimated they had lost eight to 10 pounds of water weight in sauna-like conditions . Switzerland included a visit to a sauna as part of its preparation . In truth , however , little can be done about the sticky heat . &quot; It ' s not a great factor , but it is a factor , &quot; said U.S. assistant coach Steve Sampson . &quot; At this level and in this competition , every factor_in the game becomes important. &quot;</TEXT>
