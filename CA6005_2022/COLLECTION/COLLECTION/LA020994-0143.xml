   <HEADLINE> BRIEFING BOOK / WILLIAM R . LONG : INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; CHILE FOUNDATION JOINS ALLIANCES TO EXPAND , DEVELOP EXPORTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ISSUE : Among the many schemes for fostering economic development in Latin_America , perhaps none has been more imaginative -- or practical -- than Fundacion Chile ( Chile Foundation ) . It isn ' t the Peace Corps , it isn ' t a government subsidy program , it isn ' t foreign_aid . It is a nonprofit corporation known for its success in pioneering business ventures aimed at transferring technology and diversifying the country ' s exports . Since it was formed 17 years ago , the foundation has started 31 businesses and helped stimulate Chile ' s growing entrepreneurial prowess through the examples of those companies . Chilean capitalists have become so aggressively competitive that the need for Fundacion Chile as a creator of companies is diminishing . As a result , the foundation is now helping with risk assessment , management training , consulting services , technical assistance and technological research and development . BACKGROUND : Chile ' s economy was a mess in 1973 , when the military seized power in a violent coup against an elected government led by Socialists and Communists . The overthrown government had expropriated the Chilean Telephone Co . from ITT Corp. , and the new government paid ITT more_than $ 100 million in compensation for the nationalized company . In 1976 , the government and ITT joined forces to start Fundacion Chile , each contributing half of a $ 50-million endowment . ITT managed the foundation for its first 10 years . The 31 businesses that Fundacion Chile has started since 1976 are mostly in agriculture , seafood production , forestry and wood products . Some of the ventures have been remarkably successful at transferring productive technology to Chile and developing new export lines . In salmon farming , for example , Fundacion Chile helped pioneer an industry that has made Chile the world ' s No . 2 exporter of the fish , after Norway . It has also contributed to expansion of Chilean berry exports . Equally important have been the foundation ' s services to the private sector in areas such_as quality_control and certification , technical research and marketing studies . Fundacion Chile ' s success is widely recognized in Latin_America . The group is often contracted for consultations , project planning and training . &quot; We are providing help to almost all countries in Latin_America , &quot; said Juan Eduardo Prado , the foundation ' s corporate affairs manager . In neighboring Bolivia , Fundacion Chile helped plan Fundacion Bolivia Exporta , a similar foundation that is supported by the World_Bank and the_Netherlands . OUTLOOK : Companies created by the foundation that have served their demonstration purposes are sold_off to private investors . A dozen have already been sold . One of them , a salmon farm and processing operation , went_to Nippon Suisan Kaisha of Tokyo for $ 22 million . More foundation companies in seafood and agribusiness are being offered for_sale . &quot; We have a salmon company that is ready to go , &quot; said Anthony Wylie , Fundacion Chile ' s director general . At midyear , after the harvest season , the foundation hopes to sell a 200-acre farm with drip irrigation and sprinkler_systems . The farm produces raspberries , blackberries , currants and asparagus . Also for_sale will be a produce export company with freezing and cold-storage plants . Meanwhile , although the foundation plans to put less emphasis on starting new companies , Wylie said it will still be looking_for good joint_ventures . STRATEGY : Fundacion Chile seeks to make alliances designed for technology transfer and marketing . The idea is to join forces with businesses abroad that already have experience in market niches that can be supplied by Chilean producers . The foundation can provide some investment capital and local technical knowledge , especially in forestry , marine resources and agribusiness . It also offers contacts and experience in the Chilean business environment . In return , it is looking_for technology with an assured foreign market that can be assimilated and adapted to Chilean production conditions . &quot; We ' re not looking_for wacky inventions . We ' re looking_for things that have been proven . . . to be commercially viable , &quot; said Wylie , an Anglo Chilean with a doctorate in plant physiology from University of California , Davis . He said the foundation ' s strategy is to seek ways of adding value to Chilean products before they are exported , such_as making furniture parts from wood or processing fish , fruits and vegetables . &quot; It could be juices ; it could be different ways of packaging fresh products , &quot; he said . If the foundation is not the right partner for a project , it could help find a Chilean company that would be , Wylie said . For some investment projects , touching_base with Fundacion Chile could be a worthwhile step . The sectors in which the group specializes are among the most dynamic and promising in the Chilean economy -- but also among the most competitive . The foundation offers a range of options for collaboration and service designed to reduce investment risk .</TEXT>
