   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; COMMENTARY ; REST EASY , THERE IS LIFE AFTER THE CUP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the last 30 days , we were the World Cup in Los Angeles . It has been fabulously fun . But in 90 minutes or so , it will be forever gone . Rai , we hardly knew ye . Actually , it ' s like a honeymoon without the marriage . And now , we must move_on with our lives . ( Actually , when I say we , I mean you . As for me , I ' ll just be shifting slightly on the couch. ) The World Cup has dominated our attention -- well , except for the O.J. Simpson case and that Tabitha the Cat thing -- and it is time for us to refocus . How does Pasadena adjust to post-World Cup America ? Will there be L.A. strife after World Cup life ? What ' s the deal with Todd Donaho ? These are the questions that must be asked and these are the questions that must be answered . I took a moment out from the World Cup third-place game to address as_many important inquiries as I could : Question : The end of the World Cup leaves a big hole . How can people effectively cope_with this ? Answer : The best way to deal with stress is to eat well . Crenshaw melons are 29 cents a pound this week at Ralphs , pork_loin roast -- rib end or sirloin end -- is $ 1.19 a pound at Hughes and Nestle Bon Bons are $ 1.99 at Vons . ( Prices effective until Wednesday ; all items not available in all stores. ) Q : But food cannot fully alleviate the psychological letdown , the emotional vacuum , the subconscious dissonance left by the loss of such an important element in our lives . Freud argued that addiction is a state of pathological fusion and that the addict finds comfort in areas of potential space that re-evoke infantile mergings and that only through the process of immersive transference can cathexis truly be impactful . A : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Just watch Arena Football on ESPN Saturday nights -- similar game , higher scoring . Q : What exactly are you saying about the future of U.S. soccer ? A : Major_League Soccer in this country has about as much chance as Madonna at a eunuchs ' convention . Q : But that Adidas ad says , &quot; Soccer ' s Not Coming To America . It ' s Already Here. &quot; A : Yeah , well , if it ' s already here , nobody ' s there . Q : Surely some of the stars of the U.S. team are here to stay as major figures on the sporting scene . A : By next June , Alexi Lalas is an assistant manager at Jiffy Lube . Q : What ' s next for Alan Rothenberg ? A : Baseball commissioner or Rebuild L.A. Q : And Bora ? A : Bora who ? Q : SoccerFest ? A : Empty nest . Q : Seriously , what are we supposed to do without World Cup ? A : Listen , buddy , I ' m already into Davis Cup . Back_off , Jack . Q : What will happen to the 30-foot inflatable soccer_ball tethered outside the Rose Bowl ? A : It will be reconverted for use as an Accident Investigation Site ( AIS ) along the 405 . Q : Man , what ' s to become of all this worthless , leftover World Cup merchandise that went unsold ? A : Check the expanded and newly eclectic &quot; Books Near $ 5 &quot; table at Crown for the best bargains . Q : The prissy people of Pasadena thumbed their noses at the possibility of the Raiders and their unruly fans playing_at the Rose Bowl , so how come they let the_likes_of World Cup hooligans into their pretentiously precious hamlet ? A : Most Brazilians speak English better than most Raider fans . Q : Will most out-of-town soccer fans be staying in L.A. for the NFL season ? A : No , but most football fans in L.A. might have to go_out of town for the NFL season . Q : Many of us have become accustomed to watching KMEX daily for Univision ' s soccer coverage . What will fill that void ? A : Although World Cup ' 94 , indeed , is television history after today , other KMEX programming worth sampling includes &quot; Las Dos Dianas , &quot; &quot; Mujer Prohibida , &quot; &quot; Muchachitas , &quot; &quot; Dos Mujeres , un Camino &quot; and , of course , &quot; La Chica TV . &quot; Q : Will there be any &quot; added time &quot; in this article ? A : Gosh , I hope not -- I ' m having trouble making_it to the end , as it is . Q : What becomes of Striker , the World Cup ' 94 mascot ? A : Modeled after the Motion_Picture &amp; Television Country_House in Woodland Hills , the Sports Mascot Retirement Home &amp; Manor in Los Alamitos has drawn a wide-based clientele . Among those currently residing -- or giving future commitments -- to the home are Cobi , Chief Noc-a-homa , the Phillie Phanatic , the San Diego Chicken , Hugo the Hornet , Stuff the Magic Dragon , Tommy Trojan , Dancing Barry , Dancing Harry , Dyan Cannon , Crazy George and Whatizit . There is a separate wing on the grounds occupied solely by Morganna the Kissin ' Bandit . Q : How come Maradona was sent home early ? A : Sav-on was out of Sudafed . Q : Some people not Rose Bowl-bound will be having a Super Bowl-style World Cup Sunday party at_home . What ' s a good thing to serve while watching the World Cup telecast ? A : During the game , we recommend a nice Hungarian braised pork stew with a side_dish of baked acorn_squash and a raspberry-cream bombe dessert . For the postgame , peanuts are good .</TEXT>
