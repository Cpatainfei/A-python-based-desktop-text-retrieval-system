   <TEXT> ON THE RACK : Don ' t think you ' ve got a bootleg if you pick_up a copy of Nirvana ' s &quot; In Utero &quot; at Kmart or Wal-Mart and find the song &quot; Rape Me &quot; retitled &quot; Waif Me &quot; on the cover . The stores , which have long resisted what they consider offensive material , reportedly refused to carry the album unless Geffen Records ' DGC label changed the song title.While that has been done , the song itself -- which is about media intrusions into privacy , not physical rape -- remains unchanged . But DGC did make some content changes on another of its albums , Beck ' s &quot; Mellow Gold , &quot; electronically blurring some four-letter_words . Robert Smith , Geffen ' s head of marketing , says that the changes -- made only on copies of the albums destined for the stores that won ' t carry the original versions -- do nothing to alter the messages of the artists , and that the compromises are more_than compensated for by the access to a wider audience . These stores , referred to in the trade as rack jobbers , represent about 10 % of the music retail business , and many of them are in rural_areas that have no other music stores . &quot; Both Beck and Nirvana as artists are dealing with the anguish of living in the world today , so the spelling of a word or the use of a word doesn ' t really change that , &quot; Smith says . &quot; It ' s much more important to give kids access to these messages. &quot; &quot; ( Nirvana ) wants the record in K mart , &quot; says Janet Billig of Gold Mountain Management , which handles both Beck and Nirvana . &quot; that ' s the kind of store where they got records growing_up . They didn ' t have cool record stores in Aberdeen , ( Wash. ) . &quot; Steve Hochman</TEXT>
