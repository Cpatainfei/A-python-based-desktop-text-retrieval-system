   <HEADLINE> ' BOOZE BANDITS ' THREATEN NATIONAL INDUSTRY , BRITISH PUB OWNERS SAY ; COMMERCE : CROSS-CHANNEL TRIPS TO BUY LIQUOR , BEER , WINE ARE SAID TO ROB TREASURY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pub keepers call them &quot; booze bandits &quot; and warn that their cross-Channel activities threaten the national brewing industry . Liquor_store owners say these passengers on &quot; booze cruises &quot; are eroding their profits . The government claims these shoppers are costing the treasury as much as $ 750 million a year in vanished taxes . Just who are these scofflaws ? They ' re ordinary British citizens with a taste for the grape and a willingness to take_advantage of the first year of the European Union ' s single market . They ' re doing so by buying liquor , wine and beer by the case -- and often by the 175-case pallet -- at dirt-cheap prices in French ferry ports like Calais and Dunkirk . They then haul the bottles and cans in vans and cars back by ferry to England . Under European Union rules , citizens may buy unlimited quantities of liquor for &quot; personal use. &quot; But just what constitutes &quot; personal &quot; use remains something of a mystery -- to be decided by customs agents in Dover , Folkestone and other Channel ports . As a customs official puts it : &quot; Our guidelines suggest that someone may bring_in more_than a normal amount , if they can prove they are holding a family party by showing us the invitations or something like that. &quot; What has caused the shopping boom along the_French coast -- the spree peaked over the holiday season with an estimated 1 million Britons making the Channel crossing -- is cheaper French-bought wine , liquor and beer ; the price differences are mainly attributable to much lower national taxes . A 24-can case of Stella Artois beer that costs $ 31.50 in Britain goes_for $ 8 on French shelves ; a liter of gin that sells for $ 22.50 in England costs $ 16.50 in France ; wine is available in Calais at half the price in Britain . One big-spending British customer in Calais claimed to have saved almost $ 4 # 000 on his bill after loading_up a van at a huge liquor_store outside town called Eastenders ( named after the_English television soap_opera ) . The Calais Chamber_of_Commerce says 13 million gallons of beer flowed back to Britain in 1993 , representing a quarter of the total beer market in all_of Northern France . But what has proved a bonanza to British boozers has riled British brewers , publicans and liquor_store proprietors . &quot; We estimate that 10 # 000 pubs could go_out of business because of French competition , &quot; said Catherine Chenery , spokeswoman for the Brewers ' Society . &quot; that ' s one out of six by the end of the century . We have lost about $ 375 million in sales this year alone. &quot; The British Wine &amp; Spirit Assn . estimates that wine sales in Britain are down by 10 % this year with sales off by some $ 740 million . Alan Meale , a Labor member_of_Parliament , warned after a recent inspection trip to Calais : &quot; If this isn ' t stopped , every pub in Britain and every brewery in Britain will close_down , and we ' ll all be sipping beer from little glasses_in wine bars at 2 pounds ( $ 3.50 ) a go. &quot; The problem as British brewers and merchants see it is Britain ' s high taxes . While British brewing production_costs are the second lowest in the European Union ( next to Portugal ) , its taxes are the second highest ( after Ireland ) . &quot; We tax beer at 31 pence per pint , &quot; Chenery of the Brewers ' Society said . &quot; The French tax at 4 pence per pint. &quot; Customs officials take a calmer view of the tax_rates , though the treasury is dropping -- by some estimates up_to $ 750 million yearly in lost taxes . But they predict that liquor and beer taxes will be lowered , as occurred in Denmark when Danes flocked to Germany to buy cheaper beer and schnapps . Customs officials suggest that British brewing profit_margins are much higher than those on the Continent and that the beer industry could cut_back on profits to become more competitive . Competition is why , they say , Continentals come_to Britain to buy clothing and other items that are bargains by European standards . Customs agents are trying to crack_down on canny British Channel crossers who load_up with booze , which they then sell in Britain on the black_market to pub keepers , stores and friends ; this is supposed to be an illegal practice . A Brewers ' Society consultant estimates that a &quot; booze-cruiser &quot; with a medium-sized van could clear $ 1 # 500 a day , buying beer for $ 4.50 per 24-bottle case and selling it in Britain for $ 10.50. While many in Britain and France welcome the opening of the Channel_tunnel this year , Peter Lewis , director of the Wine &amp; Spirit Assn. , complains of the opportunities for dedicated booze shoppers : &quot; It will only exacerbate things further. &quot;</TEXT>
