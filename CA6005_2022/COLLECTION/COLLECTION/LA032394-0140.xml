   <TEXT> Quotable Mazza : A few pages before the Sephia review , Car and Driver gave Hyundai Motor America Inc. ' s chief_executive , Doug Mazza , a block of ink in its quote-of-the-month box . The Mazza-ism that caught the editors ' ears ? &quot; There ' s about a_million and a half cars that won ' t be sold ( in the United States in 1994 ) . The issue is , who is it who won ' t sell them ? &quot; Hyundai Motor America , based in Fountain Valley , certainly hopes that it won ' t be one of those that isn ' t selling . The company has aggressively upgraded its model line and at the end of this year will unveil a replacement for its inaugural -- and most troublesome -- offering , the Excel . It was the bargain basement-priced Excel that made Hyundai the fastest-growing new car importer in the mid-1980s . But mechanical problems that accompanied the Korean manufacturing_plant ' s rush to make as_many Excels as the U.S. market would absorb contributed to lingering image problems . The new car will be curvier , peppier and slightly smaller outside while -- through the wonders of ergonomic engineering -- providing slightly more passenger room inside . It is likely to start at or just under $ 8 # 000 .</TEXT>
