   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; DALAI LAMA ; USING NONVIOLENCE AGAINST A POWERFUL AUTHORITARIAN REGIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the veranda of his audience hall , in the shadow of the saw-toothed Outer Himalayas , Tibet ' s &quot; god-king , &quot; who lost his kingdom when the Chinese invaded , walks briskly forth to greet his people . More_than a_hundred visiting Tibetans crowd under the corrugated roof . At the appearance of the Dalai Lama , they bow low , many so in awe they dare not look him in the face . For them , the owl-eyed , bespectacled Buddhist monk with a passion for flowers and mending watches is their nation incarnate . The Dalai Lama fled into India in 1959 , following a failed revolt . Ironically , this apostle of nonviolence escaped the Chinese by grabbing a soldier ' s coat and rifle to disguise his identity . Now 58 , the spiritual head of Tibetans lives with his exile government in Dharamsala , in India ' s Himachal Pradesh state . Five years ago , he won the Nobel Peace Prize . He does not hide his regret that his commitment to using peaceful and democratic means to restore Tibet ' s freedom has not brought Beijing to the bargaining table -- despite Deng Xiaoping ' s assurances , in 1979 , that any option short of independence would be considered . They have not even been enticed by the high lama ' s 1988 proposal that Tibet be a self-governing entity in China , with the Chinese in_charge of foreign_policy and defense . Born Lhamo Dhondrub to a peasant woman with 16 children , the Dalai Lama was recognized at age 2 as the reincarnation of his predecessor , the 13th Dalai Lama , and thus an incarnation of Avalokitesvara , the Buddhist Bodhisattva of Compassion . Since 1642 , Tibet had been ruled by the Dalai Lama , whose title can be translated as &quot; ocean of wisdom. &quot; On April 28 , he met briefly with President Bill_Clinton in the office of Vice_President Al Gore . The format was designed to minimize offense to China . Nonetheless , Beijing accused Washington of &quot; serious interference &quot; in its internal affairs . Wearing burgundy socks that match his sleeveless monk ' s robe , the Dalai Lama spoke_for nearly an hour in a long , cool room off the porch where he receives delegations . Punctuating his words frequently with his infectious laughter , he talked_about policy toward China , Beijing ' s &quot; Final Solution &quot; for Tibet and his indomitable hopes for the future . * Question : Last March , in your address marking the 35th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising , you noted with dismay that your offers to talk have failed to elicit any positive reaction from the Chinese . Has your approach been an error ? Answer : I don ' t consider it a mistake . No . One of the main purposes of my proposal is to start meaningful negotiations with the Chinese government or to bring China to the negotiating table . That , so far , has failed . Another objective is to reduce Chinese-population transfer into Tibet . That also failed . However , for the past 14 years , my approach has raised more interest on the international level and made_it easier for foreign governments to support the Tibet issue . And then , in the eyes of ordinary Chinese people -- I mean intellectuals and students -- in their eyes , my approach is very reasonable and suitable . Q : But what can you do now ? A : I ' m waiting to see how much effect will be caused by international pressure on the Chinese government . So if , you see , that also fails -- doesn ' t produce a result -- then I am going_to ask the Tibetan people , outside ( Tibet ) as well as inside . The people outside I can ask openly in a referendum . Inside , through visitors , we can communicate . I can collect their views . Now , I would like to give them some few options . One option : My approach for the past 14 years . Another option is what critics say about my approach . They say we should stand_firm on independence . Q : Speaking of choices , the United States has to decide about China ' s most-favored-nation status by June 3 . As you know , last year President Bill_Clinton made this renewal conditional on Beijing achieving progress in certain human-rights categories , including safeguarding of Tibet ' s culture and religion . Do you think the United States should continue MFN for China ? A : The decision taken by the President last year was perfect . This year , I have no particular suggestion . However , I do feel it is very important to take a decision according to the wishes of the Chinese -- those Chinese who are really carrying_out the struggle for democracy and freedom . Q : So Chinese advocates for democracy should decide an issue that also concerns your homeland ? A : I feel the Tibet issue is very much linked with the overall Chinese policy or situation . So_long as the hard-line or authoritarian system remains there ( in Beijing ) , frankly speaking , there is not much chance for change . Q : It has been five years since the suppression of China ' s &quot; democracy spring. &quot; Reports from China now say apathy and the desire to grow rich seem to be replacing political consciousness . Who are you pinning your hopes on ? A : Usually , I make three categories among the Chinese . The top category is the leadership and the Communist_Party . Their main concern is keeping power in their hands . The second group I consider the most important . That is the intellectuals and the thinkers and the students . These people in the last several years have really carried_out a life-and-death struggle for democracy and freedom . This group is the force which ultimately will bring democracy in China . No one else . No outsider , not the United States , nobody , can bring democracy to China , except these people . Then third , the Chinese masses . Their main concern is their daily livelihood . They may_not be so concerned about democracy , but democracy is not much relevant in their day-to-day life . I think the entire future of China , and , I think , particularly this region of the planet , is very much linked to ( the second group ' s ) spirit and their work . So if their spirit diminishes , that is a disaster . Q : What of the argument that imposing economic sanctions on China is counterproductive because more two-way trade will foster greater democracy ? A : More economic prosperity ultimately affects political liberalization . That is logical . But in the meantime , there is a risk that the people in the second category get the impression that the outside world doesn ' t care about their struggle , that the outside world is content with the authoritarian regime in China . The outside world is very much concerned about Russian authoritarianism , but Chinese authoritarianism seems to be OK . If that kind of impression develops among the Chinese democratic movement , I think it will be very , very harmful . If they feel more pressure in the economic field is more useful , more effective , in_order to bring democracy in China and isolate these communist leaders in_the_public_eye , then ( the approach ) should be tougher . Once their spirit gets stronger , the democratic movement becomes stronger and political_leaders will be compelled to carry_out more liberalization . Liberalize China more , and I am 100 % sure we can have a true discussion and find a proper solution to the Tibetan problem . There ' s no doubt . After all , I am not insisting on complete separation from China . Q : And what of your critics who say you aren ' t hard-line enough ? A : Quite often they say , &quot; The Chinese know only force. &quot; It ' s not a generational matter . There are many , many elder Tibetans who think violence is the ultimate answer , too . Sometimes , perhaps , I think among the younger generation , there is more attraction toward Yasser Arafat or the moujahedeen in Afghanistan . They often tell me , &quot; Oh , look_at them . Through violence , there is more publicity , more support from the outside world. &quot; Q : And your reply ? A : First , my fundamental belief is that human nature lies_in gentleness . Human nature is compassionate , is affectionate . Therefore , using violence is against human nature . Secondly , because of this factor , violence creates a lot of hurt in the human mind . Therefore , through violence , you may solve one problem . But you sow the seeds for another . Then , there ' s our case . Tibetans and Chinese have to live side_by_side in the future . In the past , we lived like that . So in_order to live_in a friendly , peaceful and neighborly way , while we are carrying_out this freedom struggle , we must pursue nonviolence , so that our struggle will not affect our long , long friendship . Lastly , I ask the hotheads , let them visualize this . If we follow violent methods , a_few hundred guns will not be effective . At least we need several thousand , at least a_few thousand . . . around 100 # 000 . Now , from where will we get those weapons ? Is there some country willing to supply us with them ? Q : But are Tibetans benefiting from China ' s economic liberalization ? A : A few years ago , one European who spent some time in Tibet and knows something about economic_theory told me , &quot; In Tibet , there is certainly an economy , but it belongs_to the Chinese , not the Tibetans. &quot; Now , because of the Chinese population increasing , local people find even small manual jobs difficult to get . One part of the blame is the Tibetans ' themselves . They cannot work as hard as Chinese people -- as tailors or carpenters . Even a Tibetan-style painting is now painted by some Chinese ! The ordinary Tibetan finds it easier to ask a Chinese painter rather than a Tibetan . It ' s less costly , and you get the results quicker ! So you see , this gives an opportunity to the Chinese settler . Now that there ' s competition under the more liberal economic_system , in many cases , the Tibetans cannot compete with the Chinese . Q : You mentioned the influx of Chinese . Is it continuing ? A : In the name of more development , now the Chinese are demolishing the old part of Lhasa . According to our information , in 1959 , old Lhasa was three-square kilometers in size . Now it ' s become smaller : one-square kilometer . Only that . A few years ago , according to our calculations , the Tibetan population ( of Lhasa ) was about 50 # 000 , and the Chinese population around 100 # 000 . Now , the mayor has stated the total population at 400 # 000 . The Tibetan population is 100 # 000 , maximum . Q : With this huge population disparity , can Tibetans survive as a distinct nation ? A : Time is running_out . In fact , I think the Chinese leaders are thinking exactly on these lines . To the outside world , they have stated they are open_to dialogue with the Dalai Lama . But whenever we approach them , there ' s no response . The latest policy is to completely suppress ( the Tibetans ) , and in the meantime , to increase the Chinese population , so that in a_few years time , the Tibetans become insignificant in their own land . Some of my friends call this the &quot; Final Solution &quot; of Tibet . Q : So Tibet is doomed ? A : I do believe that the international situation is now changing , and particularly , as I mentioned earlier , that there are democratic forces in China proper . So actually , the present Chinese government , the authoritarian regime , is in a state of transition . So I ' m quite hopeful . Q : You are somewhat of an expert on reincarnation . The Chinese leadership is of a certain age . On July 6 , you turn 59 . How do you see the future ? A : In the Chinese case , it ' s very difficult to predict . Even the Chinese themselves do not know what will happen . So I think they are very , very anxious about what will come_after Deng Xiaoping . In the Tibetan case , I don ' t know . While I ' m alive , I ' ll do my best . After my death , then other people , the new generation , will manage . Q : So there will be no 15th Dalai Lama ? What ' s to stop Beijing or Tibetan communists from announcing that you have been reincarnated as a member of the Chinese Communist_Party ? A : If something happened today to me or my life were to cease , if the Tibetan people want another reincarnation or want another Dalai Lama , then certainly my reincarnation , my rebirth will take_place among Tibetans . And not among Chinese ! Because the real purpose of reincarnation is continuing the previous life ' s work . That means while we are outside ( Tibet ) , if I pass_away , then certainly if the Tibetan people want another reincarnation , they will find it among Tibetans , and not in Chinese hands . But if death takes_place at the time when we have already returned to Tibet , and there is some kind of freedom there , I have officially stated that the Tibetan people should decide whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue or not . If people feel there ' s not much relevant about this institution , then it will automatically cease . that ' s no problem. *</TEXT>
