   <HEADLINE> GOING TO EXTREMES ; &quot; IF YOU FALL , YOU DIE &quot; --that ' s ONE WAY TO DEFINE EXTREME SKIING . SOMETIMES , IT ' S TRUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> PAUL RUFF SCOOPED_UP A HANDFUL OF SNOW , PACKED IT INTO A BALL AND overhanded it into the abyss below Lake Tahoe ' s Thimble Peak . Five long seconds passed , then came a reply . &quot; More to the left ! &quot; called a faint voice . It was March 29 , 1993 , and Ruff was perched on a narrow ledge above Thunder Bowl -- a natural amphitheater capped by 9 # 000-foot peaks on the backside of Kirkwood Ski Resort . Still tied to the rope he ' d used to belay himself from above , the 29-year-old extreme skier leaned out and strained to catch sight of his friend , Joe Gebhardt , standing far below . It was no use : The rope , secured by one of two Kirkwood Ski Patrol members who ' d gone_with him to the site , was just too short . When he ' d looked_up at this piece of mountainside two weeks before , Ruff had thought it looked perfect . He told his friends it would make_for close to 200 feet of &quot; monster air &quot; -- easily the biggest cliff jump anyone had ever attempted -- with a clear shot from top to bottom . But now , after climbing to the summit , roping himself in and sidestepping down 150 feet , he discovered he couldn ' t safely get close enough to the edge to see past the jagged rocks and snowy chutes that angled out below him to open snow . He knelt down , scrunched_up another snowball and , with a lurch , fastballed it over the edge . &quot; that ' s better , man , &quot; yelled Gebhardt , after watching the second snowball explode , like the first , on a patch of protruding rocks above him . &quot; But you gotta chuck it farther out ! &quot; Ruff let another one fly , then another . Gebhardt had watched Ruff jump many times before -- he ' d even followed him over a cliff or two -- but those leaps were nothing compared to this . Cliff jumpers typically took_off from obvious overhangs or sheer cliffs , but Gebhardt could see nothing obvious about this steep , rocky face . A jumper falling nearly 20 stories would hit 70 miles an hour . His skis might act_as wings , pushing him out of his aerodynamic tuck . Even if he could keep himself upright , he would still need plenty of momentum to clear the rocks , which extended 30 feet beyond the takeoff point . And he needed a clear line_of_vision from launch to landing : Basic cliff jumping technique called_for him to be able to focus_on the touchdown virtually before he took_off . But as each snowball came flying down the mountainside -- one crashing on the rocks , another on snow and another on rock again -- it became frighteningly clear , to Gebhardt at least , that accurately predicting this jump ' s trajectory would be impossible . His stomach muscles tightened and his hands began to sweat . He had never intended to direct the jump ; he was here only because Ruff had asked him to help coordinate its filming . Ruff had it all planned out . To record the jump , he ' d recruited seven photographers , including Gary Nate , a veteran cameraman for ski-film producer Warren Miller , and Robbie Huntoon , an experienced cliff jumper in his own_right , who ran a small local production company . Nate , Huntoon and the other cameramen would spread_out around the massive bowl , staking positions up_to a quarter-mile away . They would get close-ups and wide-angle shots with still cameras , on film and videotape , and once the jump was nailed , they would shoot Ruff chugging soda and wolfing_down candy_bars . The filming was all on spec , but Ruff had a lot riding_on the outcome . He had told his fiancee , Kim Wiebe , that this would be his last big jump ; he hoped to market the footage to ski-filmmakers and advertisers for more_than half a_million dollars . As the photographers skied into place , Gebhardt wasn ' t the only one who was shocked by the size , scale and layout of the jump . Standing above the cliff in his bright magenta and violet ski suit , Ruff appeared in the photographers ' viewfinders as a tiny pinpoint of color on a marbled background of white snow and black rock . &quot; It couldn ' t have looked more extreme , &quot; Nate said later . &quot; It was like watching Evel Knievel jumping the Grand Canyon. &quot; It had snowed six inches the night before , and though the morning dawned crystal blue , the weather was rapidly deteriorating . Broken clouds flew overhead at airplane speed , casting huge shadows across the bowl . Cold gusts whipped against the cliffs , causing the fresh snow to slip like sand through the cracks in the rocks . More_than one of the group prayed that Ruff would call_off the jump . &quot; This is a bad scene , Joe , &quot; one of the photo assistants scowled to Gebhardt . &quot; I don ' t want to be here , man. &quot; Still , no one called Ruff back . In the unwritten protocol of cliff jumping , once the skier is in position the decision to go is his alone . To warn him off , or even suggest a negative outcome , would violate one of the cardinal rules of the sport : Don ' t psych out the skier . It could break his concentration , and should he get hurt , everyone would know who to blame . &quot; If I rattle him and he dies , then I ' m responsible , &quot; Nate thought to himself . &quot; If I say nothing , then I ' m not. &quot; Besides , Ruff was already famous for pushing the limits , and he had always landed safely before . He was cocky and confident , but no one thought he was stupid . Ruff was proud_of his ability to case out a jump , evaluating the launch , figuring his trajectory , visualizing the landing -- even when he was using snowballs rather than his own eyes . &quot; Whether it ' s 20 , 30 , 60 or 110 feet , &quot; he boasted to the camera after a 110-footer in Warren Miller ' s 1990 film &quot; Extreme Winter , &quot; &quot; everything is calculated to perfection -- the takeoff , the air time , the landing , the run-out -- so that we can go_off with a calculated confidence that there ' s no way we ' ll get hurt. &quot; Then , putting_on a half-serious Clint Eastwood stare as the camera pulled_in , he said , &quot; Cuz dying ' s not much of a livin ' , boy. &quot; Now Ruff sidestepped back_up the mountain , calling across the bowl to Huntoon , asking_for more advice . Huntoon yelled back : &quot; You need to go higher , &quot; figuring that Ruff would need all_the speed he could muster to clear the rocks . Ruff moved_back another 10 steps , but Huntoon yelled for him to go higher still . Ruff took two more steps , then dug himself in . &quot; Did he hear you ? &quot; asked Ruff ' s roommate , Jim Mathews , who was standing by Huntoon ' s side . &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; said Huntoon . &quot; But he sees something totally different than I do. &quot; A hundred yards away , Nate was standing with Ruff ' s brother , Frank , who had skied over to the cameraman ' s position to watch . &quot; Isn ' t there anything we can do to stop this ? &quot; Nate whispered . Frank shook his head . At a little after 11 a.m. , the sun poked through the clouds scudding over Thimble Peak and Ruff gave the signal , pointed his tips downhill and skied for the drop-off . But just before he reached the edge , he turned suddenly to his right -- perhaps a line readjustment , maybe a too-late premonition -- then shot into space . By the time he was halfway down , he was moving so fast that the photographers watching through their viewfinders had lost sight of him . Their cameras , however , caught the sequence . One , equipped with a motor drive that could reel_off four photos per second , captured 16 frames from the edge of the cliff to the bottom . In the first five , Ruff was in fine form -- a loose , cannonball tuck . But by the sixth , he began to lose_it . He waved his arms in wide swoops , trying to keep himself in balance . Two frames later , he was falling back-first . In the 12th shot , he slammed into the rocky outcropping and bounced 30 feet in the air , his skis exploding off his heels and his limbs flailing . His momentum carried him down the_hill , where he landed on his back , sliding head-first another 100 feet . Forty-five minutes later , Ruff was dead . MOUNTAINEERING PURISTS WOULD BRISTLE_AT CALLING PAUL RUFF AN EX-skier . He was a stuntman , the alpinists would argue , a ski-model , more interested in mugging for the camera than practicing the art of extreme skiing . Likening him to the sport ' s French originators , whose death-defying technical descents of 50- and 60-degree inclines stretched skiing to its physical limits , would be like equating a bungee-jumper with a mountain_climber . The term , the purists would say , should be reserved for skiers like France ' s Sylvain Saudan , Patrick Vallencant , Jean-Marc Boivin and Bruno Gouvy , many of whom had cut their teeth in the early ' 60s logging les premieres , first ascents , of the 15 # 000-foot peaks that surround Chamonix . But by the late 1960s , with thousands of climbers looking_to make their mark in the Alps , the remaining premieres made a short_list . The only way to go , it seemed , was down . Saudan , dubbed &quot; Le Skieur de l ' Impossible , &quot; made a series of les premieres descentes on sheer faces others had only climbed before . Getting_to them required technical mountaineering skills and the level of difficulty was almost unfathomable . The descents , twice as steep as the most challenging double-diamond trails at today ' s resorts , followed super-steep chutes known as couloirs , sometimes no wider than a king-size bed , that plummeted thousands of feet . A slip would almost certainly send the skier sliding out of control to the bottom , where monstrous cliffs and 1 # 000-foot crevasses threatened . The sport ' s definition was as simple as it was morose : Si tu tombes , tu meurs -- &quot; If you fall , you die. &quot; Until his final jump , Paul Ruff had never pushed the limits that far . He was no mountaineer but a skier , first and last . And yet he had more in common with the_French extremists than his purist critics might care to admit . For one , all but Saudan are dead . And all_of them were tempted by a force perhaps greater than gravity itself -- fame . First , Vallencant . He pushed the definition of extreme further than Saudan and reaped the rewards with sponsorships , his own clothing line and the need to keep pushing . He fell to his death in 1989 during a training climb . Next was Boivin , who added parachutes and hang_gliders to radical skiing descents . His end , in 1990 , came far from the ski slopes , though . During a 3 # 000-foot parachute jump from the top of Venezuela ' s Angel Falls , filmed for a French television adventure series , he smashed into a rock outcropping and bled to death before rescuers could reach him . Gouvy , who reportedly had dressed himself in a Marlboro-logo ' d jump_suit , fell 3 # 000 feet into a crevasse during an extreme snowboard descent on Chamonix ' s Aiguille Verte in 1990 . ( Saudan , now nearly 60 , still trades on his past exploits -- with a heli-ski business , a Chamonix restaurant and other interests that market his reputation. ) Whatever the commonalities , the essence of American-style extreme skiing is as different from the European original as Bartles &amp; Jaymes is from Chateau Lafite Rothschild . The first distinction is setting . The Alps are filled with unrelenting steeps that are close to villages and ski areas . But most of America ' s accessible terrain is comparatively benign -- the mountains aren ' t as tall , the steeps not nearly so_long . And while in the ' 70s extreme and highly technical descents seemed a natural outgrowth of Europe ' s classic mountaineering tradition , the Zeitgeist in Ski Country U.S.A. at that time was embodied in the flashy , downright kooky discipline known as hot-dogging . When the_French started polishing their reputations , the mainstream American ski heroes were guys like Wayne Wong and John Clendennan . Specialists in contorted aerials , back flips and helicopter jumps , they were acrobats , not mountaineers . And though their routines were demanding , they were far from life-threatening . Then in 1983 , a young Squaw Valley skier named Scot Schmidt climbed to the top of the resort ' s 70-foot-high Palisades cornice and jumped_off . Though he wasn ' t the first to pull the stunt , he was the first to have it featured in a Warren Miller film , &quot; Ski Country. &quot; Its wide exposure marked a defining moment in extreme skiing ' s American evolution . Suddenly , a long_jump off a high place , preferably recorded on film , seemed to really define the word extreme . Like hot-dogging , this was pure spectacle , stunts made_for Hollywood and Madison Avenue . Over the next decade , cliff jumps became a mainstay of American ski movies , photography and advertising . Naturally , the bigger the jump , the greater the fame . By the ' 90s , a new Zeitgeist had taken_hold . The Tahoe ski resorts were the perfect place for this spirit to blossom . Situated on some of the steepest mountains in the Northern Sierra , they are pummeled by fierce winter storms that roll in off the Pacific packing 100-mile-an-hour winds and carrying up_to six feet of moisture-laden &quot; Sierra Cement &quot; in a single shot . Far above the lake , mountainsides mutate into monstrous cornices hundreds of feet high -- excellent for jumping . The area boasts the nation ' s only 24-hour ski town -- South Lake Tahoe . From virtually anywhere on the nearby mountains , you can easily spot the South Shore casinos , jutting up into the horizon like a small slice of Manhattan skyline . With their flashing marquees welcoming everyone from Jerry Garcia to Wayne Newton and advertising bawdy late-night reviews , cheap buffets and million-dollar slot payoffs , the casinos are at the center of a town that owes its existence to fast living and risk taking . It ' s not surprising , then , that in 1985 , Paul Ruff joined the mass of immigrant ski bums who land in South Lake Tahoe every year . Ruff was a bartender , a born ham and a skiing maniac . He had been jumping_off snow-covered bumps in the Northeast since he was 7 -- the wildest , craziest speed_demon at New Hampshire ' s small King Ridge skiing area , one of the countless boys hooked on adrenaline , delighted by danger . One of his teen-age buddies penned a school paper about Ruff ' s exploits . &quot; I like jumping with my friend Paul , &quot; reads the 1977 essay . &quot; One time , Paul went_over this huge jump . He must have gone 40 feet . . . . I ' m surprised he ' s alive today. &quot; FOR A TIME , IN THE WINTER OF 1989-90 , on billboards along the highways that lead skiers out of the coastal California cities , across the Central Valley and up into the High Sierra , Paul Ruff ' s blond good looks , his fireplug thighs and his flashy skiing form seemed to be everywhere . He was the Heavenly Valley poster boy , exploding through a field of powder , larger than life , an armchair-skier ' s fantasy and a marketer ' s dream . It was Ruff ' s dream , too . The seventh of eight children in a religious Catholic family , Ruff grew_up in Reading , Mass. , one of Boston ' s northern suburbs . When he graduated from high_school ( he was a Reading High tight_end and the captain of the wrestling team ) , he moved to Atlantic_City , where his older brother was bartending . Ruff followed his lead and learned the trade . During the winter , he fit_in skiing day trips to Hunter Mountain in New York . But the five-hour drives and the mediocre conditions eventually found Ruff itching for something better . When a former girlfriend invited him to Park City , Utah , he packed his gear and drove west . Utah , however , with its strict liquor laws , was no place to make a living as a bartender , and after a_few weeks , Ruff decided to move_on to Tahoe . He got a job at the Cornice Cafe in Kirkwood and later tended bar at the Cantina Los Tres Hombres there . The same outgoing personality that had him leading his high_school friends , lemming-like , over ski_jumps at King Ridge earned him a following among the local pub crawlers . He ' d do Pee-wee Herman ' s &quot; Tequila &quot; dance on the bar and perform a hilarious karaoke version of &quot; I ' m Too Sexy. &quot; Just about the only thing he took seriously was his skiing . He ' d decided to try to break_into ski-modeling , and he knew he had to be an expert on the slopes . But with his high-school-jock , go-for-broke style , he was quickly humbled by locals who could ski circles_around him . While trying_out for a job on Kirkwood Ski Resort ' s squad of ski instructors , Ruff got noticed by two of the resort ' s staffers , Michael Allen and John Wagnon . &quot; He was very young and very fired_up , &quot; remembers Allen , Kirkwood ' s race director and another extreme skier . Allen and Wagnon skied with the kid from Boston , showed him the local ropes and helped him polish his bravado into skill . Backed up against the Pacific Crest , Kirkwood , with its many cornices , is a favorite haunt of extreme skiers from around the lake . Jumping usually landed skiers in_trouble at Eastern resorts , but at Kirkwood , where there are plenty of good jumps in bounds , the atmosphere seemed to encourage it . This was , after all , home turf for gonzo skiers like Mohawk-haired Glen Plake , whose outrageous coif and radical stunts had won him fame and lucrative gear endorsements . Ruff improved quickly , and when it came time to shoot photos for Kirkwood ' s new brochure , Wagnon asked him to pose . That led to other modeling jobs for ski magazines and promotional appearances at the annual fall ski shows . Still , the big_time meant getting a role in a Warren Miller ski film . Trouble was , breaking_in was akin to being discovered by Hollywood . There were literally hundreds of young skiers willing to do whatever it might take_to catch the filmmaker ' s eye . Undaunted , Ruff bartered beers for videotape and persuaded two local videographers to follow him around for a day as he bounced through the moguls and jumped_off his favorite cornices . He synced the video to James Brown singing &quot; I feel good &quot; and sent a copy to Miller ' s production company . To everyone ' s surprise , the gambit paid_off . A month later , Miller sent Ruff a plane_ticket to ski in a film he was shooting in Canada . Shortly after he arrived , however , bad_weather shut_down the filming . While the crew waited for blue_skies and sunshine , Ruff skied , and one day , heading toward a chairlift , he took a freak fall and tore a ligament in his right knee . He returned home without appearing in a single Warren Miller shot . &quot; He was really bummed out , &quot; remembers Allen , &quot; but Paul wasn ' t the type to stay down for long. &quot; After reconstructive surgery and a summer of aggressive rehab water-skiing on Lake Tahoe , Ruff was back on the slopes , and when the Miller camera crew came_to Kirkwood in February , 1989 , he was ready . On the fourth day of shooting , he watched as another local skier , John Tremann , made a 105-foot jump_off the top of a huge cliff . Not to be outdone , Ruff launched himself from the same spot moments later . He landed in a puff of powder -- 110 feet from the takeoff -- and skied away in delight . His friends dubbed it Ruff ' s Revenge , and the jump ensured him a feature role in Miller ' s fall release &quot; Extreme Winter. &quot; Miller captioned it a world_record . That was the season of the billboards , and Ruff became the toast of South Lake Tahoe . Posters of his jumps filled the walls of restaurants all_over town , and sponsorships began to trickle in . He was invited to appear at the big ski shows and everyone started calling him Captain Kirkwood . Though the money was still pretty meager -- he had to stay_on at Los Tres Hombres -- it seemed that the Miller feature had given him the break he needed . But King of the_Hill is a game of one-upmanship , and Ruff ' s reign was short . Two seasons later , while recovering from another ski injury -- this time to his other knee -- Ruff learned that Tremann had broken his record . On a mountainside close to nearby Donner Summit , he had bagged a 140-footer , outdistancing Ruff by 30 feet . Ruff hated to lose ; he would n ' t allow even his closest friends to keep pace . Just weeks after his second knee surgery , he was_on his mountain_bike -- knee_brace and all -- pedaling up a Tahoe mountain trying desperately to stay ahead of Wiebe , whom he ' d met at Kirkwood ' s Cornice Cafe where she waited tables . The thought that a girl might beat him , says Wiebe now , irked Ruff no end . After silently persevering to the top of the_hill , Ruff unfastened the brace to find blood dripping from the surgical incision . &quot; Are you OK ? &quot; Wiebe asked . &quot; Sure , &quot; he replied with a tense smile . &quot; It doesn ' t hurt at all. &quot; He was still on crutches when he began to plot his comeback . WHEN THE GROUP GATHERED AT Kirkwood on March 28 , Ruff seemed as confident as ever . He had borrowed a condo right at the mountain so that the photographers and the others who would be in_attendance at the next day ' s jump could get the earliest possible start . After cooking_up a batch of pasta and passing beers around , Ruff spread_out a topographical map on the dinner_table and handed_out photos he ' d taken of the cliff . &quot; This is the spot right here , &quot; he said , pointing to a section of the map where the topo lines ran together like fine wood grain around a knot . He had been looking_for the right jump for months -- it had to be accessible , long and , of course , doable . He ' d pumped other skiers for information on jump areas up and down the West Coast . He had also looked_around in his own back yard , poking around near Donner Summit , where Tremann found his record-setter , before friends told him about the spot in the Kirkwood outback . That night , Ruff psyched himself up for the jump by watching the video of Tremann ' s 140-foot effort . Tremann had barely landed the big jump , struggling with the forces of wind resistance and gravity . His skis whisked out from beneath him as his lower torso sought the fastest way to the bottom . ( Luckily , he touched_down safely in six feet of powder. ) Ruff was determined not to make the same mistakes ; he wanted to land cleanly and ski away . He stared intently at the video as he explained how he would hold himself in a tuck to compensate for the oncoming wind . Of course , nailing the jump was just the first part of his plan . The second , and perhaps most important , part was marketing it . For all his modeling and stunt-skiing success , Ruff was lucky if he saw more_than a_few thousand dollars in residuals annually . And with all those other wanna-bes waiting in the wings , there wasn ' t much chance of gaining any leverage with filmmakers or advertisers . This stunt , however , would be his baby from start to finish . In contrast to the negligible modeling fee he got for appearing in Miller ' s films , Ruff worked_out a 50-50 split with his team of photographers . He alone would sell the rights to advertisers and ski-filmmakers . Joe Gebhardt was going_up the mountain with him specifically to help shoot some of the post-jump hype . He would bring along Power Bars and Mountain Dew , for example , for the star to consume just after the big event . Another plan was to shoot footage for a Disney World commercial . Ruff would land the jump and ski to a stop . &quot; Hey Paul Ruff ! What are you going_to do next ? &quot; a voice would ask . &quot; I ' m going_to Disney World ! &quot; he ' d grin . Not that Mountain Dew or Disney World had bought_into this -- Ruff had no contracts or even vague promises from any sponsors . He had , however , talked it all_over with a talent_agent who told him that if he played his cards right , he might walk away with as much as half a_million dollars . His friends were skeptical of such pie-in-the-sky figures , but Ruff tuned out their negative talk . Ruff knew it had to happen now : His days as Captain Kirkwood were coming_to an end . After all , he had celebrated his 29th birthday in February ; a_few months earlier he had asked Wiebe to marry him . While he expected to continue his ski-modeling career , he ' d seen the worried look_on Wiebe ' s face when he talked_about a new record , and it had already caused friction between them . &quot; Don ' t give me any negative thoughts , &quot; he ' d tell her . With all_the money this jump would bring_in -- money that could set them up and pay_off his Jeep , his overdue credit_cards and doctor bills -- he promised he would hang_up the record-setting stuff for good . The season ' s end was fast approaching and the huge dumps of February had already yielded to the March sunshine and , sometimes , rain . Ruff set one date for the jump , but bad_weather caused him to call it off . Then a_few days later , it was back on , and this time , he got Miller ' s cameraman Gary Nate to sign_on . Nate just happened to be at Tahoe ; Ruff spent one evening cajoling him into adding the attempt to his shoot schedule . Once Ruff had settled_on the Kirkwood site , his roommate Jim Mathews said , he was &quot; like a runaway train. &quot; ON THE DAY OF THE JUMP , KIM Wiebe was working her regular morning shift at the Cornice Cafe , trying to keep busy while she waited for her fiance . &quot; I ' ll be in_for a martini , &quot; Ruff had told her the night before . She didn ' t want him to jump -- she had always been clear about that -- but she didn ' t consider him reckless and she couldn ' t help but be proud_of him : &quot; I thought it was pretty neat , &quot; she would admit later , &quot; He was going_to push_through and do_it despite the obstacles. &quot; By 11 a.m. , when there was no sign of him , she thought , &quot; No news is good news. &quot; But then the phone started ringing , and people at the lodge started rushing around . When the helicopter landed outside the base lodge , Wiebe figured the outlook was either really good or really bad . If he had been injured , she thought , the helicopter would be_on its way to the hospital . When the helicopter doors swung open and paramedics , not Ruff , stepped_out , she almost fainted . What Wiebe didn ' t know was that , for a while , back on the mountainside , the news had been good . When Joe Gebhardt got_to Ruff ' s still form right after the fall , Ruff was unconscious but still breathing . Gebhardt ripped open Ruff ' s suit to check his heartbeat . Miraculously , there wasn ' t a scratch on him . And after a_few minutes , Ruff awoke with a start and tried to get_up . Worried that Ruff might injure himself further , Gebhardt , Huntoon and the two ski patrol members who had rushed to his side held him down . &quot; Where are you ? &quot; Gebhardt asked him , checking to see if Ruff was in shock . &quot; Kirkwood ! &quot; &quot; What ' s your name ? &quot; &quot; Paul ! Let me get_up ! I ' m OK ! &quot; His friends moved him to a flat spot they ' d carved out_in the snow . The helicopter was called_on the ski patrol ' s walkie-talkies , and Frank , high on the ridge above the bowl , tried to console his brother over the airwaves . &quot; Hang_in there buddy , you ' re going to be OK. &quot; But the color began to drain from his face and the group watched in horror as his ears turned a deep purple . His aorta torn and bleeding internally , Ruff came_to only because his body had been pointing downhill . Now he lost_consciousness for the last time . Frank got_back to the base lodge as quickly as he could . He and Wiebe huddled_together , crying uncontrollably , as the technicians wheeled Ruff ' s body into the resort ' s emergency clinic . Finally , a nurse asked Wiebe if she wanted to be alone with Ruff for a_few minutes . The woman led her into a doctor ' s office and closed the door . Ruff ' s body was lying on the examining table . Wiebe walked over to him , put her hand on his shoulder and stood_in silence . She thought_about how he had told her to be strong like him and she remembered how he had always said he was made_out of steel . &quot; Hey there , Man of Steel , &quot; she would say . &quot; that ' s twisted blue steel , &quot; he ' d grin as he flexed his biceps . ON A BRILLIANT SUNDAY MORNING last April , Robbie Huntoon set_up a trampoline in the back yard of his Tahoe cabin . He began to bounce , and with each landing , he sailed higher and higher -- three , five , seven feet . At the apex of each jump , a wispy tuft of auburn hair levitated momentarily above his forehead , his eyebrows arched , his toes pointed straight down and his mouth opened in a boyish half-smile . &quot; I just feel so free , &quot; he said after a half-dozen bounces . &quot; I feel better in the air than I do on the ground. &quot; After a_few more leaps , Huntoon got the height he wanted , and flung his feet above him . Upside-down , he fell toward the mat . But just before he landed on his head , he tucked his chin into his chest , curled his body around and hit safely on his butt . &quot; that ' s the most important move_in ski_jumping , &quot; he said . &quot; If I go too far forward , I can always just bail_out with that move and land safely . We used to call it the suicide stall , because as the jumper almost hits his head , he quickly tucks his chin down to his chest and spins forward . If Paul had planned to land that way he might still be alive , maybe hurt , but at least alive. &quot; It was an old argument between Huntoon and Ruff . Huntoon favored landing as square on his skis as possible , which kept his weight forward and allowed_for the alternative of the suicide stall . Ruff , with two bad knees , believed_in the hip-check landing -- where you land with your weight a little back , roll onto your hips and let more of your torso take the force . And that was only one of Ruff ' s fatal mistakes that Huntoon played over and over again in his head . Almost everything had been wrong , he thought now : The cliff wasn ' t sheer enough , the landing was too flat , the snow was too heavy and Ruff had broken the rule of always knowing where the landing was , from the top , before you jump . At 36 , Huntoon is one of the oldest of Tahoe ' s extreme skiers , but his receding hairline and sun-weathered face hardly give_away his age . His yard is strewn with boy-toys -- motocross cycles , mountain_bikes , the trampoline -- and his house , with its ' 70s-vintage hot-dogging posters and old skis cluttering every corner , remains the skier ' s crash pad it ' s been for a decade or more . Friends say he ' s mellowed over the years , but Huntoon still takes 60-foot-plus leaps with the best of them , and he was back on the snow within a week after Ruff ' s accident , scouting big air during a trip to Mammoth Mountain . To be sure , Ruff ' s death had shaken him up . At the memorial service , he could barely bring himself to look_at the open casket . And when Ruff ' s father , trying to make_sense of his son ' s death , asked Huntoon why people jumped , the skier didn ' t know quite how to respond . What was there to say ? Why do people climb mountains ? Why do they race_cars ? How could he explain the rush of confidence he felt after facing his fears and overcoming them . It was more_than just a power trip , more_than the adrenaline rush . It was a whole way of living , a way of squeezing all he could from life , of experiencing it to the fullest . Huntoon , too , had a girlfriend to think_of , and parents who worried about him . Of course their concerns mattered_to him . But other people ' s worries had never stopped him from doing something he knew he could pull_off . Besides , he told himself , Ruff had made those serious mistakes . He ' d let outside pressures push him over the edge . But Huntoon knew better . His body might not be as nimble as it once was , but his mind was razor sharp . After the doctor at the clinic officially pronounced Ruff dead , Huntoon had to hike back to the bowl to retrieve some photo equipment he ' d left on the_hill . It was a long slog through the melting snow , but after all_the hysteria back at the clinic , the silence of the backcountry was a welcome relief . When he finally reached the bowl , he felt a ghostly calm come_over him . He could see Ruff ' s tracks leading down from the summit , then nothing . From below , the jump looked amazingly doable , a clean , straight shot . This must have been how Ruff first scoped it out , he thought . &quot; I could go_up there and do that , &quot; Huntoon said to himself . &quot; I could do_it for Paul. &quot;</TEXT>
