   <TEXT> Lost in the debate about the United States ' trade_deficit with Japan is a new cause for anxiety on this side of the Pacific : Japan is dominating the booming trade with Asian_nations as well . For the first time , in the year that ended March 31 , Asian_nations ran_up a bigger trade_deficit with Tokyo ( $ 55.95 billion ) than did the United States ( $ 51.14 billion ) . &quot; In 1985 . . . Japan exported a third more to the United States than it did to Asia , &quot; noted a study by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets . &quot; It now exports a third more to Asia than it does to America. &quot; One of the factors behind the Asian_nations ' greater trade_deficit was Japan ' s recession , which drastically cut imports from Asian states . But the strengthening yen also played a role . Japanese multinationals accelerated their efforts to move their factories from the Japanese mainland to foreign countries , mainly to Southeast_Asia and China , because the high yen makes Japanese-made products too expensive to compete . When a Japanese company sets_up a factory overseas , it usually imports the machine_tools and other capital goods needed from Japan , helping to turn the trade_balance in Japan ' s favor . Meanwhile , with the rest of Asia growing more prosperous , imports of cars and other Japanese products are_on the rise , further worsening the trade imbalance . So great are the trade disparities that some Asian_nations have raised special barriers to Japanese goods . South_Korea , which ran an $ 8.5-billion trade_deficit with Japan last year , now bans the import of 230 items from Japan , including cars , video players , cameras and chemicals . Most of the Southeast Asian_nations are hoping that as Japan pulls_out of its recession , more and more consumer goods manufactured in the region will find their way back to the Japanese market . The trade frictions between Japan and the rest of Asia point_up another phenomenon that is frequently lost in the debate about transpacific trade : Trade within Asia is growing increasingly important . In 1991 , Asian_nations reached a watershed by trading more with themselves than with the United States . &quot; We see more and more of our exports going_to Asia , &quot; Singapore ' s founding_father , Lee Kuan Yew , noted recently . In 1992 , Singapore sent nearly half its exports to Asian_countries . Not only are six of its eight top markets in Asia , but Singapore is the biggest trading partner of Vietnam , Cambodia and Myanmar . Pearl Iboshi , an economist at the East-West Center in Honolulu , said that trade patterns in Asia have closely followed investments . &quot; Investments have fueled trade , especially in intermediate goods , &quot; she said . For example , Iboshi said , Taiwan and South_Korea have been major investors in Southeast Asian_nations such_as Thailand and Indonesia in industries where labor costs are a key factor : textiles , shoes , electronics . Taiwan and South_Korea are doing exactly what the Japanese did before them , exporting those industries where they are no longer competitive using plants on_their_own soil because of high domestic wages . * Iboshi said that while intra-Asian trade has advanced significantly in recent years , her studies suggest that most of the final products are still going_to the United States . A computer disk_drive manufactured in Penang , Malaysia , for example , might be exported to Taiwan , to be installed in a laptop_computer that is destined ultimately for the U.S. market . But the drive and other components would be counted as intra-Asian trade . Meanwhile , investors are taking_note of the rapidly developing prosperity of the Southeast Asian market , which , with Vietnam included , now totals nearly 500 million people . Thailand has become the world ' s second-largest market for Toyota cars , and Japanese auto_makers are increasingly shifting their production to Thailand to serve not only the domestic market but as a production hub for Southeast_Asia . Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric have also announced major expansion plans for their home_appliance production facilities in Thailand . Honda Motors recently announced plans to build a $ 40-million car-parts factory on the outskirts of Bangkok to serve Thailand and the entire Southeast Asian region . &quot; This will be in_line with our plan whereby the Philippines , Malaysia , Indonesia and Thailand are able to exchange parts as each country makes different parts , &quot; said Koji Nagata , managing director of Honda Motor Co . Ltd . Most Southeast Asian_nations , which were among the world ' s fastest growing in the 1980s , suffered a sharp falloff in investment last year as big companies diverted their resources to China . Asian investment in China surged 501 % last year , to $ 52 billion , and dropped 12 % in Indonesia , 19 % in Malaysia and a sharp 51 % in Thailand . Members of the Assn . of Southeast Asian_Nations -- Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , Brunei and the Philippines -- are hoping to stimulate regional trade by adopting what they call the ASEAN Free_Trade Area , which is supposed to lower tariffs on imports in the region to zero_in 15 years . The plan got under way in January , but few countries cut their duties significantly at the outset because of domestic pressures to protect home-grown industry . Nevertheless , officials are hopeful for the future . &quot; I think eventually the ASEAN Free_Trade Area will accelerate the trend toward intra-ASEAN trade , &quot; said Washington SyCip , a Manila business consultant . One indirect sign of a trend came_in last month ' s complaint by the Australian subsidiary of cereal maker Kellogg that it will suffer in competition against Swiss food giant Nestle because Nestle has set_up joint_ventures in ASEAN countries and will enjoy lower tariffs . Another factor affecting regional trade is the sudden growth of cross-border development plans , such_as the Singapore-Johor-Riau Growth Triangle . These plans take_advantage of lower-cost labor in one country and use the financial resources of others to produce a product that may end_up crossing three borders before the product is ready for final export . The granddaddy of growth triangles is the China-Hong Kong-Taiwanese model , but other zones have formed among Indonesia , Malaysia and Thailand and among Thailand , Myanmar , Laos and southern China .</TEXT>
