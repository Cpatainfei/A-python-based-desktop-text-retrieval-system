   <TEXT> Catherine Anderson and Bob Curtin swear it ' s the future . But when their eight-foot-long , 100-foot-wide solar-powered plane is wheeled out of its hangar at Edwards Air_Force Base , it looks more like a balsa_wood model made by a 50-foot kid . Don ' t be fooled . Their low-power , high-tech idea could undermine the growing global satellite-launching business . The young engineers of Monrovia ' s AeroVironment say that planes like the pilotless , radio-controlled Pathfinder can do most of the jobs a satellite does , but at a fraction of the cost . Development so far has cost a cheap-for-serious-science $ 2.5 million ; funds have come from several government and private sources . They hope to fly the plane in a test this summer at 65 # 000 feet . If it ' s successful , AeroVironment , which also developed much of the technology for GM ' s Impact electric_car , plans to launch a bigger version -- Helios , with a 200-foot wingspan . &quot; On Helios , &quot; says Anderson , &quot; there ' ll be a large enough solar_array soaking_up sun-power during the day to fly the plane through the night. &quot; And Curtin says its bigger payload would give it the potential to carry_out satellite duties &quot; without paying the $ 100 million a year a satellite typically costs to maintain in orbit. &quot; Solar planes could do the same job for about $ 20 million , he says . One added benefit : Pollution-free take-offs . Many satellites are placed in orbit by a space shuttle , which destroys more ozone in a single launch than the annual chlorofluorocarbon output of most individual industrial_plants .
