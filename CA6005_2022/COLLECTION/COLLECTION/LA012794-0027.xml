   <HEADLINE> SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE ; IF THEY SEE IT , THEY WILL COME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Skiers are skeptics . Local ski operators swore the recent heat_wave was not affecting man-made ski conditions at Big Bear , no matter that it felt_like July . Last Friday , to convince the naysayers , the promotional department at Bear Mountain instructed its pitchman to hold_up that day ' s newspaper on its live daily television spot to prove the resort wasn ' t using old footage . &quot; We ' ve had great skiing for a month , &quot; Libby Coleman , a Bear Mountain spokeswoman , said Wednesday . &quot; But people have this myth about man-made snow , that it ' s something different . But it ' s all water and air. &quot; Unfortunately , most people need to see snow in the mountains before they invest the drive time . No wonder local operators are delighted with the recent winter storm that dropped up_to a foot of snow in the local mountains . &quot; It looks_like winter now , &quot; Greg Ralph , a Snow Summit spokesman , said . &quot; It makes a huge difference . The earthquake didn ' t hurt us nearly as much as the warm weather . Warm weather killed us , we were dying_off . The people that come_up , we do exit surveys when they leave and they say , ' I had no idea it was this good. ' &quot; Despite the fact that conditions are not much improved over last week , Ralph said business is up about 25 % . &quot; You can ' t really blame them , &quot; Ralph said of the skiers . &quot; They want to see snow on the side of the road , they want to put_on chains , they want traffic . But it ' s not necessary . They could have come_up last week and had just as much fun. &quot; This week ' s storm did provide enough new snow to reopen some beginner terrain at Mt . Baldy and Ski Sunrise in Wrightwood , which had been closed because of lack of snow . However , while Mt . Waterman and Kratka Ridge received about six inches , the resorts are unable to operate . Lynn Newcomb , owner of Mt . Waterman , said the resort will need another foot of snow to open . * After a slow start , World Cup overall champion Marc Girardelli is back on track and making a run at his unprecedented sixth overall title and , possibly , his first Olympic gold medal . Girardelli , the Austrian who skis for Luxembourg , won his first race of the season last weekend , a super-giant slalom at Wengen , Switzerland , and moved_into second place in the overall standings behind Norway ' s Kjetil Andre Aamodt . The victory was the 43rd of Girardelli ' s World Cup career , second only to the retired Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden , who won 86 races . Though Girardelli says winning an Olympic gold medal is not important to him , the circuit ' s best all-around skier for the last decade appears poised to strike in any event at the upcoming Olympic Games at Lillehammer . Girardelli , who began as a strong technical skier and later developed his speed skills , is skiing better right now in downhill and super-G than in the slalom . His super-G victory at Wengen followed a second-place finish in the Wengen downhill last Saturday . Ski Notes The Olympic freestyle team , named last weekend at Lake Placid , N.Y. , is led by Donna Weinbrecht , defending Olympic gold medalist in moguls , and Trace Worthington , the reigning men ' s World Cup overall champion . The men ' s team also includes aerial specialists Eric Bergoust , Kris Fedderson and mogul specialists Troy Benson , Craig Rodman and Sean Smith . The women ' s team also includes moguls specialists Ann Battelle , Liz McIntyre and aerialists Tracy Evans , Kriste Porter and Nikki Stone . Worthington injured right knee ligaments three weeks ago but returned last week to finish third at Lake Placid , an indication that he should be ready for the Olympics . Weinbrecht extended her unbeaten World Cup streak to five last weekend with a victory at Lake Placid . With the Olympics approaching , American AJ Kitt showed some signs of life when he finished 12th last weekend at the Wengen downhill . It was Kitt ' s best finish since his 11th place at Val Gardena , Italy , before Christmas . &quot; I ' m on my way back , &quot; Kitt said after the race . &quot; I feel I ' m skiing well . It ' s not a great result -- I ' m not on the podium and that ' s where I want to be -- but it ' s getting better. &quot; America had four skiers finish in the top 30 at Wengen : Kitt , Tommy Moe ( 19th ) , Kyle Rasmussen ( 26th ) and Craig Thrasher ( 30th ) . The Jeep / Eagle Tournament of Champions Ski Series concludes today at Heavenly , Calif. , with 1976 Olympic gold medalist Franz Klammer seeking his first overall championship . The race will be televised by CBS this Sunday at 11 a.m. Klammer leads the men ' s division in the series , which matches former star skiers in handicapped races . Norway ' s Toril Forland leads the women ' s division .</TEXT>
