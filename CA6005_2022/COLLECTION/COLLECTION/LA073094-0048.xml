   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / WENDY WITHERSPOON ; AGASSI ' S NEW COACH AN OLD FRIEND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The relationship was forged over a casual dinner at Key Biscayne , Fla. , in March . Andre Agassi , dining one evening after playing in the Lipton Championships , asked his friend , Brad Gilbert , to give him some pointers on his game . They went_to the tennis_court the next day . And so it was that Agassi , ranked 20th on the professional tour , and Gilbert , ranked 35th , have become player and coach . During the Player ' s International tournament in Toronto this week , Gilbert was asked about the situation . &quot; I don ' t think ( Agassi ) was looking_for somebody to come_in and make all kinds of changes in his game , and I wasn ' t looking_to coach and it kind of just happened , &quot; Gilbert said . Agassi was coached by Nick Bollettieri until 1993 , when he split with him and hired Pancho Segura . The arrangement between Agassi and Gilbert is informal . They hit when they can and talk on the phone often . Gilbert attends Agassi ' s matches when he is not involved in another tournament . Since striking the partnership , Agassi and Gilbert have appeared in five tournaments together but have not played one another . That streak could end in the L.A. Open , beginning Monday at the Los Angeles Tennis Center , where both are scheduled to play . If they meet in the tournament , Gilbert , 4-5 against Agassi in his career , will be at a distinct disadvantage . &quot; I ' ve given him too many of my secrets in practice , &quot; Gilbert said . &quot; He won ' t let me get_away with some of the things I used to get_away with. &quot; The L.A. Open field also includes sixth-ranked Michael Chang , ninth-ranked Boris Becker and 26th-ranked Richard Krajicek , the tournament ' s defending champion . Krajicek is scheduled to play his first match Monday night during a session that begins at 7 ; Chang and Becker will make their first_appearances Tuesday starting at 11 a.m. , and Agassi will play his first match Tuesday night on a program that starts at 7:30 . * Add Agassi : The neon-spandex-wearing player of the early 1990s is staying one step ahead of the fashion police . Agassi modeled his new_line of clothing for fans during an Arthur Ashe Foundation benefit match against Chang on July 23 at the National Tennis Center in Toronto . Tom Tebbutt reported in the Toronto Globe and Mail that the color_scheme &quot; derives more from a barroom shiner than bright-eyed visions of tennis elegance and civility. &quot; Agassi told Tebbutt that he wanted his new_line to be casual , labeling it , &quot; Something that guys could wear skateboarding down the street. &quot; * Road to recovery : Steffi Graf , who has lost consecutive matches for the first time in more_than nine years , will defend her championship in the $ 400 # 000 Toshiba tournament starting Monday at the La Costa Resort and Spa . The top-ranked Graf won the Australian Open while dominating the first five months of the season . She then lost to Mary Pierce in the semifinals of the_French Open and to Lori McNeil in the first round at Wimbledon . The La Costa field includes the top three women in the world : Graf , No . 2 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario , who won the_French Open , and No . 3 Conchita Martinez , who won Wimbledon . Among the other entrants are sixth-ranked Lindsay Davenport , eighth-ranked Jana Novotna and ninth-ranked Natalia Zvereva . * Farewell : Organizers of the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles tennis tournament say they have received hundreds of letters to Martina Navratilova wishing her farewell . Tournament officials asked that fans of Navratilova , nine-time Wimbledon champion , participate in a tribute to her final singles appearance in Los Angeles by writing letters and making a donation in her name to the Los Angeles Disaster Relief Fund benefiting victims of the Jan . 17 earthquake : Martina Navratilova Farewell , P.O. Box 570506 , Tarzana , Calif . 91357 . Navratilova , ranked fourth , will join Davenport , Novotna , Zvereva , fifth-ranked Kimiko Date , 10th-ranked Gabriela Sabatini and McNeil in the tournament Aug . 8-14 at the Manhattan Country_Club in Manhattan Beach . * Hometown jitters : Davenport , who spent much of her childhood in Palos Verdes before moving to Murrieta and graduating from Murrieta Valley High in June , enjoys the two Southland tour stops because it means coming_home . But it also means playing in front of more of her fans than usual . &quot; You hope to do_well when you ' re ( playing ) kind of near where you ' re from , but it also can make you a little more nervous . There ' s a little more pressure , &quot; Davenport said . Tennis Notes Lindsay Davenport was asked to do a sound check recently before a television interview . &quot; One , two , three , four , five , &quot; Davenport said . &quot; Do you want me to count higher ? I can , I have a high_school diploma. &quot; . . . Davenport and friend Natalia Zvereva plan to become roommates and move to Newport Beach . . . . The Southern California Tennis Assn . stages exhibitions between matches at the L.A. Open_to showcase programs such_as junior tennis , and these matches often feature the tennis stars of the future . In 1987 , for instance , a highly touted , skinny 15-year-old boy who had just been named to the Junior Davis Cup team played in one of the SCTA exhibitions . Pete Sampras returned to win the singles title at the tournament four years later . In addition to junior tennis , exhibitions this year also will include adult and wheelchair tennis .</TEXT>
