   <HEADLINE> PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M . KRISTOF : HOW NEW BANKRUPTCY LAWS AFFECT INDIVIDUALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an effort to stem the rising tide of bankruptcy filings nationwide , Congress has overhauled the laws governing them for the first time in 16 years . The new law , dubbed the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 , was signed by President Clinton in late October and went_into effect immediately . While the bulk of the 50-page reform concerns corporate bankruptcy filings , a handful of important provisions affect individuals . Here ' s a look_at how the act altered previous law and what it means to you : * Q : How does the new law change personal bankruptcy rules ? * A : It creates a new category of debts that can ' t be erased , or &quot; discharged , &quot; through bankruptcy . It boosts federal exemptions , allowing some debtors to keep more of their assets . It protects prospective students from post-bankruptcy discrimination . It clarifies when you can use a bankruptcy filing to forestall a foreclosure . And it elevates the status of former spouses and children , giving them greater ability to collect back debts and allowing them greater latitude when taking a debtor to court . * Q : What debts can ' t be discharged in bankruptcy ? * A : Most debts owed to the federal_government -- be it to tax authorities or student aid agencies -- are not dischargeable . The new law adds that if you borrowed on a credit_card to pay income_taxes , which are otherwise not dischargeable debts , you can ' t erase that credit_card debt either . Also added_to the list : marital debts you agree to pay as part of a divorce and money owed your ex-spouse in property divisions , dues and assessments owed to a condominium or cooperative association and criminal fines owed by a Chapter 13 debtor . In addition , if you buy luxury items or take cash_advances against a credit_card within three months of a bankruptcy , these debts generally cannot be discharged , says Robin Leonard , author of &quot; How to File for Bankruptcy. &quot; * Q : How does the law protect students ? * A : It prohibits lenders from denying a federally guaranteed student loan to a person who has filed for bankruptcy protection in the past . * Q : How much of my assets can I keep when I file bankruptcy ? * A : That depends_on the type of bankruptcy you file and where you live . The new law doubles so-called federal exemptions for Chapter 7 -- personal liquidation -- filings . These exemptions say debtors can keep_up to $ 15 # 000 in home equity ; up_to $ 8 # 000 in accrued loan value in a life_insurance policy ; up_to $ 8 # 000 in personal items , but none worth more_than $ 400 ; jewelry worth as much as $ 1 # 000 ; a car worth as much as $ 2 # 400 , and tools used in your trade worth as much as $ 1 # 500 . However , some state laws preempt federal bankruptcy exemptions . California , for example , has separate bankruptcy exemptions that break_into two tiers . One tier allows debtors to keep few personal assets but a substantial chunk of home equity . The other , which is more favorable to renters , allows you to use a home equity &quot; credit &quot; to shelter assets that would otherwise have to be sold to pay creditors . * Q : How does the law protect former spouses and children of bankruptcy petitioners ? * A : First , it says that pending court actions aimed at determining paternity , child_support or alimony will continue even after one of the parties to the suit files bankruptcy . In the past , these legal_actions would be indefinitely stalled until the bankruptcy was settled . Second , it adds debts owed to former spouses to a list of debts that can ' t be erased in bankruptcy . And it gives payment of child_support and alimony greater priority , allowing these debts to be paid even before Internal Revenue Service can collect past-due taxes . ( In effect , creditors affected by a bankruptcy line_up to get paid . Where you stand_in line often determines whether your debt is satisfied . Children and ex-spouses are now standing near the front of the line. ) * Q : How does the law affect foreclosure proceedings ? * A : A Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing can now stop a foreclosure process until the date of sale . However , once the home is sold in foreclosure , it can ' t be regained by a debtor who files for bankruptcy protection . In the past , courts had great discretion over when and whether a Chapter 13 filing could stop a foreclosure . Some judges would actually reverse completed foreclosure sales , while others would rule that if a foreclosure sale had been scheduled , it was too late to stop it with a bankruptcy filing . * Q : How does this law discourage personal bankruptcy filings ? * A : It doesn ' t , Leonard says . Despite the original intent , the final law actually makes_it easier for some people to file . It does , however , encourage Chapter 13 -- &quot; work-out &quot; -- filings as opposed to the more serious liquidation filings under Chapter 7 . And it provides some modest education provisions that aim to ensure that bankruptcy petitioners fully understand what they ' re doing and how it will affect them and their credit rating in the future , she notes . In addition , the law recognizes bankruptcy petition preparers -- non-attorneys who often file thousands of bankruptcy petitions for financially troubled , low-income individuals -- and creates a new set of rules and penalties for preparers who abuse the process .</TEXT>
