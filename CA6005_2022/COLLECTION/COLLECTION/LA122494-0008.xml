   <HEADLINE> THE MEXICAN INVESTMENT ; PESO ' S PLUMMET PUTS U.S. RELATIONSHIP TO TEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The government of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has been rocked by the economic events of the last few days . While some part of the turbulence is no doubt of the weeks-old government ' s own making , it is absolutely vital that Mexico ' s neighbors do all_in their power to help the new government through this storm . So far both Ottawa and Washington have reacted very well indeed . The United States extended a $ 6-billion line_of_credit and Canada chipped_in with $ 1 billion . Clearly Mexico ' s partners in the North_American Free_Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) recognize that the continent ' s political and economic stability depends_on a Mexico that is politically and economically stable . The need for partnership exists not only in the economic realm ; bilateral and , in some areas , trilateral efforts are vital whether the issue is legal immigration , illegal immigration , border control , drug trafficking , temporary labor or whatever . No North_American_nation is an island ; Mexico_City , Ottawa and Washington must work as a close-knit team . Alas , the Zedillo government has had a terrible week . Not long after highly respected Finance_Minister Jaime Serra Puche had reassured international investors that Mexico had no intention of devaluing the peso against other world currencies , Mexico devalued the peso . Not only that , it let the peso free-fall in currency markets . Mexico ' s currency is now trading at about 30 % less value . The Zedillo government can be criticized for its tactics , and it should learn early on that the confidence of foreign governments will reflect in part the degree to which it keeps its word . However , the root of the problem transcends Mexico . Currency volatility can be described as the Great Satan of the present world economic_system . As last Sunday ' s Times editorial argued , without global monetary reform the world currency exchange system will remain vulnerable to wild swings , risky hedging and ruthless speculation . This is what happened this week . But it should not happen . It ' s bad stuff . Some major foreign investors are furious with Minister Puche for saying one thing and doing another ; some , like Ross Perot , even see a dark conspiracy to devalue American investments , cheapen Mexican goods for U.S. purchasers while making U.S. goods in Mexico more expensive and effectively lowering Mexican wages , thus adding_to migratory pressure northward . But we think the Mexican government deserves the benefit of the doubt . The United States needs to look_at its partnership with Mexico as a long-term deal , and at the current downturn as a temporary cost of doing business . We must remain close , understanding and helpful . Recriminatory finger-pointing will solve nothing , and can erode the enormous progress .</TEXT>
