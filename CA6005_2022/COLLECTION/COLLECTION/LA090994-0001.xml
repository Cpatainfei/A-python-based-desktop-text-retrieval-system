   <HEADLINE> ROSWELL GILBERT ; SPARKED DEBATE WITH ' MERCY KILLING '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Roswell Gilbert , whose 1985 &quot; mercy killing &quot; of his ailing wife thrust the issue of elderly euthanasia into the national debate , has died at his daughter ' s Baltimore home at the age of 85 . Gilbert spent more_than five years in prison for fatally shooting his wife , Emily , before he was granted clemency in 1990.He had been convicted of murder and sentenced to a minimum of 25 years . He died in his sleep Saturday at the Baltimore home of Martha ( Skipper ) Moran , his only child . &quot; I shouldn ' t have killed my wife , now I know that , &quot; Gilbert said in 1990 . &quot; I loved her dearly . I truly did. &quot; He said his wife ' s illness &quot; created just a complete state of desperation in my mind . . . . It ' s a lousy excuse , but that ' s what it was. &quot; &quot; He was a man of conviction and a very concerned person about his wife ' s health , &quot; said John Kinkler , Gilbert ' s close friend and former Ft . Lauderdale , Fla. , neighbor . In an interview at the time of Gilbert ' s clemency , Moran said she would encourage her father , who suffered from heart and lung disease , to take better care of himself . The retired engineer chuckled then at a medical_report that his death may be imminent . &quot; I ' m a tough old rooster . . . don ' t believe it , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
