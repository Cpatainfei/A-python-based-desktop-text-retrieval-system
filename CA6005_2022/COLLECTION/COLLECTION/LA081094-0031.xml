   <HEADLINE> OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS : CLIMBER SCORES RECORD SWEEP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Todd Huston has had more_than his share of ups and downs , especially in the last few months . But the Newport Beach climber has finally found paradise . He is resting in Hawaii after conquering the 13 # 796-foot Mauna Kea on Sunday and shattering the record for climbing the highest peak in each of the 50 states . Huston did_it in 68 days -- with only one leg , and a custom-made prosthesis that in a way acted_as a sort of pogo_stick or shock_absorber to help him along the bumpy way . &quot; My feelings are kind of ambivalent right now , &quot; the 33-year-old said . &quot; There is some sadness because there are no more mountains left to climb , but I ' m ecstatic because I beat the world_record ( 101 days ) and accomplished the goal I set_out to accomplish. &quot; Sponsored by the reading_program , Hooked_on Phonics , Huston began his adventure on June 1 by climbing Alaska ' s 20 # 320-foot Mt . McKinley . &quot; I was scared to death , &quot; Huston said . &quot; The weather was uncooperative and we had high winds . As we were hiking_up , people were coming_down . They couldn ' t make_it ( to the summit ) because they were just getting nuked up near the top . At 14 # 000 feet we passed a body_bag of a dead Korean ( one of two who froze to death on the mountain ) . But the good_weather followed us and we made_it to the summit. &quot; Huston , climbing with Whit Rambach , had less trouble with Florida ' s Britton Hill -- it ' s only 345 feet high . But he almost wasn ' t able to climb Oregon ' s 11 # 239-foot Mt . Hood . Climbers have been dying because of loose rocks and the guides , fearing bad publicity as much as anything else , closed their operations and refused to lead Huston and Rambach to the top . Huston called a friend in the area who happened to be an expert mountaineer and the friend led them up , incident free . Huston said the prettiest view was from Wyoming ' s 13 # 804-foot Gannett Peak . &quot; But the neatest time was up at 12 # 000 feet on ( Montana ' s ) Granite Peak when we had a bunch of mountain_goats come_in and visit our camp. &quot; Huston lost his leg when he was 21 , after battling for years against complications of an injury from a water_ski accident when he was 14 . He said he decided to make the world-record assault on the 50 peaks &quot; to inspire people to overcome their challenges. &quot; He said he will continue to climb and might even try to become the first one-legged man to conquer Mt . Everest . &quot; I think I can do_it . I know I can do_it , &quot; he said . &quot; Besides , I can only lose half of my toes to frostbite. &quot; Briefly LOCAL FISHING -- White sea_bass struck again Monday off the back of Santa Catalina Island , with Redondo Sportfishing ' s Blackjack picking_up 37 fish of 15-30 pounds , and L.A. Harbor Sportfishing ' s First String taking 22 more . Closer to the coast , the yellowtail that roam the pilings of the offshore oil_rigs off Huntington Beach finally decided to bite . Rick Shaw , owner of the Angela out of Long_Beach Sportfishing , reported &quot; a wide-open bruiser yellowtail frenzy &quot; for an hour on Saturday , with his passengers boating 23 fish in the 15-25-pound range before the bite ended . L.A. Harbor ' s Dreamer reported catching 22 fish the same day . There have been scattered catches since . MEXICO FISHING -- August is too hot for many at Cabo San Lucas , but residents consider it one of the the best months for fishing and the last week ' s results back their claims . Blue_marlin flags are flying daily and huge tuna and dorado are showing at the scales . The private yacht Rhapsody traveled 20 miles off Palmilla and two anglers spent the day catching tuna from 160-200 pounds . Closer to port , the fish were smaller , but several pushed 100 pounds . Dorado are averaging 10-30 pounds and wahoo of 40-80 pounds are beginning to show . East Cape fishermen are enjoying light-tackle battles with sailfish and heavy-duty fights with blue_marlin . Mark Hollingsworth of Cypress , fishing out of Palmas De Cortez , fought a marlin for eight hours before losing_it . SAN DIEGO LONG-RANGE : Tuna fishing remains outstanding for those on three- and four-day trips -- with giant bluefin and football-size yellowfin cooperating daily -- and miserable for those on overnight trips , as the fish have yet to move to within the 100-mile range necessary for the smaller_boats . HUNTING -- The popular Zone A deer hunt begins Saturday and despite the dryness , experts are predicting moderate success in the southern section , which includes much of Southern and Central California . Conditions are favorable for a good hunt in most of the usual areas . A new hot spot might be the area north of the Santa Ynez Valley around Figueroa Mountain , which has recovered from last year ' s wildfires , leaving deer with plenty of food and hunters with plenty of access . Weather will be a factor and hunters should check with the U.S. Forest Service to see what areas require permits for access and what areas might be closed because of fire danger . The best hunting is expected early mornings and late afternoons as deer will be in thick cover during the heat of day . The DFG says ample numbers of the 65 # 000 tags remain for the 44-day hunt . Last year , 41 # 251 tags were sold , with hunters posting a 32 % success rate . POACHING -- Monterey Peninsula golf_courses are not part of Zone A . Yet some apparently figured fairway deer were fair pickings . Six men were recently sentenced for their roles in poaching deer from golf_courses and dumping the carcasses into the ocean . The arrests resulted from a six-week investigation by DFG officials seeking to shut_down a ring of venison poachers who ran a processing center at one of the poacher ' s homes . Edward Albert got the stiffest sentence after being found guilty of trespassing and deer-tag violations of 100 days in jail , a $ 2 # 700 fine and three years ' probation , during which he cannot hunt or be in the company of hunters , cannot possess firearms and must permit search and seizure of his home or person . Albert forfeited his rifle and hundreds of pounds of venison . GRUNION -- A grunion run_along dark , sandy beaches is in_progress , with the slippery little fish expected to show for two-hour periods beginning tonight at about midnight and about an hour later each night through Friday . Grabbing is usually best in the second hour , experts say . The last grunion run of the year is expected Aug . 23-26 . NOTEWORTHY -- Volunteers from United Anglers of California will build a reef off Huntington Beach on Friday , using 1 # 000 tons of concrete rubble . The reef will be three miles west of Huntington Beach Pier in 90 feet of water .</TEXT>
