   <HEADLINE> WORLD PERSPECTIVE / FRANCE ; BOOK ON YOUNG MITTERRAND AS A RIGHTIST LEAVES MANY SHOCKED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In almost 50 years in political office , the last 13 in the Elysee Palace , President Francois Mitterrand has carefully shielded his past , cultivating an image of intellectual rigor and compassion , aloofness and inscrutability . He has been , in other words , the Frenchman ' s Frenchman . But these days the 77-year-old president , with just nine months left in office and in ill_health , is putting dents in the very image he created . To the shock of many in France , where political mysteries often go_to the grave , Mitterrand has cooperated with a writer whose book , released last week , portrays this socialist icon and Resistance fighter as : a supporter of right-wing causes before World_War_II ; a willing participant at first in the Vichy government , and a devoted lifelong friend to the Vichy police_chief who ordered the arrest and deportation of tens of thousands of Jews . &quot; A French Youth -- Francois Mitterrand 1934-1947 , &quot; by Pierre Pean , has created a stir across the country with its text -- and its cover photo . It shows a young Mitterrand shaking hands in 1942 with Marshal Henri Philippe Petain , the head of the Vichy government that collaborated with the Nazis in World_War_II . Perhaps the biggest surprise for the_French is the willingness of Mitterrand , the country ' s longest-serving president , to showcase the past that he had declined to discuss and risk clouding the image many in France have of him . Author Pean says Mitterrand just wanted to come clean . &quot; At the threshold of his entry into history , the time had come_to lay everything out at the end of his last term , &quot; Pean has told newspapers here . Indeed , Mitterrand , who recently underwent a second operation relating to his prostate cancer , said in an interview published in Paris on Thursday that he would not have time to write an autobiography . Pean ' s book , hailed by critics as exceptionally evenhanded , covers Mitterrand ' s early years , from ages 18 to 31 . It documents , through letters and interviews with Mitterrand , the young_man ' s decision to become an active member of the ultranationalist movement Croix de Feu ( Cross of Fire ) in the 1930s . Pean and Mitterrand explain his support for the far right as a natural result of the president ' s upbringing in a provincial , devoutly Roman_Catholic and bourgeois family . And Pean points_out that Mitterrand never supported anti-Semitic activity and never belonged_to La Cagoule ( the Hood ) , the extreme right-wing group that staged terrorist attacks in prewar Paris . &quot; In those troubled times , especially when one is young , it is very difficult to make choices , &quot; Mitterrand is quoted in the book . &quot; I managed to come_out of it rather well . It is unjust to judge people from errors which are explained by the atmosphere of the times. &quot; The book also describes Mitterrand ' s escape_from a German prison_camp in 1941 , before he went_to work for the Vichy government , as at least partly the result of his boundless passion for a young_woman , to whom he wrote 2 # 400 letters over a three-year period . She later broke_off their engagement . * After his return , Pean writes , Mitterrand went_to work as a civil_servant in the Vichy government in a sincere show of support for Petain , then a popular World_War I hero . Pean maintains that Mitterrand was not pro-German but &quot; simply a Petainist. &quot; In 1943 , Mitterrand began using his job as cover_for his Resistance work , earning the praise of Gen . Charles de Gaulle as a liberation leader . For younger generations in France , the wartime collaboration was a black-and-white issue . But many others who lived through the war agree with Mitterrand that politics then was a more complex business . And that has been debated hotly this year , the 50th anniversary of the liberation of France . Many in France can understand Mitterrand ' s continued warm feelings for the late Petain . Yet they have trouble understanding his friendship with Rene Bousquet , the Vichy policy chief who ordered the arrest and deportation of tens of thousands of Jews and whose funeral the president attended in 1986 .</TEXT>
