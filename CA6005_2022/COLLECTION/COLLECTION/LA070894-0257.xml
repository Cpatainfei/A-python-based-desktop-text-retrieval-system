   <HEADLINE> CHEVROLET GEARING_UP TO REGAIN NO . 1 POSITION ; AUTOS : GENERAL MOTORS DIVISION IS BOOSTING PRODUCTION OF THREE BEST-SELLING MODELS . UNIT ' S SALES ARE STILL FALLING_BEHIND 1993 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> General Motors Corp . said Thursday that its flagship Chevrolet division is powering up production of critical new models that could put it back on top of the market next year , despite skidding sales that show little evidence of a turnaround . Chevrolet officials said production of the 1995 Lumina , Cavalier and Blazer -- three of its best_sellers -- will put it in a position to challenge Ford Motor Co . for the top-selling nameplate . For decades , Chevy built the best-selling cars in the United States . Ford claimed the top spot in 1988 . &quot; In the 1995 calendar_year , we should be right in the battle to take_back the title , &quot; said Ron Sobrero , Chevrolet general sales and service manager . He acknowledged that for the rest of 1994 , however , Chevrolet will be plagued by slow output of the new models . In June , Chevy ' s sales fell 4.5 % from June , 1993 , to 235 # 064 cars and trucks , largely because virtually all 1994 Luminas had been sold and Chevy has been building very few 1995 models because of production problems . For the first_half of the year , the division ' s sales rose 6.6 % , compared to a 10.7 % increase for the auto industry as_a_whole . &quot; The new products are coming , but we have to take a lot of downtime to get them , &quot; Sobrero said . The vehicles have been a long_time coming . For most of the 1990s , Chevrolet dealers have had to make_do with a tired lineup as investment dollars went_into other GM divisions , notably Saturn . Chevy ' s problems started &quot; when ( GM ) decided to take that $ 3 ( billion ) or $ 4 billion and put it in Saturn , &quot; said Chevrolet dealer Lou LaRiche of Plymouth , Mich . &quot; It hurt everybody . It hurt Oldsmobile , it hurt Chevrolet , it hurt Buick -- everyone. &quot; But the change has forced Chevrolet to shift its focus back on its original mission : to be a seller of value-oriented , affordable cars and trucks . At first , the division was forced to slash prices to guard its market share against encroachment from the superior Saturns . The new model lineup , with simpler designs and more efficient production methods , is allowing Chevrolet to build_in more value for lower prices , industry_analysts say . The new Cavalier , for example , offers dual air_bags and anti-lock brakes as standard features . It has an attractive redesigned body with added interior room . It handles better and offers a much better ride than its predecessor . The starting price for the line will be about $ 10 # 515 . &quot; At that price , the car ' s going_to be tremendously successful , &quot; said Chris Cedergren , an analyst with AutoPacific Group . &quot; The main thing Chevrolet has going_for it is that you get a hell of a lot of bang for your buck. &quot; Although some critics have panned the 1995 Lumina ' s conservative styling , it also offers many significant improvements over its predecessor . It comes_with dual air_bags and a 160-horsepower engine for a base price of $ 15 # 995 . Ford ' s 1995 Taurus sedans will start at $ 17 # 585 . GM aims to sell more_than 300 # 000 Luminas and similar Monte Carlo models annually . Even if the cars are not wild successes , the lower production_costs will mean higher profits for GM . J.P. Morgan analyst David Bradley estimated a $ 500-a-car profit on the 1995 Lumina line , in contrast to an estimated $ 2 # 500-a-car loss on the earlier models . Analysts also expect Chevrolet ' s 1995 Blazer to compete more effectively than past models with Ford ' s Explorer and Jeep ' s Grand Cherokee in the compact sport utility market .</TEXT>
