   <HEADLINE> DEATH TOLL IN ARGENTINE BLAST RISES TO 96 ; BOMBING : RESCUERS GIVE_UP HOPE OF FINDING SURVIVORS . JEWISH LEADERS INTENSIFY DEMANDS FOR A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A week after a powerful bomb ripped through the center of the largest Jewish community in Latin_America , rescuers Monday gave_up hope of finding more survivors as the official death toll climbed to 96 . Argentine and Israeli military_personnel recovered 27 bodies and said 11 of the dead remained in the rubble after the devastating blast that some officials blame on Islamic extremists . The July 18 explosion flattened a seven-story building that housed Jewish community services and 100-year-old archives . The incident is being described by some as the deadliest attack on Jews outside Israel since the Holocaust . A little-known Islamic group calling itself Ansarollah , or Partisans of God , has claimed responsibility for the bombing and the crash a day later of an airplane in Panama , in which most of the 21 people killed were Jewish . The authenticity of the claim has not been verified , but the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires was attributed to Hezbollah , the Lebanon-based umbrella organization for Islamic radicals . Struggling to overcome the staggering trauma to their community , Jewish leaders here are becoming increasingly vocal in_demanding that authorities exhaust all possibilities to investigate the blast and prevent future acts of terrorism . The 1992 bombing was never solved , and security in this country is woefully lax . &quot; There are Jewish people who are truly terrified , &quot; said Ramon Beraja , president of the Delegation of Argentine-Israelite Assns. , whose office was destroyed in the blast . Security precautions &quot; have not been sufficient because it never entered the_Argentine mind that an Argentine target could be attacked this way , with such ferocity. &quot; Jews began migrating to Argentina in the last_half of the 19th Century , and the community today numbers between 250 # 000 and 300 # 000 , second only to the United States in this hemisphere . Argentine and Israeli authorities said Monday there is mounting evidence that the blast was caused by a car_bomb , possibly a van packed with explosives that was driven to the front_doors of the crowded building . &quot; We found the motor of a truck in the crater &quot; carved out by the explosion , said Meir Livne , an Israeli army general who traveled_to Argentina to direct rescue operations by Israeli troops . He spoke through an interpreter . In a sign the investigation will widen , Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella said Monday the government has ordered its ambassador in Lebanon to report home for consultations . The government also has asked_for information from Iran regarding terrorist activities of Iranian nationals in Latin_America . Juan Jose Galeano , the judge in_charge of investigating the case , traveled secretly to Venezuela over the weekend , reportedly to interview Iranian refugees who may have information on the Buenos Aires bombings . The Venezuelan government expelled four Iranian diplomats and declared the Iranian ambassador persona_non_grata on Thursday after the refugees were allegedly kidnaped and tortured by diplomatic personnel . Argentines of all faiths were shocked and unnerved by last week ' s attack . Newspaper_headlines warn of the &quot; The Lebanon-ization of Argentina &quot; while television_programs are giving uninterrupted coverage to recovery operations , with psychologists offering advice . Scores of bomb threats have been reported since the explosion , including one Monday that forced the evacuation of Congress . The Hebraic-Argentine Society said it is closing temporarily because of the number of threats it has received . Police with metal detectors were posted at Jewish schools Monday , the first day back to school for children following the Southern Hemisphere ' s winter vacation .</TEXT>
