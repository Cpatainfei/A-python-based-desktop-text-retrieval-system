   <HEADLINE> SLAUGHTER IN BOSNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * The world ' s inaction to stop the slaughter of people in Bosnia and elsewhere on the planet speaks loudly of the distasteful reality that we humans still can watch genocide , rape and murder , vocalize somewhat about it and continue to do nothing . Personally I believe that our inaction is more reprehensible than the actions of the perpetrators . I feel embarrassed to be a human_being . HOWARD H . BLEICHER Studio City * In response to &quot; Beyond Vietnam , &quot; by Charles A . Kupchan , Opinion , April 17 : Kupchan said , &quot; Comparing Bosnia to Vietnam was wrongheaded for two reasons &quot; -- essentially that the Cold_War is over and our goal is limited in Bosnia . When I awoke with a sucking chest wound in an Army field_hospital at Cu Chi , lying_in the very next bed was a 14-year-old Viet Cong with two short stumps for legs , all bandaged and oozing . There was a soldier at the end of the bed with a loaded weapon watching the kid . I was told he had already tried to escape twice . that ' s what we were fighting in Vietnam . We came_with our technology , our partial commitments , and a &quot; limited &quot; goal , fighting people who had the driven , emotional determination that came from the belief that they had to fight to the last breath to defend their homeland . In Bosnia we would be going_in with our &quot; limited &quot; goal to take_on centuries-old emotionally driven religious and ethnic hatreds . We could go anywhere , do anything in Vietnam , and , as in Afghanistan for the Russians , we could never win . It ' s the hearts and minds of the people , stupid . CHUCK BENNETT Ojai * President Clinton ' s handling of the Bosnia situation leaves much to be desired . If instead of running_away from the Vietnam issue , he had participated in a college ROTC program or had served in the military , he probably would be much better at negotiations . First and foremost , diplomacy with tyrants works only when you are willing to use your military advantage if required . I attended a land-grant college ( University of Wisconsin ) and I had to take two years of ROTC . There was no choice , it was mandatory during the ' 50s . Did I like it ? No . Do I regret it ? No . I learned that there is no glory to war . However , I also learned that if one did not understand and use his military advantage , playing diplomacy with a tyrant is a losing proposition . From Hitler to Radovan Karadzic , all tyrants are alike . Their object is to win , no matter what it costs in human life and misery . Does Clinton really think that dropping less than a dozen bombs in the course of months is really going_to frighten a tyrant who is dropping three cannon shells a minute ? Let ' s get real ! In summary , can our nation develop a successful foreign_policy when the leadership is someone who has no training or understanding of what the military is all about ? DAN BOWMAN San Clemente * Has anybody noticed that all_of those people who criticize President Clinton for not being more aggressive in sending our military_forces to places like Bosnia are the same people who attack him if any of our people get killed or injured in the operation ? If they know a way to fight a war without getting some of our people killed , I sure wish they would let the rest of us in on their secret . SANFORD THIER Palos Verdes Estates</TEXT>
