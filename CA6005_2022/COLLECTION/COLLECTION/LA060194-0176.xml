   <HEADLINE> U.S. OFFICIALS WEIGH N . KOREAN SANCTIONS ; NUCLEAR ARMS : NORTH ' S RAPID REMOVAL OF FUEL RODS FOCUSES ATTENTION ON POSSIBLE U.N. CURBS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton and his top national security officials met Tuesday to consider the potentially volatile question of whether to seek economic sanctions against North_Korea -- a move that Pyongyang has warned would be regarded_as an act of war . Although no final_decisions were expected Tuesday , officials said Clinton wanted a consensus for any future actions by tonight , when he is scheduled to leave for Europe to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of D-day . The flurry of activity came amid growing fears that North_Korea may be removing spent fuel rods from its reactor so rapidly that it is_on the verge of destroying U.N. inspectors ' ability to determine if reprocessed spent fuel has been diverted to make nuclear_weapons . The Administration has warned that it considers the ability of the U.N. inspectors to trace the history of North_Korea ' s nuclear program a crucial issue in the dispute . The situation has been intensifying for days . In a last-ditch effort to avert a crisis , the U.N. Security_Council on Monday urged North_Korea to preserve all existing evidence of possible diversions of nuclear fuel . The U.N.-affiliated International Atomic Energy Agency , which conducts the nuclear inspections , is expected to issue a report this week declaring whether North_Korea has destroyed the agency ' s ability to tell if Pyongyang has started the process of making nuclear_weapons . U.S. officials say that if the IAEA reports its efforts have been blocked , there is little doubt the Security_Council will begin considering sanctions . The question then would be how broad the measures should be and how rapidly they should be imposed . South_Korea said Tuesday that North_Korea already has removed more_than 4 # 800 of 8 # 000 spent fuel rods in the reactor at Yongbyon -- a far more rapid pace than Western analysts had expected . Officials say that at this rate , it could be only days before the evidence is destroyed . The Administration continued to express alarm publicly . &quot; We ' re very concerned about the situation , &quot; White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers told reporters . But she said Washington still hopes for a diplomatic solution . A major problem facing the Administration is uncertainty whether China , which supported Monday ' s U.N. appeal , would go_along with any move to impose formal sanctions . China wants Washington to include negotiations about nuclear issues in broader U.S.-North Korean talks . Pentagon officials said Tuesday that any decision to push for sanctions almost certainly would be accompanied by a step-up in the alert status of U.S. military_forces in the region . North_Korea repeatedly has warned that imposition of sanctions would be regarded_as an act of war . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry has sent Patriot missiles to South_Korea to strengthen allied defenses there and has ordered extra supplies of aircraft parts and ammunition in case the North launches a retaliatory attack . In Vienna , North_Korean officials continued to rebuff IAEA demands that inspectors be permitted to test the rods that have been removed . Yun Ho Jin , Pyongyang ' s representative to the agency , said his government would not alter its policies any time soon , but he said that it would set_aside 40 of the spent fuel rods for possible inspection by the IAEA later . Analysts said the move would be useless . Intelligence reports from Japan also have suggested that North_Korea may be preparing to test a new medium-range missile over the Sea_of_Japan -- a step that could further intensify its confrontation with the West . Myers said Tuesday that Clinton had spoken by telephone late Monday with South_Korean President Kim Young Sam and the two had reaffirmed their support for Monday ' s Security_Council statement .</TEXT>
