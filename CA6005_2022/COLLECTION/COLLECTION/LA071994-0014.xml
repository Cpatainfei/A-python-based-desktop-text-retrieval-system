   <TEXT> * German troops in Bosnia ? Is the author of your editorial intentionally disregarding the lessons of history learned in a hard way when he calls ( &quot; Let Bosnia Be the Starting Place , &quot; July 13 ) for German troops ? Does he know about German aspirations to control the Balkans -- the shortcut between Central Europe and Near East -- better known as their Drang Nach Osten policy , evident for at least a century ? These plans failed to materialize in World_War I when German ( and Austro-Hungarian ) aggression against Serbia was characterized as &quot; imperialism. &quot; Hitler ' s dreams , after occupying and dismembering Yugoslavia in the wake of World_War_II , were short-lived as well . Then they were labeled as &quot; fascism &quot; and &quot; Nazism. &quot; Now , 50 years later , under the &quot; New World Order &quot; doctrine , Germany is eagerly pushed to send troops on the soil of previous defeats -- in former Yugoslavia , for dismemberment of which it bears foremost and major responsibility . So , the &quot; final solution &quot; for the Serbian nation is unveiled by your editorial -- with the first_step to defeat and destroy Bosnian Serbs ( preferably the Serbs in Serbia proper as well ) . While the U.S. will provide air support , ground troops will be contributed by the coalition of European NATO allies ( now with its key player Germany ) and by invigorated and armed ( the arms embargo will be overridden unilaterally , if needed ) Bosnian Muslims , with substantial help of mercenaries from Islamic states all_over the world . So_much for impartiality of the United States and the United Nations regarding the civil_war in former Yugoslavia !
