   <HEADLINE> HOMICIDE DOWN 30 % FROM 1993 ; CRIME : ALL OTHER SERIOUS OFFENSES EXCEPT RAPE ALSO SHOWED DECLINES IN LOS ANGELES COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR , LAPD STATISTICS SHOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles ' homicide rate dropped 30 % and most other serious crime declined in the city during the first_quarter of 1994 , compared with the first_quarter last year , according to statistics released Thursday by the Police_Department . Homicides in the city totaled 176 from January through March of this year , 76 fewer than the 252 during the same period in 1993 . There were similar declines in all other serious crimes except rape , which increased from 386 in the first three months of 1993 to 387 in the first_quarter of 1994 . The general decrease here reflected a nationwide trend , according to the FBI , which said serious crimes reported to police throughout the United States dropped 3 % last year , after increases of 1 % in 1992 , 5 % in 1991 and 11 % in 1990 . The FBI ' s figures show a 7.6 % decrease in reported serious crimes in Los Angeles in 1993 . &quot; Over a period_of_time , the best efforts of not only the police , but the community and the individuals in it , have finally turned the tide against crime , &quot; Cmdr . David Gascon , an LAPD spokesman , said Thursday . &quot; Everybody recognizes that violent crime is an enormously important issue , and we are all focusing_on that , even though we may_not always agree on the possible solutions , &quot; Gascon said . &quot; I think what is important is that people don ' t jump to any short-term , erroneous conclusions . &quot; Statistics don ' t tell the whole story , &quot; he said . &quot; There may be a lot of crime out there that is not reported . The fact that the figures are down is a favorable trend , but each homicide is still a tragedy. &quot; The LAPD statistics released Thursday show the following declines between the first three months in 1993 and the same period in 1994 : * Robberies -- a drop from 9 # 605 to 7 # 999 . * Aggravated assaults -- from 10 # 061 to 9 # 152 . * Burglaries -- from 12 # 911 to 10 # 777 . * Burglaries and thefts from cars -- from 17 # 854 to 16 # 304 . * Thefts from people -- from 839 to 653 . * Other thefts -- from 12 # 329 to 10 # 340 . * Auto thefts -- from 17 # 935 to 14 # 081 . LAPD reports reviewed last week by The Times identified dozens of pockets of crime in the city , including corridors along certain thoroughfares that account_for large portions of the violent crimes reported . Among those corridors are stretches of Broadway , Vernon Avenue and Central Avenue in South-Central Los Angeles , an area surrounding the Northridge Fashion Center and a long stretch of Roscoe Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley . The reports reflected the LAPD ' s frustration at its inability to curb certain types of crime . &quot; The number of arrests for rape seems to have no impact on the numbers of crimes committed , &quot; the LAPD said .</TEXT>
