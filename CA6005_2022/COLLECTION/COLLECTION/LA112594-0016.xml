   <TEXT> Rice , beans and chorizo usually add_up to a delicious , long-simmering stew or soup . However , the mix is also excellent when served at room_temperature as a salad . As curious as it sounds , rice , bean and chorizo salad is a great dish . First of all , it transforms leftovers . Extra cooked rice , a half can of beans or bits of vegetables get a great make-over in this recipe . It ' s also relatively fast . For those who want a dish bursting with flavor but don ' t have two hours to cook it , this is the answer . The base of this salad is chorizo , but other uncooked spicy sausage , crumbled into small pieces , can be substituted . The key to success when using sausage is to cook it thoroughly and drain it completely before mixing it into the other ingredients . Otherwise it will be greasy and unpalatable . * Complete the Tex-Mex accent of this entree by adding cilantro , green_onions and sweet red_pepper . The combination is as good-looking as it is delicious . RICE , BEAN AND CHORIZO SALAD 1 / 2 pound chorizo 1 / 2 cup converted rice 1 cup water 1 cup cooked black_beans ( rinsed , if canned ) 1 small sweet red_pepper , cored , seeded and chopped 1 / 4 cup chopped cilantro 1 / 2 cup chopped green_onions 1 tablespoon red_wine vinegar 1 tablespoon olive_oil Salt Freshly ground white_pepper Break chorizo into small pieces and place in medium pan .
