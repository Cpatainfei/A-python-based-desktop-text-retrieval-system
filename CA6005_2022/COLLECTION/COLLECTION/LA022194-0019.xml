   <HEADLINE> GEORGE RAMOS : CHICANO AGENDA GETTING BIGGER PLAY IN MEXICO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It wasn ' t just another political meeting . Instead of gossiping about the upcoming race for governor or the U.S. Senate , a dozen prominent Mexican American leaders met last weekend in a Downtown Los Angeles hotel to discuss this year ' s presidential election in Mexico and what they want from the new president . They just didn ' t talk_about it . They acted like a special-interest group in an election in this country . The local Chicanos met with a personal emissary of Luis Donaldo Colosio , the presidential candidate of Mexico ' s ruling political_party , and presented him with a list of demands , although the Mexican Americans didn ' t call it that . But it sure looked_like one . The Chicanos want expanded cultural , educational and sports programs between the Mexican government and Mexican Americans . They want the Mexican government to consider using Chicano professionals for various business and government ventures , complaining that qualified Mexican Americans were often passed_over in favor of others . They also asked Mexican officialdom to take the time to better understand Mexican Americans and their place in U.S. society . In return , the Chicanos can become a lobbying force and conduit for Mexican interests and concerns . The 90-minute exchange with Colosio emissary Santiago Onate Laborde , over coffee and Mexican sweet bread , left the Chicano politicos happy but still angling for more leverage in a Mexico rocked by the recent Zapatista uprising in Chiapas . &quot; It was a very productive first meeting , &quot; said Los Angeles school_board President Leticia Quezada . &quot; The purpose of the meeting was our agenda , not the PRI ' s. &quot; * In the past , such a meeting would have been unimaginable . Mexican officials did not take Chicanos and their concerns very seriously because , after all , Chicanos are U.S. citizens . Some Mexicans believed that Chicanos were_on the lower economic and social rung in this country . That belief was strengthened by the inability of many Mexican Americans to speak Spanish , which horrified certain Mexicans , according to Jorge Bustamante , Mexico ' s leading researcher on Chicanos . For their part , Mexican Americans reveled in their heritage and many Mexican traditions . But they were ambivalent about the PRI , which has run Mexico since its inception in 1929 . Their families had left Mexico because they were cynical about PRI ' s dominance and the slim chances for prosperity there . But things have changed . Contacts between the Mexican government and Chicanos started in 1971 during the tenure of President Luis Echeverria and quickened when Carlos Salinas de Gortari assumed the presidency in 1988 . Quezada and other Chicanos met with Salinas in Tijuana and came_away with agreements for Mexican-trained teachers to come_to the United States to help with this country ' s bilingual programs . Also , a Mexican cultural institute was established in Los Angeles . In the debate over the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , Mexican American lawmakers cast key votes_in favor of NAFTA when it passed Congress . There ' s also the_matter of Chiapas . The rebellion in Mexico ' s version of Mississippi has been a public relations nightmare for Salinas , especially in this country . For example , Juan Jose Gutierrez , head of a Boyle Heights nonprofit immigration agency , recently called Colosio a political &quot; dead cadaver &quot; who can ' t win because of Chiapas . Those comments were picked_up and duly noted in Mexico_City . When Onate met the L.A. Chicanos , led by Quezada and Montebello attorney Raul Ayala , he was happy to talk_about Chiapas . He allowed that army abuses probably occurred during the brief fighting but pointedly added that abuses were also committed by the Zapatistas . These things unfortunately occur in times of war , Onate said , citing U.S. atrocities in Vietnam . &quot; No one ( in Mexico ) condones that , but it happened , &quot; Onate said . &quot; We have to confront it and deal with it. &quot; The Chicanos were impressed with Onate ' s response , knowing he reflects the party ' s thinking since he is a rising star in the PRI . They , too , have heard the talk that Onate may become Mexico ' s foreign_minister in a Colosio administration . After that , who knows ? * Colosio isn ' t the only presidential candidate in the Aug . 28 election . There are at least six others , including Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , the populist son of a former president who bolted from the PRI in disgust and nearly defeated Salinas for president in 1988 . &quot; We want to talk to them too , &quot; Quezada said , no doubt remembering an American political lesson of covering your bases .</TEXT>
