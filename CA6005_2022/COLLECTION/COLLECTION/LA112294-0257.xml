   <HEADLINE> HEALTH ; SMOKY ISSUES IN DEBATE OVER NICOTINE PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Should nicotine substitute products designed to help smokers quit cigarettes be available without a prescription ? It is an issue that almost has been overshadowed by the recent national debate over whether the federal_government should regulate tobacco . Nevertheless , at least one manufacturer has asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to consider changing the status of these products , which include gum and skin patches , to make them available over the counter . Proponents of the change argue that making these products more accessible would remove a major obstacle most smokers face in seeking help quitting the habit -- having to see a doctor to get a prescription . Granting over-the-counter status will help more people stop smoking , they say . But other experts raise the very different and disturbing possibility that the easy availability of such items would only create new nicotine addicts . &quot; The classic argument ( in favor of over-the-counter status ) has been : To purchase nicotine in a form that will kill you , you can buy_it from a vending machine in a shopping_mall , &quot; said one anti-smoking lawyer knowledgeable in tobacco regulation . &quot; To purchase it in a form that will help you quit smoking , you have to go_to your doctor . &quot; It ' s a hard question , &quot; added the lawyer , who requested anonymity . &quot; Making people go_to a doctor is a barrier , and costs money . But what about kids , teen-agers , who don ' t smoke , but are looking_for a little bit of a buzz ? If it ' s sitting on the shelf of a mom-and-pop store or a pharmacy , and they can just walk in and buy_it , will nicotine become the next buzz ? &quot; Nicotine , which numerous health and drug_abuse experts have declared addictive , is associated with heart_disease and affects the brain and fetuses . The debate over the use of nicotine replacement products often has focused_on whether users simply trade one harmful habit for another . The health dangers from cigarettes -- which include lung_cancer , emphysema and other respiratory ailments and heart_disease -- come less from nicotine than from inhaling the toxic substances produced by burning the tobacco leaf , experts say . Also , nicotine from gum and patches is less rapidly absorbed by the body , and in less concentrations , than in cigarettes . Smokers who use nicotine patches typically apply a new one each day , usually on an upper arm . At first , the patches usually provide dosage roughly equivalent_to the amount of nicotine an average smoker takes_in each day -- about 25 milligrams . The patch delivers that amount over each 24-hour period for about six weeks . Over the course of the next month or six weeks , the amount of nicotine dispensed by the patch is gradually lowered to enable the smoker to become accustomed to less and avoid the symptoms of abrupt withdrawal . Dr. Jack Henningfield , chief of clinical pharmacology research at the National Institute on Drug_Abuse , stressed that &quot; not all nicotine medications are created equal. &quot; An experimental nicotine nasal spray not yet on the market , for example , has proved very successful in clinical studies . However , many individuals became hooked on the spray and found it extraordinarily difficult to give_up . One dose -- two sprays -- of the nasal drug delivers 1 milligram of nicotine . But unlike the gum and patch therapies , the spray delivers a faster and more direct hit of the drug , similar to cigarettes . For this reason , an FDA advisory panel last summer said the nasal nicotine drug had significant potential for abuse . If that application is approved , the panel recommended strictly controlling it by prescription , limiting the number of refills and requiring strong warnings . In contrast , &quot; the majority of people who go from cigarettes to gum or the patch don ' t become similarly addicted , &quot; Henningfield said . The gum and the patch are &quot; incredibly gentle &quot; forms of nicotine delivery compared to cigarettes , &quot; so gentle that many clinicians think you need more aggressive forms of nicotine delivery to treat heavier addicted smokers , &quot; he said . &quot; For those who stay_on the medication longer than the original prescription , that ' s when you get_into a debate : Is it legitimate medical need ? Or abuse ? &quot;</TEXT>
