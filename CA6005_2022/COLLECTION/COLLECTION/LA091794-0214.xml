   <HEADLINE> MCNALL FACES CREDITORS , DECLINES QUESTIONING ; HOCKEY : FORMER KING OWNER CITES FIFTH_AMENDMENT RIGHT IN REGARD TO INQUIRIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> King President Bruce P . McNall met Friday with his creditors for the first time since entering bankruptcy proceedings in May but declined to shed_light_on his finances because of an ongoing criminal investigation into his banking practices . A significant portion of the two-hour hearing , which was held to allow creditors to ask McNall questions , included inquiries as_to whether McNall has held or continues to hold assets in foreign countries such_as Switzerland or Liechtenstein . McNall repeatedly declined to answer questions from the bankruptcy trustee attorney , Leonard L . Gumport , and French bank Credit Lyonnais attorney Robert Meyer , asserting his Fifth_Amendment right . As previously reported by The Times , McNall has agreed to plead guilty to four criminal counts stemming from a federal bank fraud investigation . Sources say the plea probably will be formally entered no earlier than October because federal prosecutors are busy completing plea agreements from other McNall business associates . The ongoing federal investigation precluded McNall from answering questions about his financial history and topics such_as bank_accounts and wire transfers . McNall is known to have had Swiss bank_accounts in the past when he made frequent trips to Switzerland as part of his international coin businesses . Gumport on Friday questioned McNall about documents showing a wire transfer of funds totaling $ 1 million from an account at First Los Angeles Bank to an account at Union Bank of Switzerland in September of 1993 . The transaction was authorized by three former McNall employees . The line of questions over European funds seemed to annoy McNall ' s attorneys . McNall ' s criminal attorney , Tom Pollack , said after the hearing that R . Todd Neilson , the trustee , is being given access to all McNall records requested . Pollack accused Meyer of &quot; trying to embarrass Bruce with his questions &quot; about the foreign bank_accounts and a Las Vegas trip in May . Meyer asked McNall whether he gambled or had a line of casino credit . Meyer said : &quot; We ' re not into trying embarrass anybody . The only concern is finding_out Mr. McNall ' s assets and liabilities and how he has spent his money in the past . If there are bank_accounts overseas -- which they seem to want to guard with the Fifth_Amendment -- we want to know about them. &quot; Credit Lyonnais , which financed McNall ' s ill-fated venture into movie producing and claims it is owed about $ 120 million , has been the most aggressive creditor . In May , the bank publicly accused McNall of defrauding the bank -- including offering as collateral assets pledged to another bank -- on the eve of McNall ' s sale of 72 % of the Kings to investors Jeffrey P . Sudikoff and Joseph M . Cohen . McNall ' s lawyers have denied those accusations . Separately , McNall ' s lawyers are locked_in a dispute with Neilson over control of a special creditors ' trust set_up before he entered bankruptcy proceedings , one designed to disperse funds . The complicated trust contains a lien on McNall assets formerly held by Bank of America , which was his primary bank before he sold a majority interest of the Kings . One reason the issue of control is considered important is that whoever controls the trust would ultimately control the fate of McNall ' s remaining 28 % stake in the Kings , and would have the power to sell it at some point .</TEXT>
