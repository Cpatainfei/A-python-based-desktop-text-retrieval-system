   <HEADLINE> DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT : SANDRA HARVEY AND FAMILY KEEP AHEAD OF THE GAME WITH COSTA MESA BOUTIQUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bell-bottom jokes may have finally fizzled along with the fad itself after two years of appearing in every designer ' s collection , but for Newport Beach designer Sandra Harvey , the punch_line is bittersweet . Her flared-leg silhouette debuted five years ago -- long before any store buyer had seen bells by big name labels . By being among the first , she received laughs instead of orders from buyers who thought she was kidding . Harvey got a similar response when she showed her long , silk satin slip dresses in 1991 to a buyer at Barneys New York , a store known for taking risks in the face of mainstream fashion . &quot; The buyer said that length would never , never sell , &quot; recalls Alexandra Stanton , Harvey ' s associate . With such dramatic silhouettes as ankle-skimming stretch velvet tubes trimmed in curled ostrich feathers ( about $ 125 ) or long jersey skirts shirred in the back a la Jean Harlowe , Harvey ' s signature style seems revolutionary only for its elegance combined with comfort . &quot; Sandra is always ahead of everyone else . Dealing with buyers whose jobs are_on the line and who don ' t want to take a risk with a new designer just became frustrating , &quot; adds Stanton , who is also Harvey ' s mother . Harvey grew unsatisfied with buyer ' s attempts to edit her designs . On her own , she was developing a private clientele of women she met at nightclubs who begged to buy the clothes off her back . Tired of the hassles of being a retail supplier , Harvey , Stanton and their husbands decided last year to go_into retail themselves . Their showrooms in New York and Los Angeles were closed , and the boutiques and department_stores nationwide were shipped their last order . The four settled_on a location along Newport Boulevard in Costa Mesa , next to hipster magnets Rock N Java and Tower Records , for the first Sandra Harvey Boutique . Her mother pressed her to look_for a space larger than the 400 square_feet the former barber shop offered , but Harvey recalls that her draw to the location was &quot; spiritual. &quot; She had driven by the store often on her way home , every time repeating that the shop space would someday be hers . After a five-month interior make-over , the boutique opened in October . &quot; I ' ve had ( the store ) designed for 10 years , &quot; Harvey says . &quot; This is my dream . It ' s what I wanted my whole life. &quot; The plumbing was yanked out , the ceiling stained and a wall built separating a back storage_room from the rest of the store . A Gothic-like cathedral doorway was cut_into the wall . Chandeliers and refurbished antiques contrast beautifully with the yardage of plush dressing_room curtains sustained by a crude chain . She fought with the landlord and several painters about the floor , which she wanted painted with a leopard pattern . Finally Harvey resigned to get_on her hands and knees and do_it herself , with the help of her family . She clocked their joint effort at 300 hours . Harvey describes the narrow space as &quot; Cleopatra-esque &quot; -- sensuous , intimate and very feminine . &quot; This is a woman ' s boutique , &quot; she declares . &quot; I get so many boys and men in here who later return with their girlfriends and wives to get them out of their jeans and into glamour . Tough men come_in here , but when they see their women walk_out_of the dressing room they turn_to putty. &quot; That effect is no doubt a response to Harvey ' s sartorial philosophy : &quot; I consider a Sandra Harvey woman sexy , sleek , sophisticated , understated . But she leaves a lingering impression that ' s haunting , never loud and never forgotten . She would never wear sequins. &quot; Adds Stanton : &quot; What do women want ? They want to be elegant but sexy . And a man wants to feel proud without feeling he needs to cover her up. &quot; Harvey works in two primary fabrics : matte jersey and stretch velvet . Organza , georgette , cotton linen and a heavy silk satin also make the seasonless collection . Fabrics are cut on the bias , a practice that is expensive , but Harvey says it pays_off because shapes are softer , fitting a woman ' s figure better . &quot; My grandfather was Russian , gorgeous and a fine dresser . He used to tell me that fabric is the most important part of a garment , the way it looks , feels , smells , &quot; Harvey says . Her velour-like velvet is washable and travels well because it doesn ' t crush and it stores compactly . And Harvey adds that it ' s perfect for day and night . The former wardrobe consultant is_well aware of the need for a practical wardrobe . The Basics group , in black or olive stretch velvet , features separates such_as leggings , pullovers , cat suits and bodysuits ; pieces average $ 100 . Designed with a no-fuss sense , these comfortable separates consider such problems as the double-derriere syndrome caused by most bodysuits . Harvey ' s has no snaps or elastic . Items such_as the wrap-around top can also serve more_than one use : Knotted in the front or the back , it serves as a top or a light jacket . &quot; I design for me , &quot; Harvey says . &quot; I have so many events to go_to . I never think , ' Is this going_to sell ? ' &quot; * The opening of Barbarella , a friend ' s nightclub in Los Angeles , last year inspired her to whip_up a long velvet tube with black plastic breast forms that go_over the appropriate area . The special-order gown sells for $ 250 . &quot; Whenever I have something to go_to I design a new outfit , &quot; she says . The holidays proved especially prolific , with a new design a week . Fortunately for Harvey ' s fans , she and her husband , Dana , maintain an active social life year-round . A sculptor , photographer , painter and all-around artist , Dana met Sandra seven years ago when he was a baby-sitter for her three children , now age 9 to 14 . They married in 1990 and had a child , now 4 . * Fashion has become a family affair . There is the partnership with her parents , Alexandra and Thomas Stanton , who commute from La Jolla a_few times a week to mind the store . Their involvement has allowed Sandra to concentrate more on the creative side of the business , while Mom and Dad wrestle with the numbers . The New Zealand native and son of a seamstress , Dana , 26 , designs a line of avant-garde wear , Angel Boy , to cater to the eclectic club rats of Los Angeles ( select items are available at the Sandra Harvey Boutique ) . Harvey ' s eldest daughter , Candice , serves as the Sandra Harvey model , gracing posters and other promotional_material . Only 14 , she can appear twentysomething -- just like her 34-year-old mother . Indeed , the two are often mistaken as sisters ; and Harvey ' s mother looks far younger than her 52 years . Their fountain_of_youth is a formula handed_down for generations that Alexandra Stanton is bottling into a line of natural skin_care products to be sold in the store this year . Working alongside this venture is Sandra Harvey , who will debut a signature line of &quot; extremely matte &quot; lipsticks this month , as well as a namesake fragrance later . &quot; You can do without the other cosmetics , but never lipstick or perfume , &quot; she insists . Other plans for this year include a boutique along Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles . Eventually , Harvey says , she would like to see a chain of boutiques along shopping boulevards internationally . She says she will also continue her advocacy of homeless children and basic health_care with such organizations as Child Help USA . Fashion-wise this year , Harvey won ' t be joining the punk renaissance that Paris and Milan are slamming spring with . That dress decorated with rows of gleaming silver safety_pins on the cover of style bible &quot; W &quot; in November ? Harvey did_it in ' 92 . Gianni Versace may have never heard of Sandra Harvey , but she has gotten used to this kind of &quot; coincidence. &quot; She keeps the pinned dress ( long , $ 300 ; short , $ 225 ) around because &quot; the club girls love it. &quot; Instead Harvey has returned to her favorite eras , the ' 20s and ' 30s , playing with pink , a shade she considers perfectly rococo and fitting with the beaded tassels and delicate point shoes she predicts will be a hit this year . But still expect a blackout through the collection . Although she occasionally sees use for colors such_as red , turquoise or olive , color , she says , &quot; is an accessory. &quot; Her silhouettes will continue their slinky feel . But the designer warns : &quot; You don ' t have to be skinny to be slinky. &quot; &quot; I always loved ' 20s and ' 30s glamour . I love the elegance , &quot; she says . Harvey , who will wear a boa like it ' s a scarf , is nicknamed &quot; glamour puss &quot; by her buddies . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s being a glamour puss . I ' ll go_to the grocery_store dressed the same as going_to a club , &quot; she quips . &quot; I ' ve always idolized older_women like my grandmother , the way they dress , the jewelry , the powders . It was my grandma who bought my first sewing machine. &quot; After graduating from making doll clothes ( which she sometimes made of clothing taken without permission from her mother ' s closet ) , a teen-age Harvey turned_to stitching outfits for herself -- and friends who pestered her . She took classes in pattern-making , design and illustrating for &quot; six years on and off &quot; at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa . &quot; I ' m obsessed with fashion ; it ' s the only thing that matters_to me , &quot; she says . With the entrance into retail , the family now makes its own patterns and samples and keeps production to a limited number of units , usually six or fewer of a style in a particular fabric . Harvey says this is a way to ensure that a customer won ' t be wearing the same outfit as everyone else at a party . &quot; They ' re supposed to be special , &quot; she says , &quot; like couture. &quot; The quality of couture is apparent in Harvey ' s collection -- without the couture prices . Items retail for $ 40 to $ 300 ; the higher price_tags are custom suits and gowns . At the boutique , Harvey offers her personal attention to customers , including fittings , something she says she missed as a manufacturer . &quot; Everything here fits every woman : curvaceous , rail , short or tall . Women come_in saying ' I don ' t have the figure for this stuff. ' They come_in insecure of their bodies . They leave proclaiming ' I am a woman. ' that ' s why I ' m in this business . I just live to see women beautiful. &quot;</TEXT>
