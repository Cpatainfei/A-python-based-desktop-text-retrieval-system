   <HEADLINE> ALPO PURCHASE MAY MAKE NESTLE TOP_DOG IN PET_FOOD INDUSTRY ; ACQUISITIONS : A PENDING $ 510-MILLION CASH DEAL WOULD GIVE IT A BIGGER BITE OF OVERALL U.S. MARKET , EDGING OUT NO . 1 RALSTON PURINA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nestle USA Inc. , best known as the maker of chocolate_candy bars , Taster ' s Choice coffees and Stouffer ' s frozen foods , moved Monday to capture market share among customers who walk on all fours and eat from plastic bowls . In a deal that analysts said should vault the company to the top of the cluttered pet_food industry , Nestle agreed to acquire Alpo Petfoods from London-based Grand Metropolitan for $ 510 million in cash . The transaction , subject_to legal and regulatory approval , would give Nestle 17.1 % of the market in the $ 8.4-billion U.S. pet_food industry , narrowly edging out Ralston Purina , which has 17.0 % market share . Nestle ' s Friskies PetCare Division is already a market leader in canned cat_food , with its Friskies , Fancy Feast and other brands . But the purchase of Alpo would enable Nestle USA , the Glendale-based unit of Swiss food giant Nestle , to enhance its somewhat weaker presence in the dog_food market , where it offers Mighty Dog and Come ' N Get It brands . &quot; Alpo is one of the most recognized consumer brands of dog_food , &quot; said Joe Weller , chief_executive of Nestle USA . &quot; The Alpo brand conveys quality to consumers and will enable us to compete more effectively against the market leaders in the dog_food segment of the pet_food industry. &quot; The acquisition should boost Nestle to the No . 2 position in the canned dog_food market , with market share jumping from 9 % to 25 % , said Nomi Ghez , a food industry_analyst with Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co . The current leader is Mars Inc. , maker of Kal Kan . Alpo ' s smaller cat_food business should boost Nestle ' s share of canned cat_food sales from 33 % to 41 % , Ghez said . For Grand Metropolitan , the sale of Alpo means leaving the pet_food market altogether to focus_on the leading consumer foods brands -- including Pillsbury baked foods , Green Giant canned goods and Haagen-Dazs ice_cream -- that make_up its Pillsbury Co . subsidiary . Paul Walsh , chief_executive of Minneapolis-based Pillsbury , said in a written statement that Alpo ' s middle-of-the-pack position in the pet_food industry made_it a strategic misfit with the company ' s higher-profile food brands . &quot; Our objective is to maintain No . 1 or 2 positions in our major businesses , &quot; Walsh said . &quot; Alpo has been the exception. &quot; Allentown , Pa.-based Alpo , acquired by Grand Metropolitan in 1980 , will post operating profit of $ 47 million on sales of $ 430 million for its fiscal_year ending Sept . 30 . A company spokesman said revenue has been flat in recent years . The transaction was seen as a closing of the ranks in an industry that analysts say is ripe for consolidations . While most food categories are dominated by two or three companies , half_a_dozen large companies and a number of smaller labels compete in the pet_food industry , analysts said . &quot; In breakfast cereals , to be No . 1 you have to have about 35 % market share , &quot; said Les Pugh , an analyst with Salomon Bros . &quot; Here we ' re talking_about No . 1 with 17 % share. &quot; The industry is facing increased cost pressures , Pugh said , because growth in sales volume has slowed in recent years and the number of pet_food retailers has expanded and become more specialized . &quot; You ' re dealing with a much wider array of operators who clearly demand exceedingly competitive terms , &quot; Pugh said . By combining Alpo with its Friskies division , Nestle advances its market share , but it should also achieve significant cost savings , analysts said . &quot; The businesses are very similar , and you probably have a lot of duplication , &quot; Ghez said . &quot; You probably don ' t need all_the salesmen and employees that Grand Metropolitan currently employs. &quot; Laurie MacDonald , a spokeswoman for Nestle , said the company will spend the next few months considering how best to integrate the businesses . She said it is &quot; too early to talk_about any changes. &quot; Nestle had sales of $ 39.1 billion last year , including $ 7.2 billion in sales at its Nestle USA subsidiary , MacDonald said . Pet_Food Market Share With its acquisition of Alpo , Nestle will edge past Ralston Purina with 17.1 % of the $ 8.4 billion U.S. pet_food market . 1993 market share based on revenue : Ralston Purina : 17 % Nestle : 11.5 Kal Kan ( Mars ) : 8.8 Heinz : 7.9 Hill ' s : 7.8 Quaker Oats : 5.8 Ol ' Roy : 5.7 Alpo : 5.6 IAMS : 4.1 Nutro : 2.1 Others : 23.7 Source : The Maxwell Report</TEXT>
