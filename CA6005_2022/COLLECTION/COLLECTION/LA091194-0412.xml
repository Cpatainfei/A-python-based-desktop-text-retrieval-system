   <HEADLINE> LIVING SCARED ; DOSE OF SKEPTICISM ENTERS COVERAGE ON ENVIRONMENT ; BIAS : SYMPATHETIC EARLY STORIES WERE SPURRED BY AN EFFORT TO &quot; SAVE THE EARTH. &quot; AS THE PROFESSION MATURES , REPORTING IS MORE CONTRARIAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> John Stossel has come a long way since his days as a young consumer reporter for KGW-TV in Portland , Ore. , in the early 1970s . In those days , he says , &quot; we consumer reporters approached it from the bias that on the one hand is business , which is greedy and has an ulterior motive and will distort the data , and on the other hand is the noble environmental group , which has no motive other_than to help the public. &quot; &quot; I ' m embarrassed to say that it took me years to realize that their data were often soft , if not absurd , and that they had their own venal motives . . . to get_on TV , to get famous , to get more grant money. &quot; Three months ago , Stossel shared his discovery with 16 million television viewers nationwide . He produced an ABC News special -- &quot; Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death ? &quot; -- in which he argued that media reports and political posturing suggesting that &quot; there ' s danger everywhere and it ' s all getting_worse . . . just isn ' t true. &quot; Stossel is part of a backlash , a revisionist or contrarian movement among a growing number of journalists who believe that the media have needlessly alarmed the American public with biased coverage of many environmental and other risk issues . &quot; It seems to me the environmental groups . . . tend to get a sympathetic hearing from the press , &quot; says Nicholas Wade , science and health editor of the the New York Times , &quot; whereas the industry side , you ' re skeptical of them right from the start. &quot; Sympathetic coverage of the environmental movement in its early days in the 1970s was probably almost inevitable , given the confluence of the media ' s perennial desire for both simple news and bad news , and the emotional identification that many reporters felt with the environmental movement . To them , &quot; saving the Earth &quot; was not the sort of partisan political or ideological issue they had been trained to avoid taking sides on ; it was a nonpartisan effort to make life better for everyone . Many journalists who write_about the environment acknowledge that their colleagues have tended to write from a pro-environmentalist standpoint , to make common cause with environmental activists , forging a bond that led to &quot; a difficulty for environmental journalists to objectively cover the environmental groups , &quot; in the words of Richard Stone , a writer for Science magazine . Standards for environment writers and others who write_about risk issues have improved considerably in recent years . &quot; There ' s more context now , more precision . . . an increasing sophistication about magnitudes of risk , &quot; says Baruch Fischhoff , a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh . To Boyce Rensberger , longtime science writer for the Washington Post , this represents a coming of_age for environmental journalism , the same sort of transformation he saw take_place with science writers a decade or more ago , when they began to &quot; write stories with a more skeptical tone. &quot; Early science writers were inexperienced and prone to believe whatever scientists told them , Rensberger and others say . In the case of environmental reporting , the unchallenged sources were often environmental activists and their scientists . This resulted in what Frank Clifford , an environment reporter for the Los Angeles Times , calls a &quot; one-sided debate. &quot; &quot; We didn ' t believe the industry scientists because we were conditioned not to trust them , &quot; Clifford says . Not surprisingly , stories on the environment have often been written with &quot; an unquestioning , alarmist spin , &quot; in Rensberger ' s words . Despite recent improvements , many journalists worry that the alarmist spin continues in some quarters -- and may be getting_worse in some ways . They say that increasing competition for readers ' and viewers ' time -- and the attention-getting impact of tabloid media -- are forcing reporters to oversimplify their stories and play_up conflict , drama , emotion and doomsday scenarios even more . &quot; The media are becoming less capable of dealing with an increasingly complex world , &quot; if only because the space and time that most editors and news directors make available for the average story is much less than it was 10 years ago , says Diane Dumanoski , the longtime science and environment reporter for the Boston Globe , who is_on leave to write a book on the impact that artificial chemicals have_on fetal development . Moreover , as Casey Bukro , environment reporter for the Chicago Tribune says : &quot; There are still environmental activists working for the mainstream media. &quot; On the other hand , Rensberger , Keith Schneider of the New York Times and Gregg Easterbrook of Newsweek have , in a sense , become the de_facto leaders of the-sky-is-NOT-falling movement . Last year , Rensberger wrote : &quot; After nearly a decade of headlines and hand-wringing about erosion of the Earth ' s protective ozone_layer , the problem appears to be_well on the way to solution . . . ( with scientists unable to ) find any solid evidence that serious harm was or is being done. &quot; Some journalists criticized that story . Sharon Begley , a senior writer who covers science and the environment for Newsweek , said it represented &quot; somewhat twisted logic. &quot; Rensberger has also challenged the traditional environmentalist view on global warming -- the greenhouse_effect , the phenomenon by which a significant rise in the Earth ' s temperature , caused by modern_man , is thought by many to be causing irreversible changes that will severely disrupt human life , causing flooding , famine and mass relocation . Most scientists seem to agree that there is some sort of greenhouse_effect , but they do not agree on what has caused it , whether it is unprecedented and what impact it will have . Rensberger has written that the changes measured to date in the environment are &quot; no bigger than those the Earth has undergone in recent centuries through entirely natural processes. &quot; Computer models that are &quot; the chief basis for forecasts of blood and doom are flawed , &quot; Rensberger wrote in 1992 . Seldom , he said , has an issue &quot; risen to the top of the international political agenda while the facts of the_matter remained so uncertain. &quot; Rensberger was criticized by some colleagues for this story , too , but he strongly defends his work and he has his supporters -- among them Easterbrook , who wrote a similar story in Newsweek . Indeed , Easterbrook argues that rather than continuing to sound alarms , journalists and environmentalists should recognize that environmental protection &quot; is one public policy and technology area where programs are successful , ( where there is ) something to be optimistic about. &quot; Environmentalism , he says -- not the public_schools or the criminal justice system -- is the true &quot; triumph of liberalism &quot; in our society .</TEXT>
