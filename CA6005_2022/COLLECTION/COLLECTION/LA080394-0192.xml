   <TEXT> In a move to strengthen its life_insurance and consumer finance businesses , American General Corp . said Tuesday that it has offered to buy Unitrin Inc. , a Chicago-based insurer , for $ 2.6 billion . It is the second time American General has offered to buy the company for that amount in recent weeks . Its first attempt , made July 12 , was rejected July 26 by Unitrin ' s board , Houston-based American General said in a statement . The first offer was $ 50.375 a share , or $ 2.6 billion in cash , for Unitrin ' s 51.8 million outstanding shares , American General said . American General has been expanding its life_insurance and consumer finance businesses through acquisitions and by selling_off property and casualty lines over the last several years , analysts said . Unitrin , which is more_than one-third American General ' s size in terms of revenue , would be among the largest purchases the company has made . &quot; It would be a significant acquisition for American General , &quot; said Frederick T .

Unitrin , a holding company with 7 # 500 employees , offers life and health_insurance and consumer_loans through subsidiaries primarily in the Midwest and West . It also has a casualty and property insurance business . American General said its latest offer represents a 30 % premium over the value of Unitrin common_stock as of July 11 and more_than 100 % over the current market_value of the company ' s operating businesses . As such , the offer is fair and higher than the highest price at which Unitrin shares have ever traded , the American General statement said . The company indicated that it would consider a higher price should Unitrin demonstrate &quot; additional value &quot; during merger negotiations . Harold S . Hook , American General chairman and chief_executive , said the combined company would serve more_than 8 million households and have assets of $ 50 billion and revenue of $ 6 billion . American General officials were not available for further comment ; Unitrin officials were not available . The offer expires Sept . 12 and is subject_to a merger_agreement between it and Unitrin , American General said .
