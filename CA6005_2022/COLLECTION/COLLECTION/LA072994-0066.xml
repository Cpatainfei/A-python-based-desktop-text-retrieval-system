   <HEADLINE> IRAN OFFICIALS MAY BE LINKED TO JEWISH CENTER BOMBING , ARGENTINA SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Diplomatic relations between Argentina and Iran were strained to the breaking point Thursday after the Buenos Aires government received evidence that implicates Iranian officials in the bombing of a Jewish community_center that killed nearly 100 people . &quot; If the evidence is proven true , it leads right to the Iranian Embassy &quot; in Buenos Aires , a well-placed Argentine government source said . Publicly , Argentina has stopped short of formally accusing Iran , but tensions between the two countries have been rising steadily ever since a powerful car_bomb on July 18 ripped through the center of Argentina ' s century-old Jewish community , the largest in Latin_America . A day later , a Panamanian plane carrying Jewish and Israeli businessmen -- and two U.S. citizens -- was downed by a bomb , killing all 21 people aboard . And this week two bombs exploded near the Israeli Embassy and in a Jewish neighborhood in London , injuring 19 . Iran ' s ambassador to Argentina was summoned to the Foreign Ministry for questioning for two consecutive days this week , and Buenos Aires on Wednesday recalled its ambassador in Tehran for consultations . Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella will appear today before the U.N. Security_Council to demand a condemnation of the bombing as part of a surge in international terrorism . While he does not plan to single_out Iran before the United Nations , Di Tella told The Times that he will ask_for measures that make_it easier to prosecute diplomats who are found to have participated in terrorist acts . &quot; If the participation ( of Iran ) is proven . . . we will respond with the maximum firmness , &quot; Di Tella said in an interview Thursday . &quot; It ' s a very sensitive moment &quot; in Argentine-Iranian relations . Iran , through its ambassadors here and at the United Nations , has denied involvement in the bombing . The pro-Iran fundamentalist organization Hezbollah was blamed for the 1992 bombing of Israel ' s embassy in Buenos Aires , which killed 29 , and a group thought to be associated with Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the July 18 attack . The case , which is in the hands of federal Judge Juan Jose Galeano , centers_on information provided by an Iranian defector who is seeking asylum in Venezuela . Galeano traveled secretly to Venezuela last weekend to question the man , Monousheh Moatamer . According to sources , Moatamer implicated at least two and as_many as five people who work_at the Iranian Embassy in Buenos Aires . &quot; The information he gave me is of extreme importance , &quot; Galeano said , declining to provide further details . Speculation here has focused_on the Iranian ambassador , Hadi Soleimanpour , and cultural_attache Moshe Rabbani . Both deny any role in the bombing or in harboring or providing assistance to the bombers . World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman , in Buenos Aires to show solidarity with the Jewish community , told a news_conference that Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem vowed to break_off diplomatic ties with Iran if Iran ' s role is proven . Menem , speaking later to Argentine reporters , sought to soften the statement , saying Argentina ' s diplomatic actions against Iran would depend_on the case Judge Galeano presents . Argentina faces two problems in suspending relations with Iran , according to diplomatic sources . About 300 Argentines live_in Iran , and their safety is a concern . Also , Argentina sells more_than $ 100 million in grains to Iran annually . The Menem government , however , is under intense pressure to show it can investigate the attack and bring the bombers to justice . Many in the Jewish community blame the government ' s lack of resolve in the past for creating the conditions that permitted the July 18 tragedy . The 1992 bombing was never resolved and no one was ever arrested . Two Iranians have reportedly been arrested in last week ' s attack , including a woman detained at the airport when she tried to leave the country with an altered passport . Argentine wire_services reported late Thursday that three more people were arrested , including a man of &quot; Arab heritage. &quot;</TEXT>
