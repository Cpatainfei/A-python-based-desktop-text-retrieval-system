   <HEADLINE> MAX BILL , 85 ; CONTROVERSIAL SWISS ; ARTIST , SCULPTOR AND WRITER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Max Bill , the controversial Swiss artist , sculptor and former politician , has died of a heart_attack . He was 85 . Bill , who was also an architect and writer , suffered a heart_attack Friday at Berlin ' s airport as he was waiting for a flight to Zurich . He died en route to the hospital . From 1927 to 1929 , Bill was at Germany ' s famous Bauhaus school of architecture and applied arts , where he was influenced by the work of Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky . Described by the New York-based Art News magazine in 1989 as the &quot; leading light &quot; of the Concrete and Constructivist art_movements , Bill applied what he called a &quot; mathematical &quot; approach to art . His paintings and granite sculptures showed bold geometric designs in what he said was an attempt to &quot; represent abstract_thoughts in a sensuous and tangible form. &quot; Bill , the son of a railroad official , lived and worked mainly in Zurich , where he designed his house . His home was a treasure_trove of paintings by other prominent artists , most of them his friends , such_as Klee , Kandinsky , Piet Mondrian , Alberto Giacometti and Fritz Glarner . The Los Angeles County Museum of Art exhibited a retrospective of Bill ' s paintings and sculptures in 1974 . Times art critic Henry J . Seldis said at the time that &quot; Bill -- a professorial-looking bespectacled man of ideas -- certainly knows how not to waste his efforts as he pursues his multitudinous activities as artist , architect , parliamentarian and environmentalist with methodological calm and deep conviction. &quot; Bill considered his myriad activities all related to changing the world ' s living conditions . &quot; Art is a kind of mode for life without compromise , &quot; he told The Times in 1974 . &quot; Art is not something created in an ivory_tower but rather a model for a more spiritual world. &quot; In the early 1950s Bill planned the construction of the Ulm Design College in southern Germany , which sought to continue the Bauhaus concept . He was its first rector , but stepped_down in 1956 because of disputes within the school . No stranger to controversy , Bill caused an uproar in Zurich in 1988 when he refused to attend a party the city threw to celebrate his 80th birthday . He said he was irritated by the fuss and felt special exhibitions organized by local museums to show his work were unrepresentative . Bill wrote books about Le Corbusier , Kandinsky , Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and artistic theory . His paintings are displayed in many museums around the world . His other architectural work included an office_building in Germany , a radio studio in Zurich and a bridge in eastern Switzerland . His biggest sculptures are_on display in Switzerland , Germany and Israel . Bill was also involved in politics . He was elected to the Zurich municipal council in 1961 and was a Federal Parliament deputy from 1967 to 1971 as a member of the Independent Landesring Party . He is survived by his second wife , Angela , and a child , Jakob , an archeologist of international repute who also paints .</TEXT>
