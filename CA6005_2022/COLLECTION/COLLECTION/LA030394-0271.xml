   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS SEARCHING FOR ' MISSING ' QUAKES ; GEOLOGY : DATA SHOWS TOO FEW TEMBLORS TO ACCOUNT FOR FAULT SHIFTS , RESEARCHERS TELL HOUSE PANEL . SOME SAY THIS COULD MEAN A SERIES OF NORTHRIDGE-LEVEL JOLTS IN COMING DECADES , OR A SINGLE MUCH BIGGER ONE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scientists examining movement along faults in Southern California said Wednesday that the region may be in_for a series of earthquakes comparable_to the Northridge temblor -- or a single far greater quake -- in upcoming decades . Lucile M . Jones , a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena , told a House committee that the Southern California Earthquake Center has looked_at 150 years of quake data and concluded that there have not been enough quakes to explain all_the shifting along faults . Testifying at a hearing of the Science , Space and Technology Committee , Jones said the region has experienced &quot; only one-third the number of large and major earthquakes &quot; expected , given the rate of movement along faults . &quot; Where are the missing earthquakes ? &quot; Jones said . Her answer was that stresses accumulated inside the earth may be unleashed in the coming decades . In Los Angeles , the executive_director of the Southern California Earthquake Center said he was &quot; a little bit aghast &quot; that the conclusions were announced Wednesday , but he added that the findings are endorsed by scientists in the group . There is some disagreement , however , about the probability of quakes . &quot; We ' ve reached a point now where our models are predicting more Northridge-type earthquakes or bigger earthquakes in the future than we ' ve had in the last 150 years , &quot; said Tom Henyey , the center ' s executive_director . The Southern California Earthquake Center was established by the National Science Foundation to improve the methodology for forecasting quake movement in Southern California . Highlighting the lack of certainty in earthquake analysis , Henyey added that it is also possible that seismic stress has not increased . Scientists are still evaluating data for a detailed report to be released this summer , he said . Nonetheless , the center ' s overall finding is consistent with concerns expressed by other scientists that the Jan . 17 Northridge quake may have been a forerunner , if not a foreshock , to a more intense temblor or a series of quakes . Allan Lindh , chief of seismology for the Geological Survey at Menlo Park , said Wednesday there were one or two serious earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay Area each decade for 70 years before the catastrophic quake in 1906 . He said that such a pattern -- which has also been recorded in Japan and Russia -- appears to be repeating itself in Southern California in recent decades . &quot; Is this evidence that the stress level in the ground in Southern California is building back to_the_point where there will be another great earthquake ? &quot; Lindh said in an interview . &quot; The answer is probably yes . Then the question is : How soon ? We probably don ' t know. &quot; Jones , who is also a visiting research associate at Caltech , offered three possible explanations for what she called &quot; the L.A. dilemma. &quot; The first is that the region is in_for &quot; at least five more earthquakes as large as the Northridge earthquake , &quot; a magnitude 6.8 , she said . Under this scenario , the high rate of damaging quakes in the Los Angeles area in the last six years may be the long-term norm . The second option , Jones said , is that &quot; we are building_up the stress to a much larger earthquake &quot; of magnitude 7.5 to 8 . She said that &quot; only one magnitude 8 would be needed to release the energy of 30 magnitude 7 events. &quot; The third possibility is that movement on the faults is occurring without precipitating earthquakes . Jones said such slippage might explain some of the &quot; missing &quot; quakes but not all . Slippage of faults without corresponding quakes has been &quot; shown to be an important part of the picture elsewhere in the world but not so far in Southern California , &quot; she said . Determining which of the explanations , or combination of them , is right would require &quot; analysis of five to 10 years of data from improved geodetic and seismic networks , &quot; Jones said . She said that funding is inadequate for research on earthquake prediction and analysis . Henyey said that the earthquake center ' s study was based on historic seismic activity , examination of the sidewalls of major faults dating_back as far as 3 # 000 years and a relatively new process of using satellites to measure movements of Earth ' s crust as small as a millimeter . He said that the center has devised an analytic model that indicates &quot; the earth is apparently straining at a much more rapid rate than would be suggested by past earthquake history. &quot;</TEXT>
