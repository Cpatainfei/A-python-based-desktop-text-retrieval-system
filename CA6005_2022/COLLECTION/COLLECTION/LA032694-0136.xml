   <HEADLINE> TEACHERS GET LESSONS ON KEEPING PEACE ; SCHOOLS : VENTURA HIGH INSTRUCTORS ARE TOLD RACIAL TENSIONS HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN INCREASED VIOLENCE ON MANY CAMPUSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping to put a stop to recent racial fights at Ventura High_School , teachers at the school spent Friday learning how to help students appreciate racial and cultural diversity and to solve disputes peacefully . The daylong workshop was led by Judith Rubenstein , a Santa Barbara-based specialist in conflict-resolution techniques . Rubenstein told the 60 teachers that problems at Ventura High are not unique . &quot; Almost every school in Southern California has experienced an increase in violence , &quot; she said . &quot; And it is at least partially attributable to a rise in racial tensions and the use of racial slurs. &quot; Rubenstein urged teachers to get involved in settling disputes on campus . To be effective , she suggested that an intervening teacher should stay cool and help teen-agers sort_out why they are angry . If the teacher adopts that posture , she said , the instructor will be seen as a neutral third_party and can often help the two sides work_out a mutually agreeable resolution . She said the next step is to train a corps of Ventura High students to mediate conflicts among classmates . About 30 students are scheduled for such mediation training next month . The benefits of mediation are many , Rubenstein said . Schools that have started such programs report declines in their suspension rate , she said . A handful of Ventura middle and elementary_schools started student-mediation programs earlier this school_year and they have been largely successful , officials said . At Ventura ' s Anacapa Middle_School , officials credit student mediators with dramatically reducing the number of fights this school_year , leading to an 80 % decline in_suspensions . After seeing those results , district administrators decided to bring the program to Ventura High_School . The district hopes to eventually train student mediators at all Ventura ' s schools , Supt . Joseph Spirito said . After the morning session , the teachers broke_into groups of 10 and talked_about various ways they can intervene when disputes erupt in their classrooms . In one group session , counselor Bill Tice said teachers should make_a_point of telling students that teachers are offended when they hear a racial slur . Some teachers suggested that repeat offenders could be referred for cultural-diversity training and the curriculum should include more information on the contributions of minorities . Charles Enterline , a biology teacher at Ventura High for 14 years , said it will be difficult for teachers to bring_about any real change in students ' attitudes . &quot; We can deal with the incidents , but we can ' t solve the problem of racism , &quot; Enterline said . &quot; You can ' t change 15 to 18 years of indoctrination at_home with a conflict-resolution meeting that lasts a half-hour , &quot; he said . Patricia Kochel , an English_teacher , disagreed_with Enterline . &quot; You never know what kind of effect you ' re going to have_on someone , &quot; she said . Responded Enterline : &quot; I ' m not saying we shouldn ' t try . We should . But we have to be realistic. &quot; Spirito sought Rubenstein ' s help after conflicts between white and black students sparked clashes at two Ventura High basketball_games earlier this year . Four teen-agers described by police as white_supremacists were arrested during the confrontations . In those incidents , white students taunted the black students and made a threat to a black school guard , authorities said . Assistant Principal Helena Torrez-Reaves said she will sort through all_of the suggestions made by teachers and issue a report to the school ' s multicultural committee in coming weeks . The school hopes to develop guidelines to help teachers mediate disputes . At least one teacher was satisfied with the conference . &quot; I got a lot of things out of it , &quot; Sue Andrews said . &quot; I hope we can follow_up_on them. &quot;</TEXT>
