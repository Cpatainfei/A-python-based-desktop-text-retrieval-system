   <HEADLINE> INDIA QUAKE VETERANS STUDY LOCAL RESPONSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> N . Raghunathan , chief_secretary for the Indian state of Maharashtra , witnessed massive death and destruction in the 6.4-magnitude earthquake that killed more_than 8 # 000 people in his country in September and caused nearly $ 800 million in damage . Still , as he stood before the collapsed Northridge Meadows Apartments_building Monday as part of an official delegation visiting from India , he was taken_aback by the random destruction caused by the Jan . 17 Northridge quake . &quot; It ' s amazing , &quot; Raghunathan said as he stared at the remains of the flattened three-story complex where 16 people died , while another three-story complex next to it did not collapse . &quot; How could that happen ? &quot; The four-member delegation from India was only the latest in a growing number of foreign government officials visiting Los Angeles to study the joint federal and state response to the 6.8-magnitude quake that killed 57 people . In the past few weeks , government officials from Canada , Korea , Germany , France , Argentina , Chile and Taiwan have visited disaster relief centers and earthquake damage sites . Last week , 30 government officials from Japan visited an Earthquake Service Center in Chatsworth . They represented Japan ' s ministries of health and welfare , transport , posts and telecommunications and construction , as well as Japan ' s Fire Defense Agency , National Land Agency , Science and Technology Agency and National Police Agency . There are many similarities among the Northridge and Killari , India , quakes . The Sept . 30 quake in a remote area of southwest India struck at 3:56 a.m. , only 35 minutes minutes earlier than the one here . In both quakes , most people were asleep at the time and had very little time , if any , to escape . The immediate loss of electricity also left both areas in total_darkness during the first few hours after the quake . Most of the dead in both quakes were crushed to death . Both quakes also seemed to destroy some buildings while leaving others on the same block virtually untouched . The massive destruction in both quakes attracted curious spectators , which in the early hours of the Killari quake impeded relief efforts . Kuljit S . Sidhu , secretary and special commissioner with the earthquake relief and rehabilitation commission in Bombay , said the death toll was higher in India primarily because it hit densely populated villages where most of the homes were old and constructed of mud with stone rooftops . &quot; Killari was an area not prone to earthquakes , &quot; Sidhu said . &quot; The buildings were very old and not built according to any seismic codes . After seeing the damage here , it seems you have buildings constructed to seismic codes. &quot; The Indian delegation met with officials from the California Governor ' s Office of Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency , which are jointly coordinating post-quake assistance efforts . The group then toured disaster sites , including Cal State Northridge , the Northridge Fashion Center and the Northridge Meadows Apartments , as well as an Earthquake Service Center in Chatsworth . Raghunathan said that unlike the disaster assistance process in the United States , in which centers were set_up for victims to apply for aid , Indian government officials went_to the people to offer help . Instead of assistance consisting_of grants and low-interest loans , the Indian government awarded only grants . &quot; But in an urban_area like this , this approach is probably best , &quot; Raghunathan said after touring the service center in Chatsworth . &quot; I think they are doing a great job . I ' m very impressed. &quot;</TEXT>
