   <HEADLINE> EDUCATORS REACH_OUT TO STUDENTS ; COUNSELING : SUPPORT GROUPS , STARTED BY THE VENTURA DISTRICT , TOUCHES_ON ISSUES RANGING FROM SELF-ESTEEM TO EATING DISORDERS TO COPING WITH PARENTS ' DIVORCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last year , Beth ' s feelings about her chaotic family life spilled_over into her behavior at school . After her mother was hospitalized for emotional problems , the Ventura High_School student began to break_down in tears in the middle of her classes . &quot; My friends would try to help me , &quot; the 17-year-old said . &quot; But they couldn ' t do anything about it. &quot; Now , she attends group counseling -- at school . The 11th-grader is one of about 200 students at Ventura High who miss one class per week to attend support groups on issues ranging from self-esteem to eating disorders . All together , Ventura High has 18 such groups and plans this spring to launch two more -- one to bring_together female African American students and another to help young people deal with grief . Most of the groups are led by professional counselors who volunteer their time . Praised by local mental_health professionals as both thorough and extensive , Ventura High ' s network of support groups won the school a state award last year . But Ventura High officials say some of the credit for the program goes_to the Ventura Unified School District board of trustees , which eight years ago issued a policy requiring school counselors and administrators to actively intervene in the personal problems of their students . Spurred by concerns about drug and alcohol_abuse among students , the district initially launched the school-based support groups , called the student assistance program , at its two high_schools . Now the program has trickled down to the lower grades so that nearly every school offers some type of group counseling , including elementary_school support groups for children from divorced families . The district ' s attention to students ' mental_health reflects the changing role of public_schools , school officials said . &quot; It ' s no longer just teaching the academics , &quot; said Ricardo Nargi , the district ' s director of personnel and special_education services . &quot; We ' ve been thrown into the role of doing a lot of things that families normally would have taken_care of. &quot; Educators said that sometimes they must pay_attention to students ' emotional well-being before they can help children achieve academically . &quot; If you ' ve got kids who are for one reason or another emotionally hurting , it ' s going_to negatively affect their academic performance , &quot; Nargi said . &quot; When they ' re not preoccupied with other problems , they can occupy themselves with the task of learning. &quot; And Ventura High is doing more_than any other Ventura school to help students cope_with their personal problems , educators and county mental_health experts said . While the district gives all_of its schools some state and federal money for their student assistance programs , Ventura High is the only one that takes additional money from other school funds to pay_for a full-time program coordinator . District officials credit the coordinator , Cheryl Meyers , with the program ' s success at the high_school . In a survey last year , Ventura High officials found that children who had attended the various support groups had improved their school attendance by 76 % . Their grades had also gone_up , but only slightly , Meyers said . Meyers believes that grades did not show more improvement because each group meets for only eight weeks , too short a time to foster a dramatic improvement in students ' study habits . But school officials said they are thrilled that the support groups are encouraging students to come_to school more regularly . &quot; We ' ve been able to keep kids in school , &quot; Principal Jerry Barshay said . Some students who attend the groups said they look_forward to the sessions all week , knowing that they will have a chance to air their troubles in a safe place . In all_of the groups , students agree to keep everything discussed during the sessions strictly confidential . And most groups are single sex -- either all boys or all girls -- to help students feel more comfortable about divulging their problems with family members or with romantic relationships , Meyers said . Beth , who began attending the support group after her mother was hospitalized , said she gets more support from the group than she has ever received at_home . Beth is the student ' s middle name ; school officials withheld her first and last_names to protect her privacy . &quot; It makes me feel there ' s somebody there that ' s helping me through , &quot; she said . &quot; It helps me relax. &quot; Beth attends a group that focuses_on boosting students ' self-esteem . But many of the other groups deal with substance_abuse problems and include students caught drinking alcohol on campus who have chosen to attend the counseling sessions instead of being suspended . In addition to state and federal money , the student assistance programs at Ventura High and other Ventura schools depend_on volunteer help from local therapists and counselors to lead the groups . John Lieberman is community liaison for a local drug-treatment facility that pays_for him to spend one full day each week at Ventura High , running five groups on self-esteem , substance_abuse and for children of alcoholics . All of the various groups focus_on helping children talk honestly about their problems , he said . &quot; The major focus in our groups is the kids being able to be honest about whatever ' s going_on in their lives , &quot; Lieberman said . &quot; If we can give the kids an hour a week , it gives them a safe place where they can dump their guts and get_back into class and do the work they need to do. &quot;</TEXT>
