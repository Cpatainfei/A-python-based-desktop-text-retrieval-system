   <TEXT> * Gun violence has reached epidemic proportions in the United States . Physicians for Social Responsibility fully supports the reasonable measures to curb gun violence outlined in a recent series of Los Angeles Times editorials.We wish to clarify the perception of our work ( Dec . 3 ) . While the Cold_War has ended , and public perception of the threat has diminished , the actual threat from weapons of mass destruction remains and perhaps is growing , as_many recent articles in The Times on proliferation issues in_general and the North_Korean nuclear program in particular have pointed_out . We oppose the instruments of societal destruction in all their forms , whether it be the global threat from nuclear_weapons or the massive proliferation of guns in our streets . We invite all to join efforts to abolish the threat from handguns and assault weapons as well as_to eliminate nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons through the support of such measures as a comprehensive nuclear test ban and global ratification of the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
