   <HEADLINE> RON HARRIS : AS USUAL , IT ' S A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I like Bill Releford . He ' s a great guy . It ' s just that I get tired_of always talking_about feet . It ' s not that the subject is below me . But , while trying to not sound immodest , I like to think_of myself as a fella with a much broader range of conversational interests -- Clinton ' s health plan and Haitian politics , NASA and the NRA , batting_averages and bad movies , global warming and good sex , etc . So I ' m drawn to discussions that are , shall we say , a tad more eclectic than feet . Like the other night , I spent two hours with a bunch of friends discussing why timeouts in football are better than none in soccer , the influence of African art on world art and how Latin music , unlike American music , has a more cross-generational appeal . I know some of it is inane stuff . Still , I find it at least mildly thought-provoking . Now , Bill and I do touch_on a lot of subjects , such_as travel ( he just got_back from Tahiti ) and music ( I ' m trying to borrow his Dee Dee Bridgewater collection ) and investments ( he ' s buying beachfront property in Costa Rica ) . But almost invariably our conversations drift to the same subject -- feet , or feets , as my Uncle Bud used to say . * We were down at Fifth Street Dick ' s the other night and , again , Bill brought_up the subject . &quot; Man , you ' d be surprised at what some people will stuff into a pair of $ 500 alligator shoes , &quot; he said . Bill , Bill , I interrupted , what ' s up ? You got a foot fetish or something . &quot; No . that ' s what I do . I ' m a podiatric surgeon . I work with feet. &quot; I knew that Bill was a doctor , but I never concerned myself with what kind of doctor . Bill , I said , I understand that ' s your profession , but I ' ve got a friend who ' s a proctologist , and we don ' t end_up talking_about his work , if you know what I mean . &quot; Well , you ' d think it was a pretty important subject if you were lying_in the hospital and the doctor was getting ready to cut yours off. &quot; Uh , excuse me ? ! &quot; Yeah , that ' s right . If your name is Velma Hollie and you ' re diabetic and three months ago a bunch of doctors had told you they ' d probably have to amputate your foot and now not only do you still have it , but in a_few months you ' re going to be walking on it , it would be important. &quot; Hmmmm . My dad ' s an insulin-dependent diabetic . &quot; Or I bet if you are Daniel Skinner , diabetic , and you ' re still walking_around your flower shop down in Santa Monica after doctors had scheduled you for an amputation , you ' d think that feet were a pretty interesting subject. &quot; I was beginning to see why Bill was so serious about this question of people ' s feet . What drew him to this area is a long story . It certainly isn ' t one of the glamour medical specialties . Let ' s just say that while in West Africa as an undergraduate college_student , he realized that &quot; without the lower extremities , you have a big change in the quality of your life. &quot; So Bill became a podiatrist , moved_back to Los Angeles and set_up the Diabetic Foot Institute in Inglewood , tending to all kinds of foot ailments . And at least once a week , he explained , somebody walks into his office and says , &quot; Mom ( or Dad ) has been recommended for amputation . What can you do ? &quot; What Bill can do is fairly impressive . Through a special program at the Daniel Freeman Wound Care Treatment Center , Bill and five other doctors from different disciplines are saving feet and legs that other physicians around the city have given_up on . that ' s important , because most people don ' t survive the first five years after an amputation . And , at last count , my friend Bill had the highest healing rate of any of the doctors there . * The fact that Bill and the other doctors are saving limbs is of particular note in light of a recent study by two University of Texas researchers . After surveying 3.7 million California patients , they found that blacks have a higher risk of lower leg amputation and death resulting from diabetes than Latinos or whites . It ' s not news anymore when blacks are at the bottom of the health_care totem_pole , but the study is disturbing because while Latinos have a higher rate of diabetes , blacks are the ones having the most amputations . Exactly why , nobody is sure . Socioeconomic status , access to health_care and lifestyle all may contribute to the disparity . One thing is sure , amputation is preventable . It ' s just that a lot of people don ' t know that . that ' s why Bill was pushing a concert ticket toward me . It is for a salute to Ella Fitzgerald next Friday to raise money for the American Diabetes Assn. ' s African American Outreach program so they can tell people just that . There will be great music and wonderful food , Bill promised . I ' m sure there will also be somebody there talking_about feet . And this time , I ' d be glad to listen .</TEXT>
