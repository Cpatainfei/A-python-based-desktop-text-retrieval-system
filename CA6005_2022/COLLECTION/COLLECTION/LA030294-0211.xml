   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; PASSIONATE PORTRAYAL OF JUDEO-CHRISTIAN CONTROVERSY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lamb ' s Players Theatre has struck a blow for the theater of the mind with its riveting San Diego County premiere of &quot; Edith Stein , &quot; Arthur Giron ' s provoking and disturbing look_at the life of an enigmatic and controversial woman . Giron ' s tale was inspired by Edith Stein , a brilliant Jewish doctor_of_philosophy who converted to Roman_Catholicism at 30 , became a Carmelite nun ( with the name Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross ) at 41 and was killed at Auschwitz when she was 50 for having been born a Jew . The Pope beatified her in 1987 and , as recently as 1991 , her memory was at the center of an angry controversy . That erupted when a Carmelite convent erected in her honor at the Auschwitz death camp in Poland was closed under pressure from Jewish groups that were deeply offended that a convent should preside over the site where millions of Jews died agonizing deaths . And now , the play itself will undoubtedly polarize people on the question of religion , as did Stein herself . The sad part of that is Stein always saw herself as Jewish and Christian . All she ever really seemed to want was for everyone to get_along . What has troubled most critics -- particularly the New York critics in response to a production in January at the Jewish Repertory Theater -- is that Giron never explains why Stein converted . What is even more disturbing to this critic is why that should matter : Shouldn ' t everyone ' s religious choice -- as Stein herself suggested -- be an issue between the individual and God ? Still , although Giron does not favor us with answers , he does throw_out several tantalizing possibilities . In the Jewish holiday of Purim , which Stein celebrates early in the play , the tale is told of a Jewish woman named Esther who marries a king . The king , unaware that his beloved wife is Jewish , is persuaded by an evil man , Haman , to kill all_the Jews in his kingdom . Esther reveals herself , and the king saves the Jews . Could Stein have seen herself as an Esther married to Christ ( as nuns are ) , trying to win the favor of God , or at least that of the Pope , in sparing her people from the Holocaust ? She entreated Pope Pius XI in writing to issue an encyclical condemning Nazism . But he never did . Or was the church the avenue for continuing her work -- as she was banned from all professorial posts in Germany because she was Jewish ( she did much of her important work after her conversion ) . Or , given the restrictions of her Orthodox heritage -- a tradition in which women are gated away from the altar where the Torah is read -- was the church the only place she felt she could get close to God ? Or should one simply take her at her word : That she was inspired by reading the story of Saint Teresa of Avila , whose name she took ? Giron begins his story at the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz in 1987 , where the prioress ( Sandra Ellis-Troy ) meets with a Jewish Holocaust survivor ( Daniel Mann ) who is angry about the presence of the convent . She tells him the story of Stein . We flash_back , following Stein , played with stunning , luminous passion by Deborah Gilmour Smyth , from her girlhood to her relationship with her mother ( Ann Richardson , radiating dignity and fierce intelligence ) , from the colleagues and nuns who influenced her to the dialogue with a Nazi , Karl-Heinz , that leads to her painful self-discovery . * The real flaw in the story is the dialogue with the Nazi , which is totally Giron ' s creation . It ' s clever as a dramatic way to drive the second act to its deadly conclusion , but it ' s also a device that wears its gears on its sleeve . Karl-Heinz , played with chilling suggestiveness by Doug Reger , keeps telling us he ' s obsessed with marrying the purity that is Sister Teresa , but doesn ' t show us why he singles her out over the other nuns . Under the sensitive hand of director Robert Smyth , the theater ' s artistic director , all_the performances meld seamlessly , from Cynthia Peters ' as Edith ' s confused and troubled friend to Donal Pugh ' s as Franzy , the cool Nazi who recruits Karl-Heinz for the party -- fresh out of prison . But it is Deborah Gilmour Smyth ' s radiant presence that captures the complex , difficult nature of Stein . The music Gilmour Smyth composed and performed for the piece deepens the show ' s haunting mood . * Mike Buckley ' s spare lighting and bare , suggestive set -- metal trees , barbed wire overhead , a circle surrounded by splashes of red suggesting blood and fire -- serve this imaginative production well . Jeanne Reith ' s costumes move from period perfection to the dreamily suggestive as in the coarsely woven flesh-colored garments for the death camp . Giron , who was raised Catholic but has a Jewish heritage on his mother ' s side , seems to have been intensely involved in this particular story since an early version of &quot; Edith Stein &quot; was mounted at the Arena Stage in Washington in 1969 , 15 years before the convent was erected that inspired the current framework of the play . This work has the passion and heart to go the distance . If the playwright can solve his character problems , particularly in the exchange between Stein and the Nazi , it might also have legs . * &quot; Edith Stein , &quot; Lamb ' s Players Theatre , 500 Plaza Blvd. , National City .
