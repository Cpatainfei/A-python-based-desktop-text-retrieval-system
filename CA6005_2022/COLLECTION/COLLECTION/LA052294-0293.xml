   <HEADLINE> JENNY CRAIG TAKES A POUNDING ; LIFESTYLE : A 43 % DROP IN NEW CUSTOMERS FOR THE WEIGHT-LOSS CHAIN SIGNALS A SHIFTING ATTITUDE TOWARD DIETING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The surest way to measure losses at Jenny Craig Inc. ' s chain of diet centers is not with a scale but a calculator . The diet craze has cooled , and with it the fortunes of a company that grew fat selling Americans on thinness . Beginning in 1985 , founders Sid and Jenny Craig built the company into a weight-loss empire with more_than 650 centers nationwide . Sales grew tenfold , to $ 467 million in 1993 . Now Jenny Craig is itself on a diet . The Del Mar , Calif.-based company is closing more_than 30 centers to stem losses that came_to $ 8.7 million for the first three months of this year . The company reports that the number of new clients signing_up for the program during that time was down 43 % . The company ' s upper management has been in turmoil . Jenny Craig has lost two presidents , a chief financial_officer and a marketing vice_president since November . In a further sign of problems , the Craigs ' children are getting_out of the business . According to company documents filed last week , the four offspring and their spouses are selling unprofitable franchises in California , Florida and Texas back to the company . Asked if the losses are related to his decision to sell the 13 franchises he owns with Jenny Craig ' s daughter , Denise Altholz , son-in-law Walter Altholz said , &quot; What do you think ? &quot; Jenny Craig , it increasingly appears , is a company out of step with changed consumer attitudes toward fat -- and unsure what to do about it . Industry_analysts say consumers in the 1990s are more concerned about nutrition and health than their appearance , the focus of the Jenny Craig program . A nationwide recession and the economy ' s slow recovery are worsening the company ' s problems . Dieters trying to reduce expenses are avoiding the program , which carries weekly costs of $ 7 for counseling sessions and between $ 50 and $ 75 for Jenny ' s Cuisine , the prepackaged food accounting_for 90 % of the company ' s revenue . In a prepared statement , Chairman Sid Craig said the company ' s future lies_in shifting its emphasis from weight loss to &quot; lifestyle management &quot; -- a concept that stresses health as well as looks . Sid Craig didn ' t offer any specifics , and he and Jenny Craig , the firm ' s vice chairwoman , would not be interviewed for this story . ( &quot; They ' re not in the mood , &quot; said Ron Iori , a spokesman for the company. ) In a brief interview , the company ' s new president and chief_executive , C . Joseph LaBonte , talked_about the possibility of &quot; leveraging the Jenny Craig name , &quot; but did not say how he might do so . LaBonte allowed that Jenny Craig Inc. might seek a tie-in with a health insurer , a notion executives at the company have bandied_about for years . Jenny Craig ' s problems are not unique . Rival Nutri / System , which also sells prepackaged foods , has recently emerged from bankruptcy with fewer centers and under new ownership . Weight Watchers International , a unit of Heinz Inc. , said business is beginning to pick_up after falling 20 % during the last three months of last year . Overall , companies running commercial weight-loss centers are expected to show a 10 % revenue drop this year , according to Marketdata Enterprises , a research firm following the weight-loss industry . Americans still care about their weight . After all , &quot; In the Kitchen With Rosie , &quot; a book written by the chef who helped talk_show host Oprah Winfrey lose_weight , is a bestseller . But experts say consumers care more about maintaining a healthy weight than achieving svelteness . In various surveys , Americans in the ' 90s say they are eating more and exercising less than they did_in the 1980s . The percentage of overweight people on diets is shrinking . Among dieters , low-fat foods widely available in supermarket cases are gaining in popularity over prepackaged meals sold through structured programs such_as Jenny Craig , according to a 1993 survey by the Calorie Council , an industry group . New government food labeling rules will make_it easier for grocery shoppers to choose low-fat , low-calorie meals on_their_own . Jenny Craig ' s rivals have already taken steps to adjust to new consumer attitudes , though it is too soon to know whether the programs are working . Nutri / System , for example , has teamed_up with health_care giant Johnson &amp; Johnson to offer &quot; wellness &quot; programs that deal with overall health . It also sells a line of skin creams . Weight Watchers is billing itself as &quot; the health_care plan that works , &quot; and talks_about the health risks of obesity . Besides selling magazines , cookbooks and Weight Watchers brand food , the company is testing a telephone_service for do-it-yourself dieters who want menus and tips but don ' t want to attend weekly meetings . The centerpiece of Jenny Craig ' s latest marketing drive is a 30-minute infomercial that has been airing in Los Angeles and other big cities . Actor Dick Van Patten , a friend of the Craigs , lobs friendly questions at Jenny Craig and is appropriately stunned when six dieters describe how they lost_weight eating Jenny ' s Cuisine . One woman tells how happy her husband is with her new shape . In the infomercial , Jenny Craig does make several references_to lifestyle themes . &quot; It ' s not a diet , &quot; she says at one point . &quot; It ' s about changing behaviors in lifestyle. &quot; At another point , she lists diseases associated with obesity . But Jenny Craig Inc. continues in the main to market its standard program , which involves weekly individual weight counseling sessions and purchases of Jenny ' s Cuisine . The company advises clients to exercise , but it has no formal exercise program . Like its chief competitors , it performs no medical evaluations . About 90 % of its clients are women . Clients are encouraged to eat Jenny ' s Cuisine at every meal . The costs can be staggering . Clients on the plan for four months can pay as much as $ 1 # 312 for the program . That works_out to $ 82 a pound for people losing a pound a week , the average weight loss the company says clients can expect . For much of its history , the company has been_on a growth binge . The Craigs met in 1970 when Sid hired Jenny to manage a chain of fitness clubs . They married in 1979 , sold the fitness clubs to a subsidiary of Nutri / System and moved to Australia , where they started Jenny Craig Inc. They opened their first U.S. center in 1985 and went public in 1991 . The company has 650 centers in the United States and nearly 800 worldwide . As recently as a year ago , Jenny Craig announced plans to accelerate its expansion , opening 100 new centers in 1993 and 1994 . In aging baby_boomers , it saw a growing demand for weight-loss services . Those plans are now on hold amid signs that the market may have reached the saturation point . In the last two years , the company has acquired at least 87 centers from franchisees -- 72 of them from the Craigs ' children -- a sign that some independent operators are having difficulty . In documents made public last week , the company disclosed that it is buying back 31 franchises from four money-losing companies owned by the children . Taken together , the four companies lost $ 1.2 million in 1993 , though 19 of the individual centers made money . The children received no cash for the franchises , according to the documents . Instead , the company is assuming the franchises ' liabilities and canceling debt owed it . According to the sale agreements , Jenny Craig Inc. is canceling a total debt of $ 1.64 million . In a phone interview , Scott Craig said he and his sister , Susan Craig McKenna , are selling their 10 Florida franchises because there ' s no room left to grow in his Tampa , Fla. , franchise territory and he wants to try a new business outside the weight-loss field . &quot; If it was making a_million dollars , of course I ' d keep it , &quot; he said . Walter Altholz said from his office in Houston that he also plans to start a business unrelated to weight loss and that his wife wants to spend more time with their two children . Jenny Craig ' s daughter and son-in-law , Michelle and Duayne Weinger , are selling eight Northern California franchises . In 1992 , the Weingers sold 41 Northern California franchises to the company , receiving about $ 9 million for them , $ 6 million in the form of a canceled debt due the company and $ 2.7 million in assumed liabilities . They couldn ' t be reached . Michael Sitrick , a spokesman for Jenny Craig Inc. , said the company is buying back the children ' s franchises to avoid the appearance of conflict_of_interest , since the company is providing unspecified &quot; enhancements &quot; to its franchisees . The children have owned some of the franchises since at least 1989 . But in an interview five days before the buybacks became public , LaBonte , asked if the company had recently repurchased any franchises , said , &quot; We don ' t have a plan to buy back franchises. &quot; The company ' s rapid expansion is one point of contention in a 1992 shareholder lawsuit still pending in U.S. District Court in San Diego . The suit claims that at the time of its October , 1991 , public offering , the company knew the market for diet clinics had become saturated but went_ahead with expansion plans to boost revenue and create the illusion that Jenny Craig was a prosperous company . In public documents , the company has denied the allegations . Neither side in the dispute responded to requests for comment . The company faces other difficulties . Without admitting guilt , the company disclosed last week that it has agreed to pay $ 10 million and distribute to former clients discount coupons for Jenny ' s Cuisine to settle a class action lawsuit in Orange County Superior_Court claiming the diet lead to gall bladder disease . The company ' s insurance carrier is covering only $ 6 million of the settlement . An administrative complaint from the Federal Trade Commission alleging false advertising is pending against the company . The FTC contends that Jenny Craig ads misled consumers into believing it is easy to keep the weight off . In public documents , the company contends that it warns consumers that individual results may vary . Weight Watchers is fighting a similar FTC action . Nutri / System has settled with the agency , agreeing to modify its advertising . The FTC allegations raise consumer doubts about the success of the program and others like it , according to analysts . Consumer Reports fueled those doubts last June , when it surveyed participants of leading weight-loss programs and declared it found no evidence that the programs worked in the long_run . The magazine said that former Jenny Craig clients surveyed said they had regained half the weight in six months . Despite its problems , Jenny Craig Inc. isn ' t on the ropes . Though its difficulties have dwindled its cash to $ 14.5 million in March from $ 26.1 million nine months ago , it remains debt free . The company has continued paying its regular dividend , which totaled $ 16.3 million last year . More_than half went_to an entity controlled by the Craigs . The couple control 60 % of Jenny Craig stock , and each earned a salary of $ 500 # 000 in 1993 . The company is apparently attractive to Bally Manufacturing Corp . Chief_Executive Arthur Goldberg , who purchased 1.3 % of Jenny Craig shares last month . The purchase briefly fueled speculation that Bally ' s , the nation ' s largest fitness chain operator , might buy the company . But LaBonte said there have been no discussions of any transaction or partnership with Bally ' s and that Goldberg made the purchase as an investment . There are no indications the Craigs intend to sell , although Seidler Cos . analyst Ron Rotter said an alliance between Bally and Jenny Craig would make_sense . Where the company ' s problems have had an impact is in the executive suite . Last December , Ronald E . Gerevas quit as president with a year left on his $ 375 # 000-a-year contract , saying he was frustrated that Sid Craig would n ' t give him a free hand to make changes . Gerevas said that when he joined the company in 1991 , he had assumed the Craigs would spend more time on leisure activities , including raising their prize-winning thoroughbred racehorses . &quot; Sid decided , with all_the toys he had to play with , to come_back to the company , &quot; said Gerevas , who is now vice_chairman of the U.S. board of SpencerStuartInternational Search Consultants , based in Los Angeles . He said he nonetheless has high regard for the Craigs . Sid Craig replaced Gerevas with his former rival , ex-Nutri / System President Albert DiMarco . DiMarco left abruptly in March for what the company has described as personal reasons . He is running a chain of Italian restaurants in New Jersey . He did not respond to requests for comment . LaBonte , a Palos Verdes Estates investor , is no stranger to entrepreneurial bosses . He resigned as chief operating officer of 20th Century Fox in 1982 , shortly after its then-owner , billionaire Marvin Davis , sold the resorts and bottling company LaBonte ran . In 1987 , LaBonte joined Reebok as president and chief operating officer , No . 2 to co-founder Paul Fireman . Charged with disciplining the shoe company ' s freewheeling management style , LaBonte quit three years later amid complaints that his organization_charts had taken the fun out of Reebok . The management structure LaBonte imposed on Reebok has been dismantled , and two companies acquired on his watch have been sold as money-losers . LaBonte said his contract with Jenny Craig Inc. gives him specific duties and he is satisfied . &quot; It is a partnership here , &quot; he said . In his statement , Sid Craig said he chose LaBonte as president and chief_executive in part because of his corporate experience , especially at Reebok , where , as at Jenny Craig Inc. , most customers are women . &quot; Joe felt Jenny Craig has the opportunity to transition its core business from weight loss to lifestyle management , &quot; the statement said . LaBonte said he envisions a &quot; focused lifelong program &quot; that moves successful dieters into a maintenance program . The program isn ' t yet in place , though the company does sell what it calls lifestyle audiotapes as part of a $ 219 weight-loss package that also includes weight-maintenance counseling . LaBonte interprets polls indicating that more Americans are overweight as a sign that potential demand for weight-loss programs is increasing . A 1993 Louis Harris &amp; Associates poll found that 66 % of Americans are overweight , up from 61 % in 1991 . The same poll also showed that 33 % of Americans exercise strenuously , a four-point drop from 1991 and a six-point drop_in the percentage of Americans avoiding fat and cholesterol . America is getting heavier . Said Seidler Cos . analyst Rotter : &quot; All Jenny Craig needs to get humming is a change in the thinking among people about losing weight. &quot; Feast and Famine The performance of Del Mar , Calif.-based Jenny Craig Inc. has sagged amid a dip in Americans ' enthusiasm for dieting . Profit has Turned_to Loss ( Quarterly net_income , in millions of dollars ) . . . : $ 8.7-million loss ( 1994 ) . . . As Sales Have Shrunk ( Quarterly revenue , in millions of dollars ) . . . : $ 96.0 ( 1994 ) . . . And the Stock Has Slid ( Weekly closes , except latest ) : 1993 : $ 16.25 May 1994 : $ 6.75 Note : Fiscal_year runs July 1 - June 30 Source : Bloomberg Business News</TEXT>
