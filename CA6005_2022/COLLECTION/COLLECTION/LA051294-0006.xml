   <HEADLINE> LOBBYING : CLEANING IT UP ; RIGHTLY , CONGRESS MOVES TO RESTRICT GIFTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The process by which the Congress of the United States makes the laws of the country is one in which there are properly many participants other_than the legislators themselves . Legislators are , after all , representatives , and the public has a right to make its views known not just individually but also collectively . The name for all this is , hang_on , lobbying . How does_it happen that so legitimate an activity comes_to seem so illegitimate ? This happens when private interests do more_than just make their views known to the custodians of public welfare but attempt , by spending_money on them , to turn them into custodians of private welfare . Lobbying in this form accounts_for the finding , by a 1992 New York Times / CBS News poll , that 75 % of Americans believe that government serves a_few big private interests rather than the people as_a_whole . There are broadly two ways to regulate the excesses of lobbying : One is to reform the recipients , the legislators ; the other is to reform the donors , the private interests out_to shape public policy . The first way consists mainly of measures , codes of ethics and the_like , that seek to improve the righteousness of legislators . Such codes have proliferated in recent years , and the result ? Well , the most common result has been a polishing of speeches by legislators who insist that though they have accepted favors , they have never allowed them to affect their thinking . But the move to &quot; reform &quot; the legislators has taken_on new strength , thanks to bills passed , against considerable odds , by the House and on Wednesday by the Senate . The Senate action , the strictest gift-reform measure ever passed_by either house of Congress , bans virtually all gifts , meals , travel and entertainment paid_for by lobbyists , special-interest groups and even ordinary constituents . The Senate bill must be reconciled by a joint Senate-House conference with the less restrictive House version . Sometimes only a fine line separates legitimate participation in representative government , with related expenses that are legitimate business_expenses , on the one hand , and illegitimate attempts to exert undue influence on lawmakers on the other . Policing that line will take some doing . Attempts to fudge the difference will be many . Along the way , some legitimate activities may be tarred as illegitimate . But give the U.S. Congress credit for recognizing that it had to clean_up its act or begin losing the capacity to govern at all . The right_to_vote may create representative government . But what makes the vote work is the public_trust that , once elected , the representatives will actually represent the people . These bills give the public_trust at least a fighting chance .</TEXT>
