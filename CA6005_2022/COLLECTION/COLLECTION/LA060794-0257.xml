   <HEADLINE> PACIFIC RIM TRADE ; AMERICA ; U.S. MARKET ' S SIZE LURES INNOVATORS ; CUSTOMER BASES CAN BE HUGE HERE . BUT BECAUSE OF THAT VERY POTENTIAL , THE STRUGGLE TO SELL IS A NEVER-ENDING BATTLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Michael Mun , president of the Singapore-based computer-peripherals manufacturer Aztech Systems Pte . Ltd. , expanding into the U.S. market has been a dream come true . &quot; No matter how you look_at it , the U.S.A. is the single largest consumer market in the world , &quot; Mun said . &quot; And the U.S. market easily accepts new technology , new products . I think the use of computers there is more widespread than in any other country. &quot; A maker of items such_as computer soundboards and CD-ROM_drives , Aztech entered the American market in mid-1992 , making about $ 10 million in U.S. sales out of $ 50 million in worldwide sales that year , Mun said . Last year , out of $ 92 million in global sales , nearly $ 50 million worth was made in the United States . The allure of selling to America shines throughout the Pacific Rim countries , inspiring determined efforts not only from major corporations but also by the thousands of small and medium-sized entrepreneurial firms that help give this region its dynamism . * &quot; There is a lot of potential for us in the U.S. market , &quot; said Stephen Leung , director of Star Industrial , a Hong Kong plastics-ware manufacturer . &quot; Although it ' s a very competitive market , it ' s still a lot clearer and more accessible than most parts of the world. &quot; The total size of the European Union ' s market exceeds that of the United States , but Europe &quot; has different standards and living conditions and language and so on , &quot; agreed Mitsuo Takii , director of the Americas Division in the research department of the Japan External Trade Organization . He continued : &quot; The United States is a very important market for Japanese companies because it is the largest common_market in the world with the same language , the same way_of_life , the same standards. &quot; But while the American market may be big , important and open , that doesn ' t mean it ' s easy . The very openness of America means the competitive struggle to sell is a never-ending battle . Star Industrial ' s Red A brand of plastic kitchenware is firmly entrenched in Hong Kong and has a strong presence in other Asian markets . But as Leung has pushed to expand in the United States -- often making products for_sale under American brand names -- he ' s encountered plenty of frustration . &quot; We develop relations with customers and manufacturers in which the first year is always a year of trial_and_error , &quot; Leung explained . &quot; We figure_out all_the errors and iron_out all_the bugs in the first year , so we really don ' t make any money the first year . If the product_line is a success , we probably will break_even by the second year and make a profit in the third year. &quot; * that ' s when trouble begins again . &quot; Most likely after three years , &quot; he said , &quot; some U.S. customers would probably throw_in the question someplace , ' You supply this item for me for $ 1 , but someone else can supply it for 95 cents. ' So frustrations like this always come up. &quot; For Aztech , a major problem was that American customers sometimes got so frustrated trying to install computer_peripherals that they gave_up and returned them . Much of Aztech ' s equipment is sold to manufacturers , but items such_as soundboards , which provide computers with voice or audio capacity , are also sold directly to the public for do-it-yourself installation . &quot; You must be very consumer-oriented &quot; in the United States , Mun said . &quot; It must be easy to install and easy to understand . In the early days , we tried to explain it in a very lengthy format , and we created a lot of confusion . Most users don ' t read the manuals in much detail . If you put_in a lot of computer jargon , it will be returned. &quot; So Aztech made a determined effort at creating simplified instructions . &quot; Now we have a lot of graphics , and we try to limit the instructions to one page , &quot; he said . &quot; We learned from our mistakes . . . . As a company from the Far East , we had a lot to learn about American culture , American philosophy and thinking , and how business is conducted. &quot; In another field , toys , Japanese manufacturer Takara Co . Ltd . finds American consumers rather easy to please . But there are other problems . For instance , the high value of the yen in recent years -- which drives_up the cost of Japanese goods in dollar terms -- has made_it virtually impossible for Japanese-made toys to be sold in the competitive U.S. market , according to Tamio Watabiki , head of the firm ' s international division . So Takara makes toys for the Japanese market in Japan , but toys for the U.S. market are made according to its specifications in China , Indonesia and Macao , then sold through American toy companies under their brand names . &quot; Japanese consumers are very much ultra-strict on the quality of toys , &quot; Watabiki said . &quot; They care too_much about small things , while American consumers are very generous. &quot; On cosmetic matters such_as traces of excess plastic left from the molding process , toys bound for the United States don ' t require the same level of quality demanded of toys in Japan . Packaging can be simpler too . * &quot; Japanese consumers like deluxe boxes , &quot; the Takara executive explained . But in the United States , where 70 % of all toys are sold at discount_stores or supermarkets , it is perfectly acceptable to use &quot; blister packaging , &quot; with the toy placed on cardboard and covered with plastic wrapping . Partly as a result of such differences , toys cost half as much in the United States as in Japan , Watabiki said . What Takara cares about most in the U.S. market is having balanced , cooperative relationships with American toy manufacturers such_as Hasbro Inc. , Mattel Inc. and Tyco Toys Inc. , he said . &quot; These ties enable Takara to bring U.S. toy concepts to Japan . that ' s our corporate strategy . We do not want to be a competitor with U.S. toy companies . We would rather be a partner. &quot; As an illustration of the business , Watabiki pointed to the way toy concepts based on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have bounced around the Pacific Rim . The Ninja Turtles were conceived by two American artists who founded Mirage Studios , and popularized mainly by the U.S. operations of Hong Kong-based Playmates Toys . Watabiki arranged rights in Japan for Takara , which proceeded to develop its own versions of Ninja Turtle toys . Now Takara has sold some of its Ninja Turtle concept modifications back to Playmates for use in toys sold in the U.S. market . Takara ' s emphasis on its home market is reflected in its sales figures . Out of total global sales of $ 430 million for its 1993 fiscal_year , $ 385 million was in Japan and about $ 20 million in the United States . But U.S. operations are still &quot; very important , &quot; Watabiki said , largely because of this two-way concept flow . &quot; We are much dependent_on a company like Hasbro , &quot; he said , noting that Takara has marketed Hasbro ' s &quot; Game of Life &quot; board_game in Japan for 26 years . &quot; The U.S. is very rich_in worldwide popular characters , &quot; he added . &quot; They have Ninja Turtles , they have GI Joes , they have many things. &quot; * The niches that exporters from different Asian_countries find in the U.S. market tend to change as industrialization spreads through the Pacific Rim . In the late 1950s , South_Korea ' s textile industry employed one-fifth of the country ' s labor_force , and clothing exports to the United States provided most of its foreign_exchange . By 1987 , textile exports surpassed $ 10 billion , making South_Korea the third-largest textile exporter in the world . Since then , strict textile quotas in the United States and other overseas markets , together with the emergence of other South_Korean export industries such_as petrochemicals , electronics and heavy industrial goods , have led to a sharp drop-off in the importance of the textile trade . More_than half the country ' s textile exporters have either switched to other items or gone_out of business . One of the survivors is Choi Young Ae , 40 , who founded Y . A . International in 1981 after working for nine years at a large trading company . Choi prospered by positioning her firm to deliver higher-quality products than those produced by emerging textile powers , such_as China , while keeping prices below what Japanese manufacturers charge . Her determination to hang_on was buttressed by a 1987 trip to survey the U.S. market , she said . &quot; I found there was an unlimited market there . I saw Americans change their clothes very often . They dress differently for work , for parties and for recreation. &quot; Choi persuaded managers at the factories that supplied her goods to upgrade their products with complex patterns and higher-quality materials . She also established stable links with U.S. importers such_as M . M . Fab Inc. and Morex Enterprises . A key to success in the United States is creativity , she said . &quot; Quality product is not the only thing needed , &quot; she said . &quot; You need to pay close attention to market trends , the fashion_industry , and you must satisfy clients ' needs with good service . Most important is that in this business , you must be prepared to work really hard . Nine-to-five does not apply. &quot; * Times special correspondent Christine Courtney in Hong Kong and Times researcher Chi Jung Nam in Seoul contributed to this article .</TEXT>
