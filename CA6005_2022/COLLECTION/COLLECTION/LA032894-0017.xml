   <HEADLINE> ' WHO ' S PULLING THE RUG FROM UNDER OUR FEET ? ' ; MEXICO : IN A COUNTRY STALKED BY ACCELERATING VIOLENCE , COLOSIO ' S DEATH IS SYMBOLIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From the day of his destape , his designation last Nov . 28 as the governing party ' s candidate , his campaign was dogged by misfortune . After Jan . 1 , the shadow of Chiapas stalked him , and his public appearances were relegated to the inside pages of the papers . Wherever Luis Donaldo Colosio went , the name of Manuel Camacho Solis , one of his principal rivals in the party , followed him , and he was harried by rumors that he would be replaced or could lose next August ' s election . The uprising of the Zapatista National Liberation Army dealt him a fatal blow ; it altered the familiar face of his constituency , crippled his campaign . Colosio tried to confront these times of uncertainty with optimism . Branded as President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s man , he wanted to be his own man and demonstrate his independence in his speeches . Destiny lay_in_wait for him on Wednesday at the hands of an assassin lurking among a crowd in the working-class Tijuana suburb of Lomas Taurinas , in Baja California Norte , at another border troubled by political unrest , social insecurity and migratory pressures . But this border does not face Central_America and underdevelopment , as in Chiapas ; it faces the most powerful country on Earth , a juxtaposition that serves as yet another reminder of their poverty to its inhabitants . One could say that the borders killed Colosio . The southern border dealt the political blow , the northern border fired the shots . And worst of all , no one knows for certain what is happening in Mexico , who ' s pulling the rug from under our feet , who ' s behind the accelerating violence . Our present reality is being reconfigured , the course of our history changed , although we don ' t know in which direction . A year of political , social and economic turbulence most probably lies ahead . We hope it will be only a year , and then we will return to stability and the road to democracy . Acts such_as the assassination of Colosio do not lead to democracy but to political barbarism . The pistolero who fired at the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party fired at all Mexicans , for we will all suffer from his act . No Mexican in_his_right_mind can or should condone violence as a form of political expression . Although we still do not know the motives of the gunman who committed this crime and whether he acted alone or as the instrument of a conspiracy , there is one thing we do know : Colosio is the first significant political victim of the climate of violence that Mexico has been experiencing since New Year ' s Day . Perhaps a crime of this magnitude would not have been possible before the events in Chiapas . It has irretrievably transformed the atmosphere of the August elections . Nearly 500 kidnapings took_place in Mexico during the past year -- and the murder of a cardinal last May in Guadalajara as well as a slew of armed_robberies on our roads and in our cities . An increasing tide of violence , in which the hand of the police is often discernible , is invading our daily life . The crowds gathered_in Mexico_City to bid farewell to Colosio ' s body were clamoring for justice . If Mexico manages to emerge unscathed , it will be as a stronger and more democratic country , worthy of its history and culture and ready to enter the 21st Century under its next president , chosen in what must be , finally , a clean election . Colosio ran_for Tlatoani , supreme ruler of the Mexican political_system ; without becoming emperor , he suffered the fate of Julius Caesar and succumbed to his own Ides of March .</TEXT>
