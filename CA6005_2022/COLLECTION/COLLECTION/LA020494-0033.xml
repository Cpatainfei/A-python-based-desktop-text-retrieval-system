   <HEADLINE> HOME TECH / VIDEO : REMEMBER WHEN FIGURE_SKATING WAS ROMANTIC . . . ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thanks to Tonya Harding -- or at least to the people around her -- the image of figure_skating has been taking a beating . If you yearn to return to those thrilling days of yesteryear , when figure skaters were wholesome and angelic , try a Sonja Henie movie . &quot; Who ' s Sonja Henie ? &quot; many will ask . She ' s the Norwegian Olympic-champion figure skater -- a medal_winner in the Olympics from 1928 to 1936 -- who was an American movie_star in the late ' 30s and ' 40s . To take_advantage of the current focus_on skaters , FoxVideo is releasing seven of her movies on home video Feb . 16 , at $ 20 each . Henie was to figure_skating what Esther Williams was to swimming . Tuneful romantic comedies were tailored for her , centering around her skating talents , of course . The showpieces of these movies are spectacular ice ballets -- which put to shame anything you ' ll ever see in the Ice Capades . In her prime , Henie was a perky , girl-next-door kind of blonde . She wasn ' t much of an actress , but she didn ' t have to be . Those fairy-tale plots didn ' t require much acting skill . Most of the time all she had to do was look radiant . She invariably worked with actors and performers noted for their strong personalities -- like Tyrone Power , Ray Milland , Caesar Romero and Don Ameche . These movies never pretend to be anything but pure escapism and are generally very charming . The movies are &quot; Thin Ice &quot; ( 1937 ) , with Tyrone Power ; &quot; One in a_Million &quot; ( 1937 ) , with Adolphe Menjou ; &quot; My Lucky Star &quot; ( 1938 ) , with Richard Greene ; &quot; Happy Landing &quot; ( 1938 ) , with Don Ameche ; &quot; Everything Happens at Night &quot; ( 1939 ) , featuring Robert Cummings ; &quot; Iceland &quot; ( 1942 ) , co-starring John Payne , and &quot; Wintertime &quot; ( 1943 ) , with Caesar Romero and Cornel Wilde . The best Henie films were the early ones . Her fabled snow-queen charm was at its freshest in those days and the scripts and direction were much better . By the mid- ' 40s , the Henie vehicles had started to creak . &quot; Thin Ice , &quot; a Cinderella tale featuring Power as a prince , may be the most engaging of this group of releases and perhaps her best film . Henie clearly had a special chemistry with Power -- probably because he was also her off-screen beau . Her first film , &quot; One in a_Million , &quot; is also a charmer . If you ' re into ice ballets , see &quot; My Lucky Star , &quot; which ends with the eye-popping &quot; Alice in Wonderland &quot; production number . Even if you hate the romantic parts , fast-forward to the end and feast your eyes on that ballet . Add Winter_Olympics : With the Winter_Olympics just around the corner , retailers will be showcasing Olympics-related tapes -- which means Paramount ' s &quot; Downhill Racer &quot; will be_on prominent display once again . If you ' ve never seen this 1969 drama , you ' re in_for a treat . Robert Redford , in one of the best performances of his career , plays a champion skier who ' s an egomaniac . The many pluses include the spine-tingling ski sequences and Gene Hackman ' s stunning performance as a tough ski coach . It ' s among the best films ever made about a sports figure , up there with the 1963 Richard Harris drama , &quot; This Sporting Life. &quot; What ' s New on Video &quot; Poetic Justice &quot; ( Columbia TriStar , no set price ) . When director John Singleton ' s follow-up to &quot; Boyz N ' the Hood &quot; came_out , it was nicknamed &quot; Bored in the Hood. &quot; In this meandering , cliched road movie , a hairdresser / poet ( Janet Jackson ) heads to Oakland from L.A. with a mailman ( Tupac Shakur ) and two other friends . The tired old plot is not invigorated by its hip , young , black cast . &quot; Kalifornia &quot; ( PolyGram , no set price ) . Another road movie , about two couples heading West . This motley crew includes a crazed killer ( Brad Pitt ) , his juvenile girlfriend ( Juliette Lewis ) , an academic ( Brad Duchovny ) writing_about serial_killers and his lover ( Michelle Forbes ) . Implausibilities abound and the cast , particularly Pitt , often wildly overacts . &quot; Un Coeur En Hiver &quot; ( Republic , no set price ) . Enthralling , cerebral French drama ( with subtitles ) that pulls you into the Angst of a violin craftsman ( Daniel Auteuil ) who ' s an emotional cripple . He ' s trapped in a triangle with a violinist ( Emanuelle Beart ) and his business partner ( Andre Dussollier ) . If you like moody foreign-language dramas , don ' t miss this one . Upcoming Just announced : Columbia TriStar ' s &quot; The Age of Innocence , &quot; with Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer , comes_out April 6 . Also : &quot; In the Line_of_Fire , &quot; &quot; The Meteor Man , &quot; &quot; Amongst Friends , &quot; &quot; The Real McCoy , &quot; &quot; Indochine &quot; and &quot; That Night &quot; ( Wednesday ) ; &quot; The Secret Garden &quot; ( Feb . 15 ) ; &quot; Man Without a Face , &quot; &quot; The Program , &quot; &quot; Benefit of the Doubt &quot; and &quot; Calendar Girl &quot; ( Feb . 16 ) ; &quot; For Love or Money , &quot; &quot; Son of the Pink Panther , &quot; &quot; Dazed and Confused , &quot; &quot; Son-in-Law , &quot; &quot; Needful Things , &quot; &quot; Strictly Ballroom &quot; and &quot; Boxing Helena &quot; ( Feb . 23 ) ; &quot; Much Ado About Nothing , &quot; &quot; The Good Son &quot; and &quot; Striking Distance &quot; ( March 2 ) ; &quot; The Fox and the Hound &quot; ( March 4 ) ; &quot; Manhattan Murder Mystery , &quot; &quot; Judgment Night , &quot; &quot; King of the_Hill &quot; and &quot; So I Married an Axe Murderer &quot; ( March 9 ) ; &quot; Gettysburg &quot; and &quot; Bopha ! &quot; ( March 16 ) ; &quot; The Fugitive &quot; ( March 22 ) ; &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do With It &quot; ( March 23 ) and &quot; Fatal Instinct &quot; ( March 23 ) ; &quot; The Joy Luck Club &quot; ( March 30 ) ; &quot; A Bronx Tale &quot; ( April 6 ) ; &quot; Malice &quot; ( April 13 ) .</TEXT>
