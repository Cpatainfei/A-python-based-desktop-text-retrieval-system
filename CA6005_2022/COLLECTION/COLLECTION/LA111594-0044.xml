   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; TAIWANESE WORRIED OVER HONG KONG ; CHINA ' S HEAVY-HANDED TREATMENT OF THE BRITISH COLONY IS SEEN AS A WARNING AGAINST DREAMS OF UNITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No one is watching this territory ' s reversion to Chinese rule more closely than Taiwan -- the 1997 Hong Kong transition , after all , is supposed to be the model for Taiwan ' s own eventual return to the Chinese fold . And what Taipei ' s representatives here see gives them the jitters . Far from tempting Taiwan home by gentle handling of British-ruled Hong Kong , Beijing is growing increasingly heavy-handed as the July 1 , 1997 , transfer of power nears , disrupting the delicate balance of the triangle of Chinese interests . Just ask the people of Rennie ' s Mill , an enclave of pro-Taiwan sentiment in Hong Kong ' s rural New Territories . Here , where the white starburst of the Taiwan flag flutters above the settlement ' s jumbled stone buildings , residents say they see no reason for confidence in rule by China . They are being forced_out by redevelopment but also because Beijing does not want to inherit a camp full of Taiwanese supporters in 1997 . Chinese officials have warned the residents to cool their ardent stance before the transition . &quot; There will be no difference between being based in mainland_China and Hong Kong after 1997 , &quot; says Paul Lau , who was born in Rennie ' s Mill and grew_up there . &quot; Beijing promises ' one country , two systems , ' but the two systems for us will be believe it or leave. &quot; That Communist leitmotif , &quot; one country , two systems , &quot; which pledges 50 years of autonomy for Hong Kong after the hand-over , sounds increasingly hollow to Taiwanese interests . Examples of China ' s economic interference alarm Taiwanese here the most . Beijing recently obstructed Hong Kong ' s renewal of commercial air service agreements between the territory and Taiwan , and in June , blocked an agreement that would allow Taiwanese investors into Hong Kong ' s futures market . But the real signal that the party will soon be over in Hong Kong came this fall when China tried to stop a celebration of Taiwanese Founding Day organized by the Kuomintang , Taiwan ' s ruling Nationalist Party . Beijing immediately protested that Hong Kong was encouraging the creation of &quot; two Chinas. &quot; The Hong Kong government refused to withdraw its permission , but celebrations throughout the colony had a wistful tone . &quot; This may be the last year we can do this , &quot; said a party-goer at a National Day banquet in the Hong Kong Hilton , as Taiwanese politicians and starlets linked arms and belted_out nationalistic tunes . An event planned for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Kuomintang itself in November was quietly canceled . &quot; It ' s not even 1997 yet , &quot; said Suzie Chiang , a top Taiwanese representative in Hong Kong . &quot; It ' s a little bit early. &quot; Hong Kong has acted_as a neutral middle ground between the two Chinese governments since 1949 , when the Communist_Party won a bitter civil_war and the Nationalist Party set_up a rival administration in Taiwan . Although links between Taiwan and the mainland are still strained , billions of dollars in goods are transshipped through Hong Kong . The territory also is a transit point for traders and tourists . But when the_British territory returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 , Taiwanese organizations here fear that they will be_on unwelcome ground . Until now , Taiwanese organizations have operated discreetly but freely . Because Britain recognizes China , not Taiwan , Taiwanese organizations maintain a shadowy profile : the de_facto Taiwanese embassy goes_by the name Chung Hwa Travel Service ; Taiwan ' s economic office here is known as Far East Trading Co . Suzie Chiang ' s government information office just changed its name from the provocative Free China Review to the Kwang Hwa Culture and Information Center . &quot; It ' s schizophrenic , it ' s crazy , but it ' s something we have to do , &quot; a Kwang Hwa staff_member said . Like half of a bitterly divorced couple , China will not show_up anywhere Taiwan is invited and constantly tests the loyalties of friends who try to maintain polite relations with both . The conflict makes international meetings , from economic summits to Asian sporting events , awkward . Although Taiwan is the world ' s 14th-largest trading nation and a full-fledged member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group , it cannot send its president to APEC summits . Beijing recently argued against Taipei ' s bid to re-enter the United Nations , and threatened to pull_out of October ' s Asian Games in Hiroshima , Japan , if Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui showed_up . The Asian Olympic Committee rescinded its invitation to Lee , though a Taiwanese deputy premier went , and China stayed in the competition . &quot; I think it ' s absolute nonsense , &quot; said Wu Chieh-ming of Taiwan ' s Far East Trade Service . &quot; They welcome our investment in mainland_China , &quot; he said -- up_to $ 15 billion worth , most of it funneled through Hong Kong . So Beijing should not disturb those who help get_it there , Wu argued . &quot; It ' s difficult to promote trade and investment if people are scared , &quot; he said . Unlike his Foreign Ministry ( or Chung Hwa Travel Service ) counterpart , Wu may be able to stay after 1997 . Money is supposed to be OK , politics are not . John Ni , head of the travel service and Taiwan ' s de_facto ambassador here , said he has a long-term lease on his posh office space in central Hong Kong , where he issues visas that China does not recognize to a country that China will not admit exists . Beijing says that if he continues stamping passports , the travel agency-embassy must close . &quot; We didn ' t ask too_much , &quot; said Ni , sinking into a black leather sofa , &quot; just that we should be treated as an individual entity and given reasonable room for international activity. &quot; Taiwan ' s one card is economic power , but it ' s an ace . The political rifts are in some ways being quietly bridged by a steady flow of investment to the mainland . About 1.5 million Taiwanese visitors went_to China through Hong Kong last year . According to a recent report by the World_Bank , the combined total economic output of mainland_China , Taiwan and Hong Kong is the world ' s second-largest -- behind the United States -- and represents a $ 3.2-trillion economy . The clout of a fully united Greater China -- which would add Taiwanese investment and Hong Kong ' s services to China ' s already huge economy -- is one element driving Beijing ' s push for reunification . Since the Nationalists fled the mainland after losing the civil_war in 1949 , Beijing has been anxious to reclaim what it considers a renegade province and pretender to the throne . Hong Kong ' s 1997 reversion represents the first_step toward bringing Taiwan back to the motherland . Taiwan , though wary , has not ruled_out the possibility . But continued bickering could propel the potential triumvirate farther apart . &quot; Some people say the next century belongs_to the Chinese , &quot; said Shaw Yu-ming , cultural director of the pro-China United Daily News Group in Taipei . &quot; Whether the Chinese end_up as a leader in the 21st Century , however , will depend in large part on the status of relations across the Taiwan Strait. &quot; Even with a common language and culture , Taiwanese companies admit that it is not so easy doing business on the mainland . Almost half of Taiwanese investments on the mainland lost money last year , according to the China Daily newspaper , though some may report large losses to avoid taxes . &quot; We are Chinese , we know what ' s happening in China , &quot; said Tracy Hui , the financial manager of the Taiwanese shipping_company Bimerco Air Forwarders . &quot; But still we face quite a lot of problems -- not necessarily related to Taiwan , but things modern societies cannot accept . People ask_for money ( bribes ) all_the time. &quot; &quot; Doing business in China can be very dangerous , &quot; Ni said . Newspapers frequently report kidnapings and corruption , and Ni described a Taiwanese businessman who was beaten with a steel bar by the military_police in China ' s industrial zone of Shenzhen . &quot; All these things are frightening , &quot; Ni said . &quot; It is more ( because China is like the ) Wild_West than because of political reasons , but since there are so many Taiwanese businessmen , the chances are higher they will be hit. &quot; In the meantime , Taiwan would like to hold its money card as close to the vest as possible . While China ' s low-cost labor and common culture is appealing for business , Taiwan ' s government is encouraging investors to spread their money around other parts of Asia , especially prosperous Southeast_Asia , to avoid over-dependence on China . &quot; The more money going_to China from Taiwan , the less bargaining power for the Taiwanese government , &quot; said a Taiwanese banker in Hong Kong . &quot; Those who are heavily invested tend to be pro-China. &quot; The &quot; go South &quot; policy has had some success . Taiwan is one of the top investors in Vietnam , and is building_up Subic Bay -- the old U.S. Navy_base in the Philippines -- as an alternative transshipment_center to Hong Kong . That would hurt Hong Kong as Taiwan ' s entrepot , but would boost Taiwan ' s leverage . &quot; If Hong Kong is harmed , Taiwan will go independent , &quot; predicted a Taiwanese investment_banker who channels compatriots ' funds through the territory . &quot; And no one in Beijing wants to be responsible_for losing Taiwan. &quot; Powerful Potential China is already a huge economy , but &quot; Greater China &quot; would benefit from Taiwanese investment and Hong Kong ' s services .
