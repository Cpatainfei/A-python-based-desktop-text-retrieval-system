   <HEADLINE> WINE COUNTRY COOKING ; IS THIS A GREAT JOB , OR WHAT ? ; SWEET DEALS : THREE RESTAURANT CHEFS TRADED THE RAT_RACE FOR SLOWER-PACED JOBS AS STAFF CHEFS AT CALIFORNIA WINERIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fame that goes_with being a world-class chef has appeal only while the klieg_lights are_on . Once back in the depths of the kitchen , many chefs burn_out on the details . Three California chefs have left the glitzy restaurant lifestyle for the calmer , more creative world of the winery kitchen , where the fame may be far less but where the personal rewards appear to be much more tangible . Winery owners hire chefs because they know that table_wines show best with fine food . But the high cost of maintaining an on-staff chef has , in the last six years , eliminated all but a tiny handful of such positions . Six years ago , California boasted more_than two_dozen on-staff winery chefs . Of the few who remain , three are former restaurant chefs who gave_up what they saw as a rat_race . John Ash , Jerry Comfort and Mark Malicki all still feel cooking is exciting and rewarding , but prefer to do_it in small , private kitchens . &quot; The initial appeal of the restaurant is the excitement , the adrenaline rush that keeps you going , &quot; says Ash , whose successful restaurant John Ash and Co . was founded in Santa Rosa nearly 15 years ago , but who now makes his sauces for Fetzer Vineyards in Mendocino County . Eventually Ash felt the adrenaline collapse as the day-to-day routine of cooking took its toll . * Malicki , who ran his own restaurant , Truffles , in Sebastopol in western Sonoma County , says he disliked the non-cooking aspects of running a restaurant . He found cost_analysis of the commercial operation to be tiresome . He also disliked the headache of dealing with such mundane pursuits as the whims of purveyors , staff and insurance_companies . He is now five miles up the road at Iron_Horse Vineyards . &quot; I enjoy this a lot more , &quot; says Malicki . &quot; I can be home at night , and I don ' t have to make money ( for someone else ) . &quot; Comfort spoke_of the hectic pace of the restaurant kitchen . At Checkers , he says , &quot; Cooking was two hectic hours at lunch and three hours at dinner. &quot; That sort of schedule dictates shortcuts in cooking , he says , that don ' t always make_for the best food . Now at Beringer Vineyards in the Napa Valley , he can take the time and care necessary to create great cuisine in a generally unhurried manner . Of course , there are those who seem to thrive on the excitement of the restaurant kitchen . Gary Danko , a Madeleine Kamman-trained chef of extraordinary talent , preceded Comfort as staff chef at Beringer before moving_on . For the last two years he has been head chef at the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco and has won high praise from critics . But Ash , Comfort and Malicki would rather be cooking in less-public surroundings . * Before he started cooking professionally , Ash was a photographer and medical illustrator in San Francisco with an interest in food styling and cooking . &quot; I ' d always loved to cook , &quot; he says , &quot; it was my little passion. &quot; Eventually , he landed a position at Del Monte Foods as head of new product development , where he came_up with the idea of the pudding-in-a-cup , something far removed from haute cuisine . He tired_of the corporate life , however . So he toured Europe , taking courses at cooking schools such_as La Varenne in Paris and Cordon_Bleu in London . When he returned to San Francisco , he operated a small catering company . In 1979 he mentioned his desire to cook to neighbor George Smith and his wife , Nancy Doyle , two physicians who loved great wine and food . The Smiths encouraged Ash to start a restaurant , and they helped arrange financing . John Ash and Co . opened in a Santa Rosa shopping_center to rave reviews in 1980 . In 1988 it moved five miles north to a new building at the Vintner ' s Inn . But Ash , 51 , says that after cooking professionally for more_than a decade he began to find menu development more interesting . When he was offered a position as staff chef with Fetzer Vineyards in Mendocino , he didn ' t think_twice . He remains a consultant at the restaurant bearing his name , but now prepares smaller meals out of a large two-section kitchen at Fetzer ' s Valley_Oaks property . * At verdant Valley_Oaks , two hours north of San Francisco and a mile east of Highway 101 , Fetzer ' s kitchen is set_up back behind the organic garden that was one of the major reasons Ash took this job . The rear kitchen , closed_off from the rest of the circular , pergola-designed building , is large enough for the army of chefs necessary to cook for 150 , which happens occasionally . The front kitchen is a teaching line , above which are angled mirrors so guests can see what ' s cooking . Ash says when his restaurant clearly was becoming a grind , he thought_about what he ' d do instead . &quot; I wondered whether I had another restaurant in me , &quot; he says . &quot; I was wondering what the hell I ' d do later in life . Well , I found that as I got older , I liked to yak about food. &quot; He started doing a Saturday radio show in Sonoma County and three years ago , when he joined Fetzer , he began writing cookbooks and teaching . Today he creates menus for the Fetzer Valley_Oaks Food and Wine Center in Hopland and travels extensively , cooking dinners at which Fetzer wines are served . He also is working_on a new cookbook , tentatively called &quot; John Ash ' s Wine Country Cuisine , &quot; to be published by E.P. Dutton . * Always a kitchen tinkerer , Beringer ' s Comfort , 36 , got his first restaurant job at 13 , a busboy in his hometown of Stockton . He worked part-time in kitchens for eight years before taking a two-year culinary course at San Francisco City College . Then , however , he jumped onto the fastest career track available to a chef . In a space of 12 years he worked with four great chefs . After working_at San Francisco ' s Stanford Court Hotel ( beginning as vegetable cook and leaving as sous chef ) , he served at Stars with Jeremiah Tower and then at Masa with the late Masataka Kobayashi . He also cooked for four years with founding chef Philippe Jeanty at Domaine Chandon before taking_over as head chef at Checkers in Los Angeles , the hectic but acclaimed downtown hotel restaurant . Two years after joining Checkers , he moved to the calm and professional -- and decidedly less glamorous -- kitchen at Beringer Vineyards , mainly for the chance to push the envelope of creative cookery . His kitchen is larger than any he ' s ever toiled in . Beringer designed a twin , side-by-side cooking line and installed some of the most sophisticated equipment -- warming ovens , convection ovens , standard ovens and more -- in Hudson House , a restored and expanded turn-of-the-century farmhouse in St . Helena , across Highway 29 from the main winery . Comfort uses mainly the enclosed front kitchen ; instructor and cookbook author Madeleine Kamman uses the teaching half of the kitchen . Comfort has a staff of three who regularly assist turning_out five- and six-course dinners for VIP winery guests . * Malicki too began cooking at age 13 , after his mother died . His siblings were all grown , he says , &quot; so I was cooking dinner for my dad every night. &quot; At age 14 he took a part-time and weekend job at Delmonico ' s , a local restaurant in New Haven , Conn. , where , he says , he peeled a lot of garlic . After high_school he worked_at a variety of kitchen jobs before getting his first position as sous chef at Pear_Trees in New York , and at the affiliated River Cafe in Brooklyn . He was operating a catering business in New York ' s fashion district in 1984 when he and his wife took a trip to visit her sister in Sebastopol . &quot; I fell_in_love with this area , &quot; he recalls . &quot; When we went_back to New York , we asked ourselves why we came back. &quot; Two years later the Malickis moved west and opened Truffles in 1987 . But working nights and weekends was no fun , and running a restaurant added_to the stress level -- &quot; having to make a living at it , &quot; he says with a trace of disgust . Truffles was popular_with wine industry people because Malicki liked to experiment with Asian dishes , which go_with non-traditional wines , a favorite of winemakers . But Sebastopol isn ' t located in a major metropolitan center , so traffic midweek nights was slow . * When the Sterling family sought to replace Martha Buser ( now at Zuni Cafe in San Francisco ) as staff chef at their Iron_Horse Vineyards , Malicki , 35 , never hesitated . Now instead of cost_accounting and pricing of dishes , Malicki can simply walk through Audrey Sterling ' s amazing , multitiered garden of vegetables , fruits , and herbs and create taste sensations that work with Iron_Horse ' s line of wines , which includes spectacular sparkling_wine and lean , delicate Chardonnays . His kitchen is little more_than the original 9x9-foot kitchen that originally existed in the handsome Victorian home Barry and Audrey Sterling bought 20 years ago two miles west of Highway 116 on a rise in the middle of vineyards . The kitchen is small but has ample countertop space , and a rear door leading to the garden permits Malicki to grab fresh herbs to garnish plates just before serving . * Whom do these chefs cook for ? Wine buyers , mostly -- wholesale or retail salespeople who trek to the wine country to reacquaint themselves with the wineries they represent . At Fetzer , Beringer and Iron_Horse , food is such an integral part of the winery ' s message that the chefs work almost daily on meals for one client or another , or for visiting importers from other countries . One recent event was for a group of wholesale people from Miami who were touring the wine country for five days , seeing a dozen wineries . Most of the time , wineries brought_in caterers to cook luncheons . At Iron_Horse , however , they arrived_at 10 a.m. for a tasting of new releases and barrel samples with Forest Tancer , the head winemaker . Then the guests walked down the unpaved pathway , between the row of flowering bushes , to the porch-graced Victorian home . On a rear patio , Iron_Horse sparkling_wine accompanied smoked salmon canapes and quail eggs and caviar . At 12:30 , lunch was served in the smaller of two indoor dining_areas , with Iron_Horse Fume Blanc accompanying a light appetizer , Chardonnay served with a seafood dish , then the Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon with local cheeses . The point of the luncheon was_well made when the wholesalers realized that the delicate 1991 Chardonnay , which may be passed_over in a traditional tasting with many other wines , was a perfect foil for the delicate seafood , and that the 1989 Cabernet went well with the two cheeses . All three chefs also cook for other special occasions . For instance , Ash recently prepared dinner in honor of a Chilean winemaker affiliated with Fetzer ' s parent company , Brown Forman of Louisville . Comfort prepared a dinner for the owner of a large retail operation . Comfort also occasionally does major dinners of 50 or 100 for groups that contract with the winery . Recently the Marin Wine and Food Society held a birthday dinner in honor of Dr. Bernard Rhodes , owner of the Bella Oaks Vineyard and a partner in Heitz Cellars . Comfort prepared a six-course meal , served on china by a tuxedoed staff . Beringer wines and wines from other producers were poured into cut crystal . * Malicki may have the most varied job of the three . Though he rarely cooks for as large a crowd as Comfort or Ash , he cooks more often . Not only does he frequently cook for the Sterling and Tancer families ( winemaker Forest is married to Barry and Audrey ' s daughter , Joy ) , but he also does harvest luncheons throughout the fall . All three chefs declined to discuss their salaries , but say it ' s comparable_to what they made at their last restaurant positions . Industry_analysts say salaries here range between $ 70 # 000 and $ 100 # 000 per year . Although that ' s more_than the owner of a small gourmet cafe might take_home , it ' s less than the owner of a great restaurant might make . What they do this for , they all say , is the greater freedom they get_at the smaller winery kitchen than they had at the restaurant . In this peaceful setting , they can concentrate_on such subtle elements as matching a specific wine with a specific dish . &quot; At the restaurant , you never knew whether someone was ordering white or red with a dish , so you had to think_about how a dish would go_with more_than one wine , &quot; says Ash . This meant occasionally making a dish that wasn ' t as exciting as it could have been . Moreover , says Comfort , he ' s not locked into making recipes the same way each time ; he has more flexibility in how he prepares things . &quot; I ' m constantly tasting the wine we ' re serving that day , &quot; he says , &quot; and then tasting the dish , to see if the dish needs fixing. &quot; * Also , when they are cooking for a small group , these chefs can concentrate_on artistic elements that might be impossible in the heated atmosphere of the restaurant kitchen . These touches might be a more architectural display of the food , or a more time-consuming preparation . Comfort admits that it ' s nice to gain accolades for a dish , get your name in the newspaper , or walk_out after a dinner amid applause . &quot; Some people like that setting , &quot; says Comfort . &quot; I like this one. &quot; * John Ash often makes non-chocolate desserts that work well with Fetzer ' s sweeter wines . This flavorful cake works best with Fetzer ' s Black Muscat or Gewurztraminer . ALMOND CAKE WITH BALSAMIC STRAWBERRIES AND ORANGE MASCARPONE 8 ounces almond paste 1 / 2 cup butter 3 / 4 cup sugar 3 large eggs 1 / 4 teaspoon almond_extract 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier or other orange_liqueur 1 / 4 cup flour 1 / 2 teaspoon baking powder Powdered sugar Balsamic Strawberries Orange Mascarpone In mixer , cream together almond paste , butter and sugar .

Ash suggests it be accompanied by a lighter Cabernet Sauvignon such_as Fetzer Barrel Select or , interestingly , an off-dry Gewurztraminer .
