   <HEADLINE> GET READY FOR A REAL TASTE OF HANUKKAH SPIRIT ; RELIGION : JEWS WILL CELEBRATE THE EIGHT-DAY FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS WITH MUSIC , PAGEANTRY -- AND TRADITIONAL FOODS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In some ways , it makes_sense that Hanukkah comes_on the heels of Thanksgiving this year . Why not go right from one food-filled holiday of family celebration and togetherness to another ? &quot; Religion should begin in the kitchen , &quot; said a chuckling Carol Cooperman , a member of Temple Beth David in Westminster . To put her words into practice , she plans to take applesauce and traditional latkes , potato_pancakes , to share with office co-workers at Golden West College . For Cooperman and thousands of other Jews in Orange County , the eight-day Jewish Festival of Lights begins tonight . Observances will be conducted at synagogues , community_centers and homes throughout the week . For about 2 # 000 years , Jews have observed Hanukkah as a celebration of religious freedom . The holiday commemorates the 165 BC victory of the outnumbered Maccabees over the Syrians , who had captured and defiled the temple in Jerusalem with Greek_deities . A popular legend told to children involves the &quot; miracle of the oil &quot; : The Maccabees needed to reclaim and cleanse the temple , but could find enough consecrated oil to keep their eternal light ignited only for one day . The flame miraculously burned for eight days , leading to the eight-day celebration . * When people think_of Hanukkah , many think_of the colorful traditions that children find special : the dreidel , or spinning toy top ; the hanukkiah , or Hanukkah menorah ; and the pancakes , fried jelly doughnut-like sufganiyot and other delicacies served on Jewish tables . But Rabbi Arnold Rachlis of the University Synagogue in Irvine wants adults to keep a Hanukkah message in mind too . &quot; I ' ll talk_about the historical story , &quot; Rachlis said , &quot; and I ' ll ask people to think_about mediating between being acculturated to mainstream American society and being Jewish. &quot; Still , his synagogue won ' t forget kids . A Hanukkah play , choir performances and a family service will begin at 7:30 p.m. Friday . &quot; It ' s a three-ring Hanukkah service , &quot; Rachlis said . &quot; The only thing we don ' t have is a magician. &quot; Rabbi Michael Mayersohn of Temple Beth David said Hanukkah is really a celebration in the home . &quot; Most of it goes_on in people ' s houses , &quot; he said . Mayersohn ' s congregation will participate in a public menorah lighting , though , at the Long_Beach Jewish Community_Center on Wednesday . &quot; Historically it was a minor holiday , but it became more important in recent times , &quot; Mayersohn said , &quot; especially because of the influence of American culture and Christmas . But Hanukkah should be an opportunity for Jews to celebrate the survival of Jewish identity . . . and the preservation of Jewish traditions. &quot; Oddly enough , some who are Jewish have never experienced Hanukkah , said Charlene Edwards , director of special services at the Jewish Family Service in Orange . That organization will host a Hanukkah party for refugees from the former Soviet_Union who are observing their first holidays in the United States . Many were not allowed to practice their religion under Communist rule . Edwards said she sees about 100 new Russian refugees each year . &quot; We will tell the story of Hanukkah to the children in both English and Russian , &quot; Edwards said . They also will try to get 2- to 16-year-olds to take roles in a Hanukkah play . &quot; Some will play Jews , some will play Syrians , &quot; Edwards said . &quot; We take turns . . . you can be both. &quot; * The party on Sunday , the last_day of Hanukkah , will feature children ' s gifts and a speaker who recently emigrated from Russia , where she was an outspoken activist for the survival of Jewish_religion and culture . The Jewish Community_Center in Costa Mesa has also scheduled cultural events , including a visit by an Israeli dance troupe , which will perform and light a menorah at 8 p.m. Wednesday . Some Jews said the proximity of Thanksgiving and Hanukkah is unusual because Hanukkah , determined by the lunar_calendar , doesn ' t usually come this early . &quot; I think it snuck up_on everybody , &quot; Mayersohn said . Cooperman said the food aspect of the holidays helps everyone appreciate the richness of cultural and religious differences , whether Jew , Christian or other . Taking food to share at_work is a &quot; casual , everyday kind of thing , &quot; said Cooperman , a statistical clerk . &quot; I bring_in potato_pancakes , you bring_in fruitcake . . . . Eating is the best way of getting our understanding across. &quot;</TEXT>
