   <HEADLINE> SMALL VANGUARD PRESSES ITS CASE FOR JURY REFORMS ; COURTS : PROPOSALS INCLUDE LETTING JURORS ASK QUESTIONS OF ATTORNEYS . CRITICS SAY IT UPSETS THE BALANCE OF THE SYSTEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ten floors above this sunbaked city , five women and nine men take seats in Superior_Court Judge B . Michael Dann ' s courtroom to decide a stranger ' s fate -- and become the latest unwitting guinea_pigs in Dann ' s grand experiment in judicial reform . Dann welcomes the jurors and then encourages them to do what many of his fellow judges think is the unthinkable . The jurors can ask questions not raised by attorneys by slipping Dann messages , and he even proposes that jurors be allowed to discuss their notes -- and the evidence -- as they go_along . Before any testimony is heard , Dann gives each a printed copy of the jury instructions that clearly state what must be proved in the aggravated assault case , and reads them aloud . Then he leads them in the first of many seventh-inning stretches . Grinning , the once-fidgety jurors stand_in unison . For a moment , they look_like they ' re doing the wave . Dann ' s offbeat notion of how to run a trial has made many judicial colleagues exceedingly anxious since his &quot; experiments &quot; began four years ago . Some lawyers and prosecutors who come_before him contend that he abuses his courtroom authority to upset the sacrosanct balance of the jury_system . Others disagree , so_much so that Dann is in the vanguard of a small but growing number of legal_experts who say there is a tremendous need for jury reform , from the beginning of the complex process to its often rancorous end . He is one of an even smaller minority , in that he has a courtroom in which to test-drive the reforms , and he does not hesitate to use it . Jury reform is rapidly gaining support in the wake of such highly publicized -- and much questioned -- verdicts as the acquittals in the first Rodney G . King beating case and hung juries in the Menendez brothers ' murder trial . Many call_for sweeping improvements , warning that the jury trial system could self-destruct without them , or peter_out for lack of public participation . &quot; There are some who scoff at the idea &quot; of reform , said Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , who recently launched a task_force like one Dann heads in Arizona . &quot; But there are enormous questions , and enormous concerns. &quot; Study upon study suggest that the jury process is inherently dysfunctional because of its insistence on passive jurors who cannot interact with each other or the judge and lawyers . That , reformists argue , flies in the face of modern understanding of how people process information and understand it . Jurors &quot; are spoon-fed by lawyers and judges , and not all_of what they get is digestible and understandable , &quot; Dann said . &quot; And they are made to sit on their hands and keep their mouths shut. &quot; As a result , studies and some experts argue , an alarming number of jurors do not comprehend the stupefying amount of evidence and the convoluted jury instructions thrown at them in many complex trials . Sometimes they come_down on the wrong side of the law . Responding to concerns that overly homogeneous juries are skewing verdicts , New York recently began using unemployment and welfare lists to broaden the jury pool , and Los Angeles is looking_at similar measures . One in three jurors nationwide is impaneled under a &quot; one day , one trial &quot; system designed to lure more working professionals and low-income workers . Massachusetts , Colorado and Connecticut require employers to cover the first few days of service , and then the court pays $ 50 a day , even for the unemployed . Minnesota provides day_care . And judges in Bellflower and Downey were cloaking criminal juries in anonymity so they could deliberate without fear of retribution until an appellate_court ruled against them last week . &quot; These innovations , they need judicial supervision , but if they can be done , they would be wonderful , &quot; said G . Thomas Munsterman of the National Center for State Courts ' Center for Jury Studies near Washington . &quot; Examination is always healthy . I ' d like to think it ( jury_system ) is not so sacred that it can ' t be touched. &quot; In the nettlesome area of judicial reform , however , much seems sacred . Little has changed since 1735 , when one of the nation ' s first juries acquitted printer John Peter Zenger of sedition charges . That jury did not have the power to question or investigate , as earlier juries in England did , because lawyers had long before usurped that authority -- and have held onto it . Many in the legal Establishment like it that way , or at least tolerate it . But why ? Former Chief_Justice Warren Burger of the Supreme Court once encouraged judges to &quot; stretch the mind &quot; and embrace reform . Yet most are creatures of habit , who fear reform could lead to criticism by appellate_courts , said U.S. District Judge William Schwarzer , who heads the Federal Judicial Center in Washington . &quot; People are afraid of making changes out of fear they will introduce errors , &quot; said Schwarzer , a vocal proponent of reform . U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Patricia McGowan says judges &quot; are busy people &quot; and should not be expected to lead reform efforts ; lawyers respond that judges are often the only ones with the power to do so . Dann believes that lawyers enjoy adversarial trial battles in which they fight tooth and nail for their clients . They , and most judges , he says , covet their power and do not want to share it with juries . Worse , many worship the jury as an institution while harboring a deep distrust of the ability of jurors , Dann and others contend . &quot; It ' s an anomaly , &quot; Dann said during a break_in the trial . &quot; We trust them to decide life and death , but we don ' t trust them to take_notes , ask questions and get the information they need to make the right decision. &quot; Instead , as he does this day , Dann makes_sure his courtroom is not a battlefield between lawyer and prosecutor , but rather a classroom of sorts where jurors can think , communicate and learn . All well and good , says University of Delaware psychology professor Valerie Hans . &quot; The tightrope that you have to walk , &quot; she said , &quot; is getting more active juries without going too far and allowing them to become inquisitors. &quot; Los Angeles area professor and lawyer Franklin D . Strier writes in a new book that juries and judges should be given more authority , to counter &quot; adversarial dirty tricks , witness coaching , discovery abuse and hardball tactics. &quot; In Strier ' s 1988 survey , two-fifths of 3 # 800 Los Angeles jurors believed that attorneys were trying harder to distort or hide the facts than reveal them . Every reform effort has its opponents . Even a change as seemingly innocuous as note-taking , which some judges allow , has critics who say it limits jurors ' ability to observe the demeanor of witnesses and other signs of credibility . Most reforms already implemented focus_on pretrial issues , such_as getting more diverse jurors to go_along with the usual white retirees and government workers . Trial reform is far more rare . &quot; If it is taking_place , &quot; University of Minnesota Law_School Prof . Steven Penrod said , &quot; it is happening in a piecemeal fashion. &quot; Munsterman ' s group , with help from Dann and others , will soon review reform efforts nationwide . They will look_to Arizona , where Dann ' s committee of legal_experts spent a year formulating reforms at the state Supreme Court ' s request . This month , the group unveiled a 56-point reform blueprint that incorporates Dann ' s methods . It also proposes child_care and other juror perks , time_limits on_trials , better use of technology to help jurors recall exhibits and testimony , a juror &quot; bill of rights &quot; to ensure that jurors are treated with respect , and counseling for post-trial stress . The group also recommends that juries not only receive interim trial summaries to help them remember but legal advice from the judge if they appear headed for a deadlock . &quot; One judge on the East Coast recently asked me just what the hell is going_on out there in Phoenix , &quot; chuckled Superior_Court Judge Barry Silverman , one of Dann ' s colleagues . &quot; This is not avant-garde , crazy nonsense . It is common_sense , logical stuff . &quot; When lay people hear this , &quot; he added , &quot; they hit themselves on the head and say , ' Why haven ' t we been doing this stuff all along ? ' &quot; Task_forces in Louisiana , Oregon , Minnesota and New York recently released similar reform-oriented studies , and there are several new books on the subject . Two years ago , the American Bar Assn . and the Brookings Institution convened a national symposium at which experts said reform efforts should target jurors ' boredom , frustration , poor comprehension and confusion . However , trying to inject innovation into the court system appears easier said than done . &quot; Court reform , &quot; former New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Arthur T . Vanderbilt said 40 years ago , &quot; is no sport for the short-winded or the faint of heart. &quot; He wasn ' t exaggerating . In 1930 , a New York group proposed a long list of improvements . Trial_lawyer Colleen McMahon says they are &quot; still on the table. &quot; McMahon , who chairs New York state ' s task_force , likened the many current obstacles to reform to &quot; the elephant that is standing_in the middle of the room. &quot; She warned that unless much progress is made , &quot; there will not be enough jurors . It is that simple. &quot; Small steps have been taken . In Fairfax County , Va. , officials better prepare jurors by using cable TV to provide orientation . Phoenix and Los Angeles send prospective jurors a bar-coded badge that eliminates most paperwork . And there have been some substantive changes . More_than half the states now go beyond the traditional voter rolls , using driver ' s license lists and other databases to get jurors . Many are trying to eliminate longstanding occupational exemptions for lawyers , doctors , firefighters , clergy and morticians who say they are too busy to serve . Florida , Colorado and other states and cities have converted to the one-day , one-trial system . Critics say two week jury service , such_as that in Los Angeles County , is inefficient and boring , and scares_away professionals . Critics also contend that more needs to be done to prevent professional jury selection consultants from affecting trial outcomes . The U.S. Supreme Court prohibits removal of prospective jurors because of race or gender . In New Jersey , U.S. Court of Appeals Judge H . Lee Sarokin wants to bar all &quot; peremptory strikes &quot; ( eliminating jury candidates without cause ) , contending that they are no longer a tool for ensuring fair juries . Ways of splitting major trials into manageable parts and transferring some complicated civil trials from juries to judges are being examined . Other legal_experts are calling_for more Draconian measures , such_as taking divorce cases , business disputes and drug trials out of the hands of juries . New technologies are being used . In Los Angeles Superior_Court Judge George Trammell ' s courtroom , computers can display documents , photos and graphics , and video cameras allow jurors to watch attorneys , witnesses and the judge . Jurors in the O.J. Simpson case will be able to view evidence on 67-inch-screen TVs . Efforts to provide jury instructions , printed and in plain English , at the beginning or middle of the trial instead of at the end are multiplying . Garcetti is seeking a $ 60 # 000 federal grant to make all Los Angeles County jury instructions more understandable . Garcetti , like his predecessor Robert Philibosian 10 years before him , believes that California may do_well to look_at jury_systems in Oregon and Louisiana . Those states have long used non-unanimous juries in all but the most serious murder cases , with fewer hung juries as a result . And Garcetti supports legislation to temporarily bar jurors from making money off high-profile trials such_as Simpson ' s . There are myriad other suggestions : Sharply limit exemptions and hold trials at night to get more professionals on juries . Provide jurors with reference_books so they can understand complex issues such_as DNA testing . Upgrade jury rooms . Some , such_as the Montana-based Fully Informed Jury Assn. , are pushing controversial &quot; jury nullification , &quot; in which jurors can essentially place their conscience above the law and acquit even defendants who broke a law . Others argue for smaller juries , saying they save money . Opponents say shrinking juries would make them less representative and more prone to mistakes . While all these proposals are bandied_about , Dann is using his courtroom to test many of them , without telling jurors how unusual they are until their work is done . Then he interviews them to see how it all worked . Dann , 54 , is an inveterate prankster with a schoolteacher wife , three grown children and a passion for Phoenix Suns basketball . Driving his Honda sedan , he is cautious , never challenging the speed_limit . But he is daring when it comes_to the law . You cannot , he says , effect change if you are paralyzed by fear of reversal by a higher_court or criticism from the legal Establishment . He laughs about a meeting not too long ago at which a bunch of judges &quot; almost hooted me out of the room &quot; when he brought_up some reform ideas . He is far from the most popular person in the Maricopa County_Courthouse , even though several judges are trying some reforms . When court personnel gathered outside one recent noontime , they erupted into argument at the mere mention of his name . &quot; He ' s stupid , off the wall , &quot; snapped one former clerk of Dann ' s . &quot; I ' ll defend the guy till the cows come_home , &quot; countered a former bailiff , who said Dann ' s changes made jurors the best and happiest in the courthouse . Dann relishes causing such a judicial ruckus , and expects some opposition when the recommendations go before the Arizona Supreme Court , which will vote within six months on which ones to adopt . &quot; In general , they are excellent , &quot; said Chief_Justice Stanley Feldman . Prominent attorney Joseph Shaw , 82 , believes reform is long overdue . To the judicial_system , he says , &quot; this was all like Catholicism -- you just didn ' t do certain things . But it ought to be done. &quot; Deputy County Atty . Michael Kemp was dead-set against the newfangled jury empowerments -- until he tried a_few cases before Dann and won . &quot; Now I ' m all for it , &quot; he said . &quot; In a rape case , a real ugly case , ( jurors ) asked some very good questions. &quot; Jurors in a recent murder case posed a host of questions , including soliciting more information from a ballistics expert . &quot; What kind of ammo used ? &quot; one note read . &quot; How did ( defendant ) acquire the weapon ? &quot; &quot; Can jurors see the gun ? &quot; Dann said questions helped jurors arrive_at a swift conviction . Back at the courtroom as jurors take a break , defense_lawyer Greg Clark is growling about the question privilege ; his client faces a year in prison . &quot; It ' s stupid , &quot; he said , out of Dann ' s earshot . &quot; If a lawyer can keep things out ( of trial ) and hoodwink his opponent , why would you then allow jurors to get_around what you ' ve so laboriously orchestrated ? Why should we allow some juror to ask a question we don ' t know the answer to ? &quot; Dann says that is precisely why jurors should be able to ask questions . Too many lawyers and prosecutors , he says , &quot; hide the ball &quot; and trick jurors , often with great success . The recent trial is short and uneventful , and after Dann orders the two sides to negotiate a plea bargain , Clark ' s client pleads no contest and is given probation . None of the jurors asked any questions . Eight jurors later said they could not imagine why all juries do not have the same powers that they did . &quot; If we have the responsibility , why shouldn ' t we have the tools we need ? &quot; asked Eileen Sampanes , a health_care professional . &quot; If I was_on the other side of that ( defendant ' s ) table , I would want the people sitting in judgment to have the same powers , the same ability . It makes_it as fair as possible. &quot; About This Series In this four-part series , The Times examines the strengths and flaws of the American jury_system and the need for reform . * Sunday : Deadlocks in recent high-profile cases have thrown the spotlight on the U.S. jury_system , raising questions about whether it deserves to survive . * Monday : High-priced consultants are helping defendants pick favorable juries , but how much of a difference can they really make ? * Tuesday : The Times Poll examines attitudes toward jury service and the jury_system in Los Angeles County . * Today : Warning that the jury trial system could self-destruct without change , a small but growing number of legal_experts are calling_for sweeping reforms . THE TIMES POLL : How to Improve the System Los Angeles County residents were asked whether certain changes in the jury_system would improve it or make_it worse . Three of the five recommendations--juries reaching a verdict by majority vote rather than the current unanimous vote , requiring jurors to have a minimum level of education and requiring that every jury reflect the racial , ethnic and gender distribution of the local population--all were supported by half or more of those polled . Other suggested reforms were far less popular . What would you think_about requiring jurors to have a minimum level of education ? Would that improve the system , make_it worse or have no effect ? 07 # 11 , 05 # 16 , 07 # 07 , 08 # 07 All Served on Jury White Black Latino Asian Improve 58 % 56 % 63 % 50 % 53 % 63 % Worse 18 % 19 % 17 % 12 % 23 % 9 % No Effect 21 % 21 % 17 % 36 % 21 % 25 % * * * What would you think_about requiring that every jury reflect the racial , ethnic and gender distribution of the area ? 07 # 11 , 05 # 16 , 07 # 07 , 08 # 07 All Served on Jury White Black Latino Asian Improve 51 % 38 % 43 % 67 % 58 % 46 % Worse 14 % 20 % 20 % 9 % 10 % 11 % No Effect 27 % 34 % 29 % 19 % 24 % 35 % * * * What about allowing juries to reach a verdict by majority vote rather than the current unanimous vote required ? 07 # 11 , 05 # 16 , 07 # 07 , 08 # 07 All Served on Jury White Black Latino Asian Improve 50 % 48 % 46 % 42 % 57 % 62 % Worse 27 % 36 % 36 % 30 % 15 % 19 % No Effect 17 % 8 % 12 % 23 % 22 % 14 % * * * What about allowing a judge to make the decision about a suspect ' s guilt or innocence in some trials without having a jury at all ? 07 # 11 , 05 # 16 , 07 # 07 , 08 # 07 All Served on Jury White Black Latino Asian Improve 34 % 37 % 35 % 26 % 35 % 34 % Worse 43 % 40 % 43 % 53 % 40 % 36 % No Effect 16 % 15 % 13 % 17 % 20 % 22 % * * * What about reducing the size of a jury so fewer people would have to reach a consensus for a verdict ? 07 # 11 , 05 # 16 , 07 # 07 , 08 # 07 All Served on Jury White Black Latino Asian Improve 33 % 28 % 30 % 22 % 42 % 29 % Worse 33 % 40 % 37 % 36 % 29 % 27 % No Effect 26 % 25 % 24 % 39 % 23 % 36 % NOTE : Numbers do not add_to 100 % because the &quot; Don ' t Know &quot; category is not shown . SOURCE : L.A. Times Poll interviewed 1 # 703 Los Angeles County adults , including 1 # 038 residents who are eligible to serve on juries and 355 people who have served , Sept . 17 through 23 . The margin of sampling error for the total sample and eligible jurors is plus or minus 3 percentage_points . Around the World No other developed country allows lay people as much power to decide civil disputes and criminal cases as the United States . Here is a look_at legal_systems in other countries : ISRAEL Most cases are tried by one judge , but murder and rape trials are handled by panels of three district court judges . Judges are chosen by a panel consisting_of the Supreme Court president , two other Supreme Court judges , the justice minister , a lower court judge , two members of the Israel Bar Assn . and two members of the Knesset , Israel ' s parliament . The Supreme Court president also assigns judges to cases . Thus , unlike the U.S. system , the criminal defendant has almost no say in the process of choosing who will decide his case . GREAT_BRITAIN Although Americans borrowed the jury_system from England , the_British rarely use juries for civil trials , except in libel cases . British juries decide criminal cases and usually must reach unanimous verdicts . If deliberations take longer than two hours , however , judges in London often accept a majority verdict . Jurors are selected at random from registered voters who are 18 to 70 years old . BELGIUM A 12-person jury is required for all capital cases . The system has been controversial because so few people are willing to serve . A furor erupted in Brussels last year when the trial of a notorious accused international gangster and killer had to be delayed for six months because of a lack of jurors . Jurors claimed to be ill , on vacation or too frightened of repercussions to serve . GERMANY Lay people serve with judges on panels to decide criminal cases . A majority vote is needed for a verdict . In serious crimes , judges make_up the majority of the panel . Lay jurors make_up the majority when cases involve minor offenses . Some German legal_experts contend that the lay people are just window dressing , with the real power residing with the judges . Complaints about the system focus more on the judges and their competence than on the lay jurors . CANADA Judges can overturn a jury acquittal in a criminal case and freely comment to the jury on the evidence . Judges also decide most civil cases , although litigants can seek jury trials . Judges and defendants are given great discretion to decide how much of pretrial deliberations may be made public . A defendant , for instance , can ask , and is automatically granted , a prohibition against news_reports of pretrial hearings . Reporters may observe courtroom proceedings but cannot report on them until after a jury is seated . JAPAN Judges have sole power to decide the outcome of trials . Without the need to worry about minimizing disruptions in jurors ' lives , trials proceed slowly , often taking years before arguments are completed and verdicts are rendered . Although the judges are supposed to be impartial , scholars say they are influenced by a variety of pressures , such_as organized public campaigns . Judges are widely believed to consider how their decisions might affect their chances for promotion . Compiled from Times staff reports</TEXT>
