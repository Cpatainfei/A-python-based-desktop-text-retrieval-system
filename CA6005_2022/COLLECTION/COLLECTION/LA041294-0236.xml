   <HEADLINE> U.S. HOPEFUL AIR STRIKES WILL SPUR NEW PEACE TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Clinton_Administration officials were hopeful Monday that the combination of air strikes near Gorazde and a Russian diplomatic_mission to the Serbian capital would provide the stick and carrot needed to get Bosnian Serbs to resume negotiating an end to the bloody civil_war . But they acknowledged the danger that their efforts could backfire , causing the Bosnian Serbs to try to grab more territory or leading the Bosnian government to wrongly believe that North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization involvement provides cover to try to recapture territory lost to Serbs earlier in the war . &quot; It ' s ugly , &quot; one senior White_House official said . Despite that risk , Clinton aides said that American officials think they had no choice but to carry_out the air strikes , given that NATO has promised to offer protection to U.N. forces and there is now a U.N. commander on the scene , Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , in whom Washington has confidence . Officials issued clear warnings to the Serbs that further attacks could be launched if Serbian aggression continues to endanger U.N. peacekeepers in Gorazde or in other Bosnian &quot; safe havens. &quot; Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , in a televised interview , said the Bosnian Serbs should not misread the limited nature of the NATO attack as a signal that future air strikes would also involve just a_few craft . Speaking on the &quot; MacNeil / Lehrer NewsHour , &quot; Perry said , &quot; NATO has well_over 100 planes in this air fleet , so we have a formidable air armada there . &quot; So it would be a very big miscalculation for the Serbs to believe that this was a force which was limited to conducting an occasional close air support mission , &quot; he said . &quot; We can conduct much more_than that if necessary. &quot; The Administration ' s carrot-and-stick strategy depends_on a successful effort by Russian envoy Vitaly S . Churkin , who has been meeting with Serbian leaders in Belgrade . Despite that , the Administration did not inform Moscow before launching the air strikes , leading to complaints from the Russians . Asked about the complaints , President Clinton told reporters , &quot; When these things occur , there ' s often not a lot of time . &quot; We are trying to work very closely with the Russians , &quot; he insisted . &quot; They have a critical role to play if we are going_to get these peace talks going again , and I hope we can. &quot; American officials took pains to insist the air strikes had taken_place pursuant to U.N. procedures to which Russia had agreed -- procedures designed to protect the lives of U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia -- and were executed under tight deadlines that prevented full consultation with other nations . The NATO response to a U.N. request for air support in Gorazde operated under &quot; very great time urgency , &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said at a news_conference . &quot; This system is set_up so that NATO can respond promptly . Lives are at risk. &quot; For his part , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , who spoke with Clinton on Sunday , offered a tepid response to the NATO air strikes . En route to Spain for an official visit , Yeltsin said , &quot; I insisted and continue to insist that questions like air strikes on Serbian positions must_not be decided without preliminary consultation between the United States and Russia. &quot; But Yeltsin stopped short of condemning the NATO attack on Serbian artillery despite mounting pressure from Russian nationalists , including ultranationalist leader Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , who see the Serbs as ethnic and religious brethren . Russian Foreign Ministry officials were more critical of the NATO action . &quot; A couple more strikes like this and we can kiss the peace process goodby , &quot; an anonymous Russian diplomat told the Interfax news_agency . In Madrid , Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev warned that &quot; air strikes could bring not an end to war but its escalation. &quot; But aside from those remarks , the Foreign Ministry issued an official statement that set_out a policy toward Gorazde that was almost identical to that put forth by Clinton and Christopher , including deployment of more U.N. peacekeepers in and around Gorazde and a withdrawal of Serbian forces from territory captured in recent days . &quot; A contingent of U.N. forces should be deployed , Serbian units should be withdrawn from their present positions , and this secure region should be demilitarized , including the disarmament of Muslim units operating there , &quot; the ministry said in its statement . At the State_Department , Christopher said much the same thing , urging the Serbs to cease hostilities and withdraw to &quot; their positions of March 30 , the date on which this latest offensive against Gorazde began. &quot; For the last two months , Moscow and Washington have pursued a loosely coordinated effort in which Churkin tries persuasion with Serbian leaders -- both in Bosnia and the neighboring republic of Serbia -- while NATO provides the threat of force . Officials here believe that approach is their best hope for restarting peace talks , which they thought were close to reaching an agreement last weekend before the Serbian offensive in Gorazde . At least some officials believe the offensive was staged precisely as a sabotage attempt by Bosnian Serb factions opposed to the talks . Asked about that , Christopher said he would &quot; hope that they get_in good communication &quot; with the Serbian leadership in Belgrade &quot; and they understand the determination of the United Nations and NATO in this situation. &quot; Elsewhere , the NATO action received largely favorable responses on Capitol_Hill , indicating that Clinton will have a relatively free hand politically , at least so_long as no American lives are lost . Sen . Joseph R . Biden Jr . ( D-Del. ) , second-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a longtime advocate of a more forceful American policy toward Bosnia , called the air strikes &quot; fully justified &quot; and said the &quot; successful demonstration of force . . . should lay to rest the tired arguments that ' air_power alone ' is ineffective in the Bosnian crisis. &quot; His comments were echoed by senior lawmakers in both parties , including Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) . Lauter reported from Washington and Goldberg from Moscow . Times staff writer Michael Ross , in Washington , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
