   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; YELTSIN ' VICTORY ' GIVES RUSSIA THAT OLD SUPERPOWER FEELING ; BOSNIA : THE KREMLIN LEADER ' S SARAJEVO INITIATIVE IS A RARE FOREIGN_POLICY TRIUMPH . IT OFFSETS FAILURES IN FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin basked Monday in the glow of a rare foreign_policy triumph so resounding that Russia felt almost like a superpower again . By winning Bosnian Serb agreement to withdraw artillery from around Sarajevo and thus avert NATO air strikes , Yeltsin secured &quot; a diplomatic victory for Russia on the scale not only of Europe but of the world , &quot; the president ' s spokesman said . Not_bad for a man out sick with a cold . Yeltsin returned to work after a nearly two-week absence on Monday , in time for the accolades . &quot; Without a single shot , without threatening anyone , without putting its soldiers ' lives in danger , without spending a single ruble , Russia has effectively won an important battle for its world status , &quot; said his spokesman , Vyacheslav V . Kostikov . The Russian success with the Serbs may or may_not hold , depending as it does on the volatile situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina . And Russian officials acknowledge that without the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s tough position on air strikes , the Serbs would not have withdrawn . But Yeltsin ' s Sarajevo initiative nonetheless served a double purpose , Russian commentators said . It won him desperately needed points at_home by playing to Russians ' sympathies for the Serbs , their fellow Orthodox Christian Slavs . And it gave Moscow a chance to clarify at least some of what is often a very murky foreign_policy , placing the Serbs definitely inside Russia ' s newly forming sphere_of_influence . &quot; If it holds , this is the first broad-scale success for Russian foreign_policy , in which Russia acted_as an independent force with clearly defined , conscious national interests , &quot; said Anatoly Rassadin , an analyst at the Institute for National Security and Strategic Studies in Moscow . &quot; Russia didn ' t fall_in_line with the West . It didn ' t try to act_on abstractions like democratic values or human_rights . It just clearly defined its national interests and brought them into practice , &quot; Rassadin said . This kind of success is especially welcome now , because Moscow has largely failed in its attempts to define and apply its foreign_policy in what Russians call &quot; the near abroad &quot; -- the other former republics of the Soviet_Union . Repeated attempts to quell the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh , Abkhazia and Tajikistan have gone nowhere . Moscow has managed to secure few guarantees for the 25 million Russians living_in other former republics , the largest diaspora in the world . It has remained deeply isolationist in the broader arena , still smarting from the cost -- in money and , in places such_as Afghanistan , in lives -- of the extensive Soviet sphere_of_influence . In the former Yugoslav federation , Russia has remained largely passive over the last two years , but when the NATO threat to bomb Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo grew imminent , Moscow apparently decided that it must be a partner in any international actions in Eastern Europe . Vitaly S . Churkin , Russia ' s special envoy in the former Yugoslav republics , expressed Moscow ' s sense of hurt pride at having been too often pushed to the sidelines . He told Russian television that &quot; the West should learn a lesson &quot; from events in Bosnia . &quot; And the lesson is that Russia should be treated as an equal partner , not the way some of them did_it this time. &quot; Yeltsin acted in part under the pressure of political competition . Russia ' s historic and religious ties to the Serbs made the Yugoslav conflict a natural grandstanding issue for ultranationalists like Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , whose success in the December parliamentary elections appears to have pushed Yeltsin toward a more nationalist stance . Zhirinovsky declared in Parliament that he would view any NATO bombing of Serb positions around Sarajevo as &quot; a declaration of war on Russia. &quot; Although never as extreme in his rhetoric , Yeltsin too cautioned that air strikes could escalate the Bosnian conflict , and he told visiting British Prime_Minister John Major last week that Russia could not be left_out of any resolution of the crisis . Since then , it seems , Yeltsin has been_on the phone several times a day with other world leaders , and in a letter-writing mode as well . Working mainly from his country_house , where a cold had laid him up , he appears to have run the most active diplomatic campaign of his presidency . On Monday , he continued his contacts , laying_out his vision of the next steps needed in Bosnia to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . Overall , he came_out looking very statesmanlike , to_the_point that Kostikov crowed that &quot; quietly , without haste , without superfluous publicity and noise , &quot; Yeltsin &quot; showed who is the indisputable leader of Russia today. &quot; According to Sergei A . Filatov , Yeltsin ' s chief_of_staff , the president also showed that &quot; the adoption of major decisions on the security of the world community without Russia does not work. &quot; As Russia asserted itself , echoes of the old superpower rivalry sounded in its dire warnings of the possibly calamitous results of NATO air strikes -- hints that Moscow could be drawn into the conflict and that the Cold_War opponents would once again face each other across the battlefield . Given the domestic pressure to defend the Serbs , Yeltsin had little choice but to sound a relatively hard line . &quot; If Russia had kept quiet and the bombing had started , it would have led to a colossal internal explosion in Russia politically , &quot; said Alexander Konovalov , a military expert at the U.S.A.-Canada Institute . &quot; Maybe it would n ' t have gotten_to the point of street demonstrations , but maybe it would have. &quot; Fortunately , the faint threat of a return to Cold_War enmity ended ideally . Instead of facing each other down , analysts say , Russia and the West moved toward a new kind of partnership . &quot; This is a deepening of Russian-American relations , &quot; Rassadin said . &quot; The very fact of resolving a joint problem is a giant step_forward -- just a giant step_forward -- because our goals were identical. &quot; And so far , each side appears to have received what it wanted most . &quot; The Serbs could keep their face and react to the ultimatum , and the West gets what it wanted with the end of the blockade of Sarajevo , &quot; Rassadin said . &quot; And Russia goes from a passive observer to an active player. &quot;</TEXT>
