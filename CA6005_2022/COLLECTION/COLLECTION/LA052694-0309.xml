   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN SAVORS IRONIES OF MEETING WITH PERRY AT NATO HEADQUARTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia ' s Pavel S . Grachev was the perfect host Wednesday as he opened a meeting here with U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry . The irony of the situation only seemed to buoy his mood even more . &quot; It seems strange to me that I ' m welcoming you here to this building today , &quot; the Russian defense minister told his American counterpart , smirking at the circumstances . Perry too broke_into a grin . The session over which Grachev was presiding was being held_in Conference_Room No . 2 at NATO headquarters here , and the sign outside announced &quot; Russia &quot; -- for the Russian delegation . Grachev , a four-star general who made 634 parachute jumps while he was an officer in the former Soviet army , was taking the biggest leap of his career : He was here to sign Russia up for NATO -- as a sort of associate member for now . Moreover , the Russians were not the only military officials from the former East Bloc to rate their own suite at the NATO ministerial meeting here this week . The broad , heavily carpeted concourse that leads to NATO ' s main meeting chamber was dotted with the oversized military caps of officers from 18 other onetime Communist countries . It might have been a meeting of the now-defunct Warsaw Pact , joked a local wag . The session , which followed a meeting of NATO defense ministers on Tuesday , marked the first meeting of the Partnership for Peace , a kind of auxiliary program that the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization has set_up for former East Bloc countries . And for all_of the joking , it was one of those days on which even the most seasoned diplomats and military_officers were overcome by the sense that they were witnessing an important piece of history . &quot; I think everyone is sort of awed by it all , &quot; mused a U.S. officer who has spent his career trying to prepare_for a possible confrontation with Soviet forces . &quot; I thought I ' d never see this come. &quot; To be sure , the Russians will not actually join the PfP , as it is becoming known here , until sometime in early June , when Moscow presents its final application at a meeting of NATO foreign_ministers in Istanbul , Turkey . But Grachev was here this week to present formally Russia ' s preliminary proposal for its terms of membership -- ending weeks of hot-and-cold statements from Moscow about whether the Kremlin would or would not sign_up . And , to the relief of Western diplomats here , he was unambiguous about reports that the Russians would insist on special conditions : &quot; Absolutely nyet , &quot; he told reporters at the opening of the session . A mood of optimism lasted all day Wednesday . After the morning session , the NATO ministers , Grachev and the defense chiefs of the 18 Partnership for Peace member countries posed for what was deliberately dubbed a &quot; family portrait. &quot; And Ukraine ' s defense minister , Vitaly Radetsky , who was scheduled to meet with Perry after the session with Grachev , refused to take offense when the American was late . &quot; we ' ll make_up for it tonight , &quot; he said lightheartedly . The ironies continued into the evening . After a day of bilateral meetings here in Brussels , Perry and the other ministers flew_by helicopter to the Belgian city of Mons for a tour of the new building at the allies ' European headquarters that will serve as a military center for Partnership for Peace countries . The structure , which was completed in 1990 , originally was built as an evacuation center in case Western Europe were invaded by the Soviet Bloc . A chunk of the fallen Berlin Wall now serves as statuary at its entrance .</TEXT>
