   <HEADLINE> CLINTONS TO DELIVER FILES ON LAND DEAL TO INVESTIGATORS ; PROBE : FIRST FAMILY ' S ACTION IS TIED TO GRAND_JURY SUBPOENA THAT WILL HELP KEEP THE PAPERS PRIVATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton ' s personal lawyer today will begin giving federal investigators records of the First Family ' s Whitewater Development Corp . investment after a grand_jury subpoena was issued , the White_House said Wednesday . The subpoena , issued Dec . 24 and disclosed in a White_House statement Wednesday night , directs that the documents be surrendered to the Justice_Department by Jan . 18 . The White_House said it would comply . Bruce R . Lindsey , senior adviser to Clinton , said in the statement that the subpoena was issued at the request of the Clintons ' lawyer , David E . Kendall , who sought the order &quot; to assure the integrity of the documents and the privacy of the process. &quot; Under the subpoena , the papers may only be viewed by Justice_Department officials and are less likely to be made public . It also has the effect of impeding access to the documents by Republicans in Congress who are trying to conduct an independent inquiry , Republican sources in Congress charged Wednesday . The Justice_Department is investigating the Clintons ' investment in an Ozark Mountains vacation property development known as Whitewater to determine whether funds were improperly diverted to the project from Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan , a failed thrift run_by James B . McDougal , the Clintons ' partner in the Whitewater deal . The five boxes of records to be delivered to the Justice_Department include papers relating to Whitewater removed from the office of former deputy White_House counsel Vincent Foster , who committed suicide last July 20 . The White_House agreed two weeks ago to surrender the Foster papers but until Wednesday had not said when it would do so . With attention to the real_estate deal growing , the way the_matter is resolved could have a lasting effect on Clinton ' s presidency , his advisers and critics agreed . What had appeared to be benign and small-scale financial dealings while Clinton was governor of Arkansas are now being cast in terms of scandal with a grand_jury subpoena , demands for a special prosecutor and calls_for congressional hearings unless the White_House can provide persuasive answers to dozens of questions . White_House officials -- from the Clintons on down -- have said they believe that continuing interest in the_matter is driven by partisan politics . They have insisted that allegations of financial wrongdoing , conflicts_of_interest and gross cronyism are groundless . &quot; It ' s nothing but a Republican witch hunt , &quot; said White_House political adviser Paul Begala . But Leonard Garment -- who had extensive experience with scandal as a White_House lawyer under former President Richard Nixon -- said the Whitewater matter could be a continuing migraine for the President and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . In the lingo of Washington journalism , the Whitewater story has &quot; legs &quot; -- or staying power , he said . &quot; The Whitewater affair potentially has legs , arms -- and very sharp teeth , &quot; he added . What is driving the Whitewater story are unanswered questions about the way the Clintons conducted their public and private business dealings . Here is an abbreviated rundown : * How much did the Clintons invest in the Whitewater real_estate deal and how much did they gain or lose ? According to official accounts from the Clintons , they invested $ 68 # 900 in Whitewater beginning in 1978 while McDougal and his wife , Susan , put_up $ 92 # 000 . Despite the unequal shares , the partnership was structured as a 50-50 split . Why ? The Clintons have said they were merely &quot; passive investors &quot; in Whitewater who gave McDougal &quot; total control &quot; over the operation . They said they have no records of their investment or any profit or loss from it . Why not ? The investment raises several additional questions : Did the Clintons really put_up their share of the partnership funds or were the funds a loan or gift from McDougal and his wife ? If the Clintons did invest the money in Whitewater , where is the documentation ? Whitewater failed to file income_taxes for three years in the 1980s and the impact on the Clintons ' tax_returns is unclear . Were the Clintons ' finances and tax_returns properly handled in those years ? There are also questions about the relationship between Madison Guaranty and Whitewater that may be covered by the records of the two entities , some of which are now in the hands of the Justice_Department . Others have not been located . McDougal said he delivered all_the Whitewater records to the Arkansas governor ' s mansion in 1987 , but the Clintons deny that they ever received them . There are allegations that some Whitewater land sales were sham transactions to hide contributions to Clinton ' s gubernatorial campaign and that Madison Guaranty funds were diverted to Whitewater . Investigators also want to know about the alleged diversion of $ 110 # 000 in proceeds from a Small Business Administration-backed loan to buy land for the Whitewater development . * Were the Clintons , through their investment , parties to mismanagement of a federally insured thrift ? Madison Guaranty -- owned by their friend , political contributor and investment partner McDougal -- grew from an institution with assets of $ 6 million to a $ 107-million thrift in a three-year period in the early 1980s . Despite warning signs that the S &amp; L was making questionable loans to insiders and numerous Clinton political associates , authorities did not close the bank until four years later . A state securities commissioner appointed by Clinton approved a plan to recapitalize Madison Guaranty , which at the time was represented by Hillary Clinton and her partners at a Little_Rock law_firm . The thrift finally was shuttered in 1989 , at a cost to taxpayers of at least $ 47.6 million . Was Clinton aware of the thrift ' s problems and did the institution receive favorable regulatory treatment while he was governor ? Who profited from the long delay in closing it ? Some of the loans that went_into default were made to people with close ties to the Clintons -- including current Gov . Jim Guy Tucker and Seth Ward , the father-in-law of Webster Hubbell , a former law partner of Hillary Clinton and now the No . 3 official at the Justice_Department . Madison Guaranty executives staged a fund-raiser in early 1985 to help Clinton retire $ 50 # 000 in debts from his 1984 gubernatorial campaign . Did the bank or its officers provide any other money for Clinton campaigns before or after 1985 ? Did the bank do any personal favors for the Clintons ? * Have the Clintons dealt forthrightly with questions about the_matter ? Have they or their associates in any way interfered with the inquiries ? Suspicions about suppression of evidence arose last month when it was revealed that Whitewater-related files were secretly removed from the office of Foster and deposited with the Clintons ' personal attorney two days after Foster ' s suicide in July . After initially resisting turning_over the files to the Justice_Department for its inquiries into McDougal ' s business dealings and the death of Foster , Clinton relented just before Christmas and agreed to give_up the records . There is also a question about whether there are additional relevant documents in the files of the Rose Law_Firm in Little_Rock , where Hillary Clinton , Hubbell and Foster all worked together throughout the 1980s . All three reportedly performed legal chores for McDougal and Madison Guaranty , but only the Foster files have turned_up and it is not known how complete they are . * Was the initial investigation of Whitewater / Madison Guaranty delayed for political reasons and is the case being fairly investigated by the Clinton Justice_Department ? Former Atty . Gen . William P . Barr , who served under former President George_Bush , said Wednesday he believes that the U.S. attorney ' s office in Little_Rock concealed from him in the fall of 1992 the existence of a Resolution Trust Corp . referral to the Justice_Department seeking a criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty and Whitewater . The delay could have aided then-candidate Clinton ' s campaign for the White_House by deferring a criminal investigation in the final months of the 1992 campaign . Barr said the Little_Rock office failed to put the referral into two different reporting systems that would have brought the sensitive matter_to his attention . He said he learned of the referral shortly before the November , 1992 , election . There are also questions about the ability of the Justice_Department under Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , a Clinton appointee , to conduct an impartial investigation of the President . Republicans in Congress have been pressing her to name an independent counsel to study the Whitewater affair . What Do the Investigators Want ? Justice_Department attorneys are investigating the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan , headed by a former Clinton friend , business partner and political ally , James McDougal . Investigators are trying to determine whether depositors ' funds were diverted to Clinton ' s 1984 gubernatorial campaign and to Whitewater Development Corp. , a real_estate venture once owned by the Clintons and McDougal . Clinton aides have said the President and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton never knew the source of the campaign money and were inactive co-owners of what they say was a money-losing real_estate deal . SOME KEY QUESTIONS INVESTIGATORS ARE SEEKING TO ANSWER * How much did the Clintons invest in the Whitewater deal and how much did they gain or lose from the investment ? * Were the Clintons , through their investment , actively party to the looting of a federally insured thrift ? * Was political influence used to benefit the land investment or delay exposure of wrongdoing at the failed savings and loan ? Did Clinton ' s political organization benefit from the dealings ? * Have the Clintons dealt forthrightly with the questions about the_matter ? Have they or their allies in any way interfered with the inquiries into it ? Source : Times Washington Bureau</TEXT>
