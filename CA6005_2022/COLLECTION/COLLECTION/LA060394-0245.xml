   <HEADLINE> NORTH REVERSES SELF , SUPPORTS TRUCE IN YEMEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The government in northern Yemen reversed its position Thursday and accepted a U.N. call_for a truce in the month-old war against southern secessionists . It was not clear what caused the government ' s change of heart about the U.N. resolution adopted Wednesday.Northern forces appeared to be overpowering the south , and the north had called international attempts to win a truce a &quot; flagrant interference &quot; in Yemen ' s internal affairs . The announcement of the government ' s new position coincided with reports that northern troops had come within 10 miles of Aden , the stronghold of the southern secessionists . Tribal , conservative North Yemen and socialist South Yemen merged into a single state in May , 1990 . The union was popular but beset by cultural and ideological differences and a power struggle between President Ali Abdullah Saleh , a northerner , and Vice_President Ali Salim Bidh , a southerner . &quot; The government is ready to respond to the resolution in a positive spirit . This will lead to full implementation of the resolution by all concerned , &quot; the government in the northern capital , Sana , said in a statement read on Sana Television . The resolution , backed by the southern forces , called_for an immediate cease-fire , an arms embargo of the warring parties and the dispatch of a U.N. fact-finding mission to Yemen . Earlier Thursday , northern forces fired a missile on Aden in their drive to capture the city and crush the southern secession . The missile exploded over Aden after southern forces shot at it , and there were no casualties . The north had rejected any suggestion of outside mediation , and before accepting the truce call , said it would only touch_off further fighting . The south has called_for the Arab League to oversee negotiations , but has not suggested a willingness to reunify .</TEXT>
