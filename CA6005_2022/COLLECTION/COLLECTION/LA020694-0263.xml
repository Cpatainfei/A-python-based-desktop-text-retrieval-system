   <TEXT> Along the Grand Canal , once-glorious Renaissance palaces are boarded_up or hidden behind scaffolding and signs explaining that they are &quot; in restauro &quot; -- &quot; under restoration. &quot; On narrow flagstone streets , people wearing jeans and carrying cameras far outnumber those wearing suits and carrying briefcases . In a residential_area that used to be filled with vegetable markets , hardware_stores and bakeries , shops sell papier-mache carnival masks , miniature gondolas and goblets decorated with bright fake jewels . This city , once known as &quot; La Serenissima , &quot; is no longer &quot; most serene. &quot; Its unique character -- perhaps its very existence -- is threatened . &quot; Venice has changed . It is no longer the place I knew , &quot; said Count Alvise Zorzi , who grew_up in Venice , has written its history and has been at the forefront of efforts to preserve it . &quot; Each time I return , I feel happy because I ' m back to my roots , &quot; said the 71-year-old historian , whose family ties to Venice go_back nearly 1 # 000 years . &quot; But I become sad when I have to face the concrete problems of today. &quot; The problems that trouble Zorzi and Venice-lovers everywhere include a shrinking population , an uncontrolled tourist invasion and the ravages of nature . Zorzi summed_up their impact : &quot; This was once a living city . Now it ' s like a holiday_resort , and its future is in danger. &quot; At its zenith in the 15th Century , Venice was a rich and powerful state that ruled a vast maritime empire . Magnificent palaces and churches , a renowned school of artists and the charm of its watery setting made_it a rival of Paris , Rome and other great cities . Ironically , during the last half-century or so , two elements that shaped Venice -- the Adriatic_Sea and foreign visitors -- have become the sources of many of its troubles . Built_on piles driven into the center of a crescent-shaped lagoon , Venice is disrupted regularly by high_tides and floods that weaken the foundations of residences and historic buildings and leave low-lying areas like St . Mark ' s Square under water . But it is the tides of tourists that are causing much of the concern these days . Venice attracts an average of 20 # 000 visitors a day , more_than 7 million a year . On some days during the summer peak season , more_than 100 # 000 clog the city , as_many as two-thirds of them day-trippers who spend little money and seldom wander far from two or three major attractions , mainly St . Mark ' s and the shop-lined Rialto Bridge . While tourists pour into the city , old-time Venetians are pouring_out . Since the end of World_War_II , Venice ' s population has dropped from more_than 170 # 000 to fewer than 75 # 000 . The decline continues at a rate of about 1 # 500 a year . &quot; It is not easy to live_in this city anymore , &quot; Zorzi said . &quot; One needs a great_deal of heroism. &quot; Much of the city is shabby , in constant disrepair . For centuries , boats cleaned the canals and repaired the foundations of the houses that lined them . That stopped in the 1960s because of political and budgetary problems . The cost_of_living is extremely high . Food , clothing , building materials and other goods must be brought_in by boat and on foot . Garbage and other waste must be removed the same way . Many of the huge residences have been subdivided into small apartments , but their aging plumbing and wiring have not been replaced . Flooding leaves the ground_floors unlivable , and there are no elevators . When buildings are renovated , their cost soars beyond the reach of average Venetians . Susanna Scarpa , a young tour guide , would like to live_in the city , but she can ' t afford $ 1 # 250 a month for a tiny , one-room apartment . So houses and apartments are sold to wealthy foreigners or to Italians from Milan , Florence and Rome who live_in them only a_few months each year . Even if the prices weren ' t prohibitive , blue-collar workers and middle-class families would leave the city to follow jobs to the mainland . There , the mainland suburb of Mestre has become the region ' s industrial center . Its neighbor , Marghera , has taken_over much of the maritime activity . Both have surpassed Venice in population . &quot; What is left , &quot; Zorzi said , &quot; is a city that serves tourists and the wealthy . Venice cannot survive that way. &quot; This realization has aroused concern from the Rialto to Rome , from Europe to the United States , and has inspired a number of suggestions and plans . The New Venice Consortium , a group of 26 Italian companies , was created in 1984 to confront the challenges of the sea . Among its strategies is a sophisticated system of mobile gates that could limit the inflow of sea water during high_tides . Reversing damage done_by decades of neglect will require more money and less politics . A push is being made_for a single governing authority in place of Venice ' s local-regional-national system . And what can be done about the tourist invasion ? As a start , Zorzi suggests that local officials work with tour operators to spread_out the dates that visitors come and to encourage them to spend time in other parts of the city besides its main attractions . Dr. Randolph H . Guthrie of New York , president of the United States-based Save Venice , one of many international groups working to preserve Venetian art and architecture , believes more drastic steps are needed . One possibility , he and others suggest , would be to sell a limited number of visitor tickets to the historic city . But critics fear that approach would turn Venice into a floating museum , a Disneyland with gondolas , that shuts its gates each night after the last bus and train depart for the mainland . Another proposal is to make Venice an international city , governed by the European Parliament or some similar multinational body . Whatever is done , Zorzi cautioned , Venice must remain a living city , accessible to everyone , and retain the charm , the traditions and the magic that made_it &quot; La Serenissima. &quot;</TEXT>
