   <HEADLINE> BRIEFING BOOK / CAROL J . WILLIAMS : INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; ONCE-BATTERED SLOVENIA EMERGES TO JOIN THE WESTERN ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ISSUE : Since breaking from Yugoslavia in 1991 , the tiny nation of Slovenia -- which was the Balkan federation ' s economic locomotive -- has been battered by a dizzying succession of crises that caused its gross_national_product to shrink almost 20 % . But industry leaders and financial analysts say the bad times have bottomed_out . Slovenia has reoriented exports to Western markets , and most indicators for 1993 point to recovery after a two-year tailspin . If the conversion from public to private ownership can be completed successfully -- a big if , critics say -- Slovenia could become the first former communist country to be fully integrated into the economic networks of Western Europe . BACKGROUND : A Western work ethic and Teutonic orderliness instilled during the era of Austro-Hungarian rule helped make Slovenia the most productive republic of Yugoslavia . While accounting_for only 8 % of the population , Slovenia contributed 25 % of Yugoslavia ' s GNP and more_than 35 % of hard-currency exports . Slovenes also enjoyed the highest living standards , with per capita income at $ 6 # 000 per year , above some European Union countries . But the emergence of Serbian nationalism spurred Slovenia ' s secession in June , 1991 . A Yugoslav federal army attack was repulsed by the fledgling Slovenian forces within 10 days , but it shattered the nation ' s image as a serene , stable corner of the roiling Balkans . Continuing hostilities in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina , as well as United Nations sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia , shut_down Slovenia ' s main markets . And a global recession took its toll on trade with everywhere else . As sales plummeted , unemployment shot_up to more_than 10 % . Inflation also soared two years ago to an annual rate of 1 # 000 % when the tolar was introduced to sever Slovenia from Yugoslavia ' s monetary_system . In 1992 , private consumption dropped more_than 7 % , GNP shrank 6 % on top of a 1991 contraction of 9 % , and investment plummeted 20 % . OUTLOOK : The hardships it has experienced has forced belt-tightening and restructuring in Slovenia . This has paid_off by making Slovenian light-manufacturing enterprises more efficient . Most firms have cut their work_forces and operating_costs more_than enough to compensate for lower sales , which are now picking_up . Sales to countries outside the former Yugoslavia now account_for more_than 80 % of exports . Slovenia has signed cooperation agreements with the European Union and the European Free_Trade Assn . and has earned the confidence of lending agencies . The three-year growth trend in unemployment began to reverse itself in 1993 , and new jobs are expected to be offered in some of the most swiftly recovering industries , such_as wooden furniture making , printing and publishing , textiles and tourism . Inflation is down to 1 % per month , or about 20 % a year -- high by Western standards but among the lowest in Eastern Europe and still falling . GNP was flat for 1993 after three losing years , but modest growth is expected for the next two years . Improved exports over the past year boosted hard currency reserves , allowing easy servicing of a $ 1.7-billion foreign debt . One negative : Slovenia remains burdened by some antiquated heavy industries , such_as steelmaking , which economists say should have been closed before privatization began . Losing enterprises are likely to be a drag_on the development fund to which shares left over from public offerings are to be allotted . STRATEGY : Slovenia ' s small size -- just under 2 million people -- is one of its biggest advantages . &quot; Even if we increase exports to Germany by 50 % , this is such a small part of a big market that no one is going_to worry too_much &quot; and impose trade_protections , says economist Joze Mencinger , a former finance_minister . One issue of concern to potential investors is the unresolved distribution of $ 3 billion in loans to the former Yugoslavia . Commercial lenders have been pushing for Slovenia to shoulder the entire burden , as it is the only Yugoslav successor state paying its debts . But Ljubljana officials reject a formula that , in_effect , punishes its success , and they are still negotiating . While an unfavorable allotment of that debt could scuttle Slovenia ' s improvement trend , other factors make Slovenian companies potentially attractive . Wages remain low -- an average of $ 400 a month -- and workers are more disciplined than many Eastern Europeans . A collective_agreement reached between employers and employees in July has helped avoid strikes by taking workers into psychological partnership with management , keeping them abreast_of hard realities faced by their enterprises and motivated by the potential for profits many will share_in as a consequence of privatization .</TEXT>
