   <HEADLINE> PASSION_PLAY ; WILD FANS , CRAZED PLAYERS AND A NATION IN THRALL -- WHEN IT COMES TO FUTBOL MADNESS , NOBODY OUT-OBSESSES THE ARGENTINES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Buenos Aires is where Ford Falcons come_to die . The car that has all but disappeared from the United States is thriving here , gleaming in anachronistic chrome and shift-on-the-column obsolescence . They are used mostly as taxis , and in Argentina , no less than New York City , a taxi serves as a microcosm of culture and color , a mobile commentary booth on the world at_large . The driver warms_up with politics ; tango and pop_music are worth a passing comment . But Topic A is futbol . The driver angrily dissects the_Argentine national team ' s disappointing performance in World Cup qualifying . With each bitter description of a loss , the taxi swerves and seems to lash_out at other automobiles . For a decade and a half , Argentina has dominated the quadrennial World Cup , winning in 1978 and 1986 and finishing second in 1990 . But Argentina struggled during qualifying matches and was the last nation to make the 24-team tournament , which opens next week in Chicago and ends with the championship match on July 17 in the Rose Bowl . In the Falcon ' s front seat , a cigarette punctuates the commentary . &quot; Too_much defensive play. &quot; A stab toward the rearview_mirror . &quot; No one knows how to dribble the ball ! &quot; Smoke slaloms along the dashboard . &quot; Beaten by Colombia ! In Buenos Aires ! &quot; The driver ' s voice rises in outrage and the cigarette , mashed into a stub , gets flicked out the window . Argentina and Argentines are futbol crazy . In a country of 33 million people , more_than 6 million play regularly . The players from this South_American_country populate the best teams in Europe , the sport ' s premier locale . Men like Claudio Caniggia and Gabriel Batistuta are among the biggest of the big-money soccer stars . And in a sport renowned for fan devotion , Argentines are in a slightly scary class of_their_own . They ' ve all but institutionalized soccer hooliganism and even the most peaceful of fans blithely toss bottles and cherry_bombs and incendiary chants around the stadiums . Second place might as well not exist for an Argentine fan , and even a victory isn ' t good_enough unless it is accomplished with style and grace . All of which makes Argentina a case study in what the United States has been missing . Neither Pele , the great Brazilian star who played in the United States in the 1970s , nor a thriving network of amateur youth and adult leagues could overcome Americans ' well-known immunity to soccer fever . When the World Cup unfolds in nine U.S. cities over the next month , it will be this country ' s first real encounter with a sports passion that enthralls most of the world -- and that Argentina defines . In Buenos Aires , the cabby never lets_up his lament about his country ' s showing in the qualifying rounds . When he pulls to a stop at the_Argentine Football Association headquarters , he can ' t let this opportunity pass . He twists_around in his seat to send a message to Julio Grondona , the AFA president . A new cigarette is in one hand and the car ' s glowing lighter is in the other . &quot; Tell Grondona the team must do_well in the United States , &quot; he says , waving the lighter . &quot; We must reclaim our pride by winning the World Cup. &quot; THE FIRST SMOKE_BOMB EXPLODES just as the players from the preliminary game are dashing from the field . Noxious orange smoke billows from the projectile and follows the junior players . The crowd is pleased . From the stands , other noisy devices are set_off : M-80s , cherry_bombs and the odd homemade bomb . On this night , as two Buenos Aires-based teams , Racing and Ferro Carril Oeste , are about to face_off at Racing ' s stadium , security appears especially spotty : Although no glass is allowed , the field is already littered with broken bottles . The bottles occasionally fall_short and shatter on the concrete embankment surrounding the field -- it ' s a nice sound . In addition to the embankment , a moat and a 20-foot-high net keep the fans off the field . During the game , several spectators clamber up and hang there , suspended like spiders on a web . From March to August , twice a week , followers of soccer gather as disciples at the altars of their religion , Argentina ' s dozen or so state-of-the-art futbol stadiums . The carefully tended fields are used only for soccer , and only by the 20 teams of the country ' s First Division soccer league . The teams are sponsored by athletic clubs , some with tennis_courts , swimming_pools and other facilities , but whose prime purpose is to operate the teams . Each club and each stadium employ different methods for protecting players , coaches and officials as they go_on and off the field . At Racing ' s field , the players enter from underground , up through what resembles submarine hatches on the sideline . Racing ' s 11 starters trot onto the field , but the rest of the team hunkers behind a blue tarp designed to intercept the stray bottle or citrus . By the end of the first_half , the home crowd is in a fine mood as Racing produces two goals to Ferro Carril ' s none . The teams leave the field , each down its own hatch . Moments later , the referees and players from Ferro Carril re-emerge . It seems that the power to the visiting locker_room and the officials ' changing room has been shut_off . Strangely , there is no electrical problem in the home locker_room . The players from Ferro Carril encamp in the middle of the field . Fans view this development as an unexpected but welcome chance for target_practice . The players huddle closer and attempt to ignore the fusillade of debris glancing off the playing_field around them . Moments before the game is to resume , club officials announce that the power &quot; to the affected portions of the stadium &quot; has been restored . The second_half does not go well for Racing . One of its players removes his shirt and throws it to the fans in celebration of a goal -- a rule violation that results in the player ' s ejection . Racing will not be allowed to replace him and must play one man short . The fans , who had encouraged the player ' s display of devotion to them , now turn against him . Ferro Carril scores twice , and the game ends in a 2-2 tie . The fans storm out of the stadium but not away from it . They mill_around outside , discussing again and again the stupidity of the player , cursing him . A mob forms near the Racing locker_room . The team bus is parked nearby , and the swelling crowd rocks it , terrifying the driver . People shout at the players through windows that had been broken after some_other loss . &quot; You are a dead man ! &quot; is the general sentiment , which has been broadened now to include the entire team and the coaches . A couple of kids are hoisted up_to the windows to relay the crowd ' s curses , close range . A series of shots -- POP ! POP ! -- ring_out . Police have fired into the air in a vain attempt to disperse the crowd . Two hours after the game , a journalist for the Buenos Aires-based national newspaper Clarin emerges from the locker_room and works his way free_of the crush of fans . He is asked if the players will be coming_out soon . &quot; No , no , &quot; he says , glancing at the angry mob . &quot; They will not come_out . They know what is waiting for them. &quot; The bus_driver toots the horn , his stab at shooing_away the fans . Then he abandons the bus and fights his way to the locker_room . The door opens and he hurries inside . In the midst of the roiling and shouting crowd , a fan begins to sob , overcome by anger and frustration . His T-shirt reads : &quot; Racing . An inexplicable passion. &quot; None of the events that took_place after the game will merit so_much as a line in the journalist ' s report . Nothing unusual happened . SOCCER IS PLAYED EVERYWHERE IN ARGENTINA , BY EVERYONE , AT ALL times . At midday by shirt-sleeved businessmen on traffic medians and at night by children dodging parked cars under the glow of street lights . &quot; In Argentina , the first present for a boy is a soccer_ball . The father wants to see his son with a ball , playing football . It is a dream , &quot; says Pholo Toledo , assistant to Cesar Luis Menotti , coach of the popular professional team Boca Juniors and a former World Cup coach . &quot; It is unusual in the United States to see a boy kicking a ball . In our small_towns , the children play with a ball . If they don ' t have one , they play with a T-shirt or with paper , rocks , anything , everything . Most of the time they place two rocks on the ground . The space between them , that is the goal. &quot; In their dreams , those kids are playing in the big_leagues , on one of Argentina ' s First Division professional teams , where fame and fortune -- top club players make about $ 2 million a year -- await . There are many tiers to professional soccer in Argentina . The highest level is the First Division . Below that are the B Division and C Division , similar to baseball ' s minor_leagues . Many of the best Argentine players compete in the even more lucrative European professional leagues , returning to Argentina only for international matches or for the few weeks before the World Cup to prepare . The national coach , now Alfio Basile , works full time , at least until he ' s fallen_out of favor with the public -- or the_Argentine Football Association . The AFA headquarters occupy several floors of a turn-of-the-century office_building in downtown Buenos Aires . It is an important address , as befits the stature of the organization . The decor in the ornate wood-paneled offices -- with scores of trophies and cups and withered soccer_balls in glass cases -- is meant to leave the impression that this is one of Argentina ' s most important places . AFA president Grondona , with his desk full of telephones and a photograph of himself with the Pope , believes this . He ' s spent virtually all his adult life in the hierarchy of Argentine soccer . Before heading the AFA , he was the president of the nation ' s largest soccer and athletic club , Independiente . Interviews with Grondona are not so_much question - and - answer sessions as lectures punctuated by pauses in which questions may be offered , but also ignored . At this moment , he is losing patience explaining the unexplainable : &quot; Football is a sport which is passionate by nature . Do you know why ? All the sports where you use the hands are easier . Yes ? When you use your legs only . . . instead of sport , we can talk_about dance . This is the main point. &quot; Pause . Then , as if to underscore the capriciousness of his job as the country ' s top soccer administrator , the knife-edge risk of it , he adds , &quot; I think that the_Argentines have two faces , two different ways . When we win , it seems that we are gods . When we lose , we are good for nothing. &quot; Soccer was introduced to Argentina by British sailors who often played in Buenos Aires ' port area . In 1901 , British immigrants formed the River Plate team , and 12 years later , an Irishman and a handful of Italians assembled the Boca Juniors , the nemesis of River Plate . Their rivalry has long been marked by class divisions : The wealthy tend to identify with River , the much more numerous poor and working class with Boca . Native Argentines soon started their own teams and leagues eventually developed . The first World Cup , held_in Uruguay in 1930 , was an exercise in humiliation for Argentina : They lost in the championship game to Uruguay , their poorer neighbor . Another lackluster showing in 1934 prompted Argentina to withdraw from international soccer competition until 1958 . The national team grew increasingly strong , winning and hosting the World Cup in 1978 -- and drawing unwanted global attention on the repressive military junta that had come_to power in 1976 . Some critics , such_as Amnesty International , questioned the propriety of holding the world ' s single largest sporting event in a nation where kidnaping , torture and murder were common tools for silencing political opponents . The junta dismissed all criticism as &quot; Marxist plotting. &quot; Argentina spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade its infrastructure for the World Cup , including its antiquated mass communications_systems . The Federation Internationale de Football Association , world soccer ' s governing body , mandated that all games be televised in_color ; Argentina did not have color_TV in 1978 but nevertheless broadcast the games abroad in full color . Only inside Argentina did the matches appear in black_and_white . The Argentines were so hungry to host the World Cup that there was hardly_a stir when the minister of economics made the somewhat alarmist announcement that projected costs were off by as much as $ 750 million . Government officials would hardly be concerned about the costs of staging the tournament , since , to them , the ends more_than justified the means : The exhilaration of winning the World Cup had the desired effect of numbing the populace . The junta probably gained a year or two ' s grace out of the soccer team ' s victory . The drain of money and resources aside , some of the_Argentine intelligentsia were disgusted that the ruling junta had skillfully equated excitement about the event with satisfaction with the government . During the tournament , the great writer Jorge Luis Borges reflected : &quot; The fact that a game , and a commercial one at that , should be promoted to the rank of holy war , passes my understanding . I am a fervent patriot and , I hope , a good citizen , but I emphatically do not hold the uncanonical belief , now voiced by the press , and by the radio , of salvation through football . . . . I abhor or hate Communists , Nationalists and Fascists impartially , and I think the cult of football is hardly_a remedy for these ailments. &quot; But soccer in Argentina had always thrived independent of politics , notes Julio Cesar Pasquato , who writes for the sports magazine El Grafico under the name of Juvenal . &quot; There were two paths -- one for the country and one for football , &quot; he said . &quot; They were parallel but they never crossed . The decade of the ' 40s was wonderful for football . It was a coincidence that ( dictator Juan ) Peron was the president . The decade of the ' 70s was a military dictatorship , a terrible tyranny , but the soccer was wonderful . Nobody can explain it. &quot; This is the difficulty of understanding the_Argentine passion for soccer : No one can explain it , but they all feel it . Interviewing soccer fans does not evoke great insight . The sport is such a part of the fabric of life in Argentina that few think to stop and reflect on its meaning . For the poor and working class , though , futbol is a special love . &quot; There is passion for football everywhere in South_America . There ' s also a lot of poverty , &quot; says Eric Weil , sports editor of the Buenos Aires Herald . &quot; All they live for , all they can be interested in , is football . that ' s their life . that ' s their passion . It gives them something to hang_on to , something to live for. &quot; ARGENTINE SOCCER CLUBS CAN BE HUGE -- BOCA JUNIORS HAS ABOUT 70 # 000 members -- and each one has a small but dangerous group of fanatic supporters . In Europe , these extremists would be called hooligans , but here they are known as the barra brava -- the group of the brave . What 15 years ago began as obnoxious behavior and loud singing from the barra brava has today degenerated into violence , threats and extortion carried_out on local businesses . At most clubs , it is an accepted practice for players to buy their own safety by &quot; donating &quot; money to the barra brava . Boca Juniors ' barra brava -- only a_few hundred strong -- is perhaps the most feared and most organized in the country . It has established a group called the Foundation of the 12th Player , which , according to published reports , receives up_to $ 10 # 000 month from the players and a total of $ 80 # 000 a month from other sources . The money goes_into the pockets of the leaders of the &quot; foundation. &quot; Boca ' s barra brava is out_in force when the team meets its archrival , River Plate , in a tournament in Mendoza , along the Andean border with Chile . Mendoza ' s stadium is a simple bowl made of concrete and seems to have been dropped into a stand of poplar_trees . Two hours before the game starts the stands are already half-filled . Directly behind the goal , in a sea of blue and yellow shirts , is a swath of beige -- the bare chests of Boca ' s barra brava . Later , when nearly all_of the 47 # 000 fans have arrived , the crowd ignores the ragged drill team and flag girls the organizers provide expressly to calm them . Light whistling cascades_down on the entertainers , who have been marching stoically around the field . The singing of the rival fan groups has long since drowned out the chirpy tune played over the public_address_system and , mercifully , the entertainers are hustled off the field and the teams trot on . Here , as in every stadium in Argentina , rival barra bravas buy seats at opposite ends of the field . This arrangement keeps them physically at_bay but does not quell the volatile verbal confrontations : the incessant singing . The songs are sometimes clever , they are often profane , they are always insulting and sung at full-lung bellow throughout the game . Nothing escapes the derision of the fans . When Boca scores , their fans taunt River Plate from across the stadium : &quot; A moment of silence because River is dead . Cry , River , cry ! &quot; The next time Boca players are at River ' s end of the field , a flare is heaved on the field . Play is halted while the flare burns itself out . When the teams change sides after the half , each opposing goalkeeper will be exposed to rival fans . River fans pelt Boca ' s keeper with oranges and Boca ' s supporters throw plastic water_bottles at River ' s goalkeeper . Ignored on the stadium ' s scoreboard is the message : &quot; Please don ' t throw projectiles. &quot; Tournament organizers are serious about preempting any organized trouble . The seating_area behind each goal is outlined in cyclone fencing topped with razor wire . Outside of the fences stands a line of young soldiers , each with a holstered side-arm and a baton or stick . Here , a week before , there had been trouble . Provincial police stopped buses filled with barra bravas at a checkpoint outside town . A gun battle ensued with 17 people wounded and 190 fans taken_to jail . Asked if working_at a soccer game is considered hazardous duty , one of the blue-uniformed soldiers rolls his eyes at such an obvious question . &quot; Quite , &quot; he says , and goes_back to watching the fans through the fence . &quot; I see something . It ' s a wonderful thing . It ' s Boca , Boca ! &quot; With each new song , usually sung to the tune of a popular hit , the fans erupt into a mass of noisy movement . Boca scores again . The player takes_off and dashes to face his fans , who strain toward him . River ' s fans come_to_life and begin a derisive chant about their own coach . Each team scores a goal and the game is over . Boca wins , 3-1 . Security personnel herd the fans_out the exits . On the field , police_dogs strain against their leashes . As the River end of the stadium empties , the fans leave_behind their traditional calling_card after a loss -- they have set fire to everything combustible . Dozens of small fires flicker . Outside the stadium , Boca fans begin singing and gather for their long march into town . It is nearly 1 in the morning -- time for dinner . Boca and River make_up the country ' s most serious rivalry , and when they met again last month , the rivalry flared into tragedy after River scored a rare win on Boca ' s home field . After the game , six people were shot and two died in fighting between rival fan groups . IN MANY WAYS , DIEGO ARMANDO Maradona , a former street_urchin from the grungy town of Fiorito , is a metaphor for the lunacy that is Argentine soccer . Maradona was a soccer prodigy . He was already performing dribbling and ball-juggling feats at age 10 , began his professional career at 15 and the next year represented his country in his first international match . At 17 , he was the last player cut from the 1978 World Cup team . He played for Argentina in the 1982 Cup , but was sent_off the field in the closing moments of a losing game after kicking an opponent in the stomach . His temper had yet to be tamed . His maturation as a player came quickly after that . No player in the history of the game has dominated a World Cup as Maradona did_in 1986 . His most spectacular moment came_on a predictably emotional stage : The quarterfinal match between Argentina and England . It was the first time their soccer teams had faced each other since the 1982 Falklands war and emotions were boiling : British fans rival the_Argentines in belligerence . The game was played amid high security at 114 # 000-seat Azteca Stadium in Mexico_City . After a scoreless first_half , Maradona began a penetrating attack , dribbling into England ' s penalty area . His dangerous run was halted when a defender stripped the ball and lofted it toward the goal and the safekeeping of English goalie Peter Shilton . Shilton never got_it . Maradona darted toward the goal , leaped high , intercepted the ball in the air and deftly knocked it into the goal with his head . Or so it appeared . The English protested that Maradona had hit the ball with his hand -- highly illegal in soccer . The referee didn ' t agree and the goal stood . Only later , after careful analysis of the televised replays , did_it become obvious that Maradona had in fact punched the ball . Maradona never acknowledged the foul , saying only that if there was a hand involved , it was &quot; The hand of God. &quot; And so the goal has forever been named . Maradona ' s career has been characterized by acclaim and controversy of operatic proportions . He is known as a master ball handler and a bold , creative strategist who , like a chess_player , plans several moves ahead . He has no qualms about putting his body in harm ' s way . In 1984 , the diminutive midfielder went from the Spanish club Barcelona to Napoli in Italy for the then-record transfer fee of $ 10 million . Maradona ' s salary was to be $ 2 million a year , making him one of the world ' s highest-paid athletes . He began his career in Naples by reporting to preseason training camp one month late . Maradona flourished in Italy in all_the wrong ways : He loved the women -- and was hit with a paternity suit . He loved the food -- he gained weight and was fined by his club . He loved the climate -- he refused to train with the team , preferring to lounge with his entourage at his villa . Other players in the league referred to him as &quot; that tub of lard. &quot; Some thought his marriage in 1989 to Claudia Villafane , his longtime sweetheart and the mother of his two daughters , was a sign that the bad boy was maturing . Those signs faded , however , as the wedding plans grew absurdly . Maradona chartered a 747 to shuttle pals from Italy to Buenos Aires and rented a basketball arena to hold the reception for more_than 1 # 000 guests . The tab : more_than $ 3 million . The groom wore black and punched_out a photographer before the service . The 1990 World Cup in Italy was to be Maradona ' s glittering stage . He was at the height of his skills , the captain of a strong Argentine team that was the defending champion and would be playing in front of fans in Naples , his adopted city , where he is known simply as &quot; The King. &quot; With characteristic bravado , Maradona said of the championship trophy : &quot; Those who want it are going_to have to tear the World Cup from inside Argentina ' s heart. &quot; But he spent the tournament picking himself up off the field after incessant fouls , his opponents ' strategy being , if you can ' t beat him , beat him . Maradona was the most fouled player in the tournament and played with a grotesquely swollen left ankle that needed painkilling injections before each match . Nevertheless , Argentina advanced . The final , one of the ugliest , most mean-spirited games ever played in the World Cup , was marked by frequent fouling and brutal play , atypical of a sport where grace and finesse are prized . West Germany won , 1-0 , on a controversial penalty kick , and Maradona insulted his adopted country by saying the whole tournament had been tainted by &quot; Mafia influence. &quot; Maradona returned to his Italian club team after the World Cup . In 1991 , during routine post-match testing , he came_up positive for cocaine . FIFA suspended Maradona for 15 months . He returned to Buenos Aires , declared his intention to retire and entered a drug treatment program . Not much later , he was briefly held_on drug charges after a police raid . After serving his suspension , Maradona un-retired to play for Sevilla in Spain but was fired after various offenses , the worst being the alarming deterioration of his skills . Again he returned to Argentina , where he joined a club called Newell ' s Old_Boys . Four months later , in February , he was sacked for skipping practices and the media staked out his five-acre estate in suburban Buenos Aires . That so enraged Maradona that he grabbed a compressed-air rifle and sprayed pellets at journalists . Five of them were slightly injured . Five days after that , Maradona smashed a camera into the face of a photographer . And the troubles continued . Last month , Maradona was barred from entering Japan for a World Cup tuneup match because of his drug history . The entire team refused to play and , in Buenos Aires , fans exploded a bomb in front of the Japanese Consulate . &quot; Maradona is still popular , &quot; says Weil of the Buenos Aires Herald , &quot; but there are more and more people saying he ' s crazy and he needs treatment . But this is a football country and he ' s done a lot for Argentina . Even now , lots of people feel sorry_for him. &quot; Maradona is virtually certain to be named to Argentina ' s World Cup team , but no one expects him to perform as well as he has in the past ; some doubt that he will even play . But his presence alone will lend the World Cup a measure of dash and danger that the sport thrives on . EVERY FOUR YEARS , ARGENTINES REAFFIRM their love for their national team . But in this year ' s World Cup qualifying , the bond was tested by the team ' s overreaching arrogance . In one humbling week in late August , Argentina played to a 0-0 tie with lowly Paraguay and lost , 5-0 , to Colombia . The worst part : Both games were played in Buenos Aires . The team failed to qualify outright in its South_American group but there was another , longer road . Argentina would play Australia , the winner of the Oceania qualifying group , for the last berth in the World Cup_finals . The first game ended 1-1 in Sydney . The decisive game was played in River Plate Stadium in Buenos Aires in November . Argentina dominated but could not score . It began to look_like another disaster . The Argentine team got the winning goal , but it was inadvertently scored by an Australian defender . This is what is known as an &quot; own goal , &quot; unsatisfying , yes , but a goal still , and Argentina was through to the World Cup_finals . Despite its struggle during qualifying , Argentina , along with perennial favorites Italy , Germany , Brazil and Holland , should be in the running for the Cup . The challenge will be to jell as a team and for Basile to merge his squad ' s natural inclination to attack with his own more conservative philosophy . Argentina will be playing in a group with some of the tournament ' s weakest contenders , Greece , Nigeria and Bulgaria . Argentina will play two games in Boston and one in Dallas in the first round , with the most difficult of those matches coming against Nigeria on June 25 . If , as expected , Argentina wins its group , it will stay in Boston for the second round . For the emotional Argentines , the U.S. World Cup holds one challenge that they have never faced before : Will the passion and tumult that the team thrives on greet them here ? And if not , can soccer ' s great performers spin their magic in a vacuum ? Are the crowd and the noise and the danger necessary parts of the recipe ? Julio Cesar Pasquato of El Grafico has covered nine World Cups and admits to being concerned about that aspect of this summer ' s games . He shakes his head over the fact that the United States is hosting the world ' s greatest sports spectacle without sharing the world ' s mania for the game . What will it be like ? &quot; It is a difficult question for an Argentine because we can ' t separate football from passion , &quot; says Pasquato . &quot; Football is a feeling . I can ' t imagine that : no passion in a stadium . The magic of football is the quality and intelligence of the players , their love of football . If all that happens in the middle of silence -- I don ' t know . How can I feel in that case ? It is difficult to know how to feel in the sound of silence. &quot;</TEXT>
