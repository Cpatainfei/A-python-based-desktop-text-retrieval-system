   <HEADLINE> APOCALYPSE NOW ? ; TED DANIELS CHRONICLES A HOST OF PREDICTIONS OF DOOMSDAY IN HIS NEWSLETTER . AS THE MILLENNIUM NEARS , HE CAN HARDLY KEEP UP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s Millennium Time , and Doomsday Man ( a.k.a. Ted Daniels ) is busy sifting through predictions about the end of the world : * Elderly Nazis hiding beneath the South_Pole are plotting to take_over the planet with help from space aliens . * A monster quake , due by 1997 , will make Phoenix a seaport , split the continent in two and cough_up Atlantis from the depths . * Jesus_Christ will return this month . ( And if he doesn ' t , at least six other messiahs are already roaming the globe , biding their time until Judgment Day. ) These and other forecasts are printed in Millennial Prophecy Report , a 10-times-a-year newsletter that tracks 1 # 100 groups that believe the apocalypse is at_hand . Daniels , who founded the newsletter two years ago , says the glut of &quot; propheteering &quot; is inspired by anxiety about the year 2000 . &quot; It ' s like when the odometer ticks over in your car . . . ( but ) on a global scale , &quot; he explains . &quot; I talked to one guy who videotaped his car turning_over to 100 # 000 miles . If it ' s that important when your car does_it , imagine what it ' s like for the planet . . . . It ' s gotta have meaning , right ? &quot; Daniels , 55 , decided to chronicle the phenomenon . A folklore scholar by training , he works_out of a cluttered office at the top of his Philadelphia home . There , a fiery-winged wooden mermaid floats under the ceiling , African masks peer from the walls and an eerie , carved New England church with flames shooting out the windows looms over various stacks of books , magazines and papers . Each week , a two-foot pile of prophecies and prognostications arrives in the mail . The bulk of it is from fringe Christian ministries , flying saucer freaks and Sedona , Ariz . -- &quot; the Vatican_City of the New Age movement , &quot; Daniels says . Despite the philosophical disparities among such groups , Daniels sees a_few common threads . Almost without exception , he says , they focus_on a prophecy in which some sort of divine or cosmic power wipes_out world evil and ushers_in an era of peace and beauty . Christian soothsayers , for example , typically describe a cataclysmic battle between good and evil , followed by the reign of Christ . Several New Age seers theorize that a &quot; parallel planet &quot; is headed toward Earth and that enlightened humans will be able to jump ship and live_in harmony on the new_world . One UFO group , meanwhile , believes the Earth is about to enter a galactic &quot; photon belt , &quot; which will blot_out the sun and cause a 3 1 / 2-day worldwide electrical blackout ( akin to the 3 1 / 2-year tribulation foretold in the New Testament ' s Book of Revelations ) . During that time , space-alien troops will invade to &quot; cleanse the planet , &quot; and believers are to stay indoors and not look outside . In the last prediction , Daniels sees a space-age recapitulation of the Old_Testament Passover story , in which Jews were able to avoid the angel of death by staying in their homes and sprinkling lamb ' s blood on their door posts . Indeed , Daniels regards the space creatures who show_up in many end-time predictions as nothing more_than &quot; angels and demons given a high-tech dressing. &quot; In that sense , they are nothing new . History , it seems , is_full of unusual doomsday forecasts . Early church_father Hippolytus , for instance , analyzed the dimensions of Noah ' s Ark to calculate that the world would terminate in AD 500 , according to author Russell Chandler ' s &quot; Doomsday &quot; ( Servant Publications , 1993 ) , a historical overview of apocalyptic predictions . Explorer Christopher Columbus , on the other hand , declared himself a messianic figure in 1501 and said the planet would expire in 1656 , Chandler writes . Meanwhile , in France , Nostradamus scheduled Armageddon for 1999 , reportedly hinting that it would begin with a Chinese submarine invasion of Italy . Other students of The End , according to &quot; Doomsday , &quot; include Joseph Goebbels , Jehovah ' s Witnesses ( with no fewer than seven incorrect predictions ) and members of the &quot; yeller ' s sect , &quot; who interpret a Bible verse about Jesus returning with a shout as meaning that they must go_around constantly screaming his name to spark Armageddon . Prominent evangelists have also dabbled_in what one Christian author calls &quot; Last_Days Madness. &quot; Chuck Smith , pastor of Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa , once predicted that Jesus would return by 1981 , and broadcaster Pat Robertson flatly guaranteed that The End would begin in 1982 with a Russian invasion of Israel , says Chandler , a former religion reporter for The Times . There also is Salem Kirban , a self-styled Armageddon expert who in 1981 advertised the nation ' s &quot; first toll-free prophecy hot_line , &quot; and who believes that killer_bees fulfill biblical predictions for a plague of locusts in the last_days . ( In contrast , end-times evangelist Hal Lindsey , a former Mississippi_River tugboat captain whose &quot; Late Great Planet Earth &quot; was the best-selling nonfiction book of the 1970s , sees the locusts as nuclear missiles launched from space_platforms or Cobra helicopters spraying nerve_gas , Chandler ' s book notes. ) * Millennial fever isn ' t solely driven by the calendar . It can flare during any period of &quot; intense and rapid social change , &quot; Daniels says . And it feeds off deep-rooted cultural , psychological and religious images . &quot; Everybody has a creation myth , &quot; he explains . &quot; Without fail , those stories begin in Paradise and then -- through accident , sin or ( some_other circumstance ) -- the world changes to what it is now . . . . Under the right conditions , people are desperately going_to try to find a way to get_back to that Paradise. &quot; Just before the turn_of_the_century , for instance , a Paiute ranch_hand known as the Indian Jesus had a revelation in which God restored the buffalo herds , revived dead Indian ancestors and destroyed white settlers ( except -- conveniently -- for their carbines and ponies ) . In similar fashion , New Hampshire doomsdayer Gordon-Michael Scallion predicts that a superquake will soon sink California , raise Atlantis , rip the continent in half and cause the United States to revert to a peaceful , 13-colony government . &quot; What Scallion is picking_up on , &quot; Daniels says , &quot; is a very prevalent and underground mistrust . . . ( and ) hatred of the federal_government -- its arrogance , its unapproachability , its being completely beyond our influence. &quot; Scallion is one of Daniels ' favorite subjects , partly because of the seer ' s intriguing political predictions , but also because he is one of the few forecasters who admits to mistakes ( the quake was supposed to happen a_few months ago , but now has been rescheduled for sometime before 1997 ) . Other forecasters of note : Harold Camping , an Oakland radio evangelist who has disturbed many fellow Christians with predictions that Jesus will return this month , and &quot; the Hollow Earth people , &quot; who believe leftover Nazis from World_War_II are hiding in secret , subterranean cities , accessible only through a passageway allegedly discovered by antarctic explorer Adm . Richard Byrd . The Nazis are said to be procreating like mad in preparation for a doomsday offensive that will be joined by UFO allies . Not surprisingly , Daniels -- a former agnostic who is &quot; coming_around &quot; to believe_in &quot; an intelligence in the universe &quot; -- places no faith in these or any other predictions printed in his newsletter . It ' s purely an academic interest , he says . Millennial Prophecy Report is intended as a reference for scholars , journalists and law_enforcement agents dealing with such sects as the Branch Davidians of Waco , Tex . ( a group that had eluded Daniels ' attention until the siege ) . So far , Daniels has had better luck finding Armageddon prophets -- more_than 1 # 000 in the United States alone -- than subscribers , about 200 . that ' s partly because of poor publicity , a situation he hopes to remedy with an advertising blitz ; but also partly because the eight-page newsletters contain little more_than verbatim excerpts of often incomprehensible prophecies . It can make_for tedious reading . Daniels acknowledges that even he doesn ' t understand a lot of the material he prints . He calls it a crazy_quilt of pseudo-quantum physics , the Heisenberg Principle and &quot; shameless borrowing from any and all religions. &quot; But he believes the people who produce the prognostications are sincere . The career pattern of most prophets , he says , is remarkably similar : &quot; The ( person ) begins his , or -- more often -- her life on the margins of society . She doesn ' t fit_in , in some way or another . She could be very sick , or poor or doesn ' t know who her parents are . . . . Then , at some point , she undergoes a major crisis , ( such_as losing ) a close relative or ( having ) a near-death experience . . . and ( receives ) a vision of the future and of heaven. &quot; Prophets in centuries past used to see hell also , Daniels adds , &quot; but that ' s gone_off the map now . . . a reflection of cultural influence on visions. &quot; In any case , the prophet emerges from this experience utterly transformed , he says : &quot; No longer a nebbish , he or she now possesses tremendous sexual attractiveness and confidence . If they were_sick , they are healed . . . . And there is an ability to perform miracles , ( such_as ) faith healing. &quot; As an example , Daniels cites a Jewish-born Florida travel_agent whose business hit the skids and who then had a vision of herself in Christ ' s tomb at the moment the stone was being rolled away . She heard a voice instructing her to believe_in the Second Coming but answered : &quot; I can only believe_in the First Coming . I ' m a Jew. &quot; The voice , however , was ultimately convincing , and the woman now leads a New Age_group in Ft . Lauderdale , Fla. , that believes humans must make &quot; an evolutionary leap to a new spiritual dimension , &quot; Daniels says . Such claims are proliferating as the year 2000 draws nigh . The current outbreak of end-of-the-world Angst may , in fact , be unprecedented . The late psychic Edgar Cayce foresaw a &quot; shifting of the poles &quot; in 2000-2001 , says &quot; Doomsday , &quot; and the live psychic Jeane Dixon has predicted a 1999 holocaust followed by an era of peace . The list goes_on . Environmentalists warn of eco-disasters . Astronomers fret about comet collisions . And evangelical Christians have turned Armageddon into a cottage industry . &quot; The millennium , &quot; Daniels says , &quot; is a hot property. &quot; So hot that he even had to change the name of his newsletter -- originally titled Millennium Watch -- after a New Age_group threatened to sue . &quot; They claimed to have exclusive commercial rights to the word millennium , &quot; he says . &quot; Imagine a New Age_group claiming exclusive_rights to an ancient Christian concept. &quot; Actually , everyone seems to be_after a piece of the millennium . Arcade games , comic_books , movies and music are loaded with apocalyptic imagery , says Daniels , who wishes he could expand the scope of his newsletter to keep tabs on it all . Even limited to his current focus , however , he sees years of work ahead . Unless one of the doomsday forecasts turns_out to be right , he figures , the fascination with The End is barely beginning : &quot; If I wanted to , I think I could still be publishing 20 years from now. &quot;</TEXT>
