   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; SARAJEVO ULTIMATUM NOT END OF CLINTON ' S POLITICAL QUAGMIRE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For President Clinton , the apparent decision by the Bosnian Serbs to accept a NATO ultimatum and remove their heavy guns from Sarajevo will not resolve a long-term political dilemma he has struggled with for more_than a year . The current hopes for relief of the besieged capital might easily be dashed by a last-minute explosion in that volatile land . But even if the Serbs fulfill their commitment , Clinton ' s prominent role in_forcing a reluctant Western alliance to deliver its ultimatum has raised the profile of American involvement in the intractable conflict and made backing_away from future crises more difficult . As leader of the world ' s sole remaining superpower , the President still confronts the challenge of using the strife-torn Balkans as a crucible in which to fashion a post-Cold War formula for dealing with foreign crises . And he must achieve this without plunging the nation into a Vietnam-style quagmire that would wreck the activist domestic agenda he is committed to fulfilling . Whatever happens in Sarajevo in the days just ahead , the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina will not be over . At its best , the local truce demanded by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization would fall far short of resolving the deep-rooted conflicts that have been tearing_apart the former Yugoslav federation for some two years . And the apparently unilateral decision by Moscow to send a contingent of Russian troops into the Sarajevo area only complicates the problem . It is equally clear that as long as the threat of violence hangs over Bosnia , the demands from European allies and influential cohorts in this country for greater U.S. involvement will not cease . In fact , the United States is already at least theoretically committed to sending ground forces to the area to help maintain a U.N. peacekeeping force , although some analysts say the conditions for U.S. participation are so stringent that this may never come_to pass . &quot; That would be a huge mistake , &quot; Larry DiRita , a Heritage Foundation specialist on defense and foreign_policy , said of the plan to dispatch about a division of U.S. forces to help patrol a partitioned Bosnia . &quot; He ( Clinton ) sets himself up for the Republicans to say in 1996 , ' Look , he ' s got a division bogged down in the Balkans. ' &quot; In trying to play a constructive part in the Bosnian crisis , Clinton must contend not only with the murderous religious and ethnic rivalries of the Balkans but with the relative indifference of most Americans to the violent upheaval abroad . &quot; In foreign affairs , only two kinds of things matter_to most Americans enough to be politically significant -- a great success or a great defeat , &quot; American University presidential scholar Alan J . Lichtman said . As Lichtman sees it , the chances of Clinton achieving a great success in Bosnia are slim , &quot; so the best he can hope for is to avoid a major defeat. &quot; How did Clinton get himself into such a pickle ? Part of the answer is the new complications in international relations -- the penalty the United States and the West are paying_for prevailing over communism . &quot; We no longer have a clear Cold_War framework to guide people ' s thinking , &quot; says Stanley Greenberg , Clinton ' s campaign pollster who continues to advise the White_House on political strategy . Clinton ' s predecessor , George_Bush , also had to cope_with this lack of public focus in dealing with the first post-Cold War international crisis , in the Persian_Gulf . But Bush ' s task was easier because Iraq had committed a clear act of aggression by seizing Kuwait and because the Middle_East with its oil supplies has long been considered vital to U.S. security . By contrast , Clinton faces the challenge of finding a convincing justification for American involvement in a civil_war being waged in a corner of the world best known to Americans only as the powder_keg that set_off World_War I . &quot; When you could make the case there was a global Communist threat , you could justify sending 500 # 000 men to Vietnam , &quot; public-opinion analyst Ben Wattenberg said . &quot; But you can ' t justify sending 500 # 000 men to Bosnia and take 200 casualties a week. &quot; Clinton also has himself to blame for his present conundrum , most analysts feel , because of his 1992 campaign criticism of Bush for not taking harsher measures against the Serbs . Clinton ' s comments built_up expectations for his own performance . &quot; He was obsessed by the fact that he was not in_service during Vietnam and he wanted to look tough , &quot; says Ted Van Dyk , a longtime policy adviser to Democratic presidential candidates who remembers hiring a young Bill_Clinton to work as an organizer for George McGovern ' s 1972 Democratic presidential campaign . Relatively small but highly influential groups that support an activist U.S. role in the world in_general and Bosnia in particular have not let the President forget his tough rhetoric . Their voices are raised in both parties and across the philosophical spectrum . &quot; I believe that we have both profound humanitarian and strategic concerns in Bosnia , &quot; Jeane J . Kirkpatrick , who was President Ronald Reagan ' s ambassador to the United Nations , said in a telephone_interview . &quot; It is a function of presidential leadership to do what needs to be done and explain that to the people , and people will respond positively. &quot; From another corner of the ideological street , Andrew Sullivan , editor of the relatively liberal and normally Democratic magazine New Republic , denounced Clinton ' s &quot; dilatory , casuistic response to the Great Crime in the Balkans. &quot; Sullivan accused Clinton of &quot; transforming the only superpower in the world into the only abdicating superpower in the world. &quot; Whatever the merits of their cause , many of those who seek to stir outrage over the bloodshed in Bosnia make a strong appeal_to the emotions . Benetton , the Italian clothing company known for its promotion of social activism , ran a double-page ad in the Washington Post this week as part of a worldwide campaign ; it depicted the blood-soaked clothes of a Bosnian soldier killed in battle along with a message from the soldier ' s father urging that his son ' s death be used &quot; in the name of peace and against war. &quot; Clinton is finding it hard to hold his own against such arguments , despite the &quot; bully pulpit &quot; of his office . &quot; Clinton has tried every which way to avoid risks in foreign_policy , &quot; says Bert Rockman , a University of Pittsburgh presidential scholar . &quot; But he is discovering that in situations where the highly attentive opinion makers find inaction intolerable , he can ' t afford not to do anything. &quot; Even Clinton supporters say that to have more impact on the public_debate , the President needs to do a better job of articulating the U.S. position on Bosnia . &quot; By going_to the American people and stating what the mission here ( in Bosnia ) is , &quot; Clinton &quot; would put Americans at_ease . . . make himself less a target of Republicans . . . ( and ) send a message to the Serbs and to the world , &quot; Delaware Sen . Joseph R . Biden Jr. , ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , told reporters this week . And some advocates of an active U.S. role in Bosnia contend that the cautious approach favored by Clinton might be the most dangerous in the long_run . &quot; A president ' s first responsibility is to keep the country safe and secure , &quot; said American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Joshua Muravchik , foreign_policy adviser to Clinton ' s campaign . &quot; If people get the feeling that this President is not competent at this No . 1 task , and other problems come_up , such_as the rise of a new dictatorship in Russia , then his inaction in Bosnia becomes not just a negative but a fatal weakness. &quot;</TEXT>
