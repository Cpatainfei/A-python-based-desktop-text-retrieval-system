   <TEXT> The family was seated around the table , hungry for dinner but even hungrier for a conversational breakthrough . Our 20-month-old son Christopher was_on the verge of speaking his first complete sentence , and it seemed inevitable that he would utter it during the spirited confusion that is mealtime . It didn ' t take long . &quot; I . . . &quot; he began , grabbing his plate of vegetables and potatoes . &quot; want . . . &quot; Oh my God , he ' s going_to do_it . &quot; Coke ! &quot; What ? &quot; I want chips , &quot; he added earnestly with a smile . &quot; I want cookies. &quot; My wife and I crumbled . After feeding our three children what we thought was a well-balanced diet with occasional snacks , our son ' s vocabulary sounded like a primer for a junk-food junkie . There was no denying it . We swore we never would , but we had become slaves to convenience . Apparently , we were not alone . Experts say that helping children cultivate good eating habits in today ' s fast-paced , fast-food world can be difficult for even the most conscientious mothers and fathers . But they stress that it ' s an achievable goal that can lay the groundwork for good_health and a lifetime of knowledgeable food choices . &quot; It ' s important to provide a good foundation , to educate children early , &quot; said Amy Pearson , chief clinical dietitian at Granada Hills Community Hospital . &quot; They may deviate from what they ' ve been taught as they become teen-agers and get_out on_their_own , but they usually fall_back on what they knew as a kid. &quot; Parents who practice good eating habits themselves are apt to see their children do the same . And it is never too early to set an example . &quot; The most important thing a parent can do is sit_down with their children so they can all eat a meal together , &quot; said Marla Dishman , an Encino-based dietitian . &quot; that ' s probably more important than what food is being served . Because , in_general , for kids to develop good eating habits , they need models. &quot; They also need protein , vitamins and all_the other good things that come from eating healthy foods . But as most parents know , what looks great on the nutritional chart doesn ' t always appear -- or taste -- as good to children when it ' s on their plate . I once tried convincing my 4-year-old daughter Casey to sample some of the eggplant sandwich I was eating . &quot; It ' s good_for_you , &quot; I insisted . &quot; Just a bite . Just one bite. &quot; After a tearful half-hour she relented . One nibble and one murderous expression later she splattered my shirt with the tomato sauce-covered sandwich . Lesson : Fighting kids over food is no fun . Neither is it productive . Respect a child ' s ability to choose . &quot; If you want to be very forceful and make them eat , they ' re either going_to throw it up or sit there and cry_for an hour , &quot; said Eileen Zelig of Chatsworth , who has three children . &quot; You have to remember , it ' s their body and their mouth . If you don ' t let them make the little choices now , they are not going_to be able to make bigger choices when they are teen-agers. &quot; Experts confirm this conclusion . Whether it ' s a very fussy eater , or simply a youngster exercising control in a normal phase of development , pediatricians and dietitians say parents should not coerce children to eat a particular food . An overly restrictive approach can be as destructive in the long_run as allowing children to eat anything they want , anytime they want it . And occasional , or even regular , trips to a fast-food restaurant will not spell doom . Moderation is the key . &quot; If my family can eat properly 80 % of the time , I consider that success , &quot; said Linda Vickers , a dietitian and mother of three who teaches nutrition classes at Moorpark College . &quot; If the other 20 % is spent at McDonald ' s , Taco Bell or whatever , that ' s OK . This is reality. &quot; Vickers and others say unrealistic parental expectations can often lead to unhealthy turmoil at mealtime . Parents , of course , should introduce new foods to their children , but neither fret nor fly off the handle if the offering is rejected . Dr. Steven Nishibayashi , a Glendale pediatrician , agrees : &quot; Just because they don ' t take it one time , doesn ' t mean they won ' t like it forever. &quot; Dishman suggests that parents adopt a policy that allows children to try one bite of a new food . If they like it , great . If they don ' t , no problem . Reintroduce it another time . Also , take time to view food from a child ' s perspective . &quot; Instead of canned , slimy fruit or vegetables , most kids prefer foods that are hard and crunchy , &quot; she said . &quot; Something they can pick_up , hold_in their hands and carry around. &quot; To that end , make_good foods available and accessible during meals and as snacks . Keep bananas on the countertop , and grapes , sliced oranges , apples and other fresh fruit in the refrigerator . Snap_peas , celery and carrot_sticks are crunchy , ready-to-eat vegetables . And , don ' t be afraid to be creative . &quot; My children refused to eat broccoli the first time I cooked it , &quot; Zelig said . &quot; But one time we ordered from a Chinese take-out and they were saying , ' Oh , look_at the little green trees , the trees taste good , Mommy. ' Now they like broccoli. &quot; As in most matters related to raising children , different ages present different challenges . Children under 4 , for example , go_through several stages . &quot; They will pick food they like and will stick_with it , and then suddenly switch to something else , &quot; said dietitian Pearson . &quot; It ' s a normal part of the developmental process. &quot; The key is not to let the changes develop_into a matter of conflict . Parents concerned about their child ' s eating habits should talk to other parents . The problem is most likely a common one . If a child is losing or gaining a lot of weight , professional advice should be sought . But generally , most situations can be handled with patience . &quot; There will be times of good nutrition and times of not-so-good nutrition , &quot; Nishibayashi said . &quot; It all gets_back to parents setting good_examples . That will be as effective as anything else. &quot; With that thought in mind , I threw_out the case of soda that filled our refrigerator , cut_in half the stash of Oreos and swore_off jumbo-size bags of chips . During the last few months , producing smoothies has become an art_form in our household . Lots of fruit is cut_up and stored in the refrigerator . Each morning and afternoon , part of it is dropped into a blender with fruit_juice and ice , creating a healthy , refreshing snack -- for everyone . The kids can ' t guzzle enough . Now , if I can just find a way to work broccoli and cauliflower into the mix . . .</TEXT>
