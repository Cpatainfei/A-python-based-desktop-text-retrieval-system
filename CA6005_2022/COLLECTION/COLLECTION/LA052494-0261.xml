   <HEADLINE> 3 S . AFRICANS FREED IN BIEHL SLAYING CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three men accused of killing Amy Biehl , the Newport Beach woman slain by a mob of black youths in South_Africa last year , were freed Monday after posting $ 70 bail each , a development that left Biehl ' s relatives saddened and worried the crime will go unsolved . As court proceedings resumed Monday following a delay of about six weeks , the defendants walked_out_of the Cape_Town courthouse into a small group of cheering supporters and family members , who raised bail when a court_order prohibiting their release had expired . &quot; Personally , I didn ' t expect it to be a bail situation , but I ' m not surprised . I just never expected them to be actually prosecuted , &quot; said Kim Biehl , 28 , of Newport Beach , the sister of the slain Fulbright scholar . &quot; It ' s disappointing . We would all like to see some sort of justice served . Amy was a believer in justice. &quot; Biehl said she learned about the release early Monday morning from an Associated Press reporter who has been covering the case . Amy Biehl , 26 , who studied for a year at the predominantly black University of the Western Cape , was beaten and stabbed to death Aug . 25 while she was driving friends home to Guguletu , a township near Cape_Town . The attack occurred two days before her scheduled return to the United States . The Associated Press reported Monday that Mongezi Manqina , Mzikhona Nofemela and Vusumzi Ntamo were released after an attorney_general ' s order denying bail for the accused had lapsed . Prosecutor Nollie Niehaus did not oppose the setting of bail at about $ 70 each , a relatively small amount for a violent crime . &quot; I can ' t say it will be in the interest of justice to keep them in custody , &quot; Niehaus said . The men , who are from one of Cape_Town ' s poorest townships , were ordered to return to court on Aug . 15 . The defendants are members of the student wing of the Pan-Africanist Congress , a militant black group that has openly avowed attacks on &quot; settlers &quot; -- their term for whites . Groups of youthful PAC supporters have taunted white passersby during the court proceedings , which began in November . They often shouted their notorious slogan : &quot; One settler , one bullet. &quot; The Pan-Africanist Congress renounced armed struggle in January in_order to take_part in the historic all-race election in April . The party captured a modest 1.2 % of the national vote , less than any other party . The trial of the men was recently stalled for several weeks while Judge Gerald Friedman conducted a &quot; trial within a trial &quot; to decide whether the suspects ' statements should be admitted as evidence . Manquina has charged that he was beaten by police and forced to make a confession . Earlier in the case , charges were dropped against three suspects because a witness was afraid to testify , and a 15-year-old suspect who was not jailed never showed_up for his court appearance in November . Amy Biehl , who was researching the role of women in the transition to majority_rule , is believed to be the first American killed in South_Africa ' s political violence . A U.S. Department_of_State official declined to comment Monday on the defendants ' release , saying the department has not received any official communication from South_Africa concerning the Biehl case . Consul Jacques Jordaan , of the South_African Consulate in Los Angeles , said he sent a telex to South_Africa immediately after hearing reports about the release . The new South_African constitution , which came_into effect during the trial , stipulates that bail must be granted in all but extreme cases , Jordaan said . Biehl ' s parents spent Monday in Washington at a ceremony where their daughter , Molly , presented five awards to honor young social activists . The annual event is held by the Gleitsman Foundation . Amy Biehl was remembered at the event for the work she did on behalf of democratic ideals in South_Africa , said her father , Peter . &quot; We were feeling very inspired today . This sort of takes the steam out of it , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re extremely disappointed , but in the end , we were really not expecting convictions anyway. &quot; Peter Biehl said his family thought the prosecution was doomed even before Monday ' s release because many witnesses , some of them young children , have been threatened by supporters of the accused . Kim Biehl said she learned that one of the men was smiling as he emerged from the courthouse , but that the other two were subdued . She said she thought it was unlikely that they will show_up at the next court appearance , but she added that she harbors no hatred over her sister ' s murder . &quot; I can completely see how it happened . I do have some anger , but mostly it ' s just sadness , &quot; she said . &quot; There is an entire lost generation over there , just like we have in our country . . . . It was a mob scene and a mob situation , and I ' m just not sure that they have 100 % certainty that they have the right people. &quot; Several funds have been set_up in Amy Biehl ' s name to encourage the pursuit of democratic ideals in South_Africa and elsewhere , her father said . The latest is the Amy Biehl Foundation , which the family has established .</TEXT>
