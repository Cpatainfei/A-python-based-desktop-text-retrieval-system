   <HEADLINE> GATES SEES A WINDOW IN TRIO ' S NEW STUDIO ; ENTERTAINMENT : HEAD OF MICROSOFT EXPECTS TO DISCUSS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS WITH SPIELBERG ET AL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Microsoft Corp . Chairman Bill Gates said Wednesday that he will probably meet with Steven Spielberg and other media moguls who are setting_up a new Hollywood film studio to discuss how his software would fit into their vision . In an interview , Gates denied speculation that he has already discussed cooperating with Spielberg , former Walt Disney Studios head Jeffrey Katzenberg and music mogul David Geffen . The three announced plans to form their own studio last week . But Gates , the chairman of the world ' s largest software company , said he expects to discuss the application of Microsoft software to the trio ' s futuristic animation . &quot; We probably will meet with them in time . The idea of animated characters used in computer software , particularly CD-ROM software , as well as in movies -- you know everybody sees potential there , &quot; Gates said during a stop on a European tour . &quot; And so if they are really going_to go and do animated films , you can use software to make those very effectively and you can use the characters you create in the software . This is all fairly futuristic , &quot; he said . The high-profile entertainment trio said last week that its as-yet-unnamed studio will produce movies , animated films and television_shows . The three also plan a music unit and an interactive entertainment unit . Gates said Spielberg used software from Microsoft ' s high-end animation unit , Softimage , to create the dinosaur animation in the hit film &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; Microsoft acquired Montreal-based Softimage Inc. this year , after it had worked_on the film . Microsoft has also been instrumental in developing software that would run interactive television_programs on the so-called information superhighway . The founder of Redmond , Wash.-based Microsoft , which has cornered the computer software market with various applications of his Windows programs , said he saw Hollywood as a &quot; very strategic set of customers. &quot; &quot; We want to work with all_the studios , so we have to be a little careful . Who knows what they ' ll come_to us and suggest , &quot; Gates said .</TEXT>
