   <TEXT> Skier Jeremy Nobis finally lived_up_to expectations with his ninth-place finish in the men ' s giant slalom . It was only the third top-10 finish in Nobis ' international career . More important , Nobis won an Olympic sibling rivalry with his younger sister , Shannon , who was 10th in last week ' s super-G . &quot; There was a little motivation to nip her , huh ? &quot; Nobis said . &quot; can ' t let my little_sister beat me in the Olympics . Got her by one. &quot; * The U.S. giant slalom skiers performed just about as expected . Paul Casey Puckett went_out in the first run , Harper Phillips in the second and Erik Schlopy wound_up 34th , last among skiers who completed two runs . Schlopy ' s time was affected because he missed a gate on the first run and had to hike back_up the_hill to ski it again . Schlopy is not without a sense_of_humor . He is also entered in Sunday ' s slalom and wanted to pass along a prediction to a certain , flamboyant , Italian skiing star . &quot; Yeah , Tomba ' s mine ! &quot; Schlopy said . * What did Germany ' s Markus Wasmeier , the gold-medal winner in the giant slalom , do_in between runs Wednesday . &quot; First , I warmed_up my feet , &quot; he said . &quot; It was real cold. &quot; Wasmeier also arrived for the second run about half an hour early , not knowing the starting_time had been moved from 1 p.m. to 1:30 . &quot; I was confused , &quot; Wasmeier said . &quot; So I passed my time with some free skiing. &quot; * Germans weren ' t particularly supportive of Wasmeier after he had finished 36th in the Olympic downhill . But after winning gold in the giant slalom and super-G , it seems everyone ' s his friend . &quot; A lot of people are shaking my shoulders and congratulating me , &quot; Wasmeier said . &quot; But you know who your friends are . I made the distinction of who they were with me. &quot; * The U.S. women might have three medal contenders in today ' s giant slalom in Heidi Voelker , Eva Twardokens and Diann Roffe-Steinrotter . Roffe-Steinrotter would not have been considered among the favorites in this event before her surprising gold-medal victory in super-G . CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
