   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS : PROPOSITION 184 ; ' THREE STRIKES ' : A STEAMROLLER DRIVEN BY ONE MAN ' S PAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Proposition 184 , the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative on the Nov . 8 ballot , would make no change in the law . Yet nearly every politician in the state embraces it -- and the few who have doubts keep quiet . The opposition campaign is all but broke . A Times poll shows that likely voters favor the measure 58 % -32 % . But the prime sponsor , Mike Reynolds , on a nonstop crusade to avenge his daughter ' s murder , barnstorms the state as if legions of well-financed foes were attacking his initiative . In fact , Reynolds ' most visible foil is a single individual -- Marc Klaas , who , if this were not one of the fall ' s most unusual campaigns , would seem to be a natural ally . Klaas is the father of another murdered girl , Polly Klaas . The 12-year-old ' s kidnaping and slaying last year ignited Reynolds ' drive to place &quot; three strikes &quot; on the ballot . The initiative , like the &quot; three strikes &quot; law already in_effect , calls_for substantially increasing prison_terms for repeat felons . Yet with Klaas fighting to defeat Proposition 184 -- he says it goes too far and costs too_much -- the campaign features the spectacle of two fathers of murdered children arguing about how best to stop career criminals from preying on the rest of us . At a debate last week in this Bay Area suburb , Klaas accused promoters of Proposition 184 of engaging &quot; in a cynical , insensitive attempt &quot; to win votes with his daughter ' s murder . Supporters of 184 shot back , saying that if the law had been in place last year , the habitual_criminal charged with Polly ' s murder never would have been_on the streets . * Reynolds knows that whether or not Proposition 184 passes , his version of &quot; three strikes &quot; already is law in California . The initiative is word-for-word the same as the &quot; three strikes &quot; bill Reynolds pushed_through the Legislature early in the year . Gov . Pete Wilson signed it into law in March . But even with the substantial lead in the polls , and thousands of felons facing charges under its harsh provisions , Reynolds tirelessly travels the state stumping for &quot; three strikes &quot; as embodied in Proposition 184 . He arrived for the debate in San Ramon at night , by plane piloted by a friend , having begun the day with a morning talk_show appearance in Fresno and a lunchtime forum before judges and lawyers in Visalia . The reason he campaigns so hard is simple . Reynolds , a Fresno wedding photographer who buried his daughter when she was 18 , trusts almost nothing that goes_on in the state Capitol . &quot; You ask these guys for a hand , they ' ll take your arm , &quot; he says . As Reynolds sees it , a statute passed_by the Legislature is one thing . Politicians could undo such a law . But if the electorate approves &quot; three strikes , &quot; politicians will see it as political suicide to tinker with the statute . &quot; When ' three strikes ' passes_by the voters , the Legislature will be much less inclined to water it down , &quot; says Charles Cavalier , Sacramento political consultant for Reynolds and Proposition 184 . The origins of the &quot; three strikes &quot; campaign date to June , 1992 , when Kimber Reynolds stepped from a restaurant in Fresno , and two armed robbers with prison records sped_up on a motorcycle . One shot her in the head . As doctors removed Kimber ' s life support , Mike Reynolds vowed to find a way to keep repeat felons locked_up until they no longer pose a danger . Reynolds sought help from friends and contacts , including judges , lawyers and experts in the state_attorney general ' s office , to devise a law aimed at habitual_criminals . The result is the nation ' s most sweeping &quot; three strikes &quot; statute . Like the legislation , the initiative doubles prison_terms for criminals convicted of a second felony , if they already have been convicted of one prior serious or violent felony . The law lists about 30 serious and violent felonies , including murder , rape , attempted murder , armed robbery , hard_drug sales to minors and one property crime : residential burglary . * Criminals who commit a third felony , and have been convicted of two serious or violent felonies , will receive sentences of three times the prison_term now in the law for the particular crime , or indeterminate sentences of 25 years to life , whichever is greater . The most controversial provision places repeat felons under the tough provisions if they commit any felony on their second or third strikes . California law encompasses more_than 500 felonies , including such common crimes as petty theft and passing bad_checks . Courts already are filling , and state_prison officials forecast that the prison population , now 126 # 000 , will hit 232 # 000 by the turn_of_the_century , requiring 25 more prisons -- at about $ 200 million each . In Los Angeles County , Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti already has filed 9 # 000 &quot; three strikes &quot; cases since Wilson signed the bill into law . Garcetti takes no position on the initiative . But like many prosecutors , judges and defense_lawyers , he believes &quot; three strikes &quot; will add major costs to the criminal justice system . &quot; The initiative is going_to pass , &quot; Garcetti said . &quot; This law is going_to be the law for the foreseeable future , and we ' re simply going_to have to deal with it. &quot; The costs will come_in future years , and go largely unmentioned as political candidates almost uniformly extol &quot; three strikes &quot; in their campaigns . Assemblyman Bill Jones ( R-Fresno ) appears alongside Reynolds at debates , hoping his role as lead author of the &quot; three strikes &quot; legislation will help him become the next secretary_of_state . Rep . Mike Huffington ( R-Santa Barbara ) , the one-term congressman running_for U.S. Senate , is the largest donor to Reynolds ' campaign , giving $ 350 # 000 , a sum that bought him the title of &quot; co-chair &quot; of the initiative and that amounts to more_than a third of the $ 1 million-plus Reynolds has raised . Cavalier , the consultant for the Yes on 184 campaign , said the wealthy congressman attached no strings to the money . Cavalier also recalled that Huffington said early in the campaign : &quot; ' You ' ve got_to put this on the ballot , ' &quot; adding that Huffington &quot; wanted very much to use it as a campaign issue. &quot; By contrast , the No on 184 campaign raised $ 13 # 855 through September , scarcely meal money in California politics . The one check of any size , $ 10 # 000 , came from the California Teachers Assn . &quot; We ' re running on my credit_card , &quot; said political consultant Leo McElroy , a former Los Angeles television_news reporter who is steering the No on 184 campaign . &quot; I ' m hoping we raise enough money that I get reimbursed. &quot; Unless he finds a vein of gold , McElroy says he has no hope of defeating 184 . His goal is to prevent a landslide . &quot; If this passes with a substantial margin , there is no way the Legislature will buck the tide , &quot; McElroy said . &quot; If it passes 51 % -49 % , we have a chance to reopen the discussion. &quot; For some future Legislature to try to amend Proposition 184 , it would take a two-thirds vote of both houses . With only the present law in_effect , for amendments to pass would require simple majorities . Legally , that is the sole difference between Proposition 184 and the law that has been in_effect for the last six months . McElroy ' s campaign consists mainly of dispatching volunteers to every forum and debate on 184 . McElroy ' s volunteers are primed to give the message that Reynolds ' version of &quot; three strikes &quot; puts the wrong people in prison , and that it costs too_much . His most potent weapon is Klaas , a fact that Klaas and others involved in the campaign see as ironic . In December , as Reynolds gathered signatures for his initiative , Polly Klaas ' body was found in rural Mendocino County . Within hours of the horrible discovery , Reynolds was in Polly ' s hometown of Petaluma , at the invitation of a San Francisco radio talk_show host , circulating petitions for his initiative . By January , the grieving Marc Klaas was a prominent backer of Reynolds ' idea . In the following weeks , however , Klaas concluded that Reynolds ' version went too far . Klaas endorsed legislation pushed by the California District_Attorneys Assn. , which sought to imprison only repeat violent felons for life . The competing bill ' s backers named it after Polly Klaas . But as Reynolds ' &quot; three strikes &quot; bill swept_through the Legislature without so_much as a comma being changed , the Polly Klaas bill stalled in the state Senate . &quot; What ' s driving Mike is his passion , &quot; Klaas said . &quot; Mike doesn ' t want to be reasoned with. &quot; * Reynolds knows the Klaas murder fueled his petition drive . &quot; It would have been difficult for us to get the high velocity headlines that the Polly Klaas murder accomplished , &quot; he said . But he also believes his initiative would have qualified anyway , because he raised $ 800 # 000 for the paid signature-gathering drive to place it on the ballot . Reynolds says he does not understand Klaas ' opposition . &quot; I ' m sorry to say this , but I think it has come_down to a personal animosity . Whether it ' s the success we ' ve had_on this , a me-too syndrome , I don ' t know. &quot; At the San Ramon debate , Klaas pointed_out that Reynolds ' idea could send thieves to long prison_terms for stealing basketballs , pizzas or car stereos . &quot; I have had my stereo stolen . I have had my daughter murdered . I know the difference . Stereos can be replaced , &quot; Klaas said . Defending his law , Reynolds said : &quot; If a person has been convicted twice of serious or violent crimes , we ' d be crazy to afford him another chance to do another violent crime . If we can take him out on a low-level felony , by all means , we should do it. &quot; Reynolds cites a state Justice_Department report that crime fell 7.7 % in the first six months of the year and that homicide dropped 11.4 % . While most criminal justice experts say it ' s too early to explain the drop_in crime , Reynolds believes &quot; three strikes &quot; is having a deterrent effect . He also is convinced that &quot; three strikes &quot; won ' t cost the state much after all , and may end_up saving money , because crime-caused medical_bills , lost wages and property damage all will decrease , he says . &quot; Give it a chance to work , &quot; Reynolds says . &quot; Give this five years to do what we say it will. &quot;</TEXT>
