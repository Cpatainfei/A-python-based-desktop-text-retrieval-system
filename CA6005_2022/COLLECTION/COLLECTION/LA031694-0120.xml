   <HEADLINE> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ; NCAA ISSUES AND THE MEN ' S , WOMEN ' S TOURNAMENTS ; Q &amp; A / WITH RUDY WASHINGTON ; COACH TAKES ON NCAA OVER ISSUES OF EQUALITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> America didn ' t have a clue about the Black Coaches Assn . until January , when the 3 # 000-member organization threatened to shut_down college basketball with a nationwide boycott . In the time it took_to issue the threat , the BCA suddenly became a major_power broker in college athletics . At the core of the BCA ' s concerns is the belief that NCAA legislation and policies don ' t have the student-athlete ' s -- more specifically , the minority student-athlete ' s -- best interests at heart . The boiling point was reached at the NCAA Convention in January , when the powerful Presidents Commission chose not to support an amendment that would have returned the men ' s basketball scholarship level from 13 to 14 . The BCA , as well as the National Assn . of Basketball_Coaches , thought an understanding had been reached with the university presidents regarding the scholarship limit before the convention . Instead , the presidents shot_down the proposal , which ultimately prompted the BCA and its executive_director , Drake Coach Rudy Washington , to talk openly of a boycott . Frustrated by its inability to work within the NCAA legislative system , the BCA decided enough was enough . It and the NABC believed they had , in_essence , been betrayed by the Presidents Committee . Rather than do what it usually did -- nothing -- the BCA demanded that the system be reworked . . . or else . Among the BCA ' s complaints : -- A decreased number of educational opportunities for minority athletes . -- Decreased access of coaches to players . -- A lack of minority hiring in the upper reaches of the NCAA hierarchy . -- Concern over standardized academic eligibility standards and NCAA research involving those standards . The or-else strategy worked . Not long after the threatened strike , the Justice_Department arranged for federal mediation between the BCA and the NCAA . Those discussions are ongoing . For the BCA , which was formed nearly seven years ago by 29 coaches , most of them assistants , the federal mediation was a major triumph . For Washington , who has been with the BCA from its birth , it was simply another step_in a long walk . Washington , 42 , grew_up in Los Angeles and his resume shows stints at Verbum Dei and Locke high_schools , USC , Compton College , Clemson and Iowa before he took his first head coaching_job in 1990 . Washington recently agreed to an interview to discuss the BCA ' s genesis and agenda at his Des Moines , Iowa , office . * Question : How would you describe the BCA ' s power base and why do you think the BCA can change the way the NCAA does business ? Answer : I think this is the first time there ' s ever been any organized effort , especially in college athletics , to challenge the system . It ' s very difficult to say what makes us powerful . Obviously the people make us powerful in the organization , in their willingness to participate . We didn ' t expect 100 % participation and never did_in terms of a boycott situation . But who cares if Appalachian State and East Carolina boycott ? But if Duke and North Carolina boycott , then you get maximum results . The boycott wasn ' t necessarily meant to hurt individual schools , which it would have . But it ' s more to really get_into the pockets of the NCAA and its member institutions because of the TV contract . * Q : There was a recent PBS documentary on Malcolm X and near the end of the program someone asks Malcolm X . . . A : . . . Are you militant ? * Q : that ' s right . And he says . . . A : . . . No , I ' m Malcolm . * Q : So then , are you a militant ? A : No . I think it ' s just me . I didn ' t come_up in a militant time . When the Watts riots broke_out on 115th Street and Avalon , I lived three blocks from there . As a child of 13 or 14 , I could sit on my porch and listen to the windows breaking . At the time , there was a place around the corner from me on 120th called Shop-Rite . The drug store was there and I . . . could sit on my front_porch and ( watch ) people running_up and down my street with couches and televisions . It was entertainment . It wasn ' t even real_life . My mom and dad were both at_home . We didn ' t participate . We didn ' t get involved in the riots at all . As a child , I saw the whole_thing transpire . I watched the police come , the National_Guard . I watched the looting , I watched the killings . That was at 14 years old . You never realize what it is to be black until you have to live it , and you live it every single day . I ' m reminded every day that I ' m black . Somebody says something to me that reminds me that I ' m black . I think it ' s a uniqueness , particularly in my situation , that you have a foot in two worlds . I ' ve often told my white counterparts that my life is much more integrated than theirs . I have to live_in their world . Yet , when I have to go_back to my world , usually I ' m just alone and with other blacks . When they go_home , they ' re simply in their own white world . Even though they reach_out and try to touch us sometime , it ' s a very difficult thing to do . * Q : Do you think people truly understand what the BCA is trying to do ? A : No , they definitely don ' t understand it . that ' s what ' s so difficult about what we ' re doing . I think the public , when it ' s on its way to work , a doughnut and cup of coffee , it simply centers around one word . Like this time it was , &quot; They ' re boycotting because they didn ' t get the 14th scholarship. &quot; And that became the issue . that ' s easy for the American public to consume , but it wasn ' t even close to the issue itself . As a result of that , people don ' t take time to understand the issues and read , point-counterpoint . They simply take sides . Supposedly in our legal_system , it ' s illegal to lead a witness to a conclusion . But the press does_it every single day and I ' m not so sure that the columnists and journalists who are writing this stuff understand it . that ' s why it ' s difficult for me to do TV interviews because they want to do a sound_bite in two minutes or three minutes . I can ' t explain . . . how it directly affects what we ' re doing_in the NCAA in three minutes . You can ' t do_it . * Q : Did the BCA do a very good job of explaining those issues to America ? A : I think the issues are constantly being formulated . As a result of that , it ' s difficult to say , &quot; Here are the issues. &quot; You can set_down some issues , but you may have to expand on that . You talk_about academics . The first thing we were dealing with was , &quot; Black coaches are against academic standards. &quot; that ' s ridiculous . The problem is , when you ' re fighting a billion-dollar corporation like the NCAA , and you ' ve got coaches who don ' t have the ability to have public relations people , press people and those kind of things , then there ' s a good chance that ( the NCAA is ) going_to sway public perception . They ' re pros . I ' m a basketball_coach fighting for what I think is right . But what has happened now because of a grass-roots support of the people , perhaps public_opinion is beginning to balance a bit . But those people are pros and we just don ' t have the manpower , the money or the time to battle them in terms of public perception . Did we do a bad job ? No , because we knew there was a particular problem and we wanted to address it . It ' s important to mention that we also sent our representative for coaches ( Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski ) to the NCAA convention the year before last and he was literally laughed_off the stage . I think at that point , white coaches started to realize that they didn ' t have the power they thought they had , either . Here you take a guy from Duke University , a prestigious academic institution , and you have a clean cut , non-controversial guy , Mike Krzyzewski -- two national championships in America ' s hotbed of basketball , North Carolina -- and he comes_to make a passionate appeal_to America ' s ( university ) presidents and they more or less toss him off the stage and discard him as just another person who wants to win a game . I think that ' s when everybody started to say , &quot; Hey , what ' s going_on here ? &quot; * Q : Do you think Walter Byers or Dick Schultz ( former NCAA executive_directors ) or Cedric Dempsey ( newly elected NCAA executive_director ) appreciate the problems encountered by black coaches and athletes ? A : I think it would be very difficult and it gets_back to the thing of having a foot in both worlds . I don ' t think any white_person can feel_like a black_person , or vice versa . I do think , though , that there is a median for sensitivity for a particular problem . I thought Dick Schultz was good at that . I thought he tried to understand . I think Ced Dempsey will be excellent at that . I think Ced has had the experience of being an athletic director . He ' s actually touched some kids ' lives , black kids in particular . He ' s been at some very good schools . I think he ' ll do a good job , but right now he ' s in a tough political position . He just accepted the job and you ' ve got the African-Americans at one door knocking , trying to get_in , and you ' ve got gender equity at the other door knocking to get_in . You ' ve got cost containment at another door and you have the almighty Presidents Commission . He ' s in a tough political position , there ' s no question about it . It ' s something he ' s going_to have to work_out . Now if this was still Dick Schultz , he would have had his network and political factions in_order . He would have had his lobbying efforts in_order . This catches Cedric at a very difficult time because he doesn ' t even know who he can depend_on for certain things . * Q : Do you think the NCAA is inherently racist ? A : I don ' t like to label anything and I ' m not going_to say the NCAA is racist . When you talk_about the NCAA , we have to define what the NCAA is . Are we talking_about the national office or are we talking_about the individual institutions around the country ? * Q : We ' re talking_about that billion-dollar corporation you referred to . A : I don ' t think they ' re inherently racist . I don ' t think that ' s it . I think a lot of the presidents and the people making the decisions have a mentality like this : If you want to get_rid_of poverty , let ' s stop feeding the poor . With them thinking like that , that ' s how it directly affects us in legislative things that come_down the pike . I can ' t say if a person is racist or not . If a white_person disagrees_with a black_person , that does not make him racist . I don ' t like to put that label on anybody . When white people get that label as racist , they can never get_it off . . . . If you don ' t like me because of me , that ' s one thing . But if you don ' t like me because I ' m in a group of people , then that ' s a whole different thing . So I ' m very reluctant to say that about the NCAA itself . I will say because of its makeup and structure , it is extremely difficult for them to be sensitive , whether it be women ' s or minorities ' needs . They just don ' t have the input they need . You can ' t have , say , 15 white_men ( actually , 14 ) at the top of this organization , making decisions for women and blacks , and think they ' re going to hit every sensitive point that needs to be addressed . It ' s virtually impossible and it ' s a lot to ask them . * Q : Are you worried about your job security if there ' s a boycott ? A : I ' m not as secure as my three counterparts ( Temple Coach John Chaney , USC Coach George Raveling , Georgetown ' s John Thompson ) . They make a good dollar . I don ' t make six figures . * Q : So you have more to lose . A : Absolutely . There ' s no question about it . But I probably have more to gain , because I ' m younger . If you ' re talking_about public perception and all that , I ' m probably just starting my career . I feel strongly enough about the issue that I need to fight that . Unfortunately , most of our people , meaning African-Americans , will die like they lived their lives : asleep . They never know what ' s going_on around them . I just felt a real need to take a step and make some things work for us . I ' m younger than them , I ' m a protege of theirs and I ' m learning a lot . I think all_of them will retire at their particular institutions . I don ' t think Chaney , Thompson or Raveling will be going anywhere else . They ' ll stop right there , where I ' m looking_to move . Now , taking this position might set me back , but I ' m very comfortable with that . * Q : How do you respond to the people who say , &quot; Here we go again . The black coaches are complaining about something else. &quot; What makes this movement so different ? A : We have the ability to stop work now . I was just thinking_about that . This is no different from a man ignoring his wife , and his wife wants a new pair of shoes . So she asks_for them for six months , and one day the husband comes_home and nothing is done that was usually done and it becomes a crisis . So he takes her out and they go buy the shoes . . . . She creates a crisis . This is no more_than that . We ' ve been talking_about these things for years and the NCAA kept saying , &quot; Yes , we ' ll put a committee together . we ' ll study it . we ' ll do this , yes , yes. &quot; And then we say , &quot; Well , we ' re not going_to play any basketball . You ' re not going_to make any money . This thing is going_to stop until something is done. &quot; Call it a crisis , a dramatic gesture , if you will . As a result , we get the attention to deal with these avenues . We were forced to do this . This isn ' t something we wanted to do . * Q : Is there disagreement within the BCA on the wisdom of a boycott ? A : Sure there is . I think one of the worst things in the world is that people think all blacks think alike , that we should all be in lock-step with one another . When the ( NCAA convention ) vote was 191-119 ( against restoring a 14th scholarship for men ' s basketball ) , there were a lot of whites that agreed , but didn ' t agree . It ' s no different for blacks . We all have our own individual problems on our own individual campuses . * Q : What do you see as the future of the BCA ? A : The organization has taken_on a life of its own . I got a letter from a young_lady in the Pac-10 who feels_like she ' s being discriminated against . We ' re getting more and more requests for somebody to stand_up , whether it be students , coaches , whatever . We ' re kind of being looked_on by black people as somebody they can turn_to , have a sympathetic ear and defend them if necessary . I think that ' s where we ' re headed . * Q : Do you feel_like a martyr of sorts ? A : To be honest with you , I get scared like everyone else on different issues . But what I ' m doing , I believe_in . It ' s easy to continue because it ' s what I believe_in . I ' ve never seen myself as a martyr . I ' m the last guy to go_up front . I ' m the kind of guy who likes to stay in the back . When we went_to Washington D.C. the first time , I stayed in the back . When we have our conventions , I never go_to the microphone . I always let someone else handle the process up there . I kind of enjoy being in the background . But I do know there are times when I do have to stand_up front and be a leader . * Q : Do you think your role in the BCA could hurt you professionally ? A : It could . It might . There ' s people out there who . . . either like me or don ' t . that ' s good with me . At least , there ' s no gray areas . that ' s OK , because I have a problem with people who are neutral . I think people who like me will give me an opportunity . People who don ' t like me , that ' s the way it is . If you ' re an insecure athletic director , would you want this so-called 53rd most powerful person ( according to a 1993 Sporting News ranking of sports figures ) in the country on your staff ? Am I somebody you can work with ? that ' s something you ' re going to have to ask the athletic directors . I know that siding up with me is dangerous for some people . You find very few athletic directors and presidents who are willing to side up with the coaches . They might agree with them behind closed doors , but in_order for them to take a public stance , that ' s a tough thing for a lot of them . * Q : It appears your job might have been in jeopardy had you participated in the boycott . A : I realized that , but ( Drake administrators ) never told me that . They never sat_down and outlined that and I appreciated that , not issuing an ultimatum . I think you never go_to_war without having casualties . Is this something that is that important to me ? My answer is yes , it is that important to me . I don ' t think there ' s a parent out there who would n ' t give his life to give a better life for his child . that ' s the way I feel about that . I ' m committed . * Q : It ' s also true you received death threats because of your involvement with the BCA , isn ' t it ? A : I got some good advice from George Raveling not long ago . He said , &quot; Listen , have your secretary get all_of your hate mail and death threats , take them out of the envelope and don ' t read them. &quot; He said all it does is depress you . When I first started this job , it really used to bother me . But now the more and more death threats I get , the less it bothers me . . . . I ' ve found when I do read some of the negative mail it ' s because the people don ' t understand the issues . that ' s what makes them react the way they do . * Q : OK , let ' s go_through the issues . A : There are four major issues . The first one is academic standards for eligibility . In that arena right there , there is obviously apparent conflict between NCAA data and increasing academic standards . I think that we need to revisit some of these because it ( disproportionately ) affects minorities . that ' s it in a nutshell . Also , I think we should reconsider freshman eligibility . When you try to judge someone on test scores and grades , it makes_it very difficult . I think the only way to judge whether the kid can do the work or not is let the kid do the work . No . 2 is gender equity . How will it affect African-American females . Once black_women fight for gender equity , they have to turn_around and fight for racial equity . We ' re simply saying , &quot; Take a good hard look_at that , because you may_not want to fight for gender equity . Because while you ' re running around campaigning for gender equity , well , once you achieve that , racial equity is the balance. &quot; People don ' t hire black_women because they ' re women , it ' s because they ' re black . When white_women get a job , it ' s because of gender equity . It ( disproportionately ) affects them . It ' s difficult to explain to people in basketball and football who are black how you can increase sports on one side of the ledger for women , but decrease them in two major sports that black_men make_up a large percentage of . So it does affect African-American males . But we support gender equity . We just want to make_sure it doesn ' t hurt anybody . We support academic standards , but we don ' t want to hurt anybody . We believe_in individual assessment when it comes_to academic standards . Because high_school education isn ' t standardized , how can you do_it in college ? What they ' re learning at Jordan High_School in Watts , they ' re not teaching at Valley High_School in West Des Moines , Iowa . Two different worlds . Yet , those two different kids could end_up in the same class next year . They could both be at UCLA or USC in history class , sitting side_by_side , coming from two different worlds . No . 3 , accessibility to student-athletes is another issue . The rules just preclude coaches from being role_models . It doesn ' t give us access to our own kids on our own teams on our own campus in our community . The last one , of course , is the issue of hiring minorities . I was told once there are no exclusionary tactics going_on . But when you have three football_coaches , six athletic directors , one is a woman , 20 women basketball_coaches , 40 men ' s basketball_coaches , no black commissioners in the country , in the top 35 conferences -- you ' re right , exclusionary tactics might not be taking_place , but I ' m paranoid as hell about the whole_thing . Makes you think a little bit about what is going_on . There ' s not one African-American in the top 15 of the NCAA national office . They couldn ' t find one to make the final five in the executive_director ' s job . If I told you 30 years ago that in 1994 the Palestinians and the Israelis would be in Washington talking peace and living_in the same hotel . . . that the Berlin Wall would be down . . . that black_and_white South_Africans would be shaking hands and talking in an effort to unite their country . . . and that Russia would no longer be as we know it . . . but in America in college athletics we ' re fighting for opportunities and access , you ' d have me toted away in a strait jacket . Yet , here we are today and those things are happening . It ' s a sad state right now that we ' re in . Something has to be done . * Q : In your own BCA literature , you quote Arthur Ashe . Didn ' t Ashe share some of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ' s ( recently stated ) feelings , that blacks shouldn ' t be afraid of the academic bar being raised ? A : I think Arthur also did mention , too , that his battle with racism was tougher than his battle with AIDS . People never talk_about that . We ' re not against standards . We ' re against denial of opportunities . that ' s where this argument comes_in . We ' re not saying , &quot; Don ' t raise standards. &quot; But if you raise the standards , that ' s one thing , but don ' t deny opportunities based on those standards . People are doing this for freshmen in college . But the problem isn ' t when we get them . The problem is before we get them , at the elementary , junior_high and high_school levels . Any reasonable man will support standards . But when you start talking_about specific standards and where people fall , it becomes very dangerous . * Q : Former Marquette coach Al McGuire ( who once served on the BCA ' s advisory_board ) recently said that the BCA ' s involvement with politicians isn ' t altogether wise . His reasoning was that politicians are attracted to what he called , &quot; bright lights , &quot; that as soon as another hot_issue arrives , the BCA will be left without a guardian_angel . A : One thing we do have is the Congressional Black Caucus . We have a permanent task_force formed with them now , which gives us government intervention if we need it . I would think that Al is probably right . The NCAA is capable of devouring us and doing whatever they want . But they can ' t take_away the fighting spirit from us . I don ' t think this fight is over . It will continue until something is done that people are comfortable with . * Q : Give us the worst-case scenario and a best-case scenario involving your dispute over policy with the NCAA . A : I think the worst-case scenario is there ' s a boycott and coaches and players lose scholarships and jobs . The best-case scenario is sitting_down at the table and working toward a solution .</TEXT>
