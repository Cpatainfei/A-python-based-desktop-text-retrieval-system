   <HEADLINE> THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA ; A VIEW FROM THE STREET ; SHIFTING TIDES OF THE MARKET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> TECHNOLOGY STOCKS are in , utility and financial stocks are out . Or maybe it ' s the other way around . On Wall_Street , judging what ' s in and what ' s out is a relatively simple exercise , of course : Just look_at the trend in_stock prices . that ' s what our Market_Value 100 listing essentially does for the biggest California companies . A company ' s market_value is its stock price times the number of shares outstanding . So as stock prices rise or fall , so do companies ' gross market_values -- investors ' collective judgment of each firm ' s dollar worth at any particular moment . What the 1994 Market_Value 100 tally shows is that investors bid the shares of many California technology companies sharply higher over the past year , while stocks of banking , utility , energy and insurance_firms were slammed . The market_value of computer chip king Intel Corp. , for example , jumped from $ 24 billion a year ago to $ 28.2 billion as of March 31 , a big enough rise to make Intel No . 1 on the Market_Value chart -- knocking the perennial leader , oil giant Chevron Corp. , into second place . March 31 was the cutoff date for the Market_Value 100 chart . Meanwhile , SCEcorp , parent of Southern California Edison Co. , saw its market_value plummet to $ 7.4 billion in the 1994 tally from $ 11 billion a year ago , dropping it to 14th from 9th on the list . In market parlance , investors have been exhibiting a clear preference for &quot; growth &quot; stocks -- faster-growing young companies -- over &quot; value &quot; stocks , the slower-growing , high-dividend , old reliables such_as utilities . At least , that was true until recently . Over the past few weeks , Wall_Street has begun to turn_back to the value stocks , while tossing many technology stocks and other growth issues out the door . Blame these shifting tides on interest_rates ' fluctuations . A year ago , when interest_rates were still declining in a sluggish economy , value stocks such_as SCEcorp , BankAmerica Corp . and Unocal Corp . were the market ' s undisputed favorites . That made_sense : Better to count_on the dependable dividend of a plodding giant than on the iffy prospects of smaller growth companies who were at the mercy of the economy . By last fall , though , business_activity was clearly on the upswing , and interest_rates responded accordingly by edging slowly higher . For the utilities , banks , insurance_companies and other classic value stocks that fare best when rates are stable or falling , the turn_in rates was murder . Investors began selling value stocks in a frenzy . The natural beneficiaries of the economy ' s newfound strength , meanwhile , were growth_stocks , especially in technology , the Golden State ' s favorite-son industry . The stocks soared in the fourth quarter and into the first two months of this year as investors bet_on booming sales and earnings . But by late March , rising interest_rates became too_much even for go-go growth investors to bear . The growth_stocks began to slump , and the value stocks went_down with them . Until last week . After three successive boosts in short-term interest_rates this year by the Federal_Reserve_Board , investors ' thinking now appears to have come full circle : Many experts see the economy slowing again by summer , eventually leading to lower interest_rates . Suddenly , the value stocks are in again , while many growth_stocks remain on the outs . Of course , though Wall_Street pundits concern themselves with the horse_race between value and growth , for most investors the game need not be so cut and dried . By definition , a well-balanced portfolio would contain value stocks and growth_stocks . The key is knowing how to recognize when stocks in either group are bargains and when they ' re overpriced . Bargains you buy ; overpriced stuff you ignore ( or unload ) , just like in the department_store . that ' s where the other elements of our Market_Value 100 chart can help : The listings of &quot; book_value &quot; and &quot; market_value as a percentage of book. &quot; Book_value is the theoretical liquidation value of a company -- in other words , the assets that would be left for shareholders after all debts were paid . Market_value as a percentage of book_value , therefore , tells you how Wall_Street currently values a company relative to shareholders ' equity . In the case of Intel , market-to-book is 403 % : The company ' s assets , less liabilities , are theoretically worth $ 7.01 billion , but the value of its shares is $ 28.2 billion . Investors thus believe Intel ' s future is bright enough that paying four times its true worth today is fair . There is no single &quot; correct &quot; market-to-book ratio for stocks ; in_general , the ratio will always be highest for companies with the fastest growth_rates , and lowest for the slowest-growing firms or those whose stated book_value is most suspect . What Wall_Street pros look_for are stocks whose market-to-book ratios are at the lower end of their historical ranges , at_the_same_time that the companies ' prospects appear to be improving . The idea is to buy assets for as small a premium as you can , just before the value of those assets is enhanced by better earnings . Given the beating taken by many classic value stocks over the past six months , bargain hunters may naturally be drawn to stocks such_as Home Savings parent H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. , now selling for a mere 67 % of book_value ( compared to 83 % a year ago ) ; BankAmerica , at 102 % of book ( compared to 139 % ) , and Countrywide Credit Industries Inc. , at 174 % ( compared to 268 % ) . True , investing in financial stocks today requires a leap of faith that interest_rates won ' t rocket off the charts . Yet the same can be said of growth_stock investing . The surest way to bring_down lofty market-to-book valuations on technology stocks and other growth issues would be to offer sharply higher interest_rates on bonds and other competing investments . With many tech stock market-to-book ratios still far above year-ago levels , even with the latest sell-off in those shares , only bargain seekers with very long_time horizons may find technology a relative value now .
