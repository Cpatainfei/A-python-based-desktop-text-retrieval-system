   <HEADLINE> CUBA REFUGEES IN U.S. HOLD SPECIAL IMMIGRATION STATUS ; CITIZENSHIP : THOSE FLEEING CASTRO ARE UNIQUE IN BEING GUARANTEED ENTRY . HAITIANS , WHOSE EXODUS IS SIMILAR , SAY THEY ARE VICTIMS OF DISCRIMINATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , about 15 # 000 Haitians are crowded into a holding camp . Picked_up by U.S. warships as they tried to sail to America , they have no chance of entering the United States . Eventually , they will be sent_back home . A few miles away , in the port city of Mariel , thousands of Cubans are lining the docks , waiting to sail to South Florida . They , too , will be picked_up -- by Coast Guard cutters -- and brought_to Miami , where they will be welcomed as legal residents . No questions will be asked . The irony-filled image -- both groups are fleeing from oppressive regimes -- underscores one of the most striking disparities in U.S. immigration law : the favored treatment that has been afforded Cuban refugees here for the last 28 years . For a variety of Cold War-era reasons , Cubans enjoy a privilege that no others seeking to come_to the United States can claim : guaranteed entry into this country and immigrant status after one year . The special advantage stems from the mid-1960s , when Congress , eager to encourage defections from Fidel Castro ' s Communist regime , granted Cuban refugees instant status as legal residents , virtually ensuring that they would be able to apply for citizenship . Washington has more_than enough slots for the few thousand Cubans each year who apply for standard entry visas through the U.S. Interests Section in Havana , a kind of unofficial embassy that the United States maintains in the Cuban_capital . Cubans who come_to U.S. shores by spiriting themselves out of their country by airplane or boat -- as most among the current wave of Cuban asylum-seekers are doing -- are permitted to stay for at least a year and are granted near-automatic immigrant status after that . The old Cold_War legislation delights Cuban Americans in South Florida but it gnaws_at leaders of the area ' s fast-growing Haitian community , who have watched their own relatives in Port-au-Prince being turned_away from U.S. shores and sent_back to Haiti . Haitian American relief groups have complained bitterly that Haitian asylum-seekers -- who in many cases are being subjected_to political threats similar to those that have plagued the Cubans -- are being discriminated against by U.S. policy . The Haitians have a point . Under current law , Haitians who are seeking asylum in the United States must prove that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in their homeland . If they merely are seeking to come here to better their economic plight , they are summarily rejected . But Cubans who come here by boat are admitted with no questions asked , and they do not have to prove that they are escaping_from a repressive regime . Under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act , the government assumes that they are political -- rather than economic -- refugees . At the same time , the Clinton_Administration is finding the law affecting Cubans to be an impediment in a different way : As long as the legislation remains in_effect , it is difficult for the Administration to stem the tide by turning the Cubans away , as it has the Haitians . &quot; The law doesn ' t give us an awful lot of flexibility , &quot; one key U.S. strategist said . Adding_to the disparity -- and to the Administration ' s overall problems in handling the current influx -- is that Castro himself has refused to allow U.S. authorities to return Cuban nationals who have been rejected . Except for those sent_back after the 1980 Mariel boat lift -- after protracted negotiations with the Castro government -- Washington has only been able to return one Cuban national in the 35 years that Castro has been in office . What is more , Administration officials and congressional strategists alike say prospects that the legislation can be changed to make Cuban refugees subject_to the same entry requirements as those from other countries appear relatively dim . Unlike the Haitian Americans , who have only recently begun to exercise any political clout in the South Florida community , the Cuban Americans have become a serious power -- with plenty of allies among conservatives in all parts of the United States . With Castro still in office -- and his regime on the ropes because of the sharp deterioration in economic_conditions in Cuba -- lawmakers are not likely to want to change the regulations , particularly with an election on_tap for this November .</TEXT>
