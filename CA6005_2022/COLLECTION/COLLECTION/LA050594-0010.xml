   <HEADLINE> CINCO DE MAYO ; CELEBRATING TRADITIONAL MEXICAN COOKING ; HOLIDAYS : FOUR LOCAL MEXICAN COOKS SHARE THEIR RECIPES FOR A GREAT CINCO DE MAYO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Mucho trabajo ( it ' s a lot of work ) , &quot; says Linda Vega as she pushes an extraordinary jumble of ingredients through a giant sieve . Among them are pasilla chiles , sesame_seeds , almonds , peanuts , raisins , anise seeds , crisp fried tortillas , cinnamon , cloves , peppercorns , garlic and onion . Vega , 62 , is at_work in the kitchen of Diana ' s Mexican restaurant on Pacific Boulevard in Huntington Park . What is she making ? One more ingredient tells the story . It ' s a circle of Mexican chocolate that deepens the brick-red color of the sauce being strained to silky smoothness . This sauce is the key element in mole poblano ( mole from Puebla ) , a dish as appropriate to today ' s holiday , Cinco de Mayo , as corned_beef is to St . Patrick ' s Day . Cinco de Mayo commemorates a stirring battle between Mexican defenders and the invading French in Puebla on May 5 , 1862 . This aristocratic city is known for things other_than combat , though . Its greatest contribution may be the ornate cuisine that flourished in its convents . Long before the battle , Sor Andrea de La Asuncion , a Dominican nun from the Convent of Santa Rosa , produced the magic mole formula . The lavish stew delighted the visiting dignitaries in whose honor it was prepared , and it went_on to become one of Mexico ' s most popular dishes . On that memorable day , the mole was made with turkey -- one that had been fattened on chestnuts and hazelnuts . Today , chicken is more common . * Vega is from Guadalajara , not Puebla , but insists that her mole is just as_good_as the original . &quot; I make_it the same , &quot; she says . For 14 years , she has cooked at Diana ' s , which is one of six restaurants that grew out of a little market opened by Hortensia Magana in Gardena in 1969 . Diana ' s Mexican Food_Products is a busy operation . In addition to the restaurants , it has a central commissary , produces tamales and manufactures tortillas that are shipped as far as Japan . But there ' s still_room for Vega ' s brand of individuality . She works in the old way , gauging quantities by sight rather than weighing and measuring . And she has quite a following . Customers can tell when Vega is away because the food tastes different . Vega takes almost no time putting_together the bread pudding known as capirotada . Grabbing handfuls of toasted sliced bolillos , Vega starts the layers in a deep dish , tossing_in almonds and peanuts , raisins and prunes , coconut and cubes of cotija cheese . When the pudding is served , more coconut goes_over the top along with a sprinkle of grajea -- multicolored tiny candy balls . Meanwhile , boiling syrup fills the kitchen with the warm , sweet scent of cinnamon . Brown_sugar cones called piloncillo turn the syrup a rich brown . . . but what is that bobbing in the pan ? Apples ? No . They ' re tomatoes , which Vega will remove before pouring the syrup onto the pudding . What are they doing there ? &quot; Sabor ( flavor ) , &quot; Vega explains . And , she adds , &quot; tradicion . &quot; This is the way it has always been done_in her family . * For restaurant service it is easier to boil the chicken separately , then ladle the sauce over each serving , but it is much better when the chicken is cooked in the sauce . Simply prepare the sauce as described , then combine sauce and cut-up chicken in Dutch_oven and cook over medium heat until chicken is tender , about 45 minutes . Red Mexican rice and refried beans accompany the mole at Diana ' s . DIANA ' S MOLE POBLANO 1 / 2 pound dried pasilla ancho chiles 1 ( 3 1 / 4-ounce ) circle Mexican chocolate 2 tablespoons unsalted shelled peanuts 2 tablespoons blanched almonds 2 tablespoons sesame_seeds 2 tablespoons raisins 1 1 / 2 teaspoons anise seeds 2 sticks_cinnamon 3 whole cloves 3 peppercorns 2 small cloves garlic 2 slices onion , each about 1 inch thick 1 tortilla , fried crisp 5 tablespoons sugar Salt 3 tablespoons oil 2 ( 3 1 / 2- to 4-pound ) chickens Remove and discard seeds and stems from chiles . Place chiles in saucepan , cover with water , bring_to boil , remove from heat and let chiles stand until soft . Place chocolate in bowl , cover with warm tap_water and let stand 10 minutes , until slightly softened but not dissolved . In large , heavy skillet or Dutch_oven combine peanuts , almonds , sesame_seeds , raisins , anise , cinnamon sticks , cloves , peppercorns , garlic and 1 slice onion . Cook over low heat , uncovered , very gently 30 minutes , stirring often to keep_from burning . Place in bowl and cover generously with water . Soak until slightly softened , making them easier to grind . Drain chiles . In batches , combine some of chiles and some of cooked onion mixture , fried tortilla and chocolate in blender and blend until finely ground . To facilitate blending , add chile soaking liquid and liquid in which nuts and spices were soaked . Sauce should be very fluid rather than paste . Put_through sieve to eliminate solids . Add sugar and salt to taste . Heat oil in 3-quart pot . Add remaining onion slice and cook until lightly browned . Add sauce mixture to onion and oil and simmer 15 minutes . Sauce can be prepared in_advance and reheated at serving time . Makes about 7 cups sauce . Cut chickens into serving pieces . Place in Dutch_oven and add water just to cover . Bring to boil , reduce heat and simmer , covered , 45 minutes , or until tender . Place serving of chicken on each plate and top with 1 / 2 to 3 / 4 cup sauce . Makes 8 servings .

Rogelio ' s Tortilleria The wonderful , earthy aroma of cooked dried corn draws you to Rogelio ' s Tortilleria . Once inside , it ' s impossible to leave without an armful of fresh corn tortillas and a sack of Petra Anguiano ' s tamales -- sweet ones to go_with coffee , savory red or green chile tamales for dinner or a snack . Women from the neighborhood drop_in for masa -- lots of it -- to make their own tamales and tortillas . One orders 35 pounds , which her husband carries_off in a big black speckled pot . Rogelio ' s , located on Huntington Drive between downtown Los Angeles and South Pasadena , is a shop that is so modest it doesn ' t even have a sign . The only clues to what goes_on there are the big corn hoppers at one end of the building -- the hopper is no longer used -- and the sacks of corn and corn flour that are piled in the yard . This is a family_business , run_by the Anguianos . Petra Anguiano is from Guadalajara ; her husband , Raoul , is from Guanajuato . The busiest part of the day is 4 to 7 a.m. , when the tortilla line pumps out the day ' s merchandise . Later on , Petra might spend a_couple_of hours at the counter next to the rack that holds tortillas , tostada crisps and bags of dried chiles . Rogelio ' s also makes flour tortillas , both with and without lard , and sells carnitas on weekends . The dish Petra would serve for Cinco de Mayo is , of course , made with tortillas . Entomatadas are similar to enchiladas , only the tortillas are coated with fresh tomato_sauce rather than spicy red chile . The platter is decorated so prettily that you can hardly stand to disrupt the artistry . Temptation overcomes that feeling quickly , and you find that entomatadas are entrancingly light . All that ' s inside is shredded chicken . On top and round about are lettuce , avocado , cheese , sour_cream , onion and radish slices . For Cinco de Mayo , Petra would also serve rice , beans , flan and , to drink , horchata ( sweet and made with ground rice ) or &quot; una coca . &quot; Entomatadas are practical and nutritious , she says proudly , sketching the way the platter should be arranged . Best of all , they ' re &quot; muy facil de hacer ( very easy to make ) . &quot; PETRA ' S ENTOMATADAS 1 ( 3 1 / 2- to 4-pound ) chicken 2 cloves garlic , chopped Salt 6 tomatoes 1 / 2 onion , chopped 3 cloves garlic , chopped 1 to 2 jalapeno chiles , optional Oil 1 bay_leaf 1 ( 8-ounce ) can tomato_sauce , optional 1 dozen tortillas Lettuce , whole leaves and shredded Sour_cream 1 large avocado , sliced 1 or 2 tomatoes , sliced Grated Parmesan cheese Sliced onion Sliced radishes Place chicken in Dutch_oven . Add water almost to cover , garlic and salt to taste . Bring to boil , reduce heat and simmer , covered , until chicken is tender , about 45 minutes . Drain , reserving broth for another use . Shred meat , discarding skin and bones . Boil tomatoes until softened . Drain . In blender or food_processor , grind tomatoes with onion , garlic and jalapenos , if desired , to puree . Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large saucepan . Add tomato mixture and bay_leaf . If tomatoes do not have good color , add canned tomato_sauce . Season to taste with salt . Bring to boil , reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes . Heat each tortilla quickly over burner of range , then fry few moments in oil , just to soften . Dip each tortilla in hot tomato_sauce and remove . Place some of chicken on each tortilla and roll as if rolling enchilada . Arrange lettuce leaves around edge of large platter . Place shredded lettuce in center . Arrange entomatadas on lettuce . Top each with spoonful of tomato_sauce , then with dab of sour_cream , 1 avocado slice and 1 tomato slice . Sprinkle all_over with Parmesan cheese . Arrange onion and radish slices around edge of platter . Makes 1 dozen , or 6 servings . Each serving contains about : 482 calories ; 341 mg sodium ; 93 mg cholesterol ; 34 grams fat ; 19 grams carbohydrates ; 26 grams protein ; 1.05 grams fiber . Charlotte Reyes If there ' s anything Charlotte Reyes doesn ' t like , it ' s what she calls &quot; phony Mexican food. &quot; So she cooks her own , using old family recipes . And the dishes turn_out so well that friends tell her to open a restaurant . Several of Reyes ' recipes have wound_up in print -- in a cookbook called &quot; The Stuffed Tiger &quot; put_out by 97th Street School in Los Angeles . Reyes is a teacher ' s aide there and also teaches art . She ' s an artist herself , good_enough to sell her work . Sketches of fruit and kitchen implements decorate her classroom . For Cinco de Mayo , Reyes suggests tacos filled with ground_beef and finely diced potato . &quot; that ' s the way my grandmother used to prepare them , &quot; she says . Toppings such_as cheese , lettuce , tomatoes , avocado , sour_cream and a spicy salsa are served on the side . The salsa blends three varieties of hot chile , which gives it plenty of fire . Reyes was born in Los Angeles , far from her grandmother ' s home_in El Paso . But her mother , Rosa Jimenez , has passed_on many of the old family recipes . Reyes would accompany the tacos with red Mexican rice , refried beans dressed_up with cheese and green chiles and a light dessert such_as Jell-O or fruit_cocktail ; her family avoids sweets . If it weren ' t for that restriction , she would serve flan . To make refried beans , Reyes adds boiled pinto_beans to hot oil and mashes them until soupy and creamy , working in Jack or longhorn cheese while mashing . Then she puts_in canned chile strips and more cheese . Reyes seasons the rice with onion , garlic_salt and tomato_sauce and often adds vegetables such_as corn or carrots . But think_twice about adding peas , she warns . &quot; Kids don ' t like them. &quot; * Other ground meat such_as pork , chicken or turkey could be substituted for beef . CHARLOTTE REYES ' TACOS 1 pound ground_beef 2 potatoes , peeled and cut_into very small dice 3 carrots , peeled and grated 1 / 4 teaspoon salt 1 / 8 teaspoon ground cumin 1 / 8 teaspoon garlic_salt 2 dozen corn tortillas Oil 1 / 2 pound Jack cheese , shredded 1 / 2 pound yellow Cheddar_cheese , shredded 4 tomatoes , cut_into small dice 2 avocados , diced 1 head_lettuce , sliced thin 1 ( 8-ounce ) carton sour_cream Charlotte ' s Salsa Picante In large skillet , cook meat with potatoes , carrots , salt , cumin and garlic_salt until meat is browned and vegetables are tender . Soften tortillas quickly in oil . Place some of meat mixture in center , fold in half and fasten with wood picks . Fry in deep hot oil until crisp . Drain . Remove picks . Arrange cheeses , tomatoes , avocados and lettuce on platter . Place sour_cream and salsa in bowls . Add cheeses , vegetables , sour_cream and salsa to tacos as desired . Makes 2 dozen . Each taco contains about : 273 calories ; 330 mg sodium ; 32 mg cholesterol ; 16 grams fat ; 22 grams carbohydrates ; 11 grams protein ; 1.28 grams fiber . Charlotte ' s Salsa Picante 5 serrano chiles 5 yellow ( guero ) chiles 5 jalapeno chiles 5 tomatoes 1 onion , chopped 1 clove garlic , chopped Leaves from 1 bunch cilantro 1 / 2 to 1 cup water Salt 1 ( 8-ounce ) can tomato_sauce , optional Remove seeds and stems from serrano , yellow and jalapeno chiles . Cut_off tips . Combine chiles and tomatoes in saucepan with water to cover and simmer until soft . Drain . Combine chiles , tomatoes , onion and garlic in blender container and blend until finely ground . Add cilantro and blend again . Add water as needed to make sauce consistency . Season to taste with salt . If flavor is too spicy from chiles , add tomato_sauce . Makes 3 cups . Martha Castillo Andres Castillo detests chicken . But he loves his mother ' s pollo en salsa de naranja ( chicken in orange sauce ) . &quot; It ' s the only way he ' ll eat it , &quot; says mom , who is Martha T . Castillo of El Sereno . You can see why that would be . The chicken is sweet and fruity , covered with a syrupy sauce that turns it a vibrant golden brown . As thick as a glaze , the sauce contains raisins and nuts along with orange_juice , herbs and other seasonings . For a grand celebration , Sherry can replace part of the orange_juice . Martha Castillo was born in Los Angeles and raised in Zamora , Michoacan . The pollo recipe came from her grandmother , who lived_in Purepero , a_few miles from Zamora . The recipe was perfected by an aunt , Eloisa Torres de Mora . Torres taught cooking and specialized in this and other dishes from Mexico ' s alta cocina ( high cuisine ) . Castillo has changed the procedure slightly . I make_it &quot; the lazy way , &quot; she says . That means using ready-made ground pasilla chile rather than frying , soaking and grinding whole dried chiles , as her aunt would have done . The chile enhances the rich taste but does not turn the sauce hot . Castillo would serve the chicken with traditional Mexican accompaniments on Cinco de Mayo . That means beans and rice . Instead of red Mexican rice , she would choose a white_rice seasoned with chopped cilantro . She also does a red rice , cooked with onions , garlic , tomatoes and a cilantro sprig on top . The beans would be refried . Then there would be green_salad and fried plantains . Castillo slices the ripe fruit and fries it in olive_oil until browned . Guests would drink sodas with the chicken and fruit for dessert , nothing more caloric and sugary because the meal is rich enough . * Castillo usually omits the nuts , but they add a nice crunch to the dish . MARTHA CASTILLO ' S POLLO EN SALSA DE NARANJA 1 ( 3 1 / 2- to 4-pound ) chicken , cut_up , rinsed and patted dry 1 tablespoon ground dried pasilla chile 1 / 2 cup finely chopped tomato 1 / 2 cup finely chopped onion 1 clove garlic , chopped 1 1 / 2 cups orange_juice 1 cup raisins 2 tablespoons slivered almonds , optional 1 / 8 teaspoon dried thyme 1 / 8 teaspoon dried basil 1 bay_leaf Salt Spray Dutch_oven with non-stick cooking spray . Add chicken pieces and cook , covered , over low to medium heat 20 minutes . Turn at least once . Take_out chicken , reserving 2 tablespoons fat in pan . Remove larger bones , if desired . Add ground chile and fry until color deepens . Add tomato , onion and garlic and saute until onion is tender . Return chicken to pan . Add orange_juice , raisins , almonds , thyme , basil , bay_leaf and salt to taste . Stir to coat meat . Cover and simmer over very low heat until sauce resembles glaze , 15 to 20 minutes . Stir occasionally so chicken does not stick_to pan and burn . Makes 4 servings . Each serving contains about : 556 calories ; 204 mg sodium ; 130 mg cholesterol ; 27 grams fat ; 46 grams carbohydrates ; 35 grams protein ; 1.25 grams fiber . Variation : Pollo al Jerez -- Instead of using 1 1 / 2 cups orange_juice , use 1 cup Sherry and 1 cup orange_juice . * In Mexico , it ' s traditional to saute the rice before adding water . MARTHA ' S ARROZ BLANCO 1 tablespoon margarine 1 1 / 2 cups long-grain rice 1 / 2 cup chopped onion 1 clove garlic , chopped 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves 3 cups water 1 chicken bouillon_cube Heat margarine in Dutch_oven .
