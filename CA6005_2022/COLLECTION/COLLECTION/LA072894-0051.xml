   <HEADLINE> IMAGES OF L.A. ; HISTORY : VAST COLLECTION OF FORMER NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER SHOWS A CENTURY ' S WORTH OF FAMOUS NAMES , INCLUDING WILLIAM MULHOLLAND , CHARLIE CHAPLIN AND ' THE BLACK DAHLIA. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Delmar Watson narrows his eyes , looking through the row of binders for the one labeled gore . He finds it and flips through the photos -- a catalogue of mayhem shot almost 50 years ago . As the former news photographer points to a picture of a bloody and dismembered body , or a pair of ankles dangling over train tracks , he says : &quot; Look_at their shoes . Whenever I shot a corpse , I ' d wonder if , when they put_on their shoes in the morning , if they knew this would be the last time. &quot; Watson , 68 , puts the binder back , and quickly grabs another . &quot; Hey , let me show you these . . . . &quot; Watson can go_on and on , and will do so if you give him the chance . But , with the exception of a photo exhibit here and there , few have had an opportunity to enjoy his private collection . Some of the photos were shot by his uncle , George Watson , a pioneer photojournalist . Others were willed to Delmar by colleagues , who knew he would take_care of their treasures . Watson ' s dream is to find the money , hopefully from corporate sponsorship , to open a &quot; Photographers Hall_of_Fame &quot; -- a museum that would be a fitting place for his archives . For now , he keeps his memorabilia in the office of his company , Images of the Past Inc. , His home away from home is situated in a drab , green two-story house in Hollywood that he bought_in 1967 . Over the years the place has become a cluttered vault , containing nearly 2 million photos , turn-of-the-century cameras , newspapers yellowed with age and old maps -- priceless records of 20th Century Los Angeles . There are photos shot by George Watson of William Mulholland ' s anguish over the failure in 1928 of the San Francisquito Dam near Castaic , in which more_than 400 people died . Among George Watson ' s thousands of celebrity photos is one of a smiling Albert Einstein posing with a young Charlie Chaplin , both dressed in tuxedos . In the gore file are photos of the mutilated nude body of the aspiring actress known as &quot; The Black Dahlia , &quot; whose murder almost 50 years ago remains one of Los Angeles ' most famous unsolved cases . Delmar Watson ' s dry sense_of_humor is evident even before he opens his mouth . Above the office entrance are three photos -- a former mayor of Los Angeles and two former Presidents with appropriate ID ' s underneath : &quot; Tom , Dick , Harry. &quot; Although his hair is gray , his eternal enthusiasm and energetic manner make him appear 10 years younger . Watson wears a rumpled white shirt and a loosened tie , and he has an amazing capacity to talk and talk -- dishing_out anecdotes about his days as a photographer for the now-defunct Los Angeles Mirror , bemoaning the loss of family values in society and telling of growing_up as a true child of Hollywood . His five brothers and three sisters all worked in the movies . &quot; I was born 800 feet from Mack Sennett ' s studios ( near Silver Lake ) . They made a lot of comedies , and whenever they needed kids , they called us , &quot; said Watson . He said he had a lot of fun acting in about 300 films during his youth , playing Shirley Temple ' s goatherd friend in &quot; Heidi , &quot; as well as a small part in the 1939 film &quot; Mr. Smith Goes_to Washington. &quot; But their father , Coy Watson , a casting director who got his start in the business training horses for Westerns , kept his children from signing contracts with the studios . &quot; My father knew the business , and he knew that long-term contracts would ruin the kids , &quot; Watson said . &quot; In those days , the studio owned you , and when you reached puberty , they didn ' t want you anymore. &quot; Photography -- and the ways of the pack_rat -- seemed to be a hereditary trait in the Watson family . Uncle George Watson in 1917 became the first full-time photographer hired by the Los Angeles Times . Two years later , he shot the first aerial photos of Los Angeles , one of which ran the next day on the front page below a banner headline . In addition to shooting some of California ' s most spectacular news_events , such_as the 1932 Los Angeles Olympic Games , he founded the Los Angeles Press_Photographers Assn . in 1935 . In 1913 , he invented the process by which pictures are put_on microfilm , selling the rights for $ 250 . &quot; His mind was inventive , &quot; Delmar Watson said of his uncle . &quot; He didn ' t know how to take a picture of the city from 2 # 000 feet because it had never been done before . But nothing would stop him . He would try anything. &quot; His uncle kept everything , said Delmar , from old cameras to press credentials from every major assignment that The Times sent him on . The other Watsons , meanwhile , were hoarding publicity stills from the movies they worked_on , as well as memorabilia such_as party invitations from Fanny Brice , Christmas_cards from Lionel Barrymore and a hand-written thank_you letter from director Frank Capra . As he outgrew children ' s roles , Delmar started taking pictures , first for his high_school yearbook . After a two-year stint in the Army as World_War_II was winding down , he got a job working the wire photo machine at Acme News Pictures ( later taken_over by United Press International ) . &quot; that ' s where I learned how to crop photos , and what made a good picture , &quot; he said . Meanwhile , his five brothers all became photographers in the Los Angeles press corps . In 1948 , Delmar Watson started working for the Los Angeles Mirror , covering everything from visits by foreign heads_of_state to grisly crimes and accidents . One of his more memorable assignments , he said , was covering the Kathy Fiscus tragedy . The entire nation was moved by the drama as rescue crews spent nearly two days and nights in April , 1949 , trying to save the 3-year-old girl who had fallen 94 feet down an abandoned well in San Marino . Millions watched on live television as her lifeless body was retrieved . &quot; Our paper was lucky because we got a shot of the parents , holding each other , &quot; Watson said . &quot; The television coverage also made_it memorable because it was so new , and a lot of people ran_out to buy televisions just to watch this. &quot; During his career as a news photographer , Watson won awards from Life magazine and the Associated Press . He said he left the Mirror in 1958 because he knew the advent of television would diminish the importance of still photos . The days of the ambulance chasing news photographer , he observed , were quickly coming_to an end . He worked with his five brothers , shooting publicity photos for clients such_as real_estate firm Coldwell Banker or air carrier Flying Tiger Line . He bought the house on Hawthorn Avenue in 1967 and started Images of the Past . Soon , documentary producers and filmmakers working_on period_pieces would call him to use his photos or to seek his technical advice . In 1976 , he published &quot; Quick , Watson , the Camera , &quot; a chronicle of nearly a century of Los Angeles history , which included photos taken by George Watson and Delmar and his brothers . He also edited an Olympic retrospective published in 1984 and a collection of movie_stars ' photos called &quot; Goin ' Hollywood 1887-1987 , &quot; published in 1988 . &quot; I think I could spend about eight months there , just looking_at stuff , &quot; said Nick Nixon , who publishes &quot; I Collect Magazine , &quot; a monthly targeted at sports cards and comic_book collectors . Watson has contributed 15 cover photos , including those of several sports legends , for Nixon ' s magazine . Watson ' s collection &quot; is priceless , &quot; said Nixon , 40 , who lives_in Colorado . &quot; He has it all -- the good , the bad and the ugly. &quot; &quot; There ' s nothing like photographs , &quot; Watson said . &quot; They take you back immediately . It ' s like a song you remember from high_school . The minute you hear it , you ' re back. &quot;</TEXT>
