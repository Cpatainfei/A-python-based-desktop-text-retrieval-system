   <HEADLINE> THEATER ; ACTS OF GOODNESS ; JANE ANDERSON EXPLORES THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES OF DOING THE RIGHT THING IN A REVIVAL OF HER PLAY ' THE BABY DANCE. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; In my generation , &quot; says 39-year-old playwright-screenwriter Jane Anderson , &quot; to be honest , to do the decent thing , is considered a heroic act. &quot; Sitting in the courtyard patio of her Hollywood Hills home and framed by a window with a panoramic view of the smoggy Los Angeles Basin , Anderson is genuinely puzzled by this cultural devaluation of goodness . Yet she argues -- primarily through a growing body of plays and films -- that characters animated by the good deed can be dramatically powerful . And when deeds crash on the shoals of good intentions , as in her first full-length drama , &quot; The Baby Dance , &quot; revived and opening tonight at the American Renegade Theatre , goodness breeds tragedy . Anderson ' s opus is unusually visible right now : By a fluke , &quot; The Baby Dance &quot; is also being revived in an acclaimed staging by Bud Leslie at Beverly Hills ' Theatre 40 , while &quot; It Could Happen to You , &quot; the film written by Anderson about a cop ( Nicholas Cage ) who shares his lottery winnings with a waitress ( Bridget Fonda ) , is in local theaters . &quot; The small miracle of that movie , &quot; says Anderson , &quot; is that the idea that made me sit_down in front of my computer to write the script over three years ago actually made_it to the screen . I wondered how great it would be if good people actually were rewarded. &quot; * &quot; The Baby Dance &quot; dramatizes the dark side of the decent act . Wanda and Al are poor and overburdened , with too many mouths to feed . When Wanda is pregnant again , they take_up an ad offer in the paper from an affluent and childless young Los Angeles couple , Rachel and Richard , who wish to buy &quot; a healthy white baby. &quot; The coming_together of these two couples is a cultural train wreck : Secularism , eco-awareness and business-like efficiency collide_with religious tradition , poverty , patriarchy and a common_sense born of necessity . Director Jessica Kubzansky notes that staging &quot; The Baby Dance &quot; at American Renegade is , for her , a &quot; wonderful change &quot; from such stylized theater work as &quot; Monsieur Shaherazad , &quot; which she took_to the Edinburgh Festival and London with actor Ron Campbell . Anderson ' s play contains &quot; such longing and yearning , with the tragedy that no one gets what they want . It would have been easy to make characters into good and bad_guys , but Anderson is incredible in how she manages to make them all people trying to get what they need to survive. &quot; Of all_the issues raised by &quot; The Baby Dance &quot; -- a play that is fast becoming a staple in American theaters -- it isn ' t surrogate parenting that most inspired Anderson : &quot; You know , it was the clash of classes . Class differences are a real concern of mine . I guess I realize how lucky I am . Some of us are born with all_of the opportunities in the world , and some aren ' t . But it ' s no one ' s fault how they were born . And I think_of this little soul in the play , floating between two completely different kinds of lives . The baby could become a drunk on welfare , or a doctor . Where we ' re plunked_down is what makes us or breaks us. &quot; Anderson was plunked_down in a well-to-do Bay Area family , then studied at Boston ' s Emerson College and Ohio University , and struggled as both an actor and stand-up comic . While she learned &quot; the efficiency of the craft &quot; of TV writing , she also developed a pair of perhaps the most charming and memorable writer-actor performance works in ' 80s L.A. theater : &quot; How To Raise a Gifted Child &quot; and &quot; Defying Gravity. &quot; Immediately , her voice was in place , her concerns absolutely focused . From then on , every Anderson play and film has dwelt on common folk , their responses to crises beyond their control , all within highly crafted narratives triggered by topical events . &quot; There are two types of writers , &quot; says Anderson , &quot; the ones who feed from within , like O ' Neill or Anne Sexton , and others , like me , who feed off of what we see. &quot; Her plays have observed incarcerated journalist hostages in the Middle_East ( &quot; Hotel Oubliette &quot; ) , a homeless family venturing to Disneyland ( &quot; Food &amp; Shelter &quot; ) , and a seminar on crisis preparedness , from quakes to locusts ( &quot; Smart Choices for the New Century , &quot; upcoming at the next Humana Festival at Actors ' Theatre of Louisville ) . And even in film and TV , where writers can hardly be auteurs , the same themes dominate . The Emmy-winning &quot; The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom &quot; was a brilliant display of Anderson ' s black wit , and an instant TV movie classic . * Two upcoming film projects concern circles of unusual women : &quot; Lady Icarus &quot; reveals the hidden tale of female test_pilots who almost became astronauts , while &quot; How to Make an American Quilt , &quot; adapted from Whitney Otto ' s novel , observes the quilting culture of women . After &quot; The Baby Dance &quot; premiered at Pasadena Playhouse , the play was stopped cold in New York , running headlong into a thorough pan from the New York Times ' Frank Rich . &quot; ' The Baby Dance ' is out there now , on its own , &quot; she says , a little wistfully . &quot; It ' s like a child I raised , and now it ' s married with kids. &quot; Where and When What : &quot; The Baby Dance. &quot; Location : American Renegade Theatre , 11305 Magnolia Blvd. , North Hollywood . Hours : 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays , 7 p.m. Sundays . Price : $ 10 to $ 12 . Call : ( 818 ) 763-4430 .</TEXT>
