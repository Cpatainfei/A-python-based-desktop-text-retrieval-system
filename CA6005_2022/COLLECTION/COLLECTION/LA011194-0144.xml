   <TEXT> Mexican Interior Minister Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido , a former governor of the embattled Chiapas state , Monday became the first political casualty of the deadly Indian uprising that has jolted the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . Saying he was acknowledging &quot; that which did not work , &quot; Salinas announced that he had accepted Gonzalez ' s resignation and replaced him with Atty . Gen . Jorge Carpizo MacGregor , a former human_rights ombudsman . When he was governor in Chiapas , Gonzalez ' s regime was implicated in some of the numerous human_rights abuses and conflicts over land that many Mexicans believe contributed to the New Year ' s Day uprising by largely Indian guerrillas . The new interior minister , Salinas said , will be in_charge of &quot; quickly restoring tranquillity to Chiapas and maintaining ( peace ) elsewhere in the country. &quot; Salinas is faced with a widening political crisis following the rebellion by guerrillas claiming to fight for indigenous rights in the impoverished hills of southern Mexico . Ten days after the uprising began , the Mexican army is still fighting pockets of rebel resistance , while violence in the form of bombs and sabotage has spread to the capital . At the same time , national and international protests over alleged abuses committed by the army are growing . &quot; We are no longer talking_about a local confrontation but a national problem that has exposed the profound tectonic fractures that run_through Mexico ' s social fabric , &quot; columnist Rodolfo Stavenhagen said Monday in the independent La Jornada newspaper . &quot; So far , the government has simultaneously used a hard line while proposing , without much credibility , the soft line ( negotiations ) . Undoubtedly in the highest spheres of government , they are debating both alternatives. &quot; Salinas ousted Gonzalez as part of a larger overhaul of his Cabinet , which included the naming of a new foreign_minister . Manuel Camacho Solis , the previous foreign_minister and a popular former Mexico_City mayor , was named to head a reconciliation commission for Chiapas . Gonzalez has come under considerable criticism both before and after the Indian insurrection , the worst outbreak of violence in Mexico in more_than two decades . It has claimed more_than 100 lives . As interior minister , Gonzalez was in_charge of national security , the efficiency of which is now in doubt because of the rebellion . Last summer , Gonzalez repeatedly denied Mexican press reports of the existence of guerrilla groups in Chiapas ; the government late last week was forced to admit it knew about the group for months but did not act . Further , Gonzalez was governor of Chiapas for five years until he was named interior minister a year ago . During his governorship , conflicts escalated between landless peasants and well-off farmers . Human_rights groups have accused Gonzalez of using violence to put_down peaceful Indian protests . They also cite the case of Father Jose Padron , an outspoken advocate of Indian rights ; as part of Gonzalez ' s running battle with pro-left priests , Padron was jailed illegally for 50 days . &quot; The repression was so harsh , &quot; said Querubin Mayorga Penagos , an opposition politician from Chiapas , &quot; that we began calling him Gov . Latrocinio &quot; -- a word in Spanish that rhymes with Gonzalez ' s first_name and means &quot; thievery. &quot; &quot; When he took_office he said he would only act according to the law , but he always denied justice to the poor of countryside , where the only thing that counted was the money of the caciques ( political_bosses ) , &quot; Mayorga told the magazine Proceso . Gonzalez , a well-connected , longtime member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , has always insisted he acted only by the letter of the law . The decision to replace Gonzalez with Carpizo , a veteran of human_rights issues , appeared to be Salinas ' attempt to counter growing condemnation here and abroad of excesses allegedly committed by the army . As head of the National Human_Rights Commission formed by Salinas in 1990 , Carpizo won praise as a tireless advocate as he denounced police torture , extortion and even murder . Last year , Salinas named Carpizo attorney_general . The guerrillas have threatened a wider war -- threats that seemed real after bombs exploded over the weekend at electrical transmission towers , in parking garages and at a Mexico_City military base . Deep in Chiapas , guerrillas were pulling_back Monday into the jungle around Las Margaritas , one of the towns invaded on New Year ' s Day . Ninety hospital workers , whom the guerrillas had seized Dec . 30 in the town of Guadalupe Tepeyac , were released along the road as the guerrillas moved_out . Edmundo Angulo , a truck_driver , said the rebels had used Guadalupe Tepeyac as a transit point to move their troops from Las Margaritas , which they abandoned Jan . 2 , to a town called La Realidad , farther back in the jungle .
