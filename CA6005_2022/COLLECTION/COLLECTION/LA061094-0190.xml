   <HEADLINE> SMALLER TAX CHANGES COULD HAVE BIG IMPACT FOR SOME ; CONGRESS : HEALTH AND WELFARE ARE IN THE SPOTLIGHT , BUT A HOST OF LESS SWEEPING PROPOSALS COULD HIT AMERICANS IN THE POCKETBOOK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The indictment of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski leaves a lot of tax questions hanging_in mid-air . Future uncertainties about the biggest and most sweeping -- health_care and welfare reform -- have been amply aired . But a host of smaller pocketbook issues are hanging_out there , too . Some desirable measures may fall to earth and disintegrate . Other less desirable measures may get enacted and come crashing through the well-hatched savings and investment plans built by many Americans . If you are the type of person who spends part of every day looking upward for a falling sky , watch_out in particular for these atmospherics : * A fix of the &quot; nanny tax. &quot; Both the Senate and the House have passed bills that would raise the threshold of household help ' s income below which employers would not have to pay Social_Security taxes or withhold income_taxes . Currently it stands at $ 50 a quarter -- an amount that pulls_in even the occasional lawn_mower or teen-age baby-sitter and virtually guarantees widespread noncompliance . This is a very popular measure , but the House loves it more_than the Senate . Besides raising the threshold ( under the Senate version , these taxes would have to be paid_for domestic_help earning more_than $ 630 a year ; the House version bumps it all_the way up_to $ 1 # 250 annually ) , the House has generally shown more willingness to approve revenue losers than the Senate . A weakened Ways and Means Committee could lose this provision altogether or easily throw that extra $ 620 a year overboard . * Loophole lost for the property_owner . Congress perpetually looks_at property_owners as a source of tax_income and tries to hone in on the more affluent for tax_hikes . One break that ' s helped property_owners who rent_out their homes ( or secondary homes ) for two weeks or less in a year is about to disappear . This provision allowed owners with rental income for 14 days or less to pocket the income without any tax or reporting consequences . A &quot; technical corrections and simplification &quot; bill which has passed the House but not yet passed the Senate ( though it ' s likely ) would eliminate this break . Homeowners would have to declare the income but could offset taxes by declaring rental expenses up_to the amount of that income . Look_for this to become law regardless of Ways and Means politics . * Succor for the self-employed . Legions of home-office workers are watching Congress for two long_shots that grow longer as the legislative session shortens . Numerous bills would broaden the home-office deduction to accommodate the painters , veterinarians , anesthesiologists and other pros who thought they had the deduction until the Supreme Court tightened it last year . But this revenue loser has yet to find a legislative tree upon which to hang , and Rostenkowski ' s departure makes any new tax provisions much less likely before year ' s end . A second bill , allowing self-employed workers to deduct 100 % of their health_insurance premiums , is wrapped_up in health_care reform and is unlikely to be granted until the big picture is resolved . * Distant threats . Scarier to many taxpayers ( and the industries that sell to them ) are a series of provisions that are always on the back burner but never turned completely off . The Clinton_Administration has its hit list of revenue raisers ; so does Congress and its Congressional Budget Office_staff . Among the tax_breaks always susceptible to cancellation : interest deductions for mortgages on second homes ( seen as a rich_person ' s break ) , tax deferral on annuities ( seen as the insurance industry ' s way of offering back-door retirement_plans under the guise of insurance_policies ) , and any and all benefits that reduce federal estate_taxes . That last category still is seen as one of the least painful ( if of questionable logic ) ways to raise money . Taxpayers who save and invest should remember the golden_rule : Don ' t pick your opportunities by their tax_breaks . While taxes , like death , are certain , deductions are not .</TEXT>
