   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A ; ASSESSING IMMEDIATE EFFECTS ON U.S.-VIETNAM RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton ' s decision to lift the trade_embargo against Vietnam will affect U.S.-Vietnam relations in a variety of ways . Here are answers to some immediate questions raised by the President ' s action Thursday . Q . Now that the 19-year-old embargo has been lifted , what will happen ? A . American businesses are free to trade and invest in Vietnam . Q . How will this affect those of us who live_in Orange County ? A . In many ways : more international trade for businesses here ; more travel , communication and financial transactions between the two countries ; U.S. visitors to Vietnam will have fewer hassles with credit_cards and find a bigger U.S. presence there ; Vietnamese coming_to the United States may face fewer barriers and complications as well . Q . Does this mean we are establishing full diplomatic relations and that the two countries will exchange ambassadors ? A . No , there are many steps left toward normalization , both economic and diplomatic . The United States is only establishing a &quot; liaison office. &quot; This office will assist relations between the two countries and assist U.S. firms doing business . But there remain many laws and restrictions on trade . For instance , this does not give Vietnam any preferential treatment on trade issues such_as &quot; most favored nation &quot; status . Q . Will the lifting of the trade_embargo make_it less complicated for people to travel_to Vietnam ? A . No . Despite President Clinton ' s action , the United States and Vietnam have not resumed diplomatic relations . Consequently , travelers to Vietnam still won ' t be able to get a tourist visa anywhere in the United States . Instead , an application must be made through a travel_agency or the Permanent Mission of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to the United Nations . The request is then forwarded to the Vietnamese consulate in Canada for approval . Finally , if approved , the visa is mailed back to the applicant in the United States . All told , the process takes several weeks . However , officials at the Vietnamese Mission hope to begin issuing visas when and if full normalization occurs . Q . Will it now be easier to travel from Vietnam to the United States ? A . It is still unclear how that will be affected . Since the President ' s action was basically a unilateral move_on the part of the United States , it is too early to tell whether Vietnam will also eventually ease travel restrictions for its nationals . Q . Will it be possible to fly direct from the United States to Vietnam ? A . United Airlines plans to start offering flights between Los Angeles International Airport and Tan ) Son Nhut Airport in Ho Chi Minh City as soon as it can obtain the necessary government approvals . Due_to the great distance , the flights will include a stopover . The Chicago-based airline inherited the rights to the route when it bought Pan American Airlines in 1986 . United officials must now seek the corresponding operating authority from the government of Vietnam . Now that the embargo has been lifted , there are no U.S. regulations prohibiting United from starting service to Vietnam . Q . Will Vietnamese Americans be able to arrange for relatives to immigrate ? A . Until full diplomatic ties are established , strict sponsorship rules still apply . Only a U.S. citizen can petition Vietnam for permission to let a relative come overseas , and only if it is a member of their immediate family . The process is lengthy and can take from 90 days to 10 years , depending_on the individual case . Q . How will the lifting of the embargo affect financial transactions ? A . For one thing , Americans will now be able to use credit_cards to purchase goods in Vietnam . Under the embargo , such transactions were prohibited . If a credit_card was issued by a U.S. bank , Vietnamese residents in the United States have been able to make direct money transfers to relatives in Vietnam since May , 1992 . Many establishments already accept Visa cards issued by non-American banks . Sometime today , American Express is expected to sign an agreement in Hanoi that will permit the use of their charge_card in Vietnam . Q . How will the embargo affect cultural ties between the United States and Vietnam ? A . Many observers believe it is still too early to tell . Cultural exchanges between the two countries have already been occurring on a small scale and there has been a steady easing of restrictions on educational exchange programs . Pirated copies of American-made pop_music and videos are already sold on the black_market in Vietnam . Conversely , videos produced in Vietnam are readily available now in Little Saigon . However , the lifting of the embargo would allow such companies to export a far greater volume of product . Q . Which American companies are most likely to benefit ? A . It truly runs the gamut , but manufacturing , construction and telecommunications companies head the list . Several Fortune 500 companies have been in Vietnam for months , setting_up offices and obtaining the necessary business licenses . Now , these companies have a leg up_on the competition and may begin conducting business freely . Q . What needs to happen before the two countries normalize relations ? A . At a White_House briefing , officials declined to speculate as_to when formal diplomatic relations might be established but the President has said it would only happen once he is satisfied that the POW / MIA issue is resolved . He said the new U.S. liaison office would also continue to monitor human_rights violations . Other negotiations will be ongoing . For example , American and Vietnamese representatives are expected to meet Feb . 15-16 in Hanoi in an attempt to resolve U.S. claims against Vietnam for American property seized by the Vietnamese government . Q . Can citizens now send mail or packages to Vietnam via private postal_services or must they still depend_on the government postal_services of the two countries ? A . Now that there will be commercial trade with Vietnam , yes , private postal_services , such_as Federal Express , could be used . However , some private companies have long been able to deliver packages from the United States by routing them through countries that had trade relations with Vietnam , such_as Great Britain and Singapore .
