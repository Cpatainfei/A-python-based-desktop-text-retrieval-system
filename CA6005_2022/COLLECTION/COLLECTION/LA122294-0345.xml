   <HEADLINE> INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS WIN RULING ; ENERGY : UTILITIES SAY THE PUC ORDER FORCING THEM TO BUY THE ELECTRICITY WILL BOOST CONSUMER RATES . EDISON VOWS TO FILE SUIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a surprisingly tough decision , the California Public_Utilities Commission said Wednesday that it will stick_to its plan to force California ' s investor-owned electric utilities to sign contracts with independent electric-power producers . The decision is a major victory for producers of alternative_energy and is likely to affect utility rates in California for decades to come . The independent producers -- who make electricity from fuels ranging from natural_gas to wind to geothermal heat -- said the ruling could free up financing for $ 1.5 billion worth of construction projects in the state . &quot; We ' re exhilarated , &quot; said Douglas Kerner , an attorney for the Independent Energy Producers Assn . in Sacramento . &quot; The maneuvering of the utilities , and Edison in particular , have cost -- in addition to litigation expense -- essentially a year delay in getting these projects moving. &quot; However , an angry Southern California Edison Co. , which says it doesn ' t need the power , announced that it will sue the commission over the decision -- which the utility says could cost its ratepayers $ 1 billion in higher rates in 1997 through 2003 alone . San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co . said it is also contemplating a lawsuit and that the ruling could cost its ratepayers an extra $ 58 million annually for the life of the contracts , some of which extend for 30 years . SDG &amp; E agrees that it needs more power in the future , but &quot; not at this price . . . . We think the decision is ludicrous , &quot; said Ed Guiles , senior_vice_president of energy supply for the utility . The new power-purchase contracts are the result of a process begun more_than five years ago by the PUC and trace their roots to the state ' s support for alternative domestic energy sources resulting from the oil shocks of the 1970s . In a complex bidding process criticized by the utilities as non-competitive , independent producers and the utilities themselves submitted bids to meet estimated future power needs . The independent producers say the bidding amounted to the first real test of competition in the state ' s electric utility business . The independents submitted the lowest bids , but the process remains hotly contested . The PUC said Wednesday that it will hold a new hearing on details of the bids from wind-energy producers . Much of the debate centers_on how much new energy , if any , the utilities will need in the future -- and at what price . Under the current PUC scheme -- which will probably fall by the wayside later in the decade as the industry is deregulated -- the agency decided what the state ' s investor-owned utilities would need , then designated a portion of those needs for the independent producers to fill . Edison has always said it doesn ' t need the new power that the PUC says it needs . The PUC and the independents say Edison may_not need the power to keep Southern California ' s lights burning , but it does need to replace some older , more expensive generation plants with the cheaper independent power now available with new technologies . Edison executives deny that and say the new contracts would lock customers into long-term higher rates just as deregulation is about to bring power prices down . &quot; We will do whatever we have to do &quot; to avoid signing the contracts , said Don Fellows , Edison manager of non-utility contracts . Wednesday ' s order apparently requires them to be signed before Jan . 30 . Fellows said the utility expects to file suit within days against the commission , charging that it has failed to follow federal law in assessing demand for new electricity .</TEXT>
