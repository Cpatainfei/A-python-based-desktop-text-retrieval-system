   <HEADLINE> MUSIC REVIEW ; THE RETURN OF MSTISLAV ROSTROPOVICH , CELLIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How quickly we forget . In becoming , in the last two decades , a serious international conductor , the celebrated Russian musician , Mstislav Rostropovich , has been touring less with his original instrument , the cello . Music_lovers everywhere may still think_of him as a cellist , yet he has been increasingly less visible and audible in that capacity . Thus , many of the curious , as well as_a_whole generation of young people who have not had the opportunity to hear the beloved Slava -- even strangers call him that , as strangers used to call Gregor Piatigorsky Grisha -- were represented at the cellist ' s return to Southern California ( after three years ) Saturday night at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts . Few could have gone_away disappointed . Rostropovich may_not now maintain his characteristic -- sometimes criticized -- fever pitch of intensity through every second of a performance , but that light shines brightly nonetheless . And technically , notwithstanding occasional moments of inconsistent vibrato or vagaries of pitch , his mastery remains complete . Again assisted by pianist Lambert Orkis , the cellist offered a provocative program . A piece put_together just for this tour , Alfred Schnittke ' s arrangement -- for cello , piano and tape -- of the Epilogue to his own ballet , &quot; Peer Gynt &quot; ( 1986 ) , provided the climactic half hour of this recital . It was a stunner . Schnittke ' s unique eclecticism -- alternating a harrowing atonality with a pungent and haunting tonal idiom -- makes this piece both grating and engrossing . Rostropovich / Orkis performed it with kaleidoscopic eloquence . They did as much with the wondrous Debussy Sonata ( 1915 ) , finding all_the insouciance and contrasts sometimes left buried in this enigmatic score . At the beginning , the team tried to make a case for Richard Strauss ' early ( and empty ) Sonata ( 1882 ) , a losing battle despite all their goodwill and affection . Then , alone , Rostropovich accepted the myriad challenges in Bach ' s C-minor Suite for unaccompanied cello . This was not a labored reading , yet it moved slowly , and often without the soloist ' s remembered elan .</TEXT>
