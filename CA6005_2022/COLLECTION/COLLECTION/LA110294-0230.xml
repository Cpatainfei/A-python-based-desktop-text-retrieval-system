   <HEADLINE> INDIA ACCUSES PAKISTAN OF ABETTING MUSLIM KIDNAPERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Indian authorities , basking Tuesday in the liberation of one American and three British tourists who had been held hostage -- one for more_than a month -- implicated enemy neighbor Pakistan in the abductions . Muslim militants seized the Westerners in New Delhi after winning their confidence with bogus stories . They then threatened to behead them if fighters jailed for combatting Indian rule_in the predominantly Muslim state of Jammu and Kashmir were not freed . Indian authorities squarely blamed Pakistanis and Afghans for the hostage-taking and announced five arrests . &quot; The people whose release were sought are foreign nationals , &quot; Home_Secretary Kantipuri Padmanabhaiah said . &quot; The people who have been picked_up are foreign nationals . They have spread their nets to places like Delhi and Ghaziabad and Saharanpur . It shows how the tentacles have spread. &quot; It was a dramatic , and probably quite deliberate , Indian answer to Pakistan ' s intense diplomatic campaign to rally world support for its own position on Kashmir , which it claims is being subjected_to brutal Indian repression and should by rights be Pakistani territory . Ushered to Padmanabhaiah ' s side at the news_conference , the three Britons , who had been freed only about 15 hours earlier , and American Bela Josef Nuss of Walnut Creek , Calif. , painted a frightening picture of their time in captivity . They were asked if they were dealt with well . &quot; As well as you can be treated when you ' re chained to a floor like animals , &quot; Rhys Partridge , 27 , replied . The young Britons were kept together in a single room , although they were_well fed and had access to books , cards and a chess_set . They were not physically harmed , they said . Partridge was kidnaped Sept . 29 , and Paul Ridout and Miles Croston , who had just set_off on a long trip , fell_into the abductors ' trap Oct . 16 . Police said Nuss was kidnaped Oct . 20 and held separately . In letters Monday to the_British Broadcasting Corp . and the Voice of America , the kidnapers identified themselves as a previously unknown group called Al Hadid and demanded the release of 10 people . Padmanabhaiah disclosed that the government had received a similar letter Friday demanding the release of six people , including Pakistani nationals and Afghans implicated in the Kashmiri unrest . Whether foreigners were involved in the kidnapings is important , because India maintains that the separatist insurrection , which has led to at least 10 # 000 deaths in the past four years , has been kept alive only because of the involvement of Pakistan ' s government and of mercenaries or volunteers from Afghanistan . Pakistan acknowledges giving moral support to fellow Muslims fighting Indian rule_in Kashmir , but it claims that the separatist struggle is spontaneous and has not been encouraged by Pakistani arms shipments or logistics support .</TEXT>
