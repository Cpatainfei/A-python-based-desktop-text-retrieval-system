   <HEADLINE> PRO-ISLAM PARTY STUNS TURKEY , WINS KEY VOTES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cries of &quot; Allahu Akbar ! &quot; -- God is great ! -- greeted the news Tuesday that the pro-Islamic Welfare Party had captured the mayor ' s seat in Ankara , Turkey ' s capital , in one of a series of municipal election victories that have shaken the 70-year-old republic to its secular roots . Shocked Turks have been glued to television_sets since Sunday ' s election , watching in disbelief as this nation ' s electoral_system handed more_than one-third of Turkey ' s provincial centers to the Islamists , including the biggest city and financial_center , Istanbul . As the leftist vote collapsed , the Islamists did unexpectedly well among recent arrivals in big cities ; they appear to have been fed up with a corrupt political Establishment that has failed to manage Turkey ' s inflation and mounting economic_crisis . But more_than 80 % of Turks did not vote for the Welfare Party , and many expressed great worry about the intrusion of religion in politics . The Islamists , for example , challenge Turkey ' s membership in the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , its application to join the European Union and the very basis of the republic set_up in 1923 by Kemal Ataturk along modernizing , Western , secular lines . But more sage commentators are urging Turks and their Western allies not to panic or to think that this conservative , Sunni Muslim country will go_down the Islamic revolutionary path chosen by its neighbors in Shiite Muslim Iran . The election &quot; is an earthquake shaking republican Turkey . But it should not be exaggerated . The Welfare did not present itself as a party advocating the introduction of Islamic Sharia law , &quot; wrote Gungor Mengi , chief commentator of the newspaper Sabah . Analysts also noted that Turkish mayors are not as powerful as_many are in the United States . They have no control , for example , over education , police or liquor licensing laws . In the bigger picture , the polls have strengthened Prime_Minister Tansu Ciller ' s position , showing that her conservative True Path Party is Turkey ' s biggest , with 22 % voter support . Turkey ' s first female prime_minister and her 9-month-old coalition government with the Social Democrats can probably now continue in power until the next parliamentary elections in 1996 .</TEXT>
