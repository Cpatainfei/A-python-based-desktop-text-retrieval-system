   <HEADLINE> AS RABIN , HUSSEIN CELEBRATE PACT , MIDEAST FOCUS SHIFTS ; DIPLOMACY : CLINTON PLEDGES TO REWARD ' RISKS ' BY OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION . HE MENTIONS SYRIA SPECIFICALLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan ' s King Hussein took a victory lap through Congress and the White_House on Tuesday to celebrate the end of hostility between their countries . But the harsh realities of the Middle_East quickly changed the focus to continuing disputes such_as those between Israel and Syria . Standing between Rabin and Hussein at a White_House news_conference , President Clinton pledged American support to countries that &quot; take risks for peace , &quot; a formula that translates into financial relief now for Jordan and future diplomatic rewards for Syria if Damascus makes_peace with Israel . &quot; I spoke yesterday with President ( Hafez ) Assad of Syria to reaffirm my personal dedication to achieving a comprehensive peace , &quot; Clinton said . He said Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher will resume his Damascus-Jerusalem shuttle diplomacy soon . American and Israeli officials were encouraged by Assad ' s decision to let Syria ' s government-operated television provide live broadcasts of the Rabin-Hussein ceremonies , a sharp contrast with its usual practice of mentioning Israel only in harshly critical terms . Mordechai Gur , Israel ' s deputy defense minister and a close associate of Rabin ' s , said the broadcast may be the first_step in a campaign to prepare Syrian public_opinion for eventual peace with Israel . During almost three years of negotiations , Assad has made_it clear that he expects improved relations with the United States as a payoff if he reaches a settlement with Israel . Clinton said that Washington is ready to reward any government that moves toward peace . &quot; We will support leaders whose boldness and wisdom are creating a new Middle_East , &quot; the President said . &quot; Today I have reaffirmed to Prime_Minister Rabin that as Israel moves forward in the peace process , the constant responsibility of the United States will be to help ensure its security . I have also reaffirmed to King Hussein my determination to assist Jordan in dealing with its burden of debt and its defense requirements. &quot; Jordan wants relief from its $ 700-million debt to the United States , and it wants new American weaponry to modernize its military . Clinton said he will confer_with Congress &quot; to achieve rapid action on both these matters. &quot; In the wake of a car_bomb explosion outside the Israeli Embassy in London on Tuesday , of Panamanian authorities ' disclosure that a commuter plane crash that killed 21 people last week had been caused by a bomb and of last week ' s terrorist attack in Buenos Aires that killed 96 , the news_conference focused largely on terrorism . Clinton , Rabin and Hussein agreed that recent violent incidents were intended to derail the peace process . Hussein denounced terrorists as &quot; enemies of life , enemies of human relations between human_beings , enemies of hope , enemies of security , enemies of what should be normal among people. &quot; &quot; Nothing irritates me more or is more painful to me than to witness and see acts and attitudes attributed to Islam that have nothing to do with Islam , my faith and my religion , &quot; he said . For his part , Rabin said that &quot; extreme , radical Islamic terrorist movements ( are waging ) all-out war . . . against the possibility of the solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. &quot; Earlier , Rabin and Hussein addressed a rare joint meeting of Congress with speeches so similar in tone that they appeared to be mirror_images . Both men described themselves as former soldiers , each reminisced about a lifetime spent under the cloud of Arab-Israeli hostility , and both mourned those who died in wars between the neighboring countries . &quot; I , who served my country for 27 years as a soldier , say to you . . . today we are embarking_on a battle which has no dead and no wounded , no blood and no anguish , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; This is the only battle which is a pleasure to wage : the battle for peace. &quot; For his part , Hussein said : &quot; I come_before you today as a soldier who seeks to bear arms solely in the defense of his homeland , a man who understands the fears of his neighbors and who wishes only to live_in peace with them. &quot; It was the first time that two heads of government had addressed the lawmakers during the same session , and the speeches were interrupted repeatedly by vigorous applause . Perhaps the warmest ovation came_after Hussein said simply , &quot; Mr. Speaker , the state_of_war between Israel and Jordan is over . &quot; The two Semitic people , the Arabs and the Jews , have endured bitter trials and tribulations during the journey of history , &quot; he said . &quot; I come_before you today fully conscious of the need to secure a peace for all_the children of Abraham. &quot; Rabin observed : &quot; Walls of hostilities have been built_on the River Jordan which runs between us . You in Amman and we in Jerusalem must bring_down those barriers and walls , must solve those concrete problems. &quot; Hussein , seeming to blink back tears , nodded in_agreement . Emphasizing the shared geography of the two states carved out of the old British mandate of Palestine , Rabin said : &quot; The Middle_East that was a valley of the shadow of death will become a place where it is a pleasure to live . We live_on the same stretch of land ; the same rain nourishes our soil ; the same hot wind parches our fields . We find shade under the same fig_tree . We savor the fruit of the same green vine ; we drink from the same well. &quot; It was the first time that a Jordanian leader had addressed Congress and the first time that an Arab head_of_state had spoken_to a joint meeting since Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1975 . It was Rabin ' s second speech to a joint meeting of Congress , following one in 1976 . Both leaders referred repeatedly to religion and the common heritage of Jews , Muslims and Christians . As he neared the end of his speech , Rabin whipped a black yarmulke from his pocket and read a traditional benediction in Hebrew . Times staff writer William J . Eaton contributed to this report .</TEXT>
