Neighbors said Sunday that Montiel and the teen-ager had been living_on the property for about six months . One neighbor said a lot of young_men with &quot; skinheads and tattoos all_over their bodies &quot; come and went from the residence &quot; at all hours. &quot; &quot; There were a lot of late-night parties and people there all_the time , &quot; said the neighbor . &quot; They would smoke outside on the patio because the landlord does not allow smoking inside the house. &quot; Neighbors said that despite the constant traffic , they did not suspect that anything illegal was going_on . &quot; It ' s weird because I live right next door , &quot; he said . &quot; This is an absolutely beautiful neighborhood and I ' ve been here for 10 years .
