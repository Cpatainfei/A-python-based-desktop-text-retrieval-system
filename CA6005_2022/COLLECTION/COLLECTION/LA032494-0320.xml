   <HEADLINE> FERRETING OUT THE TRUTH ; DEBATE RAGES ON WHETHER CALIFORNIA SHOULD MAKE THE NATURAL PREDATOR ( WHO IS ALSO SOFT AND PLAYFUL ) A LEGAL PET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They are either the silkiest , most playful and affectionate pets you could ever hope to have , or they ' re beady-eyed little hellions just waiting for nature ' s cue to ravage a chicken_coop or gnaw a baby ' s ear to shreds . And soon , you may be able to have one of your very own . Whatever the opinion , it ' s certain that the common domesticated ferret is definitely capable of sowing confusion in the halls of government . Illegal in California since 1935 , ferrets may soon be able to curl_up on your couch with the full blessing of the law if the State Assembly passes a bill that would allow Californians to own ferrets as pets . But not every lawmaker loves them . The bill , which was recently passed_by the Water , Parks and Wildlife Committee , ignited polarized debate in Sacramento . Were ferrets gentle and fun-loving , or were they a domesticated version of a centuries-old ferocious predator ? Think_of &quot; Kindergarten Cop &quot; as a metaphor for the Great Ferret Debate . In the film , tough-guy cop turned kindergarten teacher Arnold Schwarzenegger charms the kids with his obligingly gentle and lovable pet ferret . The kids pet it . The ferret loves it . In the end , however , the ferret leaps at the bad_guy and bites him in the neck , allowing Arnold to fill him full of lead . So , how about it ? Do you name your ferret Fluffy or Beelzebub ? Wildlife authorities are less than wild about ferrets . Yes , they say , ferrets are natural predators . And , left to their natural instincts in the wild , that ' s what they ' ll do . &quot; They were developed in Europe as a hunting animal , &quot; said Bob Schlichting , a spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Game . &quot; They ' re kind of cuddly , and they have nice , mink-like fur , but they can be very vicious . Our main objection is that they ' re not native to California , and we ' d hate for a non-native population to establish itself ( in the wild ) . They ' re very efficient hunters and could wipe_out poultry and rabbit farms and compete with other natural predators here. &quot; Ferrets , Schlichting said , were used for centuries to flush rabbits and rodents from burrows , but that wasn ' t all they were capable of attacking . &quot; There have been lots of reports , &quot; he said , &quot; of ferrets getting_into henhouses and killing everything in_sight , almost like the feeding frenzy we associate with sharks . Ferrets will kill far beyond what they can eat . It ' s just the sort of animal they are. &quot; Not so , said Bob Tetreault , the general_manager of Orange County-based Russo ' s Pets and a dedicated ferret fancier who raised ferrets in New Hampshire . &quot; They ' re a wonderful pet , &quot; he said , &quot; a great pet . The reason they ' re not legal is that legislators don ' t have a clue as_to what they ' re talking_about . People are under the impression that the ferret is a wild animal that people are trying to domesticate , but they ' re not . The European ferret we ' re talking_about has been domestic as long as the domestic_cat . &quot; People say they ' re going to take_over the countryside . that ' s not the case . New Zealand tried to establish feral colonies of ferrets to control rodents , but the ferrets would n ' t hunt . They even dropped food to them . But they died in the wild . They aren ' t used to hunting . There are thousands of ferrets kept as pets in this state , and you don ' t see them in the wild. &quot; Many thousands , in fact . Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith ( R-Poway ) , the sponsor of the ferret bill , estimated that between 100 # 000 and 500 # 000 ferrets are illegally owned in the state . ( Ferrets are legal in all states except California , Hawaii , Massachusetts and Michigan. ) Because the owners know they are keeping an illegal pet , they are reluctant to approach veterinarians about proper treatment for the animals . The bill is backed by the California Veterinary Medical Assn . for that reason , he said . Where are all those ferrets coming from ? Either from an extensive and established black_market in animals ( everything from parrots to exotic cats ) , or from neighboring states such_as Nevada and Arizona , said Richard Evans , a veterinarian from Laguna Niguel . Evans , who has raised and sold ferrets outside of California and who is the medical director of the Laguna Niguel-based Pacific Wildlife Project , said ferrets make_good pets but require special care . &quot; They ' re playful little guys , &quot; said Evans , who , during a tenure at Ralston Purina , developed one of the company ' s more specific foods : Purina Ferret Chow . &quot; There ' s some issue about them biting , but their bite is no worse than that of a kitten . They ' re good pets to the right person , but you have to take_care to make your house ferret-proof . They like to get_into all kinds of things . And you have to take_care that they don ' t get out. &quot; They ' re not for everyone , said Kent Yamaguchi , curator of education for the Santa Ana Zoo . &quot; Ferrets are very intelligent and easy to train if you have one with the right temperament , &quot; he said . &quot; But if they ' re harassed , or their psychological well-being isn ' t taken_care of -- just like any smart animal -- they can nip or bite . They ' re real fun to play with , but they have their special needs. &quot; The zoo , said Yamaguchi , used to keep a ferret that was exhibited at schools as part of the Zoomobile program ( permits for ferrets can legally be issued to exhibitors , trainers and other professionals ) . However the ferret is no longer a zoo resident . &quot; We felt we were giving a double message to the kids , &quot; Yamaguchi said . &quot; It would be ' Isn ' t this a great animal ? You can ' t have it. ' If ferrets were made legal , though , there would be the possibility that we would use one in our Zoomobile program. &quot; People continue to be curious about ferrets as pets . Forrest De Spain , the director of the Orange County Zoo at Irvine Regional Park , said that &quot; a significant amount of people come_through here and say they have a brother or a cousin who has a ferret . They ' ll also say they saw a ferret in ' Kindergarten Cop. ' &quot; &quot; You can never thoroughly domesticate them , &quot; Schlichting said . &quot; They ' re cute and cuddly , but they can turn_on you. &quot; In particular , he said , infants may be at risk . Ferrets , he said , will not attack an infant without provocation , but &quot; babies can make sounds and movements that are similar to young prey &quot; of ferrets . &quot; They can inflict bites with machine gun-like rapidity , up one arm and down the other , nibbling real quickly. &quot; A summary of a 1988 study of ferret attacks on humans by the California Department of Health Services is even more graphic . While acknowledging their popularity as pets and their playful nature , the report said that &quot; ferret play frequently assumes the form of mock attacks , which may result in bites to humans . . . . Infants . . . may suffer severe injury as a result of ferret attacks . . . . The animals have been reported to then drink the victim ' s blood and eat the shredded tissue. &quot; The Department of Health Services reported that there have been 60 cases in 10 years nationwide of children being bitten by ferrets . However , Evans said that the danger is likely exaggerated . &quot; Like any animal , they need supervision around young children , &quot; Evans said . &quot; It ' s a very individualistic thing , but as a general rule I ' d say that it was inappropriate to label ferrets as a nasty animal that likes to bite people , especially young children. &quot; Tetreault was more emphatic . &quot; About ferrets biting infants , I don ' t understand the whole argument on that , &quot; he said . &quot; You would n ' t leave any animal alone with an infant , with both of them on_the_loose . Why would you do that ? It ' s common_sense to have adult supervision when you ' re dealing with animals . All pets can bite . Parrots bite . Dogs_bite . Cats bite . These things can happen . But the chances of being seriously wounded by a ferret are small. &quot; And what if the bill passes ? What can would-be legal ferret owners expect ? Tetreault said that some ferrets might be sold by private parties for between $ 25 and $ 50 , and a pet store might charge $ 100 for one that has been de-scented ( ferrets can emit a musky scent , but the scent glands can be surgically removed ) . They ' ll eat cat_food and vegetables ( and , of course , Ferret Chow ) &quot; and you can potty-train them like a cat , &quot; Tetreault said . &quot; And they ' ll play for hours . Mine would come when I called him . They ' re very social animals. &quot;</TEXT>
