   <HEADLINE> 2 DIE IN SARAJEVO SHELLING ON DAY BEFORE SLATED CEASE-FIRE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two people died as shells slammed into a Sarajevo marketplace Thursday , a day before a cease-fire brokered by former U.S. President Jimmy_Carter was_due to take_effect . The shelling occurred an hour before the U.N. ' s special envoy , Yasushi Akashi , arrived in Sarajevo for talks on the cease-fire and ensuing negotiations between the Bosnian government and Bosnian Serb separatist leaders . Seven people were injured in the market shelling . Another person was killed and five more were wounded in shelling of the northwest town of Bihac , a U.N.-declared &quot; safe area. &quot; The violence underscored the difficulty facing any cease-fire in the 32-month-old war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and served as a reminder that many previous efforts to end the fighting have failed . &quot; It is a bad sign for the cease-fire , &quot; Bosnian Vice_President Ejup Ganic said of the shelling . &quot; We are very disappointed . Nevertheless , we are pushing for a cease-fire , and we hope we get a cease-fire. &quot; A new truce is scheduled to go_into effect at noon today , and the United Nations is trying to start talks between the Bosnian government and its Serbian foes on a longer truce . Akashi traveled_to Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale , a village 12 miles southeast of Sarajevo , after talks with the Bosnian government . He returned to Sarajevo , saying there still are a_few issues to be resolved before a cease-fire agreement can be signed . The problems appeared to focus_on U.N. monitoring of the cease-fire , and Akashi said he hopes to have them resolved and an agreement signed today . Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic said he had issued orders for his men to cease fire today even if Muslim troops do not withdraw from the strategic Mt . Igman in time for signing a truce accord . &quot; We do not make_it a precondition for the start of the cease-fire , &quot; Karadzic told reporters after meeting Akashi . Referring to the Muslim withdrawal from Mt . Igman , Karadzic added : &quot; We understand the withdrawal of Muslim troops should be completed by tomorrow noon , but if it is technically difficult we will wait one or two days. &quot; U.N. officials did not say who was to blame for Thursday ' s market shelling , but the site is just below Serbian-held Mt . Trebevic . Bosnian Serbs denied firing the projectiles . In a statement , the Bosnian Serb military accused the Muslim-led government of the attack , claiming that it wanted to influence public_opinion and sabotage peace talks .</TEXT>
