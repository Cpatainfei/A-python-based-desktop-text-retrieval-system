   <HEADLINE> THE TOAST OF NEW YORK ? ( OR WILL HE BE JUST TOAST ? ) ; THE L.A. PHILHARMONIC HASN ' T PLAYED THE BIG APPLE IN FOUR YEARS , AND NEVER WITH ESA-PEKKA SALONEN . NEITHER CONDUCTOR NOR ORCHESTRA HAS EVER BEEN THE TOAST OF THE TOWN , SO WHAT MAKES THEM THINK NEXT WEEK WILL BE ANY DIFFERENT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Los Angeles Philharmonic comes_to Lincoln Center ' s Avery Fisher Hall next week , its first visit to New York in four years and its first trip here with its music_director , Esa-Pekka Salonen . Once more , the orchestra joins the great New York musical jostle for recognition . The parade of orchestras visiting New York this season has already included the Boston Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra ( both of which offer short seasons here ) , the Pittsburgh Symphony , the St . Louis Symphony , the Houston Symphony , Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal , along with orchestras from St . Petersburg , London , Osaka , Weimar , Wales and Slovakia . And the season is only 2 months old . Still to come are dozens more orchestras , from Oslo to Austria , from Cincinnati to Costa Rica . They come because the record business is still based here , because the music management companies are here , and because New York reviews help sell tickets and please boards at_home . Many orchestras make regular annual visits , coming here with their own well-oiled publicity machines operating at full tilt , and they get additional publicity support from either Lincoln Center or Carnegie Hall -- the two major New York concert venues . Some even hire private local public relations firms for further hype expertise . The competition for attention is steep , and New York , of course , has its own several orchestras , including two world-class ones -- the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra . How , then , can any single orchestra -- or at least any orchestra that is not the Vienna Philharmonic or the Concertgebouw -- really make much of an impact in such a climate ? Especially given the fact that space in the local newspapers and magazines ( all_of which have reduced classical_music coverage , some drastically , in recent years ) is at a premium . The fight ( and it really has become just that ) for big audiences has become tougher than ever . Can the Los Angeles Philharmonic , which hasn ' t performed in New York for four years , compete ? Apparently it can and will . A surprising amount of attention seems to surround the upcoming appearances in Fisher Hall next Sunday and Nov . 28 , since they will be not only the orchestra ' s first New York appearances under Esa-Pekka Salonen but the start of an annual pilgrimage by the orchestra and its music_director to Lincoln Center . Both the New Yorker and the New York Times , the two most influential publications in town , have commissioned pieces on Salonen . If anything is likely to produce a buzz , such a rare double publicity whammy should . But what makes this interest especially noteworthy is the fact that New York has in recent years not shown much enthusiasm for the Philharmonic , for its previous three music_directors , for other conductors closely associated with it , or for Salonen . Andre Previn , who lives_in nearby Westchester County , is now a regular in New York , guest conducting the New York Philharmonic and Orchestra of St . Luke ' s , appearing in chamber_music , but he tends to generate cool respect and is no longer a hot box-office draw . Carlo Maria Giulini , however beloved internationally , never had much of a presence in New York . Zubin Mehta , who left the Los Angeles Philharmonic to become music_director of the New York Philharmonic , remained here for 13 years , after which time the press had become decidedly hostile toward him , and the orchestra , itself , dispirited . Although Mehta is not regularly invited back to conduct the New York Philharmonic , he does return regularly with the Israel Philharmonic , and he does retain a public . Nor has the Los Angeles Philharmonic had much better luck with former principal guest conductors who toured with it . Simon Rattle , one of the most admired conductors in Europe and elsewhere in the United States , has conducted little in New York , and his couple of appearances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic or his own highly regarded City of Birmingham Orchestra did not leave a lasting impression . Michael Tilson Thomas , once a regular in the city , now seldom appears . Kurt Sanderling , much revered in Los Angeles and Europe , was somewhat dismissed in New York . Salonen , himself , has not had any better luck in New York . He , too , has practically no presence here , outside of his recordings . Eight years ago he guest conducted the New York Philharmonic , generated no sparks , and was not invited back . Three seasons ago , Salonen returned with the Swedish Radio Orchestra to no better acclaim . But Salonen has little to say about such matters : &quot; I am looking_forward to returning to New York , especially since these will be the first concerts I conduct in New York with the Los Angeles Philharmonic , &quot; he cautiously remarked during a break between rehearsals with the orchestra last week . &quot; I know the players anticipate our New York concerts , and the prospect of returning regularly in the future to play for New York audiences is especially appealing for both them and me. &quot; It is never clear why a city as complex and chaotic as New York acts the way it does , whether in matters of politics , social attitudes , eating habits , fashion trends or the arts . But this time , several factors_in play seem to have the potential to change New York ' s outlook on the Los Angeles Philharmonic . The first is canny planning on the orchestra ' s part . &quot; We ' ve purposely waited with Esa-Pekka until he and the orchestra have had time to settle_down and get_to know each other , &quot; explains Ernest Fleischmann , managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic . It is a strategy that appears likely to work , given the fact that New York is hungry for exciting young conductors . Last year both Kent Nagano and Russian conductor Valery Gergiev had startling successes , although in previous seasons they had not attracted nearly such attention . Many have their eyes on Franz Welser-Most . Among established conductors , Colin Davis , on the rare occasions he can be enticed here , is a much-admired figure , and so , too , is Pierre Boulez , now that a_couple_of decades have passed since his troubled music directorship of the New York Philharmonic . But beyond that , it is hard to find a conductor , young or old , who is much of a draw -- more often it is the orchestra , soloist or repertoire that attracts the main attention . Moreover , while sophisticated New Yorkers might like to think themselves aloof from some of Salonen ' s more obvious attractions -- his youth and good looks -- they have been known to be seduced . Salonen will also have some of the same advantages that Nagano , Gergiev and Welser-Most have had , namely an aggressive push from his record company , Sony Classical . Unlike many American cities , the New York audience for concerts and recordings overlaps , and Salonen comes_to town with many acclaimed recordings with the Los Angeles Philharmonic . In addition , Sony has released two new compact_discs to coincide with the tour , including the premiere recording of Witold Lutoslawski ' s Fourth Symphony , which will be getting its New York premiere . Sony will also actively promote Salonen , including throwing a luncheon to introduce him to the press . Fleischmann also has had some good_luck on his side this time around . It so happens that the two Philharmonic dates -- the Sunday and Monday following Thanksgiving -- offer few conflicts to music_lovers or press . There are no important events at Carnegie Hall at that time . At Lincoln Center , in the smaller Alice Tully Hall , the popular American soprano Sylvia McNair offers a recital at_the_same_time as the Philharmonic ' s Sunday matinee ; Monday night the Metropolitan Opera performs &quot; Don Giovanni , &quot; but it is not a new production or a first night . This really is sheer luck . The Philharmonic ' s two-week tour -- which begins in Mexico_City on Tuesday , moves_on to Washington Saturday night , and follows New York with four days in Florida -- is planned , according to Fleischmann , because Thanksgiving tends to be a slow time at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion . Moreover , December , while always the slowest month for visiting orchestras in New York , is unusually uncluttered this year ( only the Oslo Symphony at Carnegie Hall ) , which means that if the Philharmonic makes a good impression , it is likely to be_better remembered . But what may also most affect the Philharmonic ' s reception is that New York itself is a changed town from what it once was . Both the New York Times and the New Yorker have changed chief music_critics since the last time the Philharmonic was in town , and both have shown considerable interest in the Philharmonic . The Times ' Edward Rothstein has traveled_to Los Angeles the past two seasons to review the orchestra ( although neither time when Salonen was conducting ) , and the New Yorker ' s Paul Griffiths has also spent time in Los Angeles preparing his piece on Salonen . Moreover , a sampling of past New York Times Philharmonic reviews indicates that they have not been all that harsh , simply a bit lackluster . For instance , when the Philharmonic last visited New York , it had a prestigious date , the opening concert of Carnegie ' s 100th season . Donal Henahan , then the chief Times critic , wrote that performances under Previn were &quot; hardly different from what might be encountered from a visiting orchestra on almost any night during an ordinary Carnegie season &quot; but seemed a bit pallid only because this was supposed to be a gala occasion . Ten years earlier , Peter G . Davis , now music_critic for New York magazine , wrote that &quot; excellent though it may be in many departments , ( the Los Angeles Philharmonic ) is not a virtuoso orchestra. &quot; It was good_enough , however , for Davis to find in a performance of Tchaikovsky ' s &quot; Pathetique , &quot; under Giulini , that &quot; expressive intensity was achieved with utmost discretion and fastidious attention to detail. &quot; The New York press is not , in fact , really quite so tough as its reputation . Very few reviews of any major orchestra are outright pans . But while those reviews may sound just fine at_home , many in New York view a modest success as no success at all , since it will do nothing to make an orchestra stand_out from the crowd . It is also a myth that there is , particularly these days , a unified voice or attitude in the press . But too_much hype always presents a danger . If a major publication takes too emphatic a stand , it is a sure bet that some_other publication will find the need to react to that . And New York would hardly be New York if it didn ' t push its visitors around , at least a little . It is no secret that Previn and the Philharmonic did not part amicably , so could it be just a coincidence that at McNair ' s Tully recital , the same hour as the Philharmonic ' s Sunday concert , the soprano will sing the premiere of four new songs by Previn to texts of Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison ? * The Los Angeles Philharmonic performs next Sunday at 3 p.m. and Nov . 28 at 8 p.m. at Avery Fisher Hall , New York .</TEXT>
