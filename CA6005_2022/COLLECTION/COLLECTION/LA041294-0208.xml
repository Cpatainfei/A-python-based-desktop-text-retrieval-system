   <HEADLINE> YOUR BODY / KATHLEEN DOHENY : NEW DRUGS EXPAND THE OPTIONS FOR RELIEVING MONTHLY CRAMPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They ' re a monthly pain for half the women of childbearing age and an occasional bugaboo for the other half . Although there ' s no magic wand to make menstrual cramps disappear , their causes are now better understood . As a result , there are more treatment options than ever . And if one doesn ' t work , chances are another will . * The Research : Menstrual cramps , described as a feeling of dull achiness or pressure in the lower abdomen , are associated with prostaglandins , natural substances made in many parts of the body . Although researchers began discussing prostaglandins decades ago , there is still much to learn . When it comes_to menstrual cramps , however , prostaglandins in the endometrium -- the membrane lining the uterus -- are believed to be the culprit . As menstruation approaches , production and release of these prostaglandins increase . This leads to uterine_contractions and the resulting pain . * The Sorority : &quot; Half of women who menstruate have some menstrual pain one or two days a month , &quot; says Alice Kirkman , spokeswoman for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . For one in 10 women , the pain is so severe that daily activities would have to be curtailed if not for medication . Cramps are likely to be most severe in teen-agers and to lessen with age . But not always . Women who have given_birth tend to have fewer problems with cramps , at least temporarily . It might be_due to uterine changes associated with childbirth , says Dr. Penny Wise Budoff , an assistant_professor of obstetrics-gynecology ( family practice ) at Cornell University who has researched cramps . If you ' ve had few problems with cramps but suddenly develop them in your 20s , 30s or 40s , consult a doctor , says Budoff , who also directs a Long_Island women ' s health center affiliated with Northshore University Hospital . Later onset of cramps could be a tip-off to such abnormalities as fibroid tumors or endometriosis ( in which uterine-like tissue is found outside the uterus , often in the ovaries and other pelvic areas ) . * The &quot; Two Birds &quot; Approach : Women who need contraception and have cramps often get a twofer by using oral_contraceptives , which have been shown to reduce cramps in 90 % of women . * Other Routes to Relief : Many women reach first for aspirin , acetaminophen or special &quot; menstrual relief &quot; medicines , many of which contain acetaminophen . For more painful cramps , most doctors and pharmacists now recommend a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory_drug ( NSAID ) such_as Advil or Motrin . &quot; Any nonsteroidal that will work for arthritis will work for cramps , &quot; says Sylvia Curry , director of pharmacy at Century City Hospital . Like aspirin , NSAIDs work by inhibiting prostaglandin production . &quot; If one ( over-the-counter medicine ) doesn ' t work , try another , &quot; Budoff suggests . &quot; If a nonsteroidal upsets the stomach , take it with food , &quot; Curry adds . * Stronger Stuff : When over-the-counter_drugs aren ' t enough , some doctors recommend prescription_drugs . Among those frequently prescribed are Ponstel ( mefenamic_acid ) and Anaprox ( naproxen_sodium ) , both NSAIDs . * On the Horizon : This spring , an over-the-counter version of Anaprox , called Aleve , will be_on the market , says Linda Thomas of Syntex Corp . in Palo Alto . Each Aleve tablet contains 220 milligrams of naproxen_sodium , the same active ingredients as in Anaprox . By prescription , the tablets come_in 275 or 550 milligrams . * Natural Routes : Herbal remedies for cramp relief are available at health_food stores . Although some women swear by the formulas , Budoff recommends caution , noting that growing and harvesting methods may vary . &quot; You really don ' t know what you ' re getting , &quot; she says . Regular exercise and a nutritious diet seem to minimize problems with cramps , she adds . * Timetable : Whatever pain medication you choose , take it when the pain starts or a bit before you expect it , experts suggest , so you can nip it in early stages . Cramps usually begin several hours before or just after the onset of the period , with the first one to two days normally the most uncomfortable .</TEXT>
