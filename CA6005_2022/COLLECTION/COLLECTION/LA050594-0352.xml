   <HEADLINE> STATE ARGUES CLAS TEST DOES NOT REQUIRE CONSENT ; COURTS : EDUCATION_DEPARTMENT FILES BRIEF IN LAWSUIT BY PARENTS , SAYING THE EXAM DOES NOT INVADE PRIVACY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State_Department of Education officials Wednesday fought_back at critics of the California Learning Assessment System tests , filing a legal_brief in a Los Angeles lawsuit brought by opponents seeking to require parental permission for the tests . In winning court permission to intervene in the lawsuit brought last week against the Los Angeles Unified School District , the education_department has its first opportunity to respond to allegations that the test violates state and federal laws against invasion_of_privacy , the department ' s top attorney said . &quot; We believe firmly that the CLAS tests do not require ( parental ) consent . It ' s a reading and writing test , not a Masters and Johnson-type survey , &quot; said Joseph R . Symkowick , the department ' s general counsel . More_than two_dozen suits have been filed against school districts statewide in which parents and religious groups have complained that the exam questions pry into students ' personal lives . Plaintiffs in most cases have received legal help from one or the other of two organizations , the Escondido-based United States Justice Foundation and the Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville , Va . The groups allege that the language arts portions of the tests , now being administered to more_than 1 million public_school students in grades four , five , eight and 10 , require prior written parental permission because they ask students to divulge personal matters . The privacy question has become a big issue in the tests , which like other standardized exams are kept confidential to preserve their fairness and effectiveness . Although the state has allowed school_board members to review test questions under certain circumstances , the department has fought public dissemination of the tests and has felt hampered in its efforts to dispel rumors . The state Education Code provides that &quot; no test , questionnaire , survey or examination containing any questions about the pupil ' s personal beliefs or practices in sex , family life , morality and religion , or any questions about his parents ' or guardians ' beliefs and practices in sex , family life , morality and religion , shall be administered &quot; to anyone in kindergarten through 12th grade without written permission from a parent or guardian . The Los Angeles suit is significant , the state lawyers said , because it is the first to explore the issues themselves -- the nature of the questions and whether they invade privacy . In other cases , judges have ruled on restraining orders but have not held hearings on the issues in the suits . Judge Robert O ' Brien , who has asked to examine copies of this year ' s tests , has scheduled a hearing Friday in Los Angeles Superior_Court on whether parental permission must be obtained before the tests are given . Gary Kreep , head of the U.S. Justice Foundation , said he had not yet seen a copy of the state ' s brief and could not comment . But he said his reading of last year ' s questions , some of which were released as samples to prepare students for this year ' s exams , convinced him that the questions &quot; clearly are invasive. &quot; In court documents , state_attorneys offer examples of questions they say would require parental consent and those that would not , and argue that the CLAS questions fall_into the latter category . For example , a question such_as , &quot; How many husbands has your mother had ? &quot; would clearly require parental consent and ones asking a student to comment on how a father in a story treated his two sons would not , the state argues . The purpose of the CLAS questions is &quot; not to elicit the personal beliefs and practices of the student &quot; because the student has many ways of responding . The state also alleges that none of the questions the plaintiffs have submitted appear on this year ' s tests . Further , the state argues that the Legislature , in calling_for development of the CLAS system , clearly intended to create performance-based tests in which students would use &quot; written expression to demonstrate reading comprehension and writing skills &quot; and that it clearly meant for virtually all students to take the exams .</TEXT>
