   <HEADLINE> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY ; DRAWING THE LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND ABUSE ; ASIAN IMMIGRANTS FIND THAT DISCIPLINARY METHODS SEEN AS RESPONSIBLE PARENTING IN THEIR NATIVE COUNTRIES CAN BE CONSIDERED IMPROPER IN U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The boy had bruises on his arms and legs . Purple blotches tracked along his limbs , as though someone had beaten the skinny 8-year-old Vietnamese boy with a belt . When social_worker Dat Nguyen knocked at the run-down El Monte apartment , the boy ' s parents readily admitted they had hit their son . He was a bad boy , the mother said . He fought with schoolchildren who made_fun of his shabby clothes and poor English . The teacher even sent a note home about this misbehavior , which brought much shame to the family . The parents , who immigrated from Vietnam in 1993 , were dumbfounded to learn they were under investigation for child_abuse . They listened as Nguyen struggled to explain terms like &quot; excessive discipline &quot; and &quot; foster_home &quot; -- words that have no equivalents in many Asian societies where extended families raise children and government interference is unheard of . &quot; We love our children , and we suffer with them when we discipline them , but we feel that hitting is OK , &quot; recalled the father , a former colonel in the South Vietnamese army who spent nine years in Communist re-education camps . &quot; I have a responsibility to do this , so they will grow_up to become good American citizens. &quot; Corporal_punishment is accepted discipline in many Asian cultures , but the practice is bringing trouble to some immigrants who find that what is considered responsible parenting in their native countries can be seen as abuse here . &quot; In Vietnam and China . . . it ' s a normal practice to hit a child with a whip for bringing_home a B , &quot; said Frank Nguyen , no relation_to Dat , who heads the Asian-Pacific Unit of the Los Angeles County Department of Children ' s Services . In Korean , the word teaching , gyopyon , means &quot; teaching with a cane. &quot; It ' s not that abuse among the Asian community is a massive problem . While Asian Americans make_up about 11 % of the population in Los Angeles County , they accounted_for only 1.8 % , or 1 # 036 of the 59 # 414 cases of child_abuse and neglect investigated in 1993 . But some experts believe the number of abuse cases is under-reported . In a study of the issue , titled &quot; Cultural Issues in the Prevention and Treatment of Child_Abuse and Neglect , &quot; Frank Nguyen suggests that family loyalty and filial piety keep figures low . Also , Asian culture generally calls_for resolving family problems internally . But the issue is not one of high statistics ; it ' s more one of different cultural outlooks , which raise provocative questions about the nature of discipline , parental authority and the need to protect children while observing sensitivity to other cultures . When social_workers call_on these families , they often find concerned and loving parents -- not dysfunctional abusers . It ' s just that these families are used to handling things differently in their homelands . * &quot; We have to be very , very sensitive to this issue , because what we think_of as discipline could be definitely considered abuse in L.A. , &quot; said Sookkyung Chang , a clinical_psychologist who works with Korean families in Rowland Heights and Los Angeles . &quot; In our history , if a child does something wrong , the mother will go get tree_branches and administer 10 lashes on the calves . But she hasn ' t lost_control . She ' s doing_it as a punishment and everyone knows . In America , it ' s a totally different culture. &quot; Those who work with Asian immigrant families say it ' s not always clear when physical punishment crosses over into child_abuse . Often , it depends_on one ' s cultural perspective . And therein lies trouble . &quot; There are real abuses out there , but there are also a lot of cultural misunderstandings , &quot; Nguyen said . &quot; To stop using a stick is easy , but what ' s the alternative ? They ' re scared to death they ' re going to lose_control of their children . They ' re scared to death that the police will intervene and come take their kid into protective custody. &quot; To address this cultural confusion , the Asian Youth Center and the Asian Pacific Family Center , both in Rosemead , now offer parenting classes in Cantonese , Vietnamese , Mandarin and Korean . Private psychologists of Asian heritage do a brisk business bridging the gap between conservative Old-World parents and rebellious Americanized teens . In 1992 , the Department of Children ' s Services tripled its Asian-Pacific unit , based in Covina , from 8 to 24 social_workers of Vietnamese , Korean , Laotian , Fukien , Cantonese , Samoan and Mandarin heritage . With shared roots and a common language , these social_workers have more chance for success . Aware that direct confrontation is considered rude , they break the ice with small_talk about their common homeland . So that parents don ' t lose face in front of their children , they ask them to step into another room before explaining the purpose of their visit . Sometimes the issue is easily resolved , a clear-cut cultural misunderstanding such_as the Southeast Asian practice of coining -- or rubbing a child ' s back with a heated coin -- a common folk remedy for respiratory illness . Coining leaves welts that look suspiciously like abuse to teachers unfamiliar_with this treatment . Spankings or beatings put social_workers on more murky ground . Under California ' s broadly worded child protection laws , only simple spanking is allowed ; the use of a belt or a slap to the face , under certain circumstances , can be grounds for court intervention . Children ' s Services discourages all spanking . Instead , social_workers urge parents to set limits and use grounding or loss of privilege as discipline . But it can be a hard_sell . In one case , Nguyen said a physical_education teacher called the child_abuse hot_line after noticing marks on a boy ' s legs in the shower . When social_workers arrived_at the house , the boy ' s father threw his hands up and said : * &quot; I give_up , it ' s too complicated here in America . If you don ' t want me to educate my child , what can I do ? You can take the child away. &quot; After long talks with the parents of the 8-year-old Vietnamese boy in El Monte , Nguyen determined that the boy was not in danger because the family was willing to take Nguyen ' s advice as a Vietnamese elder and try alternate forms of discipline . So one summer afternoon , as the boy crawled happily into his father ' s lap , Nguyen explained the concept of &quot; time_out , &quot; in which a child is sent_off to a quiet place to reflect on his misdeeds . In many cases , social_workers provide one-on-one counseling or recommend parenting classes that will teach American ways of dealing with_children and adolescents . In more severe cases , parents are sentenced to attend such classes by a dependency court judge as a prerequisite to getting their children back . If all else fails -- as with 50 cases last year -- they go_to court and ask a judge to find the child another home . That was what happened to a 16-year-old Lao-Cambodian girl whose farming family fled the killing fields of Pol Pot ' s Cambodia for a refugee camp in Thailand , where she was born . After several years they were resettled in Long_Beach , where the family had relatives , but the girl grew_up speaking fluent English and estranged from her traditional Southeast Asian roots . At age 12 , her father discovered she had a boyfriend and was ditching school and hit her with a steel pipe . She ran screaming to her church , which called the child_abuse hot_line . After intensive interviews with the family , Laotian American social_worker Paul Che decided the girl would be safer elsewhere ; her grandparents agreed to take her in . * Now 16 , the girl speaks with deep sorrow about the cultural chasm that led to the estrangement from her parents . &quot; They wanted me to come_home right after school . They would n ' t let me go_out . They ' d say , ' Why do you bring shame to the family and disrespect your parents ? ' &quot; she recalls . &quot; I know they love me , but you shouldn ' t show your love by abusing , because if you hit your kids , it ' s going_to encourage them not to listen. &quot; But not all parents agree . &quot; The reason the U.S. has so many juvenile_delinquents is because the schools are lax and most parents don ' t use corporal_punishment , &quot; maintains the Vietnamese father in El Monte . &quot; If you don ' t let us discipline our child now , who will take responsibility for him later ? &quot; And some parents resent being forced to attend American-style parenting classes , according to Josh Lin , a psychologist at the Asian Pacific Family Clinic in Rosemead . &quot; They feel mistreated by the system , &quot; Lin said . &quot; They tell me that we need a law to protect parents , ( that ) when they attempt to control their kids , they end_up in court . Then they tell me : ' Fine , take my child away from the home , I can ' t do anything with him , he won ' t listen to me. ' &quot; Asian immigrants tend to view adolescence differently from Americans . Teens -- especially girls -- are expected to come right home after school instead of hanging_out with their friends . Parents feel they are losing_control of teens who want to stay out late or wear makeup . Sometimes , they feel the only way to regain control is through hitting . &quot; Parents keep asking me , ' Why is the social_worker interfering ? ' &quot; said Marina Tse , a community activist who teaches in the Duarte Unified School District and is former president of the Chinese-American Education Assn . &quot; I tell them : ' It ' s to protect the child. ' And the parent says , ' Protecting the child is my job. ' &quot; Used to minimal interaction with teachers , immigrants may also assume the worst if they receive a call from the school . Glenn Masuda , a psychologist who counsels troubled teens at the Asian Pacific Family Clinic , recalls a Taiwanese father entering a parent-teacher meeting with his son . As they walked into the classroom , the father cuffed his son repeatedly , figuring he had misbehaved . The teacher wanted to announce he had been named a National Merit Scholar finalist . Jack Nahmias , principal of the Grazide School in Hacienda Heights , where Asians make_up 53 % of the student body , said Asian parents often approach him at parent-teacher conferences and ask if they can spank with an open hand , or if they can use a belt or how many times they can hit . It ' s a situation that makes Nahmias uncomfortable . He can only provide guidelines , not answers . But he feels_for these families : &quot; It ' s a real difficult situation for them , because they want to discipline their kids and teach them what ' s right but they don ' t know what ' s appropriate. &quot; Masuda said parents have asked him whether they should chain their rebellious teen-age daughters to their beds to keep them from going_out . &quot; That happens more often than you ' d think , &quot; Masuda said . &quot; They say , ' Hey , my neighbor did it. ' &quot; On the flip side , some unscrupulous but savvy teens have gotten wise_to the child_abuse reporting law and now threaten to call the police and report beatings unless their parents allow them to do as they please . &quot; The kids have all_the power , &quot; said Mai Ho , executive_director of Asian Perinatal Advocates , a San Francisco parent-education agency . &quot; They know the American laws , they speak English , and so the roles are reversed. &quot; The need for education goes both ways . Earlier this year , the Chinese American Education Assn . co-sponsored a seminar so that mainly Caucasian teachers , counselors and administrators from San Gabriel Valley school districts could learn more about issues affecting Asian students , such_as high parental expectations and cultural norms . &quot; Corporal_punishment is part of parenting skills in Asian cultures , and we as educators need to distinguish which is legitimate punishment and which is real abuse , &quot; Loretta Huang , an educator in the Alhambra School District , told hundreds of San Gabriel Valley educators . Interestingly , the discipline debate comes at a time when some Americans are questioning their own methods . &quot; We ' ve become way too lenient , and I think the pendulum is starting to go_back , &quot; said Joann Steinmeier , of the Arcadia Board_of_Education , where Asian Americans comprise 45 % of the district ' s student body . &quot; Most of the baby_boomers don ' t spank their kids and they have no respect for authority , so what ' s the answer ? &quot;</TEXT>
