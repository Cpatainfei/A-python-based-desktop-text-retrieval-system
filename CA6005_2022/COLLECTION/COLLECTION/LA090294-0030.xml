   <HEADLINE> FEDERAL PANEL WITHHOLDS APPROVAL OF BREAST EXAM DEVICE ; HEALTH : FDA ' S OUTSIDE EXPERTS CALL FOR STUDIES THAT SHOW THE SENSOR PAD WORKS . THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN AT THE CENTER OF A LONG LEGAL BATTLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended Thursday that the agency not approve the Sensor Pad , an experimental device designed to help women better detect breast lumps during self-examination , until its manufacturer submits scientific studies that show the product works . In doing so , the panel of outside experts sided with the agency in its nine-year dispute with the company that makes the device , a controversy that has involved FDA seizures of the product for illegal marketing to hospitals . When placed over the breast , the pad -- made of two latex-like sheets with a liquid silicone lubricant in-between -- is supposed to enhance its tactile surface , much like using soap or body lotion , presumably making lumps easier to feel . It is expected to cost about $ 15 and , if approved , likely would be available without a prescription . It is available in Europe and Asia , but its status in the United States has been held_up by the device industry as a case study of the FDA ' s sluggishness in approving potentially lifesaving medical devices . But the FDA , which in recent years has sought to achieve a balance between speeding promising products to the market and protecting the public from injury , has refused to approve the product until the manufacturer submits evidence that it is effective . Breast_cancer , the second-leading cancer killer of women , results in about 46 # 000 deaths annually . There are about 182 # 000 new cases every year . Early detection of the disease is considered critical . The pad ' s manufacturer , Inventive Products Inc. , of Decatur , Ill. , has argued that the pad is intended as an adjunct to -- not a substitute for -- traditional methods of breast_cancer detection and that it is safe . Therefore , the manufacturer has said , the FDA should not view it with the same regulatory scrutiny as devices such_as heart_valves or intrauterine devices , which in some cases have resulted in injury and deaths . But agency officials fear , among other things , that the pad could either mask abnormalities or cause women to feel something that is not there , resulting in undue anxiety and unnecessary medical procedures . Also , they worry that women who use it might forgo conventional breast_cancer detection methods , such_as mammograms or physical exams by physicians . * &quot; Given the importance of early detection . . , the public health implications are obvious , &quot; said Dr. Susan Alpert , director of the FDA ' s Office of Device Evaluation . &quot; Are our concerns warranted , or are we being overly cautious ? If this device is safe and useful . . , we want it to reach the public. &quot; The company provided the panel and the agency with testimony from numerous clinicians and women praising the pad , but it never has conducted extensive clinical trials that compare breast examination with and without the pad . &quot; There is no good way to do a human trial ( because ) there are so many variables in breast self-examination &quot; that &quot; you can ' t come_out with good , clean science , &quot; said Grant Wright , president of the company . &quot; We ' re up here trying to do some good , &quot; he added . &quot; I lost an aunt to breast_cancer and another aunt underwent a mastectomy . We want to work with you. &quot; Nevertheless , the FDA ' s obstetrics and gynecology devices panel urged that studies be conducted in professional settings , such_as hospitals and clinics , using both physicians and patients to compare breast examinations with and without the pad . The committee also recommended behavioral studies to determine whether use of the product resulted in changes in women ' s practices , either in self-examination or other detection methods . Earl Wright , the product ' s inventor and father of the company ' s president , said he does not know whether the company will comply , but he expressed pessimism about the prospects . &quot; Each woman ' s breast is unique and there ' s no way trials could be set_up using women that would be scientific , &quot; he said . &quot; For nine years we ' ve heard the same arguments and we ' ve never come_up with a solution. &quot; In 1987 , the firm began selling the pad to hospitals illegally , which led to a series of seizures by the FDA . When the firm contested the original seizure , a federal_court upheld the FDA actions . The company appealed the ruling , contending that the product was not a medical device . In 1991 , a federal appeals court affirmed the original ruling that the pad was a medical device and that it could not be sold until it was licensed . Following the initial seizure and throughout the legal process , the firm continued to distribute the device and the agency continued to seize it . The firm first sought marketing approval in 1985 , saying that the device was essentially equivalent_to products that were already legally on the market , in_effect seeking to bypass agency requirements that it submit proof of safety and effectiveness . The FDA concluded that the device was not like anything on the market and that a full pre-market approval application , including evidence of safety and effectiveness , was required . The company submitted such an application in 1989 , but the FDA said it contained little information and was inadequate to determine safety and effectiveness .</TEXT>
