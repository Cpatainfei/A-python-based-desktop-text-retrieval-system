   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / FRENCH OPEN ; LENDL , THIRD-SEEDED EDBERG JOIN THE FIRST-ROUND CASUALTY LIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Between them , they have played in 30 Grand_Slam event finals . They have been part of tennis ' elite for so_long , they have come_to symbolize the game . But on the red_clay here at Roland Garros Stadium , playing against opponents who have never experienced the quarterfinals of a major tournament , Stefan Edberg and Ivan Lendl were defeated . That they would lose in the_French Open in Paris was expected , perhaps inevitable . But in Tuesday ' s first round ? Edberg , seeded third , was thought to have a chance to win the one Grand_Slam tournament that has eluded him . But he had 18 double faults in losing to fellow Swede Henrik Holm , 7-5 , 7-6 ( 7-1 ) , 6-7 ( 7-2 ) , 6-7 ( 10-8 ) , 6-4 , in a 4-hour 4-minute marathon . Holm , 25 , has yet to win a tournament , and had lost all three previous matches against Edberg . Lendl , a four-time French Open champion who was unseeded and unprepared , lost in the first round for the second consecutive year , this time to Arnaud Boetsch of France , 6-4 , 6-3 , 6-4 . He then withdrew from next month ' s Wimbledon tournament , citing a recurring back problem . &quot; It is a very complicated thing and I am hoping to get_better with it , &quot; said Lendl , 34 . &quot; It was very disappointing because I have been feeling good for a while with it and then all_of a sudden just didn ' t. &quot; Edberg , 28 , thought he had overcome his struggles as he prepared_for the_French Open this month , but lost in the first round here for the second time . &quot; I don ' t know where I lost_it , &quot; he said . It was not so_much Edberg ' s loss as Holm ' s victory . Holm , who reached the third round of the last two Grand_Slam events , savored his victory . When a tournament official warned reporters , &quot; Last question , &quot; during a news_conference , Holm responded , &quot; ( But ) I need the publicity ! &quot; If he continues playing as he did Tuesday , publicity will be the least of his concerns . When Edberg rallied to force a fifth set by winning a long , error-filled fourth-set tiebreaker , Holm did not fold , although it seemed he might . During the set , Holm yelled at the chair umpire when a call went_against him as he trailed 2-1 . After interrupting play for nearly a minute , he finally bowed to the umpire and said , &quot; Thank you , &quot; continuing to insist that the ball had been out . But it was Edberg , calmly waiting for Holm to end his tirade , who cracked . He double-faulted on his next serve . Holm broke for 2-2 , but Edberg was not going_away quietly , and outlasted his opponent in the third tiebreaker . Afterward , Holm said he was trying to remain calm before the start of the decisive set . &quot; Just concentrating , &quot; he said . &quot; Finally , I made some unbelievable returns. &quot; And that ' s what it took_to overcome Edberg . Even at match_point , he continued to battle . On the first match_point , Holm lofted a nice lob over Edberg ' s head in the center of the court . Edberg reached with his backhand and got the ball , which hit the tape and barely made_it over the net . &quot; That was a good jump , &quot; said Holm , who promptly gained another match_point with a forehand winner . This time , Edberg was out of luck . After a long rally , Holm rifled a shot_down the line and all Edberg could do was watch . His next step was toward the sideline . Tennis Notes Sergi Bruguera and Jim Courier , finalists last year and winners of the last three men ' s titles , advanced in straight sets . Courier , the 1991 and 1992 champion but seeded seventh here , defeated Jean-Philippe Fleurian of France , 6-1 , 6-4 , 6-4 . No . 6 Bruguera , the defending champion , has been struggling with shoulder problems but routed No . 68 Martin Damm of the Czech Republic , 6-1 , 6-1 , 7-6 ( 7-3 ) . . . . No . 2 Michael Stich was a 6-1 , 7-5 , 6-4 victor over Renzo Furlan of Italy .</TEXT>
