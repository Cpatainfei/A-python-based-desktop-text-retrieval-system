   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN SERBS OFFER TRUCE TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Serbs proposed talks on a broad truce with the Muslim-led government Wednesday after stopping the U.N. commander from going_to the embattled Gorazde enclave . U.N. officials said they hoped to begin negotiations today at Sarajevo ' s airport on a cease-fire covering all_of the former Yugoslav republic.There was no immediate comment from government leaders on the proposed talks . Serbian troops and the government army have mostly observed a truce around Sarajevo since Feb . 10 , but fighting has raged between them elsewhere . A separate cease-fire between Bosnia ' s Croats and Muslims , whose leaders are forming a federation , has quieted central and southwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina . British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the U.N. commander for Bosnia , had wanted to personally assess reports that Gorazde was about to fall to the Serbs after a nine-day offensive . The mayor of Gorazde had pleaded for Rose to come , just as Rose ' s predecessor , French Gen . Philippe Morillon , went_to the enclave of Srebrenica during fighting a year ago . Muslims believe Morillon ' s trip saved Srebrenica . Serbian authorities blocked Rose from getting beyond Pale , the Bosnian Serb headquarters just outside Sarajevo . They did , however , allow three U.N. military observers and eight of Rose ' s liaison officers to go_on to supplement four military observers already in the enclave about 30 miles southeast of Sarajevo .</TEXT>
