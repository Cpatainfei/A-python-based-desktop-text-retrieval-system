   <TEXT> As a movie lover for many years , I strongly disagree_with the Academy Award nomination in the foreign-language film category of the Hong Kong entry , &quot; Farewell My Concubine &quot; ( &quot; Oscar ' s Favorite List , &quot; Feb . 10 ) .The film , upon which I wasted my money , is an ugly and sordid two hours and 36 minutes of cruelty : mutilation , beatings , humiliation , torture , murder , more beatings and then , at the end , an incomprehensible suicide . A few conceivable reasons for the film ' s many awards to date are that it does have scope , ambition , overwrought passion and some powerful performances . However , this in no way makes_it an artful film with logical story development or meaningful content . BETH TEMKIN North Hollywood</TEXT>
