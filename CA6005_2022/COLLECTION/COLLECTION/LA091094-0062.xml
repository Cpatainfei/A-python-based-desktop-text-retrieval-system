   <HEADLINE> BOARD BRILLIANCE ; SPORTS : VENTURA YOUTH , 14 , UNCOILS HIS BEST EFFORT TO WIN WORLD SNAKEBOARDING CHAMPIONSHIP IN ENGLAND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After just 1 1 / 2 years of trying his hand at a new sport called snakeboarding , 14-year-old Jay Beatty of Ventura has won the world championship in England and become a star of the fledgling sport . Jay was flown to London by Snakeboard USA , the country ' s only snakeboard manufacturer , and beat_out 34 competitors last weekend to win the 1994 World Snakeboarding Championships . The sport , which is big in Europe and was invented eight years ago , tests snakers ' skill and balance on a skateboard-like apparatus featuring two connected , pivoting boards that riders strap to their feet . While competing in England , Jay carved , slid , spun and jumped against more experienced snakeboarders . It was Jay ' s first competition ever . To the shock and chagrin of his rivals -- some six years older than he is with years more experience -- Jay knocked_off the field &quot; in a landslide. &quot; All of the other contestants had to qualify through competitions in their countries . Jay was the only wild-card entry . &quot; I was really surprised , &quot; said Jay on Friday , standing on his black snakeboard which sports a surfing-style sticker that says Mad . &quot; I didn ' t really believe it myself until they announced it. &quot; The Buena High_School freshman won a $ 1 # 000 check and two $ 500 watches from European and American sponsors . An announcement of his victory was broadcast on British television . During the competition , Jay landed the only 720-degree spinning jump of the day . He also said he spun 900 degrees in a practice jump -- but failed to &quot; stick the landing. &quot; Jay said he has never seen anyone else spin 2 1 / 2 times around , even during unsuccessful jumps . Similar to a figure-skating contest , snakeboarding is judged on style , expression , height and difficulty of jumps , said Jay ' s unofficial coach and mentor , Brandon Eifrid , 22 , who works for Brand X , Snakeboard USA ' s California distributor . Jay attributes his rise in the sport to a good-old fashioned work ethic . &quot; Practice , &quot; he said . &quot; I just really like doing_it , I do_it every day. &quot; During the summer months , Jay snakeboards around Ventura as much as eight hours a day . &quot; Anybody can get a skateboard and ride it , &quot; Jay said , between 10-foot-high launches off a neighborhood ramp . &quot; This is way more fun . . . .. You have to take time to learn how to do_it . It ' s harder than skateboarding. &quot; Riders can make tightly wound , side-winding turns at high speeds on the apparatus by twisting their upper bodies , like surfers do , Eifrid said . The boards are easily manipulated with a foot-long , pliable fiber strap that connects the two foot plates . While skateboarders often lose_control of their boards at about 10 m.p.h. , snakeboarders can reach speeds of 18 to 20 m.p.h. , Eifrid said . In England , Jay said , some of his competitors were clocked at 50 m.p.h. speeding down a steep hill . &quot; It ' s basically a lot of big air , more speed , &quot; Eifrid said . &quot; It ' s a whole different rush . . . . There ' s not any obstacles too big -- handrails , flights of stairs , hills . It ' s like snowboarding ( around ) Ventura. &quot; Along with seven teen-age teammates , Jay is carted_off many weekends to statewide exhibitions and halftime shows to promote the sport . Among Jay ' s competitors at the world competition was the reigning champ , Ashley Morgan of South_Africa , who Eifrid said is about 20 years old and has been practicing his swirling high-wire act for about seven years . Morgan was a friend of a young South_African surfer named James Fischer , who was bored with conventional skateboarding , and developed snakeboarding . &quot; Jay is pretty much a natural as far as an athlete goes , &quot; said Jay ' s mother , Renee Beatty . &quot; As long as he likes it , he gets really obsessed , he ' s a perfectionist. &quot; If it weren ' t for Renee Beatty , Jay may have never seen a snakeboard . Two years ago , Jay ' s younger brother , Brian , asked their mother to buy him a skateboard for Christmas . But while shopping for a skateboard , she met Eifrid promoting his product at a Camarillo bizarre and bought the snakeboard instead . &quot; It looked_like it was going_to be the wave of the future , so I took_a_chance on it , &quot; Renee Beatty said . &quot; Jay just lives to go and do this now . . . . Those other kids ( in Europe ) had never even heard of Jay , and then he blew everybody away. &quot;</TEXT>
