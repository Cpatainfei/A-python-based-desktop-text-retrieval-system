   <TEXT> Regarding &quot; These Guys Blow Us Away , &quot; by David Kronke ( Summer Sneaks , May 15 ) : Your article on action movies is guilty of a crime you and Hollywood have perpetuated in the past . The premise is that people are tired_of action films . The proof you cite is the box-office failure of several movies : &quot; Last Action Hero , &quot; &quot; On Deadly Ground , &quot; &quot; The Getaway , &quot; &quot; The Chase &quot; and &quot; No Escape. &quot; This is typical denial . These films didn ' t bomb because people are tired_of action films . ( Although it ' s quite possible that we may be. ) These films bombed because they were terrible . It ' s that simple . If Hollywood would stop obsessing on finding just the right formula and start obsessing on making_good films , regardless of their genre , we ' d all be a lot happier , and they ' d be making money hand_over fist . JOSH OLSON Hermosa Beach * How on Earth can anyone write a five-page article on action movies and not once mention producer Joel Silver ? My God , he practically single-handedly invented the mega-budget action film as we know it today . My friends and I would like to know what restaurant critic concocted the insane list of the 10 best directors of action films . I mean , you put Quentin Tarantino on the list with one directing credit ? And you call John Woo , the greatest and most influential action-film director in the Orient ( with 23 films to his credit ) , an &quot; up-and-comer &quot; ? Jeez . There ' s no excuse for this . It isn ' t funny -- it ' s plain sloppy writing and research unworthy_of any major newspaper . LAWRENCE S . BROOKS Los Angeles Producer Silver , through his office , declined repeated requests to be interviewed for the story . * Kronke ' s list of action movie directors was fascinating , but may I suggest that Tony Scott is more action-oriented that his brother Ridley . Tony ' s credits include &quot; Top Gun &quot; ( 1986 ) , &quot; Beverly Hills Cop II &quot; ( 1987 ) , &quot; Revenge &quot; ( 1990 ) , &quot; Days of Thunder &quot; ( 1990 ) and the recent &quot; True Romance. &quot; One of his trademarks is his use of riveting car chases , as was particularly evident in &quot; The Last Boy_Scout &quot; ( 1991 ) .
