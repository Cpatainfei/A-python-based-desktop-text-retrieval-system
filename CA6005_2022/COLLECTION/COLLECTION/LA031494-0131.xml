   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FOCUS OF RESOLUTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Supervisors Vicky Howard and Maggie Kildee will ask their board colleagues Tuesday to adopt a resolution urging the federal_government to pay_for services it requires Ventura County to provide to illegal immigrants . Howard and Kildee complain that the federal_government is forcing local_governments to provide a host of costly services for illegal immigrants but fails to provide enough money to do so . Board_members have discussed the mandates with federal_officials on several occasions , including during a trip to Washington last year and among colleagues at the recent National Assn . of Counties conference . The resolution urges the federal_government to &quot; recognize its obligation to reimburse state and local_governments for the costs of providing federally mandated services to illegal immigrants by appropriating sufficient federal funding to cover these costs. &quot; In his state budget proposal now under review , Gov . Pete Wilson included a request for $ 3 billion in federal funds to pay_for health , education and public assistance services that the state must provide to illegal immigrants . But the Clinton_Administration budget proposal did not include that appropriation . The Ventura County Board of Supervisors passed a similar resolution a year ago . JEFF McDONALD</TEXT>
