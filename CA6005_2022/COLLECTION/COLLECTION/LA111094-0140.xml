   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : ELECTIONS ' 94 : IMPACT ON BUSINESS ; GOP SWEEP WILL TAKE A BROOM TO HIGH-TECH AGENDA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration ' s ambitious agenda to make government an instrument of American high-tech competitiveness will not survive the Republican takeover of Congress . The electoral tide that swept_away Democrats is sure to capsize the innovation initiatives the White_House so ardently championed . &quot; I think you have to assume a scorched-earth_policy when the Republicans come_in , &quot; says a rueful staffer at the National Economic Council , the White_House ' s economic_policy arm . &quot; we ' ll have a very , very hard time. &quot; That could be an understatement . America ' s science and technology policy is about to be turned upside down and face right . Newt Gingrich , who is set to become the Speaker of the House , had already targeted the Commerce_Department ' s Advanced Technology Program in his &quot; Contract for America &quot; as particularly worthy of extinction . That means the Administration ' s effort to transform the Commerce_Department ' s National Institute for Standards and Technology into a billion-dollar venture_capitalist will be fast-forwarded to annihilation . Republicans have long objected to programs in which the government even appears to be picking winners and losers in the high-tech marketplace . As their rhetoric and records unambiguously reveal , the Robert Dole-Newt Gingrich perception of appropriate public-private partnership is radically different than that proffered by Bill_Clinton and Al Gore . To be sure , Republicans have historically been supportive of federal science and technology funding , but they reserve a special circle in their political hell for anything that remotely smacks of &quot; industrial policy. &quot; What the White_House trumpeted as bold investment in America ' s innovation infrastructure seems certain to invite the budgetary scalpels and machetes of the New Majority . that ' s not to say that Republicans will turn Gore ' s &quot; information superhighway &quot; into a digital dirt road -- Gingrich , for one , is quite interested in new media . But there should be no doubt that the New Majority has little interest in the sort of &quot; universal service &quot; and &quot; non-discriminatory access &quot; public policy issues that have dominated the Democratic discussions . More likely , we ' ll see Republicans pushing for precisely the sort of deregulatory telecommunications legislation they gridlocked during the last Congress -- but without the allegedly onerous public_service obligations contained in the last bill . Similarly , as co-author of the influential Bayh-Dole legislation ( which pioneered the transfer of government-funded technology to the private sector ) , new Senate Majority_Leader Dole is intimately familiar_with the controversies and conflicts surrounding the challenge of technology transfer from government research institutions to the private sector . He is now superbly positioned to rewrite the White_House agenda on public-private partnerships in high-tech innovation . But if the Republican leadership practices what it ideologically preaches , there ' s little place , for example , for the Pentagon ' s plan to spend $ 500 million over five years to help American industry capture the global marketplace from Japan in flat-panel display technologies . Flat-panel displays are a prime example of how the Clinton_Administration wants to fund dual-use technologies -- that is , technologies for national security that have commercial applications and commercial technologies that have military potential . Consequently , the entire issue of dual-use policy faces fundamental re-examination . The Pentagon ' s Advanced Research Projects Agency -- which has pioneered many breakthroughs in computer_science and in_effect created the Internet -- has more_than three-quarters of its budget tied_up in dual-use funding . In many respects , ARPA is as much a vehicle for industry as armament . The Administration ' s $ 550-million Technology Reinvestment Program , which is designed to facilitate defense conversion efforts by creating new collaborations between industry , academe and local_governments , is sure to be scrutinized -- though many elements of the program enjoy bipartisan support . &quot; Dual use is a powerful way to get_the_best of both worlds , &quot; says the White_House staffer . &quot; In theory , everyone gets better technology . In practice , appropriators often consider ( dual use ) to be leakage to the commercial sector. &quot; On the surface , dual-use technologies and defense conversion seem likely candidates for bipartisan cooperation . There is just as clear a need to invest wisely in dual-use technologies as there is to ease the trauma of transition from a Cold_War economy to a global one . However , it seems likely that Republicans -- who now control the Armed Services and Defense Appropriations committees in both houses -- will offer their own definitions of dual use . Similarly , don ' t be surprised if the New Majority pushes for greater research and development spending in specialized defense technologies . The defense weapons laboratories may have been bought a little breathing_space . Of course , the single biggest impact of the Republican takeover is uncertainty : Which agency or research institution can intelligently plan for the future with so many unknowns now a part of Washington ' s innovation infrastructure ? Is Republican control a two-year aberration ? Or will it be a structural change ? What kind of a business person would enter into a high-tech partnership with a national laboratory under such circumstances ? George Brown no longer runs the House Science , Space and Technology Committee ; Ed Markey is now subordinate in Telecommunications and Finance , and John Dingell ' s huge shadow no longer looms over the critical Energy and Commerce Committee . All the new players are untested . They ' ve never led before . Given this uncertainty and novelty , it ' s easy to predict that the political battles surrounding science and technology policy over the next two years will be far more interesting than those of the last few . * More Innovation : For a collection of recent Innovation columns by Michael Schrage , sign_on to the TimesLink on-line service and &quot; jump &quot; to keyword &quot; Innovation. &quot; Details on_Times electronic services , B4</TEXT>
