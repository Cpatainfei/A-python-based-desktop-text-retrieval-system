   <HEADLINE> A RANGER IN PARADISE ; SANTA BARBARA ISLAND : BETH FULSOM WORKS AND LIVES ALONE IN THE EXOTIC SETTING . ' I ' M HERE BY CHOICE , ' SHE SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beth Fulsom is the only human being_on tiny , exotic Santa Barbara Island , 47 miles out_to sea from Ventura . But she isn ' t alone . She shares the one-square-mile , wind-swept , treeless island with 160 # 000 beady-eyed deer_mice , thousands of sea_gulls , pelicans and other sea_birds and more_than 1 # 000 sea_lions . Fulsom , 33 , has one of the most remote outposts of any ranger in the National_Park_Service . &quot; I ' m here by_choice , &quot; the 12-year Park Service veteran said . &quot; I love the island . Santa Barbara is the crown_jewel of the five islands that make_up the Channel Islands National Park. &quot; Fulsom , whose tour_of_duty on the island will last two years , has been the sole ranger there since April 10 . There are also rangers stationed at the four other islands -- Anacapa , Santa Cruz , Santa Rosa and San Miguel . She is_on the island 10 days and off five . During the summer , seasonal rangers fill_in for her . In winter , the ranger station is not staffed when she is off the island . During the winter , few mariners risk sailing out_to the island because of the fierce storms and treacherous seas . &quot; The sea gets so rough , &quot; Fulsom said . &quot; Sometimes it breaks over the second pier of the dock , 25 feet out of water . There is no place for a boat to hide , no safe anchorage for boats to go_to during winter storms. &quot; When the waters are calm , Fulsom makes the three-hour sea journey to Santa Barbara Island from Ventura aboard a National_Park_Service boat . When seas are too rough , she is flown to and from the island by helicopter . Santa Barbara Island is a world apart from eastern Pennsylvania , where Fulsom grew_up . She graduated in 1982 from East Stroudsburg State College in the Poconos , where she majored in parks and recreation . Since graduating , she has been a ranger in five National_Parks in Delaware , New York , Pennsylvania and California . Her newest assignment agrees with her . &quot; One of my main reasons why I requested to be assigned to Santa Barbara Island is because of the outstanding diving here , &quot; Fulsom said . &quot; Fish everywhere . Lobster . Diving with whales passing_through and hanging_around the island for a_few days and with sea_lions that swim up_to your mask. &quot; &quot; Often I will put a line in the water and fish for dinner -- sheepshead , opaleye , perch or calico bass , my favorite , &quot; she said . &quot; If I ' m in the mood for lobster , I dive for one . Pretty good life , huh ? &quot; Fulsom lives in a yellow stucco structure looming over the sea at Landing Cove . The building houses the ranger ' s four-room residence , a visitors center and a small museum . She begins her workday by raising the flag and opening the visitor ' s center . Then she radios park headquarters in Ventura about weather and sea conditions , the number of boats in the anchorage , any citations issued and any unusual wildlife activity , &quot; like pods of whales swimming by , &quot; Fulsom said . * Fulsom wears many hats . She is a park ranger , a Santa Barbara County deputy_sheriff , a California Fish and Game_warden and an emergency medical technician who treats visitors who have minor injuries . If there is a serious accident , she radios for help . Because she is a law_enforcement officer , she carries a . 357 magnum . &quot; I ' ve never had to use it , but being alone in this out-of-the-way place , you never know what you might encounter , &quot; she said . She patrols the water in a 60-horsepower inflatable boat . It takes her 20 minutes to circle the island . The fewer than 3 # 500 visitors to the island each year are commercial fishermen who harvest lobsters , swordfish and sea_urchins ; pleasure boaters who anchor all along the east coast beneath the island ' s steep cliffs ; and tourists who arrive aboard Island Packers concessionaire boats out of Ventura . Permits are issued by the Park Service for the eight island campsites , for a maximum of 30 campers at any given time . Visitors have to bring their own water and food , along with tents if they are staying overnight . * The ranger leads nature walks along the 5 1 / 2 miles of trails that crisscross the saddle-shaped island , which rises 635 feet out of the water at Signal Peak , its high point , and 562 feet at North_Peak . The island is covered with low-lying vegetation such_as Australian saltbush , ice_plant , prickly_pear_cactus , cholla and the giant_coreopsis that resembles a dwarf tree , its thick woody stem growing as high as five feet . In spring , the_hills of the island are ablaze with golden flowers blossoming on the coreopsis . &quot; Sometimes groups come_out in good_weather from schools up and down the coast from Santa Barbara to San Diego , &quot; Fulsom said . &quot; I lead them and all visitors on guided tours to sea_lion rookeries , to view the spectacular sea_elephants . I describe the flora and fauna , island history . We visit kitchen_middens where prehistoric Indians camped. &quot; Kitchen_middens are centuries-old Native_American refuse dumps piled high with abalone and mussel shells . Sea_lions breed in December and pup in spring . Also in the spring , island cliffs are alive_with thousands of small , chubby , neckless Xantus murrelets , sea_birds who instinctively tumble into the sea 48 hours after birth to meet their parents and swim away . Santa Barbara Island is the largest known breeding colony of Xantus murrelets in the world . The 160 # 000 endemic Santa Barbara Island deer_mice add_to the rough-and-tumble atmosphere . Before the new ranger station was completed two years ago , the lone island ranger slept_in a World_War_II Quonset hut . Deer_mice often walked over the ranger ' s face and body during the night . * So far , the new ranger house is mouse-proof , although the mice frequently chew through campers ' tents in search of food . &quot; One camper awakened to find three baby deer_mice born during the night in one of his shoes , &quot; said Fulsom . The animal life keeps things interesting , Fulsom said . &quot; There ' s never a dull moment , &quot; she said . &quot; Mice sleep all day , and at night they crawl up and down the screens of my house chasing moths attracted by the lights . Sea_lions at the bottom of the cliff outside my window bark all night long , but I ' m used to it . The wind howls most of the time . The automated Coast Guard light passes_over every 11 seconds . Barn owls let_loose with raspy grackle calls . Yet I sleep like a log. &quot; For exercise , she daily either runs 10 laps_up and down the 300 steep steps leading from the landing to the top of the cliff or jogs four miles around the perimeter of the island . &quot; I never get lonely when I ' m alone on the island , &quot; said Fulsom , who has electricity provided by solar_panels mounted on the battery building next to the ranger station . &quot; I have a television_set but rarely turn it on . I ' m a voracious reader with two or three novels going at_the_same_time , and I love working crossword puzzles. &quot; When Fulsom is_on the mainland , she lives_in Ojai and &quot; moonlights &quot; operating a boat for the Ventura Harbor Patrol . &quot; I ' m a working fool , &quot; she laughs . At night on the island she sees the myriad of lights twinkling on the mainland . Palos Verdes Peninsula is the nearest landfall , 37 miles away . She also sees the lights on Catalina Island , 24 miles away . In the morning , Fulsom turns_on her radio to hear the news and &quot; to listen to the Sig Alerts as millions of people head_off for work a_few miles away in Los Angeles County , and here I am all alone , no cars , no roads , a world apart . &quot; I keep pinching myself to make_sure this is really happening to me. &quot;</TEXT>
