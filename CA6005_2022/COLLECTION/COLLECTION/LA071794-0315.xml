   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / JERRY CROWE ; TOP PLAYERS SLAM THE DOOR ON L.A.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This year ' s Grand_Slam event winners -- Pete Sampras , Steffi Graf , Sergi Bruguera , Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez -- have at least one other thing in common . They all have left Los Angeles off their summer itineraries . Neither Sampras , winner of the Wimbledon and Australian Open championships , nor Bruguera , winner of the_French Open , is entered in the Los Angeles Open Aug . 1-7 at the L.A. Tennis Center at UCLA . And Graf , Sanchez Vicario and Martinez , winners of the Australian , French and Wimbledon titles , respectively , are passing_up the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles Aug . 8-14 at Manhattan Country_Club in Manhattan Beach . Sampras ' decision , made almost a year ago , to skip the only Los Angeles event on the ATP Tour is especially disappointing . Winner of four of the last five Grand_Slam tournaments , including consecutive Wimbledon titles , Sampras , 22 , is practically a native son . Although he was born in Washington , D.C. , he grew_up in the Southland , playing in Southern California Tennis Assn . junior tournaments and attending Palos Verdes High for two years before turning pro in 1988 . An appearance this year in a tournament he won in 1991 and had entered in all but one year since he turned pro would have made_for a triumphant homecoming . Said Andre Agassi , who is entered in the L.A. Open along with , among others , Boris Becker , Michael Chang and two-time defending champion Richard Krajicek : &quot; For one of the players not to think Pete ' s a_level above everybody else , they must be hiding_out somewhere and not watching any tennis at all . . . . &quot; He ' s doing everything better than everybody else right now. &quot; Sampras , scheduled to play in Washington this week and in Toronto next week , will take a week off before playing in two more tournaments before the U.S. Open , which starts Aug . 29 . &quot; It would be great to have Pete , but Pete ' s played here so often , &quot; said Bob Kramer , tournament director for the L.A. Open . &quot; Our thought is , if a guy like that plays every_other year , it ' s going_to be a huge deal . . . . &quot; we ' ll work_on Pete for ' 95. &quot; * Friendly rivals : Agassi , asked to describe his relationship with Sampras : &quot; We ' re just platonic. &quot; * Waiting game : Venus Williams , widely touted as the next great player in women ' s tennis , has changed her plans and will not make her WTA Tour debut in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles . &quot; We asked Venus not to play and she agreed not to play , &quot; said her father , Richard . &quot; She just turned 14 ( on June 17 ) . She needs to grow_up a little bit and have time to be a little_girl a little longer. &quot; Williams , 6 feet 2 and 130 pounds , was born in Long_Beach and grew_up in Compton before moving to Florida almost three years ago . Her father said she could play in the Manhattan Beach tournament if she maintained high marks in school , but he had second_thoughts after Jennifer Capriati ' s recent problems . &quot; She went_far beyond the call of duty to secure those grades , &quot; Williams said of his daughter , &quot; and I really feel ( asking her not to play is ) sort of unfair . &quot; But at_the_same_time , once she goes_out to play , even if it ' s as an amateur , her life will change . So , we want to make_sure we don ' t change it too soon. &quot; He said his daughter probably won ' t make her WTA Tour debut until next year . * Color man : Bud Collins , NBC commentator and Boston Globe columnist , didn ' t disappoint when he was enshrined this month in the International Tennis Hall_of_Fame at Newport , R.I. &quot; His enshrinement wardrobe ? In a word , splendid , &quot; reported Jim Greenidge of the Globe . &quot; A white double-breasted sport jacket , a light blue shirt with contrasting tie , set_off by ultra-bright orange pants , red slip-on cloth slippers . . . and no socks. &quot; Said Collins : &quot; The rule is that no socks should be worn between May 1 and Oct . 1 , except for the last two days of Wimbledon when I meet the Dutchess of Kent. &quot; * Who wears short shorts ? Agassi doesn ' t wear short shorts . Said Agassi , asked about the baggies he and Sampras started wearing last month : &quot; I think you ' re going to look_back at tennis a_few years from now and it ' s going_to be like looking_back at basketball when they used to wear those little shorts . &quot; You look_back and think , ' Wow , those don ' t look so good. ' &quot; Tennis Notes Steffi Graf , Conchita Martinez and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario are entered in the Toshiba Tennis Classic Aug . 1-7 at La Costa Resort &amp; Spa . . . . French Open finalist Mary Pierce has pulled_out of the La Costa event and the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles , where Martina Navratilova will make her final Southland appearance . . . . Pete Sampras recently became the seventh player to pass the $ 10-million mark in career earnings , joining Ivan Lendl , Stefan Edberg , Boris Becker , John McEnroe , Navratilova and Graf .</TEXT>
