   <TEXT> Today ' s worries about Haiti : 1 . HAITI ' S MILITARY : Lt . Gen . Hugh Shelton , leader of the U.S. expeditionary force , reports excellent cooperation between the American and Haitian military commands . Fine , but let ' s hope they ' re not about to become blood_brothers . Keep_in mind that the reason we ' re there is the Haitian military . This is an army that has existed not to defend the country but to repress the Haitian people at the behest of the country ' s ruling economic elite . Raoul Cedras has not been running any Salvation_Army . Haitian police and soldiers beat at least one person to death Tuesday . Any superficial commonalities between the Haitian and American forces should not blind the U.S. officials there to the profound differences between them . 2 . POLICING HAITI : The dramatic agreement signed Sunday in Port-au-Prince permits the Haitian military and police_forces to continue to police that troubled country . Good_luck . Aren ' t the island nation ' s troubles only compounded by an arrangement in which the Haitian military continues to do its thing as the U.S. military_force , climbing rapidly toward 15 # 000-strong , looks the other way ? U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will be understandably reluctant to commit U.N. peacekeepers to the subsequent phases until the U.S. forces can create what a U.N. resolution calls &quot; a secure and stable environment. &quot; How can that be done without U.S. troops taking_over the policing role from the Haitian military ? There is absolutely no reason to believe that police accustomed to bullying citizens ( and far worse ) will suddenly change from persecutor to protector . 3 . ARISTIDE ' S ICINESS : Exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is not happy that the Haitian military is still involved in running things and that Cedras is still around . OK , but maybe the ousted leader could be more pragmatic : After all , U.S. armed forces are there and the chemistry in his country is now quite different . No one thinks that the American deal with the junta is ideal , by any means ; but U.S. policy , however flawed and bumbling , is committed . Aristide ' s coldness does not auger well for Aristide-Washington relations down the road .</TEXT>
