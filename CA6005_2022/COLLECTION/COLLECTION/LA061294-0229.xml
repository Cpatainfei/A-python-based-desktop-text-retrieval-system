Hortencia scored 32 points and Paula had 29 as the Brazilians reached their first world championship final . &quot; We just didn ' t do the things we needed to do , &quot; said U.S. Coach Tara VanDerveer . &quot; If you give_up 110 points , that is a pretty good way to lose. &quot; It was the first U.S. loss at the world championships since the 1983 final against the Soviet_Union . The 110 points were the most given_up by the United States at the world championships . &quot; We didn ' t have the effort or intensity we needed defensively , &quot; VanDerveer said . &quot; We had people who didn ' t play to their potential here . I ' m not going_to name them , but they know who they are. &quot; Brazil will meet Olympic silver medalist China in today ' s final . Center Zheng Haixia had 36 points and 14 rebounds as China beat Australia , 66-65 , in the other semifinal . The United States will play Australia for third place today . Katrina McClain led the United States with 29 points against Brazil .
