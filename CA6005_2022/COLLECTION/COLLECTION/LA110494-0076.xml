   <HEADLINE> STUDY SAYS U.S. TRAILS JAPAN ON AUTO PARTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite strong demand for vehicles and record profits for U.S. auto suppliers , American components makers are lagging Japanese suppliers in productivity and quality , according to a major study released Thursday . The survey of 71 major auto suppliers worldwide found that the Japanese continue to be the global leaders in these areas , even though their domestic operations have been slowed by an economic downturn . &quot; This should serve as a wake-up call , &quot; said Donald Wingard , the Detroit managing partner of Andersen Consulting , the study ' s sponsor . &quot; The message is you can ' t be lulled into complacency . You ' ve got_to keep getting better. &quot; The results appear to support the claims of Japanese auto_makers , who express reluctance to buy U.S. auto parts because of what they say are cost and quality shortcomings among American suppliers . More_than half the $ 60-billion trade_deficit with Japan is linked to autos and auto parts . In trade talks , the U.S._government is demanding that Japan buy more U.S. auto parts and open_up their market to U.S. car and parts makers . When negotiations stalled in September , the United States launched a probe of Japanese trade_barriers in the sales of auto replacement parts . Japanese auto suppliers are 20 % more productive than U.S. manufacturers and their quality is 30 % higher , according to the study , which was conducted by the University of Cambridge and the University of Wales ' Cardiff Business_School . The gap is even wider in Europe , where the Japanese are expanding rapidly . The report indicates that Japanese auto_makers are finding ways to take even more costs out of their already lean system . For instance , Toyota is working_on a small car about the size of a Corolla that will cost 30 % less . The company says such a car could be profitable even if the yen appreciated another 20 % against the dollar . Overall , the study found that parts suppliers worldwide improved greatly in recent years . Since an initial study in 1992 , productivity and quality of Japanese suppliers improved 38 % and those in Britain 31 % . U.S. suppliers were not part of the previous study , but other data suggests they have improved about 25 % in the period , researchers said . &quot; The standard for what is world-class is changing , &quot; Wingard said .</TEXT>
