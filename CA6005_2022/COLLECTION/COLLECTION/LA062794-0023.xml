   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON CHANGE ; EFFICIENT CAPITALISM RUNS AMOK ; ECONOMIC STRUCTURES FALL IN YEARS , NOT GENERATIONS ; DISLOCATIONS ARE MORE THAN PEOPLE , FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES CAN BEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is now an undisputed truth that capitalism , unobstructed by public regulations , private monopolies , strong trade_unions or cultural inhibitions , is the best engine of economic_growth . That the capitalist engine achieves such growth because its competitive pressure destroys old economic structures , allowing more efficient structures to rise , is also perfectly obvious . And , finally , that these same structural changes can inflict more disruption than workers , firms , entire industries and their localities can absorb has long been recognized . What is new about the present situation is only a matter of degree , an acceleration in the pace of the structural changes that come_with economic_growth . But that is enough to make all_the difference in the world . Structural change , with all_of its personal upheavals and social disruptions , is now quite rapid even when there is zero growth , becoming that much faster when economies do grow . One obvious cause is the worldwide retreat of public ownership , central planning and administrative direction , with all their rigidities inimical to innovation , economic_growth , individual dislocations and social disruptions alike . From Argentina to Zambia , with the entire communist world in between , the state ownership of economic enterprises was once seen as the guarantor of the public interest ; it is now regarded_as the guarantee of bureaucratic idleness , technical stagnation and outright thievery . Efficient central planning is now known to be impossible , simply because no group of mere humans can determine next year ' s demand for everything from tower cranes to toothpicks . Even &quot; administrative direction , &quot; once gloriously successful in Japan , Korea and Taiwan and at least helpful in France ( though ineffective and / or corrupt almost everywhere else ) , is now being abandoned even in Japan , having been jettisoned long ago almost everywhere else . Another obvious cause of accelerated structural change is the much-celebrated unification of village , provincial , regional and national economies into a single global economic ocean . This unification is being accomplished by the removal of_import barriers , capital-export prohibitions , investment controls and licensing restrictions on the sale of transnational services ; the advent and rapid geographic spread of reliable , cheap and instant telecommunications ; lower transport costs due_to the waning material content of commerce and the improvement of air services , harbors and roads , notably in rural Asia and Latin_America , if not Africa ; the diffusion of technologies for the production of export goods or components , even in otherwise backward local economies , and the uniformity of demand created by transnational mass media imagery and advertising . The overall effect of &quot; globalization &quot; is that any production anywhere can expand far beyond the limits of the domestic market , insofar as it is competitive -- and of course that any production anywhere , and the related employment , can be displaced at any time by cheaper production elsewhere . A domestic cause of structural change is the rather sudden arrival of the long-awaited , long-delayed increases in administrative and clerical efficiencies from electronic computation , data storage , reproduction and communications . With generational change , even senior managers can now work those machines if they want to , thereby allowing them to understand their uses , abuses and non-uses . Junior managers are increasingly compelled to use those machines in place of clerical help and clerical companionship . Computer_networks also allow managers to literally oversee , right on_their_own screens , the work that their underlings are doing or not doing , giving computerized tasks the same transparency as assembly-line work , with the same immediate visibility of inefficient procedures , inefficient habits and inefficient employees . This late-arriving wave of efficiency has suddenly exposed white-collar workers to the workplace dislocations , mass firings and diminishing employment prospects that have long been the lot of blue-collar industrial workers in mature economies . Even though the U.S. economy is in full recovery , white-collar job reductions are being announced by one famous corporation after another , dressed in the trendy language of the latest management-consultant books as &quot; restructuring &quot; or , more fancifully , &quot; re-engineering &quot; the corporation . Telephone-answering secretaries are displaced by voice-mail systems , letter-writing secretaries by computer word-processing software and fax boards , filing secretaries by electronic memories , with the consequent displacement of clerical supervisors . Junior administrators are displaced by automated paper-flow processing , with the consequent displacement of their administrative supervisors . Higher up the pyramid , many middle managers are no longer needed to supervise the doings and undoings of both clerical and administrative employees . The displacement of old skills , trades and entire industries ( along with their dependent localities ) by more efficient new skills , trades and entire industries is now apt to span years , sometimes very few years , rather than generations . The same rate of structural change that favors prosperity , uplifting nations and regions around the world , now brutally exceeds the adaptive limits of many individuals , families and communities in the United States . The political right calls only for more deregulation and structural change . The left still offers more redistribution , by way of programs aimed at the poor . A vast political space in the worried middle is thus left vacant . The 1992 election-year caprices of Ross Perot briefly occupied that space in the United States , and Vladimir Zhirinovsky ' s bizarre excesses are now occupying the vacuum in the peculiar conditions of Russia , where personal economic insecurity is the only problem that counts for most people . Unless mainstream political forces respond more creatively , we may soon see worse .</TEXT>
