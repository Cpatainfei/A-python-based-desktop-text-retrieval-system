   <HEADLINE> TOUGH JUDGE ASSAILS ' THREE STRIKES ' ; CRIME : JURIST COMBINES PERSPECTIVES OF THE PRAGMATIST AND THE HUMANIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Superior_Court Judge Arthur Jean Jr . owned a railroad , the trains would run_on time . And on the bench in Long_Beach , Jean ' s a near-fanatic about settling cases to keep the number of trials from overwhelming the available courtrooms . Jean also describes himself as a &quot; voyeur into the human condition &quot; who savors the uniqueness of each defendant , weaknesses as well as strengths . It is both those perspectives -- that of the pragmatist and that of the humanist -- that have made him an outspoken opponent of California ' s tough new &quot; three strikes &quot; law . &quot; My complaint with the ' three strikes ' law as written . . . is that it seems to snare a passel of ne ' er-do-wells , lightweight offenders , petty thieves and that ilk , for which the sentences are utterly Draconian , &quot; he said in an interview . In addition , he argues , it is simply unworkable . The law multiplies the number of cases that go_to trial because the long prison sentences prescribed for third- and even second-time felons mean that defendants are not likely to plead guilty . &quot; The plain fact of the_matter is that every month . . . we get_in Municipal Court about 400 new felony complaints , &quot; said Jean , who is responsible_for scheduling criminal trials in the Long_Beach courthouse . Only 25 to 30 of those complaints can go_to trial without adding_to the backlog of cases . The others have to be settled through plea bargains . Already , he said , the growing number of pending criminal cases in Long_Beach is forcing a rearrangement of courtrooms . Starting tomorrow two of four civil court judges will be assigned to handle only criminal matters . Eventually , he said , all civil trials will be delayed indefinitely . Jean said Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti could ease the situation if he were more flexible . &quot; What bothers me most of all is that the D.A. says it is . . . a poorly drafted law . . . and he implies it has bad consequences , and yet he appears to be going full bore after every possible ' three strikes ' case , &quot; Jean said . A prosecutor for 14 years before his appointment to the bench by a law-and-order Republican , Gov . George Deukmejian , Jean is generally seen as a tough sentencer who has little sympathy for repeat offenders . He also has little sympathy for lawyers , or cases , that he believes are wasting time . The 51-year-old Jean , who was educated at Harvard Law_School , said the shoplifting case of Calvin Bailey was just such a case . Jean assailed the deputy district_attorney in the Bailey case , sarcastically asking him if he was &quot; proud &quot; of what he was doing . He said he could not go_along with the &quot; terrible , inhumane and unjust &quot; sentence of life in prison for Bailey , who had been convicted of two robberies in 1986 . He gave the man seven years in prison ; Garcetti ' s office is appealing . Jean is no stranger to confrontation . In 1988 , he also was at_odds with Garcetti , then the No . 2 man in the district_attorney ' s office , over the judge ' s method for clearing out a court-clogging glut of minor drug cases in Compton . To make room for trials involving more serious crimes , Jean was offering minor drug offenders 90 days in jail if they pleaded guilty . Garcetti ordered prosecutors to have Jean removed as the judge in all such cases because office policy was to require minimum sentences of 180 days . In 1992 , Jean released on probation many people with otherwise clean records who were charged with looting during the riots that followed the first Rodney King beating trial . That ran counter to then-Dist . Atty . Ira Reiner ' s demand for minimum sentences of at least a year . Then , as now , Jean ' s motivation was part practical , part philosophical . &quot; You have to understand that people are different , they do things for different motivations , and they have different possibilities in their lives , &quot; he said . In addition , he said , &quot; I have to balance justice with the financial and legal means I have at_hand . &quot; At the end of the day , we have to make_it work. &quot;</TEXT>
