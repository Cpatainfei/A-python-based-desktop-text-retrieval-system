   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; RESIGNATION OF HATA THROWS JAPAN FOR LOOP ; ECONOMY : TURMOIL AROUND TALKS TO CHOOSE A SUCCESSOR COULD THREATEN NATION ' S RECOVERY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As politicians negotiate to choose a successor to outgoing Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata , the renewed political upheaval clouds trade talks with the United States and may undermine prospects for Japan ' s economic recovery . The severity of the impact depends , however , on whether the current political confusion results in formation of a weak caretaker government composed of feuding factions , or leads instead to creation of a strengthened ruling coalition . The Tokyo stock_market responded with pessimism early today to Hata ' s Saturday resignation and the dollar ' s continued weakness against the yen . The 225-stock Nikkei index fell 448.09 points , or 2.2 % , to close morning trading at 20 # 318.66. &quot; With the yen being so strong , it ' s taken the steam out of any recovery in earnings for this year , &quot; said Keith Donaldson , equity strategist at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd . Economic fundamentals still point to a stronger dollar , but short-term currency trading is favoring the yen , he said . Hata ' s resignation is just one factor_in the yen ' s strength , he added . Faced with minority support in a fragmented parliament , which now has 15 different parties and groups , Hata won praise from some business_leaders . By resigning rather than calling new nationwide elections , Hata left the choice of a successor in the hands of parliament and avoided creating a more serious political vacuum . &quot; That was the best decision that Mr. Hata could make , &quot; said Shoichiro Toyoda , chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations . Parliament was scheduled to begin the process of choosing a new prime_minister this afternoon , although days could pass before a vote is held . Hata and his cabinet remain in office until replacements are picked . Japan ' s latest round of political turmoil comes just as trade talks with the United States have intensified and the yen has reached unprecedented strength . Japan also appears to be coming_out of a three-year recession , but any recovery remains fragile . Tokyo and Washington still aim to reach some kind of trade agreement before the Japanese prime_minister -- whoever it is -- meets with President Clinton in Naples immediately before the July 8-10 summit of leading industrialized nations . Prospects for anything very meaningful , however , seem to be fading because strong political leadership in Tokyo has generally been considered almost a prerequisite for achieving significant U.S.-Japan trade agreements . Negotiators are focused_on a_few priority sectors : insurance , automobiles and auto parts , and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment . Even before Hata ' s resignation , however , the two sides appeared to remain far apart in all these areas . Tokyo also seemed to be falling_behind on meeting an earlier pledge to announce a detailed economic stimulus package and market opening measures before the Naples summit . While some kind of announcement is expected , it may_not break much new ground . In addition to making_it more difficult for Tokyo to show the flexibility and political strength needed to come_to terms with Washington on contentious trade issues , political disorder in Japan may also provide a convenient excuse for inaction . Many bureaucrats within the Japanese government believe that Washington ' s demands are misguided in virtually all aspects of the trade talks , including calls_for specific market-opening measures and stimulative tax cuts . These officials generally wish to see the talks produce as little as possible . In their view , changes are already under way in Japan that will eventually reduce the country ' s large trade surplus . This includes the aging of Japan ' s population and the transfer of manufacturing capacity overseas by Japanese corporations . The Ministry of Finance is much more concerned about balancing Japan ' s budget in the early 21st Century than it is about providing further economic stimulus now through tax reduction . The Clinton_Administration , on the other hand , is pressuring Tokyo to implement long-range tax cuts_to stimulate domestic demand and thereby pull_in more foreign goods . A government advisory panel presented a vague compromise tax reform proposal last week . Japanese media interpreted it as suggesting that income_tax cuts already implemented for this year be extended indefinitely , but that they be more_than balanced with a sharp increase in consumption taxes starting April , 1997 . The long-term effect would be a tax increase , but the proposal might have a short-term stimulative effect . Failure to reach agreement with Washington on trade issues may create further pressure for continued strengthening of the yen against the dollar . Until recently , many market players believed that Washington favored a weaker dollar as a means to strengthen U.S. export competitiveness against Japan , which in 1993 ran a $ 60-billion bilateral trade surplus with the United States . But now Tokyo and Washington fear any new climb in the yen ' s strength . For the United States , any further dollar decline would increase pressure for higher interest_rates , which could make the dollar more attractive on currency markets but might chill economic_growth . Japan fears the effects of a stronger yen on its export industries . A strong yen makes Japanese goods more expensive in overseas markets . While Japan is banking on growth in domestic consumption , rather than exports , to lead the way_out of recession , any new blow to the profitability of exporting firms could hurt a recovery .</TEXT>
