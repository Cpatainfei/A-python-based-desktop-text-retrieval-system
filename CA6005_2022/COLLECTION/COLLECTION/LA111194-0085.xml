   <HEADLINE> GOP LIKELY TO SEEK TURNAROUND ON DEFENSE FUNDING ; SPENDING : REPUBLICANS ARE EXPECTED TO SEEK SPEEDED DEVELOPMENT OF NEW WEAPONS . PERIL TO MILITARY READINESS AT_ISSUE IN GLOBAL PEACE OPERATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Republican takeover of Congress next January is expected to lead to a noticeable increase in defense spending and heightened pressure on the Clinton_Administration to cut_back U.S. participation in global peace operations . Although no major revamping of the military is likely , analysts said that GOP lawmakers are likely to try to reverse defense cuts by adding as much as $ 20 billion more to the Pentagon ' s coffers over the next five years . The Republicans also are expected to press the Defense_Department to speed_up development of new weapons designed to defend U.S. troops against ballistic_missiles on the battlefield -- considered a point of vulnerability for American forces now . Defense has been a bone of contention for Republicans since the Clinton_Administration took_office . GOP lawmakers have bridled over the Administration ' s plan to speed_up the pace of the defense cutback . They also have criticized Administration decisions to deploy U.S. troops for peace operations , including those in Rwanda , Macedonia and Haiti . Republicans have said that those operations siphon_off badly needed operating funds and eventually cut_into military readiness . The &quot; contract with America &quot; that House GOP leaders drafted before the election called_for restoring money that the Administration has cut from the defense budget and reimposing budget restrictions designed to protect it from raids by Congress . A similar plan outlined by Republican senators earlier this year called_for adding $ 20 billion to the defense budget over five years . But analysts said that it is too early to tell how far GOP lawmakers actually will go , particularly given the grim budgetary realities that Congress will face . With overall budget limits already tight -- and with the GOP now pledged to cut taxes and reduce the federal budget_deficit -- there will not be enough money left to revamp the defense_program substantially , defense experts said . Andrew F . Krepinevich , director of the nonpartisan Defense Budget Project , estimated that the most that Republicans will be able to increase defense spending will be about $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion a year . &quot; We don ' t expect the defense budget to rise very much , &quot; Krepinevich said . Moreover , for all_the talk_about changes , Republicans on the House and Senate Armed Services committees are not that far from the positions of their Democratic colleagues . Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , and his likely replacement , Sen . Strom Thurmond ( R-S.C. ) , see most issues essentially alike . In the House , Rep . Floyd Spence ( R-S.C. ) , who probably will be named chairman of that chamber ' s Armed Services Committee , is largely in_agreement with the panel ' s current majority . Rep . Ronald V . Dellums ( D-Oakland ) now chairs the committee . Differences between House and Senate versions of the defense bill have been negligible over the last two years . Analysts expect these changes once Republicans take_control of Congress : * Heightened pressure from lawmakers to limit the use of U.S. troops in peacekeeping operations , particularly in cases where the military budget does not contain funds to finance such ventures without depleting the services ' operating_budgets . * A new push to finance development of a weapon designed to destroy ballistic_missiles that threaten U.S. troops on the battlefield -- a project that the Clinton_Administration has downgraded . Some Republicans also want to revive the Ronald Reagan-era &quot; Star Wars &quot; program . * Added monies for procurement of major weapons_systems , such_as the Air_Force ' s proposed F-22 advanced fighter_aircraft or the Army ' s soon-to-be-developed Comanche attack helicopter , both of which the Administration has hinted it may cancel or delay . * Pressure for a speedup in the admission of Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and other former East European_countries as full members of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . Nations of the former Soviet_Union have raised concerns over granting full status to those countries and Clinton , mindful of the issue , has granted them what amounts to only apprenticeship status . * A move to restore the so-called &quot; firewalls &quot; in the congressional budget process that previously had protected the defense budget from raids by lawmakers who wanted to channel defense monies into domestic programs . At the same time , the GOP takeover is apt to relax pressure on the Pentagon to eliminate duplication . Nunn and others have been pushing a project in which the armed_services would redefine functions that each service should perform . Just how the Administration will react to the Republican demands is not certain . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry told reporters Thursday that the Pentagon is preparing its fiscal 1996 budget_for submission in February as though no changes had taken_place . But Perry also expressed some skepticism about the ability of the GOP lawmakers to square their various demands with one another , hinting that it may_not be possible to boost defense spending and reduce the overall budget_deficit at_the_same_time , as the Republicans have pledged . &quot; When they start putting their programs together , . . . they ' ll find some degree of conflict between these two objectives , &quot; Perry said . &quot; My planning for the defense budget . . . is based on the same assumption of . . . resources that I made before the election. &quot;</TEXT>
