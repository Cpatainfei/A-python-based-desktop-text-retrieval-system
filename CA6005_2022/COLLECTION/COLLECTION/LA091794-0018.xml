   <HEADLINE> TO RWANDANS RETURNING FROM EXILE , POSSESSION IS NINE-TENTHS OF THE LAW ; AFRICA : TUTSIS COMING_BACK AFTER YEARS AWAY ARE TAKING GOODS , HOMES OF THOSE WHO FLED . LEADERS ' PLEDGE OF FAIRNESS MAY BE HARD TO FULFILL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To the victors and survivors belong the refrigerators , Toyotas , hillside villas and the Kigali Night Club . At least for the moment and , in many cases , certainly forever . &quot; Immediately after the war , there was . . . looting everywhere , &quot; Penninah Mbabazi explained . &quot; People started running here and there , to other people ' s houses , picking things . The refrigerators were the first to be looted -- refrigerators , radios , cookers. &quot; The 32-year-old woman knows what she ' s talking_about : Mbabazi is now the &quot; manager &quot; of the Kigali Night Club , a one-story concrete blockhouse with a veranda bar overlooking Rwanda ' s capital . On Fridays and Saturdays , it attracts up_to 1 # 000 people to guzzle beer and soft_drinks . And who is the owner ? &quot; We don ' t know , really , &quot; said the soft-spoken Mbabazi , with a shy smile . Less than three months ago , she still lived_in Uganda with her daughter , 10 , and son , 5 . &quot; The things we are owning now are not ours. &quot; As a result of Rwanda ' s genocide , civil_war and takeover by the Rwandan Patriotic Front-dominated government , a New Deal of sorts is under way in this isolated , strife-weary Central African_country . Among the beneficiaries are members of the Tutsi ethnic minority who , like Mbabazi , lived until this summer in exile , in many cases for decades . The losers are Rwanda ' s hundreds of thousands of dead , and the armies of refugees from the dominant Hutu ethnic_group who have fled into Zaire , Tanzania , Burundi and other countries , leaving their homes and most of their belongings behind . To entice those wretched , often terrified people back , and to prove the claim that theirs is an African revolution with a difference , Rwanda ' s new rulers have insisted that the goodies that people such_as Mbabazi have &quot; picked &quot; aren ' t really theirs . But in a traumatized and poor land whose capital still lacks even such basic services as street lights , electricity and running water , enforcement of that policy can only be sporadic at best . &quot; No matter who a person is , he has a right to his house , &quot; President Pasteur Bizimungu told a recent rally in the southern town of Butare . And that , Bizimungu said , includes suspects in last April ' s massacres . But from some Rwandans , who had fled into exile after an earlier anti-Tutsi uprising in 1959 killed an estimated 100 # 000 people , the new government is clearly expecting too_much . A middle-aged man in sunglasses who returned to his homeland after 32 years told Bizimungu that he did not understand why he shouldn ' t occupy the once-empty house he now lives_in . &quot; Am I supposed to spend my life leaving places with my mattress ? &quot; he asked . And many_more exiles are returning now , keen on finding places to live and occupations to keep them busy . According to the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees , 100 # 000 Rwandans who had long lived_in Uganda to the north have recently crossed the border with 130 # 000 head of livestock in hasty search of new homes and farms . &quot; We are now trying to work with the government to find land for them , &quot; said Janvier de Riedmatten , deputy representative of the U.N. agency in Rwanda . &quot; If this problem is not tackled quickly , it could become a major issue. &quot; The U.N. agency ' s efforts have been only partly successful , however . Fifty thousand of the returnees have stayed_on the lands offered them , including tracts once reserved for hunting in Kagera National_Park , De Riedmatten said . The rest of the former exiles , he said , are continuing south , eagerly scavenging for empty huts and shacks and abandoned pastures and fields . And the land grab in Rwanda is clearly due_to get bigger : The U.N. refugee office estimates that about 1 million Rwandans had been living_in exile in surrounding countries when the old order collapsed this year in mass_murder and civil_war . Across Africa , the possession of political power has often been synonymous with the opportunity to get rich . A 1973 coup by the then-minister of defense and future president , Juvenal Habyarimana , opened the way for his clan from Rwanda ' s northwest to line its pockets . Habyarimana was killed April 6 when his plane was shot down over Kigali . When leaders of the defeated hard-line Hutu regime that succeeded Habyarimana fled across the border into Zaire , they took fleets of official and private vehicles , stocks of arms and a large chunk of the national treasury with them . People in the Rwandan Patriotic Front and their sympathizers apparently think : Now it ' s our turn . &quot; This is definitely our mother_country , even if it has been bad to us , &quot; Mbabazi said as she sat at an unpainted wooden desk near the bar , puzzling over thick ledgers that also belong , or belonged , to the bar ' s vanished owner . Her husband was a fighter with the Front ' s victorious army , but she hasn ' t seen him in months . She is not sure if he is alive . Crisscrossing the country , Toyota pickup_trucks can sometimes be seen carting young Front soldiers holding_on to sofas or refrigerators . At the_French Embassy , aghast security personnel estimate that the ransacking of the chancellery , ambassador ' s residence and cultural center after the staff fled last April will cost French taxpayers $ 20 million . France had been one of the chief supporters of the old Habyarimana regime , and at the embassy people have no doubt that the pillage and gleeful vandalism were committed by Rwandan Patriotic Front soldiers or their civilian supporters . &quot; This was their way of saying , ' Thank_you , ' &quot; a police_officer flown in from Toulouse to help get the mission running again said dryly . &quot; They stole the cars . They trashed the computers . They thought they were television_sets but couldn ' t make them work. &quot; &quot; Of course , acts of indiscipline have taken_place , but the leaders have said again and again they will be punished , &quot; said Canadian Maj . Jean-Guy Plante , spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission here , in reference_to the Rwandan Patriotic Front ' s forces . &quot; Generally speaking , they have good discipline. &quot; That appears to be changing as the victorious army , many of whose troops are penniless teen-agers or exiles , seek other occupations now that there is no longer an enemy to fight . U.N. officials said that soldiers manning checkpoints in Kigali have been shaking down traders or extorting money before merchants are allowed to even see their goods . In some locales , soldiers have reportedly engaged in cattle-rustling . In the capital , according to one estimate , wholesale massacres and flight have halved the population to 300 # 000 . That means a lot of empty dwellings and stores , and plenty of temptation . The city ' s new mayor , a Tutsi RPF major named Rose Kabue , is trying to juggle the conflicting requirements of the ban on property-grabbing and the pressing need to house returning exiles or Rwandans displaced from their own homes . &quot; We are allowing them to occupy whatever houses they can get_on the understanding that when the owners show_up , they will vacate them , &quot; Kabue said in a newspaper interview . Time will tell what the Front ' s army and officials do with the buildings they have taken . The government ' s de_facto headquarters is in what had been one of Kigali ' s swankiest hotels , the Meridien . In Kiyovu , the city ' s poshest quarter , young soldiers of the new regime stand_guard outside elegant , shaded villas now occupied by their superiors . The seeds for continued bitter social conflict are obvious , especially if the main winners of the Rwandan New Deal are perceived by Hutus to be the minority Tutsi , who from the 15th Century used feudal land ownership and a lord-peasant system to rule a Hutu community almost six times bigger than theirs . Like many Tutsis , Mbabazi fled Rwanda decades ago , in 1964 , or two years after independence . She was then 2 years old and grew_up in a refugee camp in Uganda . She returned to her homeland in a taxi in July for the first time , after the Front ' s soldiers had driven troops of the ousted government out of Kigali . &quot; When we came_back , we were all anxious for something to do , &quot; she said . &quot; We roamed about , looking_for something , and came_upon this empty building. &quot; Another Tutsi returnee , Janes Mbabazi , who is not a relative , nominated herself as the club ' s &quot; director. &quot; The stock had been looted , so the women spent some of the cash they had brought with them to buy cases of beer and Coca-Cola . They opened July 15 and have not gotten_around_to fixing a gaping slash in the corrugated roof cut by an exploding Katyusha rocket . But they did manage to find a generator to chill the Uganda-brewed Bell Brand lager they serve . &quot; There were so many generators lying_around , so we picked one up , &quot; the Kigali Night Club ' s manager said . Penninah Mbabazi and her children also moved_into a three-bedroom house in Kigali that had been abandoned and looted . Unlike some_other returnees , she was not_able to grab an abandoned car . &quot; I was unfortunate , &quot; she said . If people who live_in the Kimuhurura district are right , the two women who now run the Kigali Night Club do not have to worry about a property dispute anytime soon . The establishment , they say , was owned by the son of Habyarimana , the late president , a person who would hardly be welcomed back by the new people in_charge . &quot; The things we are owning are not ours , &quot; Mbabazi said anyway . &quot; If the owners come , they can take them . If there is any confusion , we can always negotiate. &quot; On a nearby road , young boys picked_over the carcasses of stolen and abandoned cars in search of something of_value . Two handsome chestnut horses , a male and a female , ambled aimlessly up the steep hill , poking their noses into the grass at the roadside . Their owner had either been killed or fled . Now they too were there for the picking .</TEXT>
