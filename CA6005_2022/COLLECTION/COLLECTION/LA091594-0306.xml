   <HEADLINE> WATERS VOICES CONCERNS ABOUT ALLEGED BIAS OF HAWTHORNE POLICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rep . Maxine Waters has asked the federal Justice_Department to make_sure the Hawthorne Police_Department is not discriminating against black officers and applicants before federal money is released for a community policing program . In a letter to U.S. Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , Waters ( D-Compton ) raised concerns about the department ' s hiring practices and racial makeup . The force has only three African Americans among 90 sworn officers , or about 3 % , city officials say . By contrast , the city ' s population is 28 % African American , according to 1990 Census figures . The department also has not adopted an affirmative_action plan . &quot; When you have three . . . and no affirmative_action plan , that appears to be a problem , &quot; said Patrick Lacefield , spokesman for Waters . In addition , a black applicant who was turned_down and an officer on the Hawthorne force filed separate discrimination complaints this year against the Police_Department . Waters brought the situation to the Justice_Department ' s attention because the complaints and local news_reports about them created &quot; anxiety in the community , &quot; the letter said . In May , Hawthorne was given preliminary approval for a $ 553 # 000 federal grant to hire six new officers . But before the money is released , U.S. Department_of_Justice officials said , police_departments must answer a series of questions , including whether any charges of discrimination have been settled or are pending and whether an affirmative_action program is in place . A grant cannot be awarded to a department if systematic discrimination is found , and if a department violates requirements after the grant has been given , the money could be withdrawn , justice officials said . However , they said , they try to fix the discrimination problem before they withdraw a grant . &quot; The goal is to bring ( departments ) into compliance , not to penalize the community , &quot; said Harri J . Kramer , director of justice programs . In one of the cases pending against the department , a former Gardena police_officer complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that he was denied a job in Hawthorne because he is black . Dorian Burton , who is now with the Inglewood Police_Department , said he was taken_off Hawthorne ' s hiring list even though he finished sixth out of 166 applicants on standardized tests and oral_exams during the last hiring cycle . Police officials said incidents uncovered in a routine background check disqualified Burton , but they declined to elaborate . Burton said those incidents included alleged charges of sexual_harassment . In the other case , Roosevelt Matthews , a 13-year veteran of the Hawthorne department , filed a complaint with the state_Department of Fair Employment and Housing , claiming he was harassed by a white supervisor . When he complained , he said , critical letters from his supervisors were placed in his personnel file . Police officials would not comment on the specifics of the complaint but said they have responded to the charges and are confident they will prevail in both cases . In addition , in 1987 then-Sgt . Don Jackson charged that officers used racial slurs when describing minorities . The city settled the case out of court , and Jackson has since left the force . The Jackson suit spurred city officials to draft an affirmative_action plan , but that plan was never presented to the council . The city_manager in_charge of the project is no longer working for the city . The suit also led to sensitivity training for all officers , Chief Stephen R . Port said , and derogatory language is not tolerated . Hawthorne personnel director Douglas K . Gates said those three complaints are the only ones the department has had in 13 years . &quot; I think they will find we do a good job . We try to recruit from all different minorities , &quot; Port said . But critics say the small number of African Americans on the force points to a discriminatory pattern . &quot; The disparity in the numbers , &quot; coupled with the pending complaints , shows discrimination , said Lionel Broussard , a key player in racial discrimination suits filed against Centinela Valley Union High_School District last year . The Justice_Department found &quot; a racially hostile environment &quot; at the district , which includes Hawthorne schools . The district later paid more_than $ 500 # 000 to black administrators . City officials say that they are trying to hire more minorities but that there is no connection between low numbers of African Americans on the force and racial discrimination . Officials are updating the affirmative_action plan with new census data and will send it to the City_Council in the coming months , Gates said . The force now includes three African Americans , five Asians , 10 Latinos and 72 whites . Of eight recently hired officers who are still on probation , four are minorities , including two African Americans , an Asian and a Latino .</TEXT>
