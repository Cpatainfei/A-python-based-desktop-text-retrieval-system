   <TEXT> They ' re back . Argentina and Diego Maradona , a.k.a. Captain Lazarus , came storming back to the World Cup on Tuesday in better form and spirits than when they left it four years ago . &quot; I answered my critics on the field , &quot; said the incomparable , incorrigible Maradona , diamond earring sparkling , drug and physical travails apparently just bad memories in a sweet moment of victory . &quot; It was a very emotional goal for me . I had been waiting a long while for it. &quot; With game but outclassed Greece as their foil , the 1990 Cup runners-up scored early and often , cruising to a 4-0 victory in one opening-round game at which -- at last -- nobody talked_about the weather . What heat ? Under glowering , leaky skies , it was a why-didn ' t-I-bring-a-jacket afternoon . For a partisan but good-natured 53 # 486 in Boston ' s suburban Foxboro Stadium halfway to Rhode Island , it came_down to a struggle of the blue and white stripes . The difference was the blue ; the Greek sea-dark , the_Argentine sky-light -- and all bright . &quot; We played a marvelous game , &quot; Argentine Coach Alfio Basile said . The usually affable Greek coach , Alkis Panagoulias said , not bothering to disguise his distress -- or his anger , &quot; I am very disappointed . I never expected my players to be afraid of the Argentines. &quot; It started badly quickly for the Greeks in their World Cup debut . And it got steadily worse . In the second minute , the crowd still squirming on wet seats , a lightning Argentine counterattack produced a goal . Midfielder Diego Simeone shot a sideline pass to long-haired forward Gabriel Batistuta , known around the soccer world as &quot; Archangel Gabriel &quot; and &quot; Batigol. &quot; &quot; I beat two defenders and then there was only the goalie , &quot; said Batistuta , who plays professionally for Fiorentina in Italy . The early goal , which seemed to sap the Greeks as surely as it silenced their thousands of supporters , set the tone for a game that was played throughout at Argentina ' s pace -- tight control , no speeding . Greece managed eight shots to Argentina ' s 21 and never seriously challenged . In a last-minute switch , Argentina replaced veteran Sergio Goycochea in goal with 28-year-old Luis Islas , who passed a quiet afternoon . For Batistuta , the opening goal was only the beginning . He scored a hat trick on a gray afternoon , becoming the tournament ' s leading scorer . Batistuta scored his second goal , on a pass_by defender Jose Chamot , at the end of the first_half . After that , Greek goalkeeper Antonis Minou had no chance . He was cleanly beaten by Batistuta ' s third goal , on a penalty shot at game ' s end , after a hand ball . It was Maradona ' s goal , though , that will be_on the replays . At 33 , he was the greatest question_mark on a problematical team from a soccer powerhouse that has won the Cup two times . Since 1990 , when he carried Argentina to the final , Maradona has been suspended for cocaine use and bounced ingloriously from teams in Italy , Spain and Argentina . Many fans and soccer experts had written him off . On Tuesday he returned , slimmer , uncertain at first but with that same awesome touch that has made him one of the most famous soccer players for more_than a decade . In the first_half , Greek defender Panagiotis Tsalouhidis did everything to slow Maradona except tie his shoelaces together , and he earned a yellow card in the process . &quot; I gained confidence in the first_half , &quot; Maradona said . And at the start of the second_half , the Greek defense gave him a bit more room to maneuver . Big mistake . At the 60th minute , midfielders Fernando Redondo and Simeone gave Maradona the ball just outside the penalty area . In the next instant it had somehow split through two defenders into a corner of the net after a left-footed blast . &quot; To answer the questions , Diego is in very good physical condition , &quot; Basile said . &quot; His touch is still magic and every day now he will be better. &quot; With five minutes to play , Basile calculatingly substituted for Argentina ' s captain , and as Maradona trotted off the field the dejected Greek blues joined the ecstatic Argentine blues in saluting him .</TEXT>
