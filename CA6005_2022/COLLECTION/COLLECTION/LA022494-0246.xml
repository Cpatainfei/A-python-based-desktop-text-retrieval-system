   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; FEARING THE WORST ; RECENT HIGH-PROFILE CASES BRING VIOLENCE CLOSE TO HOME , BUT DESPITE PERCEPTIONS , THE CRIME_RATE MAY ACTUALLY BE DECLINING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A masked gunman bursts into a meeting of police_officers in Torrance and kills two of them before he is killed . The daughter of an El Segundo City_Council member is murdered in her home and her young daughter ' s throat slashed . A police_officer in Manhattan Beach is shot dead while his young nephew looks_on . Eleven people are gunned_down in Inglewood in just two days , the worst outburst of violence in that city ' s history . At an upscale mall restaurant in Redondo Beach , gunfire erupts during an argument among three men , two of them wearing bulletproof_vests ; one man is shot seven times and dies on the restaurant floor . It has been a bloody few months in the South Bay . There was a time not so_long ago , many residents say , when the South Bay seemed almost immune to the violence that besets other parts of Los Angeles . Particularly in the upscale beach communities and the even more upscale &quot; bridle_path &quot; towns of the Palos Verdes Peninsula , urban violence was something people watched on TV or read about in the newspapers . It seldom if ever hit close to home . Not anymore . During the past two months , two small-town police_departments that had never lost an officer in the line_of_duty learned what it was like to bury three of_their_own . Small-town residents have seen stories of crime in their cities splashed across the front pages . &quot; Wanted posters &quot; showing a police sketch of a suspected cop killer -- the gunman who killed Manhattan Beach Police_Officer Martin Ganz -- are now a fixture in countless South Bay stores , offices and public buildings . In interviews with South Bay residents from El Segundo to the Palos Verdes Peninsula , people say they feel they ' re facing a crime onslaught , with their backs against the sea . It has affected them in myriad ways . Faye Flatland , 60 , who with her husband runs a Hawthorne bookkeeping business , often removes her diamond wedding_band or turns the stone inside her finger when she goes_out . &quot; I never used to do that , &quot; she says . For Theresa Sanchez , 32 , of Hermosa Beach , crime has prompted a career change and probably a change of address . She had wanted to be a cop , and was scheduled to take the Los Angeles Police_Department qualification test last month . But after the Ganz killing in December , Sanchez decided to become a nurse instead . &quot; I like the idea of leaving the state , &quot; Sanchez says . &quot; I have a feeling it ' s only going_to get_worse around here. &quot; Crime forced Virginia Benedict , 75 , of Gardena to chain down the hood on her 1971 Chevy Nova to protect her car_battery -- and even that wasn ' t protection enough . &quot; Four times they stole the battery , &quot; she says . &quot; I had a chain lock on it and they pulled that right off . . . . I ' ve lived_in Los Angeles all my life . We never even used to lock our doors . It ' s really worse now than it has ever been . People just don ' t seem to care. &quot; Bob Deurloo , 48 , a retired firefighter in Torrance , always calls ahead to friends and gives them a &quot; flight plan &quot; describing the route he will take_to meet them . &quot; That way , &quot; he says , &quot; if I don ' t show_up , they ' ll know something ' s wrong. &quot; For Don Schima , 28 , of Redondo Beach , crime has changed the nature of birthday and Christmas_presents . Because his 1984 Toyota pickup has been broken_into three times in the past few years , he gets auto anti-theft devices . &quot; When I grew_up here , it was great area , &quot; says Schima . &quot; Crime wasn ' t a problem. &quot; Like almost everybody else in the South Bay , Schima longs for &quot; the good old days &quot; -- the good old low-crime days . The irony is that , in terms of crime , the &quot; good old days &quot; weren ' t always that good . * Consider , for example , Redondo Beach . According to FBI statistics , compared to the good old days , murder last year was up only slightly ( three cases in 1980 and four in 1993 ) , reported rapes are down by more_than half ( 46 to 18 ) , robberies are more or less level ( 151 to 145 ) , aggravated assault is up ( 177 to 222 ) and burglaries are way down ( 1 # 137 to 848 ) . Or how about El Segundo , where residents are understandably worried about crime after the murder of a city councilman ' s daughter and the slashing of her child ? Again , it ' s a mixed bag : fewer murders in 1992 ( the last year for which statistics were available ) than in 1980 , fewer reported rapes , more robberies , only half as_many aggravated assaults , far fewer burglaries ( see chart , Page 12 ) . Even Inglewood , the &quot; All American City &quot; that recently made headlines when 11 people were shot in two nights of gang carnage , actually has seen crime go_down in most categories in the past dozen years . In 1980 there were 54 murders in Inglewood , compared to 44 in 1993 . Some other South Bay cities also have experienced declines in the crime_rate over the past 13 years , while others have seen the crime_rate remain more or less flat in most categories . Still others have seen increases , usually relatively slight , in many or most crime categories . Although the numbers vary , the overall picture is clear : Bad as it is , crime in the South Bay has not increased by astonishing percentages , but fear and concern about crime has . To police_officers , for whom crime statistics are like job performance evaluations , the widespread perception that crime is worse is a little baffling . &quot; When I look_at the statistics , it seems like ( the crime_rate ) is pretty flat , &quot; says El Segundo Police Sgt . Bill Fleming . &quot; Some of the crime is just more dramatic , more sensational. &quot; &quot; When you see a string of high-profile crimes like we ' ve had recently , it hits_home , &quot; says Lt . Jim Oneal of the Lomita sheriff ' s station , which provides police protection to Lomita and three Palos Verdes Peninsula cities . &quot; But over the past five years we ' ve actually maintained a very low level of crime . We get occasional little spikes , but overall , the trend is steady. &quot; Politicians , who also keep a close eye on crime statistics , note that crime perceptions do not necessarily reflect crime reality . &quot; Factually , crime has at worst stayed even , and at best has gone_down , &quot; says Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Steve Kuykendall , a member of several law_enforcement and public safety boards and commissions . &quot; But the perception is that crime is increasing. &quot; Harbor area Councilman Rudy Svorinich , whose district stretches from San Pedro to Watts , is confident that soon the truth -- crime in the harbor area is falling -- will win out over the misconception that crime is_on the rise . &quot; It is the responsibility of those of us in elected office -- commanders in the field , officers in the field , community leaders , neighborhood watch groups -- to inform the residents of our particular areas how crime is being successfully abated . . . . But I think perceptions die_hard . that ' s the problem. &quot; But at times , even Svorinich must remind himself that crime in his district is dropping rather than rising . Svorinich ' s San Pedro City_Hall office was burglarized twice in the past two weeks . Thieves stole two VCRs , a computer_keyboard , a typewriter and Svorinich ' s mail . &quot; We ' ve had to really beef_up our security , &quot; he says with a sigh . * All this doesn ' t mean that South Bay residents are paranoid about crime . In fact , South Bay residents are simply mirroring a national trend . A recent Los Angeles Times poll showed that the number of Americans who rate crime as the No . 1 problem in the nation more_than doubled in the past six months -- from 21 % to 43 % . This comes despite the fact that violent crime in the United States actually has been decreasing in the past few years . And in human terms , perception may be more important than statistics . When your car is broken into , or the woman down the street is raped , or the cop who came_over when you thought you heard a burglar is suddenly shot dead in the street during a routine traffic stop , statistics become meaningless . If crime is the problem people believe it is , what can be done about it ? For most police_officers in the South Bay , one answer to the crime problem is more cops . &quot; As we saw after the earthquake , visible policing in the streets is an absolute deterrent to crime , &quot; says Hawthorne Police_Chief Stephen Port . &quot; The problem with it is that it ' s very expensive . . . . More police is probably the prayer and wish of any police_chief you talk to. &quot; But even some police agree that cops alone cannot stop all crime . &quot; Naturally , everyone looks_to increased levels of police in the streets , &quot; says Lt . Charles Schultz , Lawndale liaison at the Lennox sheriff ' s station . &quot; In the long_run , we ' ve been doing that and we ' ve found_out that you can never have enough . I think it ' s important we start identifying the social causes of crime as a way to solve it . . . . One of the single biggest ( factors ) is the deterioration of the family unit. &quot; In keeping with national trends , South Bay politicians tend to favor harsher penalties for criminals . &quot; Three-strikes-and-you ' re-out is not enough , &quot; says Lawndale Mayor Harold E . Hofmann , referring to legislation that would put repeat felons behind bars for life . &quot; And we ' re going to have to start treating 14- , 15- and 16-year-olds like adults . We ' re going to have to start saying , ' This is wrong and you ' re going to have to pay_for it. ' &quot; &quot; When you have a court system that doesn ' t do its job , that counteracts what the police do , &quot; says Hawthorne Mayor Larry Guidi . Other elected officials believe that citizens can stop crime by reporting criminals to the police . &quot; Things will get better if people themselves participate in the process , &quot; says Mayor Edward Vincent of Inglewood , where officials recently instituted a curfew for teen-agers in an effort to combat crime . &quot; People know everything . They know who ' s stealing , who ' s dealing dope , who ' s committing crimes -- people know it . We have to work collectively to solve these problems and it will be done. &quot; Still other elected officials opt_for the &quot; root cause &quot; approach to crime . &quot; It ' s a difficult task , but we have to involve the young people , the gang members , and try to get them to have some sense of pride in the community , &quot; says Carson Councilwoman Sylvia L . Muise-Perez . &quot; The important thing is getting_to the young people before they go_in a wrong direction . . . . I think we ' re doing a little of that . Ordinary South Bay residents have their own ideas about stemming crime -- ranging from the violent to the merely strict to the compassionate . &quot; People should carry guns in their homes , &quot; says John Keenan , 63 , of Redondo Beach . &quot; Citizens should be blowing a_few ( criminals ' ) heads_off . That would help. &quot; &quot; The way I feel , our judicial_system is not punishing the criminals . This is problem No . 1 , &quot; says Art Cramer , 49 , who is part owner of a liquor_store in Torrance -- a store that has been robbed twice . &quot; We don ' t want crime , but we don ' t want to punish the criminals . People should be locked_up for 20 years if they do a robbery . . . not five years. &quot; &quot; I think they need more police , &quot; says Guyla DeVilbiss , 37 , a Lawndale preschool teacher . &quot; In the schools , I think they need to have more after-school programs to keep latchkey kids out of trouble. &quot; &quot; We need to get more jobs for people and more education from the parents on down , &quot; says Jin Wong , 58 , also of Lawndale . &quot; We can get_along . We don ' t have to fight and kill each other . We ' re all human beings. &quot; Maybe all_of those proposed solutions would work ; maybe none would , at least not alone . But if statistics are any help , South Bay residents may take_heart from the knowledge that crime , while admittedly terrible , may_not be quite as rampant as it seems . They may also take_heart from the brave words of an El Segundo police_officer . &quot; You always have to have an optimistic view , &quot; says Sgt . Bill Fleming . &quot; If you become worried that the world is going_to hell , you ' ve already got one foot in the losers ' bracket. &quot; South Bay Crime 06 # 31 , 10 # 06 , 09 # 12 , 10 AGGRAVATED CITY HOMICIDE RAPE ROBBERY ASSAULT BURGLARY Avalon ( pop . 2 # 918 ) 1980 2 1 14 63 1992 2 33 27 Carson ( 83 # 995 ) 1980 14 33 284 539 1 # 693 1992 12 30 389 857 1 # 118 El Segundo ( 15 # 223 ) 1980 1 11 40 52 418 1992 6 53 25 251 Gardena ( 48 # 847 ) 1980 8 25 492 194 1 # 388 1992 13 26 655 372 853 Hawthorne ( 71 # 349 ) 1980 12 57 601 428 1 # 558 1992 18 49 777 745 1 # 295 Hermosa Beach ( 18 # 249 ) 1980 16 39 84 374 1992 7 35 60 275 Inglewood ( 109 # 602 ) 1980 54 132 1 # 495 461 3 # 072 1992 37 67 1 # 300 1 # 137 1 # 988 Lawndale ( 27 # 331 ) 1980 4 17 133 165 690 1992 5 7 205 354 393 Lomita ( 19 # 382 ) 1980 7 40 113 352 1992 1 6 50 229 215 Manhattan Beach ( 32 # 063 ) 1980 1 25 61 38 847 1992 7 72 70 532 Palos Verdes Estates ( 13 # 512 ) 1980 1 4 4 12 141 1992 1 1 3 16 84 Rancho Palos Verdes ( 41 # 659 ) 1980 11 7 45 439 1992 1 2 20 76 250 Redondo Beach ( 60 # 167 ) 1980 3 46 151 177 1 # 137 1992 15 173 220 875 Rolling Hills ( 1 # 871 ) 1980 4 18 1992 4 7 Rolling Hills Estates ( 7 # 789 ) 1980 1 7 26 161 1992 8 23 68 Torrance ( 133 # 107 ) 1980 6 65 333 302 2 # 091 1992 2 27 498 357 1 # 533 Source : California Department_of_Justice</TEXT>
