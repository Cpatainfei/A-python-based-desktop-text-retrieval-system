   <HEADLINE> TRENDS ; DIVINE INSPIRATION ; RELIGIOUS OBJECTS ARE GETTING REVERENTIAL TREATMENT IN THE HOME , WHERE THE DEVOTEDHAVE REPRODUCTIONS AND ANTIQUES . SUCH WORLDLY GOODS CREATE A SANCTUARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stained glass windows , wooden pews , crucifixes , statues and icons -- some of which once graced old churches and some always meant for personal use -- are increasingly being used as design elements in homes . Some of those using these objects to adorn their living areas are moved by genuine religious sentiment , some by a more worldly interest in the latest design trend , some by a fascination on both levels . Nancy Sinner -- yes , it ' s her real name , and , no , it ' s not why she collects what she does -- has filled her townhouse in Orange with so many religious artifacts that when friends come_by they often ask , &quot; Do we have to start praying ? &quot; Crucifixes and icons adorn the walls . Her shelves and tabletops are crammed with statues representing Jesus and Mary , crosses of all kinds , candlesticks and fonts . &quot; I once looked_at a church steeple and thought , ' Where could I put that ? ' But I decided it would look_out of place on top of my townhome , &quot; Sinner says . Her collection mixes freely with her other eclectic furnishings and has spread throughout her bedroom and bath . Among her rarer pieces : a two-foot-high wooden santo ( an image of a saint ) holding baby Jesus in one hand and a skull in the other that dates_back to the early 1800s ; a prayer box she found in a thrift shop with a carving of images of Mary and Jesus and a drawer below for storing a rosary , candle or other religious items , and a mid-1800s altar_boy bank with a bobbing head used to collect money for missionaries . &quot; I love living with spiritual things . They ' re beautiful to look_at , &quot; Sinner says . &quot; I ' m Catholic , and my grandmother was very Catholic . She loved crucifixes . I ' ve loved religious things for years , and now decorators are really using them a lot. &quot; Interest in collecting religious artifacts has emerged as a trend over the past four or five years . Cher is an avid collector , and Madonna -- the celebrity , that is -- is said to have furthered the trend with her mania for crosses . Not until a year ago , however , did Orange County antique dealers notice a big jump in the demand for holy objects . Some buyers use the religious items as they were intended , say , to set_up a small shrine or altar in the home for private worship . Others find radically different uses for religious artifacts . Abbie Francis , sales supervisor for the Old Chicago Antique Market in Fountain Valley , which usually has a_few church furnishings on_hand , recalls how a preacher ' s pulpit was purchased by a homeowner and converted into a bar . Pews are often shortened and used as benches on porches , in hallways or with tables , Francis says . Most religious articles come from churches that have been torn_down . The churches auction_off their furnishings , which are purchased by antique dealers and passed along to buyers , says Johnny Lambrecht , owner of Cardinal Church Furniture in Azusa , which sells old and new church furnishings . &quot; We ' ve become more sensitive to older buildings and want to preserve their content , &quot; Lambrecht says . &quot; In the 1940s through 1960s everybody wanted to modernize . that ' s how a lot of the pews ended_up on the market today. &quot; In this machine-made age , people have begun to appreciate the handcrafted artistry of pre-1950s pews , which often had elaborate rosettes and Gothic_arches hand-carved out of fine Appalachian red_oak , Lambrecht says . While the recent closure of some older_Catholic_churches has added_to the supply of artifacts , antique dealers say that increased demand is rapidly drying_up their inventory . Still , a diligent collector can find religious items at antique stores , flea_markets , thrift stores and estate sales . Sinner , an antique dealer by trade ( although she never sells her religious items ) , has a knack for finding rare pieces for just a_few dollars . Many of her best items have been found at garage sales and thrift shops . She found her favorite piece , a 1930s-era statue in the image of the Christ child wearing a tiny crown , at a garage sale for $ 10 , and she recently came_across a turn-of-the-century Staffordshire porcelain font selling at the Goodwill for $ 1 . Some of Sinner ' s finds are campy -- such_as her plastic snow globe with a Madonna image . Other items are a touch morbid , such_as the tiny cross that inexplicably conceals a switchblade or the stained- glass lantern with a brass cross on top that Sinner says came_off of an old funeral car . Some truly fine religious specimens can be found through antique dealers . Richard Yeakel , owner of Richard Yeakel Antiques in Laguna Beach , has rare artifacts that go_back centuries , such_as 13th-Century chalices and 12th-Century religious art . When Pope John Paul II visited Los Angeles two years ago , he borrowed four pieces from Yeakel to use for a private Mass , including a 15th-Century triptych ( three panels with Christ and 12 saints carved out of wood ) and a three-tiered cross believed to have been made_for a 15th-Century Pope that remains in Yeakel ' s personal collection . &quot; Most art from before the 17th Century is religious . Back then churches had the money to hire the great artists , &quot; Yeakel says . The Great Exchange Consignment Co . in Laguna Beach routinely sells religious items , most of which were purchased from churches by wealthy patrons and sold_off with their estates . There ' s a small collection of icons , hand-painted on wood and often adorned with brass or silver overlays , that date_back to the 1700s . &quot; They say the home is blessed with an icon hanging_in it . that ' s why people buy them , &quot; says Tom Campbell , co-owner of the Great Exchange . Religious artifacts come from churches all_over the world , from Mexico to Russia . Synagogues and Buddhist temples are other sources of artifacts . At the Great Exchange , Campbell usually has Buddhas of all kinds as well as temple carvings -- elaborate , colorful carvings that once hung over doorways to temples . He mounted one temple carving in his back yard on a gazebo that overlooks an Oriental garden . Yeakel has many items that once belonged in synagogues , such_as Hanukkah lamps and menorahs . Interest in religious objects crosses all denominations . One doesn ' t have to belong_to the religion to appreciate a beautiful furnishing from a church or temple , Sinner says . For her , the spiritual meaning of the pieces she collects outweighs their trendy , monetary appeal . &quot; God ' s close to me . This is like living with part of him in my home , &quot; she says .</TEXT>
