   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN ALBUM : FOR NAPLES ( FLORIDA ) , ' TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY ; THE BOOMING GULF OF MEXICO RESORT TOWN PUTS_ON ITS HAPPY FACE AS AMERICA ' S TOP CEOS FLEE THE WINTER COLD AND GO SOUTH TO PLAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Along Gulf Shore Boulevard , the shutters are coming_down from the windows of waterfront mansions . Private jets line the tarmac at Naples Airport , wing to wing . And last month soprano June Anderson kicked_off the Philharmonic Center ' s winter season with selections from Puccini and Bizet . &quot; It was marvelous , &quot; said local arts maven Myra Janco Daniels , president of the Naples Philharmonic . &quot; We do have a wonderful world here. &quot; For the fortunate few who can afford to live_in this elegant city nestled along Florida ' s southwest coast , these are the days . As the daytime temperature drops into the comfort zone and the moneyed snowbirds return from the North to open their winter residences , about the only concern of some here is whether Naples really did lose the unofficial title of America ' s golf_course capital . The National Golf Foundation recently reported that with the addition of a_couple_of new courses , Myrtle Beach , S.C. , now counted only 147 people per golf hole -- compared to Naples ' 194 . But no one here is panicking . There are 48 golf_courses now ready for play , and more are being built . &quot; By a lot of people ' s definition , this is the best place in Florida -- safe , clean and well-mannered , &quot; says John Ayres , a hotelier who heads the Naples Visitors Bureau . &quot; Weather , golf , shopping , the arts -- we ' ve sort of got_it all , in a very first-class little package. &quot; A stroll through the downtown area provides an insight into what Naples is about . Art_galleries , pricey boutiques , banks and stock brokerages predominate . There are no pawn shops or discount outlets . Behind the well-manicured , tightly zoned facade are some impressive numbers . According to Kiplinger ' s Florida Business_Letter , only two cities in the United States have a higher percentage of households with incomes over $ 200 # 000 . The city ranks first in Florida in the cost of housing , with the average home selling for almost $ 300 # 000 . With no budget motels , Naples also has the highest average hotel_room rate in Florida , about $ 200-a-night in season . And as everyone here knows , more active and retired CEOs of Fortune 500 companies have winter homes_in Naples than in any other resort city in America . &quot; These are people who come from big product companies -- General Motors , Ford , General Electric , Pillsbury , &quot; says Daniels , who relies_on these residents to help underwrite the Philharmonic Center ' s annual $ 11.6-million budget . &quot; I think maybe only Aspen gives us a run. &quot; Thirty-five years ago , Naples was home to no more_than 15 # 000 people , an out-of-the-way resort noted for a turn-of-the-century fishing pier that reached 1 # 000 feet into the Gulf_of_Mexico . The pier is still there . But Naples has boomed under the crush of wealthy industrialists and corporate_executives , especially those from the Midwest hunting for a balmy winter climate . The year-round population of Naples is only 20 # 000 , swelling to almost double that in the winter months . But surrounding Collier County has boomed , from 80 # 000 residents in 1980 to more_than double that today . While growth in the Naples area has slowed , from 7 % a year in the 1980s to 4.5 % last year , the boom has caused management problems , with particular concern about water quality and preservation of the fragile Everglades ecosystem that extends over most of the county . &quot; that ' s the main issue : How do we keep our quality_of_life as we grow ? How do we keep Naples ' charm and cleanliness ? &quot; asks Bill Neron of the county ' s Economic Development Council . The answers , Neron suggests , are tough zoning laws and a citizenry protective of the good life they enjoy . &quot; Private citizens donate money for public landscaping , &quot; he says , &quot; so the ambience of Naples is such_that when you drive through the community , you say , ' Wow ! The whole area is beautiful. ' &quot; Of course , most of the thousands of service_industry workers here cannot afford to live_in town and must commute from other areas in Collier County . &quot; With the growth of hotels and tourism , we have created a lot of service-related job , &quot; Neron says . &quot; And we ' re trying to diversify by attracting some clean , high-tech industry . But it ' s tough to compete with Ft . Myers &quot; and other cities to the north . Tourism has always been the major industry in the Naples area , and the outlook for this year is for &quot; the best season we ' ve ever had , &quot; Ayres says . In the summer , when temperatures climb back into the 90s and nary a breeze ripples the Gulf_of_Mexico , the population of Naples drops_by about 35 % , nearly 15 % of the local businesses close and the hotel rates plummet into the range of merely expensive . It is_quiet in Naples in the summer , and that ' s just how Paul Thomas likes it . &quot; The main thing is , I feel secure here , &quot; says Thomas , who comes_home on the weekends from a tourist directory business he owns in Hollywood , Fla . &quot; A year ago in Miami Beach , I was held_up at gunpoint , robbed of my credit_cards and watch , hit on the head and thrown_in Biscayne Bay . &quot; If you want excitement , Miami Beach is the place . But if you want to retire , or peace_of_mind -- Naples. &quot;</TEXT>
