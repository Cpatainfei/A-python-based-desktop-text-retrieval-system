   <HEADLINE> ANALYSIS ; OLYMPIC TRACK NOT RIGHT ON SCHEDULE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the 1996 Summer Olympics still nearly two years away , it is curious that the schedules for competition in all sports but the flagship event , track_and_field , have been approved . &quot; Somebody had to be last , I guess , &quot; said Amadeo Francis of Puerto Rico , a member of track ' s international federation committee in_charge of scheduling . If only it were that simple . Although International Amateur Athletic Federation and Olympic organizers say the process takes time , it might also turn_out that it takes money . In the behind-the-scenes deal-making that often dictates Olympic movements , it appears that IAAF President Primo Nebiolo of Italy is using the Atlanta Games ' track schedule as a pawn to bring_in more money for his group and to boost the lagging popularity of his sport in the United States . Although the IAAF Council must approve the track schedule , Nebiolo has the final say . By delaying approval of the schedule until he gets a satisfactory deal , Nebiolo hopes to get more money for IAAF coffers , more television coverage and promotion from NBC and , presumably , rejuvenation of U.S. track interest . According to Sports Intern , a German publication , Nebiolo wants the Atlanta Committee of the Olympic Games ( ACOG ) to pay more for a proposed expanded schedule . ACOG is considering holding track_and_field events over nine or 10 days , an increase from the eight-day program used in previous Olympics . The publication reported that an extra day of track competition would yield at least $ 2.5 million extra in ticket sales . Nebiolo is arguing that NBC , which has the U.S. television rights to the Games , will benefit from the increased track program and , thus , should pay more for coverage of the 1995 World Championships in Sweden and guarantee coverage of the 1997 championships in Mexico_City . He also wants the network to better promote its track telecasts . &quot; It just cannot be that the 1995 World Championships are only worth very little , when one year later the Olympic track_and_field events are a big hit with the same program and same athletes , &quot; one IAAF Council_member told Sport Intern . That Nebiolo would work to renew track interest in the United States indicates the IAAF ' s lack of confidence in USA Track &amp; Field , the sport ' s national governing body . The IAAF has long been concerned about USA track ' s ineffectiveness against the decline of the sport in a nation that produces some of the world ' s best athletes , but barely acknowledges it . Nebiolo sees the Atlanta Games as an opportunity to market the sport here . The fallout could be the downfall of longtime USA track leader Ollan Cassell , who has a cool relationship with Nebiolo . &quot; It ' s sad that the state of track_and_field as a sport has fallen so low in the United States that the IAAF has to target us as a developing nation in terms of trying to build popularity and interest , &quot; said Craig Masback , a former Olympic runner and television commentator . Although not formally positioned to challenge Cassell , USA track ' s executive_director , Masback is being mentioned as a possible replacement if Nebiolo is successful in upsetting the balance_of_power . Such rumblings occur periodically in track , upon which Cassell has held a firm grip for two decades . But if Nebiolo is behind the campaign , a coup might have a chance . &quot; We would like to work with the U.S. federation , &quot; Nebiolo said last August in Paris . &quot; We have offered our assistance many times , but they have never responded. &quot; Cassell said USA track has long welcomed outside assistance . &quot; But it has to be in coordination here with what we ' re doing , &quot; he said from his Indianapolis office . Cassell said USA track has planned some programs for the next two years that will coincide with the Olympics . He is_well aware of IAAF efforts to undermine his leadership . But he said he is not concerned about the recent developments . After all , IAAF involvement in the United States is not unprecedented . When the New York Games were about to fold , IAAF money helped keep them afloat . Still , if Nebiolo ' s manipulations are successful , it would not be the first time . He used the track schedule for the Seoul Olympics to get $ 20 million from Korean organizers , who were afraid that their $ 500-million American television contract would be sabotaged if they did not meet the IAAF president ' s demands , according to the book , &quot; Dishonored Games , &quot; by Vyv Simson and Andrew Jennings . An Atlanta organizer characterized the Seoul situation as tantamount_to blackmail , but declined to comment on whether it was happening again with the ' 96 Olympics . &quot; There are always things going_on ( with ) the people at the top of the Olympic family , &quot; an IAAF official told The Times . If Nebiolo does not get his way with NBC , he might threaten to hold the finals during Europe ' s prime_time . That would put them in the heat of the Georgia afternoon , prime_time for neither the athletes nor the TV-viewing public in the United States . IAAF officials have denied they would request afternoon finals . In the meantime , Francis said his three-member delegation hopes to have a proposal before the IAAF Council when it meets Nov . 29 in Barcelona . ACOG has made 19 revisions of the track schedule since January , and David Maggard , director of competitions , is satisfied with it . Preliminary and a_few final events are scheduled for morning sessions , from 9 a.m. to noon . Most of the finals will be held_in the evening , from 7:30 to 10 p.m. If Nebiolo approves . &quot; Right now , we ' re not just fighting here in the United States for track_and_field , but worldwide , &quot; Cassell said . &quot; It ' s in our best interest to do what is best for us . If we can use ( the schedule ) some way to get NBC to give ( us ) more coverage and it fits within the regulations of the IOC and ACOG , then I see nothing wrong with it. &quot;</TEXT>
