   <HEADLINE> BACKLASH AGAINST ARAFAT SWEEPS OCCUPIED WEST_BANK , GAZA ; MIDEAST : PALESTINIAN ANGER IS DIRECTED AS MUCH AT THE PLO CHAIRMAN AS AT ISRAEL AND THE SETTLER WHO KILLED 48 MUSLIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Carrying Palestinian flags and black banners to mourn the massacre of 48 Palestinians last week in a Hebron mosque , the 400 youths moved_in a phalanx through the main_street here Thursday , chanting , &quot; Arafat , Arafat , where is your peace ? Arafat , Arafat , where is your peace ? &quot; Their anger was directed as much at Yasser Arafat , chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization , as it was at Israel and the Jewish settler who had gunned_down the Muslims as they prayed . &quot; Arafat , Arafat , they are killing us ! &quot; they repeated in rhythmic Arabic . &quot; Arafat , Arafat , they are killing us ! Arafat , Arafat , why are you deceiving us ? Arafat , Arafat , you are killing us ! &quot; An emotional backlash is sweeping the occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip a week after the Hebron massacre , and the Palestinian rage that first focused upon the Israeli occupiers and Jewish settlers is now trained upon Arafat , once the unifying symbol of Palestinian politics . &quot; The mood is ugly after this atrocity , as you would expect , but not really in the ways you would expect , &quot; Mahmoud Abdul Fattah , a local grocer , said as he watched soldiers disperse the noisy demonstration with volleys of tear_gas grenades . &quot; People want to go_out and kill settlers in revenge , or so they say , but they also want to kill Arafat . . . . &quot; Why is Arafat to blame for the massacre ? Sure , he didn ' t pull the trigger -- a Jewish settler did -- but Arafat failed to prevent it . He promised us peace , if we put_down our arms and accepted this agreement . But we are getting more deaths . People have lost faith in Arafat , in the agreement , in the whole peace process . It has all failed. &quot; Even before the massacre , doubts were growing among Palestinians about Arafat ' s deal with Israel on self-government for the Gaza Strip and later for the West_Bank . As the autonomy plans became bogged down in tedious negotiations , the doubts hardened into bitter cynicism and a strong resentment of Arafat , who was seen as giving_in again and again to Israeli demands . &quot; The massacre lets the critics say , ' We told you so , ' and supporters then have to agree -- it is as simple as that , &quot; said Jamal Aboulhawa , a high_school science_teacher . &quot; How can those who supported the agreement as the road to peace argue against this ? How can they believe themselves ? Everyone feels betrayed , first of all by Arafat. &quot; This anger , evident throughout the West_Bank and the Gaza Strip , will make_it even harder for Arafat to reach the compromises necessary to implement the original agreement , local political_leaders say ; the popular demand now is for major Palestinian gains , such_as dismantling some Israeli settlements , as an immediate goal , should negotiations resume . &quot; People are_sick and tired_of us talking peace , &quot; senior PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat commented . &quot; They want something . . . . Any negotiations that don ' t have the future of the Israeli settlements high on the agenda will be senseless. &quot; Dr. Zakaria Agha , the Gaza leader of Fatah , the principal group within the PLO , agreed . &quot; The most important thing is to cut_out these cancerous settlements , &quot; Agha said . &quot; After the massacre in Hebron , this is the No . 1 issue for our people , and no Palestinian negotiator can ignore it . In Gaza , we are losing the street to those opposed to the peace process. &quot; But other Palestinian observers argue that the sheer volatility of the political mood could quickly restore faith in Arafat and support for the autonomy agreement -- if there were significant gains in negotiations with Israel . &quot; If Arafat will get a_few pennies from Israel and then maybe some dollars -- real ones -- from the U.S. and Europe , he can turn everything around overnight , &quot; Jerusalem businessman Nabil Feidy said . &quot; With $ 200 million , Arafat can have a construction program that will put everyone to work in Gaza , and he will be a hero again. &quot; Israeli leaders , taking the shifts into account , appear to have decided that Arafat does indeed need help . But not too_much and not too soon . Under Israeli calculations , the promise of compromises on key issues should bring Arafat back to negotiations in two weeks or so -- after Eid-al-Fitr , the feast that ends the Islamic holy month of Ramadan . The negotiations then , they say , must be wrapped_up quickly , even at the cost of substantial Israeli concessions . &quot; Arafat is a survivor , and we need him to survive this crisis too , &quot; a senior Israeli official said . &quot; But he is in real trouble on the street . How far ( Prime_Minister Yitzhak ) Rabin is willing to go , I don ' t know . But Arafat is the partner in this venture , the only partner Rabin has. &quot; A more immediate worry is Fatah ' s loss of control over street-level politics , for it could lead , local PLO leaders say , to the formation of secret cells intent_on avenging those murdered in Hebron with attacks on Jewish settlers , or , worse , renewing the armed struggle against the Israeli occupation . &quot; Until the massacre , we were able to maintain sufficient political discipline so that , with a_couple_of exceptions , there were no attacks by Fatah on Israelis , &quot; a PLO official here commented . &quot; I cannot guarantee that any longer . On the contrary , I expect such attacks. &quot; The radicalization of Palestinian politics is already evident . When Faisal Husseini , the Fatah leader on the West_Bank , came_to Hebron to offer condolences to bereaved families , he met open hostility . When he tried to calm angry crowds at Jerusalem ' s Al Aqsa Mosque , he was stoned . In Hebron , Fatah and the Islamic Resistance Movement , known as Hamas , ended their rivalry after the massacre ; a similar trend is developing in the Gaza Strip and other parts of the West_Bank as moderates and radicals re-establish the unified leadership structure they used through most of the intifada , the six-year rebellion against the Israeli occupation . Daoud Kuttab , a prominent Palestinian commentator , said the PLO leadership ' s greatest fear is that a radical faction -- perhaps Marxist , more likely Islamic -- will execute a daring military operation that will pull_away Fatah ' s remaining supporters . &quot; This situation demands that the Palestinian leadership realize two aims at_the_same_time , &quot; Kuttab said . &quot; First , to find a way of gathering the Palestinians under its canopy . Second , to find tangible solutions to bring_back the feeling of security and guarantee that such massacres will not be repeated. &quot; That is the point , Kuttab argued , of the three conditions that the PLO set_in Tunis for resumption of the negotiations with Israel : disarming the settlers , removing settlements in Palestinian population centers and stationing international observers on the West_Bank and Gaza Strip .</TEXT>
