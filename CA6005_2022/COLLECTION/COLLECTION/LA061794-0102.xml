   <HEADLINE> SAME-SEX UNIONS PRACTICED EUROPE-WIDE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We found the Los Angeles Times ' note accompanying Garry Trudeau ' s &quot; Doonesbury &quot; last week ( which concerned John Boswell ' s book , &quot; Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe &quot; ) to be highly misleading in implying that the same-sex union ceremony uncovered by Professor Boswell was primarily a phenomenon of the Eastern Orthodox Church . In the early Christian_era , there was no clear division between the Eastern and Roman branches of the Christian_Church . Professor Boswell shows that the same-sex ceremony was practiced throughout Europe and , in fact , he found the largest_number of early manuscript copies in Italy -- with no less than eight copies in the Vatican itself .
