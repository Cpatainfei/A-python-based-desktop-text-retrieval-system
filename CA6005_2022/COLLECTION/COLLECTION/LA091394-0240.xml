   <HEADLINE> SEPARATIST PARTY HEADED FOR VICTORY IN QUEBEC ELECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Parti Quebecois , dedicated to winning Quebec ' s independence from Canada , was headed for victory in the provincial election Monday , promising to bring a year of political turmoil to the United States ' northern neighbor . Based on early returns , two television networks projected a parliamentary majority for the PQ , led by Jacques Parizeau , 64 , who has promised to hold a referendum on Quebec independence within 10 months of taking_office . Parizeau ' s party would oust from office the ruling Liberal_Party , led by Premier Daniel Johnson , 49 . Parizeau has indicated that he would immediately set the wheels in motion for a referendum if he became premier . Among the plans he announced during the campaign were adoption by Quebec ' s National Assembly of a &quot; declaration of intent &quot; to assume independence ; appointment of a commission to draw_up a constitution for the proposed new nation , and aggressive policies aimed at taking_control of programs usually directed by the Canadian national government . Separatists believe a Parti Quebecois victory would give them their best chance at independence , even though polls show that most Quebeckers now oppose separation from Canada . Their strategists contend they can reverse that trend with a vigorous Quebec government teamed with their separatist partners in the federal Parliament , the Bloc Quebecois , which holds 53 seats and is led by the charismatic Lucien Bouchard . A surprise victory by the Liberals would have been a death blow to the separatist cause . Network projections showed the Liberals doing somewhat better than polls had indicated , but not well enough to win . Canadian Prime_Minister Jean Chretien , a Quebecker who strongly supports national unity , stayed out of the provincial election but is expected to play a stronger role in the referendum campaign . Because Canada is the United States ' largest trading partner and a key defense ally , the United States has a major stake in the outcome of the separatist struggle . The traditional U.S. position has been to say Canada is a valued neighbor but that the issue of national unity is one for Canadians to decide . So far , the Clinton_Administration has continued to adhere to that line . While the Quebec campaign commanded Canadian and international attention because of the separatism issue , within the province the dominant issues were the economy , which only recently has begun to emerge from a long recession , and voters ' exhaustion with the Liberal government , polls show . Indeed , sentiment for Quebec independence dropped steadily in the polls throughout the campaign , even as support for the PQ held steady or increased . The latest surveys showed Quebeckers opposed to secession from Canada by about 60 % to 40 % , the same margin by which a 1980 sovereignty referendum was defeated . Johnson became premier in January , succeeding Robert Bourassa , who retired because of poor health . He inherited a government that was seen by many voters as uncaring about Quebec ' s jobless and unwilling to do much to correct chronic , double-digit unemployment . During the 50-day campaign , and in the months leading_up to it , Johnson sought to reverse that by putting_forward a new economic program and simultaneously warning that the Parti Quebecois ' focus_on sovereignty would distract a Parizeau government from job creation . In response , Parizeau argued that Quebec independence would be decided in the promised 1995 referendum and that this election was about good government . Parizeau also contended that independence is necessary for Quebec to achieve its economic potential , saying a PQ government would need all_the tools of a sovereign nation to reach full_employment . Chretien ' s absence from the campaign was criticized in some quarters . But federal election officials often stay out of provincial politics and Chretien is sensitive to complaints in the rest of Canada that the federal_government pays too_much attention to Quebec . In any case , Chretien is far more popular outside of Quebec than within the province , and an appearance on behalf of Johnson might have backfired . Chretien was justice minister in the early 1980s and was instrumental in helping Prime_Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau enact a new Canadian constitution over the lone opposition of the Quebec government . Many Quebeckers never have forgiven Chretien . Background on Quebec The Quebec provincial election has launched a new debate over independence from Canada . Here are some key facts about Quebec : * Size : Canada ' s largest province in area at 594 # 440 square_miles , roughly the size of Alaska . * Population : Second-largest in population after Ontario , with 6.9 million people , or about a quarter of Canada ' s total .
