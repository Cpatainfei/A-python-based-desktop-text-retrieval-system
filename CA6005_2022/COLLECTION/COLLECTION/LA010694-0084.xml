   <HEADLINE> PROSECUTORS WILL SEEK DEATH_PENALTY AGAINST 19-YEAR-OLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County prosecutors announced Wednesday that they will seek the death_penalty against Mark Scott Thornton , the Thousand Oaks teen-ager charged in the September slaying of Westlake nurse Kellie O ' Sullivan . Dist . Atty . Michael D . Bradbury decided to push for the death_penalty after reviewing the case with key staffers Tuesday morning , officials said . Deputy Dist . Atty . Peter D . Kossoris , who will try the case , said the decision was not influenced by Bradbury ' s announcement Tuesday that he will seek a fifth term in office . Decisions on capital_punishment cases usually come_after a defendant is charged but before arraignment , Kossoris said . A grand_jury charged the 19-year-old Thornton with the murder in a 14-count indictment returned last month . His arraignment is scheduled for Monday . &quot; Our universal procedure is that we have a meeting on cases where the death_penalty is a possibility , &quot; Kossoris said . &quot; We discuss the case and everybody states their opinion , and Mike makes the ultimate decision. &quot; Bradbury was out of the office Wednesday and could not be reached for comment on his decision . Kossoris declined to explain the factors considered in deciding to seek the death_penalty against Thornton . The public_defender ' s office immediately issued a news release criticizing the decision . &quot; We feel strongly that , should there be a conviction in this case , the appropriate sentence for this troubled teen-ager would be life imprisonment without the possibility of parole , &quot; the statement said . Defense_attorneys also said in the terse , one-paragraph statement that they were surprised by Bradbury ' s decision to go_for the death_penalty . Deputy Public_Defender Howard Asher , co-counsel for Thornton , declined to elaborate . Police say Thornton kidnaped and fatally shot O ' Sullivan , the mother of a young son , on Sept . 14 . Her body was found amid brush in the Santa Monica Mountains 12 days later . Thornton was arrested in Reno , Nev. , on Sept . 19 . He was in possession of her car . Thornton has admitted to police that he stole O ' Sullivan ' s car and used it to abduct his ex-girlfriend , whom he then drove to Reno . But the defendant has denied killing O ' Sullivan . Kevin White , O ' Sullivan ' s boyfriend and coordinator of the 12-day civilian search for her body , said he was pleased by the decision to seek the death_penalty . &quot; I just hope that things go smoothly and happen as they should , &quot; he said . &quot; It just seems that these cases take so long. &quot; Kossoris said he expects the Thornton trial to start no sooner than summer because attorneys will need several months to prepare their cases . Thornton would be the second man to face the death_penalty in Ventura County in 1994 . Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Christopher James Sattiewhite , a 21-year-old convicted felon from Oxnard who is accused of shooting an Oxnard woman at point-blank range two years ago . The announcement to seek the death_penalty against Thornton comes as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to hear a major challenge to California ' s death-penalty law . The high_court has agreed to rule whether jurors in the state are given enough guidance in choosing between a death sentence and life imprisonment . Ventura attorney Wendy Lascher , who will argue the Supreme Court appeal of a Shasta County man who killed a teacher , said local authorities should narrow the grounds on which they seek the death_penalty while the high_court makes_up its mind . &quot; Prosecutors should not argue to the jury , for example , that the death_penalty is warranted because of ' the circumstances of the crime , ' &quot; said Lascher , who said that phrase is overly vague . She also said there should be a clear standard for how Bradbury and other district_attorneys decide to seek the death_penalty . &quot; We just should not have prosecutors making_it up as they are going_along , &quot; she said . But Ventura County prosecutors said they have been instructed by the state_attorney general ' s office to continue their current procedures for deciding whether to seek the death_penalty in murder cases .</TEXT>
