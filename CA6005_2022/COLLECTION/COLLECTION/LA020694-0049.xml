   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS : A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : SILLY_SEASON ; OSCAR LONG_SHOTS THAT ARE SPELLED ' LOOOOOONG SHOTS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They typically open : &quot; For Your Consideration. &quot; But the response to these ads for Oscar nominees isn ' t always the desired one . Consider Walt Disney Pictures ' latest in the Hollywood entertainment trade papers : &quot; Leon . Best Actor . ' Cool Runnings. ' &quot; Remember Leon ? Remember &quot; Cool Runnings &quot; ? Now , Leon is up against such potential best actor nominees as Harrison Ford ( &quot; The Fugitive &quot; ) , Anthony Hopkins ( &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; ) or Daniel Day-Lewis ( &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; ) , to name a_few . This is no slam against the bobsled movie or Leon , who ' s driving it . It ' s merely an example of what some studio executives refer to as Hollywood ' s &quot; political waste. &quot; And it comes bubbling_up this time every year . It doesn ' t matter whether the picture is a hit at the box_office or with the critics . What matters is that actors ' and actresses ' egos are massaged and studios ' relationships with them are greased so that they will star in future films . that ' s critical since most studios are constantly vying for a select group of talent . Besides , if they don ' t take_out the ads for notable actors , they ' ll be dogged by the stars ' agents . So the long-shot ( or what some in the business snidely refer to as &quot; suicide &quot; ) ads become a costly necessity at Oscar time . Advertisers say they pay $ 5 # 869 for a one-page ad in four colors_in the Hollywood Reporter for one day . A two-page ad costs $ 11 # 300 . Studios and independent filmmakers plunk_down those bucks throughout the Academy Awards season , which runs from January to the big night , March 21 . Consider the greenbacks doled_out for Bill Murray as best actor for &quot; Groundhog_Day &quot; or Sylvester Stallone for &quot; Demolition Man &quot; ? Or Stallone in &quot; Cliffhanger &quot; ? ( &quot; You might as well light a candle and pray to St . Jude , &quot; quipped one Columbia source and academy voter. ) Or the money spent on just about every category for TriStar ' s &quot; Rudy &quot; ; director , actor and screenplay for Hollywood Pictures ' &quot; Bound by Honor &quot; ; best picture -- and all_the other categories -- for both Columbia ' s &quot; Malice &quot; and 20th Century Fox ' s &quot; Rookie of the Year. &quot; &quot; Maybe these people think they can fool the public , but the people in the industry ? They ' re the ones who vote on the nominations , for Pete ' s sake ! &quot; says a Universal Pictures production executive . Fine Line Features ' &quot; Short Cuts , &quot; which has seen a media blitz of advertising , is considered a long_shot -- but Fine Line ' s campaign , sources say , is also designed to try to raise its visibility in the film community to attract more directors like Robert Altman . On the other hand , many voting members said they found Touchstone ' s Oscar nominee ads for Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne in &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do With It &quot; -- who are considered genuine contenders -- underwhelming . When studios or independent producers have dropped the ball on long-shot ad_campaigns , talent has been known to tout themselves , such_as Diane Ladd for a nomination in 1991 ' s &quot; Rambling Rose. &quot; And then there are the foreign-language films . &quot; Many of these pictures are only shown for very brief periods_of_time in Los Angeles and New York and the academy members miss them . The trade ads induce them to go , &quot; says entertainment attorney David Colden , of Weissmann , Wolff , Bergman , Coleman &amp; Silverman . &quot; While many of these pictures are strong on their merit , there are some smaller companies with obscure pictures who think if they spend enough money and take_out enough ads , they can buy a vote . Now that ' s naivete. &quot; But for the big boys , it ' s an exercise in showmanship . &quot; But you know what ' s so ridiculous ? &quot; said one Paramount producer and academy member . &quot; People are running all_of these ads , when you know ' Schindler ' s List ' is going_to win best picture and director . The one that gets me is the ad for ( Columbia ' s ) ' Geronimo ' for best picture . Give it up. &quot;</TEXT>
