   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CLINTON ' S AGILITY MAKES_UP FOR INEXPERIENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The opening session of President Clinton ' s first full-scale meeting of the Western Alliance was just getting under way , and the young American leader was trying a bit of banter with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . &quot; I was thinking_of you last night , Helmut , &quot; said Clinton , who has little experience on the crags of world summitry . He began to describe a Brussels television broadcast he had seen about sumo wrestling , the pastime of 350-pound Japanese men . Kohl , 290 pounds and conscious of his weight , looked_up quickly , but Clinton danced back from the edge of the diplomatic cliff by turning a seeming blunder into a graceful compliment . &quot; You and I are the biggest people here , and we are still 100 pounds too light &quot; for the practice of sumo , Clinton clarified . Kohl laughed heartily , and the NATO alliance breathed a collective sigh of relief . Throughout the opening rounds of the summit , Clinton has repeatedly displayed that ability to overcome inexperience with agility . In the process , he has done more_than avoid embarrassment and repair his previously frayed relations with Europe . He has summoned forth a surprisingly unified and hopeful attitude among members of the sometimes fractious alliance as they pass_through a historic transition : With the Cold_War over and other concerns surging to the fore , this has turned_out to be the summit at which Europe for the first time emerged as a full and equal partner instead of the valued but subordinate gaggle of allies it had been for more_than four decades . The transition was laden with risks . Europeans were uncertain about Clinton ' s ability and commitment , fearful that the end of the Cold_War meant an end to American involvement on the Continent . At the same time , they well remembered the stubborn reluctance of past U.S. Presidents to share their pride of place at the head of the table . Yet Clinton , in no small part through strength of personality and a knack for not rubbing his partners the wrong way , has led the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization through the process of adopting new policies that recognize Europe ' s new place in the alliance -- even its right to take the lead -- without friction or fractiousness . And this at sessions that some predicted would be marred by open discord among NATO ' s 16 members over policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina , the entry of new members from Eastern Europe and other issues . Of course , Clinton has been eager to accommodate the Europeans because of a convergence of interests . Americans , preoccupied with domestic problems and yearning to shift defense costs , want the Old_World to shoulder more of the work of collective_security . Still , others might not have eased into the Americans ' new role with as much grace as Clinton has shown , the European leaders said Monday . At times , Clinton ' s open , uncomplicated , upbeat style seemed almost visibly to pull_together the 16 leaders in a way that has been distinctly lacking in an alliance prone to transatlantic strain in the past . If there were lingering doubts before the summit about Clinton ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; initiative offering eventual NATO membership to East European_countries , the President appeared to clear them up in his comments to the opening session Monday morning . &quot; I haven ' t heard a single critical word this morning , &quot; said a senior German official , himself surprised by the amity of the affair . Clinton gave America ' s blessing to independent European defense planning -- an idea called the European Security and Defense Identity that will permit European NATO members to plan and take military_action independently of the United States if they wish . The warmth he displayed in welcoming the initiative seemed to surprise several veteran European defense specialists who recalled the deep suspicion with which the United States once viewed such ideas . Efforts by some of America ' s NATO allies to revive the long-dormant Western European Union ( WEU ) defense group during the mid-1980s were actively discouraged by the Ronald Reagan_Administration and , later , accepted only reluctantly by former President George_Bush . In Brussels on Monday , Clinton welcomed a strong WEU and even proposed offering NATO equipment and logistics support to independent European operations if they should be required . &quot; It ' s a change in policy and a change in spirit that can only be welcomed , &quot; a German official said . Noting these developments , along with Clinton ' s reaffirmation of a pledge to keep 100 # 000 U.S. troops in Europe for the foreseeable future , British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd bubbled to reporters , &quot; NATO is clearly alive and well and taking_up a new lease on life. &quot; In part , Clinton has been lucky that the timing of his initiatives seems to fit well with the interests of America ' s European partners . But his team also seems to have sold his policies well and his infectious optimism has worked to enhance this success . In deferring to the seniority of elder_statesmen such_as French President Francois Mitterrand and Kohl , Clinton also appears to have avoided the friction experienced by some American leaders who had to overcome initial rejection by more experienced European leaders quick to sense a &quot; we know better &quot; attitude in Washington . Mitterrand ' s spokesman , Jean Musitelli , for example , noted that during a bilateral meeting Monday , Clinton personally thanked the_French president for his cooperation during the final phases of the difficult world trade talks -- a gesture that came despite the fact that the final days of those negotiations were characterized by bitter French resistance to several U.S. initiatives . Clinton ' s abilities could face a more severe challenge this week in Moscow , though that is not considered likely . But so far , by most accounts , this President has masterfully used his abilities as a quick_study , his personal charm -- and the low expectations that must accompany a President who fiercely proclaims his domestic agenda as his first priority . &quot; To the extent summitry is brokerage and personal_relationships , he can do_well , &quot; said Michael Beschloss , a diplomatic historian . This week , as he heads into back-to-back meetings with some of his European counterparts , Clinton enjoys a relatively strong domestic position compared to the other leaders . Although in Washington questions nag about Clinton ' s investments in an Arkansas land deal , the U.S. economy is stronger and Clinton ' s personal popularity is higher than that of Kohl , Mitterrand or British Prime_Minister John Major . Above all , it is Clinton ' s youth and his image of openness that most seem to have captivated the European public . A Brussels taxi driver , John Callewaert , realizing he had landed an American passenger , announced that his 13-year-old son had shaken Clinton ' s hand Sunday evening in the city ' s majestic Grand ' Place and now wanted to write the President a letter . &quot; Clinton goes_to the people , he has a young family , he knows my problems , &quot; Callewaert said . He pulled a piece_of_paper off the dashboard of his car , asking : &quot; Is this right ? Is this right ? &quot; Carefully printed on the paper was an address : 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. , Washington , D.C. , U.S.A .</TEXT>
