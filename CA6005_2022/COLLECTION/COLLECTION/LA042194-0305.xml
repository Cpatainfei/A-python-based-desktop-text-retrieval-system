   <HEADLINE> DEREGULATING ELECTRIC_POWER ; POWERFUL QUESTIONS ; CONCERNS RAISED FOR SUPPLIERS OF ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF ENERGY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dramatic overhaul proposed Wednesday for California ' s electric_power system sparked concern that providers of renewable energy will be priced out of the newly deregulated marketplace . For the past decade , California has taken major steps toward ensuring that the state ' s three big investor-owned utilities buy a certain portion of their power from alternative sources , including power derived from the sun , wind , water and subterranean steam . But some environmentalists said the plan laid_out by the California Public_Utilities Commission -- in which businesses and consumers would be able to choose their own power sources within eight years -- would create a market dominated by whatever firms can make electricity most cheaply . That would hurt renewable energy firms , which are smaller than the major utilities and often can ' t sell their power at as low a price , critics said . &quot; This is unleveling the playing_field between renewable systems and conventional systems , &quot; said David Goldstein , co-director of energy programs for the Natural_Resources Defense Council . But PUC Commissioner P . Gregory Conlon noted that under the new proposals , Californians would be able to choose renewable energy as their source for electricity . He predicted that many would , even if it cost more . &quot; I think people in California would be receptive to that , &quot; Conlon said . He also said some renewable energy firms , notably those providing wind-based power , are increasingly able to sell electricity as cheaply as the big utilities , which rely_on oil and gas to generate power . &quot; These alternative-energy providers need to be cost-competitive , and some of them feel they already are , &quot; Conlon said . Whatever the PUC does , Goldstein said , it would be unfair for consumers to pay more just because they chose to buy renewable power . &quot; Why should people with a conscience pay more for electricity than those that don ' t have one ? &quot; he asked . &quot; The whole concept of environmental regulation is that these are shared costs , because they benefit everybody &quot; by creating less pollution . Conlon said he is seeking comments on an option that was not part of the formal PUC proposal : placing a surcharge on all Californians ' electric_bills that would subsidize renewable energy firms and keep them in business . Such a step would require legislation , he said . Oil was once the dominant source for California ' s electric_power , but that changed after the Middle_East oil shocks of the 1970s . State officials responded with a unique policy that ultimately required utilities to buy a certain portion of their power from alternative sources . Southern California Edison Co. , for instance , today buys 16 % of the electricity it sells from outside renewable power firms ; it generates an additional 6 % from its own renewable efforts , namely hydroelectricity . Vikram Budhraja , an Edison vice_president for planning and technology , said many of Edison ' s contracts with renewable power suppliers extend past the year 2010 . &quot; We expect them to continue , &quot; he said , regardless of the PUC ' s new proposals . But Budhraja reiterated earlier Edison statements that the utility currently has no need to buy additional power from the outside . If Californians get_to start choosing their own sources of electricity , he added , &quot; our portfolio ( of alternative_energy purchases ) would get_wound down. &quot; Tom Graff , a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund , said more competition in the utility business , &quot; in the long_run , is likely to be positive for both the economy and the environment. &quot; But he too said alternative_energy firms &quot; could be at risk in a deregulated &quot; market if consumers opt only for the lowest price . &quot; It ' s one thing to go_to a local grocer and buy a head of lettuce that ' s free_of pesticides , &quot; Graff said . &quot; But electricity is kind of a generic product . You ' re not getting a better type of electricity from your renewable resource , even though you may feel better about how it ' s generated. &quot; * MAIN STORY : A1</TEXT>
