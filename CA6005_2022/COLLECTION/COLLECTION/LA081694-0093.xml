   <HEADLINE> MAILING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DATA ON SBA LOAN PROCESS ; DISASTER AID : DESPITE DEADLINE EXTENSION , AGENCY DENIES THE ACTION WAS PROMPTED BY A SURVEY INDICATING CONFUSION OVER APPLICATION PROCEDURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the heels of a survey that showed many quake victims did not understand Small Business Administration loan procedures , the federal agency announced Monday it will send_out 313 # 000 letters offering additional data . The letters , which will be sent to earthquake victims in Ventura and Los Angeles counties by the end of this month , will also include toll-free telephone information numbers and notice of the recent deadline extension to Oct . 17 . SBA officials denied there was a connection between the announcement and the results of the agency ' s own survey that showed 17 % of all those who did not return applications said they misunderstood the loan procedures and needed more information . That percentage represents 51 # 000 people . The officials also denied the new program was prompted by criticism from city officials and newspaper editorials that pointed_out that only 42 % of all SBA loan_applications have been returned . &quot; We are happy with this return rate , &quot; said SBA spokeswoman Rebecca McKenzie . &quot; We are constantly looking_at ways to make this better . To say they are pressuring us is not accurate. &quot; Hank Carrillo , director of the Fillmore Chamber_of_Commerce , said he hopes the letter will help residents in the city , where 50 downtown buildings had to be demolished in the earthquake ' s aftermath . Carrillo said he frequently talks to quake victims -- including many Spanish speakers -- who are bewildered by the SBA loan process . &quot; I think it ' s a great idea to send_out this letter , &quot; Carrillo said . &quot; But I hope they are going_to send it out_in Spanish as well as English. &quot; Carrillo himself applied for a SBA loan to help with $ 25 # 000 worth of quake damage to his mobile_home , which was thrown_off its foundation . The SBA approved his loan , but instead of the 3.5 % interest_rate he and his wife thought they would be getting , SBA offered them 7.5 % rate_of_interest , based on their income level . &quot; I ' m sure it was_on the paper somewhere and we were told about it , &quot; Carrillo said . &quot; But let ' s face it , for two months people were in shock and if they told me stuff , it went right over my head. &quot; * Instead , Carrillo and his wife took_out a $ 5 # 000 bank loan with a 5 % interest_rate , and made_up the difference with a small FEMA grant , insurance payments and money from their own pockets . Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard , who represents Simi Valley , Moorpark and other areas hard hit by the quake , said she understands how some people are confused by the forms . &quot; I ' ve read over those loan documents , and there are some things that are very difficult for people to understand , &quot; Howard said . &quot; Ironically , we just scheduled a meeting with SBA in September to answer some of the questions that residents still have. &quot; And last week , the Simi Valley City_Council approved use of $ 50 # 000 in relief funds to hire an earthquake assistance coordinator whose duties will include helping residents sort through federal earthquake assistance applications . As of Aug . 10 , nearly 506 # 000 disaster applications had been issued by the SBA , but only about 213 # 000 have been returned , leaving nearly 300 # 000 applications outstanding , according to SBA officials . But SBA officials defended the return rate , saying it is comparable_to the response they had after disasters such_as Hurricane Hugo , the Loma Prieta quake and the Los Angeles riots . The SBA survey , conducted by telephone Aug . 5 through 8 , found that the 17 % who did not return applications were mainly laboring under three misconceptions : they didn ' t know the SBA would lend money to cover the earthquake insurance deductibles , they didn ' t know the original deadline had been extended and they simply didn ' t think they qualified for a loan . Of the others who did not return applications : * 26 % said they did not want additional debt or did not need a loan . * 25 % said they were not interested and only had minor damage . * 20 % said they had money of_their_own or had other funding , such_as insurance money , to pay_for repairs . * 6 % said they had sufficient assistance from FEMA ' s temporary housing program . * 6 % said they could not meet the applications filing requirements , such_as providing evidence of a positive cash flow or copies of tax_returns . Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman Russ Edmonston urged quake victims to take_advantage of the extension and apply for an SBA loan , even if they do not want or need it , because victims cannot qualify for a state grant until they have been rejected by the SBA .
