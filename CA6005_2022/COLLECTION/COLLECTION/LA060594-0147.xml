   <HEADLINE> NUCLEAR BRINKSMANSHIP REDEFINED ; NORTH_KOREA : ITS DEFIANCE OF INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY MERITS SANCTIONS , BUT CHINA AND JAPAN HAVE TO BE_ON THE TEAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> North_Korea has forced the world ' s hand . Hans Blix , the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , informed the United Nations on Thursday that he could no longer determine whether or not North_Korea had diverted material from its reactor to nuclear_weapons . The day before , Blix had offered the Koreans a final line of retreat , but they refused . The only reasonable inference is that North_Korea has built , and plans to keep , nuclear_weapons in defiance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The director-general has waited patiently , acting carefully . In February , 1992 , the IAEA had good reason to suspect that the Koreans had nuclear ambitions . The IAEA found evidence that the Koreans had extracted weapons-usable plutonium from their reactor during a 100-day shutdown in 1989 . The North_Koreans &quot; confessed , &quot; but said that they had separated only about 3 1 / 2 ounces of the explosive metal . Using sensitive analyses , the IAEA knew that it was more likely that many pounds had been diverted . The apparent discrepancy could have been resolved by measurements of two waste storage sites in the Yongbyon nuclear complex , but North_Korea refused . Blix ' s only remaining choice was to wait until North_Korea discharged spent fuel from its reactor , and then to demand examination of 300 carefully selected fuel rods . In these the IAEA would find written the radioactive history of the 1989 shutdown and clues to the Korean arsenal . The North_Koreans , however , have deliberately extracted these fuel rods without observers present , and have probably scrambled the order of the rods so that , as Blix wrote the U.N. secretary_general , &quot; future measurements would be meaningless . . . and would not permit the agency to ascertain whether nuclear material from the reactor had been diverted. &quot; The IAEA has acted correctly . It did not declare safeguards irrevocably lost until North_Korea acted to destroy the isotopic record . The U.S._government has also acted impeccably . To no avail , the Clinton_Administration made clear to North_Korea that we would respond to nuclear honesty by facilitating an end to the North ' s isolation . The time for other measures has arrived , starting with President Clinton ' s call_for economic sanctions . Kim Il-sung , North_Korea ' s dictator , has said that sanctions are an act of war , and he threatens a second , and nuclear , Korean conflict , which would annihilate North_Korea and destroy some of the South . One may reasonably doubt that his response will be so swift and violent . He has played his cards too shrewdly these last months for us to believe that he is quite as irrational as he would like us to assume . Sanctions , while short of war , are designed to compel North_Korea to do something that it otherwise would not . A list of demanded acts must precede a resolution imposing sanctions . Inspection of the reactor ' s fuel is useless ; examination of the waste dumps will do nothing about existing weapons . Sanctions should be aimed at forcing the North to take three steps : The nuclear_weapons they have must be dismantled and the fissile fuel handed_over to the IAEA ; the full records of the North_Korean nuclear programs , peaceful and military , including supplier lists and personnel files , must be made available to the United Nations and the IAEA ; and all plutonium and refined uranium in the country must be removed from North_Korea , just as it was from Iraq . China and Japan are the keys . If they support sanctions , sanctions can succeed ; if they do not , necessary American efforts could lead directly to war . The Clinton_Administration and the IAEA have set a correct course ; it is up_to the rest of the world to follow .</TEXT>
