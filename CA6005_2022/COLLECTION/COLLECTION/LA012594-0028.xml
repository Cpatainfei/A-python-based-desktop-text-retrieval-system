   <HEADLINE> WERE ONE-THIRD OF QUAKE VICTIMS SCARED TO DEATH ? ; HEALTH : A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF EARTHQUAKE-RELATED CARDIAC DEATHS DOES NOT SURPRISE MEDICAL EXPERTS WHO HAVE NEW RESPECT FOR THE POWER OF HUMAN EMOTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the Northridge quake struck , the woman was terrified . In less than a minute , the shaking stopped and her Granada Hills house remained intact . But the danger , for the 73-year-old , had not passed . Her chest began to ache . She gasped for air . She knew she was in_trouble and dialed 911 . But 911 wasn ' t there . The telephone_lines were down . Within minutes , the woman died in a manner similar to about 20 other Southern Californians following last week ' s 6.6 earthquake . Of the 51 earthquake-related fatalities , early reports indicate that one-third may be_due to heart_attacks , or what doctors call sudden cardiac deaths . The Los Angeles County Coroner ' s official report is not expected for several weeks . But the high percentage of cardiac deaths apparently related to the quake does not surprise medical experts who , in recent years , say they have developed an awesome respect for the power of emotions . In several of the cases , the victims were clearly reacting to immediate danger . A 52-year-old Cypress woman died while racing through her creaking house to shepherd her children to safety . A 62-year-old Northridge man was found dead in his car of an apparent heart_attack . He managed to free himself from his buckling house and duck into his car . But he couldn ' t escape his fright . Seven other people got_to a hospital before their hearts finally gave_out . Most of the heart-attack victims were 50 and older . But medical_examiners have not ruled_out heart_attack as the cause of death for a 31-year-old Rancho Cucamonga woman who dashed to her baby ' s crib during the quake , stumbled and died , and an 11-year-old Westside girl who had been ill prior to the quake . Fear , panic and terror are among the most gripping of sensations -- feelings strong enough that even young and healthy people often experience their hearts racing and breaths shortening in the midst of a traumatic event . &quot; I know I felt that way , &quot; says Dr. Linda Demer , chief of cardiology at UCLA Medical_Center . This response , she says , is the well-known evolutionary trait called &quot; fight or flight. &quot; It helps us react with some success when face-to-face with the saber-toothed_tiger . &quot; This response involves massive releases of hormones ( called catecholamines ) which stimulate receptors in many places of the body , including the heart , &quot; Demer says . &quot; That is responsible_for the increased heart_rate that most people feel . The heart beats faster and pumps harder . That increases the work load on the heart . The blood_pressure goes_up as well. &quot; The response is designed to trigger an increase in strength in healthy individuals , Demer says . But , &quot; if someone has compromised blood flow to the heart , they may_not be able to meet the demands of the heart muscle. &quot; And , it could be that the Northridge quake was poorly timed in_relation_to how much strain hearts can withstand . Consider this : Monday mornings are , statistically , the highest risk period for having heart_attack . Early mornings are risky because of &quot; normal biological variations , including the blood being more likely to clot in the morning hours , &quot; says Dr. Howard N . Allen , an attending cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center . And Mondays are thought to be risky because the weekend has ended and people face the mental stress of beginning a new work week . * Research has shown that severe anxiety can be the trigger for a heart_attack . Studies following moderate earthquakes in Thessaloniki , Greece ( 1978 ) , and Newcastle , Australia ( 1989 ) , provide &quot; weak evidence that acute emotional and physical stress may trigger ( heart_attack ) and coronary death , &quot; according to the authors of one of the studies . Another study to determine if fear caused heart_attacks was begun at a large Israeli hospital during the days before the Gulf War in January , 1991 . In that analysis , a dramatic jump in the number of heart_attacks was observed on Jan . 17 , 1991 , the day after the start of the war , but before the first missile strikes in the area . Heart-attack rates were higher throughout the war , although the not as high as on that very first day . This suggests that the stress related to fear had a greater impact than the actual missile attacks , the researchers said . Scientists even think they understand the chain of events that links the sensation of fear to a malfunctioning heart . But what they do not understand is why this sensation kills some people with heart_disease and not others . And how can fear kill a person with no detectable heart_disease -- for example , a seemingly robust , healthy person ? In people who already have some heart_disease -- such_as narrowed , clogged arteries -- catecholamines can cause an imbalance between the supply and demand of oxygen , causing a myocardial_infarction , or heart_attack , says Allen , a former president of the American Heart Assn. ' s Greater Los Angeles Affiliate . Catecholamines can also accelerate the blood-clotting process . And , if there is already plaque , or fatty deposits , in the arteries , the clot may close_off the artery and cause a heart_attack . But another type of attack is simply called &quot; sudden death. &quot; And it is more mysterious in that -- in rare cases -- it can kill people who have no detectable heart_disease . In sudden_death , the catecholamines flooding the body trigger an onslaught of electrical impulses that can shift the heart ' s regular pace into a chaotic , rapid , irregular beat , called arrhythmia or tachycardia , says Allen . The heart is not really pumping anymore , but convulsing . Even if an arrhythmia is triggered by anxiety or fear , &quot; it ' s likely you have an underlying ( heart ) problem that would predispose you , &quot; says Dr. Barbara Natterson , a cardiology fellow at UCLA Medical_Center who is also a psychiatrist . But that isn ' t always the case . * Much remains to be learned about how stress affects the heart , experts admit . Some research in the past decade suggests that men with hostile , hard-driving personalities -- the so-called &quot; Type-A personalities &quot; -- are more likely to have heart_disease and subsequent heart_attacks . Conversely , recent studies indicate that women who are poor at expressing their emotions are more likely to have heart_attacks . &quot; People who have heart_attacks tend to be those with the traditional risk factors , such_as diabetes , high cholesterol , smoking , hypertension and family history , &quot; Natterson says . &quot; But the question remains : What ultimately causes that plaque to rupture ? &quot; Along with putting their patients on a treadmill , doctors now commonly test people with possible heart_disease to see how they respond to mental or emotional stress . These tests include measuring the heart_rate while the patient plays a challenging video_game or completes a tough mental task . But medical experts are far from being able to predict who might be more likely to have a heart_attack while under stress . A better question for Southern Californians -- especially those with heart_disease -- might be : Do you get extremely frightened during an earthquake ? &quot; The true meaning of stress is not only the stimulus -- the earthquake -- but how one has learned to respond , &quot; Allen says . &quot; We are aware , in California , that this is an area where earthquakes occur . We talk_about preparedness and what to do , but when it occurs , some people handle it an organized way and some people panic. &quot; Psychologists often advise people to cope_with an anxious situation by having a previously thought-out , well-rehearsed plan on what to do . Los Angeles psychologist Robert Butterworth , who has a long history of counseling trauma victims , says he wonders if some of those who died of heart_attacks lacked a coping strategy . &quot; We can ' t wake those people up and ask them ' Did you have an alternative behavior ? ' Did you rehearse something ? ' &quot; he says . &quot; But if you have an alternative plan , you might think , ' If I do this , I ' ll survive. ' &quot; That is the therapy behind disaster-response drills -- to learn to adapt , to get used to it . So when we are frightened , we are able to overcome it. &quot;</TEXT>
