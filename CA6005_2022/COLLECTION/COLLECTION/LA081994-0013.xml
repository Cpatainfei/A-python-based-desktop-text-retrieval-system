   <HEADLINE> WHAT MEXICO NEEDS IS A SHARED VISION ; POLITICS : GHOSTS OF THE PAST PREY ON VOTERS ' FEARS , BUT THE HYPOTHESES ARE WRONG -- THE ROAD TO DEMOCRACY IS OPEN AND CLEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the eve of the most competitive elections in Mexican history , voices from the past are playing_up voters ' fears , insinuating that their ballots will decide whether the country falls_into chaos or transitions into democracy . That is not just simplistic ; it is plain wrong . Mexico has made tremendous gains toward democracy over the past decade . What the country needs now is to arrive_at a common_ground and define the rules for coexistence after the election , regardless of the outcome . The unexpected competitiveness of this election and the perception that , for the first time , nobody knows which of the three main candidates will win the presidency has actually raised hopes that , finally , Mexico is_on the verge of becoming a full-fledged democracy . Of the three presidential hopefuls , the most demonized is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas . Opponents warn that a victory by the Revolutionary Democratic Party candidate would cause massive capital flight , a severe decrease in foreign investment , a depletion of dollar reserves and devaluation of the peso , all resulting in the ungovernability of Mexico . As for Ernesto Zedillo , candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , the opposition argues that no one believes the party can win without cheating , so a PRI victory would provoke intense , unmanageable civil disturbances and more armed rebellions in other states besides Chiapas . The National Action Party ' s candidate , Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , is handicapped , it is said , by lacking the resources , members and experienced public_servants to govern effectively . Most important , he would lack the backing of the state political apparatus that , intertwined with the PRI , has governed the country for decades and will remain in place regardless of who wins the presidential election this Sunday . All of these hypotheses , founded in fear , are exaggerated and , therefore , inaccurate . The crisis Mexico has faced since the beginning of the year is not the first one in its convulsed history . Nor are the Zapatistas in Chiapas and their leader , Subcommander Marcos , a unique phenomenon . The 1950s and ' 60s saw the precursors of Marcos , insurgents -- now largely forgotten outside folklore -- such_as Ruben Jaramillo , Lucio Cabanas , Genaro Vazquez , Carmelo Cortes , and David Sarmiento . One-time peasant leaders , rural teachers or university_students , all became guerrillas because of the prevalent injustice in society . All were either killed in combat or ambushed by government troops on presidents ' orders . A big difference of the Chiapas guerrilleros , of course , is their taking advantage of the global information age , speaking_to the world via CNN from hidden corners of the jungle . But they are also fortunate that they had , in President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , a receptive interlocutor who chose to engage in dialogue rather than relying_on repression . While this election year has seen some notorious political kidnapings , this is not a new phenomenon either . Among the most famous victims of the recent past : Julio Hirshfeld Almada , secretary of tourism under President Luis Echeverria in the 1970s , and Jose Guadalupe Zuno , that same president ' s father-in-law ; U.S. Consul Terrence G . Leonhardy , kidnaped and released in 1973 ; Hugo Margain Jr. , son of the Mexican ambassador to the United States , who was kidnaped and murdered in 1978 . The kidnapings of business_leaders Alfredo Harp Helu and Angel Losada earlier this year struck a nerve because they coincided with the Chiapas uprising and the murder of former PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio . But although Mexico will remain largely the same no matter who wins next Sunday , the country is shedding its old skin in one important respect . Traditional institutions such_as the Catholic_Church , the political_parties , the mass media , labor_unions and armed forces are not evolving as quickly as civil society has in the past decade . Grass-roots organizations founded in Mexico_City after the 1985 earthquake have become activists devoted to protecting the environment and social renovation . The vast majority of these groups crystallized their rejection of the old PRI regime during the 1988 election . So the impulse for a new and more democratic Mexico is well-established , and it comes from the bottom up . What is needed now , whoever wins the presidency , is for political_leaders at the top to arrive_at a shared vision of the country that can encompass the grass-roots progress of the past decade . Without a common vision of the future and a new sense of trust , there can be no true peace nor governability .</TEXT>
