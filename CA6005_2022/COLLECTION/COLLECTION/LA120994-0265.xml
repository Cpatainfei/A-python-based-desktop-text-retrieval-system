   <HEADLINE> LEADERS ARE STILL EARNING PEACE PRIZE ; MIDEAST : ARAFAT , RABIN AND PERES TO ACCEPT NOBEL AWARD THIS WEEKEND . BUT THEY ' RE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR ACCORD INTACT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The three men who travel_to Oslo today to accept the Nobel Peace Prize were scrambling Thursday to salvage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process that earned them the award . Emerging from a hastily arranged meeting Thursday morning , Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , who are to share the prize with Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , each made statements designed to reassure the other ' s constituency . Peres said the Oslo accord , the peace framework that Israel and the PLO signed_in September , 1993 , would be altered only &quot; by mutual agreement &quot; and not unilaterally , as some Israeli officials hinted last week . Rabin and other officials have said it may be impossible for Israel to keep its commitment to pull Israeli troops out of West_Bank Palestinian towns and villages before holding Palestinian elections in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank . Israeli officials have expressed doubt that the Palestinian self-governing authority will be able to protect the more_than 100 # 000 Israeli settlers living_in the West_Bank once Israeli troops redeploy out of Palestinian population centers . They point to the authority ' s inability to prevent attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians in Gaza , which it governs , and to its reluctance to crack_down on Islamic militant groups in Gaza , as evidence that it will be unable to provide security in the West_Bank . Directly addressing that Israeli concern , Arafat said after his session with Peres that the Palestinians will take Israel ' s security needs into consideration as the two sides continue to negotiate . Arafat then rushed to Jabaliya refugee camp to mark the seventh anniversary of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli military rule_in the West_Bank and Gaza . As the keynote speaker at a low-key rally organized by Fatah , the PLO faction he founded , he promised the cheering crowd that he will remember those who died fighting the intifada and not abandon their dream of establishing an independent Palestinian state . &quot; The promise is still the promise , the commitment is still the commitment , &quot; he said . &quot; Our journey is not a walk down the park , but a long hard road that we must travel together until we reach Jerusalem. &quot; Peres returned to Tel Aviv , to a special Cabinet meeting called to decide the government ' s position on continuing negotiations with the Palestinians . Dovish Cabinet_ministers said they were disappointed that the government ' s conclusion , after a series of three special_sessions on the negotiations with the Palestinians , was simply to continue implementing the Oslo accord . The government made no mention of uprooting some of the more isolated settlements in Gaza and the West_Bank as a way to ease Israel ' s security dilemma . Several of the more dovish Cabinet members have been urging that settlements in the West_Bank be concentrated into a_few large blocs that the army could more easily defend . Peres , Rabin and Arafat are expected to hold more talks in Oslo before receiving their joint award Saturday . Rabin is said to be trying to sell Arafat on a compromise that would allow Israel to limit the redeployment of its troops in return for Israeli concessions on the type of elections the Palestinians want to hold . The Palestinians have been pushing for elections that would form a legislative_council of 100 members . Israel wants a smaller executive_council and says it does not want any Palestinians from East Jerusalem to run in the elections . The dilemma for Arafat is that he is trying to entice the largest Islamic opposition movement , Hamas , into participating in the elections . Hamas is almost certain to boycott any vote unless Israel makes substantial redeployments from most of the West_Bank .</TEXT>
