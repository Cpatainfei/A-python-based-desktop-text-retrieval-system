IT IS STILL USED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD ; WHEN IT RISES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE IT FALLS WITH RAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jeep Pagel rappelled down a spectacular rock cliff to a ledge harboring two peregrine_falcon chicks , pulled on a surgical glove and gathered_up broken eggshells . &quot; A toxicologist told me , ' Don ' t touch the eggs . They ' re loaded with organochlorine contaminants , ' &quot; the U.S. Forest Service biologist said afterward . More_than 20 years after DDT was banned in the United States and the peregrine_falcon species was put_on the endangered list , the deadly pesticide still is causing problems for the bird . DDT , ingested by the falcons through the birds they prey on , has long been blamed for eggs with shells so thin they often crack before they can be hatched . Now Pagel is wondering whether DDT or other chemicals could be responsible_for an unnatural 2-to-1 proportion of females to males among chicks , and whether they are also causing female behavior in at least one male adult . &quot; With these contaminants introduced into the system since the 1940s , I may never have seen normal peregrine behavior , &quot; he said . DDT came_into wide use during World_War_II to control insects such_as lice and mosquitoes . Through the 1950s and ' 60s , it was widely used to control crop-eating insects . But when scientists discovered that birds such_as the peregrine and the bald_eagle were ingesting the pesticide and were unable to hatch young because of eggshell thinning , DDT was virtually banned in the United States in 1972 . The bald_eagle has recovered enough that the government took it off the endangered species list , classifying it instead as a threatened species . The effects of DDT on wildlife have been dissipating as the chemical gets buried in the sediment of rivers and bays , said D . Michael Fry , a research physiologist at the University of California at Davis . But storms and dredging stir it up from time to time , and the pesticide still is used in Central_America and other parts of the world , where it contaminates migratory birds . In warm weather , the chemical becomes volatile . It is carried into the atmosphere and falls to earth in rain around the world . &quot; We see it in the snow and ice of Antarctica , as well as the Arctic , &quot; Fry said . &quot; I think the problems with DDT are much reduced in the temperate_zones , but it will continue to pose a global risk if it is used in other parts of the world. &quot; Patricia Zenone , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist in Reno , Nev. , is analyzing a proposal that the status of the peregrine species in the West be changed from endangered to threatened . After the 1992 breeding season , the Western states counted 591 breeding pairs , compared with estimates of fewer than 50 pairs in 1973 . Still , peregrines in southwestern Oregon , the California coast near Big Sur and West Texas have problems . Pagel , who keeps watch_over 37 nests in Oregon and Northern California , counted an average of one chick per nest . that ' s better than the 0.7 count of recent years , but still below the 1.5 needed to maintain a stable population . Zenone believes peregrines are contaminated by DDT from migrating to Mexico and Central_America and from eating birds in North_America that have been south of the border . Pagel said he believes the sources of contamination may be closer to home , in forests that were sprayed for years with chemicals to control weeds and pests . He is finding that peregrines in Oregon that nest below 2 # 000 feet elevation don ' t travel very far or eat migratory birds in winter . And it is in winter that the falcons form their fat reserves , where DDT is stored . Pagel also found that in one nest in Oregon , the male is failing to feed his mate while she is brooding and is trying to bump her off the eggs . &quot; It ' s like there ' s two females in the nest , &quot; Pagel said . DDT and other chemicals , such_as PCBs , mimic the female hormone estrogen and cause malformed male sex_organs in species from sea_gulls to alligators . &quot; We banned DDT basically because of its eggshell-thinning effects , &quot; Fry said . &quot; Its feminizing effects , although reported 13 years ago , really have not been of great interest until the last couple of years . But I think there ' s much more danger to wildlife than just eggshell thinning. &quot; Nobody knows what is skewing the peregrines ' sex ratio . Fry said he doubts it ' s DDT . Pagel suggested it could be other unknown or unmeasurable contaminants .</TEXT>
