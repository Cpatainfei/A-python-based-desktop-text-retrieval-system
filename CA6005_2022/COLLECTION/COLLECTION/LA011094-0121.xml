   <TEXT> Brown-skinned Hawaiians grumble about white-skinned bosses . Filipino laborers lament Japanese bureaucrats . And a popular Portuguese comedian pokes_fun at them all -- to nightclub patrons from all_over the world . &quot; We have Caucasians filing race-discrimination cases , and we have Hawaiians filing race-discrimination cases , &quot; said Linda C . Tseu , executive_director of the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission . &quot; It ' s across the board. &quot; Aloha from Honolulu , the multicolored picture of a multiracial world , a place with too many skin pigments , accents and attitudes to count . But if life sounds like a cross-cultural melee , guess again . &quot; There ' s more tolerance here , &quot; Tseu said . &quot; There ' s more acceptance of diversity . I think it ' s much better in Hawaii. &quot; This metropolis of 836 # 231 people , where intermarriage is humdrum , where steamed rice is served alongside Portuguese sausage , where Filipino vegetable_patches sprout next door to Japanese flower_gardens , offers just one vision of California ' s future , if population trends keep_up . Like Los Angeles , Honolulu is home to a great ethnic hodgepodge , with no single group in the majority . Yet the differences are as striking as the similarities . Residents say their island contains little of the ethnic and racial hatred that has led to violence from Los Angeles to Sarajevo to Cape_Town . Most of Honolulu ' s ethnic_groups long have identified with the larger community as well as their own . They have condoned an extraordinary rate of intermarriage , shared each other ' s customs and lived together in ethnically scrambled neighborhoods . Along the way , Honolulu ' s economy has prospered , propelling many whose roots were in fields of sugar_cane and pineapple , into the middle_class . Now , as Los Angeles continues to grapple with its own identity_crisis , some say they believe that the experience on this far-off island carries an important message : &quot; Ethnic diversity does not preclude some sense of civic unity , &quot; said Kevin Starr , professor of planning and development at USC . &quot; The model is there , and it ' s a powerful model. &quot; For Los Angeles , Starr added , greater unity &quot; is absolutely essential for large-scale economic recovery. &quot; Hate crimes , riots , boycotts of stores -- the entire list of racial conflicts that have erupted in Southern California -- are rarely suffered in Honolulu . Instead , the melange of whites ( known locally as haoles ) , Asians , Polynesians , Latinos and others cling_to perches on the economic ladder , mingling cultures and blood to a degree unmatched almost anywhere . &quot; Everybody ' s got a Japanese daughter-in-law or a Chinese son-in-law or a Filipino relative , &quot; said David A . Heenan , a white corporate chairman whose wife is from the Philippines . &quot; It ' s hard to throw stones at somebody when they ' re in the family. &quot; But make no mistake : This island society , a 2 # 557-mile plane ride from Southern California , is no multicultural paradise . Behind the inviting spirit of aloha , social tensions smolder as sugar_cane fields are paved over , living costs creep ever higher and rock-bottom service jobs await masses of the unskilled , often native Hawaiians . Thus some scholars warn against romanticizing this society and wonder if the future will prove more fractious than the recent past . &quot; Maybe instead of you becoming more like us , we ' re becoming more like you , &quot; said Noel J . Kent , a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii . Still , he added , &quot; it ' s hard to imagine the stuff that went_on in South-Central Los Angeles going_on here. &quot; Like other big cities , Honolulu is a place where racial and ethnic backgrounds can be telling clues to someone ' s niche in the social hierarchy . Top jobs in industry are occupied mostly by whites , though the days when whites alone grasped the levers of power are gone . Japanese Americans dominate the public sector , notably the state bureaucracy and schools . Many Chinese Americans have prospered in finance and real_estate . Filipinos are clustered down the ladder , often in hotel and blue-collar jobs . At the bottom are the native Hawaiians , many in low-level jobs or none at all . Those groups make_up only part of the cultural mishmash : Honolulu ' s island of Oahu is home to middle-class Korean Americans and Portuguese Americans , struggling immigrants from Samoa and other Pacific islands , fledgling entrepreneurs from Vietnam , impoverished Laotian refugees and many others . &quot; It ' s chop_suey -- all mixed , &quot; said Lily K . Yao , the Shanghai-born president of Pioneer Federal , a savings bank chartered by Hawaii ' s last king in 1890 . &quot; I ' m Chinese . I have an executive_vice_president who is Japanese , and one of the other vice_presidents is Portuguese. &quot; The mixing applies to neighborhoods , customs , even popular culture . The local version of Japanese musubi is a slab of Spam on a rice ball with seaweed . Affluent whites and Asians live close_together in pricey beachfront neighborhoods , where entry is based on income , not race . That symbol of lilting island music , the ukulele , is a Portuguese instrument named by the Hawaiians to mean &quot; jumping flea. &quot; Intermarriage is the ultimate manifestation of it all . More_than four out of 10 local weddings now unite people from different backgrounds , state statistics show -- greater than 10 times the Mainland rate , sketchy U.S. data suggests . In this climate , a recent Time magazine cover image of a young_woman of mixed blood -- created by a computer -- tickled many Honolulu readers . &quot; We were just laughing , &quot; said Mark H . Fukunaga , a Japanese American executive whose wife is white . &quot; If you took an average kid in Hawaii , this is what she would look like. &quot; Indeed : An estimated six out of 10 Hawaiian births are now children of mixed blood . Honolulu residents offer a_few theories for their way_of_life : Native Hawaiian culture has stressed acceptance and hospitality , values picked_up by newcomers for two centuries . Many immigrants are unified by a history of poverty and plantation toil . Beyond that , some say , what choice is there ? Hawaii is small and isolated , with few means of escape . &quot; We have to make_it work , &quot; Fukunaga said . Not that different ethnic_groups treat each other too gingerly . Jokes are told_on everyone that would not amuse the politically correct . Some groups are alleged to be cheap , some slow-witted , some shiftless and irresponsible . Some are said to be fond of dog meat . Frank De Lima , perhaps Hawaii ' s most popular comedian , says his own ethnic humor is based on his experience in Hawaiian society and intended to be affectionate rather than mean . Childhood memories -- the accents of friends ' grandparents , a Japanese radio_station , Hawaiian natives singing , his own Portuguese community -- are all grist for humor . &quot; We make_fun of everyone equally , &quot; said De Lima , a former divinity student whose ancestors came from Portugal , Spain , Hawaii , China and northern_Europe . &quot; If it weren ' t for humor , &quot; he added , &quot; we ' d be at each other ' s throats. &quot; Rising opportunity has also served as glue for society ' s disparate parts , many agree , with an economy that has been fueled by tourism , agriculture and the military . Unemployment is typically far below the national rate , approaching an infinitesimal 2 % range at the end of the 1980s . Fukunaga ' s grandfather , for instance , got his start as a cook on a ranch in the early 1900s . Later , the immigrant from Hiroshima opened_up a tiny garage . Over the years , his business grew_into Servco Pacific , a family enterprise that today owns Toyota and Chevrolet dealerships and sells boats , office equipment and home_appliances , among its many operations . &quot; If Honolulu -- or Hawaii -- has one real contribution to make , it ' s in putting_together a successful , multicultural society , &quot; said Fukunaga , 37 , the company president . The society is facing new strains , however . Job growth has stalled amid a stubborn recession that descended in late 1991 . Tourism has been hit by the economic slumps in California and Japan . On Oahu , there were 1.4 % or 6 # 000 fewer payroll jobs in October than a year ago , according to Hawaiian bank economists . More broadly , the gulf between rich and poor has widened , albeit less sharply than in the nation overall , while living costs remain punishing -- up_to 40 % higher than the U.S. average . Affordable housing has long been scarce . Many labor at two or even three jobs to keep a roof over their heads . Meanwhile , poorly educated islanders face the same barriers to a better life that have-nots face in South-Central Los Angeles and the rest of urban America . Rodolfo Ramos , 47 , a Filipino who worked his way from the sugar_cane fields to a $ 12.41-an-hour job in the &quot; shop , &quot; will lose his job sometime this year when the Oahu Sugar Co . shuts down its refinery about 15 miles from downtown Honolulu . &quot; I ' ve lost track of how to compete outside , &quot; he said . But Ramos , who says he still remembers when his father drove a meat truck from camp to camp in the plantations , worries even more about his less-skilled counterparts . Overall , 350 people are going_to be laid_off and set loose in a job market that requires ever-more credentials , even for tasks such_as raking golf_course sand_traps and planting grass . &quot; You go_to the golf_course , but they want you to have good communication skills , know the job and be able to read , &quot; Ramos said . &quot; Some of the workers don ' t have that . It ' s sad. &quot; Downtown , in a 23rd-floor office , a corporate_executive also worries about the economy ' s ability to spawn an adequate supply of decent jobs for the future . Toss_in the chronically high living costs and &quot; it ' s going_to create social tension , no question about it , &quot; said Heenan , chairman of Theo . H . Davies &amp; Co . His own company , part of Hawaii ' s original &quot; Big Five &quot; corporate elite , illustrates some of the shifts reshaping the economy . In the 1980s , TheoDavies unloaded a sugar_cane plantation , cattle_ranches and macadamia_nut orchards , and picked_up 85 Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants . Oddly enough , it was Heenan ' s predecessors in the corporate elite who dreamed_up the policies that led to today ' s ethnic stew . Business_leaders , eager for a labor_force , recruited plantation workers from China , Japan , Portugal , Puerto Rico , Korea and the Philippines as long ago as the mid-1800s . Workers were divided by ethnic origin , housed in segregated villages and even paid different wage_scales based on their origin . Ultimately , however , the divide-and-conquer policies sparked a backlash . Organized labor preached a gospel of multiracial unionism , and , by the 1940s , it prevailed in Hawaii ' s sprawling fields of sugar_cane and pineapples . &quot; I ' m told by the old-timers that they ' d actually overturn elections &quot; to ensure an ethnically varied union leadership , said Guy Fujimura , secretary-treasurer of the International Longshoremen ' s and Warehousemen ' s Union Local 142 . &quot; You ' d have to have one Japanese guy , one Chinese guy , one Filipino guy and one Hawaiian guy. &quot; One result : Hawaii ' s cultures have had a long_time to get used to each other , unlike Los Angeles , which is being redefined by a much more recent wave of immigration . Island politics , once dominated by white businessmen and the Republican_Party , also has had time to evolve . Realpolitik , Hawaii style , has dictated inter-ethnic alliances since the 1950s , when Japanese American war veterans led a Democratic Party takeover of the state_government . &quot; The genius of Hawaii ' s politics is that nobody has 51 % , &quot; said Dan Boylan , a political commentator and historian . &quot; If you want to win , you have to cross ethnic lines. &quot; Today ' s more-inclusive politics has not meant social equality for all , however . A hierarchy of skin shadings exists to this day , with lighter colors often on top . Daphne Barbee-Wooten , an African American lawyer who sits on the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission , recalled her own experience on the jobless line in the early 1980s : &quot; I noticed that the people on the unemployment_line were brown-skinned and the people behind the counter were Japanese . You could just visualize it. &quot; The disparities lead to accounts of bias . &quot; We ' ve heard stories from people whose employers are Caucasian , and we ' ve heard stories from people whose landlords are Japanese or Chinese or Filipino , &quot; said William T . Emmsley Jr. , executive_director of a jobs program for Samoans . Overall , whites make_up 31.6 % of Oahu ' s population , according to the 1990 census , a share inflated by the large , transient military community . Japanese Americans are next with 23.3 % , Filipinos , 14.4 % and native Hawaiians with about 11 % . African Americans , mostly in the military , make_up 3 % , while Latinos make_up nearly 7 % , though that figure is somewhat inflated because it includes many Filipinos . Native Hawaiians , who once showered white newcomers with hospitality , are the most aggrieved of all : They suffer the highest rate of infant_mortality and poverty , the lowest life_expectancy and are more likely to wind_up living_in jail or on the beach than most others . The growing sense of injustice has sparked an emerging Hawaiian &quot; sovereignty &quot; movement , which demands a return of government-owned lands to native Hawaiians , some form of self-government and added spending on social_services . &quot; Hawaiians have given a lot of aloha and hospitality to generations of people from other countries , &quot; said Davianna McGregor , a university professor born to a Hawaiian father and Portuguese mother . &quot; Now it ' s time for some reciprocation for the Hawaiians. &quot; That sort of talk raises new us-and-them issues , even for many who sympathize . &quot; Does_it mean I get some land and you don ' t ? I get a tax_break and you don ' t ? I pay_for water and you don ' t ? &quot; asked Thomas P . Gill , an attorney and former Democratic member of Congress . &quot; What does_it mean ? You see letters coming_into the newspaper , and people are starting to say : ' Hey , what about me ? ' &quot; For now , at least , many with Hawaiian blood remain more concerned about everyday survival than separatist politics . At a sugar_refinery near downtown , Jason Sniffen is about to lose his job . The refinery , where he has worked for 10 years packing sugar , is going_to switch technology and fire most of its 61 workers . Yet Sniffen , 27 , whose ancestors were Hawaiian , German and Filipino , expresses no envy of more privileged residents or anxiety about newcomers competing with him for the limited job supply . His plan , he declares on a break from the conveyor_belt , is to become a diesel mechanic , a goal he is confident he can reach . &quot; I ' d have stayed here till I died , &quot; he said , a snowy coating of sugar clinging_to his worn black work boots . &quot; Now I have more choices. &quot;</TEXT>
