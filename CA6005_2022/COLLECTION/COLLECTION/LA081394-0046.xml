   <HEADLINE> WINNER ' S NAME TELLS THE STORY ; HORSE_RACING : MAN O ' WAR SUFFERED HIS ONLY DEFEAT 75 YEARS AGO TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A promising 2-year-old thoroughbred , winner of the first six starts of his career , loses a race at Saratoga by a half-length . It was a surprise , but no shock . The colt was poorly ridden . And counting_on consistency from 2-year-olds is always a risky proposition . Upset ' s defeat of Man o ' War in the Sanford Stakes 75 years ago today became a landmark in racing history only after the fact -- after Man o ' War took_on near-mythical proportions as a 3-year-old . And there was not a word spoken after that race , either , of Saratoga as a &quot; graveyard of favorites , &quot; even though Upset ' s victory came later to symbolize how the betting favorites here seemed to lose so often . &quot; The 1919 Sanford has become an event retroactively , &quot; said Tom Gilcoyne , librarian at the National Museum of Racing in Saratoga Springs . &quot; Man o ' War was such a great horse afterward that everyone wanted him undefeated . Some of it was cold-blooded revisionist thinking . If Man o ' War had lost another race or two , that Sanford would n ' t have been as important. &quot; Man o ' War nearly wasn ' t allowed to run_on ovals at all . The stable of his owner , Samuel D . Riddle , specialized in steeplechasers and for a time the handlers of the original Big Red considered making him a jumper . His extraordinary talent convinced them otherwise . At Saratoga in August of 1919 , Man o ' War ' s promise was obvious , but unfulfilled . He shared the spotlight that August with other stars , including Sun Briar , Hannibal and Upset . Big Red went_off as an 11-20 favorite in the Sanford . &quot; He was a big strong bull of a horse , &quot; said John H . Clark , a thoroughbred agent in Lexington , Ky . &quot; He went where he wanted to go . He was piddling around that day , and his jockey was overconfident and put him on the post at the starting line. &quot; Man o ' War was nearly last off the line . Later , he twice was hemmed_in by slower horses . Finally running free down the stretch , Man o ' War was gaining with every stride against Upset when he ran_out of track and lost by a half-length . &quot; Seldom has a defeated horse become such a hero as has Man o ' War , &quot; the New York Times observed a week later . &quot; Having all_the worst of the racing luck , and being in a pocket twice after getting_away from the post almost last , he was coming so fast at the end he would have won in another stride or two. &quot; Man o ' War ' s jockey , Hall of Famer Johnny Loftus , took the blame for the defeat . Man o ' War got revenge 10 days later in the Grand Union Hotel Stakes at Saratoga . Bettors again installed him as an 11-20 favorite . Upset went_off at 6-1 . The race was never close . Man o ' War passed Ever Gay in the first furlong and stayed in front . Loftus outran the early traffic and , rounding the final turn_in the clear , he made_sure Man o ' War was tight to the rail down the homestretch . &quot; With a gigantic stride he loped away from his rivals , and when there was no possible chance of losing , Loftus eased him up , &quot; wrote Ed Curley of the Knickerbocker Press . At the finish_line , Loftus , looking_back nonchalantly , had slowed Man o ' War to a walk . That allowed Upset to narrow the gap to two lengths at the finish_line . Man o ' War ' s winning time was 1:12 for six furlongs -- slower than he had run in the Sanford . And Man o ' War won easily despite carrying 132 pounds to 125 for Upset and 115 for the rest of the field . Riddle , who said he had turned_down an offer of close to $ 100 # 000 for a colt he paid $ 5 # 000 for in 1918 , sensed the place Man o ' War was to hold_in racing history . &quot; He is a great race_horse , probably one of the greatest we have seen in a decade , &quot; Riddle said after the Grand Union Hotel Stakes . &quot; I look_for great things for him as a 3-year-old . He will always remain my property . I feel that a great horse like this is in a way public property. &quot; Man o ' War ' s incredible exploits as a 3-year-old are what he is_best remembered for . Virtually no one would race against him nor bet against him . He was unbeatable , and everybody knew it . He carried as much as 135 pounds in handicap events , routinely giving_up 10 or even 20 pounds , but still no one would race against him . Eight horses lost to Man o ' War in his 1920 debut , the Preakness . In the last 10 races of his career , he ran against only 15 other horses . Six times , there was only one opponent . &quot; He ran_out of competition , &quot; Clark said . Three times that year he was a 1-20 or 1-25 favorite . Four times he went_off at 1-100 . He won both the Preakness and the Belmont in 1920 , but Riddle skipped the Kentucky_Derby that year . An often contrary person , Riddle knew he had_the_best horse in the country and figured he did not need the Derby to prove it , Clark said . In October of 1920 at Kenilworth Park in Windsor , Ontario , a race was arranged with Sir Barton , a brilliant 4-year-old who had become the first Triple_Crown winner in 1919 . Man o ' War , a 1-20 favorite , shattered the track record for 1 1 / 4 miles by six seconds and won by seven lengths in what would be his last race . Riddle retired the colt to stud in Kentucky in 1920 . Although Riddle often lined_up unpromising mates for him to breed , Man o ' War still managed to sire a Triple_Crown winner , War Admiral , in 1937 . Man o ' War died at 30 in 1947 in Lexington . About 2 # 000 attended his funeral , which was broadcast nationwide on radio . Riddle once was offered $ 1 million for Man o ' War by a Texas oil man . He declined . &quot; Many people have a_million dollars , &quot; Riddle said . &quot; But only I own Man o ' War. &quot;</TEXT>
