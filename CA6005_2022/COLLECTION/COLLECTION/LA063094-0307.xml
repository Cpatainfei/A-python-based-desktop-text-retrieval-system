   <HEADLINE> DOLLAR HITS ANOTHER LOW AGAINST YEN ; MARKETS : GLOBAL CURRENCY TRADERS REMAIN UNIMPRESSED BY BENTSEN COMMENTS . DOW OFF SLIGHTLY ; YIELDS EDGE DOWNWARD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. dollar plunged to another record low against the Japanese yen Wednesday , highlighting the growing inability of the United States and other nations to block the will of the world ' s vast and turbulent currency markets . The day before , U.S. Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had proclaimed his support of the dollar in the strongest Clinton_Administration statement to date on the greenback ' s travails . But the high-level remarks failed to impress speculators in the global currency bazaar , which handles an estimated $ 1 trillion a day . Traders in Asia , Europe and North_America drove the dollar down against the yen , though not against other currencies . &quot; This is the first time we ' ve seen such a successful , concerted attack on the dollar , &quot; said Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co . in New York . &quot; It ' s rather terrifying. &quot; The dollar closed at 98.60 yen in New York , down from 99.95 on Tuesday , and at 1.5855 German marks , up from 1.5795. It closed_in early-morning trading in Tokyo today at 99.07 yen , down 0.20. U.S. stocks , meanwhile , had an up-and-down day , with the Dow industrials falling 2.59 points to 3 # 667.05 after having risen more_than 20 points earlier in the day . Other stock barometers rose moderately , and long-term interest_rates edged downward . Gold prices fell . Most attention was_on the dollar , however , in which losses were focused against the yen . Indeed , the dollar edged_up against the_Swiss franc , French_franc and British_pound , underscoring the strength of the yen and concerns about the U.S. trade_deficit with Japan . In a news briefing Wednesday , Bentsen repeated his statement of support for the dollar , saying , &quot; We believe a stronger dollar is better for our economy and better for the world ' s economy. &quot; However , analysts said the market was more interested in the political and economic realities that have prompted the continuing shifts in currency values . They also expressed doubt that the White_House can muster the will or financial firepower to prevail over the currency markets . &quot; The problem is an issue of confidence -- confidence in the Administration , &quot; said David Solin , a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics , a New York consulting firm . Japan ' s trade surplus with the United States , which is running in the $ 60-billion annual range , is increasingly being seen as a reason for the strengthening yen and weakening dollar . In addition , the Japanese have become less inclined to invest their profits in U.S. bonds than in the past , fearing inflation and rising interest_rates . Moreover , U.S.-Japanese trade issues remain unresolved , and the emergence of a shaky new Japanese government with a Socialist prime_minister suggests that such issues will smolder for a long_time . &quot; How can they come_to the table and talk_about trade and make great strides if politically at_home it ' s a mess ? &quot; Solin asked . It was also unclear Wednesday how long it would take the political situation in Japan to sort itself out . &quot; We ' re looking_at two or three years of political uncertainty in Japan , &quot; said Lawrence B . Krause , a professor at the Graduate_School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at UC San Diego . Investors are looking_to two events next week for further clues to the dollar ' s course . The Group of Seven leading industrial powers is scheduled to meet in Naples , Italy . At the parley , global strategies to stabilize the dollar will be discussed . An increase in short-term U.S. interest_rates and a decrease in currently higher_German rates , for example , would make American securities more attractive and stimulate demand for dollars . The Federal_Reserve_Board makes the decisions on U.S. interest_rates , and its Open Market Committee is to meet Tuesday . The purpose of higher rates , which some experts think are unnecessary , would be to keep the U.S. economy on its current non-inflationary course and perhaps to change international sentiment about the dollar , which has lost about 10 % of its value against the yen and mark this year . The Fed has already raised interest_rates four times this year , pushing_up short-term interest_rates 1.25 percentage_points since February . Whether an interest_rate increase would stabilize the dollar remains at_issue . &quot; Look_at all_the increases we ' ve implemented this year -- and look_at where the dollar is , &quot; said Maria Fiorini Ramirez , president of a New York investment advisory firm . On Wall_Street , stocks traded solidly higher for most of the day , with the Dow rising more_than 20 points , then falling_back . Still , analysts said the market held_up well given the dollar ' s record low against the yen . Winners topped losers by about 7 to 5 on the New York Stock_Exchange , and most broad market indexes finished higher . In the bond market , the yield on the Treasury ' s 30-year issue eased to 7.51 % from 7.52 % on Tuesday . U.S. markets may have been helped by strength in Europe . In London , the FTSE-100 index jumped 37.3 points to 2 # 946.3 , its third straight advance despite global currency turmoil . In Frankfurt , the DAX average rose 28.04 points to 2 # 046.30. Stocks in Mexico_City also rebounded . The Bolsa index rose 38.70 points to 2 # 270.93. Tokyo stocks finished lower , but their selloff was muted even as the dollar sank . The Nikkei index eased 158.23 points to 20 # 481.00. Among U.S. highlights : * Retail stocks paced the broad market ' s advance , on expectations that sales are improving after a weak spring . Dayton Hudson jumped 2 to 81 , Sears gained 1 to 47 7 / 8 , J.C. Penney surged 2 to 52 3 / 4 and Ann Taylor was up 3 / 4 to 39 3 / 8 . * Among industrial stocks bouncing_back , Nucor rose 1 7 / 8 to 71 , Cummins Engine gained 1 1 / 8 to 43 1 / 8 , Parker Hannifin added 7 / 8 to 42 1 / 2 and Dover rose 1 1 / 8 to 59 1 / 2 . * Some telecommunications issues were also strong . LDDS Communications jumped 1 1 / 2 to 16 3 / 4 , General Instrument rose 1 1 / 2 to 57 3 / 4 and 3Com surged 1 3 / 8 to 51 1 / 8 . * STRAINED RELATIONS : Japan election results could hurt trade talks , economic reform .
