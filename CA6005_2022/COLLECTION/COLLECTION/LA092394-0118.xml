   <HEADLINE> REBUILDING JOB : STARTING FROM GROUND ZERO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The American military takeover is easy , &quot; the industrialist said . &quot; The soldiers simply point their guns and things get done . Rebuilding this country , now that is hard. &quot; The industrialist was being flip , but the assessment was right on point . Haiti is so manacled by devastation and economic despair that the task is not one of rebuilding but one of constructing , almost from scratch . Haiti has never had anything resembling a modern economy , and the overwhelming majority of its people have lived as virtual peons to a handful of rich plutocrats . Life_expectancy has never been higher than 45 years , more_than 10 % of all babies die at birth , and more workers than not have never received wages . And since the Sept . 30 , 1991 , military overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , what passes for life has become even worse . The last three years of brutal military rule , awesome corruption , mismanagement and a crushing international economic embargo have left Haiti truly beggared , a largely barren lump of infertile dirt . Of the 2 # 400 miles of roads that theoretically traverse this Maryland-sized nation , only 600 are &quot; paved. &quot; Most of the rest can barely be described as dirt_tracks . According to engineers , only one highway is capable of carrying heavy trucks safely and at reasonable speed : a 50-mile stretch built recently between Port-au-Prince and the Dominican_Republic border to carry smuggled gasoline . Most assembly_plants and a large section of the country ' s shrinking agricultural areas have crumbled and are idle . Those that could be made productive in a hurry are no longer connected to anything by serviceable roads . There is virtually no electricity outside Port-au-Prince , where service is so severely curtailed that lights are available for perhaps four hours a day to only a handful of neighborhoods . Telephone_service is a cruel joke . Not one of the country ' s 6.5 million inhabitants has access to public potable water . Most public workers have not been paid in two months ; there is a shortage of local currency ; inflation is at least 80 % ; an estimated 90 % of the work_force is unemployed . &quot; What we have here is a pre-primitive society , &quot; a European economist said as he looked_around . &quot; Most primitive societies are self-sufficient . Haiti now can ' t even feed itself , let alone produce anything. &quot; No matter the street stability brought by the presence of the 15 # 000 U.S. troops still pouring into the country , no matter the restoration of Aristide , no matter anything the Haitian people themselves do , constructing a new Haiti will be almost entirely in the hands of foreigners , according to several economic and political experts . The necessary money -- at least for a start -- is there , in theory . Various government and international financial_institutions have pledged about $ 1 billion over the next half a decade , with about half of that for the first year . But the gossamer nature of such commitments is underlined by the evaporation of more_than $ 500 million in additional aid that had been earmarked for Haiti two years ago as the political crisis dragged_on . &quot; The problem then , &quot; an international economist said , &quot; was the bleak outlook for a settlement . The ( international ) agencies simply couldn ' t hold all_the funds in_abeyance , and it went elsewhere . &quot; A major problem now is the inability of Haiti to even absorb a lot of money . we ' ll need approved plans ( from a restored Aristide government ) and proof that the funds will be used efficiently and productively. &quot; Now and for the foreseeable future , even lifting the international embargo will strain the country ' s capacity to unload and process new goods . The two main ports , here and in the northern city of Cap Haitien , are occupied by U.S. forces . Other ports either are too small or lack working equipment to handle even mid-sized ships . Discounting the American military equipment , the Port-au-Prince docks have only one working crane and one forklift . Warehouse capacity is weak , and existing petroleum storage_tanks cannot handle more_than one tanker at a time . So even when sanctions are lifted , there still won ' t be sufficient gasoline . Another barrier is disagreement within Haiti about what should be done first . International lending_institutions and the private financial sector have accepted a free-market economic approach written by Haiti ' s most respected economist , former Finance_Minister Leslie Delatour . And nearly all experts agree that the first task is political -- the establishment of a stable , rational political_system that will draw foreign investment . But after that , the discord starts . Marc Bazin , a discredited political figure for his support of the coup but still a respected economist , argues for immediate construction of infrastructure -- &quot; utility lines , wharves , refineries , factories , all connected by good roads . It makes no sense to build these things and then leave them useless and cut_off , &quot; he said . Leaders of the assembly-plant sector , which provided 36 # 000 jobs in 140 factories making everything from T-shirts to baseballs until forced to close by the embargo , say what is needed after political stability is an immediate improvement in the lives of ordinary people . &quot; We have to address the poverty , open real schools , stabilize prices with emergency measures , increase the money_supply , create jobs , &quot; one businessman said . Then , he said , the infrastructure can be addressed . Lurking behind all_the plans , proposals and hopes is concern among the business_community and among diplomats and economists over Aristide ' s incoming administration . During the seven months he was in office before the coup , Aristide delayed several major loans and financial-aid plans , either by failing to develop workable proposals for the money ' s use or by not addressing the corruption that seemed to be copied from the practices of his dictatorial predecessors . &quot; It took us six months to deliver $ 25 million in aid , &quot; said one international financial expert of the president ' s initial term , &quot; because Aristide did not sufficiently explain how he was going_to use the money or satisfy us that it would n ' t just vanish into the pockets of his people. &quot; U.S. diplomats and even some business_leaders are optimistic that Aristide ' s return engagement will be different , even if the president doesn ' t want them to be . &quot; He ' s only got a year to go &quot; before his term expires , one diplomat said , &quot; and he won ' t be able to do much harm , even if he wants to , and I don ' t think he wants to . Aristide knows that if he is to change this country and have a political future , he needs the foreign money . So he will behave. &quot; * Besides , a business_leader said , &quot; 15 # 000 American troops will remind him of who is really in_charge . He ' ll do what they tell him needs to be done. &quot; The real issue , a diplomat said , &quot; really isn ' t efficiency or even honesty of the government . What really matters is whether Haiti can ever recover. &quot; MISSION OF MERCY : U.S. troops enjoy new role as peacekeepers . A5 RELATED STORIES , A4-5 Who Reports to Whom in Haiti ?
