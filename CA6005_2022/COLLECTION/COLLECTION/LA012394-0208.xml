   <HEADLINE> FINLAND FORESTERS CAVE IN , CARE FOR TREES ; ENVIRONMENT : WOODLAND MANAGERS MOVE AWAY FROM CLEAR-CUTTING PRACTICES WHEN THEY ARE THREATENED WITH LOSS OF MARKETS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stung by environmental criticism and possible loss of markets , managers of Finland ' s vast forests say they are treating their trees better after decades of abuse . &quot; The eyes of Europe are_on us , &quot; said Juhani Pyykkonen , trudging through the snow in a forest he supervises 350 miles north of Helsinki . &quot; When we walk in our forests , we no longer walk alone. &quot; At issue is the practice of clear-cutting -- felling all trees in an area , removing bushes , plowing the land and planting new trees . Wildlife habitats are destroyed ; the new forests , with fewer tree varieties , are vulnerable to disease and pollution . As a result , environmentalists say , the white-backed woodpecker could become extinct by 2000 . In addition , 700 animal and plant species are disappearing because of Finnish forestry methods . Finnish paper makers , the world ' s second-largest exporters after Canada , protested when leading German printing houses declared recently they might halt imports from producers who clear-cut forests . The statement followed a campaign by the environmental group Greenpeace among major buyers of Finnish paper . &quot; You cannot compare our forests with the massive clear-cuttings in the Amazon , Siberia or North_America , &quot; said Vice_President Pauli Hanninen of United Paper_Mills , Finland ' s main producer . &quot; We don ' t destroy our forests . We ' re confident our felling practices will stand_up to scrutiny. &quot; Forests provide 40 % of Finnish exports . In 1993 , forest products earned an estimated $ 8 billion , up 17 % from 1992 . Hundreds of newspapers and magazines around the world use Finnish paper . Pine , spruce and birch_trees cover more_than two-thirds of Finland , but heavy logging since the 1950s has destroyed more_than 90 % of natural forests in what had been called Europe ' s last wilderness . &quot; One cannot call it a wilderness anymore , &quot; said Erkki Lahde of the Finnish Forest Research Institute . &quot; Less than 2 % of primeval forest remains. &quot; Last year , about half the 45 million cubic_yards of timber Finland ' s paper_mills used were from clear-cuttings . But foresters say clear-cuttings , once commonly larger than 2 # 500 acres , now average 3.7 acres . Foresters select individual trees for felling and allow more natural growth by leaving grown trees in felling areas to provide new seeds . Deciduous trees and shrubs , once thinned_out in planted conifer forests , are allowed to grow freely . &quot; We don ' t cut_down and poison saplings anymore . We let them grow as they enrich the soil and give us a better forest , &quot; forester Pyykkonen said . &quot; Before , economic considerations were paramount . Now we take the environment into account at every level. &quot; Finland ' s forests are in no danger of disappearing , industry spokesmen say . Annual fellings amount to 67 million cubic_yards , while total tree growth is 104 million cubic_yards . Environmentalists say the industry ' s reliance on this simple quantitative measurement is what got the trees into trouble . Felling methods were tightly controlled by a national forestry board . Despite improvements , Finnish foresters have much to do if they intend to conform_to the new international convention on biodiversity , he said . The convention , signed by 170 nations at the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil , calls_on nations to develop ways of preserving the diversity of life and ensuring sustainable use of living resources . &quot; If we conformed_to the convention , it would mean stopping all clear-cuttings , &quot; Lahde said . &quot; We are shifting in the right direction , but it may be a question of too_little , too late. &quot;</TEXT>
