   <HEADLINE> CRUISE VIEWS : COURSES IN HISTORY FOR STUDENTS OF LUXURY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The stylish and luxurious little 80-passenger Aurora II , and its sister_ship Aurora I , are two of the best-kept secrets in the cruise world . They sail to some of the most exotic spots on the globe , with naturalists and historians on_hand to tell passengers everything they might wish to know about Cambodia ' s Angkor Wat or Ireland ' s Dingle Peninsula . The ships carry a clutch of Zodiac inflatable landing_craft to cruise past blue-footed boobies nesting on rocky cliffs in Mexico ' s Sea of Cortez , or to study the endangered Pacific_Ridley sea_turtle in Costa Rica . There ' s a gala captain ' s party , open single seating in the dining_room and a sophisticated singer-pianist for after-dinner dancing . The only problem with falling_in_love with the Auroras is that they make_it tough to plan your next trip . While most cruise lines provide travel_agents and potential passengers with a brochure covering all sailings for the next year or two , the Auroras ' parent company , Classical Cruises , sends_out information one cruise at a time as it comes available , usually six to nine months before sailing . The reason : Classical Cruises is the retail arm of New York-based Travel Dynamics , a leading cruise-charter company for museum and alumni group travel . Group charters take priority ( they are usually arranged well in_advance ) . Then Classical Cruises takes_over the marketing on any given sailing with space remaining , or on any unchartered date . At that point , they send_out brochures to travel_agents and former passengers . All a prospective Aurora passenger has to do is get_on the mailing_list . Your travel_agent should be able to help . It ' s also possible to join an affinity group such_as the Smithsonian Institution or the American Museum of Natural_History to go_on one of these lecture-intensive educational voyages , or join up with fellow alumni from your college or university . A third way to book is through Tauck Tours in Westport , Conn . ( tel . 800-468-2825 ) . The company has chartered the Aurora II this summer for sailings to Scotland , the Baltic , the Mediterranean and the Aegean . The Aurora II has long , sleek , yacht-like lines , a trim dark-blue hull and big windows in all cabins except the lowest passenger deck , which has portholes . There ' s one owner ' s suite with two separate rooms and two marble baths that can sleep three adults or a young family . The suite costs about $ 525 a day per person , double occupancy . Then there are 16 large A-category cabins ( about $ 350- $ 450 a day per person , double occupancy , depending_on itinerary ) , with twin_beds that can be electronically cranked_up or down by remote_control for reading or TV . Each cabin has its own TV with built-in VCR , and the library has a full stock of feature_films on video . A desk / dresser combination , mini-refrigerator , corner table with lamp , reading_lamps over the beds , two overstuffed armchairs , two low chests , two large closets with folding_doors and an especially spacious bathroom with marble counter , tile walls and tub with overhead shower make these comfortable quarters for two people . Nineteen B , C and D category cabins are very similar , with lower prices because they are located slightly fore or aft . ( Amidships offers the most stable ride. ) Two considerably smaller E-category double cabins on the lowest deck provide showers instead of tubs and portholes instead of windows , and are listed at about $ 269- $ 367 a day per person , double , depending_on the cruise . Six single cabins round_out the picture at $ 375 a day . Air / sea packages are offered for all sailings , with a group escort on_hand every step of the way to handle any questions . While we found both the food and service to be better than average , we were disappointed to find only very large tables in the dining_room for six , eight or 10 people with open , single-seating , with no options for a couple who may wish occasionally to dine alone . At most dinners the Austrian chef offered three main dish choices -- a meat , fish and vegetarian specialty -- along with a choice of appetizers , soups , salads and desserts . The wine list is fairly priced , with some choices for under $ 20 a bottle . Breakfast is served in the cabins , the dining_room and on the deck , the latter a quicker service of many of the same dishes . The stewards and stewardesses ladle out food from the buffet and carry plates to the table for the passengers , so there is little real self-service . They serve the increasingly rare midmorning bouillon , homemade cookies turn_up every afternoon at teatime , and a pizza-and-Bloody-Mary pre-lunch party and full-scale barbecue dinner on the outdoor deck are scheduled during every cruise . Lunches are usually served in the dining_room or on deck when the weather is nice . Coming_up for the Aurora II later this spring : a 13-day land / sea itinerary departing Naples May 12 for Lisbon , calling_in Tunis , Malaga and Casablanca and overnighting in Marrakech . A 14-day land / sea program from Lisbon to Glasgow follows on May 24 . For brochures of upcoming sailings , call ( 800 ) 252-7745 .</TEXT>
