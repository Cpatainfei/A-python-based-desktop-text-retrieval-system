   <HEADLINE> U.S. ASKS ALLIES TO ACT QUICKLY ON NATO PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration sought Saturday to maintain the momentum of its new &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; program , urging U.S. allies to move ahead quickly on setting_up machinery to enable new Eastern European democracies to take_part in NATO exercises . Arriving_at a two-day conference of European defense ministers here , U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry called_on NATO countries to take &quot; vigorous , concrete actions &quot; to provide facilities and training for former Warsaw Pact military_units . Perry told a news_conference late Saturday that now that the program has been formally adopted by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , it is &quot; urgent that we get_on_with the task of creating ( it ) . . . brick by brick . I am here this week to begin that process. &quot; He also sought to assure America ' s Western European allies that despite Washington ' s public optimism about developments in Russia , the Administration is aware that the situation there could sour quickly and that it is beginning to grapple with what to do should that occur . Perry ' s appearance at this weekend ' s conference marked his first foreign trip as defense_secretary . The 66-year-old former Stanford_University professor was sworn_in Thursday night to succeed Les Aspin , who had held the post for a year . Perry had been Aspin ' s deputy secretary . In addition to attending the meeting , Perry also held private talks Saturday with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ; Volker Ruehe , the German defense minister ; Rudolf Scharping , Kohl ' s possible rival in upcoming elections , and Malcolm Rifkin , the_British defense minister . Perry will speak at the security session today . Perry ' s message was aimed at dealing with two problems : a suspicion by Eastern Europeans that the Partnership for Peace program is only a political cover_for refusing them immediate NATO membership , and a fear by Western Europeans that Washington is unrealistic about the outlook in Russia . Under the partnership program , unveiled by President Clinton at a NATO summit in Brussels last month , Eastern European democracies would be permitted to take_part in some special activities with NATO units but would not be allowed to join NATO immediately . To date , only four Eastern European_countries -- Poland , Romania , Estonia and Lithuania -- have signed_up for the program , but Perry said that he expects a dozen more to join in the weeks ahead .</TEXT>
