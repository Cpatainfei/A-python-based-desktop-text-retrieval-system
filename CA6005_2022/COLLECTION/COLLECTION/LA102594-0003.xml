   <HEADLINE> THE LONG AND TWISTED ROUTE TO ' ISLANDS ' ; EDUARDO MACHADO ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THE CUBAN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IN A COMPLEXLY PLOTTED FOUR-PLAY DRAMA . HE SUCCEEDS ONLY WHEN HE LETS HIS CHARACTERS GO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Few playwrights in this country have explored the Cuban American experience . Eduardo Machado ' s six-hour two-part , four-play drama &quot; Floating Islands , &quot; which has received a lot of ink and a lavish production at the Mark Taper Forum , helps to fill that gap . The problem is that Machado ' s epic , which opened Sunday , doesn ' t so_much evoke this particular experience as over-explain it . &quot; Floating Islands &quot; follows the Ripoll family from middle_class to affluence in late 1920s Cuba to exile in Woodland Hills in 1980 , and the story is rife_with personal upheaval -- infidelity , loss of business , suicide , exile , separation , supernatural occurrence and incest between brothers , to name a_few . In weaving so many plot twists into a story of massive political upheaval , Machado raises questions that are not germane to an already complicated dramatic schema . What separates tragedy from hyperbole ? Does a vast historical backdrop dignify soap_opera ? Historical events drive much of the personal anguish , and those events define the characters more_than the author ' s insights or his ear for dialogue , which is leaden . Arguments do not erupt ; they sound purely scripted : &quot; We believe_in fairness ! Greed , my son , is a terrible thing ! &quot; says a patriarch . Motivation is painted on . &quot; we ' ll find justice by making ourselves rich ! , &quot; says a man whose father-in-law has just been murdered . The first play , &quot; The Modern Ladies of Guanabacoa , &quot; establishes gender roles in pre-revolutionary Cuba . A mother and daughter sneak cigarettes and inhale the dream of independence , which takes the form of a short haircut like the ones in fashion magazines . But , it is stressed , an unmarried daughter should remain unkissed . The sons expect to be waited_on , and they enshrine their mother and sister in worship while firmly demanding they go fetch a cup of cafe . Male infidelity is expected ; female is shocking . When a daughter-in-law is seen dancing the tango with a man other_than her husband , matriarch Maria Josefa ( Miriam Colon ) takes the terrible news to Arturo , her tyrant-anarchist husband . &quot; I want our family to be respected , &quot; she tells him , something he no doubt already knows . Machado can rarely let_go enough to let his characters just live . But when he does , particularly in the third play , &quot; Fabiola , &quot; he tends to go overboard , as if he doesn ' t trust himself to convey their pain . By now , it ' s the early 1960s , the time of the Bay of Pigs , and two families related by marriage are living under one roof in Cuba . The Ripolls have lost their thriving bus business to the revolution , and the families are deeply divided on the Castro issue . Perhaps to exemplify the decay of their society and their sense of dislocation , and also to show the flip side of the macho ethic , two brothers are engaged in a rather passionate incestuous affair . Perhaps to show the irrationality that is all around them , their lust spills_over into the living room on an evening when the family is at_home . As one of the brothers pulls their sister into the sex play , the scene reeks more of melodrama than of the anguish Machado is trying to convey . The pain of the Ripoll family and , later , the Marquez family into which they marry , takes many nasty turns through four generations , providing the actors with much to chew on . Under the direction of Oskar Eustis , the actors get_to switch roles and play their own offspring , or , occasionally , step outside the family altogether . This kind of thespian reshuffling is often fun for the audience , and provides a chance for the actors to show_off their range . But , because Machado ' s dialogue doesn ' t vary much from character to character , the technique often muddies the picture . For example , Oscar ( Joe Urla ) , the animated , nervous suitor who marries into and becomes the head of the Ripoll family , is replaced in the second play by the actor ( Victor Argo ) who formerly played the ramrod patriarch Arturo , Oscar ' s father-in-law . But Argo ' s Oscar is completely different in mannerism and energy , far more_than the passing of years could explain . In fact , Machado doesn ' t explain why certain characters change so drastically over time or how they can simply leave their pasts behind , as if they had been endured by another person ( or actor ! ) . Osvaldo is one of the incestuous brothers in &quot; Fabiola. &quot; By the fourth play he has divorced his wife Sonia for an Argentine woman yet is still drawn to Sonia . &quot; Oh , &quot; said the man sitting behind me , &quot; so he ' s not gay anymore ? &quot; Some individual performances stand_out . Miriam Colon is especially good as the servile Maria Josefa becomes a crusty old_woman who can finally say what she thinks . Alma Cuervo is a life force , and she is the only actor who actually plays off what the actress who preceded her in the part did physically . Joe Urla is vivid as the nervous young Oscar , but by the time he takes_on the play ' s contemporary Oscar , a rather swishy cocaine_addict , he seems to be conducting a seminar in overacting . The last play , &quot; Broken Eggs &quot; is perhaps the most successful because the playwright is no longer explaining a culture , he is simply showing us a little of_our_own . As the characters stretch_out on the stage in a Valium haze as one sings about the lost homeland , the toll of all_of the political and personal upheaval is exacted in a sweet , sad scene . It ' s as if , having told his story , the playwright has finally rested and let the characters and their pain simply take_over the stage . * &quot; Floating Islands , &quot; Mark Taper Forum , 135 N .
