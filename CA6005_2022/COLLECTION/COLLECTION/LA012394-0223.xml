   <TEXT> After slogging through it , being stuck_in it and even dying from it , you ' d think that human_beings by now would know everything there is to know about snow . Not so . Solid , liquid and gas at varying times , snow is a complex substance whose behavior -- on land and in the air -- still eludes scientists . Wet snow is an entirely different material from dry snow , and within the wet and dry categories are numerous different types . When snow hits the ground , it is no longer the same substance that has been falling_through the atmosphere . And fallen snow , a good insulator of the soil it blankets , undergoes constant change . What happens to snow on the ground -- how it bonds , breaks_apart , melts and refreezes -- matters for everything from avalanche prediction to the design of better-performing tires for military tanks and private cars , safer skis for airplanes , faster skis for people , more effective but environmentally correct de-icing chemicals for highways and &quot; grooming &quot; techniques for smoother , longer-lasting snow roads and snowmobile trails . The end of the Cold_War has melted some snow-cover research , says Russell Alger , director of the Institute for Snow Research in Michigan ' s Upper Peninsula . Except for Bosnia-Herzegovina in winter , the big push now militarily is for improved vehicle mobility -- not in snow , but in desert sand . More_than 95 % of Earth ' s seasonally snow-covered land lies_in the Northern_Hemisphere , which holds most of the planet ' s landmass . From December through March , the white stuff blankets 16 million to 20 million square_miles of the hemisphere , the majority of the land north of 40 degrees latitude . By midsummer it all disappears , except for glacial snow and ice_fields . Since 1972 , satellite images , which have provided the first consistent record of snow coverage , have shown that the year-to-year horizontal expanse of winter snow has not varied significantly across the Northern_Hemisphere as_a_whole . &quot; But the snow has melted earlier in the spring in the past six years -- in March and April , rather than April and May , &quot; said geographer David A . Robinson , of Rutgers University in New Jersey , who has analyzed the satellite data . &quot; The biggest change in recent snow cover is not so_much its lack in winter as its early end , its reduction in spring , &quot; agreed Kenneth F . Dewey , professor of climatology at the University of Nebraska . Why the early spring snow loss ? Scientists aren ' t sure . &quot; There is a strong correlation between temperatures in the Northern_Hemisphere and the extent of snow cover , &quot; Robinson said . &quot; Does recent warmth in spring cause the early end of snow cover , or does the early snow loss have a subsequent impact on temperature ? Once you have the loss , it kind of snowballs. &quot; Researchers are &quot; trying to unravel this chicken-and-egg question , &quot; Robinson said . &quot; It is too early -- the record is too short -- to attribute this to global warming. &quot; While snow coverage has not changed much globally , snow depth may have decreased . There is no similar satellite record , because the current technology cannot yet distinguish different snow depths . &quot; Monitoring snow cover may give an index to future climate change , &quot; Robinson said . &quot; Snow has to be an important piece of the climatological puzzle. &quot; Earth loses a good portion of its heat from the reflection of sunlight off snow . Snow on the ground , especially fresh snow ( the whitest ) , reflects back about 90 % of the sun ' s rays , said Samuel C . Colbeck , a senior research scientist at the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in Hanover , N.H. &quot; The more snow cover , the more solar_radiation is reflected back. &quot; To fit another piece into the weather puzzle , Dewey is analyzing satellite data of Southern Hemisphere snow cover_for the first time to determine whether it is in phase with the Northern_Hemisphere ' s . About 800 # 000 square_miles of the Southern Hemisphere , mostly in South_America , are snow-covered seasonally .</TEXT>
