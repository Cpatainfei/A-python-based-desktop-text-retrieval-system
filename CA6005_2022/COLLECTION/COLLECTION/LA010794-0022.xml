   <HEADLINE> A GIFT FOR GORE ; AT 15 , MAKEUP ARTIST JOSH BREZNER HAS CREDITS IN MORE THAN 30 MOSTLY SCARY PRODUCTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For most kids , seeing one of the gory , horrific &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street &quot; movies means going_to_bed with the light on for several months . But for Josh Brezner of Granada Hills , all that big-screen murder and mayhem was an inspiration . He got some clay and began trying to re-create some of the effects , in particular a scene where a woman turns_into a cockroach . &quot; I was 10 and I had never seen anything like that before . It was fantastic . That got me started into effects and makeup , and it hasn ' t been boring yet , &quot; Josh says . Now 15 and a sophomore at Van Nuys High_School ' s production magnet , Josh makes his friends jealous when he talks_about his weekend and after-school jobs . He has credits in more_than 30 productions , including student films , music videos and a Hollywood play . &quot; When I ' m at a screening of a film I ' ve worked_on and the crowd moans when they see an effect I ' ve created , it ' s a rush . It ' s even better on a set when I ' ve made a wound and the people around me know it ' s fake , and they still turn_away . I want to say , ' Thank_you , ' &quot; Josh says . He credits his early success to his parents ' approval of his creative energy . &quot; From early on he ' s been interested in special_effects , and we ' ve encouraged him , &quot; says Michelle Brezner , his mother . Josh ' s parents have become accustomed to driving him to and from early-morning shoots . &quot; This is something he ' s good at and he loves , so we do what we can for him , &quot; she says . After watching Josh try to duplicate the cockroach , Michelle Brezner called UCLA to see if there were any extension_courses for children who wanted to learn about movie special_effects . The effects classes were for adults only , but teacher Marilyn White was impressed by Josh ' s creativity and got him a job cleaning_up at Cinema Secrets , a Burbank store that sells makeup and special_effects equipment . Josh took the prosthetics and creature effects classes offered at the store , then began assisting on shoots , helping to create scars and wounds . &quot; I was 11 when I worked my first set , assisting Marilyn on a movie . It was a little scary , I didn ' t know what to expect . But everyone was nice , and it was cool to be so young and these adults were treating me like an adult . It blew me away. &quot; Soon he began getting calls from student directors needing some nasty scars on their actors and earned his first solo credit for the film &quot; Tonto Tiempo &quot; ( 1991 ) . The work for film schools doesn ' t pay much , often just his lunch and expenses , but Josh meticulously keeps videotapes of his work for his growing portfolio . &quot; I ' m not sure yet what I ' ll do right after high_school , but I definitely want to be involved in this , &quot; he says . Just the names of some of the student films Josh has worked_on , such_as &quot; Rigor Mortis &quot; and &quot; The Tar Monster , &quot; both made in 1993 , suggest these could be great showcases for his talent . Fortunately for him , there aren ' t many E.M. Forster adaptations made in film school . &quot; ' Brain_Drain ' was definitely the toughest movie I ' ve worked_on , &quot; he says of another 1993 project . &quot; The director wanted nonstop effects . It was the first time I was absolutely essential to the production . If I didn ' t show_up , they couldn ' t film. &quot; His challenge was to rig_up a plumbing_system that dripped liquid from the heads of 20 extras -- i.e. , the &quot; Brain Drain. &quot; &quot; I had to find a way to make this work and was able to get a plumbing prosthetic that dripped and looked realistic . They say you learn something new on every shoot , and it ' s true , &quot; he says . After being called_for a job , Josh reviews the script and goes_over the effects with the director . &quot; I want to find_out what the director ' s vision is , what he sees for the effects . Sometimes he has specific ideas of how he wants a monster to look or how a wound should be , other times he ' ll leave it up_to me. &quot; Like other kids his age , Josh spends time in the library , but not doing book reports . While coming_up with ideas for effects , you can find him in the dark shelves surrounding medical and forensic pathology books . &quot; I ' ll look_for pictures of rashes , burns , gunshot wounds . You have to know what these things look_like in_order to make them realistic , &quot; he says . While Josh prides himself on the realism of his effects and makeup jobs , there ' s one effect that eludes him . &quot; It ' s virtually impossible to make realistic blood , &quot; he says . When you prick your finger and watch the blood come_out , you can see how it moves , it almost seems alive . That just can ' t be duplicated. &quot; Actors aren ' t always easy to work with , especially when a guy who doesn ' t have his driver ' s license yet is trying to get you to hold still until your scarred body dries . &quot; In the classes I took I had a lot of effects done to myself so I know what it feels_like . A lot of people don ' t like to have any makeup or chemicals put near their eyes and I try to work with that . I ' ll tell the actor what I ' m doing , what I ' m using , just make him feel comfortable , &quot; he says . In a recent music video , Josh made his acting debut . &quot; Queenie , &quot; by the group Ethyl Meatplow , features a bizarre dream sequence in which a jazz quartet plays for an unusual group of dancers . In the background , the bass player with the slicked-back hair hams it up . &quot; It was a little strange being in front of the camera . I was there just to do makeup , and the director asked if I wanted to be in it. &quot; The director , Joy Ray , had used Josh for &quot; Brain_Drain &quot; and also selected him to work_on another music video , Porno for Pyros ' &quot; Sadness , &quot; this time only off camera . &quot; I had to create more scars on an actor ' s back that matched the scarring he already had . It took a little while before it was right , but I got_the_hang of it. &quot; Josh ' s biggest project to date has been creating a hunchback for an actor in the West Coast Ensemble ' s production of &quot; La Malasangre &quot; in Hollywood , which closed_in December . &quot; It ' s the first job that wakes me up at night . In a film , you create an effect , and you rely_on the camera and the editing to give you the best angle . With a play , the audience is all around , and I needed to make a hunchback that looks real from every seat . And , in a film you do an effect , and it just has to work once . With a play , it ' s got_to work every night. &quot; &quot; I never had any doubts that Josh could do the job , &quot; says Robert Madrid , an actor and director who recommended Josh for &quot; La Malasangre. &quot; &quot; For a 15-year-old , he ' s very confident , and he handles himself well . Not many kids are like that. &quot; Being around so_much horror , it ' s hard to believe anything could scare Josh . &quot; I can sit through the goriest movies and not even blink , &quot; he says . &quot; But real violence , real horror , I can ' t take . I saw someone fall_down an escalator and get cut_up and I just froze and turned white . I ' m more squeamish than you ' d expect. &quot; Where and When What : Josh Brezner ' s makeup work can be seen in the music videos &quot; Queenie &quot; by Ethyl Meatplow and &quot; Sadness &quot; by Porno for Pyros , currently aired on MTV .</TEXT>
