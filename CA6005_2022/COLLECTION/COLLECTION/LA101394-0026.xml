   <HEADLINE> SIGHTS ; TWO SOBERING LOOKS_AT THE RAVAGES OF AIDS ; SHOWS AT VENTURA COLLEGE HELP HUMANIZE THE DISEASE AND COMPEL VIEWERS TO THINK OF WORKS UNFINISHED AND LIVES CUT_SHORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In connection with AIDS Awareness Month , Ventura College art instructor Richard Peterson has curated two separate exhibitions that deal , in different ways , with the devastating effects of AIDS on the arts community and beyond . A posthumous one-man show and a group show by Santa Barbara artists responding to the epidemic are affecting in ways that transcend conventional aesthetics . At issue here are both the ways in which artists are personally touched and driven to action , and also the large task of continuing to stir_up public awareness . Most poignant , and closest to home , is a retrospective show of work by Glenn Harris , a Ventura-based artist who died of AIDS last March at age 44 . Harris ' art , in the New Media Gallery , conveys not so_much rage as it does a fervent appreciation of landscape , life and light . Harris , who took art_classes at Ventura College , was involved in a group show last year at Santa Barbara ' s Channing Peake Gallery called &quot; Living With. &quot; What we find here is a selection of work from Harris ' prolific last decade . It showcases his appealingly loose representational style and bold sense of composition , which give his landscapes and flora studies a palpable , breathing quality . From the evidence of this sampling , Harris seemed more interested in the hidden forms and metaphors in nature than just pursuing idle beauty . &quot; Cacti &quot; is an imposing tangle of lines and volumes , and he relished the almost primitive construction of aloe . Paintings of koi transform into nearly abstract , iridescent splashes of color on black . The most engaging example of Harris ' painterly eye is a large untitled oil_painting on the far wall of the gallery . Here , bursts of red blossoms are pitted against spare , twining branches , contrasted with a blue_sky composed of energetic paint whorls . A self-portrait finds the artist looking gaunt , resigned to a rueful fate , but a more affirmative portrait of the artist can be seen in the painting called &quot; Glenn , Gracie , and Geo. &quot; The artist , viewed at a distance , is flanked by two dogs , walking along a country road raked by rays of waning twilight . This painting , flecked with symbolism , becomes a touching leitmotif for the whole show , a graceful farewell to a man who found solace in art . Several Santa Barbaran artists were involved in the show at Gallery 2 , &quot; Artist ' s Response 1994. &quot; The work includes such reportage as Nell Campbell ' s photographic field reports from AIDS-related marches and rallies -- here there is none of the ironic levity that Campbell often deploys . Inspired assemblage artist and avowed miniaturist Elena Mary Siff shows tiny framed relief pieces commemorating the &quot; Night Without Lights , &quot; the December eve in 1990 when New York City dimmed its public lighting as a sympathetic gesture . The real faces of AIDS can be seen in the centerpieces of photographer Susan Jorgensen ' s series titled &quot; The Last Picture. &quot; The photographer depicts departed AIDS victims -- many of them prominent Santa Barbara-based AIDS activists -- with handwritten texts swirling around their faces . Barb Parmet ' s &quot; The Spirit Lives On &quot; is a photo-tapestry that also grants specific names and faces to AIDS . Ginny Brush ' s computer-generated print , &quot; Got Insurance ? &quot; presents the sobering sentiment of the title , with conceptual roots in Ed Ruscha ' s word-paintings and the Milk Advisory Board ' s current ad_campaign . Rose Bilat ' s relief pieces , in homage to AIDS victims , have an elegance and abstract subtlety that contrasts with the more direct impact of the other artists . Also included here are a_couple_of works by the late John Bommer , a promising young Neo-Expressionist artist who studied at UC Santa Barbara and died of AIDS in 1986 . Like Harris , Bommer was given a posthumous show , at the Contemporary Arts Forum in Santa Barbara . Seeing works by late artists in this way humanizes the disease and amplifies the inherent tragedy . We are compelled to think_of the work that went unfinished , and of lives cut drastically short . LADIES BY NIGHT AND DAY : Canadian-born and Los Angeles-based artist Neil Boyle worked for decades as an illustrator for various magazines , and his current show at the Conejo Valley Art Museum smacks of illustrator ' s kitsch . Seeing this subtlety-free work in an art_gallery makes_for a disorienting viewing experience . The show goes_by the inexplicable title &quot; Last Artist Before the Freeway , &quot; but lest you think it relates to life in this area before the 101 changed everything , think again . The freeway in_question is more a mythic concept than a site-specific reality . He shows wistful images of Wild_West saloon life and Native_American portraits ( for good measure ) , with a caricatured , stereotyped quality implying that the artist has watched too many B Westerns . But , in this exhibition , Boyle mostly trains his eye on the female form in various stages of undress . He depicts prostitutes on the frontier , in a cartoony way rather than with a concern for social realism . There is something creepy and coy about Boyle ' s figure studies , especially in his titles . The phrase &quot; soiled dove &quot; is a favorite term for these &quot; ladies. &quot; A painting of a nude on a divan , better than most in the exhibit , is curiously tainted with the title &quot; A Frail Flower of the Prairie. &quot; His models flash come-hither glances and strain under titles like &quot; You See Anything You Like ? &quot; or &quot; Well , It ' s About Time ! &quot; ( Beware titles armed with exclamation_points ! ) By the evidence here , Boyle comes_off like the last artist before feminism .
