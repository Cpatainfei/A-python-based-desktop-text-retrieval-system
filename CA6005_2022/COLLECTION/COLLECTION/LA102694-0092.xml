   <HEADLINE> THERE OTTER BE A WAY TO HELP ; that ' s WHAT MOTIVATES WORKERS WHO AID ORPHANED SEA MAMMALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> April was sleeping_in a shallow pool between two rocks when a little boy pointed down and shouted , &quot; Look_at that fish ! &quot; Another boy tried to correct him , calling April a seal . April would have none of that . She shot the boys a casual glance , rolled_over as if to show the world that she was an otter , not a fish or a seal , and went_back to sleep . The sun had finally burned through the fog , the gray mist giving_way to the sparkling Pacific . The patio above the Great Tide Pool at the Monterey Bay Aquarium had become a busy place . But April , curled_up in a puddle , was unfazed . * Sea_otters often visit the waterfront exhibit at the popular aquarium on Cannery Row . But none seem as at_home there as April , and for good reason . April was raised there . &quot; She ' s definitely one of our success stories , &quot; a proud Candice Tahara said . As coordinator of the otter rescue-and-care program at the aquarium , which last week celebrated its 10th anniversary , Tahara works long hours behind the scenes . She and a small group of employees and volunteers act_as surrogate_mothers to young otters , giving stranded young pups another shot at life . &quot; With every one that comes_in , we ' re just giving them a second chance , &quot; said Susan Rainville , whose responsibilities include swimming with pups and teaching them the ways of the wild . &quot; We know that not all_of them are going_to survive , but we do what we can. &quot; April was 5 weeks old when she became separated from her mother during a fierce storm that hit the Central California coast during the spring of 1990 . She was found on the beach the next day , a quivering ball of fur crying_for her mother . April got a new mother , or mothers , albeit human ones . Stranded pups such_as April -- an otter is considered a pup until it is 12 weeks old -- begin their new lives in the aquarium nursery . It is a room with a waterbed inside a giant crib and a 4 x 12-foot tank , 3 1 / 2 feet deep and full of rocks , sea_urchins , sea_stars and other critters common in Monterey Bay . The surrogate_mothers actually cuddle with the pups on the waterbed and feed them a vitamin-enriched liquid formula of clams , squid , fish_oil and half-and-half until they are ready for the small tank , where they are reintroduced to their natural surroundings . The tank is only a_few feet deep because the young otters don ' t yet have the strength to get their furry bodies to the bottom . Otters have the thickest coat of any mammal , with as_many as a_million hairs per square_inch . The hairs trap air , which acts_as insulation and helps keep the otters buoyant . The orphans are eventually moved to an outside tank and monitored before being scheduled for swims with their surrogates beyond aquarium walls . When they go_out , they are tagged and fitted with radio_transmitters so they can be tracked if they venture too far . Sometimes visitors to the aquarium can watch from the patio as the swimmer dives for &quot; prey , &quot; and as the young otter tries to do the same , using all its might to dive deep enough to follow its &quot; mother. &quot; She will teach it to use rocks to dislodge shellfish and to rest_on its chest so it can use its paws to grasp the prey -- usually shellfish -- and crack it on the rock . The surrogate_mother will sometimes stay in the water with the pup for three hours at a time . The maternal bond with the pup in the wild is a strong one , and the pup requires constant attention . &quot; In the last two years , we have really been increasing our efforts , spending more time_out in the ocean with them , making longer swims and just trying , as swimmers , to increase our stamina underwater , &quot; Rainville said . Staff_members were especially careful with April , watching_over her in the tide pool for 45 days and nights , like a mother would a child in a swimming_pool , before determining she could fend_for herself . &quot; Just giving her the support of a mom , &quot; said Linda Yingling , a nursery worker since 1988 . And , like any grown child , April still returns for an occasional visit . * Monterey Bay Aquarium is the only facility in the world with a program geared to rescuing and rehabilitating otter pups with the intention of returning them to the wild . The sea_otter as a species can certainly use the help . The animals , which once had a worldwide population of 200 # 000-350 # 000 thriving along the Northern Pacific rim from Japan to Baja California , were prized for their fur and hunted_down to about 2 # 000 in the 18th and 19th centuries . Sea_otter pelts were one of the first California commodities sold outside the state . But by 1820 , the animals had all but disappeared from our shores . They were actually thought to have been exterminated until a colony of about 50 animals was discovered by scientists near Big Sur after the turn_of_the_century . The otters became exposed to the public with the opening of California 1 in 1938 . The sea_otter is now a federally &quot; threatened &quot; species and has begun to come_back . Still , the California population has not come_back as well as some had hoped , in part because of the low survival rate for pups -- more_than 40 % die within four months of birth for a variety of reasons . There are about 2 # 400 otters in the state , all_of them off the Central California coast . &quot; Our record as far as successful releases -- and by successful I mean we know that they were able to survive and find their own food upon release -- equals what occurs in the wild , which is about 50 % , &quot; Tahara said . The staff has rescued 103 stranded otters in the last 10 years , 34 of which were returned to the wild . Every year , Tahara says , the staff learns more about getting more back into their natural environment . A key , Tahara says , is to limit their contact with humans , to develop the maternal bond as quickly as possible and maintain it until the animal is capable of striking out on its own . This puts an emotional twist into the work of the surrogate_mothers . &quot; With a swimmer , there ' s even a stronger bond than in the nursery because they have the ability to go_off if they want to , &quot; Rainville said . &quot; And they do go_off with wild otters , but then they come_back to us . &quot; I once had an otter with a sea_star ( also called starfish ) stuck_on his chest , and he was far off in the bay , and he comes barreling in and he kind of just flipped_over in front of me and , it was like he was screaming , ' Get_it off me. ' And as soon as I got_it off , he just relaxed. &quot; That was a pup named Spanky . Spanky never did get_the_hang of catching his own food , though , and is now living at the New York Aquarium . A pup named Riley would only swim with Rainville , and liked to play hide-and-seek with her . &quot; I don ' t know if it was a game for him or what , but our swims were . . . I ' d always lose him , &quot; Rainville recalled . &quot; And I ' d have to come_back to shore and then we ' d get_in our ( skiff ) and we ' d go_out and find him , they ' d dump me out and I ' d chase him back home. &quot; Finally , Rainville determined that Riley could make_it on_his_own and refused to play the game ; she didn ' t give chase . &quot; He stuck_around the aquarium for about a month and then he just kind of went , &quot; Rainville said . &quot; We never picked_up his signal again. &quot; Yingling said it is impossible not to become emotionally involved with a young animal that has the same needs a human child has with its mother . &quot; For me , my magic moment comes when the little tiny pup crawls toward me instead of away from me on the waterbed , &quot; Yingling said . &quot; I have adult children and I think raising them has helped me become a better sea_otter mom because I ' ve already sent my children to college and know they can survive . It ' s the same feeling when the otter leaves . You know it ' s ready and it can survive. &quot; But survival isn ' t guaranteed . Before they started naming otters , they gave them numbers . No . 1845 came_into the program when he was 12 weeks old and soon earned his release . Three years later , he was found on the beach , fatally wounded by a great_white_shark . &quot; It was sad to find_out that , &quot; Tahara said . &quot; Here was a male that we had given a second chance , and . . . It ' s nature , but kind of sad that he hadn ' t even reached sexual maturity. &quot; That kind of thing can be difficult to handle , Tahara said . &quot; I don ' t even swim with them and I still get close to them , &quot; she said . &quot; And it doesn ' t necessarily have to be a pup . &quot; There was one otter that came_in and she was older -- we named her Hazel -- and she had something wrong with her back and we never did figure it out . ( After her release ) she kind of hung_out in the tide pool with April and slept on the rocks with her . . . . And then she was found dead a while later and , I remember when I found_out she died , I burst into tears . It was like , I don ' t know , I seem to get attached_to the ones that are like underdogs. &quot; * Currently , the aquarium has two pups going_through the program . One is a playful young male named Axel , who is living_in a quarantine tank on the roof above the facility ' s huge kelp-forest exhibit . Axel seems happy enough being hand-fed and cared_for by humans , which is good because it has been determined that he cannot forage for himself and will not be returned to the wild . During a recent swim in the bay , Axel fled and was eventually tracked_down . &quot; He had self-released prematurely and lost so_much weight in the wild that we felt he did not have the skills to survive , &quot; Tahara said . &quot; Being that we could not form that bond with him , swim him to show him the skills , we felt_like we would send him out there and he would n ' t survive . And we felt that wasn ' t responsible. &quot; But Axel ' s tank-mate , Simon , despite being much smaller than other males of the same age , has demonstrated remarkable skills since being picked_up recently from the rocks at nearby Moss Landing . Simon is wary of all but his handlers and actually seems eager to get_back to the bay . He is scheduled for release in a_few weeks and the vast emerald forests of kelp will be his to rediscover . Perhaps , like April , he will return to the tide pool for a visit .</TEXT>
