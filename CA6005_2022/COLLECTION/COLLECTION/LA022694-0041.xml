   <TEXT> The personal library and archives of the late Marija Gimbutas , considered the world ' s leading researcher on the goddess tradition of Old Europe , will soon be part of the Center for the Study of Depth_Psychology , an independent research_center on the campus of the Pacifica Graduate Institute in Carpinteria . The provocative findings of Gimbutas , a UCLA professor emeritus of archeology , fired debate among scholars -- but her four decades of research into Stone_Age cultures convinced many experts that her thesis is valid . She concluded that during the Neolithic period ( roughly 10 # 000 BC to 4 # 000 BC ) people worshiped female deities and women enjoyed slightly higher_status than men . In all that time , the area known as Old Europe ( Eastern Europe and Turkey ) knew no war , had no military class and maintained near-equality between sexes . The Lithuanian-born scholar integrated paleontology , linguistics , history , mythology and folklore in her richly illustrated books , which were read by many non-academics . Her last work was &quot; The Civilization of the Goddess , &quot; published in 1991 . Mythologist David L . Miller , the Watson-Ledden professor of religions at Syracuse University , said , &quot; The addition of Marija Gimbutas ' papers makes Pacifica a resource for some of the finest comparative study in ancient mythology. &quot; He pointed_out that the Pacifica archives already contain the library of the late historian and philosopher Joseph Campbell , a preeminent mythologist , and will also receive the library and papers of James Hillman , a prominent Jungian psychology theorist , practitioner and author . The institute , founded in 1974 , grants advanced degrees in mythological studies , counseling psychology and clinical_psychology . &quot; It is one of the two or three places in the country where one can seriously . . . combine an interest in the humanities and psychotherapy , &quot; Miller said . Study of the humanities involves the serious academic examination of religions and mythologies , he added . Gimbutas , who died three weeks ago at the age of 73 at the UCLA Medical_Center , theorized that religion was pervasive in Old European culture -- one in three city dwellings was a shrine . All the shrines and burial_sites are decorated with paintings , figures and reliefs of goddesses . Decorations on storage bins and ovens offer clues that grain offerings , not animal sacrifices , were made to goddesses , Gimbutas wrote , and the baking of bread was considered sacred . The utter absence of weapons , warfare or evidence of violent modes of death in burial_grounds throughout Old Europe was striking . This peaceful state of affairs lasted , she maintained , until marauding Indo-Europeans invaded the region beginning in the 4th millennium BC , bringing weapons and worship of warlike gods with them . According to Karen Jo Torjesen , the Margo L . Goldsmith professor of women ' s studies and religion at the Claremont Graduate_School , Gimbutas &quot; single-handedly recovered a whole world of religious symbolism -- the female expression of the divine in Old Europe -- that is inspiring and moving to contemporary women . Most people don ' t realize that these goddess religions are as much a part of our European heritage as are the religious and political beliefs of the ancient Greeks. &quot; For information about the Gimbutas archives of the Center for the Study of Depth_Psychology at Pacifica Graduate Institute , phone ( 805 ) 969-3626 , Ext . 118 .
