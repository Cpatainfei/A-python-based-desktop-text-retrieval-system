   <TEXT> A student walking home from school is confronted by gang members who offer the ultimatum : Join the gang or die . Another student is stabbed in the back in the school parking_lot because of a &quot; look &quot; given another student earlier that day . A student of one race tells a student of another that &quot; they &quot; don ' t belong on campus . Distressing incidents such_as these -- fueled by ethnic differences , sexual tensions , drugs and other issues -- are becoming increasingly familiar to students . At many schools , efforts to control increasing violence on campus have come_in the form of suspension or detention . The idea is to assign blame and inflict punishment , often without examining the_matter or finding its underlying cause . At Westminster High_School , a different approach is being taken . On this campus , conflict mediation classes teach teen-agers how to examine and understand violence , how to counter it through self-empowerment and how to deal with it using self-confidence . While there is little that teen-agers can do directly to correct the economic and social injustices of their world , they can learn through conflict mediation how to face the violence that exists within it . &quot; Conflict mediation at Westminster High has grown so_much since its beginning that now we have 50 trained student mediators to serve the campus , &quot; said resource specialist Sharon Rawls , who coordinates the conflict mediation class and acts_as the school ' s At Risk / Cultural Diversity Mentor . &quot; The program has successfully resolved more_than 80 cases and has attracted the attention of numerous schools throughout Orange County , &quot; Rawls said . The Westminster High program received an Orange County Outstanding Recognition Award in 1993 from Supervisor Harriett M . Weider . The class is the most recent metamorphosis of a program started in 1991 to help deal with a burst of on-campus violence in late 1990 . It is based on a program established in San Francisco to deal with community-based conflicts . The conflict mediation class is a semester long , requiring 25 hours of instruction . It is given before and after school and is now administered through the district ' s adult_education department . Those who complete the course receive state certificates in mediation . The instruction helps students learn how to turn conflict into an opportunity for growth and understanding before it becomes violent , making them feel competent enough to participate in the resolution of_their_own disputes . They are taught that conflict is a natural human state often accompanying change and is_best approached with skill and a sense of understanding . Rather than viewing conflict as negative , mediation students are told to perceive conflict as a process that signals change -- neither positive nor negative , good nor bad -- that is a part of their lives . When they wake_up each morning , for example , they may have an inner conflict about whether they should get_out of bed and go_to school . When a dispute occurs at Westminster High , those involved are asked to participate in mediation . If they agree , they meet with trained student mediators in a conference_room in the hopes of reaching a mutual solution . &quot; The student mediators are not there to solve the disputants ' problems for them . Rather , they are there to assist the disputants in solving their problems themselves , &quot; Rawls said . &quot; Disputants are each given a chance to speak their own side of the conflict . . . ( and to listen ) to other points_of_view . The program is very effective because there is a greater opportunity for understanding and cooperation when mediation is_on a student-to-student level , &quot; she said . Student mediator Ryan Nguyen said the most rewarding part of mediation is seeing the anger between disputants decrease right before your eyes and result in a positive outcome . Vice principal Neil Snowden said : &quot; At first I was skeptical of allowing teens to deal with disputes and disputants on_their_own , without the intervention of adults , but then , that is the purpose of conflict mediation -- empowering youth to be responsible. &quot; Snowden is now a big supporter of the program and its 98 % success rate . Before mediation , he said , students suspended for fighting or altercations often returned to his office because suspension did little to solve the problem . * Rawls said disputants often have no understanding of what really took_place in the conflict . And when a dispute involves both aggressive and passive personalities , the passive side rarely has the opportunity to speak out . With mediation , everyone is heard . As teens go_through mediation , she said , a sense of comprehension and acceptance develops . From there , the participants move_into communication , discussion of problems and , finally , resolution . As alternatives to violence are created , doors open for those who may have grown_up believing that violence was the only way_out of a problem , Rawls said . The process begins as students learn to get_in_touch with who they are inside , discovering self-confidence . As students tune_in to their own unique personalities , Rawls said , they draw_on their abilities to help them through any situation . Not only must students have respect for one another ' s needs and individuality , they must also have respect for themselves and take_pride in who they are . Westminster High_School ' s pioneering efforts toward conflict mediation have significantly improved campus harmony , say students and school administrators . &quot; These students have not only helped their peers at Westminster High_School to strive for a more peaceful campus and student empowerment , but they have also helped themselves by acquiring communication skills which will show other students the power of mediation . They will take these skills into their careers , as well as their family life , &quot; Rawls said . Scott Lamb , a recent Westminster graduate , says his qualifications in mediation skills were one of the factors his employer considered when he was hired . &quot; Now they ' re planning on organizing a training class for company employees to help with the day-to-day conflicts that occur , &quot; Lamb said . As students learn to understand and acknowledge the needs of other individuals as well as their own , they acquire the ability to deal with confrontation , hostility and violence -- a skill that is becoming vital in today ' s society .</TEXT>
