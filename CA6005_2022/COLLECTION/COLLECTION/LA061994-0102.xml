   <HEADLINE> ACCIDENTAL ARCHEOLOGISTS DIG_UP TREASURE_TROVES OF ANCIENT ARTIFACTS ; HISTORY : VALUABLE DISCOVERIES ARE OFTEN MADE ON PRIVATE_PROPERTY BY UNWITTING EXCAVATORS . BUT REGULATING SERENDIPITOUS FINDS IS USUALLY DIFFICULT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Abir Nassee was battering a corner of the mud-and-concrete wall_in his Old City art_gallery , trying to clear_out a niche so that he could install a safe . Suddenly his sledgehammer struck something that refused to crumble . Puzzled , Nassee cleared_away rubble . Behind the new opening in the shop ' s wall he discovered a large , brownish-white stone , about 3 feet wide and 2 feet high . Nassee suspected , and authorities later confirmed , that it was part of the wall that had surrounded Jerusalem at the time of King Solomon , about 3 # 000 years ago . Half a world away , writer Paul Elliott was planting vegetables outside his home_in a Virginia suburb of Washington , D.C. , when he began to unearth fragments of strangely smooth , reddish-brown stones . Besides the usual harvest , Elliott ' s garden yielded a bumper crop of quartzite remnants from 4 # 000-year-old tools . A gallery owner and a gardener hardly fit the romantic image of Indiana Jones poking around pyramids or searching for a mysterious scroll . But , in fact , said George E . Stuart , the National Geographic Society archeologist , &quot; many discoveries , often valuable ones , are made by accident. &quot; Atop a hill near Rome , picnickers spot the ruins of a town that had been razed after a battle in 492 B.C. and sought by archeologists for centuries . On a field in Suffolk County , England , a retired gardener unearths a box containing gold bracelets , decorative silver tableware and nearly 15 # 000 Roman coins -- believed to have been buried by a wealthy family 16 centuries earlier and now worth more_than $ 2 million . Such accidental archeology offers a variety of rewards . &quot; Sometimes I sit in awe , looking_at the stones of the old wall , &quot; said Abir Nassee . &quot; I am excited to think that my ancestors maybe helped to build it. &quot; An excavation of Elliott ' s yard &quot; changed a lot of what we knew about prehistoric life in the area , &quot; said Mike Johnson , an archeologist for Fairfax County , Va . &quot; We thought people had stayed primarily along the rivers , but this put them smack dab in the interior. &quot; Under Britain ' s treasure-trove law , the Suffolk gardener may pocket the financial_gains from his cache . Despite their value and importance , however , chance discoveries evoke pleas for caution from professional archeologists . &quot; You must remember that the real value is not in the item itself , but in what it tells us about the past , &quot; said Rudolph Cohen , deputy director of the Israeli Antiquities Authority . &quot; That story can be lost if the discovery is not handled properly. &quot; Proper handling generally means leaving the site undisturbed -- at least until an experienced archeologist can examine it . &quot; If people just pick_up what they find , willy-nilly , it ' s very hard to tell anything , &quot; warned Frank McManamon , chief of the U.S. National_Park_Service ' s archeological assistance division . Many artifacts , he said , &quot; have been witnesses to the unfolding of human history . But they become mute when divorced from their original context. &quot; Most information , McManamon said , comes from studying the relationships of objects -- to each other , to the soil , to the people who used them . For example , tests on a pristine fragment of a prehistoric bowl may reveal what plants were kept_in the bowl . This , in turn , will help scientists determine what the users of the bowl ate . The strata of ground in which the bowl was found offer clues to its age . The potential for great gain and loss in serendipitous discoveries is illustrated by one of the archeological marvels of the 20th Century , the terra-cotta army of Xi ' an in southeastern China . In 1974 , peasants digging a well on a commune near the site uncovered a tunnel filled with life-size clay models of male heads , pieces of arms and torsos , metal arrowheads and other items . Stories are told of children taking pottery home to play with and of peasants offering the clay heads and other artifacts for roadside sale for $ 2.50 each . Fortunately , there were no buyers . The peasants had been instructed at commune meetings to report all chance discoveries to authorities . In time , archeologists excavated the site . What emerged were lifelike soldiers and horses in battle formation , made 22 centuries earlier to guard the tomb of China ' s first emperor , Qin Shi Huang . China isn ' t alone in strictly regulating ancient finds . Most countries with vast archeological treasures , such_as Israel , Italy , Egypt and Mexico , generally forbid private excavations and make all antiquities the property of the state , including those found on private_property . U.S. laws , tightened after a wave of looting and desecration of Native_American burial_sites , ban the removal , buying and selling of artifacts from public lands and grave sites . But for the most part , Americans may keep what they find on_their_own property . In the United States and other countries , looting and vandalism continue because the laws are hard to enforce . &quot; What we really need , &quot; said McManamon , &quot; is greater cooperation between the public and professionals. &quot; That kind of cooperation occurred after Paul Elliott made his back yard discovery . He informed the Fairfax County archeology office , which organized a dig_in which schoolchildren , college_students and other volunteers participated . Federal , state and local agencies , as well as the Society for American Archeology and other groups , are making many such efforts to work with communities . The Arkansas Archeological Society offers seminars and field programs for interested amateurs . &quot; The best answer would seem to lie_in public education , &quot; the National Geographic Society ' s George Stuart wrote , &quot; so that people can know of our rich collective past and the threats to it. &quot;</TEXT>
