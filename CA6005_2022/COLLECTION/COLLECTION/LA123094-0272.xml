   <TEXT> If there ' s a gene for obesity , as New York researchers recently announced , could there also be couch potato genes ? Jock genes ? Well , maybe.Canadian researchers are trying to pinpoint the gene or genes that &quot; predispose people to have success in sports , &quot; says Marcel R . Boulay of Laval University in Quebec_City . &quot; We know there are people who have ( better ) response in blood_pressure and cholesterol lowering , for instance , when exposed to the same training_program , &quot; says Boulay ' s colleague , Claude Bouchard . But slackers , take_note : Even if it turns_out you ' re genetically shortchanged , you ' re not off_the_hook . Fitness researchers who specialize in adherence say your genetic blueprint may someday be used to write your personal exercise prescription . Blessed with &quot; jock genes &quot; or not , more people will get moving_in 1995 , predicts John Duncan , exercise physiologist at Dallas ' Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research . &quot; Integrate exercise into your daily life , that ' s the new message , &quot; Duncan says . New , less strenuous , exercise guidelines call_for 30 minutes of moderately intense activity to be accumulated throughout the day . But for the 78 % of Americans who still don ' t exercise enough , the New Year may_not be one of increased exercise as much as increased consciousness , says James Sallis , psychology professor at San Diego State University . &quot; we ' ll have more awareness of how our lifestyles have become sedentary , &quot; he says , &quot; but ' 95 is not the year we ' ll do something about it. &quot; that ' s not all bad , though . According to Sallis and others , this contemplation stage often leads to the action stage .</TEXT>
