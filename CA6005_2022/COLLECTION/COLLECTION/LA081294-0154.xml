   <HEADLINE> CUBAN AMERICANS HOLD_BACK ON FLOTILLA ; CARIBBEAN : ATTY . GEN . RENO SAYS BOATS LEAVING FOR ISLAND COULD BE SEIZED . IN LIVE BROADCAST , CASTRO RIPS U.S. POLICY ON EMIGRANTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Warned repeatedly that they would be arrested and their boats seized , Cuban Americans here so far have resisted the temptation to launch a high-seas flotilla to Cuba to pick_up relatives and bring them to the United States . &quot; Really , people have learned the lesson , &quot; said Spanish-language radio talk_show host Tomas Garcia Fuste , referring to the chaotic 1980 Mariel boat lift , in which 125 # 000 Cubans , including large_numbers of criminals and mental patients , were allowed to flee to South Florida . &quot; They do not want to dance to Fidel Castro ' s music . There will not be another Mariel. &quot; Still , local officials remain concerned a week after an unprecedented riot on the streets of Havana and a clear threat from the Cuban president to open Cuban ports to defectors if the United States does not take &quot; serious measures to guard their coasts. &quot; Thursday night , Castro reiterated his call_for the United States to take &quot; rapid , efficient and serious &quot; measures to change its policy on Cuban emigrants . In a television_news conference that was broadcast live_in Cuba and the United States , Castro also accused the United States of covering_up the hijacking of a Cuban government boat and repeated the allegation that a Cuban military_officer had been killed . Castro said the body of Cuban Lt . Roberto Aguilar Reyes was found Wednesday , two days after the hijacking . &quot; If we hadn ' t found the body , they would have continued propagandizing that the man who hijacked the boat was the man who we say was killed , &quot; Castro said . Refugees aboard the boat have told U.S. officials that no one was killed in the hijacking . Although the Clinton_Administration said Wednesday that 12 Coast Guard and Navy vessels have been ordered to head for the Straits of Florida , Dade County Manager Joaquin Avino admitted Thursday that &quot; we face three days of lag time ( between a declared emergency and the start of a military_blockade ) , and we would be_on our own holding them back. &quot; Avino refused to divulge details of local contingency plans , but heading_off a boat lift presumably would fall to police and marine patrol agents . To underscore the Clinton_Administration ' s resolve to keep Cuban Americans from using private boats to pick_up Cuban refugees , U.S. Atty . Gen . Janet Reno said in a Thursday evening news_conference that any vessels seen leaving South Florida for Cuba could be stopped and seized . In Miami , minutes after Reno ' s remarks , U.S. Atty . Kendall Coffey announced that three men were in custody after they were found to have brought 22 Cubans into Key Largo . Coffey said the men could face charges of violating U.S. immigration laws and their 39-foot speedboat could be seized . With Coffey at the Miami news_conference were a dozen local officials , as well as Spanish-language media chiefs and exile leaders , all urging Cuban Americans to stay home . There is no evidence that any flotilla is in the making . Said Avino : &quot; The Cuban American community is not going_to let Castro say what is going_to happen here . Conditions are not the same as in 1980 ( and not right ) for another Mariel to occur. &quot; Indeed , one factor that has mitigated the desire of many in South Florida to sail to Cuba in hopes of taking relatives from there has been what Avino called the &quot; silent migration , &quot; in which thousands of Cubans who enter the United States each year on tourist visas do not return to their native_land . Dade County officials estimated that as_many as 30 % of the 1 # 600 Cubans who arrive in Miami on charter flights each week overstay visas and do not go_home . Other Cubans enter the country on illegal visas obtained in Costa Rica or the Dominican_Republic . Avino estimated that as recently as two years ago , about 14 # 000 Cubans a month were entering the country as tourists , most of them to stay . Now , with fewer tourist visas being issued by American authorities in Cuba , that figure has been cut . Still , whether they arrive on a visa or on a raft , as 400 to 500 refugees a month do now , no Cubans -- except for hard-core felons -- are ever deported . The United States treats all Cubans as individuals seeking political asylum ; the United States has no deportation agreement with Havana . Garcia Fuste said that many exiles who have been here for more_than 10 years already have managed to bring their families from Cuba . &quot; Only those who came_in the last three years or so want to get family , &quot; he said . The memory of Mariel also remains strong and bitter here . Although a proposed naval_blockade is designed primarily to stop a north-south flow of U.S. residents to Cuba , Sen . Bob Graham ( D-Fla. ) said he could foresee a situation in which Cubans would be stopped at_sea if there were evidence Castro again was sending criminals or other dangerous people to the United States . State officials are also preparing . Florida Gov . Lawton Chiles said that refugees arriving in the Florida Keys or Miami would be sent immediately to reception areas as far away as Palm Beach County , identified and medically screened and bused to a larger staging_area such_as Homestead Air_Force Base . From Homestead -- which is all but closed after being extensively damaged by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 -- the Cubans would be further dispersed to military bases outside Florida , Chiles said in a briefing Wednesday . In theory , the care and processing of illegal immigrants is a federal responsibility , and Avino said Reno and other top U.S. officials have assured him that responsibility will be met . But state and local officials know that South Florida resources will be taxed first by any massive influx of immigrants . Operation Distant Shore , the classified federal plan to deal with a Mariel-type emergency , earmarks $ 35 million to reimburse state and local_governments for housing , food and health_care . But under normal conditions , the cost of caring for illegal immigrants in Florida runs to $ 884 million a year , according to state estimates . Earlier this year , Florida sued the federal_government , saying its failed immigration policy costs the state as much as $ 2.5 billion a year in schools , hospitals , prisons and other public_services . Chiles has said the federal_government ' s failure to accept responsibility for the flood of illegal immigrants who arrive in Florida each year &quot; has created a nightmare for state and local_governments . . . ( and deprives ) our citizens of services we can ' t give them. &quot; Meanwhile , the slow-motion immigration continues . The Coast Guard reported spotting at least seven rafts in the Straits of Florida on Thursday ; the number of Cubans who have sailed to this country this year has climbed toward 5 # 400 . In 1993 -- a record year -- 3 # 656 sailed in on small_boats and inner-tube rafts . Federal authorities continued to question Leonel Macias Gonzalez , 19 , the Cuban coast guardsman who reportedly hijacked the vessel from the port of Mariel on Monday . Cuban authorities say he is responsible_for the officer ' s death . Joe Allen , an attorney representing Macias , said of his client : &quot; He ' s very frightened . But he said he would spend 20 years in jail here rather than return to Cuba. &quot; Times staff writer Art Pine in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
