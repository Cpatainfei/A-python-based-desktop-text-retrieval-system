   <HEADLINE> SURFING : BUD TOUR WINNER COMES FROM SCHOOL OF HARD KNOX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Oh , man ! We ' ve the Trestles contest , Vietnam and women all_in one column . Rockin ' Fig was just back from the U.S. Bud Tour at Trestles , south of the Orange County_line , and had plenty to say about it . Fig , who was hot ? We had the No . 2 man in the world there , Shane Beschen of San Clemente . He was looking good in the early heats but got bumped in the semis . Taylor Knox of Carlsbad was_on fire , though , and won the contest . Where ' s he been , Fig ? It ' s been quite a while since Taylor has made the finals of a Bud Surf contest . His surfing has been a little off . In fact , when he picked_up his check he admitted he was in a slump . Hopefully the victory will give him more confidence and allow him to power out for the rest of the season . Who gave him competition ? John Shimooka of Hawaii , a dark_horse . Shimooka only got four waves in the final , barely the minimum , but he got two set waves and placed second . Current world champion Derek Ho of Hawaii took third . Actually , Derek scored big-time with the five judges , scoring three 10s on a wave in the semis . He just blasted the lip like five times on that one wave ! Everyone was wondering how Ho , at age 29 , was gonna do against the younger , quicker guys but he looked pretty solid down at Trestles . I hear Jeff Deffenbaugh took fourth . Yup . He ' s on a roll . Deffenbaugh won at Virginia Beach ( Aug . 25 ) and made the finals at Trestles . That makes him rated No . 1 on the Bud Surf Tour . Isn ' t he a local from Huntington Beach ? Yeah . We haven ' t had someone from Huntington Beach holding the No . 1 spot on the Bud Tour for about 10 years . I remember that in 1988 we had John Parmenter and Noah Budroe who were in the Top 5 in 1988 . How did Kelly Slater , Mister No . 1 rated surfer in the world do ? Kelly was a no-show . He was listed on the contest sheets but never showed_up . He might have surfed in Portugal instead . * Canceled : News from the offices of the Huntington Beach-based Assn . of Surfing Professionals is that the China Beach contest in Vietnam , a popular event last year , was canceled because of a lack of financial_support . It was scheduled to start Wednesday . Fig , how does this affect things ? This is gonna create a big scramble on the World Qualifying Series circuit and will attract a bunch of surfers for the Bud Surf Tour ' s San Francisco contest . Oct . 5 through 9 . Let ' s see , there are two divisions , right ? The World Championship Tour ( WCT ) , the WQS , which includes Bud Surf Tour . Help me explain this to the folks , Fig . The guys who are in the Top 28 from the Championship Tour will be coming_back next year . But the tour also adds the Top 16 surfers from the Qualifying Series . So with Vietnam out , the guys are trying to get_into that Top 16 and the only WQS event that weekend is the Bud contest in San Francisco . Meanwhile , the world tour is headed for Brazil for the Alternativa contest Oct . 19 through 23 . Slater is still rated No . 1 on the WCT , but the Fig said there ' s a California contingent burning it up . We got a lot of California guys , probably the best group ever in the WCT ' s Top 16 , and include , Beschen in second place , Rob Machado of Cardiff , 12th ; Jeff Booth of Laguna Beach , 13th , and Knox , 14th . * Women ' s Exhibit : On Oct . 15 , the Huntington Beach International Surfing Museum will open a women ' s surfing exhibit . Ann Beasley , museum director , said it will feature photos , memorabilia , and trophies from Joyce Hoffman , Jericho Poppler-Bartlow , Linda Benson , Linda Merrill , Rell Sunn , and Mary Ann Hawkins . Photographs and a small biography on other female surfers are being accepted and are needed for a collage . Those interested should mail the information by Oct . 10 , to the museum , P.O. Box 782 , Huntington Beach , CA 92648 . The museum ' s chili cook-off , also is Oct . 15 and will be held across the street from the museum , 411 Olive St . * Who Paid ? : No one yet has been able to get a figure on paid attendance at the Op Pro and U.S. Open of Surfing at Huntington Beach put_on by Prime Ticket . Don Meek , Prime Ticket ' s vice_president for marketing , is oddly silent .</TEXT>
