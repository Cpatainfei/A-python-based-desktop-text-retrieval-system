   <HEADLINE> GINGRICH OFFERS A COMPLEX VISION OF AMERICA ' S FUTURE ; POLITICS : HIS VIEWS ARE LIKELY TO DRIVE POLICY DEBATES . BUT SOME WONDER IF HIS BELIEFS CAN BE TRANSLATED INTO LAW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I ' ve always told all_of you I was not nearly as radical as some of my friends , &quot; Rep . Newt Gingrich said in a post-election speech in which he backed_away from a colleague ' s proposal to scrap the federal income_tax in favor of a national sales tax . But the very next day , the Georgia Republican who is in_line to become Speaker of the House took a strikingly different tack . He talked nonchalantly on a television_program about slashing half a_trillion dollars from federal spending ; dismantling the Americans With Disabilities Act , an ornament of the George_Bush Administration , and removing low-income single mothers from the welfare rolls , leaving them dependent_on the beneficence of private charity . Is the 51-year-old Gingrich really the radical conservative his critics see or a self-described moderate one ? Or is the former West Georgia College history teacher in a category all his own ? The questions are more_than rhetorical . In the aftermath of the Republican takeover of Congress -- of which he was a primary orchestrator -- Gingrich has emerged as the politician of the moment . His views on a host of crucial subjects -- from the value of work to the meaning of family -- have recently overshadowed those of both President Clinton , with whom he has refused to compromise on matters of principle , and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , whom he long ago dismissed as &quot; the tax_collector for the welfare state. &quot; His wide-ranging vision of America is almost certain to drive public-policy debates during the next Congress and perhaps the 1996 presidential campaign and beyond . Those who know him best attribute Gingrich ' s world_view in large part to his life as the stepson of an Army_officer in the rural South and as an academic in a small Southern college that gave him the freedom to roam intellectually . Gingrich himself recalls a boyhood visit to the World_War I battlefield at Verdun , France , as a experience that impressed on him the potentially enormous consequences of decisions made by those who wield political power . Jeffrey Eisenach , head of the Progress and Freedom Foundation , a think_tank that works closely with Gingrich , put it this way : &quot; Newt ' s outlook is the result of a remarkable intellect combined with an Army brat who has seen the connection between action and results. &quot; Whatever the reasons , he has gone_farther than most of his peers in developing a network of ideas both broad and detailed. &quot; &quot; His big thing is the big picture , &quot; said Republican strategist Kevin Phillips . Gingrich contends that the breadth of his beliefs is not just a virtue but a necessity if they are to be fulfilled . &quot; An opportunity society requires a dynamic , expanding vision of freedom and the future , &quot; he wrote in &quot; Window of Opportunity , &quot; the book he published in 1984 and which he still draws_on heavily for his public utterances . &quot; If people . . . see a vision powerful enough , they will commit themselves to a thousand-mile march . Without that vision , they are unlikely to move at all. &quot; The most conspicuous evidence of that vision during the midterm election campaign was the GOP ' s &quot; contract with America. &quot; But this compendium of such Ronald Reagan-inspired ideas as a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution , congressional term limits and tax cuts -- all_of which Gingrich has pledged to take_up in the new Congress ' first 100 days -- represents only the tip of Gingrich ' s ideology . Here is a brief look_at the main pillars of Gingrich ' s deeper thinking , based on his utterances and on his book . Back to the future : Literally defined , &quot; futurism , &quot; one of Gingrich ' s favorite buzzwords , is a point_of_view that seeks life ' s meaning in the future , rather than in the present . But Gingrich , who calls himself a &quot; conservative futurist , &quot; takes a somewhat different approach , relying_on his faith in the future to recapture the best of the past and redirect the present . Harking back to the GOP ' s role as the nation ' s dominant and activist party in the closing years of the 19th Century , freshman Rep . Gingrich told an interviewer : &quot; I ' m a modernizer who is suggesting ( that ) we leap back an entire span and claim our own heritage again. &quot; Looking ahead , Gingrich is dazzled by an abundance of &quot; high-technology options &quot; that he argues can help rid American society of the decadence inflicted upon it by more_than half a century of liberal Democratic hegemony . He is particularly engaged by futurist writer Alvin Toffler ' s concept of &quot; triliteracy , &quot; combining the traditional three R ' s of learning with the mass media and computer_technology . Once Americans have mastered triliteracy , Gingrich claims , &quot; there will be a tremendous increase not only in America ' s productivity but also in each individual ' s creativity as people learn to retrain themselves in_order to find their own paths to wisdom and knowledge. &quot; One path favored by Gingrich is to require the House to file all its official_documents electronically , making them generally available by computer and producing , he contends , a better-informed and more active citizenry . Individual empowerment : By freeing Americans from big government and high taxes , Gingrich hopes to unleash the energies of individual enterprise and ambition . Like Charles Murray , author of &quot; Losing Ground &quot; and &quot; The Bell Curve , &quot; and other critics of the welfare_state , Gingrich argues that breaking the back of the welfare bureaucracy would benefit not only middle-class taxpayers but the poor . Gingrich contends that the current federal approach to welfare is based on what he calls redistributionist economics and counterculture values , and he argues that the inevitable result is to &quot; ruin the poor &quot; and &quot; create a culture of poverty and a culture of violence which is destructive of this civilization. &quot; The poor stand to gain the most , Gingrich says , if the paralyzing culture of poverty can be replaced with the opportunity for productivity . Meanwhile , middle-class Americans would also get a chance at greater self-fulfillment by being encouraged to work years past the so-called &quot; prime &quot; through the relaxation of current limits on retirement income . But in Gingrich ' s new_world , opportunity carries with it an enlarged burden of civic_responsibility . &quot; You cannot hire a teacher to teach your child and walk_off and then blame the teacher , &quot; he said . &quot; You cannot hire a policeman to protect your neighborhood and then walk_off and blame the police. &quot; Citizens who want to reduce the power of Washington &quot; have to take more responsibility back home. &quot; Traditional values : Certainly the most emotional and probably the most compelling item in Gingrich ' s ideological inventory is his emphasis on the restoration of traditional values . Nothing less than the survival of America depends_on the success of this effort , he said in his first major address since the election . &quot; It is impossible to maintain civilization with 12-year-olds having babies , with 15-year-olds killing each other , with 17-year-olds dying of AIDS and with 18-year-olds ending_up with diplomas they can ' t even read , &quot; he said . Although Gingrich puts some of the blame for social decay on federal policies and programs , notably welfare , he also condemns what he calls the dominant liberal culture , which he complains has put more emphasis on material goods and systems than on &quot; the power of the mind and the spirit. &quot; Some of the results he lists are more schoolchildren cheating on tests , more taxpayers cheating on their 1040 tax_forms and &quot; more freedom to read pornography , &quot; but &quot; less satisfaction from our personal relationships. &quot; To revive the nation ' s neglected soul , Gingrich calls_for a religious renaissance -- one reason a constitutional amendment allowing prayer in schools is high on his legislative agenda . Gingrich also contends that time is_on the side of boosting moral standards , suggesting that as the baby_boomer generation grays , its members , recognizing &quot; the failure of both radical hedonism and economic materialism &quot; will swell the congregations of the country ' s churches . New internationalism : Gingrich sees the need for the United States to assert its interests abroad more effectively , particularly in the field of international economics . Americans must understand , Gingrich says , that only by achieving the world ' s highest levels of productivity can they be rewarded with the world ' s highest standard_of_living . Accomplishing this , he declared in a recent speech , requires a sweeping and uncompromising reassessment of government along with the rest of society . &quot; We have to literally rethink the assumptions that grew_up in a self-indulgent national economy and recognize that litigation , taxation , regulation , welfare , education , the very structure of government , the structure of health , all these things have to be re-examined , &quot; he said . Gingrich did not make clear how much of a role he would want government to play in intensifying the nation ' s efforts to compete abroad , and most analysts doubt that he would support much direct involvement along the lines of the industrial policy approach favored by some liberal economists . But University of Wisconsin political_scientist Charles O . Jones , who is familiar_with Gingrich ' s thinking , said he believes that the lawmaker would favor having the government &quot; facilitate &quot; efforts to bolster U.S. global competitiveness through such measures as selective tax_breaks at_home and trade agreements abroad . A redoubtable Cold Warrior all his years in Congress , Gingrich also has long sounded the alarm about international terrorism . It remains a grave threat to the nation ' s security in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet_Union , he contends . In &quot; Window of Opportunity , &quot; he warned : &quot; A free , open society cannot survive by trading violence for violence . If we kill an Iranian extremist every time Iranians kill an American soldier , we will lose the struggle. &quot; Instead , Gingrich called_for the United States to develop the capacity to strike back directly at the leaders of terrorist movements in a manner that would be so effective it would make them avoid attacks on Americans out of fear for their own lives . How much of what Gingrich believes can be translated into law will depend_on a multitude of factors , some outside his control -- such_as the strategic thinking of the Democratic opposition in the House and Senate , the Democratic President in the White_House and dissenters within his own party . Much will also depend_on his ability to master the skills required of a majority_leader . Critics and even some supporters question whether he can curb his tendency to indulge in distracting rhetorical outbursts . They need not search far for an example . In the closing days of the midterm campaigns , he suggested that the case of the South Carolina mother accused of drowning her two young sons demonstrated the sickness of society and a reason to vote Republican . After he was roundly criticized for the remark , Gingrich claimed that he was quoted out of context . A longtime colleague , former Minnesota Republican Rep . Vin Weber , attributed the lapse to Gingrich ' s zeal in finding evidence to support his ideological approach . &quot; He gets_up and reads the paper in the morning and everything that ' s in it fits into his world_view , &quot; Weber said . &quot; He ' s very sincere , but his mind makes leaps and other people can ' t make the connections he does. &quot; Some analysts contend that even if Gingrich can pass much of his program , his success may do him and his party more harm than good . On the values front , he may be building_up expectations for change that cannot be accomplished by any statute . &quot; He ' s talking_about a series of problems with which national government has never been directly involved and about which the national government finds it very hard to do anything constructive , &quot; said University of North Carolina historian William Leuchtenburg , referring to Gingrich ' s lament about teen-age illiteracy , pregnancy and crime . On the economic front , GOP strategist Phillips contends that the balanced-budget amendment Gingrich is pushing &quot; has the potential to turn_into the Republican equivalent of Clinton ' s health care. &quot; &quot; It ' s going_to sound good when you start_out with it , &quot; Phillips said . But he predicted that support would &quot; drop sharply as soon as people find_out it ' s going_to cut_into their Social_Security or benefits or raise their taxes. &quot; But whatever happens , some who know Gingrich believe that he is flexible enough to handle it . To reach the pinnacle of power in the House he has already traveled a long and circuitous road . This national spokesman for militant conservatism broke_into the politics of what is now his home state in 1968 as a supporter of the presidential candidacy of then-New York Gov . Nelson A . Rockefeller , the chief spokesman for liberal Republicanism and the Republican conservatives most loved to hate . &quot; That was a year when my first choice , Ronald Reagan , wasn ' t running , &quot; Gingrich recalled in an interview . In his first races for Congress , Gingrich was regarded_as a moderate for his positions on race and other issues . Even today , after nearly two decades of his fighting the right ' s fights on Capitol_Hill , some conservatives question his dependability . &quot; I think he ' s more of a political strategist than an ideologue , &quot; said David Keene , chairman of the American Conservative Union . &quot; He is not a consistent conservative in the traditional sense . I think his conservatism is more strategic in orientation . I think he would be far more likely to use government if he thought government could do the right things. &quot; But for all these misgivings , Keene is content to have Gingrich in his present position . &quot; To Gingrich ' s credit , he was the only person who saw this ( GOP victory ) coming . He built for it and was prepared_for it . This election result was really a tribute to two people -- Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton. &quot; Times staff writer Melissa Healy in Washington and researcher Edith Stanley in Atlanta contributed to this story .
