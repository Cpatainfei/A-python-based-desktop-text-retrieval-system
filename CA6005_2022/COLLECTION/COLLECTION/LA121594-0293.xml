   <HEADLINE> PROBE FINDS THAT THE MOON HASN ' T BEEN A QUIET SATELLITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ever since the Apollo astronauts left their final footprints in the moondust 25 years ago , Earth ' s nearest neighbor has been largely neglected for the more exotic lure of planets and star systems far , far away . Now , new findings beamed back from a pint-size military probe named Clementine have served_up a full plate of lunar surprises . The results have yielded the first complete global portrait of the Earth ' s orbiting partner . No longer just a pockmarked face , the moon seems to have had a far more interesting history than previously imagined . Among the more interesting findings are : * Volcanic activity as recent as a_billion years ago . * A wildly variable crust . * The possibility of ice lurking in the shadow of the south_pole . * Confirmation of a crater large enough to span the continental United States from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains . * A fresh-looking crater that may have been created in an impact recorded by sharp-eyed 12th-Century monks . &quot; We had thought that nothing much happened on the moon in the last 3 billion years , &quot; said geophysicist Maria Zuber of Johns Hopkins University and the Goddard Spaceflight Center . &quot; Now we know that we don ' t understand the moon as well as we thought we did. &quot; The findings were discussed at the recent American Geophysical Union meeting and will be published in Friday ' s issue of the journal Science . There is no question that the fate of the Earth and the moon have always been linked , and that our permanent companion cannot be taken_for granted as a mere prop for poets or backdrop for lovers . &quot; We would n ' t be here if it weren ' t for the moon , &quot; said Carle Pieters of Brown University . She explained that scientists now believe that the moon was condensed from the debris of a collision between Earth and a Mars-sized object that stripped off a good_part of the Earth ' s outer mantel and crust . After a_billion years or so of volcanic activity fed by the heat of radioactive_decay , the moon was supposed to have cooled_down rather uniformly , leaving a surface &quot; as smooth as a billiard_ball , &quot; Zuber said . Instead , Clementine ' s 71-day rendezvous with the moon early this year revealed a global topography marked by steep peaks rising 10 miles higher than the lowest valleys . These unexpectedly craggy features may have frozen into place as parts of the moon ' s surface cooled rapidly while others remained hot enough to melt . Bouncing light off the moon in 11 different visible and infrared wavelengths , the spacecraft produced more_than a_million images revealing extreme variations in both the thickness of the crust and the rigidity of the surface . The deepest valley -- the floor of the continent-size South_Pole Aitkin Basin -- is rimmed by the moon ' s highest peaks , suggesting that an enormous object may have crash-landed at an usually low angle , plowing up mountains in its path . &quot; It might be serendipity , &quot; Zuber said . &quot; But it leads us to believe that impacts might have played a far greater role in the moon ' s evolution than we thought. &quot; The basin dominates the dark side of the moon that always has its back turned_to Earth . Nowhere is the fire-and-ice scenario more evident than in the newly mapped South_Pole region . Evidence of relatively recent lava flows in the Schroedinger Basin suggest that the moon was erupting with volcanoes perhaps 2 billion years after it was supposed to have settled into staid middle_age . Closer to the pole , a large depression rotates about the moon ' s axis shadowed from sunlight , making_it a promising site for ice deposits . Ever since scientists found convincing signs of ice at the poles of hell-like Mercury -- &quot; the last place in the solar_system you ' d look_for water , &quot; according to Pieters -- speculation about ice on the moon has been rampant , especially given its practical appeal as a water source for future lunar missions . Even though liquid water does not exist on the moon , ice could accumulate , molecule by molecule , in the cold , shadowed regions at the poles . &quot; It would be like a rock , &quot; said planetary geologist Eugene Shoemaker , whose name became a household word when a comet named for his astronomer wife , himself and a colleague produced fireworks on Jupiter earlier this year . &quot; It ' s too early to say whether it ' s really ice , but the data is tantalizing. &quot; Equally intriguing is the new light shed on a medieval sighting of fireworks on the moon recorded by eight Canterbury monks . On July 18 , 1178 , they wrote ( in Latin , of course ) , &quot; The upper horn of the new_moon seemed to split in two and a flame shot from it . . . ( after which ) the moon . . . writhed . . . and throbbed like a wounded snake. &quot; In 1976 , space scientist J.B. Hartung suggested that this description was exactly what would have been seen had the monks chanced to witness a large impact on the lunar surface . Now Clementine has come a_few steps closer to confirming the monks ' observations . The crater in_question -- called Giordana Bruno -- &quot; is very fresh , &quot; Pieters said . Its soils are just beginning to take_on the reddish hue that accumulates after years of space weathering . The question is , how many years ? &quot; The Clementine data gives new information , but we still don ' t know how long it takes material in the lunar environment to show these signs of_age , &quot; Pieters said . If the answer is millions of years , then the crater could be older than it looks ; but if it ' s hundreds of years -- as_many scientists speculate -- it could be the very impact the monks recorded . Said Pieters : &quot; Either it ' s very young , or we don ' t understand weathering. &quot; The little craft that produced all this new information was supposed to be lost and gone forever by now -- true_to its namesake . Developed to test Star Wars technology , Clementine was supposed to orbit the moon almost as an afterthought ; its primary mission was to home_in on an asteroid and track it &quot; while flying_by really fast , &quot; on its way_out of the solar_system , Pieters said . But somewhere a failure occurred and it never kept its rendezvous with the asteroid . Clementine , Pieters suspects , is still hanging_around Earth orbit . With a price_tag of only $ 100 million and an inception-to-launch time of less than two years , it proved to be exactly the kind of fast , cheap and productive mission that NASA has been hankering for . As for future lunar rendezvous , it is unclear whether another Clementine-type project -- or any number of other possible visits to the moon -- will be approved anytime soon . Said Pieters , who is optimistic that one of four lunar missions now awaiting approval might be launched within three years : &quot; We had fun while it lasted. &quot;</TEXT>
