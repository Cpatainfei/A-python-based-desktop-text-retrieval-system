   <HEADLINE> CONSTRUCTION FAULTS ALLEGED IN BUILDING COLLAPSE ; QUAKE : MATERIALS USED IN NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS ALLEGEDLY DID NOT COMPLY WITH ARCHITECTS ' PLANS , ENGINEER SAYS . BUILDER ' S LAWYER SAYS THE COMPLEX MET CODE REQUIREMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fractured walls and floors of the Northridge Meadows apartment complex reveal alleged &quot; construction defects &quot; that may have contributed to the building ' s collapse during the Jan . 17 earthquake , according to a consultant who says he has reviewed the original building plans . Richard J . Phillips , a former president of the Structural Engineers Assn . of Southern California , said Thursday that he also has reviewed photographs of the building and other documentation gathered by attorneys representing the families of two of the 16 people killed in the tragedy . Phillips said the documentation indicates that some wooden and metal supports in the building were less strong than those specified by the building ' s architects . &quot; Certainly all these things go together with the apparent lack of quality_control in the . . . construction of this building , which ( apparently ) led to its failure , &quot; said Phillips , who was hired by The Times to review the documentation . He heads a city task_force on seismic hazard reduction . A lawyer for Heller Construction of Westlake Village , which built the complex , said that it complied with codes when the structure was built_in the early 1970s . &quot; The question is whether or not it complied with the standards in existence at that time , rather than whether it complied with a certain set of plans , &quot; said Jon Mower , Heller ' s lawyer . A lawsuit has been filed on behalf of the families of Northridge Meadows residents Ann Cerone and Bea Reskin , who were killed in the quake . A March 1 court_order by San Fernando Superior_Court Judge Judith Meisels Ashmann stalled demolition of the 163-unit complex indefinitely so that evidence regarding the collapse could be preserved . At a hearing today in Van Nuys , the attorney for building owners Shashikant and Renuka Jogani , who purchased the apartments about a decade after they were built , will seek another court_order to block or limit public release of the findings and to bar the families ' attorney , Joel B . Castro , from speaking about them . Among the alleged defects that Phillips said have been identified by engineers and other consultants working for the plaintiffs : * Nails used throughout the building were smaller than the nails required by the building plans . * Joist hangers that secured beams to the walls were half the size of those specified in the plans . The plans also called_for nine-inch joist hangers to be secured by nails ; pronged four-inch joist hangers were used instead . * Diagonal strips of 1-by-6-inch wood were used under 1 1 / 2 inches of concrete laid to form the second and third floors , instead of plywood , as called_for in the plans . The 8-by-4-foot sheets of plywood would have provided more resistance to the forces of the earthquake . * Metal pipes supporting apartment units built over parking_spaces were not as strong as specified . The wall of the circular pipe should have been one-half-inch thick , but was only one-quarter of an inch thick . All four of the parking bays at the complex collapsed . Castro said several engineers , architects and other experts are analyzing the findings for his office . They include structural engineers from Conrad Associates of Van Nuys , architects from O ' Leary Terrasawa Partners of Los Angeles , and Robert Powell , a leading expert on wood technology . Mower said none of the defects suggested by Castro ' s consultants have been found by a structural engineer retained by that firm . He declined to name the engineer . &quot; We have looked_at it and we have not identified problems with either the plans or the construction , &quot; said Keith Koeller , another attorney representing Heller . Koeller said that building plans routinely change as construction progresses , and he is trying to reconstruct the building history in detail . Northridge Meadows was built before building_codes were tightened after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake . Officials have said the construction met codes in_force at the time . The engineering study , undertaken as part of a lawsuit seeking damages for the deaths in the apartment , has assessed only whether builders matched the design of the architect , not whether building_codes were followed , Phillips said . Inspection records of the complex have been destroyed in a routine purge of old records , according to Ron Nelson , records management coordinator for the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety . Northridge Meadows did not appear to be constructed any differently from many other buildings of its era , and similar construction problems were detected in other buildings after the quake , Phillips said . Shortcuts , he said , are commonplace in apartment construction -- and the inspections and quality_controls for high-rises and other large commercial structures are more thorough than those applied to most apartment_building construction . Phillips said that further examinations of the pancaked first_floor and foundation of the Northridge Meadows Apartments are likely to reveal other clues to the three-story structure ' s collapse . But these areas can not be examined until the top two floors are dismantled and removed during a costly controlled demolition . Within days of the quake , engineers and officials with the city ' s Building and Safety department said the lack of plywood-reinforced shear walls probably played a role in the collapse . The plywood reinforcements were not required in 1970 , when the building plans were approved . In addition to the Joganis , The suit names Heller and his construction company ; architect Morris Brown , and structural engineer Woodward Tom . Alleged Defects at Northridge Meadows * The earthquake-triggerd collapse of the apartment_building killed 16 people . Lawyers working for relatives of two fo the victims have allegedly found evidence of construction defects that may have contributed to the building ' s collapse . * Support pipes were too thin * The walls of the hollow , 4-inch pipe columns supporting units above parking garages were 1 / 4 inch thick instead of 1 / 2 inch , as architect ' s plans specified . * Weaker nails substituted * The &quot; sinker &quot; nails they used throughout the building were weaker than the &quot; common &quot; nails called_for . The ones used were shorter and thinner . * Incorrect joist hangers used * Joist hangers that secured vertical weight-bearing wooden beams to the walls were half the size of the joists called_for in the plans . The hangers were supposed to be secured by nails , but inspectors found some of them secured only by clamps . * Floors supported insufficiently * Diagonal strips of 1-by-6-inch wood were used under the concrete laid to form the floors , instead of plywood . The 4-by 8 foot sheets of plywood would have been stronger and more able to sustain the movement caused by the quake . Source : Richard J . Phillips , structural engineer</TEXT>
