   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / DANIEL SCHORR : THE PRESIDENT DIDN ' T REALLY MEAN THAT ; SOMETIMES MISSTATEMENTS ARE MORE THAN MERE GAFFES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The President misspoke. &quot; The official said it in a hushed tone as though committing some form of blasphemy , and immediately added that he should probably not be saying this , and that it was_on very deep background . He was trying to explain how it was that on Nov . 7 , President Clinton had said , &quot; North_Korea cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb , &quot; whereas now the Administration was pursuing a compromise that might &quot; grandfather &quot; any bomb that North_Korea already had . What the President had meant to say , my source volunteered , was that North_Korea would not be allowed to become &quot; a nuclear power. &quot; &quot; The President misspoke &quot; is a tricky way_out of an apparent contradiction , because the credibility of government rests_on the tacit assumption that the President can say no wrong . Vice_presidents can misspeak , and that can be amusing , as when Dan Quayle , trying to quote the motto of the United Negro College Fund , said , &quot; What a waste it is to lose one ' s mind. &quot; Or when Al Gore , delivering a foreign-policy speech in Milwaukee , said that America ' s ethnic melting_pot shows that America is &quot; E pluribus unum -- out of one many. &quot; ( It ' s the other way around , of course. ) But with the President , the acknowledgment of &quot; misspeaking &quot; suggests that either he cannot talk straight or that he doesn ' t understand his Administration ' s policies . Once in 1953 , President Eisenhower made a remark so egregiously out of line with known policy that James ( Scotty ) Reston of the New York Times , leaving the news_conference with me , suggested that the only way_out for Press Secretary James Hagerty was to say that &quot; President Eisenhower does not necessarily speak_for this Administration. &quot; Presidents sometimes do misspeak : The words that come_out of their mouths are not the words they intended to utter . ( Let ' s leave Freud out of this , shall we ? ) President Bush was particularly prone to verbal accidents . Attacking Gov . Michael Dukakis on the Pledge of Allegiance during the 1988 campaign , Bush himself misquoted it , saying , &quot; One nation under God with freedom and justice for all. &quot; ( Spokeswoman Sheila Tate said he was &quot; paraphrasing. &quot; ) Bush also said , &quot; I hope I stand_for anti-bigotry , anti-Semitism , anti-racism. &quot; President Reagan clearly misspoke in 1986 when , at a rally for a Republican Senate candidate in Nevada , he said Democratic voters had found &quot; they can no longer follow the leadership of the Republican_Party , which has taken them down a course that leads to disaster. &quot; But , more often in the case of Reagan , &quot; misspeaking &quot; appeared to be a matter of confusion about facts and policies . In August , 1984 , he said that submarine-launched missiles were &quot; less destabilizing &quot; than land-based missiles because &quot; they could be called back. &quot; ( They can ' t be. ) Earlier the same year , Reagan said , contrary to stated Administration policy , that Lebanon involved American &quot; vital interests. &quot; ( &quot; Less than precise , &quot; explained an anonymous official. ) Ranking as a historic misstatement was the Reagan proposal to Mikhail Gorbachev at the Reykjavik summit in 1986 for total elimination of nuclear_weapons . ( Just an &quot; ultimate goal , &quot; explained spokesman Larry Speakes , reluctant to say that the President not only misspoke , but also misperceived the nuclear stalemate. ) When ousted Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos complained of having been betrayed by being flown to Guam on an American_plane after being promised he would be transported to a place elsewhere in the Philippines , Reagan blandly countered , &quot; I think maybe he was misinformed . It happens to every president. &quot; In the first year of the whiz-kid Clinton_Administration , there has been relatively little need to drag_out the dread word &quot; misspoke. &quot; More common is being &quot; misunderstood &quot; or &quot; misinterpreted , &quot; as when Strobe Talbott , after the Russian election in December , said there would be &quot; less shock and more therapy , &quot; suggesting an easing of pressure on economic reform . But something more was involved when Clinton introduced the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , as one whose &quot; family fled in a cattle_car westward ( from Poland ) to Germany in front of the Soviet advance. &quot; In fact , the general ' s father had been a major in the Nazi Waffen SS , enjoying a privileged life in Warsaw . ( &quot; Irrelevant , &quot; said press secretary Dee Dee Myers , declining to say the President misspoke from a misleading biography. ) So when we are told &quot; the President misspoke , &quot; we are not sure if it was a twisted tongue , a twisted fact or a changed policy . But however it happens , it can sometimes put a serious misspoke in the President ' s wheels .</TEXT>
