   <HEADLINE> IT ' S ZANY AND ACES WITH FANS ; MOVIES : ' ACE VENTURA ' WITH JIM CARREY HAS TAKEN IN $ 24.6 MILLION , AND IS STILL GOING STRONG .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steven Spielberg has made the most important film of his lifetime , Tom Hanks has taken_on the most important role of his career , and Robin Williams makes a great housekeeper . So what ' s a cowlicked finder of lost dolphins doing at the top of the box-office tallies two weeks in a row ? Since its release Feb . 4 , the manically lowbrow comedy &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective &quot; has taken_in $ 24.6 million , and doesn ' t show any sign of slowing_down . The Morgan Creek film , directed by first-timer Tom Shadyac , has made an instant movie_star out of comedian Jim Carrey , formerly best known for characters like Fire_Marshal Bill on Fox-TV ' s &quot; In Living Color. &quot; &quot; I knew this movie was going_to either be something that people really went_for , or it was going_to ruin me completely , &quot; Carrey said . &quot; From the beginning of my involvement , I said that the character had to be rock ' n ' roll . He had to be the . 007 of pet detectives . I wanted to be unstoppably ridiculous , and they let me go wild. &quot; A wild , ridiculous Carrey was exactly what Morgan Creek hoped for when the project was green-lighted . With past releases like &quot; Dead_Ringers , &quot; &quot; Young Guns &quot; and &quot; Robin_Hood : Prince of Thieves , &quot; the company has covered plenty of stylistic territory , though recent releases like &quot; True Romance , &quot; &quot; The Crush &quot; and &quot; Young Guns II &quot; have been less than stellar at the box_office . This time_out , Chairman and CEO James G . Robinson was_after a broad comedy . &quot; This is the movie we set_out to make , &quot; he says . &quot; I thought from the beginning that it would be a mistake to center a film on a great comedian like Jim Carrey and not let him cut loose. &quot; &quot; For me it was a complete ego_trip to become Ace , &quot; says Carrey . &quot; He ' s got all_the fast , funny answers to every situation . He can fight . He can make_love . He ' s the best . He ' s completely happy with his lot in life and just wants to keep his pets well-fed. &quot; Audiences are responding enthusiastically to Carrey ' s frenzied antics , whether he ' s violently delivering a UPS package , catching bullets in his teeth or running football patterns in a tutu . The film , which also stars Sean Young , Courteney Cox , rapper Tone Loc and Miami Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino , is especially a hit with the 10- to 20-year-old age_group it was originally targeted for . Box-office grosses indicate that many fans are going_back to see the film again . &quot; It ' s wonderful and surprising to be at No . 1 , because we ' re sort of an underdog film , &quot; says director Shadyac , 33 , previously notable for being the youngest gag writer ever to work for Bob Hope . &quot; But we were laughing so hard when we made this , we knew that if we managed to capture the fun and the spirit of Jim Carrey , we had a chance to put_out a very successful movie. &quot; Shadyac , who won the directing job by pitching a rewrite of the script to Robinson , says that Carrey ' s ability to produce laughs occasionally became a problem during production . &quot; The most difficult thing about working with Jim was trying to keep the cast and crew from laughing during takes . We had to send Jim off the set_in order to film Courteney ' s close-up lines because she couldn ' t keep a straight_face with him standing there . We had to cut the movie around the shots where actors started cracking up. &quot; Not many critics have been charmed by Ace Ventura ' s exploits , and several have charged that the film ' s humor is mean-spirited , needlessly raunchy and homophobic . Despite the reviews , work offers have been piling_up at Shadyac ' s office . &quot; I didn ' t imagine that a completely crazy comedy like this would be the kind of film I ' d make my debut with , but now that it ' s happened , I ' m thrilled , &quot; he says . &quot; One of the top agents in town called us and said he laughed all_the way through the movie and was terribly embarrassed by that . that ' s a compliment as far as I ' m concerned . I know comedy directors are rare and prized , and I hope I can help fill that void for a_couple_of movies . &quot; There ' s no way a film like ' Ace Ventura ' can appeal_to everybody , but it ' s amazing to see how many people love it . Jim Robinson said , right before we began shooting this film , ' Make a film that nobody my age gets. ' &quot; Carrey was involved in rewriting the script , and was allowed a great_deal of room to improvise on set . He says he frequently pursued comedic tangents that he knew would not appeal_to everyone ' s tastes . &quot; I wanted to keep the action unreal and over the top . When it came time to do my reaction to kissing a man , I wanted it to be the biggest , most obnoxious , homophobic reaction ever recorded . It ' s so ridiculous it can ' t be taken seriously -- even though it guarantees that somebody ' s going_to be offended. &quot; Those deeply offended by &quot; Ace Ventura ' s &quot; success may_not have to wait long to be rankled again . Robinson decided that &quot; Ace &quot; was worth a sequel before the first film was even completed , and both Shadyac and Carrey are excited about having another go at the character . Joining the writing team for &quot; Ace II &quot; will be Steve Oederkerk , who worked with Carrey as a writer on &quot; In Living Color &quot; and served as a creative consultant this film . &quot; This film has shown us in a flash that there ' s a huge audience for Jim Carrey ' s comedy , &quot; says Oederkerk , &quot; and I think that surprised everybody , including Jim Carrey. &quot; Robinson at least has no pretensions about the artistic value of his film . &quot; Look , I sincerely hope ' Schindler ' s List ' cleans_up at the Oscars . ' Ace Ventura ' is a no-brainer . Buy yourself a tub of popcorn , sit_back , and just give it up . Relax . There are no messages here and we ' re not trying to educate anybody . It ' s just an hour and a half to kick_back and laugh. &quot;</TEXT>
