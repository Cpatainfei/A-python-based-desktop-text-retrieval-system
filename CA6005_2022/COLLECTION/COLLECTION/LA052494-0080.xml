   <HEADLINE> THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT ; AMID ' HUMAN ' ERRORS , PLAYOFF OFFICIATING DEEMED BETTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Think the officiating in the playoffs isn ' t as_good_as it should be ? &quot; Some nights , I ' d agree wholeheartedly , &quot; said Bryan Lewis , the NHL ' s director of officiating . But most of the time , he believes the NHL has identified its best referees and linesmen and they ' re doing the best possible job of making quick decisions under intense pressure . &quot; That doesn ' t mean they ' re not going_to make errors , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; There ' s certainly human judgment involved . I was at a game ( last week ) in Toronto and there were certain things I wish hadn ' t happened . There was a game Kerry ( Fraser ) did_in New York that I could pick_out a_couple_of things I didn ' t like , but in the context of the entire game , you understand it. &quot; Referees and linesmen are monitored during the season and rated at season ' s end . The ratings aren ' t revealed to the officials . The NHL chooses playoff officials on merit , as does the NBA . Postseason baseball umpiring assignments are determined on merit but with restrictions , such_as a minimum amount of experience , and no umpire can work both the playoffs and World_Series . The officials ' contingent starts at 11 referees and 19 linesmen . It ' s cut_to eight referees and 10 linesmen in the quarterfinals , six referees and eight linesmen in the semifinals and three referees and four linesmen in the finals . Eliminations are based on judgments by Lewis and series supervisors , who include former referees Dave Newell and Wally Harris . The system isn ' t perfect . Andy van Hellemond , long rated among the top referees , has ignored a lot of restraining fouls and has allowed several games to get_out of hand . He also missed Pavel Bure ' s brutal elbowing of Shane Churla . Dan Marouelli has been behind plays and Terry Gregson has been so-so , although both New Jersey Coach Jacques Lemaire and the Rangers ' Mike Keenan complained about him last week . Lewis would n ' t comment on specific officials , but said he is satisfied with the overall quality of their work . &quot; In terms of complaints and issues , we haven ' t had anywhere near this year what we had last year , &quot; he said . &quot; Our ability to pick_apart what officials are doing is greater because of technology , and there ' s not a damn thing wrong with that . If the right team wins and the officials have made minimal errors , then they ' ve done their job , and I firmly believe we are. &quot; NICK KNACK In the pantheon of King general_managers , Nick Beverley ranks in the middle of the pack . He wasn ' t as bad as Larry Regan , who traded the draft picks that became Reg Leach , Steve Shutt , Pierre Mondou and Mario Tremblay . And he wasn ' t as bad as George Maguire , who gave_up the first-round pick Boston used to draft Ray Bourque and the first-rounder Buffalo used for Phil Housley . But he wasn ' t as_good_as Rogie Vachon , who got Kelly Hrudey from the New York Islanders , Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato from the Rangers , Mike Donnelly from Buffalo for Mikko Makela , and Paul Coffey from Pittsburgh . Beverley ' s peers lined_up behind him when he and Coach Barry Melrose clashed over personnel moves . &quot; He ' s a good hockey man , &quot; they said , a euphemism meaning he ' s a member of the old-boys ' club and Melrose is a brash , young pup . Melrose was out of line in that case , but Beverley was no genius . Still , he worked under difficult circumstances . The Kings ' front-office setup meant decisions had to be approved by Beverley , club President Roy Mlakar , Melrose and Vachon . Too many voices , too_little decisiveness . As for those who suggest Melrose should have become general_manager , we say no . He showed no great eye for talent when he asked Beverley to get him Gary Shuchuk , Phil Crowe and Marc Potvin , and his affinity for Doug Houda is mystifying . Melrose was summoned to Los Angeles last week to meet with club officials , who told him his coaching_job is safe -- for now . MELROSE AT THE MIKE As ESPN ' s studio analyst , Melrose has learned much about the game -- including how easy it is to coach when you ' ve got replays and assorted camera_angles . &quot; I ' ve watched a lot of hockey and really gotten_to watch players closely , &quot; he said . &quot; I know the NHL better than I ever knew it before . I ' m not second-guessing ( other coaches ) , more watching what they do . Sometimes I say , ' Geez , I might have done that differently. ' It ' s been hard , seeing the excitement , knowing what ' s going_on , not being there after being there last year . . . . &quot; What ( doing commentary ) has done is reinforce what I believe should be done with our team . The teams left are the big teams with physical guys who can skate and grind and make the big play when they need to. &quot; ONE IN SEVERAL MILLION Mike Barnett , who represents top-rated draft prospect Radek Bonk , denied reports the Czech teen-ager is seeking a five-year , $ 20-million deal . Last year ' s top pick , Alexandre Daigle , got $ 12.5 million over five years from Ottawa . &quot; There haven ' t been any numbers discussed with anyone , &quot; Barnett said . &quot; Most teams are playing things close to the vest . And we did not sit_down and have an absolute , predetermined dollar amount and number of years. &quot; BAFFLING BRUINS Here ' s a puzzler : Boston General_Manager Harry Sinden is considering John Ferguson to fill the vacancy left when Mike Milbury resigned as assistant general_manager . Sinden had planned to retire after next season and give most of his responsibilities to a younger_man . At 55 , Ferguson doesn ' t quite fit that bill . Ferguson , formerly general_manager of the Rangers and the Winnipeg Jets , is Ottawa ' s director of player personnel . He and Sinden have been cronies since the 1972 &quot; Super Series &quot; against the Soviets . SLAP SHOTS Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean takes a 135-minute 23-second shutout streak into tonight ' s potential clincher against Toronto . The Canucks ' speedy forwards have also played key roles in building a 3-1 series lead . Bure , who has a 14-game point-scoring streak , has been nearly unstoppable , and left wing Geoff Courtnall and center Cliff Ronning are creating havoc . . . . When Ranger Coach Keenan benched Brian Leetch , Brian Noonan and Craig MacTavish Saturday , he was trying to cover_up shoulder injuries suffered by Leetch and MacTavish and Noonan ' s knee injury . Mark Messier is slowed by rib and hip problems . Ron Corey of Montreal will probably succeed Bruce McNall as chairman_of_the_Board of Governors , but Calgary co-owner Harley Hotchkiss is also a strong candidate . . . . Jay Leach , coach of the Flyers ' American Hockey_League farm_team , is favored to replace Terry Simpson in Philadelphia . Whaler players didn ' t respect 32-year-old Coach Pierre McGuire . Firing him &quot; was the best thing that could have happened , &quot; winger Pat Verbeek said . . . . The Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey_League won the Memorial Cup ( Canadian junior championship ) with a 5-3 victory Sunday over Laval of the Quebec League . Kamloops center Darcy Tucker , a 1993 Montreal draft pick , was the tournament ' s most_valuable_player .</TEXT>
