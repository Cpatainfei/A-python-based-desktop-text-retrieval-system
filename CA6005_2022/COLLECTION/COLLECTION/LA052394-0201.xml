   <HEADLINE> COMMITMENTS ; ALL THE RAGE ; REMEMBER WHEN YOU TIED YOUR SISTER UP ? TOLD YOUR BROTHER YOU ' D HATE HIM FOREVER ? THE STRESS OF BEING AN ADULT CAN REIGNITE THOSE CHILDHOOD FEELINGS OF HURT AND ANGER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Parents are always telling their kids to get_along_with one another . But increasingly , therapists say , the adults need someone to do the same for them . Call it sib strain -- when juvenile jealousies , childhood squabbles or long-forgotten insults -- can erupt into disa greements , verbal battles or even all-out hostility between adult siblings . &quot; People are realizing that the sibling relationship is important , especially in this crazy society . I deal with it every day with my patients , &quot; said Barbara Cadow , a USC clinical_psychologist with a private practice in Westwood . Therapists say the seeds of sibling stress are sown_in childhood when parents model ineffective communication styles or allow rivalries to go unchecked . Almost without exception , those who suffer from sibling feuds have grown_up in families in which successive generations have failed to learn how to talk to each other and listen , Cadow said . The result , sometimes long after everyone is officially grown_up , is angry siblings . The problem is usually triggered by stress -- a wedding , a holiday , an illness , a funeral or a will . &quot; People are raw emotionally and then the issues come_out , &quot; said Cadow , who recently counseled two sisters wrangling over a will . Sibling therapy is a lot like marriage_counseling -- except both patients have the same parents , Cadow said . In the case of the two sisters , both had long felt deprived of love , attention and reinforcement , and learned that they were holding each other responsible . &quot; It worked_out , in a very emotional session . They both realized that neither of them had gotten what they felt they needed , &quot; Cadow said . And they stopped fighting over the will . A 73-year-old Northridge woman who asked to remain anonymous said she has still not resolved completely the tension she feels with her three siblings . &quot; I grew_up and was put_in a little category ; I had the label of being bright , and my younger sister had the label of being pretty , with personality , dimples and all that , &quot; she said . Ten years ago , at the wedding_reception for her second marriage , one of her brothers turned_to her and said he had never noticed that she was so beautiful . She bristled . &quot; I told him , right then , that I didn ' t think any of them had ever looked_at me , &quot; she said . &quot; He was shocked. &quot; Sometimes , Westwood-based psychologist Arlen Ring said , one of the kids gets the feeling the other sibling ' s role came easier . &quot; One sibling may have been the rebel and the other , a good little_girl . Neither appreciates the price the other had to pay_for refuge , &quot; he said . He sees a growing number of people seeking sibling-related therapy . Usually , some occasion becomes a flash_point and a fight ensues . &quot; For some , it ' s like a bomb waiting to go_off , &quot; he said . Money is a big issue around which things break , as are celebrations . In many cases , Ring said , the siblings discover that they grew_up in a dysfunctional family in which the parents had so many unmet needs that they were not_able to provide a forum for the family to communicate . Rather than feeling like everyone was working together and on the same side , children in such situations may have grown_up seeing each other as players who would move against each other if given an opening . &quot; We all model the kind of behaviors we ' ve primarily been exposed to , &quot; said Barry Slone , a clinical_psychologist with offices in Orange and Laguna Hills . &quot; If you assume the parental relationship is one of the more powerful educational experiences , I don ' t think it ' s a stretch to draw the conclusion that if you grew_up in a family where people could express their point_of_view , negotiate and constructively solve problems , you ' re going to have a better relationship with your sibling. &quot; * David Paster , an Encino psychologist , uses the acronym RAGE -- rivalry , anger , greed and envy -- to explain the sibling stress he sees among the adults he treats . He says the combination of those four emotions creates the tension that is increasingly being experienced among grown siblings . It ' s common , Paster said , for adult siblings to remember something said decades ago . One client recently told his brother that he cannot forget that , at 14 , he told him that he would hate him for the rest of his life . The issues , Paster said , are often not even remembered by the other sibling or may be recalled very differently . Sometimes memory is selective . One woman clearly remembers her brother tying her to a piano bench with a jump_rope when she was 8 . What she does not recall is why he did_it . Issues can spring_up deep into adulthood . Cheryl Heitman , a family therapist in Agoura , said she often sees sibs who have gotten_along well , even into their 30s and 40s , until some problem opens an old , even unremembered , rift . &quot; You ' re reacting from old feelings , feelings from when you were 5 , and then you revert to those deep , familiar behavior patterns , &quot; she said . Heitman said she also has counseled adults who found that issues with their siblings were getting_worse as they all aged , without any particular event or crisis as a cause . &quot; A lot of people , as they get older , instead of their issues getting resolved , it gets_worse . We all have expectations of how we ought to be treated and we have these expectations even more for family . So it ' s very easy to be left_out , disappointed or frustrated . And most families don ' t make_it a habit to talk_about the dynamics of their relationships , &quot; Heitman said . Sometimes the precipitating factor is a sibling ' s spouse . Cadow said one patient she has counseled was extremely close to her brother but saw the relationship slide after he got_married . &quot; The wife tried to keep the brother away from his sister ; she practiced phone sabotage , &quot; Cadow said . Why ? &quot; It ' s hardly ever communicated in these situations so it ' s hard to know what it ' s about , &quot; she said . * Making_up isn ' t easy . Cadow remembered one patient who had problems with all his siblings but carefully selected the one with whom he was closest . He planned out what he would say , how he would begin the conversation and phoned . The brother hung_up on him . &quot; You need to be prepared_for an overture to fail , &quot; Cadow said . The best bet , she advised , is for troubled sibs to try to talk in a neutral , public place -- such_as a restaurant -- where inhibitions may make the discussion more calm and controlled . Cadow suggests that sibs start by reminiscing -- sharing silly stories in an effort to regain common_ground . Keep it low-key , go slowly , don ' t blame and don ' t go_in with huge expectations . &quot; Be happy if you can meet and not fight , &quot; she said . Psychologists say just having children of_their_own sometimes spurs siblings to seek therapy . Watching the kids interact can resurrect long-buried , conflicting feelings of both fun and frustration , and stimulate a desire for the new generation of children to do_better . How can parents nip sib strain in the bud ? Paster said parents should be careful not to assume that sibling rage is normal . &quot; It ' s not , &quot; he said . &quot; Kids should be encouraged to talk_about their feelings with each other and to treat each other well. &quot; Slone said parents should feel comfortable stepping into the situation when they see their children at each other ' s throats . The theory that the grown-ups should let the kids work it out themselves usually does not work , he said . &quot; Adults can help the siblings calm_down , &quot; he said , &quot; and then assist them in expressing why they are fighting and what they want. &quot;</TEXT>
