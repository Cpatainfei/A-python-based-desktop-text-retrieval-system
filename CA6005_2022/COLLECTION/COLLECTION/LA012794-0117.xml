   <HEADLINE> NO DEFENSE AGAINST BLUSTER ; BUT U.S. PATRIOT MISSILES MIGHT HELP SEOUL WITH ANY INCOMING SCUDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One day after CIA Director R . James Woolsey alerted Congress that North_Korea ' s leaders were bringing their country to &quot; a heightened state of military readiness , &quot; the Clinton_Administration said it is considering sending Patriot missiles to help defend South_Korea and the 36 # 000 U.S. troops stationed there . That would be a prudent move , and the sooner accomplished the better . The Patriot probably would be positioned to defend air fields and ports , facilities whose protection is vital in the event of a new conflict on the Korean_peninsula . Pyongyang can be counted_on to charge that this modest defensive augmentation is a deliberate provocation . It isn ' t . The Patriot is an air_defense weapon , designed to knock_out incoming missiles . It is no threat to North_Korea ' s territory , only to any aggressive instincts . The world was introduced to the Patriot two years ago when it was sent to defend Israel and Saudi_Arabia against Scud missile attacks from Iraq . After-battle analyses determined that the Patriot , which had not been designed to defend population centers , did not perform as well as was initially claimed . Since then it has been improved . While not foolproof -- no weapon is -- it is thought to be more effective now in destroying or deflecting incoming missiles . North_Korea has plenty of missiles , including its own version of the Scud . The CIA believes it also has one or two crude nuclear devices , and Pyongyang seems hellbent on making more . This is what the tensions with Kim Il Sung ' s Stalinist regime are all about . Pyongyang refuses to permit the international inspection of its nuclear sites that the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty requires . Instead it issues dark threats about how it might react if efforts were made to force its compliance with the treaty . In these circumstances the United States and its South_Korean ally are wise_to look_to their defenses . Pyongyang likes to bluster . It ' s also capable of sudden and erratic behavior . Sending_in the Patriots won ' t deflate the bluster , but it could usefully affect the actions North_Korea might be weighing .</TEXT>
