   <HEADLINE> IN LONELY EUREKA , GOLD BUT NO GLITTER ; NEVADA : MINING AND RANCHING OFFER A TOUGH LIFE , BUT RESIDENTS TREASURE TOWN ' S OLD-TIME VIRTUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Plunk in the middle of a state that is reeling from an assault by outsiders , the_sublime strength and spirit of Nevada is preserved and nurtured here , a proud little town of several hundred residents , straddling the loneliest highway in America . The nearest McDonald ' s and K mart are 120 miles away in Elko , and it ' s a 77-mile drive to the nearest lawyer , doctor or pharmacy , in Ely . For major hospitalization , Eureka ' s residents trek to Reno , 240 miles to the west , or Salt_Lake_City , 320 miles to the east . But the gold is here , and cattle and alfalfa , and enough work for everyone who ' s willing to put_on a pair of heavy gloves . People such_as 63-year-old Witz Bailey , ranching 17 hours a day in the same treeless valley where his grandfather settled in the 1860s . And 42-year-old Greg Tibbs , drilling 12 hours a night for gold in the same hills where silver and lead were mined 120 years ago . Welcome to Eureka , where the population waffles between 500 and 800 , depending_on the latest gold-mining operation , where dogs walk down the middle of Main_Street , where the biggest social_event in town is the Christmas dinner_party at the 1880 opera_house , and where the 1879 courthouse -- with its original pressed-tin ceiling -- is maintained not as some tourist trap but because it ' s the only courtroom in the county . Along the same street where 125 saloons and a handful of brothels once served a boom_town of 9 # 000 dreamers and diggers , drunks and die-hards , today ' s laborers still lubricate their bodies with too many beers and whiskeys , and fetch rides home from the local sheriff to their modern-day work_camps -- mobile_home parks and RV lots . This is the heart of the &quot; Other Nevada , &quot; a phrase coined by Nevada author Robert Laxalt to describe the immense expanse of land where the sparse population is rough and tumble and has no use for the glitz and ritz of teeming Las Vegas and Reno . Although Eureka is part of the fastest-growing state in the nation -- its environment , its economy , its very essence in a tumult created mainly by transplanted Californians -- the town stands as testimony to the old pioneering spirit . It remains untouched by the influx of outsiders seeking to redefine the state ' s storied lifestyle . Old Nevada values are sanctified here and you ' d best not tinker with them . Bud Lloyd , who was the local district_attorney before retiring 24 years ago , says : &quot; We ' re the Nevada that the casinos have passed_up . We ' re the Nevada of mining , and of people caring_for each other instead of inflicting themselves on one another. &quot; Eureka ' s resistance to outside influences bodes well for the state . The real Nevada , Laxalt says , is &quot; disappearing so darn fast . But Eureka , it ' s still pure , and if you lose_it , you ' ve lost the identity of Nevada. &quot; State Archivist Guy Rocha embraces a romantic view of Eureka : &quot; Eureka captures the symbol of individualism and freedom , a closeness to the land , a sense of what Nevada was -- but isn ' t much , anymore . . . . It ' s a sanctuary against this swell of humanity that is spilling_over into Nevada and consuming it . &quot; But Eureka is stable . It ' s the most representative of the ' Other Nevada , ' the places off the beaten path. &quot; For many , Eureka is too far off the beaten path , and so it has established its own population equilibrium . Although the state ' s population has increased 50 % over the last decade , no one anticipates waves of Californians reaching here . There ' s little reason . &quot; Probably the biggest complaint we have in town is that we can ' t seem to keep a doctor here , &quot; said Eureka native Leroy Etchetaray , a county commissioner . &quot; They ' ll come , but their wives can ' t seem to handle it , so they leave. &quot; Even the high_school principal drives every_other weekend to Reno -- to visit his wife , who does not want to live here . Living_in Eureka was a challenge from the start . Its first residents were five prospectors who discovered silver in 1864 . Within six years , more_than 1 # 000 mining claims peppered the land , but the early mountain_men were frustrated in extracting the treasure , stubbornly encased in junk ore . Pressed to innovation , mining_companies engineered revolutionary smelters with an insatiable appetite for charcoal to fire giant furnaces , melting the raw ore and refining the silver and lead . By 1879 -- as Eureka ' s population swelled to 9 # 000 -- the town ' s 16 smelters were consuming 175 # 000 pounds of charcoal a day ; within 50 miles of Eureka , elevation 6 # 500 feet , the_hills were scalped of all pinyon pine , dwarf cedar and mountain mahogany . A mineralogist noted at the time that &quot; heavy black clouds of dense smoke from the furnaces , heavily laden and strongly scented with the fumes of lead , arsenic and other volatile elements of the ores , are constantly rolling_over the town , depositing soot , scales and black dust , so that it resembles very much one of the manufacturing towns in the coal regions of Pennsylvania. &quot; Eureka became known as the &quot; Pittsburgh of the West. &quot; Besides foul air , life ' s miseries were compounded by harsh winters , the paucity of fresh_food , fires and floods . But the townsfolk were a hardy stock -- miners from Europe , the_British Isles and Mexico , as well as 2 # 000 Chinese who worked as domestics or laying train track . But by 1890 , the price of silver had fallen , new boom_towns were forming elsewhere in Nevada , and the local hills were considered depleted -- a mistaken notion that was righted only in the past 30 years . Eureka ' s population plummeted to close to 1 # 000 at the turn_of_the_century , but the town never was given to ghosts . For the next six decades , the town sustained itself as a farming community ; Basque sheepherders worked the pastureland , and cattle ranching became the primary commerce . Occasional gold strikes created spurts of activity . By the mid-1960s , new gold extracting technology sparked a resurgence of mining in the northern end of Eureka County , 80 miles away . Mining_companies found it financially feasible to chemically leach microscopic bits of gold from the earth . It was profitable -- even if the earth yielded only 0.1 ounces or less of gold per ton of mined ore -- and the newest boom was_on . The gold breathed new life into Eureka . Today , two of the largest gold-mining operations in the United States are in northern Eureka County ; although the miners live_in Elko , the state ' s newest boom_town , which is closer , and spend their payroll_checks there , it is Eureka County that is reaping the easy_money . This year , Eureka County will get $ 3.1 million in gold tax_revenue -- paltry compared to the more_than $ 1.5 billion in gold that is mined annually , but still a windfall for a county with a population of about 2 # 200 residents spread_out over an area twice the size of Delaware . Indeed , of county government_revenues of about $ 13 million , nearly half is generated by the gold mining industry , through gold tax , property_tax and sales tax . So the county is flush with money ; it spent more_than $ 2 million to renovate the old opera_house , enclosed the community pool , improved roads and water_systems , built an airstrip , developed a fairgrounds , installed a 911 emergency phone_system , modernized the Sheriff ' s Department and is considering a nine-hole golf_course . On top of all that , the county has $ 14 million in cash reserves -- an amount that exceeds its annual budget . The two Eureka schools have benefited from the gold bonanza , too . Eureka County High_School teachers are the best paid in the state , with salaries ranging from $ 32 # 500 to $ 58 # 000 ; each year , the school picks_up the $ 25 # 000 tab for sending the junior_class -- about 20 students -- to Washington for a week , and the $ 15 # 000 tab for sending the Future Farmers of America club -- about 20 members -- to the national FFA convention in Kansas City . The 130 students in grades seven through 12 share 52 IBM computers that are linked to the Internet ; the school ' s wrestling and baseball_teams are the state champions . With enviable teacher-student ratios , scholarship excels . Two years ago , each of the 18 seniors went_to a four-year college ; last year , 25 of the graduates went_to college , one went_to the Naval Academy at Annapolis , and the other two joined the military . This month , the town is completing a new , $ 4-million grade_school for its 120 youngsters -- paid_for in cash . Such luxury stands_in stark contrast to the situation 250 miles south in school-starved Las Vegas , where voters are being asked to approve $ 905 million in bonds to build 110 new campuses . &quot; We ' re all about gold , &quot; said Michael Rebaleati , the county auditor , sitting in an office adorned with hunting prints . &quot; But we ' re very aware that gold is cyclical . It ' s on our minds every day. &quot; He regularly checks the price of gold on the world market to forecast the town ' s future . &quot; We have to be careful what we build because we ' re going to have to maintain it , and we know that things can go bust . In fact , they absolutely will go bust , sooner or later. &quot; Indeed , Atlas Mining Co . of Denver is reassessing its current open-pit gold mining operation just outside Eureka and has laid_off some of its 85 workers . But Homestake Mining Co . of San Francisco has sunk exploratory drills on the town ' s edge and has hinted strongly that there is enough microscopic gold in its hills -- previously depleted of silver and lead -- to warrant a full-scale mining operation in a_few years . Still , Vera Beaumann is helping prepare the town for a no-gold future . As director of the town ' s economic development commission , she wants to recruit a large-scale dairy operation to Eureka . &quot; We ' re already sending our hay to California dairies , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' d like to just bring California ' s dairies here , &quot; she said . In fact , any business would be welcomed here ; given Eureka ' s minimalist attitude toward government , there are no county zoning laws , so anything goes . Beaumann also wants to promote Eureka more aggressively as a tourist destination , even though it lacks a national chain motel . &quot; Our convention center ( the opera_house ) can accommodate meetings of up_to 250 or 300 people , &quot; she said , &quot; but we ' ve got no place for them to spend the night. &quot; Eureka ' s visitors eschew the big Reno-to-Salt-Lake-City interstate to the north in favor of the two-lane U.S. 50 as it cuts_across central Nevada ' s open rangeland . The expanse offers glimpses of deer and wild_horses , but is free_of billboards . Given the paucity of services , the highway was christened &quot; the Loneliest Road in America &quot; in a 1986 Life magazine photo spread . It advised motorists to exercise &quot; survival skills. &quot; But the travelers are rewarded : state historians say Eureka is the best-preserved old mining town in Nevada . Some local accommodations -- including a restored parsonage house -- date_back more_than a century . So today , Eureka bills itself as the loneliest town on the loneliest highway ; adding_to the promotion , some European tour books have miscast Eureka as a &quot; ghost town. &quot; It ' s anything but . Lights at the local gas_station flicker on at 4 in the morning so early risers can fill their Thermos jugs with coffee and grab a fried breakfast sandwich . And at night , the four bars in town will stay open as long as elbows are bending . Early imbibers don ' t have to fret , either . Melba Prina , 70 , arrives_at the Owl Club before the bartender , entering through the adjoining coffee_shop , and pours her own Canadian Mist-and-water highballs . She leaves a straw on the cash_register for each drink she makes , and when the bartender shows_up in midmorning , Melba makes_good . Such honesty permeates the town , where crime is as rare as a traffic_jam . For one six-month stretch , one bar owner didn ' t even lock the door when he left at night . The last murder occurred in 1988 . The town ' s one bank has never been robbed , as far as anyone can remember . And kids don ' t dare get_into mischief . Undersheriff Pete Bigrigg said : &quot; It ' s a great place to raise kids , because if they get_into something , you ' ll find_out before they ' re half-finished. &quot; Laura Gaherty , 18 , agreed . &quot; This town ' s too small . Everyone here knows what you ' re gonna do before you even do it. &quot; Phyllis Stelly , 35 , arrived here last year from Las Vegas to seek refuge from a crumbling marriage and said she has few regrets . Among them ? &quot; I wish there was a bit more sophistication , a place where I could wear a pretty dress. &quot; When she wore a frilly blouse , dress and heels for the Christmas dinner at the opera_house , she was horrified to see that &quot; dressy &quot; meant fringed denim skirts and Western blouses . She fled home to dress_down . Witz Bailey , the rancher , says there are probably easier places to make a living than here , where he has mortgaged the ranch to pay the fees so his cattle can run_on Bureau of Land Management land . &quot; Oh , I ' ve looked over the fence a_couple_of times , &quot; he said . &quot; But if you can ride a good horse and have a good dog , life here is good. &quot; The Loneliest Town Here is a look_at Eureka , Nev. , nicknamed The Loneliest Town on the Loneliest Road in America . Population : Between 500 and 800 , depending_on influx of gypsy miners Founded : 1864 , when five prospectors discovered silver Number of schools : Two Number of saloons : Four Number of churches : Four ( Baptist , Roman_Catholic , Episcopal , Mormon ) Nearest McDonald ' s : 120 miles away , in Elko Unemployment : Virtually none . Oldest existing structure : Tannehill Log_Cabin , 1865 Cost_of_living : At Rainey ' s Market , the town ' s only general_store , it ' s $ 3.19 for gallon of milk and $ 4.39 for six-pack of Budweiser beer ; $ 2.89 for a pound of lean ground_beef . A gallon of unleaded regular gas is $ 1.46. Sources : County of Eureka , Eureka Chamber_of_Commerce</TEXT>
