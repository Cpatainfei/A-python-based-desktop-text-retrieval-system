   <HEADLINE> OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS : IT HAS BEEN A WHALE OF A SUMMER OFF SANTA BARBARA COAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What a summer it has been off the Santa Barbara coast . Blue_whales moved_into the channel to feed several weeks ago , providing whale-watchers a rare opportunity to view the world ' s largest creatures up close . It seemed the leviathans would never leave , but they appeared to have had enough a week or so ago when killer_whales moved_into the channel and started harassing their larger cousins , providing whale-watchers an even rarer opportunity . &quot; They weren ' t attacking them , but they were chasing them down and running after them , &quot; said Fred Benko , skipper of the Condor , which has been taking passengers to the whales from its port at Santa Barbara Sea Landing . &quot; They were relentless , just bullying the blues. &quot; But now , Benko says , the killer_whales , or orcas , have left and the blue_whales have returned , at times swimming alongside Benko ' s boat with dozens of smaller humpback_whales . &quot; We had a week of pretty poor sightings , and some irate passengers during that week , &quot; Benko said . &quot; But now it seems there are more whales than ever before. &quot; The whales are feeding_on krill , tiny shrimp-like creatures that have flooded the channel in recent months . * Divers have been reporting strange happenings off the Central California coast near Point Lobos : low-frequency sounds they say they can feel through their wetsuits . Officials with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary have been investigating the source of the sounds , which one diver said were &quot; loud enough to rattle your lungs , &quot; but nobody has been able to explain the phenomenon . The U.S. Naval postgraduate school in Monterey said it has not been conducting any tests in the area , which might have explained the source of the short bursts of sound -- occurring at depths to 90 feet at six-second intervals . One theory is that the noises are the mating calls of a small fish commonly called midshipmen because of their skins ' resemblance to navy garb . The courting fish have been known to keep local houseboat owners awake at night with their low-frequency calls . However , the sounds have been occurring during the day so experts are puzzled . &quot; We ' re trying , but we haven ' t been able to track it down yet , &quot; Aaron King , a spokesman for the sanctuary , said Tuesday . * Aside from the waves that have been pounding the south shore of Oahu , it has been a relatively uneventful summer in Hawaii . Tiger_sharks have been no problem . &quot; It ' s been unusually quiet , &quot; said John Naughton , a Honolulu biologist for the National Marine Fisheries Service . &quot; For nothing at all to happen is really quite unusual. &quot; Only a year ago , Oahu was embroiled in a full-blown shark scare , as claims of shark sightings flooded the state almost daily . The scare may have stemmed from a series of attacks the previous winter on the north shore of the island , which led to a series of shark hunts . Naughton credits the hunts -- which led to the killing of dozens of large tiger_sharks -- for the lack of attacks and sightings around Oahu this year . And the shark issue was all but forgotten until Monday , when an 8-year-old girl suffered lacerations after she was bitten by something while swimming off Makaha on Oahu ' s west shore . Naughton , however , termed the attack a &quot; nothing event &quot; and said it had yet to be determined if it was even a shark that bit the girl . &quot; It could have been a small shark , or it could have been a moray_eel for all we know , &quot; he said . Briefly HUNTING -- Thunderstorms scattered the birds at times , but some hunters were able to shoot their 10-dove limits on opening day last Thursday . The best hunting was apparently in the Niland area of Imperial County and the area around Winterhaven near Yuma , Ariz . Hunters reported concentrations of birds in both areas . In the San Joaquin Valley , limits were more difficult to come_by . Lowell Kolb , 60 , of Seal Beach reported an average of about five birds per hunter during the first two days of the season -- the first_half of which closes Sept . 15 . &quot; Some did better than others and limited out , &quot; Kolb said . &quot; But we hunted in three different places , but hardly saw anything at all . We ended_up walking through the vineyards and had to scare up the birds . It wasn ' t bad as it was in the worst years but it was not very good. &quot; FISHING -- Local waters are thick_with bonito , with boats averaging 50-60 a day , and fishermen at Catalina and off the Palos Verdes Peninsula are enjoying an excellent calico bass bite as well . Marlin fishing has picked_up offshore , and Avalon Seafood had weighed 43 fish as of Tuesday morning . Yellowtail are reportedly abundant at the oil_rigs off Huntington Beach , but the fish refuse to bite . Top catch : a 10-pound king_salmon that somehow strayed down the coast . It was picked_up Sunday by an angler aboard the City of Redondo . San Diego long-range : Skippers of overnight boats are hoping that , for once , the fish will remain in a feeding mood . The fleet reported impressive counts of yellowfin_tuna , yellowtail and dorado for the first time in weeks on Monday and on Tuesday boated nothing but yellowfin -- 142 of them for 42 passengers , which isn ' t bad considering the poor counts in recent weeks . Farther down the Baja California coast , the fish are more cooperative as anglers on four-day trips are putting hundreds of yellowfin_tuna and yellowtail on the decks . Cabo San Lucas : What few people are visiting Land ' s End are suffering heat and humidity but enjoying outstanding fishing for blue_marlin , tuna and dorado . The Picses Fleet reported one angler catching and releasing a blue_marlin , then catching 14 yellowfin_tuna and 11 dorado . The blue_marlin are not huge , but they are plentiful . The tuna are mostly in the 10- to 25-pound class , but the Gaviota Fleet weighed in one at 171 pounds . The dorado are mostly 15-40 pounds . Fishing remains steady up the gulf side of the peninsula to and beyond the East Cape . At Loreto , dorado are abundant but small , averaging about 10 pounds . Sailfish averaging 85 pounds are abundant as well . CALENDAR -- Baja California fishing expert Neil Kelly will give a seminar on the subject Thursday from 7-9 p.m. at Discover Baja Travel Club ' s San Diego office . Details : ( 619 ) 275-4225 . . . . Hal Jannsen , an expert on still-water fly fishing for trout , is making the rounds at the local clubs , giving presentations Sept . 13 at the Downey Fly Fishers ' meeting , ( 310 ) 425-7936 ; Sept . 14 at the Pasadena Casting Club , ( 818 ) 449-1152 , and Sept . 15 at the Conejo Valley Fly Fishers , ( 805 ) 496-7332 .</TEXT>
