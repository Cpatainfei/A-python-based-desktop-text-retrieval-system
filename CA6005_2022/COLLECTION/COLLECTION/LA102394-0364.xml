   <HEADLINE> FOR ARAFAT , HOBSON ' S CHOICE AFTER HAMAS BUS BOMBING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat shook hands with Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin at the White_House on Sept . 13 , 1993 , he became a pariah to radicals in the Palestinian movement and many others in the Muslim world . In their view , Arafat had made a deal with the_devil and -- like the traitor Egyptian President Anwar Sadat , who made_peace with Israel and was assassinated -- would also have to pay the ultimate price for his crimes . Now , with his control of Palestinian territory still restricted to the Gaza Strip and Jericho -- but with a Nobel Peace prize under his belt -- Arafat faces his most fateful choice : When and how should he crack_down on the extremist movement , Hamas , that threatens to destroy the delicate Middle_East peace ? In the wake of last week ' s terrorist bombing in Tel Aviv -- in which more_than 20 people were killed on a commuter bus on the busiest city street -- Arafat ' s options are grim indeed . Just as Israel ' s first prime_minister , David Ben-Gurion , had to use lethal force in the early days of independence in 1948 to disarm Jewish extremist groups led by Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir , Arafat has known that a showdown with Hamas was inevitable . But unlike Ben-Gurion , who controlled most of the military and police_forces of the new Jewish state , Arafat controls little . His preference would surely have been to wait for a showdown until his own Palestinian forces controlled most of the occupied West_Bank . As of now , he has the worst of all worlds : no control or authority in the West_Bank and around Jerusalem , where many Hamas supporters come from , yet held responsible by Israelis for Hamas terrorism . He thus is under great pressure from the government of Israel and the United States to apprehend Hamas supporters in Gaza . If he does so , as happened two weeks ago after the kidnaping of an Israeli soldier , Nachshon Waxman , he incurs the wrath of much of the Gaza population and is accused of being Israel ' s lackey . As it turned_out , the kidnapers ' hide-out was discovered near Jerusalem , two miles from the home of Waxman ' s parents . In the resulting shoot-out with Israeli forces , Waxman , another Israeli soldier , and three terrorists were killed . With the kidnaping , Arafat could legitimately claim events were beyond his control . But this excuse will not work for long . Hamas headquarters are in Gaza , and , sooner or later , a terrorist event planned and coordinated from within his own enclave will occur , and he will have to act . In fact , it is certainly possible that Gaza-based Hamas members played a role in the string of recent attacks -- including the Tel Aviv bombing . In the aftermath of the latest terrorism , anger among the Palestinians is bound to grow as Israel ' s Draconian , but politically necessary , crackdowns take their toll of daily life and add_to the already harsh conditions in Gaza . Arafat will be the lightning_rod for this frustration . If he fails to act against the radicals he could lose_control of his enclave . At that point , anarchy or a return of Israeli forces may result . Either way , Hamas will have won : The peace process will be over or on indefinite hold . What , then , can Arafat do ? First , to satisfy Israel and the United States , he must be more outspoken in his condemnation of terrorism and stress his willingness to take whatever steps are necessary to contain it -- including asking_for more help to strengthen his police and intelligence gathering . Taking action to curb the militant extremists is needed to lend credibility to Arafat ' s words . A crackdown on Hamas in Gaza , including disarmament , coupled with action Israel will take_in the West_Bank , is essential to put the terrorists on the defensive . Arafat will argue that unless more Palestinian areas are brought under his control , his opposition to terrorism may ultimately prove counterproductive . He can also argue that he must have more money to pay_for basic services , like police , and establish some modicum of stability and infrastructure , which is the prerequisite for the transfer of much larger amounts_of_money from the private sector . There has been an understandable reluctance on the part of the main donor countries and the World_Bank to hand Arafat money until he has set_up an acceptable accounting procedure . While such reform is highly desirable , in the short term , such niceties may be a luxury if the alternative is anarchy . Obviously , the constraints on Arafat ' s options would be less painful if elections could soon be held_in the occupied territory , and the economic_conditions of the local Palestinian population were seen to be improving . Hamas ' appeal will begin to diminish once Arafat delivers on his promises of a better life for his people . But how can Hamas be allowed to field candidates for electoral office as long as the organization ' s purpose -- as outlined in its charter -- is to reject the peace process , deny Israel ' s legitimacy and call_for a holy war against infidels ? Just as Israel outlaws racist groups , such_as Kach , so the Palestinians must force Hamas to abandon its charter if it wishes to participate in elections . Arafat has to use his power to try to divide and weaken Hamas . He must be certain that , if a reformed Hamas participates in elections , it will abandon all calls_for violence . Some will argue that this logic will perpetuate Arafat ' s authoritarian and increasingly unpopular rule by fiat . But the alternative , giving more legitimacy to Hamas , would be unacceptable to most Israelis and reverse all_the progress of the last year in Israeli-Palestinian relations .</TEXT>
