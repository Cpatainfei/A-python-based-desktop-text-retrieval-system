   <HEADLINE> POLITICAL MORASS COULD TRAP JAPAN ' S ECONOMIC RECOVERY ; TRADE : A SPLIT IN THE HOURS-OLD COALITION GOVERNMENT SENDS THE TOKYO STOCK_MARKET LOWER AS INVESTORS LOSE CONFIDENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The political chaos that hit Japan ' s government early today , just 12 hours after the election of new Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata , may derail an expected economic recovery and lead to worsening trade friction with the United States . The Tokyo stock_market ' s Nikkei index fell 118.92 points , or 0.6 % , to 19 # 590.22 in the first 18 minutes of trading this morning , reflecting investors ' fears of a negative economic fallout from the collapse of the ruling coalition headed by Hata . Investors &quot; had bought the dream of return to efficient government led by a stable coalition and a prime_minister who is very pragmatic , &quot; commented Jesper Koll , an analyst with S.G. Warburg Securities . &quot; And you are now short somewhere around 60 votes of a majority ( for Hata ' s government ) . Minority governments are inherently unstable . . . You have the knee-jerk reaction in the stock market. &quot; The entire cabinet of outgoing Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned en masse Monday , in preparation for Hata ' s election by parliament . But the naming of a new set of ministers , which normally takes_place within hours , was blocked when the coalition split into conservative and leftist factions . Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama announced early this morning that his party would leave the government . Murayama said his party would help pass a budget_for fiscal 1994 , which began April 1 , but would no longer be bound by any other policy agreements with other coalition parties . Passage of the budget , which contains some measures designed to stimulate Japan ' s stagnant economy , is considered the most basic prerequisite to encourage renewed economic_growth . But much more active market-opening and economic-stimulus measures will be needed to address trade disputes with the United States in the face of Clinton_Administration threats to impose retaliatory trade sanctions . Japan has pledged to produce a program by June to &quot; substantially &quot; reduce its $ 141 billion global trade surplus , including a $ 60 billion surplus with the United States . New action to stimulate economic_growth , thereby pulling_in more foreign goods through an increase in domestic demand , is a key element of what has been expected . But it is no longer clear that Hata ' s government will have the time or the political strength to focus_on these issues before that deadline . &quot; The promise of clarity over the fiscal stance has been shattered , &quot; Koll said . &quot; You ' ve got a government that is less likely to produce a permanent ( income ) tax cut , as desired by the U.S._government , before the July Naples summit ( of the G-7 major industrial democracies ) . &quot; The sort of political upheaval that has now erupted had been feared for months , but many had hoped that the election of Hata would usher_in a period of at least a_few months of relative calm . Now the possibilities range from a quick political realignment that still gives Hata a working majority to a dissolution of the lower house of parliament and general_elections . Most of the possibilities have investors and analysts worried . &quot; If we have an election , and the result is not so good for the markets , that ' s a big factor of risk , &quot; Hirohiko Okumura , research_director at Nomura Research Institute , said in a recent interview when it still appeared the coalition would hold together . Hata ' s elevation to be prime_minister was expected to be a factor for political stability , he said . Now that confidence in basic continuity of government policies is gone .</TEXT>
