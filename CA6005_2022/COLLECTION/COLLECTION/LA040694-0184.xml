   <HEADLINE> JAPAN STARTS_UP CONTROVERSIAL PLUTONIUM-PRODUCING REACTOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan ' s widely criticized plan to use plutonium to produce energy took an important step_forward Tuesday when engineers shifted an experimental &quot; fast-breeder &quot; reactor into continuous operation . Protesters denounced the reactor , which produces more plutonium than it uses , as unsafe and unwise.Police said about 100 people rallied peacefully outside the plant in Tsuruga , 200 miles from Tokyo on the Sea_of_Japan coast . Critics say plutonium is too lethal for safe use , and they also worry that it could become the target for terrorists who want to build a nuclear bomb . The 280 # 000-kilowatt nuclear_power station , which cost $ 5.9 billion , is named Monju after the Buddhist deity of wisdom . It will not begin transmitting electricity until April , 1995 , and will not be at full power until late next year . Its start-up was delayed 1 1 / 2 years by a series of technical problems . Opponents say the reactor ' s safety systems have not been adequately tested and fear that an accident could scatter highly lethal plutonium , possibly tainting water and food supplies . Monju ' s cooling system is at_issue because it uses liquid sodium , which can ignite when exposed to air . A similar reactor in France was shut_down in 1990 after several leaks in its sodium-based cooling_system and is still idle . Several other nations have dropped plans for plutonium-producing reactors because of the hazards and costs of producing the material and because less-toxic uranium became much cheaper .</TEXT>
