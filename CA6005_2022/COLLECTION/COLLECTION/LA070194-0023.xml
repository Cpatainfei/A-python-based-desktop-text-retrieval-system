   <HEADLINE> ON THE SCENE / PATT MORRISON ; A SEARING FOCUS_ON PONDEROUS PROCEEDINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hundreds of reporters , scores of hours of video , thousands of words expended to convey the tedium and the lunacy of Thursday in Los Angeles -- and the mood of the day was_best captured by the behavior of a copying machine in the fifth-floor county clerk ' s office . Turning_out document replicas to satisfy all_the reporters who wanted them , it simply overloaded and stopped . It was a day so crazy that O.J. Simpson ' s lawyer-friends Robert Kardashian and Leroy Taft , pursued into the street by reporters , took a bus -- a bus ! -- to a Downtown restaurant for lunch and hitched a ride back to court in a police_car . . . and a day so routine that in cars mired in dense traffic a mere block from the courthouse , radios were blaring everything but O.J. The first day of O.J. Simpson ' s preliminary hearing could fit anyplace in L.A. ' s kaleidoscope : Variety would call it a plodding legal sequel that couldn ' t hold the audience , compared to the original blockbuster , the slow-mo twilight freeway chase of two weeks ago . Caltech could plot the course of Thursday ' s newsquake , from the courtroom epicenter , across town , across the country ; to a gym in Long_Beach , where people stayed aboard the Stairmasters so they could watch TV ; to a Crenshaw district store , where a saleswoman ' s 5-year-old daughter said as the TV came_on , &quot; Oh no , not O.J. again ! &quot; ; to a noontime Chicago bar where no one wondered who he was when the waitress asked , &quot; Do you think he did_it ? &quot; . . . to the Peachtree Street Macy ' s in Atlanta where , of the 66 color_TVs in the electronics department , all but two were turned_to CNN and Simpson . And the radio shrinks could say that we have had it up_to here with O.J. . . . or that we ' re so avid for every scrap about the case that the Boston Globe can trill on for a dozen rapt paragraphs about the prosecutor ' s &quot; head of tight curls &quot; and the defense_attorney ' s &quot; deep , deep tan. &quot; The day , frame by frame : At 7:30 a.m. , an hour when even the homeless have just begun to populate Downtown streets , Nicole Brown Simpson ' s sisters , parents and friends were sitting in the back booth of a scruffy Downtown coffee_shop , waiting to attend the hearing . The hearing that had gotten as much buildup as the opening of a new Steven Spielberg movie began with promising drama , when the helicopters hove into sound and view at 8:40 a.m. , tracking the police_van bringing Simpson to court . ( Unlike what one young_man assured another on a Downtown street , there is no tunnel from the jail to the courthouse. ) The courtroom pace moved ponderously , disappointing many who had expected incendiary TV-movie lawyering . But not everyone . At Jefferson Boulevard and Crenshaw Avenue , where &quot; Pray for O.J. &quot; T-shirts rippled like flags in the late June wind , Jay Akeem paid $ 10 for an extra-large and said : &quot; We grew_up on ' Perry Mason ' and ' Matlock ' . . . . It ' s tedious going through the proceedings though . I was watching this morning , the forensics , the LAPD woman -- ( it was ) getting real technical , but it ' s important. &quot; At the Legends sports bar in Santa Monica , Steve Grospitz was late for lunch with his sister because he had been watching the case . &quot; I actually was kind of wanting for this to get started ; we heard so_much hearsay . I was interested in what the court was going_to do . Michael Jackson , the Menendez thing. &quot; But the city ' s energy , he figures , &quot; is kind of exhausted. &quot; With only 80 seats in the courtroom , news stations and the curious found more engrossing events out on the courthouse sidewalks . See-saw debates went_on between Simpson supporters and people such_as Jewish Defense League leader Irv Rubin , who demanded via bullhorn that defense_attorney Robert L . Shapiro not forget his &quot; Jewish brother , Ronald Goldman , &quot; one of the victims . Perennial candidate Melrose Larry Green told a Simpson supporter , &quot; Stand_up and smell the bagels ! &quot; Nearby , artist Rodney Vanworth created an instant mural when he spread a six-foot canvas on the sidewalk and invited people to write_on it with markers . He had already drawn the figure of a red-smeared woman with knives sticking_out of her body , a shoe , a jail_cell , a sink and a toilet and a trophy with the words &quot; hero &quot; and &quot; pity the victims &quot; written_on it . In Brentwood , as police searched an empty lot for more evidence , it was like old times -- two weeks ago when it was the center of the action . A delivery man from A Votre Sante restaurant , who had fed the media mob then , lost no time in returning Thursday and passing_out menus for fare like whole wheat chapatis filled with hummus . &quot; This is Brentwood , &quot; Sean McFarland said . &quot; Nobody eats anything with fat in it. &quot; Commerce has been part of big legal cases since fast-buck artists sold toy monkeys on the sidewalks outside the Scopes evolution trial in 1925 . Outside the courthouse , shirt-seller K.T. had virtually cleared_out all 20 dozen shirts -- &quot; Don ' t Squeeze the Juice &quot; and &quot; Pray for O.J. &quot; -- in two days . One woman fingered a shirt , sniffed and said to K.T. , &quot; Do you have any with the opposite point_of_view , like ' Fry O.J. ' ? &quot; City_Hall sidewalks served as little more_than a parking_lot for TV vans -- and they all got parking_tickets . In one city councilman ' s office , the receptionist admitted that &quot; there ' s a TV in back that no one ' s supposed to know about. &quot; Mayor Richard Riordan ' s aides held their breath lest their boss be bumped yet again from an oft-delayed morning news appearance . And standing with the smokers on the west steps , Vivian Sarpong complained that she had gone_to a drugstore Thursday morning to buy &quot; one of those little TVs , and they were all sold_out ! &quot; She will buy one this weekend . At her desk , she prepared &quot; a little spot for my TV . Got a little piece of cardboard in case anybody comes_by , I can flop it down , cover it up. &quot; If people watched or listened at_work , most tried to do so unobtrusively . On the floor of a huge Downtown bank , a woman at a desk murmured that there was a TV around somewhere , but &quot; the bank doesn ' t pay me for that , unfortunately. &quot; At the Radio Shack in the bowels of the Arco towers , a TV_showed the Simpson case -- but partly because the reception was too_bad to get soccer . And at Mezzaluna , the bright , prow-shaped Brentwood restaurant where Nicole Simpson last ate and Goldman last worked , waiters sliding the luncheon specials into the menus looked_up at the television suspended from the cloud-painted ceiling , and murmured about with the day ' s legal doings in overheard snips like &quot; special circumstances &quot; and &quot; and then he walks. &quot; The start of the hearing coincided with lunch hour in much of the country . In the back_room of Mother Hubbard ' s in Chicago , claims adjuster Alona Sanders got_to monitor the case at_work the first day -- but today is another matter . &quot; They came_in and told us today that as of tomorrow , they were cutting_off the radios during work hours , &quot; Sanders said . &quot; They think it ' s interfering with our work. &quot; Although it ' s soccer , not Simpson , that ' s disrupting the Russian parliament by keeping people up until 2 a.m. , in Boston bookish circles , the mention of the case is enough to divert conversation from more arcane topics . A Boston woman ' s regular two-hour Saturday phone conversation with her mother in Ohio has been devoted exclusively to Simpson , and now runs three hours . Back in Los Angeles , only one moment seemed to vary from the script . A tall man in a suit walked into the heavily secured court wearing one of the rare , coveted white badges identifying him as a member of the defense or prosecution team . He said he was &quot; a good friend of O.J. ' s and Shapiro ' s. &quot; When deputies asked Shapiro about that , the defense_attorney said : &quot; I ' ve never seen him in my life , &quot; and the man was hustled out .
