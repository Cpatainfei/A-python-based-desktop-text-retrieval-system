   <HEADLINE> OLD LAW GIVES MINERS THE GOLD , U.S. THE DROSS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state flag fluttering above the Pine_Tree Restaurant in this remote town near Yellowstone_National_Park displays Montana ' s promise to miners : &quot; Oro y Plata &quot; -- Spanish for &quot; Gold and Silver. &quot; Across the street , that promise has produced a less savory combination of metals . A lethal mixture of copper , lead , chromium and iron -- leaching from a waste heap left by an old_gold mine built_on federally owned land -- has turned once-pure Soda Butte Creek into a poisonous red ribbon that can sustain almost no life for three or four miles beyond Cooke City . As far as miners are concerned , the flag ' s promise has been kept . But while the miners have gotten the gold and silver , many in Cooke City contend that their city and U.S. taxpayers have gotten the shaft . Forty miles to the north , for example , the Stillwater Mine could yield a pair of giant corporations as much as $ 30 billion of platinum , palladium and silver . But although the land where these treasures have been found is almost entirely owned by the federal_government , the U.S. Treasury will probably not receive so_much as a silver_dollar in royalties . Both the pollution in Soda Butte Creek and the revenue stream from the Stillwater Mine are legacies of a federal law signed by President Ulysses S . Grant in 1872 and left largely intact . By promising miners the fruits of their prospecting , the law was intended to help settle the West and develop the nation ' s wealth . But it has left the federal_government with little more_than the pollution that the mines generate . Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt kicked_off the Clinton_Administration ' s campaign for mining reform last year when , with a disgusted look , he publicly signed documents giving a Canadian-owned mining_company the ownership rights to a parcel of federal land containing one of the world ' s richest veins of gold -- as much as $ 8 billion worth -- in return for a payment of only $ 9 # 000 to the U.S. Treasury . &quot; Many mining_companies . . . are ripping_off the American public fair and square , &quot; Babbitt told reporters at the time . &quot; It ( the 1872 law ) ought to be changed. &quot; The House has already approved a sweeping mining reform bill . Passed in November , 316 to 108 , the bill exacts stiff royalties from mines on federal lands , uses the revenue to establish a cleanup fund for abandoned mines and sets strict federal environmental standards for the operation and closure of mines . But the mining industry mounted a counter-campaign that resulted in Senate passage of a much weaker bill . That legislation , sponsored by Sen . Larry E . Craig ( R-Ida. ) , imposes much smaller royalties on miners and includes none of the environmental provisions of the House bill . The outcome will be determined by a House-Senate conference committee . Babbitt , who points_out that the industry is now at least willing to discuss reform , hopes that a new era is at_hand . &quot; I ' m optimistic this time , &quot; he said . For Cooke City and many other U.S. communities , change may well come too late . Under the 1872 law , about 400 # 000 mines have been excavated and abandoned on federal lands across the country . Environmental Protection Agency chief Carol Browner said &quot; a significant number &quot; of mines leach cyanide , arsenic , cadmium and lead into nearby streams , lakes and ground_water . About 3 million acres of federal land -- an area the size of Connecticut -- have been sold to private mining_companies for $ 2.50 to $ 5 an acre . More_than 50 abandoned mining areas have been placed on the government ' s Superfund list of toxic_waste_sites . They include the giant Summitville Gold Mine in Colorado , which in 1992 spilled cyanide and acid-laced runoff into the Alamosa River , killing aquatic life for 17 miles downstream . The Canadian owner , Galactic Resources Ltd. , declared bankruptcy , leaving taxpayers with a cleanup bill estimated at $ 60 million . In all , U.S. taxpayers are expected to foot bills of $ 33 billion to $ 77 billion for the cleanup of Summitville and other mines on federal lands , according to estimates by the Mineral Policy Center , a Washington-based mining industry watchdog and a key player in the latest bid for reform . Meanwhile , mining_companies -- many of them foreign-owned -- are scooping_up $ 1.2 billion worth of minerals from federal lands annually , according to the General Accounting Office . They paid &quot; not one thin dime &quot; in royalties to American taxpayers , according to Sen . Dale Bumpers ( D-Ark. ) , an advocate of reforming the law . &quot; The 1872 law heaps fiscal injury upon environmental insult , &quot; said Philip Hocker , director of the Mineral Policy Center . &quot; It has got_to go. &quot; The public seems to agree . A 1990 poll conducted for the American Mining Congress , the industry ' s principal professional_association , found that eight in 10 respondents said they believe the mining industry &quot; should have to restore federal land and pay royalties to the government just like the oil and coal_industries do. &quot; Such a response , said an internal American Mining Congress strategy document , &quot; provides the most concrete evidence that the industry should not conduct the mining law battle in public view. &quot; In recent months , however , the mining industry has gone_on the offensive to counter perceptions that it wants to block reform . &quot; We are willing to pay our fair share , and we ' ve been at the table ready to resolve this debate , &quot; the presidents of four major mining_companies wrote last month in the Denver Post . &quot; We support change . However , we hope that change doesn ' t kill the gold mining industry in this country. &quot; But within days of signing that letter , the president of Echo Bay Mines was taking Babbitt to court in an effort to win ownership rights to 660 acres of federal land -- at a cost of $ 3 # 305 -- under the terms of the 1872 law . An angry Babbitt called the lawsuit &quot; a blatant attempt to exempt themselves from the environmental and regulatory provisions that will come_out of mining reform &quot; by &quot; those who claim they want reform. &quot; The mining industry has much to lose . The 1872 law established mining as &quot; the highest use &quot; for federal lands , a status that has given Interior little latitude to deny applications for rights to mine the nation ' s landholdings . The Treasury receives revenues from the payrolls and profits that mining_companies make from their U.S. operations , but nothing more . Oil_companies pay the government a direct royalty of 12.5 % of the value of the goods they extract from federal land , and coal mining_companies pay 8 % . But under the 1872 law , hard-rock mining_companies , whether foreign- or American-owned , pay no direct royalties for the use of the federal lands . &quot; You get indignant , &quot; said Rep . George Miller ( D-Martinez ) , one of the authors of the House bill . &quot; These companies think they have a God-given right to have the taxpayers support them. &quot; Miller argued that the political and economic weight of the American West has shifted away from extraction industries such_as mining , giving land-reform efforts a powerful impetus . &quot; The West is filling_up with people , and these people want to use the lands , the streams , the open spaces , &quot; Miller said . &quot; But because of industries like mining , the streams are polluted , the ground_water is contaminated , the air is dirty . You used to be able to get_away with that when no one was out there . But you can ' t anymore. &quot; The House-passed bill abolishes the sale of federal land to private mining firms , a practice that mining firms call crucial to ensuring that they have the rights to mine land on which they have made substantial investments . And in one of its most controversial provisions , it imposes a royalty of 8 % of the gross value of hard-rock minerals taken from federal lands . The bill could also make places such_as the area around Cooke City harder to mine by giving the Interior_secretary the right to declare some federal lands unsuitable for mining . Less than three miles north of Yellowstone_National_Park , Cooke City is the proposed site of a mine that promises to yield $ 600 million in gold and copper . The giant pond that would hold the mine ' s poisonous waste would be built_in a prime area traveled_by the endangered grizzly_bear . If water seeps from the mine , or if the impoundment pond leaks or overflows , critics say they fear that the operation could contaminate waters that flow into Yellowstone Park or into Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone_River , a waterway so spectacular that it has won federal protection . Mining_companies argue that the House bill could cost as_many as 44 # 000 jobs in 14 states . They also maintain that it could reduce income to the Treasury by $ 422 million a year by cutting the mining industry ' s earnings and output . Craig argued that setting royalties any higher would make_it unprofitable for mining_companies to operate in the United States . In response , the mining industry would take its high_technology and its high-wage , blue-collar jobs and pack off to Africa , East Asia , Latin_America and the republics of the former Soviet_Union , where environmental regulations and the cost of operations are more forgiving . The charge incenses Babbitt . &quot; The mining industry has been threatening to go abroad since 1880 , &quot; he said . &quot; There is more mining going_on , more profits , more productivity now in this country than there were 100 years ago . . . . It ' s a rhetorical threat. &quot; With lawmakers set to begin negotiations on reconciling the House and Senate bills , Babbitt said he would be &quot; packing my proverbial suitcase , heading out_to every crossroads in the West , selling my wares. &quot;</TEXT>
