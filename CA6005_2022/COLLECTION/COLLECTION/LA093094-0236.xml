   <HEADLINE> ' AND DID YOU TRY FINDING A JOB LAST WEEK , MR . BONILLA ? '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Don Mattingly on the dole ? It could happen in New York , the only state where striking major_league baseball_players will become eligible for unemployment benefits . But a state_senator said Thursday he will introduce a bill next year that would prohibit striking players from receiving benefits . &quot; New York must be the land of milk and honey , &quot; said state Sen . Joseph Holland . &quot; It is the only place where you can make millions of dollars playing a game , ask_for more money and get unemployment benefits while you strike. &quot; New York is one of only two states that provide unemployment benefits to strikers -- baseball or otherwise . Rhode Island is the other , but it doesn ' t have any major_league teams . Strikers become eligible for benefits eight weeks after a work_stoppage , so Bobby Bonilla , Paul O ' Neill and the rest of the New York Mets and Yankees can sign_up for benefits at their local unemployment office starting Oct . 7 . The strike began Aug . 12 . Benefits are based on half an employee ' s weekly salary up_to $ 300 , state Labor_Department spokeswoman Kathy Do said . Other team employees affected by the strike , such_as batboys and ticket_takers , can also receive benefits for as long as 26 weeks , she said . Do said she could not comment on whether the Labor_Department has had any inquiries from ballplayers . &quot; This whole strike has been about one thing -- greed , &quot; Holland said . &quot; The real victims of the strike are the people whose livelihood is dependent_on baseball. &quot;</TEXT>
