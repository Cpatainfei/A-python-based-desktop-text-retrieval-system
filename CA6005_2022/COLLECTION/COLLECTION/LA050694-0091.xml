   <HEADLINE> NATION IN BRIEF ; ALABAMA ; FIREFIGHTERS WIN REVERSE BIAS CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal appeals court panel sided with white firefighters in a reverse bias claim , dealing a potential blow to hiring and promotion goals based too rigidly on race in Birmingham , Ala . The three-judge panel of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously found that the Fire_Department ' s promotion_system illegally uses harsh racial quotas in the name of eliminating past discrimination.Birmingham , once a hotbed of racial violence , had no black firefighters until 1968 . With the help of a 1981 consent decree that allowed race-based promotions , about one-third of the department ' s 680 employees are black . There are more_than 50 black supervisors , including one chief . But the appeals court struck_down the formula that led to many of those promotions , saying it resulted in promotions being made &quot; woodenly and reflexively in rigid adherence to a quota system. &quot;</TEXT>
