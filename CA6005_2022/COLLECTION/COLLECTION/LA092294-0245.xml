   <HEADLINE> BONES IN AFRICA CALLED CLOSEST YET TO MISSING LINK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a handful of teeth and skull fragments almost a_million years older than anything else in the human family_tree , scientists have discovered compelling evidence of a new species that may be humanity ' s earliest direct ancestor . It is the closest thing yet to the long-sought &quot; missing link &quot; between human_beings and ancient apes , the scientists said . The fossils , gleaned from a rugged river_basin in Ethiopia , are the fragmentary remains of a child and 16 other small , apelike individuals of a previously unknown pre-human species that flourished in African woodlands 4.4 million years ago , an international team of researchers announced Wednesday . &quot; This species is the oldest known link in the evolutionary chain that connected us to the common ancestor ( we share ) with the living African apes , &quot; said Tim D . White , a paleontologist at UC Berkeley ' s Laboratory for Human Evolutionary Studies , who led the team that made the discovery near a village called Aramis . The new species -- named Australopithecus ramidus -- is a mosaic of primitive and advanced features , the scientists said . The creature ' s jaw and teeth are similar to those of a chimpanzee , while other crucial details of anatomy suggest more human characteristics . Several experts who have examined the fossils said the discovery offers the first direct glimpse into the era when humanity ' s earliest ancestors veered off from other primitive primates , underscoring the relatively rapid pace of human evolution . The remains appear to date_from a time shortly after the human family_tree first branched , with one line leading to modern human_beings and the other leading to the great_apes of Africa . The bones also buttress a theory long championed by molecular biologists who have argued that , based on genetic analysis , the first human-like species appeared as recently as 5 million years ago -- about 25 million years earlier than conventional estimates . When first proposed in 1967 , the idea was scorned by most anthropologists . &quot; When you combine these Aramis fossils with the evidence from the molecules , clearly Darwin was right -- humans evolved from an African ape , &quot; White said . The tiny shards of bone -- gnawed by ancient carnivores , buried in silt from seasonal floods -- were recently unearthed by torrential desert rains . They include parts of the skull , the arm and the lower jaw of a child . &quot; This is the closest thing to the missing link we have ever found , &quot; said Owen Lovejoy of Kent State University , a leading authority on human origins who has studied the find . &quot; This thing is really primitive. &quot; All the remains are from the upper body and offer scant insight into how these earliest hominids , as the pre-human ancestors of humanity are called , lived or traveled . But other fossils found nearby suggest that their homeland was a flat , forested plain rich_in wildlife such_as rhinoceroses , bears , monkeys , bats and primitive antelopes . The hominids are the first to be found in such a wooded environment , leading several scientists to speculate that the remains are evidence that the first stages of human evolution , such_as the development of upright posture and walking on two legs , occurred among the trees and not in open grasslands as_many scientists have argued . The expedition ' s discoveries were published in the science journal Nature , along with research by scientists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Berkeley Geochronology Center that examines the botanical , animal and geological evidence accompanying the find . The fossils were found in a region of East Africa that , during the past 30 years , has seen some of the most significant discoveries relating to primitive hominids . The Aramis area is north of Lake Turkana , where a 1.6-million-year-old hominid boy was found by Richard Leakey in 1984 . It is 46 miles south of the Hadar , where paleontologists discovered the species represented by the famous Lucy skeleton . That species , called Australopithecus_afarensis , was previously the oldest known human ancestor . Donald C . Johanson , who discovered the Lucy skeleton in 1974 , called the new find &quot; terrific &quot; and endorsed the idea of a new species of hominid that lived about 1.2 million years before Lucy . &quot; This is a very important piece of evidence that says that beyond 4 million years ago there appears to be a single line ( of descent ) and a single ( human ) lineage , &quot; he said . In 1979 , White and Johanson described Lucy and related fossils as a new species most likely ancestral to all later hominids . Last year , a team led by White announced the discovery of more fossils from the same species that showed that hominids ranged over much of Africa for about 800 # 000 years . A series of arresting discoveries announced this year has forced a reconsideration of much of what was assumed about human origins , from how quickly early hominids migrated out of Africa to what may have triggered the first use of tools . But the story of the evolution of humankind as recorded in the sparse fossil record is composed largely of gaps and long silences . The creatures that predated Lucy ' s kind remained a mystery until now . The new species was found in a remote area west of the Awash River in Ethiopia . In the hardscrabble badlands there , expedition anthropologist Gen Suwa , from the University of Tokyo , spotted a single molar on Dec . 17 , 1992 , among the pebbles and hundreds of bone chips from other ancient animals whose remains had been ravaged by predators . &quot; I knew immediately it was a hominid , &quot; he said . In the year that followed , White and other expedition members turned_up different bone fragments and teeth from 17 members of the species . The name of the new species -- ramidus -- is derived from the word that means &quot; root &quot; in the language of the Afar tribe , who live where the fossils were found . &quot; We think we are getting pretty close to a common ancestor between chimpanzee and human , &quot; White said . &quot; It is not a monkey . It is clearly a relative. &quot; Unearthing Human Origins Scientists announced the discovery of prehuman fossils that are the closest thing yet to the missing link between the great_apes of Africa and human_beings . If confirmed by subsequent studies , the new species may prove to be near the root of the human family_tree . New species Australopithecus ramidus Earliest known A . afarensis Lucy Homo neanderthalensis ( Neanderthal ) Homo_sapiens ( Modern_man ) WHAT : Teeth , skull fragments and arm_bones from 17 members of a previously unknown pre-human species almost 4.4 million years old . Scientists said the new species -- called Australopithecus ramidus -- is believed to be humanity ' s earliest known ancestor . WHERE : At Aramis near the Awash River of Ethiopia . Site is about 45 miles from Hadar , where the famous Lucy skeleton was found almost 20 years ago . That species , called Australopithecus_afarensis , was the previously oldest known human ancestor . WHO : A team of scientists led by Tim D . White of the Laboratory for Human Evolutionary Studies at UC Berkeley , anthropologist Gen Suwa at the University of Tokyo and paleontologist Berhane Asfaw at the Ethiopian Ministry of Culture and Sports Affairs . The team is returning to the site next month . Source : Nature , UC Berkeley .</TEXT>
