   <HEADLINE> THESE GAMES ARE SERIOUS BUSINESS ; OLYMPICS : WITH OPENING CEREMONY TODAY , MANY ATHLETES HAVE OTHER THINGS ON THEIR MINDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Norwegians by reputation are polite but reserved , slow to warm_to strangers , and were it not for the sheer joy they feel , and unreservedly share , as hosts of the XVII Olympic Winter Games , there would be a gloom over today ' s opening ceremony at Lillehammer Olympic Park to match a hazy sky in which the sun is no more_than a rumor . It was only two years ago that we did this , gathering for the XVI Winter_Olympics in the_French Alps , and as a result , many of the athletes who will compete during the next 16 days are familiar -- skier Alberto Tomba , speedskaters Bonnie Blair and Dan Jansen , figure skater Viktor Petrenko , the Jamaican bobsledders . Others returning from Olympics past include figure skaters Brian Boitano , Katarina Witt , and Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean . But they have been overshadowed by events of recent months , most tragically by the death of 68 persons in an attack on Sarajevo ' s Central Market in the same week that the Olympic movement commemorated its 10-year anniversary of the 1984 Winter Games there and on the same day that a truce sponsored by the International Olympic Committee and the United Nations was supposed to begin . Austrian Alpine skier Ulrike Maier , a contender for three medals here , was killed in a downhill crash in Germany last month ; U.S. ice dancer Elizabeth Punsalan ' s brother was arrested last week for the stabbing death of her father in Ohio ; Norway ' s most popular athlete , cross-country skier Vegard Ulvang , who will deliver the athletes ' oath today , has been searching for months for his brother who disappeared while skiing in a snowstorm . &quot; In the springtime , when the snow is gone , I will go and try to find him , &quot; he said this week , his face streaked with tears . When luger Cammy Myler carries the flag for the U.S. delegation in the opening ceremony , her brother , Tim , who introduced her to the sport , will be watching on television from a hospital_bed in Lake Placid , N.Y. , where he is undergoing treatment for cancer . The problems of figure skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding seem minuscule by comparison . It is they , however , who are dominating the headlines , even in Norway . A photograph of Kerrigan ' s face covered the front page of Norway ' s largest tabloid , VG , one day last week . Superimposed was the headline : &quot; GALSCAP. &quot; Madness . Wearing horned Viking helmets , painting their faces like the Norwegian flag and clanging cowbells until all hours of the morning , the citizens of this region have been similarly afflicted , behaving like , well , Americans . A young waitress in a cafe here one day last week slipped_on a wet spot and took a spill . Leaping to her feet , she struck a speedskater ' s pose and said , &quot; Koss , &quot; referring to Norway ' s speedskating hero , Johann Olav Koss . One reason for their giddiness is that Norwegians like winter , and they have had plenty of it this year , with the most snow in three decades and temperatures hovering between minus-12 and 12 . It is not quite as cold as it was during the 1952 Winter Games 110 miles south of here in Oslo , where carrier_pigeons for news organizations froze to death , but it is cold enough . Another reason is that they like winter sports . They have bought virtually all_of the 1.4 million tickets available for 112 events in eight sports , far surpassing the record set by the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee , which sold 84 % of its allotment for the 1984 Summer Games . Thousands more Norwegians who were unlucky losers in the ticket lottery for the most popular sport here , cross-country_skiing , are expected to line the snow-covered course for each race , many of them camping_out overnight . They are anticipating a gold_rush for their athletes . After finishing first in the medal standings in five of the first six Winter_Olympics , between 1924 and ' 52 , Norway has done so only once since , in 1968 . But with the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the revitalization of_their_own sports system , Norwegians could win more medals here than any of the other 65 countries . Americans , led by speedskaters Blair and Jansen and figure skaters Boitano and Kerrigan , could -- if everything goes right , which it never does -- win as_many as 14 medals . The most they have won in the Winter Games is 12 , at Lake Placid in both 1932 and 1980 . The U.S. Olympic Committee ' s executive_director , Harvey Schiller , said Friday he fears that the Harding-Kerrigan affair could prove a distraction for U.S. athletes . But John Ruger , a former biathlete who serves as chairman of the USOC ' s athletes ' advisory council , thinks not . &quot; It ' s not their No . 1 topic of conversation , &quot; he said . &quot; It comes_up , but it ' s the third or 10th or 15th thing on their list of things to talk_about . The Winter_Olympics are so important to all 154 of our athletes that they ' re concentrating only on their events . &quot; The Olympic Games are about hope and promise and fulfilling your dreams , and those are the elements that our athletes are focusing_on . This is their moment. &quot; Today was supposed to be the moment for Ole Gunnar Fidjestol . Striving to one-up organizers of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona , Spain , who commissioned an archer to light the torch with a flaming arrow , the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee arranged for the former ski flyer to sail off the end of a ski_jump with the Olympic flame in the crowning spectacle of the opening ceremony . But after completing the jump in a rehearsal Thursday night , Fidjestol stumbled headfirst into a snowbank and suffered a concussion . Norwegians toasted him with a Sterno-like drink , aquavit , and partied into Friday . Stein Gruben will take Fidjestol ' s place today .</TEXT>
