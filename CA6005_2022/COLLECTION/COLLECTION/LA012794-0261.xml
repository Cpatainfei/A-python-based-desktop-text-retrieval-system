   <HEADLINE> CALTRANS RULES_OUT QUICK-FIX FREEWAY BRIDGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Caltrans officials on Wednesday decided against quick-fix bridges that might have eased traffic congestion temporarily and will concentrate instead on full-fledged reconstruction , which they say will hasten the return of normal conditions on the Simi Valley and Santa Monica freeways . On the Simi Valley Freeway in Granada Hills , where Caltrans originally had planned to spend time and money on a temporary bridge , the agency instead will shore_up a two-foot sag in the westbound lanes . &quot; I can shore_up that bridge_deck in three or four days , &quot; Caltrans District Director Jerry Baxter said in an interview . Within a month , the shored-up lanes will be ready to serve as an interim bridge , carrying traffic in both directions until reconstruction of the eastbound lanes is completed , Baxter said . The eastbound lanes will then carry traffic in both directions until the westbound lanes are rebuilt . Baxter said reconstruction of the downed bridge on the Golden State Freeway in Gavin Canyon near Newhall will begin immediately , and it is hoped that a permanent replacement can be completed within six months . Meantime , he said , work is largely completed on a detour road around the Gavin Canyon bridge . Caltrans expects to open the detour by the weekend . A few miles to the south , where portions of the interchange between the Golden State Freeway and the Antelope Valley Freeway collapsed , restriping work to add a lane to the two northbound truck lanes from the Golden State Freeway to the Antelope Valley Freeway was completed Wednesday . &quot; We ' re hoping to get the southbound companion lanes done_by the weekend , &quot; Baxter said . &quot; But it ' s going_to be a choke point for some time. &quot; Traffic on the overall freeway system was down to about 75 % of normal Wednesday , apparently because people are using alternative routes . But traffic still crawled through the rush_hours , and there were other problems . One bright spot took_place in Sylmar , where a Metrolink station was opened Wednesday . Full reconstruction of the earthquake-damaged Santa Monica Freeway in the Wilshire District could be completed in less than six months , Baxter said . &quot; We are going_to push for six months because we think it can be done , &quot; Baxter said . &quot; If I was looking_at one year to replace the bridges , I would look hard at a temporary bridge . But if we can replace this in six months , a temporary bridge doesn ' t make sense. &quot; Although temporary bridges would have handled many of the thousands of cars now detoured along city streets , they would have prevented the simultaneous reconstruction of the eastbound and westbound lanes -- thus prolonging the entire project by at least three months , Baxter said . Accidents in the detour areas claimed the life of a truck_driver near Santa Clarita and hospitalized a woman whose speeding car hurtled off a ruptured segment of the Santa Monica Freeway and plunged into a ditch . The California Highway Patrol said the unidentified truck_driver died about 11 a.m. Wednesday when his truck overturned on the transition road from Placerita Canyon Road to Sierra Highway , one of the detours around the shattered junction of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways . Officers said the woman , Marciela Gutierrez , 30 , of Los Angeles , apparently did not realize that several bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway had crumbled in the quake . &quot; She mistakenly thought the temporary openings used by freeway construction crews were available to all motorists to enter the freeway at Venice Boulevard , &quot; CHP Officer Rhett Price said . He said the woman got_on the eastbound lanes of the freeway about 2:20 a.m. and accelerated rapidly , reaching a speed of about 60 m.p.h. before her small sedan vaulted into space , plunged 40 feet and overturned in a 10-foot-ditch . Price said Gutierrez , who suffered a broken thigh , ankle and wrist in the crash , was trapped in the wreckage until shortly before 5 a.m. , when a passing CHP unit spotted her car . She was later listed in stable condition at Kaiser Foundation Hospital in West Los Angeles . An estimated $ 1.9 billion in federal assistance is needed over the next year to pay_for freeway reconstruction and additional transit services , Linda Bohlinger , Metropolitan Transportation Authority financial coordinator , told the MTA board of directors on Wednesday . &quot; The big question is when do the feds declare the emergency over , &quot; she said . &quot; What happened in the Bay Area ( after the Loma Prieta quake ) is that emergency was tied only to the Bay Bridge . That was up and operating in two months , and their funding was cut_off . So we have concerns that we really need to be_on top of it . We need detailed documentation. &quot; Peter Hidalgo , a public information officer for Metrolink , said the rail_line between Santa Clarita and Downtown Los Angeles , which was carrying 950 passengers a day before the quake , is now carrying about 22 # 000 a day . He said the system ' s capacity will be expanded soon with the acquisition of additional passenger_cars . Eight are being leased from the Caltrans system in San Francisco , and the commuter rail system in Toronto , Canada , has been asked_for 25 more . At the opening ceremony for the Sylmar / San Fernando Metrolink station , Los Angeles City Councilmen Hal Bernson and Richard Alarcon were joined by officials from Metrolink , the Los Angeles Department_of_Transportation and the city of San Fernando . &quot; It took a disaster and a tragedy to get us here early , unfortunately , &quot; said Bernson , who had petitioned Metrolink officials to open the station ahead of its scheduled opening next month . Los Angeles police_officers commuting from Santa Clarita have been using the station quietly for the past three days , and 150 disembarked from the 5:43 a.m. train Wednesday . Riding_on later trains were several San Fernando city workers , employees of Olive View-UCLA Medical_Center and a handful of Valley commuters , who , despite limited publicity , heard about the station ' s opening , said an MTA official . Few riders boarded the Sylmar / San Fernando train , located at 1st and Hubbard streets , but by midmorning , about 340 people had arrived_at the station to make connections to other areas . Some companies provided shuttle service from the station for their employees . Commuters such_as Sherri Princell and Linda Cook , both medical_assistants , had no shuttle_buses waiting for them . Until the Sylmar station opening , the Santa Clarita residents took Metrolink to the Burbank station and rode MTA buses back to their Sherman Oaks office . &quot; The fact that this opened today is great , &quot; said Princell , whose round-trip commute Tuesday had taken eight hours . The yet-to-be-completed station lacked some amenities . Commuters leaving the train walked onto a platform poured just 13 hours earlier . They walked amid a throng of construction workers pouring still more concrete , drilling holes and clearing space to finish the station by Feb . 21 , the official opening date . Still under construction is the parking_lot , benches for commuters and the ticket_booth . A table cluttered with schedules and brochures served as the ticket counter . MTA officials handed commuters bus schedules and gave instructions on making connections . Alarcon , angered by the station ' s many delays , said that even though the station was nearing completion , he was dissatisfied with what he called the MTA ' s unfair treatment of northeast San Fernando Valley residents . &quot; We ' re the only station that ' s not open , &quot; Alarcon said . Meanwhile , in Van Nuys , Small Business Administration officials handed_out the first $ 2.5 million in disaster relief loans to 77 families whose homes were damaged in the earthquake . The first check went_to Eli Landaverde of Arleta , a 24-year-old stock clerk who picked_up the initial $ 10 # 000 installment of his $ 25 # 700 loan at the Mid San Fernando Valley Chamber_of_Commerce on Wednesday afternoon . &quot; It took like four days , &quot; said Landaverde . &quot; It was great. &quot; Zamichow is a Times staff writer and Willis is a special correspondent .
