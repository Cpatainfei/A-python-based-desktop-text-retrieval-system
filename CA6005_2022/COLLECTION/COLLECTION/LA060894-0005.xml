   <TEXT> STAGE No Tony , According to Jackie : Comedian Jackie Mason is returning his 1987 Tony for &quot; The World According to Me ! &quot; because he wasn ' t invited to appear on this year ' s awards show . In a sidewalk news_conference held Tuesday in front of the New York theater where he stars in &quot; Jackie Mason -- Politically Incorrect , &quot; the comedian said his decision to give_back the prize was made not only for himself but for &quot; all_the hard-working Broadway performers and artists who are not as fortunate as I am to have a hit show , a big mouth and the ability to do what is politically incorrect. &quot; The award was to be returned to the office of the League of American Theaters and Producers , which presents the Tonys along with the American Theater Wing . Tony spokesman Keith Sherman said the show ' s producer had to be selective despite intense pressure from Mason to appear on Sunday ' s show . &quot; There were a lot of stars who asked to be_on the show , &quot; Sherman said , adding jokingly : &quot; Our biggest worry is that Jackie ' s gesture will cause an avalanche of returned Tonys. &quot; TELEVISION ' Maverick ' Blackout : If the release of the film &quot; Maverick &quot; has made anyone consider looking_for the original TV series on home video , they ' ll be disappointed with the limited selection . Warner Bros. , which produced the 1957-1960 Western for ABC , is not releasing anything beyond the two episodes that came_out on video in 1992 . James Garner , who starred as Bret Maverick on ABC and plays lawman Zane Cooper in the motion_picture , said his understanding was that Mel Gibson insisted on the video blackout so as not to dilute demand for the film version and any possible sequels . A Warner Bros . spokesman confirmed the embargo but disputed that it was at Gibson ' s behest . * Bye-Bye , Berry : Twentieth Television has pulled the plug on its syndicated program &quot; The Bertice Berry Show , &quot; which aired locally on KTTV Channel 11 .

MOVIES Wilder ' s German Honors : Director Billy Wilder on Monday received the Goethe Medaille , an annual award from Los Angeles ' Goethe Institut honoring individuals living outside of Germany . Wilder , an Austrian immigrant , was recognized for his artistic contributions in his career , which began in Germany and later took him to Hollywood . Noting that he was a screenwriter before becoming a director , Wilder commented that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , Germany ' s famed poet for whom the institute and award are named , would have made a &quot; wonderful screenwriter &quot; for an entity called &quot; 18th Century Fox. &quot; &quot; His first hit would have been ' Faust , ' &quot; Wilder continued , &quot; and the studio would have been asking him , ' How about ' Faust II ' ? &quot; LEGAL FILE Parkinson ' s Suit : Longtime &quot; Price Is Right &quot; model Dian Parkinson made_good Monday on her threats to file a sexual_harassment lawsuit against the show ' s host , Bob Barker . Two weeks ago , the 70-year-old Barker waged a preemptive strike against Parkinson ' s charges , holding a press_conference to say that he did have intermittent sex with her but that it was consensual . He said Parkinson threatened an $ 8-million lawsuit when she left the show after 18 years , reportedly because of friction with other models . Parkinson ' s suit , which seeks unspecified damages , alleges Barker made sex a condition of her employment , in exchange for helping patch things up with those other models . * Quitting Time : Former Jefferson Airplane singer Grace Slick pleaded guilty Monday to pointing a shotgun at police_officers in March during a drunk rage at her Northern California home and promised a judge she ' ll give_up alcohol . Under a plea bargain , the 54-year-old singer agreed to attend three months of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings , perform 200 hours of community service , submit to random drug testing and abstain_from alcohol .
