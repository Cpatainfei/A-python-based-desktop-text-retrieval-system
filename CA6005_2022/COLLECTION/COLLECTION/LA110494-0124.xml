   <HEADLINE> THEATER BEAT : DEADPAN ' SENSITIVE ' HITS THE PARODY MARK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Psychobabble is raised to a fine_art in &quot; Sensitive People , &quot; Matthew Nelson ' s dead-on parody about the modern therapy movement . In Nelson ' s play , the members of a therapy group run_by Dr. Courtney ( Jane A . Rogers ) meet regularly at a local art_gallery . The setting might as well be a church . For these acolytes , self-analysis substitutes for spirituality . No matter that their moral musings are innately narcissistic , they got that old New Age religion . Into this cult of self-involvement blunders James , a regular guy who joins the group because he wants to date one of the female regulars . While the others grope to discover their inner females and discourse ad nauseam about their childhoods , James becomes increasingly exasperated , finally erupting into open rebellion against the systematic stupidity . To no avail . All James ' sarcasm and appeals_to logic cannot puncture the humorless sanctimony of these &quot; sensitive &quot; people , who eventually give the apostate his walking papers . Nelson , who also plays James , perfectly nails these oh-so-serious , oh-so-sensitive , oh-so-hilarious characters , whose spate of self-congratulatory double-talk seldom makes one ounce of sense . Director Daniel Rojo imposes an air of effective sobriety on the zaniness . The scrupulously deadpan cast , which also includes Tim Ahern , Ken Stephens , Janis Reno and Samantha Humphrey , are so somberly silly , they ' re scary . * &quot; Sensitive People , &quot; Hudson Backstage , 6539 Santa Monica Blvd. , Hollywood . Wednesdays-Thursdays , 8 p.m. Runs indefinitely . $ 12.50. ( 213 ) 660-8587 . Running time : 1 hour . Bond ' s ' Tuesday ' Stuffy at Academy As prolix as he is prolific , Edward Bond , former Angry Young_Man of the_British Theater , has metamorphosed over the years into Splenetic Old Curmudgeon . Bond ' s amorphous and repetitive &quot; Tuesday , &quot; an obscure polemic about a young soldier ' s futile struggles against a corrupt military-industrial bureaucracy , is overlong despite its brief running_time . The play may be inchoate , but Bond ' s program notes , written especially for this Los Angeles production , are pointed , the rantings of a determined socialist who still has a killer_bee in his bonnet over the collapse of the Soviet Bloc . Predicting imminent doom for America and ultimately for all_of Western civilization , Bond holds forth the hope of &quot; childhood courage &quot; to change the world and deplores the death of the &quot; Imagination. &quot; Some of the passion of Bond ' s manifesto trickles down into the play itself , but , unfortunately , so does Bond ' s self-importance and didacticism . Brian ( Kourosh Gohar ) , an AWOL soldier recently returned from war , seeks refuge with his girlfriend Irene ( Dana Kirk ) , a young student who is snapped out of her usual trance of complacency and acquiescence by Brian ' s flight and plight . John C . Slade plays Irene ' s bullying , ultimately craven father , who epitomizes why these particular adolescents should never trust anyone older than 30 . Bond ' s play is dated and stuffy , the soapbox oration of a burned-out radical preaching to the great unwashed . Further hampered by David Catanzarite ' s stodgy staging , the production remains oddly unformed , both in substance and execution , a directing-class version of a work-in-progress . * &quot; Tuesday , &quot; Academy Theatre at the Stella Adler Theatre , 6773 Hollywood Blvd. , Hollywood . Thursdays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. ; Sundays , 7:30 p.m. Ends Nov . 20 . $ 12- $ 15 . ( 213 ) 660-8587 . Running time : 1 hour , 15 minutes . F . KATHLEEN FOLEY</TEXT>
