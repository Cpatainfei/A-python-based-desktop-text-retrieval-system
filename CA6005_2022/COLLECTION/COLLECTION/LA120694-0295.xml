   <TEXT> If all goes well , Katherine Elena Roderick will get parents for Christmas . A toddler from Siberia with eyes that remind her mother-to-be of Elizabeth Taylor ' s , she could also be one of the last Russian children to be adopted by Americans for some time . Although recent news_stories predicting a Dec . 1 suspension of foreign adoptions proved incorrect , Russia is expected to enact a law that could reduce substantially , if not stanch for months , the stream of children who have become some of the former Soviet_Union ' s most sought-after exports to the West . More_than 3 # 000 Russian children have been adopted by Americans since the Soviet_Union crumbled in 1991 ; more_than half of them in the year that ended Sept . 30 , according to State_Department figures . Taken together , the former Soviet republics have edged out South_Korea as the primary foreign source for American adoptions . For an estimated 1 # 000 Americans currently trying to adopt Russians -- and perhaps many_more who have been contemplating such a step -- this is a time of high anxiety . &quot; I ' d have to say it ' s been an emotional roller_coaster , &quot; said Debby Zielinski of Old Forge , Pa . She and her husband already suffered bitter disappointment when , after being matched with an 18-month-old boy in Crimea , the government in that semiautonomous region slapped a moratorium on foreign adoptions in July . Now the Zielinskis have chosen another boy , from Moscow , and have been told by their adoption agency to be ready to travel in a_few weeks . Since the lower house of the Russian parliament passed the adoption law Nov . 18 ( it must still pass the upper house and be signed by President Boris Yeltsin to take_effect ) , American agencies have been trying to expedite cases already in the pipeline . &quot; I am trying to send as_many people to Russia as I possibly can , &quot; said Larisa Mason , head of the International Assistance Group in Pittsburgh , which has arranged 125 Russian adoptions and is handling more_than 100 now . Paula and John Roderick left Thursday on a grueling journey to an orphanage in Birobidzhan in Russia ' s remote northeast . There they hope to claim the girl to whose birth name , Elena , they have already added another , Katherine . Interviewed before their departure , Paula Roderick expressed confidence that they would have the 14-month-old girl in their suburban Alexandria , Va. , home for the holidays . From the time the adoption agency showed us &quot; one little bitty picture , a color Xerox of a Polaroid . . . she ' s been our daughter , &quot; Roderick said . &quot; She looks_like she has Elizabeth Taylor ' s eyes . Her eyes are so blue they ' re almost violet . &quot; We didn ' t pick her . God did . Becoming a parent is a leap of faith to begin with , whether the child is biological or adoptive. &quot; Faith , optimism , patience and a certain fatalism were expressed by nearly a dozen prospective parents interviewed as they waited in limbo for final approvals in both countries . For most , the new uncertainties of Russian adoption seemed far outweighed by the ordeals they had already suffered trying to conceive children or adopt in the United States . One California woman , who asked that her name not be used , said she wanted a Russian child so she could &quot; refocus the love &quot; she had given to a daughter who died of E . coli infection during the bacteria outbreak two years ago . &quot; Nothing in life will ever set me back so_much again , &quot; she said . &quot; If this adoption is meant to happen , it will happen . I can offer this ( Russian ) child so_much and this child can offer us so much. &quot; Of about 60 # 000 adoptions by Americans in the year ending in September , about 14 % ( 8 # 195 ) were from foreign countries , according to the State_Department . But foreign children accounted_for nearly 17 % of adoptions of children younger than 2 , estimated William Pierce , president of the National Council for Adoption , an advocacy group based in Washington . Americans are turning_to foreign countries to avoid long waits in this country , opposition to interracial adoption , and the fear that biological parents may change their minds and demand their children back . For single parents , gay couples and those older than 40 , adoption agency officials added , a foreign adoption is often the only kind possible . Since the fall of Communism , Americans have been drawn to Russia and other Eastern European_countries because of the numbers of white children living_in orphanages , often in dire conditions . But what looks_like love and altruism from an American perspective often appears quite different in countries that not long ago saw themselves as equal in stature to the West . &quot; Any time we identify the No . 1 country sending kids to the United States , it immediately becomes a matter of national disgrace for that country , &quot; Pierce said . There have been backlashes against American adoptions in Romania , which in 1991 sent more_than 2 # 500 children to the United States , and in South and Central_America . In Guatemala , villagers , outraged by rumors of baby-selling for organ transplants , bludgeoned a 51-year-old Alaskan woman into a coma earlier this year . * Nothing so grim has happened in Russia , but nationalistic feelings have risen , along with anger at the large sums_of_money -- up_to $ 25 # 000 -- Americans are willing to spend to take_home Russian kids . While most of the money goes_for legitimate expenses and gifts to orphanages , Russian middlemen , or &quot; facilitators &quot; as they are known , have been caught paying bribes and forging documents . The new Russian law is intended to curtail abuses by transferring decision-making powers from orphanage directors and local officials to a central agency equipped with a computer data base of all children available for adoption . But with more_than 200 # 000 children in institutions and a faltering economy , many wonder whether Russia can create such a system . &quot; They don ' t even have fax machines or adequate food , &quot; said Linda Crumpecker , the adoptive mother of a Russian boy and the chairman of Families for Russian and Ukrainian Adoption , a Washington-based support group with 250 members . If the law is passed , &quot; there could be a substantial delay &quot; in adoptions , said Mason , who is encouraging new clients to consider children from other former Soviet republics , such_as Uzbekistan . &quot; Nobody knows how the law will work because no structure is in place to make_it work. &quot; Janice Pearse , director of Adoptions Together , a Baltimore , Md. , agency that has placed more_than 100 children from the former Soviet_Union , said it was unclear whether Moscow and some_other areas might be excluded from the central organization . &quot; We ' ve had many calls from our waiting families asking whether they should switch programs . We have encouraged them to hang_in there , &quot; she said . A State_Department recording ( ( 202 ) 647-3444 ) advises Americans that adoptions could be suspended for as long as eight months once the law is enacted . It cautions parents to &quot; be sure their cases will be allowed to be processed to completion &quot; before traveling_to Russia . * An earlier advisory from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow predicting a Dec . 1 suspension of adoptions caused a furor in the adoption community . &quot; We think the U.S. Embassy jumped the gun in its efforts to protect families and caused immeasurable anxiety for thousands of people , &quot; said Linda Perilstein , executive_director of Cradle of Hope , a Washington agency that has arranged 320 Russian adoptions and is currently handling 30 . Meanwhile , her clients are trying to stay calm . &quot; We ' re stuck_in the middle right now , &quot; said Kathy Locraft of Herndon , Va . &quot; The State_Department tells me one thing , the agency tells me another . &quot; It helps that we had to deal with the bureaucracy there and here before , &quot; said Locraft , who has a 5-year-old adopted from the Ukraine as well as a biological child of 7 . For the Rodericks , Katherine Elena would be their first child . &quot; I ' m 44 years old and my husband will be 50 in January , &quot; Paula Roderick said . &quot; It ' s hard to believe after you try_for so_long and have so many disappointments and heartbreaks . You ' re almost afraid to hope . Then all_of a sudden you see the picture of your child. &quot;</TEXT>
