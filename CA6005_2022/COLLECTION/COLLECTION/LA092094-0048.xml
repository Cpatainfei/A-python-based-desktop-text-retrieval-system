   <HEADLINE> WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY ; RULES LEAVE BONALY UP IN AIR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The CBS search for sports programming to fill its lost weekends , liberalized eligibility rules that have given Brian Boitano , Kristi Yamaguchi and others new competitive life and , of course , the Tonya vs . Nancy afterglow are dynamics that have combined to create more opportunities for more figure skaters than ever . But the tug-of-war among traditional governing bodies , independent promoters , television networks and agents for the sport ' s few marketable names , such_as Boitano and Yamaguchi , has also created more confusion than ever . For example , try to figure_out the status of France ' s Surya Bonaly . The French federation announced last month that Bonaly , the four-time European champion and 1994 world championships silver medalist , would compete in the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn. ' s annual invitational , Skate America , Oct . 27-30 in Pittsburgh . But Bonaly ' s agent , Michael Rosenberg of Palm Desert , recently announced that she will open her season in a professional competition Oct . 1 in Sun Valley , Ida . If Bonaly competes in Idaho , she will not be eligible for Skate America because the Sun Valley event , promoted by Michael Berg , is not sanctioned by the USFSA . The USFSA , however , has begun negotiations that could result in Berg ' s receiving a sanction . That would free Bonaly to compete in Skate America . But , Rosenberg announced , Bonaly also is entered in an unsanctioned professional competition in Cleveland on Oct . 19 . Negotiations between its promoter , Dick Button , and the USFSA are not as likely to result in sanctioning , so Bonaly again would be out of Skate America . Of course , if Bonaly chooses to compete in events that do not have the blessing of the USFSA , she could still apply for reinstatement to the International Skating Union that would allow her to compete in the 1998 Winter_Olympics . Then again . . . . She must first submit her application to French federation officials , and they say that they will not pass it on to the ISU if she competes this season in unsanctioned events . ISU council_members , including USFSA President Claire Ferguson , met over the weekend in Zurich , Switzerland , in an attempt to restore order . They should suspend all eligibility rules for one year , which would give interested parties an opportunity to sit_down with each other and decide the best course for the sport and its athletes . One can only hope they would exhibit more vision than the parties involved in the baseball strike . * Along with Gwen Torrence in the 200 , Jackie Joyner-Kersee was one of only two U.S. women to lead individual events in this year ' s outdoor track_and_field listings . But although she was first in the long_jump , she dropped to third in an event she has dominated in recent years -- the heptathlon -- behind two Germans , Heike Drechsler and Sabine Braun . Competing in her first heptathlon in 13 years , Drechsler was the world leader with the 6 # 741 points that she scored two weeks ago in Talence , France . Asked if she is setting her sights on Joyner-Kersee ' s world_record of 7 # 291 , Drechsler said , &quot; One never knows . If I ' m motivated. &quot; She was motivated to compete in Talence by a $ 30 # 000 appearance fee . * Track_and_field ' s male athlete of the year : Is it Great Britain ' s Colin Jackson , who won all 20 110-meter hurdles_races he entered , or Algeria ' s Noureddine Morceli , world leader in the 1 # 500 , the 3 # 000 and the mile ? . . . U.S. athletes showed so little interest in track_and_field ' s recent World Cup in London that International Amateur Athletic Federation President Primo Nebiolo says they might not have a separate team in future events . They would have to qualify as part of a team representing the Americas . * The U.S. Gymnastics Federation is waiting to hear whether two-time world all-around champion Shannon Miller will try to represent the United States in the Nov . 11-20 world team championships in Dortmund , Germany . Miller ' s coach , Steve Nunno , said previously that she needs a break after finishing second in the all-around in her two most recent competitions , the Goodwill Games and the U.S. championships . If Miller decides she wants to compete in Dortmund , she must qualify for the U.S. team in an Oct . 15-16 meet in Richmond , Va . * Chinese sports officials win the gold medal for double_standards . After lecturing International Olympic Committee_members last year about not allowing politics to interfere with sports in the vote for the site of the 2000 Summer Olympics , the Chinese threatened to boycott next month ' s Asian Games in Hiroshima if Japanese authorities allowed Taiwan ' s president , Lee Teng-hui , to enter the country for the opening ceremony . Taiwan announced Monday that Vice Premier Hsu Li-teh will attend instead . World Scene Notes For relinquishing her place in the 200-meter freestyle final to compatriot Franziska van Almsick , who subsequently set a world_record , Germany ' s Dagmar Hase was rewarded with a $ 2 # 000 plane_ticket and an expenses-paid , 15-day vacation in the country of her choice by Lufthansa Airlines . &quot; I don ' t know whether to laugh or cry , &quot; Hase said . . . . U.S. speedskaters Dan Jansen and Bonnie Blair were supposed to end their careers together in next February ' s world sprint championships in Milwaukee . But Jansen has already retired , and he ' s telling friends he believes Blair will decide to continue competing until someone can consistently beat her . . . . The IOC site selection committee that will visit 10 cities bidding for the 2002 Winter_Olympics arrived Sunday at its first stop , Salt_Lake_City . The committee will cut the field to four in January .</TEXT>
