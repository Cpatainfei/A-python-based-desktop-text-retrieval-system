   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / RICHARD ROTHSTEIN : FAIR WAGES AND STANDARDS SPUR GROWTH ; WORKERS ' RIGHTS SHOULDN ' T BE ABANDONED IN GATT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Morocco on Friday , the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round will conclude when representatives of 121 nations initiate a new_World Trade Organization . The deal almost fell_through last week -- not because of last winter ' s high-profile issues like European restrictions on American films or subsidies for French farmers , but because of new demands by the Clinton_Administration for negotiations on &quot; international worker rights. &quot; President Clinton ' s insistence that developing nations enforce minimum-wage laws , abolish child labor and permit union organization goes beyond traditional concerns that low-wage imports destroy low-wage jobs at_home . Rather , Clinton argues that American high-wage jobs won ' t expand without higher wages abroad : If Third_World workers earn too_little , they can ' t purchase what we make , annihilating purported benefits of free_trade . Barely reported in the United States , this initiative has caused a furor in Europe and the Third_World . European Union trade minister Sir Leon Brittan denounced its &quot; protectionism. &quot; Two weeks ago , developing nations rejected the U.S. demands , threatening the entire GATT deal . Leading the resistance was India , whose GATT ambassador claimed that restrictions on labor exploitation could undo seven years of progress . But India comes_to the debate with a record that illustrates why Clinton is_on the right track . India ' s largest export industry is now handwoven carpets , manufactured by 300 # 000 children between 6 and 15 , often mortgaged by their parents to employers . India was not always a carpet exporter . Its industry developed after 1970 , when the shah of Iran prohibited child labor in his own country , causing carpet manufacture to migrate to Asia , where children could still be exploited . In India , carpets are made mostly in Uttar Pradesh , which adopted a &quot; Child Labour Abolition and Regulation Act &quot; in 1986 . Yet not one employer has since been prosecuted for child labor abuses . In neighboring Pakistan , which shares_in the carpet boom , about half of the children working in carpet factories die from malnutrition and disease before age 12 , according to the International_Labor_Organization . One reason parents never redeem their children ' s mortgages is accumulating debts to employers for amphetamines that enable children to work long into the night . Such is the development path that India decries Clinton ' s attempt to destroy . Another opponent of labor standards has been Malaysia , which also comes_to these debates without clean hands . At the behest of U.S. and Japanese electronics manufacturers , it prohibited electronics-workers ' unions . And with no minimum-wage law , Malaysia grew in the 1980s to be the world ' s largest semiconductor exporter . Texas Instruments , Intel and National Semiconductor paid Malaysian girls 45 cents an hour for unskilled work . The Malaysian American Electronics_Industry Society said member firms would move if unions were authorized . It ' s too_bad that Malaysia doesn ' t welcome the Clinton initiative to protect it from such blackmail . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor last week responded to critics who argue that sweatshops and child labor are part of development and that only economic_growth unhindered by regulation can eventually raise standards . Kantor noted that U.S. wages began to increase and child labor was abolished not as the evolutionary consequence of development , but after decades of bitter political conflict . From 1917 to 1938 , the Supreme Court repeatedly struck_down minimum-wage and child-labor laws . Only after popular agitation and the appointment by Franklin_Roosevelt of sympathetic justices were we able to prohibit child labor in factories and establish minimum-wage rules . While Kantor was speaking in Washington , a compromise was worked_out , allowing the Morocco meeting to proceed . It was agreed that labor-standards discussion will come later . If Clinton and Kantor are able to follow up , we may escape_from our worldwide downward wage spiral in which nations ( not only Iran , India and Malaysia , but also the United States ) have to compete for investment with promises of ever lower wages and worker protections . As Clinton pointed_out in Brussels in January , &quot; If we ' re going to open our borders and trade more and invest more with developing nations , we want to know that their working people will receive some of the benefits . . . Otherwise , they won ' t have increasing incomes , and they won ' t be able to buy our products and services. &quot; Labor standards are not protectionist . They ' re an essential ingredient of worldwide economic_growth .</TEXT>
