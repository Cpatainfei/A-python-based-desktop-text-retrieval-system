   <HEADLINE> FRENCH OPEN / MEN ' S SEMIFINALS ; BRUGUERA can ' t SNEAK_UP ON COURIER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A year ago , Sergi Bruguera was an unheralded , unappreciated and largely unsuccessful player who came_to the_French Open and wound_up showing two-time and defending champion Jim Courier the door . In a 3-hour 59-minute final , Bruguera outlasted Courier , 6-4 , 2-6 , 6-2 , 3-6 , 6-3 , for his only Grand_Slam tournament title . Today , Courier gets a chance to return the favor when they meet in a men ' s semifinal at Roland Garros Stadium . The other semifinal features two lesser-known players . Bruguera ' s fellow Spaniard , 20th-ranked Alberto Berasategui , will play No . 46 Magnus Larsson of Sweden . The Bruguera-Courier matchup pits two of the world ' s best clay-court players , although they are ranked sixth and seventh , respectively . Bruguera , as does Berasategui , concentrates_on clay tournaments . Courier , despite his drop_in the rankings this year , is dangerous on all surfaces . They begin today ' s match with impressive quarterfinal victories over higher-ranked opponents . Courier defeated top-ranked Pete Sampras , who was trying to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four major tennis titles at_the_same_time . Courier ' s four-set victory was followed by Bruguera ' s defeat of No . 4 Andrei Medvedev . Bruguera has yet to drop a set , effectively using a powerful spinning forehand that opponents have trouble returning on the slow red_clay . &quot; It ' s almost impossible to explain what I felt , &quot; Bruguera said of last year ' s victory . &quot; I was in heaven for a moment. &quot; Now the moment is over . Bruguera said he played better last year , before he had to bear the added pressure of being defending champion . &quot; It is much tougher to play ( this year ) , &quot; he said , &quot; Sometimes ( I ) can ' t sleep well. &quot; The other semifinalists should not be having those problems . Few knew much about Berasategui and Larsson when the tournament began 12 days ago . Still , Berasategui , 20 , of Barcelona , was considered a player who could succeed on the clay at Paris , even though this is only his fourth Grand_Slam event . Larsson is playing in his 17th Grand_Slam tournament , but has never advanced this far . He survived a five-set match against Henrik Dreekmann of Germany to reach the semifinals . Berasategui routed No . 5 Goran Ivanisevic in straight sets_in the quarterfinals .</TEXT>
