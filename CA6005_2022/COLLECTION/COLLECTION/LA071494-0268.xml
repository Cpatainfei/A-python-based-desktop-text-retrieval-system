   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; BULGARIA BLAMES FRENCH RESISTANCE ; OFFICIATING : REFEREE ACCUSED OF BIAS BECAUSE OF HIS NATIONALITY ; BULGARIA BEAT FRANCE IN DECISIVE CUP QUALIFIER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After it was over , after Bulgaria ' s dream machine was left broken and battered in a 2-1 semifinal loss to Italy , Hristo Stoitchkov was asked if God was still a Bulgarian . &quot; Yes , &quot; the temperamental striker said . &quot; But the referee was French. &quot; And in soccer , that might mean more . At least it did to Bulgaria on Wednesday at the Meadowlands where the World Cup ' s surprise team finally met a match it did not like . Everyone wearing the white , green and red of Bulgaria thought Joel Quiniou , the referee , not Italy , was the problem . The consensus from coach to players to the Bulgarian press was Quiniou missed two crucial calls_in the second_half that would have given Bulgaria a good chance to send the game into overtime . &quot; Today it was again proven the officiating of this World Cup was among the weakest in the history of World Cups , &quot; said Stoitchkov , who was replaced in the 79th minute because of a slight leg injury . Perhaps it was East European suspicions left over from the Cold_War , but the Bulgarians had reason to question the choice of Quiniou as their referee . After all , it was last November in Paris that Emil Kostadinov scored in the last minute to eliminate France from World Cup ' 94 . &quot; I don ' t think it was a mere coincidence that this referee was chosen , &quot; Stoitchkov said . Kostadinov was involved in the first controversial play midway through the second_half when he dribbled through the Italian defense into the penalty_box . The ball took a high bounce and hit Alessandro Costacurta ' s hand . Kostadinov said it was intentional . Quiniou did not see it that way , and he probably was right . When the ball accidentally hits a defender ' s hand , play continues . Otherwise , Bulgaria would have earned a penalty kick . &quot; The referee had the whistle in his mouth , and then he looked_at the linesman and changed his mind about blowing the whistle , &quot; said Borislav Mihaylov , Bulgaria ' s goalkeeper . The second controversial play came_near the match ' s end when Yordan Letchkov collided_with Roberto Mussi on the right side of the goal . Bulgaria wanted a free_kick , but Quiniou did nothing . Both players were going_for the ball and it was difficult to determine if a foul was committed . Coach Dimitar Penev of Bulgaria thought his team deserved one call , if not both . &quot; Two is too_much , &quot; he said . &quot; Maybe one would have been fair. &quot; Bulgaria ' s defeat did not detract from its brilliant performance in the tournament ; it has a chance to finish third in the world . Its sudden rise in international soccer still is difficult to fathom . Nine years ago , it seemed Bulgaria would never develop a serious soccer program . During a 1985 match pitting Levsky Sofia against CSKA , the army team , a riot broke_out when players , coaches and fans charged the Communist regime fixed the game in CSKA ' s favor . While fans brawled in the stands , Stoitchkov and CSKA teammate Nasko Sirakov fought with Mihaylov in the tunnel leading to the locker_rooms . They were suspended for life but reinstated after seven months -- in time for World Cup qualifying in 1986 . The hard feelings have never ceased , but the three have been instrumental in leading the 1994 national team . A bigger obstacle was gaining international experience until the breakup of Communist East Europe . Sirakov , Bulgaria ' s leading scorer in last year ' s club league , was the first to play abroad . Soon , others followed and more_than half of the World Cup team is playing in West Europe now . &quot; We don ' t have to worry about what the government says anymore , &quot; Mihaylov said . &quot; That has been the secret. &quot; Now there are other problems , namely , money . After Bulgaria ' s victory over France in Cup qualifying , federation president Valentine Mihov offered $ 100 # 000 bonuses to players . The federation was unable to deliver , which caused an uproar on the eve of the World Cup . Players were mollified with $ 25 # 000 bonuses , but not before Mihov was forced to resign a_few weeks before the Cup . &quot; Everything ' s settled now , &quot; said Hristo Danov , federation vice_president . Everything except that French referee .</TEXT>
