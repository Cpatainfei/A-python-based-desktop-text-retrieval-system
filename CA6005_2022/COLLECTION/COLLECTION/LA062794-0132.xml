   <HEADLINE> SMOKING-RELATED DEATHS DOWN , BUT NEVADA LEADS U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nevada leads the nation in the rate of smoking-related deaths , while the Mormon_Church ' s prohibition against using tobacco keeps Utah relatively smoke-free . Overall , smoking-related deaths are declining . These were some of the conclusions of the government ' s first state-by-state look in five years at cigarette smoking , the single most preventable cause of premature death in the United States . The Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention analyzed deaths in 1990 , and found that 20 % , or 415 # 226 , were caused by smoking . A 1988 estimate found that 434 # 000 people died from smoking-related causes . Improvements in the emergency care of heart_attacks and strokes and better treatment for cardiovascular_diseases offset a slight increase in lung_cancer deaths , said Mike Siegel , an epidemiologist in the CDC Office on Smoking and Health . &quot; Only a small percentage could be_due to a drop_in the smoking rate , &quot; Siegel said . The CDC looked_at each state ' s deaths from cancer , cardiovascular and respiratory conditions , infant diseases and burn deaths caused by smoking . The agency then used formulas based on the prevalence or percentage of adults who smoke , and on risks of health_problems among current and ex-smokers , compared to nonsmokers . Smoking took its heaviest toll in Nevada , where 24 % of all deaths in 1990 were blamed on tobacco use . The CDC linked 2 # 234 Nevada deaths to smoking , for a smoking-related death rate of 478.1 per 100 # 000 people . Nevada ' s rates may be attributable in part to its large_number of retirees ; 80 % of its residents were born elsewhere , said Willie Edwards , the Nevada Health Department ' s first tobacco education and information officer . Despite Nevada ' s &quot; live and let live &quot; attitude , the state is responding to anti-smoking pressures from tourists , who want their casinos and restaurants smoke-free , Edwards said . Pressure of another kind led to the nation ' s lowest smoking-related death rate next door in Utah . Just 1 # 228 people died from smoking in 1990 , 13.4 % of the state ' s total , for a mortality_rate of 218 per 100 # 000 people . Mormons account_for 70 % of Utah ' s population , giving them a huge influence on smoking prevention , according to John Brockert , the state ' s director of vital statistics .</TEXT>
