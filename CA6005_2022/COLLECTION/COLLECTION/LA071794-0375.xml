   <HEADLINE> INSECTICIDES BLAMED IN DEATHS OF 17 BALD EAGLES IN WISCONSIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An insecticide killed 17 bald_eagles found recently in northwestern Wisconsin , state and federal_officials said . Tests conducted on the birds at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Laboratory in Ashland , Ore. , found traces of Carbofuran , a pesticide used to kill worms in corn , strawberries and potatoes . Wildlife service officials declined to say whether they believe the eagle poisonings were intentional . But that type of pesticide is not generally used this early in the growing season , and there is little vegetable crop production in Burnett County ' s Fish Lake area , where the birds died , authorities said . Authorities said the eagles and other animals probably died immediately after ingesting the pesticide . The wildlife service and the state_Department of Natural_Resources is offering a reward of up_to $ 5 # 000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone who caused the eagle deaths . Bald eagles are no longer on the brink of extinction as they were decades ago . But the birds remain on state and federal threatened species lists , in part because of poisoning , shooting , trapping and the destruction of their forest habitat , officials said . Overall , the bird ' s population here in the state has steadily climbed from a low of 82 active nesting pairs in 1970 to 464 nesting pairs in 1993 , officials said .</TEXT>
