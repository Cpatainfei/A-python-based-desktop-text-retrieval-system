   <TEXT> The Volkswagen Beetle , the much-loved and fondly remembered car that disappeared from auto showrooms more_than a decade ago , may be coming_back to U.S. markets . If Americans like the idea , a sleek futuristic version -- complete with convertible top and environmental controls -- could be sold in the United States as early as 1997 . The German auto_maker is tapping into American nostalgia to reverse a sharp decline in its overall U.S. sales , which totaled only about 50 # 000 cars in the United States last year -- down from more_than 10 times that in 1970 when the Beetle was a hot seller . At Ray Fladeboe Volkswagen in the Irvine Auto Center , sales manager Woody Woodward said he was getting_at least 10 calls a day from buyers interested in the updated Beetle . &quot; I think it ' s going_to be an incredible hit , especially in Orange County , &quot; said Woodward . &quot; There are a lot of young , successful people here and this is an affordable convertible . It ' s a fun car and there is some nostaglia involved. &quot; Meanwhile , Volkswagen officials parlayed the news about the updated Beetle -- called the Concept 1 Cabriolet -- to promote its new Golf and Jetta models at a news_conference Tuesday . Clive Varlo , president and chief_executive of Volkswagen of America , acknowledged the steep decline in Volkswagen sales . It has been &quot; difficult to sit and watch -- it ' s been a great disappointment to me , &quot; he said , adding he expected the situation to improve . The Volkswagen Beetle was pulled from the U.S. market after costly air_pollution and safety requirements made_it obsolete . The company hopes to price the latest model between $ 12 # 000- $ 13 # 000 to make_it attractive to U.S. buyers . Volkswagen still sells 400 a day in Mexico and Brazil . The marketing strategy could fail if the American consumer tires of nostalgia before the new Beetle returns , one analyst said . &quot; I guess the question then becomes , ' Will the retro look be totally passe ? ' &quot; said Joseph Phillippi of Lehman Brothers Inc .</TEXT>
