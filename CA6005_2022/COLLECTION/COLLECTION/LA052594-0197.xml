   <HEADLINE> SMUGGLERS FIND LOOPHOLE TO SAIL THROUGH IN HAITI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Five of them sit at the pier , ships of all measure , varying from 70 feet to seven times that size . Some fly the Haitian flag , one the_British ensign , and some fly no flags at all . They all have one thing in common : They defy the world . From the Leo , an anchorless rust bucket recently pulled from the beach where it had run_aground , to the British-flagged Oakleigh , all have run a U.N. embargo to bring_in tens of thousands of gallons of banned fuel_oil -- even , in at least one case , in the face of warning shots from U.S. enforcers . Pentagon officials said Tuesday in Washington that 14 ships heading for Haiti had been diverted since the embargo went_into effect over the weekend . But other ships keep coming . Jacmel , a resort created as a faux French seaside village by early 19th-Century coffee magnates , has become the center of the Haitian military ' s effort to break the international sanctions ordered to force the army from power . &quot; The border is still a serious problem , &quot; a diplomat said of the frontier between Haiti and the Dominican_Republic , &quot; and lots of gas comes_through , but the biggest threat is now the sea. &quot; Under threat is the strategy by the United Nations and the United States to use a near-total embargo to end military rule and restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , who was driven from office Sept . 20 , 1991 , after seven months as Haiti ' s only democratically elected president . &quot; If we can ' t stop smuggling , especially from the D . R. , then the embargo is not only a failure , it is stupid , &quot; the diplomat said . &quot; Ships come all_the time , &quot; said a foreign resident who has lived here for more_than 20 years . &quot; They unload barrels of gas , or they just pump it out into truck tankers , all_in plain sight of the choppers. &quot; The choppers are U.S. naval and Coast Guard helicopters flying from the 10-ship international flotilla that is supposed to enforce the embargo , which was widened at midnight Saturday to include all goods except food and humanitarian items . According to Jacmel residents , who have little else to do but monitor the comings and goings of the little harbor here , only one ship has been successfully turned_back here , a vessel that made_it into the harbor but fled when the Coast Guard radioed that it would be seized if it sailed out empty . Another ship received the same warning but unloaded its cargo anyway . The captain , who called himself Dirty Harry , simply anchored the ship in the bay and abandoned it . He and the crew returned to the Dominican_Republic overland , residents here said . On Sunday , a 70-foot freighter called the Sea Search also ignored that warning -- as well as two cannon bursts across the bow from a Coast Guard cutter -- and tied_up at the pier . The Pentagon officials said that another ship sailing near Haiti ' s north coast was intercepted and boarded by U.S. officials Monday and was still being searched Tuesday . The Sea Search , however , was unloading barrels of fuel Monday under the supervision of at least two Haitian army_officers and in_full_view of reporters and other guests at a nearby hotel . As a result of the sieve-like blockade and a U.S. policy not to use deadly force , diplomats and other experts say , Jacmel receives upward of 40 % of the estimated 4 million gallons of gasoline being smuggled into Haiti . The most notorious ship is the Oakleigh , a 500-foot tanker that lists its home port as Aberdeen , Scotland . Monitors say it comes from the Dominican_Republic every_other day to unload at least 50 # 000 gallons each time . One day over the weekend , nine tanker trucks lined_up in broad daylight in Jacmel to offload fuel to be taken_to the capital , Port-au-Prince , a two-hour drive to the southwest . There it is sold on the street for about $ 10 a gallon . Most of the smuggling , diplomats and Haitian business people say , is controlled by Gerard Caroli , a local businessman and close associate of Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois . Another Francois link to the smuggling is an army major known as Oiseau -- French for Bird -- who commands the Jacmel police and uses the force as his personal booty-gatherers . Oiseau recently salvaged the wrecked Leo from the beach in front of one of Jacmel ' s many sleazy seaside bars , got_it running and joined in the parade to and from the Dominican_Republic . While far and away the most important aspect of the smuggling , fuel is not the only product unloaded here . One ship this past week brought_in thousands of bicycles , another a load of televisions and stereo equipment , &quot; all from Miami , &quot; according to one witness .</TEXT>
