   <HEADLINE> CAPITOL JOURNAL : THE SAVVY AND FOLLIES OF A MAN OF PARADOXES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The only time I interviewed Richard Nixon , one-on-one , press secretary Ron Ziegler pointed to my tape_recorder as we approached the Oval Office and warned , &quot; He ' ll go right up the wall if he sees that. &quot; Being young and not willing to risk a scene with the leader of the free_world , I quickly stashed the recorder in Ziegler ' s office . A few years later , of course , I and everybody else learned that Nixon himself secretly had been recording all his conversations in the Oval Office . I ' d witnessed an example of what former Nixon aide John D . Ehrlichman has called the &quot; strange collection of paradoxes &quot; of this complex man , a native Californian who walked on the beach in wingtip shoes . Nixon would go_to the beach at San Clemente for a vacation and spend several hours each day working . As a grunt reporter assisting UPI ' s two White_House correspondents , I found the President ' s daily drill both admirable and annoying . It was annoying because the seemingly endless meetings with Cabinet secretaries , the photo-ops and his penchant for mingling with local citizens cut_into a reporter ' s beach time . The contrast could not have been greater covering Ronald Reagan many years later in Santa Barbara . Reagan wanted little to do with his staff and absolutely no contact with reporters , except for the annual summer party at a neutral site . Work merely interfered with this President ' s main agenda , which was to ride horses , chop wood and , perhaps , toss snakes from his ranch pond . Unlike Nixon , Reagan knew how to relax and appreciated its value . * Nervous Nixon saw enemies everywhere . And initially in his presidency , he perceived one to be Gov . Reagan , who had fought him for the Republican nomination in 1968 . A year later , I casually mentioned Reagan ' s name to Nixon as he walked me to the door after my interview . The President froze , as if he were a cat suddenly sensing an intruder . His ears were alert for information , but he scarcely spoke . &quot; He was scared to death Reagan would run in ' 72 , &quot; recalls Ken Khachigian , a Nixon speech writer . Reagan did not , of course , and the two became good political friends . In 1980 , after Reagan had won the nomination , Nixon occasionally slipped him advice . But Nixon realized that public_knowledge of these efforts only would hurt Reagan . So he devised a clandestine delivery system . His aide would pass an envelope to Khachigian in a bar and Khachigian would transfer it to Reagan confidant Mike Deaver . &quot; The old_man would give him big picture advice , like ' Here ' s what should come_out of the debate , ' &quot; says Khachigian , who also became a Reagan speech writer . Nixon always had respected Reagan ' s political talents , but as Watergate erupted he also came_to admire his fidelity . &quot; Reagan never turned his back on him , which was a loyalty Nixon appreciated , &quot; says former Rep . Patrick J . Hillings , who succeeded Nixon in the House and was a close friend . This appreciation of loyalty brings us back to paradox . No men were more loyal or closer to Nixon over the years than two fellow Californians : Robert H . Finch , his HEW secretary , and Herbert G . Klein , the White_House communications director . Yet , after finally winning the presidency , the &quot; new Nixon &quot; diminished their influence and allowed relative newcomers H . R . Haldeman and Ehrlichman -- among others -- to push them around . And , as we know , the results were disastrous for Nixon . * Nixon had a big impact on California politics simply by launching so many careers : Finch , elected lieutenant_governor ; former Reps . Hillings , John H . Rousselot , Bob Wilson ; political consultants Khachigian , Stu Spencer . . . and Gov . Pete Wilson . Nixon gave Wilson his first political job -- as an advance man in his failed 1962 gubernatorial campaign . In fact , Wilson was out_in the car waiting to drive the defeated candidate home as Nixon bitterly was holding his infamous &quot; last press conference. &quot; Three years later , Nixon offered Wilson a much bigger job -- then talked him out of taking it . Nixon confided that he was planning to run_for President in 1968 and asked Wilson to join him in New York as a top political aide , organizing his schedule . Wilson mentioned he ' d also been thinking_about running_for something , the state Assembly . &quot; He looked me right in the eye , &quot; Wilson recalls . &quot; ' What kind of a district ? What ' s the registration ? Can you win it ? ' ' I think I can. ' He smiled and said , ' You want to do this don ' t you ? ' ' I think so. ' ' Then you ' d better . Otherwise , you ' ll spend the rest of your life kicking yourself. ' &quot; Wilson took Nixon ' s advice . This was fortunate for the future governor . But it was unfortunate for the next President . Nixon could have used more common_sense advice in the Oval Office -- advice such_as &quot; junk that recording machine. &quot;</TEXT>
