   <HEADLINE> R S V P / INTO THE NIGHT : IF CONGRESS HAD CELEBRITY GUEST STARS . . .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Scene : Monday ' s premiere of TriStar ' s &quot; Only You &quot; at the Motion_Picture Academy . A reception preceded the screening and a sit-down dinner at the Beverly Hilton followed . Because the evening benefited the Washington-based Robert F . Kennedy Memorial , a pack of &quot; Congressional aide-types , &quot; as one guest called them , was_on hand . &quot; Same kind of party , &quot; noted one veteran of D.C. schmoozing , &quot; different kind of hangers-on. &quot; Who Was There : The film ' s stars , Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. , and director Norman Jewison ; among the 1 # 000 guests at the screening ( 500 at the dinner ) were Ethel Kennedy , Kerry Kennedy Cuomo ( who ' s pregnant with twin girls ) , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver , Morgan Freeman , Ken Wahl , Bernard Lafferty , Melinda and John Watson , Don Klosterman , Beth Swofford , and studio execs Alan Levine , Marc Platt , Stacey Snider and Mark Canton . Quoted : Co-star Bonnie Hunt , commenting on the synergy between D.C. and L.A. said , &quot; Politicians do_well in Hollywood ; actors do_well in Washington. &quot; Audience Review : An ecstatic response . &quot; ' Moonstruck ' set_in Italy , &quot; was a typical comment . Director James Brooks said the film had &quot; joy , confidence and ease. &quot; &quot; Italy is just a wonderful background for romantic stories , &quot; Jewison said . &quot; Shakespeare must have felt that because he set many of his romantic comedies there. &quot; Best Comeback : As he passed_through the conga_line of television crews outside the theater , Downey was asked , apropos of nothing , if drug testing should be mandatory for actors when they sign film contracts . &quot; No , but I think it should be for you tonight , &quot; he said without missing a beat . Money Matters : More_than $ 100 # 000 was raised , with most earmarked for RFK-LA , a drug and gang intervention program in East L.A. ; $ 30 # 000 will go_to an RFK Human_Rights Award to imprisoned Chinese pro-democracy activists Wei Jing Sheng and Ren Wan Ding . &quot; Our priority , &quot; said Memorial executive_director Kennedy Cuomo , &quot; is to help these two courageous men get_out of jail. &quot; Underlying Theme : The studio , which had a bad year , just suffered a wave of firings . One observer said : &quot; The only question is , are the lucky ones those who get_out , or those who stay ? &quot;</TEXT>
