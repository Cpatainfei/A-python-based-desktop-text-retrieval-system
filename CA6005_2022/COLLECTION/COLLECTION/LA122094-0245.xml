   <HEADLINE> ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In regard_to the hubbub brought_on by Proposition 187 . It seems I ' ve missed a chapter somewhere . I thought we were talking_about illegal immigrants. &quot; Illegal &quot; has been lost along the way . Now , everybody is referring to immigrants as if that is the same . People who founded our country came here to become Americans . They worked , learned our language and customs , obeyed our laws and earnestly desired to be an integral part of our society . Today , they pour across our borders illegally , make demands on us , drain our resources and have no desire to be Americans . Instead , they want us to cater to them , to their wishes , their health and welfare needs . They trample our laws and our flag , prey on our society and insist that we speak their language , teach their language and have written documents printed in their language . Those who believe_in America and reap its rewards should speak our language , pay their share of taxes , carry their weight according to American laws , customs and our society .
