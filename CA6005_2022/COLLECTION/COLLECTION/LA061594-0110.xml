   <TEXT> Before the nightly news_showed gruesome photos of human limbs devoured , before drive-time deejays yukked up the dreaded &quot; flesh-eating bacteria , &quot; before British tabloids screamed , &quot; Killer Bug Ate My Face , &quot; and people fretted over an epidemic that does not exist , there was Luis . This little boy , then 4 , arrived_at the emergency_room of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles 18 months ago . He had a bad case of chickenpox , and his parents said his hip hurt . The doctors knew immediately that it was far more serious . The child , whose real name has been kept confidential , was in shock when he entered the intensive care unit . His kidneys were failing , his blood_pressure was erratic . Clots were forming in his arteries . Worse , he had a ghoulish case of gangrene . His legs , swollen and purple , were withering away . &quot; He was perilously close to death , &quot; says Dr. Larry Ross , an infectious_disease specialist at Childrens . Luis survived -- &quot; It ' s miraculous , &quot; Ross says -- but today is in a wheelchair . Both legs were amputated below the knees . What Luis had was devastating . But it was rare , and it is certainly not new . His ailment was the same one that has gripped the public consciousness -- and imagination -- in recent weeks : infection with a deadly , fast-acting strain of a common and ordinarily benign germ , Group_A streptococcus . Most Group_A infections cause nothing more_than strep_throat . But Luis had a rare , aggressive form that entered his body through a chickenpox sore and released lethal toxins that caused &quot; necrotizing fasciitis &quot; -- literally , death of the fascia , the tissue that binds skin to muscle . Over the last five years , scientists have tracked the spotty reemergence of similar , highly virulent strains of Group_A strep . These strains had been dormant for half a century or more , and were nearly nonexistent in the late 1970s and early 1980s . But since recent reports of the disease appeared in Great Britain , the tabloids have had a field_day with &quot; the flesh-eating bacteria. &quot; The catchy phrase -- if technically inaccurate -- has catapulted Group_A strep from scientific curiosity to disease lore . It now holds a place on a list of mysterious health threats that seem to come_out of nowhere , whipping_up fear and then quickly fading from the spotlight : Legionnaire ' s disease , Lyme disease , E . coli , hantavirus . In fact , Group_A strep has made this list before . Four years ago , it killed Jim Henson , the creator of the Muppets . A spate of frightening news_stories followed . &quot; A Mean Strain of Strep , &quot; trumpeted Newsweek . &quot; Bad News Bacteria , &quot; announced the highly regarded journal Science , in a report picked_up by media outlets nationwide . Killer germs are perfect for prime_time . They are invisible , uncontrollable and , in the case of Group_A strep , can invade the body in an unnervingly simple manner : through a cut or scrape . &quot; This is one of the eternal fascinations of people , like horror movies , &quot; says Jim Whorton , a professor of medical_history at the University of Washington . &quot; It ' s something we ' re terrified of , but we just can ' t help peeking. &quot; Whorton says that ever since the germ_theory -- that said small , invisible organisms could cause disease -- was proved in the 1880s , people have spied germs lurking behind every corner . Even scientists &quot; began finding germ causes for everything. &quot; There were at least a dozen reports in the late 1800s of the discovery of &quot; the germ of beriberi &quot; -- a disease that was later found to be caused by a deficiency of Vitamin B1 . Before the bacterium that causes syphilis was discovered , people were convinced they could catch the disease without having sexual contact -- from sharing utensils , touching doorknobs , even breathing the same air as someone who was infected . &quot; If the_British tabloids had been around in the early 20th Century , &quot; Whorton says , &quot; we would have seen very similar stories about syphilis . It would have been portrayed as a menace that was overrunning society. &quot; But Dr. Michael Wilkes , a professor of medicine at UCLA , sees more_than media hype at_work . True tales of grisly diseases , he says , put the lie to a uniquely American belief . &quot; For decades , and maybe even half a century , &quot; he says , &quot; the American medical machine has tried , to a great extent , to put a myth over the public that everything is within our ability to control , that we have medicine and we have technology and we have surgery to deal with the common ills of humans . &quot; It ' s these sorts of episodes that pop their head_up on a regular basis , that remind the public how terribly vulnerable we all are , and how medicine is really very much an art , not a science. &quot; * Reports of the &quot; flesh-eating bacteria &quot; have been nothing short of horrific . The fast-moving infections do respond well to antibiotics if treated immediately , but symptoms are often difficult to recognize at first . Of those afflicted with aggressive strains of Group_A strep , 30 % to 50 % die . Some strains spawn necrotizing fasciitis -- the &quot; flesh-eating &quot; gangrene that Luis suffered . Others cause myositis , which eats_away at muscle . Others cause severe damage to organs , such_as kidneys and lungs . Equally frightening are suggestions that the disease occurs in clusters : In Los Angeles and Orange counties , 28 children who had chickenpox this winter also became infected with severe strains of strep -- although not the &quot; flesh-eating &quot; kind -- and five died . In Connecticut , Norwalk Hospital admitted a man and a woman -- unrelated to one another -- during the same week in May . The man was in critical condition until Tuesday , when his status was upgraded to serious . The woman was discharged last Thursday . In Gloucestershire , England , a cluster of seven cases was reported , and health officials say the lethal organisms have caused more_than a dozen deaths in their country this year . While the public thirsts for explanations , scientists can offer few . Many questions -- such_as why toxic streptococcus infections appear to be_on the rise and how bacteria can be transformed from tame to ferocious -- lack answers . &quot; The truth is that we have an incomplete explanation for it at this point_in_time , &quot; says Dr. Edward Kaplan of the University of Minnesota , who runs a World_Health_Organization laboratory responsible_for tracking the strep germ . Still , Kaplan is angry at what he views_as overwrought media coverage of the Group_A threat . &quot; This is not anything that danced in out_of_the_blue , &quot; he says . &quot; If I lived_in your part of the country , I would be much more worried about an earthquake than I would about getting a flesh-eating bacteria. &quot; Statistics are also incomplete on how frequently these toxic strains infect people . Only 22 states require doctors to report Group_A strep infections to health officials , although the current furor has caused an upsurge in reporting . The federal Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention estimates that in 1990 , the last year in which it gathered figures , there were 10 # 000 to 15 # 000 severe cases of Group_A strep in the United States , resulting in 2 # 000 to 3 # 000 deaths . Of those , 500 to 1 # 500 included necrotizing fasciitis . Although the incidence is up from the early 1980s , the numbers are minuscule compared to the many thousands of routine strep infections each year . The organism is so common it has been called &quot; an occupational disease of schoolchildren. &quot; Experts estimate that 10 % to 15 % of all pupils are infected at any given time . * Although they are rare , severe Group_A strep infections are not to be dismissed , as those who have been afflicted can attest . Pat Scott nearly succumbed to one of these germs three years ago . Her face was eaten away by the disease . After 33 plastic_surgery operations , the 57-year-old El Cajon woman still is not whole . Because her reconstructed eyelids do not close perfectly , she must wear a mask to sleep . Every hour , she puts saline drops_in her eyes so they do not dry_out . &quot; I lost my forehead . I have no eyebrows . I lost both sides of my face , part of my nose , my eyelids , &quot; she said . &quot; The only part of my face that is still really me is under_my_nose and my lips . The rest of it has been grafted. &quot; She was stricken in 1991 , after she tripped and hit her head on a bar stool . The wound was not much bigger than the head of a pin . She says she was given antibiotics , although the first of two surgeons who cared_for her , Dr. Randal Vecchione , says it is unclear whether Scott took the drugs as required . Vecchione says Scott was infected not only with Group_A strep , but with three other organisms that combined to create &quot; an anatomical nightmare. &quot; When he met her , 10 days after her injury , the surgeon cut_away the patient ' s face to save her life . Had he not done so , he said , the infection would have marched_on , killing her . &quot; The most maligning thing that can be done to any individual is to remove her face , &quot; the surgeon said . &quot; And that ' s what she was , the faceless woman. &quot; Scott will probably undergo another dozen reconstructive operations , according to her current surgeon , Dr. Leonard Glass of UC San Diego . But she will always need special hair treatments and makeup to appear normal . &quot; Functionally , I think she ' s going_to be fine , eventually , &quot; Glass said . &quot; Appearance-wise , I think she ' s going_to be good_enough . . . . She ' s always going_to be terribly scarred and deformed. &quot; * In the earlier part of this century , before the advent of antibiotics , such aggressive streptococcal infections were a serious problem . Often they led to severe cases of rheumatic_fever and scarlet_fever . But around World_War_II , says Kaplan of the University of Minnesota , the cases began to drop . Some have attributed the downturn to the arrival of antibiotics , but Kaplan says the decline actually began before then . By the 1970s and early 1980s , deadly Group_A strep infections were extremely uncommon . In the mid-1980s , the tide began to turn . In 1989 , along with Dr. Dennis L . Stevens of the University of Washington , Kaplan co-authored a landmark article in the New England Journal of Medicine on the rise of highly toxic Group_A infections . The article described 20 patients from the Rocky Mountain region , all infected between 1986 and 1988 . Eleven suffered from necrotizing fasciitis ; six died . Viewed over the long term , the upturn in severe Group_A strep infections is not surprising . Students of medical_history know that diseases from smallpox to tuberculosis wax and wane with the times . Dr. Jay Wenger of the CDC says : &quot; Infectious_diseases tend to be a little bit cyclical. &quot; Over the past several years , scientists have devoted a lot of attention to understanding these &quot; emerging infections , &quot; as they are called . Sometimes , there is an explanation for cycles of disease , or for the appearance of a microorganism that appears to be new but in fact may_not be . Lyme disease -- a fatiguing condition that can cause neurological symptoms and pain and swelling in joints -- became prevalent in New England when developers began building suburban subdivisions in wooded areas inhabited by deer . Ticks that had bitten infected deer began biting people as well , passing_on the disease . Sometimes , one disease can lead to another . The spread of AIDS has created an immune-suppressed population that is vulnerable to tuberculosis . The recent upswing in TB has also been attributed , in part , to the phenomenon of drug resistance , in which new strains crop_up to outsmart old antibiotics . Still other diseases , like hantavirus -- which captured public attention last year when a new strain , carried by rodent droppings , caused more_than 30 deaths -- have existed for a long_time before being recognized and named . And sometimes old illnesses re-emerge when &quot; herd immunity &quot; no longer exists ; a measles outbreak occurred in Los Angeles County several years ago because many children were not vaccinated . These explanations , however , fail to account_for the increase in toxic strains of Group_A strep . &quot; None of the usual reasons seem to apply , &quot; says Dr. Michael Dube , an infectious_disease specialist at USC . &quot; Streptococcus sort of has a mind of its own. &quot; * At the University of Minnesota , Kaplan is trying to gain a greater understanding of that &quot; mind. &quot; He has been able to type about 80 varieties of Group_A strep , distinguished by subtle genetic differences . But much more needs to be learned , he says , including how many types are especially virulent and what makes them so . Kaplan theorizes that the reemergence of deadly strep strains has to do more with a change in the bacterium itself than with any outside force . He believes the strep germ may have become infected with a virus that inserts new genetic material into the organism , causing it to manufacture toxins . Once inside the body , the streptococcus bacteria multiply quickly , producing the toxins , which are then secreted . If patients receive antibiotics within about three days of infection , the drugs can generally head_off release of the toxins . But once the poisons are released , it is difficult to stop them . Often , the only cure is to cut_out infected tissue or muscle . &quot; It ' s the toxin that causes the damage , not the bug itself , &quot; Kaplan says . The toxin &quot; starts a cascade of abnormal physiological events , causing damage to the liver , kidneys and lungs and so on . And then you can see how you ' re off to the races. &quot; Why one person becomes infected and another does not remains unclear . So is why some people get strep_throat and others do not . Some may have heartier immune_systems and resist infection . Others may be susceptible because of poor nutrition or underlying diseases . As for the big question -- Is this contagious ? -- Kaplan says : &quot; There is evidence that these strains can spread . Streptococcal infections have been known to be contagious for years . Does that mean everybody should go_in the house and lock the door ? No , not yet. &quot; How Deadly Bacteria Spread The so-called &quot; flesh-eating bacteria &quot; is a highly virulent form of an ordinarily innocuous germ , Group_A streptococcus . Scientists theorize that virulent Group_A strains occur when bacteria mutate to produce toxins . These toxins can cause a range of lethal symptoms , including necrotizing fasciitis , a condition in which tissue is rapidly destroyed . HOW THE BACTERIA KILL : 1 ) Bacteria enter the body through a break_in skin , including chicken pox lesions , or sore_throat . 2 ) Bacteria multiply , producing toxins that spread in skin and fatty_tissues . 3 ) Toxins introduced into the bloodstream spread to other parts of the body , including organs such_as the kidneys and lungs . 4 ) Toxins can also cause necrotizing fasciitis , cutting_off circulation in the affected area , depriving tissue of oxygen and destroying the tissue . THE FIRST 72 HOURS : Symptoms can include a sudden rash , a spreading infection , swollen lymph_nodes or a rise in fever . At this stage , antibiotics can stop the bacteria , preventing release of the deadly toxins . UNTREATED SYMPTOMS : Without treatment , the possibility of heading_off the disease decreases . In some individuals the disease can become dangerous in a matter of two or three days ; others longer . Once toxins are released , surgery may be required to remove necrotic tissue . The disease kills 30 % to 50 % of those afflicted . OCCURENCES : Infections with aggressive Group_A strep are rare . Recent cases have been reported in California , Colorado , Connecticut , Florida , Michigan and New York .
