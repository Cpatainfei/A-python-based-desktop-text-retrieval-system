   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES ; COMMENTARY ON SOCIETY ; U.N. YEAR OF THE FAMILY AN OCCASION TO RE-EXAMINE PRIORITIES ; THE CORE OF OUR SOCIAL_STRUCTURE DESERVES MORE COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC-POLICY SUPPORT , ESPECIALLY IN OVERCOMING SUCH SCOURGES AS CHILD_ABUSE AND GANG VIOLENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Children ' s Summit , which took_place Sept . 25 at Orange Coast College , focused our attention once again upon children and families and communities . Perhaps the United Nations should declare every year an International Year of the Family until we get our priorities straight . Families form the basic unit of society . When a society is cohesive , law-abiding and productive , the source of its strength can invariably be traced to the strength of its families . If families are in_trouble , then communities are also in_trouble . The United Nations International Year of the Family ( UNIYF ) has as its goals to engage in efforts on a local level that would strengthen families , to promote better relations between the public and private sectors and to work to change public policy that does not make children and families our priority . We need to enable the family to fulfill its function as the source of emotional , financial and material support essential for the well-being of its members . The Board of Supervisors , in its first annual report on the state of Orange County children , noted the progress made in education -- test scores , dropout rates ( with the exception of Latinos , whose dropout rates have increased ) -- while simultaneously pointing_out increases in three very important areas : poverty , child_abuse and gang membership . Studies show that child_abuse is cyclical ; perpetrators are most likely victims of child_abuse themselves . How to break the pattern ? How to teach parents better techniques of parenting ? How to discipline without anger , without violence ? We salute the sponsors of various parenting classes throughout the county , but we believe they are insufficient to meet the need and don ' t reach all those who could benefit from parental training . Shouldn ' t classes in marriage preparation and parenting be required for graduation from high_school ? Isn ' t it a fact that the high divorce rate has a profound and permanent effect upon children ? Families are shattered every day by the impact of violence . It is done through intimidation , force , exploitation , subjugation , humiliation or ridicule . Its results are often expressed silently , through fear and isolation . Its consequences : a society of individuals preoccupied with survival rather than creativity . Don ' t increasing levels of violence in our community indicate a need for teaching conflict resolution in the schools , beginning at the elementary level ? Perhaps classes in conflict resolution should be offered in the evening for parents as well . We know also that television violence affects families ; why can ' t we do something about it ? Spousal abuse is finally receiving more attention . How can we foster more egalitarian relationships between men and women based upon mutual respect , both in the workplace and the home ? What can be done about the rapidly escalating membership in gangs by our youth , with its consequent often violent activity ? It irritated us to hear preventive measures referred to as &quot; pork &quot; during the recent Senate crime bill discussions . Yet Sen . John C . Danforth ( R-Mo. ) supported after-school programs . Midnight basketball occupies youth at just that time_of_day when criminal activity is said to be most prevalent . We have heard Anaheim ' s police_chief stress the need for churches to get involved in after-school activities for youth before they get_in trouble . The care and concern of a single person may make the decisive influence in that person ' s life . Prevention is not only more cost-effective than incarceration , it saves lives ! What has the Orange County UNIYF accomplished in the midst of these great needs ? Besides producing a calendar of county events geared to families , three Santa Ana teachers prepared a curriculum of activities to celebrate families , recognizing the diversity and changing nature of families in Orange County . This was distributed among schools , particularly in Anaheim , Garden Grove and Santa Ana . A religious subcommittee prepared information and suggestions for celebrating families in religious institutions . From the beginning , &quot; living-room dialogues &quot; were promoted . The program assembles small groups of people of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds for discussion of topics aimed at fostering mutual respect and appreciation of one another . Orange County has the distinct advantage of being a microcosm of the United Nations itself . In this era of hate crimes , Proposition 187 , homophobia , xenophobia and extremism , there needs to be a movement devoted to understanding , compassion and tolerance . One of the important goals of the U.N. has been to encourage families to have the courage to express themselves and their needs in decision-making processes . The recent Children ' s Summit agenda exemplified this principle . Our UNIYF year will conclude Oct . 23 with United Nations Day , a celebration of the 49th anniversary of the founding of the U.N. Using the International Year of the Family theme , U.N. Day will celebrate families with a family fiesta at Bowers Museum . Is the work of the UNIYF completed ? Not by any means . The importance of children and families cannot exist for just one year . For all_of us , the needs of families must guide our everyday thinking and actions . We have many examples in Orange County wherein public policy does not support children and families . When long waiting_lists prevent Phoenix House from helping all_the teen-agers in_trouble , when there are so few county-funded pediatric clinics for sick children , when street beautification outranks keeping libraries open , and when city and county budget realities reflect that other items remain priorities , we still have lots of work to do .</TEXT>
