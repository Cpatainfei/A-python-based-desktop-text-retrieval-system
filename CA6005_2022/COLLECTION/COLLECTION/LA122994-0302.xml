   <HEADLINE> WATCHING THE PESO , WAITING FOR BARGAINS ; CRISIS : DOUBLING OF KEY SHORT-TERM RATE SEEN AS STRONG SIGNAL THAT GOVERNMENT IS SERIOUS ABOUT RETAINING FOREIGN CAPITAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Mexican government on Wednesday doubled a key short-term interest_rate in a drastic bid to retain foreign investors , amid reports that the embattled nation has lost $ 8 billion in capital since its financial crisis erupted last week . The higher rate -- along with reports that Mexico was negotiating with U.S. Treasury officials for emergency loans of up_to $ 10 billion to quell the crisis -- helped the peso on Wednesday regain some of the value it had lost since its devaluation sparked the crisis nine days ago . The capital flight , equal_to more_than 12 % of foreign investment in Mexico ' s financial system , could lead to inflation as high as 20 % and plunge the Mexican economy into recession , economists said . The continued loss of foreign capital could also require the government to adopt strict slow-growth measures next year at a time when Mexican consumers were expecting a respite from six years of austerity . To stem the capital outflow , the Mexican government on Wednesday raised interest_rate yields on 28-day cetes , Mexican government_bonds roughly equivalent_to short-term U.S. Treasury_bills . The rate was hiked by 15 percentage_points at the weekly government auction to 31 % , the highest level in nearly five years . The rate hike was interpreted as a strong signal that the government is willing to go_to great lengths to attract and keep foreign capital . More_than half the cetes in past auctions have been bought by foreigners . The peso closed Wednesday about 4.9750 to the dollar , an almost 10 % gain from its 5.50 close late Tuesday , although it is still down more_than 30 % since Dec . 19 . Mexican stocks and bonds also rallied amid reports of the possible emergency credit . Mexico ' s benchmark Bolsa index rose 60.82 points , or 2.67 % , to close at 2 # 337.72 on Wednesday , and some individual stocks made huge gains . The peso ' s partial recovery had been predicted by some who thought sellers overreacted to the Mexican government ' s announcement last week that it would allow the peso to float freely in value against the dollar . John Williamson , a fellow at the Institute for International Economics , predicted Wednesday that the peso could bounce_back to as low as 4 per dollar . But the capital flight report and the spike in interest_rates were ominous signs , and they raised fears of a replay of the 1982 peso devaluation , when a sinking currency , sharply rising interest_rates and spiraling inflation caused a wholesale exodus of capital from Mexico to offshore havens . The short-term practical effect of capital flight and loss of foreign investor confidence is an unstable currency : The Mexican government has diminished foreign reserves at its disposal to try to prop_up the peso . Higher interest_rates carry risks . The yields ultimately will be reflected in bank loans and passed_on to Mexican consumers and businesses . By increasing the costs of many products and services , sustained high rates initially will create intense inflationary pressure , said Mauro Leos , vice_president of operation at Ciemex / Wefa , a Philadelphia think_tank that tracks foreign capital in and out of Mexico . High rates later could slow the economy by inhibiting spending and prompting people to save instead of spend . Investors are awaiting an economic plan to be released Monday by new President Ernesto Zedillo , who has been blamed for badly bungling the first Mexican devaluation in seven years . The flight of $ 8 billion from Mexico ' s financial system since early last week was estimated by Ciemex / Wefa and corroborated by Carlos Zarazaga , a senior economist at the Dallas branch of the Federal_Reserve_Bank . He said the outflow was equal_to the amount of all new foreign investment that came_into Mexico during 1994 , thus wiping_out any net gain . The drain was caused by foreigners and Mexicans selling stocks and bonds and exchanging the peso proceeds for dollars , Leos said . The drain , combined with what the Mexican government has spent in recent months to defend its peso , has left the country with less than $ 6 billion in foreign reserves , down from $ 28 billion in March , he said . The dramatic reduction in the Mexican government ' s reserves is what is spurring its efforts to arrange a credit_line with the United States , Canada and the International Monetary Fund . The credit would give Mexico the resources it needs to begin defending and staking out a value for the peso , Leos said . The dwindling of foreign reserves was a principal reason for the devaluation . The government was also motivated by a desire to reverse its growing balance of payments deficit . By devaluing its currency , Mexico makes its goods more attractive on the international market . Other side_effects of shrinking foreign investment -- in a country that relies_on foreign capital as heavily as Mexico does -- include a shrinkage in the money_supply , a drop-off in spending by consumers and rising unemployment . Less capital means higher interest_rates on loans taken_out by credit-hungry borrowers , Zarazaga said . Capital flight &quot; is extremely serious , &quot; Leos said . &quot; It leaves the central_bank with no power to influence the foreign_exchange markets . It creates uncertainty in the outlook for economy in_general because of the unstable currency . &quot; So , we have a crisis not only in that the currency is devalued but also because of the uncertainty about what the reference level is. &quot; To stabilize things , he said , Mexico urgently needs a credit agreement with U.S. , Canadian and international funding sources , because Mexico &quot; doesn ' t have the internal resources to ( defend its currency ) on its own. &quot; Even after measures are taken , Mexico ' s leaders will have a tough task restoring trust among foreign investors -- and Mexican citizens . &quot; A lot of people thought things like this were not supposed to happen , now that Mexico was part of NAFTA and after the sacrifices that were done_in the last six to 10 years , &quot; Leos said .</TEXT>
