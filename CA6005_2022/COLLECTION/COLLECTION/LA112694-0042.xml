   <HEADLINE> ANOTHER LOOK_AT FIRE DEPT . PERSONNEL ; INDEPENDENT PANEL WILL REVIEW AUDIT ' S FINDINGS OF PREJUDICE AND HARASSMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rightly , the Los Angeles Fire Commission signaled this week that it is concerned about the Fire_Department ' s personnel practices . A city audit of the department had found that women and minority firefighters were subjected_to sexual and racial harassment ; however , top fire officials claimed that the department ' s own data contradicted the audit ' s findings . Now the commission has appointed an independent panel to find_out what ' s really going_on . The study , to be led by attorney Gilbert T . Ray , will review the disputed audit , interview department members and examine other Fire_Department data . Ray cautioned that his four-to-six-week study will &quot; be far from a definitive piece. &quot; But definitive or not , if Ray ' s panel corroborates the audit ' s findings , the Fire_Department must take immediate remedial steps . The audit , made public earlier this month , paints an appalling picture of life inside the Fire_Department for women and minority recruits . White males hold 95 % of the top department posts , none of which are held by Asian Americans , blacks or women . The audit identified what it termed &quot; rookie kill stations , &quot; where efforts are made to run women and minorities out of the department -- this after 20 years of affirmative_action policies . Those efforts , unfortunately , have been successful ; the audit found the attrition_rate for women and minorities to be significantly higher than for white_men . There is simply no excuse for harassment and racism , and if the commission ' s independent panel finds the audit credible , change must be immediate and far-reaching . Sadly , serious allegations such_as those lodged against the Fire_Department have also been made against other city agencies of late . Just this year , both the Los Angeles Police_Department and the city ' s Department of Water and Power came under intense scrutiny and criticism in the wake of appalling charges of sexual_harassment . In response , the Police Commission has created a unit within the LAPD to investigate complaints of harassment and discrimination . The DWP , following a $ 1.5-million settlement of a harassment case brought by a former employee and revelation of about 100 sexual_harassment complaints against the agency over the last two years , says it is reviewing its procedures for handling sexual_harassment cases . It also says it is renewing its commitment to ending this illegal and disgraceful behavior . Now , top fire officials may need to step_forward as well , and city officials must hold the department accountable for any reform that is needed .</TEXT>
