   <HEADLINE> EX-BORDER PATROL AGENT ACQUITTED IN 1992 SLAYING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal jury in Phoenix acquitted a former Border_Patrol agent Thursday in the slaying of an unarmed drug-smuggling suspect who was shot in the back as he fled through a canyon toward the U.S.-Mexico border . Prosecutors had charged Michael Andrew Elmer , 30 , with civil_rights violations and obstruction of justice in the 1992 shooting of Dario Miranda Valenzuela , a 26-year-old Mexican national . Elmer shot Miranda with a high-powered rifle , allegedly attempted to hide the body and persuade his partner to cover_up the incident , then went drinking with fellow agents instead of reporting the death , according to testimony . A state jury had previously cleared Elmer of murder and obstruction of justice in the incident near Nogales , Ariz . Elmer resigned from the Border_Patrol after the shooting . The federal jury deliberated about 4 1 / 2 hours before deciding the highly_sensitive and emotional case , the first in memory in which the government has charged a Border_Patrol agent in a shooting death , according to prosecutors . The reactions Thursday ranged from jubilation to outrage . &quot; Twelve neutral people sat_down and analyzed the evidence and came_to a decision , &quot; said Michael Piccarreta , Elmer ' s lawyer . &quot; that ' s what the system is all about . . . . It was a self-defense shooting. &quot; Piccarreta argued that Elmer was a frightened soldier in a harrowing war on drugs who made a split-second decision to fire after mistaking a canteen on the fleeing Miranda ' s belt for a holster . But a prosecutor said that the jury made its decision in spite of uncontested evidence , including testimony from the agent ' s partner , that Elmer recklessly and knowingly committed a crime . &quot; People have trouble convicting police_officers , &quot; said Assistant U.S. Atty . Thomas Perez , who added that the government had spent almost a year preparing the case . &quot; Elmer and his partner were two reckless individuals who decided that the rules didn ' t suit them , so they made_up their own rules , which ultimately had deadly consequences. &quot; Circumstantial evidence that Miranda was involved in drug running may have played a role in the verdict , Perez said . Miranda was carrying a small bag of marijuana , and cocaine was found in his system . Immigrant rights advocates and representatives of the Mexican government said they were stunned . &quot; It is a decision that we find inexplicable , &quot; said Nicolas Escalante , consul general of Mexico in Phoenix . &quot; We felt that the government presented the proof brilliantly . . . . It is lamentable. &quot; An attorney representing Miranda ' s family in a civil lawsuit declared that the speedy verdict indicates that the jury was racially biased in favor of the white Border_Patrol agent and against the Mexican victim . The jury consisted_of eleven whites and one African American . &quot; It clearly states that the jury_system does not work , &quot; said lawyer Jesus Romo , who is handling a civil case brought by the slain man ' s family . &quot; The consequences of this verdict are enormously adverse to our community . . . . It will instill more fear in the victims . They are already very afraid to report incidents of abuse. &quot; Federal civil_rights prosecutions of alleged Border_Patrol misconduct are rare . Border incidents often occur in remote areas and involve illegal immigrants , who tend to be reluctant witnesses . Moreover , a string of incidents in the Arizona Border_Patrol sector and elsewhere in past years have revealed that the patrol ' s slow-moving internal oversight system is hampered by a code of silence among some agents . When the Miranda shooting took_place in June , 1992 , some described it as the Rodney G . King case of the Border_Patrol . The setting was a dangerous drug-running corridor where heavily armed agents had been fighting a tense battle against traffickers , a campaign that degenerated into widespread use of warning shots and other unauthorized tactics , according to testimony . About two months after Elmer ' s first acquittal on state charges in December , 1992 , federal prosecutors began preparing the case alleging that he violated the civil_rights of Miranda and another suspected courier accompanying him , and obstructed justice by trying to enlist his partner , Agent Thomas Watson , in a cover-up . Watson was the government ' s star witness against Elmer . He testified that he fired warning shots upon spotting the suspected drug runners and that Elmer then fired six or seven times at Miranda from a distance of about 150 feet . Watson said he feared for his life when Elmer , holding his rifle in his hands , dragged the body toward the international boundary , told him he planned to bury the body the next day and asked &quot; Do you have a problem with that ? &quot; Elmer then went_to a parking_lot to drink beer with fellow members of a drug interdiction team . Watson reported the shooting about 15 hours later ; he was fired by the patrol for the delay . The testimony against Elmer also featured officials from the Border_Patrol academy who described his training and an expert who asserted that there was enough light in the canyon for Elmer to see that Miranda was unarmed . Although it acknowledged that Elmer broke Border_Patrol rules , the defense contended that Elmer was being unfairly second-guessed for a justified reaction to what he perceived as a threat to his life . The jurors , who were brought_to the scene of the shooting for a firsthand look , clearly sympathized_with the difficult task of the Border_Patrol at an increasingly militarized border , Piccarreta said . And he rejected assertions that the race of Elmer , Miranda or the jury played a role in the outcome . &quot; I think those comments are racist , that anyone from any race would ignore the evidence or ignore the law , &quot; Piccarreta said . &quot; It had nothing to do with race. &quot;</TEXT>
