   <HEADLINE> U.S. WON ' T REVAMP NUCLEAR ARMS POLICIES ; NATIONAL SECURITY : CLINTON AGREES NOT TO ACCELERATE REDUCTIONS IN FORCES , STOCKPILES DUE TO RUSSIA ' S INSTABILITY . CRITICS CALL STANCE ' COLD_WAR LITE. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton has decided to continue the nation ' s current nuclear_weapons policies essentially unchanged , despite earlier suggestions by some officials that he might cut U.S. nuclear forces more sharply , the Pentagon said Thursday . The decision , which the President made last Friday at a meeting with his national security advisers , follows the recommendations of a yearlong Pentagon review aimed at hammering_out a new role for nuclear_weapons in the wake of the Cold_War . Initially , senior Administration officials had suggested that the study , begun by former Defense_Secretary Les Aspin , call_on the Administration to radically revamp the nation ' s nuclear forces , reduce the number of nuclear_weapons in the U.S. arsenal and possibly pledge not to be the first to launch a nuclear strike . However , Aspin ' s successor , William J . Perry , argued that the current instability in Russia -- which raises the possibility that a totalitarian government might one day resume power -- still is too great to permit the United States to reduce its arsenal more quickly . Clinton ' s decision essentially postpones indefinitely any new nuclear arms-reduction talks with Moscow beyond the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties I and II , which already have been negotiated . START II still has not been ratified either by Russia or the United States . At the same time , however , the policy would provide a hedge against whatever transpires in Russia by allowing Washington either to speed_up its arms-reduction efforts , or recall some warheads from reserves . White_House officials speeded_up the study so that the decision would be completed in time for the summit_meeting Clinton is to hold Tuesday and Wednesday with Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin . Arms-control issues are high on the agenda . Unclear for the moment was what impact the Administration ' s refusal to reduce the U.S. arsenal further would have in the push to win renewal of the international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in March . Third_World countries have warned that they plan to insist that the current nuclear_powers take additional steps to reduce their nuclear armaments before they will support a renewal . Extending -- and possibly strengthening -- the treaty is one of Clinton ' s key goals . Arms-control advocates reacted sharply to the President ' s decision . The Natural_Resources Defense Council issued a statement branding the policy &quot; Cold_War lite. &quot; If Clinton really fears Russian instability , it said , he should speed_up weapons destruction , not slow it . But Perry insisted that the policy is_on target , asserting that it was only prudent to provide some hedges in the face of current uncertainties . He added that Moscow was visibly behind schedule in reducing its nuclear arsenal . Here are the major elements of Clinton ' s decision : * Reduction of U.S. nuclear_weapons will continue on its current schedule , with Washington cutting its 6 # 000-warhead arsenal to about 3 # 500 under the START II treaty -- enough to destroy some 2 # 500 Russian targets . * The nation will continue its nuclear &quot; triad , &quot; in which some nuclear_warheads are carried by bombers , submarines and intercontinental_ballistic_missiles . Some analysts had suggested that the Administration destroy all its land-based missiles because they are so vulnerable . * The strategic nuclear force will be reduced at the current pace . The study calls_for retaining 14 Trident submarines , four fewer than present levels , 66 B-52 bombers instead of the 94 planned , and 450 to 500 of the 600 Minuteman III missiles with single warheads now on_hand . * The United States will continue to refuse to pledge that it will not be the first to launch a nuclear strike , even though Moscow has announced a no-first-use policy . The Pentagon argued that the uncertainty serves as a deterrent to would-be aggressors . Administration officials said the proposals for more radical reductions , advocated by Aspin ' s staff and by some members of the National Security_Council , were rejected by military_leaders , who campaigned vigorously to head_off any significant cutbacks . And Pentagon officials said Perry himself moved to alter an earlier version of the plan in_order to increase the number of warheads that the United States would retain . There were no immediate details on what the lower figure would have mandated .</TEXT>
