   <HEADLINE> CHIEF DEFENDS LAPD AMID CRITICISM OVER REPORTS ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : WILLIAMS SAYS VALLEY DOCUMENTS THAT SUGGESTED POLICE SHOULD TARGET MINORITY MEN DIDN ' T HAVE APPROVAL OF MANAGEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Appearing before the Los Angeles City_Council , Police_Chief Willie Williams defended his department Wednesday against a storm of criticism over a series of department crime documents , including one that suggests police stop and question more black and Latino men . The reports , which include statistics on violent crime gathered during the past year , sparked criticism in City_Hall and elsewhere in recent weeks partly because of the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s initial unwillingness to release them publicly . Beginning last week , the LAPD has been gradually releasing the reports . But the biggest furor of all arose over a seven-paragraph section in the crime report for the North Hollywood Division , which suggests that police should target black and Latino men because demographic information indicates that they are responsible_for a disproportionate amount of crime . * Williams said he was concerned about the passages regarding race but stressed that the document that included that recommendation , which was leaked to newspapers , was only a draft report and did not have the approval of the LAPD management . The department does not support a tactic of targeting crime based on race , he said , adding that he has been working to change the attitudes among those police_officers who do believe_in such a tactic . &quot; Is it policy ? Absolutely not , &quot; he said . &quot; No ifs , ands or buts. &quot; Nonetheless , several council_members told Williams that they were disturbed that any members of the LAPD leadership would suggest targeting suspects based on race . Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg called the North Hollywood report a &quot; very scary document &quot; and urged the chief to concentrate_on changing the perceptions of LAPD officers . &quot; I ' m satisfied that this doesn ' t represent the views of the Police_Department , &quot; she said in an interview , &quot; but I ' m unhappy that this is the mentality of whoever was asked to author it. &quot; * Councilman Mike Hernandez agreed . &quot; This tells me that we may have some leadership in that division who feel this way , &quot; he said . In an interview after the meeting , Williams declined to name the authors of the challenged report or to release their rank . He said that as chief he would take responsibility for the controversy they created . The draft report on crime in North Hollywood includes a section titled &quot; Suspect / Victim Demographics. &quot; It states that based on demographic information and the 1990 census &quot; it becomes apparent that two groups are responsible_for a larger amount of violent crime than should be expected by their representation in the community . These two groups are Black and Hispanic . . . . &quot; The report also says that males &quot; disproportionately participate in violent crimes 95 % of the time . Females represent the other 5 % of the violent crime suspects. &quot; &quot; It can be concluded that , because of the disproportionate share of criminal activity being generated by two segments of our population and one sexual category , there should be an equivalent increase in the proportional activity of law_enforcement activity within those two populations , &quot; the report says . * The section concludes saying &quot; field interview cards &quot; should show police stopping and questioning more people within the &quot; above two descent groups and the sexual category within the North Hollywood area. &quot; Williams appeared before the council to discuss the reports at the request of Councilwoman Laura Chick , who said she was concerned that the crime reports were leaked to the media before council_members even knew that such documents were being prepared . &quot; This is a dialogue that we should have had weeks ago , &quot; she told Williams . Police officials initially refused requests by local media to release the reports , saying they include sensitive information about deployment tactics and crime-fighting strategies . Last week , Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky echoed the sentiments of several council_members when he introduced a formal motion , requiring the LAPD to release the reports . The motion , which has not been brought before the entire council , would allow the department to edit_out sensitive information . * Unedited versions of the crime reports , one for each of 18 divisions throughout the city , were reviewed last Thursday by The Times . Edited versions have been gradually released , beginning Friday . The reports identify dozens of pockets of violent crime in the city and recommend an array of suggestions for cleaning_up the problem areas . The documents also include information on the number of liquor_stores and parolees in a community to determine if those factors affect the overall crime problem in the area . The edited final reports do not include the recommendations to stop and question minority men .</TEXT>
