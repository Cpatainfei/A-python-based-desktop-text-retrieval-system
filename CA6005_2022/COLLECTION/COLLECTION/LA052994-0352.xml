   <HEADLINE> DECISION ' 94 / LOCAL OFFICES ; NEW AGE DEMOCRATS MAKE 41ST THEIR TURF ; ASSEMBLY : FIELD INCLUDES ENVIRONMENTAL , GAY , CIVIL LIBERTARIAN AND ANTI-SMOKING CANDIDATES . BUT THE VALLEY IS WHERE THE VOTES ARE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At times , the cast of would-be legislators in the upscale West Side-San Fernando Valley 41st Assembly District sounds as if it has been lifted from a Woody Allen movie about New Age California politics . There are the lesbian former television actress , the environmental activist-lawyer who defends nude dancers , the Malibu civil libertarian who urges legalizing prostitution while acting_as one of the state ' s leading male advocates for abortion rights and the anti-smoking activist . Touching_off this polychromatic dash of Democratic Party candidates for the state Legislature was the surprise decision last February by Assemblyman Terry Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) to step_down and run_for a Superior_Court judgeship . The district includes the West_Side communities of Santa Monica , Brentwood , the Pacific Palisades and Malibu , the San Fernando Valley communities of Woodland Hills , Tarzana and Encino and the Conejo Valley communities of Hidden Hills , Calabasas , Agoura Hills and Westlake Village . With 50.4 % of the 41st District electorate registered as Democrats and 36.3 % as Republicans , conventional wisdom says the triumphant Democratic primary candidate wins the seat in November . Although the front-runners in the six-person Democratic primary are strongly rooted in West_Side politics , sheer numbers have forced them to pay keen attention to the San Fernando Valley part of the district . Records show that 52 % of the Democrats eligible to vote_in the primary live north of Mulholland Drive . Of the West Side-based candidates , three -- Bill Rothbard , Edward Tabash and Sheila James Kuehl -- have even set_up campaign headquarters on Ventura Boulevard to prove their courtship of the Valley is earnest . Rothbard is vice_chairman of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and ex-president of the Berkeley-based nonprofit Americans for Nonsmokers ' Rights . He once led schoolchildren in protesting a traveling exhibit of the nation ' s original Bill of Rights documents because it was sponsored by Phillip Morris , the tobacco giant . The 43-year-old anti-trust attorney ' s campaign has picked_up the endorsements of a number of Valley-based homeowner leaders , including Rob Glushon of the Encino Property_Owners Assn . and Bob Gross of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization . &quot; True , I live_on the West_Side but through my work_on the conservancy , I ' ve dealt extensively with Valley environmental issues , &quot; Rothbard said . &quot; I ' ve also done all my own precinct walking in the Valley. &quot; Rothbard also supports the breakup of the Los Angeles Unified School District , a viewpoint with a strong Valley constituency . Nor is he a school reform parvenu , Rothbard says , pointing to his work as legal counsel to a parent group that advocates converting public_schools in the Pacific Palisades -- where his own two teen-age children are being educated -- to independent charter schools . In 1992 , Rothbard unsuccessfully sought appointment as Santa Monica city attorney , calling himself a champion of the underdog , and in the 1980s he was involved -- as an aide to U.S. Sen . Howard Metzenbaum ( D-Ohio ) -- in the effort to block President Ronald Reagan ' s nomination of conservative Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court . Rothbard has raised more_than $ 175 # 000 for his campaign , and is receiving the private support of outgoing lawmaker Friedman , a close friend . As a candidate for a judgeship , Friedman is barred from being overtly engaged in Rothbard ' s campaign . Also armed with a large campaign war_chest is Sheila James Kuehl , a Loyola Law_School professor and a leader of the nonprofit California Women ' s Law Center . Her latest campaign report showed that she had raised nearly $ 250 # 000 . A onetime actress , Kuehl played Zelda , the lovelorn pursuer of Dobie in the 1960s sitcom &quot; Dobie Gillis. &quot; Last week , she raised about $ 8 # 000 at a campaign fund-raiser featuring a reunion of the series ' stars . At a Democratic Party meeting in San Pedro in March , Kuehl said she hoped to become the first openly lesbian member of the state Legislature . Kuehl has backed strong tenant-rights measures in her hometown of Santa Monica . Also , in 1993 , as a member of a local service center for the homeless , Kuehl urged a moratorium on enforcement of a controversial Santa Monica ordinance prohibiting sleeping_in the city ' s parks . &quot; If you ' re a Santa Monica renter and a Jewish woman , your mailbox is going_to be stuffed with our mailers before the campaign is over , &quot; said Barbara Grover , Kuehl ' s political consultant , commenting on the candidate ' s constituent base . * State Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) , Democratic U.S. Sen . Barbara Boxer and Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina have endorsed Kuehl , who says her domestic violence work_at the California Women ' s Law Center equips her to deal with a top concern of voters : street violence . Kuehl says she has been tough on domestic violence criminals and is ready to show the same grit when it comes_to street criminals but only after trying to rehabilitate young , first-time offenders . &quot; I understand the three-strikes-you ' re-out mood of the public , but I also believe we need to intervene and offer treatment after the first strike , &quot; Kuehl said . Although some call her a left-wing ideologue , Kuehl insists that the tag doesn ' t fit and says her endorsement by Ben Reznik , former president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. , and Roberta Weintraub , former Los Angeles school_board member , proves it . Roger Jon Diamond of the Pacific Palisades has raised $ 110 # 000 in his quest_for the 41st District seat . As an attorney , Diamond has made a name for himself in recent years defending nude_dancing establishments in Orange County threatened by restrictive zoning laws . But the 53-year-old Diamond ' s career in law and politics also amounts to a virtual road map of the California environmental and political reform_movement . In the 1970s , Diamond was a key sponsor of an unsuccessful statewide ballot measure to ban smoking in many public places . &quot; I ' ve been crazy about smoking for years , &quot; Diamond said recently . &quot; I used to carry a squirt gun around and shoot people who were smoking in public . Now this is popular . Then it was a lonely crusade. &quot; More recently , the American Lung Assn . retained Diamond to help block a tobacco-industry challenge to the city ' s sweeping law against smoking in restaurants . In the 1970s , Diamond was one of four official proponents of the ballot initiative , approved by Watergate-weary voters , that created the state ' s campaign-finance disclosure law and the Fair Political Practices Commission , and he was instrumental in getting an unsuccessful measure on the ballot to ban the construction of nuclear_power plants . Diamond was also a leader of NO OIL , the citizens group that led the fight to block oil drilling in the Pacific Palisades by Occidental Petroleum . His work in the environmental trenches has earned Diamond the endorsement of Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude , the council ' s anti-smoking champion , and the support of many members of the clean-air and clean-water movements . &quot; I ' m tenacious , &quot; Diamond said . &quot; Look_at what I ' ve done without holding office , so I think I ' d be even more effective if I held office. &quot; If sent to Sacramento , Diamond says he would fight to limit campaign contributions in state elections and for bolder laws requiring pollution-free cars in California . Tabash , 43 , has courted Valley voters by calling himself a moderate Democrat who will champion tougher laws against illegal immigration . &quot; The idea that any impoverished person who comes_to our shores is entitled to financial_aid and citizenship is unacceptable , &quot; said Tabash , who has a civil-law practice in Beverly Hills . In one campaign mailer targeted at Valley Democrats , Tabash positioned himself as the candidate with the least in common with the &quot; political power_brokers that elected Tom Hayden &quot; as he damned his Democratic rivals for being &quot; more sympathetic to a world_view of the left. &quot; Still , Tabash is no stranger to progressive politics . In fact , since 1981 he has been chief spokesman for the California Abortions Rights Action League , a group that has endorsed his candidacy . And his civil-libertarian roots have led him to advocate legalized prostitution . When alleged madam Heidi Fleiss was arrested , Tabash was quoted as saying , &quot; If we , as a society , really care about women . . . we will stop turning some of them into criminals because they have chosen to exchange sex for money. &quot; Tabash , who lives near Malibu , has invested $ 150 # 000 of_his_own money in the race , bringing his war_chest to about $ 200 # 000 . Also running in the Democratic primary is Pat McGuire , 43 , a self-described gay fiscal conservative from Tarzana . McGuire says he will fight to lower residential property_taxes by shifting them to commercial properties over a five- to seven-year period . McGuire , who has raised $ 70 # 000 for his race -- much of it from family members -- and has been endorsed by several local political clubs , teaches adult_education for the Los Angeles Unified School District . McGuire ' s mother wrote a letter to voters telling them that her son was special because he would not accept money from political_action_committees and would devote half his salary as an assemblyman to provide more police protection . John Shallman , 30 , a former top political adviser to Mayor Richard Riordan , is the sixth Democratic candidate in the race . Shallman , who lives_in Encino , owns a business-consulting firm . He has raised about $ 15 # 000 for the race . &quot; I ' m the only Valley candidate , &quot; Shallman said , pointing_out that McGuire is a recent resident of the Valley . &quot; We ' ve had enough of West_Side lawyers representing us. &quot; He describes himself as a political outsider and pragmatist who supports the breakup of the Los Angeles Unified School District . A supporter of the death_penalty , Shallman said he would focus_on curbing juvenile crime through educational_programs and boot camps for first-time offenders . He advocates tax_credits to businesses that contribute personnel to act_as mentors to young people . There are two candidates in the Republican primary . They are Michael Meehan , 28 , a reserve deputy_sheriff who is completing work_on his law_degree at Loyola University and has raised $ 7 # 600 for his race . A Santa Monica resident and former student body president at UCLA , Meehan has won endorsements from the Los Angeles County Peace_Officers Assn . and the Los Angeles Police Protective League , the latter being the collective-bargaining agent for city police_officers . As a deputy who works from eight to 16 hours a week at the Lennox substation in southeast Los Angeles , Meehan says he is the best-suited law-enforcement candidate . Calabasas resident Peter Eason , the second GOP candidate , works in marketing at California Federal Bank . Eason was a leader of the Calabasas cityhood campaign approved by voters in 1991 and currently is_on the Calabasas Traffic and Transportation Commission . He has raised $ 10 # 000 for his campaign . Eason , 39 , has been endorsed by Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson , Assemblywoman Paula Boland ( R-Granada Hills ) and the California Republican Assembly , a grass-roots organization for GOP conservatives . Eason said his business experience qualifies him to tackle the important job of streamlining state_government . Running unopposed as the Libertarian candidate in the race is Philip Baron , 34 , a Tarzana realtor .</TEXT>
