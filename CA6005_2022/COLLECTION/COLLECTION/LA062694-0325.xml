   <TEXT> Only days after the_French parliament passed a law proclaiming war on English ( making_it a punishable offense to use foreign words in advertising , on television or in any official capacity if a French equivalent exists ) , the_French Tourism Ministry launched a campaign to persuade citizens to be nicer to foreigners and address them in their own language with such expressions as &quot; sank you veri meutch. &quot; &quot; Operation Bonjour &quot; is the latest in a series of official attempts over the past two decades to tackle that sour streak in the fun-loving Gallic character that fuels the foreigners ' cliche : &quot; Great country ; too_bad about the French. &quot; The Transport and Tourism Ministry said the dissatisfaction and disappointment of foreigners &quot; have only one source , and it is nothing to do with the countryside and monuments , but with the people . Despite efforts over several years to correct it , this image of a country that does not make a big priority of welcoming people is still spreading abroad. &quot; Too often , foreigners are greeted with &quot; sloppiness , a closed-mindedness and difficulty adapting to new expectations and ignorance of foreign languages and habits , &quot; it said . These charges concerned &quot; the whole population. &quot; If the campaign works , visitors this summer will find airports , stations , roads , shops and hotels crowded with friendly greeters and decked with logos bidding them &quot; bienvenu. &quot;</TEXT>
