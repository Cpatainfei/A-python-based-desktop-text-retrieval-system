   <HEADLINE> PANEL TO PROBE HARASSMENT IN LAPD URGED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg is prepared to recommend sweeping changes in the way the Los Angeles Police_Department deals with complaints of sexual_harassment by police_officers , according to a memo by Goldberg to two of her colleagues on the City_Council ' s Personnel Committee . Goldberg ' s proposals would make significant changes in the way the department investigates complaints , trains officers and punishes those who violate sexual_harassment rules . As she has in the past , Goldberg also recommended that the LAPD set a goal of 43.4 % women in its ranks -- a percentage that matches the representation of women in the work_force generally . Goldberg ' s most revolutionary suggestion is that a special civilian unit be created to investigate harassment and discrimination complaints . The unit would report directly to the civilian Board of Police_Commissioners rather than to Police_Chief Willie L . Williams . The Personnel Committee , which Goldberg heads , is scheduled to address LAPD sexual_harassment at its meeting this afternoon . Changes such_as those proposed by Goldberg would ultimately require approval of the full City_Council , which controls the department ' s budget , and the Police Commission , which oversees the LAPD ' s operations . Goldberg ' s recommendations -- which , the councilwoman emphasized in her memo , are not final proposals but instead are offered &quot; as a way to begin the discussion of solutions to the problem of sexual_harassment in the LAPD &quot; -- grow out of news_reports documenting widespread allegations of harassment , as well as two hearings the Personnel Committee held_on the subject last month . &quot; It is clear from the testimony that the LAPD culture has a much higher tolerance for sexual_harassment than do most other work cultures , &quot; Goldberg said in her April 18 memo , which is addressed to her two Personnel Committee colleagues , Councilmen Mike Hernandez and Mark Ridley-Thomas . &quot; By insulating the investigative process within that culture , we are denying ourselves the perspective of civilians who may more accurately reflect the views of what is tolerable . Not incidentally , those views may be closer to those of a jury. &quot; Faced with mounting numbers of harassment complaints and lawsuits , Williams has already proposed the creation of a special unit to investigate harassment and discrimination . Under the current system , those complaints are investigated by the LAPD ' s Internal Affairs Division , but some female officers have complained about the Internal Affairs Division and have expressed reluctance to make complaints as long as the unit is in_charge of investigating them . Although he has expressed support for the new unit , Williams has not spelled_out how it would function or to whom it would report . Some department insiders have suggested that it would probably be made_up of police_officers and would report to the chief . Goldberg ' s suggestion more closely parallels a recommendation by Danny L . Staggs , president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League . Staggs testified at one of the Personnel Committee hearings on harassment and recommended that the special unit report to the commission rather than the chief . Deirdre Hill , vice_president of the Police Commission , said Goldberg ' s proposal &quot; certainly merits examination , &quot; but added that she has some concerns about how it is structured . &quot; One concern would be that you ' d have to make_sure a civilian unit would have insight into what ' s going_on with sworn officers , &quot; Hill said . She added , &quot; If the unit is going_to be assigned to the commission , certainly the chief would still need to be very involved. &quot; In addition to her recommendations regarding the special unit , Goldberg proposed that the city hire an outside consultant to review the LAPD ' s sexual_harassment policies and procedures . Goldberg also urged that the LAPD appoint someone to counsel and represent officers who complain of discrimination , and that the department bring administrative charges against officers who retaliate against those who lodge harassment or discrimination complaints .</TEXT>
