   <HEADLINE> FDA ENDORSES BLOOD_TEST TO HELP IN DETECTING PROSTATE CANCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Food and Drug Administration put its stamp of approval Monday on a simple blood_test that many doctors have used in recent years to help detect prostate cancer in men 50 and older . Although the FDA had approved the blood_test in 1986 to aid patients being treated for prostate cancer , Monday ' s endorsement is the first to allow its use for diagnostic purposes when done_in conjunction with a rectal exam . FDA officials cautioned that the test , a prostate specific-antigen procedure , should not be relied_upon exclusively to determine whether a man has prostate cancer . Rather , it should be used to complement a rectal exam by a physician , officials said . Federal approval of the test developed by Hybritech Corp . of San Diego , a unit of Eli Lilly &amp; Co. , was based on a review of clinical studies on safety and effectiveness submitted by Hybritech and on the recommendation of FDA ' s immunology devices panel . In a study of more_than 6 # 300 men , the panel said that the blood_test , when combined with a rectal exam , is much more effective in detecting prostate cancer than either a rectal exam or the blood_test alone . But a final diagnosis always requires a biopsy , the panel said . With a small vial of blood drawn from a man ' s forearm , the test measures the level of a protein called prostate-specific antigen that circulates in the bloodstream . When these antigens are found at elevated levels , they are a sign of prostate cancer , benign prostatic hyperplasia or other prostatic problems , physicians said . According to the National Cancer Institute , 27 % of all U.S. cancer cases involve the prostate , a walnut-sized gland at the base of the bladder that produces the fluid portion of semen . After age 50 , most men at some point experience enlargement of the prostate , which can cause difficult or painful urination . In most cases the enlargement is benign . However , about 38 # 000 men die from prostate cancer annually . The institute estimated that 200 # 000 new cases will be diagnosed this year , as numbers have grown along with better diagnostic techniques . Prostate cancer , in fact , is the most common malignancy among American men and the second-leading cancer killer , after lung_cancer , according to the American Cancer Society . Once nascent tumors are detected , the earlier the treatment , the better the chance of recovery , the cancer society said . FDA Commissioner David A . Kessler said that the blood_test , &quot; when used with other procedures , can help detect those men at risk for prostate cancer early on when more treatment options are available. &quot; &quot; But for the test to help , men must be aware of the importance of early checkups and get them on a regular basis , &quot; Kessler said . The cancer society has enlisted famous Americans in recent years to talk_about being treated after they were diagnosed as having the disease . The spokesmen have included Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , former Sen . Alan Cranston ( D-Calif. ) , Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and former professional athletes , such_as baseball Hall of Famer Stan Musial and tennis star Bobby Riggs . Doctors are divided on whether surgery to remove the prostate should be undertaken whenever cancer is detected . In the case of younger_men or slow-moving cancers , some physicians recommend a long period of watchful waiting to avoid the risks inherent in surgery .</TEXT>
