   <HEADLINE> EX-NIXON AIDE RECALLS THE DAY THAT ELVIS DROPPED IN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Egil ( Bud ) Krogh was a fan of Elvis Presley and White_House aide to Richard Nixon . Now he is the only surviving member of the Oval Office summit on Dec . 21 , 1970 , when the king of rock ' n ' roll met the President of the United States . Krogh , 55 , recounted that noon-hour meeting Saturday at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace , answering questions and signing copies of his book , &quot; The Day Elvis Met Nixon. &quot; &quot; ( The odds are ) probably a_million to one that anybody could drive_up , hand a letter in to ( request to ) see the President and have a meeting with him three hours later . It never happens , &quot; said Krogh , whose administrative responsibilities at the time included drug control policy development . Presley gave a White_House guard a six-page letter written_on American Airlines stationery , and Krogh -- moved by the missive ' s sincerity and authenticity -- met Presley in a screening interview . Presley indicated he wanted to help in the war on drugs , and Krogh decided Nixon and Presley , who was wearing a purple , crushed velvet suit with a cape , gold chains and belt , should meet . The only other person present throughout the meeting was White_House photographer Ollie Atkins . &quot; My overriding responsibility was with drug_abuse , and we had a major heroin problem , &quot; Krogh said , adding that Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix had recently died from drug overdoses . &quot; To have him show_up and say he was here to help was a godsend. &quot; The conversation between Nixon and Presley was scattered , Krogh said , straying from what had been discussed in the screening . But his intent was clear : He wanted to help the Administration &quot; in his own way &quot; in the war on illegal drugs . He also requested a badge from the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs -- which he had been denied earlier in the day by its deputy director , John Finlator . &quot; I ' d like to do that , &quot; Nixon said to Krogh . &quot; See that he gets one. &quot; The half-hour meeting ended with Presley ' s two bodyguards arriving to meet the President . Elvis asked Nixon for keepsakes for the pair and their wives . Krogh and the three guests then departed to the basement for lunch . &quot; Some of my days on the White_House staff would n ' t fit the description of fun , &quot; Krogh said . &quot; This was one of the most upbeat , positive , fun workdays I had. &quot;</TEXT>
