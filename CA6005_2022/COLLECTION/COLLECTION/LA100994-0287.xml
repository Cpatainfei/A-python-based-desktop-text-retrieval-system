   <HEADLINE> LOW-TECH WEATHER_FORECASTER HITS THE MARK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rough seas can sink Frank Bechtolt ' s dredging rig or drive it into the rocks . So when Bechtolt anchored his dredge outside the safety of Channel Islands Harbor last week , he turned_to a man who had provided him trustworthy wind and wave forecasts for 26 years . Surf shop owner Roger Nance relies_on the same weatherman to cut_through the mysteries of the Pacific and predict the arrival of big waves . Unlike other surfing competitions plagued by poor surf , Nance ' s 14 annual contests at Rincon Point are distinguished by a remarkable run of towering waves . Both men swear by forecaster Rea Strange , their oracle of ocean weather . So do the hundreds of other clients who entrust their livelihood , and sometimes their lives , to his marine weather predictions . &quot; I would n ' t leave home without him , or at least without his forecasts , &quot; said Sue Benech , a Ventura-based marine biologist who surveys the bottom of the ocean . &quot; He ' s been a lifesaver , an absolute wonder at predicting the weather. &quot; Predicting the weather is an imprecise business , with forecasts often thwarted by the shifting , swirling confluence of natural forces . Yet , for all_the unpredictable elements , Rea ( pronounced Ray ) Strange manages remarkable consistency in his forecasts , his clients and colleagues say . His secret : Drawing upon 37 years of watching weather patterns , he makes unequivocal predictions and then meticulously checks on what actually happens so he can refine his methodology . &quot; He has a better feeling for meteorology than any other meteorologist I ' ve ever met , &quot; said Nick Graham , a research meteorologist at Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla . &quot; In addition to his technical skills , his incredible memory makes him a genius in his field . He can remember what day_of_the_week his birthday was when he was 12. &quot; At age 63 , Strange remains one of the technological holdouts , plotting weather patterns the old-fashioned way -- by hand . While most meteorologists count_on satellite pictures and fancy computer_programs , Strange spends his days drawing weather_maps in his home_office in Montecito . He pores over data relayed from weather_stations , ships at_sea and buoys bobbing in the ocean to help him pencil in isobars -- those squiggly , concentric lines that encircle high- and low-pressure areas . His drafting table is covered with hand-drawn maps . Hundreds of them hang from clips on the walls . * Strange acknowledges that technology is catching_up_with him : Sophisticated computers are improving forecasts every year . Still , he said , he ' s unlikely to change his ways . &quot; I don ' t think I ' d get any better results , &quot; Strange said , stretching his lanky , athletic frame from the stool in his office . &quot; I ' m perfectly happy with the way I learned forecasting. &quot; Trained in meteorology by the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey in the mid-1950s , Strange moved to the area in late 1959 to advise oil_companies of wind , waves and weather that could endanger crews and equipment drilling for oil beneath the waters of the Santa Barbara Channel . He launched his own business , Pacific Weather Analysis , in 1977 , and his clientele consists primarily of oil_companies , shipping firms , dredging outfits and other businesses that ply their trade_in the ocean . He also provides weather_forecasts to county flood_control agencies , the America ' s Cup contenders and movie production crews . * On weekday mornings , he telephones KVEN-AM as &quot; Mr. Weather , &quot; the station ' s forecaster and straight_man on the Dave &amp; Bob Show . He uses the pseudonym Erich Wright , a name he and the station manager came_up with over lunch a decade ago . &quot; He wanted anonymity , and we wanted another name than the ' Strange Weather Report , ' &quot; said David Loe , president and general_manager of the Ventura station . Strange likes to keep a low profile to avoid calls from the public that take time away from his paying customers -- something particularly troublesome during heavy weather . Loe said Strange offers a unique service . &quot; We couldn ' t get that kind of specific forecast anywhere else , even with the new National Weather Service office in Oxnard. &quot; The National Weather Service dominates the forecasting industry . But , of necessity , most of its forecasts cover broad areas and are of marginal use in predicting local weather . That is where Strange has carved out his niche , pinpointing the weather_forecast for a specific location . His most loyal clients are those who need to know what looms just over the horizon . &quot; He ' s saved my bacon more_than once , &quot; said Tony Carter , the semi-retired owner of a tugboat company . For more_than 30 years , he has relied_on Strange to guide his tugs through calm seas while towing huge , tippy , oil construction rigs along the California coast . Bechtolt , the dredging project manager at Oxnard ' s Channel Islands Harbor , calls_on Strange to help him keep his equipment operating as long as it is safe . &quot; The longer I keep dredging , the more money I can make , &quot; Bechtolt said . * Last week , he anchored his dredge outside the harbor ' s protective seawalls to begin siphoning sand from near the entrance . As the project progressed , Bechtolt kept_in close contact with Strange to monitor any approaching swells or other hazard . &quot; He ' s about 99 % right , compared to the reports on the news , which are 50 % correct , &quot; Bechtolt said . &quot; I could have something sink or get washed_up on the beach . He ' ll tell me when I should pull my butt into a safe harbor. &quot; The clients of Strange have stories about his wizardry that helps them keep one step ahead of the weather . Nance , the surf shop owner , recalls seeking Strange ' s advice before setting the date of one of his first surfing contests . The day before the event , the ocean was as flat as a lake on a windless day . Local surfers flooded his shop with calls to postpone the contest . About 2 a.m. , as his guru foretold , the big swell arrived . Nance remembers it well . He lived_in a beach_house at the time and was awakened by the thunderous crash of the breakers . &quot; Every year at my contests , people come_up_to me and say , ' How did you ever know ? ' &quot; Indeed , Strange has been elevated to something of a mystical seer in some circles of surfers who are constantly on the prowl for big , peeling waves . His legendary status is reinforced by stories of his pinpointing the precise time a swell would hit the beach . Strange ' s daughter , Marianne , is familiar_with her father ' s reputation among veteran watermen . &quot; When the first sets of waves arrive , they say , ' Here come the Strange sets , ' &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve never minded it , but when I introduce myself to fishermen or surfers , they say , ' Are you Rea Strange ' s daughter ? ' They want to know all about him. &quot; * Rick Vogel , a longtime friend and big-wave surfer , said he has watched Strange perfect his wave forecasting over the years with empirical data that allowed him to revise the textbooks on the subject for his own use . In the mid-1970s , Strange would be as much as eight hours off on his predicted arrival of a swell , Vogel said . The gap has narrowed dramatically . &quot; I ' ve kept written records of all_of the swells he ' s forecasted and he nails 18 out of 20 , &quot; Vogel said . &quot; Anytime his forecast broke_down , he would be ticked_off about it . It usually translated into a gap in his data . With the right data , the guy ' s flawless. &quot; A framed color picture hangs_in Strange ' s office of Vogel surfing a thunderous 30-foot wave on Feb . 13 , 1983 , in northwestern Santa Barbara County . Strange had predicted the enormous swell . As for himself , Strange has carved out a niche not only as marine weather_forecaster but as a man who has simplified his personal life to its most important elements . He lives_in the Montecito foothills in a modest house with his wife of 38 years , Juliana , and a menagerie of dogs , cats and exotic birds always underfoot or flapping about . He finds order in the chaos by driving down the_hill to a beach for a three-fourths-mile ocean swim each afternoon . Strange takes_pride in his professional reputation , but he says his friends and clients have overblown the precision of his forecasts . &quot; There are so many damned ways you can be wrong , &quot; he said , &quot; and so few ways you can be right. &quot; His clients say his protests are characteristic of the thoughtful , reserved weatherman with extraordinary high standards , whom they have grown to trust . &quot; Just about every marine contractor relies very heavily on his information , &quot; said Chuck Ebner , Ventura operations manager of Oceaneering International Inc. , an underwater construction and services company . &quot; He is he closest guy to God that I know of as far as predicting the weather. &quot;</TEXT>
