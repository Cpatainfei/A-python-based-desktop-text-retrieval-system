   <HEADLINE> VIETNAM HOPES TO REFINE ITS OIL_INDUSTRY ; ENERGY : PETROLEUM IS THE COUNTRY ' S BIGGEST EXPORT , BUT FOR NOW IT MUST DEPEND ON SOVIET-AGE EQUIPMENT TO DO THE JOB .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Grigori Borisov used to struggle in temperatures of 40 below zero to pump oil from the icy tundra of Western Siberia . Now he seeks refuge in an air-conditioned office to escape the heat blanketing the oil platform he operates in the South_China_Sea . Borisov works for VietSovPetro , the only company producing commercial amounts of petroleum in Vietnam . He serves as deputy chief of Platform Four , a rusty monument to outdated oil technology in the Bach Ho , or White Tiger , oil field 75 miles southeast of the southern port of Vung Tau . Vietnam ' s partner in VietSovPetro , the Soviet_Union , dissolved in 1991 , forcing Hanoi to look elsewhere for funds and expertise to develop its oil_industry . Oil is Vietnam ' s biggest export , and the government has signed 27 contracts with foreign companies to explore for more . Some of the newcomers -- Asians , Europeans and , most recently , Americans -- have brought advanced drill_bits and computer work stations to aid the search off Vietnam ' s southern coast . But so far , VietSovPetro ' s aged equipment remains the country ' s only way to get precious petrodollars . Borisov ' s platform is one of the oldest in a cluster of 10 VietSovPetro rigs now producing oil at Bach Ho . &quot; It ' s been in_use for eight years already , &quot; he says . &quot; We need to improve and upgrade the whole platform. &quot; Rust acts like a cancer , eating through bulkheads made of poor-quality Soviet steel . Control_room engineers read old-style pen-and-paper gauges . Rig workers wear sneakers instead of steel-toed boots . &quot; If you compare VietSovPetro with advanced international oil_companies , we ' re just not as good , &quot; Borisov says during an interview in his cramped office beneath the platform ' s helicopter pad . Borisov , a native of Western Siberia ' s Surgut City , says he wants to install new pumps and compressors made in Britain or Germany and that he hopes to learn from the modern techniques of Western companies such_as Mobil Corp . and France ' s Total . VietSovPetro is a relic of the communist ties that bound Vietnam with its former Soviet patron . The two formed the joint_venture in 1981 to extract oil from a field first identified by Mobil . Ukrainians , Azerbaijanis and Russians such_as Borisov supervise and labor alongside Vietnamese on the platforms , manning alternate shifts of 15 days each . Platform Four started pumping oil in 1987 . Its wells yield 7 # 700 barrels of oil a day , which are deposited in a tanker moored nearby . The platform also produces 5.8 million cubic_feet of natural_gas each day . However , VietSovPetro has no way to transport the gas to potential customers , so it is burned_off . A natural_gas flame 30 feet long burns from the tip of a boom jutting skyward at Platform Four . A steady supply of gas keeps the fire burning day and night , just as it does on Bach Ho ' s other rigs . A gas pipeline scheduled to be completed this month connecting the offshore field with Vung Tau should help end the waste , says Ngo Thuong San , VietSovPetro general director . The company also plans in November to begin producing oil at Rong , or Dragon , another , smaller field 12 miles to the southwest . But VietSovPetro is already hard-pressed to raise the $ 300 million it needs each year just to develop Bach Ho , San says . When not working 12-hour shifts , the employees on Platform Four watch videos , play table_tennis or swim in the rig ' s tiled pool . Alcohol is forbidden , and personal touches are scarce . For the platform ' s 62 men , offshore work means long stretches of life without women -- except for the companionship of three female housekeepers . Some of the crew seem not to mind . &quot; For Vietnamese , 15 days is nothing , &quot; says mechanic Vu Hai Dang . &quot; Remember , during the ( Vietnam ) War , soldiers were at the front for a lot longer than that. &quot;</TEXT>
