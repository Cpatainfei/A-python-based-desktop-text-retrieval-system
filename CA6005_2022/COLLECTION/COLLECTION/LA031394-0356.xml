   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; WILL HUFFINGTON ' S PURSE_STRINGS TANGLE SENATE_RACE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just a_few months ago , campaign handicappers were counting Dianne Feinstein ' s reelection to the U.S. Senate as one of this year ' s best bets in California . After two consecutive statewide campaigns , she has the profile of a centrist Democrat that looked_to be a close match for the modern California voter . And during an active first year in Washington , she pushed her poll numbers into the range where incumbents are rarely threatened . But at Feinstein headquarters today , the staff is preparing to fight for the senator ' s political life in a race they expect will probably be more expensive than any congressional contest in U.S. history . The reason is Rep . Michael Huffington ( R-Santa Barbara ) . Huffington , 46 , a little-known freshman in Congress who only moved to California a_few years ago , would ordinarily be regarded_as a minor annoyance for a powerful veteran such_as Feinstein . But the former Texas oilman is a multimillionaire who shook the political landscape in 1992 when he spent more_than $ 5 million of_his_own money to unseat a popular GOP veteran . Now he seems to have something similar in mind for the entire state . His bank_account has already scared_off some of the Republican_Party ' s rising stars who had considered the race . And those remaining in the June 7 GOP primary are regarded_as such long_shots that Huffington has set his sights on a November showdown with Feinstein . &quot; The only reason that Dianne . . . has to worry about reelection is the size of Huffington ' s personal war_chest and his avowed willingness to spend it , &quot; said Democratic campaign consultant Darry Sragow , who managed Feinstein ' s 1990 gubernatorial campaign but is not involved in this year ' s Senate_race . &quot; She is in a strong position , but were I advising Dianne , I would suggest she not take the race lightly. &quot; California ' s size and diversity has forced its statewide candidates to become television celebrities because it is the only medium that has proved effective at reaching millions of voters . And because it costs millions of dollars to become a familiar face in living rooms from Eureka to San Diego , California ' s statewide offices have been limited to those who are well-known or those with enormous amounts_of_money . Feinstein is ranked sixth among the wealthiest elected officers in Washington and when she ran_for governor in 1990 she spent about $ 3 million of_her_own money in a losing effort . But she spent none of_her_own money to win the Senate seat two years ago and for once will face an opponent even richer than she is . Roll_Call , a weekly newspaper in Washington , has estimated her wealth , mostly from her husband ' s investments , at $ 50 million , and Huffington ' s at $ 75 million . Huffington campaign watchers from both parties are wondering how much of his fortune the Republican candidate is willing to risk on this race . With personal money and contributions , Huffington has said his minimum campaign budget is about $ 15 million compared to the $ 10 million Feinstein ' s staff is planning . Some Democrats speculate that he may be willing to send this race into the financial stratosphere by spending $ 20 million -- more_than five times the national average for a Senate_race . If so , the campaign will wander into uncharted territory where conventional rules do not apply . Huffington said in an interview that his campaign budget might run_over $ 20 million , but added : &quot; I hope not. &quot; Democrats believe that Huffington has spent more_than $ 1 million on television commercials and sources say he has pledged at least $ 2 million to the state Republican_Party ' s grass-roots effort . The money will help GOP candidates throughout the state and it has won the newcomer a lot of friends . Last week he was endorsed by the state Senate Republican caucus , a rare action before a GOP primary . &quot; Michael Huffington , a respected businessman , has proven that he has what it takes_to win , &quot; Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy said in a statement . &quot; He represents the party ' s best chance to regain this Senate seat. &quot; Huffington will face two Republicans who have promised to wage active campaigns in the June 7 primary . Candidate William E . Dannemeyer , 63 , is a former seven-term Orange County congressman who made his reputation as a champion of conservative causes and an outspoken opponent of homosexuals . Now he accuses Huffington of practicing liberal politics that threaten the nation ' s economic and social well-being . &quot; Based on your short voting record , I have a question for you , &quot; Dannemeyer wrote to Huffington in a recent letter . &quot; Why don ' t you re-register as a Democrat ? &quot; Huffington ' s other primary challenger is a 34-year-old Riverside attorney , Kate Squires , who is a newcomer to politics . Some Republican conservatives who are unhappy with Huffington are quietly encouraging Dannemeyer and Squires . But neither has shown the financial horsepower needed to wage an effective statewide campaign and even some of their supporters say they expect Huffington to be the party ' s nominee . Both campaigns have indicated that they will focus their efforts on each other . Huffington ' s first job is to introduce himself to California voters . So over the last month he has broadcast a trilogy of television commercials throughout the state . One spot focused_on crime , another on his biography as a businessman , and a third raised the issue of social values . Huffington has not targeted Feinstein directly in his television commercials yet , but in speeches to Republican groups he has outlined his campaign ' s strategy to defeat the incumbent . The Republican plans to call attention to Feinstein ' s vote last year for President Clinton ' s deficit reduction package of tax increases and spending_cuts and to her Democratic colleague in the Senate , Barbara Boxer . He contends the picture will show Feinstein to be a big-spending liberal who has made a career out of politics . &quot; My main concern about Mrs . Feinstein is her vote on the budget -- that is the reason I really got involved in this race , &quot; Huffington said in a recent speech in Sacramento . &quot; Her rhetoric is moderate , but her actions are liberal. &quot; Taking_advantage of a line the two California senators used in the closing days of their 1992 campaign , Huffington added : &quot; She and Mrs . Boxer , who is not known as a moderate , are the Thelma and Louise of the United States Senate. &quot; Feinstein , 60 , has not broadcast any television commercials yet and she has not targeted Huffington in her public speeches . But in comments to reporters she has clearly framed the contest as one between a proven and dedicated public_servant and an ambitious opportunist who has little knowledge of California , let alone how to solve its problems . In many ways , she has had her eye on this race ever since she was elected in November , 1992 , to serve the two years remaining in the Senate term left vacant by Pete Wilson ' s election to governor . She has been given credit for helping to fund more Border_Patrol guards , securing disaster aid for California and persuading a cautious Senate to embrace her controversial ban on military-style semiautomatic rifles . &quot; I believe I ' ve demonstrated that I can be effective , &quot; Feinstein said in an interview Friday . &quot; So I ' m asking the people who voted for me two years ago to reinforce that vote and elect me for a full six-year term. &quot; Feinstein ' s campaign intends to make generous use of the charge that Huffington is trying to buy the election and that he is a carpetbagger who only moved to California from Texas in 1991 . They also contend that Huffington ' s fortune is inherited , not earned . &quot; I ' m running against a Texan who , in his luggage , brought a lot of money , &quot; she said in an interview . &quot; He ran_for the House , got there , and decided in eight months that it wasn ' t for him , so he ' s trying_for the Senate . I don ' t think that washes in California . &quot; The only thing that California would elect ( in Huffington ) is a dollar_sign , &quot; she added . &quot; There is not one product of public service. &quot; Huffington ' s campaign says it is happy to debate his inexperience in government and use of personal funds . With so many voters unhappy about government ' s performance , Huffington contends that experience in Congress is not a campaign asset . And by using his personal funds , Huffington said he will not depend_on special_interests to win election . &quot; I hope she spends $ 2 million talking_about his inexperience , &quot; said Ken Khachigian , a Huffington campaign adviser . &quot; It shows how out of touch she is to think that ( the voters ' ) concept of experience is picking_up a government check every week. &quot; Both candidates are considered moderates within their parties and their positions overlap on a number of prominent issues . Except for the vote on Clinton ' s budget package , it is unclear how many issues will distinguish Feinstein and Huffington . Both favor abortion rights and have opposed discrimination against homosexuals . On crime , both said they favor gun_control , the death_penalty and the new &quot; three strikes &quot; anti-crime law . On immigration , both have called_for more border guards and a cutback in public_services to illegal immigrants . With the prospect of a political_campaign between a pair of multimillionaires , the race is certain to stimulate debate about the political power of money . After Huffington and other millionaire House candidates ran in 1992 , Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) authored a bill that seeks to equalize the playing_field for candidates with average incomes . It would eliminate the $ 1 # 000 contribution limit on federal candidates only until they match the personal contribution made by a wealthy opponent . &quot; We basically have given the advantage to rich people who may or may_not know anything about politics and who have very little ideological commitment but who have big bank_accounts , &quot; said Rohrabacher , who said he will remain neutral in the GOP Senate primary . &quot; This applies to both Michael Huffington and Dianne Feinstein. &quot;</TEXT>
