   <TEXT> Faced with tinderbox tension in Cuban detention camps here and diminishing Cuban American support for its internment policy , the Clinton_Administration appears willing to back_away from a vow that none of the 30 # 000 refugees held here will be permitted into the United States . In the next few days , 15 Cuban children , including one with leukemia and a newborn infant , are expected to be flown to the United States for humanitarian reasons , according to members of an ad_hoc advisory committee of Cuban Americans at a Miami press_conference Thursday . Each child will be accompanied by an unknown number of family members . But late Thursday , U.S. Justice_Department spokesman Carl Stern said that the request is still under review and has not been granted . He added , however , that even if approved , the humanitarian release of the 15 and their families would not signal any change in U.S. policy . &quot; Obviously , the rules are not inflexible , &quot; Stern said . &quot; There are always going_to be exceptions for humanitarian reasons , medical concerns or the like. &quot; On Sept . 10 , reiterating a policy first announced Aug . 19 in an effort to shut_off the waves of Cuban rafters entering Florida , U.S. Atty . Gen . Janet Reno said that any Cubans wishing to enter the United States must apply from Cuba . &quot; They will not be eligible for processing into the U.S. from Guantanamo , &quot; she said . Although the Clinton_Administration won the backing of many Cuban American leaders for its detention policy in exchange for tighter sanctions against the government of Fidel Castro , the prospect of detaining Cubans was never popular in Miami . News media reports of the stark living conditions and pictures of Cubans in tent cities surrounded by concertina wire and military_police have only heightened the level of frustration among Cuban Americans . The frustration among those in the camps is even higher . &quot; Clearly , we have an explosive situation . Anything can happen , from a disturbance to an epidemic , &quot; said Guarione M . Diaz , appointed by the Clinton_Administration to serve as civilian ombudsman for the Cubans here . The release of the first group of Cubans from Guantanamo is seen by many in the Cuban American community as the beginning of a process in which eventually all those in detention will be given a chance to enter the United States . &quot; We never agreed that Cubans could be held there indefinitely , only that they could be held until a solution was found , &quot; said Ninoska Perez , director of the Cuban-American National Foundation ' s short-wave radio_station , which broadcasts daily to Cuba . &quot; Now we have been offering solutions . Those with relatives have sponsors . We will find sponsors for the others . &quot; Conditions in the camps are deplorable , &quot; added Perez , whose visit here this week touched_off a hunger_strike at one camp after she was denied entrance . U.S. military officials said that Perez , traveling as a reporter , was with a group of journalists whose arrival coincided with a food delivery , so they were denied entrance to that camp . They subsequently toured another Cuban camp . Indeed , even the commander of the joint task_force overseeing the camps for the Cubans and 14 # 000 Haitian migrants admitted that living conditions are barely adequate and that the camps could erupt into violence . &quot; There is an awful lot of tension , frustration and anger in those camps , &quot; said Brig . Gen Mike Williams of the U.S. Marine Corps . &quot; There is work to be done before they meet even the minimal humane standards we ' d like to set. &quot; The newest Cuban camp , called Oscar I , is a stark illustration . Here , on a relatively flat piece_of_land within sight of a rolling , scrub-brush minefield and a U.S. guard tower at the border between Cuba and the 45-square-mile U.S. naval base , more_than 3 # 300 men , women and children are waiting out their fate under a sea of canvas . &quot; We are being treated like animals here , &quot; said Isiah Alonso , 38 , who was an English_teacher at Havana ' s Institute of Foreign Affairs before he , his wife , Ileana , their two young daughters and 15 other family members got_into a boat that he bought for $ 2 # 000 . &quot; We are being held political_prisoners by Clinton. &quot; Although complaints about the food , the stench of the portable toilets and the heat are common to both the Cubans and to the Haitians interned nearby , many of the Cuban camps have been erected on freshly bulldozed land , where the slightest rain turns the bare earth to mud . Shower facilities are minimal . No mail has been delivered and many people complain that relatives in Cuba and the United States have received no word yet on whether they lived or died after setting_off to sea , often in flimsy rafts . Telephone_lines , only for collect_calls to the United States , are to be ready today , according to AT &amp; T officials . Without much shade , temperatures are high , tempers short . So far , only a_few dozen Cubans have been isolated because of disciplinary problems , Williams said . &quot; Most realize that violence doesn ' t help , &quot; he added . &quot; But the peacefulness of the camps is only an inch deep. &quot; Most of those in Oscar I left Cuba after the Administration had reversed a 32-year-old policy and announced that Cubans would not be automatically welcomed to the United States . But many said they climbed_on a raft anyway , unable or unwilling to accept that Guantanamo would not be a rest stop on the way to Florida . Of the more_than 33 # 000 rafters picked_up after Aug . 19 , and sent to Guantanamo , about 2 # 500 have volunteered to go_to a temporary camp in Panama . &quot; We are not_bad people , &quot; said Ileana Alonso , 35 , as she sat on an army cot under a sand-colored tent . &quot; We knew about the American policy ( of detention ) , but we also know that policy has to change. &quot; While a growing number of Haitians are choosing to return to their homeland as democracy is restored , the Cubans have no such option . But almost 60 Cubans have fled the camp to return home , either by swimming or by making_it through the minefield , according to Cuban officials . U.S. military authorities have stopped at least 20 others . Williams said he suspects that a_few Cubans get_out of the camps every day . Representatives of the Castro government and the U.S. State_Department reportedly are working_on a plan for Cuban repatriation that could include paying those who return to Cuba a cash resettlement stipend . Williams called a method of returning willing Cubans to Cuba &quot; the most critical need . That is absolutely my No . 1 priority , to get that solved. &quot; Unsolicited , about 44 Cubans have offered to go_back to Cuba . Williams said that the rest of the Cubans will not be surveyed about their wish to return until a plan to repatriate them is in place . Most , however , seem determined to stay . &quot; People left Cuba with one idea -- to get_to the U.S. , &quot; said Francisco Escobar , 31 , a leader in camp Oscar I who was heading_up a hunger_strike to protest the decision to turn Perez away on Tuesday . About 200 people moved their cots from the tents and pushed them together next to the fence_in protest . &quot; This is a hard life here , but life was even harder in Cuba , &quot; Escobar said . &quot; We know the history of the United States , the generosity of the American people . They understand who we are : men , women , old people , children . &quot; We will make it. &quot; In Miami , meanwhile , Cuban American radio_stations and civic groups are piling_up donations of money , foodstuffs and clothing for the camps . In the first of several shipments , a load of 2 # 300 pounds of powdered_milk is to arrive by chartered aircraft this weekend , according to ombudsman Diaz . &quot; The military is doing the best it can , &quot; said Diaz , who commutes weekly between Guantanamo , Miami and Washington . &quot; In the short term , we need immediate improvements . &quot; In the long term , we need to find an alternative. &quot; Times researcher Anna M . Virtue in Miami and staff writer Robert L . Jackson in Washington contributed to this story.CUBA</TEXT>
