   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / HARRY BERNSTEIN : OLD_GUARD WANTS TO SMITE THE REFORMER ; TEAMSTERS ' RON CAREY IS TARGETED BY LOW-LEVEL OFFICIALS RESENTFUL OF HIS CHANGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ron Carey is under intense attack these days by those he battled two years ago to become president of the giant Teamsters Union . Carey helped clean_out the mobsters , and is still battling old-guard leaders who tolerated mob dominance for decades . The government-supervised election that Carey won was held after the union ' s former leaders agreed to it to avoid prosecution on racketeering charges . The union was crime-ridden for years . Its top officers supported anti-union presidential candidates Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan and George_Bush . They were accused of making sweetheart deals with some companies . Now , Carey , the progressive reformist , is in_trouble . The union is spending more on everything from new organizing drives and higher strike benefits than it receives in dues from its 1.4 million members . One of Carey ' s foes estimates that nearly 70 % of the entrenched , lower-level officers of the union oppose him , despite his clear victory when all members voted_in the union ' s first-ever referendum . Carey has not been good news for anti-worker management , either . He and his allies have started waging highly visible , readily justified fights against reactionary companies . He backs strikes by personally joining picket_lines and boldly proposed a dues increase -- first in a decade -- to keep paying $ 200 weekly strike benefits ( raised from $ 50 ) and push more reforms . Carey and his allies have initiated major , badly needed organizing campaigns to make_up for the loss in recent years of nearly 500 # 000 members -- losses that came largely because of intense anti-union campaigns by management and the creation of thousands of small , non-union trucking_companies made_possible by trucking_industry deregulation . The reformists not only made a 180-degree turn_in the union ' s national-level political stance by backing moderately liberal Democrat Bill_Clinton , but they also are intensifying their fight for universal health_care , labor-law reform and a broad , liberal legislative agenda . Some of the most vicious attacks on Carey are coming from men like Alfonso D ' Arco , a one-time member of the Luchese crime family who quit the mob and began talking to law-enforcement . D ' Arco claimed that Carey himself had links to the underworld -- an unsubstantiated accusation that Carey calls &quot; smut. &quot; More important to his reputation is support from Michael H . Holland , a former general counsel of the United Mine Workers of America who was named by a tough federal judge to supervise the first referendum in the union ' s 89-year history -- one member , one vote . All past presidents were elected at tightly controlled conventions . &quot; There is simply no believable evidence that Carey is anything but the upstanding , honest trade_unionist that I have found him to be , &quot; Holland told me . The union is still being supervised by a court-appointed independent review board that includes former FBI Director William H . Webster and a former federal judge , Frederick B . Lacey . The board itself says it has been given no credible evidence to support the claim that Carey is linked to the underworld . Several long-time Teamsters officers say they don ' t believe that Carey was linked to gangsters . But he is facing different attacks from them and other lower-level Teamsters officers who tolerated mob leadership even though they themselves were clean and usually effective unionists at local and regional levels . They complain that Carey isn ' t an effective leader , appoints &quot; outsiders &quot; who have had no experience with their union to top posts and that he is now jeopardizing the union ' s future by calling_for a nationwide membership referendum to boost union dues without first holding a convention . The convention could also pass resolutions undercutting him by taking_away much of his authority as president . Carey ' s plan to let all members vote on the increase is a daring risk -- like holding a nationwide referendum on whether voters want a tax increase . If the dues hike is defeated , the strike fund would be out of money by next June and the union ' s general treasury would run_dry next year . The proposal is being denounced by Carey ' s foes , putting them in open rebellion against him . It would be a sad chapter for the union movement if the Teamsters ' first-ever reformist president -- the first elected by a majority vote among all members instead of by delegates to those carefully managed union conventions that allowed mob domination for so many years -- is rejected .</TEXT>
