   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; AILING HEALTH REFORM COULD STAGE RECOVERY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eleven months ago , when President Clinton stood before a joint session of Congress and unveiled his health_care reform proposals to bipartisan applause , the effort to restructure the nation ' s health system looked_like a marathon_runner heading for the final mile . Today , the effort more closely resembles a patient on life support . Of course , the patient ' s parlous condition does not rule_out a recovery . Congressional veterans can reel_off examples of weighty legislation , from deregulation of natural_gas prices in the late 1970s to tax reform in the mid-1980s , that died a_thousand deaths but rose in the end . In the Senate , particularly , Democratic leader George J . Mitchell of Maine appears to have stitched together a package that could , eventually , gain a majority . Republicans have so far blocked votes on any amendments to Mitchell ' s bill -- a sign , perhaps , that they believe that if test votes were held , Mitchell would win . But in the House , which many oddsmakers had thought would have an easier time with health_care reform , action has stalled , with no firm indication of when it might resume . And even Mitchell ' s Senate bill faces high hurdles . Many key senators , while saying they could accept central parts of the measure , reject a proposed new tax on high-cost health plans designed to discourage excessive health spending and to generate revenue for subsidies to low- and middle-income working families . Others , including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , have raised serious questions about whether key elements of Mitchell ' s plan , necessary as political compromises , would be unworkable in practice . Administration officials and their allies argue that only large-scale reform will work -- that incremental changes in the health system are the equivalent of trying to jump halfway across a gorge . But those arguments run_up against the natural tendency of Congress to seek a politically safe middle ground . &quot; You cannot control costs , you cannot reform the insurance industry unless you have universal coverage , &quot; said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John D . Dingell ( D-Mich. ) . But , Dingell conceded , incremental alternatives will be very attractive to &quot; all_the white mice and all_the timid souls who want to rush through this thing and say we have voted for a compromise. &quot; Finally , even if those problems can be surmounted , all reform efforts now face the awful pressure of the clock , which threatens to tick down before a bill can be enacted . What went_wrong ? The answer , according to White_House officials , members of Congress , lobbyists and congressional observers , is a host of factors : The inherent difficulty of the enterprise , Clinton ' s weaknesses as chief_executive , declining voter anxiety about the economy , the increasingly partisan Republican response , deep-grained public skepticism about government , and White_House missteps in the preparation and sale of the health plan all combined to reduce the prospects of any reform bill ' s passage . The biggest single problem might simply be the scale of the effort . Health_care accounts_for more_than one-seventh of the U.S. economy , affects almost every interest_group in the nation and touches the average family at the most personal level . In recent weeks , Clinton has taken_to noting that Franklin D . Roosevelt , Harry S . Truman , Lyndon B . Johnson and Richard Nixon all tried -- and failed -- to get major health_care reform bills through Congress . Unstated , but implied , in such statements is the message that voters should not blame him too_much if he also falls_short . Even some of Clinton ' s opponents accept that argument . &quot; It ' s just a huge undertaking , &quot; said Rep . Jim Slattery ( D-Kan. ) , whose opposition was one reason that the Energy and Commerce Committee failed in its effort to write a health_care bill . &quot; I don ' t know that you can say that somebody ' s strategy failed , or that somebody was the bad_guy . . . . It ' s a bridge too far. &quot; White_House officials like to compare health_care reform with enactment of Social_Security under Roosevelt and Medicare under Johnson . But &quot; Medicare passed after the 1964 landslide against Barry Goldwater , and Social_Security passed after one of the greatest crises in American history , &quot; noted Republican strategist William Kristol . In trying to repeat such a feat without a major crisis to spur action , &quot; there was a little bit of hubris here , &quot; he said . Indeed , in one of the ironies of the debate , Clinton ' s successes on economic_policy might have undermined his case for health_care reform . As the economy has improved , middle-class Americans have stopped worrying so_much that they might soon lose their jobs , and thereby lose their health benefits . That change might have made them less willing to support major restructuring of the health_care system , although pollsters disagree about the strength of the link between the two issues . What no analysts disagree about is that an undertaking as huge as reshaping the health_care system has been made doubly difficult by the deep skepticism Americans feel toward government . For many lawmakers , those doubts have been symbolized by a story , often repeated on Capitol_Hill , about a member of Congress who was accosted by an angry constituent who said he opposed the health bill . &quot; I don ' t want the government messing_around in Medicare , &quot; the constituent said , apparently unaware , or unwilling to concede , that the giant medical program for the elderly is a wholly government-run enterprise . So_long as Clinton talked_about the problems facing the health_care system , a majority of Americans agreed with him . But as soon as he , or anyone else , began outlining proposed solutions , doubts began to overwhelm the proposals . &quot; If you look_at our society in_general , there are so many splintered voices of authority , and there is so_much skepticism , even cynicism , about the political process , &quot; said First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . Because of that skepticism , she said , &quot; huge amounts_of_money spent to convey an intense , negative message has a very powerful impact. &quot; Despite those inherent problems , many say they believe that the Administration could have handled its case better . The first stage of the process , the lengthy study by an Administration task_force run_by Hillary Clinton and White_House policy adviser Ira Magaziner , comes_in_for almost universal criticism inside and outside the Administration . The task_force worked in secrecy , allowing opponents to plant the idea that its participants were up_to no good . While the First_Lady and others held extensive talks with members of Congress , including Republicans , the failure to include any in the task_force lost what could have been a key opportunity to co-opt potential opponents . Despite the length of the task_force process , when the President finally presented his plan in a nationally televised speech last September , the White_House was still unprepared . Officials had talked_of having booklets and other explanatory material ready to send across the country in_order to make the case to voters following the President ' s speech . Instead , they had nothing . At a time when Americans were deeply curious about exactly what Clinton was suggesting , opponents were able to fill an information vacuum with their own derogatory descriptions of the plan . Some critics argue that the President and his aides made a crucial error by insisting on providing health coverage to everyone instead of starting with a less-sweeping package , then compounded the error this past winter when Clinton vowed during his State of the Union speech to veto any bill that did not include universal coverage . &quot; They were attached_to madness . They were attached_to scientific impossibility , &quot; complained one senior congressional aide . &quot; If they would have gone_to 95 % ( coverage ) in March , they could have had ( Senate Republican leader ) Bob Dole . We ' d be in a legislating mode now , rather than a frenzy . They ' ve missed every single turn_in the road in timing. &quot; White_House officials angrily deny that . &quot; I thought the veto threat was a good idea then . I still think it was a good idea , &quot; said one senior official . &quot; It shows people what we are fighting for . People know where ( Clinton ) stands. &quot; The real problem , according to this official and others in the White_House , is that Clinton ' s political weakness on issues other_than health_care caused Republicans earlier this year to abandon conciliation and move to an all-out attack . Last year , for example , 20 Republican senators , including Dole , co-sponsored a bill that promised to achieve universal coverage through a requirement that all individuals buy insurance . Dole publicly said he thought the country faced a health_care &quot; crisis &quot; and sharply criticized Kristol for urging Congress to reject Clinton ' s plans outright . By now , all 20 of those Republicans have disavowed their original plan , Dole has abandoned talk_of a crisis , and talk_of compromise has faded_away . &quot; When they sensed a political opening , their support for health_care melted away , &quot; the senior White_House official said . &quot; This had a lot to do with events outside of health_care , &quot; referring to such problems as Whitewater , the sexual-harassment suit filed against Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones and the Administration ' s reversals on foreign_policy matters . Indeed , even Republican strategists such_as Kristol agree that in late winter and early spring , GOP opposition to health_care reform began to harden . Lawmakers who earlier talked_of compromise began to speak more openly of killing Clinton ' s bill outright . The increasingly fierce nature of the opposition compounded a pre-existing problem : Clinton ' s potential allies in the health_care reform fight proved far more timid than his opponents . Administration strategists knew that many small businesses would reject any plan with the so-called employer mandate requiring companies to purchase insurance for their workers , but they hoped to gain significant support from big businesses that already provide coverage . Instead , while some businesses , such_as automobile and steel_companies , have lobbied for Clinton ' s plan , most large companies have stayed_on the sidelines , in part because top_executives , most of whom are Republicans and conservative , decided they were uncomfortable pushing for a liberal Democratic initiative . The U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce started_out in favor of the employer mandate . But in February , its board retracted that support . Within days , two other business groups -- the National Assn . of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable -- joined in the rejection of Clinton-style plans . Similarly , the American Medical Assn . endorsed universal coverage and the employer mandate two years ago , but backed_off last December . In July , the AMA shifted position again , joining the AFL-CIO and the American Assn . of Retired Persons to again call_for universal coverage . This past week , the doctors flipped a third time , saying they would support an incremental reform bill proposed by conservatives in the House , rather than the universal coverage bills backed by the Democratic leadership . Meanwhile , some groups that had much to gain from comprehensive health_care reform remained eerily silent . Some hoped to gain greater bargaining leverage , others were unsure what to do . The most notable was the AARP , whose 33 million members would have benefited from Clinton ' s proposals to expand coverage for long-term care and outpatient prescription_drugs . The AARP ' s leadership resisted repeated personal overtures from the President to support his plan . Instead , like other groups that were generally in favor of the Clinton approach , the AARP talked up long-term care and drug coverage without mentioning Clinton . This became a pattern throughout the past 18 months . &quot; People who opposed reform attacked the Clinton plan by name . But supporters just talked up the elements , &quot; said one lobbyist . Only this past week did the AARP leadership explicitly endorse the Democratic bills . Those who opposed Clinton from the outset have been not at all reticent . The Health_Insurance Assn . of America represents small- and mid-sized insurance_firms , many of which faced bankruptcy under a Clinton-type reform plan . The HIAA launched the highly successful &quot; Harry and Louise &quot; ad_campaign that raised doubts about the President ' s plan . The opposition came even though HIAA shared many of Clinton ' s other goals , such_as the employer mandate and universal coverage . Earlier this year , HIAA President Willis D . Gradison Jr . met with White_House officials Harold M . Ickes and George Stephanopoulos and , during the course of a long conversation , suggested that an effective advertising_campaign could be made to promote their common goals . In the end , those talks came_to naught . The combination of hesitant support from friends and unstinting opposition from foes has left many senior legislators and Administration officials exhausted and dispirited . &quot; Ultimately , a lot of us , a lot of groups , have to sublimate their concerns to some extent in_order to get the group , the society , to be able to step_forward and to change things for the better , &quot; said House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) . &quot; If everyone is just going_to focus in on their narrow viewpoint on a particular issue , we ' re never going_to get_to the consensus that we ' ve got_to have in this society to move forward. &quot; And after months of fighting , some in the Administration have begun , at times , talking in the language of post-mortems . &quot; You win some and you lose some , but at least you kind of pushed the ball and you keep moving the public_debate , &quot; Hillary Clinton said in a recent interview . &quot; So I think this is a political issue that is not going_to go_away , no matter what happens. &quot; Times staff writers Karen Tumulty and Edwin Chen contributed to this story .</TEXT>
