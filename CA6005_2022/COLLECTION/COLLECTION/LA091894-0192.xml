   <HEADLINE> RITE OF PASSAGE ; THE PANAMA_CANAL IS 51 MILES OF ' THE GREATEST LIBERTY MAN HAS EVER TAKEN WITH NATURE ' -- AND A PRIZED JEWEL IN THE CRUISE-LOVER ' S CROWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Atlantic begins here , the Pacific over there , and between them lie 51 miles of deep ditch , aged machinery , steamy jungle , epic engineering , malarial history and murky politics . Every 45 minutes or so , another big boat floats past in the humidity , bearing oil or bananas or lumber or tourists through a 110-foot-wide passage of concrete and steel . This is the jewel that so many cruise-lovers are so eager to wear in their crowns . The Panama_Canal , which opened 80 years ago last month , is also the public-works project that English writer James Bryce called &quot; the greatest liberty man has ever taken with nature , &quot; a short-cut that saves about 8 # 000 miles of South_American circumnavigation on the journey between New York and San Francisco . That position makes_it arguably the most valuable piece of real_estate in the Western_hemisphere , and it ' s no surprise that the world is watching to see how the U.S. and Panamanian governments handle their obligations to transfer ownership and operation of the canal on Dec . 31 , 1999 . What may strike some people as peculiar is the canal ' s parallel life as a tourist attraction . After all , American tourists are seldom seduced by engineering prowess alone . ( Who would seek_out the Hoover_Dam if it weren ' t convenient to Las Vegas ? Who goes_to Alaska to see the oil_pipeline ? ) Cruise customers most often seek_out creature comforts , coastal panoramas of uncompromised nature and prime shopping opportunities , none of which are found at the Panama_Canal . Yet instead of viewing the canal as an obligatory stop for cruise lines , cruise passengers embrace passage as a badge of worldliness , a chance to spend eight or 10 hours steeping , quite literally , in history . The hour may be early , and the air outside may be moist , but cruisers merrily crowd the decks when the heavy machinery and narrow locks come_into view . Some of these cruisers neither know nor care how the engines in their automobiles work_at home , but they ' ll gather_in throngs to marvel at the idea that the gates of these locks are driven by the sputterings of a mere 40-horsepower motor . My canal ship came_in last May . It was a newly reconditioned 20-year-old vessel called the Star Odyssey , and it needed to be in Alaska for the summer glacier-watching season . To get_it there and lure passengers on the way , the Star Odyssey ' s keeper at Royal Cruise Line arranged a 15-day cruise , beginning in Aruba , calling_at Curacao , the canal , Puerto Caldera ( Costa Rica ) , Acapulco , Puerto Vallarta , Los Angeles and San Francisco . The ship was 674 feet long and 83 feet wide -- which would give the captain about 13 feet of leeway on either side as we slipped through the canal ' s locks -- with 404 passenger cabins and a capacity of 750 . We had 10 decks , a casino , a swimming_pool , a spa , a sauna , a weight room and aerobics area , a show lounge , a movie_theater , five bar areas and a dining_room large enough to accommodate all passengers in one sitting . The average age was between 65 and 70 . ( &quot; Philadelphia &quot; was among the films screened on the cruise , but many of the 600-plus passengers on my cruise , thinking_of another movie from another time , kept referring to it as &quot; Philadelphia Story. &quot; ) One reason for the advanced average age was simple economics : A 15-day cruise requires hefty amounts_of_time and money . Another was that Royal cruises tend to attract older , more affluent travelers who have cruised with the line before . But another crucial reason was the canal itself . Unlike most Caribbean or Mediterranean itineraries , it included many days without port calls -- eight , in all . A day at_sea is a thing of beauty to a veteran cruiser , an unbroken expanse of time , rich_in possibilities for subtle variation on pacifying routines . And then there was the central element in the canal itinerary , the busy ditch itself . &quot; It ' s the greatest wonder in the world , &quot; said Roy Hamby , a veteran cruiser . Talking with Hamby and others , I realized one key to the canal ' s popularity : For some of us schooled since World_War_II , the canal was a matter of about 12 paragraphs in an 11th-grade textbook . Those educated before World_War_II -- that is , most of my fellow passengers -- learned about the canal as &quot; the eighth wonder of the world. &quot; For those voyagers , a canal itinerary is a chance to lay eyes on something they ' ve been curious about for five decades . First , however , we laid eyes on Curacao , a Dutch island whose capital city , Willemstad , has built much of its economy around cruise_ship tourism . We strolled past a_few blocks of smartly painted Dutch architecture , an old synagogue , an outdoor market under brightly colored canopies and tourist shops where vendors attempted to peddle old license_plates for $ 5 each . We resisted , returned for another evening aboard ship , and gathered the next day to hear the ship ' s lecturer , Frank Buckingham , run_through some Panamanian-American history . Less than 20 years after the adventurer Balboa discovered Panama ' s unique geographic position in 1513 , the Spanish were already contemplating a canal . But it was the 19th-Century French builder of the Suez Canal , Ferdinand de Lesseps , who gained the necessary rights from Colombia ( which then controlled the land that is now Panama ) and started work in 1881 . De Lesseps ' Suez desert techniques failed miserably . He underestimated the difficulty of the digging , and didn ' t make the connection between mosquitoes and illness , which led to widespread malaria and yellow_fever and contributed heavily to an estimated 20 # 000 deaths among canal workers . De Lesseps resigned in disgrace , and for more_than a decade the construction site sat largely idle . Once the 1898 Spanish-American War highlighted the need for an Atlantic-Pacific Navy shortcut , however , U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt resolved that a Panama_canal would be a good card for him to hold . By 1903 , Roosevelt had secured a treaty with newly-independent Panama , giving the U.S. jurisdiction over a 10-mile-wide canal zone . The work began again . After a decade , another 5 # 609 deaths and more_than 232 million cubic_yards of digging , the canal opened_to international traffic in August , 1914 . Americans reveled in their accomplishment , but Americans were actually a small part of the work_force : Author David McCullough has estimated that as_many as 50 # 000 construction workers labored on the canal , most of them descendants of the slaves who were brought from West Africa to the West Indies over several centuries . Surrounded by unstable earth and tropical humidity , many of them worked 10 hours daily , six days a week , for 10 cents an hour . Eighty years later , remarkably little has changed in the canal ' s workings : Water rises and falls_in three locks , and ships -- mostly container vessels and cruise liners -- putter across a man-made lake , paying weight-based tolls that last year added_up to not quite $ 400 million . Almost all those ships bypass Panama ' s ports , which means that thousands of travelers have seen Panama but never set foot on its territory . The canal is such a popular attraction that some of those ships have no need to use it , but do so anyway . Since 1985 , Regency Cruises has been sending cruise_ships on seven-day , Aruba-Jamaica-Costa Rica-Colombia itineraries that advertise a canal transit in the middle of the voyage . The Regent Star steers into the Caribbean end of the canal , passes_through the first set of locks , makes a U-turn on sprawling , man-made Gatun Lake , and then leaves the way it came . This utterly purposeless seven-hour maneuver has made the seven-day route so attractive ( most canal cruises are 14 days ) that the Regent Star retraces that path weekly from October to April . What does a canal cruise passenger do with all those days at_sea ? I compiled a catalogue . Play ping pong . Lie_in sun . Sit in sun . Read romances . Scan the sea for dolphin fins . Drink_in shade . Drink_in sun . Moisten oneself with a mister . Play cards for fun . Play cards for money . Take dancing lessons . Listen to lectures on trans-Atlantic cruise history . Eat healthfully . Eat continuously . Sleep . Play bridge . Reminisce about previous cruises , other cruise lines , favorite routes . Talk_about who ' s been dancing with the captain . Read David McCullough ' s definitive history of the canal , &quot; The Path between the Seas : The Creation of the Panama_Canal , 1870-1914. &quot; The calm approaches surreal dimensions . One day up in the fitness center_on the top deck , with the Caribbean_Sea sprawling outside in all directions beyond the picture_windows , passenger Harrie Hess climbed into a fancy rowing machine in the middle of the otherwise idle room and settled into a rhythm . He was burning , the machine said , 502 calories per hour , but his labors seemed much greater and more mysterious : With each stroke , Hess ' s rowing machine emitted another fake water-splashing sound , splosh , splosh , splosh , and our 28 # 000-ton ship slid farther forward . On canal day , the fourth day into the cruise , we woke early and scrambled to the rails in darkness . Around us lay a landscape simultaneously grimy , industrial , deeply green and intensely humid . Clouds were low and thick , the port buildings were boxy and utilitarian , and the water was still enough that birds could be heard twittering in the trees ashore . Directly ahead lay the 110-foot-wide , 1 # 000-foot-long passage of Gatun Locks , with walls of concrete and slowly swinging gates of steel . &quot; Isn ' t this exciting ? &quot; said a woman on deck . &quot; Isn ' t it wonderful ? &quot; asked another . While we watched guide lines being tossed and engines being revved , rising waters pushed our ship skyward . A Panamanian canal pilot had boarded to confer_with the captain and take_over the ship , as canal rules require , and with him came a lecturer who immediately took_to the public-address system , beginning a daylong disquisition on the canal ' s history and operations . The sodium-vapor lighting that allows 24-hour operation of the locks . The 26 million gallons of water it takes_to lift a cruise_ship 27 feet in Gatun Locks . The stunt that daredevil journalist Richard Halliburton pulled_in the 1920s , swimming through the canal and incurring a 36-cent toll . ( Swimming is banned now. ) As the day progressed , we crossed broad Gatun Lake ( one of three artificial_lakes created in the canal zone by the harnessing of the Chagres River ; it now includes an island wildlife reserve ) , rose to 87 feet above sea_level , floated past the Continental Divide , then waited our turn_to pass_through the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks . Somewhere out of public view , cruise line officials paid the ship ' s canal toll -- about $ 80 # 000 . Our Panamanian pilot , Felipe Francis , quietly sipped orange_juice and paced the bridge , calmly delivering orders and small_talk in English and Spanish , depending_on the language of the nearest subordinate . He was in his early 30s and grew_up near the canal . He had now spent seven years steering ships through it and expected to spend another 30 years doing the same . In many ways , the canal ' s future depends_on the resolve of thousands of others like him . Especially since Panamanian riots over U.S. control of the canal in 1964 , the U.S. has been under pressure to yield its control of the canal . In 1977 , President Jimmy_Carter agreed to December 31 , 1999 , as the date for Panama to take_control , following a 20-year transitional period to be supervised by a binational Panama_Canal Commission . Since then , canal officials have endured the 1989 U.S. invasion and imprisonment of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega , watched the ominous deterioration of nearby non-canal equipment that is now overseen by the Panamanian government and seen the local economy shaken by the departure of dollar-bearing American troops and civilian workers . Then last May , Noriega ' s old party prevailed in the presidential elections . Canal Commission officials are quick to offer reassurances about the maintenance of the facility , the training of workers ( Panamanians now make_up about 88 % of the canal work_force ) and the likelihood that tolls will remain stable . But the bottom_line is that no one can be sure . Nevertheless , on May 12 , 1994 , the canal worked fine for us . George Baker of Rialto , Calif. , one of the passengers who came because of the itinerary , told me he had cruised on the Black_Sea , off the Baltics and on the Amazon . &quot; The canal , &quot; he said , &quot; impressed me about as much as any of them. &quot; Soon we were back to familiar patterns : a day at_sea , a day in port , another couple of days at_sea , and so on , as the ship called along the coasts of Costa Rica , Mexico and California . I went_back to my catalogue of things people do on a canal cruise : Down in the pool , five women paddled through an exercise class . At a railing nearby , a man watched , smoked cigarettes and sipped beer . Inside , a crowd convened for bingo , and half_a_dozen gamblers slouched and leaned in the casino . In the Penthouse Lounge , afternoon_tea was served . From stem to stern , we idled , and daydreamed of jungles steaming and Theodore Roosevelt scheming . GUIDEBOOK : Cream of the Locks Cruising the canal : Many cruise lines offer Panama_Canal cruises . Royal Cruise Line ' s Star Odyssey , the ship I cruised on , next passes_through the Panama_Canal in November . That itinerary begins Nov . 21 in Ft . Lauderdale , Fla. , and includes port calls_at Key West , Fla. ; Playa del Carmen and Cozumel , Mexico ; Grand Cayman ; Ocho Rios , Jamaica ; San Blas islands , Panama ; the canal , and Puerto Caldera , Costa Rica . It concludes Dec . 5 in Acapulco . Fares for the 14-day cruise are $ 3 # 015 to $ 8 # 127 , depending_on the level of accommodation , including air fare from Los Angeles .

Panama_Canal : Ocean to Ocean Stepping_up the Locks The 50.7-mile canal contains a series of locks that cuts_across Panama linking the Atlantic and Pacific_oceans . Traffic on the canal keeps it open 24 hours a day , all year round . Here is how the locks operate . * 1 . A ship sailing from the Atlantic_Ocean enters the canal at Limon Bay where a harbor pilot boards the vessel and takes_over the controls . The pilot then leads the ship to the Gatun Locks . 2 . Once the ship enters the locks , large steel gates close behind the ship . 3 . Water is then pumped into the lock , raising the water_level . Once the water in the lock reaches the level of the next lock , the gates in front of the ship are opened and the &quot; mules &quot; pull the ship into the second lock . On descending locks , water is released . 4 . This process is repeated until the ship reaches the Pacific_Ocean . * Gatun Locks The locks look_like giant steps leading ships into Panama ' s emerald interior . A series of three locks lifts the ship 85 feet from sea_level to Gatun Lake . * &quot; The Mules &quot; Ships are pulled_up and guided through the locks with the help of small locomotive tractors , or &quot; mules &quot; . The &quot; mules , &quot; which are connected to the ships with cables , run_on tracks on concrete islands along the canal . * The Gaillard Cut This manmade channel cuts_through eight miles of hills , spanning the Continental Divide . The channel is roughly 500 feet wide and , at its shallowest , 39 feet deep . * Cutting It Short The Panama_Canal cuts travel distance between New York and Los Angeles by more_than half .</TEXT>
