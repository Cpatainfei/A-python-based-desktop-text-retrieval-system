   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A : IRIS F . KUNG : FROM TIAN AN MEN TO PBS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since the bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing ' s Tian An Men Square in June , 1989 , only eight student leaders have succeeded in escaping_from China . Zhang Boli , who was_on China ' s &quot; most-wanted list &quot; for his involvement in the student movement , was one of those who evaded Chinese authorities and escaped to the West . Zhang ' s harrowing story caught the attention of a former Chinese television_reporter -- now residing in the United States -- who returned to China under great personal risk to chronicle his escape route . Iris F . Kung ( a pseudonym used by the reporter ) secretly retraced Zhang ' s amazing journey and smuggled the original footage out of the country . Tuesday night ' s broadcast premiere of &quot; Escape From China &quot; on PBS ' &quot; P.O.V. &quot; series marks the fifth anniversary of the Tian An Men Square massacre in which hundreds -- a definite body_count was never confirmed -- of protesters died . Writer Christine Courtney caught_up_with Kung in Hong Kong . What led you to make this film ? I met Zhang Boli in February , 1992 , at a Chinese New Year party in ( the East Coast ) , where he now lives . Zhang told me he was one of 21 students on China ' s &quot; most-wanted list , &quot; and that he avoided arrest by hiding in a remote village on the China-Russia border for two years . He later learned that his wife had left him ( to remarry ) and that his daughter had been left in the care of a relative . I immediately connected with his emotional and physical struggle and wanted to document his story to tell people ( what is happening in China ) through example . What does this film mean to you ? The meaning of this film is not only about Zhang ' s escape_from China but also about the changes that are going_on in my homeland . The fact that Zhang was able to escape and that I was able to document his journey shows that more independent films like this can be done . What difficulties did you encounter in shooting this film in China ? I had to hire a new cameraman soon after we began filming , but I wasn ' t able to tell him the true nature of the project . We traveled_by train and bus for 50 hours to get_to a village in Northeast China , where Zhang hid for two years . I began to feel more comfortable with him and eventually told him the truth . He said he would continue working with me because it was the first time in his film career that he was allowed to be creative . How did you avoid appearing suspicious while documenting Zhang ' s story ? We were stopped several times by provincial government officials , but we explained that we were doing a film on the environment . We also got help from a young_man and his parents who protected Zhang during his two years of hiding in the countryside . The young_man told everyone we were his relatives from the city . He called me ' aunt ' and he called the cameraman ' uncle. ' What precautions did you take_to protect your sources ? We had no problem interviewing Zhang ' s family , but we did take precautions when interviewing Zhang ' s ex-wife . To avoid suspicion , I interviewed her in a park while my cameraman filmed from behind some bushes nearby . We also made arrangements for the farming family who protected Zhang to move after we had completed the filming . We told them never to return to that place . We hid their identity in the film . Were you or your sources ever in danger ? During post-production of the film , a woman who was working with me panicked when I showed her a rough cut of the film . She was going_to either turn me into the police or destroy all_of my tapes . But some friends talked her out of it . You can ' t imagine how nervous I was and how guilty I felt about getting anyone in_trouble . How did you get the film out of the country without compromising your sources ? I eventually used my connections ( with some Chinese officials ) to get the tapes safely onto a plane . What differences do you see in China now compared to the past ? I think there is a big change in people ' s perspective . In society , all_the Chinese government ' s regulations and restrictions exist . But in the minds of the people , all these regulations and restrictions have virtually disappeared . Of course , this change has come_along because of China ' s economic reform . But I still think China has a long way to go . How do you feel about your film airing nationwide across the U.S. ? Out of 600 films , I was one of 10 films chosen . As a Chinese filmmaker , this is really encouraging . We had a very hard_time getting_into American television . I think one of the reasons for this is that the situation in China has changed and people have forgotten about the 1989 democracy movement in Tian An Men Square . But they should take the point_of_view that this film is a human story about the emotional , cultural and political struggle of the Chinese people . &quot; Escape From China &quot; airs Tuesday at 10 p.m. on KCET and 10:30 p.m. on KPBS .</TEXT>
