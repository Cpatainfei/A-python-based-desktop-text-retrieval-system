   <HEADLINE> WHITE_HOUSE AFRICA CONFERENCE UPSETS BLACK LEADERS ; FOREIGN_POLICY : EFFORT IS CRITICIZED FOR POOR PLANNING AND INEPT POLITICAL ETIQUETTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A White_House conference on Africa that was supposed to showcase the Clinton_Administration ' s concern for the continent ' s social , political and economic problems has instead alienated the entire Congressional Black Caucus and the most prominent pro-Africa group in the United States . The two-day session , which starts Sunday but was formally announced only Wednesday , has been marred by poor planning , botched diplomacy and inept politics , according to invitees who are boycotting the event . Randall Robinson , the outspoken director of TransAfrica , turned_down an invitation to lead a discussion group at the conference because of President Clinton ' s &quot; egregiously bad faith &quot; in dealing with black Haitian refugees . &quot; For as he treats blacks from one place , so must he necessarily feel about blacks from another , &quot; Robinson wrote in a letter to the conference organizer , Donald Steinberg , the senior National Security_Council officer for Africa . The 40-member Congressional Black Caucus will not participate in the conference because of disputes over the Administration ' s Africa policies and because many members felt slighted because they did not receive formal invitations . &quot; This is the strangest White_House conference I ' ve ever seen . There was no formal consultation with the caucus , &quot; said Rep . Donald M . Payne ( D-N.J. ) , who chairs the caucus ' s foreign_policy task_force . &quot; It ' s kind of noble that they ' ve decided to think_about a conference on Africa , but the manner in which it ' s been planned and executed leaves me concerned about how much of a commitment there really is for Africa. &quot; One aide to a black congressman dismissed the conference as &quot; a public relations event , that ' s what it is . We don ' t expect anyone from the caucus to be there. &quot; The flap has exacerbated already testy relations between Clinton and the African American community . While black lawmakers said their boycott of the conference is based on objections to the Administration ' s Africa policy and breaches of political etiquette , the tension between blacks and the White_House has roots in other disputes with Clinton over personnel , welfare reform and anti-crime measures . White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers apologized for the changing guest list and agenda . She blamed the confusion on fast-moving events in Africa . &quot; We regret any problems that have been caused by the late invitations or the changing invitations , &quot; she said . &quot; I think the agenda for the conference has developed quickly as issues facing Africa have changed -- shifted somewhat over the course of the last few weeks . Certainly . . . this will include a broad variety of people . I think that the list of attendees grew as word of the conference spread and people wanted to participate. &quot; The Administration ' s Africa policy took another punch on Thursday in a Human_Rights Watch report , which said Clinton ' s &quot; shameful response to Rwanda suggests that human_rights in Africa do not become a priority even when abuses amount to genocide. &quot; A senior Administration official said about 150 prominent Africa specialists would attend the conference , including academics , religious_leaders , business_executives , labor organizers and human_rights officials .</TEXT>
