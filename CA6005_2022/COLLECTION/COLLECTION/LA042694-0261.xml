   <HEADLINE> S . AFRICA BLASTS KILL 12 ON ELECTION EVE ; VIOLENCE : A 220-POUND BOMB RIPS A TAXI STAND IN NATION ' S DEADLIEST WAVE OF RIGHT-WING TERRORISM . TROOPS ARE MOBILIZED TO ENSURE SAFETY AT POLLING PLACES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 220-pound bomb ripped through a crowded taxi stand used by blacks in this conservative city Monday , killing 10 . Two more people died later in a restaurant blast in Pretoria as the deadliest wave of right-wing terrorism in the nation ' s history hit South_Africa on the eve of all-race elections . The attacks , the most recent of more_than a dozen that have killed 21 and injured almost 200 in the past two days , appeared to be part of a campaign by white extremists to discourage South_Africans from voting in the three-day elections that will bring blacks into government for the first time . Political leaders , seeking to reassure worried South_Africans , announced Monday the biggest peacetime military call-up in the country ' s history to ensure that the 9 # 000 polling_stations will be safe . Besides army troops , 100 # 000 police_officers , twice the number that was originally planned , will be_on guard at polling_booths beginning today . &quot; A group of desperate people , small handfuls of radicals , have declared war on the rest of this society , &quot; President Frederik W . de Klerk said . &quot; We will not rest until they have been tracked_down , convicted and punished , as they deserve . &quot; Our contingency plans for the elections are in place , &quot; he said . &quot; While incidents such_as these obviously constitute a risk , I want to assure the public that we will do our best to assure they can vote safely. &quot; It was difficult to tell how many of the expected 20 million voters might be deterred from casting ballots by the resurgence of terrorist attacks , especially if more innocent people are killed in the next few days . But many South_Africans said the attacks , part of the biggest bombing campaign since the then-banned African National Congress was waging guerrilla war on the white-minority government in the 1980s , have made them more determined to make the elections a success . Johann Kriegler , head of the Independent Electoral Commission , promised Monday that the elections will go_ahead , &quot; bombs or no bombs. &quot; The voting begins today with elderly and disabled South_Africans casting ballots at 500 special polling_stations . The entire country goes_to the polls Wednesday and Thursday . Although Kriegler said Monday ' s killings were tragic , he added , &quot; We have come light_years in four years , and we will not be deterred by minor incidents. &quot; A white suspect was arrested and questioned Monday in the bombings in Germiston and in Johannesburg a day earlier , police said . They declined to specify the suspect ' s political affiliation , but Gen . Johan van der Merwe , commissioner of police , promised that &quot; a breakthrough is imminent. &quot; Police offered a $ 300 # 000 reward , the largest in this country ' s history , for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the Germiston bomber . Authorities said the Johannesburg car_bomb , which killed nine and injured more_than 100 , and the larger Germiston bomb were probably prepared by the same person , someone with considerable experience with explosives . Right-wing leaders insisted Monday that their organizations were not responsible_for the bombings . But a caller to an Afrikaans-language newspaper late Monday claimed that his right-wing group was responsible_for the Germiston blast and warned that it &quot; would be a picnic compared with what is to come. &quot; Political analysts said all_the attacks carried the signature of militant rightists , who have vowed to boycott the elections and demand an autonomous homeland for the Afrikaner descendants of the first white settlers . &quot; What is clear is that there is a new element in right-wing terrorism , &quot; said Wim Booyse , a political consultant in Pretoria and an expert on the white right . &quot; And these blasts have risen to a_level that the country has never seen before. &quot; Booyse said the attacks were probably part of a last-ditch campaign by one or more of the shadowy , highly trained groups on the right , which have been silent for weeks . Since Sunday , a dozen bombs have exploded at polling_stations , government_offices and other sites , although there have been no serious injuries in those incidents . ANC President Nelson Mandela visited victims of the Johannesburg blast Monday . Speaking_to reporters later , he said he is convinced that the nation ' s police commanders want to end the violence . &quot; I hope the government acts in a way to remove the impression that it is a government of weakness , unable to rise to the challenge that is posed by madmen who are killing innocent people , &quot; he added . In Pretoria , the explosive_device was tossed into a crowded restaurant catering mostly to blacks shortly after 8 p.m. Monday , killing two and seriously injuring at least six , police said . Witnesses said the bomb was thrown from a passing car carrying two young white_men . The bomb in Germiston , a white industrial city about 10 miles southeast of Johannesburg , was planted in a trailer_parked amid taxi vans near downtown . It exploded at 8:45 a.m. , shattering windows in a four-block-square area , tossing parts of cars and bodies onto roofs of nearby buildings and destroying 10 minibus taxis . A grocery_store building also was destroyed . &quot; This bomb was to scare_away the voters , &quot; said Izzy Naigi , a spokesman for the Congress of South_African Trade_Unions , an ANC-aligned labor association with local offices near the scene . &quot; We were expecting something like this , and we expect more to come. &quot; The explosion occurred on a city street where black taxi drivers collect passengers and fix their vehicles ; the dead included drivers , passengers and clerks in the store . Whites in the area had complained in recent months that the illegal taxi stand had increased the crime_rate in the area . The blast heavily damaged the adjacent , two-story Good Hope Center , an apartment_building run_by a charity for poor and elderly whites . Many of the 80 people there were injured . &quot; I ' d never heard anything that loud in my life , &quot; said Piet Bothes , 50 , who runs the center . &quot; It ' s hard to believe that human_beings can do things like this . All I can say is they weren ' t Christians , because Christians couldn ' t do anything like that. &quot; Meanwhile , in Cape_Town , the white-dominated Parliament met for the last time Monday to amend the constitution to recognize the Zulu monarchy and allow Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi ' s Inkatha Freedom Party to participate in the voting . Buthelezi called_off his election boycott last week . His decision has eased tensions in Natal province , where supporters of Buthelezi and Mandela have been battling for a decade , leaving thousands dead .</TEXT>
