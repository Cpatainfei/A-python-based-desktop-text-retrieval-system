   <HEADLINE> CLASS NOTES : A PRIMER ON CORRESPONDENCE PROGRAMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I get a lot of phone_calls and letters from readers curious about correspondence_courses . Most want to know if such courses are &quot; real , &quot; and how to tell the legitimate ones from the scams . Although there are some bad apples in the bunch , many schools offering correspondence programs are worthwhile and credible . Indeed , the last couple of decades have brought a sharp increase in the number of such schools . Many educational goals can be accomplished through the mail . You can , for example , take courses on nearly any subject found on a regular campus . You can also earn various professional certifications and all types of college degrees -- from the two-year associate ' s degree to a doctorate or law_degree . In fact , home study takes many forms . The most common is correspondence -- the student receives study materials , assignments and tests in the mail from a particular college or school , then sends_back the completed work to be graded . Thanks to recent technology , however , many home study programs now use more interesting methods . Teaching courses via cable TV hookup or by videotape has become popular . So has using computer software and communicating with the school from home with a computer modem . Home study programs generally entail admission requirements that are less harsh and complicated than those of traditional schools ; many don ' t even require the Scholastic Aptitude Test ( SAT ) or other entrance exams . The master ' s program offered by California State University at Dominguez Hills in Carson is fairly typical of credible correspondence education programs . The Cal State program offers a master ' s in five subjects , and all work is done through home study ( projects , papers , and a thesis or creative project ) . Instructors guide students by telephone , mail and cassette , and grading is based largely on written assignments . Cal State requires at least 30 hours for the master ' s ; a full-time student can complete it in a year or so . And , since Cal State is a public university , the course_of_study is about as inexpensive as they come ( about $ 1 # 500 for the whole program ) . Also important : Cal State schools are well-respected and accredited , and Dominguez Hills ' correspondence program has been in_operation for decades . If you ' re interested in a correspondence_course or degree , bear_in_mind that not all programs are like Cal State ' s . Be sure to ask questions before enrolling to find the program that ' s right for you . First , ask the school ' s representative how long the school has existed . Of course , it ' s possible that a new school may be excellent , but a fairly decent history is usually preferable . Find_out about the instructors ' backgrounds too . Do they have degrees , specialized training or job experience in the subjects they ' ll be teaching ? Make_sure you find_out all_the required courses and costs , to avoid surprises down the road . Get that in writing too ; any school that won ' t provide a written course_of_study and payment plan should be pulled from your pool right away . For a list of school accreditation agencies , write to the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation , 1 Dupont Circle North , Suite 760 , Washington , D.C. 20036 , or the Department_of_Education , Division of Eligibility and Agency Evaluation , Washington , D.C. 20202 . Another reliable accreditation agency for vocational_schools and degree-by-mail schools nationwide is the National Home Study Council , at 1601 18th Street Northwest , Washington , D.C. 20009 .</TEXT>
