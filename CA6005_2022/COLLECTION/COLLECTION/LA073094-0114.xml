   <HEADLINE> HUBER CASE EVIDENCE ON WAY TO O.C. ; COURTS : IN SEPARATE HEARINGS , FAMALARO HEARS FIRST-DEGREE MURDER_CHARGES AND JUDGE ORDERS TRANSFER OF TRUCKLOAD OF MATERIAL FROM ARIZONA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A judge on Friday informed John J . Famalaro that he faces charges of first-degree murder and kidnaping in Orange County in connection with the death of Denise Huber and set an extradition hearing in 30 days . In a separate hearing , another judge approved the transfer of all evidence in the case to Costa Mesa , directed Famalaro to provide blood , saliva , hair and handwriting samples to prosecutors and ordered all local law_enforcement personnel to preserve their notes from the investigation for possible use by the defense . Costa Mesa police_detectives Linda Giesler and Frank Rudisill , who have spent nearly two weeks in Prescott working_on the case , are scheduled to drive a moving van filled with evidence , including the 23-cubic-foot freezer in which Famalaro allegedly stored Huber ' s battered body for three years , back to Orange County today . Police Lt . Ron Smith and the two detectives spent more_than two hours Friday evening loading carefully labeled boxes , filing_cabinets and lumber from a dismantled cabinet in Famalaro house into the 17-foot truck outside the Yavapai County Sheriff ' s Department . &quot; It ' s almost filled to the roof , &quot; Smith said as he carried_out a box . Huber ' s body is scheduled to be flown today from Phoenix , where an autopsy was conducted , to South_Dakota , where her family is planning a funeral Tuesday . Huber , a 23-year-old waitress from Newport Beach , disappeared after a rock_concert June 3 , 1991 . Police discovered her bludgeoned body wrapped in trash bags in the freezer in a stolen Ryder truck outside Famalaro ' s Prescott Country_Club home earlier this month . Famalaro was arrested on murder_charges , but on Thursday , authorities filed papers to move the case to Orange County , where they believe Huber was kidnaped and killed . Looking gaunt in a bright orange jail uniform , Famalaro , 37 , stood during the five-minute hearing Friday afternoon in Yavapai County_Courthouse with his hands shackled to a chain around his waist , clutching a Manila envelope his attorneys said contained legal paperwork . When Prescott Justice_of_the_Peace Robert W . Kuebler Jr . asked whether he understood the California charges and the Arizona fugitive warrant , Famalaro responded , &quot; Yes , your honor. &quot; Kuebler then read him his Miranda rights and asked again if he understood . &quot; Yes , your honor , &quot; Famalaro repeated . Kuebler then set a hearing for extradition to California for Aug . 29 . Thomas Kelly , Famalaro ' s Arizona defense_attorney , and Leonard Gumlia , the deputy public_defender assigned to handle the case in Orange County , both said later that they are unsure whether Famalaro will attempt to block his extradition to California . They said a decision on that is likely within two weeks . Yavapai County Deputy Counsel Thomas Lindberg said that prosecutors in California had already set_in_motion the process of getting a governor ' s warrant to force Famalaro ' s transfer , should he protest . Gumlia and two assistants from the Orange County public_defender ' s office spent Friday in Prescott , talking with Famalaro and his mother , visiting the site where the body was discovered , meeting with Kelly and co-defense counsel Warren Darrow , and sorting through newspaper_clippings about the case . &quot; It looks very challenging , very intriguing , and it may involve a man who ' s innocent , &quot; Gumlia said , cautioning that he had not had a chance to review any of the evidence . In the second hearing connected to the case Friday afternoon , Yavapai County Superior_Court Judge Raymond W . Weaver Jr . rejected Kelly ' s effort to keep Famalaro from providing the samples to prosecutors . Kelly pointed to a provision in the Arizona Constitution that protects suspects from giving evidence that might incriminate them . But Lindberg countered with case_law in which the &quot; evidence &quot; referred to has always been interpreted to mean testimony . Lindberg said the hair , blood , saliva and handwriting samples would be taken from Famalaro at the jail Monday .</TEXT>
