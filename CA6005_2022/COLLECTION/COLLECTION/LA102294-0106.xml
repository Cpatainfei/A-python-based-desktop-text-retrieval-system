   <HEADLINE> PUBLIC HEALTH_CARE IN JEOPARDY , REPORT SAYS ; MEDICINE : UCLA STUDY ' S BLEAK FINDINGS ABOUT L.A. COUNTY SYSTEM OVERSHADOW FIRST SUMMIT_MEETING OF NORMALLY CONTENTIOUS FACTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sobered by a new UCLA study declaring that taxpayer-financed health programs in Los Angeles County are &quot; in danger of collapse , &quot; an unusual collection of normally contentious factions in the health community held their first summit_meeting Friday . The study , prepared by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and released at the start of the meeting , represents the most comprehensive profile yet of the county ' s massive health_care_delivery system . The UCLA researchers examined data , some of which has been published before and some of which is new , from documents , public records and vital statistics for the county and previous studies . Its bleak findings : * Between 1988 and 1992 , the county ' s non-elderly population increased by 7 % , but the number of uninsured people increased by 32 % ; those on Medi-Cal , a subsidized health program for the poor , grew by 46 % . These disparities reflected high unemployment and bad economic_conditions . * Only about 60 % of the county ' s 2-year-olds are adequately immunized , well below the 90 % goal set by county health officials . The numbers are even worse for African American children , 25 % of whom were fully immunized , and Latino children , 45 % of whom received the full slate of recommended vaccines . * More_than one-quarter , or 28 % , of the non-elderly population in Los Angeles County reported having no regular doctor , a key indicator of poor access to health_care services . * About 15 % of the 22 # 000 inmates in county-operated jails at any given time are considered to be mentally_ill , with 8 % considered severely mentally_ill . * The health system is about $ 425 million short of meeting its public health_care needs , a shortfall that could lead to the closing of hospitals or health centers . * The county ' s diversity offers numerous health challenges . The study said breast_cancer was the leading cause of death among women in the county ; complications from AIDS is the leading cause of death among men between 25 and 44 ; African Americans suffered higher than average rates of infant_mortality and deaths from heart_disease , cancer , stroke and homicides . Almost as eye-catching as the report ' s findings was the makeup of the coalition of health_care policy-makers who gathered_in a conference hall at USC : county , state and federal elected officials , hospital administrators , county health providers , Skid_Row health workers and academic researchers . The gathering was described by most of those present as &quot; a first_step &quot; that could ultimately lead to a statewide ballot proposition or at least a more formal response to some of the changes being proposed by others in the health_care system . The more_than two_dozen members of the coalition represent , for the most part , a solid wall of opposition to two propositions on the Nov . 8 ballot . One , Proposition 186 , would radically reform the health_care system by implementing a single-payer health_care arrangement that calls_for the state to replace private health_insurance companies . The other , Proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigrant measure , would cut_off all non-emergency health_care to undocumented residents . On another front , most of the coalition members said they are feeling pinched by the state ' s efforts to move welfare recipients into managed care programs , which threatens to turn county health programs topsy-turvy by changing traditional methods of health_care financing . * &quot; Two years ago this meeting would n ' t have been possible , &quot; said David Langness , a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California , which sponsored the event . &quot; What this summit does is start the process toward a plan that everybody in the health_care field can agree upon . We have had so_much infighting in the past that we could never have been able to agree on which direction we should go. &quot; Sparks flew at times during the daylong meeting , but the somewhat shaky coalition seemed to hold . Money , usually the source of most problems in health_care turf wars , once again was at the root of friction at the conference . Complaining that California is being shortchanged in federal Medicaid payments , Robert Gates , director of the county Department of Health Services , distributed charts showing that New Hampshire is receiving $ 7 # 767 per Medicaid recipient , New York $ 3 # 699 , while California is dead last at $ 1 # 301 per recipient . Gates blamed the state for not being aggressive enough in pursuing federal Medicaid dollars . Other local health officials criticized California members of Congress for not keeping_up with other states . Rep . Xavier Becerra ( D-Los Angeles ) , in turn , said he would like to see some creative local proposals that would raise funds to correct some of the problems . &quot; You can ' t just go_to Congress and the Legislature and say , ' These are the facts . Give us the money , ' &quot; Becerra said . &quot; We want to know how are we going_to come_up with the money ? How are we going_to cut_down on the bureaucracy ? &quot; But Becerra said he thought the meeting was worthwhile . &quot; It ' s always productive when you get the different players in the same room , &quot; he said . &quot; We all agree on one thing : We must come_up with a way to solve the looming crisis for health_care in Los Angeles County. &quot;</TEXT>
