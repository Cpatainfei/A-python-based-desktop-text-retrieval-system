   <HEADLINE> AT THE MARKET : BRUSSELS_SPROUTS ARE GAINING IN STATURE AS FOOD FOR GOOD_HEALTH ; THE MINIATURE CABBAGE-LIKE VEGGIES ARE BEING TOUTED BY WEIGHT-LOSS GURUS AND AS A DIETARY AID TO PREVENTING CANCER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Many of us can remember those frightening evenings when mom served_up ( &quot; Oh , no , not again ! &quot; ) a steamy side_dish of smelly , pale , ruefully overcooked Brussels_sprouts . But don ' t let childhood torment keep you from enjoying the tasty and healthful rewards of properly prepared sprouts today . Brussels_sprouts are most readily available during the fall and winter months . Although the plant is propagated nearly year-round along California ' s coastal agriculture belts , production falls_off during the wilting heat of summertime . Currently , supermarkets such_as Hughes , Ralphs and Vons are selling Brussels_sprouts for about 70 cents a pound . While the price may be right , don ' t expect to sort through a mountain of sprouts , as all markets devote minimal shelf space to this golf ball-size vegetable . &quot; You just don ' t see them in great quantity because they are like a specialty item , &quot; said Don Ames of the Produce Reporter Co. , an industry marketing group . &quot; Not everyone eats them like they do lettuces and other staples. &quot; But maybe they should . Besides being a tasty dish when cooked properly , sprouts have also become a veggie of choice -- a poster veggie , if you will -- for many health agencies . Sprouts , like the other members of the cruciferous family -- cabbage , cauliflower , broccoli and others -- are high in fiber and low in fat and the American Heart Assn . recommends they be eaten regularly , said Camarillo nutritionist Georgia Carlson . &quot; They help in pulling cholesterol out of the system , &quot; she said . &quot; Brussels_sprouts are also high in sulfur , which takes fats out of the body &quot; -- and that ' s especially beneficial if you ' re on a weight-loss program , Carlson said . The veggies of the cruciferous family may also aid in the prevention of certain cancers , according to the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute . The individual buds &quot; sprout &quot; from a sturdy , fibrous stalk , which reaches 30 inches or more in_height . The erect stalk is crowned by an umbrella of large leaves and is completely shrouded by the miniature cabbage head-like sprouts . A single plant is expected to yield from 50 to 100 sprouts . Undoubtedly , most shoppers only see the sprouts after the buds have been picked from the stem . But shoppers at area farmers ' markets can purchase the entire plant with the sprouts still intact . Members of Nichols Farms of Pismo Beach , who attend the Ventura ( Saturday ) and Thousand Oaks ( Thursday ) markets , offer their Brussels_sprouts by the plant . Each plant costs $ 1.50. A pound of their pre-plucked sprouts goes_for $ 1 . Sprouts left on the plant until they are ready to be used will retain freshness longer , said RichardSager of Nichols Farms . Nichols ' sprouts season will continue through February and possibly into March , he said . Brussels_sprouts should be available at area farmers ' markets well into the springtime , though , thanks to Michael Melendez and family , who farm near Santa Maria . The Melendezes travel_to Ventura ' s Wednesday and Saturday markets , plus the Thousand Oaks and Oxnard markets on Thursdays . The family has raised Brussels_sprouts for three years and has since determined that the vegetable is most popular_with a particular age_group , Michael Melendez said . &quot; Brussels_sprouts are kind of like spinach -- it ' s one of those things that you disliked when you are young and started eating later in life , &quot; he said . &quot; The people that seem to buy_it most are over 30 years old. &quot; Melendez said their sprout sales continue to climb -- a fact that he attributes to the growing awareness of the plant ' s nutritional benefits . Preparing Brussels_sprouts is simple enough . Boiling or steaming for a_few careful minutes will result in a mild cabbage taste with hints of nutty flavor . When cooking Brussels_sprouts , the credo to live_by is : Do not overcook . If you do , your nose will know . Overdone sprouts are an odoriferous nightmare , attributable to their high sulfur content , Carlson said . &quot; They can stink really , really bad , &quot; Melendez said . And they ' re not very pleasing to the palate , either . &quot; Soggy and smelly is what you ' ll get. &quot; Before cooking a batch of sprouts , slice off a thin portion of the stem and remove just the outer layer of leaves , then rinse the vegetable under cool water . Boil : To retain the sprout ' s bright greenish color and fresh taste , drop into salted boiling water -- enough so they are completely covered . Return to boil and cook until just reaching tenderness . It should take about 8 minutes . You can check for doneness by piercing the base with a sharp knife . Steam : Again , slice off a bit of the stem and remove outer leaves . Before steaming , Melendez suggested cutting an &quot; X &quot; about an eighth of an inch deep in the base of the stem . &quot; This allows the steam to penetrate to the center , &quot; he said . Cook for a_few minutes and begin to check for desired tenderness . When purchasing Brussels_sprouts , look_for those with a fresh , vivid green hue . They should be firm to the touch and unwrinkled . The smaller sprouts are normally more tender and better tasting . Fresh sprouts may be kept_in the crisper for up_to five days , Melendez said , although for best flavor you should eat your sprouts within two days . Details For a simple and delicious side_dish , boiled or steamed Brussels_sprouts can be served with melted butter and a sprinkling of grated hard cheese , such_as Romano or Parmesan . The vegetable is also versatile enough to be served with a favorite sauce or in a stir-fry preparation . Below is a recipe that features Brussels_sprouts ' traditional partner , chestnuts . Brussels_Sprouts with Water_Chestnuts and Ginger 2 teaspoons oil 1 medium clove garlic , minced 1 1 / 2 teaspoons minced ginger root 1 / 4 cup chicken_stock or broth 3 / 4 cup whole canned water chest nuts , rinsed and drained 1 pound Brussels_sprouts , cooked 1 tablespoon mirin ( Japanese sweet rice wine ) 1 tablespoon soy_sauce Heat oil in medium skillet . Add garlic and ginger root , and saute 10 seconds over medium-high heat . Add stock and water_chestnuts , and bring_to boil . Add cooked Brussels_sprouts and heat 2 minutes over medium heat , shaking pan or stirring gently . Add mirin and soy_sauce , and heat over medium-high heat 2 or 3 minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated . Makes 4 servings .</TEXT>
