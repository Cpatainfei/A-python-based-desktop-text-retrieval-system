   <HEADLINE> BIAS AGAINST U.S. MUSLIMS CITED IN REPORT TO CIVIL RIGHTS PANEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Muslims in the United States face widespread discrimination in the workplace and in society at_large , a top Islamic scholar has told the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights . Azizah Al-Hibri , a professor of law at the University of Richmond in Virginia , told the rights panel at a Jan . 14 hearing that Muslims in the United States &quot; have not had their own voice &quot; and are defined for the general population by non-Muslims . Al-Hibri , a founder of the Muslim American Bar Assn . who has handled numerous anti-bias cases , said bigotry against Muslims -- especially women -- is widespread in the corporate world , in academia and in the military . Citing poll results , Al-Hibri said Islam &quot; is the most negatively viewed religion in America &quot; and that American Muslims have &quot; suffered a great_deal in terms of respect. &quot; She said Muslim women who follow the tradition of covering their heads in public often encounter discrimination . &quot; Either you ' re not hired , &quot; she said , &quot; or , if you are , you ' re put_in the back_room &quot; out of public sight and denied promotions and advancements . Al-Hibri made her comments as part of a panel briefing the eight-member civil_rights commission called to examine current issues on religious civil_rights . Federal anti-bias laws prohibit discrimination in employment , schooling and a wide variety of other federally funded programs . Also testifying were the Rev . Barry Lynn , executive_director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State ; Meyer Eisenberg , chairman of the national civil_rights committee of the Anti-Defamation League ; William Scott Green , a professor of Judaic studies at the University of Rochester , and the Rev . Richard John Neuhaus , president of the Institute on Religion and Public Life in New York . Lynn told the commission that , despite the claims of some ultraconservatives , the Christian_religion &quot; is alive and well in America &quot; and that , although there are incidents involving bias , &quot; there is no campaign of religious bigotry &quot; against Christians . Those who complain of intolerance or bigotry by the government against Christianity , he said , &quot; are complaining about the failure of the government to help them promote their causes. &quot; At the same time , Lynn said , there was bias against minority religions such_as Islam and Hinduism and some sectarian minorities within Christianity , such_as the Amish . Eisenberg warned that religion-based hate crimes appear to be_on the rise and that &quot; early indications &quot; from the ADL ' s annual audit of hate crimes against Jews and Jewish institutions &quot; show that the numbers are up and a disturbing trend continues. &quot;</TEXT>
