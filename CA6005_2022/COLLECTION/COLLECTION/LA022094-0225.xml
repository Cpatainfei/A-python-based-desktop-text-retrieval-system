   <HEADLINE> MANAGED CARE INDUSTRY CAUGHT BETWEEN HIGH COSTS , PATIENT WELFARE ; INSURANCE : A $ 90-MILLION JUDGMENT AGAINST AN HMO HIGHLIGHTS THE CONFLICT . BUT SOME EXPERTS CONTEND THAT LIMITS ON COVERAGE HELP PREVENT WIDESPREAD USE OF POTENTIALLY HARMFUL TREATMENTS BEFORE THEY ARE PROVEN EFFECTIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just after Christmas , a California jury awarded nearly $ 90 million to the family of a woman who died after her health_maintenance_organization refused to pay_for a costly , experimental breast_cancer treatment . The size of the award , which stunned the health_care industry , underscored more_than just the age-old battle between patients and insurers . For millions of Americans , particularly those obliged to join HMOs at their employers ' request , the case cut_to their worst fears about the new era of managed care . It offered a stinging example of what managed-care critics call the HMO obsession with cost , even if that means withholding medical treatment . The attorney for Nelene Fox charged in the nearly monthlong trial that Health Net ' s contract covered bone-marrow transplants and that the HMO financially rewarded executives for denying coverage of costly procedures . The company argued it only pays_for the transplants under certain , proven conditions , not those that are experimental or have only the slightest chance for success . Transplanting bone_marrow is a routine procedure for patients with such diseases as leukemia . But it is considered of unknown benefit for patients like Fox , who had advanced metastatic breast_cancer , and typically it is not covered by insurers . Mark Hieper , Fox ' s attorney and also her brother , called the victory an &quot; indictment on managed care. &quot; If the award is upheld , &quot; it flies in the face of managed care and would have a very negative effect &quot; on the industry , said Thomas Hodapp , a senior health_care analyst with Roberts Stephens &amp; Co. , a San Francisco investment_firm . &quot; There ' s a big concern for the precedent it sets , &quot; he said of the case , believed to be the first of its kind tried before a jury . &quot; There will be a lot more ( lawsuits ) coming_down the pike &quot; if the award stands . But the case is not that simple . Many experts believe that Health Net , the second-largest HMO in California , acted properly and that it is virtually certain the award will be reduced , perhaps to just a_few million dollars . Some even argue that limits on insurance coverage help prevent widespread use of potentially harmful treatments before they are proven effective . There are plenty of examples of patients who suffered from experimental therapies later found worthless or even damaging . A few decades ago , for example , doctors tried freezing the stomachs of ulcer patients . &quot; It was not only useless , it was harmful , &quot; said Dr. Alan Hillman , director of the Center for Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania . &quot; It ' s too_bad that the American public is pushing the profession to use everything before it is fully tested , &quot; he said . But for the Fox family , anything that offered even a shred of hope was worth pursuing , and at any price . &quot; If there ' s an outside chance of a cure , you want to do_it , &quot; said Fox ' s husband , James , after the award . With help from friends , 40-year-old Nelene Fox raised $ 212 # 000 so she could pay_for the treatment . She died eight months later . Some experts say Health Net erred in basing its defense on the experimental nature of the bone-marrow transplant . Instead , they say , the HMO probably should have argued that given the advanced stage of her cancer , the treatment was simply inappropriate . This puts HMOs in the middle of an uncomfortable debate over defining the limits of acceptable -- i.e. , reimbursable -- treatments . &quot; In the real_world , there are a lot of independent_variables for making coverage decisions , and sometimes they ' re not always based on medical outcomes , &quot; said Dr. William Osheroff , medical director at PacifiCare Health Systems , a California-based HMO that operates in six states . &quot; Companies will make exceptions to plans for business reasons , and I don ' t think there ' s anything wrong with that. &quot; HMO officials would n ' t talk specifically about the non-medical issues they consider when making coverage decisions in sensitive cases . But some said that if denial might result in a lawsuit , HMOs might weigh a host of more subtle issues . For example , women and children generally elicit more sympathy from a jury -- and media attention -- than middle-aged men . So does a high-profile disease like breast_cancer , against , say , colon_cancer . A procedure also is more likely to be covered if the patient participates in a clinical trial , so that the outcome would contribute to the body of medical knowledge . Finally , there is the notion that the squeaky wheel gets the grease . &quot; Nobody can write the perfect contract , &quot; said Glenn Smith , a managing consultant at the benefits consulting_firm Foster Higgins in San Francisco . &quot; There are gray areas that are likely to be subject_to interpretation and , ultimately , arbitration. &quot; As health plans increasingly are called_on to compete on price , &quot; they ' re more and more going_to be looking_at the clinical requirements of care and whether that care is ' cost-effective , ' a term the American public has a lot of trouble with , &quot; he said . For the most part , &quot; these decisions are going_to be pocketbook issues. &quot; They also will affect growing numbers of people . Enrollment in HMOs has quadrupled over the last decade . By the end of the year , the figure could top 50 million and is certain to accelerate under the national push toward managed care . In their favor , HMOs argue that they provide greater access and rarely exclude people with pre-existing conditions , unlike 72 % of traditional health_insurance plans , a study by KPMG Peat Marwick consulting firm shows . HMOs offer more preventive care than traditional insurance , and their premiums are lower . For the 85 % of things that bring people into a doctor ' s office , HMOs provide perfectly adequate care . &quot; But for that 15 % of things that are tertiary in nature , there will be some constraints on the ability to use all technology willy-nilly , &quot; said Hillman of the University of Pennsylvania .</TEXT>
