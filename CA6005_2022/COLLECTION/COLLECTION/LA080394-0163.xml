   <HEADLINE> CLINTON ASKS CONGRESS FOR ' GHOST_TOWN ' AID ; QUAKE : PRESIDENT REQUESTS $ 225 MILLION MAINLY FOR THE VACANT , CRIME-INFESTED ENCLAVES OF DAMAGED HOUSING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Responding to a shortage of money for restoring quake-damaged housing , President Clinton asked Congress on Tuesday to free up $ 225 million for the cities of Los Angeles and Santa Monica to issue as repair loans , particularly to those vacant , crime-infested enclaves known as &quot; ghost towns. &quot; The funding , leftover aid from highway and school repair programs , would provide zero-interest loans to hundreds of owners of wrecked apartment_buildings and condominiums unable to get loans through banks or other federal aid programs . Los Angeles housing officials praised the announcement , saying it will nearly close a shortfall in the money needed to repair the more_than 50 # 000 apartments , condos and single-family houses severely damaged Jan . 17 . Speaking_to Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Santa Monica Mayor Judy Abdo by telephone from Washington , Clinton called the money a &quot; down_payment on our partnership with the cities to solve this ' ghost_town ' problem. &quot; &quot; This goes beyond a typical federal disaster response and it ' s possible because we have been able to reallocate some_other disaster funds , &quot; he told the mayors , Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros and Sen . Dianne Feinstein , ( D-Calif. ) , who were also on the line from Washington . If the funding is approved by Congress , as expected , Los Angeles housing officials will get $ 200 million of the total , while Santa Monica -- which lost 5 % of its housing stock in the magnitude 6.8 quake -- will receive the $ 25-million balance . Both cities will reserve the money mostly for multifamily buildings . The funds are the latest of $ 11.9 billion in federal relief set_aside by the Clinton_Administration and Congress for quake victims in Southern California . The President took_advantage of the telephone conference_call -- and the media attention it had attracted -- to mention a glowing report on the federal response to the disaster . &quot; At every opportunity , federal agencies responded with speed , flexibility and creativity to meet the needs of earthquake victims , &quot; according to the report , drafted by the federal_Office of Management and Budget . Riordan said he requested the housing loans from Clinton last week after learning that an estimated $ 400-million surplus in federal funds set_aside for repairing quake damage to freeways and schools was available for other uses . The mayor said the money is to be funneled to multiunit housing repair loans because that is where city housing officials have identified a large gap between need and funds . &quot; This will give us the flexibility to use the money where it is needed , &quot; Riordan told Clinton . Money previously allocated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency , the Small Business Administration and private insurance_companies is expected to fund repairs of about 30 # 000 of the 50 # 000 severely damaged dwelling units in Los Angeles . City housing officials had already secured $ 110 million in funding from other federal and local sources , enough to repair another 5 # 000 units . But that left the owners of the remaining 15 # 000 or so units without any help , or hope . The money Clinton requested Tuesday is expected to repair most of those remaining units , said Gary Squier , general_manager of the Los Angeles city housing department . &quot; For the most part , these resources will take_care of the bulk of the ( remaining ) damage , &quot; he said . Particularly troubling for those housing officials trying to restore the city ' s damaged dwellings was the evolution of the so-called ghost_towns , clusters of vacant , damaged buildings that became infested with vagrants , scavengers , drug dealers , gang members and even prostitutes . Neighbors and city officials feared that the crime in those buildings would spread to nearby neighborhoods , and in some cases it quickly did . Two fires in vacant &quot; ghost_town &quot; buildings already have been blamed on trespassers . The city has launched an aggressive attack plan against ghost_towns that includes police sweeps followed by crews boarding_up and fencing off vacant buildings . In the latest step_in that process , the city has hired round-the-clock security_guards to keep trespassers out of the 12 ghost_towns identified in the San Fernando Valley , Hollywood and Mid-City area . The bulk of the money requested Tuesday will be available to owners within the ghost_towns , city officials said . After the phone conference with Clinton , Councilman Richard Alarcon , whose northeast Valley district includes two ghost_towns , said the money &quot; could not have come at a better time. &quot; &quot; This money , if approved by Congress , will make_it possible for the city to deal with one of our biggest problems -- the ghost-town buildings -- which still represent a hazard to the community. &quot; Another important aspect of the funding request is that the owners of severely damaged condominium units , which received an estimated $ 107-million damage in the quake , will have greater access to federal funds .
