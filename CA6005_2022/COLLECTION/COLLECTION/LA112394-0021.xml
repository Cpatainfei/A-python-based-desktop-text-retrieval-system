   <HEADLINE> PHILIP MORRIS CAMPAIGN FUNDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * I am disgusted by the heavy spending by the tobacco giant Philip Morris in the state Assembly district represented by Betty Karnette ( D-Long Beach ) . The Times reported that the giant tobacco company poured $ 125 # 000 into the campaign of Karnette ' s opponent , Steve Kuykendall , with the full awareness of Republican Jim Brulte ( Rancho Cucamonga ) , the wanna-be Speaker of the Assembly ( Nov . 17 ) . I believe that Karnette served the will of her district on smoking issues . As a constituent of the 54th District , I ' m pleased that my assemblywoman showed the courage to vote for the toughest state ban in the nation on smoking in the workplace . I ' m also pleased that Gov . Pete Wilson promptly signed this measure into law . On the surface , Kuykendall also seemed to be a critic of tobacco and special_interests . As a city councilman in Rancho Palos Verdes , he voted to oppose Prop . 188 and to also ban smoking in restaurants . He also focused his campaign wrath against &quot; special_interest money. &quot; Regrettably , it seems that all_of the high-sounding talk by Kuykendall was simply a hypocritical front . The truth is that he was willing to instantly put aside his earlier public record and so-called principles when some really big special_interest money came his way the weekend before election . The smoke and mirrors behind this buy-off by the tobacco_industry is revolting . At approximately $ 2 a pack , the Philip Morris contribution would buy more_than a pack of cigarettes for each person who voted for Kuykendall . Why risk losing a courageous civic_leader like Karnette to someone who should have simply been honest and stood outside the polling_booths passing_out loose cigarettes to any interested voter ? EVAN ANDERSON BRAUDE Long_Beach * * As a nonsmoker , I am most pleased to find that as a result of the election , Philip Morris will have its own representative in the California Assembly , Kuykendall , in the 54th District , to protect the corporation ' s interests . So nice of Philip Morris to donate that last-minute $ 125 # 000 to Steve ' s campaign . In addition , Rep . Thomas J . Bliley Jr . ( R-Va. ) , who resides in the same town as Philip Morris headquarters , I guess just down the street , now takes_over the chairmanship of Energy and Commerce , which so badly treated those tobacco CEOs because they denied nicotine is addictive . Mr. Butts is twice blessed ! BRYAN W . STEVENS Rolling Hills Estates * * Item , Nov . 11 : Rep . Bliley , announces that as incoming chair of a House subcommittee on health he will &quot; snuff_out &quot; congressional investigations of the tobacco_industry . &quot; I don ' t think we need any more legislation regulating tobacco , &quot; Bliley is quoted . The article goes_on to reveal that Philip Morris is the largest employer in Bliley ' s district and that Bliley ' s campaign received &quot; substantial contributions &quot; from the tobacco_industry . This is the kind of virtuous government , free from the influences of special_interests , that we can expect from Newt Gingrich and his Republican gang . CURTISS CLAYTON Los Angeles</TEXT>
