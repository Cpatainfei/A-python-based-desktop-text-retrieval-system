   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS : CITY_HALL AND BUREAUCRACY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Remember the old saying , &quot; The more things change , the more they stay the same &quot; ? Some would have us believe that a &quot; changing of the guard &quot; ( with a promised new direction ) is taking_place in Long_Beach because we have elected a new mayor and three new council_members -- even though experience tells us that the mayor has no real power and that council_members have been unable to demonstrate that they can rise above petty provincialism and move the city forward in a unified direction . Alvin Toffler , the celebrated futurist , has noted that in every election , whether you vote Democrat or Republican , one side always wins : the bureaucracy . This is true because in the struggle over reform , bureaucrats have always been able to outlast the politicians . This Murphy ' s Law of government has been reinforced locally with the recent passage of term limits . It is in the nature of bureaucracy to spend most of its energy protecting and preserving itself rather than serving its customers , not because the people who hold bureaucratic jobs are bad people but because their organizations lack the incentive to change . We must root_out the duplications and redundancy that cost Long_Beach taxpayers millions of dollars each year and produce no services , just high-paying jobs for City_Hall administrators , consultants and supervisors . We must examine each government program to determine whether it serves a compelling public interest . If so , we must find the most effective and efficient way to accomplish that goal . Now that the post-election euphoria has worn_off , I call_upon Mayor-elect Beverly O ' Neill and the new City_Council to create a &quot; reinventing government task_force &quot; to be responsible_for the oversight and execution of this process . As usual , the city_manager ' s current budget proposal to close_down the main library on Sundays and reduce park and street maintenance , coupled with increasing fees on natural_gas , refuse , water and sewer service , avoids the real issue . It ' s just another case of socking it to the little guy . I am unwilling to continue life support for an ailing City_Hall that is at the brink of financial , intellectual and moral collapse . I think I speak_for more_than 16 # 000 Long_Beach taxpayers who voted for me in the auditor ' s race when I say , reform or die . WILLIAM MOLNAR , Long_Beach . Molnar lost to incumbent Gary L . Burroughs in the Long_Beach city auditor ' s race in April .</TEXT>
