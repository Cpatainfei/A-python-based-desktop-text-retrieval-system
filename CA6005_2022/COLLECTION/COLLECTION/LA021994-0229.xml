   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE ROAD TO RECOVERY ; RUMORS ENHANCE ACTUAL SIZE OF QUAKE , EXPERTS SAY ; SEISMOLOGY : CONFUSION AMONG DIFFERENT SCALES FUELS BELIEFS THAT TEMBLOR WAS LARGER THAN REPORTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Confusion over different kinds of measurements of the size of the Northridge earthquake has led to rumors , growing_into convictions in some quarters , that the quake was bigger than it was . Part of the problem is that numbers used in some measurements -- such_as the Modified Mercalli scale , or gravity force readings from strong motion accelerographs -- are frequently higher than those used by scientists in news_reports of the magnitude of the quake . A 9 or 10 reading on the Mercalli scale , normally stated in Roman_numerals as IX or X , is not a magnitude reading , does not measure the same phenomena , and does not alter the 6.8-magnitude now used by the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden , Colo. , to describe the Northridge earthquake . Meanwhile , a chart that has been circulating in the San Fernando Valley by fax , or passed hand to hand , seems to say that the quake reached an unheard-of magnitude 9.8 in San Fernando and 9.5 in Northridge , among other spots . But these are not magnitude readings , seismologists and Caltech researchers pointed_out Friday . Some callers to The Times have said the chart comes from Caltech . But Caltech spokesmen say the school put_out no such chart , noting that , in any case , there is only one magnitude reading per quake , which does not vary from one community to another . &quot; The magnitude of an earthquake does not change with location , &quot; a Caltech spokesman said . &quot; The Northridge earthquake was ( the same ) whether you live_in Northridge or in San Diego. &quot; The commonly used magnitude scales are based on the power of the earthquake at the spot where it started , although they also reflect the length of the fault rupture and the duration of the shaking . The Northridge earthquake could not have been an 8 , scientists say , because the fault rupture was not long enough , nor did the shaking last long enough . The 6.8-magnitude quake lasted , including reverberations of quake waves , no more_than 30 seconds . By contrast , the shaking from the great Alaska earthquake of 1964 , whose magnitude was put by some scientists at 8.9 , lasted as long as seven minutes . The intensity of the shaking , moment by moment , might not have been much stronger than the worst moments of the Northridge earthquake , but the Alaska quake is rated as more powerful because it lasted longer and affected a bigger area , seismologists say . The Northridge magnitude , first put at 6.6 , was later officially upgraded to 6.8 by the scientists at Golden , using a surface wave scale , and to 6.7 by Caltech , the U.S. Geological Survey and UC Berkeley , using a moment magnitude scale of quake waves that have passed_through the Earth . None of these groups used the old Richter scale , which has fallen_into disuse because it distorts readings of quakes larger than magnitude 5 . Caltech scientist Egill Hauksson noted recently that the Richter reading of the Northridge quake would have been only 6.4. The Mercalli scale , developed by the Italian seismologist Giuseppi Mercalli in 1902 , and modified by American seismologists Harry Wood and Frank Neumann in 1931 , is a set of criteria , numbered from I to XII , that is used to describe a quake as it is variably experienced at many different locations . Such a quake may rate a XII ( &quot; Damage is total , and practically all works of construction are damaged greatly or destroyed &quot; ) near the epicenter . But the same quake would rate only a I ( &quot; Not felt by people , except under especially favorable circumstances &quot; ) at another place , several hundred miles away . Because the scale is based on subjectively perceived affects , rather than objectively measured ground movement , it has fallen_out of use by seismologists . The authorized descriptions are fairly lengthy , and most anyone who has felt a quake , by reading through the criteria under each Roman_numeral , can form a conclusion as_to what the Mercalli scale reading was where he or she felt the quake . Last week , at a hearing of the California Seismic Safety Commission , Richard Andrews , the director of the state Office of Emergency Services , released a map of &quot; estimated Modified Mercalli intensities &quot; for the Northridge quake , developed by EQE , a firm in San Francisco . Andrews hoped the map would show the quake in a different perspective , with its widely varying affects . The map showed various Mercalli intensities , ranging from X in Northridge and Reseda , down to VI in Malibu , Torrance , Carson , Long_Beach and other points , and less than VI farther away . The Mercalli definition for X shown on the map was : &quot; Most masonry and frame structures destroyed with their foundations . Some well-built wooden structures and bridges destroyed . Serious damage to dams , dikes , embankments . Large landslides . . . Rails bent slightly. &quot; The definition for VI was : &quot; Felt by all . Many frightened and run outdoors . Persons walk unsteadily . Windows , dishes , glassware broken . Knick knacks , books , etc . off shelves . Pictures off walls . Furniture moved or overturned . Weak plaster and masonry cracked. &quot; Some people from Van Nuys , which was mostly assigned a IX , felt that the shaking in their neighborhood was , instead , a VI , and they also questioned why nearby Sherman Oaks , where damage was greater , was assigned only an VIII , less than Van Nuys . Andrews , when asked about such matters , noted that the map reflected a computer model and not interviews with residents of specific neighborhoods coming_to a consensus . Charles Scawthorne , EQE ' s vice_president for research and development , readily agreed Friday that the map released last week &quot; is based on certain approximations , &quot; and where more_than one type of shaking occurred within a neighborhood , he acknowledged that the Mercalli measurement had split the difference . &quot; I think the main message is , this map is a simplified picture of the effects of the earthquake , &quot; he concluded . &quot; In general , it ' s accurate . In detail , it may_not be. &quot; In some areas , the chart being circulated by unknown parties in the Valley appears to list EQE ' s assigned Mercalli levels as if they were magnitudes . Changing Roman_numerals to Arabic ones , it conveys the false impression that the magnitude for the quake was higher than announced . Scawthorne said he believes that another type of quake measurement -- accelerographic instruments measuring gravity forces , which has come more into vogue in the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake -- should be a preferred form of measurement . These numbers , such_as the extraordinarily high 1.82g Tarzana reading reported in a Times story Friday , show shaking intensities at various points , and may be a better way of gauging the strength of an earthquake at various points than either magnitude or Mercalli scales . But accelerographs must be there before the quake occurs , and in most recent quakes , they have been too widely scattered to provide a comprehensive picture .</TEXT>
