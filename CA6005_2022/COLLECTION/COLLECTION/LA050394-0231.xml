   <HEADLINE> BANNED ENTRY TAKES TOP HONORS AT SINGAPORE FILM FEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Singapore ' s fourth annual film festival , designed to showcase the latest wave in Asian cinema , has ended on a surreal note with an entry banned by censors walking_off with top honors . Eric Khoo , a young Singaporean filmmaker , won back-to-back awards for best director and special achievement in the short film category for his film &quot; Pain , &quot; which deals with a man ' s obsession with enduring pain . The awards were given by a jury of filmmakers and critics from India , Indonesia , Malaysia , Britain and Singapore . The film , which apparently contains some graphic scenes of violence , was banned from exhibition by the Singapore government film censorship board . All films and videos must be submitted to the censorship board even for private screenings and films containing graphic sex or violence are frequently cut or banned in Singapore . When Khoo was called to receive his awards by the master of ceremonies on Saturday night , the hall darkened for the expected film_clip , but a voice intoned , &quot; I ' m sorry , this film is banned by the Singapore government. &quot; The audience whistled and booed . Khoo , obviously pleased to have won two awards , said after winning his second silver medallion , &quot; I hope the film censorship board will change its mind about my film. &quot; &quot; Welcome to Singapore , &quot; joked actress Rani Moorthy , who hosted the evening ' s presentation . When Singapore journalists asked British producer Donald Ranvaud , a member of the jury , why they had given two awards to a banned film , he replied : &quot; All the more reason it should be recognized . None of us really recognize censorship where you keep people from having their own opinions in making what they feel is important. &quot; Singapore novelist Gobal Baratham , who writes a column for the government-controlled Straits Times newspaper , then again stunned the audience when he rose to present the International Federation of Film Critics award for best film . Baratham said he was an unusual choice to make the presentation because he has boycotted the movies in Singapore for the past 25 years &quot; because I refuse to watch censored films. &quot; The audience cheered . The winner was &quot; The Blue Kite , &quot; a Chinese production that is banned in China . The movie also won for best Asian actress , Lu Liping , and for best director , Tian Zhuangzhuang . Another film banned in China , &quot; Beijing Bastards , &quot; shared the special_jury prize with a film from Taiwan , &quot; Rebels of the Neon God. &quot; When the &quot; Blue Kite &quot; and &quot; Beijing Bastards &quot; were shown at a film festival in Hong Kong recently , the Chinese government delegation walked_out en masse in protest .</TEXT>
