   <TEXT> Here are some scenes from the black-and-white yesterday of an ancient land on the western rim of Europe : Portuguese literati traveling_to Paris to see movies banned by government censors ; thrill-seeking teen-agers crossing the Spanish border ( closed at night ) to taste Coca-Cola forbidden at_home . &quot; It was another planet ; a silent country where people were not allowed to speak and there was nothing to say , &quot; says Isabel Carlos , a 32-year-old art critic . &quot; It was the Portugal of weeping women in black . Today , if we wear black , it ' s because black is fashionable. &quot; In a single generation , Portugal has reversed four centuries of backwardness and isolation to become a democratic , getting-rich partner of the new Europe . Today , secret_police files from the 46-year rule of Western Europe ' s longest-lived modern dictatorship drowse in cardboard rows two miles long at the national archives . The files , more voluminous than those compiled during three centuries of the Inquisition , were newly opened for inspection by their victims . But few come_to examine them , says archivist Maria de Lourdes Henriques . The past has passed . With considerable grace and a remarkable absence of rancor , Portugal has digested a peaceful revolution 20 years ago this spring that amounted to a change of century . No Portuguese will ever forget how the audacious revolt by young officers triggered public jubilation : red carnations in rifle barrels . But what next ? The revolution ' s anniversary is prompting reflection . Vaulted improbably into the hurly-burly of a consumer society that few imagined , Portuguese increasingly wonder where change will lead them . Frontiers that have preserved the wholeness of a culture for 900 years , longer than any other land borders_on Earth , are increasingly just lines on the map of a united Europe . Can grilled sardinhas and vinho verde outpoint hot dogs and Gatorade ? Portugal ' s rush from oppression to modernity to perplexity , like that of Iberian neighbor Spain , may prove an object_lesson to the rapidly transforming nations of Eastern Europe . How much of a singular national character , how many traditions of a small , long-isolated country , can survive the swift , steady onslaught of international values and culture ? Such unsettling questions are part of the price for foreign investment and influence that includes $ 10 million a day in economic aid to Portugal from its European Union partners through the end of the century . Whether Portugal risks losing its political identity , and the very essence of its &quot; Portuguese-ness , &quot; is an agenda-setting issue for next month ' s elections to the European Parliament . Still , not many Lisboners strolling the streets of a capital that remains more Old_World than high-tech would happily turn_back pages in the national diary . &quot; How lucky we are . We ' ve lived 200 years in the last 20 , &quot; muses Felipe La Feria , a theater impresario who remembers how censors once scissored his lines when he was a young actor . As a matter_of_fact , it is hard to overstate the backwardness of Portugal under dictator Antonio de Oliveira Salazar , who took power in 1928 and ruled_in high-polished boots until he was replaced because of illness in 1968 . By 1974 , when Salazar ' s heirs were toppled by the armed forces , Portugal was a rural society , isolated , insular and dirt poor : Per capita income was about $ 2 per day . &quot; It was a heavy , closed place . Very codified . There was hardly any contact with the outside world . Nothing happened in Lisbon , and if you wanted something to happen , they would n ' t let it , &quot; said Paulo Pereira , a 36-year-old museum curator who spent his early teen years worrying about being drafted to fight colonial wars . Ignored by the world , Portugal huddled by the Atlantic with its back to Europe , preoccupied with a sapping , bloody struggle to preserve a chimerical empire of African colonies : Salazar and his heirs dispatched more_than 800 # 000 young_men to Africa to fight in 13 years of colonial conflict that claimed the lives of nearly 9 # 000 Portuguese soldiers , a loss about four times greater with_respect_to population than that suffered by the United States in Vietnam . &quot; War ended the isolation of we military_officers from the realities of our country , &quot; said Vasco Lourenco , 51 , a leader among the rebellious captains who staged the 1974 revolt . Political and economic tumult after the April Revolution brought Communists to within an ace of power in 1975 . But when socialist Mario Soares , a fierce , indomitable democrat , emerged as prime_minister , passions began to ebb . Not even the Portuguese themselves seem certain why they have been able to absorb the revolution so coolly . Perhaps it is because where Portugal is today is so_much better for almost everyone than where it lingered so_long . Then too , Portuguese are fond of pointing_out that while they are as rabidly enamored of bullfighting as their neighbors in Spain , they are also different : In Portugal , the bull lives -- symbolic , perhaps , of a country in which extremism has fallen from fashion . &quot; Ours was a generous revolution . There were no trials , but there was a moral judgment , &quot; Soares recently told a group of reporters in explaining the success of Portugal ' s political transformation . Now , as president and graying elder_statesman , the 68-year-old Soares is a restive liberal counterpoint to Prime_Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva , a free-market moderate who since the mid-1980s has directed landmark growth and Portugal ' s integration into the European Union . Once , intellectual and commercial life languidly unfolded in Lisbon coffee_bars . Today , the coffee drinker at the next table is apt to be sipping past her cellular_phone . Francisco Capelo , a former self-described Stalinist &quot; professor of revolution , &quot; is symbolic of a once feisty but now waning left . These days , Capelo is an art-collecting businessman and director of a new private &quot; cheaply commercial &quot; television channel that has won a 30 % audience share_in its first 18 months . &quot; I still vote Socialist , &quot; Capelo confided over an expensive bottle of Portuguese wine , &quot; but times have changed . In foreign newspapers I ' ve switched from ( the_French intellectual ) Le Monde to the ( British business ) Financial Times . I no longer have time for theories . I need facts. &quot; A child of change , the old-fashioned Portuguese language of Salazar ' s day now sambas with lively words and images imported from Brazil , to the dismay of the same sort of well-spoken folk who decry the undermining of the Queen ' s English by Americanisms . English , in fact , has replaced French as the first foreign language of educated Portuguese . Almost as an epitaph to Salazar ' s portrayal of Portugal as a country that &quot; stands proudly alone , &quot; Lisbon not long ago became the last capital in Western Europe to get a McDonald ' s . Fueled by booming private investment and huge transfusions of European Union cash , Portuguese living standards have increased dramatically over the last 20 years . Per capita income , about $ 700 at the time of the revolution , is more_than $ 8 # 000 , and Portugal has vaulted past Greece off the bottom rung of the European Union ladder . In a single generation , infant_mortality has fallen from 41 to 6 per 1 # 000 . There are three times as_many doctors and university_students in Portugal today as there were 20 years ago . Socially , a rock-ribbed society has become less conservative . The birthrate halved between 1973 and 1993 , while divorces jumped from 509 to 12 # 429 . There was one priest for every 4 # 968 inhabitants in 1973 , one for every 12 # 663 last year , according to a study by Sergio Figueiredo for the Lisbon newspaper Expresso . Nearly half the Portuguese live_in cities today ; 20 years ago , three of four still lived_on the land . Metropolitan Lisbon , with about 3 million people -- nearly a third of the national population -- is not much smaller than Rome . Rapid_growth has also brought unwanted change : Massive internal migration from the countryside to cities and the coast has aggravated a profound agricultural crisis and created Latin American-like shantytowns of poor new settlers . Yesterday ' s revolutionaries such_as Lourenco say they are generally satisfied with the 20-year result of their handiwork but point to disappointing shortcomings in the rush to join Western Europe ' s consumer wonderland . &quot; We bet_on democracy , and I think we have won . We ' ve made huge transformations and avoided falling_into new dictatorships , but our ideas went beyond formal democracy , &quot; said Lourenco , who runs a small import-export business . &quot; They had a lot to do with social justice , and over time , it must be said , there has been a regression . There is a growing gap between rich and poor . The middle_class is shrinking . Social and economic problems are growing . We see the face of racism and xenophobia. &quot; If the Portuguese are richer than ever , they are still far behind their continental partners economically . National programs of health , welfare , unemployment_compensation and retirement pensions are all_in crisis . Crime , trifling by American standards , is higher than ever . AIDS and drugs are unwelcome signposts of the new consumer society . A three-month campaign to exchange old syringes for new , sterilized ones has netted half a_million needles . Young_men are no longer killed in distant wars , but with five times as_many cars on_the_roads as in 1974 , highway carnage is a matter of national alarm . The prospect of integration with larger partners is making the Portuguese wonder about their future as a small fish in the big European pond . &quot; Portugal risks becoming Europe ' s favorite busboy , &quot; Soares warned at a conference this month on the nation ' s future . &quot; How are we to begin to live as a nation when the European funds run_out or decrease significantly ? . . . We cannot disguise or ignore the certain sense of anguish gnawing within so many Portuguese as they are faced with growing uncertainty and insecurity. &quot; Joaquim Vieira , 43 , spent 18 months in jail as a teen-age student leader under Salazar and is now a thoughtful Lisbon newspaperman . He says questions about the future color the way politicians are addressing voters . &quot; Nobody talks_about federalism , or pushing the European Union , &quot; he says . &quot; Rather , some people wonder if we ' ll become a wholly owned subsidiary of Spain or some multinational corporation . Or perhaps a game reserve where rich Europe comes for sun and beaches. &quot; There is a realization , Vieira says , that a certain surrender of national individuality is inevitable : &quot; When you open a country to the world it becomes different . The essence of a_people remains , but some things become universal -- like the use of satellites. &quot; Nationalists such_as Lourenco believe there is no chance that proud , old Portugal will find itself swallowed by Europe . Even after hundreds of years , traditions endure among the descendants of Portuguese settlers in North and South_America , he notes . National traits , such_as the love of cod fish -- bacalhau -- and the haunting fado -- love poetry set_to_music -- are indelible , he says . &quot; Despite all_the changes , our culture is very strong . We ' re a bit like Jews the way we retain our traditions and sense of nationhood , &quot; Lourenco says . &quot; Sure , our kids will go and eat hamburgers , but they ' ll always come_home to the bacalhau -- they ' re Portuguese. &quot; Portugal Fact Sheet In the 20 years since its peaceful rvolution against dictatorship , the once-isolated country has become an integral partner of the new Europe Government : Republic .
