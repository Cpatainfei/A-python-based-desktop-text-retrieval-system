   <HEADLINE> CHANGE IN MARS OBSERVER ' S FLIGHT PLAN MAY HAVE CAUSED ITS DEMISE ; SPACE : PRESSURIZING THE $ 500-MILLION CRAFT ' S PROPELLANT TANKS WAS DELAYED FOR 11 MONTHS . VALVES WERE NOT DESIGNED FOR ALTERED CONDITIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seven months before the launch of NASA ' s Mars Observer , managers made a change in the flight plan that might have caused the $ 500-million spacecraft to vanish on Aug . 21 , according to sources familiar_with the program . Instead of pressurizing the craft ' s propellant tanks five days after the launch , as originally planned , NASA managers decided to delay the procedure for 11 months -- until the Observer reached the red_planet . They did so , ironically , to avert a potentially serious leak , officials said . But the valves had not been designed to operate under the altered conditions , the sources said , and the result was probably an even worse leak that caused a catastrophic rupture in a fuel_line and spun the craft out of control . The fact that the change in plan was made_did not come_up during a press briefing Wednesday at NASA headquarters , where an independent investigating panel reported its conclusions about what happened to the spacecraft and why . Sources familiar_with the program expressed surprise that mention of this management decision was omitted from the briefing and also from the report ' s executive summary and overview that were released to the press . The change is described , however , in at least two places deep inside the report ' s eight-inch-thick , four-volume documentation , which was not released to the press but was available for review at NASA headquarters . Timothy Coffey , chairman of the investigating board , was traveling and not available for comment , his office said . Others on the panel said they were not sure why the management decision to delay pressurizing the tanks was not mentioned . The disappearance of the Observer is one of several embarrassments for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in recent years . In 1989 , it launched the Hubble Space Telescope with what was later found to be a faulty mirror ; corrective optics were installed in a spectacular spacewalk mission last month . And about the same time that the Observer disappeared , the antenna on the Galileo probe to Jupiter malfunctioned . NASA also has been plagued by cost_overruns on its space_station project . The decision to change the pressurization plan for the Mars probe was made in February , 1992 , because someone reminded the team that a similar propulsion_system used on the Viking missions to Mars in the late 1970s had run_into leakage problems when the fuel tanks were pressurized early in the flights , Glenn E . Cunningham , Mars Observer project manager at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , said last week . As to why this concern developed so late in the program -- after it was too late to make what would have been a simple mechanical fix and still meet the launch date -- Cunningham said : &quot; that ' s the $ 64 question. &quot; The decision to delay pressurization was not questioned by anyone at the contractor firm , JPL or NASA headquarters . &quot; With benefit of 20-20 hindsight , &quot; Cunningham said , &quot; it appears that probably all_of us did not do as much analysis on this new condition as probably should have been done. &quot; Controllers at JPL lost contact with the Observer late on Aug . 21 , 1993 , while trying to perform the procedure they had decided to delay : pressurizing the propellant tanks . The tanks have to be pressurized to fire the braking rockets , which would put the Observer into orbit around Mars . The investigators said last Wednesday that the most likely cause of the spacecraft ' s catastrophic loss was a &quot; massive failure in the pressurization side of the propulsion system. &quot; Pressure in the tanks was required for any major maneuvers by the spacecraft , but the Observer team had determined that none would be needed between Earth and Mars -- assuming the launch went well . ( They had left a small amount of residual pressure stored in the tanks before launch for minor course corrections en route. ) Pressurizing the tanks involves opening previously closed valves and releasing high-pressure helium gas , whose function is to squeeze the hydrazine fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer out of separate tanks to mix and ignite in a controlled way . If the investigators ' conclusions are correct , the failure ' s most likely cause was the escape of small quantities of the oxidizer through a system of check valves during the spacecraft ' s 11-month , 450-million-mile cruise through space . When JPL controllers tried to pressurize the tanks , minute amounts of condensed oxidizer may have been carried prematurely into contact with the hydrazine fuel . The combination would have ignited inside the plumbing and ruptured it , spewing jets of propellant into space and putting the spacecraft into a rapid , uncontrolled spin that rendered it useless . &quot; There was no problem with the check valves , &quot; said a planetary engineer who asked not to be identified . &quot; The valves were never intended to be operated that way. &quot; When the Observer was designed and built , the assumption was that the valves would have to operate five days , not 11 months , and not in such cold temperatures . The valves , made by two different subcontractors , were regarded_as assembly-line items that had been proven in other spacecraft . But they had operated only in the relative warmth of near-Earth orbit , investigators said , never in the deep cold of an interplanetary voyage . In 1992 , the Observer team debated the change in procedures extensively before it was approved , said Peter G . Wilhelm , a member of the investigating panel and director of the Naval Center for Space Technology . He focused_on the propulsion_system . &quot; Was the decision prudent ? that ' s what the debate was all about , &quot; he said , adding that changes so late in the game are acceptable , &quot; assuming you make the right change. &quot;</TEXT>
