   <HEADLINE> BONES OF CONTENTION ; IT HAS ALL THE INGREDIENTS OF A WESTERN : A RANCHER , A BIG-CITY INTERLOPER AND A RANGE WAR . BUT THIS SKIRMISH OVER EVOLUTION DOESN ' T STAR CATTLE . IT ' S OVER DINOSAURS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here ' s an idea for a dinosaur movie : A big-city paleontologist discovers dinosaur bones on a Wyoming ranch . Maybe millions of bones , adding_up to a herd of perhaps 8 # 000 giant duckbill dinosaurs . Naturally , there ' s a catch . The duckbill graveyard is_on land owned by a Christian cowboy so opposed to evolution he won ' t even let anyone lecture about it on his ranch . Despite their differences , the scientist and the rancher become friends . Both are fascinated by the fossils and both want to build an educational field station . But neither will budge on how life began . The scientist won ' t be a party to teaching creationism ; the rancher threatens to turn the whole dig over to a &quot; creation paleontologist. &quot; Imagine a high-plains version of &quot; Inherit the Wind. &quot; In the Wyoming version , no one is threatened with jail over evolution , but the future of a major scientific discovery is at stake . Meet paleontologist Kraig Derstler and rancher Glenn Hanson , the ontological odd couple who are living the movie in real_life . Derstler discovered the Dragon ' s Grave bone bed on Hanson ' s ranch last summer . But if the two men can ' t agree on a lease for the site by Aug . 12 , Derstler might lose the right to dig the bones . Derstler , 40 , is a professor of paleontology at the University of New Orleans . His prematurely gray hair gives him the distinguished , academic look you ' d want for the movie . On a dig he favors blue_jeans , running_shoes , T-shirts and a blue bandanna . Hanson , 77 , has lived all his life on the ranch his father homesteaded in 1908 . His jeans aren ' t as faded as Derstler ' s , but his belt_buckle is much bigger . At 6 feet , 2 inches tall and 180 pounds , wearing a beat-up cowboy_hat and battered cowboy_boots , Hanson is right out of Central Casting too . The cowboy and the scientist met in 1990 , when Derstler began exploring the Lance Formation in eastern Wyoming . The Lance is a crescent-shaped sandstone outcropping , one of the most fertile dinosaur fields on Earth . It runs 100 miles from Lance Creek in the south to the Montana border in the north and is 20 miles across at its widest point . Paleontologists first found bones here in 1888 ( the Triceratops horridus is the most common Lance specimen ) , but in 1900 , just two miles southeast of the Hanson ranch , Barnum Brown discovered the first complete Tyrannosaurus_rex skeleton . It is still on display in the_British Museum . The Hanson ranch is smack-dab in the middle of the Lance . &quot; My sister and I used to gallop around these hills and see these bones everywhere , &quot; Hanson says , although he admits he was more interested in the buffalo skulls . Last summer , Hanson led Derstler to a rugged system of gullies that Derstler would later name Dragon ' s Grave . &quot; There were just tons of bones on the surface , &quot; Derstler says . &quot; That means there ' s hundreds of thousands beneath the surface , and more likely millions. &quot; Most of the bones belong_to one species , the three-ton , plant-eating Edmontosaurus annectens , commonly known as the duckbill dinosaur . By Derstler ' s conservative estimate , the remains of 300 duckbills lie buried here . His reasonable estimate is 3 # 000 . His liberal estimate is 8 # 000 . Derstler says it will take a decade to excavate this site . He wants to set_up a field station to support a long-term dig and to teach paleontology . Some bones would be displayed at the site . Others would go_to a Wyoming museum . But first he needs a lease from Hanson . that ' s a problem . * Glenn Hanson flat does not believe_in evolution . &quot; I think God created everything , &quot; he says . &quot; You look_at the flowers , the grass , the sun coming_up every day . I just do not believe all that happens by accident. &quot; A lot of &quot; all that &quot; happens here . The 8 # 000-acre Hanson place is in big country , right out of a John Ford Western . The Black Hills of South_Dakota loom on the eastern horizon , 35 miles away . On a clear day , you can see the Laramie Mountains 50 miles south . Prairie_dogs , horned toads , rattlesnakes , deer , antelope , coyotes , foxes and golden_eagles live here . Hanson ' s father cleared_out the last den of gray_wolves in 1913 , but mountain_lions are making a comeback . A newcomer might call the ranch desolate , with its sagebrush , prickly_pear_cactus and barren gullies . Hanson would disagree . He says the native grasses are rich_in protein : &quot; It ' s almost like feed grain. &quot; And the Cheyenne River , which runs_through the ranch , provides bottomland for hay . The ranch offers history_lessons too . There are remains of tepee rings and a homesteader ' s dugout . Hanson collects Native_American artifacts , and an archeologist told him one of his lance points was 8 # 000 years old . Hanson believes it , although some creationists put the age of Earth at 6 # 000 years . &quot; This Bible ' s been translated from several languages , so there ' s room for error , &quot; he says . But not much error . Hanson refuses to believe dinosaurs are millions of years old . He thinks man and duckbill coexisted only thousands of years ago . &quot; I absolutely do , &quot; he says . &quot; They all went together. &quot; Hanson is an odd sort of creationist . For example , he has never been a regular church-goer . The nearest town , Newcastle , Wyo. , is 40 miles north . When he was a boy , that meant a six-hour ride_on horseback . &quot; Five , if you didn ' t think too_much of your horse. &quot; He says he never worried much about creation or evolution . He was too busy breaking horses for $ 5 a head . &quot; When I started getting $ 10 a head , boy , I was in the money. &quot; He married his wife , Phyllis , in 1939 , and they raised five kids . Today , a daughter runs the ranch , but Hanson helps . He also reads the Bible and creationist literature , which claims , among other things , that human footprints have been found next to those of dinosaurs and that Charles_Darwin recanted evolution on his deathbed . &quot; I didn ' t start_out to be a creationist , but I ' m getting_to be one more and more , &quot; Hanson says . Paleontologists who visited his ranch in the late 1940s told him the dinosaurs were 250 million years old . &quot; Now they are saying 65 million years . They got quite a bit younger in the last 45 years. &quot; Hanson thinks the dinosaurs will continue to get younger . &quot; Ever since Darwin , they ' ve been trying to dig_up evidence that one kind of animal has changed into another kind , and they haven ' t done_it yet . I think Kraig will admit that. &quot; * Derstler will not admit that . He says there is plenty of evidence for evolution , ranging from relationships in the fossil records to observations of live animals . He also points_out that ages of dinosaurs have been established by radiometric dating , fission-track dating and thermoluminescence , all_of which produce a similar conclusion : The dinosaurs disappeared about 65 million years ago . Like Hanson , Derstler is fascinated by the natural world . His home_in New Orleans is a menagerie . Derstler ' s wife , Debbie Pearson , is the education director of the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans , and she has permits to keep wild animals , including a coyote , a Harris hawk and &quot; tons of snakes , frogs and turtles. &quot; Derstler also shares Hanson ' s interest in buffalo . He wants to reconstruct duckbill dinosaur skeletons near a live buffalo herd to show similarities in bone structure . Derstler grew_up on the edge of Pennsylvania ' s Amish country , but he doesn ' t belong_to an organized religion . He is more likely to read the Tao Te Ching than the Bible . &quot; I find in both of them great beauty and wisdom , but I don ' t find the truth in either one , &quot; he says . He regards their stories as &quot; illuminating myths , &quot; not factual accounts . Derstler ' s worldview : &quot; It ' s a big , beautiful , glorious world that happened by chance. &quot; But that ' s his opinion . For facts , he turns_to Dragon ' s Grave , the ideal dinosaur-dig movie set . * Dragon ' s Grave is dominated by five major ridges separated by deep gulches . Derstler ' s crew is digging on Ridge 2-C , which offers a view of the Hanson house two miles to the south , the Cheyenne River beyond that and a ridge 15 miles distant . &quot; Ranchers around here call this ' rough country , ' &quot; Derstler says . In fact , the bone crew had to camp half a mile away . They haul most of their equipment in on foot . The Lance Formation sandstone is so soft you can carve your initials in it with a dull knife , which makes_it perfect for digging fossils . The crew had found more_than 200 bones by mid-July , including a large duckbill jawbone . But Derstler says the eggshell fragments they found and the tiny jawbone from a baby duckbill are even more exciting . Some experts think that duckbills hatched their young on higher ground , near Canada , then moved_into the swampy coastline that later became the Hanson place . The egg and the baby ' s jaw could change that theory . * Hanson would throw_out the entire theory . He insists creationism is science and evolution is wrong . A field station on his ranch would have to represent that view , which Derstler cannot abide . After an evening discussion recently , both men were pessimistic about the future of Dragon ' s Grave . &quot; If we can ' t come_to a better understanding , I don ' t think it ' s going_to go , &quot; Hanson says . &quot; He just said , ' Science isn ' t based on truths , it ' s based on theories. ' &quot; To Hanson , that is paramount to saying evolution is hogwash . Derstler says Hanson misunderstood him . &quot; Truth is something that requires a God ' s-eye view of the world , and scientists don ' t have access to that at all. &quot; Instead , scientists start with facts and work toward theories . If new facts don ' t match the old theory , they get a new theory . Derstler says creationists depart from science because they start with a theory and look_for facts to fit it . Hanson won ' t debate the fine points of creationism . &quot; I ' m just a plain old cowpoke . that ' s all there is to it. &quot; But he was disturbed when a group of children visited the site last year . &quot; When I saw all those little kids up there , so interested , I just didn ' t think we should teach them wrong. &quot; What would be right ? &quot; There are creation paleontologists who are willing to come_in here. &quot; Derstler says if Hanson brings_in &quot; creation paleontologists , &quot; real science will suffer . Derstler says his own research will be set_back three or four years . This summer ' s dig ends Aug . 12 . The two men agreed on that as a deadline to settle the future of Dragon ' s Grave . Both insist that they will remain friends , no matter what happens . They have come_to respect each other . Hanson was grateful when the bone crew dropped everything to help put_out a prairie fire . For his part , Hanson has been a gracious , generous host . His home is a message center for the bone crew . And Phyllis Hanson frequently sends goodies -- biscuits and home-canned peaches -- to the paleontologists ' isolated camp . &quot; The Hansons are wonderful people , &quot; Derstler says . &quot; We do get_along most of the day , &quot; Hanson says . &quot; But watch_out in the evenings . We ' re dangerous. &quot; Maybe . But neither man is likely to violate the admonition from Proverbs : &quot; He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind , &quot; which is where the movie might have problems . Spencer Tracy and Fredric March dueled in a hot Tennessee courtroom over the evolution of species . Wyoming is plenty hot in summer , but Hanson owns the land and the fossils free and clear . There will be no dramatic courtroom finish here -- only silence should the digging stop at Dragon ' s Grave , where seldom is heard an evolutionary word . Edmontosaurus annectens * Alias : Duckbill dinosaur . * Weight : Three tons or more . * Length : Thirty to 40 feet , head to tail . * Height : Ten feet or more at the shoulder . * Dining Habits : Plants ( remains of conifers have been found in a stomach ) . * Where They Roamed : Lowland woods , bogs and marshes of the Western United States .</TEXT>
