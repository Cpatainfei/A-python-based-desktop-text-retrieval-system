   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : TODAY ' S AGENDA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Drug use among teen-agers is rising again after dropping for more_than a decade , according to a recently released federal study . Although the use of hard_drugs such_as cocaine and heroin has not gone_up , the increased use of other illicit substances cuts_across all socio-economic levels . The study , however , showed that despite public perceptions , the lowest level of illicit drug use was reported among African American students . Still the question is , what is prompting the increase ? In Youth Opinion , a sampling of Southern California teens give their views . Some suggest that programs such_as DARE don ' t work while others say they should be expanded to include high_school students . DARE is a federally funded course that sends police_officers into classrooms to turn kids away from drugs before they get started . Still other kids say these programs use scare tactics that just don ' t work anymore . And what about the national debate over legalization for adults ? Could it be having an effect on the thinking of younger people ? The Clinton_Administration and particularly Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders have been criticized on the issue . Elders riled many when she said that the country should study legalization . One critic of the Administration ' s policy , former drug czar William Bennett , said the White_House has not done enough to discourage the use of illegal drugs . But some national and local officials side with Elders -- including Orange County Superior_Court Judge James P . Gray , former Secretary_of_State George Shultz , conservative columnist William F . Buckley and Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman . Another problem may be the continuing use of marijuana by baby_boomers . What kind of message are they sending to teen-agers ? According to Lloyd Johnston , the University of Michigan research scientist who conducted the survey , the use of marijuana increased by three or four percentage_points during the last two years among eighth- , 10th- and 12th-graders . In 1993 , the proportion of students reporting marijuana use in the previous year was 9 % for 8th-graders , 19 % for 10th-graders and 26 % for seniors . Although the rates of illicit drug use are_well below the peak levels reached in the late 1970s , &quot; they clearly represent a reversal of the declines we recorded for more_than a decade , &quot; Johnston said . The Administration now seems prepared to take action . Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E . Shalala has said that she plans to contact the presidents of broadcast networks , film studios , record companies and professional sports leagues to urge them &quot; to rededicate themselves to getting the message out about prevention. &quot; And current drug czar Lee P . Brown said that he will convene a national meeting of experts in prevention and drug education to confront the problem of drug_abuse by young people . Said Shalala when the study was announced : &quot; These findings are more_than a warning signal. &quot;</TEXT>
