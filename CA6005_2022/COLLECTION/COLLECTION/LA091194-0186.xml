   <HEADLINE> THE HEALTHY TRAVELER : MOUNTAIN_BIKE CLIMBING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During a typical week of the prime June-to-September mountain-biking season , Karl Lund escorts 20 riders on_tours around Deer Valley Resort in Park City , Utah . Cyclists experience a range of elevations , from about 8 # 000 to 9 # 400 feet , Lund said . And before each tour is over -- whether the ride is a five-mile jaunt or a full-day outing -- Lund is likely to hear at least a_few complaints . &quot; Some riders are short of breath or dizzy , or their wrists have become fatigued from the rough terrain , &quot; said Lund , director of the resort ' s mountain_bike school . Other riders complain about exhaustion or muscle aches and pains . About 6 million cyclists now ride off-road regularly , according to estimates from the International Mountain Bicycling Assn . As mountain biking has caught_on in a big way , so has awareness that it ' s not as simple as taking a cruise around the block . For some , that epiphany comes a bit too late , occurring , for example , when the cyclist is pedaling up the first steep hill . The difference between finishing a mountain_bike tour feeling tired but accomplished or tired , defeated and in pain has a lot to do with conditioning , good preparation and an honest assessment of one ' s physical shape , said Lund and other experts . But there are many ways to prepare . Know your level of health and fitness before pedaling off , said Dr. Bert Mandelbaum , an orthopedic surgeon and director of sports medicine at St . John ' s Hospital and Medical_Center , Santa Monica , and an avid cyclist . &quot; If you are a non-athlete over age 35 , consult your doctor first for appropriate testing , &quot; he said . Once a physician gives the green_light , mountain bikers should devote adequate time to getting_into shape or improving their fitness . &quot; Pre-trip conditioning is no short-term rush project , &quot; said Tim Blumenthal , executive_director of the International Mountain Bicycling Assn . in Boulder , Colo . &quot; One of the best things to do is to recognize your own ( fitness ) condition and to know what kind of terrain you will be riding. &quot; Training on terrain similar to what you will be riding can be very helpful . For recreational , low-intensity bike tours , riders should start getting_into better condition at least one month in_advance of a trip , Mandelbaum said . &quot; Try to ride an hour a day , four times a week , &quot; he advised . For more intensive tours , start training at least three months in_advance , Mandelbaum said . Spend six or seven hours a week on the bike . Later , include hill and interval training . If the tour will be at altitude , try to train at altitude at least on some pre-trip rides . The week before the tour should be not as intensive but , rather , a kind of detraining week , Mandelbaum said . Wearing proper safety equipment can help ensure comfort . Helmets are a necessity . Pick those approved by ANSI or the Snell Foundation , Blumenthal said . Bike gloves can help absorb shock and keep hands from getting fatigued , experts agreed . Cycling shorts with a padded crotch are recommended . Sneakers are acceptable footwear , Blumenthal said , but stiffer shoes such_as bike shoes can be more comfortable in the long_run . Take along a bike first-aid_kit , readily available in most cycling stores . Be sure the bike is in good_condition . Attention to diet can also help riders sail_through a mountain_bike tour . Stick_to a high carbohydrate diet , Mandelbaum said , especially just before the tour . And drink plenty of fluids the day before . He recommends sports drinks with electrolytes and carbohydrate mixtures . Take along sports bars to maintain energy during the ride . To prevent altitude-related problems on the bike tour , take it slow once you arrive_at the destination . If possible , allow at least one day of non-strenuous activity to adjust to the higher altitude . Altitude_sickness , also called mountain_sickness , occurs because of reduced atmospheric_pressure and , thus , reduced oxygen . The oxygen level in the blood declines and other blood chemistry changes occur . It can be life-threatening if it progresses_to severe stages . Those with heart and lung problems or uncontrolled diabetes are more prone , but it can strike anyone . &quot; You can be fit at_sea level and have problems with altitude , &quot; Mandelbaum said . Altitude problems can begin at elevations of 4 # 000 feet . Feeling winded can be the first symptom . Others may include dizziness , headaches , drowsiness , nausea and fatigue . When altitude problems surface , switch to a lower pace and lower_gears , Mandelbaum advised . Descend to a lower elevation . If symptoms still don ' t improve , seek medical help . The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of every month .</TEXT>
