   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENTALISTS FILE SUIT OVER ANTI-SMOG PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Environmentalists long critical of Southern California ' s controversial new pollution trading market filed a lawsuit Tuesday that contends that the fledgling free-enterprise approach to curbing smog does not meet legal requirements for reducing air_pollution . The suit , filed by Citizens For A Better Environment , argues that the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market , which began operating Jan . 1 , is not as effective as the 1991 clean air plan it replaces.The suit also says that the amount of allowable pollution under RECLAIM had increased by 5 % and is pouring about 1 # 000 tons of additional pollution into the skies . The world ' s first free_enterprise program designed to clean_up urban air_pollution , RECLAIM allots industries an annual pollution limit and lets them choose the cheapest way to stay within the limit , including trading pollution credits . From the outset of the program , however , critics argued that the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the California Air Resources Board , the agencies being sued , set pollution limits too high . &quot; They absolutely gave_away the store , &quot; said Jim Jenal of Citizens For A Better Environment .</TEXT>
