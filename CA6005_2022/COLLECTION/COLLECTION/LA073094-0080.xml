   <TEXT> In an oak-paneled parliamentary office once occupied by the country ' s World_War_II prime_minister , surrounded by a well-thumbed library and photos of his family , Lucien Bouchard plots the dismemberment of Canada . It is all very democratic , if sometimes a trifle impolite . Bouchard arrived here in November with the anomalous title of Leader of Her Majesty ' s Loyal Opposition , earned by the startling electoral success of the Quebec separatist party that he founded , the Bloc Quebecois . He intends to leave , perhaps as early as next year , as a citizen of the new nation of Quebec , a fact he reminds Canadians of almost every day . And people here listen , intently , for in Bouchard , Quebec may have found its Thomas_Jefferson -- or Canada its Jefferson Davis . Bouchard , 56 , is the most compelling presence in Canadian politics today -- and perhaps since the flowering of Pierre Elliott Trudeau ( to whom he is diametrically opposed , politically ) . Charismatic , passionate , eloquent , possessed of a thoughtful intensity and married to a French-American wife who grew_up in Orange County , Bouchard is by every measure the most popular politician in Quebec . While Quebec independence is far from assured , the prospect of an acrimonious breakup of America ' s northern neighbor and largest economic partner has unnerved financial markets and pushed_aside almost everything else on the Canadian national agenda , and Bouchard is largely responsible . Bouchard portrays himself as a sort of Quebecois Everyman , whose political journey mirrors the centuries-old struggle of his predominantly French-speaking province to come_to terms with its place in North_America . His story , he says , is one of &quot; an unfinished country. &quot; The next few months will show whether Bouchard and his colleagues can complete the task . A Quebec provincial election is scheduled for Sept . 12 . If the Parti Quebecois , Bouchard ' s separatist ally in the province , wins , a provincial referendum on independence is promised within 10 months . History , and the polls , seem to stand against the separatists . But Bouchard , with typical self-confidence , believes that actually works in his favor . &quot; One of my hypotheses is they don ' t take Quebec seriously , &quot; he says of his opposition . &quot; They think that Quebeckers at the last moment . . . will shy away . And until now , they ' ve been right . . . . I ' m in the business of proving that they are wrong. &quot; Bouchard is seen in the province as that rare politician who has staked everything -- career , fortune , honor -- on a single ideal . &quot; Lucien is not a political animal . I see him as a type of missionary , &quot; says Jean Lapierre , a Montreal lawyer who served in Parliament with Bouchard and now hosts a radio talk_show . Others denounce Bouchard as an opportunist , a hypocrite and a turncoat . His onetime best_friends , who brought him into politics and helped raise him to prominence , believe he betrayed them and Canada in a most calculated fashion . &quot; Anything to do with Bouchard , you have to read the fine print twice , &quot; says Jean Charest , a member_of_Parliament from Sherbrooke , Quebec , and leader of the Progressive Conservative_Party . &quot; People ( in English-speaking Canada ) don ' t much like what they ' re hearing from Bouchard , but he has served the role of lightning_rod . . . . He has forced_out the agenda ( of Quebec ) , &quot; says Philip Resnick , a University of British_Columbia professor and expert on Quebec-Canada relations . For a period this spring , Canada was obsessed with Lucien Bouchard . In Parliament , he jabbed questions at Prime_Minister Jean Chretien while Chretien pretended that no one wanted to hear about Quebec independence . Bouchard ' s public appearances in Toronto , Vancouver and Calgary , ostensibly to promote his autobiography , sparked a cross-country debate on Quebec sovereignty . Lobbying trips to Washington and Paris sent commentators and a_couple_of Western provincial premiers into a rage . After his return from Paris , Parliament spent nearly a full day in an emotional and rancorous debate on &quot; national unity. &quot; One Liberal_Party Parliament member suggested that , in most other countries , a dissident like Bouchard would be in jail . Bouchard has come_to embody the conviction of Quebec separatists -- or sovereigntists as they prefer to be called -- that the best way to preserve the last island of French language and culture in North_America is through independence . The often-troubled relationship of what novelist Hugh MacLennan dubbed Canada ' s &quot; two solitudes &quot; -- one English-speaking and one French-speaking -- last erupted with the failures of the Meech Lake Accord in 1990 and the Charlottetown Agreement in 1992 . These proposed constitutional revisions had intended to codify special status for Quebec in the Canadian federation . A clash over the Meech Lake Accord caused Bouchard to bolt the Progressive Conservative_Party and resign from the Cabinet of then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , his longtime friend and political mentor . Bouchard came_back as an independantiste and brought 54 members of the Bloc Quebecois to Parliament with him . Now , Bouchard sees his mission as preparing the rest of Canada for the break he believes will follow a referendum in Quebec . Dressed in flawless , double-breasted suits , brushing_aside the comma of hair that persistently drops to his eyebrow , Bouchard goes_about his work with deceptive calm . Today , there are few visible signs_in public of the dreaded temper recalled by longtime Bouchard watchers . Ask if he considers himself a revolutionary , and those eyebrows rise just a bit . &quot; I ' m a very moderate man , &quot; he says . &quot; I came very late to politics and to speaking out about my political beliefs . I practiced law as an Establishment lawyer for 21 years , and no , I ' m not a revolutionary. &quot; Even among those who have known him for years , he remains elusive -- a disciplined , introverted intellectual . Much is made here of the fact that he has twice read all seven volumes of Marcel Proust ' s &quot; Remembrance of Things Past. &quot; He drops into conversation anecdotes about Cincinnatus , the savior of the Roman Republic , and Chateaubriand , the early 19th-Century French writer and statesman . Michael Meighen , a university classmate and now a member of Canada ' s Senate , conjures_up a quintessential Canadian image to explain Bouchard ' s elusiveness : &quot; He paddles his own canoe. &quot; Those close to Bouchard say he saves his gregariousness for family and friends , and that it ' s wrong to see him as a loner . Bouchard himself is not much given to self-examination in public . His 282-page autobiography is a detail-filled recitation of his public life and his private thoughts on public policy , but it reveals little of the inner man . In an interview , he is relaxed and direct , but the fence that he has erected between the public figure and the private man drops only a_couple_of times . The first is when he talks_about his father , who delivered construction materials , first by horse-drawn wagon , then by truck , in the logging region near the Saguenay River in central Quebec , where Bouchard was born . &quot; I learned from my father that life is not easy , &quot; he says . &quot; You have to win everything . You have to win it correctly , the right way . You have to work hard . And I have a sense that you must fight to stay alive , and if you want to rise above average , you have to fight hardest. &quot; The second is his reflection on the seminal event in his political life : his May , 1990 , resignation from Mulroney ' s government . Today , those on both sides of the argument can ' t even agree on the events leading_up to his resignation , much less on his motivation . He declares it was a matter of conscience , that Quebec ' s interests had been sold_out in a compromise on the Meech Lake Accord . Others in the Mulroney government believe Bouchard acted with selfish deliberation -- &quot; a staged stunt , &quot; one put it -- and helped torpedo a historic opportunity for national reconciliation . The break sundered more_than political ties . Mulroney and Bouchard had been close friends for nearly 30 years , since meeting as Laval University law_students . Now they refuse to speak_to each other . Mulroney , battered by the Meech Lake and Charlottetown defeats and pushed into political retirement , declines all interviews . The friendship with Mulroney , was &quot; close , very close , probably too close to be in a government together , &quot; Bouchard says . &quot; I wish our friendship had endured , but I felt , and I still feel , that it was a situation where I had to make a choice . . . . &quot; It ' s been like a divorce , you know , with some ( friends ) staying with me , others staying with him , others trying to be in both camps and having a rough time of it . . . . The complicity of old friends cannot be re-created easily at age 50 . I have met good people , of course , very good people for whom I have much respect and with whom I share a common vision of what the future should be . But I don ' t have many private relationships with new friends . &quot; But my life has changed too . I have a family now . I never had any children before , and I have a new marriage . . . . So I take_care of my family. &quot; Bouchard declines to involve his family in much of his political life , which is just fine with his wife , Audrey . When Parliament sits , she and sons Alexandre , 4 , and Simon , 3 , stay_at home_in Montreal while Bouchard spends the nights from Monday through Thursday at a Holiday Inn in Hull , the Quebec_city just across the river from the Canadian_capital of Ottawa , Ontario . He calls home &quot; at least four or five times a day , &quot; says Audrey Bouchard , who describes him as &quot; the mushiest father I ' ve ever seen , &quot; incapable of disciplining his children . &quot; Politics . . . doesn ' t play a big role in my life . . . , &quot; she said . &quot; I try to go_with him ( to political events ) when I can , especially if it ' s the weekend , because otherwise I would n ' t see him . But I ' m not a very political wife . . . . You know , when this is over , when he leaves politics , I will be just as happy , if not more so. &quot; The fluently bilingual daughter of a French mother and a retired U.S. Navy commander , Audrey Best Bouchard , 33 , was born_on the_French Riviera and grew_up in Los Alamitos , Calif . She met her future husband on a flight between Paris and London in 1987 . He was Canada ' s ambassador to Paris , and she was moving from Orange County to live with her Parisian grandmother and study French . It is the second marriage for both . Audrey Bouchard does not hold Canadian citizenship , and thus can ' t vote for her husband . Breezily independent , she displays the same sort of pragmatism about the day-to-day demands of political life as does her husband . Neither professes to lose much sleep_over the controversy he stirs_up -- although there is a Royal Canadian Mounted Police bodyguard assigned to him -- and both decline to speculate publicly on his political future beyond a Quebec sovereignty referendum . Lucien Bouchard grew_up far from Montreal in a region where , for 100 years or more , French-speaking Canadians felled trees and cut logs for absentee , English-speaking mill owners . He is part of a breakthrough generation of French-Canadians who transformed Quebec from a rural society -- dominated by the Roman_Catholic_Church and an English-speaking elite -- into a modern industrial state where French has become the prevailing language in fact and in law . Educated at Catholic_schools , Bouchard became the first in his family to attend a university . His classmates at Laval University in Quebec_City included an extraordinary sampling of Canada ' s future political leadership . &quot; He was obviously one of the better students , if not the best . . . and I suspect there were some of us who drank more beer and chased more girls than Lucien , &quot; classmate Meighen says . &quot; He has a great laugh and is fun to be with , but . . . you know , most people don ' t spend their nights relaxing with Proust. &quot; At Laval , Bouchard developed a friendship with an exuberant Quebecker named Brian Mulroney . A few years later , when both men were lawyers , Mulroney was appointed to a special commission to investigate corruption in Quebec ' s construction unions . He selected Bouchard as chief counsel . The commission ' s findings were sensational , and Mulroney was launched on the political career that in 1984 made him prime_minister . He took Bouchard along with him , first as speech writer and adviser , then as ambassador to Paris , and finally as a member_of_Parliament and a Cabinet_minister . It was an extraordinary rise and led to complaints of cronyism . Then came the break . Bouchard ' s political permutations -- he has been , successively , a Trudeau Liberal , a Quebec separatist , a Mulroney Conservative , then a separatist again -- are cited as evidence of his opportunism . But the case also can be made that he is the perfect reflection of Quebeckers ' ambivalence about their future -- the tug of war over whether the_French language and Quebec ' s unique culture can be_best preserved within Canada or in a bold strike for independence . Bouchard says his first romance with separatism ended with the 1980 defeat , by a margin of 60 % to 40 % , of Quebec ' s first and so far only referendum on independence . It revived when the Meech Lake disillusionment dashed hopes of future reconciliation with the rest of Canada . Jean-Marc Leger , a leading Quebec pollster , attributes Bouchard ' s popularity to his &quot; down home &quot; background and his appeal_to high principle . Or as talk_show host Lapierre , an admitted cynic , puts it , &quot; It takes two things to succeed in Quebec politics : an image of competence and a sense of indignation . He ' s got a 150 % mark on indignation. &quot; In fact , Bouchard ' s speeches on Quebec &quot; honor &quot; and his lamentations of the &quot; humiliations &quot; heaped on his province cause his critics ' eyes to roll . How can Quebec be so oppressed when three of Canada ' s last five prime_ministers -- Trudeau , Mulroney and Chretien -- came from the province , they ask . And how about the fact that Quebec receives more in federal_government payouts than it contributes in taxes ? &quot; Ideologues have a tremendous capacity to adjust reality to their ideology , and he will do that consistently , &quot; Charest says . To Bouchard , none of this changes his fundamental point . &quot; The main thing is , Quebeckers feel quite different from the rest of Canada , &quot; he says . &quot; They have a sense that they are a_people by themselves and they would be much better_off if they could make their own decisions when it comes_to collective affairs . . . . It would be an open state , a modern state with economic exchange with as_many partners as possible. &quot; Bouchard even talks_of an independent Quebec continuing to use Canadian currency -- at least for a limited period -- perhaps relying_on the Canadian military for national defense and leaping directly into the North_American Free_Trade Agreement as a new equal partner . Such sentiments strike others as naive , or duplicitously aimed at reassuring nervous Quebeckers that independence would be an easy path . No one can predict how the rest of Canada would react to a referendum vote_in Quebec calling_for independence , but a growing number of voices suggest the response would not be amicable . &quot; I still don ' t think French_Canadians -- and Lucien is typical in this instance -- know the rest of Canada , &quot; says Meighen . &quot; He doesn ' t appreciate the disappointment and inevitable anger that I and most English Canadians would feel if Quebec voted to separate . This is my country too and I have something to say about its future. &quot; Bouchard -- who says , &quot; I know a lot more about English Canadians than most English Canadians know of Quebec &quot; -- acknowledges a separatist vote would provoke &quot; strong emotions , &quot; but he refuses to entertain the thought that Canada would do anything other_than accept a democratic ballot and let Quebec go . In any event , the road to a referendum must be paved with a victory by the Parti Quebecois , led not by Bouchard but by the decidedly less popular Jacques Parizeau , 63 . As Parti Quebecois candidate for premier , Parizeau will be campaigning on television every night , while Bouchard works the small_towns and back roads . &quot; I compare it to a police motorcycle . Parizeau is driving , and Lucien is in the sidecar , &quot; Lapierre says . Bouchard publicly professes enthusiasm for this role as Parizeau ' s helpmate , but he can ' t suppress a smile when reminded of their relative popularity . Regardless of Parizeau ' s personal standing , voter surveys consistently show the Parti Quebecois comfortably leading the governing Liberal_Party . &quot; People want change , and the only other party ( on the ballot ) is the PQ , &quot; pollster Leger says . Those polls , however , show much more uncertainty among Quebeckers toward independence . Some suggest Bouchard has stiffened the opposition with his sovereigntist roadshow . Even Bouchard ' s youngest brother , Gerard , 51 , a professor at the University of Quebec in Chicoutimi , has doubts . &quot; We do not look_like a society on the verge of declaring sovereignty , &quot; he says . &quot; Are we going_to threaten this lifestyle for a political idea that may be desirable but not necessary ? &quot; But Lucien Bouchard remains optimistic . &quot; I ' m not sure a referendum will be won , &quot; he said . &quot; But I know that the objective conditions are in place now for a victory of the sovereigntists . The rest will be for us . If we do our work properly . . . then we have a fair chance to win. &quot;</TEXT>
