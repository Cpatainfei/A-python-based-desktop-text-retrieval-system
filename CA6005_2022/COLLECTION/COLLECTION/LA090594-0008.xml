   <HEADLINE> LOCAL JEWISH VETERANS LAUNCH A NEW GROUP ; THOUSAND OAKS : A CEREMONY AT TEMPLE ETZ CHAIM MARKS CREATION OF CONEJO VALLEY CHAPTER . ITS GOAL IS TO OFFER SERVICES AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It felt_like a punch to the gut . Members of a new Thousand Oaks group for Jewish war veterans groaned as one of them recited a comment that political columnist Patrick Buchanan made just before the Persian_Gulf_War . While some American Jews are beating the drums of war , Buchanan had said , the Americans who would die in such a war were &quot; kids with names like McAllister , Murphy , Gonzalez and Leroy Brown. &quot; &quot; It kills me , &quot; said Thousand Oaks resident Milt Piller , who served in the Army during World_War_II . &quot; But I actually believe there are people out there who think that Jews did not volunteer for the service. &quot; Hoping to bring attention to the thousands of Jews who fought and died in American uniforms , Piller and 25 other Thousand Oaks residents recently unfurled the banner of the Jewish War Veterans for the first time in Thousand Oaks . After a ceremony at Temple Etz Chaim , members of the new Conejo Valley chapter of the national nonprofit group , said they were hoping their troop could offer services to local veterans and sponsor educational talks for young people . &quot; What we really want to do is impress upon the younger generations that we did fight for our country , &quot; said Larry Golland , the group ' s program director . Golland said the troop will visit local schools and attend special educational events to pass along that message . And , he hopes to join the existing Jewish War Veterans post in Ventura at special activities such_as last month ' s Stand Down , an annual event to provide services for homeless veterans . The Ventura chapter , which was formed last year and is one of 600 nationwide , headed the clothing committee at Stand Down 1994 . Bill Schmidt , the commander of the Ventura post , said his group plans to visit hospitalized veterans in Santa Barbara or Los Angeles . Group members in the Conejo Valley said they too will pay hospital visits to local veterans , and they plan to begin raising funds for the families of veterans who have died . The post will also contribute money to the 100 # 000-member national organization , which lobbies Congress on behalf of veterans ' interests and runs a Jewish veterans ' museum in Washington , D.C. Since its inception in 1896 , the group has focused_on memorializing Jews who served in the U.S. military . Jewish War Veterans was founded &quot; as a direct result of slander and insinuations that Jews had not participated in the ( Civil War ) , &quot; according to a written history provided to its members . Among the goals listed in the group ' s constitution : &quot; To preserve the memories and records of patriotic service performed by the men and women of our faith. &quot; To that end , the national group has gathered statistics and historical information about Jewish involvement in the nation ' s wars . Figures released by the group indicate that more_than 51 # 000 Jews were listed as casualties in World_War_II and 11 # 000 died in the conflicts in Europe and the Pacific . Having that information is particularly important , Golland said , because as time passes , memories of war begin to fade . &quot; The war was 50 years ago , and a lot of people now either weren ' t around or don ' t remember what it was like , &quot; Golland said . The memories of the war have dulled , even for those who were there . But as the men stood_in the temple last week talking_about their hopes for the new group , they acknowledged some wounds would never heal . Irving Wasserman , who lost his younger brother in combat , talked_about his first day lining_up before his battalion ' s commanding_officer . &quot; He came_up_to us and said , ' I want you to know all about me . There are three things I hate most in this world . Jews , dogs and ( blacks ) , in that order , ' &quot; Wasserman recalled . &quot; Not surprisingly , I ended_up on permanent latrine duty. &quot; Golland said he can still picture the scene that made his heart drop , as his tank battalion rolled through France on the way to Berlin . He had chosen to ride in a tank because it seemed safe . But as he passed the charred steel skeletons of the battalions that came_before his , he realized he was not safe at all . &quot; My sense of security just disappeared when I saw that , &quot; Golland said . &quot; I had every reason to be frightened. &quot; Piller , who served under Gen . Douglas MacArthur in the Philippines , said he is still haunted by the sight of a Japanese war plane swooping toward his foxhole about 50 feet from the ground . &quot; I remember the plane was so close , I could see the pilot looking_out the window at us as he flew_by , &quot; Piller said . &quot; I said to myself , well , I guess this is it , I ' m going_to die . But he ran_out of ammunition or something because he passed right over us without firing a shot . A few seconds later he was hit and his plane went down. &quot; Every member of the group has a story to tell , a memory that each has been unable to shake . &quot; Subconsciously , &quot; Piller said , &quot; you have certain things in you that you ' re never going_to get rid of. &quot; That is part of the reason he felt that organizing a group of veterans was a good idea . The men , most of whom are in their 70s , share a bond based on their five-decades-old experiences . It is one that will bring the group_a sense of camaraderie , but members acknowledge it also threatens the group ' s future . Two or three members served in Korea and none served in more recent conflicts , Piller said . &quot; We would like to get some younger people in here , but so far we haven ' t had much luck , &quot; Piller said . Members have not yet followed the lead of the national organization , which has started a group called Descendants of Jewish War Veterans . &quot; It may be something we want to look_into in the future , &quot; Piller said . &quot; After all , the whole point of this group is to keep the memories alive. &quot;</TEXT>
