   <HEADLINE> THE LAB : AN EXPERIMENT IN RETAIL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Picture this : stripped , wrought-iron patio furniture draped with tapestry fabrics and arranged over a large , worn Oriental rug , not in an enclosed space but al fresco . Cast-off junk , such_as a yard-long ceramic fish , carefully exhibited as art . A few feet away , free-standing pillars support a gilded Madonna statuette and a vase of fresh flowers . From deliberate cracks in the cement floor , stiff green reeds sprout , their base covered with gray pebbles . When not in_use , a battered guitar leans_on a stand , and nearby sits a pool_table wrapped decoratively in yellow_metals . Young transient inhabitants come_to this former factory and warehouse to hang_out or peruse the alternative press publications . They listen to jazz , blues or alternative music ensembles that frequently perform on a stage next to a space known as the Gallery , where local designers show their wares on consignment . Soon they will be able to screen premieres of music videos and watch foreign and art films . There are already classes in beading jewelry and events scheduled to meet cult artists such_as pin-up illustrator Olivia . Incidentally , these visitors also come here to shop . Welcome to the Lab , a 40 # 000-square-foot experiment in retail , custom-tailored for the ' 90s and targeted at that most discussed , disdained and discredited group of the decade , lumped tidily as Generation X . Anchoring the shopping_center are Urban Outfitters , a chain that emphasizes comfort with cool ; Na Na , the terminally hip retail end of a company built_on once being the largest distributor of Dr. Marten footwear , and Tower Records Alternative , devoted to new music as long as it ' s not classical -- rock or otherwise . The Lab is embraced as a one-stop source by funky Orange County youth who have eschewed mainstream dress , music and living and who have either had to zigzag the area to boutiques selling unconventional and pre-trendy fashions or travel north to strips such_as Los Angeles ' La Brea Avenue or Santa Monica ' s Third Street Promenade , which features both an Urban Outfitters and Na Na . In the midst of its two-month-long grand opening , with a store or two set to open every week , the Lab is designed to be everything a traditional mall is not , according to founder Shaheen Sadeghi . &quot; Malls are homes to corporate America ; they ' re very much homogenized , &quot; says Sadeghi , who has dubbed his innovative concept , in the shadow of mecca mall South Coast Plaza , an &quot; anti-mall. &quot; The term fits the anti-Establishment , nonconformist attitude of many teens and 20somethings who , facing uncertain times full of economic and environmental troubles , believe they have inherited a Pandora ' s box chock full of previous generations ' waste . &quot; Our approach to our customer is apropos to the times . We don ' t try to dazzle , &quot; Sadeghi says . &quot; Malls don ' t like people to hang_out . We do . The mall works with national brands ; we don ' t necessarily . I don ' t want to bum the malls out , but anybody that ' s young and hip doesn ' t want to go_to a mall . Once you do , you lose your cool. &quot; Sadeghi , 39 , is familiar_with youth culture : Before beginning the project 14 months ago , he served a year as president of surf wear giant Quiksilver , preceded by five years as executive_vice_president at Gotcha . &quot; The whole idea is that this is not a perfect world , &quot; he continues . &quot; People like ( the Lab ) because it ' s not perfect. &quot; If the Lab is imperfect , it is by general standards in appearance , especially so near to planned cookie-cutter communities like Irvine . The former factory has been gutted , carved , acid-washed and transformed into post-apocalyptic remains that house 15 store spaces , ranging from Urban Outfitters ' 12 # 000 square_feet to the Collector ' s Library , a crammed comic_book source , at 256 square_feet . Beams and pipes are exposed inside and outside stores , as are the structural metal tubes that once ran_through a concrete wall . A few solid chunks remain as a reminder . Much of the wood and metal scraps that cover the walls were found in salvage yards . The use of these &quot; poor elements &quot; within an existing structure fits the recycling mode so advocated by the Lab ' s target market , says Lab architect Ron Pompeii of New York-based Pompeii A.D. &quot; Rather than create a synthetic bubble where everyone is pulled_in and air-conditioned and treated to Muzak , we cut_into an existing structure , revealing what ' s there instead of covering it with some_other kind of material , &quot; he says . It was Pompeii ' s application of this naked , utilitarian architectural philosophy to several of Urban Outfitters ' 15 stores that prompted Sadeghi to hire the designer for the Lab . &quot; What we ' re trying to represent architecturally with the Lab is a state_of_mind : one of discovery , experimentation , one of looking_for an identity , &quot; Pompeii adds . &quot; We ' re not trying to build , but expose something with all its imperfections in a very raw , unadorned fashion . It ' s a lot less pretentious , but more direct , honest. &quot; * The surrounding landscaping doesn ' t grow grass or bushes that are perfectly manicured , but a vegetable_garden . A walkway features Day of the Dead-inspired ofrendas , or altars that seem to pay homage to the soul of Andy Warhol : flavored with current pop-art fare such_as mutant dolls , faded letter blocks , hammered aluminum cans and the images of the_Virgin of Guadalupe . Dried oak leaves are stapled to the wall around the altars . On the opposite wall , found lumber , dried flowers and clunky shoes have been artfully nailed . Following the anti-mall theme , Sadeghi invited retailers that avoid malls , like Na Na . &quot; This is the only one that ' s in any kind of ' mall , ' &quot; says Na Na co-owner Lynn Tyler , &quot; and this isn ' t a traditional mall , anyway. &quot; Although Orange County has ranked among Na Na ' s better markets , selling wholesale to boutiques like Sunline Electric_Chair in Huntington Beach , Tyler says they never considered opening a store here until they were approached about the Lab . The 1 # 000-square-foot shop sells footwear , accessories and work wear under Na Na ' s signature labels , including Utility , Na Na Industrial Strength and Blue Plate . As for the center itself , Tyler speculates that it will &quot; become a real attraction , &quot; even for shoppers living outside the county . * Initially , the Lab considered a bazaar-like environ where up-and-coming local designers could set_up shop , much like London ' s Hyper Hyper , which supports new English designers . That , however , was nixed , says Sadeghi , because &quot; you just can ' t shove 50 new people without prior retail experience into a space. &quot; Instead , he cites Urban Outfitters as an outlet for fledgling labels . Already , home-grown companies such_as Split , Soul , 26 Red , Spot Girl , Fusion and Sjobeck hang alongside the Philadelphia-based company ' s own lines -- Urban Outfitters , Free_People , Co-operative and Renewal . And some local designers have settled into a home of_their_own at the Lab . Newport Beach ' s Modern Amusement will sell its hip , retro-style kid ' s clothes when it opens it log-cabin designed store Feb . 1 . In the spirit of recycling , much of the store is being constructed with discarded wood ; the counter is being made from pieces from the old Laguna Beach boardwalk . * For co-owner Jeff Yokoyama , the decision to go_to the Lab had to do with reaching &quot; a particular clientele , &quot; he says . &quot; We figured we would get lost in other centers. &quot; Jewelry designer Spencer Brown sought to avoid &quot; the general public &quot; by opening his Spencer Collection / the Bead Co . at the Lab . The Belmont Shore artist sells some of his 600-piece line as well as thousands of beads of glass , shells , ceramic , semiprecious stones and other materials . For Brown , the Lab store will aid in determining what designs will later be sold through his wholesale business . &quot; A lot about jewelry is testing , and I need a group that is willing to experiment. &quot; Hyper Hyper ' s spirit has not been completely abandoned with the Gallery , a consignment showcase that will rotate local designers ' wares monthly . The courtyard ' s weathered furniture is for_sale by Bungalow , which has a conventional sister store in Laguna Beach . And , not to be left_out , there is a Lab store that sells signature Tees , pullovers , hats and other basics dyed in muted colors . If that ' s not enough for the young bohemians who will frequent the center , among the businesses set to open soon are Taxi Taxi , a vintage clothing_store , a hair salon and two restaurants , in addition to a coffeehouse named the Gypsy Den . &quot; We wanted to mix together all_the things important to this generation , &quot; Sadeghi says . Like teens and twentiers who shun labels , Sadeghi emphasizes that the Lab should not be restricted only as a source for grunge , punk or other branches deemed alternative . &quot; This place is not some teen-age hangout . The stores are not about grunge . But this is about more_than shopping . It ' s quite the opposite of a strip center ; you don ' t pop_in and leave . It is a place where culture can be nourished. &quot; The Lab , 2930 Bristol St. , Costa Mesa . For general information , call ( 714 ) 497-9899 .</TEXT>
