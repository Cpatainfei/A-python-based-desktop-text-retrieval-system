   <HEADLINE> THE GOOD DOCTOR WIELDS A BIG BAT ; SOFTBALL STAR DOT RICHARDSON STILL IS IN THE HUNT TO BECOME A SURGEON AND AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL_WINNER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dot Richardson retire from softball ? For anybody who knows her , it ' s hard enough imagining Richardson ever being tired , let alone re -tired . &quot; This young_lady has energy beyond my capacity to understand , &quot; said Dr. Francis Schiller , the associate director of the Los Angeles County-USC Medical_Center ' s orthopedic residency program , in which Richardson is a second-year resident . &quot; You have to meet her to see . I don ' t know how to describe it other_than she bubbles . She has energy , both mentally and physically , that is_well beyond the high average. &quot; But , truth is , Richardson , who is considered one of the best women softball players in the world and probably will start at shortstop when the U.S. team plays in the 1996 Olympics , was ready to retire not long ago . She was hip deep into her career as a doctor and facing 36-hour rotations in her chosen field , orthopedic surgery . &quot; I was prepared to not play any longer , &quot; Richardson said . &quot; In fact , when I was in medical_school , I was thinking , ' This is it. ' I ' d been to the Pan American Games -- softball wasn ' t in the Olympics -- been all_over the world playing softball , and I was prepared . ' OK , I ' ve gone the farthest I could go. &quot; What changed her mind ? First , the International Olympic Committee made softball , which it had kicked_out of the Barcelona Games as a demonstration sport , a full-fledged medal sport for the first time in the 1996 Olympics . Then , when she was interviewing for an orthopedic residency , she let it be known that she hoped to pursue the Olympic dream if it was OK with the hospital . &quot; I found_out for_sure that they had accepted softball as a medal sport a week before I turned_in my residency match list , &quot; Richardson said . &quot; When I was turning it in , I was like , ' Well , I ' m going_to have to give_up this dream . I don ' t know if I ' m going_to be able to do it. ' &quot; ( During the interview process ) I told them I am willing to not go_to the Olympics if it means losing my position , but I ' m hoping that you realize how important it is to achieve my dream for an Olympic gold medal . And if you would like an Olympian for your residency program , I ' d be more_than willing to be that person . &quot; And they have been very supportive so far . I would have to say that everyone I ' ve worked with , I can ' t praise enough. &quot; Since then , Richardson has been shuttling frantically between her medical career , which demands 80-100 hours a week , and her other career . Richardson , a former UCLA standout , also happens to be the leading candidate to bat leadoff and play shortstop for the U.S. team . &quot; Things have just been falling_into_place , &quot; Richardson said . &quot; It ' s been tough , very tough . I ' ve been super tired at times , jumping_on jets and flying across the country on weekends during medical_school , sometimes during rotations here . . . &quot; But to do this , you ' re pretty committed . I feel I ' m pretty committed to both medicine and softball . I don ' t know if you can understand , it ' s not just playing in a game now . It ' s demonstrating to the world how good softball can be , played by top players . that ' s something special. &quot; Schiller says that , although the medical_center wasn ' t originally aware of how high a_level Richardson had reached athletically , the hospital encourages its residents to be_well rounded , even though it knows the rigors of the resident program can be wearying to anybody . &quot; If she can do_it and if we can work_out the schedule , we ' re very supportive of it , &quot; Schiller said . &quot; And her fellow residents have been very supportive of this . &quot; It doesn ' t seem to bog her down at all . She just goes and goes. &quot; Schiller said he considers Richardson a prime candidate to move_on to a one-year fellowship in orthopedic surgery after her five-year residency program is completed . &quot; I ' m amazed she can do_it , &quot; said John Kumar , a senior orthopedic resident . &quot; I mean , the difficulty of putting_in 80-100 hours a week , trying to balance the rest of the schedule , then go_home and try to read and learn about surgeries she ' s trying to do , as well as put_in the time she needs to be an athlete . . . &quot; I have a hard_time dealing with what I need to do and I am nowhere near as involved in athletics. &quot; Richardson , who has begun assisting in surgery , manages her time -- and her vacation schedule -- with long foresight and sharp precision . For instance , to get the time_off required to play in the Atlanta Games , Richardson has to plan her vacation schedules for the next four years . &quot; I believe there is a way , &quot; she said . &quot; I may be able to take one of my vacations for ' 97 and move it down and take my vacation in ' 95 and move it to the end of the year . &quot; This way I can take vacation time for May , June and July of ' 96 , which I believe is the requirement for the Olympic team. &quot; When Richardson , who has been to three World Championship tournaments and three Pan American Games , has to take_time_off to play in various tournaments , she has to make_sure her shift is covered by another resident . On returning , Richardson owes time not only to the other resident , but to the residency program , in which participants must spend specific amounts_of_time in various areas . Leave for one week , work two weeks to make_up . Why do all this ? &quot; Throughout my career , people have been telling me I was in the wrong sport , ' Your sport will never be accepted in the Olympics , ' &quot; Richardson said . &quot; And finally , when I was willing to say goodby , whammo ! It ' s just sitting there for me if I can just hang_on a little longer . &quot; I love the level of competition that it ' s at when it reaches the Olympic level and that is the way I ' d love to go_out -- with an Olympic gold medal . &quot; would n ' t that be awesome ? I get chills just thinking_about it . It just seems so close now. &quot; She recently led the U.S. team to its third gold medal in the World Championships at Newfoundland , Canada , leading the team with a . 394 batting_average . She also has been chosen for the 1995 U.S , team for the Pan Am Games next March in Argentina , and might be the only woman ever to have a signature-model bat endorsement . Richardson was 13 when she began playing women ' s major softball , the youngest_person ever to play in that league . Back then , playing for the United States in an Olympics was a distant dream . &quot; When I was playing then , in 1975 , they talked_about it getting_into the Olympics , but it never happened , &quot; Richardson said . &quot; that ' s why I had to keep pursuing an education . Softball helped pay_for UCLA undergrad and everything else . &quot; I felt_like I loved working with people , with anatomy , so everything directed me to being a physician . I just kept pursuing it. &quot; And pursuing softball . &quot; I just met ( an acquaintance ) in radiology and she recognized me from UCLA undergrad , &quot; Richardson said . &quot; She ' s asking me , ' Are you still playing ? ' She had to give it up . Her coach gave her an ultimatum -- either quit the team or medicine . &quot; I ' m very fortunate I never had that ultimatum . I ' ve just never been faced with that , knock_on wood . Most people realize how important it is , and how close I am , to achieving that dream. &quot;</TEXT>
