   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; ANALYSIS ; U.S. MADE ITS POINT , IT WASN ' T CONVINCING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Was it a point won or two points lost ? In holding Switzerland to a 1-1 tie at the Silverdome on Saturday , the United States accomplished something it had not done since 1950 -- it earned its first World Cup point . But the_Swiss were supposed to be the team the Americans could beat , especially in the sauna-like atmosphere of the Silverdome , described by Switzerland Coach Roy Hodgson , as &quot; like playing in a hot dog stand. &quot; A victory would have given the U.S. team three points and good chance to advance to the next round from a group that includes Romania and Colombia . Romania took the lead in the group with a 3-1 victory over Colombia . Instead , both teams walked away with a share of the spoils after a game that featured two excellent goals scored on free_kicks and a lot of hard work by both sides but little else . Hodgson said the postgame atmosphere in the_Swiss locker_room was anything but upbeat . &quot; It ' s like a morgue in there , &quot; he said . &quot; People are very disappointed because we thought we played quite well . We passed the ball well . We thought we did enough to win the game . The atmosphere in the dressing room is more like after a defeat than after a point won. &quot; There was much the same feeling among the American players . &quot; It was a very lackluster performance , really , &quot; midfielder John Harkes said . &quot; The main thing is , we know we can play better . We ' ve got_to lift our spirits . Coming_away with a point is a lot better than coming_away empty-handed. &quot; Especially considering how much the_Swiss dominated play , particularly in the second_half when it was all_the U.S. defense could do to hold them at_bay . Marcelo Balboa and Alexi Lalas , the two central defenders , threw themselves at everything that came their way . Left back Paul Caligiuri seldom made a wrong move . On the right , Cle Kooiman appeared a lot less comfortable and time and again was forced to hoof the ball aimlessly out of bounds under pressure from the ever-dangerous Alain Sutter . But the defense held . Had it not been for Thomas Dooley ' s ill-timed tackle that led to the first-half goal by Swiss midfielder Georges Bregy , goalkeeper Tony Meola might have had a shutout . He deserved one . Meola played a solid game and did_well to handle the numerous crosses that came flying in from the wings . It was there , Hodgson acknowledged , that the_Swiss broke_down . &quot; We didn ' t do enough with our crosses , &quot; he said . &quot; We got the ball wide like we wanted to do and got the movements going_in the wide positions quite well , but the quality of the final ball in ( to the center ) wasn ' t good_enough . &quot; Also , we didn ' t take our chances . There were two very good chances which we didn ' t take , and at this level of football if you don ' t take your chances you don ' t win the games. &quot; Bregy , 36 , certainly took his chance , firing home a free_kick that flew past the wall and left Meola rooted to the ground . Wynalda ' s strike on a free_kick from a similar position was perfectly placed , finding the angle of the crossbar and goal post beyond goalkeeper Marco Pascolo ' s reach . Wynalda ' s emphatic goal erased the stigma of 1990 , when he was red-carded in the opening game . But the Americans did not capitalize on the momentum when they came_out for the second_half . Instead , it was the_Swiss who mounted attack after attack , only to see their offense foiled by the U.S. defense , Meola or poor finishing . Coach Bora Milutinovic ' s team relied_on counterattacks , but those became more infrequent as the match wore_on . Harkes , for one , was unhappy with the way the U.S. midfield -- with the exception of himself and Tab Ramos -- consistently refused to move forward on offense . The result , he said , was to give Switzerland the upper_hand . &quot; We invited the pressure on top of us , &quot; Harkes said . &quot; We didn ' t really get_at them , and when we did_it was only with one or two players attacking five at the back and it made_it very difficult to score. &quot; Hodgson , meanwhile , was taking a better view of the tie than his players . Switzerland last took_part in the World Cup in 1966 , when it was knocked_out in the first round . &quot; I ' m taking the chance ( to enjoy it ) while it ' s here , &quot; Hodgson said . &quot; It took us 30 years ( actually 28 ) to reach this World Cup , it might take us another 30 years to get_to the next one and I ' ll be long gone . So I ' m going_to enjoy it . &quot; I think that we gave a good account of ourselves , a good account of Swiss football , and that ' s very important for me. &quot; The Americans are showing they can play the game . But there still are those who wonder what might have been . &quot; I was a bit frustrated , &quot; Harkes said , &quot; because I think Switzerland was there for the taking . I would have liked to have gotten three points from the first game . But they ' re probably happy with the point , as we are. &quot; After 44 years without one , the United States should look_on this as a point well-taken .</TEXT>
