   <HEADLINE> 2 BOYS PLAYING WITH CIGARETTE_LIGHTER ADMIT STARTING BLAZE ; LEONA VALLEY : NEIGHBORS CREDIT FIREFIGHTERS AND EACH OTHER WITH LIMITING DAMAGE TO CLOSE-KNIT COMMUNITY . ABOUT 500 ACRES BURNED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two boys playing with a cigarette lighter admitted that they accidentally touched_off a Leona Valley brush_fire that charred about 500 acres and caused an estimated $ 1 million in damage , investigators said Tuesday . The fire destroyed part of one house , 10 smaller buildings , 15 vehicles and an ostrich , but neighbors credit firefighters and each other with limiting the damage in this close-knit west Antelope Valley community , known for its horse ranches and cherry orchards . The boys , ages 9 and 10 , were released to their parents after telling sheriff ' s investigators that they had set the fire , which started near Leona Avenue and 107th Street West , Deputy George Ducoulombier said . The boys , whose names were withheld because of their ages , will likely not face prosecution but will be referred for counseling , authorities said . The fire , which ignited Monday afternoon , was still burning in an uninhabited hilly area Tuesday , but firefighters expected to have it fully contained by today . One person was reported injured . Bryce Worthington , 56 , suffered minor burns to his eyes , throat and lungs while using a garden_hose to fend_off flames that were eating_away at his six-bedroom house . On Tuesday morning , Worthington , a general contractor , said he was grateful that his wife and 11 children escaped injury and that generous neighbors had helped save many of the family ' s valuables . Even so , the blaze took a terrible toll , he said . Several of Worthington ' s children were badly shaken by the fire , and it consumed several precious keepsakes . &quot; We lost some paintings that were priceless to us because they were painted by my mother , &quot; Worthington said . &quot; She died in January , so they can ' t be replaced. &quot; The fire also gutted five bedrooms and a glass-enclosed sun_porch . The intense heat caused an aerosol can to explode and fly through a wooden door . Worthington estimated that damage to the structure and the furnishings would surpass $ 200 # 000 . His son , Landon Worthington , 26 , the only one of his children who does not live_in the house , said he rushed to the scene because he knew that his father would not evacuate the home . &quot; He ' s the type who would want to put the fire out himself , &quot; his son said . &quot; It would take a fireman with a gun to get him out of the house. &quot; Worthington himself shrugged_off the danger . &quot; If I hadn ' t stayed , the house would be gone , &quot; he said . A short distance behind Worthington ' s house , David Garcia was tallying his losses . Garcia , along with his wife , Eleanor , and daughter , Kristina , moved from San Diego County a month ago into a mobile_home on the Worthington property . While his wife was registering their daughter for school Monday afternoon , Garcia was napping inside when one of the Worthington children knocked_on the door and urged him to get_out . &quot; When I opened the door , I saw all_the fire on the hillside , &quot; he said . &quot; There were all these rabbits running_away . I just grabbed a_couple_of jewelry boxes and a_couple_of Bibles , then I ran_over to help Mr. Worthington. &quot; The fire destroyed the mobile_home and its contents . The Garcias , who were uninsured , said they lost their furniture , family pictures , birth_certificates and clothing . &quot; Everything of importance was in there , &quot; Eleanor Garcia said . &quot; What we ' re wearing is all we have left. &quot; A Leona Valley feed store owner allowed the family to stay in his trailer Monday night , and American Red_Cross workers were trying to arrange other help for them . Firefighters said far more dwellings would have been lost had Leona Valley residents not been diligent about clearing brush away from their houses . Several residents also credited neighbors with helping to evacuate farm_animals and keeping the fire away from structures . Chuck Crandall , 64 , a retired aerospace_engineer , said he was running an errand Monday afternoon when he spotted smoke coming from the direction of his house . By the time he arrived , Crandall said , his neighbors were evacuating his horses and a minister was hosing_down Crandall ' s barn . &quot; We ' ve got a real good neighborhood system here , &quot; he said . &quot; Everybody helps everybody else. &quot; Crandall said sheriff ' s deputies drove through_with a loudspeaker Monday afternoon , urging him and his neighbors to evacuate . &quot; Nobody paid any attention , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s just a real strong sense of pride in our community . We ' re going to save ourselves if we can. &quot; Down the road from Crandall , Dick White , who owns the 120-acre Rancho Buena Vista with his wife , Valerie , was afraid that history would repeat itself . The Whites lost their previous house to a brush_fire that raced through Leona Valley in 1986 . But except for a_few scorched fences , White had no property damage .</TEXT>
