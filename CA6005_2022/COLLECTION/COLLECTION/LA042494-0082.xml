   <HEADLINE> SANTA MONICA ADOPTS QUAKE REBUILDING PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The Way We Were &quot; would make a fitting theme_song for the Santa Monica City_Council earthquake rebuilding program . The final plan , adopted by the council last week , places a premium on returning the city to the way it was before the earthquake -- warts and all . It allows commercial and single-family structures to be rebuilt to their original form and allows apartment_houses to be 15 % larger to encourage rebuilding . The plan also mandates that a portion of units in rebuilt buildings contain affordable housing . But the plan does not address one of the most prominent &quot; warts &quot; that existed before Jan . 17 : lack of parking in areas with multifamily housing , especially north of Wilshire Boulevard , an area heavily hit by the quake . Half of the apartment_buildings damaged in the quake were constructed before 1937 , when the city had no parking requirements , according to a city staff report . Moreover , about 90 % were built with less parking than would be required under today ' s standards . The council , however , decided not to require additional parking than was already in place when the temblor hit , reasoning that to do so would thwart rebuilding because of added costs . On this point , the real_estate interests and the council agreed . Where they parted company , however , was_on the rebuilding requirements and the amount of affordable housing that will be required for buildings that need reconstruction . The council ' s rebuilding laws require one-fourth of the units to be set_aside for low- and moderate-income families as part of the city ' s philosophy to provide affordable housing . &quot; The City_Council , relying_on a ludicrous financial analysis , imposed a 25 % low-income ( unit ) requirement on reconstruction that will be impossible for landlords to meet , &quot; said attorney Rosario Perry . &quot; What will happen is that the buildings most severely damaged will stay that way for years to come. &quot; The result , Perry said , is that &quot; tenants who could live_in Santa Monica will have to live elsewhere until the City_Council wakes up. &quot; Attorney Chris Harding , who has represented the Los Angeles Apartment Owners Assn . while the rebuilding plan was being devised , agreed that the plan is well-meaning , though shortsighted in part because of its inflexibility . Harding was referring to requirements that limit construction to prior configuration of the buildings , without leeway for individual circumstances . City_Planning Director Suzanne Frick said a measure to allow homeowners to reconfigure their homes , but still qualify for fee waivers , will be_on the council agenda this week . Frick said the formula is the city ' s best effort at balancing the &quot; needs and character of the city with need to reconstruct in a timely fashion . . . . We ' re confident this will work for the majority of properties. &quot; Besides , Frick said , those who must rebuild are getting a lot more latitude than they would have if they came_to propose a new project . that ' s because restrictions on building density have been tightened several times in the past decade . But owners whose buildings took_a_hit in the earthquake can rebuild them the same way as they could in the good old days . &quot; We ' re sacrificing something to get something back , &quot; Frick said .</TEXT>
