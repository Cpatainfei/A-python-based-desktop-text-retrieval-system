   <HEADLINE> JAUNTS ; CONEJO PARK DISTRICT FOLLOWS A ' RING OF GREEN ' TO FUNDING ; THE NEARLY 10-MILE HIKE TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE OUTDOOR PROGRAM OFFERS OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW ALL THE LOS ROBLES TRAIL . IT WILL BE GUIDED BY NATURALISTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' ve hiked only chunks of the long , meandering Los Robles Trail in Thousand Oaks , here ' s a chance to trek it from one end to the other . The Outdoor Advisory Council to the Conejo Recreation and Park District is organizing an 9.8-mile mega-hike on the trail Saturday beginning at 9 a.m. at Triunfo Canyon Community Park in the east end of Thousand Oaks . If you ' re the solitary type , take_note : The group is prepared_for a crowd of up_to 200 people signing_on for the special hike . It ' s a fund-raiser for the district ' s outdoor program , so it isn ' t free . The cost is $ 15 . For that , hikers get seven district naturalists to point_out sights along the way , lunch at the end , and a bus ride back to the start . The whole affair will wrap_up by 3 p.m. More_than that , they ' ll get some striking views_as the trail winds its way through Thousands Oaks along the western slope of the Santa Monica Mountains . The hike is called the &quot; Ring of Green , &quot; a reference_to the city ' s hope of one day ringing Thousand Oaks with a system of linking trails . The group will assemble at the west_end of Triunfo Canyon Community Park where the Los Robles trail head is located , near the mouth of the canyon . But it won ' t be a mob scene on the trail . Hikers will divide into groups , each assigned to a naturalist . Some will move along faster than others , but everyone should be finished by 2 p.m. Tagging_along with a naturalist will open your eyes . They point_out sights that most people would overlook , like the yerba_mansa plant the Chumash Indians used for medicinal needs or the tufts of the brown amole plant they used to make soap . Kathy Myers , with the district ' s outdoor unit , calls the route moderate to difficult . The trail is wide and well-groomed , but there are switchbacks . Participants will be supplied with trail maps . As the trail starts_out , it takes you near some oak groves and one magnificently sprawling Valley_Oak . As it climbs , you ' ll find yourself in dusty , brown , chaparral country . But if you look_for them , there are fall bloomers along the trail : the tiny purple daisy-like fleabane and the red California_fuchsia . As you climb , you can look eastward and see the silvery waters of Westlake , and later Lake Sherwood and Hidden Valley . Farther along , you ' ll see the city of Thousand Oaks sprawled below . The halfway marker is approximately at the Moorpark Road trail head , near the Arts Council Center . The route will take you across ground ravaged by the wildfires nearly a year ago . But the area has re-vegetated quickly and evidence of the fires is fast disappearing . The steepest part of the trail is a series of switchbacks up Rasnow Peak that tops out at an elevation of about 1 # 500 feet . From there you can see the ocean , and on a good_day , Anacapa Island . The hike winds_up on West Potrero Road , a half-mile east of Wendy Drive , at the Deer Ridge trail head . There , hikers will take a bus ride back to Triunfo Canyon Community Park and be treated to a tri-tip lunch ( vegetarian fare also available ) .
