   <HEADLINE> IT ' S AN OLD BRAZILIAN CUSTOM ; SOCCER : WHEN YOU BRING_HOME THE WORLD CUP FOR THE FOURTH TIME , YOU ALSO BRING TONS OF DUTY-FREE LUGGAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Brazil ' s government tax chief resigned Thursday in a dispute over the failure of the victorious Brazilian World Cup soccer squad to pay nearly $ 1 million of customs duties on excess luggage brought from the United States . The dispute threatened to spoil the euphoria produced by Brazil ' s fourth World Cup title . Federal Revenue Secretary Osiris Lopes Filho told reporters he was quitting over differences with President Itamar Franco . Lopes said the last straw had been the president ' s decision to overrule his order that 17 tons of luggage brought_back from the United States by the Brazilian soccer delegation should be subject_to normal customs inspection and duties . &quot; One of my objectives as a member of the government was to show that the law could be carried_out in Brazil , &quot; said Lopes , who has spearheaded a government drive against tax_evasion . Brazilian newspapers ran front-page stories Thursday on how the players and soccer federation officials had refused late Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro to allow customs officials to inspect their luggage , which was carried in five trucks to their hotel . The delegation arrived in Rio on the last leg of a marathon three-city homecoming celebration marking the World Cup victory . The team brought_home refrigerators , televisions , videos , washing_machines and microwave_ovens , which customs officials estimated would be subject_to duties of nearly $ 1 million . Some of the merchandise was bought while the team was staying in Orange County . Players , coaches and their wives purchased so_much merchandise during their stay_at the Fullerton Marriott that some of it had to be stored in the hotel ' s ballroom , hotel officials said . Brazilian customs laws require duties on any purchases abroad over the value of $ 500 per person . &quot; The officials , coaches and players are making a bad start to their careers as four-time world champions , &quot; Brazil ' s O Globo newspaper said in a front-page editorial . &quot; They achieved a great feat and deserve the gratitude of their compatriots , but neither one thing nor the other makes them into special citizens , &quot; the newspaper said , adding they should set an example by paying the customs duties . The soccer players had spent nearly an hour late Tuesday arguing heatedly with Rio airport customs officials . The controversy threatened to disrupt an already delayed victory parade through Rio ' s streets until an order came_through from the Presidential Palace in Brasilia , via Economy Minister Rubens Ricupero , to release the luggage uninspected . In the heat of the moment , soccer federation officials and players -- including star forward Romario -- even threatened to boycott the Rio parade and hand back medals they had been awarded by President Franco , Brazilian newspapers said . &quot; The truck is not leaving the airport without my luggage , &quot; O Globo quoted Romario as saying . &quot; We ' re not smugglers . We represented Brazil in front of 2 billion people in the world . If they don ' t release my luggage , I ' m giving_back my medal. &quot; Rio customs chiefs then threatened to prosecute the Brazilian Soccer Confederation for non-payment of the duties . The homecoming itinerary of the victorious World Cup squad had already provoked a controversy by not including Sao Paulo , Brazil ' s biggest city . Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf publicly condemned what he said was a deliberate snub . Local officials said Thursday that the team would visit Sao Paulo on July 29 to receive the city ' s separate homage .</TEXT>
