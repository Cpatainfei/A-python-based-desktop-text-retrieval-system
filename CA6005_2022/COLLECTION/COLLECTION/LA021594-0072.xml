   <TEXT> Little_League baseball . Age-group swimming . Pop Warner football . Toddler gymnastics . Tiny-tot tennis . These are the sports Americans grow_up with . Here in Norway , it ' s skiing . Cross-country_skiing . It ' s the national pastime here . The country ' s most celebrated sports heroes are cross-country skiers Vegard Ulvang and Bjorn Daehlie , triple gold-medalists in the 1992 Winter_Olympics at Albertville , France . In the States , a dedicated but definite minority skis cross-country , and mostly recreationally . So , it ' s small wonder that America ' s best cross-country skier in recent years is a Norwegian . John Aalberg , who left here in 1983 to attend the University of Utah , and became an American citizen in time for the Albertville Games , is enjoying every minute of his return home . &quot; It ' s great to ski through the Norwegian pines again and to eat the food I used to , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m very excited to ski for the U.S. and try to beat some Norwegians. &quot; That doesn ' t figure to happen for the U.S. though , because at 33 , Aalberg is a bit beyond his prime , and because the other Americans have not had the benefit of his Norwegian training . &quot; Norway is the heart of the sport , &quot; Aalberg said . &quot; I started skiing in competition when I was 10 or 11 . Before that , I was with my friends out on skis . Because of all_the attention it gets , the best ( athletic ) talent goes_to cross-country_skiing . &quot; When I started racing , we had individual age_groups and in some of those races we ' d have almost 200 kids in each class . In the States , if you have 200 people in all age_groups , that ' s a big race. &quot; The reason for all_of this ? &quot; It ' s the culture and tradition , something Norwegians have done for many years and maybe it has something to do with the Birkebeiner story. &quot; The story of the Birkebeiners -- it means birch leggers , for the birch-bark leggings worn by the skiers involved -- dates to 1205 , when there was a power struggle for the Norwegian throne . The Birkebeiners were entrusted with getting the crown_prince , 18-month-old Haakon , from Oslo to Trondheim , a long and perilous journey on skis . They did , and Haakon grew_up , was crowned king in 1217 , united the country and reigned until 1263 . &quot; Other_than that , it ' s a good way of staying healthy , &quot; Aalberg said . &quot; It ' s great exercise . And it ' s something that ' s easy to do even when you get older. &quot; Sounds like something Californians could get_into . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
