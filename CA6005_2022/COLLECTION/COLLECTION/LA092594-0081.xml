   <TEXT> Regarding &quot; A Chat With Mr. Mayhem , &quot; by Hilary de Vries ( Sept . 11 ) : How unfortunate it is to read that Quentin Tarantino sees himself as a maker of &quot; great films , &quot; yet he knocks Oliver Stone for attempting to inject some much-needed social resonance into the tired veins of his original script for &quot; Natural Born Killers. &quot; If one cuts_out what Stone contributed to the film , all that ' s left is a droll one-act journey of cult film iconoclasm . Then Tarantino tries to tell us that Americans can ' t tell stories anymore . Stone is a proven storyteller and filmmaker who has his own moral perspective and a genuine point_of_view . His works will be long remembered because of this and the fact that the layers within them have substance , not superficial plot manipulation interwoven with monologues consisting_of pop culture references that the audience is supposed to digest as characterization . Will Tarantino ever write or direct anything as memorable or thought provoking as &quot; Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; Platoon &quot; or &quot; JFK &quot; ? Right now it seems doubtful . Tarantino ' s apparent lack of conviction , lack of anything to say about the human experience , further illustrates a man who is proud to be uneducated , ignorant and apathetic . The stories he tells aren ' t American stories , they ' re movie nerd stories . Tarantino the Storyteller ? No . Tarantino the Regurgitator ? Definitely . JASON ENDRES Fountain Valley * Before I read Hilary de Vries ' interview with him , I had thought Quentin Tarantino a wildly overrated , plagiarizing , misogynistic wimp who somehow got the backing to make the Movie Mommy Didn ' t Want Him to Make . But now I know better . He is also a shallow , self-serving , puffed-up ignoramus who learned about life from a video screen . I finished the piece thinking , &quot; would n ' t it have been cool if a sadistic armed robber had walked into Video Archives years ago and subjected then-clerk Tarantino to a real-life dose of the butchery he has since so callously exploited on his way to the ' forefront of a new generation of filmmakers ' ? &quot; KEN BASH Malibu * How dare you ! You forgot to mention that the 10-minute torture scene is an exact rip-off of the &quot; Singin ' in the Rain &quot; torture scene from &quot; A Clockwork Orange. &quot; Stealing from one source is plagiarism , but stealing from many is research . Tarantino is a great researcher but not an original filmmaker . Who do we hold responsible ? Tarantino or the insecure , frightened I ' m-afraid-to-give-the-green-light Hollywood system ? I think the system ! ROBERT FORD Long_Beach * Since the release of &quot; Reservoir Dogs &quot; in 1992 , virtually every article on the history of the film and how it got made has got_it wrong . The apocryphal story , as repeated by Calendar , goes : &quot; After ( Harvey Keitel ) agreed to star . . . ( Lawrence ) Bender was able to raise the $ 1.5 million . . . . &quot; This is the actual sequence of events : In November , 1990 , Quentin asked me to help get the film made , and I joined him and producer Bender as an equal partner . Richard Gladstein , then at Live Entertainment , agreed to finance the film in January , 1991 , the budget to depend_on the value of the lead actor or actors . Keitel and Christopher Walken both read the script , liked it , and it seemed likely we would be able to make a deal with them . Live submitted a deal memo to us on Feb . 4 , contingent_on the services of both actors or acceptable substitutes . We submitted a list . By the end of April , Keitel was signed , Walken was not . Live agreed to proceed at a reduced budget . In June , I went_with Quentin to the Sundance directors ' lab , where he had a chance to try_out some of his directing ideas . We started production in August . The rest , as they say , is history . I am very proud_of my continuing association with Quentin and Lawrence , and to have been a part of &quot; Reservoir Dogs , &quot; contributing to the emergence of a major American filmmaker . MONTE HELLMAN Blue_Moon Entertainment Los Angeles * Oliver Stone ' s over-picturesque , big-budget epics don ' t compare to Quentin Tarantino and the candid and un-self-promoting flicks he ' s made . To me , the unappreciated films by Tarantino are not an alternative -- they ' re first_class with gold-plated seats . JEREMY ALVAREZ Alhambra</TEXT>
