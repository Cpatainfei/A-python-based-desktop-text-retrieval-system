   <HEADLINE> 5 PALESTINIANS SLAIN AS HEBRON VIOLENCE FLARES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel ' s security_forces Wednesday battled armed Palestinian extremists for more_than 18 hours in a firefight that left at least five Palestinians dead , among them a pregnant woman and four men identified by authorities as the most wanted Islamic fundamentalist fighters in this shellshocked city . During the combat , flares lit the sky , more_than 100 antitank missiles exploded and thousands of rounds of gunfire ripped the neighborhood where the Israeli army attacked and destroyed at least one house . Wednesday ' s battle was half a mile from the Cave of the Patriarchs mosque , the site of the Feb . 25 massacre of about 30 Palestinian worshipers by a Brooklyn-born Jewish settler . Palestinian leaders charged that a second massacre was occurring in Hebron , a city of 125 # 000 Palestinians that was shattered to the core by the murders of a month ago . But a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces -- which have kept the entire city under strict military curfew for 24 days to prevent Palestinian retaliation against the 415 Jewish settlers who live here -- said Israeli soldiers had fought suspected Palestinian extremists who had barricaded themselves in the Hebron house . Gen . Ehud Barak , Israel ' s military chief_of_staff , opened his testimony Wednesday before a judicial commission investigating the mosque massacre with a statement disclosing the firefight , reports of which had been subject_to state censorship . He said the military operation in Hebron began Tuesday , lasted a full 18 hours -- though some reports said it lasted 22 hours -- and resulted in the deaths of four of the most important Islamic fundamentalist resistance fighters in a city known to be a hotbed for armed Palestinian extremism . A spokesman for Barak ' s armed forces said a preliminary check indicated that civilian casualties , among them the pregnant woman , were caused by extremist fire . But Israel Radio -- and other reports -- agreed with Palestinian accounts , asserting that Israeli soldiers accidentally shot and killed the pregnant woman , Hunduk Zahdeh , during the firefight . Palestinian sources here said she was hit by a bullet while watching the clashes from the window of her home . Israeli officials said six soldiers with their security_forces had been lightly injured . Wednesday ' s casualties brought_to more_than 70 the number of Palestinians killed throughout the occupied territories since Baruch Goldstein , an ultranationalist Jewish settler , fired more_than 100 bullets at Muslims praying in a mosque . The new round of violence that tore through Hebron underscored why the city ' s continuing nightmare has thrust it , center stage , into the stalled Middle_East peace process . &quot; A new massacre has taken_place , beginning yesterday , and it is still going_on , &quot; Ahmad Timimi , chairman of the self-proclaimed Hebron Emergency Committee , said at a meeting of the city ' s moderate Palestinian leadership , which occurred at the height of the Hebron battle Wednesday morning . The renewed unrest here -- despite the army crackdown -- compounded a deterioration and despair so intense that the Israeli government apparently has agreed to demands by the Palestine Liberation Organization that Jerusalem negotiate the possibility of an armed , international peacekeeping force in Hebron . The PLO and Israeli officials continued to negotiate that issue and others in Cairo on Wednesday . &quot; In addition to all these massacres that are being committed , I see the town of Hebron is falling_apart -- economically , psychologically and in all aspects of life , &quot; said Timimi , a supporter of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and his attempts to make_peace with Israel . Most Palestinians and Israelis here agree that a continuing source of controversy is the presence of 415 Jewish settlers in the heart of Hebron . Most are ultranationalists who believe that this city , occupied along with the rest of the West_Bank during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War , is an integral part of Israel . They are committed to re-establishing a permanent Israeli presence , which ended in 1929 when 67 Jews were massacred in an Arab uprising . Arafat has demanded in meetings with Israeli negotiators this week that the settlers be moved_out of Hebron before he returns to the bargaining table . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin has said the small settlements in Hebron are non-negotiable and that any decision to evacuate settlers is &quot; a purely Israeli matter. &quot; But in a meeting with his ruling Labor_Party on Wednesday , Rabin appeared to sympathize_with the Palestinians ' deepening plight . &quot; I get information from Hebron , a sensitive place where for 24 days , 100 # 000 to 120 # 000 Palestinians have been under curfew because of 415 Jews , because the consideration right now isn ' t the security of Arabs but the prevention of friction and the place catching_on fire , &quot; he said . The issue of the Hebron settlers is explosive for Israelis , as an emergency session of the Parliament , the Knesset , demonstrated all too well later Wednesday . &quot; Mr. Prime_Minister , whoever tries to uproot the Jews from Hebron will find all_of us there , the masses of the House of Israel , who will defend the Jewish right to live_in Hebron , city of our forefathers , &quot; declared Benjamin Netanyahu , chairman of the opposition right-wing Likud Party , which has supported the settlers and opposed Rabin ' s peace accords with Arafat . Rabin shot back at Netanyahu : &quot; I don ' t accept any of your threats ! You will not gather_in Hebron ! You will gather_in the Knesset ! Decisions about Hebron are made in the Knesset . Don ' t try to frighten us. &quot; Among the Palestinians in Hebron , there was plenty of fear to go_around Wednesday . Reacting to the fiery national and international debate about the Hebron settlers , Aziz Amr , an emergency committee_member , said he and many other moderate Palestinians believe the mosque massacre and the ensuing violence have handed Rabin &quot; a golden opportunity to evacuate the settlers from the heart of the city -- not as part of the PLO negotiations but as a purely Israeli decision to safeguard the security of the Jews. &quot; * ARMY DEFENDED : A general defends Israeli army role in mosque massacre .
