   <HEADLINE> TRADE_DEFICIT UP 22 % IN JULY ; DOW PLUNGES 67 , DOLLAR NEAR ITS LOW ; ECONOMY : SOME ANALYSTS AND THE WHITE_HOUSE DOWNPLAY THE REPORT , BUT OTHERS SAY GROWTH IS THREATENED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. trade_deficit soared in July , the government said Tuesday in a report that pushed the dollar toward its record low against the Japanese yen and triggered a broad slide in_stock prices , with the Dow Jones industrials posting their worst loss in six months . The overall trade imbalance , including goods and services , jumped 22 % from the previous month to $ 11 billion , the Commerce_Department said . The culprit was the second-worst monthly U.S. merchandise deficit on record -- $ 15.7 billion -- which was exceeded only by the record $ 15.9-billion shortfall in December , 1985 , the agency said . U.S. trade_in services showed a $ 4.7-billion surplus in July . Some economists and the Clinton_Administration cautioned against reading too_much bad news into one month ' s report . But other analysts , noting that the U.S. trade_deficit is a chronic problem , said the latest figures do not bode well for continued U.S. economic_growth . Financial markets , already worried about the economy ' s staying power and fading hopes for a U.S.-Japan agreement to fix the trade imbalance , were rattled by the report . The stock_market took the data particularly hard amid fears that the trade_gap will prompt the Federal_Reserve_Board to raise interest_rates yet again later this month to protect the dollar ' s value , analysts said . &quot; There already was a bearish sentiment that was building &quot; in the markets , which the trade report exacerbated , said Charlie Okada , executive_vice_president and currency trading manager at Sanwa Bank in Los Angeles . The dollar was quoted at 97.65 yen in late New York trading , down from 98.53 on Monday and its lowest U.S. close since hitting a post-World War II nadir of 97.50 on July 12 . The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks -- which Thursday climbed to within 50 points of the 4 # 000 level -- plunged 67.63 to 3 # 869.09 , its worst daily decline since losing 72.27 on March 30 . The average ' s slide also triggered the New York Stock_Exchange ' s &quot; circuit_breakers , &quot; or trading restrictions designed to curb the market ' s volatility , late in the session . Losers swamped gainers on the Big Board by nearly 4 to 1 . Bond prices also fell and their yields rose , but the damage wasn ' t nearly as severe as in_stocks . The Treasury ' s bellwether 30-year bond lost less than 0.25 point , or $ 2.50 for every $ 1 # 000 in face_value , and its yield edged_up to 7.77 % from 7.75 % on Monday . Once again , the United States ' biggest trade_gap came_with Japan , a deficit of $ 5.7 billion -- the worst showing since March . The shortfall with Japan came at a sensitive time , because negotiators for both nations are meeting this week in a bid to resolve trade disputes before a Sept . 30 deadline , after which the Clinton_Administration could impose trade sanctions against Japan . Indeed , U.S. exporters used Tuesday ' s report to press Japan to further open its doors to U.S. goods . The July figures &quot; are a clear signal &quot; that Japan &quot; must take action to open its market to imports , &quot; Andrew H . Card , president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn. , a trade group for the Big Three car_makers , said in a statement . Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown said the July report was &quot; not indicative_of the economy ' s long-term trend , &quot; because it included a sharp drop_in exports of U.S. commercial aircraft , whose sales tend to vary widely from month to month , and because July ' s imports reflected oil prices that have since declined . Many economists agree that U.S. trade is suffering because the nation ' s growing economy is lifting Americans ' demand for imports , while many of its major trading partners are still struggling to emerge from recession -- limiting their purchases of U.S. goods and services . The U.S. trade_deficit should be helped in the months ahead as the economies of Japan and Europe grow stronger , analysts said . Josh Feinman , a global markets economist at Bankers Trust New York Corp. , said the July trade figures were &quot; consistent &quot; with other recent reports indicating that the American economic expansion is slowing_down . &quot; The wider trade_deficit does suggest that the international sector is going_to be a drag &quot; on the U.S. economy , Feinman said . That might actually preclude the Federal_Reserve from raising interest_rates , he added . For the first seven months of 1994 , the U.S. trade_deficit is running at an annual rate of $ 145.8 billion . That puts the nation on track to achieve its worst merchandise deficit since a record $ 152.1 billion imbalance in 1987 .
