   <HEADLINE> A DAY OF MOURNING ; MEXICAN AMERICANS SPEAK OF COLOSIO ' S ASSASSINATION WITH EMOTION AND DISBELIEF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton was speaking on the big-screen TV about the horror of political assassinations , about how sorry he was , about the solid relationship between Mexico and the United States that would not change . His words , translated by a newscaster into Spanish , were filtering down to the diners at Diana ' s Mexican Restaurant on a gloomy Thursday afternoon in Huntington Park . This was politics , protocol , part of the controlled ritual of international affairs . To many of Southern California ' s Mexican immigrants , however , the meaning of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio ' s assassination Wednesday was found someplace else , a place often hard to reach with words . At Diana ' s , at the Mexican Consulate where the flags were flying at half-staff , in countless homes , talk mixed with emotion and disbelief . It seemed that a terrible threshold had been crossed , and danger and disillusion lurked on the other side . &quot; About politics I don ' t know a lot , &quot; said roofer Jose Bernal , 26 , a native of Aguascalientes in central Mexico . His eyes rose toward the TV that hung above the upholstered plastic booths in Diana ' s front_room . &quot; But this hurts me , right here , &quot; he said , placing his hand quietly to his chest and then wiping_away tears . His 3-year-old daughter , seated behind a mound of French fries , stared at her father , incomprehension in her eyes . &quot; I ' m always going_to remember this , &quot; Bernal went_on . &quot; He was going_to be president of Mexico ! If this can happen to him , what is going_to happen to Mexico in the future ? Look_at Chiapas , what happened there . What ' s happening to Mexico ? I ' m afraid things are just going_to get worse. &quot; Indeed , the talk at Diana ' s , a popular gathering place for many in the Los Angeles Mexican American community , was of Mexico ' s cycle of misfortune that started with the armed rebellion in southern Chiapas state on New Year ' s Day . That was the last time that talk_of back home seemed to consume people here . Then there was the kidnaping earlier this month of Alfredo Harp Helu , chairman of Mexico ' s largest financial group . He still has not been released . Now Colosio , the candidate of Mexico ' s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , who was virtually assured of becoming the next president , had been fatally shot in the head . Suddenly , it seemed as if modern Mexico has become mired in a deadly fable the_likes_of which Latin_American novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez might write . &quot; It ' s like revolution , Pancho Villa , all_over again , &quot; said Mexico City-born Elsa Rodriguez , the manager of this relaxed restaurant with the giant swordfish over the bar and the huge oil_painting of Diana , the owner ' s daughter , surveying the scene . &quot; Since the first of January , Mexico changed . After ( Wednesday ) , it is going_to change again. &quot; Said Estela Davila , from northern Mexico ' s Chihuahua state , &quot; We all think the same things . We thought that nothing like this could ever happen in Mexico . We are not used to these violent acts in Mexico. &quot; In fact , Mexico ' s past is threaded with violence , but Mexicans point to their history with great pride . There was a nobility to , say , the Mexican revolutionaries of 1910 , glorious warriors who never hesitated to use bloodshed toward an end . But after decades of political stability , the assassination of Colosio seemed the start of a slide into U.S.-style political violence , a savage and unpredictable animal that might never again be caged . Never did the popular Mexican saying , &quot; Poor Mexico -- so far from God and so close to the United States &quot; seem more apt . &quot; It ' s terrible over there , &quot; said Alfred Almada , a retail manager whose relatives hail from Guadalajara and Michoacan . &quot; The government is real corrupt . It ' s dangerous . I won ' t go there anymore . It ' s scary. &quot; Among the more detached observers at Diana ' s were those who feared reactions such_as Almada ' s . Such thinking would be bad for Mexico , they said , and bad for the United States . &quot; From an economic point_of_view , I feel bad , &quot; said Huntington Park City Councilman Raul Perez . &quot; It could cause problems to Mexico . I think there is going_to be a witch hunt ( for scapegoats ) . &quot; But Jessica Maes , adviser to the Huntington Park Chamber_of_Commerce , said she was surprised at all_the news coverage that Colosio ' s death has drawn . &quot; This guy was very popular , &quot; she said of Colosio . &quot; He appealed_to the low-income people . that ' s why everybody is taking it so bad . I ' ve seen people crying here , they ' ve taken it so personally . They had something to believe_in . A lot of people did react more_than I thought . He appealed_to the little people. &quot; Not everybody , however , was shaken by Colosio ' s death . Several said , in_essence , that he had it coming . They saw him as just another cog in a political_system that is essentially corrupt . &quot; It is not justifiable to kill a presidential candidate , &quot; said Louis Almada , the father of Alfred . &quot; But I think it is the government ' s fault because of the way it picks the candidate by el dedazo ( allowing the outgoing president to handpick his successor ) instead of through democracy . So I think that this is a political crime. &quot; Others saw more straightforward criminal conspiracy in the act . Perhaps the narcotraficantes , the drug_traffickers , were behind the assassination , they said . But , mostly , it was sadness that shadowed the faces of those who had Mexico on their minds . &quot; I think he really was the only candidate for Mexico , &quot; said civil_servant Norma Inocencio . &quot; You could tell who he was by the way he talked to people , &quot; added her lunch partner , Manuel Mosqueda , an ironworker . &quot; He related to people , reached_out to them . He was always with the poor . It seemed like he wanted to do something for Mexico. &quot; And that ' s how the talk was going all day . &quot; I was really surprised , too , that even American people are asking about it , talking among themselves , &quot; said Rodriguez , the restaurant manager . &quot; They are concerned for Mexico . I guess this shows that Americans and Mexicans are sticking_together on this. &quot;</TEXT>
