   <HEADLINE> JUDGE CITES ' AMPLE EVIDENCE , ' ORDERS SIMPSON TO STAND TRIAL ; COURT : CRIMINALIST TESTIFIES THAT BLOOD DROP FOUND AT CRIME SCENE MATCHES FORMER ATHLETE ' S TYPE . DEFENSE_ATTORNEY SAYS HE WILL PUSH FOR AN EARLY TRIAL DATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Football great O.J. Simpson must stand trial for the murders of his ex-wife and a friend of hers , a Municipal Court judge ruled Friday , setting the stage for a spectacle that could send the superstar to Death Row . &quot; The court has carefully considered the evidence in this case and the arguments of counsel , &quot; said Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell as a six-day preliminary hearing televised across the nation came_to a close . &quot; The court feels that there is ample evidence to establish the strong suspicion of the guilt of the accused. &quot; Speaking from the bench , Kennedy-Powell directed the somber-faced Simpson , dressed in a dark suit and maroon tie , to stand . She then informed him that &quot; there is sufficient cause to believe this defendant guilty &quot; of the murder_charges against him and ordered him to be arraigned in Superior_Court on July 22 . Until then , he will be held without bail at the Men ' s Central Jail , where he has been locked_up since his arrest last month . When the hearing concluded , family members of Nicole Brown Simpson left arm-in-arm , followed by those of Ronald Lyle Goldman , who also huddled close_together for comfort . Simpson , who turns 47 today , was taken_away in handcuffs . He could come_to trial as early as mid-September . Although declining to comment in detail , Simpson attorney Robert L . Shapiro said he will seek a speedy trial . &quot; We are going_to have the trial in a very short period_of_time , &quot; he said as he ducked into his car to avoid a crush of reporters outside the Criminal_Courts Building in Downtown Los Angeles . &quot; We are going_to start working tonight . We are not going_to waste time. &quot; At a news_conference after the hearing , Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti said his team of prosecutors will be ready to begin in September if Simpson ' s lawyers exercise their right to insist upon a trial within 60 days of his Superior_Court arraignment . In court , Simpson sat impassively as Kennedy-Powell announced her decision , which had been predicted by experienced lawyers but vigorously contested by Simpson ' s high-profile legal team . For the past six days , they subjected prosecution witnesses to intense cross-examination and accused police of illegally searching Simpson ' s home_in the hours after the murders . They lost that effort , and on the hearing ' s final , climactic day , a police scientific analyst testified that a blood drop found at the scene of the crime matched Simpson ' s blood_type in several important respects . That was the first time that physical evidence has been presented in court linking Simpson to the scene of the crime . The analyst , LAPD crime lab supervisor Gregory Matheson , said the blood sample narrows the list of people who possibly could have left that drop to as few as 1 in 200 . A deputy medical_examiner who performed the autopsies in the case followed Matheson to the stand and , using drawings , described in grim detail the many wounds inflicted on Goldman and Nicole Simpson , who were found lying_in deep pools of blood on June 13 . The examiner , Dr. Irwin L . Golden , noted that both victims suffered gashes across their necks and numerous wounds on their hands , an indication that they tried to fend_off the thrusts of the assailant ' s weapon . He also for the first time raised the possibility that more_than one weapon might have been used in the attacks , noting that at least some of the wounds appeared different than the majority of cuts . The testimony by Friday ' s witnesses capped a preliminary hearing in which prosecutors introduced a pair of bloody gloves -- one found at the murder scene , one on a walkway behind Simpson ' s home -- as well as bloodstains taken from his car and driveway . The district_attorney ' s office also pounded away at Simpson ' s alibi by introducing witnesses who suggested that the murders may have occurred as early as 10:15 p.m. or 10:20 p.m. on June 12 -- testimony that challenged the contention of Simpson ' s attorneys , who said their client could not have committed the murders in part because he was home waiting for a limousine at 11 p.m. For their part , Simpson ' s lawyers attacked the credibility of witnesses and accused the police of mishandling the investigation . On Friday , they also raised questions about the coroner ' s work , noting that medical_examiners waited hours before performing tests that might have more closely pinpointed the time of death . In a last-ditch effort to have the case dismissed without a trial , Shapiro urged Kennedy-Powell to toss_out the case because the prosecution theory linking Simpson to the crime &quot; just doesn ' t stand_up to logic. &quot; Shapiro based that argument largely on what he said were holes in the prosecution cases . To have committed the crime , Shapiro said , Simpson would have had less than an hour to kill two victims , abandon his bloody clothing , dispose_of the murder weapon and a pair of bloody shoes &quot; and then go_back to his house and leave a bloody glove in his back yard. &quot; Shapiro , his voice rising , also launched a two-prong challenge to the testimony indicating that a blood sample from the crime scene matches Simpson ' s blood_type . First , he said , tens of thousands of people in Los Angeles alone have blood with the same characteristics ; and , second , even if it does turn_out to be Simpson ' s blood at the scene , the location also was the home of his children , which he visited often . Simpson therefore could have cut himself on another occasion , explaining the blood droplets , Shapiro said . Shapiro also raised the possibility that other suspects may be under investigation because a police_detective testified Thursday that new leads continue to arrive all_the time and that the investigation continues . But police sources said Friday that there is not any other suspect being sought , an assessment with which Garcetti concurred at his news_conference . When it came her time to address the court Friday afternoon , Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark , who has sparred with Shapiro since even before the hearing began , said her adversary ' s closing remarks typically misrepresented the case against Simpson . &quot; The evidence is consistent and very powerful , &quot; she said , &quot; even at this early stage of the case to indicate that the defendant has indeed committed every crime that he is charged with. &quot; Clark conceded that the blood_tests presented in court Friday do not single_out Simpson as the only possible suspect in the case . But when combined with other evidence , such_as the matching bloody glove found at his house and the circumstances surrounding his whereabouts during the hour that prosecutors believe the killings took_place , Clark said , &quot; virtually everyone except for the defendant &quot; can be eliminated as a suspect . The prosecution built its case methodically over the past week , an unusual approach to a preliminary hearing because prosecutors often present only minimal evidence in those proceedings . But with the nation watching , they called witness after witness , following what Clark described as a &quot; trail of blood &quot; leading from the crime scene and picking_up at Simpson ' s house . They left the most important evidence for the hearing ' s final hours . Matheson , a supervisor at the Los Angeles Police_Department crime lab , provided the cornerstone of the prosecution ' s physical evidence , and his testimony had been interrupted late Thursday when court recessed for the day without him getting the chance to detail the results of any blood_tests . That left an air of suspense hanging over the proceedings when they reconvened Friday morning . But Clark quickly dispelled it by moving Matheson to the heart of his testimony . Under questioning from Clark , Matheson produced a chart detailing specifics of the blood_types of O.J. Simpson , Nicole Simpson , Goldman and a sample taken from the cobblestone path leading away from the murder scene . Using that chart , Matheson explained the testing procedures employed to determine a person ' s blood_type and to rule_out possible matches . In this case , he said , only one of the three people whose blood_type was analyzed could have been the source of that droplet . &quot; Could Nicole Simpson have left the blood drop at 875 South Bundy ? &quot; Clark asked . &quot; No , &quot; Matheson responded . &quot; With respect_to Ronald Goldman . . . could he have been a source of that blood drop on the trail ? &quot; the prosecutor continued . &quot; No , &quot; Matheson answered . &quot; He could not. &quot; &quot; With respect_to the defendant , could he have been the source of the blood drop that was found on the trail at 875 South Bundy ? &quot; Clark then asked . &quot; Yes , &quot; Matheson said . &quot; He can be included in the group of possibles. &quot; Continuing with that questioning , Clark then sought to show that the group of people who could have been the source of that blood was small enough to suggest Simpson as a likely suspect . Matheson said he computed the frequency of each of the three genetic markers occurring in a single sample and determined that 0.43 % of the population would share those characteristics -- meaning that the odds against someone having an identical match are more_than 200 to 1 . In his cross-examination , however , Simpson lawyer Gerald F . Uelmen elicited an admission from Matheson that samples recovered from crime scenes sometimes blend blood from more_than one person , confusing the analysis and changing the odds . Given the blood characteristics in this case , Matheson said that could mean that one out of every 100 , rather than 200 , people could have produced characteristics such_as the one found leading away from the two bodies . &quot; When you talk_about that kind of frequency in a population the size of Los Angeles , for example , where we have 8 million people , you ' re saying that there are something on the order of 40 # 000 to 80 # 000 other people whose blood would produce the identical genetic markers that you have identified ? &quot; Uelmen suggested to Matheson . &quot; Approximately , that ' s correct , yes , &quot; Matheson said . The test results presented in court Friday represent a first glimpse at the battery of procedures that investigators expect to perform on blood samples recovered from the scene of the crime and Simpson ' s home . The most precise , DNA tests , will not be completed for several weeks . Although preliminary DNA tests have been completed , prosecutors did not seek to admit those results during the preliminary hearing . They need only show at this hearing that there is sufficient evidence for Simpson to stand trial , not that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . In a news_conference after the hearing , Garcetti said he is confident that the DNA results will be ready in time for trial . Matheson ' s testimony provided the linchpin of the prosecution ' s preliminary hearing case , but he was followed to the stand_by an equally captivating witness , the medical_examiner who performed the autopsies on the victims ' bodies and who clinically described their extensive injuries before a spellbound courtroom Friday . Simpson sighed heavily and rolled his head back as Deputy Medical_Examiner Dr. Irwin L . Golden of the Los Angeles County coroner ' s office described the black dress and undergarments that Nicole Simpson was wearing when she was murdered a_few feet from the front_door of her Brentwood condominium , where her two children were sleeping inside . Golden was questioned by Deputy Dist . Atty . William Hodgman , whose gentle style contrasts with Clark ' s scrappy approach to witnesses . After describing his qualifications , Golden quietly detailed the cutting , slashing and puncture wounds to both victims . As they have been throughout the preliminary hearing , family members of the two victims were in court for that testimony . Members of the Goldman family hugged each other tightly as the medical_examiner described the state of the bodies in clinical terms . Nicole Simpson ' s sister grimaced and clenched her teeth , staring directly ahead as Golden explained how her sibling died . Nicole Simpson , Golden said , died from a cut_to her throat so deep that it nicked her spinal_column . Golden described it as a &quot; gaping &quot; wound and pointed to a chart in which it was highlighted in deep_red . Although Nicole Simpson ' s knife wounds were largely confined to her head and neck , Goldman suffered dozens of knife wounds_up and down his body , including three sets that could have killed him -- punctures to his right lung , a deep pair of slashes across his throat and a five-inch deep wound to the left side of his abdomen . Both victims also were cut on the hands , evidence that they attempted to fight_off their attacker , Golden said . Goldman ' s sister and stepmother , who have sat side_by_side through much of the hearing , cried quietly and held each other ' s hands while Golden described the attack on the young_man , who would have turned 26 last weekend . Goldman ' s father left court before hearing the medical_examiner testify . As the case passes from Municipal to Superior_Court , a mystery moves with it . In court last week , Judge Kennedy-Powell held_up a bulky envelope containing evidence that Shapiro had turned_over to another judge for safekeeping . Neither police nor prosecutors have been allowed to look inside . Kennedy-Powell said Friday that her decision to order Simpson to stand trial was not influenced in any way by the envelope or its contents , which are unknown even to her . &quot; That envelope , in a sealed condition , will be transferred , &quot; Kennedy-Powell said , &quot; to the Superior_Court for such further rulings as are appropriate at a future point in time. &quot; Times staff writers Tina Daunt and Carla Hall contributed to this report . The Deadly Attack Dr. Irwin L . Golden , a medical_examiner who performed the autopsies on Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman , testified that the following injuries were the most severe : NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON 1 . A &quot; gaping wound &quot; that severed both carotid_arteries and nicked both jugular_vein , causing extensive blood loss . The fatal wound reached to her spine . 2 . A bruise on the right side of scalp RONALD LYLE GOLDMAN 3 . Two wounds on right side of his neck , one of which severed jugular 4 . Two wounds that entered through rib_cage and into right lung ; both considered fatal 5 . 5.5-inch-deep wound to the abdomen considered fatal OTHER WOUNDS Golden also noted many &quot; defensive &quot; cuts and abrasions to the victims ' arms , hands , faces and bodies . Smaller stab wounds were found on the right side of Nicole Brown Simpson ' s neck , and she had three cuts on the back of her head . Goldman had a deep but not fatal wound to the left thigh .
