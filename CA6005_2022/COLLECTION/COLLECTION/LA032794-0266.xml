   <HEADLINE> WHITEWATER ' S UNDERCURRENT OF CASH FLOWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Whitewater , the Arkansas land deal that has stirred so_much controversy for the White_House , is often dismissed by President Clinton as nothing more_than a hapless effort to make a modest profit by building a dream retirement haven in the Ozarks . &quot; It ' s an investment I made 15 years ago that lost money instead of made money because the property market turned_around at_home , &quot; Clinton said recently . &quot; It ' s a simple , straightforward thing , and it ' ll be shown to be. &quot; But new evidence made public last week , taken together with what was already known , makes_it clear that Whitewater was not quite that simple . While the President and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton -- as they insist -- may have known_nothing about any wrongdoing , federal investigators have found substantial evidence suggesting that the land_development firm was entangled in something that went well beyond selling lots for houses . The Whitewater project , investigators now believe , was part of a labyrinthine system of financial juggling and speculation operated by James B . McDougal , a Little_Rock , Ark. , real_estate developer who was the Clintons ' financial partner in the Whitewater deal and the head of the now-defunct Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan . Federally insured funds from McDougal ' s S &amp; L , which eventually collapsed at a cost of at least $ 47 million to taxpayers , allegedly moved so freely among his various enterprises -- including the Whitewater project -- that one federal investigator called the whole scheme a &quot; massive check-kite. &quot; The exact nature of the Clintons ' involvement in the overall enterprise , and the extent of their knowledge about its affairs , remain uncertain . Even though the Clintons ' public statements and tax records indicate that they lost $ 46 # 635.75 as a result of their investment in the Whitewater endeavor , they were named as &quot; possible beneficiaries &quot; of McDougal ' s activities in documents forwarded to the Justice_Department by officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. , which investigated Madison Guaranty and related businesses . For one thing , as McDougal struggled to conceal the fact that his financial empire was going bankrupt , as much as $ 100 # 000 was diverted from Madison Guaranty to the Whitewater project -- money that taxpayers ultimately had to make_up . And with many of the records now missing , one investigative source speculated that &quot; it may be that McDougal , in his head , has the only complete record of where the money came from and where it went. &quot; What follows is a step-by-step guide to what is known and what is not known thus far about a relatively minor business investment that has turned_into the most dangerous controversy in Clinton ' s career : Not-So-Equal Partners In 1978 , the Clintons became partners with McDougal and his then-wife , Susan , in purchasing 230 acres of land along the White_River in northern Arkansas . Together they obtained loans totaling $ 203 # 000 to buy the property . The money was borrowed at 10 % interest , meaning that the partners were obligating themselves to pay at least $ 20 # 000 a year to keep_from defaulting . Out of_their_own pocket , the Clintons put_up $ 500 . Although the development was said to be a 50-50 partnership between the McDougals and the Clintons , there was no signed contract between them , and the two couples never seem to have shared equally in profits or losses . By Clinton ' s own account , the McDougals had contributed $ 268 # 000 and withdrawn $ 175 # 800 by 1992 , for a net investment ( and loss ) of $ 92 # 200 . That is almost twice what the Clintons claim to have lost on the deal . In addition to repaying the two initial loans they took_out to acquire the property , the partners had other Whitewater-related expenses . In the first two years after creating the Whitewater project , it has been reported that they spent $ 40 # 000 dividing land into 44 parcels , building gravel roads and printing brochures . Exactly how the loans and expenses were covered on a monthly basis is not entirely clear . While the lots did not sell as quickly as the owners had hoped , land sales did generate a steady stream of income for the company . Yet even after they officially shifted the ownership of the property into the newly created Whitewater Development Corp . in 1979 , the McDougals and the Clintons say they frequently were forced to use personal funds to cover business debts and current expenses . In 1978 and 1979 alone , the Clintons claim to have paid more_than $ 22 # 120.60 in interest payments on the initial loan . Then in 1980 , Hillary Clinton borrowed another $ 30 # 000 at 20 % interest from the McDougal-owned Bank of Kingston , Ark. , in_order to construct a model home on Whitewater lot No . 13 . She borrowed it in her name ; McDougal ' s bank was prohibited by law from making loans directly to any of_his_own business ventures . The model home was sold in 1981 for $ 27 # 700 , but it came_back to them in 1988 after the buyer declared bankruptcy and died . Because the Clintons still owed $ 13 # 000 on the initial loan , they paid $ 8 # 000 to reacquire the property . It was then resold , and the Clintons reported a $ 1 # 640 capital_gain after paying_off the note . The Clintons have said they were passive partners in the Whitewater project and that it was McDougal who ran the business on a day-to-day basis . But they have never explained why they did not share equally with the McDougals in Whitewater losses . A Wider Scheme ? Many of these seemingly complex transactions , mixing personal and corporate obligations , are typical of closely held enterprises , but in other ways Whitewater seems to have been anything but a normal small business . According to government investigators , tens of thousands of dollars passed_through Whitewater accounts that bear no obvious relationship to the real_estate development itself . These transactions are the source of the government ' s keen interest in the Whitewater project . Investigators say they believe McDougal was using Whitewater Development -- as well as_many of his other companies -- to drain federally insured money from Madison Guaranty in a scheme that may have robbed the thrift of hundreds of thousands of dollars . In a memo released last week , an RTC investigator estimated at least $ 100 # 000 in Madison Guaranty funds were funneled into Whitewater Development . What portion of these funds from Madison Guaranty may have been used to pay Whitewater debts is unknown . Some of the individual transactions appear to be perfectly legal . For example , the directors of a Madison Guaranty subsidiary_company paid $ 30 # 000 into a Whitewater account in April , 1985 , as a &quot; bonus &quot; to McDougal . Since McDougal controlled the company , he had a right to award himself a bonus , but the timing suggests what his purpose may have been : At the time , Whitewater Development owed a payment on its outstanding debt , and its account was overdrawn by $ 28 # 000 . Other transfers of money from Madison Guaranty to Whitewater Development raise unanswered questions . The RTC ' s chief investigator indicated that Whitewater Development also received &quot; unauthorized &quot; loans from Madison Guaranty . One such transaction is already well known . On Nov . 8 , 1985 , McDougal sent a check for $ 7 # 322.42 to the Security Bank of Paragould as a payment on the money originally borrowed by Hillary Clinton for the model home . Two years earlier , the Clintons had refinanced the then-unpaid balance of $ 20 # 000 on the loan through Security Bank , apparently to obtain a lower interest_rate . Although McDougal made the payment from Whitewater funds , the corporate account was nearly empty at the time . So he covered the check with a transfer of $ 7 # 500 in funds from a Madison Guaranty subsidiary that investigators say they believe was often used to siphon money from the thrift . This transaction is cited by Clinton ' s critics as evidence that federally insured thrift money was improperly used to pay obligations owed by the Clintons . If so , the critics reason , the President and his wife are responsible_for a small portion of the $ 47-million bill left_behind for the taxpayers to pay when Madison Guaranty was declared insolvent in 1989 . Profit or Loss ? In 1992 , when Clinton was running_for President , he asserted that he had advanced a total of $ 68 # 900 to Whitewater Development -- most of it in payments on loans taken_out on behalf of the company -- and received nothing in return . Last week , however , he lowered that figure to $ 43 # 635.75. He said he had mistakenly included in the Whitewater total a loan of about $ 20 # 000 he took_out to help his mother buy a house -- a transaction completely unrelated to the Whitewater project . The Clintons still adhere to the judgment of attorney James Lyons of Denver , who reviewed their Whitewater finances in 1992 and concluded that they had received no profit . It is not known how much , if any , Whitewater money was used to pay_off debts Clinton had incurred in his own name , but critics have suggested such funds should have been treated as income by Clinton and reported on his tax_returns . The President did not list these payments as personal_income on his taxes , apparently because he viewed them as corporate -- not personal -- debts . Clinton ' s critics are intrigued by a statement that McDougal made in 1992 suggesting that the Clintons ' obligations may have been satisfied entirely with corporate funds . &quot; Every bit Clinton put_in , &quot; McDougal said , &quot; was income they didn ' t report. &quot; Indeed , McDougal disagrees_with much of the Clintons ' accounting , but the credibility of the mercurial former thrift owner is itself in_dispute . The Clintons have already acknowledged they had erroneously claimed a tax_deduction for Whitewater-related interest payments totaling $ 5 # 133 in 1984 and 1985 . They said the mistake occurred because they personally received interest statements from the bank that should have been directed to Whitewater Development . Predictably , these contradictions have caused Clinton ' s critics to question the President ' s arithmetic as well as his claim that the Whitewater project was a simple investment in which he lost money . On Thursday , Rep . Jim Leach ( R-Iowa ) , who is conducting his own Whitewater probe , posed these questions : &quot; Did . . . the Clintons ever receive income from Whitewater ? Why do the records show only that the McDougals did ? How many personal interest payments did Whitewater make on the Clintons ' behalf ? Did the Clintons know whether other McDougal-related companies infused capital into Whitewater , and does this make the former governor indebted to McDougal ' s other partners or complicitous in any improper activities they might have been engaged in ? &quot; Despite the apparent losses , Leach and others claim , the Clintons received something of_value from the Whitewater project , at least in the form of debt forgiveness . If the McDougals sustained losses larger than the Clintons ' in an equal partnership , they also ask : Should the difference be considered a gift to the governor from the owner of a state-regulated business ? Furthermore , Clinton ' s critics note that the President benefited in another way by taking an $ 8 # 000 income_tax deduction for interest payments he claims to have made on Whitewater-related loans . Postscript In 1992 , the Clintons sold their share of Whitewater Development to McDougal for $ 1 # 000 . But they did not claim any Whitewater losses on their income_tax filing that year , as they frequently did when they sold other unprofitable investments . White_House aides said the Clintons lacked the necessary documentation to claim a deduction . Neither Whitewater Development nor McDougal has filed tax_returns for all_of the years involved , also apparently because of a shortage of documentation .</TEXT>
