   <HEADLINE> FUR FLIES OVER CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSALS TO CURB COLONIES OF STRAY CATS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Until the law caught_up_with them , the 20 stray cats of Riverside Park led a charmed existence . The portly tabbies spent their days wandering sun-dappled bike trails and lolling on the rocks overlooking the Potomac_River . Dinner came_on schedule every day , a huge mound of cat_chow toted in by feline-fancying neighbors of this leafy National_Park_Service land south of Washington , D.C. The lucky creatures belonged_to a managed colony , an outdoor welfare plan for abandoned cats , underwritten by devoted volunteers . Such colonies , consisting_of six to 100 cats , are rapidly spreading across the United States . California alone has more_than 100 of them . In some circles , however , they ' re wearing_out their welcome . With increasing frequency , bird lovers and other conservationists resist locating cat colonies in parks , on beaches and in other natural areas . &quot; Someone has to take responsibility , &quot; said Louise Holton , who three years ago helped found Alley_Cat Allies , the national feral cat network , based in Mt.Rainier , Md . &quot; There are 60 million abandoned cats out there. &quot; But Peter Stangel , program director of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Institute , said : &quot; Cats are really ferocious predators . They should be kept inside . Colonies of cats should be removed. &quot; Using a concept developed 20 years ago in England , the network teaches cat lovers how to manage colonies of feral animals . Self-appointed caretakers feed and water the cats daily and see to their health needs . Every cat that can be trapped is vaccinated and sterilized . The volunteers usually pay all_the bills , sometimes for as_many as 150 cats . Caretakers rescue unwanted cats from the short , brutish lives that strays customarily lead and save them from a one-way trip to an animal shelter . About 6 million unwanted cats are euthanized in the United States each year . The rescuers often move cats into natural areas to isolate them from cars and human cat-abusers . That puts concentrations of the animals close to birds and other vulnerable wildlife . Conservationists are particularly concerned about threatened or endangered songbirds . Research supports their point . Feral cats have nearly wiped_out parrot populations on some Caribbean_islands . One study in Britain estimated that the country ' s 5 million house_cats kill 70 million small animals each year , including 20 million birds . A recent study of radio-collared farm cats in Wisconsin estimated that free-ranging cats kill 19 million songbirds and 140 # 000 game_birds in the state each year . Feral cats also threaten reptiles . They have reduced the density of ground lizards in the desert parks near Tucson , Ariz. , and eradicated generations of young marine lizards on at least one island in the Galapagos archipelago off Ecuador . Colonies intensify the problem . &quot; What you get is a dense pack of predators , &quot; said Ron Jurek , an endangered-wildlife biologist with the California Department of Fish and Game . &quot; Normally , there aren ' t more_than about a dozen predators per square mile. &quot; Caretakers insist that their well-fed cats aren ' t that interested in prey . &quot; Cats are just a scapegoat , &quot; Holton said . But animal behaviorists say that a cat ' s brain is wired to hunt , even if its belly is_full . Nor do bells and declawing reduce a cat ' s efficiency , they say . The cunning hunters simply adapt to the handicaps . Several states have tried legislation . Animal-control experts argue for licensing , mandatory sterilization and limits on the number of cats anyone can own or care_for . &quot; We get constant complaints about cats , &quot; said Alvina Pitches , president of the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies . &quot; They hang_around bird feeders , they yowl all night or there are just too many of them around. &quot; But anyone who takes_on the feral cat lobby quickly learns how strong it is . One survey estimates that 15 million Americans feed 35 million feral cats . Earlier this year , a coalition of California environmental and animal-rights groups thought it had the votes to pass a law requiring owners to sterilize all free-roaming cats . Alley_Cat Allies , which supports sterilization , originally supported the legislation . But when caretakers found that they , too , would be considered owners , they launched an emotional campaign that defeated the bill . &quot; These people don ' t subscribe_to ecology principles , &quot; said John McCaull , California legislative director for the National Audubon Society . &quot; But politicians see how controversial this is and say , ' Hey , this is cats . I ' ve got better things to do. ' &quot; College campuses are a frequent scene of these battles . Students often abandon cats when they move_on . Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton is a case_in_point . With its president ' s blessing , a librarian maintains a colony of 35 or more cats on the campus , even though the campus is a sanctuary for burrowing owls , the only ground-nesting owl in North_America . The number of owls has dwindled since the cats arrived , said Sheila Mahoney , a zoology professor . So far , the cat lovers seem to have the upper_hand , perhaps for the same reason that books about cats are_best sellers and cat_food sales outpace baby food sales . Cats are the most popular pet in the United States . But in Riverside Park , the cats lost . Despite hate mail , letters to newspapers and threats , the National_Park_Service in April began trapping the animals and delivering them to the county shelter , where they face probable euthanasia .</TEXT>
