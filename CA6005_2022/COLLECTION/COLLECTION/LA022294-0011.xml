   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO ; CLEAR THE AIR FOR A CLEAN ELECTION ; CHIAPAS EXPOSES SALINAS ' SHORTCOMINGS . IF HE ' LL ADMIT THEM AND MAKE AMENDS , THE RISK OF TURMOIL IS REDUCED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The peasant rebellion in Chiapas has produced no more fighting since early January , but its political effects continue to reverberate throughout Mexico . Negotiations between the indigenous insurgents and the government of Carlos Salinas de Gortari are just beginning , but talks between officials and the national political opposition have been under way for several weeks and may come_to fruition before the Chiapas talks do . It may well be precisely because the problems in Chiapas are so intractable , and the need for the government to show some results and good_faith so great , that authentic electoral reform in Mexico may be finally forthcoming . The reasons for the Salinas administration ' s new , apparent flexibility , are evident . First , it has to come_up with something in the way of addressing the Zapatista National Liberation Army ' s demands , and clean elections are certainly one of them . Second and most important is the unprecedented risk of turmoil and strife if the Aug . 21 presidential election is perceived as fraudulent . This time around , unlike 1988 , arms are involved , and the Zapatistas ' lesson of how much a little violence can achieve is telling . Moreover , opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is gaining_ground , if only slightly , and he surely will do_better than the lowly third place and a humiliating 10 % to 15 % of the vote that was predicted a_few months ago . Thus , if Cardenas contests an electoral result that does not grant him victory , Mexico ' s famed stability will come_to an end . Finally , there is the foreign factor : Stealing an election in broad daylight , or being deservedly accused of doing so by a significant share of the electorate , is bad for business , bad for NAFTA , bad for those in the United States who have bet_on President Salinas . What will constitute electoral reform ? The broad agenda is_well known , but the_devil is in the details . The rolls have to be audited and cleansed so that the dead stop voting and the living start . Electoral bodies must be restaffed in_order to become independent ; for now , from the very top all_the way to the most remote polling_booth , the government and the ruling PRI ( Institutional Revolutionary Party ) have a built-in majority . Limits must be set_on campaign financing and spending , both to avoid incidents like last year ' s $ 750-million shakedown dinner attended by Mexico ' s business magnates and to sever the umbilical_cord between the PRI and government . Access to the media must be assured , and television coverage -- the major source of news for most Mexicans -- must be made fair and equitable . Finally , the issue of national and foreign election observers must be addressed . All of this must be fleshed_out in detail by all three main political_parties : the PRI , the PAN ( National Action Party ) and Cardenas ' PRD ( Democratic Revolutionary Party ) . Cardenas ' agreement is critical , for he would have to be satisfied that the vote was fair if he were to accept a negative result for himself . Given the circumstances in post-Chiapas Mexico , were elections free and fair , the PRI might lose them . The economy experienced zero growth in 1993 ; the distribution of income has continued to deteriorate , along with the job market ; the uprising in Chiapas has left much of the country feeling guilty over its mistreatment of the indigenous people throughout Mexico . The PRI is divided between factions favoring Luis Donaldo Colosio and Manuel Camacho . Colosio is Salinas ' anointed successor , Camacho the lonely runner-up . Now , as Salinas ' peace negotiator in Chiapas , Camacho ' s popularity grows by leaps and bounds as his influence within the PRI wanes . Insurrections are breaking_out across the Mexican countryside , the public sector growing increasingly contemptuous of a political_system seen as corrupt , anti-democratic , ineffective and no longer synonymous with stability . Can Cardenas win if elections are clean and the process is equitable ? It depends largely on the type of campaign that develops , and this in turn hinges_on what President Salinas decides to do . If the campaign focuses_on his administration and the election becomes a referendum on it , the opposition ' s chances are good . It is easier to criticize a flawed regime than to propose remedies . Cardenas has found his sea legs in his daily attacks on the government , and Colosio seems ill_at_ease defending Salinas ' record -- which is not , after all , his record . If the campaign is to be more_than a judgment of Salinas ' record , someone other_than the opposition will have to do the judging . And that someone is Salinas himself . Only he can spell_out clearly the profound , substantive mistakes of his administration : where things went_wrong , what the erroneous decisions were , who made them and why , not just in Chiapas , but in the entire course of his term . By taking_on the past himself , he would force those who would succeed him to talk_about the future . That would free Colosio to present his own ideas instead of having to defend Salinas . Self-immolation has for years been a fixture of Mexico ' s political_system . Virtually every president has engaged in it ; they have had no choice . The system that Salinas will live and die by has its traditions . Political , if not human , sacrifice is one ; he , too , may have no choice .</TEXT>
