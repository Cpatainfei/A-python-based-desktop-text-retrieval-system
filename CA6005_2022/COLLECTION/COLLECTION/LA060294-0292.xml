   <HEADLINE> SALVADOR CHIEF SWORN IN AMID FEARS FOR PEACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Armando Calderon Sol , leader of a right-wing political_party once associated with death squads , was sworn_in as president of El_Salvador on Wednesday amid warnings that reforms aimed at preserving this country ' s fledgling peace are dangerously incomplete . As the first president to take_office since the end of a brutal , 12-year civil_war , Calderon Sol pledged to rebuild his devastated , still polarized country with free-market economics and attention to long-neglected social programs . But he acknowledged that Salvadoran society is far from reconciled . &quot; We have achieved peace , the guns are silent , &quot; he said in an elaborate ceremony before Central_America ' s leaders and dozens of international delegations . &quot; But we have yet to shatter the suspicions and sterile antagonisms . We must rebuild our nation physically , morally and spiritually so that we can together achieve social peace. &quot; This was El_Salvador ' s first peacetime transfer of power between civilians in more_than six decades . Calderon Sol assumes office a year and a half after U.N.-brokered accords ended the war between Cuban-backed leftist guerrillas and U.S.-backed forces . The war claimed more_than 70 # 000 lives and sent 1 million Salvadorans fleeing to Los Angeles , Washington and other cities . Calderon Sol , the portly 45-year-old former mayor of San Salvador and an original member of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance , or Arena , was elected April 24 in a landslide over leftist candidate Ruben Zamora , who represented a coalition that included the former rebels . The U.N. accords set_in_motion sweeping military , political and judicial reforms aimed at installing democracy and guaranteeing all Salvadorans ' security . The government succeeded in substantially reducing the army , but some of the most important reforms have not been fulfilled . In a report issued May 11 , the United Nations cited &quot; serious shortcomings &quot; in completing the accords and emphasized flaws in the formation of a new civilian police_force , considered the cornerstone to maintaining peace and building a system of justice . The report complained that the &quot; civilian nature &quot; of the new police_force is in jeopardy because agents from the old , paramilitary National Police have been phased into the new agency without proper training or screening to eliminate human_rights abusers . The government of outgoing President Alfredo Cristiani , also a member of Calderon Sol ' s Arena party , has repeatedly delayed demobilizing the dreaded paramilitary police . It recently indicated it would not do so until sometime between January and March of next year . The U.N. report also complained that 30 senior positions in the civilian police_force have gone_to officers from the militarized force and that reports of human_rights abuses have increased . Calderon Sol has publicly attacked several reforms in the peace accords . But since his election in April , and again on Wednesday , he insisted he would abide_by them . &quot; I say you have to give him the benefit of the doubt -- it ' s his first day , &quot; Joaquin Villalobos , a former guerrilla commander who now heads a social_democratic_party , said as he emerged from the inauguration . &quot; But we will have to see how much distance there is between words and actions. &quot; The issue of the police and public_security is especially urgent because of renewed violence , some of it political , that has claimed the lives of former rebels and several Arena militants in recent months . Amid fears of a resurgence of death squads , U.N. peacekeepers late last year appointed a special commission , the Joint Group , to investigate the violence over a six-month period ending this week . On Tuesday , the commission asked_for a two-month extension , after a flurry of killings and attempted slayings in the last two weeks . Despite his party ' s history as an authoritarian and militaristic organization , Calderon Sol has taken pains to assure the world that he and the forces around him have become more moderate . &quot; The era of dogmas and fanaticisms has ended , &quot; Calderon Sol said Wednesday , apparently referring to both the left and right . Arena officials say they have abandoned their extremist past to move closer to the center and to broaden their appeal . Key to a more pragmatic outlook , the officials say , is the growing role of Arena ' s business_sector . But the new president and most Arena leaders continue to revere the late Roberto D ' Aubuisson , party founder and reputed organizer of death squads that killed thousands of suspected leftist sympathizers during the war . In the highly partisan crowd at Calderon Sol ' s inauguration , supporters held aloft a larger-than-life poster of D ' Aubuisson in his trademark , clenched-fist pose . And several military_officers purged as part of the peace accords were in_attendance , including retired Gens . Rene Emilio Ponce and Orlando Zepeda ; they were accused of ordering the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests considered supportive of the rebels . &quot; The new president and the people around him are using all_the right words ( about democracy ) , but I don ' t think they know what the words mean , &quot; a Latin_American diplomat said . &quot; Arena is still very influenced by hard-line elements . You won ' t see them in government , but they ' re there. &quot; In his 45-minute inaugural speech -- witnessed by Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott , who represented the United States , which spent an estimated $ 6 billion to shore_up Salvadoran governments and the army -- Calderon Sol called_for &quot; constructive opposition. &quot; But in many ways , he will be able to govern with a free hand because the leftist opposition has fallen_into disarray . Arena won most of the seats in flawed National Assembly elections in March . More important , the former guerrillas , who formed a political_party as part of the accords , have exploded into bitter , public disputes over direction and tactics . A permanent rupture may be_on the horizon . The absence of an effective opposition has compounded fears among some Salvadorans that Calderon Sol will be able to disregard the peace accord reforms if he so chooses . &quot; There are no checks , there are no balances , &quot; said Gerardo LeChevallier , a senior official of the centrist Christian Democratic Party .</TEXT>
