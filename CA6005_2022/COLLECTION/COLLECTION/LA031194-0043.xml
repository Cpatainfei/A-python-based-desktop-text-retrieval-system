   <HEADLINE> IF YOU WANT EXAMPLES OF MANAGED TRADE . . . ; GEOPOLITICS : EUROPE SHOULD JOIN WITH THE U.S. IN TRYING TO OPEN JAPAN ' S MARKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It shouldn ' t escape our attention ( that ) the European Union has been just as frustrated as the United States in opening the Japanese market , but . . . it also is a matter_of_course that the Europeans are always delighted when they can hold our coats and we can go_out and get our noses bloodied . But we ' re happy to do that , we understand our obligations to run interference for the ( European ) Union . Let me say with_regard_to the Union , it ' s interesting that there have been some ( European ) voices . . . that have said our approach in the ( Japan-U.S. ) framework . . . is managed trade . First of all , I ' m not sure what managed trade is . Is managed trade when you have a voluntary restraint on automobiles and trucks at 16 % in Europe , including transplant production ? Naw , that would n ' t be managed trade , would it ? No , because the Europeans did_it . Now when they do_it , that ' s protecting their markets and making_sure it ' s fair . When we do_it -- the largest open market in the world , who led Bretton Woods and GATT , have kept ( our ) markets open since the Second_World_War , who ' ve led global growth , who have a President who made_sure there was a Uruguay Round . . . who made_sure there was a NAFTA , who made_sure we ' re trying to open_up Japanese markets -- that ' s not good_enough . But we could have a voluntary restraint , we can have a procurement directive ( as ) in Europe , which says if you don ' t have 50 % European content , you can be arbitrarily excluded from a bid -- but that ' s not managed trade , that ' s good , common sense.We can have a broadcast directive that says you have to have at least 50 % European content on television to protect European culture . Well , it ' s interesting . Are we protecting British culture or Portuguese or German ? I ' m trying to figure_out what European culture is . So every time the United States wants to go_out there and make_sure we lead global growth or we try to open markets , and the Europeans believe they sort of can come_in in our wake , they don ' t want to stand with us . Every time it ' s in their interest , of course , to engage in behavior which is not opening their markets , that ' s justified . We all need to . . . work_on a multilateral basis . . . to make_sure we open the second-largest economy in the world . This is not ganging_up on the Japanese ; this is in everyone ' s interest , including the Japanese government ' s for the Japanese people . So we stand ready . . . to trilateralize or multilateralize these talks . We welcome anyone ' s joining in and making_sure we do this on a reasonable basis , but what we don ' t look_for is criticism from those who sit on the sidelines . And this is not a game anymore , folks . See , we ' re talking_about real jobs for real people , and for a European Union that ' s suffering . . . with 12 % unemployment , I would only suggest they should work with us as we ' re willing to work with them as great allies to make_sure we open markets around the world .</TEXT>
