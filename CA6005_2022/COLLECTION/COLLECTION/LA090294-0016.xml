   <TEXT> Rwanda and Zaire pledged Thursday to help an estimated 1.2 million Hutu refugees return to their homeland in Rwanda from wretched camps in eastern Zaire , and Zaire urged that they return by the end of this month . Filippo Grandi , the field chief for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees in Goma , said it was &quot; a big achievement &quot; that both countries had agreed to work together . &quot; The meeting does give a ray of hope that we can solve the refugee problem in the near future , &quot; Grandi said after Rwandan and Zairian ministers initialed their agreement . Earlier , Rwanda ' s new Tutsi-led government invited Hutu refugee leaders to come_to Kigali , the Rwandan capital , to help draw_up plans to repatriate the refugees . U.N. officials said they were pleased by the outcome of the meeting here , but cautioned against expecting any immediate resolution of the refugee problem . The joint statement adopts the U.N. stand that any repatriation should be voluntary , but the Rwandan government wants Zaire to help convince the Hutus that it is safe to go_home . More_than 1.2 million Hutu refugees fled the advancing army of the Tutsi rebels now in power in Rwanda , and more_than 800 # 000 more are in other countries . The new government says Hutu refugees can return without fear but promises to punish anyone involved in the spring ' s ethnic massacres .</TEXT>
