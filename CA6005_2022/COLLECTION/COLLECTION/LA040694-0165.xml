   <HEADLINE> COALITION SPLIT MUDDIES ITALY ' S POLITICAL WATERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The right-wing alliance that billionaire Silvio Berlusconi led to a landmark electoral victory splintered in acrimony Tuesday , jeopardizing the stability of any new government . Berlusconi angrily broke_off negotiations to form a government alliance with Umberto Bossi of the federalist Northern League . Bossi has been insulting Berlusconi almost without pause in recent days . An autocrat , a potential demagogue , &quot; Berlus-kaiser , &quot; snapped the obdurate Bossi on Tuesday . As a result of electoral reforms that made politics more transparent , such theatrics are visible for the first time to Italians weaned on back-room deals , leaving analysts to wonder whether Tuesday ' s noisy split was a tactic or a symptom of a breach too wide to mend . Speaking_to a hastily summoned news_conference in Milan on Tuesday after new Bossi barrages , Berlusconi called it quits . He said he expects to be named prime_minister and that he will ask Parliament to ratify him and a Cabinet he will assemble . Failing that , Italy will immediately return to the polls , he said . If President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro offered him the post , Berlusconi said , &quot; the next day there would be a government program , a team and , without consultations , we would go directly to the Parliament &quot; for a vote_of_confidence . &quot; If that didn ' t happen , then let ' s go_to new elections to complete the cleanup. &quot; Bossi said after Berlusconi ' s remarks , &quot; I think he ' s lost his nerve. &quot; Berlusconi , 57 , a media and real_estate magnate who does not take criticism lightly , emerged as an overnight sensation in elections last week that overturned nearly half a century of centrist rule_in Italy . Running in his first election , Berlusconi and his Forza Italia ( Go Italy ) won control of the powerful lower house of Parliament and a near majority in the upper in concert with Bossi ' s northern-based party and neo-fascists led by Gianfranco Fini . But trying to translate the electoral returns into a government program has short-circuited the nominal three-party alliance . The main cause is Bossi , whom Berlusconi excoriated for an hour Tuesday without naming him directly . The rough-talking , uncompromising senator dislikes Berlusconi ' s command of a large section of the Italian media and his prince ' s role in big business . Bossi also dislikes the neo-fascists , junior partners in the electoral alliance . &quot; It ' s a betrayal . . . scandalous what ' s happening , &quot; Berlusconi said . &quot; From now on , we will not talk with the League or any other party . We will simply wait until the president announces his intentions. &quot; Under the constitution , Italy ' s figurehead president appoints a party leader to form a government -- in this case Berlusconi , as leader of the largest party . Berlusconi charges that Bossi is &quot; an obstacle to reform , &quot; while Bossi terms his putative ally a self-aggrandizing autocrat who is a danger to democracy . Bossi insists on federalism as the basis of any government with Northern League support . He hates the less developed Italian south , which he sees as draining the productive north of money and resources and the chance to be a first-row player in the new Europe . Berlusconi , whose campaign centered around Ronald Reagan-like promises of more jobs and lower taxes , says he is ready to talk_about federalism . Bossi , though , who in post-election euphoria appeared to have withdrawn objections to Berlusconi as prime_minister , failed even to turn_up at a scheduled summit last Friday . Since then , Bossi , whose party claims 122 of the winning alliance ' s 366 seats in the Chamber of Deputies , the lower house , has railed against Berlusconi to every passing camera from his vacation_home in the Italian Alps . Fini , by contrast , whose extreme-right party was restored to respectability by the election for the first time in 50 years , strongly supports Berlusconi as prime_minister . Fini expects major government participation by his newly named National Alliance , although no government post for himself . Fini said he does not believe Bossi can defect from the right-wing alliance . &quot; He must be with us . He has nowhere else to go , &quot; Fini said , arguing that the backlash from frustrated voters would be disastrous for the league at any new election . &quot; Berlusconi was right to break_off the talks . How could he continue negotiations with somebody who takes_back the day after everything he said the day before , &quot; said Fini . &quot; Bossi has broken the eggs without making the omelet. &quot;</TEXT>
