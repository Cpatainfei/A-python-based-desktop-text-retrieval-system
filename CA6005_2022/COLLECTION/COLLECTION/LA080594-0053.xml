   <HEADLINE> DREAM DEBUT VERY NEARLY A NIGHTMARE ; BASKETBALL : U.S. TRAILS SURPRISING SPAIN AT ONE POINT IN FIRST_HALF BEFORE PULLING AWAY FOR A 115-100 VICTORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here ' s another difference between these squads . The Dream Team warmed_up in Monaco amid the casinos and topless sunbathers on the Riviera . Son of Dream Team opened Thursday night in a half-empty arena in this blue-collar city on the shore of Lake_Ontario . Amid suitably threadbare surroundings , the U.S. began play in the World Cup with a lackluster 115-100 victory over unheralded Spain , which is not expected to play in the medal round . If there had been a spread , the Americans would have missed it by 29 points . That was the average margin of victory of the Dream Team at the 1992 Olympics , 44 points . No opponent scored more_than 85 on the Americans at Barcelona and none ever led as late as Spain did Thursday when it went_up , 42-41 , with 5:27 left in the first_half . The Dream Team ' s smallest margin of victory was 32 points , over Croatia in the finals . The Dream Team also never had a player unhappy over playing time or a coach who suggested he couldn ' t get_through to his players , but Son of Dream Team had both : a gloomy Dominique Wilkins and a frazzled Don Nelson . &quot; We have many great individual players , &quot; Nelson said . &quot; We have to learn to play as a team . &quot; that ' s not an easy lesson to learn . You can talk ' til you ' re blue in the face but they have to experience it and see for themselves . It doesn ' t happen in two weeks. &quot; Nelson started Reggie Miller at forward in a three-guard lineup , hoping to knock Spain off balance with quickness , but it never happened . The day may have passed when clumsy Europeans struggled to bring the ball_up against greyhound American guards or maybe Nelson ' s players weren ' t into it , but the Spaniards sneered at their pressure . The Americans , warned over and over they have to guard everyone on the perimeter in the international game with its three-point line at 20-feet-7 -- three feet shorter than the NBA -- had to experience that for themselves , too . In the first_half , a 7-footer named Ferran Martinez scored 10 points while Shaquille O ' Neal and Alonzo Mourning guarded the lane . In one stretch , Spain scored on 16 of 19 possessions . &quot; Just the whole flow of European basketball kind of threw us for a loss , &quot; starting point guard Kevin Johnson said . &quot; We couldn ' t get a read defensively . Big guys normally have a tendency to help_out in the paint , but you can ' t leave their big guys because they shoot that college three-pointer like they ' re free_throws . &quot; Normally when you have guard penetration , the other guard helps_out , which is what you ' ve been told to do your whole life . They kick it out_to a guy shooting a three-pointer. &quot; In the second_half , Nelson actually told his players not to press as hard and finally American depth told , if not in the earth-flattening style of you-know-whom two years ago . The U.S. went_up by 23 , then nodded_off once more and Spain closed within 15 at the end . &quot; I ' m disappointed , &quot; said Miller , who scored 21 points . &quot; This is a great wake-up call_for us . This is something we definitely needed . Everybody has been patting us on the back and catering to us . Hopefully we ' ll pick_up the papers tomorrow and get something else. &quot; They ' ll get more_than that . They ' ll see their first hint of ego conflict , manifested by Wilkins , trying to suck it up but plainly unhappy after being kept_out until the last seven minutes . This was better than Steve Smith , who didn ' t get_in until the last five . Nelson noted he couldn ' t play everybody -- and added he was going_by the merit_system . &quot; We have to look_back to our training camp , &quot; Nelson said , &quot; and decide who were our best players there . Those 10 players were basically playing better there . &quot; I ' m planning on basically staying with this rotation . I like this rotation very much . It ' s not that they ( Wilkins and Smith ) won ' t be part of it because they will be , but they ' re going to be in more of a reserve role. &quot; Said Wilkins : &quot; Of course , it ' d be hard for me if I don ' t play . You know , I ' ve paid my dues in this league . I deserve the right to be here and the right to play . But if that ' s his decision , hey , no problem , I ' m cool. &quot; Aside from that , it was another totally dominating night in international basketball for the U.S. pros . &quot; We had a 20-point lead , &quot; said Nelson , trailing assurances in his wake . &quot; I think we could have won handily if I would have kept the pressure on and left the starters in the game . I chose not to do that and I think it ' s a good lesson for us to learn. &quot; Basketball Notes In Thursday ' s other Pool A game , China made 12 of 15 free_throws in overtime to beat Brazil , 97-93 . . . . In Pool B , Croatia beat Cuba , 85-65 , as Dino Radja of the Boston Celtics had 25 points and eight rebounds . Croatia ' s NBA frontline of Radja , Toni Kukoc of the Chicago Bulls and Stojan Vrankovic , formerly of the Celtics , finished with a 45-20 rebound advantage . Australia hung_on to beat South_Korea , 87-85 , scoring only one point over the final six minutes as South_Korea closed an 86-71 deficit to 86-85 with 55 seconds to play . Andrew Gaze , who finished with 31 points , made one free_throw with 13 seconds left and South_Korea missed a final three-pointer . . . . In Pool C , Russia beat Argentina , 84-64 , as Yevgeni Kissourin had 19 points . Joey Vickery came_off the bench to score 14 points in Canada ' s 83-52 rout of Angola . . . . In Pool D , Jose Ortiz had 19 points to lead six scorers in double figures as Goodwill Games champion Puerto Rico cruised past Egypt , 102-74 .
