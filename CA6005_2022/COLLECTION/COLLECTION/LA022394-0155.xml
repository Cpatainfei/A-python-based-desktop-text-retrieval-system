   <HEADLINE> HUNTINGTON PARK OFFICER SETTLES RACE BIAS LAWSUIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Jewish Huntington Park police_detective who sued the city in 1992 for anti-Semitic harassment has settled the case for $ 355 # 000 . &quot; Part of me is relieved that it ' s over with because it ' s a tremendous amount of strain , &quot; said Detective Alan Tavelman , who alleged that he was harassed during nine years on the force . He has been_on disability for a knee injury since the suit was filed . &quot; And part of me really wanted to go_to trial to bring it to more people ' s attention as_to what really took place. &quot; Civil rights attorney Barry Litt called the case &quot; among the worst I have seen. &quot; &quot; To me , it ' s reminiscent to the type of things you ' d see against African Americans in the South in the early 1960s -- blatantly racist statements , &quot; said Litt , of the Los Angeles law_firm Litt &amp; Marquez , which represented Tavelman with the American Civil Liberties Union as co-counsel . The suit alleged that incidents included a newspaper_article about the Holocaust that had been left on Tavelman ' s desk and altered to read &quot; . . . burn them all , &quot; references_to a lampshade having been made from his grandfather ' s skin ; pennies taped to his desk , locker and car , an apparent reference_to the stereotype of Jews as penny-pinchers , and implicit threats of violence , such_as bullets left on his desk and in his department mailbox . Huntington Park officials said the decision to settle was made to avoid incurring the cost of a trial . &quot; We felt we had a defensible case , &quot; said City Atty . Steven N . Skolnik . The city was willing to take the case to court but had been advised to settle by the Independent Cities Risk Management Authority , a collective that pools the resources of cities against liability . &quot; The city doesn ' t retain the decision-making power by virtue of its participation in this collective , &quot; Skolnik said . The $ 335 # 000 settlement covers emotional distress and attorneys ' fees , Litt said . Tavelman kept a detailed journal documenting religious slurs and harassment by fellow officers during his time on the force . He filed a federal lawsuit when the harassment continued despite formal complaints filed within the department . During eight days of deposition testimony , the veteran burglary detective testified that harassment began during his prehiring interview when he was asked whether he &quot; wore a funny hat. &quot; &quot; The case causes heightened awareness of the issues and the city may have increased training in the wake of these allegations , but it has always taken very seriously this kind of harassment , &quot; Skolnik said . Police Capt . Daniel A . Leili , who was named in the lawsuit along with Chief Frank Sullivan , Sgt . Ronald Beason and former Chief Patrick M . Connolly , said that although the suit was likely to give the 60-officer department a bad name , changes on the force would be unnecessary because Tavelman ' s allegations were untrue . &quot; I ' m sure the public may reflect on us negatively , but the officers here know very well what was going_on with Mr. Tavelman , and as far as internal morale goes , I don ' t think it will affect us , &quot; Leili said .</TEXT>
