   <TEXT> Probably no natural_event in modern times has quite so awed and humbled us as the spectacular fiery assault of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet on Jupiter . From a distance of 500 million miles came dazzling images of the impact of the comet ' s 20 fragments.It is daunting to think that one of them left a black scar on the Jovian surface larger than the entire planet Earth . Even veteran astronomers were thunderstruck at the size and power of the event , saying that their understanding of planetary physics would have to be revamped . The impact has generated a bonanza of new data from the Hubble Space Telescope that will keep scientists busy for years , and further images from the Galileo spacecraft are_due in a_few weeks . The general public has been stirred too . Seldom does the public get a chance to witness science so dramatically , or to participate in the spirit of excitement , adventure and intellectual curiosity that drives scientific discovery . Even Congress looked_up from such dreary earthly_concerns as Whitewater to direct NASA to search for similar asteroids and comets that could threaten our planet . And there was renewed interest in the theory -- still unconfirmed -- that it was the crash of an asteroid in Mexico 65 million years ago that led to the extinction of dinosaurs . Writing in the journal Nature , Clark R . Chapman of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson put it well : &quot; The black patches on Jupiter have converted planetary impact processes from the realm of theoretical possibilities and ancient geological history to a manifest , dynamic reality. &quot;</TEXT>
