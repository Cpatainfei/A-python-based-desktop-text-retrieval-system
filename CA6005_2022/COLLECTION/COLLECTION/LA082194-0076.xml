   <HEADLINE> IT ' S COW-COW BOOGIE ON DELHI ROADS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lay_off the horn , slow_down , and above all , don ' t wear red . The cows are back on New Delhi ' s streets , and not by popular demand . But did that ever stop them ? Not last year , not this year . Thousands of cows have invaded the city , snarling traffic and making children pass within inches of cows and bulls as they walk to school . Crashing into a cow , or even nudging one aside with a bumper , is sinful for most Hindus , who worship the beasts as &quot; go-matas , &quot; or mother cows . They wander down New Delhi ' s streets all year , but during good monsoons -- like the current one -- they take_to the warmth of the roads in great numbers to avoid their rain-soaked sheds .</TEXT>
