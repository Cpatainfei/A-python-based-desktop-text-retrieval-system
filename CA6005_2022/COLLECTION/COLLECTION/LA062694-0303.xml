   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : FAIRFAX ; D-DAY REALITY COMES ALIVE FOR ROTC CADET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To 17-year-old Charles Butler , generations removed from World_War_II , D-day was something that lived only on a page in a history book . But after touring England earlier this month and taking_part in events commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-day , Butler says the massive military offensive mounted by Allied forces on June 6 , 1944 , lives in him now . &quot; A lot of people lost their family and friends , &quot; said Butler , a Southwest Los Angeles resident and Hamilton High student . &quot; They stood around me crying . . . . It ' s very real for them -- like it happened yesterday. &quot; Butler was one of 24 ROTC naval cadets from the American Southwest chosen by ROTC officials to make the two-week trip earlier this month . The group traveled_to several English ports from which the invasion of France was launched , saw President Clinton and French President Francois Mitterand at D-day events and heard testimonies -- many of them eyewitness accounts of the battle that turned the tide of the war in Europe . One veteran told Butler he parachuted into the wrong spot , about 20 miles north of the appointed place on the Normandy beach in France . And while the cadets performed military_drills for such royalty as the Queen_Mother and Prince Philip , they were getting the red-carpet treatment from the_British . Said Butler , the only African American in his group : &quot; They saw us as diplomatic guests , even though we ' re young . It was kind of a shock to come_back here and be treated like a kid again. &quot; Butler and the cadets stayed_on the Bristol , a British destroyer , and toured Southampton and London . But Butler said the most enduring experience will be honoring D-day . &quot; If it wasn ' t for D-day , &quot; he said , &quot; the Germans might have won the war . And the world would be a very different place today. &quot; ERIN J . AUBRY</TEXT>
