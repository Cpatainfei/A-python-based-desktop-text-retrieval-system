   <HEADLINE> MARRIAGE ; WITH NO DIVORCE , CHILE VOWS LAST ' UNTIL DECEIT DO US PART '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Divorce , Chilean-style , is a fraudulent affair in which the couple , their lawyers and witnesses lie to a judge who knows they are lying but pretends to believe them . Everyone agrees that the municipal registrar who officiated the marriage_ceremony acted without authority because ( wink ) the bride and groom resided outside his jurisdiction . Thus the marriage is annulled , perhaps many years and many children after the fact . Thousands of such bogus annulments are decreed each year in Chile , one of the few countries in the world that have no law allowing_for divorce . But this year , the issue has become a topic of national debate , and many Chileans are determined that a divorce law will be enacted -- while others are staunchly opposed . The arguments from both sides touch_on the moral fibers of this predominantly Roman_Catholic nation , whose conservative cultural traditions are rapidly changing with economic and social development . Members of the Socialist_Party and the Party for Democracy , which share power in President Eduardo Frei ' s coalition government , are drafting a divorce bill to be submitted to Congress . Their plans have been heralded by blaring fanfare in the press . At the same time , opponents of divorce are conducting their own media campaign , strongly backed by most of the country ' s Catholic bishops . Bishop Orozimbo Fuenzalida of San Bernardo has called_on Catholics to join a prayer crusade of &quot; 500 # 000 rosaries &quot; for the unity and sanctity of marriage . &quot; In our fatherland , the sinister shadow of a divorce law threatens to weaken the sacred matrimonial bond , &quot; Fuenzalida declared . Some church leaders have directed their message to the Congress , urging legislators to reject divorce . Some members of Congress have bridled_at such lobbying . &quot; The church can ' t impose what it thinks on the whole society , &quot; objected Congresswoman Maria Antonieta Saa . In the past , the church ' s position has prevailed . The first divorce bill to be presented in Chile was overwhelmingly defeated in 1914 . Since then , at least 10 other such bills have died . Most recently , several bills presented since the return of democracy after Chile ' s 1973-1990 military dictatorship failed to come_to a vote . But divorce legislation appears to have unprecedented support in the new Congress seated last March . Politicians are aware of public_opinion surveys showing that about 70 % of those polled favor a divorce law . The issue puts Frei ' s Catholic-oriented Christian Democratic Party ( CD ) , formerly a bulwark against divorce legislation , in an especially uncomfortable position . After numerous internal debates , Christian Democratic conclaves have failed to reach agreement either for or against a divorce bill . &quot; Divorce Torments the CD Family , &quot; said a recent headline in the government newspaper La Nacion . Frei said in his presidential campaign last year that a divorce law should be passed if that is what the country asks_for . He has stayed out of the debate this year , but Josefina Bilbao , director of the National Women ' s Service , has said a divorce law &quot; is necessary. &quot; Advocates of a divorce law say it is unjust to deny legal divorce to couples whose marriages have failed , and it is scandalous to substitute divorce with annulments based on obvious perjury . Another subterfuge used by separated Chileans who want to remarry is to complete legal requirements , including publication of public notices , to have their first spouses declared missing and presumed dead . As a result of that practice , many Chileans have found at election time that they could not vote because they were legally deceased . Chileans on Divorce A 1992 poll of Chileans found that 73.5 % of those surveyed said they were Roman_Catholic , and 17.2 % of those Catholics said they attended church regularly -- once a week or more . Of the Catholics surveyed who attended church regularly : * 73 % believed divorce should be legal in some cases . * 24.5 % believed it should never be legal . Source : Cep-Adimark poll .</TEXT>
