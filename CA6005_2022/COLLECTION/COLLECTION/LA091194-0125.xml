   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; HE ' S SWELL ON WHEELS ! ; GERARD MORENO AND OTHER DISABLED ATHLETES BENEFIT FROM INNOVATIVE WHEELCHAIR DESIGNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Off-road wheelchair racer Gerard Moreno launches himself off the starting ramp like a man possessed . Within seconds the West Los Angeles man is bouncing along the hard-pack mountain_trail , careering around turns and plunging down a two-mile obstacle course of blind curves , cliffs , rocks , foot-deep ruts , switchbacks and loose dirt . Roughly six minutes later , at an altitude 1 # 200 feet lower , he hurtles across the finish_line , thrilled by another successful practice run and an improved time . The 37-year-old Moreno , who was paralyzed below the rib_cage in a 1981 gunshot incident , recently put such practice to use , finishing second in the National Off-Road Bicycling Assn. ' s wheelchair division championship . The event was held Aug . 2-28 at the Snow Summit Ski Area in the San Bernardino Mountains . For Moreno , the sport rivals no other . &quot; It ' s almost surrealistic , like you ' re in a dream world , &quot; he said . &quot; You ' re rattling around , flying out of your seat , trying to steer and your hands are numb from holding_on . The wind is whistling through your helmet and your heart is pounding . It can get hairy when you ' re heading for a turn , and your brakes lock_up when you hit some loose terrain . Sometimes I don ' t know if my butt is sliding because I can ' t feel the seat. &quot; Moreno is part of a new breed of wheelchair athletes -- multi-sport competitors who have been liberated by innovative wheelchair designs . Wheelchair riders once encumbered by unwieldy , heavy equipment now use lighter , more versatile contraptions to master such sports as skiing , tennis , basketball , fencing , karate , rugby -- and off-road racing . The new equipment has allowed Moreno to recapture some of the thrills he knew in his other life -- the life he had before Oct . 24 , 1981 . On that night , while he was in the rear of his parents ' Rancho Park home with his girlfriend , two men came_to the back_door saying they were police_officers . Upon entry , one man stuck a gun in Moreno ' s face , while the other ransacked the house . As the gunman tried to rip the jewelry off his girlfriend ' s neck , the family dog charged . &quot; I thought the gunman was strangling my girlfriend and that he was about to shoot the dog , &quot; Moreno said . &quot; It just set me off. &quot; The gunman ' s weapon jammed and both assailants fled . As Moreno chased them from the house , the man with the gun turned and fired . A . 22-caliber bullet entered the left side of Moreno ' s torso , shattering a vertebra and blowing away half his left lung . Moreno immediately lost feeling in his legs and subsequently passed_out . He awoke in the hospital the next day , with tubes in his mouth , nose and beneath his rib_cage . Intravenous tubes dangled from his arms . Three operations later , Moreno hit bottom . Efforts to repair nerve damage to his spinal_cord were unsuccessful . He was paralyzed from the rib_cage down . Months of numbing rehabilitative therapy followed , during which Moreno had to rely_on others to teach him the basics : dressing , cooking , bathing and going_to the bathroom . He was fitted with a colostomy bag for excretions and a catheter to drain urine into another bag . It was quite a comedown for Moreno , who , before his injury , had played_on the Beverly Hills High_School football_team and competed as a pole-vaulter at Cal State Los Angeles . &quot; I was overwhelmed with a feeling of helplessness -- especially being with other people who knew me as an athlete and an independent person , &quot; he said . &quot; But when I saw some of the quadriplegics down the hall , I realized how blessed I was -- I still had my mind and arms . I was determined to become self-sufficient. &quot; Many psychologists say the pace of recovery for patients with traumatic spinal injuries can rely_on such variables as personality , health_insurance coverage , and a loyal support network of friends and family . &quot; The psychological impact is tremendous -- one ' s life is in ruins , &quot; said Dr. Olga Stehlik , a rehabilitative specialist who treated Moreno while he was at the Northridge Hospital Medical_Center . &quot; You need guts and strength to convince yourself that you can have a life without walking . Gerard was a fighter who never gave_up . He was always cooperative and enthusiastic about learning how to move around. &quot; Those paralyzed with spinal injuries must cope_with cramping , muscle spasms , bed sores , loss of bowel control and chronic urinary_tract and rectal infections for months , if not years . Friends sometimes disappear . Families can split apart over trying to provide round-the-clock care . For some , the most difficult moment comes when they leave the hospital . &quot; Many go_through a major identity_crisis over who they are , &quot; said Dr. Sandra Rudnick , a rehabilitative psychologist who runs a weekly support group for quadriplegics and paraplegics at the Northridge Hospital Medical_Center . &quot; First , they are in this rehabilitative womb-like environment for months and then are thrust back into the world where they had previously been ambulatory. &quot; The disabled must then cope_with sundry tasks of daily life that others perform effortlessly : grocery shopping , taking a shower , traveling_to appointments . Rudnick said most patients go_through a major depression , the result of grieving over the loss of what they consider to be their former selves . Many have long bouts of anger . But eventually , as their pain decreases and they regain their ability to function , many patients finally accept their situation . Psychologists marvel at those who can return to and excel in their previous environments , much less take_up off-road wheelchair racing . &quot; These are remarkable people with exceptional drive and tenacity who are at the very top of our population , &quot; Rudnick said . &quot; They are almost like Olympic athletes as compared to the rest of us . They are people who take risks and see in their injuries a challenge that will not defeat them. &quot; By all accounts , Moreno , whose youthful looks and energy belie his 37 years , has rebuilt his life . He lives_in a comfortable two-bedroom house in West Los Angeles with all_the trappings of the good life : a Jacuzzi , a motorboat in the back ( yes , he goes boating too ) , three cats and a dog . The only notable signs of his disability are the ramps affixed to the front and back steps and the special handles in the shower and bathtub . There will be no keeping Moreno away from his 20th-year Beverly Hills High_School class reunion , scheduled for this Saturday . Five years ago Moreno founded his own computer consultant company , Intelligent Software_Systems , which advises businesses about accounting programs . A client , Bill Barlow , owner of Cycle Products West , a West Los Angeles motorcycle parts and accessory store , said Moreno has become an indispensable part of his business . &quot; Paperwork is my weak area and he came_in and computerized my accounting_system , which leaves me free to do my other work , &quot; Barlow said . &quot; He ' s really a computer whiz and I would n ' t be in business without him . I would have run screaming from my building if I had to deal with ( government paperwork ) . &quot; Moreno ' s girlfriend of four years and current live-in , Carol , said that when she first met Moreno , she was never conscious of the wheelchair -- and still isn ' t . &quot; There are so many people who are not physically disabled but have lots of emotional problems , &quot; she said . &quot; Gerard is incredibly balanced and is not really handicapped . we ' ll go_out and I ' ll often forget until we come_to some stairs or an escalator . Those are his only obstacles. &quot; In the summer , Moreno spends much of his time traveling_to various locales to compete against his fellow wheelchair racers and other mountain bikers . His vehicle is the Enduro All Terrain Chair ( ATC ) , and he is a member of the racing team sponsored by the chair ' s manufacturer -- Connecticut-based Wheel Ring Inc. The chair resembles a contraption NASA might have created for lunar exploration . Its titanium frame rests_on four heavy-tread tires similar to those used on mountain_bikes . Like a regular wheelchair , there are two large wheels in the back and two smaller ones in the front . But the 52-pound vehicle also features dual front suspension forks , alloy headsets , an adjustable seat and back , and independent rear drum_brakes . It also comes_with a special steering_mechanism and a multi-position rear axle plate . Over the last year , Wheel Ring has sponsored Moreno and the ATC Enduro racing team ' s five other members in 10 downhill races , held_in Lake Tahoe and in Colorado , Utah and as far away as Kentucky . Many of the disabled competitors also compete in slalom and cross-country races , but the downhill remains their favorite event . Gravity provides the speed , and heading downhill avoids the need for the constant pushing required in cross-country events and the repetitive sharp turns of the slalom . Moreno and his fellow competitors are tanned , with muscular chests and Popeye forearms . On a recent day , during a series of practice runs , a group of them took_a_breather in the Snow Summit parking_area before heading back_up the chairlifts . Matt Feeney , 31 , Moreno ' s chief competitor and the only one in the group who is a fellow Enduro team member , is a world-class disabled ski racer . He was paralyzed in a 1988 cliff-diving accident when a vertebra snapped as he hit the water . The others gathered_in the parking_lot were Tom Ell , 45 , a Long_Beach resident who became a paraplegic 15 years ago while racing in a Motocross competition , and Juan Desales , 29 , who contracted a blood_disease as a teen-ager and lost both legs beneath the knee to gangrene . Desales , a newcomer to the sport , was contemplating a first run_down the mountain . There was an easy camaraderie as the wheelchair athletes traded stories and quips . At one point Feeney suggested that the best way to stop the fast-improving Moreno was to let the air_out of his tires . They tell of taking breathtaking tumbles , or &quot; turtling , &quot; and not knowing if they had suffered any injuries . One time , Moreno did an &quot; endo &quot; -- a head over heels flip off a hay-bale jump . Race officials ran_up and gave him a quick look , propped him in his chair and sent him on his way . &quot; If someone had ( said ) four or five years ago that we would be going_down these courses this fast , no one would have believed it , &quot; said Moreno , who has hit speeds of nearly 50 m.p.h. on his special rig . But , as with any competitive spirit , Moreno still has his frustrations . Despite the success of his recent second-place finish at the Snow Summit downhill races , he was upset at the scheduling of his wheelchair division . Their race was the last of the competition at the end of the day . The audience had drifted away and the trail was riven with deep ruts from the hundreds of previous bicycle runs . An added insult was that Moreno caught_up_with a bicyclist from a previous race and was unable to pass because of the narrow trail , which slowed his time . Brian Stickle , director of competition at NORBA , said his organization meant no harm . &quot; The scheduling was a lack of knowledge on our part , &quot; he said . &quot; We didn ' t realize how fast ( the wheelchair racers ) were going . Hopefully , we can run them in the middle of the day in the future. &quot; A more serious disappointment came a month ago . Wheel Ring had custom-made two enhanced ATC prototypes worth $ 5 # 000 each for Moreno and a friend . The two prized chairs were stolen while chained to the back of a pickup parked at the friend ' s house in Venice . Despite the recent setbacks , Moreno is always planning for the future . He hopes to go soon on a kayaking , water-skiing and para-sailing trip . And there are always new mountains to traverse in his off-road racing career . &quot; My goal is to run neck and neck with the expert downhill bikers , &quot; he said . &quot; We could also use more disabled people out here . . . . They ' re missing out on the thrill of their lives. &quot;</TEXT>
