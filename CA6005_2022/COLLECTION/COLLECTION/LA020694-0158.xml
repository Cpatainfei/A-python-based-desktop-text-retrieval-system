   <TEXT> * I read with great interest your editorial &quot; Make_it a Real Gem , &quot; regarding the development of the Center for Peace and Freedom as an offshoot of the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace . It was suggested that there will be critics who will see this as another move to &quot; rehabilitate the reputation of the fallen president.Whatever shadows remain from the Watergate era , the Nixon presidency is taking_on a far more complex character &quot; with the passage of time , and that &quot; old grudges have subsided. &quot; This representation of Richard Nixon ' s arrogant and deliberate betrayal of the public_trust , which was revealed in the discovery of the Watergate conspiracy and provoked his resignation to avoid impeachment after appointing a successor who agreed to pardon him , exemplifies the degree of success his efforts to rewrite history have achieved . You characterize his Administration as &quot; pragmatic , &quot; not criminal , and label condemnation of his perfidy &quot; old grudges. &quot; Just as with the Holocaust , we must_not forget , as he who does not know history is doomed to repeat it .
