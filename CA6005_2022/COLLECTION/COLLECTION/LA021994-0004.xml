   <HEADLINE> U.S. WARY OF RUSSIA OFFER TO BOSNIA ; BALKANS : MOSCOW ' S PROPOSAL TO SEND 400 TROOPS TO SARAJEVO GETS MIXED RESPONSE . SOME SAY THEIR PRESENCE COULD COMPLICATE ANY NATO DECISION ON AIR STRIKES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With two days left before a deadline for allied air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina , the Clinton_Administration gave a mixed response Friday to Moscow ' s proposal to move Russian troops there , publicly welcoming the initiative but privately expressing concern about the possible effect on efforts to end the siege of Sarajevo . Senior Administration officials publicly sought to put a good face on Russia ' s offer to Bosnian Serbs on Thursday to redeploy 400 peacekeepers to Sarajevo if the rebels would comply with NATO ' s demand that they relocate or surrender their heavy_weapons around the city or face air bombardments . Amid signs that the Serbs were continuing to pull_back some artillery Friday , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry told reporters he was &quot; cautiously , cautiously optimistic about the developments . . . . We among other nations have been requesting the Russians to assist in whatever way they can do to help the Serbs comply with the NATO directive , &quot; he said . In private , however , some U.S. officials conceded that they were apprehensive about any new Russian military presence , particularly about whether Moscow might use its troops to bolster U.N. and Western goals in Bosnia or would seek to protect Serb interests . The presence of troops from Russia -- the Serbs ' historic patron -- near Bosnian Serb artillery sites could complicate any North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization decision on the bombing of those targets . Moscow ' s move , which caught the Administration by surprise , raised the possibility that Russia could become an unpredictable major player in an already tangled and many-sided Bosnian conflict . The United States and other allied nations scrambled on diplomatic fronts Friday to determine Moscow ' s objectives and plans , but answers remained murky . &quot; We expect the Russians will be under U.N operational control , &quot; a senior Administration official said . But the official stopped short of saying that the Russians had committed to follow the lead of the U.N. commander , and signals on this point from Moscow were mixed . Russian peacekeepers could reach Sarajevo within two days , once the United Nations grants a request from Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin to transfer them there from their current base in Croatia , reported the Itar-Tass news_agency , which said Yeltsin had made such a request . In the short term , U.S. officials contended that the surprise move by Moscow was helping the allied cause by sending a clear signal to the Bosnian Serbs that they would have to withdraw or turn_over control of their artillery outside Sarajevo by the deadline of 1 a.m. local_time Monday ( 4 p.m. PST Sunday ) . &quot; We will try to withdraw all_of our weapons by 2400 tomorrow ( midnight today ) , &quot; Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said after meeting with the United Nations ' top official for the former Yugoslav federation , Yasushi Akashi . That would beat by a day the NATO deadline for the heavy guns to be withdrawn or put_under U.N. supervision . Officials also stressed that the Russians , like the Americans , have the most to gain from a peaceful settlement of the crisis in the Bosnian capital because it would allow the two nations to avoid being drawn into positions that would drive a wedge into their relationship . President Clinton is to make a televised address to the nation shortly after 7 a.m. PST today to explain the reasons for the threatened air strikes and to describe how far the Bosnian Serbs have gone_in removing their weapons . The Serbian withdrawal began in_earnest on Thursday and continued on Friday , although not as rapidly as some planners had wished . Under U.N. rules , the Serbs must either pull their artillery back to positions 12 miles outside Sarajevo or place it under U.N. control . U.S. officials , in an apparent effort to spur further action from the Bosnian Serbs , stressed that NATO intended to follow_through on its threats if the terms are not fully met . &quot; The decision was a decision and a deadline is a deadline , &quot; one official said . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said the Serbs had removed at least 50 heavy_weapons and were continuing to take them out . U.S. officials have estimated the Serbs have at least 200 , and possibly as_many as 500 , heavy_weapons around Sarajevo . &quot; It means they have a lot more to take_out ( before the deadline ) , &quot; Christopher said in a CNN interview . &quot; They will pay a very heavy price if they don ' t do it. &quot; The Administration is keeping a low public profile on the question of what the Russians might do_in Bosnia , to avoid pushing Moscow into a corner politically for fear that nationalist pressures at_home could propel them to support the Serbs more aggressively . Rep . Lee H . Hamilton ( D-Ind. ) , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , said a new Russian presence would &quot; add a complicating factor. &quot; But he added that because of Russia ' s influence with the Serbs , &quot; on balance , it ' s positive. &quot; Hamilton said Russia ' s proposal also demonstrated a more aggressive foreign_policy &quot; that we ' ve already been seeing in other areas. &quot; Helmut Sonnenfeldt , a former U.S. official now with the Brookings Institution , predicted that the Russians &quot; are going_to want to be sort of lawyers for the Serbs. &quot; With their role hard to guess now , &quot; it isn ' t going_to be easy to deal with them , &quot; he said . Russian troops already have been criticized elsewhere in the former Yugoslav federation , Sonnenfeldt noted . Some that were supposedly under U.N. control in Croatia have been accused of allowing the removal of arms from Croatian warehouses . Clinton ' s top national security advisers met for two hours Friday to discuss the Bosnian situation and other issues but announced no major new actions . Perry is scheduled to fly to Aviano air_base in Italy late today for a last-minute meeting with NATO defense ministers to reaffirm the allies ' intentions . A U.S. official said the group &quot; will leave no doubt that &quot; the allies plan to enforce the NATO withdrawal order . The 16-country organization has hundreds of planes on aircraft_carriers and at bases in Italy ready to attack . To comply with the War Powers Act , Clinton sent Congress a letter Friday explaining his actions in Bosnia . The letter noted that NATO ' s orders not only give it authority to strike artillery positions , but also the flexibility to hit Serbian air_defenses threatening NATO aircraft . The letter also points_out that &quot; it is not now possible to determine the length of these operations. &quot; As U.S. officials were giving credit to Clinton for the progress in Sarajevo , the Kremlin ' s diplomatic point_man on Yugoslavia , Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin , was praising Russia for persuading the Serbs to pull_back . Churkin , speaking in Moscow , noted with pride that &quot; Russia is now playing a central role &quot; in the peacemaking attempts . On another front , Yeltsin sent letters to Clinton and the leaders of France , Britain , Italy and Germany expressing concern that air strikes in Bosnia could lead to &quot; unpredictable events &quot; and possibly a broader war . According to the Italian newspaper La Stampa , the letter spoke_of worries &quot; not only in Russia but in all_the world &quot; that NATO wants &quot; to pursue designs of dominance. &quot; At the United Nations , a spokesman said Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali &quot; is delighted &quot; at the Russian offer to move 400 of its peacekeeping troops from Croatia to Sarajevo . Joe Sills , the spokesman , described the offer as a response to a request for help made to many governments by Lt . Gen . Michael Rose of Britain , the U.N. commander in Sarajevo . Times staff writers Carey Goldberg in Moscow and Art Pine , Norman Kempster , Doyle McManus and Stanley Meisler in Washington contributed to this report . * PULLBACK OVERSTATED : The withdrawal of Serb forces from around Sarajevo has been overstated , the U.N. says .
