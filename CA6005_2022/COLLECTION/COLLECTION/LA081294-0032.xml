   <HEADLINE> KURT WALDHEIM : PAPAL KNIGHT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last month , Pope John Paul II awarded a papal knighthood , the Order of Pius IX , to former Austrian President and onetime U.N. Secretary_General Kurt Waldheim . The action , which took_place in Vienna rather than in Rome , was not noted in the usual Vatican bulletins and is only now receiving wide notice . Waldheim became an international pariah when his wartime collaboration with the Nazis came_to_light . A panel of historians commissioned by his own government to investigate his record concluded that he &quot; repeatedly went_along with unlawful acts &quot; and that his claim that he knew_nothing about deportation of Greek and Yugoslav civilians to Nazi death camps could not be believed . The U.S. Justice_Department , as it put Waldheim on a not-welcome list , stated that he was implicated &quot; in ( wartime ) acts which clearly constitute persecution under established legal precedent. &quot; In 1987 , the Pope ' s decision merely to grant Waldheim an audience became a scandal . At the time , Vatican spokesmen insisted that there was nothing personal about this decision : The Pope was simply following protocol in receiving the president of a country that the pontiff had visited . That explanation , scarcely credible at the time , has lost all credibility now . Whatever justification there was for receiving Waldheim , there is none for honoring him , even for his U.N. work . Had his collaboration been known , he would never have been appointed to any high-ranking U.N. post . The papal action is particularly inflammatory just now because of longstanding Serbian claims that the Croatian Catholic clergy collaborated with the Nazis in persecuting the Serbs . The Pope ' s action is baffling , to say the least . Israel , which protested , was right to do so . The United States should protest as well . And Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles should at least privately make the Vatican aware of the local impact of this action . After the scandal of the 1987 meeting , a group of Los Angeles Jewish and Catholic leaders headed by Rabbi Alfred Wolf and Msgr . Royale M . Vadakin , representing Cardinal Mahony , worked hard to repair relations . The Vatican , with this new incomprehensible action , has now made_good Catholic-Jewish relations that much harder to maintain .</TEXT>
