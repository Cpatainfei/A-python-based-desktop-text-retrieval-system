   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OJAI VALLEY ; LOCAL MORMONS RE-ENACT TREK BY ANCESTORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sweat pouring off his brow , 16-year-old Clint Reynolds wedged his thin body behind the wooden handcart ' s thick handle Friday and pushed mightily up the mountain ' s dirt road , simulating what his Mormon ancestors had done 150 years before on their great trek west . &quot; It had to have been hard , &quot; said Clint , panting heavily , sun beating_down on him , as he pushed the heavily loaded cart up a sharp incline alongside two other teen-agers . &quot; Just going_up this hill is hard . And they didn ' t have some of the trails that we have. &quot; Clint and 152 other Mormon teen-agers from the Camarillo , Oxnard and Port Hueneme areas took_part in the Mormon Youth Conference Pioneer Trek organized by the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints . The seven-mile hike_up Sulphur Mountain Road near Ojai , organizers said , was meant to teach young Mormons about the fierce struggle their ancestral pioneers undertook traveling west across the planes to Salt Lake Valley . Family and friends were purposefully split_up on the hike to promote new friendships , organizers said . Hikers were placed into groups of about 10 , each group adopting the name and history of an actual 1800s Mormon family that had come west . Each of the &quot; families &quot; pushed a large handcart full of survival supplies . Participants came dressed in 1800s garb , trying their best to simulate the rough times of their ancestors , although some modern-day comforts did sneak by , such_as a_few small electric_fans and some beepers . Standard dress for the day included women in long skirts wearing flower-patterned bonnets -- which pioneer women had worn to protect them from the sun . Men donned long pants , vests , cowboy_hats and anachronistic tennis_shoes . &quot; Let ' s pull our families together here ! Let ' s stick_together , &quot; bellowed Corky Clevenger , 36 , as young bodies started to tire . &quot; We wanted ( the teen-agers ) to understand the pioneer heritage and get the feel of what their forefathers felt coming_across the plains , &quot; Clevenger said as silver and turquoise decorations hanging from his vest jingled . &quot; We hope they can learn that even when things are difficult , if you just hold strong , you can persevere. &quot; The teen-age hikers seemed well aware of their ancestors ' westward journeys . In seminary classes before the trek , they learned about how the western treks were launched in 1847 after Joseph_Smith , the founder of the Mormon religion , was killed . And about how Brigham Young then led followers away from religious persecution in Nauvoo , Ill. , to Salt Lake Valley . &quot; We should be lucky we didn ' t have it as hard as they did , &quot; said Julie Lovstedt , 17 , of Oxnard . &quot; They had to cross frozen rivers , they had people dying around them . Our cart died , but we ' re still alive. &quot; JASON GRANT</TEXT>
