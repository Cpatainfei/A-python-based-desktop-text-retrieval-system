   <HEADLINE> NATIONHOOD ON MIND OF BELARUS VOTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the eve of presidential elections that may determine if this nation remains independent , the editor of its largest newspaper complained about the new red-and-white flag . &quot; It ' s too nationalistic , &quot; said Igor N . Osinsky , editor of Sovietskaya Belarossiya . Nor does the 700-year-old heraldic mounted knight , recently retrieved from history ' s dustbin , inspire the editor to patriotism . &quot; We don ' t like warlike symbols , &quot; he said . &quot; No one knows who that armed horseman is , or where he ' s going. &quot; Where indeed ? Belarus has tried its hand at independence for three years , and many citizens think it just isn ' t working_out . Voters today will elect the country ' s first president . Six candidates are running -- four pro-Russian Communists and two independence-minded nationalists who back free-market reform . The main issue that divides them is Prime_Minister Vyacheslav Kebich ' s plan to abandon the Belarussian currency , return to the Russian ruble and let Moscow control its former subject ' s monetary policy . &quot; We are actually heading toward a sort of annexation ( by Russia ) , and I cannot agree to it , &quot; said Stanislav Shushkevich , 60 , the former Belarussian leader who is running against his old subordinate Kebich for the presidency . While nationalist movements raged in other former Soviet republics , Belarus had only a token independence movement . But in August , 1991 , Belarus ' 10 million citizens suddenly found themselves in an independent nation the size of Utah , wedged between Poland , Russia and Ukraine , as well as Latvia and Lithuania . Kebich , who took_over from Shushkevich in January , is considered the front-runner , trailed by Alexander Lukashenko , a gravel-voiced collective_farm chief who has made a name as a corruption fighter . Last week , Minsk was turned upside down when Lukashenko accused Kebich of trying to have him killed . &quot; A foreign-made car flew past us and fired two shots into the back seat , where I was sitting , &quot; Lukashenko told reporters Saturday . &quot; I ' m convinced it was Kebich. &quot; The government says Lukashenko concocted the assassination attempt to get attention . &quot; It ' s a pretty obvious hoax , &quot; said security spokesman Pyotr Snopok . Until this feud , Kebich , 58 , and Lukashenko , 40 , had been considered allies . Both back the monetary union with Russia that was signed_in April and awaits ratification by both countries ' parliaments . Belarus last year reluctantly introduced its own currency , but its ruble is a sore spot . Everyone calls it &quot; the rabbit , &quot; because the baby blue one-ruble note sports a smiling hare in mid-leap . There are also green three-ruble beavers and pale pink half-ruble squirrels . The rabbit isn ' t worth much . In the past three months alone , it has lost three-quarters of its value against the American dollar and the Russian ruble . Meanwhile , prices here have risen 21-fold in the past year , while industrial output is half what it was in Soviet days . Belarussians attribute their economy ' s collapse to Russia ' s new policy of making them pay full price for oil . In Soviet days , Belarus ' factories were fed a steady diet of cheap energy and materials . Today , Russia still gives some energy subsidies to domestic factories , but foreigners like the Belarussians are charged world market_prices . Monetary union with Russia would change that . Belarus would be offered raw_materials at cheaper , Russian prices . Citizens would also be allowed to swap weak rabbits for stronger Russian rubles at a rate of one to one -- a steal given today ' s rate of 12 rabbits per ruble . Shushkevich , who as chairman of the Supreme Soviet ran Belarus for two years before Kebich allies ousted him in January , said Kebich seeks union with Russia to hide his mismanagement of the economy . Shushkevich and Zenon Poznyak -- a dissident famous for his grim determination to catalogue crimes of the Stalin era -- are the only candidates who actively oppose the ruble-zone treaty . Kebich calls them Belarussian nationalists and says either ' s election would bring discord and civil_war .</TEXT>
