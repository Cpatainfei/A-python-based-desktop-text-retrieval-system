   <HEADLINE> MORE THAN 121 # 000 QUAKES SINCE 1987 ; GEOLOGY : ABOUT 2 # 700 SOUTHLAND TEMBLORS HAVE BEEN MAGNITUDE 3.0 OR GREATER , SCIENTISTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In one of the most comprehensive earthquake inventories to date , scientists from Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey reported Monday that more_than 121 # 000 quakes have been recorded in Southern California since the beginning of 1987 . A little more_than 2 # 700 have been magnitude 3.0 or greater and thus could be felt at least by people living_in the vicinity where they occurred . This works_out to an average of about one earthquake felt somewhere in the region every day . But some areas are more active than others . There have been more_than 53 # 000 aftershocks from the 1992 Landers-Big Bear earthquakes and nearly 9 # 000 aftershocks from the Jan . 17 Northridge quake . In the last eight years , the smallest number of quakes recorded in any one year was 7 # 961 in 1991 . When big earthquakes occur , the number rockets upward as thousands of aftershocks occur . In 1992 , 49 # 981 earthquakes , including aftershocks , were recorded in Southern California -- in an area bounded by the Colorado_River on the east , the Mexican border_on the south , the offshore islands on the west and Lone Pine and Coalinga on the north . Most of those earthquakes were too weak to feel . But 1 # 707 earthquakes that were at least magnitude 3.0 and could be felt by people living_in their vicinity were recorded in 1992 . The figures released Monday were compiled from instruments of the Southern California Seismographic Network by scientists Kate Hutton and Egill Hauksson of Caltech and Lucile M . Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey . They said that virtually all detectable earthquakes were included in the data . However , no matter how refined the seismological network , some quakes are too small to be registered by any station on the network . The scientists reported that more_than 8 # 750 jolts have stemmed from the Northridge quake , including 381 aftershocks registering between 3.0 and 3.9 , 48 between 4.0 and 4.9 and eight -- including the main shock -- 5.0 or stronger . As for Landers , now calculated by Hutton , Hauksson and Jones as a magnitude 7.3 main shock , there have been 53 # 040 jolts , including 1 # 458 aftershocks registering between 3.0 and 3.9 , 156 between 4.0 and 4.9 , and 21 , including the main shock , 5.0 or stronger . A 4.8 Landers aftershock was recorded 28 miles northeast of Lucerne Valley at 2:34 p.m. Monday . The scientists reported 11 # 684 earthquakes in 1987 , 11 # 295 in 1988 , 9 # 538 in 1989 , 9 # 311 in 1990 , 7 # 961 in 1991 , 49 # 981 in 1992 , including the 1 # 707 of at least 3.0 , 19 # 404 in 1993 and 18 # 110 thus far in 1994 , including 523 of at least 3.0. &quot; The overall rate at which aftershocks occur depends strongly on the magnitude of the main shock , and the Landers sequence is almost exactly average for its size , &quot; the scientists said . &quot; The Northridge sequence has more aftershocks than the average for a main shock of ( its size ) . . . but still far less than Landers because the Northridge main shock was much smaller. &quot;</TEXT>
