   <TEXT> Making money last is not just a problem for holiday shoppers . The U.S. Department_of_the_Treasury ' s Bureau of Engraving and Printing would like paper_currency to stay in circulationlonger . Along with a major overhaul of the design of U.S. currency next year , the Treasury hopes to improve its quality . A study led by Raymond A . Young , a University of Wisconsin at Madison forestry professor , has found a way to stretch the wallet-life of the greenback . The main problem with aging bills is the tendency of ink to fade or wear_off . The Madison study found that treating currency paper with gaseous materials known as plasmas not only significantly improved the paper ' s ability to absorb and hold ink , but did not produce any visible changes on the surface of the paper . Plasma-aided manufacturing involves the use of electrically charged particles to produce new materials with unusual and superior properties . The plasmas are formed by adding a gas to an electrical field , which causes the gas molecules to split apart and form radically new compounds . The process is already used in a number of ways , including treating automobile parts to improve the adhesion of paint and for etching more precise semiconductors . The researchers tried_out three different gases -- oxygen , silicon tetrachloride and carbon tetrafluoride -- for the currency-treating plasma . The first two gases worked fine . Unfortunately , the carbon tetrafluoride created a Teflon-like coating , making the paper totally impenetrable to ink . The Treasury hopes that plasma-treated currency paper will not only last longer , but might help foil counterfeiters too . Do You See What I See : In the classic Japanese film &quot; Rashomon , &quot; viewers grapple with the question of why the characters remember different and often mutually_exclusive details about the same scene . Neuroscientists have also wrestled with this question . And a new study published by researchers from the University of California at Davis , and Otto von Guericke Technical College in Magdenburg , Germany , provides at least a partial answer . The team found that the way an individual brain registers and processes visual information depends_on where the person was directing his attention . Paying_attention to one part of a complex scene effectively boosts those visual brain signals while weakening signals from other parts of the scene . This selective attention keeps us focused_on the most important items at the moment -- say , the road ahead when we ' re driving -- but may cause us to miss a stop sign_on the side of the road . The study showed that selective attention kicks_in as fast as 80 milliseconds after the retina at the back of the eyeball sends an exact copy of the visual world to the brain for processing . The selected images receive enhanced visual processing . The results of the study are important in efforts to eventually diagnose and treat neurological_diseases and disorders . But they may also have practical_applications for human performance . Airplane cockpits , for example , are already designed to incorporate knowledge about where we focus attention . A better understanding of selective attention would help prevent perceptual failures during the highly demanding tasks required of the pilot . Blood Bubbles : Many organizations , including pharmaceutical companies , the U.S. Department_of_Defense and the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , have been seeking substitutes for blood . The substitutes have several advantages over the human kind : They have a longer shelf_life , they don ' t carry diseases like AIDS , and they don ' t have a &quot; type &quot; that renders them useless for some people . But the only blood substitute currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , Fluosol-DA 20 % , can carry only a quarter of the oxygen that whole blood can . Now researchers at the University of Illinois have come_up with a substitute that carries 50 % more oxygen than is carried by the same volume of whole blood . The substitute was created by beaming ultrasound waves on the surface of a water solution containing hemoglobin . The waves inject small bursts of air into the protein solution , creating a froth . The heat generated by the sound_waves also creates hot spots in the liquid , intense enough to break the chemical_bonds of the water . The elements so produced react with the amino-acid residues on the surface of the hemoglobin molecules , linking them into spherical bubbles roughly 50 times smaller in diameter than a human hair . These bubbles satisfy the main criteria for red-blood-cell substitutes : They bind to oxygen molecules in the lungs and efficiently unload oxygen in the tissues . And they remain chemically stable for months when kept cool . While the tiny bubbles are half the size of red_blood_cells , they are not so small that they cause damage to the kidneys or other organs the way the smaller proteins of most earlier substitutes did . The substitute has not yet been tested in mammals , though , and thus is still some years away from being available .</TEXT>
