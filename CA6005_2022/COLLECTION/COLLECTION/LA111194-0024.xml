   <HEADLINE> POETIC JUSTICE ; HEATHER MCHUGH AND DAVID ST . JOHN HAVE LABORED IN OBSCURITY ON THE WEST COAST FOR YEARS.BUT NOT ANY LONGER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just how poetic is the life of the poet ? For a modern-day bard , poet Kenneth Rexroth summed it up quite succinctly : &quot; Against the ruin of the world , there is only one defense -- the creative act. &quot; Fine-tuning the precise architecture of the long line , intricately crafting little worlds -- literary dioramas -- the best of poets magnify the briefest of passing moments , dissect the most minute exchange . The prize : the larger , lasting value . But for the greater world , the pursuit of poetry in this day and age at best appears noble ; at the other end , charmingly anachronistic . Voices that historically have spoken_for entire societies , or been lauded as the filament inciting movements , nowadays seldom reap the grand rewards of the best-seller list . And even with the hot revival of the cafe poetry movement , the quaint world of the poet still appears remote and rarefied . Ironically , far from the East Coast literary locus , poets David St . John of USC and Heather McHugh , currently of UCLA , might beg to differ . In their creative act , they have raged and won . They are two of the five nominees for this year ' s National Book Award in poetry . McHugh , 46 , is visiting professor at UCLA this quarter , part of her Milliman Writer-in-Residence position at the University of Washington in Seattle . She is a finalist for her collection &quot; Hinge &amp; Sign -- Poems , 1968-1993 &quot; ( Wesleyan / New England , 1994 ) . Editor of the Antioch Review , St . John , 45 , grew_up in Fresno and is a professor of creative writing at USC , where he has taught for eight years . Awarded fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation , as well as the Prix de Rome Fellowship in Literature , St . John is nominated for his collection &quot; Study for the World ' s Body &quot; ( HarperCollins , 1994 ) . The honor further animates two hale careers , both would agree . For West Coast poets in the margins , it is more_than simply another tasteful validation of their accomplishments , and the importance of their addition to the canon . The National Book Awards , to be presented in black-tie pomp Wednesday at New York ' s Plaza Hotel , are known among literati as the Oscars of the publishing world . * But all_the fuss upsets the orderly quiet of the writing life -- the silent room , the good pen , the blank page . &quot; The whole_thing is something very unlike a poet ' s life , &quot; cracks McHugh , sitting in a Westwood Cafe with a bag of manuscripts the size of a week ' s worth of groceries , periodically eyeing election returns . &quot; You spend your life sort of eavesdropping . That is , you get_to be the one at the next table who has kind impulses , or will not use the information in any damaging way , but is very curious about how human_being is . That , for me , was the whole thing. &quot; McHugh remembers . &quot; I was incredibly shy . I never talked until I was 16 . Finally , in senior_high_school in English_class , I said something . . . and then just what I feared happened , &quot; she pauses , eyes opened wide behind teal-framed glasses . &quot; Everybody turned_around and looked . The dream was really to be invisible and love the visible at the same time. &quot; That attention startles even those less easily rattled . &quot; Most of all I ' ve been really stunned by the response from other poets , &quot; says David St . John over a whistling Santa Monica wind and steaming cup of cappuccino at a sidewalk cafe hidden on the quieter fringes of Main_Street . His voice is soft , yet textured . A good storytelling voice . A lover of words , he carefully enunciates each syllable , sparingly lending those with more import the assistance of his hands . &quot; Notes from poets . People I know casually and haven ' t heard from in many years just saying that they wanted me to know how important my work had always been to them . . . writers who I like , but haven ' t talked to . . . . Just that they would take that time and make that gesture , that the work has presence and relevance , is really the most important thing. &quot; Although St . John fancies the erotic tension crackling through interpersonal relationships ( &quot; What goes_on between men and women in this world fascinates me endlessly &quot; ) , much of the work found in the earlier pages of &quot; Study &quot; wades through the taut emotional landscape of loss and abandonment -- tests the limits of memory . The page becomes emulsion , slowly resurrects the form of a person , or a fragment of remembrance . But what might at face seem simply a tango of want and need is inhabited by much more . The muted power of the particular was something that St . John explored at the prestigious Iowa Writers Workshop . Beyond the architecture of language , or workshop-speak , St . John began to understand something about the soul that informs the vessel -- the soul being the poet ; the vessel , the verse . An International Writers Workshop , also at Iowa , brought St . John into contact with authors who temporarily re-rooted their lives , arriving from Africa , Europe , South_America with their trunks , poems and life_stories . Apart from exotic tales of struggle on distant terrain , what most impressed him was a maturity of expression that St . John hadn ' t noted in the poems that crossed his desk as editor of the Iowa Review , or in sessions for critique . &quot; For me it had been a window on the relationship between a kind of political consciousness and how it enters poetry in other cultures , &quot; says St . John . &quot; It also made me very impatient with a kind of political playacting of many American poets . . . seeing these men and women , say , from China or Eastern Europe , who knew that they were being spied on constantly . What was fascinating to me was . . . even when their work had no overt political agenda , it was so brilliantly an enactment of the voice of individuality and freedom . It really made me think_twice about the American poets who had sort of put_on a particular political attitude as if it were a coat that could be taken_off and changed with whatever the political season or fashion was. &quot; The encounter , St . John believes , drastically rewrote his ideas about &quot; political &quot; poetry , how the world is seen and how it is &quot; made into language. &quot; &quot; One of the things that happens is that poems have to be understood not as objects , but as experience . &quot; And thus , St . John has whittled_away this artful distinction : A good poem &quot; is a poem that enacts in language as if the page were its own little stage . Whatever its particular concern is . Nobody wants to be told about anything . Nobody wants to be told how to feel . . . . You have to allow the reader to be part of what it is that you are concerned about . To feel it themselves. &quot; * Despite its acute powers of revelation , the poet ' s voice , McHugh fears , resounds more like thunder on the wane . As she reflects in &quot; Blue Streak &quot; : And the poets , who should have spoken_for us , were busy panning landscape , gunning their electrics , going I-I-I-I-I But of the medium , she keeps her good_humor . &quot; When I speak_to classes , people always ask me , ' Where is poetry going ? ' -- To Chicago ? &quot; McHugh suggests with a laugh , then leans forward into the thought . Talk_about language warms her , the thoughts shoot_up in luminous images , metaphors -- like a film montage . As a poet , she says , &quot; it ' s not about knowing , it ' s about being . You just become a recorder of being -- but being in its most affecting or most revealing moments. &quot; At its best , poetry embodies the act of persistently taking a reader down foreign roads . &quot; To be startled is sort of what you want in the arts , &quot; says McHugh . &quot; People come at it from different angles . People are startled when Michael Jordan does a great shot . It ' s the moment that the thing gets beyond us , when you get beyond yourself , and the reader participates in it . And that ' s why we like to read . To get beyond our limits. &quot; Part of stretching the limits is learning to broaden our definitions and perceptions of poetry . &quot; Americans are sentimental by nature and poetry can get quite sentimental , &quot; she observes . &quot; That is almost the lay person ' s view of what poetry is . It accompanies the Whitman Sampler . The poems I like least are the poems that want to say : ' This is a sweet world . . . . ' It ' s like singles ads : 100 people saying , ' I want the only other person on Earth who likes candle-lit dinners , wine by the fireplace and a walk on the beach. ' To me that ' s boring . &quot; The interesting thing to me is the thing a person sees that no one else can see . For me that ' s the fresh , informing moment . But how to discover that in us ? I ' m really interested in the strangeness . The strangeness of being alive . Not the thing I want to hear . Not the Good Heaven . I ' m more interested in the strange because it strikes me as probably truer. &quot; * The craft survives , pushes_on in various guises , as does the impetus fueling it . Although there are purists who wring their hands at the very suggestion of the scruffy , rough-and-tumble cafe poetry scene with its poetry slams and open mikes , that tenacity St . John sees as prime evidence of the written_word ' s fluidity . &quot; I have a lot of friends who really object to the coffeehouse scene . . . who feel that it is just sort of an exercise in indulgence , &quot; says St . John . &quot; My own feeling is . . . I ' m for any occasion when people try to join what they ' re thinking and feeling to language. &quot; St . John translates it as a coming-of-age process : The journey toward self-discovery should include pressing toward new language &quot; that ' s separate from the official language they ' ve been given by their culture and their parents. &quot; The problem is , &quot; the way we use language in our daily lives is completely pragmatic and it is also reductive , and it ' s therefore antithetical to everything poetry wants to do . The world is frozen by its names. &quot; Aside from breaking_down artificial barriers , distinctions , if a poet has a singular mission , it is this : &quot; To free the world from the names that have petrified it . This is what a poem is . A poem is a little model of consciousness . It ' s how someone sees the world made in language . &quot; And so that is what I try to tell ( my students ) . What we don ' t have , especially in our culture , is a vocabulary to talk_about the things that matter_to us most . So it ' s trying to help these students begin to locate . . . a kind of poetic language and poetic voice , that they can begin to represent some idea of themselves that is themselves. &quot;</TEXT>
