   <TEXT> He was just back from one of the world ' s longest and most famous expeditions . He ' d seen it all : the deaths of the heroes , the fall of Troy . At home , he trod the purple of a royal welcome , but shook his head : &quot; The mortal cannot go fearless through these many-coloured beauties , &quot; he said , or at least that ' s how Aeschylus ' version has it . Sure enough , a_few moments later his wife was axing him to death . . . . But Agamemnon was wrong . You can go fearless through those beauties , or watch other people going_through them . You can see handsome Vietnamese children crossing dangerous rivers on nothing more_than an elegant tracery of bamboo poles suspended 20 feet above . You can watch an Israeli teacher toting a machine_gun as he takes a group of little_girls on a spring hike along the Jordan . You can admire a Bombay prostitute as she giggles in her shack , beautiful as Helen , though unlikely to be launching any ships ( the photographer records a blind beggar stumbling by , a dirty yellow grating , then passes_on ) . Or you can see the smiling faces of the Challenger crew and the explosion that blew them to bits a_few moments later . That was the trip you don ' t need to envy anybody . And in the bizarre royal palaces of India , the villas of Tuscany , the stately homes of London and of Dublin , you can see how other generations before us enjoyed contemplating other images of life ' s many-colored beauties and dangers . Frescoed horses seem to explode from Cinquecento ceiling for the rape of young Persephone . In the Rajput fort a Kota , princess and maharajah ride after a great black boar in the center of a mural that whirls with boats and elephants and wrestlers and dancers and . . . . You ' re looking_at the pick of the new photo-books out for Christmas . They can take you anywhere , show you anything , with no risk whatsoever , unless perhaps to your bank balance . But in return for your 40 or 50 or 90 dollars , the quality of these books -- their print and design and paper -- is superb . And they give you a sense of quiet contemplative control you will never get from TV or video . You can touch the pages ' grainy or glossy surfaces , examine them under different lights , savor their extraordinary colors , meditate on other lands , other lives . . . . Some of the crop are better than others . The Smithsonian Institute ' s huge history of space exploration contrives to be at once lavish and dull , packed with pictures you ' ve seen before and tedious reflections of the value-for-money conundrum and NASA ' s approach to the press . How much more rich and exotic are the human scenes of Rick Smolan ' s Passage to Vietnam : a girl sitting on a buffalo under heavy rain , a group of half-naked fishermen walking through the surf on stilts , a woman leaning into her oars as she crosses the Mekong at twilight . This is one place I must go some day . Almost all_the books have a problem with their texts . They are too long , too factual , too determinedly informative . I shall gloat for hours over the magnificent Villas of Tuscany , its wonderful , wonderful gardens , grottoes , gazebos , but I ' m hanged if I shall read more_than a page or two or its dry stilted prose . Likewise the people who put_together the fine images of A Day in the Life of Israel could have spared us the condescending tone of their comments and the visual irritation of having to see a famous photographer ' s name in bold block_capitals under every single picture . But the poverty of the writing perhaps alerts us to why we buy these books . At the simplest level , their images satisfy our atavistic fantasies of escape . Therein lies their commercial success . But as if this were somehow unhealthy , their texts seek to disguise the fact . With their plodding research and mountains of worthy information , they seek to reassure us that we have not wasted our money on a mere collection of photos . And perhaps we are reassured . Perhaps we don ' t want to admit , even to ourselves , that we are not really interested in the fact that the Mekong is 2 # 000 miles long and splits into nine separate channels before emptying into the South_China_Sea . The text becomes an alibi for what really fascinates us : the expression of grit and hope on this woman ' s face as she thrusts her boat forward , the wonderful precariousness of human beauty in wide open water under lowering skies . For the irony is that the photos need no apology . In an essay on myth in this month ' s edition of Artes , the Italian writer Roberto Calasso remarks on the gap between written commentaries and pictorial illustrations of Ovid . The scholars debunk the myths , explain them away in scientific , sociological terms . Paintings and sculptures endorse and exalt them , keep their ancient intuitions alive and potent . Something of the same gulf opens_up in these books . For as we surrender our fantasy to their images , thinking to escape , so they begin to speak_to us with directness beyond anything in the text , offering a knowledge that goes_far deeper : a particular way men and women have of being together , an intimate sense of our place in the landscape . Perhaps this is why the best of these books is the only one that has the courage not to include any text : Raghubir Singh ' s Bombay . Seething with a life that comes_together for just that fraction of a second the shutter clicks , his images have a perilous luminous fullness about them , an awareness and wit that goes_far beyond any political or social comment on the city he is photographing . I pick_up another book from the floor . Here is a man on a camel speaking into a mobile phone . Here is a newborn ' s crib , plastered with images of bearded rabbis , here a Bedouin shepherdess , mouth covered by her head-scarf . In a time when PC is just the tip of a great iceberg of orthodoxy , it seems there is a sort of knowledge only images can convey . Over a grim lunar landscape an astronaut photographs a splendidly blue and pink planet hanging_in the sky . It is the earth , Agamemnon ' s earth after all , many-colored , beautiful , treacherous .
