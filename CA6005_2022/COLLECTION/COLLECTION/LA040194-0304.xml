   <HEADLINE> SUIT FILED OVER TROUBLED ' JACKSON FAMILY ' BENEFIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Emmy-winning producer Gary Smith filed a lawsuit Thursday against Jackson family members charging fraud and breach_of_contract in connection with the financially troubled &quot; Jackson Family Honors &quot; musical benefit . The 30-page complaint filed on behalf of Smith-Hemion Productions Inc. in Los Angeles County Superior_Court alleges that Jackson family-affiliated firms refused to pay an estimated $ 2 million in outstanding bills and misrepresented information regarding past debts that allegedly jeopardized the fiscal state of the production . Ten family members are named individually as defendants , including superstar Michael Jackson , as well as the family ' s Jackson Communications Inc. and Jackson Jubilee , plus Transworld International , the firm that negotiated the foreign broadcast rights . The Jackson firms , the complaint said , are &quot; mere shell_corporations &quot; and that they and their shareholders are responsible_for &quot; the commingling of personal assets and funds. &quot; &quot; Never in my entire career have I had to deal with such an unprofessional mess as this , &quot; said Smith , producer of the telecast who along his partner Dwight Hemion has won five Emmys since 1962 . &quot; The Jacksons asked me to hire people to work_on their show and now , six weeks later , they refuse to pay them . And frankly , they ' ve been very arrogant about it . This is an extremely difficult step for me to take , but the Jacksons have left me no choice but to sue. &quot; Smith ' s suit alleges that the Jacksons pledged the same funds raised from ticket proceeds and foreign broadcast fees to at least two separate entities . It also alleges that members of the Jackson entourage charged $ 69 # 000 in expenditures for wardrobe and room service at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas where the Feb . 19 musical benefit was taped to be aired three days later on NBC-TV . Jermaine Jackson , executive producer of the show and president of Jackson Communications Inc. , said he had not seen a copy of the suit , but denied the allegations . &quot; For Gary Smith to sue us is unjust and unfair , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; For him to say we are arrogant is very unprofessional . But what ' s new ? It ' s just another dagger being thrown at the Jacksons in public. &quot; The suit also alleges that Michael Jackson has failed to pay Smith-Hemion $ 110 # 000 for tickets he purchased and claims that the event ' s financial problems stem in part from the superstar ' s refusal to appear at the special ' s originally scheduled date of Dec . 11 in Atlantic_City . The show was postponed after Jackson fled to Europe in November to reportedly treat a drug_addiction that he said stemmed in part from a 13-year-old ' s allegations of sexual molestation . A series of complications resulted , including the loss of corporate sponsorships , debts incurred by postponing and moving the event to Las Vegas and slow ticket sales . Since the event , financial disputes over possible ticket refunds have tied_up concert proceeds and revenues from foreign broadcast fees are still forthcoming . Representatives for Michael and Janet Jackson said the two superstars had nothing to do with the event ' s finances .</TEXT>
