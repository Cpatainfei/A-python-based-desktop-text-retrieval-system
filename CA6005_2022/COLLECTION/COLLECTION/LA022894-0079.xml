   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS ; ALBERTO TIES UP SOME LOOSE ENDS WITH A SILVER THREAD ; ALPINE SKIING : TOMBA GOES_OUT IN STYLE WITH SUPER SECOND RUN IN SLALOM . HE LOSES GOLD MEDAL TO AUSTRIA ' S STANGASSINGER BY 0.75 SECONDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What Alberto Tomba may lack in grace he certainly makes_up for in race , with a flair for the dramatic that borders_on unworldly , even if it is sometimes a byproduct of_his_own miscalculation . Tomba ' s magnetism on a ski slope is such_that the lasting image of Sunday ' s slalom at Hafjell will not be of the stoic , calculating Austrian , Thomas Stangassinger , in victory , but rather a seat-of-the-pants Italian from Bologna , in defeat . The record will show that Stangassinger took the gold with a two-run time of 2 minutes 2.02 seconds , that Tomba won the silver , 0.75 seconds behind , and that Slovenia ' s Jure Kosir claimed the bronze . It will proclaim that Tomba , competing in his last Olympic race , was knocked to the slalom canvas with the 12th-fastest first run ( 1:02.84 ) , and had Stangassinger on the ropes at the final bell after a second run of 59.33 seconds . Tomba made_up 1.69 seconds on the Austrian with a hair-raising second run that was almost a classic rerun of his Olympic slalom charge two years earlier at Albertville , where he made_up 1.30 seconds on Norway ' s Finn Christian Jagge , only to fall 0.28 short of the gold . Paul Casey Puckett , an unsung American who finished seventh , a stunning result for him , won ' t forget to record Sunday in his race diary , either . &quot; I would say he was the most incredible skier who ever was , &quot; Puckett said . This , for the runner-up . The race was a reflection of personalities . Stangassinger did not miss a trick . He put a gold-medal plan into motion and carried it through . He arrived in Lillehammer only four days before the race so that he could relax and train on softer snow at_home . Once here , Stangassinger took meticulous notes , charted the course , checked weather reports -- really did his race homework . While his peers fought for the lowest starting number possible , Stangassinger selected bib No . 8 , deducing from earlier results that he who started first did not necessarily finish first . Stangassinger had the course pegged , and had a first run of 101.00 , 0.80 faster than his nearest challenger ' s . The bulk of his work done , he dared anyone to catch him . Tomba , on the other hand , did not miss a party . He came_to Lillehammer on Feb . 18 , promptly moved_out of the Olympic village into a private cottage , continued his pursuit of figure skater Katerina Witt and complained about the cold . He said he wore_out his legs training on the hard Norwegian snow . As the top-ranked slalom skier , Tomba chose bib No . 1 because it was the number he had worn when he won his first gold medal at the 1988 Calgary Games . So_much for strategy . Tomba made his adjustment mid-race , after bombing out on the first run of a killer course on which only 22 of the 57 racers finished . Tomba is so good he ' s often compared to himself . But at 27 , he admits he is no longer the skier who so easily swept the slalom and GS at Calgary in 1988 . &quot; The Tomba from Calgary would have for_sure had a better first run , &quot; Tomba said . Sunday ' s course actually was two courses : the snow marble-hard on top and soft and &quot; grabby &quot; on the bottom . Skiers who sharpened their edges to make_sure turns_on the ice lost time on the lower section . Tomba , skiing on fumes , changed to new skis between runs and dulled his edges with sandpaper . &quot; In the Olympics , you have no choice , &quot; he said . &quot; You just have to take all_the risks you can. &quot; Skiing fourth in the afternoon , Tomba guessed that if he could survive the top , he could make_up time near the bottom . Going_for broke , he survived a near fall at the second gate and fled the scene on his way to the fastest second-run time . Still , Tomba figured his great run could not save the day . He was only renting first place . He waved his hands in disgust and told his entourage , in Italian , &quot; Let ' s go home. &quot; No one left , though . The next seven racers could not better Tomba ' s time . With each failure , he inched closer to a medal , and the Tomba freaks waved their Italian flags with more conviction and incrementally increased the decibel levels in their chants of &quot; Tomba ! Tomba ! Tomba ! &quot; Tomba was still first with the fastest four yet to ski . He would need two breaks to win bronze , three to win silver , four to win gold . He got three . He called this occurrence , &quot; Magic Alberto. &quot; Some others might call it a hex . Thomas Sykora of Austria crashed . One down . Germany ' s Peter Roth skied off course . Two down . Tomba had the bronze . Standing between Tomba and silver was Kjetil Andre Aamodt , 22 , of Norway , who had already won more Olympic medals -- five -- than any other male skier in history . Aamodt was staring at medal No . 6 when he shot out of the start , dived into the treacherous cut around Gate 2 and felt the skis slide out from under him . Tomba couldn ' t believe his fortune . The Tomba sharks suddenly smelled gold , but Stangassinger , the 28-year-old tactician , had a solid plan . Knowing he had time to give , he carefully carved his way through the danger_zone and made a safe , sure run to the finish . His second-run time was 1:01.02. &quot; Tomba made a perfect second run , &quot; Stangassinger said . &quot; And I had a perfect first run . It was very close_in the finish. &quot; Tomba , who had announced this was his last Olympics , paraded around the finish corral like a boy on the last_day of school . Several Norwegian hostesses , dressed in traditional costumes , lifted Tomba onto their shoulders . Dressed in an aqua-blue Italian warm-up suit , he made the rounds to his various cheering sections . After shaking one Italian flag off its pole , he pitched the shaft like a javelin aimlessly into the stands . Tomba again , throwing caution to the wind . With the fifth medal of his career -- three gold , two silver -- Tomba tied Aamodt and Switzerland ' s Vreni Schneider for most Alpine medals in Olympic history . Tomba loves to act the clown , flirt_with women . He sometimes gets_into the darndest predicaments . Yet , Sunday , Tomba danced like a man who had been relieved of a great burden . &quot; Of course , &quot; he said . &quot; There was a lot of pressure on me . Everyone wanted me to do_well , and I wanted to do_well . I didn ' t sleep at all last night. &quot; Sunday night , it was Italy ' s turn .</TEXT>
