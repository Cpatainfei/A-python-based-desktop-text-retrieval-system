   <HEADLINE> A FLAMBOYANT SCIENTIST ' S LEGACY ; SCHOLAR : LINUS C . PAULING ' S SUPPORTERS AND DETRACTORS JOIN IN CALLING THE TWO-TIME NOBEL WINNER ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FIGURES OF THIS CENTURY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He was both revered and reviled as he divided his long and productive life between the science of chemistry and the concerns of humanity . But when Linus C . Pauling died Friday of prostate cancer at age 93 at his beloved home_in Big Sur , he was remembered around the world with unanimity as one of the most imposing and significant figures of the 20th Century . Through seven decades , two Nobel Prizes and countless scientific and governmental honors , he made singular contributions to science , and his influence on several generations of students at three California universities was immeasurable . Then there were his untiring efforts on behalf of world peace and his colorful and controversial advocacy of the usefulness of Vitamin_C . &quot; He earned the respect of other scientists , &quot; said Prof . James F . Bonner , a retired Caltech biologist , a former Pauling student and one of his lifelong friends , &quot; by being incredibly smart , incredibly inventive and mostly right . Not always right , but mostly. &quot; Ahmed H . Zewail , another longtime friend who is the Linus Pauling Professor of Chemical Physics at Caltech , said Saturday that Pauling had an unusual combination of flamboyance and scholarship . &quot; Linus was one of those people who enjoyed being in the limelight but who also brought the world many new thoughts and ideas . He was just a real creative human being and a man of great talent , &quot; said Zewail , who brought Pauling back to the Caltech campus for the Nobel laureate ' s 85th and 90th birthday celebrations . The man who was to become the only person to win two unshared Nobel Prizes displayed his intellectual gifts at an early age . His father , Herman Henry William Pauling , a Portland , Ore. , pharmacist , wrote a letter to the editor of the Portland Oregonian in 1910 , asking_for a list of books that might be suitable for his 9-year-old son who had an &quot; extraordinary interest and ability in reading. &quot; The younger Pauling attended Portland schools and enrolled at Oregon State College ( now Oregon State University ) , graduating in 1922 with a bachelor ' s degree in chemical_engineering . He transferred to Caltech and three years later earned a doctorate in chemistry . The 1920s were a heady decade for science . Physicists were busy revealing all manner of new properties and workings of the atom , largely as a result of the then-new theory of quantum mechanics . The theory , which began with the work of Max Planck and was continued , modified and elaborated upon by Albert Einstein , Niels Bohr and many others , is essentially mathematical and probabilistic in character . Its central premise , greatly oversimplified , is that atoms and other basic particles absorb and emit energy in very specific amounts , called quanta . Pauling was one of the first to see that the theory could also be applied in chemistry . He studied under Bohr in Copenhagen and became very familiar_with the great Danish scientist ' s model for the structure of the hydrogen_atom and its electron . Pauling returned to the United States and Caltech in 1927 as an assistant_professor of chemistry , and was later promoted to full_professor . He focused his brilliant , intuitive mind on questions that fascinated him and many other scientists of that era : the structure of molecules and the properties of the bonds that hold the atoms of a molecule together . He brought_to this work his recently acquired knowledge of quantum mechanics and his expertise in X-ray_diffraction , a technique he had by then been using for several years in chemical experiments . In this technique , X-rays are beamed through a crystalline form of a molecule under study . The X-rays are deflected whenever they strike an atom , like waves striking the pilings of a dock , and so form an interference pattern on special film recorders . By analyzing these interference patterns , Pauling and his colleagues were able to determine where different atoms were located within the structure of the overall molecule , the angles at which they were joined , and so on . This research led Pauling to a consideration of the chemical_bond itself . What was it that held single atoms of sodium and chlorine together as a molecule of salt ? Or two hydrogens and an oxygen to form water ? How did crystals of iron and other metals stick_together ? By means of a series of careful experiments done over a period of a_few years , Pauling , often called the &quot; St . Paul of quantum mechanics , &quot; emerged with several major findings . His discoveries had major , if somewhat generalized , impact on chemistry and chemical_engineering . The Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences regarded Pauling ' s elucidation into the nature of the chemical_bond and the structure of complex substances to be such a profound addition to scientific_knowledge that it awarded him the 1954 Nobel Prize in chemistry . In 1949 , Pauling had attended a lecture on sickle_cell anemia presented by Dr. William B . Castle of the Harvard_University Medical_School . During his talk , Castle mentioned that sickle_cells took_on their characteristic crescent shape only in the venous , or deoxygenated , side of the body ' s circulatory_system . On the arterial , or oxygenated , side , these cells had a normal shape . Something clicked in Pauling ' s brain and , as he had done many times before and after , he immediately saw the answer to the problem : Sickle_cell anemia was caused by a genetic defect in the structure of the red_blood_cells ' hemoglobin molecule . Certain that he was correct in his insight -- an unshakable self-confidence was another hallmark of Pauling ' s personality -- he began a series of experiments that lasted from 1949 to 1952 and proved that sickling was the result of a faulty gene . In the early 1950s , encouraged by his success with his insights into sickle_cell anemia , Pauling turned his thoughts and energies to a number of other diseases that originated , or so he was convinced , in flawed genetic molecules . He became particularly interested in several mental_illnesses , including schizophrenia . By then , Pauling wielded considerable power over his Caltech fiefdom -- he had become chairman of the chemistry and chemical_engineering division , as well as director of the Gates and Crellin Laboratories of Chemistry ( in 1936 ) -- and so could direct , pretty much as he pleased , the thrust of those research activities under his aegis . He began bringing into Caltech ' s chemistry division a number of researchers with a chemical-biomedical approach to mental_illness . Within a fairly short time , according to Bonner , Pauling had converted about one-third of the Gates and Crellin Laboratories ' space and resources for investigating the molecular bases of different mental_illnesses . It was a move that was to cost Pauling dearly a_few years later . Although some of the newcomers were good scientists who produced useful findings , many were regarded by the established Caltech chemists as inadequate , unproductive or incompetent . Tensions quickly developed between the two factions . The problem was exacerbated because Pauling was frequently absent from the chemistry_laboratories and the Caltech campus during that period . He was always in_demand as a guest lecturer and winning the Nobel Prize only enhanced his desirability in the eyes of other universities and organizations ; the invitations to speak started rolling into his office by the score . Pauling accepted many of them . On top of this , he had begun to speak out about the hazards of nuclear_weapons and the atmospheric tests of nuclear_fission bombs . In 1958 he wrote an impassioned book on the threat of these weapons to world peace , titled &quot; No More War ! &quot; and he spearheaded a petition campaign against atmospheric testing of nuclear_weapons that was signed by more_than 11 # 000 scientists from around the world . Pauling presented this impressive document to the United Nations in 1958 . His efforts were widely credited as having contributed importantly to the test ban treaty that the major nuclear nations signed_in 1963 ; those efforts won him the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize . Pauling was the second_person to ever win two Nobel Prizes , but the first to win two by himself . Marie Curie won two Nobels , for physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911 ; however , she shared the physics prize with two others . Because of his outspoken anti-war feelings , Pauling became a target of the stridently anti-Communist political conservatives of the Joseph McCarthy era . Pauling was accused of being a Communist by McCarthy and was badgered by &quot; red-hunting &quot; congressional and state Senate investigative committees . Pauling declined to answer the questions put to him by a California Senate committee on education , but in a Nov . 16 , 1950 , letter to Caltech President Lee A . DuBridge , he flatly declared : &quot; I am not a Communist . I am not a member of the Communist_Party now or at any time in the past. &quot; DuBridge made the letter public and avoided a head-on clash with the committee . By 1958 , Pauling was in_trouble on several grounds -- his absenteeism from the school , his continued advocacy of biomedical research in the chemical laboratories , and his disdain for compromise . The Caltech Board of Trustees demanded that he step_down from the chairmanship of the division that he had held for 22 years . It was a bitter blow for Pauling , who discovered that he had very little support above himself in the Caltech organization and not much more , if any , below . He remained at Caltech , holding tenure as a full_professor , but when he could no longer endure watching his successor dismantle the mental_illness program he had set_up , he resigned in 1963 and joined the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions . He quickly came_to regard many of his colleagues at the Santa Barbara-based center as &quot; windbags , &quot; according to a friend , and left to join the faculty of UC San Diego in 1967 as a professor of chemistry . But there were conservatives on then-Gov . Ronald Reagan ' s Board of Regents who disliked Pauling and everything he stood_for ; they began questioning his yearly reappointment to the UC San Diego faculty , just as they questioned the status of professors Herbert Marcuse and Angela Davis , both avowed Communists . Pauling refused to be baited by Reagan ' s regents and he quit UC San Diego in 1969 to accept a professorial seat with Stanford_University . He remained there until 1974 , when he established the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine in nearby Menlo Park . Pauling began taking Vitamin_C on a regular , if moderate , basis in 1941 as part of his recovery regimen from a bout of nephritis ( a kidney inflammation ) . In the 1950s , when he was greatly interested in the molecular roots of mental_illness , he learned that two Canadian researchers had been treating schizophrenic patients with large doses of the vitamin and , according to Pauling , achieving positive results . Intrigued by those findings , he began to build a collection of reports on the beneficial aspects of Vitamin_C . Then , in 1966 , he became acquainted with professor Irwin Stone , a New York City biochemist who had long been advocating large doses -- 3 grams a day -- of the vitamin to promote general health and prevent illness . Belief was soon transformed into conviction . Pauling and his wife , Ava Helen , started taking that much Vitamin_C every day and both reported that not only did they feel better as a consequence , but they also no longer suffered the miseries of common_colds . Pauling was convinced that there was a causal link between his vigorous good_health and his huge intake of Vitamin_C -- he increased it to 18 # 000 milligrams a day in the mid-1970s -- and thus began promoting it for a broad range of ailments . Although never officially recognized by the medical_community for his research , in 1981 , Pauling enjoyed one small public triumph when the National Cancer Institute granted his small institute $ 204 # 000 for a two-year study on the effectiveness of Vitamin_C on cancer . Pauling and his wife , whom he met during his Oregon days , enjoyed a close and warm relationship until her death in 1981 . They had four children . He was unusually successful at making money throughout his distinguished career . The Nobel Prizes brought him handsome sums at the times they were bestowed , but so did the chemistry textbooks he wrote . Pauling was a very compassionate individual , by all accounts , and his sympathies instantly sprang to those who had been made to suffer for their political beliefs . &quot; He once hired a lab director , &quot; Bonner said , &quot; whose sole credential for the job was the fact that he had been fired from his previous post for citing the 5th Amendment on_his_own behalf during some anti-Communist hearings . The man was not a good choice for the job , but still Linus stuck_by him. &quot; Pauling ' s greatest strength , said many who knew him through the years , was also his Achilles ' heel : a supreme , unshakable confidence in the correctness of_his_own judgments . &quot; When he was right , which was more often than not , &quot; said one longtime friend , &quot; he was very , very right . But when he was wrong , which he also was from time to time , there was no way to get him to see it , or to compromise , or to make any kind of concession . This attitude frankly rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. &quot; In the end , such foibles amount to little when compared to the achievements of Pauling ' s remarkable contributions to science and society . &quot; He had one of the most original , creative minds of any scientist in the 20th Century , &quot; said Norman Davidson , a longtime colleague . &quot; There is no doubt that he will be the preeminent chemist of this century. &quot;</TEXT>
