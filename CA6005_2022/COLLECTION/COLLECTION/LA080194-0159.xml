   <HEADLINE> U.N. VOTE GETS SUPPORT FROM HAITI ' S STREETS BUT NOT ITS ELITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some Haitians welcomed the U.N. approval Sunday of the use of force to topple their military government , saying that freedom is worth any sacrifice . Others predicted a disaster . &quot; I ' m afraid Haiti is going_to become a new Somalia , &quot; said Antoine Joseph , a former president of the lower house of Parliament . A multinational peacekeeping force has failed to curb clan fighting in Somalia . The U.N. Security_Council authorized &quot; any means necessary &quot; to force Haiti ' s military rulers to step_down and allow deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return . &quot; They are stepping_in to restore constitutional democracy , that is to say , stepping_in to violate it , &quot; said Jean-Claude Roy , a conservative politician who has close ties to the military . &quot; If Aristide is restored to office by a foreign intervention , he is finished , &quot; said Joseph , who opposed the 1991 coup that toppled Aristide but has nonetheless supported the military . &quot; He will be a puppet with no moral authority in the eyes of the Haitian people , &quot; Joseph said . Coup leader Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras attended a Methodist_church service shortly before the Security_Council approved the resolution . &quot; After this service , I have enough strength to defend the country , &quot; he said . Reaction on the street differed . Bus_drivers Jean-Claude , 38 , and Pierre , 40 , didn ' t want to give their full names for fear of reprisals . But they favored an end to military rule by any means . &quot; I support a military intervention if it uproots the military system we ' ve got now , &quot; said Jean-Claude . &quot; Haiti doesn ' t need a military occupation , but ever since we won our independence , we ' ve never been free. &quot; &quot; I want another Haitian army , &quot; Pierre said . &quot; This army is no good . I don ' t want this army to go_on torturing and sowing the streets with dead_bodies . &quot; National sovereignty isn ' t the problem , &quot; he added . &quot; I want the Haitian army to disappear. &quot; Haiti ' s military rulers have defied a worldwide trade and oil embargo and a U.S. ban on most financial transactions with the Caribbean nation . The Clinton_Administration repeatedly has threatened an invasion and , following Sunday ' s U.N. vote , is &quot; prepared to organize and lead &quot; an invasion force , said Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations . U.S. Navy ships carrying 2 # 700 Marines are stationed off Haiti .</TEXT>
