   <HEADLINE> RABIN , ARAFAT MEET IN ATTEMPT TO ALLEVIATE NEW TENSIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Still basking in public approval of his first open trip to Jordan , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin returned Wednesday to his hard-slogging negotiations on Palestinian self-rule with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat . A meeting between the two leaders at the Erez checkpoint was billed as a chance to discuss the myriad problems Arafat faces as he tries to build a government in the Gaza Strip and Jericho . But Rabin aides said the session was really intended to reassure the Palestinian leader that Israel has not abandoned him in favor of King Hussein of Jordan . Relations between Israel and the Palestinians have grown tense since Hussein decided to speed_up his negotiations with Israel . Arafat has fretted publicly about a provision in last month ' s Washington declaration ending the 46-year state_of_war between Israel and Jordan ; the accord included language recognizing a special role for Jordan in protecting Jerusalem ' s Muslim holy sites . Arafat also has complained to interviewers that his government is broke and that promised aid from international donors has failed to materialize . He has described himself as &quot; in despair &quot; and warned that the experiment in Palestinian self-rule is in danger of collapsing without more cooperation from Israel and the international community . Rabin told reporters after Wednesday ' s session that Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will continue talks next Monday on transferring more authority from Israel to the Palestinians in the territories and on speeding_up preparations for the first Palestinian elections . Israel tried to improve the atmosphere for the talks by releasing eight female Palestinian prisoners just hours before the two leaders met . Arafat described the session as &quot; positive &quot; when speaking_to reporters with Rabin afterward . But Arafat was bombarded with questions from Israeli reporters about a statement reportedly made by Farouk Kaddoumi , the PLO ' s foreign_minister , in a radio speech Monday . Kaddoumi reportedly said on PLO radio ' s last broadcast from Tunis , Tunisia : &quot; There is a state which was established through historical force and it must be destroyed . This is the Palestinian way . They seized our land . The refugees must return to their land. &quot; Arafat refused to condemn the statement , although Rabin said that &quot; it is inconceivable that the issue will be treated lightly. &quot; Rabin said Kaddoumi ' s apparent call_for the destruction of Israel contradicts the agreement -- signed_on Sept . 13 , 1993 , between Israel and the PLO -- that granted limited self-rule to Palestinians living_in Israeli-occupied territory . Israel and Jordan are said to be close to an agreement on granting passage of civilian flights through each other ' s airspace ; their tourism ministers are set to meet soon to discuss international marketing of package tours to both nations . Israeli tourists carrying passports from some_other nations are already being welcomed in Jordan . The contrast between Rabin ' s evident delight on Monday in dealing with Hussein -- Rabin dined with him at the king ' s summer palace in Aqaba , then joined him for a cruise in the Gulf_of_Aqaba -- and his strictly business approach to Arafat was commented on this week by Israeli pundits . &quot; Arafat feels neglected , pushed_aside by Israel and the international community and left on_his_own to tread the very uncelebratory alleyways of the autonomy , &quot; opined Shlomo Ginossaur in the left-of-center daily Davar . &quot; Arafat would rather see Rabin smiling and generous , and Rabin would rather see Arafat shaven , his head uncovered , wearing a normal civilian suit , expressing himself in fluent English like his majesty the royal highness. &quot;</TEXT>
