   <HEADLINE> BURNING_UP THE TRACK IN NORWAY ; SOUTH GATE ' S SANCHEZ WILL RUN A LEG OF OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If a classmate hadn ' t urged Humberto Sanchez to try_out for the South Gate High_School cross-country team last fall , the 18-year-old senior might be watching next month ' s Winter_Olympics on TV . Instead , he ' s going_to be part of the Olympic Torch Relay in Norway . Sanchez ran his first cross-country race in September . In November , he finished second in the City Section finals . And Feb . 5 he will run a 500-meter leg of the relay in Oslo . &quot; I am excited , but I am a little nervous because I have never been_on a plane , &quot; Sanchez said . * Sanchez is one of five U.S. participants chosen by the International Torch Bearers program , which , for the first time in the Winter Games , will include runners from outside the host country . City girls ' cross-country champion Genevieve DeBose of Hamilton High , Jason Murphy and Linda Lisska of Atlanta , and Tim Willis , a blind runner , were the other U.S. selections . ( Sanchez and DeBose were chosen after their performances at the City Section finals ; the boys champion was unable to make the trip. ) In all , 30 participants from 13 countries were chosen by the Coca-Cola sponsored program . The 7 # 000-person relay started Nov . 27 in Morgedal , the site where the flame for the 1952 Oslo Winter_Olympics was kindled , and will end 5 # 000 miles later in Lillehammer with the Feb . 12 opening ceremonies . * The occasion will mark Sanchez ' s first exposure to sub-freezing weather . &quot; The State meet in Fresno was the coldest place I ' ve been and its supposed to be minus 7 degrees in Norway , so I don ' t know what to expect , &quot; he said . &quot; I am just grateful for the opportunity to go. &quot; His mother , Maria , will accompany him on the four-day trip with a newly-purchased video camera . But tracking Sanchez ' s meteoric rise in cross-country was so quick , it would be difficult for anyone to follow . In the beginning , Sanchez ' s goal was to just make the varsity squad . &quot; I figured I ' d be fourth or fifth man on my team , &quot; he said . &quot; I was the first man in my first race and I kept getting faster and faster and picking_up the pace. &quot; Sanchez won the Southeastern Conference title to help South Gate to the team title and also went_on to place 11th in the State Division I final in Fresno -- the highest finish by a South Gate runner . His performance in Fresno triggered scholarship interest from several colleges , including Cal State L.A. and UC Davis . This spring he plans to compete in his first season of high_school track , concentrating_on the 1 # 600 and 3 # 200 meters . &quot; He kept getting better and better , &quot; said Coach Daniel Zepeda . &quot; He is an extraordinary talent and he ' ll continue to improve in college . It ' s a shame he didn ' t run_for four years in high_school because he could still be a lot better. &quot; As an eighth-grader , Sanchez set the mile record of 4 minutes 58 seconds at South Gate High Junior_High but dropped_out of running to play basketball the next year . &quot; One of my dreams was to play high_school basketball , &quot; he said . &quot; I guess I fell_in_love with the camaraderie instead of running and the me-against-you. &quot; This season , Sanchez , a guard , was elevated to the Rams ' varsity basketball_team . He ' ll miss two games to make the trip to Norway . &quot; I ' m a lot better at running , but I ' ve been playing basketball for so_long that I wanted to continue , &quot; Sanchez said . &quot; I still want to go_back to running in college and accomplish something. &quot;</TEXT>
