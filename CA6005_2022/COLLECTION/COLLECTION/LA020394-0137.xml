   <HEADLINE> U.S. WOMAN PREVAILS IN DOWNHILL ; SKIING : LINDH WINS LAST WORLD CUP RACE BEFORE OLYMPICS . IN WAKE OF MAIER ' S DEATH , AUSTRIAN TEAM DOES NOT COMPETE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the last downhill race before the Lillehammer Winter_Olympics and the first after the death of Austrian Ulrike Maier , America ' s Hilary Lindh scored her first World Cup victory Wednesday at Sierra_Nevada , Spain . Lindh , the 1992 Olympic silver medalist , won with a time of 2 minutes 4.21 seconds , defeating Melanie Suchet of France by 0.01 seconds . Lindh and others raced with the pall of Maier ' s death hanging over the women ' s World Cup circuit . Maier was killed Saturday after she crashed on the downhill course at Garmisch-Partenkirchen , Germany . In deference to Maier , who will be buried today , the Austrian women ' s team did not compete in Wednesday ' s race , which had been scheduled for Friday but was moved_up to avoid a storm that is expected in the region later this week . World Cup officials on Wednesday canceled a men ' s downhill ski_race on the same course where the Austrian star broke her neck . &quot; It was hard to put it out of your mind , &quot; Lindh said of the Maier crash in a conference_call from Sierra_Nevada . &quot; I view it as two different subjects : The Ulli accident was really freaky , we all know something like that can happen , but it doesn ' t happen often . We were all definitely thinking_about her ; I ' m especially thinking_about her daughter who she left_behind . But that ' s separate from when you ' re out there skiing. &quot; It was Lindh ' s first victory in eight World Cup seasons and her second top-10 finish this season . She was fourth in a downhill at Cortina d ' Ampezzo , Italy , on Jan . 14 . Lindh , 24 , of Juneau , Alaska , appears to have fully recovered from knee surgery that forced her to miss most of the 1992-93 season . &quot; I ' ve had two good , solid results , &quot; she said . &quot; At the same time , I know the media will be a lot more interested to see how I ' m doing ; so will the people at_home . Whatever happens , it will be worth it. &quot; It was another strong showing for the U.S. speed contingent . Krista Schmidinger finished eighth in the race , Megan Gerety 14th .</TEXT>
