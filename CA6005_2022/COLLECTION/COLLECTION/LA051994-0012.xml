   <HEADLINE> STAY_ON THE MORAL HIGH GROUND ; U.S. IS RIGHT THAT IRAQ MUST DO MORE IF SANCTIONS ARE TO BE LIFTED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion and brutal occupation of Kuwait are still in_force , but support for the measures is faltering . Three permanent members of the U.N. Security_Council -- China , France and Russia -- have signaled they are ready to think_about easing the restrictions , which are now in their fourth year . All , surely by no coincidence , have reportedly lined_up contracts to help rebuild Iraq ' s infrastructure once commerce with Baghdad again is made legal . The United States and Britain , the other two permanent members of the council , rightly insist that Iraq must comply more fully with U.N. resolutions before any changes are made . Specifically they say Saddam Hussein ' s regime must recognize Kuwait ' s independence and stop waging ruthless war against Iraqi Kurds and Shiites . These are valid and honorable demands , and Washington shouldn ' t hesitate to use its Security_Council veto to enforce them . Iraq does appear to have complied with U.N. orders to halt and destroy its programs to build nuclear and chemical weapons ; whether it has also done so with its biological weapons program is less clear . Iraq argues that by ending its production of unconventional weapons it has earned the right to be freed from sanctions . But Washington and others question whether Iraq has in fact made the decision to adopt more responsible policies , domestically and in its foreign relations . Iraq could hardly have resisted the internationally supervised destruction of its chemical and nuclear_weapons programs without inviting harsh reprisals , since defiance of the Security_Council would have constituted an unmistakable threat to peace and security . However , many U.N. members appear ready to regard Iraq ' s actions against its Kurdish and Shiite citizens and its refusal to accept Kuwait ' s independence as matters of much less international concern . The United States and Britain , taking the moral high ground , don ' t see it that way at all . They are right to continue demanding that Iraq must end its internal persecution and recognize Kuwait ' s border before the sanctions are lifted .</TEXT>
