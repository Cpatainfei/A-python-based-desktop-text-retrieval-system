   <HEADLINE> FRENCH FISHERMEN RIOT TO PROTEST PRICES ; EUROPE : DISTURBANCE GREETS PREMIER IN BRITTANY , PROMPTING GOVERNMENT PROMISES TO PROTECT THE INDUSTRY FROM FOREIGN COMPETITION . SIXTY-ONE PEOPLE WERE INJURED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thousands of fishermen battled riot police Friday during a visit by Premier Edouard Balladur , prompting government promises to protect the ailing fishing industry from foreign competition . Authorities said 61 people -- 25 policemen and 36 protesters and bystanders -- were treated for injuries they suffered in daylong clashes hours in Rennes . The city is the capital of Brittany , the region at the center of a violent campaign by fishermen across France . More_than 600 riot officers and paramilitary policemen repeatedly used tear_gas , and occasionally clubs , to combat protesters armed with baseball_bats , cudgels and paving stones ripped from the streets . Fishermen continued to block ports into the night , all but paralyzing traffic between France and Britain . Anxious to end the violence , Balladur pledged that his conservative government would act_on its own to protect the_French fishing industry if the 12-nation European Union does not move swiftly to prop_up fish prices . The trade bloc later announced that at France ' s request it was setting minimum prices for Atlantic_salmon and certain types of_imported white fish , meeting one of the protesters ' key demands . The EU Commission said the prices will remain in_effect at least until March 15 . Widespread violence by fishermen last week has resembled protests by French farmers who pressured the government to demand , and eventually win , concessions on farm subsidies in the recently completed world trade accord . Jean Puench , the fishing minister who joined Balladur in talks with a delegation of fishermen , said the government will cut by half the fishermen ' s required contributions for health_care , retirement and other social programs . On Thursday , the government promised $ 51 million in new aid to fishermen and ordered tighter customs checks on foreign fish to make_sure they meet quality standards . After the latest concessions , protest leaders urged their followers in Rennes to disperse but indicated they would still press for formal restrictions on fish imports . Balladur warned against further violence , saying the concessions should be sufficient . &quot; One never obtains anything lasting by violence or excess , &quot; he said . Protesters , many masking their faces with scarves , pelted police with eggs , empty beer_cans and paving stones . One protester ' s hand was partly severed when he tried to pick_up a tear_gas grenade . At least 13 of the injured policemen required hospitalization , including two wounded in the legs by shots from flare pistols . The mayor of Rennes , Edmond Herve , and a Parliament member , Jean-Michel Boucheron , were beaten by protesters and escorted by riot police to City_Hall , where they remained trapped for several hours . Fishermen overturned cars and smashed store windows . The protesters arrived in Rennes by train and bus , some from distant ports . The crowd was estimated at 4 # 000 to 5 # 000 , including fishermen , their wives and other supporters . About 50 fishermen raided a Rennes supermarket , throwing imported fish to the ground . Two supermarkets were attacked in Arcachon , outside Bordeaux , where protesters blocked a highway with burning tires . Normandy fishermen formed a blockade near the mouth of the Seine , preventing ocean traffic from reaching the port at Rouen . The port in Le Havre also was blocked , and fishermen in Mediterranean ports stopped work .</TEXT>
