   <HEADLINE> TALKS MAY SET STAGE FOR CLINTON TO VISIT CHINA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton welcomed Qian Qichen , China ' s foreign_minister , to the White_House on Monday and other U.S. officials met with Chinese counterparts in what appeared to be a broad effort to clear the way for a possible Clinton visit to Beijing next year . A China sojourn by the President -- complete with pictures of Clinton shaking hands with leaders like hard-line Premier Li Peng -- would be the capstone to China ' s largely successful five-year effort to regain international legitimacy after the brutal 1989 Tian An Men Square crackdown . Over the last few weeks , the Chinese press and Chinese officials have been floating the idea that Clinton may visit China . On Monday , soon after Qian met with Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , he raised the issue , the secretary said . U.S. officials have denied the President will visit this year but have not ruled_out the possibility of a trip next year . Shortly after Clinton ' s one-hour meeting with Qian , the White_House issued a statement saying China and the United States had made significant progress &quot; in some areas &quot; over the last year . But the statement said &quot; the President expressed disappointment &quot; about the lack of progress on human_rights . Earlier , Qian , who is also a vice premier , told reporters that relations between the United States and China are at a &quot; critical &quot; juncture , suggesting the ties could get much better or much worse . For their part , Clinton_Administration officials seem to be trying to use the possibility of a presidential visit as leverage to extract policy_changes from China on a series of issues , including arms proliferation , trade and human_rights . There were signs late Monday that Chinese and American officials are moving to resolve a long-running dispute over China ' s sales of M-11 missile parts to Pakistan . China has refused to discuss the sales , which seem to violate the international regime on missile technology , unless the United States explains the George_Bush Administration ' s decision to sell American F-16 warplanes to Taiwan . A senior U.S. official said there had been &quot; some progress. &quot; Shen Guofang , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman , told a news_conference Monday that Christopher &quot; did not mention &quot; the case of Wei Jingsheng , China ' s best-known proponent of democracy , who was imprisoned last spring . A U.S. official insisted that Wei ' s case had been brought_up in Christopher ' s meetings with Qian . Chinese Vice Justice Minister Zhang Geng was quoted today as saying that Wei will be shown around China ' s boom regions &quot; to see the progress of the motherland. &quot; His release from jail depends_on his behavior , Hong Kong newspapers quoted Zhang as saying .</TEXT>
