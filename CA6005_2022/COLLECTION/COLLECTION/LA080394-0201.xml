   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; MEXICAN STOCKS HIT 4-MONTH HIGH ON EXPECTATIONS OF MORE GROWTH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pushing_aside a year of inflation , civil unrest and political uncertainty , Mexican stocks rallied Tuesday to four-month highs amid expectations that the nation ' s ruling party will remain in power and economic_growth will increase after this month ' s presidential elections . The Bolsa index jumped 64.98 , or 2.63 % , to close at 2538.52 , its highest level since reaching 2 # 543.57 on March 23 . Mexican stocks haven ' t exactly been glamour pusses lately . For most of this year , volume and excitement have been in short supply . The Bolsa index at first sputtered , then dropped dramatically as guerrillas fought army troops in the southeastern state of Chiapas . The index fell again when presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated March 23 . As world confidence in the country ' s ability to pull itself together waned , the Bolsa hit a low of 1 # 957.33 on April 20 . Over the past two weeks , however , signs of solid economic_growth and good corporate earnings_reports have sparked a lively rally . Early last month , Mexico ' s stock_market was down about 15 % in U.S. dollar terms since Jan . 1 . Now the index is down 10.38 % in dollar terms and just 2.47 % in local currency terms for the year . The recent spike got its start July 20 , after a Louis Harris poll reported that 50 % of the electorate preferred Ernesto Zedillo , the presidential candidate of the PRI , or Institutional Revolutionary Party . A PRI victory in the Aug . 21 election would ensure continued economic reforms and growth in corporate profits , analysts and traders said . &quot; Everybody thinks : ' Zedillo will win . There will be 5 % economic_growth in 1995 . The peso will not be devalued . There will be no social instability . So let ' s buy , ' &quot; said Herman Von Bertrab , director_of_research at InverWorld in San Antonio . But Von Bertrab said the rise in Mexico stocks &quot; is overdone . The fundamentals in Mexico have not changed. &quot; He said his firm is selling stocks . &quot; Zedillo will win . that ' s almost certain , &quot; Von Bertrab said , but higher interest_rates in the United States could easily put a damper on the Mexican market . Share prices were pushed higher in part because yields on dollar-indexed government_bonds fell an average of 20 basis points in this week ' s auction of government debt , Von Bertrab said . Lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing , which can help boost company profits , making stocks more valuable . Rates began to decline last week as investors expressed confidence that the free-market economic_policies of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will remain in_effect until 2000 . &quot; My premise was that Mexico wasn ' t going_to see good growth until interest_rates go_down , &quot; said Kelly McDermott , a global fund portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp . Whether an economic recovery can be sustained will depend_on whether the victor in the presidential elections can keep interest_rates down , McDermott said . Salomon Bros . said in a recent research report that the Bolsa index could rise above 3 # 000 by the end of the year if there is 2.7 % economic_growth and a further drop_in interest_rates from the current 17.5 % . Carlos Fritsch , head of Latin_American research at S.G. Warburg , is predicting an increase to 2 # 900 by year ' s end . Some analysts anticipated the Tuesday ' s rally . &quot; Mexico currently trades at 12 times estimated 1995 earnings and is one of the world ' s cheapest markets , &quot; Morgan Stanley ' s Robert J . Pelosky Jr . wrote in a July 14 research report . &quot; I don ' t think it will stay that way much longer. &quot; Mexican stocks first got a boost last month when the government reported unexpectedly healthy growth in second-quarter gross_domestic_product . Then several large Mexican companies reported solid earnings growth , Telefonos de Mexico and Grupo Carso , an industrial conglomerate , among them . On Tuesday , American depositary receipts of Telefonos de Mexico , worth 26 % of the Bolsa index and a benchmark for the Mexican market , advanced 2 % to $ 62.625 , their highest price since June 7 .</TEXT>
