   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; FAA ' S SAFETY RESPONSE RECORD HITS TURBULENCE ; OVER THE PAST DECADE , THE AGENCY HAS BEEN SLOW TO HEED SAFETY WARNINGS -- SOMETIMES ACTING ONLY AFTER FATAL CRASHES , ACCORDING TO A TIMES_STUDY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As USAir Flight 1493 prepared to touch_down at Los Angeles International Airport on Feb . 1 , 1991 , passenger David Richman , a Harvard-educated college professor and proud new father , knew_nothing about the potential danger of runway collisions . Nor did any of the other 33 people who were about to die that Friday evening . But the Federal Aviation Administration did know . As far back as 1983 , records show , air safety experts had urged FAA action to do more to prevent runway accidents . Even within the agency , officials had prodded their superiors to expedite ground-based radar systems and relatively inexpensive traffic lighting systems . The FAA did take those actions and more -- but only after Flight 1493 suddenly landed atop a Skywest commuter plane , killing 34 people . This was the third fatal runway collision in the United States in 13 months . &quot; How many crashes do you need ? &quot; asked Barry M . Sweedler , director of safety recommendations for the National Transportation Safety Board . &quot; If you have one , there should never be another one with the same problem . Why do we need two , three , four or five ? &quot; In dozens of instances over the past decade , the FAA has taken two years or more to respond to repeated warnings of air safety problems , and the agency often has acted only after loss of life , according to a four-month study by The Times . The FAA , the federal agency responsible by law for ensuring air safety , has been named by the NTSB as a cause or factor_in 103 airplane accidents and incidents between 1983 and last July that together killed 574 and injured 421 . And records also show that hundreds more people have died in crashes caused by problems to which the FAA had been alerted but failed to act . In addition to runway collisions , these problems included turbulence caused by the wings of Boeing 757 jetliners , procedures for de-icing wings before takeoff , the refurbishment of_aging aircraft , passenger access to emergency_exits and the installation of devices that warn if a plane is flying too low . Although he said safety is the agency ' s &quot; No . 1 job , &quot; David Hinson , the administrator of the FAA , said of the list of lapses : &quot; I think you ' ve put your finger on something that we ' re really trying to deal with. &quot; While Hinson was unfamiliar_with the specific areas The Times was focusing_on -- most of which preceded his arrival in 1993 -- he said : &quot; Hopefully , we ' ll be more responsible in quicker fashion. &quot; FAA officials say the agency ' s day-to-day operation addresses most issues &quot; rather effectively , &quot; often detecting and remedying safety problems before accidents occur . Each morning , they say , the agency deploys about 3 # 000 inspectors and runs the busiest airspace in the world -- without major incident on most days . &quot; This is a formidable task , &quot; Hinson said . The FAA &quot; acknowledges that it can be reactive in some cases , but that can be a proper response in many cases , &quot; according to a statement by the agency in response to The Times . &quot; Reaction often means we insist on learning from past accidents . At other times , reaction may mean that we are properly responding to public demand or concern , which is proper in our democratic form of government. &quot; Said Hinson : &quot; If you look_at the way the FAA deals with safety , about 95 % of what we do . . . of what you or I would call preemptive safety efforts , those are efforts you probably never read about or write_about . &quot; About 5 % of what we do is_after there is an incident or an accident. &quot; Airplane manufacturers and airlines said safety comes first with both the FAA and them , and that they would never compromise the lives of the flying public . &quot; We always want to try to make a good system better , &quot; said Joe Hopkins , spokesman for United Airlines . A scheduled commercial airplane trip in the United States is regarded_as among the safest forms of travel in the world . The odds of an air traveler dying in a crash are roughly the same as the odds of being killed by lightning , according to the National Safety Council . The U.S airline industry had gone more_than two years without a major accident before the string of fatal_accidents this year . As of October , an estimated 843 people have died in plane crashes in 1994 -- one of the worst records since 1988 , according to preliminary statistics by the NTSB , the agency that investigates accidents . Now , NTSB sources say , investigators are exploring whether deficiencies in FAA oversight and operations may have been contributing factors_in at least two of the three major accidents this year in Charlotte , N.C. , Pittsburgh , Pa. , and near Chicago . After the FAA admitted in July that it may have mishandled reports on turbulence problems associated with Boeing 757 jetliners , The Times reviewed hundreds of airline crashes and thousands of government documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act . Scores of past and present FAA officials , members of Congress , airline industry sources and safety experts were interviewed . What emerged was a portrait of an agency that many times has been slow to address safety problems , particularly when they were controversial or costly to correct . Among the findings : * The FAA ' s performance sometimes has been compromised by poor communication between those charged with identifying potential safety problems and those with the power to act_on them , and pressure from an influential industry . &quot; Any time you want to change the rules , the manufacturers scream , &quot; said one FAA aircraft-certification official who spoke on condition of anonymity . &quot; Anything that cost money to the manufacturers , we have to fight them on . They say : ' Well , there hasn ' t been an accident. ' We say : ' Well , there could be. ' &quot; * Deadly delays have occurred in part because a law requires the FAA to justify the cost of implementing proposed safety measures by showing that enough lives will be saved . &quot; It ' s strangulation of safety by regulatory process , &quot; observed Rep . James L . Oberstar ( D-Minn. ) , chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee ' s panel on aviation . * The FAA failed to heed repeated admonitions from oversight agencies and from within its own ranks to make safety a higher priority . And there exists , both inside and outside the FAA , a tacit acceptance that sometimes only accidents can spur the agency to take meaningful action . Charles O . Miller , former head of the NTSB ' s Bureau of Air Safety , said he has kept a file called &quot; known precedents. &quot; &quot; I have been keeping it for awhile because I was getting disturbed about seeing accidents happen from causes I had seen before , &quot; he said . Consider the case of runway safety . In 1978 , two researchers , using statistics compiled by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ' s Aviation Safety Reporting System , issued a report that said &quot; incursions by aircraft on the runways of controlled airports represent a significant safety hazard. &quot; Between 1978 and 1983 , at least three near-collisions involving major jetliners occurred on U.S. runways . In 1985 , after two Northwest Airlines DC-10s were involved in what the NTSB termed a &quot; potentially disastrous &quot; incident in Minneapolis , the safety board urged the FAA to expedite projects designed to prevent collisions . For years the FAA had such projects in the works , including the development of ground-based radar systems to help air traffic controllers track airplanes on the tarmac and simple lighting systems to ensure that departing planes do not stray onto active runways , especially during inclement weather . Even within the FAA , officials recognized that progress had been too slow . An internal FAA memorandum sent to air traffic managers in 1986 acknowledged that the runway incursion threat required further action . It noted that many FAA projects designed to deal with the problem were incomplete and , even if finished , would have questionable efficacy . That year the NTSB released the results of a special investigation on runway incursions , proffering to the FAA 33 recommendations designed to prevent them . One recommendation originally had been issued 13 years earlier , but was never acted_upon . During the next four years , according to internal FAA documents , the agency received dispatches from many corners of the industry , urging it to take preventive measures . Oct . 27 , 1987 : John O ' Brien , director of engineering and air safety for the Air Line Pilots Assn. , said in a letter to FAA Associate Administrator Anthony Broderick : &quot; Several accidents and incidents over the last few years have documented the seriousness of runway incursions. &quot; Aug . 11 , 1989 : An internal FAA memorandum declared : &quot; The Air Traffic Operations Service has stated an immediate need for a runway incursion alert system . . . . We agree that the potential for a runway accident is a national concern. &quot; But that concern turned_to catastrophe . The first of three fatal runway incursions occurred in Atlanta on Jan . 18 , 1990 , followed by one in Detroit on Dec . 3 , 1990 , and then the Los Angeles crash in February , 1991 . The death toll for the three crashes : 47 people , including David Richman , the college professor . &quot; The world changed at that moment , &quot; said Richman ' s father , Alex , a psychiatrist and professor in Nova Scotia . &quot; On that . . . morning , we were ignorant . We thought we could trust the airlines and the government . We thought safety came first. &quot; After the Atlanta crash , which killed one man , the FAA mustered action teams to survey airports and identify potential problem areas . It also released a report in April , 1990 , emphasizing that pilots could help cut runway incursions by being more aware of surrounding aircraft . At the time , the agency also acknowledged : &quot; FAA has not always coordinated its efforts to reduce incursions. &quot; Still , it was not until after the Los Angeles crash that the agency placed more emphasis and money into its long-extant runway-incursion project . By then , according to the FAA ' s own estimate , 11 runway accidents had occurred in the United States since 1970 , resulting in 644 deaths and injuries , not including the casualties from the Atlanta , Los Angeles and Detroit crashes . &quot; I ' m not a great fan of how fast we get things done_in this organization , &quot; said the FAA ' s Michael J . Harrison , who spearheaded the runway collision prevention program after the crash of USAir Flight 1493 . &quot; Should the runway-incursion stuff have been done sooner ? The answer to that is : of course. &quot; Since that time , the agency ' s plan to develop a sophisticated ground-based radar system and place it at the nation ' s busiest airports has fallen_behind schedule and may_not be completed until the turn_of_the_century , according to the General Accounting Office . &quot; Something simmers on the back burner , and it doesn ' t get done , &quot; said Hugh E . Waterman , a former FAA manager who worked for the agency for 27 years before retiring in 1986 . &quot; But then , one governor or 60 regular human_beings dies , then it goes onto the front burner. &quot; * Created in 1958 , the FAA has a double-barreled task that critics believe is a conflicting one : to promote the aviation industry and to ensure safety . The NTSB is charged with investigating the causes of transportation accidents and making safety recommendations . Created in 1974 , it has no regulatory powers and cannot force the FAA to act . Historically , the NTSB has wielded its influence most successfully by publicly drawing attention to the FAA ' s lapses and leveraging legislative outrage . The FAA points_out that through the years it has identified numerous safety hazards and acted before accidents ever occurred . In a 20-page statement to The Times , FAA officials said the agency routinely detects safety problems but receives no credit because there is no way to tell how many accidents have been prevented . &quot; Airline safety is among the least recognized success stories in public or corporate policy in the United States , &quot; the FAA statement said . &quot; Improvements in engine reliability , aircraft design , avionics , cockpit technology , navigational aids and air traffic_control have made serious accidents rare events. &quot; Although the FAA has adopted eight of every 10 safety recommendations made by the NTSB , the average amount_of_time it takes_to implement the recommendations is slightly more_than two years . In some cases , it ' s been much longer . While he believes that the NTSB functions as a &quot; great auditor &quot; for the FAA , Hinson said the FAA sometimes respectfully disagrees_with the safety board , and with good reason . &quot; I think it ' s probably OK to have disagreement on the 15 % or so , &quot; Hinson said , referring to the number of safety recommendations the agency doesn ' t accept . &quot; It ' s not just . . . ' We don ' t like them ' and put them away . We have to defend our position . &quot; There are often cases in aviation where knowledgeable people can disagree. &quot; The NTSB ' s Sweedler said the safety board was pleased with the &quot; 82.5 % acceptance rate , &quot; but , he said , &quot; there are quite a_few important issues in the other 18 % . &quot; * Records show a pattern of delay in correcting a number of problems : * It took the FAA eight years to act_on a problem with Cessna carburetors after John R . James , manager of the FAA ' s aircraft certification office in Atlanta , had written a memo warning : &quot; CAUTION : there have been reports of power loss , severe in some cases. &quot; The problem was causing planes to stall and crash . During that eight-year period , at least 10 accidents had occurred and half_a_dozen people had died . * A year before the top half of a Boeing 737 ripped_off over Hawaii in 1988 because of metal fatigue , FAA researcher Thomas Swift wrote a 77-page report saying fatigue in America ' s aging air fleet was a safety risk : &quot; It is possible for a number of cracks , each not easily inspected , to suddenly join together and form a long critical crack . . . . A number of fleets are currently operating at double their initially anticipated design life goals. &quot; * It took a decade of admonitions and at least four major crashes before the FAA acknowledged that certain planes , such_as early model DC-9s and Fokker F-28s , were especially susceptible to control problems with minute amounts of ice on their wings . Ten years after the NTSB had made safety recommendations following the deaths of 78 people in a 1982 Air Florida accident in Washington , a similar tragedy happened at La Guardia Airport in New York . That accident , involving USAir Flight 405 , killed 27 . The Air Line Pilots Assn . said in a letter to the FAA at the time : &quot; The lack of an adequate response to ( the NTSB ' s earlier ) recommendation ( on de-icing wings ) , which was made approximately 9 years ago , contributed to the accident involving USAir Flight 405. &quot; &quot; The FAA , &quot; said veteran air safety investigator Rudolf Kapustin , &quot; makes_it sound like : ' Hey , we ' ve got a brand-new problem here. ' Well , a lot of times it ' s not a new problem . It ' s an old problem. &quot; Kapustin , who has worked for the FAA and the NTSB , was the lead investigator in the 1982 Air Florida crash , which was caused , in part , by ice on the wings . &quot; After the Fokker accident ( at La Guardia Airport in 1992 ) , the FAA convened this worldwide conference on de-icing . They said : ' Now you ' ve got_to put a ladder up and touch ( the wing to see if it has ice on it ) . ' Well , Jesus , we knew that years ago. &quot; The FAA itself concluded last July that its ability to act_upon safety concerns in a timely manner was lacking . The agency had launched an internal investigation after The Times reported that it had mishandled the Boeing 757 turbulence issue . But the acknowledgment came as no surprise to air safety experts . In 1988 , then-FAA Administrator Allan McArtor , in an internal memorandum , acknowledged that the agency lacked an internal clearinghouse for safety data , and that management of safety data within the agency was disorganized . A July , 1988 , Office of Technology Assessment report concluded : &quot; More stringent safety standards usually follow a widely publicized airline accident and vocal public and congressional concern than from FAA initiatives. &quot; And last year , Robert E . Machol , the FAA ' s chief scientist before retiring last summer , pointed_out the agency ' s shortcomings . In a March , 1993 , memo , he detailed how the Boeing 757 wake-turbulence problem was handled . Before two crashes that claimed 13 lives , Machol had predicted that turbulence created by the jetliners would cause a &quot; major crash &quot; if the FAA failed to take preventive measures . &quot; This is symptomatic_of a bigger problem , which is that we react very slowly to things where maybe we ought to act more rapidly , &quot; Machol wrote . &quot; We need to be more alert to safety questions. &quot; Next : Why delays in response occur . Times researcher Sheila A . Kern and correspondent Shelby Grad contributed to this report . The FAA Factor_in Crashes The Federal Aviation Administration is listed as a cause or factor_in 93 plane crashes from1983 to July , 1994 . Injury and fatality records for the 93 crashes show : * 576 dead * 151 seriously injured * 270 moderately injured An additional 10 crashes were attributed to errors by specific FAA employees , resulting in : * Seven dead * Eight moderately injured Source : National Transportation Safety Board Researched by JEFF BRAZIL and SHELBY GRAD / Los Angeles Times Runway Incursions From 1990 to 1993 , the number of aircraft runway collisions has declined by one-third despite an increase in air traffic : ' 93 : 188 Source : Federal Aviation Administration Researched by JEFF BRAZIL and SHELBY GRAD / Los Angeles Times How the Study Was Conducted To complete this report , The Times reviewed roughly 20 # 000 pages of internal documents obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration through the Freedom of Information Act . The newspaper also reviewed a computer analysis of the causes of airplane crashes between 1983 and last July by the National Transportation Safety Board . The Times also studied dozens of reports by government oversight agencies , and interviewed scores of present and past FAA officials , airline industry sources , aviation safety experts , members of Congress , crash survivors and the families of crash victims .</TEXT>
