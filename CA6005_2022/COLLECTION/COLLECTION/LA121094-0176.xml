   <HEADLINE> U.N. MAY STAY IN BOSNIA , ENVOY SAYS ; TROOPS : AKASHI , CITING HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS , SAYS PEACEKEEPER WITHDRAWAL IS ONLY ONE OPTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The head of the U.N. Protection Force sought Friday to halt the steamrollering drive for a withdrawal of peacekeepers from Bosnia-Herzegovina , vowing that &quot; we have to carry_on &quot; despite warnings from troop-contributing countries that the mission is dangerously deadlocked . But even as Yasushi Akashi , the U.N. special envoy for the Balkans , played_down the harassment and hazards that Bosnian Serbs have heaped on U.N. forces , military officials of the 24 # 000-strong peacekeeping force in Bosnia were seeking an escape route for 600 Bangladeshi soldiers being hounded out of the embattled Bihac pocket in northwest Bosnia . In an interview one day after Washington promised thousands of U.S. troops to help break U.N. peacekeepers out of the unraveling Balkan conflict , Akashi suggested that the mission is unlikely to pull_out because it performs lifesaving humanitarian work in delivering food to 2 million civilians . The North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization could learn to live with the threat of new surface-to-air_missiles endangering its aircraft , he suggested , rejecting NATO appeals_to destroy the proliferating missile systems with air strikes . &quot; NATO is our instrument , &quot; Akashi said of the alliance ' s recent reduction of enforcement flights over Bosnia . The U.N. mission asked_for fewer flights to avoid further incidents in which Bosnian Serbs have locked on to NATO aircraft with radar or fired missiles at the planes . He praised the U.S. promise of assistance with any pullout of U.N. forces as a show of solidarity among Western allies but said that &quot; withdrawal is not more_than one contingency. &quot; In Washington , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry said that if the United States sends ground troops to help evacuate U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia , they will be heavily enough armed to use &quot; overwhelming force &quot; and prepared_for &quot; combat operations &quot; if necessary . &quot; We ' re not going_in with a token force -- we ' ll want to go_in with a strong enough force that will command respect , &quot; Perry told a press_conference at the Pentagon . &quot; The best way of avoiding problems is having a strong enough force that nobody sees it as an inviting target. &quot; He also said that if the allies were to launch an actual evacuation effort , both the allied forces and the U.N. peacekeeping troops would be placed under NATO command to simplify the operation . Perry also said the Clinton_Administration would consult fully with Congress before sending any U.S. troops to help evacuate U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia but would not seek formal authorization from the lawmakers , despite calls to that effect from Republicans . * The United States has offered to provide at least half of the 45 # 000 NATO troops expected to be needed if the U.N. Security_Council orders a full retreat . But most of the U.N. forces in Bosnia are deployed to Serbian-encircled enclaves such_as Bihac , making them vulnerable to further instances of hostage-taking if the Serbs fear that withdrawal will lead to a lifting of the U.N. arms embargo on the Muslim-led Bosnian government . The troops could also face blockades of angry Bosnian civilians who might fear a U.N. pullout would leave them at the mercy of the heavily armed Serbs . Meanwhile , rebels fired at least three heavy artillery shells into central Bihac , an area supposedly protected by the U.N. forces , stepping_up their assault on the &quot; safe area &quot; and drawing fresh international condemnation . &quot; We are gravely concerned about this attack on civilians in a well-defined safe area , &quot; mission spokesman Paul Risley said . One Bosnian civilian was killed and seven hurt in the attack , he said . U.N. officials had no information on casualties from 204 other artillery rounds fired by Bosnian and Croatian Serbs into the Bihac region . As fighting intensified around Bihac , the first serious effort to extract half of the poorly equipped Bangladeshis from that Serbian-encircled war zone hit a major obstacle when Croatian Serbs demanded that any departing peacekeepers leave in armored vehicles and carry a gun each . The entire 1 # 200-troop battalion has only 300 weapons to defend themselves and the 200 # 000 Bosnian Muslims they were deployed to protect . A military communique from mission headquarters to the U.N. peacekeeping chief in New York deemed the Croatian Serb conditions for a partial withdrawal &quot; unacceptable &quot; because they would &quot; reduce further the operational effectiveness of the Bangladesh battalion. &quot; The Bangladeshis were deployed in mid-October after a hasty withdrawal by the_French battalion that had been stationed around Bihac . Akashi ' s expression of the need for the United Nations to continue its mission despite the current difficulties was echoed in Essen , Germany , where German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is hosting a summit of the European Union . According to the news_agency Reuters , Joachim Bitterlich , Kohl ' s top foreign_policy adviser , said that more_than half of the member countries had stressed the need for the U.N. force to carry_on . &quot; I found an astonishing agreement around the table that UNPROFOR had important tasks to do , that it was crucially important they were there , &quot; Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said . Times staff writer Art Pine in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
