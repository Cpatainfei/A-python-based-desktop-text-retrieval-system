   <HEADLINE> FRANCE SEEKS BAN ON ARTIFICIAL IMPREGNATION OF OLDER WOMEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> France declared Monday that it would seek to become the first country to ban artificial impregnation for post-menopausal women as part of a landmark legislative effort to cope_with the moral and medical dilemmas posed by genetic_engineering . The decision by the_French government to introduce legislation that would stop doctors from helping women past child-bearing age to give_birth was announced Monday by Health Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy , who called it &quot; both immoral and dangerous &quot; for older_women to be implanted with test-tube embryos . Other officials said the bill also will seek to prevent parents from selecting or determining physical and mental characteristics of their future child . &quot; I think it is absolutely shocking that a child can be 18 when his mother is 80 . It is totally undeserved , &quot; Douste-Blazy said in a radio interview . Douste-Blazy urged women considering such a procedure to give more thought to the child , who medical authorities say would be more susceptible to mental and physical handicaps . The phenomenon of &quot; retirement pregnancies &quot; has attracted wide attention in Europe after a 59-year-old British woman gave_birth to twins over Christmas following treatment at an Italian clinic . The mother , who is said to be a wealthy businesswoman , reportedly is married to a 45-year-old man . French officials said the government was particularly alarmed by advances in medical technology that now make_it feasible for women to choose the ethnic identity , physical size or other characteristics of their baby through embryo implants . The government of Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur is expected to unveil new legislation in the Senate within two weeks before taking it to the National Assembly . Passage is considered a virtual certainty because the ruling conservative coalition holds a vast majority in both houses . Some argued that the new law is necessary to reinforce the power of the state to prevent abuses that smack of genetic_engineering . A de_facto bar already prevents women from being implanted with fertilized embryos from eggs other_than their own .</TEXT>
