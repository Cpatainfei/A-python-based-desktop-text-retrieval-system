   <HEADLINE> IRAQ ' S AT IT AGAIN : WILL IT NEVER CHANGE ? ; NEED FOR U.N. CAUTION IN ARMS MONITORING IS REAFFIRMED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Iraq ' s latest exercise in military posturing and provocation along its border with Kuwait comes , surely by no coincidence , just as its diplomatic efforts at the United Nations to have the economic sanctions against it lifted are nearing a climax . For the last two weeks Iraq ' s deputy prime_minister , the smooth , voluble and perennial Tarik Aziz , has been waging what some drolly describe as a &quot; charm offensive &quot; aimed at generating support for ending the sanctions , which were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 . Later this month the Security_Council is scheduled to hear from Rolf Ekeus , who heads the U.N. commission that is supposed to make_sure Iraq no longer builds or is hiding nuclear , chemical or biological weapons , or missiles to deliver them . Ekeus has overseen the construction of an elaborate monitoring system designed to detect Iraqi cheating . That system is to be tested for six months . If it ' s found to work , and Iraq is found to be in compliance with U.N. resolutions , the Security_Council will be asked to lift the sanctions . Two weeks ago we wrote that , under the right conditions , lifting the sanctions would be in_order . The key condition , of course , is close monitoring of the kind that the Ekeus commission has planned . Additionally , we cited the need for Iraq to give_up its spurious territorial claim to Kuwait and the need for it to accept permanent international monitoring of its imports so that it can ' t secretly reacquire a threatening weapons capability . These conditions continue to be urgent . Now , however , fresh doubts have been raised about how effectively the whole of Iraq can be monitored by technical means . These put the sanctions issue in a new light . In a recent speech CIA Director R . James Woolsey accused Iraq of &quot; accelerating construction of deep underground shelters and tunnels to produce and store weapons of mass destruction. &quot; A_few days ago a CIA spokesman expressed concern that Iraq &quot; is still hiding Scud missiles , chemical munitions and its entire biological weapons warfare program , &quot; presumably in beneath-ground sites that couldn ' t be reached by conventional bombing . These weapons and the Scuds were all supposed to have been destroyed . The CIA ' s concerns about on-going Iraqi duplicity raise the most serious questions , serious enough , certainly , so that the evidence on which they are based should be put before the Security_Council before it begins to debate lifting the sanctions . Iraq ' s troop movements near Kuwait may be prelude to military_action or they may be nothing more_than a clumsy attempt to try to convince the world that it still is capable of using a military option if the sanctions aren ' t lifted . If so , as President Clinton warned Friday , Iraq shouldn ' t again miscalculate by misreading U.S. resolve . As an earnest of that resolve he has put some U.S. forces on alert and ordered naval strength in the Persian_Gulf increased . Meanwhile , the question of whether Iraq has been able to elude U.N. monitoring of its unconventional weapons programs becomes increasingly compelling . If the CIA ' s findings are right , then lifting the sanctions would of course be unthinkable . The immediate need , then , is to lay all_the evidence that points to Iraqi cheating before the Security_Council , so that other key U.N. members can draw the proper conclusions .</TEXT>
