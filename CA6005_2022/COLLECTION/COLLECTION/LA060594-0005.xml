   <TEXT> A magnificent and awesome military operation , and a moment of acute symbolism as the liberation of Europe began , D-day itself was not a great battle by the bloody standards of modern war . At Omaha Beach , the scene of the worst confusion if not the hardest fighting of invasion day , the Americans had 2 # 220 casualties , mainly from the Rangers and the 1st Division . At Utah Beach , where the terrain was less hostile and the defenders more demoralized , the American 4th Division suffered 187 casualties . These amounted to about 5 % of their losses in the training disaster earlier in the year at Slapton Sands . By contrast , the U.S. Marines had lost 3 # 500 men in the amphibious_assault on the single Japanese-held island of Tarawa . These casualty figures are collated by Stephen Ambrose , best known as the biographer of Eisenhower and Nixon ; and for someone looking_for just one among the flood of D-day books , his is the one to obtain . And yet Ambrose never really proves the contention of his subtitle , that D-day was &quot; the climactic battle of World_War II. &quot; This is partly because of a fundamental change in the way military history is now written . Historians used to rely_on the maps and the plans and the orders of generals , in which armies are portrayed by arrows sweeping around flanks . But the surging growth of oral history in the recollections of individual soldiers has changed our perspective . A style of modern history pioneered by Cornelius Ryan , whose 30-year-old &quot; The Longest Day &quot; still reads marvelously well , this grunt ' s-eye view of chaos , blood and panic interspersed with moments of boredom and humor , is how battles are experienced . But they are not the full story of the way wars are decided . And World_War_II was not decided on the Normandy beaches . On June 23 , just 17 days after D-day , Hitler ' s Army Group Centre on the Eastern Front lost five divisions ( over 50 # 000 men ) at Vitebsk alone . Part of Operation Bagration , this parallel and simultaneous Soviet battle that smashed the German army and cleared the way to Warsaw , puts D-day into proportion . Until the invasion , the_British and U.S. troops never faced more_than a dozen German divisions . Even after D-day , they never fought more_than 60 . The Red Army fought and beat over 200 divisions and the bulk of the panzer armies . The great merit of Gerhard Weinberg ' s monumental history of the war as_a_whole is to remind us of the vast sweep of the conflict , industrial as well as strategic . In Stephen Ambrose ' s riveting book , this industrial component of D-day is brought_home when he quotes the comment of Gen . Eisenhower that &quot; the man who won the war for us &quot; was Andrew Higgins . In the teeth of official opposition , he designed , built and forced into production the essential landing_craft . From the almost token chapters given to the non-American role in D-day in this spate of 50th anniversary books , a casual reader might miss the fact that the Americans were a minority of the invading force . The Canadians at Juno Beach suffered rather worse than had the Americans at Omaha , losing 1 # 200 men , or one in 18 of those committed , compared to the U.S. loss of one in 19 up the coast at Omaha . Even so , compared to the first serious test of Hitler ' s coastal defenses , the disastrous Dieppe raid in 1942 , Juno Beach was a cakewalk . At Dieppe , the 2nd Canadian Division had taken more_than 6 # 000 casualties in six hours . And the_British , thanks in part to their special tanks , took only 630 casualties at Sword Beach and about 400 at Gold Beach , as they put 55 # 000 men ashore . But with the exception of the Americans at Omaha , who stumbled upon the good Wehrmacht units of General Kraiss ' 352nd Division , the Allies were fighting a ragbag force , the gleanings on which Hitler depended after five years of war . At Utah Beach , Lt . Robert Brewer of the 101st Airborne captured four Koreans in German uniform . Originally conscripted by the Japanese , they had been captured and forced to fight by the Red Army , and then captured yet again and made to fight by the Germans . At the time of the invasion , every sixth rifleman in the Wehrmacht forces in France was from an &quot; Ost &quot; battalion , captured Russians and Poles and Ukrainians and Balts . Germany was exhausted . The average age of the troops in the 709th Division , based in the Cotentin peninsula , was 36 . It was not just luck that put the Allied troops ashore in Normandy , where the defenses were relatively feeble , but planning . The best German troops , the six panzer divisions , were stuck_in the Pas de Calais , where Hitler believed the real invasion was coming . A complex deception operation , with fake radio_signals from fake Headquarters , succeeded brilliantly in fooling the Germans . But if those Panzer divisions were not available to repel the invasion in its most vulnerable first few hours , they had to be fought later , in the long-grinding battles of June and July as the Allies tried to break_out from their beachhead . Under Gen . Montgomery , the_British attacks repeatedly failed . But they drew to their front around Caen the bulk of the German armor , opening the way for the Americans under Gen . Omar Bradley and Gen . George Patton to break_out into the heart of France . Nigel Hamilton ' s new book on Montgomery , an edited and truncated version of his three-volume biography , refights the rather silly postwar squabble of the Allied generals and their memoirs . Yes , Monty was a crotchety and arrogant ally who stretched the truth to claim that he had planned the American breakout all along . But with his first command decision in January of 1944 , insisting that the Allied assault be made with five divisions rather than three , Monty probably won the battle . The point about D-day was that it was not a single event , but part of a long campaign . With hindsight , we might even say that for the future , the battle of Arnhem three months later in September , 1944 , was more significant . Arnhem was a battle that concerned far more_than the defeat of Germany ; it was about the postwar map of Europe . The goal was for the_British and American armies to use an airborne landing to bounce their way across the Rhine and into the heart of Germany before winter set_in . The ambition was clear . With Germany ' s industrial heartland of the Ruhr under their guns , the Anglo-Americans could occupy Germany before the Russians did . Defeat at Arnhem kept the Western Allies on the wrong side of the Rhine until the spring of 1945 and helped define the parameters of the Cold_War itself . But that was not how it felt_for the lonely parachutists , landing in the blackness of a hostile Normandy night . It was not how it seemed for the bewildered infantry of the U.S. 1st Division , dumped ashore at the wrong place , under intense fire and with most of their tanks sinking to the seabed . For that flavor of D-day , Russell Miller ' s &quot; Nothing Less Than Victory &quot; is the most useful account , with each interview telling a coherent soldier ' s tale . Richard Goldstein , Ronald Drez and Gerald Astor have produced almost interchangeable narratives , peppered with ill-organized and random individual reminiscence . Collectively , they show how not to use the rich archives of oral history , the largest collection of individual accounts of a single battle anywhere in the world , which are now gathered at the National D-Day Museum at New Orleans . Stephen Ambrose ' s book relies rather than depends_upon them , using the intense personal perspective to illuminate a battle that amounted to rather more_than the sum of individual experiences . It took another 11 months of fighting , but D-day began the great peace that began to civilize Europe . It marked the moment when the fractious and warlike European tribes began to come under the adult supervision of the United States and Soviet_Union , two superpowers with far too_much at stake to permit the endless squabbles of the Old_World to rise again . More_than just a peace , a kind of miracle emerged , in which the Europeans laid_aside their martial pasts and adapted comfortably to the extraordinary new role of an economic giant that chose -- perhaps for the first time in history -- not to spend that wealth on becoming a military superpower . The real essence of that European decision , whatever the inter-alliance squabbles along the way , was trust in the Americans as an honorable ally and a reliable custodian of the stability and the democratic hopes of Europe . And the real meaning of D-day was that it symbolized the moment when that trust was earned , in blood .</TEXT>
