   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : SANDERS ' BURST OF SPEED LEAVES 49ER TEAMMATE SMILING IN DUST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Merton Hank , a 49er cornerback , commenting to C.W. Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle on Deion Sanders ' 74-yard interception return for a touchdown against New Orleans on Sunday : &quot; He may be the fastest person I have ever seen on the field . When he made that cutback , he went from second_gear to third and was instantly in the open . I said , ' Oh , my goodness. ' &quot; * Trivia time : Who was the only man to coach teams representing three institutions in Rose Bowl games ? * Perspective : Oliver McCall , the new_World Boxing Council heavyweight champion , told Ron Borges of the Boston Globe that he was a bad kid growing_up . &quot; When I done dangerous things , it was such fun , &quot; McCall said . &quot; Getting_into the ring is not as dangerous as going_into someone ' s house when you ' re not sure if you ' re going to get your head blown off. &quot; * Boilermaker clan : Emmett Zitelli , a sophomore center , was destined to play football for Purdue . His father , Bob , is a real-life boilermaker . So was his grandfather , Pete . And his great-great grandfather , an Italian immigrant , was a railroad boilermaker . * Now hear this : Bob Ryan in the Boston Globe : &quot; The Three Absolute Dumbest Things Anyone Could Do In Sports Today : &quot; 1 . 49ers convert Jerry Rice to nose tackle . 2 . Rockets trade Hakeem Olajuwon for Acie Earl . 3 . National Hockey_League fails to open ' 94-95 season on time. &quot; * Desperation ? Safety Dennis Smith , 35 , former USC standout , was brought_out of retirement by the Denver Broncos to play against the Buffalo Bills on Monday night . &quot; I thought it was going_to be a P.R. move until I found_out I was starting , &quot; Smith said . &quot; If they were 3-0 , I would n ' t be here. &quot; * Gone_with the wind : Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer gloating over Buddy Ryan ' s 0-3 record as coach of the Arizona Cardinals : &quot; Now that Jerry Glanville is gone , there is no one in the National Football_League that the coaching fraternity would rather whip than the self-trumpeting wind bag in the desert. &quot; * Add Ryan : &quot; The Coach has a bar and grill near the stadium and now the disgruntled say that there is a sandwich there named for Buddy Ryan . &quot; ' Uh-huh , ' &quot; goes the punch_line , &quot; ' a little tongue and a lot of baloney. ' &quot; * Bonus : Miami Hurricane center K.C. Jones , who has the same last_name as six of his teammates : &quot; There ' s one neat thing . I get my whole_name on my jersey. &quot; * Looking_back : On this day in 1923 , Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees hit his first major_league home_run , against Bill Piercy of the Boston Red Sox . On the same date 15 years later , Gehrig hit his 493rd and last homer , against Dutch Leonard of the Washington Senators . * Trivia answer : Hugo Bezdek , who coached Oregon , 1917 , the Mare Island Marines , 1918 , and Penn State , 1923 . * Quotebook : New Orleans Saint defensive end Frank Warren , after a game in Tampa : &quot; It was so hot I saw a dog chasing a cat , and they were both walking. &quot; MAL FLORENCE</TEXT>
