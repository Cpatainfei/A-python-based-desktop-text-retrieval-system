   <HEADLINE> TEAM PLAYERS ; THEY ARE THE MENDERS OF BROKEN HEARTS . FOLLOW THE DOCTORS , NURSES AND TECHNICIANS THROUGH HEART_SURGERY AS THEIR CLOCKWORK PRECISION SAVES A MAN ' S LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is not quite 6:30 on a chilly Monday morning , but already Operating Room 14 at St . Joseph Medical_Center in Burbank is flooded with light . The stark , white-walled room is crammed with monitors , intravenous lines , a heart-lung_machine and other expensive equipment . But oddly , it ' s the boombox that ' s secured from thieves . On the operating table , Ed Gillespie is drowsy but still conscious as he awaits coronary_bypass surgery . In an hour , the 63-year-old retired Burbank letter_carrier will be joined by an often overlooked and underappreciated group of medical workers : the surgical team . Each day in the United States , these teams of men and women , their faces almost obscured behind masks , enter operating_rooms . And when they emerge , a baby ' s been born , a brain_tumor removed or , in the case of Ed Gillespie , a heart ' s been fixed . Who are they ? This morning , 13 people -- doctors , nurses , technicians and technologists -- will tend to Gillespie . Despite their diverse personalities and backgrounds , they will blend into a harmonious unit over the next five hours as they work feverishly to improve the blood flow to Gillespie ' s heart . During the procedure , Gillespie ' s heart will be stilled while a heart-lung_machine takes_over , and blood_vessels will be borrowed from other parts of his body and stitched to the coronary_arteries so that clogged vessels are bypassed . As preparations for surgery continue , the operating room is transformed into a kind of sterile stage . Team member after team member arrives , their noses and mouths covered by sterile masks . Age ranges are wide , with seniority claimed by Dr. Taro Yokoyama , the head surgeon fondly dubbed &quot; the King of Hearts , &quot; and nurse Betsy Stocking , both 60 . Most members have worked_on the St . Joe team with Yokoyama for the past four years , ever since he expanded his practice from St . Vincent Medical_Center in Los Angeles . Each team member is handpicked by Yokoyama , and competition to join is stiff . Some workers are hospital employees , others are employed by Yokoyama and still others are independent contractors . Some are gregarious ; others quiet . And proving that vanity is alive and well even when the fashion statement you ' re making consists_of dull green scrubs and caps , the men groan that they should have shaved when a photographer asks to snap their picture ; women beg_off until they can find their eyeliner . Beneath the joviality and differences lies a shared passion for what they consider a miracle . No matter how many times they go_into an operating room , the results still amaze them . On this particular Monday , here ' s how the team managed the miracle one more time . * 6:45 a.m. If surgery were politics , the anesthesiologist would be the advance man . Dr. James Wickham is standing at the head of the operating table , overseeing anesthesia administration . But earlier this morning , a nurse had already followed his orders to administer a sedative to Gillespie in his room on 3 North . Soon after , Rosa Ordenes , the surgery technician assigned to wheel Gillespie to the operating room , arrived . Ordinarily she tries to make small_talk , figuring conversation eases anxiety . &quot; But he didn ' t talk much , &quot; says Ordenes , guessing that the sedative had already done its work . Now the operating room is filling_up as nurses and others take_up their posts . Sarah Campbell , a registered nurse and clinical coordinator , sits at the foot of the operating table . Her job is to record details of the procedure and keep tabs on which supplies are used . Sandy Wu , the scrub_nurse , stands near Yokoyama , ready to provide him with instruments . Stocking , the circulating nurse , will assist Wu . Nurses wrap Gillespie ' s lower body in sterile dressing , leaving the chest area exposed . Off to the side , perfusionists Joseph Berendt and Fred Ferguson are preparing the heart-lung_machine . Berendt and Ferguson have worked together for 21 1 / 2 years -- so_long , Berendt says , that &quot; we sometimes come_up with the same solutions for problems , even though we were thinking independently. &quot; Percy Tapia , the monitoring technician , will keep_an_eye_on the monitors displaying blood_pressure and other parameters of body function . * 7 a.m. Melissa Radley , a physician assistant ( trained to perform routine services such_as outpatient exams and specially trained in surgery ) , arrives_at the sinks outside the OR to scrub_up . Her job is to &quot; harvest &quot; one of the veins to be borrowed . &quot; we ' ll take the saphenous_vein from the right leg , &quot; she says . The vein lies just beneath the skin on the inside of the leg and can be removed without significantly affecting blood flow . &quot; Dr. Yokoyama will tell me in_advance how much he needs. &quot; She guesses eight to 10 inches , but the exact amount is Yokoyama ' s decision . &quot; We call him the magician , &quot; Radley says . Like other team members , Radley openly admires Yokoyama . He understands , for one thing , that physician assistants are there to help doctors and not replace them , she says . Near the scrub sinks , pulmonary technologist Frank Espino stands_by a bank of monitors . He will keep tabs on blood gases throughout the surgery , supplying the perfusionists with running reports of the patient ' s blood oxygenation and other important indicators . He ' s the self-described new kid , having joined the team just three months earlier . * 7:15 a.m. The King of Hearts arrives . Although he performs 300 to 350 open heart procedures a year , each case is unique , he says . And a preoperative angiogram -- an X-ray of blood_vessels -- can only tell so_much . &quot; Occasionally we find additional coronary_artery branches that are not visualized by angiogram that are clogged , &quot; he says . &quot; Sometimes the coronary_artery is covered with fat or scars. &quot; Most likely , Yokoyama predicts , they will do four bypass grafts on Gillespie , but possibly five . &quot; You have to determine that when you open the chest. &quot; Dr. Ann Connor , an assisting surgeon , arrives in the scrub area to confer_with Yokoyama . It ' s decided that she will make rounds and return later to relieve another assisting surgeon , Dr. Mark Dworak . A generation separates Connor and Yokoyama , but it ' s far from a professor-student relationship . In fact , when Connor was fresh out of training , eager to put into practice the surgical methods she had just learned , Yokoyama , she says , &quot; was willing to listen to the new techniques. &quot; * 7:20 a.m. With his team assembled , Yokoyama begins 10 minutes ahead of schedule . He speaks softly to scrub_nurse Wu : &quot; Saw , please. &quot; Working with Dworak directly across the operating table , Yokoyama uses a scalpel to make an incision down the chest and exposes the bone . Next , the medical saw is used to divide the breastbone . After inspection , Yokoyama decides the left internal mammary artery is usable . Dworak and Yokoyama often seem to rely more on glances , gestures and nods than words . Yokoyama is the undisputed orchestra leader in this theater ; everyone awaits his cues . The minute he enters the OR , he is -- and remains -- the center_of_attention . Clearly in his element , he is totally absorbed and focused in the moment . In the hospital corridors , he often walks so briskly he leaves colleagues in his dust . But in the operating room , he works slowly and steadily , depending_on such unhurried attention to yield the perfection he seeks . Says one observer : &quot; It ' s like every surgery is his first surgery. &quot; Says another : &quot; Dr. Yokoyama would stay in the operating room all day if he could. &quot; * 7:45 a.m. The perfusionists get ready to operate the heart-lung_machine , which takes_over the job of the heart and lungs . The machine must oxygenate blood taken from the body and pump it back , and the system must be airtight to avoid complications such_as embolism . Now , the mood grows more intense as the team prepares to go &quot; on bypass. &quot; * 8 a.m. Suddenly , soft music wafts from the boombox , which Wickham has turned_on . The tune is &quot; I ' ll Be Watching You. &quot; Anesthesiologists are the unofficial deejays of the operating room , so Wickham often picks the selections but is open , he says , to requests . Yokoyama prefers classical but Wickham says he finds him easy to please . * 8:15 a.m. The saphenous_vein has been retrieved and Radley holds it up for inspection . &quot; Store it , &quot; Yokoyama says with a nod of approval . The team works in relative quiet now , the spell broken only by clinking of instruments , soft-spoken requests and beeping monitors . Then the wall telephone rings , and nurse Stocking answers it . She turns_to Yokoyama : &quot; You want Dr. Connor now ? &quot; He nods . * 8:40 a.m. Yokoyama is looking_for a suitable site on the heart_muscle to attach the first graft , poking and probing , as Connor returns to relieve Dworak as assisting surgeon . Yokoyama has found his first attachment site . Over the next 90 minutes , he will stitch the four grafts , a painstaking and exacting process made easier by the magnifying lenses , similar to a jeweler ' s loupe , that he wears attached_to an elastic headband . * 10:15 a.m. Gradually , after the rest of the grafts are completed , Gillespie is beginning to be weaned from the heart-lung_machine . Wickham reinflates the lungs . Slowly , the connections from the machine to the body are removed . The blood is rewarmed . The heart , which had been motionless during the graft suturing , is beginning to beat again , slowly at first and then more rapidly . * 10:35 a.m. The surgeons are sensing success : The EKG is normal , blood_pressure steady . Brain_waves , blood gases and urine output all look normal . Surgeons check for bleeding within the chest_cavity and discover none . Gingerly , they insert drainage tubes into the chest area , where they will remain for a day or two . Only then is the decision made to close the chest . * 10:50 a.m. The intense mood becomes a bit more relaxed , reflected by conversations . &quot; Very nice gases , &quot; says Wickham gleefully , reacting to the latest blood gas report . Connor asks Wickham if he ' s on call later and , when he says he isn ' t , she jokingly offers to find the anesthesiologist some work . No thanks , he counters quickly . He has plans . While some team members socialize on a regular basis , the whole team rarely gathers outside the hospital . &quot; If we did , &quot; says one , &quot; we ' d only talk_about work. &quot; At least twice a year , Yokoyama throws a party for the whole team . One ' s usually a barbecue at his home , another a Christmas party . Other_than that , most team members say they use their precious off time to catch_up_with family or friends . * 11 a.m. The retractor that has held the chest open is removed . Wires are used to close the breast bone . &quot; Two more layers , &quot; says Dworak , referring to the two skin layers that must now be sutured closed . He ' s one of the quieter team members , at least on_the_job . Later , asked about his bright green footwear , he launches into an explanation of the benefits of his special clog-like shoes that can be autoclaved . * 11:15 a.m. Gillespie is ready to be transferred to the ICU . &quot; This is the most dangerous time , &quot; Connor notes . The next 24 hours are considered crucial . * Postscript : Ed Gillespie was discharged eight days after surgery . &quot; I feel great , &quot; he reported 2 1 / 2 weeks after surgery . In an effort to keep his arteries healthy , he has given_up cigarettes . His son Ed , who helped him out after surgery , is encouraging him . Gillespie is planning a trip to Las Vegas as soon as his physician allows it and is looking_forward to another hospital date in January : His daughter Heather is having a baby . WHO ' S WHO IN THE OPERATING ROOM * Joseph Berendt , 42 , a perfusionist since 1972 , operates the heart-lung_machine during bypass surgery . &quot; I was always interested in medicine , but finances prevented medical school. &quot; The reward ? &quot; Seeing someone very sick go_on to lead a full life. &quot; * Dr. James Wickham , 34 , was drawn to anesthesiology because patients require a great_deal of close attention . Open heart_surgery still amazes him : &quot; A recent patient was able to watch ' Monday Night Football ' ( just hours after the surgery ) . &quot; * Melissa Radley , a physician assistant for 10 years , first worked as an emergency medical technician on an ambulance but soon grew tired_of the sexism . &quot; They would only let me drive at night , &quot; says Radley , 34 . So she went_back to school . The rewards , she says , are endless . * Dr. Ann Connor , a &quot; thirtysomething &quot; assisting cardiac surgeon , is the first physician in her family . A cardiac surgeon for five years , she recalls dreaming of this job at age 5 . &quot; Doing this is a miracle . It ' s just like flying : You wonder how the planes stay up. &quot; * Sarah Campbell , 52 , a registered nurse and the clinical coordinator for cardiac surgery , was_on her way to becoming an anthropologist , working part time as a hospital admitting clerk . &quot; On a slow night they asked if I wanted to observe a C-section and I was hooked. &quot; * Fred Ferguson , 47 , a perfusionist , emigrated from Scotland after college . After serving in the Army , he trained to be a perfusionist , a job he has had for 25 years . &quot; It doesn ' t get old , especially when we ' re working with children. &quot; * Frank Espino , 40 , a pulmonary technologist , has been in the profession for 20 years . He decided to enter medicine after both maternal grandparents passed_away from tuberculosis . &quot; Medicine does_work , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s truly incredible. &quot; * Betsy Stocking , 60 , a circulating nurse , has been an RN since 1955 . She says the profession has been good to her : &quot; As a single parent , I raised two girls , now 32 and 35. &quot; In her job , she is_on call to assist the scrub_nurse during surgery . * Percy Tapia , 52 , has been a monitoring technician for 14 years . He received training on_the_job after he wanted to progress from his previous hospital job . During the surgery , he carefully watches the operating room monitors that display blood_pressure and other data . * Rosa Ordenes , 49 , a surgery technician , has been working in the field for 14 years . She wheels patients from their rooms to the operating room , often trying to make conversation to ease their anxieties . * Dr. Taro Yokoyama , the primary cardiac surgeon on the team , has performed open heart_surgery for more_than 30 years . Says Yokoyama , 60 , who knew he wanted to be a cardiac surgeon in grade_school : &quot; You do something that helps people and I feel good about it. &quot; * After 20 years on_the_job , Dr. Mark Dworak , an assisting surgeon , is as enthusiastic as a newcomer . &quot; I love my job , &quot; he says . He decided on surgery as a specialty during medical_school . Asked his age , Dworak playfully suggests &quot; above 40 , &quot; then &quot; 45. &quot; He ' s 51 . * Sandy Wu , 37 , a scrub_nurse , knew she wanted to be an RN in high_school , inspired by an aunt in the profession . The draw for the past 12 years ? &quot; You have to be prepared_for the unexpected. &quot; THE PATIENT Ed Gillespie , 63 , a retired postal carrier , first underwent open heart_surgery in 1979 , but it was declared necessary again this year after his cardiologist , Dr. Mohammad Daood , performed an angiogram and discovered the old grafts were blocked .</TEXT>
