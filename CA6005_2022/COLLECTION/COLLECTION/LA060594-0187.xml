   <HEADLINE> FIRST PENSION WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE ; SCANDAL AGAIN POINTS_OUT DANGERS OF LOOSE REGULATION , PROMISES OF HIGH YIELDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The First Pension Corp . scandal moved to bankruptcy court last week , but as investors left angry and frustrated with little news to comfort them , the lingering lesson , especially in_view of loose regulation at state and federal levels , is &quot; let the investor beware. &quot; Investigators say that the company , which declared bankruptcy in late April , allegedly enticed investors to put money into mortgages that did not exist with promises of extraordinarily high annual dividends of up_to 28 % . The Securities and Exchange Commission says that three company principals ran a scheme that used money from later investors to pay dividends to earlier ones . The three top officers of First Pension last week agreed to plead guilty to expected criminal charges in the case and have signed cooperation agreements , according to Leslie Swain , assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles . But with federal investigators alleging that as much as $ 124 million of 8 # 000 investors ' money may have been lost , and with some reduced to networking by computer to commiserate over their missing pension money , the failure of First Pension stands as a cautionary tale in the lure of trust_deeds as an investment offering very high real_estate returns on investment . Promoters of such trust_deeds are not required by the state to have any special expertise in mortgage lending . And regulation is shared by two state agencies that do not share information ; the Department of Real_Estate oversees transactions between individual borrowers and lenders , but if trust_deeds are broken for_sale to more_than one investor , they come under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corporations . Both departments say they lack resources for systematic review of such investment pools . This hole in the safety net in the regulatory apparatus meant , for example , that nobody was watching when owners of First Pension Corp . filed notices in 1987 contending that real_estate investment pools were exempt from regulation as a public_securities offering . Moreover , as a pension administrator , First Pension was subject_to auditing by the U.S. Department_of_Labor , but regional officials of that agency acknowledge they never got_around_to examining its books . Clearly , investments in trust_deeds are very risky anyway , and in need of tighter regulation . But the painful lesson of the scandal for individual investors is that if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .</TEXT>
