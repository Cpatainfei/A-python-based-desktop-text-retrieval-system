   <HEADLINE> STRONG STORM TO BRING THREAT OF MUDSLIDES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A strong and complex storm system was poised to strike the coast of Southern California before dawn today , raising fears of more destructive landslides in areas stripped of vegetation during last fall ' s devastating brush_fires . The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood watch for the burn areas from midnight until noon today . Forecasters said that up_to two inches of rain could fall_in the coastal areas and up_to four inches in some foothill communities before the system -- combining a cold storm from the Gulf of Alaska with warm , moist air from the tropical Pacific -- moves to the east sometime this afternoon . &quot; This system has the potential to cause significant flooding problems , especially in the burn areas , &quot; the National Weather Service said in a special statement issued Wednesday afternoon . &quot; In addition , strong gusty winds are expected. &quot; In Laguna Beach , where hillsides burned bare in last October ' s firestorm are especially vulnerable to heavy rains , two firefighters monitored a storm tracking computer throughout the night in an emergency command center . City public works crews put equipment on standby in case rainfall is heavy enough to cause mudslides . However , officials hope that hay_bales , sandbags and other measures to divert flood water and mud from homes and businesses would keep Laguna Beach relatively free_of damage . Forecasts on Wednesday were anticipating light rain to start in Laguna Beach in the early morning hours today , Battalion Chief Joe McClure said . But heavier rain wasn ' t expected until about 10 a.m. Despite the expenditure of more_than $ 450 # 000 by the city of Malibu on erosion control after last October ' s fires , a similar storm system last week set_off mudslides that surged through at least 25 homes_in the exclusive beachfront community . About a dozen residents were stranded by mudslides in Altadena , another neighborhood hit hard by the fires . &quot; It ' s been a very busy fall and winter , &quot; Inspector Jack Pritchard , a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire_Department , said Wednesday . &quot; Right now , everything ' s fine , but if the forecast holds true , heavy bursts of rain could mean more trouble in Malibu , or Altadena , or any of the other burn areas. &quot; Because of the threat of flash_floods , the department has deployed its swift-water rescue teams , both in helicopters and on the ground . Extra fire crews have been sent to Malibu and Altadena and heavy equipment -- including bulldozers , dump_trucks and skip-loaders -- has been moved_into position . &quot; Sandbags are available at fire_stations in the affected areas , but most of the sandbagging is pretty much done , &quot; Pritchard said . &quot; People have been out there all day getting ready . I guess they ' re pretty much as prepared as they can be. &quot; Curtis Brack , a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. , said the main cold_front from the Alaskan storm will move across Southern California this morning or early this afternoon . &quot; Accompanying the storm is a flow of tropical moisture from near Hawaii , &quot; he said . &quot; The two elements are coming_together over California , and the result will be some locally heavy rain and some thunderstorms . I think there will be some problems. &quot; Brack said that in Southern California , the heaviest rain probably will fall late this morning and early this afternoon , with scattered showers lingering until Friday . The snow level in local mountains is expected to start at about 8 # 000 feet , dropping to about 4 # 000 feet after nightfall . &quot; It looks_like variable cloudiness will continue through the weekend , &quot; Brack said . &quot; And there may be some scattered showers again on Sunday and Monday. &quot; High_temperatures in the Los Angeles metropolitan area for the next few days should range from the upper 50s to the middle 60s , with lows mostly in the upper 40s . The top reading at the Los Angeles Civic Center_on Wednesday was 69 degrees , after an overnight low of 57 . Total rainfall for the season stood at 3.37 inches , which is about a third of the normal total of 9.6 inches for the date and about one-sixth of last year ' s total by Feb . 16 of 19.82 inches . The rainfall season is measured from July 1 through June 30 .</TEXT>
