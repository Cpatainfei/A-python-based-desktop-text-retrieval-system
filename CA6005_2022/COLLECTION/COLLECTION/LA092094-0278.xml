   <HEADLINE> THE MAN WHO MAKES THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE FIT ; MEDICINE : MARK SKOLNICK ' S TEAM DISCOVERED THE GENE THAT CAUSES INHERITED BREAST_CANCER . HE SAYS HE EMPATHIZES WITH WHAT THE WOMEN GO THROUGH BECAUSE HE HAS HIS OWN GENETIC DISORDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For most researchers , a major genetic breakthrough is a once-in-a-lifetime experience . Mark Skolnick has had three , two of them just within the past six months . He was a key player in the mid 1970s in the development of restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) , a crucial technology in identifying virtually every disease-causing gene isolated over the last decade . He headed a team that in April announced the discovery of a tumor-suppressor gene that may be involved in more_than half of all cancers . But his masterpiece achievement , and the one that may bring this University of Utah researcher his first true measure of fame , came last week when Skolnick and his colleagues announced the discovery of the most important gene that causes inherited breast_cancer . The gene is carried by an estimated 600 # 000 U.S. women , 85 % of whom will develop the disease by the time they are 65 . Isolation of the gene , scientists predict , will allow identification of women at high risk , allowing them to closely monitor their health to catch the disease at an early stage while it is most curable . The discovery also provides the first firm information about what causes breast_cancer , and should thus offer insight into the genesis of non-hereditary breast tumors as well . &quot; The discovery is an extraordinary advance for cancer research , &quot; said fellow geneticist Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University . By the end of the week , Skolnick was hoarse from both a bout with bronchitis and the incessant telephone and television interviews -- from local TV to network morning shows . The excitement , he said , &quot; really pleased &quot; his family , which includes two sons , Giancarlo and Joshua Luca , who is named for two of Skolnick ' s mentors . Despite the jubilation about the new finding , celebrations have been low-key . The completion of the paper was marked with low-fat tortilla_chips , for example , because Skolnick found_out this summer that he suffers from his own genetic problem , a potentially fatal lipid disorder called Syndrome X that leaves him highly susceptible to heart_disease . It was identified after doctors found that he had sugar in his urine , a kidney_stone and other &quot; annoying &quot; medical problems . Syndrome X , he said , &quot; kills people in their 40s and 50s. &quot; Skolnick is 48 . Discovery of_his_own genetic_disorder has given him new empathy for women who have inherited the breast_cancer gene , he noted in a telephone_interview . It has also brought a sharp change in his lifestyle . Although he has always enjoyed trips to the desert and hiking and skiing in the nearby Wasatch Mountains , the pattern has become more regimented , with daily walks with his wife , Angela . He is also on a fat-free diet . Friends and colleagues who call him an intense and driven researcher in the laboratory now use the same words to describe his efforts to take_charge of his health . Skolnick himself noted proudly that he has &quot; lost 19 pounds in the last two months -- no , make that 16 . I lost three before I started the diet. &quot; The Utah mountains he now visits regularly were not , however , what lured this self-described &quot; California Jewish boy &quot; to Salt_Lake_City in 1974 after he completed his education at UC Berkeley and Stanford . Rather , it was the large Mormon population in Utah and the surrounding states . The Mormons represent a unique population , experts agree . They don ' t smoke and they don ' t drink . They don ' t often move away from the area , and neither do their children . They keep extensive family genealogies . In short , they are a dream population for an epidemiologist trying to track_down genetic_diseases . But few geneticists were perceptive enough to recognize their potential , and the population lay fallow until Skolnick ' s arrival . &quot; He was ahead of his time in terms of his insight in starting to use the Mormon pedigrees , &quot; said molecular biologist Andy Futreal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park , N.C. &quot; It was a bold move to leave Berkeley and move_out into the desert , &quot; added Roger Wiseman , Futreal ' s colleague . &quot; He dedicated many years to collecting the families and setting_up the Utah Genealogical Data Base , &quot; which now contains the names of , and critical heath information about , more_than 1.3 million people . Records in the data base can show , for example , how strongly a disease such_as cancer clusters in particular families and enable researchers to track it over several generations . Perhaps most importantly , the registry provides a source of blood samples from both affected and unaffected family members that allow researchers to use sophisticated molecular_biology techniques to isolate genes . The data base made the discovery of the breast_cancer gene possible . &quot; I don ' t think that it could have been done anywhere else , &quot; said Dr. Randall Burt , a medical geneticist at the University of Utah . &quot; It ' s not that it absolutely could not have been done elsewhere . . . . It ' s just that it would have been immensely more difficult. &quot; Lured by the data base , more_than 100 geneticists have descended on the previously sleepy Salt_Lake_City campus , converting it into a hotbed of genetic research that announces genetic discoveries with great regularity . Ironically , one who was attracted was Raymond White , the researcher who identified a major colon_cancer gene . White has been more successful than Skolnick at capturing research funds and has a large laboratory in a new building on campus , while Skolnick operates out of a research park half a mile out of town . White and Skolnick share an intense -- and , colleagues say , a sometimes acrimonious -- competition . One of Skolnick ' s colleagues said his first thought on seeing the paper was , &quot; I ' ll bet White is eating his liver. &quot; &quot; They are two big fish in a relatively small pond , &quot; said geneticist Laurence Meyer of the University of Utah . White could not be reached for comment , and Skolnick was reluctant to discuss the relationship . But he did say that the competition &quot; is not any different than other relationships , which are either positive or negative , just the way human_beings are. &quot; Skolnick ' s team is now pursuing a variety of other genes involved in cancer and heart_disease -- including one newly added_to the list , the gene for Syndrome X . His 3-year-old company , Myriad Genetics Inc. , is also working rapidly to develop diagnostic tests for breast_cancer and other types of cancer , based on the two discoveries . Skolnick is the idea man and synthesizer for the group , the person who collects little bits of data produced in the laboratory and puts them together into a coherent picture , analyzing , interpreting and predicting . He does little laboratory work himself . &quot; I spend most of my time on the telephone , &quot; he noted . Ultimately , said Utah ' s Meyer , &quot; We are left with a bright guy who has a good , balanced life . He works hard , he plays hard . He ' s been at it a long_time , and he has stayed_on task . This ( the breast_cancer gene ) is just one of several fruits he ' ll be able to pluck. &quot;</TEXT>
