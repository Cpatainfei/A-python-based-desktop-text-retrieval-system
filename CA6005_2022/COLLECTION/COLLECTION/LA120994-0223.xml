   <HEADLINE> SEISMIC PANEL OKS REPORT ON NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE ; SAFETY : DOCUMENT IS APPROVED MOSTLY IN CONCEPT , WITH MANY DETAILS TO BE WORKED_OUT BY STAFF . FINAL STUDY WON ' T BE READY UNTIL NEXT MONTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state Seismic Safety Commission on Thursday adopted its overdue report to Gov . Pete Wilson on lessons learned from the Northridge earthquake . But that adoption was mainly in concept , and much of the report ' s final wording remained to be determined . Although the 17-member commission spent hours discussing issues on what future quake mitigation steps should be taken , it broadly revised a draft document and left much of the exact language to the staff . The final report will not be issued until next month . &quot; We ' re adopting the document , subject_to the editorial work we have to do , &quot; said Commission Chairman Paul Fratessa , a structural engineer from Oakland . Wilson had originally directed that the report be submitted Sept . 1 . But a Wilson aide who attended part of the session , insurance adviser Marjorie Berte , said the governor ' s office is more interested in having a quality report than one produced on_time . From the discussion Thursday , the commission seems unwilling to make many forceful recommendations , although it agreed to call_for giving the state Building Standards Commission more authority to revise and implement earthquake construction standards . The commission went no further than encouraging local_government to undertake quake retrofitting of single-family homes after one of its members , Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson , said that to use stronger language would &quot; open a can of worms &quot; that would be &quot; politically unpalatable. &quot; Commission members also avoided a hard-line on the_matter of code revisions for new and existing buildings . They said local authorities should be given until 2000 to adopt retrofitting and additional hazard reduction plans and until 2020 to implement them . The commission ' s role is strictly advisory , and it has no enforcement powers . On the question of steel-framed buildings , a number of which cracked during the Northridge quake , the commission decided that firm recommendations were premature , because , as Bernson said , it is not yet known what effective corrective steps can be taken_to guard against damage from future quakes . One member who often pressed for stronger and more precise language was Caltech engineering professor Wilfred Iwan , a former chairman of the commission . Iwan said it was vital for the commission &quot; to take the responsibility for building safety in California &quot; and to develop a specified process that would achieve that end . The commission meets next in Northridge on Jan . 12 . Fratessa said no concepts will now be altered , but details may be changed .</TEXT>
