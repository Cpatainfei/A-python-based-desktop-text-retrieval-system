   <TEXT> The gods must be happy . It was , after all , the Mount_Olympus crowd -- Zeus , Hermes , Apollo , that bunch -- who inspired the Olympic Games . But only now , so many sunbaked summers later , is there finally a local rooting interest in an off-year international athletics extravaganza . The Greeks , 2 # 000 years after they got the world playing , are in America to play in their first World Cup . Don ' t laugh . They think they have a fighting chance for a second-round berth . With all due respect_to Hellenic prowess , the main ingredient for this year ' s European-newcomer success story is as much peanut_butter as pita bread . His name is Alketas ( Alkis ) Panagoulias . He is the national team coach and a legend in Greece , larger than life . He is Poseidon , spanner of the seas , a thoroughly Greek hero who happens also to be an immigrant to the United States , an American citizen for 25 years . In suburban Vienna , Va. , where Panagoulias has lived for a decade , his Greek role has made him a latter-day celebrity : the only American coach in the World Cup , he likes to say . Of course , nobody in any Vienna noticed those obscure years , 1982-85 , when Panagoulias coached the U.S. national team , and the American team at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles . He hasn ' t changed since . Panagoulias , 60 , is an inspirational coach of no-secrets soccer with a simple credo : &quot; Attack from the start. &quot; He likes a simple , fast , aggressive game . To play it , he has assembled a team of believers fervent enough to retake Troy . &quot; We are in deep waters and we must learn to swim , &quot; Panagoulias says . &quot; This is Greek soccer ' s big chance to get known around the world . Our biggest weapon is our fighting spirit and the burning desire to win . Our weakness is that we often lose our concentration during a match and this may prove disastrous. &quot; In May tune-ups , Greece lost big to Cameroon and England but played to respectable ties against Cup-bound Bolivia and the United States . &quot; We are doing_better with each passing day . The team did better than in the previous friendlies ; I expect to be ready when the time of truth comes , &quot; Panagoulias said after the U.S. game . A more telling harbinger of the Greek future might have come last weekend in New York , where new power Colombia walloped Greece , 2-0 . Serious professional soccer is only about one decade old in Greece , and crowds average only about 10 # 000 for Sunday matches . Still , when Panagoulias was rehired in 1992 to the coaching_job he had held from 1973-81 , Greece had failed in a dozen consecutive attempts to qualify for the Cup . A 1-1 tie with Russia on May 23 , 1993 , ended the drought and left Greece giddy . If Zeus really had been paying_attention , Greece would n ' t have to make its debut against superpower Argentina . But Panagoulias has a plan he thinks will get a boost from enthusiastic Greeks and Greek-Americans at first-round games in Boston and Chicago . Tying the_Argentines and beating either Nigeria or Bulgaria , Panagoulias says , should be enough to let Greece slide into the second round as a third-place qualifier . One thing certain is that Greece will play with passion : &quot; I want your soul fully dedicated to this team , &quot; Panagoulias told an early draft of Cup hopefuls . To carry the flag further than Greece has traveled in soccer , Panagoulias has assembled a team that blends youth and experience . Greece ' s greatest hopes ride_on the feet of 21-year-old striker phenom Nikos Machlas . What he lacks in experience , Machlas makes_up in exuberance and smart positioning , particularly inside the penalty area . He might become the first Greek recruited to play abroad . Counterpoint to young Machlas is high-scoring 36-year-old Tassos Mitropoulos , the dean of the Greek team , who has played in more_than 70 international matches and is nicknamed &quot; Rambo &quot; for his explosive attacks . Veterans Nikos Tsiantakis , the team ' s best left-footer , and Panagiotis Tsalouhidis will anchor the midfield and could trouble opposition defenders . The defense should focus_on right back Stratos Apostolakis , who has played nearly 60 international matches and is considered one of the best Greek players in the past decade . The goalkeeper will be another veteran , 35-year-old Antonis Minou , at 6-feet-4 the tallest player on a big team . &quot; If they do_well at the finals they ' ll be treated as gods , &quot; soccer official Alexis Dedes said . Are you listening , Zeus ?</TEXT>
