   <HEADLINE> UAW DISPUTE WITH CATERPILLAR JUST CRAWLS ALONG ; LABOR : STRIKE AT MAKER OF EARTHMOVING EQUIPMENT EXEMPLIFIES SIMMERING BATTLES BETWEEN OLD-LINE UNIONS AND INDUSTRIAL BEHEMOTHS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the picket_line outside Caterpillar ' s sprawling tractor plant , John McCoy uses his head to display his disdain for his employer of 29 years : He wears a John Deere cap . Just up the street , a union billboard painted in Caterpillar ' s bold yellow colors announces : &quot; You are entering a war zone . Caterpillar vs . its UAW employees. &quot; Such are the symbols of the nation ' s longest ongoing labor confrontation . Caterpillar and its 14 # 000 United Auto Workers union_members have been at a bitter impasse for nearly three years . And there is no end in_sight . The labor strife escalated last month when the UAW announced a nationwide strike affecting 12 plants in Illinois , Pennsylvania and Colorado . In part , the walkout appears timed to focus attention on Caterpillar just as the U.S. Senate is considering legislation -- already approved by the House -- that would bar companies from hiring permanent replacements for striking workers . The UAW ended a 163-day strike in 1992 , when Caterpillar threatened to do just that . But the strife at Cat -- the world ' s largest producer of earthmoving and construction equipment -- has deeper roots . It exemplifies the long-simmering battles between powerful old-line unions that want to keep hard-earned wages , benefits and protective work rules and industrial behemoths seeking the cost controls and flexibility to be globally competitive . Over the last decade or more -- with the UAW ' s complicity -- Caterpillar has modernized its factories , reorganized operations to improve efficiency , boosted exports and earned record profits . But those gains could be fleeting unless the company achieves a lasting labor peace . While the dispute is centered in Peoria -- the world headquarters of Caterpillar and a working-class city that has long symbolized Main_Street , U.S.A. -- the outcome will have a much broader impact , particularly for organized labor , whose clout has declined dramatically in the past 20 years . The standoff is unusual -- not only for its length and complexity , but also because it seems a throwback to another era , when contract disputes led to long strikes with macho displays of raw , muscular power . Labor experts say the trend today is toward labor-management cooperation , not confrontation . Indeed , Caterpillar workers , even those on the picket_line , do not come_across as firebrands . Many have grown weary of the dispute and complain of being pawns in a power struggle between union leaders and company management . Caterpillar has a long history of poor labor relations . In 1982 , the UAW struck for more_than 200 days . But as the industrial Midwest was decimated by recession and foreign competition in the 1980s , labor and management at Caterpillar made a major effort at teamwork . One example : an employee involvement program in which management solicited the ideas of shop-floor workers to improve factory operations and efficiency . Such cooperation , however , halted in 1991 when contract talks broke_down . The reason : Caterpillar refused to accept a &quot; pattern &quot; contract that the UAW had negotiated with competitor John Deere &amp; Co . and expected to impose on Cat . In November , 1991 , the UAW struck Caterpillar plants in East Peoria and Decatur , Ill . The strike eventually spread to other plants , with salaried workers stepping_in to run production_lines . By the following February , the company had declared an impasse and implemented its last contract offer . Caterpillar told all workers to return , saying it would replace those who did not . As thousands of applications poured in_for replacement jobs , about 1 # 000 UAW members crossed the picket_lines . The union ended the strike . The two sides still have not returned to the bargaining table . Up until the recent walkout , an unstable peace existed in the plants . The union had urged employees to &quot; work to rules , &quot; doing no more_than required to keep one ' s job . Managers were vigilant of any attempts to disrupt operations . Despite the labor strife , Caterpillar has flourished under the leadership of Chairman Donald Fites . The company spent nearly $ 2 billion in upgrading its plants in the last seven years . It expanded overseas , with half its sales coming from abroad . It reorganized into 13 product centers that have improved its ability to respond to market changes quickly . Last year alone it introduced 46 new products . Manufacturing time was cut four-fold in six years . Profits soared in 1993 to $ 652 million , after two years of losses . Cat ' s revenues were $ 11.6 billion , up from $ 10.2 billion in 1992 . In the first_quarter of 1994 , Caterpillar earned a record $ 192 million , its sixth consecutive quarter of higher profits . The company is clearly concerned about the lingering labor conflict . Both the company and union agree that the strife has not hurt quality , but productivity has suffered . &quot; We ' ve taken the steps necessary to compete globally , &quot; said spokesman Terry Thorstenson . &quot; We are quick . We are agile . The only unresolved issue is a signed labor agreement. &quot; But the prospects for that are not good . In recent months , confrontations between workers and managers have escalated in the plants . Jerry Brust , director of labor relations , charges the union is deliberately disrupting operations and provoking managers . The UAW counters that the company has created a hostile work environment . Since late 1992 , the union has filed 92 unfair labor practice charges against Caterpillar . The charges range from banning of union and strike-related insignias worn by workers to dismissing employees for union activities . The union also insists that the most recent strike is over continued unfair labor practices . In a strike on unfair labor practices , workers cannot be permanently replaced ; in a walkout over economic issues , they can . &quot; What prompted this strike is the growing pressure from our members because of the company ' s continued violations of labor laws , &quot; said Jerry Baker , chairman of the UAW ' s central bargaining committee for Caterpillar . The company maintains the union is using the unfair labor practices charges to force it to sign a contract . &quot; We believe the current strike is an economic one , &quot; said Brust . The permanent replacement issue is a hot button to organized labor . Unions have been pressing Congress to ban the use of permanent replacements , because it has tipped the balance_of_power against unions in collective_bargaining . Ever since President Ronald Reagan fired the federal air traffic controllers for an illegal strike in 1981 , more and more companies have opted to replace workers striking over economic issues . President Bill_Clinton has supported the ban . But the outlook for the legislation is bleak this year in the Senate . Caterpillar continues to hold the threat of permanent replacement over striking workers . The day after the walkout , the company placed ads in the local newspaper seeking workers making $ 17 to $ 19 an hour . More_than 1 # 000 applicants brought their resumes to an employment center in suburban Peoria , according to Cat . Brust said the new hires are not permanent , but he won ' t pledge that they will not become permanent replacements .</TEXT>
