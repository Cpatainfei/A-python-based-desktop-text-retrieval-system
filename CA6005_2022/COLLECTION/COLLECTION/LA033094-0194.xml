   <HEADLINE> U.S. PROPOSES CURBS ON BOGUS ASYLUM CLAIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration proposed broad changes in the nation ' s refugee asylum system Tuesday to curb a growing number of bogus claims while speeding_up approval of immigrants genuinely fleeing political , religious or ethnic oppression . The Administration ' s revisions , which drew immediate criticism from private refugee groups , would impose a filing fee on asylum seekers and would force many applicants to wait twice as long for temporary work_permits . The government also would at least double the number of immigration judges and asylum officers assigned to handle the exploding caseload . &quot; We want a balanced system that embodies both compassion and control , &quot; said Doris M . Meissner , commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service . Under the current system , many applicants who have no legitimate claim for asylum file claims so that they can obtain temporary work_permits and remain in the country while their cases are reviewed -- a process that currently averages 18 to 24 months . Those applying for asylum can obtain work authorization in 90 days . That period would be expanded to as long as 180 days under the new procedures . Several private refugee groups protested that the proposed filing fee of $ 130 and the recommended delay for work_permits would unfairly penalize legitimate asylum-seekers . &quot; People who come here have to have some way to exist , &quot; said Father Richard Ryscavage , head of migration and refugee services for the U.S. Catholic Conference . &quot; Having to wait up_to 180 days for work will create a serious burden on the community. &quot; The problem is mushrooming , all agree . Asylum applications nearly tripled to 150 # 386 last year from 56 # 000 in 1991 and the backlog of unprocessed cases has grown to more_than 370 # 000 . &quot; The problem we have faced in recent years , &quot; Meissner said at a news_conference , &quot; is that people with no legitimate claim to asylum are applying in record numbers , some brought by smugglers , some using fake documents and some overstaying the visas granted to them as visitors. &quot; She said that many applications for asylum contain virtually identical information and are purchased by applicants to obtain a work_permit . &quot; Unfortunately , those abusing the system have captured public attention and exacerbated a large application backlog that puts legitimate asylum-seekers at a severe disadvantage , &quot; she said . The proposed changes will be published this week in the Federal Register , with a final version expected by the summer . The new INS system , in the first year or so , would focus only on new applications . Clearly meritorious cases would be approved within 60 days while questionable applications would take_up to six months . Work_permits would be granted only after a case was resolved . Asylum applicants would have to pay a $ 130 filing fee unless they showed that they could not afford it . Meissner said that each application costs an estimated $ 615 to process . &quot; We believe it is only fair to apply some of the costs of asylum adjudication to the people who benefit from it , &quot; she said . Critics , however , said that obtaining a waiver for the filing fee could be difficult and could add_to the backlog of cases . The INS is asking Congress for $ 64 million in fiscal 1995 to more_than double the number of asylum officers , to 334 from 150 . The parent Justice_Department also is expected to double the number of immigration judges , to 170 from 85 . In addition , the immigration service will begin fingerprinting asylum applicants to eliminate duplicate applications in different U.S. cities under different names . Refugee organizations critical of the new filing fee and the new waiting period for work_permits include the Catholic Conference , the U.S. Committee for Refugees , the American Immigration Lawyers Assn . and the Open Society Institute .
