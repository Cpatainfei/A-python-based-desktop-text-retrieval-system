   <HEADLINE> COUNTY TO SPEND MORE TO BATTLE TUBERCULOSIS ; HEALTH : SUPERVISORS OK $ 1.5-MILLION OUTLAY FOR ADDITIONAL WORKERS AT SCHOOLS , CLINICS AND JAILS . TESTING PROGRAM IS PLANNED AT SCHOOLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the hope of preventing more local outbreaks of tuberculosis , the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved spending an extra $ 1.5 million to help public health officials fight the disease . The Orange County Health_Care Agency will use the money to hire 33 more health workers for schools , clinics and jails . Health officials plan to test all first-time students from first_grade through high_school this fall and to open tuberculosis clinics across the county . From 1990 through 1993 , the number of new cases of tuberculosis reported annually in the county increased 71 % , from 258 to 440 . The unusual midyear budget increase will strengthen the county ' s previous $ 5-million anti-tuberculosis program , which includes a 70-person staff . &quot; The idea was to get started right away , &quot; Board Chairman Thomas F . Riley said . &quot; This is certainly , in my opinion , one of the most important public health items that has come_to the board since I ' ve been_on it . I ' m really proud_of the county staff for their ingenuity in getting this thing set_up and moving_in a hurry. &quot; Penny Weismuller , the county ' s manager of disease control , said she was pleased that the board approved the funds without waiting for the usual budget process to take its course . &quot; This gives us the resources to move ahead and do a more effective job_controlling this disease , &quot; she said . It will also allow health_care workers to monitor more closely the treatment of people who are infected . Board_members previously had said they considered the program to be a top priority and were alarmed by the outbreak last year of drug-resistant tuberculosis at La Quinta High_School in Westminster . In that outbreak , active cases of the disease were diagnosed in 12 students , with all_the cases linked to that of a 16-year-old girl . Federal_officials later concluded that the outbreak at La Quinta was sparked by delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment of the girl , whose disease was contagious for more_than two years . An official with the U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control in Atlanta has said that Orange County is among many public health_care agencies throughout the nation surprised by the resurgence of the disease , which until the mid-1980s was thought to be_on the brink of eradication . The resurgence , officials say , is linked to a variety of factors , including more widespread poverty , increased immigration from countries where the disease remains endemic , and the AIDS epidemic , which leaves patients susceptible to TB .</TEXT>
