   <HEADLINE> TRADING GROUP QUITS EXCHANGE IN HONG KONG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hong Kong ' s oldest colonial trading group , Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. , said Wednesday that it would quit the local stock_exchange in a dispute linked with the colony ' s 1997 return to China . The company said it will discontinue the secondary listing of its ordinary shares from the Hong Kong bourse on Dec . 31 . Its shares will continue to trade_in London , where they have had their primary listing since 1992 , and on other markets . Chairman Henry Keswick denied that the move indicated a loss of confidence in Hong Kong . &quot; I would emphasize that our decision is related to the regulatory position of the company and does not signal any lack of confidence in the future of Hong Kong itself . Indeed , we hope that one day it will again be possible for our shares to be listed in Hong Kong , &quot; Keswick said . &quot; The Jardine Matheson Group has traded_in and with Hong Kong and China for a century and a half . Now that a new era is beginning , we are as confident as ever in Hong Kong ' s future as a Special Administrative Region of the People ' s Republic_of_China , &quot; he said . Jardine , which was already trading on the south China coast before Hong Kong ' s foundation as a British colony in the early 1840s , has fought a long but unsuccessful battle to avoid being regulated in the territory after it returns to China in 1997 . The company , whose management is predominantly British , in 1984 shocked a Hong Kong already jittery about its political future by moving its legal home to Bermuda . The group now wants to be regulated by a new Bermuda takeover code rather than Hong Kong regulations , but has failed to reach agreement with the colony ' s authorities . But Jardine has also long suffered bad relations with China . In 1992 , Beijing blasted the company after London-based director Sir Charles Powell , once a close aide of former British Prime_Minister Margaret Thatcher , was quoted as supporting Gov . Chris Patten ' s drive for democratic reform . In its attack , the official New China Xinhua News_Agency raised Jardine Matheson ' s origins as an opium trader , a business that which provoked two wars between Britain and China leading to the foundation and expansion of Hong Kong . Jardine Group is now involved in a wide range of businesses from property and supermarkets automobile dealerships motor dealers and hotels .</TEXT>
