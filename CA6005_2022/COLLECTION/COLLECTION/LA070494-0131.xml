   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; PC FUN FLOURISHES AT_WORK ; THE GROWTH OF COMPUTER_NETWORKS SPAWNS A BOOM IN GAMES AT THE OFFICE . SOME BOSSES ZAP THEM , BUT OTHERS SEE THEM AS ASSETS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The weeknight scene at the offices of New Media Corp . is enough to mortify an unsuspecting security_guard or janitor . Sounds of gunfire and maniacal screams emanate from the engineering department . From somewhere among the cubicles , a gravelly voice says : &quot; I ' m coming_after you , and I got a big gun. &quot; But there ' s no lunatic loose in the corridors . It ' s just Rod Corder ' s team of engineers playing their favorite computer_network game , a gut-wrenching science_fiction combat free-for-all known as Doom . &quot; It ' s our way of dealing with stress , &quot; said Corder , co-founder of the computer components manufacturer and vice_president of engineering . &quot; We work_at 90 m.p.h. all day long . The games keep us working after hours. &quot; Companies like Corder ' s see the benefits of computer_games in the workplace . But many others say unchecked gaming can kill productivity , consume computing resources and even hurt a firm ' s image . Critics , who are viewed_as party poopers by the advocates of game playing , also say computer_games encourage addictive behavior and shoddy work habits . &quot; The corporate environment doesn ' t tolerate game playing for very long , &quot; said Richard Weinberg , a psychologist at the University of South Florida in Tampa who authored a report on computer_games . &quot; It doesn ' t pay to pay people to play. &quot; Many companies have begun to create policies to control game playing , especially since Doom surfaced last December as a cult hit at computer firms , which have been especially prone to employee game playing . The trend has grown because of changing technology . Unlike the older centralized mainframe_computers , where an administrator could monitor every task being performed throughout a network , inexpensive networks of PCs allow employees to load and use their own software . Such PCs can play the same games as home PCs but with even better results , because they are more powerful . And , played_on these powerful machines , the games are also more realistic , and therefore potentially more addictive . New technologies and cheaper computer horsepower mean that multimedia games often appeal_to adults as much as_to children . At some companies , there is no debate . Once games are discovered , they ' re dumped in the electronic equivalent of the garbage_can . Turn your back , some bosses believe , and everyone from executives to clerks will play computer_games . Some people say they get more satisfaction from games than their jobs . American workers typically spend half a_billion hours a year playing computer_games at a cost of $ 10 billion in lost productivity , according to SBT Corp. , a San Rafael , Calif. , accounting_firm that surveyed 6 # 000 employees . &quot; The PC is like TV , &quot; said David Harris , SBT vice_president . &quot; It ' s whatever you make of it . It can be used for education , but many people are using it to goof off. &quot; Simply banning computer_games , however , isn ' t going_to produce a dramatic gain in productivity , according to Sabine Helmers , an anthropologist at the Social_Science Centre in Berlin who is studying computers in the workplace . Removing games can be perceived as an &quot; act of distrust &quot; that strains relations between managers and subordinates , she said . &quot; Was there no waste_of_time before the introduction of computers at the workplace ? &quot; Helmers asks . &quot; The best way ( to deal with game playing ) seems to be to find_out how to motivate people enough that they will find it more interesting to do their job than to play a dull computer game. &quot; On top of that , Helmers said , employers should consider the psychological boost that comes from game playing , rather than just fret about lost productivity . In any case , game playing is often a fad that runs its course quickly . Using such arguments , many companies with laid-back management styles justify game playing . It is part of the milieu at places where fun policies , such_as casual wear_on Fridays , are welcome . Sometimes , games can even be good for business . Greg Arbuckle , 50 , loves playing a tank battle game called Spectre VR during work hours . Players control tanks and shoot each other on a futuristic battlefield . Arbuckle can get_away with it because he ' s the owner of Arbuckle ' s Tattoo and Piercing Emporium in Cedar Rapids , Iowa . In fact , Arbuckle said he has found that game playing helps draw a crowd to his store . &quot; I let our employees and our customers play the game with their own discretion , &quot; he said . &quot; Sometimes we stay after work playing it for three or four hours . We have to stop and help customers when they come . But this passes time when it ' s slow. &quot; Banned or not , gaming is considered a sanity saver by some beleaguered white-collar employees in Orange County ' s high-tech entrepreneurial belt . &quot; Playing games ( after hours ) is a kind of benefit here , &quot; says Richard Nadolny , a technical writer at NetSoft Inc. in Aliso Viejo in south Orange County . &quot; People work here because they like an environment where you can wear tie-dye shirts . We don ' t have to come here , punch a clock and have our calls monitored . We do get our work done. &quot; But Doom sapped NetSoft ' s computer_network of so_much power that President Isaac ( Zak ) Kong had to confine game playing to after business hours . The latest gaming rage at TouchStone Software Corp . in Huntington Beach isn ' t as violent as at New Media Corp . Nonetheless , it produces screaming ; programmers have taken_to nightly bouts with the network version of the card_game Hearts . Sigmund Fidyke , TouchStone ' s vice_president of development , says he joins the electronic card_games because it builds team_spirit . As a salaried employee , Tam Pham , TouchStone ' s head programmer , doesn ' t get overtime pay when he and colleagues work late to meet a deadline . Thus , games are considered a fringe_benefit when he has to stay beyond the typical 9-to-5 schedule . Like many others , Pham picked_up his computer_game addiction in college ; he used to skip classes to play so-called dungeon games with other students around the world via the global communications network known as the Internet . ( Australia and some universities have banned multi-player dungeon games because they consumed too_much of computing resources. ) Pham says he has tamed his obsessive side , but he still likes to play games because it soothes him so he can return to a frustrating problem with a fresh viewpoint . Fidyke , Pham ' s boss , buys that argument , but other managers view such explanations as mere excuses for goofing off . &quot; I won ' t tolerate it because it sends the wrong message about what we ' re all about , &quot; said Ken Forbes , president of Adaptive Software Inc. in Irvine . &quot; If I allowed it , they would think I was playing games behind closed doors too. &quot; A former Marine , Forbes said he likes to set a good_example for his staff . Managers have a good legal case against game-playing employees , said Howard Derman , an Irvine human resources consultant . Derman said companies can argue that game playing is improper use of company equipment , an abuse of company time , harmful to the corporate image and even that it promotes potentially addictive behavior . Ron Seide , marketing manager for Kingston Technology Corp . in Fountain Valley , said games were not an issue at the computer board manufacturer until pirated games played during office hours introduced destructive computer viruses . Within weeks , all games were banned . &quot; Of course , not everyone goes_along , &quot; he said . &quot; But we do deal with the most egregious violations . In our case , the viruses brought the issue to the forefront and spoiled it for everyone. &quot; Shaun , a clerk at a firm in New Zealand , said he played dungeon games on the Internet for 14 hours a day -- starting at_home in the morning and continuing at_work -- until his supervisor took_away his computer account . Now he plays_at home on a personal account that cuts_off his access after 90 minutes of play . Industrial psychologist Nancy Haller , president of Applied Psychometrics , a management consulting_firm in San Diego , said one client played games at the office so often that it interfered with her work . Such behavior is clearly addictive , she said . &quot; It gives her a sense of mastery when nothing else seemed like it was under_control , &quot; Haller said . &quot; It ' s an escape and a way to avoid issues. &quot; Yet Haller stresses that not all game players are addicts . If the game playing doesn ' t affect work performance , it can be positive . Today ' s managers also must deal with such other modern obsessions as employees who dial into computer bulletin_boards to chat with people around the world , gaze at X-rated pictures on the Internet , and play adventure games over phone_lines . Such activities , while seemingly benign , can expose the company to sexual_harassment lawsuits or other liabilities . Overall , computer-related distractions can cost companies as much as $ 100 billion in productivity a year , according to the SBT survey . &quot; It fits_in the category of developing policies to deal with how to use electronic_mail or voice mail , &quot; said Allan Halcrow , editor in chief of Personnel Journal in Costa Mesa . &quot; I know that people have been fired for playing games on company time. &quot; The growth of games at_work also reflects greater stress at the office . Under pressure , addiction-prone people resort_to games as an easy way to let_off steam at their desks , said Joseph Cassius , a Memphis , Tenn. , psychologist who has studied computer addictions and is co-author of the study &quot; How Games Play People. &quot; &quot; For workers , it ' s a way of escaping_from society , &quot; he said . &quot; During working hours , employers have expectations and some people will rebel . It ' s hard to control everything that goes_on in the workplace. &quot; Because of the spread of PC networks into offices , game playing is no longer just the domain of programmers . Traveling salespeople can while_away the hours on planes and in airports with the games stored on their laptop_computers . They can play with no fear of being monitored . Secretaries taking a break from word_processing can pull_up a game of Solitaire or Minesweeper , in which a player tries to uncover hidden land_mines without being blown_up . The games are standard programs in Microsoft Corp. ' s Windows and Windows for WorkGroups office software_packages . Microsoft maintains that it isn ' t undermining its own productivity software . The free games it includes teach workers how to use a computer mouse and take the fear out of computing , said Tony Garcia , product manager of Microsoft ' s entertainment unit . Companies ' computer_network administrators often serve as enforcers . Using special programs , they can detect which employees store games on their PCs . They can erase the games , but workers then sometimes find another way to hide them . This cat-and-mouse game goes_on for a while until the employee gets the message : Quit playing or be fired . People at offices have learned to be sly . They can use programs that have a &quot; boss key , &quot; or a button that instantly switches the computer_screen from a game to a work program when the boss comes_near . &quot; It ' s something that management usually doesn ' t know about , &quot; said Tom Craft , president of T &amp; T Research Inc. , a computer engineering firm in Irvine . &quot; Some of our people who left were pretty tricky . We didn ' t know they had the games on their disk_drives until they left. &quot; Even game companies -- where playing games can be considered research -- have rules . At Interplay Productions Inc. in Irvine , playing games by modem , which results in hefty phone_bills , isn ' t permitted . &quot; We let the employees play games as much as the boss plays games , &quot; joked Alan Pavlish , executive producer at the multimedia game company , who says fewer than 10 hours a week is about right . Pavlish uses the honor_system . His employees are expected to play games only if it helps them professionally . If they play for fun , they are expected to do_it on_their_own time . The computer_game companies say they are not conspiring to destroy American productivity . But some , like id Software , the Texas-based maker of Doom , have benefited from targeting games at the workplace . Microsoft ' s Garcia says the next version of Windows will also have a game in it . He believes network games are a good testing ground for the interactive games that will be distributed on the information superhighway . Network games -- as opposed to games confined to a single PC -- will expand the beachhead in their invasion of the workplace . Jay Wilbur , general_manager at id Software , says the sequel to Doom will be out_in October . And the lessons of the original are not lost on the company . &quot; From now on , &quot; he says , &quot; all_of our games will run_on networks. &quot;</TEXT>
