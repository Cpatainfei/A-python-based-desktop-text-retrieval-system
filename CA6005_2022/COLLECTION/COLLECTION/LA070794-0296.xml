   <HEADLINE> TIMING IS EVERYTHING FOR PARKS ; HE KNOWS A BIG SEASON COULD PUT HIM IN LOTTERY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Duke basketball_player Cherokee Parks listened closely as , one by one , the names were read off at the NBA draft last week . Cal ' s Jason Kidd to the Dallas Mavericks , with the second pick . Duke ' s Grant Hill went third , to the Detroit Pistons . North Carolina ' s Eric Montross to the Boston Celtics , with the ninth pick . Can Parks be far behind ? A former Marina High standout , Parks prepares_for his senior season at Duke knowing he could be an NBA lottery pick next year . Or will he ? Fact : Parks is one of 16 college basketball_players who began workouts Tuesday at UC Irvine in preparation for the Goodwill Games July 23-28 in St . Petersburg , Russia . Fact : Of the 26 players on past U.S. Goodwill Games rosters , 25 have gone_on to play in the NBA . The only one who hasn ' t is former Duke guard Tommy Amaker , who was selected in the third round by Seattle but went_on to become an assistant coach at his alma_mater . Those facts may weigh in Parks ' favor , but for all his talent and skills , the 6-foot-11 center could be far from a lock as a lottery pick . A prep All-American , he struggled as a freshman at Duke and was the target of constant criticism from teammate Christian Laettner . He improved over the next two seasons , playing_on the gold-medal winning under-22 world championship team last year . As a junior last season , he averaged only 14.4 points and 8.4 rebounds as the Blue_Devils reached the NCAA championship game . Some scouts have wondered if Parks will be quick or strong enough to make an impact in the NBA , and his size and skills have forced him to decide between playing center and power forward . But Parks has played in two of the last three NCAA title games and has held his own in a tough Atlantic Coast Conference . Time will tell if he ' s ready for the NBA . In a recent interview with Times Staff Writer Mike Reilley , Parks reflects on his past , discusses the present and ponders his future at Duke . . . and beyond : THE FUTURE Q . Do you consider yourself an NBA lottery pick right now ? A . It ' s a matter of me going_out and asserting myself this year . Skill-wise I think I can be a high pick , maybe a late lottery pick . I ' m not saying that with any cockiness . I ' m just saying I would n ' t be a disappointment . Q . Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski plans to play you more at power forward in your senior season . Is that the position you see yourself playing in the NBA ? A . I ' m stuck between a four ( power forward ) and a five ( center ) . I would have to put_on weight to play center and I ' m not comfortable yet playing power forward . It depends_on what team would want to put_in some time with me . I would definitely be a contributor there . Q . Your draft status is going_to depend a great_deal on your senior year . What do you need to improve on to play_at the NBA level ? A . I would like to get my rebounds and blocked shots up there . I ' m trying to put a little weight back on . I played last season at 247 pounds , but I ' m down to 230 right now and I feel a lot better at this weight . Q . Does your weight have much of an impact on your game ? A . In my case , yes . I ' ve tried and tried to add weight , but I don ' t have the frame for a big body . The 15 pounds I lost were just straight off the gut , all fat . I took three weeks off ( before Goodwill Games practices ) and figured I would fall_flat when I came_back . But I feel great . Every year before the season started , I would just grub on every meal to put_on weight . I would just throw stuff down my throat . All that weight bogged me down . The main thing now is to get_in the weight room and get stronger and not worry about the weight . I ' ll still be able to bang inside , but I ' m not going_to be throwing bodies around in there . that ' s just not going_to happen with me . Q . A year from now the NBA draft will have just ended . How do you think you would look in a Toronto Raptors uniform ? A . From the way Toronto fans treated the Blue_Jays after they won , I would like to play there . They love their athletes there . And it would be great to play for a team in its inaugural year . You couldn ' t beat it . Q . Where would you like to play ? The Clippers and Lakers will probably be lottery teams next year . A . Yeah , it would be ideal to play in California -- the Clippers , Lakers , Golden State , Sacramento . Toronto would be nice too . And so would New York . I have a lot of friends there . Q . Past Duke teams have looked_to Christian Laettner , Bobby Hurley and Grant Hill for leadership . This year , you ' re the guy . How will you handle this new role ? A . I think I can do so_much more next year than I have done_in the last couple years . The main thing , and I talk to Coach K about this a lot , is that I ' m always afraid that I ' ll do too_much . I ' m always wondering if it ' s a good shot to take at that time , instead of just going_out there and playing . Coach K has never had a player he has had to get_on about shooting the ball as much as he has me . He gives me the green_light and tells me , ' Whenever you get the ball , shoot it. ' It ' s not like I ' m lacking confidence in my skills , it ' s just timing , knowing when to do what . I ' ve never been thrust into a position where I ' ve been a force . Next season , I ' m in that position . I have to step_up . Q . How do you want to be remembered at Duke ? A . I just want to keep_up what we ' ve done_in the past . We would like to be ACC champs again . And we want another shot at the Final Four . I ' ve played_on two Final Four teams and one NCAA championship team . I want to play_on another one . And I have some personal goals . There are certain awards I still want to win in college . Q . Such_as the John Wooden Award ( as college basketball ' s top player ) ? A . You said it . Not me . THE PRESENT Q . Many draft analysts said the Dallas Mavericks made a mistake taking Jason Kidd instead of your college teammate , Grant Hill . If you were Dallas ' general_manager , what would you have done ? A . I don ' t know , but I think Dallas ' Jimmy Jackson and Jamal Mashburn do some of the same things Grant does , so I think that ' s why ( the Mavericks ) went_with Jason Kidd . I definitely think Grant was the best player in this year ' s draft . By far . He has_the_best all-around game . I play against him every day , and he ' s so hard to stop . He has so many things in his game . . . it ' s so_much more suited for the NBA than college . One-on-one , you can ' t stop him . Q . Best in the draft ? A . You can ' t base Grant ' s year on his stats . He did so_much more this year than he has been accustomed to doing . He grew a lot , and that helped him prepare_for the NBA . Going_to Detroit couldn ' t be a better situation for Grant . It ' s a team that needs some help , and he ' s excited about going there . Q . Another Duke teammate , Antonio Lang , is headed to the Phoenix Suns . How do you think he will fit_in with Charles Barkley ? A . Tony will do_well there . He ' s the same as Grant , he knows his role . He ' ll go_to the coach and say , ' What do you want ? ' and he ' ll do whatever the team needs him to . He has come a long way with his jump_shot and he has developed his game . Q . You played against North Carolina center Eric Montross for three years . The Boston Celtics raised some eyebrows when they took him with the ninth pick . A good pick or a bad one ? A . I don ' t know the Celtics ' exact situation with Robert Parish . From playing against Eric , I know he ' s tough and can bang inside , but he ' s not going_to be the guy who ' s explosive in any category . He won ' t be your top scorer , rebounder or shot blocker . If Parish is leaving , they ' ll need a guy who can give them 15 to 18 points and seven to 10 boards a game . So I don ' t know how Eric is going_to fit_in there . Q . Speaking of players you know , there ' s an interesting story in Sacramento with Bobby Hurley ' s comeback from severe injuries he suffered in a car accident . Where were you when you heard Bobby was hurt ? A . I was pulling an all-nighter , studying for a test . We caught_it on CNN at about 2 or 3 in the morning . First thing I did was call Coach K and he told us they had taken Bobby to the hospital . It was a shock to all_of us . Here ' s a guy we had played with for a couple years , and now he ' s suffered a career- or life-threatening injury . But there ' s no doubt in my mind he would try to come_back and play ball . He was always one of those players who can run all day . Last time I talked to him , he said his body felt good , but it was hard to do a lot of conditioning because of the collapsed lungs from the accident . Once those heal up , there ' s no reason why he won ' t be back in the lineup . Q . You ' ll be heading to St . Petersburg , Russia , soon for the Games . How ' s your Russian , and how will you handle the international style of play ? A . My Russian ' s not good at all . Actually , I took a Russian history class and a socialism and communism class . I kind of know what ' s going_on over there . This should be an interesting trip . And practicing with the top players in the country each day will improve my game . It ' s a different style of play overseas ( international rules ) . that ' s the hardest thing -- adjusting to the wider lane , the ball can get tapped_out of the cylinder and the players usually get_away with an extra step or two . THE PAST Q . Arkansas ' Scotty Thurman is_on the Goodwill Games team with you . He hit the big_shot that beat Duke in the NCAA championship game last March ; any painful memories ? A . When Scotty hit that shot ( with the shot clock winding down ) , it was a great defensive exchange for us . We couldn ' t have played better defense , the pass to him was bobbled . It was a perfect shot with no time on the clock and Tony Lang about two inches away from blocking it . You can ' t get_down on a shot like that . Q . Duke was scheduled to tour Australia in late spring , but Coach K canceled the trip because some of the players ' grades weren ' t up_to par . Do you agree with that decision ? A . We all wanted to go , but I saw it more as a vacation . I was going_to summer school anyway , so I might be the wrong person to ask . It worked_out better for me that we didn ' t go . It would have been a great experience . But I feel bad for the coaches , because they were the ones who set the trip_up , then they were the ones who had to explain why we weren ' t going . Coach K gives us a lot of academic_freedom . We have to schedule our own classes and we don ' t have study halls . As players , we let the coaching staff down . Q . Were you having any trouble with school ? A . No , I ' m fine . After the fall semester , I ' ll only have one more class to take ( for a history degree ) . I ' ll be cruising second semester . that ' s why I took summer school . Q . What did you think_of reports in late spring that Coach K was considering leaving Duke for the NBA ? A . I hadn ' t heard about it but my mom called me and asked , ' What ' s up with Coach K ? ' So I went_to his house and talked to him about it . I just wanted to know what was going_on , in case any of the other players had any questions . He was really bogged down with it . He can ' t go anywhere in Durham without being mobbed anyway , but if he were to go_out during that time_period , he would have been swamped . When I got there , he was sitting at a desk with a FAX machine and a pile of notes . Phone_calls were coming_in like crazy . He looked_like a wreck . I went_in there with an open mind . I knew he loved it in Durham , but I also understood that he had to look_out for his best interests . Of course , I wanted him to stay because I want the other players here to have the chance to go_through what I did here . Q . What did Coach K say to you ? A . He told me his heart ' s in Durham and he wants to be at Duke more_than anywhere else . I was glad he stayed .</TEXT>
