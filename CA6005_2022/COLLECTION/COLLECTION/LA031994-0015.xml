   <HEADLINE> NEW IRA ' SPECTACULARS ' SEEN STALLING PEACE ; EUROPE : THE HEATHROW ATTACKS ARE VIEWED AS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first four mortar rounds whistled onto runways at Heathrow Airport , one of the world ' s busiest , 10 days ago , leaving their launching_pad -- a stolen car -- blazing in a hotel parking_lot . Two days later , four more rounds landed on Heathrow , fired from a wooded area near the airport . Then , on Sunday morning , four more , this time fired from a scrub area , landed on the airport , one of them on the top of a terminal building . None of the rounds detonated , though each was stuffed with explosives . But these &quot; spectaculars , &quot; as the_Irish Republican Army is calling them , along with almost a dozen disruptions of trains and airport service during the week have left little doubt about the IRA ' s stand on the latest peace initiatives . Experts on Northern_Ireland predict that the attacks on Heathrow , where about 130 # 000 travelers arrive and depart on 1 # 000 flights a day , are just the beginning of a renewed mainland campaign by the IRA , which is seeking to force the_British government to make more concessions . And the hopes for peace , raised just a_few months ago , are in tatters . &quot; There is a double stalemate at present , &quot; said Brendan O ' Leary , a political_scientist and expert on Northern_Ireland at the London School of Economics . &quot; It is very clear the IRA and Sinn Fein are not going_to accept the Downing Street Declaration . And the Anglo-Irish peace initiative has been virtually suspended. &quot; The Downing Street Declaration offered Sinn Fein , the outlawed IRA ' s legal political wing , a role in talks on the province within three months of the guerrillas ' renouncing violence . The IRA is fighting to end British rule_in Northern_Ireland and have the province absorbed into the_Irish Republic . In that declaration , Britain said it had no long-term interest in Northern_Ireland , a key demand of the IRA . But Britain , balancing its long allegiance to the province ' s Protestant majority , also vowed to respect the electoral wishes of the people of Northern_Ireland . Now Gerry Adams , leader of Sinn Fein , suggests that the_British have not gone_far enough . Although Adams insisted Thursday in a St . Patrick ' s Day message that peace is still possible , he and his colleagues believe that past attacks on the_British mainland , such_as the 1991 mortar attack on the prime_minister ' s offices on Downing Street , were key factors_in forcing the government to raise the possibility of negotiating with Sinn Fein . And they are unwilling to give_up their armed campaign , figuring that more pressure on Prime_Minister John Major ' s government will mean more concessions . &quot; The causes of the conflict are ongoing , &quot; Adams told a radio_station after the first set of mortar shells were fired at Heathrow . &quot; And every so often there will be something spectacular to remind the world. &quot; The British government refuses to be seen to be knuckling_under the terrorist threats . In an anecdote widely reported in Britain , and indicative_of that resolve , Queen Elizabeth ordered her pilot to &quot; carry_on &quot; and land at Heathrow last week after she was told that there had been coded , telephoned threats of a mortar attack on the airport . Three hours later , an IRA mortar round crashed yards from where her flight had touched_down . With both sides taking entrenched positions , analysts expect the coming weeks and months to bring more IRA &quot; spectaculars &quot; and even greater deterioration in the peace hopes . &quot; As long as this stalemate persists , the IRA is likely to step_up its campaign here , &quot; said O ' Leary , the political_scientist . &quot; And the most likely scenario is that the current antagonism will persist , with no end in sight. &quot; A big question in Britain is whether the IRA ever intended for the mortars to explode . Scotland_Yard said the bombs all had an identical mechanical malfunction . It insisted that they were designed to &quot; maim and destroy , &quot; and , in fact , the IRA has occasionally in the past used armaments that , because of_age , had failed to detonate . One London newspaper , quoting unnamed sources , said the IRA was double-crossed by one of its operatives , who had disarmed the bombs without permission before they were fired . But others suggest that the IRA knows that it would be politically disastrous to bomb a jetliner , killing untold numbers , many of them likely to be foreigners . &quot; It ' s more important for the IRA to show they can do this , &quot; one expert said . &quot; It enhances their threats , raises the security costs and the feeling of general uncertainty . From their point_of_view , that ' s the kind of trouble they want to cause for the_British government. &quot;</TEXT>
