   <HEADLINE> U.S. , CANADA STILL FISHING FOR AGREEMENT ON SALMON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Increasingly at_odds over everything from wheat to wood , U.S. and Canadian trade officials tried but failed Thursday to defuse their fish war . Negotiators sat_down at the table for three hours and emerged with little to say except that new talks will follow . &quot; It was a useful and productive dialogue , &quot; a Commerce_Department spokesman said . &quot; Another meeting is scheduled. &quot; The dispute over salmon erupted in May when the two sides failed to agree on this year ' s Pacific harvest and abruptly called_off negotiations . A Canadian official played_down Thursday ' s slim results , saying the two sides will meet again next week in Toronto . &quot; I don ' t think brilliant breakthroughs were expected today . This was just a start , &quot; the embassy aide said . In other words , the two sides remain at loggerheads . Canada says U.S. vessels are catching too_much of its prized sockeye_salmon , hauling in the Canadian fish as the salmon try to return to spawning grounds in the rivers of British_Columbia . Thursday ' s resumption in talks followed the personal intervention of Vice_President Al Gore , rarely a player in international trade matters . Last Saturday , however , Gore told Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin that Washington would return to the table if Canada lifted a contentious $ 1 # 125 license fee it slapped_on U.S. fishing_boats last month . Washington had complained that the fee -- imposed on U.S. boats between the Pacific Northwest and Alaska -- was inconsistent with international_law and forced cash-strapped fishermen to take dangerously to the open seas . Canada , in turn , said the get-tough approach was the only way to bring the Americans back to the negotiating table . Indeed , the tactic appeared to work , even if the dispute was not resolved . The talks pitted U.S. Commerce Deputy Undersecretary Douglas Hall against Canada ' s Deputy Fisheries and Oceans Minister Bill Rowat and Assistant Deputy Minister Pat Schamut . Talks on the 1994 sockeye harvest quotas stalled in May , and time is running_short before the season opens in_earnest . Canada says all it wants is equity ; it complains that U.S. overfishing nets Americans $ 49 million more in Canada-bound salmon than Canadian vessels catch in U.S.-bound sockeye . The latest U.S. quota proposal -- offered under a 1985 harvest treaty -- would only serve to boost the imbalance to $ 75 million and endanger already-depleted Canadian stocks , officials there say . Along with fish , the two sides are embroiled in a host of other trade spats . And while each one amounts to but a blip in the big picture -- a $ 210-billion two-way trade flow -- any one could spawn a wider retaliatory trade war .</TEXT>
