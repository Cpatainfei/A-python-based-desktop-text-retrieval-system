   <HEADLINE> JITTERS BUT NO BIG CORRECTIONS ON WALL_STREET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rising interest_rates sent stock prices lower Thursday , but jittery markets continued to avoid the type of dramatic correction that many investors feared . Unlike Wednesday , when stocks staged a dramatic comeback , the market struggled unsuccessfully to fully recover from a bout of selling in the morning . Most measures of stock performance ended the session with modest losses . The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 7.32 at 3 # 824.42 , after improving from a loss of more_than 20 points during the morning ' s selloff . Broadly based measures dominated by New York Stock_Exchange issues also lost ground . The NYSE composite fell 0.79 to 256.68 and the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index dropped 1.80 to 463.01. Still , the market mostly shrugged_off the turmoil in some overseas stock and bond markets , which has caused large losses for a number of major banks and speculative investment funds . Bank stocks continued to fall on fears that they had sustained substantial losses on risky currency and bond trades and stock plays in emerging markets . Gauges of smaller stocks fared better . The Nasdaq composite gained 1.11 to 784.58 , helped by strength in a range of computer and technology shares . At the American_Stock_Exchange , the market_value index dipped 0.67 to 465.65. Losers outnumbered gainers on the NYSE by about 5 to 4 , and volume on the Big Board eased to 291.79 million shares . On Wednesday , a much heavier total of 361.12 million shares changed hands . Stocks took their cue from the bond market , where prices declined , causing a corresponding increase in interest_rates . Prices of all maturities of government_notes and bonds moved down , with the 30-year Treasury_bond off about 3 / 4 point , driving_up its yield to 6.84 % from 6.77 % on Wednesday . Bonds were sold for technical reasons -- and in response to fresh evidence of economic strength . The Labor_Department reported that the number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 57 # 000 last week to the lowest level since Christmas , marking the steepest decline since August , 1992 . Financial markets have been fearful that the rebounding economy will breed inflation , prompting the Federal_Reserve_Board to implement additional interest_rate hikes to head_off price pressures . A gentle nudge upward in rates by the Fed in early February has put the markets on_guard for additional tightening in monetary policy . Worries about a possible trade war with Japan also curbed interest in buying stocks . The Clinton_Administration reinstated a trade law provision known as Super 301 , giving the government a mechanism to retaliate against Japan if that country doesn ' t try to reduce its $ 59.3-billion annual trade surplus with the United States . Following the White_House announcement , the dollar fell against the yen , slipping to 103.77 yen in late New York trading , from Wednesday ' s 104.20. But the U.S. currency gained_ground against many other foreign currencies . Investors were also worried about possible fallout from market turmoil in Europe , where bond prices have fallen dramatically in response to fears of higher interest_rates in Germany . Stock prices on many small , emerging markets overseas -- many of which have risen dramatically over the past year -- have also been falling . Those events have caused big losses for some major investment funds , known as hedge_funds . One fund controlled by legendary speculator George Soros confirmed last week that it has lost about $ 600 million in global markets . Large losses also reportedly have been sustained by speculator Michael Steinhardt . Perhaps more worrisome is the fact that some major banks that have large trading operations -- notably Bankers Trust and J.P. Morgan -- also reportedly have taken big hits . Bankers Trust shares continued to fall Thursday , losing 2 to 76 1 / 2 after dropping 2 1 / 4 on Wednesday . Most other banking issues were also lower . &quot; A lot of the hedge_funds were making big bets that rates would come_down in Europe , and they blew it , &quot; said Philip Dubuque , a fund manager at Chestnut Hill Management in Boston . &quot; And when the banks get nervous , they get nervous very quickly , &quot; in turn dumping declining bonds at_a_loss , he said . But market watchers said the problems at banks did not appear to be severe or widespread , and that troubles in the European bond market would have only a limited impact on the United States . Jeremy Siegel , a professor of finance at the Wharton School of Business , said the losses on bond_trading were mainly a &quot; retracing &quot; of earlier gains . Only a dramatic , sustained rise in interest_rates , he said , would be a real threat to the big trading operations . Many technology stocks managed to buck the downward trend . On the Nasdaq , Dell Computer topped the actives list , spurting 2 1 / 8 to 27 . Dell posted fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall_Street expectations .</TEXT>
