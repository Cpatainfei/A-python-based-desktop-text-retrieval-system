   <HEADLINE> ACTING HER AGE ; AT 90 , IRMSIE BROWN HAS BEGUN RACKING_UP ROLES IN HOLLYWOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Irmsie Brown may be a neophyte actress , but she ' s still got a_few rules about Hollywood conduct she simply refuses to break . For one , she absolutely will not pose in the nude . She won ' t jump into bed with any smooth-talking Lothario on the set , no matter what size the paycheck . And as for those lingering , full-body-contact kisses ? Forget about it . that ' s because the 90-year-old Van Nuys widow has this image of the silver_screen back in its more-innocent infancy when she was a wide-eyed kid sitting in a darkened theater with a box of popcorn -- days when such matters as sex and nudity were , well , just left to the imagination . &quot; Things just don ' t have to go that far , people dropping their clothes at the drop of a hat , &quot; she said . &quot; They didn ' t do_it back then and they don ' t have to today . People in this town just have to learn to keep their pants on , that ' s what I think. &quot; Brown knows she has a_few things to learn about The Biz . And fast . Last year , at the unheard-of age of 89 , the former Wisconsin housewife and bookkeeper for her son-in-law ' s Toluca Lake talent agency plunged head-first into a new role that has casting directors ' heads turning : She hit the big screen , becoming one of the oldest working character actresses in Hollywood . A sprightly , gray-haired woman with slate-blue eyes and an unassuming style , Brown recently landed a bit_part in &quot; City_Slickers II &quot; with Billy Crystal , playing an elderly Central_Park jogger who is nonplussed as Crystal ' s character takes his pet cow on its daily run . She has portrayed an elderly party crasher -- an interloper who hits the buffet table on the sly , stuffing Brie into her purse -- on the CBS television series &quot; Hearts Afire. &quot; And she has become the resident old_lady on the &quot; Tonight Show. &quot; In one of two recent skits , Brown played a bespectacled , grandmother in a shawl who traded_in her handgun for a pair of &quot; Tonight Show &quot; tickets . In the second , she was an elderly Woodstock veteran , an aged ex-hippie named Sunshine who , dressed in a bandanna , beads and a tie-dyed ensemble , fashioned a bong out of an old Metamucil bottle . On the set , Brown has already developed a reputation as an able actress fit enough to repeatedly run_up and down a hill in a jogging suit until the scene is right , casting directors say . And , even at age 90 , she has another ability that eludes actresses half her age : She remembers her lines . &quot; What casting directors like about Irmsie is that she really is old -- she ' s in the same ballpark as George Burns -- so she doesn ' t have to act the part , &quot; said Candace Potter , an agent at the Tyler Kjar Agency , the family-run business for which Brown still keeps the books . &quot; And while Irmsie may be old , she ' s in great shape . She can still talk . She has the faculties to remember her lines . that ' s why the phone keeps ringing . She ' s caught_on to all_of this tricky Hollywood work rather quickly . I mean , how many people do you know who have begun new careers at age 89 ? &quot; Fran Bascom , casting director for &quot; Hearts Afire , &quot; said Brown has a style of_her_own , recalling a recent shoot where she rejected a wardrobe room full of shoes , and wore her own . &quot; Irmsie had these orange high heels , &quot; she recalled . &quot; Most experienced actresses would never have worn those shoes on the set , but she wanted them . At her age , you at least would have thought she would have worn flat heels. &quot; Bascom said Brown ' s age is an asset -- even in an industry where youth is prized . &quot; Irmsie ' s secret is that she really does not look her age . She is perky and spry and could play the role of a woman much younger . &quot; But when the call comes for someone really , really old , she ' s the real_thing . I would n ' t be surprised if she was the oldest working character actress in Hollywood. &quot; Added Tori Pellegrino , production administrator for the &quot; Tonight Show &quot; : &quot; Irmsie may be 90 , but she ' s still a trooper . She ' s fun . She ' s everybody ' s grandmother . It ' s amazing for me to see someone so together . And to be what she ' s doing at her age -- even down to_the_point of driving a car . It ' s an inspiration in this town where youth is so valued . To me , it proves something : that you can do anything you want if you try. &quot; Brown takes such compliments in stride . &quot; At age 90 , you take things one day at a time , &quot; she said . &quot; My mind is clear . But once in awhile , you know , you forget little things. &quot; Born in Milwaukee in 1904 , Brown married Sheldon Mehlos , who preferred she become a mother and housekeeper rather than pursue a career . But Brown , who worked temporary office jobs , kept her own conservative values -- especially regarding women ' s role in the workplace . &quot; If women go_to work , I think they should respect their bosses , &quot; she said . &quot; They have to remember , the workplace is not the same as leaning over the fence with all that gossip . You can ' t take_back what you say . So it ' s good to watch what comes_out of your mouth. &quot; Back in the 1920s , such conventional ideas cut_short a would-be entertainment career before it got started : Brown was hired as a dancer in a Milwaukee vaudeville act . Her husband accompanied her to her first practice . But walking up the steps to the hall , Brown suddenly turned_to her husband : &quot; Oh Shelly , we ' ve only been married two weeks ! I can ' t do this . I can ' t leave you now for all those practices and performances . I have to try marriage before I can do something like this. &quot; The couple moved to Los Angeles in 1970 and Brown took a bookkeeping job in her son-in-law ' s firm . Especially after Sheldon ' s death in 1985 , after 60 years of marriage , Brown became a known commodity to about 400 actors and other professionals represented by the agency -- developing a reputation for the small inspirational lines she would write to clients on the note space of their checks . &quot; I just thought that was really cool the way she encouraged people , especially in a town where encouragement comes_in small doses , &quot; actor S.A. Griffin said . &quot; She writes things like ' We love you , Stevie . Keep it up ' and ' His love keeps us alive. ' It was just so unique. &quot; Griffin recently gave Brown a small obelisk to honor her acting efforts , calling it the Irmsie Award . She keeps it at the office , close to her side , right next to the urn where she keeps Sheldon ' s remains . Last weekend , friends , family and clients threw a 90th birthday_party for Brown , who only recently joined the ranks of nonagenarians -- celebrating her bookkeeping and acting careers as well as a spirit that continues to win friends . &quot; Irmsie is just so special , &quot; Griffin said . &quot; You couldn ' t meet a more amicable , loving person . People want to be close to her . She ' s genuine . I love the woman. &quot; Throughout her 80s , Brown lived the life of most octogenarians : She tried to keep active , sadly watching many of her friends pass_away . Then her life took a plot twist . Her grandson , Brandon Kjar , an agent at the talent agency , entered her picture in the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences Players Directory , the classified pages for actors looking_for work . Then the casting calls started . But Brown stuck_to her conventional guns concerning what roles she would take . She shied_away_from playing in a pizza commercial when the role called_for her to lie on an old couch with a man in a seedy motel . Recalled son-in-law Tyler Kjar : &quot; She informed me there were some things she would not do . She said ' If they try and put me in bed with a man , I will get_out right away. ' &quot; Then came the &quot; City_Slicker ' s II &quot; role . &quot; We told her she had one line in the film , &quot; recalled Kjar . &quot; She thought for a moment and said ' How long is it ? ' &quot; Ironically , Brown got the job for nearly dropping her pants during the casting call . &quot; They made me run_up and down a hill in my sweat pants , &quot; she recalled . &quot; Well , I hadn ' t hitched them up properly and suddenly I looked down and thought ' Oh my Lord , my britches are falling_off ! ' &quot; The studio loved the moment . And for Irmsie Brown , the rest is Hollywood history .</TEXT>
