   <HEADLINE> BEAUTY ON A BUDGET / JAPAN ; TWO OF THE PACIFIC ' S MOST BEGUILING DESTINATIONS ARE PLACES YOU can ' t AFFORD . OR CAN YOU ? HERE ' S HOW TWO VACATIONERS DID IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At first sight , the multileveled Tokyo Station seemed a well-lit nightmare , with sarariman ( Japanese &quot; salary men &quot; ) , in navy and dark gray suits , flowing around us like schooling fish . My wife and I had arrived here last fall on a sleek , speedy train from Narita Airport -- using discount Japan Railways passes , which cost us $ 440 each for two weeks of unlimited travel on trains and buses , instead of hailing an airport cab for about $ 200 . From the central station , we planned to take the subway ( about $ 1.50 each ) for the 20-minute ride to our ryokan , or inn , near Tokyo ' s Ueno Park . Our dream was to spend two weeks touring a fascinating country that many American travelers have written_off as prohibitively expensive . We ' d settled_on three cities : Tokyo for its modernity , Kyoto for its ancient charm and Hiroshima for its poignant history . By using public transportation , emphasizing smaller , more modest lodgings and searching out back-street , mom-and-pop restaurants , we hoped to sample one of the world ' s most complex cultures within realistic limits -- even though we faced an anemic exchange_rate of 105 yen to the dollar ( slightly better than the current rate ) . But only a_few hours into our journey , we were wondering whether the budget approach was such a good idea . Would we wind_up frustrated trying to cope_with subways and buses ? Could we communicate with no knowledge of Japanese ? And just what would the inexpensive lodgings we ' d planned to stay in be like ? We must have looked confused , wandering about in search of the subway , because an angel appeared in the form of a young Japanese woman who asked_in English whether she might be of assistance . She pointed_the_way -- indeed , took us to the ticket_booth -- before departing with a smile and a bow . Clutching our suitcases , we edged into the crowded car and stood there anxiously . A bit of our confidence came_back when we noticed the stops were marked in Roman letters as well as Japanese characters and heard them announced in_advance over a loudspeaker in both English and Japanese . After swimming through more sarariman in Ueno Station , we managed to find our way outside and hail a taxi . Ten minutes later , and only $ 10 out of pocket , we were at our inn , the Sawanoya . We ' d booked our accommodations before leaving the United States , through the Welcome Inn Reservation Center , a privately subsidized agency that matches overseas visitors with low-cost lodgings . &quot; Genuine hospitality at affordable rates &quot; is its motto . We had not expected luxury for $ 80 per room , per night . Indeed , the Sawanoya is housed in a poured-concrete building more reminiscent_of a school or factory than an inn . The jolly owner , with a pet cockatiel perched on his shoulder , greeted us in English ( many other Welcome Inns feature English-speaking personnel as well ) and led us up the linoleum stairs to our small ( about 10 feet by 12 feet ) , third-story room . The shared toilet was down the hall , and the communal bath lay one flight below . After pointing_out a coin-operated washing_machine and dryer ( a convenience we found at the other Welcome Inns on our trip ) , the innkeeper made one request : that whenever we walked on the tatami mats , we be sure to wear the slippers placed next to the room entrance . But once our two futons were unrolled , there was hardly space to walk -- so we crawled about , feeling a little like children in a playpen . At breakfast the next morning , we saw at a glance that most of our fellow guests were Westerners . No doubt they either could not afford , or were unwilling to pay_for , a pricier hotel -- which , in Tokyo , averages $ 300- $ 400 per night for two people . Our jet-lagged stomachs couldn ' t face the $ 9 Japanese breakfast of rice , fish and miso soup . But we enjoyed the $ 3 American version : large orange_juice , thick toast , scrambled eggs and coffee . Our hotel in the old Shitamachi district , close to the subway and Ueno Park with its museums and zoo , served as a convenient base for exploring Tokyo . In the park , where we enjoyed watching groups of schoolchildren make their excited way to the zoo , we indulged in a cup_of_tea and cookies . We ' d brought a Thermos , tea_bags and snacks from home for just such a purpose ; by filling_up the Thermos with hot water at the Sawanoya , we avoided paying $ 3- $ 4 for a cup_of_tea or coffee in a shop . At a street market near Ueno Station , we ogled torpedo-shaped white daikon radishes , fresh_fish of all kinds , and plump orange kaki , or persimmons , a great autumn favorite among the Japanese . Prices , though higher than at_home , were not prohibitive - except for apples , going_for a shocking $ 10 to $ 15 each . One day , we strolled the exquisitely landscaped grounds of the Imperial Palace . Another , we window-shopped in the city ' s razzle-dazzle Akihabara electronics district -- an expensive , but entertaining , kaleidoscope of flashing lights and day-glo colors . To see what a Japanese department_store looked_like , we headed to Takashimaya , one of the city ' s biggest , not far from the main shopping district known as the Ginza . We spent half an hour in the wedding department admiring the brilliantly patterned kimonos , which sell for thousands of dollars . And , inspired by a massive food hall that puts London ' s Harrods to shame , we headed to the basement restaurant for a satisfying lunch of cold steamed noodles , just $ 6 each . Such moderately priced restaurants are common in most Japanese department_stores . We had no problem locating other inexpensive meals in Tokyo , which boasts more_than 60 # 000 restaurants , and sidestepped the language problem by simply pointing to the ubiquitous wax replicas of house specialties . For example , dinner one evening at a restaurant near our hotel came_to just $ 36 for two -- including strips of beef and chicken we cooked ourselves over a grill and two large bottles of beer . Since the tip was always included in the check , we never had to worry about whether we ' d left enough change for the help . True_to our intentions , we used the subway to get_about Tokyo and encountered no difficulties in doing so . Fares varied depending_on distances , but our trips to the heart of town rarely exceeded $ 1.50 each . We didn ' t worry about getting lost ; we soon learned that whenever we hesitated , confused by which tunnel or which staircase to take , there was always someone who would volunteer directions in English . Returning to the inn late at night , we had no worry about who might be lurking in the dark , ready to mug us -- certainly not after we saw unaccompanied women walking home down dimly lit alleys and streets . Our first three days in Tokyo enabled us to get our feet firmly on the ground . Now we were ready for Kyoto via the famed Shinkansen , or bullet train -- a 2 1 / 2-hou , approximately 300-mile journey that was included in the cost of our two-week rail pass . Our seats were well-designed and relaxing , with plenty of leg room for my 6-foot , 3-inch frame , and despite the 170-m.p.h. speed there was none of the swaying and rattling associated with Amtrak . At regular intervals , a hostess pushed a drink-and-food cart down the aisle . Whenever she left the car , she turned toward the passengers and bowed in our direction , a courtesy my wife and I found affecting . We had purchased two bento , or box lunches , on the platform for around $ 9 each , and settled back to eat them and watch the landscape zip_by . We even spotted Mt . Fuji , its white peak seeming to float disembodied from its base in the industrial haze that hangs over so_much of Japan . As luck would have it , our Kyoto ryokan , the Rikiya -- which we had picked blind from the Welcome Inns list -- turned_out to be_on the eastern edge of the city , at the foot of the wooded hills where so many of the historic temples are located . It was a charming place , on a narrow street free_of automobile_traffic , with a small mossy garden for an entryway . Almost hidden by the foliage was a trickling fountain whose sound created a sense of instant serenity . Perhaps the loveliest thing about such a traditional inn -- a bargain at $ 152 for two , considering many , more luxurious ryokans cost anywhere from $ 100 to $ 600 per person , per night -- is the way nature is invited inside . A large , flat river_boulder served as a step_in the vestibule where the owner , a plump woman in a white kimono , welcomed us with a deep bow and cheerful laughter . We took_off our shoes and placed them in a bamboo-and-wood cabinet that rested_on a row of water-worn cobbles , then tucked our feet into the pea-green , kid-leather slippers waiting for us . The walls were the color of coffee and cream , mimicking the mud finish used in the old days ; the unvarnished woodwork showed its silky grain , and the tatami mats had a fresh , golden_glow . While a maid unfolded our futons , our hostess showed us the immaculate toilets and baths along the common hall . Before re-entering the room , I asked_for the key . Our friendly guide looked puzzled . I pointed to the lock . She shook her head , smiling . Then I remembered : In a traditional ryokan you should feel as though you are at_home , and you don ' t lock doors behind you at_home . We awoke early , often to the muffled sound of distant gongs being rung in the temples , accompanied by the caws and cries of Japan ' s ever-present crows . Breakfast was of_our_own devising : We had discovered a bakery and a supermarket a_few blocks from the inn , where we bought orange_juice ( about $ 3 a quart ) and pastries for around $ 1 each . Every morning , the maid came_to the room with good coffee and thick cream , and we ate_on our porch , watching passersby below . We soon realized that Kyoto provides more charms than our six-day visit could begin to cover . But we managed to see many of the temples , gardens and palaces . We were somewhat dismayed by the high entrance_fees , between $ 4 and $ 5 each . But we offset their costs walking to many of the sights and taking a bus to the more distant ones on the western edge of the city . Using buses proved as easy as taking the Tokyo subway , and most had loudspeakers announcing the stops in English . Kyoto , with its high aesthetics , is a good place to shop . Our neighborhood had many establishments offering tasteful goods , ranging from traditional painted fans and colorful paper lanterns to modern ceramics . Had we the money , we probably would have bought one of everything at the nearby Kyoto Crafts Center , a cooperative displaying the work of more_than 100 local artists . Instead , we settled for two silk , bandana-like cloths ( which Japanese use as a kind of gift_wrap ) and several graphically stunning calendars . The cost : a reasonable $ 6 each . We fell_in_love with Kyoto , and might have stayed longer had we not had a room waiting for us in Hiroshima , a two-hour , 225-mile ride by S hinkansen . Our hotel , the 10-story Kawashima , lay close to the railway_station and was an amusing contrast to our genteel accommodations in Kyoto . The double_bed filled almost the entire room , yet somehow an armchair , a desk , another chair , a TV , a small refrigerator and an electric coffee and tea_maker had been squeezed into it . A closet enabled us to dispose_of our luggage while a Lilliputian bathroom saved us from having to use any shared facilities . For this , we paid $ 110 a night . We ' d come_to Hiroshima to see its Peace Memorial Park and Museum , monuments to the 600 # 000 victims of the atomic_bomb dropped on the city in 1945 . I suspect the museum price is pegged low ( about 50 cents each ) to encourage visitation , but we were struck by how few foreigners we met among the hundreds of Japanese who thronged the area . In the park , hardly_a moment passed without our hearing the reverberating gong of the peace bell being rung by visitors -- a ghostly , haunting counterpoint to the images of destruction and horror we had seen in the museum . We were deeply stirred , but glad to return to the vital atmosphere of Tokyo and to the Sawanoya . Our host was once again on_hand to greet us , cockatiel still riding_on his shoulder , and he gave us a much bigger room this time , which cost only $ 6 more_than the last one . By now , we felt very much at_ease . Looking_back , we had managed what we had set_out to do -- travel economically , even in high-priced Japan . Lunches , mostly in noodle shops , had run about $ 15 for two ; dinners averaged $ 35 for two . Excluding air fare , we ' d spent around $ 3 # 400 for our two weeks -- including lodging , meals , transportation and even a_few souvenirs . Our last_day in Tokyo , we headed back to the central station to catch the train to the airport . Once again , we were engulfed by an onrushing flood of sarariman -- and found ourselves happily swimming along toward the Narita Express and the last lap of our Japan journey . GUIDEBOOK : Getting the Most for Your Dollar on Your Japanese Vacation Getting there : The lowest round-trip fare from LAX to Tokyo is $ 1 # 030 through May 31 ( six-day minimum stay ) ; the fare increases to $ 1 # 140 June through September . United , Northwest , All Nippon , Delta , Korea and Singapore airlines all offer one nonstop_flight daily ; Japan Airlines has one flight daily and a second on Saturdays and Wednesdays . Where to stay : We used the three-year-old Welcome Inn Reservation Center , whose directory lists more_than 500 lodgings ( most in Tokyo and Kyoto ) with rates ranging from about $ 40 to $ 80 per person , per night . Welcome Inn accommodations include ryokan , Japanese-style inns with futons instead of beds ; minshuku , small , family-run inns that are often less expensive than ryokans ; kokumin shukusha , rustic lodgings in national_parks ; hotels ; pensions ; and &quot; business hotels , &quot; small , no-frills , Western-style lodgings often located near train_stations . Overseas visitors reserving through Welcome Inn are exempt from taking breakfast and dinner at ryokans , an extra charge that is mandatory for Japanese guests . Contact the Japan National Tourist Office ( 624 S . Grand Ave. , Suite 1611 , Los Angeles 90017 ; telephone 213- 623-1952 ) for a directory of Welcome Inn lodgings , reservation centers and reservation forms . Mail or fax the forms at least three to four weeks in_advance to one of the reservation centers in Japan . The center accepts reservation requests only with a confirmed booking on a flight arriving in Japan before 3 p.m. the day of check-in . Cancellations are highly discouraged on this deposit-free , non-prepaid service . Welcome Inn bookings may also be made through reservation centers after arriving in Japan ( though availability may be more limited ) . For Tokyo lodgings , contact the Welcome Inn Reservation Center , c / o International Tourism Center of Japan , 9th Floor , Tokyo Kotsu Kaikan Building , 2-10-1 Yurakucho , Chiyoda-ku , Tokyo , 100 ; tel . 011-81-3-3211-4201 or fax 011-81-3-3211-9009 .

Other budget options include lodgings in temples and shrines ( about $ 70 per person , per night , including breakfast ) , and claustrophobic , males-only &quot; capsule hotels &quot; ( about $ 40- $ 70 per person , per night ) geared to Japanese businessmen who missed their last train . Getting_around : The Japan Rail Pass offers unlimited travel on Japan Railways trains and buses . The Japan National Tourist Organization can supply names of agencies that sell the passes , which may vary in price depending_on the agency ' s exchange_rate . Approximate cost is $ 272 per person for a one-week pass , $ 433 for a two-week pass and $ 555 for a three-week pass . Japan Rail Passes must be purchased before departure from the United States . For more information : Contact the Japan National Tourist Organization . I was particularly impressed with the free booklets &quot; Japan for the Budget Traveler &quot; ; &quot; Japan : Your Traveling Companion With Tips for Budget Travel , &quot; which , among other things , described how to apply for and obtain reduced-rate rail passes , and &quot; Hello Japan , &quot; which offered information on everything from the proper way to use chopsticks to the etiquette involved in taking a Japanese bath .</TEXT>
