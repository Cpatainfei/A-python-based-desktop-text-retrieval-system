   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FINALS ; SPOTLIGHT ; HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A couple of British papers chose to use the inevitable Hollywood Western analogy for the World Cup_final : &quot; So the home-town team ( explained as Italy with its New York connection ) has reached the final and now it is a shootout in the West between the two most feared gunslingers on_the_road , &quot; said The Times , under the headline , &quot; Italy versus Brazil ; Baggio versus Romario. &quot; And The Guardian ' s David Lacey led his story this way : &quot; So the final will be a spaghetti Western after all , and a remake at that.It is 24 years since the pass Pele laid_into the path of Carlos Alberto for Brazil ' s fourth and last goal against Italy in the Azteca Stadium epitomized the sweet simplicity of the game . Now Pasadena waits to see if the same holds true in a modern context. &quot;</TEXT>
