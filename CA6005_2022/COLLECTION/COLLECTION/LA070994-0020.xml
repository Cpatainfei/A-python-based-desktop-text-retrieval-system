   <HEADLINE> U.S. , N . KOREA CALL NEGOTIATIONS OVER NUCLEAR STANDOFF PRODUCTIVE ; ASIA : BUT DEATH OF PYONGYANG ' S LEADER CASTS SHADOW OVER FIRST FORMAL TALKS IN MORE THAN A YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States and North_Korea opened negotiations Friday aimed at settling the dispute over Pyongyang ' s nuclear program , with both sides calling the first day ' s talks productive . That the two sides returned to the bargaining table is itself a milestone of sorts . These are the first formal negotiations between the United States and North_Korea in more_than a year . But only 20 hours after the talks began , the death of North_Korean President Kim Il Sung was reported , and Pyongyang suspended the talks , at least temporarily , the North_Korean mission announced today . A mission spokesman said he did not know when the talks would resume . A member of the U.S. delegation said early today , &quot; It ' s not clear whether the postponement will be just for a_few days of mourning or for a longer period. &quot; Joe Bermudez , a close observer of the Kim regime and an author of books on the North_Korean military , said in an interview in Washington that he thinks the president ' s death will not derail the Geneva talks . &quot; The objectives of North_Korean foreign_policy probably will not change in the short term , &quot; Bermudez said . For more_than a year , North_Korea has repeatedly delayed or defied efforts by the International Atomic Energy Agency to carry_out thorough inspections of its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon ; the United States , in turn , has talked_of organizing international sanctions against Pyongyang . Early Friday morning , the chief U.S. delegate , Robert L . Gallucci , who is assistant secretary_of_state , and a team of American officials drove into North_Korea ' s mission to the United Nations here to shake hands with North_Korea ' s Kang and several aides . The two teams then sat_down for seven hours of talks . &quot; In my view , there is a great probability that in the days ahead , we can try to get_together on ways to narrow_down our differences on the nuclear issue , &quot; Kang had told reporters at the end of the day . &quot; Both sides want to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue and by peaceful means. &quot; Before the reports of Kim ' s death , U.S. officials had cautioned that they do not expect any concrete results , good or bad , from the talks for about a week . But Gallucci too Friday night described the beginning of the negotiations as productive and &quot; useful. &quot; Stopping Pyongyang ' s nuclear program is now such a high priority for the United States and its allies that North_Korea was the first item on the agenda when President Clinton met Friday with Japan ' s new Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama in Naples , Italy , site of the economic summit of the world ' s leading industrialized nations . After their meeting , Murayama -- who later fell ill and was briefly hospitalized for diarrhea , dehydration and fatigue -- praised &quot; the tenacious efforts of the United States &quot; in dealing with North_Korea ; Clinton said he was pleased with Murayama ' s assurances of the &quot; continuity of Japanese foreign policy. &quot; The Clinton_Administration has offered to move toward gradual diplomatic recognition of North_Korea and to arrange help for its economy , if Pyongyang will halt and eventually abandon its nuclear program . The United States is particularly eager to work_out some solution for the disposal of fuel , recently removed from the reactor at Yongbyon . The fuel could be reprocessed into enough weapons-grade plutonium to make five or six nuclear_weapons by the end of this year . The CIA believes North_Korea already has enough material for one or two nuclear bombs . &quot; Clearly , the nuclear issue is the central issue ( in the talks ) , &quot; Gallucci said Friday night . &quot; I think everybody understands that. &quot; Kang said that , in the first day ' s discussions , &quot; both sides have identified that there is much in common . At the same time . . . there are also many points on which the two sides differ very much. &quot; In the days leading_up to the talks , American officials have sketched out a scenario under which the United States and North_Korea might agree to take small , gradual steps , so each side would gain confidence in the other . For example , the United States might agree to higher-level diplomatic contacts with North_Korea or to opening of liaison offices in Washington and Pyongyang , if North_Korea continues its freeze on its nuclear program and begins to take steps to dismantle it . &quot; We will move with them , &quot; explained a senior U.S. official this week . He said the American team was envisioning an approach in which the United States and North_Korea might make agreed-on concessions at_the_same_time , to avoid endless arguments over who should act first . But no one on the American side knows yet whether these ideas are acceptable to the North_Koreans -- indeed , whether they are prepared to make any concessions at all on their nuclear program , beyond the current round of talks . If the talks fail , Administration officials say they will revive now-suspended efforts to obtain a formal United Nations resolution for economic sanctions against North_Korea . And there were hints Friday that the United States is still planning for sanctions by shoring_up the support of allies . After Clinton met with Murayama in Naples , a senior Administration official said the Japanese prime_minister &quot; made clear that they would support whatever action was required at the United Nations or in New York. &quot; Times staff writer Paul Richter in Naples contributed to this report .</TEXT>
