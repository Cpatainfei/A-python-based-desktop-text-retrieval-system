   <HEADLINE> THE ATROCITY OF THE FOOD WEAPON ; WILL WEST CONTINUE TO LET THE BOSNIANS BE STARVED BY THEIR GENOCIDAL FOES ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnia is starving . On Tuesday , the United Nations confirmed numbers reported by Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic : During December , people in Bosnian-controlled territory got_about 5.5 pounds of U.N.-delivered food each . In Serb-controlled territory in Bosnia , people got more_than nine pounds . In Croat-controlled territory , 21 pounds . A U.N. official attributed the discrepancy to Serbian and Croatian military superiority : U.N. food is a weapon that the Serbs and Croats had been using aggressively . Serbian and Croatian interference with U.N. relief deliveries to the Bosnians has been ratcheted up sharply during the last three months in a patent attempt to force the Bosnians to accept the partition of their country that has been urged upon them by the European Union and the United Nations itself . The Bosnians are asked to trust , with no evidence , that if they agree to a partition the West will enforce it . They have declined to agree , maintaining bitterly that the suspension of U.N. relief shipments to central Bosnia at the instigation of U.N. peace negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg shows U.N. complicity in the effort to force Bosnia ' s hand . Whatever the U.N. intentions , the effect is clear : Bosnia is starving , and panic is beginning to set_in . On Wednesday , a relief convoy passing_through central Bosnia under government escort was set_upon by a desperate mob . NATO has promised air strikes should Bosnia be threatened with &quot; strangulation , &quot; and on Tuesday Britain , France and the United States called_on Boutros Boutros-Ghali to press ahead with planning for the strikes . The U.N. secretary_general has not done so , however ; and on Wednesday , to keep_up the pressure on him , President Francois Mitterrand and Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur of France went a step further . Rather than just call_for air strikes , they insisted that the United Nations had the authority to call_for NATO troops to relieve the besieged towns of Tuzla and Srebenica . The American response to the_French statement has been confused . Though President Clinton has stressed that great harm will be done if the NATO threat proves idle , the State_Department has bitterly criticized the_French demands on the illogical ground that the proposed partition of Bosnia is unacceptable . The peace proposal is indeed unacceptable , and the American demand that NATO ground troops in Bosnia be European remains reasonable . But these positions can be distinguished from support for a proposal to militarily guarantee relief deliveries and so avert impending genocide . France deserves credit for holding NATO to its word and the United Nations to some accountability . President Clinton should recognize that his own credibility will suffer as much as that of NATO or the United Nations if this proposal falls to American sniping .</TEXT>
