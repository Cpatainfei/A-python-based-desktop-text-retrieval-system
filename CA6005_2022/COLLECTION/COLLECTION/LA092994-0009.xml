   <HEADLINE> NEWS BITES : HOP IT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hops add flavor to beer , and also help clarify and preserve it . So how do you suppose beer_makers measure the amount of hops in a beer ? In International Bitterness Units , of course . Most American beers are hopped at 11 to 14 IBUs , 11 being considered the smallest detectable amount , but English ales are often around 25 and Czech Pilsners up_to 35 . Eating Real High on the Food_Chain Don ' t let anybody tell you lion meat isn ' t tasty . Gourmets say lion steaks are good ( don ' t stew the meat , though ; it will be tender but insipid ) and lion makes great jerky , of a delicately pinkish hue . Bag Those Tomatoes If you have a late-season glut of tomatoes , University of California Extension reminds you that you can always freeze them . Wash and dry tomatoes thoroughly , put them on a plate or baking sheet and freeze whole , then store in a freezer bag with all possible air removed ; they suggest sucking air_out with a straw until the bag adheres to the tomatoes , then removing the straw and sealing . Use within a_couple_of months because they can develop a freezer taste . Defrosted tomatoes will be good for cooking , but not for salad -- the skin cracks during freezing , for one thing ( this makes them easy to peel , though ) . A Hearth Full of Loafbook &quot; Foodbill , &quot; an authorized parody of Playbill , is the official autographed cookbook of the company of &quot; Les Miserables. &quot; Recipes contributed by the cast are written to various tunes_in the show -- &quot; A Heart Full of Love , &quot; for instance , becomes &quot; A Hearth Full of Loaf &quot; ; &quot; Soliloquy &quot; becomes both &quot; Solilo-Quiche &quot; and &quot; Solilo-Kiev , &quot; and the &quot; Finale &quot; is braised fennel and endive , or &quot; Fennel-ee. &quot; ( Yes , they ' re also broken_down into usual recipe format , with measurements. ) Proceeds from the 56-page book benefit Broadway Cares / Equity Fights AIDS . To order , make a check for $ 15 to &quot; Les Miserables &quot; -- BC / EFA and send to &quot; Les Miserables , &quot; 1650 Broadway , Suite 501 , New York , N.Y. 10019 . Caesar Lives Strange to think , 10 years ago the Caesar_salad was in eclipse . Not only is it possibly the most popular salad in restaurants these days , other foods are aggressively Caesarizing themselves . Note Clamato ' s Bloody Caesar Cocktail Mix and Jack in the Box ' s Chicken Caesar Sandwich , more or less a chicken pita sandwich ( plus mozzarella and provolone ) crowned with a Caesar . Ho-Ho-Ho , Ho-Ho-Ho , Ho-Ho-Ho For the fourth year , the Napa Valley Wine Train , which hauls refurbished 1915 Pullman_cars past some of the most famous wineries in California , is offering special trips aimed at a mostly non-wine-drinking group : children .

Introducing : The Iced_Tea Ceremony Coca-Cola and Nestle are ending a joint_venture to bottle iced_tea which hasn ' t kept_up with competitors like Pepsi ' s bottling of Lipton . Their new agreement provides_for some future cooperation , and gives Coke a 100-year license to use the Nestea trademark . . . everywhere except Japan . CHARLES PERRY</TEXT>
