   <HEADLINE> LAWMAKER CHARGES FISKE IS AIDING GOP ON WHITEWATER ; CONGRESS : HOUSE BANKING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN HENRY GONZALEZ ASSAILS COUNSEL FOR REFUSING TO TESTIFY AT HEARINGS . PROBE CHIEF DENIES ALLEGATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B . Gonzalez ( D-Tex. ) assailed Special Counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . on Friday for refusing to testify at Whitewater hearings scheduled for later this month and accused him of secretly providing information to Republican committee_members for partisan attacks on President Clinton . Furious over what he called a &quot; premeditated Republican plan to do_in the President , &quot; Gonzalez said he will proceed &quot; full-speed ahead &quot; with the hearings as scheduled on July 26 , &quot; despite the fact Fiske has breached his commitment to cooperate with the committee. &quot; Gonzalez ' s allegations , coupled with statements by Republican committee_members that they will try to expand the scope of the inquiry , seem certain to turn the hearings into an acrimonious confrontation . Gonzalez , now in his 33rd year in the House , charged that &quot; the Republicans ' main interest is in getting the President and his wife no matter what. &quot; He said he would &quot; rein_in &quot; any Republicans who try to go beyond the scope of the investigation outlined in a House resolution . &quot; I was present for the assassination of one President , and I won ' t be a party to the attempted assassination of another , &quot; said the Texas congressman , who was in Dallas when President John F . Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 . &quot; The Republicans might as well have gotten a hit_man ; they ' ve already attempted to assassinate Clinton ' s character. &quot; Rep . Jim Leach ( R-Iowa ) , the committee ' s ranking minority member and GOP point_man on the Whitewater matter , denied Republicans were making partisan attacks on Clinton . &quot; My position , &quot; he said , &quot; is that no individual is above the law and there ought to be fair and responsible accountability . We are just interested in full disclosure. &quot; As to Fiske , Gonzalez has repeatedly asked the special counsel to testify , which would help the committee in confining its hearings to subjects the counsel has finished investigating . Fiske , arguing that it would be inappropriate for him to testify , insisted Friday that he has already outlined the status of his investigation in a series of letters to Gonzalez . And the special counsel adamantly denied having given information secretly to Republican members . He acknowledged , however , that he met twice with Rep . William F . Clinger Jr . ( R-Pa. ) and agreed to let him see a U.S. Park Police report on White_House aide Vincent Foster ' s suicide &quot; as long as he agreed not to make_it public. &quot; Fiske said he acted to avoid a lawsuit seeking disclosure of the records . Gonzalez said that in curbing the Republicans during the Whitewater hearings , he would follow the same standards he said he had applied to a 1989 Banking Committee inquiry into the involvement of then-President George_Bush ' s son , Neil , with a Colorado savings and loan . &quot; If it ' s improper questioning , I ' ll rein it in . I reined_in the Democrats when they tried to be prosecutorial in_questioning Neil Bush -- and his father , the President thanked me not once but three times for conducting a fair and impartial hearing , &quot; Gonzalez said , referring to the committee ' s probe of Silverado Savings &amp; Loan . &quot; Now the Republicans are trying to make_it political and prosecutorial. &quot; A senior Clinton_Administration official said the White_House agrees with Gonzalez that &quot; Republicans are out_to get the President no matter what , &quot; but that it disagrees_with his characterization of Fiske , a Republican who was appointed to the counsel post by Atty . Gen . Janet Reno . &quot; We find Fiske to be very thorough , comprehensive and serious , &quot; said the official , who declined to be identified . But he said Republicans are faced with &quot; a dicey political risk of trying to strike a delicate balance between being seen as doing their constitutional duty of seeing that there are no improprieties in White_House operations and looking_like they are making a petty , vindictive political attack that is resulting in gridlock. &quot; In a lengthy interview with The Times , Gonzalez also expressed irritation that Fiske now says his report on the handling of Foster ' s papers after the aide ' s death last July 20 will not be ready until some time in late August . Earlier , Fiske had indicated that this phase of his investigation would be completed in time for the Banking Committee to begin looking_into the records-handling issue in its hearings . Leach , who met with Fiske for 90 minutes on Friday , said he also had tried to persuade the special counsel to be the lead-off witness for the hearings . &quot; The minority as well as the majority wanted him to appear , &quot; Leach said in an interview . &quot; But the majority wanted him to outline the parameters of his investigation so the committee would know what it couldn ' t ask . We ' d like him to appear to defend his report &quot; affirming that Foster ' s death was a suicide . After Fiske refused to budge from his position against appearing , Leach said he told Gonzalez he had grave doubts about subpoenaing the counsel and compelling him to testify . Gonzalez , who earlier had indicated he might subpoena Fiske , said that after talking with Leach , &quot; I ' m not going_to subpoena him and make this a side-issue if Leach doesn ' t feel strongly enough to compel him as a witness to testify and make this bipartisan. &quot; In a July 7 letter to Gonzalez , released by the congressman to The Times on Friday , Fiske asked that the committee not seek the testimony of a number of witnesses whose testimony he said is pertinent to his ongoing investigation . They include government officials , Resolution Trust Corp . officials , and a confidential witness identified only as &quot; C.W. , &quot; the person who first discovered Foster ' s body in a park overlooking the Potomac_River .</TEXT>
