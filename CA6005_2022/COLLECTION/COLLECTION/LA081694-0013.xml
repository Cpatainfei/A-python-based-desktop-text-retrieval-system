   <HEADLINE> FOR THE JACKAL , NO PLACE TO HIDE ; TERRORIST ' S ARREST IN SUDAN SHOWS CHANGE IN INTERNATIONAL ATTITUDES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The world ' s most wanted terrorist now sits in a prison_cell in France , two years after he was convicted in absentia of the 1975 killings of two French counterespionage agents who were investigating attacks on Israeli airliners at Orly Airport in Paris . Venezuela-born Illich Ramirez Sanchez , code name Carlos , media-bestowed name the Jackal , was arrested in Sudan over the weekend and promptly delivered to France . The circumstances of his arrest remain murky . Sudan says Carlos entered the country on a false diplomatic passport and along with others engaged in &quot; suspicious activities &quot; that could have embarrassed Sudan . French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua says that French intelligence spotted Carlos in Sudan earlier in the year and urged Sudanese authorities to arrest him . It ' s a credible guess that Paris put intense pressure on the Khartoum government to give_up the man Pasqua says is responsible_for terrorist attacks that killed 83 and injured hundreds worldwide . If so , good for France . There are two major implications of this arrest . First , the protection Carlos and others like him could once count_on from many sympathetic or craven governments has pretty much come_to an end . It ' s all but inconceivable that in the 1970s or ' 80s any Arab regime would have risked the wrath of Carlos ' allies and sponsors by arresting him . The Cold_War ' s end and what seems to be a maturing consensus in much of the Arab world that it ' s also time to end the long conflict with Israel are producing a new political climate , one in which -- just maybe -- terrorists will find they have run_out of places to hide . The second far-reaching implication of this arrest is its dramatic reminder that there cannot be any statute of limitations on terrorism , any amnesty , any lack of diligence in pursuing international killers . French intelligence , either acting alone or in cooperation with the agencies of other countries , put a lot of effort into tracking Carlos after and probably even well before he left his sanctuary in Syria . Finally , decades after his infamous career began , it appears that justice will be done . France in this case has earned the thanks of all who support the international rule_of_law .</TEXT>
