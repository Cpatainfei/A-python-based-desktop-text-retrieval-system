   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : UNION ARGUES CASE ON PENSION_FUNDING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The county ' s retired workers should continue receiving supplemental benefits , but not at the expense of future retirees , representatives of Ventura County ' s public employees union argued Monday . Instead of dipping_into funds reserved for future payments , the county should use general fund revenues or look_for a permanent way to pay the supplemental benefits on which retirees have come_to rely , Steve Wood , president of Service Employees International Union , Local 998 , said at a county Board of Retirement meeting . &quot; We resent the effort that is being made to attempt to make the issue one that pits active employees against retired employees , &quot; Wood wrote in a letter to the board . &quot; What we are committed to doing is finding a solution to a problem. &quot; Last week , the county ' s tax_collector said the retirement board would have to use reserve_funds to pay the $ 5 million it would cost for added benefits in the next fiscal_year . That could eventually deplete the $ 42-million reserve_account and force present employees to pay more toward their own retirement , Tax_Collector Harold S . Pittman said . Faced with the tough choice of canceling the benefits or dipping_into reserves , the retirement board decided to delay the vote for further study . With a new budget year beginning July 1 , the board acknowledged that it could not put the decision off much longer and set a special meeting for 9 a.m. Friday . The dilemma arose when stock_market losses combined with declines in real_estate value left the retirement_fund without excess cash for the added benefits . The supplemental benefits , which are paid in addition to the employees ' regular retirement payments , run as high as $ 280 a month for some retired workers . But retirees argued that the county is overstating the problem . The county ' s retirement_fund has a 5 % reserve , even though state law requires only 1 % to be set_aside . &quot; The fund is very , very healthy , &quot; said Ann Michalski , past president of the county Retired Employees Assn .
