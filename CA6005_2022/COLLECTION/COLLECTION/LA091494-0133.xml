   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : RAMS WILL ONLY LOOK THE PART</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Andre Rison was smart enough to know when to pick his spot , and so are the Rams , proving to be fast learners if nothing else . By now , you ' ve probably heard the teaser : This Sunday , the Rams will look_like champions when they play the San Francisco 49ers . Of course they will . Yellow jerseys with royal_blue block numbers and arm stripes . White pants with gold and blue piping_down each leg . Solid blue stockings . This is what the Rams wore the year they brought the NFL championship back to Los Angeles , the now mythic 1951 season . These were the uniforms Bob Waterfield , Tank Younger and Elroy Hirsch made famous , once upon a time , and if you ' re too young to remember them -- everybody under 45 qualifies -- the Rams are bringing them back the next two weeks in the hope that dressing for success might be enough . The Rams are doing this in accordance with the NFL ' s &quot; Throwbacks Weekend &quot; promotion , a fine idea I ' d assumed the No Fun League was no longer capable of making . This weekend , every team in the league wears a uniform from yesteryear , and some of them are true classics . The Pittsburgh Steelers will wear their 1933 &quot; rugby shirts &quot; -- black and gold vertical stripes with a castle-topped coat of arms on the chest . The San Diego Chargers dig_out their Lance Alworth specials -- powder_blue jerseys and white helmets with gold lightning bolts that debuted in 1961 and , if there ' s any justice , ought to replace the team ' s sad Ram-wanna-be outfits on a permanent basis . The 49ers will oppose the Rams in their 1955 suits -- silver helmets , red shirts and nifty three-D effect numerals that immediately conjure images of giant-finned autos , ceramic diner counters and Hugh McElhenny alone in the open field . The Rams ' throwbacks are golden oldies , too , reminders of a time when the Rams were the boldest team around , instead of the one that runs Jerome Bettis up the middle three times from the one and then botches the take-the-safe-route field_goal attempt . Who else in the NFL had the audacity to wear yellow jerseys on Sunday ? The Rams of 1951 may have looked_like banana_splits , but with Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin cranking_up 54-14 and 48-21 victories , no one seemed to laugh much . &quot; I love ' em , &quot; says Mickey Dukich , the Rams ' director of video operation for the past 39 years . &quot; It was sad to give them up . They were unique , distinctive . Very clean-looking. &quot; The Rams gave them up in 1957 because television , in an ominous sign of things to come , ordered them to . &quot; The games were broadcast in black_and_white then , &quot; Dukich says , &quot; and the gold came_out as gray on TV_sets . It conflicted with white jerseys and light blue jerseys , like the ones the Detroit Lions wore . Television wanted more of a contrast. &quot; The Rams switched to blue and white , but &quot; not without a struggle , &quot; according to Dukich . &quot; Dan Reeves , who owned the Rams then , told our equipment manager , Bill Granholm , to try to find a gold or a yellow that come_across as white , or near it , when it was photographed in black_and_white . &quot; Bill went_through a lot of different shades , but none of them worked until he found a light-colored yellow with blue on it . We went_to the Coliseum one afternoon , he ' d model it on the field and I ' d shoot it from the top of the stadium . Sure enough , it came_out white on the film . We were told we ' d be able to use it . &quot; But then Dan Reeves asked Bill the name of the color . ' Buttercup yellow , ' Bill told him . &quot; That did_it . Mr. Reeves said , ' No way , I ' m not going_to let the reporters know my team plays in buttercup yellow. ' It was back to blue and white after that. &quot; The Rams remained in blue and white throughout the ' 60s and into the ' 70s , until Carroll Rosenbloom bought the team in 1973 and introduced the basic design the Rams wear today . The Rams had some outstanding moments in those &quot; ambulance whites &quot; -- Roman Gabriel , Dick Bass and Deacon Jones made their names in them -- and the 1967 version was one of the two finalists the Rams considered as their &quot; Throwbacks &quot; uniform . &quot; It was Mrs . Frontiere ' s decision , &quot; says Todd Hewitt , Ram equipment manager . &quot; The ' 67 uniform would ' ve been fun , with the white horns on the helmet . But Mrs . Frontiere wanted to go_with the ' 51s , because it was the year we won the championship and it brings_to mind so many great players . And , she liked the uniform. &quot; The Rams intend to wear the yellow ' 51s twice , this Sunday and next , and it is Hewitt ' s responsibility to have them ready . He was a little nervous last week when the jerseys arrived with white cuffs and sleeves -- the ' 51s were all yellow -- and some of the linemen ' s jerseys had the wrong shoulder material . Hewitt had to send them back and hope a rush order for the correct models would arrive by Monday . They did , and were in the shop Tuesday being stitched with names and numbers . These are not authentic ' 51s , Hewitt confesses . First of all , no long sleeves . &quot; With all_the grabbing that goes_on now , &quot; Hewitt says , &quot; a Sean Gilbert or a Jackie Slater is not going_to play in long sleeves. &quot; And no nylon dureen , the heavy material that made the ' 51 jersey feel &quot; like an old blanket when it got wet , &quot; according to Hewitt . The new yellows are lightweight nylon mesh , cooler and more comfortable . Nostalgia has its limits . And what say those who will be seen in public wearing them Sunday ? &quot; When the players first saw the jerseys , they said , ' Aw , we gotta wear those ? &quot; Hewitt says , laughing . &quot; But then they saw the white pants and they said , ' Oh , those are pretty cool. ' I think they thought they were going_to have to wear gold pants , too . That would have been a little too much. &quot; If they were good_enough for Deacon Dan Towler , they ought to be good_enough for Tim Lester . If it sets_back fashion 43 years but brings the football with it , it ' s a trade the Rams should make and stick_with .</TEXT>
