   <HEADLINE> NEW POWER_PLAYS IN FAMILY COURT ; DIVORCE : A GROWING NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO WERE ONCE MARRIED TO INFLUENTIAL MEN ARE CHALLENGING A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT THEY SAY CHEATS THEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Shirley Kirsten tells it , her divorce over the past few years has been less a dissolution_of_marriage than a postmodern version of the 1944 film &quot; Gaslight. &quot; Her psychiatrist husband , she has alleged in court , falsely labeled her psychotic , coerced her into a seven-week hospital stay and forced Prozac down her throat . She claimed in an interview that in the ensuing divorce and custody dispute , her husband used his credentials and influence to sway the medical and legal professionals in Fresno . ( Neither he nor his attorney responded to interview requests. ) But unlike the Ingrid Bergman character , Kirsten -- a concert pianist -- taught herself legal procedures and sued her husband and the hospital . She spoke_to the press . She went_on &quot; Sally Jessy Raphael. &quot; The divorce is now final but the custody dispute is ongoing . She remains in the family ' s six-bedroom home with their six children , she said . The hospital settled but she lost the battery and defamation suit against her husband , who claimed he was only trying to help her with her delusions and depression . Nevertheless , Kirsten sees herself as the moral victor . The point , she said , is that while many traditional women divorcing powerful men might walk away in tears , &quot; This community saw someone fight back. &quot; She is among a growing number of women formerly married to doctors , attorneys , judges , entrepreneurs and celebrities who are challenging a family law system they say still functions according to the old saw , &quot; He who has the gold makes the rules. &quot; They say this bias cheats them out of money and property , and damages their relationship with their children . &quot; We ' re angry , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' re doing stuff about our cases . We ' re not just crying in our pillows. &quot; In organizing other Fresno wives , Kirsten is following the example of the growing Alliance for Divorce and Marriage Reform , a 4-year-old support group based in La Jolla , where emotions still run high over the case of socialite and convicted murderer Betty Broderick . The middle-aged homemaker had been losing a bitter legal dispute over property and custody of their children with her ex-husband , Dan Broderick , a prominent San Diego attorney , when she shot and killed him and his new wife in 1989 . Alliance co-founder Ronnie Brown said many members , including some men , can relate to Broderick ' s anger and frustration over a perceived lack of justice in family court -- a legal outpost where they say judges are rarely held accountable . Brown said alliance members don ' t condone the Broderick shooting . But , she added , &quot; The legal and judicial_system in this town bears a large responsibility for that tragedy . . . . There are some honest attorneys out there who say she got a bum rap ( in family court ) . &quot; Particularly in smaller cities and towns , she and others said , family court decisions seem to be based less on the law than on gender bias , good-ol ' -boy back-scratching , and the ability to pay_for aggressive attorneys and sympathetic psychologists . The group claims a mailing_list of 400 , mostly full-time homemakers , and a chapter in Denver . Task_forces in 21 states -- composed of judges , lawyers and social_scientists appointed by states ' chief_justices -- have found disproportionate gender bias in family law , affecting women more often than men , said New York attorney Lynn Hecht Schafran , who directs a national program to promote judicial equity for men and women , sponsored by the National Assn . of Women Judges and the National Organization for Women . Nineteen others are studying the issue . The problem is not new , just more openly discussed , Schafran said . &quot; Now people talk_about it all_the time , &quot; she said . &quot; But it isn ' t getting any better. &quot; She said complaints of injustice are particularly common in smaller_towns , where the power base comprises people who &quot; all hold hands. &quot; * In California , family court is part of the Superior_Court system , handling divorce , child custody , child_support and any other issue related to the breakdown of a family . The structure varies from state to state ; last summer the American Bar Assn . supported a motion to consolidate all such matters under a family court judge . Growing frustration in several cities is reflected in the installation of metal detectors in family court and the rising number of people representing themselves , now 40 % in Southern California , said Janet Bowermaster , professor of law at California Western School_of_Law in San Diego and a consultant to women ' s rights activists . In Santa Barbara , judges have been given bulletproof_vests . &quot; We ' re close to crisis level , &quot; she said . While divorced men have gained attention recently by protesting what they say are custody and support biases against them , the ex-wives of prominent men talk_of never-ending legal battles with controlling husbands who hide assets and use tactical delays to wear them down financially and emotionally . San Diego attorney Sharron Voorhees , chair of the family law advisory commission to the State Bar of California , said some high-powered men manipulate their assets in anticipation of divorce . In one case , she said , a man reduced his annual income from $ 3 million to $ 400 # 000 by restructuring his business loan to make higher payments . &quot; Then , of course , he was awarded the interest in the business , &quot; she said . The wife was awarded spousal support , which is subject_to modification at any time . &quot; He ' s totally in control of it. &quot; Beyond losing money , Voorhees said the affluent longtime homemakers experience a &quot; psychological undertow &quot; of lost identity marked by dramatic drops_in status and lifestyle . Beth Waggoner , founder of the Denver chapter of the alliance , said she has watched the divorced women in her affluent neighborhood move_out with their children into small apartments . &quot; When I run_into them at school functions , they ' re exhausted , they ' ve worked all day and taken_care of the kids at night . Now they ' re trying to come_back to school in the evening to hear the orchestra concert . They look tired . I ' m watching them get old -- old in a hurry. &quot; One Alliance member , a mother of two school-age boys , said she is facing eviction and taking church handouts while her ex-husband , a developer and civic_leader , is donating to charity and taking expensive vacations . They are fighting for custody and her share of what she says was once a $ 2-million business . &quot; I get so frustrated , I end_up crying all_the time . It ' s abusive , what he ' s doing to us . Lying all_the time . He doesn ' t send support . I don ' t have an attorney to represent me. &quot; Another member said she is now seeking her sixth attorney in 11 years to settle a dispute with her ex-husband , a physician , over his pension and profit-sharing plan . Meanwhile , she said she has applied for food_stamps and has no health_insurance . * The most wrenching stories involve accusations of child_abuse . While some accusations that arise in custody disputes are indeed false , some mothers said judges have sided with abusive husbands , awarding them custody on grounds that the mothers trumped_up the accusations and alienated the children from their fathers . Moreover , they said the judges ordered records to be sealed , or gag orders on the mothers . One 44-year-old mother said that after she ended a brief marriage to an abusive attorney , he was awarded custody of her son even though he was not the biological father . She said she is now $ 80 # 000 in debt and homeless . The judge , her ex-husband and the court-appointed attorney he paid_for were &quot; in cahoots , &quot; all agreeing she had brainwashed the child into thinking he was molested , she said . &quot; They found me guilty of abusing my child without arresting me or having a trial , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m going ballistic. &quot; Bill Harrington , national director of the Washington , D.C.-based American Fathers Coalition , said there is &quot; partial truth &quot; what the alliance says on economic issues . &quot; Any type of high-income client can manipulate the court system to their advantage if they are willing to spend the money to reach that goal . The other party is at a definite disadvantage , &quot; he said , noting that those cases are in the minority . But , he said , &quot; courts tend to favor mothers in custody and child-abuse claims , where high-income men are just as easily derailed as low-income men. &quot; In regular meetings , the groups of activist divorcees are helping each other with support , information on court procedure , and names of judges and attorneys to be avoided . Alliance co-founder Ronnie Brown often accompanies women to court . Some , such_as Kirsten , represent themselves in court and teach others how to take depositions and file briefs . As her own attorney , Kirsten said she questioned her ex-husband on the stand_for eight hours . Another judicial activist , Cindy Hart of Santa Barbara , has been representing herself for two years in her divorce settlement and has become a force behind a drive to unseat Superior_Court Judge Bruce Dodds . &quot; He ( said ) in court , ' All I have to do is look_at her to see if she had psychological problems ' and I walked_out_of his courtroom with a psychological ruling , &quot; she said . * Acknowledging in an interview that he might appear insensitive at times , Dodds affirmed that he found Hart had a mental disability : &quot; After listening to her , it was clear she had some psychological , emotional problems. &quot; In general , he said litigants find themselves in family court through a &quot; self-selecting process . We see the ones who have problems . . . . &quot; Many litigants come_in seeking vindication , Dodds said , but civil courts deal only in financial resolutions . &quot; We turn people ' s sorrow into dollars and cents , &quot; he said . Dodds , recently re-elected , said confidentiality requirements prevent him from commenting at length on a report in the Santa Barbara News-Press that he is being investigated by the state Commission on Judicial Performance for judicial misconduct . But , he said , &quot; There are no allegations relating to Cindy Hart , &quot; or a second woman who complained that Dodds minimized the sexual molestation of her son . An American Bar Assn . official said family court reforms are necessary , but would be superficial and would not address the real problem : the inherent emotion and trauma in a contentious divorce . &quot; When a man and a woman break_up a relationship , all hell breaks_loose , &quot; said attorney Raymond Trombadore , chair of the ABA ' s professional discipline committee . An ABA report , following a series of national public hearings in 1989 and 1990 , concluded that most charges of bias and injustice were individual , based on perception , and not systemic . &quot; I don ' t doubt people come_out of this system with tremendously bruised sensitivities , &quot; he said . But &quot; it ' s the bitterness , the rage of those two people which produces the result , not the court , not the lawyers. &quot; Alliance member Lori Graham of Del Mar replied , &quot; I think they want to protect their own . The system itself is incestuous . The ( Bar Assn. ' s ) highest income earners are family law attorneys . . . . The system itself creates trauma . It ' s pure vampirism. &quot; Both agreed a new system would help . &quot; Maybe what we need to do is ask whether we ought to be in this business in the first place , &quot; Trombadore said . &quot; Maybe these people ought to be turned_over to a more predictable , less conflict-laden system so they don ' t use the system to generate all this Sturm and Angst . &quot; Meanwhile , NOW ' s Schafran said , &quot; Women have to be much more savvy about the system . Women have to be much more independent about their finances . Women who chose to stay home are making a perfectly respectable , wonderful choice . They should know the risk they run in making that choice. &quot;</TEXT>
