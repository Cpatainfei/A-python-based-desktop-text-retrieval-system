   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; FIFA GETS TOUGH ON ROUGH PLAY ; SOCCER : BOLIVIA ' S ETCHEVERRY , SPAIN ' S NADAL OUT FOR REST OF FIRST ROUND AFTER GETTING RED CARDS IN FIRST GAMES . SPAIN TO APPEAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a move leaving little doubt that rough play will not be tolerated during World Cup ' 94 , a soccer disciplinary panel Sunday suspended key players from Bolivia and Spain for the rest of the first round . Marco Etcheverry of Bolivia and Miguel Nadal of Spain must sit_out two games after each was ejected for bruising tackles in separate matches during the opening day of the World Cup on Friday . Although the harsh sanctions were not a surprise , they signaled a departure from the past , when players were suspended for one game after drawing a red-card ejection . In following an edict of executives of FIFA , soccer ' s world governing body , the panel members sent a strong message to defenders who are used to killing scoring opportunities by tripping attackers . &quot; We want to crack_down on violent action , &quot; said Joseph Blatter , general secretary of FIFA . The disciplinary panel , meeting at FIFA headquarters in Irving , also ruled that two yellow-card warnings for one player during first-round matches would result in automatic one-game suspensions . But it was the suspensions that ignited the World Cup ' s first major controversy as Spanish and Bolivian officials fumed over the severity of the penalties . Coach Javier Clemente of Spain said in Chicago that the team will appeal Nadal ' s suspension although he holds_out little hope of getting the decision overturned . &quot; When referees become the principal argument in the game , then it ' s goodby to soccer , &quot; Clemente said . &quot; A lot of the referees don ' t have enough knowledge about the new regulations . There is a psychosis with tackles and not all_the referees apply the rules_in the same way , &quot; Nadal said the ruling was painful . &quot; I did not intend to make the foul , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve played only 26 minutes and for my first foul in the match I might get thrown_out of the World Cup. &quot; Xavier Azkargorta , Bolivia ' s coach , said in Boston that Etcheverry deserved no more_than a one-game suspension . Team officials said they would not appeal . &quot; It wasn ' t real aggression , &quot; Azkargorta said . &quot; It ' s true he kicked him , but not so hard. &quot; Even though Bolivia and Spain will play with 11 men in their next games , the suspensions might affect their chances of reaching the second round from Group C . Etcheverry , who recently returned from a knee injury , is Bolivia ' s star scorer . Nadal , a versatile midfielder , is Spain ' s captain . The Bolivian and Spanish soccer federations also were fined $ 3 # 570 on Sunday , the minimum under the rules for a red card . Etcheverry was ejected in the Cup opener against Germany in Chicago after he tried to kick Lothar Matthaeus , Germany ' s captain . Later in Dallas , Nadal drew a red card when he tackled Kim Joo-sung from behind as the South_Korean raced alone toward Spain ' s goal .</TEXT>
