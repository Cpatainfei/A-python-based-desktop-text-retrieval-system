   <HEADLINE> A SOUP FOR THE SEASON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A trip to a local farmers market provided much of the inspiration for this dish . Sweet red_peppers , zucchini , yellow_squash , a bunch of chicory and bouquets of fresh rosemary were abundant . At home , I combined these ingredients with carrots , leeks , potatoes and celery from my refrigerator and cannellini beans from my cupboard . The vegetables , simmered in chicken_stock flavored with a little tomato puree and spicy seasonings , were fork-tender after an hour of cooking . To go_with the soup , serve a salad of spinach , sliced sweet red_onions and artichoke hearts , all tossed_in a lemon-garlic dressing , served with a loaf of crusty sourdough_bread bought_at a local bakery .
