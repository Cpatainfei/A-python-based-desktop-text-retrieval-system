   <HEADLINE> YEMENI FORCES ' AIR AND GROUND WAR INTENSIFIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Southern Yemeni forces launched air and missile attacks on the capital , Sana , and northern troops advanced on the southern port of Aden on Friday in the worst fighting since the two Yemens united four years ago . The latest battles blew apart what remained of the fragile thread that has held together the Arab world ' s poorest country since the former Marxist south and the conservative north came_together . Yemen ' s official Saba news_agency said southern forces , numerically inferior to the army of the north but with superior air_power , fired five Russian-made Scud missiles at Sana . The missiles , launched from bases near Aden 180 miles away , caused no casualties or serious damage , it said . A north Yemen official said the capital also came under repeated southern air_attacks . He said raiding southern warplanes had dropped bombs at random on Sana &quot; causing damage to some civilian areas. &quot; Seven southern plans were reportedly shot down . Amid the chaos , President Ali Abdullah Saleh issued decrees firing the country ' s oil minister and the governor of Aden , members of the southern Yemen Socialist_Party . North Yemeni forces said in a statement they were advancing on Aden on four fronts and would not stop until they took the former capital of South Yemen . The fighting has trapped an estimated 1 # 500 Westerners in the rugged country on the southwestern tip of the Arabian_Peninsula . The French navy earlier Friday evacuated about 560 foreigners . Further evacuations were planned by France , Moscow and Washington . The latest battles , following pitched air and artillery fights between northern and southern forces Thursday , have cut Yemen off from the rest of the world , and it is impossible to verify rival claims . Yemen ' s fragile union has been under threat because of rivalry between Saleh and Vice_President Ali Salem Beidh , a southerner .</TEXT>
