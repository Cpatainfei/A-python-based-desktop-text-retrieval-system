   <HEADLINE> PLOWING UP BIG TROUBLE ; AGRICULTURE : THE EPA SAYS A 60-ACRE FARMING VENTURE IN VENTURA COUNTY DESTROYED 23 ACRES OF WETLAND . THE OWNERS FACE STIFF COMPENSATION COSTS AND SAY THE FIELD LOST $ 50 # 000 IN ITS FIRST YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When his truck jounces along the rough road past Conejo Ranch , farmer Jim Roberts sees a tidy field of baby vegetables -- the same kind of wispy , hopeful blooms that cloaked the field one year ago . But although the Ventura County field looks just as it did last fall , Roberts views it differently . Where he once saw rich dirt and ripe potential , he now sees pain , frustration and anger . Since they planted the first seeds on Conejo Ranch during Thanksgiving week of 1993 , Roberts and partners Craig Underwood and Minos Athanassiadis have endured an astounding pileup of troubles on their 60-acre field . Their biggest heartbreak : the federal Environmental Protection Agency recently determined that the farmers destroyed 23 acres of valuable wetland when they clear-cut , drained and leveled Conejo Ranch to prepare it for planting . In a crushing verdict , the EPA ordered the partners to compensate California for the loss of key riparian habitat . They must either restore a large chunk of the field to its natural_state or enhance a torn-up wetland elsewhere in the county . The exact penalty is likely to be determined during negotiations over the next several months . Depending_on the settlement , the partners ' tab could range from less than $ 100 # 000 to more_than $ 2 million , according to wetland consultants . The EPA ' s harsh mandate is by far the worst blow of this tumultuous year . But the farmers have faced a fair share of other troubles as well . They have skirmished with irate neighbors about a giant , stinking compost heap on a corner of Conejo Ranch . They have struggled to find markets in a competitive industry dominated by a_few agribusiness giants . And they have watched part of a promising corn crop wither in the field when they could not unload the ears at decent prices . Last fall , they cooed and clucked over Conejo Ranch as though it were a newborn . This year , they anguish and fret over the field as though it were a juvenile_delinquent . The enterprise lost $ 50 # 000 in its first year . All the tumult , Roberts mused , &quot; changes the way you look_at the land. &quot; Nonetheless , all three partners fiercely believe they will survive , if they keep doing what they have been doing elsewhere for years . That includes farming Conejo Ranch , carrying_on from season to season , waiting out the bad times and waiting for the good . As Roberts explained : &quot; that ' s farming. &quot; Fewer and fewer farmers these days can endure the ups and downs . The most recent U.S. census disclosed that the number of farms in the United States has dropped below 2 million for the first time since the Civil War . Meanwhile , about 2 million acres of agricultural land vanish each year , the rich soil buried under the concrete crust of development . In launching Conejo Ranch , the partners were aware that they were bucking a national trend . They were proud_of taking the risk . The field , tucked between scrub-spotted hills and a plant-lined creek , was vacant for a decade before the partners bought_it in the spring of 1993 . The farmers eagerly ripped_out the helter-skelter growth and laid_down neat furrows , an elaborate drainage_system , shiny irrigation pipes . &quot; To us , it seemed like we were doing a really good thing , &quot; Underwood said . Federal_officials , however , took a different view . After a six-month investigation that wrapped_up in late October , EPA biologists determined that the farmers had destroyed a unique riparian ecosystem linking the Santa Monica Mountains with nearby Conejo Creek . Because the ranchers did not know they were tampering with a wetland when they sent_in their tractors , EPA biologist Aaron Setran said the agency will not press criminal charges . But the government will still exact a heavy toll , by demanding that the farmers replace the &quot; values &quot; of the destroyed habitat . &quot; All the natural disasters we face pale before what state and federal regulators can do , &quot; said Rex Laird , executive_director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau . Just as much as the expense , the farmers resent the implication of the EPA ' s verdict . &quot; I consider myself an environmentalist , &quot; Roberts said . &quot; that ' s why I do what I do -- to be outside , with nature . This just doesn ' t sit right. &quot; Underwood added : &quot; We thought we were doing an exceptional thing on Conejo Ranch . Sometimes you ' re not rewarded for doing things right. &quot; But EPA biologists would argue that the farmers did not do things right . Before buying Conejo Ranch , they should have consulted with environmental experts , who might have warned them that the moist field , with its clusters of cattails and rushes , could fall_under federal jurisdiction . As Bart Doyle , a Los Angeles wetland attorney , explained : &quot; In California , you should always assume some part of your land is regulated , no matter what you want to do with it. &quot; Ironically , federal law would have allowed the farmers to do anything they wanted on Conejo Ranch if they had first drained the water and let the field dry_up , according to several environmental attorneys . The Clean Water Act prohibits only the &quot; discharge &quot; of material into a wetland . That covers any redistribution of soil in a wetland -- from digging a ditch to churning_up earth with a bulldozer . But other destructive activities remain legal : chopping plants by hand , burning vegetation , even pumping out water , as long as no soil is shifted . If careful , land owners can legally destroy a wetland -- and then , once the parcel is dry , build or farm with impunity , lawyers said . &quot; Frankly , to this day you can do all sorts of things in wetlands , &quot; San Francisco attorney David Ivester said . The Conejo Ranch farmers could still challenge the EPA ' s decision . And they are tempted . But the thought of going_up against a federal agency scares them . If they choose not to appeal in court , their only option is to negotiate . Generally , the EPA requires offenders to restore two acres of wetland for every one destroyed . The farmers could create a wetland corridor along their field ' s border , clear non-native shrubs from an overgrown creek_bed , pump water into a dried-up pond or dream_up some_other project . Depending_on the complexity , wetland repair jobs can cost anywhere from $ 2 # 000 to $ 60 # 000 an acre , environmental consultants said . The EPA ' s open-ended instructions leave the farmers free to scout the cheapest way to pay their dues . But whatever option they choose , they will never be able to fully make_up for the lost habitat , scientists said . &quot; There was a mosaic to that wetland . . . and you ' ll never , ever replace that , &quot; Setran said . &quot; It was unique unto itself. &quot; In planting Conejo Ranch , the partners fancied they were reinvigorating the land by reviving its agricultural roots . That respect for farming tradition , however , clashed with the environmentalists ' respect for nature , which had reclaimed the land with flair in just one decade . Conejo Ranch ' s planting foreman , Natividad Zavala , said the economic importance of the farm should be factored into the equation . As his crew of harvesters crouched under a stormy November sky to pick carrots , Zavala said : &quot; Look how many mouths you feed with this field . We have to do this to live . Of course , I don ' t want the animals to die . But I don ' t want myself to die either. &quot; Restoring the wetlands could cost a bundle , Underwood insists : &quot; We will not allow that piece of property to threaten the rest of our farming operation. &quot; Although Conejo Ranch is the only property they own , the partners farm 22 parcels of leased land in Ventura County . Profits from those fields more_than made_up for the losses at Conejo Ranch this year . But they still hope to turn a profit on Conejo Ranch . They are counting_on brisk sales of the field ' s most recent crop : baby carrots , with a sprinkling of red , gold and candy beets tossed_in as well . The partners hope the carrots will swing the ranch back into the black , after a $ 100 # 000 loss from summer corn wiped_out a $ 50 # 000 profit from last winter ' s crop of greens . Still , Underwood forecast a decent return for his company at year ' s end . The 22 Ventura County fields that the partners rent and farm bailed_out Conejo Ranch ' s loss on the corn crop . And the financial fallout from the EPA probe probably won ' t be felt until 1995 . For enduring 12 months of turmoil , the partners will each earn about $ 70 # 000 . As Roberts concluded : &quot; There will be a Christmas. &quot; About This Series &quot; 60 Acres of Hope , &quot; a series that concludes today , has traced the first year of a new Southern California farming operation . Today ' s article wraps_up the tumultuous year and looks ahead at the uncertain future of the 60-acre Ventura County field known as Conejo Ranch . The story also explores an Environmental Protection Agency ruling that the farmers must compensate the government for destroying a wetland area when preparing their field for planting . Previous articles have examined the mechanics and economics of farming , from planting to harvesting to marketing .</TEXT>
