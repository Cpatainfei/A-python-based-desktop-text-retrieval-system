   <HEADLINE> TB CASE DISCOVERED AT SECOND SCHOOL IN GARDEN GROVE ; DISEASE : OFFICIALS PLAN TO TEST 262 CLASSMATES OF GIRL WHO CONTRACTED TUBERCULOSIS . OCCURRENCE IS DEEMED LESS SERIOUS THAN AN EARLIER OUTBREAK AT LA QUINTA HIGH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> County health officials said Wednesday that an active tuberculosis case has been discovered at a second Garden Grove school , prompting them to test more_than 260 classmates of a girl whose condition was diagnosed this summer . Garden Grove High_School parents were informed about the situation over the past few weeks in a series of letters from the Orange County Health_Care Agency and during a community meeting at the campus last month . More_than 100 students have been tested so far . At least 13 have tested positive , but none have experienced any symptoms of the disease . They will be given drugs designed to kill the bacteria that causes TB . More_than 90 % of people who test positive never develop symptoms of the disease , officials said . County officials said this case is not related to an outbreak of tuberculosis at nearby La Quinta High_School , which has been a source of controversy for more_than two years . Seventeen La Quinta students have been treated for active TB over the past two years . More_than 100 other students and school employees tested positive but have not become ill so far . The U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control concluded after an investigation that the outbreak began in part because a private physician failed to properly treat and immediately report a La Quinta student who had developed a drug-resistant strain of TB . Jody Meador , the county ' s tuberculosis controller , said the Garden Grove High student who contracted TB has no links with La Quinta High and that she suffers from a different form of the disease . &quot; This is a completely independent situation , &quot; Meador said . The girl ' s condition was diagnosed in July after she went_to a doctor with several telltale tuberculosis symptoms : persistent coughing , night sweats and a low-grade fever . * The doctor promptly informed health agency and school district officials , who immediately began developing a strategy for testing classmates who came_in regular contact with the girl , Meador said . Tuberculosis is a highly infectious_disease that attacks the lungs as well as other parts of the body . It can be transmitted to people who share airspace with the carrier , Meador said . Within days of being notified of the case , health officials mailed the first of two letters to the homes of 262 students who were enrolled in classes with the girl . Health department nurses also contacted some parents by telephone , said Alan Trudell , a spokesman for the Garden Grove Unified School District . About 150 students remain untested . Trudell said that some of those students have been_on vacation and don ' t know about the case , while others have moved_out of the area . Students who have not yet been examined will be allowed to enter school when classes begin this morning . But they are being urged to be tested within two weeks and could eventually be barred from the campus if they refuse , Trudell said . The school district today plans to hand-deliver letters to returning classmates . An identical letter will be mailed home to their parents this week , Trudell said . Students can be tested at several locations , including at the district ' s Assessment and Registration Center , 9802 Woodbury Road , in Garden Grove . Meador said it ' s impossible to know where the girl contracted tuberculosis . The girl is recovering at_home , where she is being isolated until health officials determine that she won ' t pass along the bacteria to others , Meador said . It usually takes two to six weeks of treatment before tuberculosis is rendered non-contagious , she said . * The Garden Grove High case presents &quot; a better public health situation &quot; than the La Quinta High case because it was diagnosed and reported quickly , Meador said . &quot; This is the way a situation like this is supposed to be handled , &quot; she said . La Quinta student Debi French , 18 , and her family sued the school district and county earlier this month , charging that they failed to warn parents immediately after another student was found to have contagious tuberculosis in 1991 . French ' s case was diagnosed in 1993 . Doctors were forced to remove part of her lung when drug treatments failed to halt the disease ' s spread .</TEXT>
