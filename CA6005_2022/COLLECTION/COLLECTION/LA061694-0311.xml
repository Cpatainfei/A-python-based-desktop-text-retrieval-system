   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : WESTLAKE VILLAGE ; SOCCER STAGE PARENTS READY FOR SHOW TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The wait is finally over for the San Fernando Valley ' s top soccer parents , the Wynaldas and the Joneses , the banner-waving foursome looking as though they stepped_out of a Fourth_of_July parade . Saturday is show time for their sons , when the U.S. national team meets Switzerland in their first match of the World Cup . &quot; Everyone is in_for a surprise , &quot; predicted Dave Wynalda , father of Eric Wynalda , a forward for the underdog Americans . &quot; We ' ve got talent the world is unaware of. &quot; The talents of Wynalda and teammate Cobi Jones are becoming legendary in their hometown of Westlake Village as hype over the monthlong mega-event grows . &quot; People in_stores are starting to recognize me as Eric ' s mom when they look_at my checks and see ' Wynalda , ' &quot; said Sue Wynalda . &quot; I have to behave myself now. &quot; And the Wynaldas ' store , Soccer Kick , has for months been a hub of enthusiasm for the tournament , as locals drop_by to browse World Cup shirts , key chains and other paraphernalia , watch videos or just talk soccer . Attending their son ' s top-level international matches is nothing new for the Wynaldas . Eric , 25 , played in the 1990 World Cup in Italy and is a member of a German professional team . For Freeman and Mada Jones , though , watching their 24-year-old son compete for the world ' s most coveted sports prize caps 16 years of trudging to youth league , high_school , college and national team games . &quot; This is an end of an era , &quot; said Freeman Jones . &quot; It ' s different than when we watched him play as a boy and as an amateur . Now , he ' s at the epitome of soccer , and he ' s a man. &quot; As images from the World Cup are beamed to an unprecedented number of television viewers , some cameras may fix on the Westlake Village contingent -- the Joneses and the Wynaldas -- who plan to attend each game the United States plays . They ' ll be the ones in red , white and blue . &quot; Everyone has to bring flags to the games , &quot; said Sue Wynalda . &quot; I don ' t want to see any U.S. fans there without flags . &quot; It helps our boys to look_up and see their colors waving in the crowd . It gives them courage. &quot; KURT PITZER</TEXT>
