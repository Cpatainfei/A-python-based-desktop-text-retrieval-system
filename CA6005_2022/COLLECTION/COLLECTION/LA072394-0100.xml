   <HEADLINE> VATICAN SEEKS ISLAMIC ALLIES IN CLASH WITH U.N. OVER POPULATION_CONTROL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Vatican spokesman says the Catholic_Church is seeking_out allies in the Islamic world to defend the family and , especially , the unborn . According to Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo , a Colombian , the Vatican will hold a large interreligious conference on the family at the end of September , in which several Islamic delegations will participate . Rome has already sought assistance from Islamic countries to work_at the United Nations Conference on Population and Development to be held_in Cairo Sept . 5-13 . That meeting is expected to turn_into a kind of showdown between the Holy_See and its allies -- mostly developing nations -- on one side , and the United Nations , the United States and other wealthy nations on the other . The main point of contention is access to abortion and artificial contraceptives worldwide . &quot; Islamic teaching condemns abortion , &quot; Lopez Trujillo said in an interview with the Rome daily Il Tempo . &quot; But some Arab governments are subject_to the influence of political pressure from the West. &quot; Church officials have_on a number of occasions decried the practice of tying aid for developing countries to birth_control programs as a new kind of imperialism . The cardinal said a number of heads_of_states from underdeveloped countries are in_agreement with the Holy_See and skeptical of the U.N. ' s plans for population_control . But their hands are tied , he said , by the funds they receive from international agencies . &quot; If all_the presidents were free from these kinds of pressures , certainly a greater number of countries would be more consciously against the unacceptable and ambiguous points of the preparatory document for the Cairo conference , &quot; Lopez Trujillo said . The head of the World_Council of Churches , General Secretary Konrad Raiser , last week attacked the Vatican ' s constant campaign concerning the conference . Raiser argued that the Vatican ' s repeated worries -- widespread access to abortion and contraception -- risked clouding over another important Catholic interest : social development . But Catholic leaders have argued precisely that point : More_than 90 % of the preparations for the meeting have been about population_control , they claim , and less than 10 % about development . Lopez Trujillo was especially strong in his attack on the United States , which he said wants to make abortion accessible to all_the countries of the developing world . &quot; The government adds that this should be ' safe and rare , ' &quot; the cardinal said . &quot; But what does this mean ? Safe for the health of the mother . But what about the child conceived , shouldn ' t it be equally respected ? &quot;</TEXT>
