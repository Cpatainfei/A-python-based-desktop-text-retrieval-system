   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; NATIONAL REACTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> DAVID HALBERSTAM , Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has written extensively on the Nixon era &quot; What history will remember is that Nixon was the only President who could go_to China without being redbaited by Richard Nixon . . . . &quot; People have been talking_about how hard it was for him to govern when he was elected in 1968 , because the country was so divided . But history will note it was divided largely because Nixon himself deliberately divided it. &quot; * GERALD R . FORD , 38th President of the United States &quot; The Watergate tragedy ought to be closed . . . and I hope it will be . It was one of the must unfortunate incidents in the history of the American political scene . The book ' s closed . Let ' s look_forward to the future. &quot; * ROY JESSEE , a former infantryman selling T-shirts at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial &quot; He just got caught . Watergate , Whitewater -- what ' s the difference ? Nixon was just the scapegoat. &quot; * ROBERT H . MICHEL , House minority_leader &quot; I knew I could always count_on him for advice and counsel . He was truly one of the last of the giants of the generation who helped shape America ' s -- and the world ' s -- destiny after World_War II. &quot; * RICHARD LAMM , former governor of Colorado and currently director of the Public Policy Institute at the University of Denver &quot; There are really two Richard Nixons . There is the paranoid politician , a man who picked_at every sore he could find on the body_politic , and there in the same body was this overarching geopolitical thinker . You ' ve got_to find a way to weigh them together. &quot;</TEXT>
