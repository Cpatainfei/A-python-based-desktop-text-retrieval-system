   <HEADLINE> ANYONE FOR ADULT SOLUTIONS TO MEXICO-U.S. BORDER PROBLEM ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two recent investigations have confirmed fears that corrupt Mexican officials are cooperating with sophisticated smuggling rings that import illegal immigrants into the United States . To their credit , Mexico_City authorities have begun a crackdown . But however successful that effort proves to be , it won ' t address the larger challenge -- true and effective regulation of the flow of people across the open border . OMINOUS CORRUPTION : According to a recent article by Times staff writer Sebastian Rotella , the regional chief of the Mexican immigration service in Tijuana and two of his deputies have been dismissed and charged with corruption . A dozen other Mexican border officials are also under investigation by the Mexican Interior Ministry , which oversees that country ' s immigration agency . The government probe grew out of an independent investigation by the respected Tijuana-based Bi-National Center for Human_Rights . That activist group documented what one of its leaders called a &quot; scandalous and ominous &quot; pattern of corruption in which regional immigration officials not only tolerated people smugglers but , in some instances , actively aided them in delivering groups of non-Mexican illegal immigrants across the U.S. border . Non-Mexicans account_for only about 10 % of the illegal immigrants detained by the U.S. Border_Patrol in its San Diego sector . But they are the most lucrative clientele for smugglers . Chinese pay_up to $ 30 # 000 for illegal entry to this country , for example , compared to the $ 300 or so charged an illegal Mexican immigrant . One can only hope that the crackdown by Mexico_City will nip this sleazy but profitable enterprise in the bud before it becomes as entrenched as drug smuggling . THE LARGER ISSUE : Mexico_City and Washington could help enormously by noting that the illegal traffic in non-Mexicans is a problem for both nations -- because the despicable activity not only flouts U.S. immigration laws but also undermines President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s effort to end official corruption in Mexico . That understanding should propel them to cooperate more closely on combatting the people smugglers . It should , but it might not : Getting any Mexican agency to cooperate with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service these days is highly problematic . The revival of illegal immigration as a political issue in the United States has led some U.S. politicians to be downright demagogic , and that has Mexican nerves raw . Even as popular and progressive a leader as Salinas would risk infuriating Mexicans if cooperation with the INS were seen by his countrymen as an accommodation to the anti-immigrant bandwagon . What Washington could do for Salinas is to discuss a complex and admittedly controversial Mexican proposal that has gotten scant attention in the U.S. immigration debate , yet could be a solution to perhaps 50 % of the problem : a treaty to legalize and then regulate the flow of Mexican workers into -- but also eventually out of -- the United States . Call it a guest-worker program , a new bracero program -- whatever . U.S. officials have been reluctant to discuss it in recent years , even as the historic North_American Free_Trade Agreement was being negotiated with Mexico and Canada , because of political opposition from organized labor and some of our more strident immigration restrictionists . THE REAL CHALLENGE : Yet experts who have studied the flow of people between Mexico and the United States have long argued that it is largely , if not entirely , an economically motivated migratory flow of workers seeking jobs , not immigrants seeking U.S. residency or angling for social_service or health benefits . If some way could be found to regulate that flow -- making_it aboveboard and legal , eliminating the exploitation that predictably comes_with criminality -- then it could be as efficient as the cross-border flow of goods and capital now regulated by NAFTA . Sure , it ' s a provocative proposal . But certainly it is no more controversial than some of the proposals put_forward in this country to &quot; solve &quot; the illegal immigration problem , such_as ill-conceived notions of denying health_care , education and even citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants . Indeed , a bilateral labor pact has a far better chance of working than some of those far-fetched ideas . At a minimum a &quot; North_American Free Labor_Agreement &quot; could help the United States control that part of its immigrant flow originating from Mexico -- anywhere from 50 % to 60 % of the problem , if INS arrest statistics are accurate . Surely this is a goal well worth pursuing as a start on crafting a rational immigration policy . If it is not pursued , all we have are divisive anti-immigrant panaceas and periodic crackdowns on officials on both sides of the border who succumb to the temptation of easy profit in the trafficking of desperate human_beings . The laws of economics and human nature being what they are , that approach is likely to prove only partially successful at best . And that is just not good_enough .</TEXT>
