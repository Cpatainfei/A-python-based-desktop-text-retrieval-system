   <HEADLINE> COMET FRAGMENTS BEGIN CRASHING INTO JUPITER ; ASTRONOMY : IMPACT OF FIRST CHUNK CREATES A GARGANTUAN FIREBALL . SCIENTISTS ARE ELATED AT THE IMAGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The world ' s astronomers focused Saturday on Jupiter as mountain-sized fragments of a shattered comet -- traveling 60 times faster than a bullet -- began raining_down on the dark side of the solar_system ' s largest planet , triggering a fireball half the size of Earth . After the predicted impact of the first -- and smallest -- chunk of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 at 1 p.m. , astronomers in Spain and Chile reported seeing a large plume as the impact site rotated into view . Within 90 minutes , the fiery plume had grown_into a huge fireball 4 # 000 miles across and 1 # 000 miles high , NASA astronomers said late Saturday . The plume is brighter than anything else on Jupiter and brighter than its brightest moon , Io , said comet co-discoverer Eugene Shoemaker . &quot; I mean , it ' s bright ! &quot; he exclaimed . When the first raw image from the Hubble Space Telescope showed evidence of what appeared to be the plume from the first impact , scientists gathered around the video monitor gasped in astonishment and then shouted with glee . They swigged celebratory champagne straight from bottles . &quot; We actually saw some amazing things , &quot; said planetary astronomer Heidi B . Hammel at NASA ' s Goddard Space Flight Center outside Washington . &quot; We can actually see the impact site , &quot; she said . &quot; It is a new feature on Jupiter , and we are going_to have 20 more of them this week , each one even brighter. &quot; Although the impacts were all to take_place out of Earth ' s vision , Jupiter rotates so quickly that the impact sites come_into view within half an hour of each collision . Virtually every major telescope in the world was trained on the giant planet as the first of 21 chunks of the comet hit the night side of Jupiter on schedule . Thousands of astronomers jockeyed for the best view -- from the South_African Astronomical Observatory outside Cape_Town and the Palomar Observatory outside San Diego to a thicket of eight observing stations atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii , and NASA ' s airborne observatory circling the globe at 41 # 000 feet over Australia . The Hubble telescope , orbiting well above the atmosphere that blurs the vision of earthbound observers , has one of the best views of Jupiter and is expected to take hundreds of images of the impact sites in the coming week . NASA also has launched high-altitude sounding_rockets from New Mexico . In all , three major fragments of debris were expected to blast through the planet ' s swirling cloud_cover by midnight Saturday , with others bombarding the planet at about six-hour intervals for the next six days . The largest piece of comet is expected to hit Jupiter on Wednesday . Although the first comet fragment hit just after lunchtime , scientists did not see any processed images of Jupiter , taken by NASA ' s space telescope , until late Saturday . Denied a direct view of the shooting stars , scientists were searching for aftereffects of the impacts -- from lightning-like flashes reflected on Jupiter ' s many moons , to shock_waves rippling the giant planet ' s thick atmosphere or minute temperature_changes caused by the massive release of energy . Some scientists have suggested that the comet would strike with more force than all_the nuclear_weapons on Earth combined . Shoemaker , an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Ariz. , discovered the comet this year with his wife , astronomer Carolyn Shoemaker , and colleague David H . Levy , an astronomer at the Palomar Observatory . &quot; I had a real emotional attachment to this comet , &quot; said Carolyn Shoemaker . &quot; All this time it has been such an object of beauty to me . I have to admit that I had a momentary tear when I realized the ( impact ) had happened. &quot; Amateur and professional sky-watchers have been riveted for months by the prospect of the collision because it is the first time people have discovered a celestial object and then been able to predict its impact on a planet accurately any more_than a_few seconds in_advance . More important , perhaps , it also is the first time humans have seen a comet collide_with a planet . Scientists are excited at the prospect of gaining any insights they can into the kinds of collisions that have left their mark on every planet and moon in the solar_system . &quot; We are very fortunate to be part of this suicidal comet experience , &quot; said Donald K . Yeomans , a comet expert at Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena . &quot; This is a chance to take a quantum leap forward in our understanding of what a comet is. &quot; Until Saturday , scientists were not sure whether the Shoemaker-Levy comet would cause the kind of cataclysm that may have destroyed the dinosaurs on Earth 65 million years ago or just a cosmic fizzle , of interest only to dedicated comet watchers . &quot; Well , it looks_like this comet was not a dud , &quot; said Hal Weaver , an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore . Jupiter -- a ball of frozen and compressed helium and hydrogen 300 times more massive than the Earth -- is so large that scientists expect it to easily absorb the comet ' s energy . They expect no consequences to Earth , which will be more_than 400 million miles away from Jupiter during the impacts . * Times Link : 808-8463 To commemorate humankind ' s first_steps on the moon 25 years ago Wednesday , TimesLink features historic audio clips beginning in 1961 with President John F .
