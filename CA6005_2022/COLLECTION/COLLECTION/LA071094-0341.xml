   <HEADLINE> DEATH_PENALTY UNLIKELY FOR SIMPSON , EXPERTS SAY ; TRIAL : COMBINATION OF FACTORS ARE CITED , INCLUDING THE FACT THAT SPOUSAL MURDER CASES RARELY DRAW CAPITAL_PUNISHMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The odds are high that the Los Angeles district_attorney ' s office will not seek the death_penalty against O.J. Simpson , according to prosecutors , criminal defense_lawyers and other death_penalty specialists . The legal_experts offer a variety of reasons for their prediction , even though Simpson is among the group most likely to be charged with capital murder and sentenced to death -- African Americans accused of killing whites . There are many reasons why he likely will be an exception : He does not have a lengthy criminal history . He has been a national hero . It has become increasingly difficult for prosecutors to obtain the death_penalty in Los Angeles County . Seeking the death_penalty might make_it more difficult to garner a conviction . His execution would leave two young children of one of the victims without a parent . And , finally , the death_penalty is rarely imposed in spousal murders . Indeed , of the 2 # 812 men on Death Row nationwide , only 34 , or 1.2 % , killed their wives or ex-wives . Although he declined to speak directly on the Simpson case , veteran prosecutor Frank E . Sundstedt , who chairs the special death_penalty committee in the district_attorney ' s office , said the office is mindful of that statistical reality . &quot; It is very difficult to obtain a first-degree murder_conviction in any domestic violence case , &quot; Sundstedt said . &quot; To the extent that you need some basis for a ' special circumstance ' in_order to have the defendant eligible for the death_penalty , that has to be taken into consideration , &quot; he said . State law is explicit about which murders are so horrifying that a jury can consider the death_penalty . There are 19 such &quot; special circumstances , &quot; including the murders of a police_officer or firefighter , murder for financial_gain , murder by bomb -- and multiple murders , as charged in the Simpson case . In order to receive the death sentence , Simpson must be convicted of at least one count of first-degree murder , meaning that it was premeditated . The jury also would have to confirm the special circumstance allegation . Even if he were convicted of the slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald L . Goldman -- many attorneys stressed that it would be rare for the death_penalty to be imposed on Simpson , a nationally known figure who for years has been held_in high public esteem . &quot; I can ' t think_of anyone so beloved who has faced the death_penalty , &quot; said Santa Monica defense_lawyer Gigi Gordon , who specializes in capital cases . &quot; We feel most comfortable sentencing someone to death when we can reduce their whole life to a single act of brutal violence , &quot; and that simply would not happen with the former Heisman Trophy-winning USC tailback , said Bryan Stevenson , director of the Alabama Capital Representation Resource Center . &quot; When you ' re forced to see the defendant as something more_than the criminal act , it becomes much harder to say , ' We ' re going to kill you. ' O.J. Simpson has the advantage of being known for something other_than allegedly killing his wife and another person . The other things he is known for are very human things , very endearing things , the kind of things that would you make feel loss or sorrow if he were dead , &quot; Stevenson said . &quot; There is no way that a jury is going_to return a death judgment against O.J. Simpson , &quot; said defense_lawyer Barry Levin , a former Los Angeles police_officer who has handled nine capital cases . &quot; Having had a substantial amount of experience in this area , what it boils_down to is the only way a jury will kill your client is if he is a complete animal , they hate him. &quot; On several occasions , Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti has asserted that Simpson ' s popularity will make_it more difficult to obtain a conviction . Moreover , Simpson ' s life_history would be a very real factor_in any assessment of whether the death_penalty should be imposed against him , if he were convicted of first-degree murder . On Friday , after Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell bound Simpson over for trial , Garcetti said one of the first decisions his office has to make is whether to seek the death_penalty . Unlike most cases , Garcetti will be involved in the decision-making process in the Simpson case . That process promises to be a veritable minefield for him , said Loyola law_school professor Laurie Levenson . &quot; If he doesn ' t ask_for the death_penalty , there will be a clamor that this is special treatment for a celebrity . But if he does , there will be the traditional claims that it is arbitrary . . . used against people of a particular race . Either way , there ' s going_to be criticism. &quot; He faces a formidable critic in Los Angeles defense_lawyer Leslie Abramson , a vocal opponent of the death_penalty who represents Erik Menendez , 23 , one of the two brothers who have admitted shotgunning their parents to death in their Beverly Hills home_in 1989 . Separate Van Nuys juries deadlocked in January between murder and lesser manslaughter charges against Erik Menendez and his brother Lyle , 26 . The district_attorney ' s office has said it will retry both brothers and is still seeking the death_penalty against them . &quot; I don ' t want the district_attorney ' s office to ask_for the death_penalty against O.J. Simpson -- I am personally very sympathetic to him -- but if they don ' t , I will make them come_into court and explain why they are trying to kill the abused Menendez boys , &quot; Abramson said . The Simpson situation is particularly tricky because of the current stance of the prosecutors and his lawyers , said Los Angeles defense_lawyer Bradley W . Brunon . &quot; The defense is maintaining Simpson didn ' t do_it . The prosecution is maintaining that he did_it in a very calculated manner. &quot; As a consequence , Brunon said , he thought it was possible that the district_attorney ' s office might initially ask_for the death_penalty but ultimately reverse field , after further evidence about the case unfolds . &quot; They could change their mind gracefully and go_for life without possibility of parole or a straight life sentence , &quot; Brunon said . But most death_penalty specialists said they believed that Garcetti simply will not opt_for the death_penalty at any time . For strategic reasons , it might be easier to secure a conviction if jurors do not have to consider the &quot; specter &quot; of the death_penalty , UCLA criminal_law professor Peter Arenella said . As it stands now , the Simpson case &quot; is a domestic homicide case and sadly not an uncommon one , &quot; said Stanford_University criminal_law professor Robert Weisberg . And in the overwhelming number of such cases , it is difficult to obtain the first-degree murder_conviction that is a prerequisite for the death_penalty , Weisberg said . Normally , he said , the only exceptions are when one spouse kills another to try to profit from an insurance_policy or when one spouse hires a hit_man to murder a mate . Beverly Hills defense_lawyer Jeffrey R . Brodey said his own experience in recent years shows how unusual it would be for the district_attorney ' s office to seek death in the Simpson case . Brodey said he has represented six people accused of double murders ; in five of the six cases , the prosecutor sought death . The only time the district_attorney ' s office didn ' t go_for the ultimate penalty was a case of a man murdering his wife and her lover , Brodey said . &quot; He went_into his wife ' s place_of_business and shot her . Then he walked down the street a short way and went_into the ( lover ' s ) business and shot him. &quot; Without any persuasion from him , the district_attorney ' s office decided against seeking the death_penalty , and Brodey said the fact that it was a spousal homicide was the critical factor . &quot; They said from the beginning this is not a death case. &quot; Rather , the prosecutor sought life without possibility of parole . Brodey argued that his client acted in the heat of passion when he shot his wife and that he &quot; was still in the grips of rage , &quot; when he shot the lover . The jury returned two verdicts of second-degree murder and Brodey ' s client received a sentence of 20 years to life . Moreover , several defense_lawyers said they had represented defendants in multiple homicides in Los Angeles where the district_attorney ' s office did not seek death . They said Garcetti could present numerous such examples if he is accused of giving Simpson special treatment . &quot; I don ' t think it would be favoritism &quot; for a celebrity if Garcetti asked_for life in this case , Gordon said . &quot; The death_penalty is reserved for the worst of the worst . What the general public doesn ' t understand is there is a hierarchy of murderers -- people who kill police_officers , serial_murderers , child killers . The death_penalty has to be reserved for those people. &quot; The way to San Quentin starts with Section 190.2 of the California Penal Code . Though the law sets_forth the 19 explicit special circumstances that can justify the death_penalty , it actually is not explicit enough . It does not say , for instance , that conviction for multiple murder must lead to execution -- only that it may . Because capital cases are far more expensive than ordinary murder trials , the law thus presents prosecutors in each of the state ' s 58 counties with a dilemma . They must do what the law does not -- decide which cases deserve the death_penalty . As could be expected , guidelines and practices vary from county to county . In San Diego County , for example , Dist . Atty . Edwin L . Miller Jr . decides when to pursue the death_penalty . So does Arlo Smith , the district_attorney of San Francisco . In Los Angeles County , it used to be that one man also made the decision -- Curt Livesay , who was a senior prosecutor under former Dist . Atty . Ira Reiner and others . Near the end of Reiner ' s term , Greg Thompson , another veteran deputy , took_over the job . Garcetti , however , who took_office in December , 1992 , has opted for a different system . Each Thursday morning , in a conference_room on the 18th floor of the Downtown Criminal_Courts Building , eight veteran prosecutors -- an all-white , all-male group since its lone woman member became a federal judge -- review those murder cases headed for trial . The first issue is whether special circumstances are still appropriate . If so , the next decision is whether to pursue a penalty of death or life in prison . Seven of the eight weigh in with comments . Then , as before , one person makes the decision -- Sundstedt , the head of the committee . The input is &quot; exceedingly helpful , &quot; Sundstedt said . But he added , &quot; It is not a vote. &quot; A case comes_to the committee after several steps_up the organizational ladder . The trial deputies -- in the Simpson case , Marcia Clark and William Hodgman -- will write an internal memorandum that sets_forth the facts , analyzes the law and urges the committee to choose either life or death . Various supervisors will review that memo . Two weeks before the committee meets , the defense is invited to supply in writing any information it wishes to provide . On Friday , Garcetti said that Simpson ' s attorneys will be afforded the chance to submit mitigating material . Usually , Sundstedt said , committee_members are unanimous in their opinions . But debate is often spirited , he said . Once the decision is made to opt_for death , Sundstedt said , that is it -- although presumably , in this case , Garcetti will have the last word . Only once have defense_lawyers been granted an appeal of that decision , and that was just a_few days before jury selection began last year in the Menendez case . That appeal was unsuccessful . Sundstedt said he felt obligated to meet with the Menendez defense_lawyers because they had not otherwise had the opportunity to submit material to the committee . &quot; They were not given special treatment because of the Menendez case , &quot; he said . &quot; It was just a timing deal. &quot; Because far more homicides occur in Los Angeles County than anywhere else in California , Sundstedt said , the committee is kept busy , usually reviewing two , sometimes three or four cases each week . In 1993 , he said , the committee looked_at 200 cases . It opted to pursue the death_penalty in 35 , about 17 % . Since not all_of those 35 cases have been completed , it remains to be seen how many death verdicts will be returned . Charles A . Gessler , a veteran Los Angeles County deputy public_defender , estimated that juries come_back with a death verdict in only about 10 % of the cases . The overwhelming majority of such cases involve those in which the victim is a stranger , or at least someone who does not have a long , emotional involvement with the killer , because jurors find such cases frightening , Stanford ' s Weisberg said . In Orange County , where prosecutors also use a committee system , the panel reviewed 20 cases last year . It opted to pursue the death_penalty in two , said Deputy Dist . Atty . Rick King , who heads the homicide unit . In Alameda County , where Dist . Atty . John J . Meehan heads the committee , the panel looked last year at 10 cases . It opted to ask_for death in three , said Assistant Dist . Atty . Jim Anderson . Obviously , the figures in Los Angeles County far exceed anywhere in the state -- and , according to the state_Department of Corrections , there are more murderers among the 383 inmates on Death Row from Los Angeles County than anywhere else , 112 . The runner-up is Alameda County : 29 . But , Sundstedt said : &quot; I don ' t believe that the office willy-nilly seeks the death_penalty on defendants in Los Angeles County. &quot; The committee , he said , actually is opting to pursue death far less often than during the Reiner years . In the three years before Garcetti took_over , Sundstedt said , Los Angeles prosecutors asked_for death an average of 53 times per year . Through July 1 of this year , Sundstedt said , the committee has reviewed 86 cases and opted to ask_for death 11 times . The 11 cases , according to Sundstedt , include allegations of murder by arson , the kidnap murder of a child , the killing of a mother and daughter , the murder of two police_officers -- and several cases involving allegations of multiple murder . &quot; Far and away &quot; the largest category of death_penalty cases , Sundstedt said , are robbery-murders . Next , he said , are multiple murders . &quot; I would think multiple homicides is one of the considerations that most often justifies seeking the death_penalty and it is one of the ones most persuasive to juries , &quot; said Dane Gillette , head of the state_attorney general ' s death_penalty unit . &quot; When you have more_than one body , that makes a difference in how the case is charged , how it is tried and how it is viewed if they go_to a penalty phase. &quot; While compelling , that factor alone , however , is not enough . The reality , several prosecutors said , is that there is no magic formula for deciding that it ' s right to give a jury the option of choosing death . &quot; Obviously you have to have some way of differentiating , and it is difficult , because every murder involves the death of a human_being , &quot; Sundstedt said . &quot; But the fact remains : every robbery-murder is not a death case. &quot; &quot; I ' m afraid it ' s a bit like pornography , &quot; said Michael Tranbarger , an assistant Los Angeles district_attorney and one of the eight on the committee . &quot; It ' s hard to describe , but I know it when I see it. &quot; If a crime seems particularly vicious , prosecutors consider that a significant aggravating factor . The age and what several prosecutors called the &quot; quality &quot; of the victim also play a critical role . &quot; The victim is a most important thing , &quot; said Los Angeles Deputy Dist . Atty . Peter Bozanich , who also is a member of the committee . &quot; If you ' ve got children , watch_out -- the jury really wants a piece of that guy . . . . If it ' s a drug dealer , the jury thinks , ' Ah , he ' s got_it coming , ' which is really logical. &quot; Nicole Simpson was the mother of two small children and her friend , Goldman , was a waiter at a trendy Brentwood restaurant . In the normal sense of how these cases are evaluated , attorneys made plain , they would be considered &quot; high-quality victims. &quot; Also critical , prosecutors said , is the defendant ' s background . A particularly violent past tends to tip the scale toward seeking the death_penalty . &quot; Let ' s say you ' ve got a 35-year-old defendant with a long and sordid past , &quot; said another assistant Los Angeles district_attorney on the committee , R . Dan Murphy . &quot; This guy has had 20 years to learn and he still hasn ' t gotten_it right. &quot; O.J. Simpson , of course , has only the single blemish on his record , the 1989 no contest plea in Municipal Court to charges he beat his wife . It just seems improbable that Simpson could face the death_penalty , said a member of the committee who asked to remain unnamed . &quot; Other_than this incident , &quot; the committee_member said , referring to the slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L . Goldman , &quot; there ' s a perception that he ' s had an exemplary life . Never underestimate the power of perceptions. &quot; Death_Penalty Panel These are the eight members of the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s Special Circumstances Committee . All are veteran prosecutors who decide whether the office will pursue the death_penalty in murder cases . Review of the O.J. Simpson case is still weeks away . When the committee takes_up the_matter , one member , William Hodgman , will not take_part because he is a prosecutor on the case . However , in an unusual move , Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti will take_part in the decision . * FRANK E . SUNDSTEDT , 47 , is an assistant district_attorney . It is ultimately his responsibility to make the committee ' s decision . * PETER BOZANICH , 50 , is one of two directors of branch offices , supervising branches in the Antelope Valley , Long_Beach , Santa Monica , Compton , San Fernando and Torrance . * ROGER J . GUNSON , 54 , is one of two directors of special operations . He is in_charge of appeals , major fraud and organized crime divisions . * ROBERT F . KUHNERT , 52 , is the other director of special operations . He supervises the prosecution of cases involving reputed gang members as well as those involving public corruption . * PHILLIPS W . MUELLER , 55 , is the other branch director , supervising offices in Norwalk , Pomona , Pasadena and Van Nuys . * R . DAN MURPHY , 49 , is an assistant district_attorney and oversees all specialized prosecution units , including the gang , major fraud , organized crime and consumer units . * MICHAEL TRANBARGER , 48 , is also an assistant district_attorney and oversees office management and budgets as well as such units as crime prevention and victim services .
