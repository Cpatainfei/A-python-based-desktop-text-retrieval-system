   <HEADLINE> NOVEL CITED BY CHAN OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD , TEACHERS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The award-winning novel Robert Chan blames for his brutal slaying of a fellow honor student is widely read but often misunderstood by bright young people , Orange County educators said Monday . Albert Camus ' &quot; The Stranger , &quot; a 123-page book with simple language and straightforward narrative covering complex , dense philosophical concepts , commonly serves as an introduction to existentialism for high_school and college_students . It is routinely among the first French novels assigned to students of the language , while others read English translations in advanced high_school or beginning college courses in literature or philosophy . Chan , 19 , was sentenced Monday to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the New Year ' s Eve , 1992 , slaying of Stuart A . Tay . He said in court papers that he read &quot; The Stranger &quot; nine months before killing Tay and determined that &quot; everything was meaningless and nothing matters because we are all going_to die. &quot; The book ' s narrator , Meursault , shows indifference to his mother ' s death , kills a stranger and remains unmoved by his own impending decapitation . The story expresses the existential philosophy that there are no objective values , only rules people make_for themselves . Camus , a Frenchman from Algiers who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1957 , published half_a_dozen novels , two volumes of &quot; Notebooks , &quot; a trilogy of plays and a book of essays before his death in 1960 . But his most famous work was his first , &quot; The Stranger. &quot; The Cure , a rock_band both Chan and Tay loved , even based the 1979 song &quot; Killing An Arab &quot; on the novel . &quot; Bright students who are introduced to existential ideas are often fascinated by them . That is not unusual , &quot; said Joan Kasper , a Foothill High English_teacher who had Tay as a student several years ago . &quot; The extent of the fascination and the duration of the fascination depends_on the individual student. &quot; &quot; ' The Stranger , ' &quot; Kasper added , is &quot; a difficult book to understand. &quot; Published in 1946 , the story is set_in Algiers and told in two parts . The first is an 18-day chronicle in which Meursault , an insignificant French clerk , attends his mother ' s funeral , has a love_affair and kills an Arab on a beach . The second section is a yearlong chronicle of Meursault ' s time in jail , his trial and his ultimate execution . Perhaps most famous is the novel ' s opening_lines : &quot; Mother died today . Or , maybe , yesterday ; I can ' t be sure. &quot; The matter-of-fact narrator continues to move through what seems a meaningless life , enjoying physical pleasures such_as swimming , smoking and sex , but seeing little purpose in people ' s actions . &quot; The ideas that Camus tries to exhibit in his literature is that human_beings are in the strange position of being valuing and purposeful creatures , but they find themselves in a world where reality has no match for this -- there aren ' t purposes in the world , &quot; explained Amy Thomasson , a philosopher who is teaching a course on existentialism at UCI this summer . &quot; There isn ' t meaning in the world , there isn ' t value in the world ; that ' s the awkward situation of humanity according to Camus , &quot; Thomasson said . &quot; He argues that there is no intrinsic meaning in the world apart from what human_beings project onto it. &quot; The book ' s climax comes during a seaside holiday , when Meursault encounters the Arab and determines that it does not matter whether he fires the revolver he is holding . Later , almost by accident , he kills the man , then pumps four more bullets into his corpse . In jail for 11 months , Meursault misses smoking and sex but is not absolutely unhappy . He admits the murder , but the judge and jury are more upset with his indifference to his mother ' s death , and thus sentence him to decapitation in a public place . Meursault decides that life is profoundly absurd , and faces his death in peace . Matthew Potolsky , a UCI instructor in comparative_literature , said &quot; The Stranger &quot; is famous for its exploration of &quot; the gratuitous act. &quot; &quot; If there ' s no meaning in the world then this one act can just sort of occur , &quot; Potolsky explained . Meursault &quot; just accepts the consequences of that act , he doesn ' t really feel remorse , he doesn ' t rue the fact that he did_it . . . . He doesn ' t feel he acted wrongly because the act had no meaning. &quot; According to letters Chan wrote the court and the Tay family before his sentencing , his reading of Camus in March , 1992 , led him down a trail of deterioration that ended in Tay ' s death . Chan said he stopped brushing his teeth , abandoned socks and tried wearing the same clothes for a week to see if anyone noticed . No one did . But unlike Meursault , Chan said he does feel remorse for the murder . &quot; My shame and guilt will never cease to torment me , &quot; Chan wrote . &quot; As I talked to my family , I felt their incredible grief and sorrow overwhelmingly in waves and pressing_down upon my conscience with an unbearable weight . . . . My heart was truly broken when my mother cried in front of me . I could not face her. &quot; Times staff writer Matt Lait contributed to this report .</TEXT>
