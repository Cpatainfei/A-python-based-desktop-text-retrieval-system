   <TEXT> A surprising proposal by Enron Corp . to produce photovoltaic electric_power for a quarter of the cost of existing technologies has refocused attention on the steadily improving solar_cell . After more_than 15 years of development , photovoltaic_cells are commonplace on hand-held calculators , satellites and in remote locations . But photovoltaic energy will have to be as cheap or cheaper than the 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour that Enron aims to achieve if it is to reach the larger ambition of its proponents -- to carve out a major role as a utility-size power generator . &quot; Time is_on our side . A lot of people will be using it in the future , &quot; says Richard King , program manager for photovoltaic research at the Department_of_Energy . But in the meantime , King says , &quot; there is the chicken-and-egg problem. &quot; As long as it costs 25 cents a kilowatt-hour for solar_cells to make energy -- compared to 3.5 to 4.5 cents for the newest generation of natural_gas turbines -- utilities and their government regulators will remain reluctant to support large-scale generating arrays . Yet proponents say that the economies of scale from big installations would be a major factor_in bringing costs down . &quot; It ' s a cottage industry , &quot; King says , &quot; and you have to lift it out of that. &quot; that ' s why the solar_power world is abuzz over the Enron proposal . The Houston-based energy giant has proposed to build a 100-megawatt plant at the Department_of_Energy ' s Nevada test site near Las Vegas -- huge by photovoltaic industry standards . And it says it can do so without research and development subsidies , though it does want a DOE contract to buy the power at the 5.5-cent price and tax-free bonds to help finance construction . Enron , which just completed a mammoth 1 # 875-megawatt natural_gas generating plant in England , would invest $ 150-million in the project , with an eye to exporting the technology to the energy-hungry developing world . One measure of the impact of such a plant : Only 7 megawatts of photovoltaic electricity are now being fed into utility power_lines worldwide . Almost no one questions the technology itself anymore . The first solar_cells were 6 % efficient -- that is , they converted to electricity 6 % of the sunlight that fell on them . ( The other solar technology , thermal , focuses the heat of the sun on water , oil or liquid salt , which in turn powers electricity-generating turbines. ) Today , standard photovoltaic_cells are 12 % to 14 % efficient . Last week , the Electric_Power Research Institute , which manages research for the nation ' s electric utilities , announced that Amonix Inc. of Torrance has a solar_cell system that is more_than 20 % efficient . In the lab , experimental cells have reached 30 % . Once in place , solar_panels have proven to be largely maintenance-free for two decades or more -- and , of course , there are no fuel costs . While Enron declines to give details of its cost-cutting technology , Kelly said the company ' s plan exploits economies of scale as well as improvements in the non-solar-cell parts of the system . But it would also involve one of the most widely watched research paths : development of so-called thin-film cells . The most common photovoltaic technology uses crystalline silicon . The material must be expensively treated and formed into glass-hard ingots , which are then sliced with diamond saws and individually wired into a panel . These cells are the most efficient so far but are labor-intensive to produce and waste 20 % of the ingot material in the cutting . With thin-film technology , a very thin layer of the photovoltaic substance is usually sprayed directly on a glass panel , a procedure easily performed in an automated factory . So far , thin-film panels are no more_than 6 % to 10 % efficient . Another approach , called spherical cell technology , has reached 10 % efficiency as well . &quot; But thin film is certainly the technology that a lot of people feel holds the ultimate hope for less cost . . . . It just uses a whale of a lot less material , &quot; says Jim Birk , EPRI manager of renewables and hydro . While utility-scale solar_arrays are still not here , a_few utilities are already finding uses for photovoltaic power . The Sacramento Municipal Utility District now gets 2.6 megawatts of its total 844-megawatt load from photovoltaic facilities , including the world ' s largest existing plant -- a 2-megawatt array at Rancho Seco , 30 miles from Sacramento . Through Southern California Edison , customers who want lights in their mountain cabins without paying to bring_in power_lines can now lease solar_cell systems set_up and maintained by the utility . Edison also recently set_up solar_panels at a neighborhood school in South Pasadena . The new power will augment existing lines in the area , which have reached capacity . The photovoltaic array is cost-effective compared to the disruption and expense of tearing_up the streets to put_in larger wires . The idea is called distributed generation , and many proponents see it as the answer to the power demands of developing nations lacking their own fossil_fuels or a way to avoid the high cost of national transmission grids like those in industrialized countries .</TEXT>
