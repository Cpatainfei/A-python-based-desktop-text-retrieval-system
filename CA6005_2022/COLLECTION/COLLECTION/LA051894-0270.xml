   <HEADLINE> GERMAN MEDIA GIVE BROAD , TEMPERED COVERAGE TO CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The attack on two German tourists in California was widely reported in the news media here , but the tone of the reports was moderate . The television_news show &quot; Heute &quot; remarked Tuesday that just last week a group of Norwegian tourists was attacked in Florida , suggesting that this sort of thing could happen to a tourist from anywhere , and that Germans should not feel singled_out . Some journalists here pointed_out that this was the first attack on German tourists outside a crime-ridden urban setting . At Frankfurt-based DER Tours , one of the biggest German travel_agencies offering trips to North_America , spokeswoman Antje Zimmermann said her organization has so far had no client reaction to the California attack . &quot; Yes , we will go_on recommending California to our customers , &quot; she said . California is widely seen among German tourists as the state that epitomizes the American way_of_life . Tourists who want to sample America and its culture tend to favor California . Florida , by contrast , has until lately been the destination of choice among Germans who primarily want to lie on the beach . Florida is seen as similar to Spain , but more exotic and chic . Zimmermann said her organization ' s business in Florida declined 30 % from 1992 to 1993 because of the violence against tourists in that state . Since December , 1992 , six German travelers have been killed in the United States ( the California victim was the sixth ) , and the first four of these victims died in Florida . The fifth was a German soldier shot in New Orleans . In recent years , about 40 % of the German tourists traveling_to America have gone_to Florida . Zimmermann added that at_the_same_time the Florida business was falling_off , tours booked through her company to the rest of the United States increased by 5 % . Zimmermann said that the Germans who were attacked in California had not bought a package tour , but had written their own itinerary , and that this posed special problems for German travel_agents . When customers book package tours to Florida , she said , her organization routinely gives them instructions on how to remain inconspicuous , stay safe in rental cars and avoid dangerous areas .</TEXT>
