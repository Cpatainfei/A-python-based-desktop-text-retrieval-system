   <HEADLINE> GEORGE RAMOS : PROP . 187 FOES GET A BOOST FROM AN UNLIKELY ALLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ernie Gustafson is the last guy I would have expected to oppose Proposition 187 , the so-called Save Our State initiative on the Nov . 8 ballot , because he ' s no bleeding-heart liberal . A rock-ribbed conservative , he put_in nearly 33 years in the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service , chasing_after border jumpers from the Rio Grande to L.A. He rose through the ranks , becoming the district director for INS_operations here and in Phoenix . He stood shoulder to shoulder with Harold Ezell , the controversial INS regional head during the Reagan years and a co-author of Proposition 187 , which would deny education and health benefits to illegal immigrants . When he retired in 1989 from la migra , Gustafson had warred with just about every Latino activist and politician in L.A. who thought him a tool of a racist bureaucracy intent_on deporting all foreign-looking people . So why is he opposing Proposition 187 ? &quot; It ' s a bandage approach to a major problem , &quot; he explained , &quot; dreamed_up by politicians and wanna-bes with rose-colored glasses . It ' s a political opportunity for these people . It will solve nothing . It will take the innocence of children and make them the scapegoats of a failed policy. &quot; * Gustafson is different from most who oppose Proposition 187 . He is a non-Latino who is intimately familiar_with the immigration problem . While district director in L.A. , he never shared Ezell ' s affinity for cameras and microphones , but he echoed his boss ' s demand for control of this country ' s borders . Many grudgingly admired Gustafson because of his folksy desire to put a human_face on the immigration service . He has gained legions of fans who listen to his weekly Spanish radio show , on which he answers questions about immigration policy and procedures . When I heard of his opposition , I was surprised . When I went_to see him the other day , he was as I remembered him -- direct , plain-spoken and yet passionate . He slams Ezell , Gov . Pete Wilson , former INS Commissioner Alan Nelson -- who support Proposition 187 -- as opportunists who have used immigration to gain favor with voters . Gustafson is particularly critical of Wilson , who as a U.S. senator in 1988 complained that the INS was too quick to deport illegal immigrants . &quot; Now , in 1994 , he thinks we don ' t deport them quick enough , &quot; Gustafson says . He rejects the argument that illegals are a drain on California taxpayers . &quot; The vast majority who come here are not coming for any benefits , &quot; he argues , &quot; unless you call living a benefit . They ' re not coming here to go_on welfare . They ' re not coming here to go_on food_stamps . They ' re coming here to work. &quot; His prescription for fighting illegal immigration is twofold . First , he says , a beefed-up Border_Patrol , not the U.S. military , is the proper agency to deal with the border . Second , federal agencies , including the INS , should streamline their rules governing legal immigration . For example , Gustafson says , more_than 3 million illegal immigrants nationwide qualified for amnesty under the landmark 1987 legalization law . But the government has been slow to allow relatives of these people to come_to this country . Unwilling to wait years for the necessary paperwork , these relatives enter illegally . &quot; It makes_sense to me , &quot; he says . &quot; The wife and the kids come because the father , as the qualified alien , is already here . They don ' t want to wait. &quot; But wait a minute . &quot; You were part of amnesty , &quot; I told him . &quot; I implemented the ( amnesty ) policy , &quot; he replied evenly . &quot; I implemented it with fairness and openness . More_than a_million applied for amnesty in Los Angeles . I think I did a good job. &quot; What he didn ' t say is that Ezell , Nelson and others left the INS after their political appointments were up , leaving Gustafson and other career managers in the understaffed agency to grapple with amnesty and other programs . Now , it seems Gustafson ' s former friends have found new energy to get_at illegal immigration in another way -- Proposition 187 . * It will be quite a sight when Gustafson joins his onetime enemies , the Latino immigrant-rights advocates and civil libertarians , at an anti-Proposition 187 march scheduled for Oct . 16 in Downtown L.A. &quot; I can ' t believe Gustafson is going_to be with us , &quot; says one Latina activist . I can ' t either . Gustafson doesn ' t care if Ezell -- with whom he sang in a trio to promote amnesty -- disapproves . &quot; I ' ve deported Ezell from trio amnistia , &quot; he barks .</TEXT>
