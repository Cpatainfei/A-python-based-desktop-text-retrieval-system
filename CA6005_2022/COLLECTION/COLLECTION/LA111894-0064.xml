   <HEADLINE> MEET THE MASTERS OF A NEW UNIVERSE ; TRENDS : MEN , IT SEEMS , ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM THE PLEASURES OF LAUNDRY . THEY , TOO , HAVE DISCOVERED THE SPIRITUAL BENEFITS OF SORTING , WASHING AND FOLDING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a world of cheap pleasures , it is among the cheapest . Certainly , it is the cleanest . From the fluttery anticipation of the pre-wash to the peaceful smoothing of soft , warm wrinkles , the rituals of laundry can be enormously satisfying . What other task in life offers such immediate and gratifying results ? Dingy is made bright . Sour is made sweet . Chaos is ordered -- or at least sorted_out by color . Forget missing socks and sweaters that shrink . If taken seriously , laundry need not be drudgery . It can be spiritual , indulgent , even personally empowering -- in a ' 90s unisex dual-career sort of way . Is it any wonder then that more men are doing_it -- and loving it ? Although women still do the bulk of the nation ' s wash -- 20 million women do laundry every day of the year compared to only 8 million men -- the 1994 Wisk Cleaning Census shows men are beginning to close the gap . But it is the attitude men bring_to the laundry room that most distinguishes washermen from washerwomen . The survey found that men were more likely to relax while doing laundry by taking breaks &quot; to nap or cuddle up with someone you love. &quot; Women were more likely to pass the time cooking , cleaning or ironing . In a day when domesticity has never been less fashionable for women , the survey suggests that it may just be coming_into vogue for men . * Ask Bernie Roswig about why he does the household laundry and the Los Angeles public relations executive swells with pride . &quot; I just have a feeling I do_it better than anybody I know. &quot; ( Although he rarely speaks_of it publicly , Roswig , 52 , also derives special pleasure from pulling the lint off the dryer filter . &quot; I always hope there ' s a lot of lint there so I can peel it off all_in one big piece . If there ' s any one part of the laundry process I look_forward to , it would definitely be that. &quot; ) As a child , the New York-born Roswig looked_forward to helping his mother bring the laundry in off the clothesline . &quot; We lived_in the snow belt but we always had clean clothes and they really were clean -- outdoors clean , sunshine fresh. &quot; Roswig takes his laundry seriously and , like 32 % of the men and 27 % of the women in Lever Brothers ' survey , he blames himself if something goes_wrong . &quot; I ' m not obsessive , &quot; Roswig says , &quot; but I do get aggrieved when I cannot remove all_the stains . So far , I ' ve been fortunate in that I ' ve never had anything really ugly happen. &quot; * That men can care deeply about laundry comes as no surprise to behavior experts . Several years ago , a landmark study by French social_scientist Jean-Claude Kaufmann found that while men may dislike discussing the topic , they have very strong feelings about clean clothes -- and missing socks . One couple interviewed by Kaufmann disagreed violently over the temperature that should be used for washing the family ' s clothes . He believed_in hot , she in tepid . &quot; He let her do the wash , fold , and iron . Then he would sort his clothes out and put them straight back into the machine at high_temperature , &quot; according to a British report on the Kaufmann study . The couple ' s future together , the scientist reported , was &quot; distinctly uncertain. &quot; Such soap_operas are unknown in the suburban Chicago home of Pat and Dennis Arkis . When the hulking amateur weightlifter , former Navy SEAL and retired police_officer proposed to Pat , it was with one caveat : &quot; I told her no way could she ever touch the wash . The laundry is my domain. &quot; That strict division of labor has made_for a very happy marriage , say the Arkises , even when Dennis was doing the entire wash for the family of six . &quot; Women ' s work ? No way , &quot; he says . &quot; So far as my masculinity is concerned , I ' ve heard some talk but this is something I take_pride in . No way am I going_to apologize to anybody for doing the laundry. &quot; Arkis , 50 , spends his &quot; down time &quot; in the basement laundry room working_out . &quot; I have a mini-gym there by the washer and dryer . I ' ll throw my laundry in , then go and push weights till it ' s done. &quot; Arkis ' routine washes with recent findings that men experience the laundry process differently -- and in some ways , more positively -- that women do . And , according to Lever Brothers pollsters , men seem to be doing more laundry than ever . Of 1 # 035 adults surveyed , 38 % of men report spending four or more hours a week laundering , compared to 57 % of women . And while commercials rarely show men doing the laundry , nearly one-fifth of American males are washing at least seven loads a week , according to the survey . &quot; The image of men as laundry-impaired is losing its viability , &quot; says Lever Brothers spokesman Kenneth Hooper . &quot; In some cases , our study found , men were far more savvy than women about getting_out stains . Twenty-seven percent of men surveyed , for example , know clothes with perspiration stains are_best washed in hot water . Only 19 % of women knew that. &quot; Victor Gomez knew that . &quot; With sports and all , I ' m used to cleaning a lot of sweaty stuff , &quot; says the 23-year-old Cerritos College_student . Wednesday is wash day for Gomez . But if he didn ' t have to plunk two quarters into a machine for every load , every day would be wash day . &quot; I ' m only washing my own stuff but with different water temperatures and colors and all , I end_up with about four loads every time I go_down to the laundry room . If I had my own washer and dryer , wow , I ' d definitely do a lot more . I hate dirty clothes . I have actually had to not go_out at night , cancel like my whole social life , ' cause I didn ' t have anything clean to wear. &quot; Like many men , Gomez learned the basics of laundry from women -- in his case , two younger sisters . &quot; They didn ' t say , ' Oh , let me do your laundry. ' No , they said , ' Turn this dial here and don ' t wash red with anything but black. ' &quot; * Artist Lloyd Noonan , 36 , would rather push a vacuum cleaner than do the laundry . Still , the Culver City bachelor washes seven or eight loads per week . &quot; It ' s only me . I don ' t do anyone else ' s wash . But I always seem to have something to put_in the wash . . . . &quot; I work_out six days a week so I have to wash the workout clothes . I put tarps over things when I paint so I have to wash those . I change my sheets twice a week , of course , so I ' m always washing those . And then there are two towel loads per week , the underwear , the T-shirts. &quot; Noonan isn ' t surprised by the findings of the Clean Census . &quot; Yes , I ' m probably that one in five who does all_the laundry . But if you ' re a separator like I am , the loads can pile_up . Separating is very important to me . Always has been . I ' ve heard such horror stories about what happens when you don ' t separate the colors . I won ' t risk it . I won ' t . &quot; Of course , I can ' t remember last time I did a full load . Maybe I do like doing the laundry more_than I thought . . . . &quot;</TEXT>
