   <HEADLINE> CULTURE ; ROTHSCHILD : A DYNASTY DIVERSIFIED ; A MUSEUM EXHIBIT SHOWS THE CENTURIES-OLD BANKING FAMILY AS PROTOTYPE OF EUROPEAN UNITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When 20-year-old Meyer Amschel Rothschild set_up a coin exchange in this city ' s Jewish ghetto in the 1760s , an enterprise that would launch a family dynasty and turn the Rothschild name into a symbol of wealth and power , Germany was still a century away from unity and Europe had many fratricidal wars ahead of it . The Rothschild patriarch established the prototype of modern capitalism . Early on , he and the five sons he brought into his banking business grasped the need for rapid communications and good public relations , the value of diversified investments and vertical_integration . Most important , they understood that their market was not just the hundreds of sovereign principalities surrounding Frankfurt but all_of Europe and beyond . Meyer Amschel fought for Jewish civil_rights and never moved from Frankfurt ' s Jews ' Lane , but he certainly saw the wisdom in doing so and sent his sons out_to 19th-Century Europe ' s commercial capitals -- London , Paris , Vienna and Naples -- to expand the family_business . Naysayers of European unity today might do_well to visit &quot; The Rothschilds , &quot; an exhibit subtitled &quot; A European Family &quot; at Frankfurt ' s Jewish Museum , to see just how little is new in the idea of European economic integration and how long it has been in place . The Rothschild family_business transcended national borders and was , as Munich ' s Suddeutsche Zeitung concluded in a review of the exhibit , &quot; the first European banking multinational. &quot; Even today , the Rothschilds are influential players in European financial circles , though not at the level of a century ago . The banks , investment_companies and foundation that bear the family ' s name are grouped under Swiss-based holding_companies . Primary operations , still in the hands of Rothschild descendants , are based in London and Paris , with the_English branch under the command of Sir Evelyn de Rothschild , a staunch member of Britain ' s patrician society , and his cousin Jacob , who is more business-oriented , struggling to modernize the Rothschild businesses . The Rothschild Bank &quot; really seems like a boutique merchant_bank . Small , specialist , carries with it the weight of history . It is not as deal-driven as U.K. or American merchant_banks , &quot; said a London banker , speaking on condition of anonymity . &quot; It has a reputation for having well-placed contacts in the government , but even that is somewhat historical. &quot; The history of Europe in the 19th Century cannot be told without mentioning the Rothschilds . The family ' s story begins in the Jewish ghetto , where the Rothschild name comes from the sign_on the family ' s original home -- a Rotes Schild , or Red Shield . When Meyer Amschel was born in the Judengasse 250 years ago , it was a walled neighborhood with gates that were locked at nights , on Sundays and Roman_Catholic holidays to prevent Jews from leaving . Meyer Amschel set_up his coin business at_home in about 1764 , and five years later he acquired the title of court agent to the minor Court of Hesse-Hanau , which allowed him relatively free travel without all_of the levies normally applied to Jews . He diversified from the start , simultaneously selling antiques , buying bills_of_exchange and working as an agent procuring loans . With a penchant for innovation , Meyer Amschel set_up what amounted to a mail-order business in valuable coins . Wars generally offer capitalists opportunities for profit , and the conflicts of the late 18th Century were no exception for the Rothschilds . They financed troops of the Elector of Hanau , which fought with the_British against the United States ; Austria ' s Imperial Army in its wars with the_French ; and , later , British troops in the Napoleonic Wars . With their early war profits , the Rothschilds moved_into the Jewish community ' s highest tax_bracket and expanded their business into English cloth and groceries and the new trade_in state bonds . By the turn of the 19th Century , Meyer Amschel had several court agent titles , but modern states were replacing principalities throughout Europe , and with them a modern banking sector was developing . The family saw that it too had to move forward . In 1799 , Meyer Amschel ' s third son , Nathan , left Frankfurt for England , then the world ' s center of industry and trade . Nathan first moved to Manchester to set_up Rothschild Bros. , a wholesale company that bought cloth , had it dyed and printed and shipped it to his father ' s company and other customers on the Continent . Nathan Rothschild made big profits in the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars , circumventing the Continental blockade against trade between Britain and states under French rule . But as the blockade tightened , he abandoned the cloth trade_in favor of banking and stockbroking in London . He founded the London bank N.M. Rothschild &amp; Sons , and over the next decade , his brothers James , Salomon and Carl fanned across Europe to set_up branches in Paris , Vienna and Naples , respectively . The eldest brother , Amschel , eventually took_over Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild &amp; Soehne from his father in Frankfurt . Meyer Amschel believed that success lay_in unity . In 1810 , he formed a formal partnership with his five sons , called Mayer Amschel Rothschild &amp; Soehne , that was meant to promote the family over its individual members and to keep its wealth together as long as possible . The strict contract stipulated that the company could not be dissolved for 10 years , that each son was paid an allowance but otherwise all capital was to remain in the firm , and that no partner could make a deal without agreement from the others . It also excluded Meyer Amschel ' s five daughters and all daughters-in-law from any interest in the family firm or fortune . Meyer Amschel died two years later , leaving a family united in wealth and confidence , and on the threshold of becoming one of the most important in 19th-Century Europe . &quot; I never doubted that we would become Europe ' s richest_men , &quot; James , who had changed his name from Jakob after leaving Frankfurt , once wrote from Paris . The brothers maintained the family ' s Jewish tradition but also understood that it was a political disadvantage to overcome . They built palaces that they decorated in the style of the_French aristocracy , threw grand weddings that became media events and set lavish tables for Europe ' s high_society . Soon they petitioned the government of Austria to be made nobles -- Austria being the only country at the time that would give titles to Jews -- and in 1816 , with a considerable family fortune , they became the von Rothschilds . &quot; They realized it was important for moving_into the European upper_crust of society , &quot; said Annette Weber , curator of arts at the Jewish Museum . But the family ' s quick ascent from the Judengasse into Europe ' s elite made the Rothschilds a continuous target of anti-Semitism , which they sought to counter with charitable works and their own public relations campaigns . A lithograph of the five sons with the family motto integritas , concordia , industria was mass-produced and hung_in Rothschild banks , as well as distributed to clients . Over the next five years , the Rothschild Bank outdistanced its competition to become the leading_bank in Europe . It continued to profit in a highly competitive market for government_bonds while doing business with most of Europe ' s social elite . Part of the family ' s recipe for success was a fast and efficient family communication_system -- a prototype fax and computer_system , one might say , made_up of daily letters , a network of information agents throughout Britain and the Continent , and carrier_pigeons . Brother Salomon expanded the family_business to railroads in Austria at a time when many people still feared that the arrival of trains would stop cows from giving milk . From there , he moved_into ironworks , coal mining and locomotive production . The family entered into insurance and oil exploration and financed Britain ' s purchase of the Suez Canal . The Rothschilds increased their political contacts and involvement , with Nathan ' s son , Lionel , becoming the first Jewish member of the_British Parliament in 1858 . Frankfurt remained the family nucleus until Gulte Rothschild , mother of the five sons , died in 1849 at the age of 96 , still residing in the Judengasse . By the turn of the 20th Century , with no male heir in place , the family closed its Frankfurt bank and concentrated its interests in Britain and France , where today the family is headed , respectively , by Lord Jacob Rothschild and Baron Guy de Rothschild , who is nearly as renowned for wine as for banking . Today , Rothschild banks have branches in 20 countries and , once again , in Frankfurt , where the Paris bank opened a branch in 1988 . The Nazis managed to wipe_out most traces of the Rothschilds in Frankfurt , but at least one monument remains : the weekend villa of Mayer Carl Rothschild -- grandson of patriarch Meyer Amschel -- which now houses the city ' s Jewish Museum and its latest exhibit on the Rothschilds . &quot; Frankfurt is just now starting to recognize the Rothschild family as one of_our_own , &quot; Weber said . But in fact , as her exhibit shows , the Rothschilds belonged_to Europe .</TEXT>
