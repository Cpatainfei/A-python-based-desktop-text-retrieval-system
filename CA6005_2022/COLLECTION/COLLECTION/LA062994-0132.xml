   <HEADLINE> LOBBYISTS ' REPORTING LAW TIGHTENED ; ETHICS : LAWYERS OR THEIR CLIENTS WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE DATA . MOVE IS AN ATTEMPT TO BYPASS A RULING THAT ATTORNEYS CITED IN REFUSING TO REVEAL ACTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After nearly four years of delays , the Los Angeles City_Council on Tuesday refined a lobbying law so that more lawyers will have to report their attempts to influence city government , but most neighborhood groups and nonprofit organizations will not . The council unanimously passed the first substantial revisions in the city ' s lobbying law since it was passed in 1967 . The changes are designed to require the highest-paid advocates to report their activities and compensation to the city ' s Ethics Commission . &quot; The importance is that the public will know the forces that are attempting to affect the operation of city government , &quot; said Edwin Guthman , a member of the city ' s Ethics Commission . &quot; Somewhere around $ 10 million is spent a year , that we know about , to influence decisions at City_Hall , &quot; Guthman added . &quot; We think there is a lot more that we don ' t know about and this will help get_to that. &quot; Ethics Commission officials said the most important change in the law will be one that requires lawyers to report all their lobbying activities , either directly or through their clients . Although many lawyers reported their lobbying and compensation under the old law , others refused to file reports with the Ethics Commission . They said that filing the reports would violate their confidential relationship with their clients . They cited a 1970 Supreme Court ruling on the city ' s law that said lawyers did not have to disclose their lobbying efforts in &quot; quasi-judicial proceedings &quot; -- which was interpreted by some lawyers to include most hearings involving land-use permits . The new law seeks to circumvent that legal objection by requiring clients , rather than the lawyers , to report the lobbying . The Ethics Commission issues quarterly reports that show which clients paid lobbyists the most . &quot; We think this will overcome any legal challenge , &quot; said Ben Bycel , executive_director of the Ethics Commission . &quot; Now everyone is_on an even playing_field and everyone will have to report . It moves the illumination of lobbying activities up from an 80-watt light_bulb to a 200-watt light bulb. &quot; Lawyers who have objected to reporting requirements argued that disclosing how much they are paid does not serve the public . Benjamin M . Reznik , a lawyer who frequently represents clients in planning cases , said the reporting of lawyers ' fees can invade the privacy of clients . The public would know enough if lawyers simply reported whom they represented , he said . &quot; Everyone knows that I am there at City_Hall as a paid representative for someone , &quot; Reznik said . &quot; How much I am being paid is totally irrelevant. &quot; Despite the tighter requirements on lawyers , the revisions will lead to a net reduction in the number of reports filed with the Ethics Commission . That is because the council voted to only require lobbyists to file reports if they make more_than $ 4 # 000 a quarter for lobbying at City_Hall . About 80 lobbyists are expected to file reports under the new system , compared to the more_than 300 who file now . Many small groups and individuals who are paid little or nothing for their lobbying efforts will no longer file reports .</TEXT>
