   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; PRESIDENT SENDS MIXED SIGNALS TO U.S. , SERBS ; CONFLICT : CLINTON TALKS TOUGH TO REBELS EVEN AS HE REASSURES AMERICANS ON LIMITED INVOLVEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Standing on the verge of wider military involvement in the Bosnian war , President Clinton broadcast two deeply conflicting messages Friday : to the Serbs -- NATO means business ; to the American people -- no ground troops . Clinton ' s statements , repeated several times in a news_conference , underscore the conflict at the center of U.S. policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina . Clinton is willing to use force to try to bring the Serbs back to the negotiating table , but only to a point . The Administration ' s policy is defined not so_much by its objectives as by its limits . The President and his aides were cheered by reports that Bosnian Serb forces had agreed to a cease-fire around the Muslim enclave of Gorazde in response to NATO ' s demand for a demilitarized zone there . But U.S. officials have made this much clear : If the Serbs defy the United Nations and the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , as they have frequently in recent weeks , and if the cost of punishing them becomes too high , Clinton would be willing to halt the operation and accept a failure rather than be drawn more deeply into the conflict . While the President has refused to say so explicitly , he telegraphed his position by repeatedly ruling_out the introduction of U.S. troops into the conflict . &quot; If what we are doing doesn ' t work , then I will consider other options , &quot; Clinton said . And he repeated that &quot; the Bosnian Serbs should not doubt NATO ' s willingness to act. &quot; Clinton reiterated this week that those options include the possibility of lifting the international arms embargo that has blocked weapons shipments to the Bosnian government . But , Clinton added , &quot; there has categorically been no discussion in which I have been involved , or which I have encouraged or approved , involving the introduction of American ground forces into Bosnia &quot; except as peacekeepers after a peace_treaty has been signed . Administration officials concede the consequence of such a policy : Clinton cannot reassure Americans without comforting the Serbs as well . It is possible , they admit , that the limits of the U.S. position could encourage the Serbs to defy NATO ' s newly stated resolve , hoping simply to outlast U.S. patience . That is the risk of the U.S. strategy . The hope , by contrast , is that the Serbian leadership will decide , as U.S. experts have long predicted , that their forces already have all_the territory they want and will not be willing to endure much more pain for only marginal gains . Speaking after a meeting with Greek Prime_Minister Andreas Papandreou , whose country has relatively close relations with Serb-led Yugoslavia , Clinton appealed_to Serbian leaders to make exactly that decision , saying they &quot; need to assert themselves at this moment &quot; to control more aggressive military_leaders and &quot; avoid further wreckage. &quot; Administration officials say that so far , they have been unable to say for_sure precisely who is in control of the Bosnian Serb forces -- whether the civilian leadership can really negotiate an agreement that the military will abide_by . In addition , they are uncertain about how much control can be exerted by the leadership of the neighboring Yugoslavia , which has armed and supplied the Bosnian Serbs . Clinton also sought , once again , to reassure the Serbs that NATO ' s actions are not designed to &quot; win a military victory on the ground &quot; for the Bosnian government or to make &quot; a measurable and dramatic change of the situation on the ground. &quot; The reason for the strictly limited U.S. mission is clear . U.S. officials worry about the consequences of failure in Bosnia , both for the Bosnians and for broader U.S. credibility around the world . They admit that a U.S. failure in Bosnia could embolden other U.S. adversaries , most notably in North_Korea . But against that potential , Clinton and his aides balance a stronger fear -- a repeat of Vietnam . Several Administration officials , most notably National Security Adviser Anthony Lake , were involved in various stages of the Vietnam debacle . With that experience in their minds , Clinton and his advisers have been determined not to allow themselves to be drawn further into Bosnia ' s warfare by the seductive logic of escalating intervention . Asked about the U.S. &quot; exit strategy &quot; in the current conflict , Clinton made a clear , although unstated , reference_to the ghost of Vietnam . &quot; It is difficult to analogize this conflict from the point_of_view of the United States and the United Nations to others which occurred during the Cold_War and which had some sort of Cold_War rationale , some of which sometimes broke_down , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s important not to be too arrogant about our ability to totally dictate events so far from our shores. &quot; Clinton ' s advocacy of limited force in Bosnia received a boost from his visitor . The war in Bosnia is &quot; a fire that can spread very fast , &quot; Papandreou said in a statement opening the news_conference . It is &quot; a tragedy indeed , a great tragedy. &quot; But , he warned , the danger of NATO ' s policy is that &quot; step by step we may be dragged into a land war which would be really , by modern standards , a tragedy much greater than we have seen in Bosnia. &quot; Papandreou ' s presence on the podium was something of a personal triumph for the Greek leader , who was effectively barred from the country during his previous eight-year stint as prime_minister by the refusal of former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George_Bush to meet with him in Washington . The previous Administrations believed that his policies were anti-American . Clinton_Administration officials argue that Papandreou has mellowed this time around and , in any case , find his former positions less troubling than the Republican Administrations did .</TEXT>
