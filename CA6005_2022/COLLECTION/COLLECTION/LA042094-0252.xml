   <HEADLINE> UCI RESEARCHER ' S INTEREST GOES BEYOND TRAINING ; CANCER : ' I ' VE BEEN THROUGH IT , ' SHE SAYS OF HER BATTLE WITH THE DISEASE . SHE CREATED A LANDMARK CANCER MONITORING_PROGRAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoda Anton-Culver , one of the three UCI researchers whose study supporting breast-conserving surgery for cancer are in the international spotlight today , has an interest in the disease that goes_far deeper than her medical training . &quot; I have been through it , &quot; said the 52-year-old woman . Three years ago , the Egyptian-born epidemiologist detected cancer in her breast and had to make her own decisions about surgery . &quot; The most depressing thing is not getting information that will help you , &quot; she recalled Tuesday . She hopes studies like the one she co-authored , which was published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. , will help women with cancer make those important choices . Anton-Culver ' s academic interest in cancer spans her entire career . Educated in cancer epidemiology , immunology and genetics at St . Andrews University in Scotland , she taught at McGill University in Montreal and Creighton University in Nebraska before coming_to UCI College of Medicine in 1978 . At UCI , she established the medical_school ' s epidemiology program , then in 1984 she created a landmark cancer monitoring_program for Orange County under a new state law . Information collected by this registry , which records diagnostician procedures and treatments and follows cancer patients until death , provided the data used in the breast_cancer study . The Orange County registry served as a model for the statewide cancer registry program , which has 12 reporting regions statewide . Today , hospitals and doctors statewide are required to report all cancers to their respective registries . The Orange County registry has been expanded to include San Diego and Imperial counties . Anton-Culver said 19 # 000 to 20 # 000 new cancers each year are reported to the three-county registry . Pointing with pride to the registry and its vast storehouse of information , Anton-Culver said she hopes to use this data to discover the causes of breast_cancer and find treatments that may increase survival rates . &quot; I got interested in breast_cancer because it is a major problem for the nation and for Orange County in particular , which has the highest breast_cancer rate in the nation , &quot; she said . &quot; And I am interested in ( breast_cancer ) because it is_on the rise and we don ' t know why. &quot; The lead author of the JAMA article , Anna Lee-Feldstein , was invited by Anton-Culver to join the epidemiology program in 1990 . &quot; I do the number_crunching , &quot; said Lee-Feldstein , who is trained as a bio-statistician and who worked previously at the University of Michigan ' s School of Public Health . Her husband , Paul J . Feldstein , a professor in the UCI Graduate_School of Management and the third author on the JAMA article , said the couple decided to collaborate because they wanted to merge their diverse professional interests . &quot; Anna and I were thinking_of pulling_together the things we were interested in , &quot; he said . &quot; She was interested in epidemiology and I was interested in health-care delivery systems. &quot; Feldstein , 60 , who has a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago and wrote a popular textbook called &quot; Health_Care Economics , &quot; was recruited by UCI seven years ago . Among other things , the breast_cancer study found that patient treatment and survival rates were_best at_large hospitals and poor at at HMO hospitals . With the growth of HMOs and other managed care systems to contain medical costs , Feldstein said , &quot; I think the future is for people to request from their managed care organizations the kind of outcome measures we talk_about in the paper. &quot; All three authors of the breast_cancer study expressed amazement at the national attention their work has attracted . &quot; I have had publications before and never this kind of publicity associated with them , &quot; said Lee-Feldstein . She noted that the excitement stems from the timing of the publication , which comes amid a controversy about the falsification of results in another major breast_cancer study . The falsification of data in that international study called into question its conclusions , which generally advocated lumpectomy for treatment over mastectomy . The UCI study bolsters confidence in the less radical , breast-conserving procedure . Of course , Lee-Feldstein said , she and her colleagues had no idea this would happen when they completed their study last summer and submitted it to JAMA in hope that it would be published . Today it is the magazine ' s lead article . &quot; It is probably an accident of history , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
