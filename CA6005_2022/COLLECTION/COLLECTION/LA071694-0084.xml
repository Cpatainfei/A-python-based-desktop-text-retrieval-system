   <TEXT> The dark , dusty El Michoacano bar in Oxnard , Calif. , is usually empty at noon during the harvest season . Unless it ' s raining , the bar ' s patrons are out_in the fields clearing weeds and picking strawberries for $ 1.75 a box . On a good_day , Jesus Ambriz , 26 , stood to earn maybe $ 50 if he worked fast enough -- a small_fortune in his Mexican village of Michoacan . But with his beloved Mexico playing a World Cup soccer match against Bulgaria , Ambriz gave_up a day ' s pay earlier this month to join dozens of harvest workers in the teeming El Michoacana to watch the game . Millions of people across the United States share Ambriz ' s devotion to the World Cup . What makes them so loyal , so fanatical , so intensely emotional is not the sight of 22 men chasing a ball , they say . It ' s the immigrant ' s comfort at seeing familiar faces thousands of miles away from the homeland . It ' s the excitement of learning a universal language that opens_doors in every corner of the world . It ' s the emotion of a small country battling a mighty foe on the world stage . &quot; I ' m a fresero from the fields , &quot; said Ambriz , proudly raising his rugged hands , stained purple from picking strawberries . &quot; But I also love soccer and today I ' m proud to be a Mexican. &quot; For thousands of immigrants , soccer was among the hardest things to leave_behind in coming_to the United States . that ' s why German Luna of Queens , N.Y. , strutted into Foxboro ( Mass. ) Stadium two weeks ago . &quot; My heart is Bolivian , it always will be , &quot; said Luna , his barrel chest puffed with pride , minutes before Bolivia faced South_Korea . &quot; This is an incredible emotion . Bolivia has never qualified for a World Cup. &quot; Luna immigrated to the United States in 1970 and became a U.S. citizen 10 years later . He loves it here , but he subscribes_to El Diario , a Bolivian newspaper , so he can stay in touch with soccer back home , he said . Luna ' s story is not unlike that of millions of immigrants who have realized the American_dream . He started as a dishwasher and now owns a prosperous clothing_store . He celebrates Bolivian religious_holidays but also Thanksgiving , which does not exist in his homeland . On Columbus_Day , Luna and his family parade down the streets of New York wearing folk costumes tailor-made in Bolivia . But even though Luna followed Bolivia throughout the World Cup , he made room in his heart for the team representing his adopted country . &quot; I love the American team , &quot; he said excitedly . &quot; Did you see ( U.S. defenseman Marcelo ) Balboa ' s bicycle kick ? Did you see how they shut the Colombians ' mouth ? &quot; If Team USA were to play Bolivia , Luna said , he would be heartsick . &quot; It ' s a very tough choice , &quot; he said quietly . &quot; Bolivia is the country of my heart , but I like it here . What can I say ? I ' m American now. &quot; For thousands of temporary immigrants such_as Riyad Makki , 19 , of Mecca , Saudi_Arabia , the World Cup is much-needed relief from home sickness . An English student at American University for the last six months , Makki said he has been slow to adapt to the United States . But his black_eyes shined as he stood outside RFK Stadium dressed in his flag ' s green and white , before a Saudi_Arabia game recently . &quot; All of Saudi_Arabia is very happy , &quot; he said , suddenly not feeling so alone . &quot; Our Arab brothers are with us too . And Muslims from all_over the world. &quot; Best of all , Makki said , the Saudi_Arabian soccer team had given his people the opportunity to show that Saudi_Arabia is much more_than the launching ground for the Persian_Gulf_war . &quot; We have a great country , he said . &quot; We proved it ( with soccer victories ) against Morocco and Belgium. &quot; In the United States , where national pride is strong and international attention does not center around war , coups and natural disasters , soccer occupies a marginal place at best . But times change . Like so many immigrants , the World Cup eventually made its voyage to the United States . Not even Uncle_Sam could ignore it . &quot; I think soccer embodies the American spirit because anybody can play the game . You don ' t have to be seven feet tall or weigh 250 pounds , &quot; said Uncle_Sam , who was born Leroy Lincoln Rounsville of Quincy , Mass. , but has changed his legal name . Uncle_Sam has attended several World Cup games already and plans to be in the Rose Bowl for Sunday ' s championship match between Italy and Brazil . &quot; It ' s going_to take a lot to displace baseball from the American hearts , &quot; said Sam , in his top_hat and red-white-and-blue suit before the Spain-Italy game . &quot; But I think soccer definitely has a chance. &quot; This World Cup has also seen a shifting in soccer powers . Perennial favorites Italy and Brazil are hardly surprising finalists . But after decades of communist oppression , this tournament has been a coming-out party of sorts for eastern Europe . Romania and Bulgaria have done unexpectedly well only a_few years after free-market reforms allowed their best players to earn huge sums in the world ' s most prestigious professional leagues . The Bulgarians lost to Italy in the semifinals , but received a hero ' s welcome on their return to Sofia this week . After watching Brazil beat Sweden Wednesday at the Rose Bowl , Sandra Medrado did the samba with fellow Brazilians over to a rocking bar on bustling Colorado Street in the nerve_center of Pasadena . There , a_few blocks were closed_off by police as hundreds celebrated . &quot; There was dancing and screaming , &quot; said Medrado , a Rio de Janiero native who works for the Consulate of Brazilian Los Angeles . &quot; We were all saying we were going_to have some pasta and pizza on Sunday because we ' re going to eat the Italians. &quot; Medrado said she hoped to buy tickets to Sunday ' s game without breaking her bank_account . &quot; If not , &quot; she said , &quot; we ' re going to go_to a bar and commemorate. &quot;</TEXT>
