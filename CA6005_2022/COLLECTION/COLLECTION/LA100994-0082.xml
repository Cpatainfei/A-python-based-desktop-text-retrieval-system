   <TEXT> It had snowed the night before , and a stiff October wind blew across the lake as the soldiers struggled to sink the boat . The French threatened to raid their Lake George encampments , so the_British wanted all their new boats on the lake ' s bottom before the winter of 1758 closed_in . That would seal them beneath the ice , safe from a French attack . &quot; Provincials &quot; allied_with the_British loaded the boat with rocks and scuttled it once , only to watch it pop_up like a cork . So down it went a second time ; this time , it would not be seen again for more_than two centuries . The ship , called the Land Tortoise , is finally being called into duty 236 years after its inaugural launch -- as a tourist attraction . New York state is allowing certified divers to view the unique French_and_Indian_War ship . Researchers say the ship , 105 feet underwater near the southern end of Lake George , is a remarkably well preserved artifact from a time when the_British and the_French fought for control of the New World with cannons and muskets . &quot; It ' s like it was put_in a refrigerator . It ' s 95 % clean , &quot; said Joseph Zarzynski , executive_director of Bateaux Below , a nonprofit group formed to protect Adirondack shipwrecks . Zarzynski was part of the boat crew that in 1990 discovered the Land Tortoise after sonar picked_up a ghostly image on the lake_bottom . Many other , smaller transport_ships -- called by the_French bateaux -- were sunk at_the_same_time and had been found on the lake_bottom . But the Land Tortoise was a unique find . Fifty-two feet long and 18 feet wide , the Land Tortoise was a floating fort , outfitted to accommodate seven cannons and sides that jutted_out diagonally to the water to repel musket fire . Flat-bottomed with an oak hull , the class of boat was aptly called &quot; radeau , &quot; the_French word for raft . In the water , it resembled a giant_tortoise . Ragtag provincials built the Land Tortoise and maybe more_than 200 other boats as part of their edgy alliance with the_British . &quot; You are talking_about a vessel largely constructed by farmers who were carpenters . It was supposed to be simple to make , &quot; said Chuck Vandrei , the archeologist for the state_Department of Environmental Conservation . The British , in turn , hoped to sail the fleet up Lake George to aid in an assault on Carillon , France ' s stronghold to the north on Lake Champlain . The two lakes were crucial links in the water route between New York City and Montreal and thus important to control of the continent . The Land Tortoise was sunk Oct . 22 , 1758 -- two days after its first launch -- with the thought that it could be resurrected after a winter in cold storage . The troops , with no fort , would have had a hard_time defending their boats against a French onslaught , Vandrei said . But the scuttling had a_few hitches , according to a journal entry by Massachusetts shipwright William Sweat . &quot; We sunk her once ; But one side rise again , so that we were forced to work the chief of the night , Before we could keep her down , &quot; Sweat wrote . When British Gen . Jeffery Amherst completed in 1759 his successful siege of Carillon ( soon after renamed Ft . Ticonderoga ) , he brought_up a schooner from the lake_bottom and some bateaux , but left the Land Tortoise . Zarzynski thinks the soldiers who sank the Land Tortoise in those October winds might have inadvertently sunk it too deep to be easily recovered . The boats would have had to be hauled back_up with ropes . But before that backbreaking work , a soldier would literally have had to hold his breath in water 45 degrees or colder while dragging rocks from the submerged vessel . No such obstacles exist these days for divers visiting the site . A buoy bobbing within sight of Lake George Village marks the spot . Some of the boat ' s wood is so fragile that even bubbles from a diver ' s tank or water roiled by a kicking fin could damage the wood , Zarzynski explained . The boat , lacking the oars , masts and cannon it was outfitted with , is still intact and upright . Schools of sculpin fish live_in its crannies . For added control , all divers must sign_in with the state_Department of Environmental Conservation at an island campsite . Divers who wish to view the other Lake George shipwrecks , which have been open since last year , do not need to sign_in . State officials say the caution is justified because the Land Tortoise is a one-of-a-kind find . &quot; Essentially , there is an irreplaceable library down there of historical documentation of what is an important period of our history , &quot; said Langdon Marsh , the state environmental commissioner .</TEXT>
