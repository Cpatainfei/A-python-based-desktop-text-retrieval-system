   <HEADLINE> IN 3RD TRIAL , LAPD OFFICER IS CONVICTED OF STORE ROBBERY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After three trials , a Los Angeles police_officer was found guilty Thursday of masterminding the robbery of a check cashing store in the South Bay , but a jury deadlocked on counts involving a second robbery in the same area . The jury convicted Officer Bobby Rydell Marshall , 36 , of three felonies -- grand theft , second-degree robbery and second-degree burglary -- in the September , 1989 , robbery of an Anytime Check Cashing outlet in Lawndale . The officer , who is suspended without pay and will probably be fired , could be sentenced to up_to 10 years in prison . He had been free on bail , but Superior_Court Judge Paul Gutman sent him to county jail on Thursday to await sentencing . Two previous juries had deadlocked on all_the charges against Marshall , one in favor of acquittal and the other in favor of conviction . On Thursday , the jury deadlocked on charges involving the November , 1989 , robbery of an Anytime Check Cashing outlet in Torrance . After the verdict , jurors would not say whether the majority favored conviction or acquittal on the three felony counts stemming from the Torrance incident . But Deputy Dist . Atty . Efrem Grail said they told him they had deadlocked 7 to 5 on one count in favor of conviction and 11 to 1 on the other two in favor of conviction . Marshall ' s attorney , Edward A . Esqueda , said his client &quot; feels confident that we will prevail on an appeal and he still emphatically denies any wrongdoing. &quot; Marshall has maintained since his 1992 arrest that the charges are punishment for his public criticism of the Los Angeles Police_Department after the Rodney G . King beating case , for his 1991 statements to the Christopher Commission about racism and misconduct in the LAPD , and because he wrote a memoir of his 11-year career titled &quot; Inside the Blue Klux Klan. &quot; Throughout the trials , Grail has dismissed Marshall ' s claims as an attempt to hide his wrongdoing . One juror , however , a woman who declined to give her name , said it seemed to her that Grail was conducting a witch hunt and that other prosecutors who had observed the trial were &quot; out_to get Marshall. &quot; Nevertheless she said , some evidence against him was compelling . She and other jurors cited evidence indicating that Marshall had used his patrol_car computer on more_than one occasion to get information on the victims before the robberies and had accepted more_than 125 phone_calls from a prison inmate who confessed to the robberies and is serving a 14-year sentence . That witness , Gregory Sims , had been in prison two years when police interviewed him in June , 1991 . Sims implicated Marshall and his wife , who at the time of the robberies was engaged to Bobby Marshall and worked_at the Lawndale check cashing store . Carolyn Marshall was at one time charged with being an accomplice in the Lawndale robbery , but was acquitted of all charges last year during her husband ' s second trial .</TEXT>
