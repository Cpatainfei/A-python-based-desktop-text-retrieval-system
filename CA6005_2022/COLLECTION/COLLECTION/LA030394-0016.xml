   <HEADLINE> AN EARLY SPRING ; CONFESSIONS OF A POD PERSON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a child , the only way I could eat peas was to pretend they were pills and swallow them whole , washed_down with milk . Imaginary pneumonia , flu and intolerable insomnia were cured at the dinner_table . &quot; I ' m taking a sleeping pill , &quot; I ' d announce , then down the pea and produce great , grunty whistling snores until my mother said , &quot; that ' s just about enough , thank you. &quot; Now I grow my own peas . Last October , I bedded dried , shriveled pea seeds in damp rags and left them on my water_heater . When they sent_out inquisitive white roots , I planted them , one per inch , in my garden . I planted Sugar Snap edible pod peas and shelling peas with a transvestite ' s name : Wando . Wando peas , I read on the packet , needed support . When the vines got a little length on them , I stuck part of an old expandable wooden gate in the ground . The plants tried the gate -- they twirled these heartbreakingly tiny tendrils around the wood -- and let_go , as if they ' d decided instead to sprawl across the ground , flirt_with the dark forces of rot and mildew . I kept introducing them to the gate without result . Peas , like teen-agers , often don ' t know what ' s best for them . Eventually , I tied them up . For their own good . After some weeks , there was an outbreak of white flowers that looked_like profiles of women in bonnets . These blossoms dried_up and fell_away to reveal inch-long green crescents . When the sun hit these crescents , tiny embryonic peas could be seen , rows of apostrophes . Next , the pods grew thick and the peas stayed tiny . Then the peas fattened_up , filled_out . I opened pods of stunning symmetry -- perfect green spheres with the tiniest hitch holding them to the pod . There ' s nothing dearer than peas in the pod , nothing in the vegetable kingdom at any rate . And they ' re so sweet , they taste already cooked . I stumbled around my garden , popping peas . Reeling . Around the time my Wandos were coming_into their perfect selves I was reading &quot; Simple Food &quot; by John Thorne . In his preface , Thorne writes_about how recipes are only re-creations ; the process of coming_up with a recipe , with all its decisions and confusions , is not apparent to the cook who follows a recipe . However , as soon as cooks start comparing cookbooks with each other , they get a sense of how many decisions are inherent in the simplest recipe . To illustrate this point , Thorne introduces his readers to a particularly controversial and versatile dish : risi e bisi , rice and peas . The controversy surrounding risi e bisi is based on what , exactly , risi e bisi is : soup or risotto . Thorne lines_up the sides : Marcella Hazan and Ada Boni say risi e bisi is soup . Elizabeth David and Jane Grigson vote for risotto . A browse through the Italian cookbooks in any collection , even my own limited home collection , expands upon this controversy . Lorenza di Medici votes for soup , Gioletta Vitale puts rice and peas together in something closer to a pilaf . Thorne , after sorting through a slew of risi e bisi permutations , presents his own recipe for a soup and a risotto . Both recipes contain the same ingredients and differ only in proportions . Clearly , it ' s difficult to go_wrong with the dish , given the ingredients : rice and peas in combination are inarguably pleasurable . Soup or risotto , risi e bisi can bear the imprint of any good cook and still be delicious -- proof that there is no single path to the marvelous . Thorne himself says , &quot; Even if you have never heard of this dish before , you probably have some idea as_to how you would go_about making it. &quot; Indeed . I had enough of an idea that , when a friend called and confessed that , having eaten it many times in Italy and New York , he was something of a risi e bisi expert , I invited him over for dinner . Risi e Wandi . My first decision was : risotto . I was in the risotto camp . Sorry , Marcella . My version , I already knew , would differ from Thorne ' s recipe in certain small ways . For example , I liked the idea , mentioned and rejected by Thorne , of using the shucked pea shells in the broth . Finally , in a constant effort to find more vegetarian dishes for an increasingly large circle of vegetarian friends , I resolved to create a vegetarian risi e bisi and bought a bag full of broth vegetables at the supermarket . But then , my deli man offered me a nice thick slab off the end of a prosciutto for the price of pancetta . In his preface , Thorne writes_of &quot; ferment , the confusion , the groping before the moment that shaped the dish. &quot; That was me as I stood , oscillating at the counter , resolve weakening , face-to-face with a bargain piece of Parma ham . I bought some , just in case I changed my mind . Home again , I picked a basket of peas , shucked them in the late afternoon sun on my front_porch and considered more decisions . Should I , as Thorne instructed , cook the peas separately from the risotto and add them at the last minute ? Would they really break_down if stirred in the risotto ? The peas themselves formed an answer : Small and medium-sized peas were so tender and sweet , they required only heating . The larger peas , especially those grown so plump they had flattened sides from pressing up against each other in the pod , were starchier and did require some cooking . I doubted very much if these vigorous Wandos would turn_to mush under the spoon . Since it required very little extra effort , I separated the peas into large starchy peas and smaller sweet_peas . Those in between ? Into my mouth . As I shucked away , I also remembered a 5-year-old boy I once knew whose mother asked him to grate cheese for enchiladas she was making . This boy liked the rubbery curls of grated Jack cheese so_much , by the time he finished grating , there was nothing in the bowl -- he ' d eaten the whole half-pound block . I thought_about this boy because a similar phenomenon was happening with me and the cunning little Wandos : a mounting pile of empty pods , very few peas in either bowl . Finally , when pressed with the prospect of shucking peas into the next century , I mustered enough self-restraint to come_up with a cup and a half of peas . I put the broth vegetables , big fat handfuls of shelled pea_pods and water on to boil . I grated the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese , chopped the onion and parsley and , in case I decided to use it , the prosciutto . I had more time to fret and grope as the broth bubbled : how much butter should I use , for example ? Thorne ' s recipe , with one cup each of butter , Parmesan cheese and rice , read like a prescription for an underweight prize fighter : too rich for my sedentary blood . Also , did I want to use butter only , or butter and olive_oil , my usual choice for the initial sauteing step_in a risotto ? I set the table , fed the pets , checked a_few more recipes , fished a potato chunk out of the broth and ate it , salted , with a drop of olive_oil . When the broth was fragrant and flavorful , I strained it and took the plunge . My guest was coming_in half an hour . In the end , I used butter and olive_oil . And I put_in the prosciutto . I added the large peas earlier than I needed to , but it didn ' t matter much : The husky Wandos didn ' t break_down in the stirring ; they just turned a grassier shade of green . The smaller , sweeter peas , added in the last three minutes of stirring , kept their innocent , sweet , fresh-picked flavor . My guest arrived in the last few minutes of my stirring . He poured mineral_waters and then stood_by the stove and tasted , helping me to locate that moment of perfect doneness , which indeed happened just like that : chalky one moment , perfect the next . Who knows if my decisions were crucial or not ? At the very least , they left the basic , extraordinary pleasure of rice with peas undiminished . The risi was creamy and bumpy , a pleasure similar to -- but more adult than -- tapioca . The bisi , gloriously round , rolled and popped_in the mouth like plumped warm caviar . Put_together , scented with parsley , studded with chewy and subtle prosciutto , the stuff was irresistible , nubbly mouthful after mouthful . I ' d made four servings . We ate them all . RISI E BISI 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons olive_oil 1 / 2 large onion , finely chopped 1 thick slice of prosciutto ( approximately 1 / 8-inch thick ) , cut_into small cubes 1 cup Arborio rice Vegetable Stock , boiling 1 1 / 2 cups freshly shelled peas . Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese , freshly grated 2 tablespoons Italian_parsley , chopped Freshly ground pepper Melt butter and olive_oil in heavy saute pan over medium heat . When butter starts to foam , add chopped onion and prosciutto . Saute until onion is translucent . Add rice . Saute until rice turns opaque , about 2 to 3 minutes . Pour 2 ladles ( approximately 1 cup ) boiling Vegetable Stock into rice and stir . Stir constantly , allowing stock to be absorbed , and adding more stock when none is pooling up in pan . Keep adding boiling stock and stirring , about 15 minutes . Add peas and start tasting . Add more boiling Vegetable Stock . Keep stirring . When peas brighten in_color and rice is chewy without being chalky and has thick sauce , stir in 1 / 2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese . Serve immediately , sprinkled with chopped parsley . Pass additional freshly grated cheese and pepper . Makes 4 servings .
