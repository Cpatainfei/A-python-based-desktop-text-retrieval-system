   <HEADLINE> WIMBLEDON ; GRAF ' S REIGN GETS SOAKED BY MCNEIL ; TENNIS : AMERICAN , A 100-1 SHOT , AVOIDS GERMAN ' S BACKHAND AND SCORES A 7-5 , 7-6 ( 7-5 ) UPSET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Their historic first-round match finally complete , Steffi Graf and Lori McNeil collected their belongings in Tuesday ' s cloud-shrouded darkness and made their way off Wimbledon ' s rain-slicked Centre Court . McNeil , the unseeded American -- the talent supposedly unfulfilled -- left on cloud_nine . Graf , the five-time Wimbledon champion who almost always leaves grass stains on anyone who ventures into her path , departed with a German glare that could have melted tungsten . Such was the power of McNeil ' s 7-5 , 7-6 ( 7-5 ) victory over the previously grass-invincible Graf . It marked the first time in Wimbledon ' s 108-year history that a defending women ' s champion , a top-seeded defender at that , had been beaten_in opening-round play . Moments after McNeil ' s match-winning forehand volley had eluded Graf , the players met at the net , exchanged handshakes and words . As best as McNeil could remember , Graf congratulated her and then muttered something else . &quot; She said , ' Well done , ' and ' Good match , ' and ' Good_luck , ' I think , &quot; said McNeil , ranked 22nd in the world but considered a grass-court threat because of her serve-and-volley game . This was only the second time in the last decade that Graf had dropped consecutive matches -- one at the recent French Open and then Tuesday against McNeil . Graf was a 2-5 favorite to win the women ' s championship here , McNeil a 100-1 shot . But even the local bookies knew that Graf ' s first-round draw was no sure thing . that ' s because in 1992 , at the Virginia Slims Championships , Graf was defeated in the first round . The winner ? The troublesome McNeil . Until Tuesday ' s match , it was the last time the German superstar had exited so early . Even Graf seemed slightly unimpressed by the day ' s events . Upset ? What upset ? &quot; ( It ' s ) not that big an upset because of who I lost to , I would say , &quot; she said . &quot; I mean , it was a very difficult first round and she has always the ability to play the top players , so it ' s not that big of an upset. &quot; Perhaps sensing that they might be witnesses to history , the 13 # 118 who crammed Centre Court stadium at the All England Lawn_Tennis Club braved two long rain delays and the blustery , cold winds of London ' s mostly typical summer weather . In all , the match took about five hours from starting serve to last tiebreaker point . Five hours for Graf to realize that her serves were something of a mess -- she served only one ace -- and five hours to score only one point off her serve-and-volley attack , which produced only two tries in two sets . &quot; She played better than me , &quot; Graf said . &quot; that ' s very obvious. &quot; Never was it more obvious than at the end of the first set , when Graf double-faulted and handed McNeil the 7-5 advantage . Later , in the second set , Graf was ahead , 5-4 , the serve hers . But rather than take_control of the game , as she usually does_in such situations , Graf faltered once more . In need of a point to push the game to deuce , Graf barely missed on an ace , had to dink over a second serve and then pushed a backhand into the net . Score : 5-5 . Eventually , a tiebreaker was needed and again Graf made uncharacteristic mistakes . Ahead , 3-2 , she promptly sent a smash into the net . Then she double-faulted , allowing McNeil to move ahead , 4-3 , then , 5-3 , then , 6-3 . It was as she faced match_point , and with no margin for error , that Graf later said she felt she had no chance . She was right , as McNeil delivered the forehand volley that ended it all . As Graf had continually failed to venture toward the net , McNeil began hitting shot after shot at the German ' s backhand , considered the lesser of the star ' s two evils . By doing so , it helped neutralize Graf ' s power game . &quot; That was a big part of my strategy , to make her pass me off the backhand side , &quot; McNeil said . &quot; Everyone knows Steffi has a great forehand. &quot; Strategy is one thing , execution another . Before Tuesday , McNeil had never advanced past the Wimbledon quarterfinals and has made_it to only one Grand_Slam semifinal -- at the U.S. Open in 1987 . And even with the victory over Graf two years ago , McNeil ' s overall record against the German star was 1-8 . But Tuesday was different . More precisely , McNeil was different . More mature , she said . More aware . &quot; It ' s definitely the best win , &quot; McNeil said . McNeil ' s best , one of Wimbledon ' s biggest . Meanwhile , Lindsay Davenport ' s strange and wonderful June continued happily along as she defeated France ' s Julie Halard , 6-1 , 6-4 , in her first-round match . Davenport turned 18 two weeks ago , reached the third round of the_French Open , went_to her high_school prom , attended her Murrieta Valley High graduation ceremony , watched as the school ' s No . 1 court was named in her honor , left for London last Saturday , discovered that No . 7-seed Mary Pierce had withdrawn , took Pierce ' s place in the draw , got a new hairdo and then beat Halard . The first set was easy enough , Davenport taking only 22 minutes to win . But Halard recovered somewhat in the second set , forcing Davenport into an assortment of errors . &quot; She started to get a_few more balls back in the second set and I was a little nervous , &quot; said Davenport , the first American-born woman to reach the top-10 rankings since Jennifer Capriati did_it in October of 1990 . Wimbledon Notes Steffi Graf ' s loss was everyone else ' s gain in the women ' s draw , especially Lindsay Davenport ' s . When Mary Pierce withdrew from the tournament last Saturday , Davenport was moved_into Pierce ' s spot , away from fourth-seeded Martina Navratilova ' s side of the draw to Graf ' s side . But with Graf gone , Davenport ' s chances of reaching the final improved significantly . . . . Graf , when asked if Lori McNeil is playing well enough to advance to the final : &quot; I don ' t think so , no. &quot;</TEXT>
