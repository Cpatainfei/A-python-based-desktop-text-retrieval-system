   <HEADLINE> MARKET FOCUS ; RUSSIAN TAX POLICE TALLY UP VICTORIES -- $ 3 BILLION WORTH ; DESPITE THE PROGRESS , CHEATING IS A WAY OF LIFE . MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES SHORT THE GOVERNMENT . SOME HAVEN ' T PAID A SINGLE RUBLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mikhail , a young Russian making his fortune in the import-export business , has a lot of worries . The racketeers want more money , so does his driver , and for some reason the last batch of sneakers he imported from Hong Kong aren ' t selling . But paying his taxes isn ' t a concern . &quot; My business hasn ' t paid a single ruble in taxes , &quot; he boldly admitted . &quot; No one I know pays unless they ' re forced . I won ' t give them anything until they come and get me. &quot; Many Russians say they duck the duties because the burden is outrageously high thanks to the more_than 40 different kinds of taxes that Russia heaps on citizens and their businesses . Moreover , people just don ' t think they ' ll get caught . But that may be changing . To fight tax dodgers , the Russian government has created a separate , souped-up police_force . Like the &quot; Untouchables &quot; who fought Chicago ' s gangland crime_wave in the 1920s and 1930s , the Tax Police aim to restore law and order , not to mention fiscal responsibility , to post-Communist Russia . &quot; There ' s no reason to be afraid of us if you pay your taxes honestly , &quot; said Sergei Almazov , head of the Tax Police . But people who shirk their responsibility , he warned , will be caught and punished . Russians ' reticence to perform the central civic_duty of paying their taxes illustrates how hard it is , after 70 years of communism , to transform this vast nation into a well-functioning democracy . &quot; We have to teach people that the money that they are paying isn ' t gone from them forever , &quot; Almazov , a former KGB officer , said in an interview . &quot; It ' s going_to the state budget , which returns to the people in the form_of_government programs . To educate taxpayers so they understand this system is our most important role. &quot; Furthermore , Russia needs every ruble of revenue it is_due . Because the government has no mandatory withholding , no national identity numbers -- that is , no easy way to monitor how much people earn in this cash-based economy -- tax_evasion is massive . Millions of people and enterprises fail to pay all that is_due , Almazov said . The Tax Inspectorate estimates that it failed to collect $ 9 billion due in 1993 -- about a quarter of its anticipated revenue . The Russian government founded the Tax Police in 1992 to aid the Tax Service -- the agency responsible_for levying and collecting taxes -- by investigating possible tax cheats . Moreover , officials hoped that a strong enforcement arm would intimidate Russians into paying . For the muscle to get the job done , the Tax Police was endowed with enormous powers : It can seize assets , throw suspected tax evaders in jail and levy huge penalties . It entices hard work from its 11 # 000 agents -- many of whom came from the former KGB , the Defense Ministry and other security organs -- by rewarding them with a percentage of the amount they recover , with no upper_limit . This incentive system is supposed to discourage tax_collectors from taking bribes . Still , in this land of rampant corruption , the potential for official malfeasance is immense . Politicians , for instance , can suggest to the tax force that their enemies be investigated . Meanwhile , some entrepreneurs say that they pay_off the Russian &quot; Untouchables. &quot; &quot; The situation ( with corruption ) exists -- we don ' t try to hide it , &quot; Almazov admitted , but he said only four Tax Police employees were convicted of corruption in 1993 . Also open_to abuse is the Tax Police ' s right to reward informants who turn_in tax evaders with up_to 10 % of the take that results from their tips . Sometimes the motivation of the tipster is suspicious . &quot; A very small number &quot; of tipsters have come_forward , said Almazov , but most leads are pursued . &quot; If someone comes_to us with information , we have to figure_out if the person is interested ( personally in the case ) , &quot; he said . &quot; It could be a competitor. &quot; &quot; But if it checks_out , we have the right to reward this collaborator , &quot; Almazov said . Despite these problems , the Tax Police has been a financial success . Since it was established , the unit has recovered 3.5 trillion rubles , about $ 3 billion , through investigations and audits -- fully 8 % of total government_revenue for the period . About one business in five has been audited , Almazov said . But the Russians ' tax-evading attitude is hard to change . To help put fear into their compatriots ' hearts , the tax cops have focused their energy on a_few high-profile , multimillion-dollar cases . Among their targets : the five-star Grand Hotel Europa in St . Petersburg and the former state insurance_company , Ingostrakh . In a move that has brought them a flood of publicity , the Tax Police also spearheaded the government ' s crackdown on the MMM investment fund , whose pyramid scheme collapsed in July in a spectacular securities fraud . The tax authorities began investigating MMM in 1992 , but it wasn ' t until this year that the Tax Police -- with the government ' s blessing -- started publicly warning that MMM was financially unstable and violating tax laws . The tax cops ' pronouncements became so strong that , eventually , they spurred a run_on the fund . Share prices crashed from more_than $ 55 to just 50 cents in a_few days . The Tax Police tried to cement its image as the protector of Russia ' s new investor class by arresting MMM President Sergei Mavrodi , rappelling down ropes from the roof of Mavrodi ' s house in a spectacular show of force . Mavrodi has since been charged with tax_evasion . Nevertheless , the MMM assault backfired . Instead of thanking the unit , many of the estimated 5 million angry MMM shareholders blame the tax authorities for wiping_out their investments . &quot; This is Russia -- our mentality is different , &quot; said an exasperated Nikolai Medvedev , tax-force spokesman . &quot; We had decades where the government gave and the government took_away . . . . People just haven ' t adjusted to the new reality. &quot; The Tax Police are likely to be involved in the MMM affair for months to come . Officials are starting to sort through Mavrodi ' s complex web of 44 shell companies . Almazov hopes that in the long_run , the Tax Police ' s image will be enhanced by its dealings with MMM . &quot; Our people are trying to do something good , &quot; he insisted .</TEXT>
