   <TEXT> The recent arrests of 20 people for illegally buying_food stamps from earthquake victims has focused angry national attention on abuse of emergency quake relief . But profiteering from the disaster pales in comparison to the billion-dollar fraud that plagues the food_stamp program each year . Some estimates place error , waste and fraud -- from the theft of freshly printed coupons stored in warehouses to the selling of coupons for a profit at the grocery_store -- as high as one in every $ 7 spent on the program . In Los Angeles County , that would amount to $ 55 million a year . &quot; This has been a longstanding problem that has really only been accentuated by the earthquake , &quot; said Assistant U.S. Atty . George B . Newhouse Jr. , who supervises the government fraud section in Los Angeles . The problem is so great that county officials want to eliminate food_stamp coupons entirely by converting to an electronic_computer system , in which recipients would use plastic debit cards to pay_for groceries . A few weeks ago , authorities probably would not have bothered with many of the so-called &quot; runners &quot; who buy and resell food_stamps on the street -- five of whom were picked_up in late January outside a South-Central Los Angeles check-cashing store . Officials say street sales in food_stamps are too numerous and too low on the fraud chain to warrant the attention of strapped federal investigators , a situation that changed only because of public outcry over abuses of earthquake relief . &quot; We could go_out there and arrest 1 # 000 people for trafficking on the street , but when the money to be made is great , there would be another 1 # 000 on the street to take their place , &quot; said David F . Dickson , regional inspector_general for the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture , charged with investigating food_stamp fraud . The $ 22-billion food_stamp program provides 27 million low-income Americans with monthly coupons to buy groceries , and authorities say the vast majority of recipients are honest , deserving and law-abiding . But the program also serves as the grist for a lucrative black_market , with the colorful coupons the next best thing to dollars for drug_traffickers , gun runners and scam artists from Los Angeles to Miami . &quot; Food_stamps have become a second currency on the street , &quot; said Ellen Haas , assistant secretary_of_agriculture for food and consumer services . &quot; They are so easily available , and it is so easy to intimidate recipients that there has grown an underground street crime that involves food_stamps in a major way. &quot; Undercover agents have been offered everything from houses to surface-to-air_missiles in trade for the coupons , although Haas said drugs , guns and cash are by far the most sought-after commodities . Last year , federal_agents won convictions in the largest food_stamp fraud cases in Southland history , with the owners of two family-run grocery_stores going_to prison for illegal trafficking in more_than $ 20 million worth of food_stamps . Anaheim residents David Rodriguez , his wife , Juana , and son Eduardo , and South Gate residents Evristo Pereira and his wife , Maria , operated small neighborhood markets near Downtown Los Angeles , but were redeeming more food_stamps than most major supermarket chains , authorities said . In a separate case , the owner of a Hollywood milk delivery company was sentenced to 27 months in prison after pleading guilty to illegally trafficking and redeeming $ 2.3 million in food_stamps . Authorities said Michael A . Presumido became so wrapped_up in running the scheme that he had to give_up his milk delivery route and devote his attention full time to food_stamp trafficking . Another Los Angeles man was sentenced to 15 months in prison last year after he sold $ 29 # 400 in food_stamps to an undercover_agent for $ 25 # 000 in cash . Agents also found $ 82 # 000 in food_stamps in the man ' s home . Federal_agents were aware of trafficking at Broadway and Manchester Boulevard for several months , but did nothing to stop the illegal sales until recently because they wanted to trace the stamps to a retail_store . Runners typically unload food_stamps by selling the coupons at a discount to an authorized grocery_store , which in turn redeems them at face_value from the federal treasury . &quot; We emphasize getting the store owners because without them , the stamps can ' t be used for anything but food , &quot; Dickson said . But the federal_government ' s big-dollar approach abruptly changed -- at least for now -- when rampant curbside sales in food_stamps intended for earthquake victims embarrassed the federal program . A Senate hearing on the problem was called last week in Washington , and Department_of_Agriculture officials scurried to reassure a restless public that the massive food assistance program had not become a reckless waste_of_money . &quot; I have said from Day One that the program ' s integrity is essential , &quot; Haas said . &quot; Fraud takes benefits away from people who are hungry , and every time ( the media ) write_about fraud , public support of the program erodes. &quot; On Friday , the U.S. attorney ' s office announced the formation of a federal task_force , which includes eight federal law_enforcement agencies , to investigate earthquake-related fraud in food_stamps and other government assistance . Newhouse , who heads the task_force , said the special unit is designed to expand the government ' s focus_on big-dollar fraud to include street-level crime as well . Even so , the resulting crackdown on street sales in Los Angeles and surrounding counties will do little to combat the biggest fraud problems , local and federal_officials say ; the runners typically carry less than $ 2 # 000 in illegal food_stamps . Los Angeles County distributes $ 66.4 million in food_stamp coupons monthly and expects to issue an additional $ 100 million in emergency earthquake-related coupons . * It is hoped that the highly visible street-level enforcement will discourage new traffickers from entering the crowded resale scene . Officials worry that word of unchecked street sales after the earthquake sent the wrong message to both honest and dishonest food_stamp recipients , in_effect recruiting a new class of opportunists and scam artists . &quot; We cannot tolerate the impression on the street that the program is out of control , &quot; one federal investigator said . &quot; It is undermining public support for a program that is very worthwhile. &quot; But when the earthquake emergency passes , federal investigators with the Department_of_Agriculture will have little choice but to concentrate once again on the most egregious cases of fraud . With just 45 investigators monitoring 300 federal programs in eight western states , the department is so strapped that it plans to hand_over some enforcement responsibilities to the county under a two-year experiment expected to begin in April . The county , which is charged with investigating eligibility fraud , will get $ 1.7 million in state and federal money to take_on street traffickers as well . Although catching the traffickers is a federal job , the state and county have agreed to help because they fear the problem has gotten_out of hand . More_than 1 million people -- nearly one in eight Los Angeles County residents -- depend_on food_stamps to put meals on the table , making tracking the stamps an enormous bureaucratic undertaking . Day in and day out , county officials follow thousands of tips and leads to ferret_out fraud in eligibility , which involves everything from people lying on food_stamp applications to recipients failing to report new jobs . Last week , the fraud may have extended_to some county welfare_workers , with federal authorities investigating tips that county workers had filed false claims of_their_own . At least 19 workers have been referred for possible criminal prosecution or administrative discipline . County fraud investigators last year uncovered 7 # 000 cases of food_stamp and welfare overpayments totaling more_than $ 29.1 million . Many of the cases began with a call to the county hot_line at ( 213 ) 749-4266 , officials said . In an effort to get a better handle on the abuse , the county last month hired 70 investigators ( for a total of 245 ) to beef_up its early detection program . The investigators review applications for food_stamps and other federal and local assistance and attempt to prevent fraud artists from obtaining benefits . Even with stepped-up enforcement , county officials believe that they can put a bigger dent in the black_market for food_stamp benefits by introducing plastic debit cards and scrapping the food_stamp coupons . Maryland introduced the cards statewide last year , and San Bernardino and San Diego counties will become the first counties in California to begin using them next year . The program -- known as electronic benefit transfers -- allows food_stamp recipients to pay_for groceries at the checkout stand much as other customers use bank or credit_cards . &quot; We need it and want it as soon as possible , &quot; said Lisa Nunez , who heads the computer division of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social_Services . State welfare officials said they want to monitor the programs in San Bernardino and San Diego before authorizing the cards in Los Angeles , where the sheer volume of recipients will make the conversion a huge undertaking . Maryland officials say the system is too new_to know how much money it is saving the state in fraud , waste and mistakes , but they say anecdotal evidence has been very positive . Fraud investigators like them because they leave an electronic trail of each transaction , said Dale Brown , who heads the program for the Maryland Department of Human Resources . One Maryland recipient , Bobbie McKinney , 41 , a single mother of two , said the biggest advantage is the avoidance of long lines for food_stamp redemptions and the embarrassment of paying with food_stamp coupons . &quot; I call it the poor people ' s MasterCard , &quot; McKinney said . &quot; To me , a lot of dignity comes_with it. &quot; * The federal_government has endorsed the idea , recently requiring that all states develop plans by 1996 to convert from paper coupons to plastic cards . Federal_officials want eventually to distribute all public assistance benefits -- including welfare , Social_Security and military pensions -- on the cards in an effort to cut bureaucratic costs associated with shuffling reams of paper . Federal and local fraud investigators welcome the move to electronic benefits , but they warn that the fraud problem will not go_away with the change . &quot; People who want to break the law will always find a way to beat the system , &quot; Dickson said .
