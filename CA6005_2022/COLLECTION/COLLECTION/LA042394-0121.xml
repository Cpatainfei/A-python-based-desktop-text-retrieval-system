   <TEXT> In the Saturday Letters column , April 16 , Keith R . Matzinger of Camarillo , in commenting on the &quot; well-deserved publicity &quot; of &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; ( &quot; Americans Gave Lives &quot; ) , said he had &quot; not seen a single mention of the thousands of Americans who gave their lives to end the Holocaust. &quot; The film , and any critique of it , does not address itself to the Allied invasion of Europe and the fight to destroy the German army.By the time of D-day , June 6 , 1944 , the fate of Europe ' s Jews had long been sealed . Probably two-thirds of prewar Jewry had already been killed one way or another . Our gallant U.S. and Allied soldiers fought their way across the Rhine in less than one year , but they did not even know that the death camps existed , and they were astounded by what they found in Germany . Our high_command , from Franklin D . Roosevelt down through the State_Department , Gen . George C . Marshall and the rest , knew about the camps and the transport of Jews from all_of Europe to Poland and eastern Germany but chose not to acknowledge the situation , lest our war effort be &quot; diverted &quot; from the primary task of wiping_out Germany . The U.S. Holocaust Memorial in Washington , and probably every_other Holocaust memorial , does honor the GIs who assisted in the liberation of the death camps and who gave succor to the pitiable , and pitifully few , survivors .
