   <HEADLINE> STYLE : ARCHITECTURE ; L.A. ARCHITECTS : THEY DID IT THEIR WAY ; CLASSICISM BOWS TO OFFBEAT DESIGNS , DECLASSE MATERIALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At a two-wine , three-fork luncheon in New York ' s Plaza Hotel a_couple_of years ago , when editors of Progressive Architecture announced their choice for the year ' s best designs , alarmed New York architects stopped sipping their decaf as they realized that Angelenos were walking_off with every_other award . By the end of the roll_call , it dawned on the audience , including front-row arbiter Philip Johnson , that something momentous had quietly happened : The baton of the profession , so firmly gripped by the Postmodernists of the East Coast in the 1980s , had passed to the West . The offbeat buildings in Santa Monica and Venice , the daring houses perched on Hollywood hillsides and Frank Gehry ' s designs for museums and cultural centers added_up to a national phenomenon that challenged the notion that New York ' s sovereignty in architecture was God-given and forever . &quot; New York made a fatal turn_in the 1980s and stepped off the trajectory , &quot; says Santa Monica architect Craig Hodgetts , whose spirited , tent-like Temporary Powell Library at UCLA , designed with his partner and wife , Hsin-Ming Fung , landed a cover feature in Architectural Record a year ago . &quot; Their Postmodernist architecture was about the history of architecture . It didn ' t draw_on contemporary life , so it severed itself from a source of vitality. &quot; Unlike New Yorkers , who excavated the architectural past for styles and precedents , the young and irreverent Los Angeles avant-garde looked_to movies , sports_cars , Nintendo games and the ordinary street-side vernacular for inspiration . They browsed the shelves of hardware_stores , cruised plywood racks at lumber yards and ogled the quilted stainless-steel panels of lunch trucks . Their designs did not pretend to be built anywhere else or at any other time . And they did not aspire to sentimentality or cuteness but directly and poetically acknowledged their sites , times and clients in materials assembled from the cityscape . More_than 15 years ago in Venice , designer Brian Murphy reveled in projects with next-to-nonexistent budgets , daring to use declasse corrugated fiberglass and asphalt shingles on facades because the material was cheap and unexpected . Quiet , understated architect Frederick Fisher , practicing a layered collage architecture , made common bathroom tiles and concrete block look original . The buildings were hardly meant to be timeless . The basic notion was not to remake the city in the image of a utopian ideal , but to take_parts of what UCLA classicist and architectural theorist Ann Bergren called &quot; the most deconstructed city in the world &quot; as cues for buildings that do not add_up to balanced wholes . If discontinuity is the urban reality in Los Angeles , then it is realistic to design buildings as pieces . Culver City architect Eric Moss , one of the first to break_into shelter magazines with his own home and the graphically florid Petal House in West Los Angeles , explained the design of one building as a process of taking it apart at all scales -- roof , walls , doors , windows , screws , washers -- and assembling the pieces in different ways : &quot; Apart and back together -- both. &quot; There was a logic to disjunction , and strangeness and beauty in the complex and irrational . Architects were learning to release the Parthenon from their minds and step_out of the Wilshire mainstream into the wilder margins of Venice , Ocean Park and Santa Monica , a petri_dish for this new architecture culture . The 1992 awards were the offspring of the 1980s national design boom and Los Angeles ' prosperity , but even in today ' s troubled local economy , architecture -- like film and art -- remains a point of cultural pride . Architects with small offices need only a_couple_of adventurous clients with an idea or friends with a house requiring an addition . Or , like husband-and-wife team Mark Cigolle and Kim Coleman , architects simply hire themselves to build a cliffhanging statement on_their_own &quot; unbuildable &quot; hillside site . With most of Los Angeles occupied by first-generation buildings , the loosely structured , relatively open metropolis invites additions and replacements more readily than more &quot; finished &quot; cities like New York . Cultural institutions offer other opportunities : The recent break-out installation design for two shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art -- &quot; Expressionist Utopias &quot; and &quot; John Heartfield &quot; -- introduced the radical Viennese firm of Coop Himmelblau , whose Culver City office designed tilted , dancing walls of acrylic and construction board that were as brilliant and daring as the Expressionist work displayed . The installation upped the design ante , challenged conventional notions about neutrality in exhibition design and brought the new architectural thinking to a broader public . &quot; It ' s not the preciousness of materials or even character that ' s bankable now in Los Angeles -- originality is held_in higher esteem , &quot; muses the thoughtful Hodgetts . &quot; What ' s seen as valuable is intellectual property , how even ordinary things are put_together . Los Angeles is , after all , about making a piece of celluloid valuable . Maybe the high level of Frank Gehry ' s executed work has made people see the sky doesn ' t fall. &quot; The design Hodgetts and Fung did for the Temporary Powell -- known on campus as the Towell -- is a throwaway building much valued for its wit on a shoestring : a lightweight structure made from a kit of brilliantly assembled aluminum parts . Lights are suspended like trapezes and steel columns sprout articulate industrial uplights , all under a yellow-and-white big_top of industrial-standard polyester . Buildings have always been status symbols , but L.A. designers changed the perception of architectural prestige and value . A house became not only a house , design not simply a matter of &quot; value added. &quot; Design could provide an enriched environment that enhanced the everyday pleasures of living , looking and thinking , and it could express something about a building ' s creators , owners and times . Some buildings are cultural artifacts , and some are theses , all are objects of imagistic intensity and density , with a heightened visual presence and strong tactile charisma -- an architecture of complexity rather than simplicity that offers the richness of &quot; more &quot; rather than the austerities of &quot; less. &quot; While space in a city like New York collects buildings , it keeps them apart in Los Angeles , and the new breed of buildings that began surfacing here a dozen years ago was a peculiar , almost Darwinian adaptation to L.A. ' s context of fragmentation , dispersal and privacy . Post-suburban Los Angeles , even as it fills_in , is still lax enough to need the charge of these birds_of_paradise and disjunctive enough to absorb their shock . They invigorate the city with a punctual rather than linear urbanism ; they &quot; read &quot; from a passing car . &quot; L.A. has become the cultural repository of a certain kind of building -- the small-scale , low-budget building that allows_for a_level of experiment that much larger buildings don ' t , &quot; notes Bernard Tschumi , dean of the graduate_school of architecture at Columbia University . The buildings resulting from this less-trammeled creativity have become a serious body of architectural work , even though few are large or public . As a class , buildings like the Towell have established a mystique and a romance about Los Angeles that attracts foreign architects and students for whom parts of the city have become exhibitions of contemporary architecture . The American Institute of Architects is holding its national convention here this weekend , and a substantial perk is the opportunity to visit buildings known only through photographs . The L.A. projects honored in New York were not flukes . Los Angeles ' late , great lady of architectural letters , Esther McCoy , credited the city ' s traditional spirit : &quot; L.A. always had a larger population ( than San Francisco ) , it had more thieves and more speculators , and it was livelier from the beginning . It ' s always from these lively places that new design comes. &quot; PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER AMERICAN CITY , LOS Angeles has supported experiments in Modernism , and the brave new forms of the most recent generation add_to an open-ended rosary of buildings that make_up a brilliant , but taken_for granted , architectural tradition in Southern California . Unexpectedly , the tradition was cross-pollinated 25 years ago with L.A. ' s contemporary art scene , with Frank Gehry acting_as the bee . In the 1960s and ' 70s , crisp , open Modernism was dislocated , not by Postmodernist historicism from the East Coast but by the messy vitality emanating from Venice ' s art world . Artists were roughhousing their studios , treating them as objets trouves to be ripped open and rearranged : Studios were works in perpetual progress . The artists -- Ed Moses , Larry Bell , Billy Al Bengston , Robert Irwin , Tony Berlant -- inspired Gehry , Venice ' s architect in spiritual residence , to look_at buildings as hands-on sculpture rather than as the products of flat drawing_boards . In 1978 , he combined many sculptural experiments in his famous house in Santa Monica , a modest two-story , gambrel-roofed bungalow onto which he grafted an addition of corrugated metal and chain-link fencing . Influenced by local artists , he designed skylights that cast light and shadows on interior walls . For his family , the house still worked like any other house , but its visual presence outweighed its function , and design outweighed technique and details . Gehry , who has since remodeled the house , was importing a logic foreign to architecture , one that allowed unmethodical processes to generate design ; he was questioning the boundary between art and architecture . From the 1960s on , painting came_out of the frame and sculpture off the pedestal , eventually migrating into the open landscape . Architects in Los Angeles were designing buildings that could be interpreted as site-specific urban sculpture . A small but slowly widening circle of architects was practicing in the fertile blur between architecture and the arts , generating nonconformist buildings that defied the laws of featureless design blended into common_denominators . For some , the blur extended_to movies . &quot; The icebreaker is somewhere in the entertainment_industry -- more_than architectural theorists and historians , &quot; Hodgetts says , citing the powerful production designs for MTV , which established a precedent for stimulating design . The late production designer Anton Furst , for example , came_off the &quot; Batman &quot; set to design the restaurant Planet Hollywood . Reciprocally , Hollywood called_on architecture when it discovered that special_effects could deliver the power of great buildings to the screen . Visual futurist Syd Mead , who created the look of &quot; Blade Runner , &quot; devised intergalactic megastructures , far more powerful than walk-through sets because of their overwhelming scale . Hollywood ' s notoriously closed movie studio Kremlins opened for architecture : Movie people and architects schmoozed . Hodgetts , who worked as an art_director in film , created buildings with a filmic presence that heightened reality through controlled exaggeration , as in an unrealized hillside house he designed for himself . His cinematic buildings were not so obvious as_to look robotic but seemed to have recently landed , with antennae and dishes and an aura of strangeness . Frank Israel , an Ivy League-trained Rome Prize_winner who moved from New York to teach at UCLA and work in set design , also crossed architecture and film , creating sets that were strongly architectural and buildings that are strongly cinematic . Several independent production companies hired him to design office interiors in cavernous warehouse spaces that he transformed into architectonic wonderlands . Shapes changed unpredictably from different points_of_view , enhanced by chimerical effects of light , shadow and translucency . His high-spirited design also posited that architecture offers the possibility of entertainment -- that buildings need not labor under the Modernist self-delusion that they are to solve global problems . Especially in Hollywood , architecture became a lifestyle choice , and the architect who pushed choice the furthest was the California Fauvist Brian Murphy , whose loose , anything-is-possible attitude put_off his more academic colleagues . A former lifeguard , UCLA art_student and architecture school dropout who turned guerrilla contractor , the T-shirted Murphy redefined the far edge_in L.A. architecture when , in the early 1980s , he designed his Venice studio by throwing the I Ching . Like Duchamp , Murphy invited chance into the studio . He also cultivated spontaneity . In a house he designed in Santa Monica Canyon , he dragged a charred log down the wall on either side of a fireplace , creating a room-size charcoal drawing . Often explaining his designs merely with a chuckle , he went_on to flirt_with the ultimate taboo , bad taste , recently clustering gaudy chandeliers en masse for David Sheffield , screenwriter for &quot; Coming_to America , &quot; and his wife , Cynthia Walker , a poet and editor . The house is comic , with a chandelier grouping that , during tremors , sways in a slow-motion hula . For Murphy , there were no rules , just attitude : &quot; My clients love inviting bosses and colleagues who live_in houses paneled with exotic woods to come_over to see how we ' ve mixed deeply veined marbles with Astroturf , corrugated fiberglass and put a picket_fence around the cat litter box. &quot; Society architects have always designed houses that function as the ultimate social asset , but society at the beach and in the_hills in the 1980s redefined itself , less formally , less seriously , and sometimes with irreverence . Fresh notions about originality and the more relaxed and inquisitive character of nesting baby_boomers were dislocating conventional displays of good taste , elegance and wealth . THE PHENOMENON OF ARCHITECTURE AS ART , ATTITUDE and lifestyle might have been confined to the high-style culture-vulture ghettos of the Westside and the Santa Monica Mountains , except that in the early 1980s , Los Angeles &quot; got &quot; design through its stomach . Restaurants introduced a wider public to avant-garde design at what might be considered a particularly vulnerable moment . &quot; In restaurants , you ' re about to get laid , so you ' re in a receptive mood , &quot; notes Hodgetts . &quot; Some of the good feelings rub off. &quot; Restaurateurs gradually discovered that design helped sell food . The young , hard-working firm of Morphosis in Santa Monica , with Thom Mayne and then-partner Michael Rotondi , went public with its hyper-architecture in a series of restaurants , starting with the corrugated-metal interior of the former L.A. Nicola in Silver Lake , Angeli on Melrose and 72 Market Street in Venice , where people dined under seismic steel rods strapped to a bronze column by Venice sculptor Robert Graham . Morphosis intensified buildings by exaggerating structure , flirting outrageously with steel and breaking the whole down into proliferating numbers of parts , a design tactic that became widespread . Venice restaurateur Bruce Marder hired Gehry to design Rebecca ' s and artist Chuck Arnoldi for DC3 . Michele Saee , who had worked with Morphosis , went_on to design a series of restaurants -- Angeli in Santa Monica and in Marina del Rey -- each venue more elaborate than the last , and all different . Saee , an Iranian-born , Italian-educated architect , was among the first of the second generation branching into what is now a mature and complex genealogical tree of architectural influence . In 1990 , perhaps the first Deconstructivist fast-food outlet anywhere -- a tall , irregular spiral wrapping a two-story structure -- appeared at the corner of Western and Oakwood avenues in Los Angeles . Designed by disciples of Gehry , Jeffrey Daniels and Elyse Grinstein , the Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet was many notches more sophisticated than its self-advertising fast-food design predecessor , the famous but simplistic hot-dog-shaped Tail o ' the Pup in West Hollywood . &quot; People are going_to stop , eat and experience architecture , &quot; Grinstein said . Not much later , a meticulously built and detailed armature resembling a billboard was installed over a simple rectangular structure in Marina del Rey by the L.A. firm Central_Office of Architecture , a small partnership of three young and ferociously intellectual architects . The billboard had no message other_than the name of the now-defunct restaurant tucked_in a corner -- Brix . The armature acted_as a facade and scrim and exploded the scale of the 1 # 200-square-foot restaurant while offering roadside surrealism . Neither Brix nor the KFC building was architecture designed for a rarefied community that collects Warhol Marilyns . It was avant-garde architecture gone populist . Architecture might season haute cuisine for cognoscenti , but it also sold hamburgers . Perhaps the longest leap for L.A. ' s new_wave has been the dozen-mile jump from the Westside into the pin-striped community Downtown , several social_systems away . Restaurants again are proving to be agents of change . In the belly of a skyscraper , among its monumental columns , Michael Rotondi , now head of the Southern California Institute of Architecture , has designed a new Nicola , a Jonah of floor-to-ceiling ribs that carve out comfortable spaces for intimate meals . Several blocks away , motifs that Rotondi designed with Thom Mayne for Westside buildings seem to have influenced the architects who conceived the brushed-metal appointments , lighting_fixtures , railings and elevator doors in the Gas_Company Tower opposite the Central Library -- elevating details to the status of high-tech jewelry . But the greatest force of change Downtown has been the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art , under the direction of Richard Koshalek , who trained as an architect . The museum has actively sponsored architectural shows , including a brilliant assessment of Los Angeles ' postwar Case Study Houses and an exhibit , &quot; Urban Revisions : Current Projects for the Public Realm , &quot; which opened Friday . Koshalek was the guiding spirit in the committee that designated Gehry to design the Walt Disney Concert_Hall , now under construction on Bunker_Hill . &quot; There are so many forces at_work -- the concerns of the community and clients , and just the simple codes -- conspiring against individual expression that it takes tremendous self-confidence to do an interesting building , &quot; says Koshalek , whose museum was designed by the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki and who has greatly raised Los Angeles ' architectural awareness . &quot; Gehry ' s example in Los Angeles encouraged younger architects to have confidence in their own ideas , and their new community of buildings is like a community of individuals . When we interviewed internationally known architects about the influence of the Case Study Houses , we heard time and again how architects everywhere were influenced by them . Now , we ' re starting to hear the same thing again , whether it ' s from architects in Japan or Europe , that the major influence in their work is coming from California. &quot; The potential power of this spirited architecture to capture and define the nature of the city has not been lost on civic_leaders . When newly elected Mayor Richard Riordan sought solutions to the city ' s urban problems , he also looked_to the avant-garde architects as one of its success stories and attended meetings with Gehry in hopes that this creative community could be enlisted to solve problems and enhance the city . He approached the possible coalition of city and architecture from a business point_of_view . To succeed in business , he reasoned , you ' ve got_to be open_to innovation , and innovation comes from the most gifted people . For the city to succeed , it should hire and exploit the area ' s best talents and reduce bureaucratic restrictions . A city can make itself a landmark through its buildings and planning -- the beauty of Parisian buildings , after all , is big box_office . AS IN L.A. GENERALLY , THE CREATIVITY AND RESILIENCE of this growing community resides in its many small studios , so_much more adaptable than large New York-style offices . What started_out as a cluster in the 1970s -- 10 architects designing for each other and indulgent clients , often themselves -- has mushroomed several architectural generations later into an energetic environment , with threescore talented avant-garde firms vigorously pursuing their own muses and clients . Gehry , Hodgetts , Moss , Mayne and Rotondi are uncles and grand-uncles of a second and third generation of like-minded architects , a generation that includes many women , notably Venice-based architect Victoria Casasco and Dagmar Richter , who teaches at UCLA . A large_number of husband-and-wife teams and other couples are the principals of small offices . As a loose group , the architects have attained a critical mass , especially on the Westside , where architects constitute a social force and a miniature star system . What fuels their ambition is the realization that idea-driven buildings economically produced in offices can yield artistic satisfaction . The atelier rather than the corporation is the modus_operandi for architects who prefer to stay hands-on . Especially in these recessionary times , the architects support their independence and artistic integrity by teaching at the Southern California Institute of Architecture , an iconoclastic school that has been the sounding board , employer and advocate for many gifted teachers . Under Dean Richard Weinstein , UCLA has also welcomed avant-garde architects as teachers and graduated_students who now underpin the Westside architecture culture . ( Administrative restructuring , however , now promises to hobble UCLA ' s architecture school. ) For a decade and a half , the buildings of Ocean Park , Santa Monica and especially Venice have opened a dialogue even more varied than the one in Silver Lake during the 1920s and ' 30s . A recently completed two-story office_building by the Santa Monica husband-and-wife firm Mulder Katkov , for example , adds great levity to Abbot Kinney Boulevard , with front corners winging up from the roof to form fluttering clerestory windows . Another Westside husband-and-wife team , Koning Eizenberg , has completed several cost-conscious housing projects nearby on Electric Avenue and Ocean Park , projects that combine standard construction techniques and Modernist lines . These architects practice wherever clients call . Santa Monica designers Daly , Genik recently performed an act of lyrical Deconstructivism inside an existing house in Tarzana , where they bent wood panels into faceted_planes that separate open spaces . A sculptural fireplace with a bright , burnished aluminum surface and a distorted_shape that suggests invisible forces divides the living_room and den . Even large firms have chosen artist / designers rather than executive architects to lead their offices . The 33-year-old Harvard-trained Mehrdad Yazdani , for example , was chief designer at Santa Monica ' s Ellerbe Becket Inc. before moving_on to Dworsky Associates . He is largely responsible_for Ellerbe Becket ' s Metro Rail Red_Line Station at Vermont Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard , a mysteriously floating ellipse that was honored in New York at the Plaza ceremony , and he designed Showscan Prototype Theater-Cinemania , a motion-reality theater at Universal CityWalk , with a folded fiberglass screen on the facade that functions like an electronically liquid marquee . Just as Mayor Riordan has proposed opening the city ' s policies to more enlightened building , UCLA campus architect Charles ( Duke ) Oakley has invited these designers to join mainstream architects on university projects . Permanent new buildings include the east building of the Corrine A . Seeds University Elementary School by Barton Phelps , another Gehry-studio graduate who has emerged as a mature and independent talent . The simply built but complex two-story school successfully humanizes the original buildings by Richard J . Neutra and Robert Alexander and reshapes the campus as a small_town . Near Westwood Village , Wes Jones , along with other partners at Holt Hinshaw Pfau Jones , has turned a power_plant into an intricately complex fugue of steam generators , cooling towers , turbines , chiller pumps , condensers and ammonia tanks . THE ARCHITECTS AS A GROUP SHARE MANY TRAITS , BUT for all_the similarities , they differ in many respects . Gehry and others who have passed_through his office do not design buildings demanding fine craftsmanship or industrial precision . Instead , they often leave materials rough and exposed , cultivating a sense of physical energy . Form displaces craft and detail . Thom Mayne still tailors buildings almost obsessively , depending_on metalsmiths and other craftsmen to fabricate parts . His machine-like images depend_on old-fashioned craft . Even so , seven years ago , a surprising four-story note of dissension was built_on Main_Street amid the casual collection of brat-pack buildings . The strictly geometric steel-and-glass structure , the Marine / Main Center by James Tyler , threw down a classically Modernist gauntlet in the face of buildings designed on a looser premise . A handsome structure in the Miesian less-is-more tradition , the building trumpeted a call_back to Modernist order and cooled the heated designs that were becoming the norm . According to the pendulum theory of architecture -- that design swings back and forth between the mysteries of Gothic styles and the certainties of the Classic -- a Calvinist period should now be challenging the exuberance . The recession also discourages risk . A cautionary critic has emerged in the voice of L.A. author Mike Davis , who has written that architecture is a public art and that the avant-garde fails to communicate to many L.A. constituencies . Often , he says , the city ' s diverse cultural groups consider the buildings hostile and anti-humanistic . Davis has reprimanded Gehry , somewhat unfairly , for turning his buildings away from the public realm and shortchanging what should be a public experience . As perhaps the first knowledgeable and well-reasoned voice of dissension to emerge here in years , Davis gives pause to the enthusiasm . Some self-criticism has also come from within , especially among younger architects who have grown_up in the amnesiac candy_store of the Westside and want to find roots . They are looking_back to Los Angeles ' fine architectural traditions -- to the Modernist classics by Neutra and R.M. Schindler , to the Case Study Houses of the 1940s and ' 50s and to the still-active , creatively monumental John Lautner , a disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright . Susan Lanier of Lubowicki Lanier Architects recently took a client to see Schindler ' s own 1922 house in West Hollywood , a spatially intricate structure built elementally in exposed redwood and concrete . &quot; He used simple materials and let them come_together as they needed , without pretension , &quot; says Lanier . The Case Study Houses and the Pacific Palisades house by Charles Eames , a colorful steel warehouse made of off-the-shelf parts , inspired Marc Angelil and Sarah Graham , partners and spouses , in their own rigorously engineered house in the Hollywood Hills . The two-story building , terraced on a steep hillside , combines steel and wood in an outrigger structure as taut as a sailboat . Its originality is technical . The young architects invented a hybrid wood-and-metal support structure pertinent to a low-rise , quake-prone area . Affordability has been an issue for the avant-garde , even though their architectural flamboyance seems to deny it . In a refreshingly direct house expansion in Brentwood by Robert E . Mangurian and Mary-Ann Ray of Studio Works , the architects simply jacked_up the existing house over an open living loft and studio . A visitor steps into the areas on the ground_floor , and a staircase wends its way up_to the newly decorated rooms of the original wood-frame house on the second floor . So many avant-garde designs are for houses or restaurants that their lessons seem limited in application , if not downright elitist . But in Santa Monica , one of the unsung architects , William Adams , created an original complex of affordable apartments with &quot; masked &quot; facades , whose suggestion of eyes , nose and mouth give the building a strong identity and street presence . The overall organization offers sociable terraces akin to a commons , along with livable layouts . Art Center College of Design in Pasadena has taken_up the issue of industrial housing under the direction of Harvard-trained Steve Diskin -- an obvious issue in a time of homelessness but neglected altogether because of national housing policies in the 1980s . Classes have tried to yoke industrial design and architecture in studies for easy-to-erect temporary shelters , with the riots and earthquake lending a sense of urgency . Last November , yet another wave of powerful new designs was recognized in an architectural awards ceremony , this time by the Los Angeles chapter of the AIA . While the winners included the usual suspects -- Gehry , Moss , Morphosis , Hodgetts and Fung -- less-established firms like Adams and Angelil / Graham broadened the subject_matter . What is remarkable about the avant-garde is that it remains open_to change and criticism . If Los Angeles has lost factories , jobs and a competitive edge_in some industries , the good news is that the city remains a generating center from a cultural point_of_view , and architects are among the leading contributors . The recent AIA awards showcased a unique set of buildings , yet another wave in the ongoing design tsunami emanating from Los Angeles .</TEXT>
