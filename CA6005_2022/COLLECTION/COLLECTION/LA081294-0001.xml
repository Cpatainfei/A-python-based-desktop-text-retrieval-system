   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; A SEARCH FOR TRUTH IN BEAUTY ; ' THE WAITING_ROOM ' TAKES A DISTURBING LOOK_AT SOCIETY ' S VIEW OF ATTRACTIVENESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In &quot; The Waiting Room , &quot; Lisa Loomer ' s fascinating new play_at the Mark Taper Forum , three women await medical attention in a sleek modern office where time has been erased . There ' s Forgiveness From Heaven , a Chinese woman whose toe has fallen_off due_to a foot binding ; Victoria , a corseted Victorian seeking ovariotomy to cure a disease called hysteria ; and Wanda , a sassy blonde party_girl with the timing of a stand-up comic and industrial-size breasts , thanks to the magic of silicone . Wanda ' s implants need adjustment . Part activist , part sitcom writer , Loomer creates a recognizable world that nevertheless defies rational explanation in this smart and disturbing comedy . Why would different cultures eroticize the hobbling of women or the corseting of women ? And why would our culture instill impossible standards of beauty that keep women in a lifelong state of inadequacy ? As a society we now have some understanding of the economic and hierarchical forces that drive this engine , thanks to writers from Thorstein Veblen to Naomi Wolf . Loomer reminds us of_our_own , current , neatly accepted explanations -- at one point , an angry woman at a bar spews the familiar anti-male diatribe , which everyone totally ignores -- and then the playwright asks us to look again at what we do to ourselves without thinking . Loomer provides a new lens on the subject through her great gift for absurdist humor , even as she shifts the burden of evil from men in_general to a male-dominated medical and pharmaceutical industry . And although she is capable of lecturing , Loomer is never shrill . Of course , each of the characters is horrified by the other ' s cultural practices , and each finds her own as natural as breathing , as do the men who help perpetrate them . A Victorian husband ( Simon Templeman ) believes that ovariotomy will cure his high-strung wife , whose desire to learn Greek is considered one of her symptoms . But when he tells her , &quot; I would never let anyone hurt you , &quot; he means it with all his heart . In the play ' s most riveting scene , a brilliant ode to the line between pleasure and pain , Forgiveness ( June Kyoko Lu ) receives her husband ( Jim Ishida ) after a trip from which he ' s brought her silks , spices , his new 11-year-old wife for her to hobble and , most important of all , opium . He unwraps her feet -- which stink so from infection that they cause a servant to hurl in the next room -- as if they were the key to every human erotic impulse . Forgiveness , too , is in raptures . Here Loomer the playwright takes_over completely from Loomer the thinker , and the characters ' motivations escape irresistibly into the mystery of sexuality . Wanda is perhaps the most disturbing character of all . In a stunning performance by Jacalyn O ' Shaughnessy , this is a Holly Golightly who ' s had her cheeks done , as well as her nose , her jaw and her breasts ( three times ) , and yet who has some basic grasp of feminist thinking . Wanda has as much will to stop herself from the surgical pursuit of beauty as most women have to stop applying makeup in the morning . The line between pleasing the opposite sex and pleasing ourselves is as difficult to distinguish as the toxins in the air we breathe , and about as dangerous . Still . * Both Anne Militello ' s lighting and Mark Wendland ' s antiseptic set manage to be witty ; they create a world where doctors ' diplomas are eerily lit from within , and shiny white surfaces can transform from a Chinese love nest to a steam_bath to a hospital_room . David Schweizer directs with equal parts energy and brains , compassion and humor . He gets terrific performances all around ; even in the non-speaking roles ( Jason Reed is a hilarious dancing orderly ) . A Buck Henry look-alike , Robert Picardo progresses impressively from just another callous doctor to one who faces his complicity in an American industry that prizes profits over health . Kurt Fuller is funny as a businessman with ties to the pharmaceutical industry and whose &quot; listening exercises &quot; can ' t disguise that he ' s a complete pig ; Tony Simotes is a moronic FDA agent who looks_up_to him . The women plunge into their roles to dismantle any cliches we might attach_to their characters . Lela Ivey has a wonderful Billie Burke-ish vocal edge as the nervous Victoria , and a peculiar spasm every time she mentions the word husband . I could not stop watching June Kyoko Lu as Forgiveness , particularly when her insane subservience breaks_into fury at the David Letterman show for not doing &quot; Stupid Pet Tricks. &quot; Leah Maddrie plays a number of roles well , including the nurse Brenda , Loomer ' s mouthpiece for statistics and for a direct indictment of the American medical industry that the play probably could have done without . But even in such scenes , Loomer ' s passion abounds . Once she is shorn of her ornamentation , Wanda finally assimilates the truth about herself and her culture that she suspected all along . Looking_at a book of fairy tales , she concludes : &quot; If you ' re old and ugly , you ' re screwed. &quot; When she and Loomer take a moment to envision the possibility that it could all be otherwise , &quot; The Waiting Room &quot; glows with that possibility . And it ' s Loomer ' s gift that she elucidates just what women really are waiting for -- a beautiful sense of self that has nothing to do with magazine ads and is something no surgeon can remove . * &quot; The Waiting Room , &quot; Mark Taper Forum , Music Center , 135 N .
