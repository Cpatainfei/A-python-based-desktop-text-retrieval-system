   <HEADLINE> THERE ' S TROUBLE BRUIN ; VANCOUVER ' S HILLSIDE COMMUNITIES FACE A GROWING PROBLEM WITH ROVING BEARS , BUT EVEN RELOCATION PROGRAMS DON ' T HAVE WORRIED RESIDENTS OUT OF THE WOODS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The streets are strangely quiet . But then most residents of this hockey-crazed city are indoors , watching the Vancouver Canucks try to gain_ground against the New York Rangers in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup_finals . On Millstream Lane , high above town , a lone jogger is chugging along under a lingering Vancouver twilight . Brian Mills , 50 , a longtime resident in the affluent British Properties neighborhood of West Vancouver , is still a fair distance from home , but he plans to make_it well before nightfall -- and before the start of the second_period . &quot; I don ' t jog anymore at night , &quot; Mills says , taking_a_breather . Nor do many others in West Vancouver . Or in the nearby North Vancouver District . Black_bears have awakened from hibernation and until next fall , the two hillside communities , collectively referred to as the North Shore , will be among the haunts of the large and potentially dangerous animals . Children won ' t be allowed out alone at night . Dogs and cats won ' t be safe . Garbage_cans will be particularly vulnerable . And urban Southern California thinks it has wild animal problems ? These neighborhoods , as well as a_few others backed_up against the dense British_Columbia wilderness , have gone_to the animals . Black_bears -- and to a lesser extent cougars -- are taxing not only the nerves of residents but employees of the_British Ministry of Environment , Land and Parks , who are operating_on a limited budget and are under extreme pressure to relocate , rather than destroy , problem bears whenever possible . In 1992 , the last year for which figures are available , there were nearly 400 complaints of black_bears in neighborhoods from residents of the North Shore and the nearby communities in the Coquitlam and Port Moody areas . Thirty-five bears were destroyed , 27 relocated . There were more_than 700 complaints in Region II , which includes Vancouver and several surrounding cities . Cougar sightings are not as common , because they move_in and out of the neighborhoods like phantoms in the night . But they have been known to chase children on bicycles in daylight , to maul one on occasion . And they have used their stealth to take many_a family pet . &quot; The cougars have basically denuded this area of cats and dogs , &quot; Mills says . &quot; One of my neighbors across the street . . . there was an infant sitting next to a cat , and this cougar came_out of the bush and took the cat . It could have just as easily taken the kid. &quot; Dennis Pemble , an animal control specialist with BC Environment , tracks problem bears and cougars on such a regular basis that he drives_around with hounds in his truck , taking calls_on his cellular_telephone . Pemble is_on call 24 hours a day . He says in one instance a woman was walking with a small dog , and when she stopped and reached down to pet the animal , &quot; The cougar brushed her hand away and took the dog. &quot; * Vancouver ' s problem is similar to Southern California ' s in one respect : the inroads being made by civilization into the wilderness . Greater Vancouver ' s population is growing by about 35 # 000 annually . But what is unique about Vancouver ' s situation , particularly at the North Shore and around Coquitlam and Port Moody , is that the wilderness above the houses is mostly protected watersheds , which provide the city with water -- and the bears and cougars and other wild animals with ideal habitat free_of hunters and campers . Several creeks and a_few trails give the animals easy access to paved streets . &quot; The development areas are really true wilderness areas that are not used by humans ( although there are some hiking trails and a regulated logging effort ) , &quot; said Bob Forbes , a wildlife biologist with BC Environment . &quot; That allows the wildlife to infiltrate , for want of a better term , right into the urban_areas . They just come right through the whole system . So we have high numbers of human contacts in these areas. &quot; Mills has lived_in the_British Properties neighborhood for 20 years but only recently moved to the top street , where he enjoys a spectacular view of the city and the waterways that surround Vancouver . Last summer , a bear trampled his vegetable_garden and tore_apart a large plastic compost maker in his back yard , he said , adding : &quot; The year before that , my oldest_boy ( now 13 ) went_out for the newspaper . It was a bright and sunny morning , about 11 a.m. , but there was this big old bear ambling down the middle of the road . &quot; Another time , last spring , I was hiking in ( nearby ) Capilano Regional Park , and when I headed back , there were bear scats on my trail . I don ' t know if he was following me or what. &quot; Wetzel Mayr , 69 , a resident in the North Vancouver District , says she has not seen a bear in 31 years here . &quot; But I ' ve heard of them taking swims in people ' s pools , &quot; she says . Pemble says bears have entered garages , broken windows of cars and homes , and in some instances entered the homes themselves . &quot; One time a woman opened her front_door , walked outside and saw a mother bear and a cub in her front_yard , &quot; Pemble says . &quot; She went_back inside and closed the door , and there was the second cub on her counter eating an apple. &quot; * Black_bears are shy by nature , and there have been few attacks in Greater Vancouver . There are no estimates of the number of bears around the city , but their populations are considered healthy . And at the rate at which humans are invading their territory , BC Environment says it is concerned about the potential for danger . &quot; Bears are a bona_fide threat to public safety , &quot; Forbes says , adding that the animals , which range_in size from 150 to more_than 400 pounds , may be shy but they are very strong . They don ' t like being surprised , and they become agitated when someone tries to take something they want . In the last three years , the complaints about black_bears have so deluged BC Environment offices during spring and summer that officials have had to decide which calls to investigate . &quot; If it ' s a bear that ' s just walking through a back yard , it ' s not an issue , &quot; Forbes says . &quot; If it ' s a bear that returns to somebody ' s property two or three times or a bear that ' s just hanging_around , we do one of two things : The bear is either captured and moved , or destroyed. &quot; But tagging and moving the bears is expensive and time-consuming , and the ones that are moved -- to distances up_to 80 miles -- seem to be showing_up in the same neighborhood or similar ones at an increasing rate . &quot; We ' re just playing musical bears , &quot; says Jim Rissling , a BC Environment senior conservation officer based in Chilliwack . The percentage of bears showing_up somewhere else after being moved was 8 % in 1992 . Rissling says that when numbers are tabulated for 1993 and ' 94 , &quot; I think you ' ll see a much higher average. &quot; Some wildlife experts say there ' s a simpler solution : Kill more bears . &quot; It used to be we ' d have a really bad year and we ' d go and destroy a lot of bears , &quot; Rissling says . &quot; I remember when we ' d have 3 # 500 complaints in this region and we went_out and destroyed 350-something bears . That would reduce the population and it would take_five or six years for the population to gradually build_up , and then we would destroy a bunch more. &quot; But these days such logic doesn ' t work , as the Azusa Police_Department learned when it used shotguns to gun_down a black_bear in that San Gabriel Mountains foothill community last month . Pemble says : &quot; If we wanted to cut_back on the problem , we could thin_out the bear population . But the public does not want that , nor will it let us do it. &quot; * Mills has finished jogging , and darkness is falling_in Vancouver . Pemble has set traps to try to capture the mother of two bear_cubs caught the previous day near a logging camp about 10 miles away . The mother will be captured by morning , as will a large male that wanders into one of the traps . All four bears will be ear-tagged and moved to another stretch of wilderness about 80 miles away . It could be only a matter of time before any of them show_up in somebody else ' s neighborhood , or even back at the North Shore . Down the road from Mills ' house , at the end of Pinecrest Drive , lots have been carved into a stand of trees that were once home to bears , cougars and other animals . The exclusive estates , behind a guarded gate , will sell for millions . The view of the city will be breathtaking . But the residents will have to watch their backs .</TEXT>
