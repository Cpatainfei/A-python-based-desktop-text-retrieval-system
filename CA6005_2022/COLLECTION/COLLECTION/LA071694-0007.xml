   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; FRANCE ' S BIG GAMBLE PAYS OFF IN RWANDA ; AFRICA : SKEPTICS HAD FELT PEACE MISSION COULD HAVE BEEN ' ANOTHER SOMALIA. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The experts doubted it would work . They suspected the_French would take sides . And they spoke darkly of &quot; another Somalia , &quot; from where U.S. troops had been forced by American public_opinion to beat an ignominious retreat . But three weeks ago , as the United States and every_other nation did little more_than wring their hands about the ethnic bloodletting in Rwanda , France airlifted 2 # 500 of its young sons and daughters in uniform into the heart of the Central African conflict . Now , the decisive French gamble , in sharp contrast to the American action in Somalia in 1992 , appears to have already paid_off . French troops have , without a single French casualty , been able to prevent at least some ethnic killing in western parts of the country . Most of the fighting has ended with a rebel takeover of the capital , Kigali . And now the_French , still holding to their &quot; humanitarian mission , &quot; are appealing for help for several million displaced people . The reason the_French have succeeded , thus far , is linked to this country ' s colonial past -- and present -- in Africa , its self-image of a world leader , the strong support from the_French public and a long penchant for intervening on the African continent without apologies . &quot; France sees itself as a world_power , &quot; Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur explained in a recent television interview . &quot; This is its ambition and its honor , and I wish for it to preserve this ambition. &quot; Part of the impetus for the armed intervention in Rwanda may have less to do with power and more to do with guilt . A broad spectrum of the_French public has supported the intervention , but for widely different reasons . Some saw it as an opportunity to make amends for France ' s support of dictators across Africa , not the least among them Rwanda ' s late president , Juvenal Habyarimana . The Hutu strongman came_to power in a 1973 coup and quickly won military backing from France . When his plane , a gift from the_French government , was shot down April 6 , his death reignited the genocidal war between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis . But others in France considered the intervention a golden opportunity to re-exert French influence in the tiny , densely populated nation , by saving lives and protecting their friends in the Rwandan government . &quot; The French have a long tradition of getting involved in Africa , and they ' ve gotten involved for much less worthy causes , on behalf of all sorts of skunks without there being the least hue_and_cry back home , &quot; said a non-French Western diplomat with long experience in Francophone Africa . Of course , during the Cold_War years the United States also helped_out notorious dictators , including the late Samuel K . Doe , who ruthlessly ruled Liberia , and Mobutu Sese Seko , who has siphoned_off millions from the impoverished people of Zaire . But France , alone among the former colonial rulers in Africa , has maintained military as well as political links with its former colonies and other French-speaking countries , such_as the former Belgian colony of Rwanda . Over the years , French troops have rushed to Senegal , Gabon , Chad , Zaire , the Central_African_Republic , the Comoros and Togo to easily put_down unseemly uprisings and keep friendly rulers in_charge . But in Rwanda , the politics for France are more complicated . Some in the United Nations were squeamish about giving France the OK to intervene , and five Security_Council members abstained_from the vote , because of France ' s deep , often-secret previous ties with the Hutu government . Since 1975 , France had a military agreement with the Rwanda government and it welcomed generals into the most prestigious French military_academies . The government ' s main opponents were in a Tutsi rebel movement , known as the Rwandan Patriotic Front , which was based in Uganda , a former British colony . Many of its rebel leaders , driven into exile in the 1960s and 1970s , received their military_training in Britain . When French troops arrived in Rwanda last month , the rebels were advancing on Kigali , which was still held by the government . And the_French government believed that the victims of the killing were about evenly divided between Hutus and Tutsis . To their surprise , though , they discovered that the wave of genocide had been started primarily by the Hutu-dominated government . And French soldiers found themselves facing hundreds of thousands of Tutsis fleeing Hutus . The French also originally thought they could save the Hutu-dominated government from defeat by the rebels . But when the rebels took_control of Kigali , the thinking in France changed . President Francois Mitterrand declared that the rebels &quot; are not our enemies , and we are not trying to prevent them from winning the civil war. &quot; That marked a turning point in the_French intervention . French officials , after negotiations with the new leaders , carved out a &quot; safe zone &quot; in the southwest , and the_French vowed this week to keep armed militia from the old government out . For their part , the Tutsi-led rebels have picked a Hutu as the prime_minister as a gesture of reconciliation in the country . And although the new leaders still distrust the_French , they appear to have decided to tolerate the foreign soldiers for now in the interests of peace . On Friday , though , they increased France ' s diplomatic discomfort by demanding that the_French arrest Hutu government leaders hiding behind their troops in southwestern Rwanda . The French said they would consult with the United Nations about the demand . Serious questions remain , meantime , about the rebels ' ability to bring democracy to Rwanda . They represent less than 15 % of the population , and any free election could drive them from power . Even as the rebels celebrate their apparent victory , some fighting in rural_areas continues and the humanitarian disaster is escalating alarmingly . Aid agencies say upward of 1 million displaced people roam the hilly countryside ; more_than 500 # 000 have crossed the western border into Goma , Zaire . The U.N. mandate for the_French deployment runs_out Aug . 21 , and the United Nations has promised to replace the troops with a force drawn mostly from other African_countries .</TEXT>
