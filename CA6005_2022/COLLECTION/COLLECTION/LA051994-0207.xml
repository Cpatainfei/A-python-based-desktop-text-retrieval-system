   <HEADLINE> ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH : EXECUTIVE TRAVEL / SPOTLIGHT ON TAIWAN ; TIPS FOR TAIWAN : DON ' T FORGET BUSINESS_CARDS -- OR UMBRELLA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taiwan , although it has limited official diplomatic relations , is one of the busiest trade and manufacturing centers in East Asia . The island ' s location -- near Japan , Korea , Hong Kong , the Philippines and mainland_China -- and the fact that it has one of the busiest airports in Asia make_it easily accessible to business_travelers . Getting There Both a passport and a visa are required to visit Taiwan . Visas for up_to 60 days are free and can be obtained by contacting the Coordination Council for North_American Affairs in Los Angeles at ( 213 ) 389-1215 . Business_travelers are usually headed to Taipei on the northern part of the island , the country ' s center of commerce and its largest city . Industry in Taipei is primarily electronics and computers , said James Yu , spokesman for the nation ' s Coordination Council in Los Angeles . Taiwan maintains no formal consulate . Other major business destinations include Kaohsiung in the south , a harbor city convenient for export and import . The country ' s heavy manufacturing is concentrated in this area . Taichung , between Taipei and Kaohsiung , is a center for service_industries such_as real_estate and banking . Major Asian airlines , including China Airlines , Cathay Pacific , Korean Airlines , Philippine Airlines and Singapore Airlines , as well as U.S. carriers Northwest and Continental , fly into Taiwan . International_flights go_to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport , about 45 minutes outside of Taipei in Taoyuan . There is shuttle service to the older Sung-Shan domestic airport near downtown Taipei . Domestic Travel For travel within the country there are two domestic airlines : China Airlines and Far East Air Transport . There are about two_dozen 40-minute flights daily between Taipei and Kaohsiung . Once in Taiwan , it is best to rely_on taxi drivers , according to Yu . &quot; Traffic is very , very bad , particularly in Taipei , &quot; he said . Cabdrivers , who operate with meters and don ' t expect a tip ( although it is customary to let the driver keep the change ) , can get you where you ' re going more quickly than you could on_your_own , Yu said . Car rental is relatively expensive , and a Taiwanese driver ' s license is required if you are staying longer than two months . Drive on the right side of the road . Climate Taiwan is subtropical , with rain heaviest from April to August . Typhoons are a risk in summer and fall . A sweater or light coat may be needed from late fall to early spring . Snow occasionally falls_in the mountains in midwinter . Security In contrast to some_other Asian destinations , traveler ' s checks are widely accepted throughout Taiwan , Yu said . Note that banking hours are 9 a.m to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday , 9 a.m. to noon Saturdays . Taiwan is generally considered a safe place for foreigners to visit . According to the U.S. State_Department , the crime_rate is low . Theft is the most common crime affecting foreigners . Any theft -- of a passport in particular -- should be reported both to the local police and the American Institute in either Taipei or Kaohsiung . The American Institute in Taiwan is authorized to serve U.S. citizens as an embassy , as there is no embassy in Taiwan . Foreign businesses have occasionally been the subject of extortion attempts . Get recorded travel information from the State_Department ' s Bureau of Consular Affairs ( ( 202 ) 647-5225 ) before planning a trip . Travelers who register at the American Institute once they arrive will receive up-to-date security information . As in all foreign travel , U.S. citizens are subject_to the laws of the country they are visiting . Taiwan ' s laws on possession or sale of drugs carry stiff sentences and large fines . Customs When doing business in Taiwan , be sure to have business_cards bearing your name and title , Yu said . It ' s customary to exchange such cards with the person you are meeting . Although it is not customary to bring a gift to a first meeting with a new business associate , one is welcomed if you know the business contact well . Lodgings Since the late 1970s , Taiwan has seen rapid economic_growth , and with it has come a buildup in hotels . Major cities now have a number of quality business hotels . For example , in Taipei , business_travelers can stay_at the Hilton International Taipei ( 38 Chung-Hsiao W . Road , Sec . 1 ; ( 02 ) 311-5151 ) or the Lai-Lai Sheraton ( 12 Chung-Hsiao E . Road , Sec . 1 ; ( 02 ) 321-5511 ) . For those who prefer a traditional Chinese atmosphere but still want business amenities , Yu recommends the Grand Hotel , a Taipei landmark that resembles an ancient Chinese palace ( 1 Chung-Shan N . Road , Sec . 4 ; ( 02 ) 596-5565 ) . In Kaohsiung , there is the Ambassador Hotel ( 202 Min-Sheng 2nd Road ( 07 ) 211-5211 ) , or the Grand Hotel ( 2 Yuan-Shan Road , Cheng-Hing Lake , ( 07 ) 383-5911 ) . While staying in hotels , be aware that although most staff_members speak some English , they may_not understand your requests even if they indicate they do . When in doubt , ask the hotel for an interpreter . Because of Japan ' s 50-year occupation of Taiwan , some older Taiwanese speak Japanese . Most hotels and restaurants in Taiwan add a 10 % service_charge to bills , so tips are not required .</TEXT>
