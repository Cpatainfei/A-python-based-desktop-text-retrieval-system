   <HEADLINE> MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK : TRAGEDY PREVAILED DURING THE ' 94 SEASON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As they are in most years , the champions -- Dale Earnhardt , Al Unser Jr. , Michael Schumacher , Steve Kinser , John Force and others -- were worthy winners , some even record setters , but 1994 will be forever remembered in motor racing for its downside . The deaths of Neil Bonnett , one of stock_car racing ' s most beloved personalities , and rookie driver Rodney Orr on the first weekend of qualifying for the Daytona 500 last February set the tone for a long season in which Formula One drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger and sprint car champion Robbie Stanley died in racing accidents . And that ' s not to mention the possibly career-ending head injuries suffered by Ernie Irvan and Page Jones . Senna ' s death , the result of a single-car crash on May 1 during the San Marino Grand Prix in Italy , ended the career of one of racing ' s greatest drivers , certainly the finest road racer of his era . The brilliant Brazilian had won three world championships and was expected to win many_more before his car shot off the track at 190 m.p.h. and smashed head-on into a guard rail . He was 34 . Formula One never recovered from the shocking loss of its biggest attraction , its most tragic event since Jimmy Clark ' s death in 1968 . The Formula One season was almost as confusing as it was tragic . For years , NASCAR has been accused of keeping Winston Cup races competitive by &quot; throwing a NASCAR yellow_flag &quot; at some opportune moment under the guise of &quot; debris on the track &quot; or &quot; track inspection. &quot; The gimmick was to bunch_up the cars , bring the leader back to the pack and restore the image of competition . Formula One took that a step further . Instead of bunching_up cars in a single race , FIA tried to artificially establish a season points race between Schumacher and Damon Hill by disqualifying Schumacher in one race , banning him from two more and then disqualifying him after he had won yet another . And what had Schumacher done ? In the first instance , he passed Hill , the pole-sitter , on the pace_lap , even though the cars would then come_to a dead stop before the race started . For that he drew a black_flag -- ordering him in_for consultation -- which he temporarily ignored , which led to the two-race ban . In the second instance , the German driver ' s Benetton had a wooden skid block -- like a bed slat -- beneath the car that was a fraction of an inch too thick . After all_of this , the season that had seemed over because Schumacher had won seven of the first nine races came_down to a shootout between him and Hill at the final race in Australia . When they crashed together and neither finished , Schumacher won his first championship by a single point , a fitting end to a bizarre season . Earnhardt , voted American driver of the year , and Unser were runaway winners of this country ' s two most prestigious series , Winston Cup and Indy cars . Earnhardt , whose seventh championship brought him even with the legendary Richard Petty , dedicated his season to Bonnett , his closest friend and hunting partner . Earnhardt collected $ 3.4 million for the year . A high point was the running of the Brickyard 400 , the first non-Indy car_race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway . More_than 300 # 000 fans watched as the stock_car drivers waged one of the most exciting finishes in the speedway ' s storied history before youthful Jeff Gordon , an Indiana product , beat Irvan to the checkered flag . Unser put a victory in the Indy 500 together with seven other triumphs in winning the PPG Cup driver ' s championship as Roger Penske-owned cars finished 1-2-3 in five races and the series championship standings . Nigel Mansell , the 1993 champion , did not win a race and at season ' s end announced he was returning to his native England and Formula One , whose title he won in 1992 . Kinser , in World of Outlaws sprint cars , and Force , in a drag racing funny car , kept doing what they do best -- winning . Kinser claimed his 14th championship by winning 29 main events and , after stunning the racing world with an upset in the International Race of Champions , announced he was leaving sprint cars to race Winston Cup stock_cars in 1995 . Force won his fourth National Hot Rod Assn . championship with 10 event victories that pushed him past Don ( Snake ) Prudhomme as funny car_racing ' s winningest driver . He also ran 303.95 m.p.h. at Pomona for a funny car record . Prudhomme spiced the year by winning three races plus the Winston Invitational on his retirement tour . Other champions of note included Scott Pruett in Trans-Am , Steve Millen in the Exxon GTS series , Millen ' s brother Rod in Mickey Thompson Grand_National trucks , Steve Robertson in Indy Lights , Paul Choiniere in SCCA Pro Rally , David Empringham in Formula Atlantic , Tony Stewart in USAC midgets , Mike Chase in Winston West stock_cars and Scott Kalitta and Dale Alderman in drag racing ' s top fuel and pro stock classes .</TEXT>
