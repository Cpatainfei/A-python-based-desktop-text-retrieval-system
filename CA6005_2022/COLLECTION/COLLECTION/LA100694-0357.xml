   <HEADLINE> RUMOR OF A SUITOR RIPENS APPLE STOCK ; COMPUTERS : SPECULATION THAT MOTOROLA MAY ATTEMPT TO TAKE_OVER THE COMPANY SENDS SHARES SOARING 12 % . BUT SOME SEE AN EQUITY INVESTMENT INSTEAD OF A BUYOUT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The stock of Apple Computer Inc. soared 12 % on Wednesday on speculation that the company will be the subject of a takeover_attempt by Motorola Inc. , its partner in the PowerPC chip venture . Despite official and somewhat surly &quot; no comments &quot; from both companies , investors bid up the price of Apple stock by $ 4.125 a share to $ 37.875 on Nasdaq , with 6.3 million shares changing hands . Motorola stock fell $ 1 to $ 50 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Takeover speculation boiled_over after Motorola , based in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg , disclosed plans to build a low-cost line of desktop_computer systems , including personal_computers , to boost demand for its flashy PowerPC microprocessor . The fact that Motorola supplies the chips for Apple ' s fledgling Power Macintosh computers -- and that it wants to become a PC manufacturer itself -- apparently led some stock_traders to conclude that Motorola might buy Apple to gain an instant foothold . Another scenario has Motorola making an equity investment in Apple and gaining a license to build &quot; clones &quot; of the Power Macintosh . Several industry_analysts said they doubt a takeover is likely . &quot; It doesn ' t make that much sense to me , &quot; said Bruce Lupatkin , research_director at Hambrecht &amp; Quist , a San Francisco investment_firm . * For starters , Lupatkin said , Apple appears to have turned itself around after a_couple_of rocky years , and &quot; I ' m not sure they need a marriage partner. &quot; And for Motorola , he noted , there would be cheaper ways of getting_into the PC manufacturing_business , given that a strategic buyer would be forced to pay upward of $ 8 billion for Apple , by his estimate . Lupatkin expects Apple to report soon that earnings in its fourth quarter , which ended last month , reached 65 cents a share on $ 2.3 billion in sales . That would contrast with a profit of 2 cents a share on sales of $ 2.1 billion in the same period the year before . Pieter Hartsook , publisher of a Macintosh market newsletter in Alameda , agreed that Apple would frown_on the idea of becoming another company ' s wholly owned subsidiary . However , he noted that Motorola would logically be one of a handful of companies to license Apple ' s computing technology and produce clones . Last month , Apple announced long-awaited plans to stop hoarding its technology and let others produce Macs . &quot; Apple needs a large , U.S.-based multinational corporation to announce as a licensee , &quot; Hartsook said , adding that having a stronger strategic relationship &quot; makes an awful lot of sense. &quot; In recent years , Motorola has become one of the nation ' s most successful technology companies , with a strong presence in the computer chip business and a dominant position in cellular_telephone equipment and pagers . When Wall_Street frothed last year with speculation about an Apple takeover , AT &amp; T was the rumored buyer . But AT &amp; T ' s announcement of a megamerger with McCaw Cellular served to squelch most of those rumors . Even so , in the trading frenzy Wednesday , AT &amp; T ' s name resurfaced as a possible suitor , although few analysts took that prospect seriously .</TEXT>
