   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON RACE HATRED ; FOR GENTILES , TOO , THE HOLOCAUST IS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN ; THIS SINGULAR CRIME IS NOT A JEWISH PROBLEM BUT A EUROPEAN PROBLEM , THE APEX OF CENTURIES OF CROSS-CULTURAL HATREDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The great irony is that people discover race hate the way lovers discover love . It always seems utterly new and fresh to the hater , who like the lover feels that he has invented the emotion . And like love , race hate always expresses itself in the same cliches uttered as if the hater had discovered the principles of the universe . &quot; They take our jobs. &quot; &quot; They ' re everywhere. &quot; &quot; They lust_after our women. &quot; &quot; They ' re just too damn different. &quot; Racism is as human as love . In defining ourselves , the tribe we belong_to , its mores , we are tempted to believe_in the inferiority of the culture and mores of other groups . Prejudice is the hairy backside of what we all need : a sense of identity . Sometimes , the more grand the cultural identity , the greater is the temptation to racism . The officers of the Einsatzgruppen , the SS killing squads , all loved their Mozart and their Goethe . Often , particularly in America , race hate or group hate seems rootless , as in the now famous case of the two young_men who attacked a Vietnamese stroller in Laguna Beach because they thought he was gay . It did not seem that the young_men had any measurable reason , any damage they could point to or quantify , to explain why they wanted to beat the hell out of either Asians or gays . Did America ' s war experiences provide them with a primitive spur ? The AIDS epidemic ? A long bow to draw to believe that their own immune_systems would somehow be strengthened by assaulting a perhaps-gay Vietnamese beach-walker . We often righteously sneer at the racial and religious violence in Northern_Ireland and in the Balkans , but hate in both these cases is based on versions of history and measurable blood spilled in the past . There is more_than legend to what the Serbs and Croatians did to each other since the Middle_Ages , and to what Bosnian Muslims may once have done under Turkish rule . Catholics and Protestants in Northern_Ireland can similarly point to historic massacres , even though they may be written too simple-mindedly into their respective maps of the world and their folk_songs . In all cases , the hate is merely augmented rather than caused by religious difference . But at least the Northern Irish Catholics can point to very real injustices and miseries they have suffered . Protestants can point to their own heap of bodies , the real fear of IRA gunmen and of being absorbed into a Republic of Eire in which their civil_rights may be curtailed for the sake of Catholic doctrine . Race hate in America is not often based on any real disadvantage suffered by the hater . It is based on stereotypes or rumor . But that ' s all_the serpent in the gut needs to start secreting its poison . Over every question of race or group hate lies the shadow of the Holocaust , and for the moment the Holocaust questions are associated with Steven Spielberg ' s film of my book . As a Gentile , an Australian of Irish Catholic background , I have no hesitation in saying that the Holocaust should be talked_about again and again and should not be forgotten . The reason is that the Holocaust is the most extreme version of rootless race hate in European history . Classic European anti-Semitism was based more on the idea that the Jews had killed Christ and were engaged in an anti-European philosophic and financial conspiracy than on any measurable harm done to Europe . No one could point to Jewish massacres of Christians , though in Poland and Germany vague but intense hate was able to be engineered into blaming Jews for the economic problems of both countries . But who could say , my mother was raped by a Jew , my father hanged by one ? The SS mastered the ultimate challenge of genocide : If you get the hated group where you want them -- behind wire -- how do you ensure that your now- perfected kingdom isn ' t sullied by too many corpses lying_around and giving mute evidence of what happened to them ? It ' s a question of processing the hated group . The Nazis devised the most bureaucratic , most extreme , most technological means of doing that . No question that the Cambodian tyrant Pol Pot would have loved to have been able to organize such methods to punish those of_his_own people who lacked &quot; political correctness. &quot; No question that the tyrant Mengistu of Ethiopia would have loved to have been able to apply a final solution to the Eritreans of the Horn of Africa . But the Nazis really did_it , and they were Europeans . As a European who grew_up very far from the scene , I don ' t feel uselessly guilty about that , but I feel amazed and appalled . On a recent Sunday in Chicago , I met an elderly couple , the Schlesingers . A tall , sober-looking man and a small-boned , extremely handsome woman , they had been prisoners in Oskar Schindler ' s work_camps . It struck me again , the ridiculous idea to which all_the resources of the Reich were devoted -- the idea that European civilization and the Schlesingers could not be allowed to coexist . The Schlesingers , urbane and pleasant as they are , could not be permitted to go_on breathing . Only Schindler ' s intervention and their own intelligence ensured that they did continue to breathe . Maybe one shouldn ' t be surprised , since the racist always talks in terms of mass extermination . The last station on the hate line in his head is always something like Auschwitz , which stands as the most graphic instance of the kind of place to which hatred takes people . And now the further great irony is that Jews like Steven Spielberg are actually blamed for remembering , for reviving the memory that is not only Jewish but human . The Jews , we are told by the haters , remember their disasters in a particularly and hatefully Jewish way . And what about the fact that the Israeli right_wing uses the Holocaust as a sanction for the persecution of Palestinians ? Instead of addressing that real political problem , let ' s work_on forgetting the Holocaust as fast as we can . Christians are allowed to remember the crucifixion of their Messiah , which occurred some time in the first century A.D. ; Jews should be disqualified from remembering their dead of 1939-1945 because they are too good at it , too damn . . . Jewish ! But the Holocaust remains for me not a Jewish problem but a European one . The Germans themselves are grappling with a conflict about this among their historians -- how to fit this unique event into German history , into the German and European imagination . And that is not the Jews ' fault . It is the fault of Europe , which has pursued anti-Semitism consistently since the Middle_Ages and has still not yet repented of it . It is the grand Europe that all us people from the new_world love to visit and rightly admire that brought race hate to its ultimate conclusion . That is why it is important for Gentiles to retain the memory of the Holocaust , and to receive the warnings inherent in it .</TEXT>
