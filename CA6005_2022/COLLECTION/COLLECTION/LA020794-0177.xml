   <HEADLINE> U.S. TEAMS RUSH TO EVACUATE 125 SHELLING VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> American medical teams swept into Sarajevo on Sunday to help evacuate civilians injured when a powerful mortar shell smashed into a crowded marketplace , killing 68 people . As the international community debated how to respond to Saturday ' s attack , the bloodiest since Bosnia-Herzegovina ' s civil_war began , three U.S. military cargo planes and an International Red_Cross IL-76 jet ferried victims to safety and treatment in Germany and Italy . By day ' s end , more_than 125 people had been evacuated , including some wounded and sick who had been waiting for months for a chance to leave for outside hospitals . Kris Janowski of the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees said the overwhelming response &quot; was proportionate to the barbarity of what happened. &quot; &quot; Everyone in Sarajevo was moved by the speed of the response , &quot; Janowski said . &quot; It ' s hard to come_up with a scale of outrage . But ( the attack ) was at the top of the scale of outrage. &quot; The evacuations followed the firing of a 120-millimeter shell into a marketplace jammed with shoppers lured outside during good_weather to replenish their meager provisions . The attack left more_than 200 wounded . The outpouring of anger and grief continued Sunday as families and friends of the dead streamed to the marketplace to weep and lay flowers at the bloodstained site . U.N. officials examined the crater but failed to pinpoint which of Bosnia ' s warring parties was responsible_for the attack . The Muslim-led government blamed the Bosnian Serb artillery gunners surrounding the city . The Serbs denied the charge . &quot; The crater analysis has been done , and we ' ve got nothing more to say on that right now , &quot; said Matthew Nerzig , a U.N. spokesman . Although Nerzig said U.N. experts had been able to determine that the shell was fired from north to northeast of the market , &quot; if we were able to pinpoint ( its origin ) we would do so. &quot; On Sunday , the United Nations ' top civilian official for the former Yugoslav federation , Yasushi Akashi , arrived in Sarajevo on a mission to negotiate a truce . He met with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Bosnia ' s Muslim president , Alija Izetbegovic , but could not reach an agreement on a cease-fire and the monitoring of weapons around Sarajevo . Akashi said an emergency meeting of the Security_Council may be held_in the next two days . Peace talks among Bosnia ' s warring Muslims , Serbs and Croats are scheduled to resume Thursday in Geneva . Meanwhile , the international community scrambled to find an appropriate response to the scenes of tragedy and gore . U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization to approve air strikes on artillery positions around Sarajevo , a senior U.N. official said late Sunday . Belgian , French , Turkish and Italian leaders were among those who had earlier voiced support for the strikes . But others said peace cannot be imposed militarily on the former Yugoslav republic . British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd warned that a retaliatory air strike may yield &quot; simply one day of satisfaction . . . followed not by the lifting of the siege but by its intensification. &quot; European Union peace envoy Lord Owen spoke out against air strikes for fear the United Nations would then be drawn into the war . Meanwhile , humanitarian organizations were able to use the media attention directed at Sarajevo to assist some of those suffering . Western governments and international aid agencies , moved by the grisly scenes on television screens , were able to cut_through the red_tape that has impeded previous evacuations . This operation , said Ron Redmond , a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency , moved at &quot; the speed of light. &quot; Many of the evacuees were headed for the U.S. air_base at Ramstein , Germany , and treatment at a nearby medical_center in Landstuhl . Others were taken_to medical facilities in Italy .</TEXT>
