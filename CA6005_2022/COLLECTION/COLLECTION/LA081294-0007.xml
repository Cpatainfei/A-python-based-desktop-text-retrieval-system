   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; LIVELY COMING-OF-AGE STORY IN ' MODE ' WORLD OF PARIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; A la Mode , &quot; which marks a winning feature debut for French writer-director Remy Duchemin , is a warm , funny and inspired coming-of-age comedy set_in an old Jewish quarter of Paris during the ' 60s . Our hero , bright , skinny 17-year-old Fausto ( Ken Higelin ) , lives in a vast old orphanage , but his prospects are about to brighten considerably . that ' s because it ' s time for Fausto to learn a trade , and he has the good_fortune to be apprenticed to Mietek Breslauer ( Jean Yanne ) , a stocky , apparently widowed Jewish tailor who takes great pride in his craft ( and in driving a hard deal ) . Breslauer is a stern taskmaster but even more , he ' s a loving father figure . Consequently , when Fausto declares that he ' d rather design dresses for women , Breslauer is prepared to go_along with him . &quot; A la Mode &quot; is especially effective in capturing the exhilaration of Fausto ' s self-discovery ; he really has the talent and skill to make_it as a couturier , and his imagination coincides perfectly with the Mod styles of the ' 60s . Undeniably , &quot; A la Mode &quot; is sentimental , but it ' s so affectionate , so overflowing with good cheer that its sunny spirit is endearing . Fausto and his burly best pal Raymond ( Francois Hautesserre ) , who ' s a regular Le Petomane , engage in many teen-age shenanigans , and Fausto begins to discover true love in the form of the nearby mechanic ' s daughter Tonie ( Florence Darel ) , who ' s as self-confident as she is beautiful , an ideal model for his creations . * Duchemin , a veteran assistant director , and his co-writer Richard Morgieve eschew the usual sizable obstacles along Fausto ' s path to success and happiness . They ' re able to get_away with this in part because they ' ve dared to open the film on a dire note that has the effect of getting life ' s unavoidable losses out of the way right at the start ; its effect is to leave us with the feeling that Fausto is thereafter entitled to as smooth a path as possible . Duchemin would seem really to care_for actors , for they certainly glow under his direction . His young people couldn ' t be more ingratiating , but for the longtime fan of French films , &quot; A la Mode ' s &quot; key pleasure is in seeing the veteran Yanne get a change of pace . Having first come_to the attention of American audiences in the title_role of Claude Chabrol ' s &quot; This Man Must Die &quot; ( 1969 ) and more recently seen as the world-weary , sinister police_chief of Saigon in &quot; Indochine , &quot; Yanne is cast invariably in serious or malevolent roles . The proud , amusing Mietek allows Yanne to reveal that he ' s as skilled at being comical as he is in_playing heavies . * MPAA rating : R , for a scene of sexuality and some language . Times guidelines : Except for some rough language and one scene of tasteful sexuality , the film is otherwise mild .
