   <HEADLINE> GETTING OVER IT ; HOW DOES A STRAIGHT GUY GET BEYOND HOMOPHOBIA ? A GAY FOOTBALL_PLAYER GIVES HIM SOME ANSWERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I am an American , New York born , male by construction and heterosexual by design . At 43 , I have some history behind me . My behavior is relatively consistent . My patterns have been set . When Vietnam was raging , I returned my draft card and stood vigil at the Pentagon . I ' ve marched for civil_rights and women ' s rights , protested the Gulf War and the first Rodney King verdicts . I refuse to cross a picket_line . I ' ve never missed an election , never voted Republican , and when I go_to the polls to choose a president I always wear a tie out of respect for the office . I worry about whales and guns and ozone_holes and movie violence . I hate artificial turf and the designated hitter . I even recycle . I believe , unshakably , in the words of Thomas_Jefferson : All men are created equal . That said , I continue to carry a particular prejudice like a hump . It doesn ' t feel right -- in your heart , what prejudice does ? -- but it ' s been part of me for so_long , I tend to ignore it . I can ' t ignore it anymore . Half a lifetime or so ago , I was living_in Washington , D.C. , valiantly trying , Monday through Friday , to become an adult . I would atone on weekends by dropping into various watering_holes . I was particularly fond of a joint in the shadow of the Capitol dome called the Hawk ' n ' Dove , an apt enough name for a place in which I lost an early skirmish in a war I wasn ' t even aware back then I was waging . The front , nearly two decades later , is the same : the internal battleground on which straight_men like myself must eventually assess and confront our history of intolerance -- sometimes benign , sometimes not -- toward homosexuals . I ' ve begun to see the light at the end of my tunnel , though . Going eyeball to eyeball with myself , my prejudice has finally blinked . The Hawk , back in the late ' 70s , catered to a Carter-era clientele of Congressfolk and their staffers , journalists , bureaucrats , and anyone else -- male , female , young , old , black , white -- who could carry_on a decent conversation and remain vertical through post-midnight rounds of peppermint schnapps.There , late one afternoon during football_season , I slipped into the verbal passing lanes of an aficionado who was making the hidden complexities of the gridiron as understandable as the pregame coin toss . He looked_like an athlete , this guy : chiseled face , bulky and broad across the beam , tall and thick-legged . He had a quick laugh , loud and full , and seemed to know everyone who walked into the bar , or at least they all seemed to know him . He introduced himself as Dave , but I didn ' t catch his last_name . He ' d obviously played the game ; some high_school , maybe college , I assumed , like I had . In bits and pieces , stops and starts , our conversation continued over the next few weekends in the semi-anonymous way these things do at saloons . Then I saw his picture in a bookstore window , and everything , from my perspective , changed . Dave knew football , all_right . He had captained his University of Washington team in the 1964 Rose Bowl , then gone_on to a solid career as an NFL running back with the San Francisco 49ers , Washington Redskins , Green_Bay Packers and others for more_than a decade . But that wasn ' t all_the yardage his book covered . Dave Kopay had become the first professional jock to publicly proclaim his homosexuality ; through his book , he was coming_out of two very claustrophobic and secret places : the locker_room and the closet . ( Kopay remains one of very few professional_football , baseball or basketball_players to have done so. ) But in 1976 , the world I knew , the world of straight_men , didn ' t know how to accept that yet . Now , more_than a quarter-century after the riot at the Stonewall Inn in New York ' s Greenwich_Village that marked the birth of the modern gay rights movement , it still doesn ' t . Our prejudice remains ingrained , its roots as tangled as a houseplant ' s in a too-small pot . The law can force us to act fairly , but it can ' t force us to think or feel that way . Men like myself may speak_of tolerance and equality and even support gay rights vocally from a distance , but that doesn ' t mean that in our hearts we live_by our words . The gap between voice and action forms the black_hole of bigotry , and , once sucked_in , these places take work , real work , to escape_from . I never again spoke_to Kopay at the Hawk . My decision didn ' t grow out of routine intolerance or dark seeds of hate . It stemmed from ignorance and its distant cousin , confusion . I was having trouble making_sense of the image and information I was trying to process . Kopay was certainly not the first gay_man I ' d ever met ; he was , however , the first to cut so violently against the stereotype I had learned and held onto . So I denied him rather than confront something that made me feel oddly uncomfortable . ( What if he found me attractive ? What if he didn ' t ? ) I had beaten racial prejudice into submission , but this was different . Become friends with a queer ? Get outta here ! But then , I grew_up in an America where men were men , and if you couldn ' t catch a pass , drill a fastball or can a jumper from the top of the key , we called you a faggot . ( If there was a faggot who could , we never heard of him , which is what has made the Kopays of the world so threatening to our definition of masculinity ; he could catch a pass and relate to another man intimately. ) Weep openly , and we called you a ' mo . Listen to opera , write poetry , display emotion , seek companionship more tender than the swagger of fraternal bonding , touch another man anywhere but on the butt during a ballgame -- fill_in the cliche -- and hormonally raging young heterosexuals ( even if we , too , listened to opera -- Maria Callas is currently wailing &quot; Norma &quot; from my stereo ) psychologically abused you , branded you a pansy , turned their backs and erased you from existence . What I couldn ' t understand then was that bigotry tells us more about the hater than the hated . We all have dark closets of fear and prejudice and confusion that need airing . The gay world has found a key to unlock its closet ; the door to the straight world might be_better served by dynamite . We can open our door , peek out timidly into the world and go blithely about our business as we always have , or we can blow the damned thing off completely and take our chances . we ' ll remain prisoners of our sex until we do . IN THE SUBURBAN , MIDDLE-CLASS , WHITE-BREAD ( RYE WAS THE ACTUAL loaf of choice in my Long_Island neighborhood ) world where I grew_up , sex and sexuality were limited to the bedroom , not paraded through the streets . Homosexuality existed elsewhere . Cultural osmosis taught us that to be homosexual was to be silly , dirty , perverted and weird . It was shameful and sinful . It was a mental_illness , classified as such by the American Psychiatric Assn . as late as 1973 . It was something you could go_to jail for . Hell , it was something to go_to hell for . So , among all_the things that we didn ' t want to grow_up to be , gay , from the get-go , was down in the basement , hidden in the crawl space with Nazi , Commie , Klansman and ax murderer . Tolerate it ? Accept it ? Every image associated with it was negative , and every story built around it had a horrible second act . When I was maybe 8 or 9 , the man who came_to the house once a month to wax the floors -- he was warm , affectionate , loving and as unthreatening a human_being as could be -- was arrested on a morals charge for soliciting an undercover cop in a men ' s room . My parents refused to let him near the house again , fearing , they told me years later , that I would be corrupted . Not long after they ' d planted that seed , at the outset of my puberty , I had a nightmare about John violating me . I ran from my bed to the bathroom to wash myself off . In high_school , I learned that a college professor , the older son of two of my parents ' friends , was gay . Such a tragedy , said my parents . Not so_much that Danny was , to use the Yiddish , a faygeleh , but the way his folks reacted : They cut_off communication , then mourned him in the Jewish custom of sitting on a bench for a week as if he had died . When I posed the hypothetical question of what my parents would have done had it been me , my mother quickly responded that that couldn ' t happen , and then , just as quickly , changed the subject . Then , my senior year , I experienced the horrible second act directly for the first time ; a colleague on the school paper hanged himself . He was a nice guy , funny and clever , but we wondered about him ; he was artistic , effeminate , hated sports and had a knack for inserting Oscar Wilde quotations into his editorials . For a day or two after his suicide , we talked_about him , with hushed tones of bewilderment , not any real understanding . But it was the week before graduation , we had other things on our minds , and none of us wanted to admit the truth : We could have been more decent to him , befriended him , listened to him . The lingering regret is that he ' d never tried to talk to us . The harsh reality is that we couldn ' t let him . In a culture that clings_to the notion of &quot; We ' re No . 1 , &quot; being No . 1 means nothing without a No . 2 to hold_sway over , and strutting , virulent masculinity was clearly the ideal . Defining ourselves as the best , the strongest , the smartest , the bravest and the most manly required defining someone else as less than that . Thus homosexuality became a target , the antithesis that gave shape and boundary to what we were , and what we were was not that . And we were relieved . Still , in my most secret moments , I wondered about the mechanics of how &quot; they &quot; did_it . I wondered about where the attraction lay . I wondered why , in the locker_rooms I frequented , I would find myself admiring the grace and strength of another man ' s body . And I wondered why I was wondering , praying that next month ' s Playmate would still have the zip to charge my erotic fantasies . But knowing I was straight was not enough . What if I changed ? What if homosexuality crept_up and strangled me as I got older ? What if I were recruited into The Life ? What if I wound_up on the end of a noose ? Men build walls around themselves to keep_from being penetrated in every meaning of the word . The real problem was that there was nothing out there in the world to dispel that . The closet was closed . The images still held . And continued to . For an abnormal psychology class my sophomore year at Union College , then still an all-men ' s enclave in Upstate New York , I wrote an analysis of a case study in our textbook on a middle-aged gay_man . &quot; Nobody loves an old homosexual , &quot; commented the professor in the margins , the exact words that he ' d penned on a similar study my best_friend had turned_in the year before . &quot; He should know , &quot; my friend and I smirked when we discovered the coincidence . Still , we both liked this professor a great_deal and decided to take him to lunch before we both transferred to a just co-ed Vassar . Yes , he told us , he was gay , and , in his mid-50s , he was tired_of keeping the secret any longer ; not being himself , he said , was just too damned hard a job . His honesty plucked a chord within us , and my friend and I talked a lot over the next months -- at Vassar , at that time , it was hard not to -- about what masculinity means . The women around us were challenging and changing us , taking some of the starch out of our shorts , so to speak . They actively encouraged us to acknowledge that there were feminine aspects to our character and to go_out and explore them . To survive in this changing environment , we men learned we simply had to talk to one another , comfort and console one another , support one another , even put our arms -- both in solace and in joy -- around one another . I met openly gay contemporaries for the first time , and through simple proximity , friendship developed , and through friendship , prejudice and ignorance began to fade . Suddenly , the group that was not me miraculously condensed into individuals not altogether unlike me , but still not enough like me to send_out to sea the last undercurrents of superiority my heterosexuality engendered . The ' 60s had turned_into 1970 , and the colors of the human rainbow were no longer so difficult to celebrate or respect -- respect being one of bigotry ' s more powerful antidotes . I was so busy celebrating my own freedom , I forgot what intolerance felt_like . And then . . . . Two years after college , two years back into the Real_World , Esquire ran a story on the men of Vassar . The piece centered_on a small , flamboyant group of gay students that entered as freshmen my final year . I laughed when I read the piece ; it captured the outrageousness of these guys whom I had so liked for daring to be different and open and defiantly proud . But I was also trying to make my way up the lower rungs of journalism , and virtually everyone I met over the next year or two , from colleagues to potential employers , had read that story . Before the piece , the question I was most asked about Vassar was whether I scored a lot . ( About 10 points a game for the basketball_team , was my standard reply. ) After the piece appeared , everyone just assumed that I was gay . I never quite understood the logic , but logic doesn ' t necessarily hold when someone ' s initial enthusiasm over meeting you turns_into a cold silence . I lost more_than one potential job in the process . So that ' s what it ' s like to be the object of bigotry . I didn ' t like it . But at 24 , I wasn ' t confident enough to keep beating it back within myself . On this front , at least , it was easier to dunk my head in the water , swim with the prevailing tide , and keep homosexuality at arm ' s length . And so , when I met Dave Kopay , I had no trouble letting my prejudices drift me farther out_to sea . But over the last few years , I found myself sinking . Living and working in Hollywood , living and working beside gay_men , has made_it harder and harder to keep the old stereotypes afloat and harder not to care about the people I was meeting , and liking , regardless of whom they slept_with . It ' s also hard not to care about people dying . The grace and courage and loyalty exhibited by the gay community in the face of AIDS has revealed compassion in me I wasn ' t willing to admit I had . In 1969 , Life magazine displayed the name and photograph of every soldier wasted in one particular week in Vietnam ; it brought the madness of the war home_in stunningly human detail . So , too , has the constant litany of the dead and dying , from the famous Rock Hudsons to the anonymous neighbors I ' ve only nodded to in passing , that fills the obituaries in the trade papers and news magazines . And then there have been the public performances and pronouncements of the two men for whom the gay community should pray daily for good_health and long life ( and maybe a hot time in eternity ) : Pat Buchanan and Jesse Helms . To see two public faces so twisted with anger and fear , to hear their words so filled with hate , does wonders to the well-intentioned . We see how close to Helms and Buchanan we can be and how far from them we want to be . Then we reassess who we are . The Buchanans and Helmses talk_about homosexuality as a threat -- to the family , to the moral fiber of the nation , to our children , to our communities , to our health and to our souls . There is a threat , a powerful threat , but not the one they ' re implying . It ' s a threat that nips at my masculinity every time I meet a gay_man who has wrestled his demons , emerged from his closet and actually seems at_peace with himself . The truth is , nothing so threatens a human_being who ' s afraid of exiting his own closet , whatever that closet may be , as seeing another man set himself free . And if that man seems proud , happy , content , loved and loving , the threat is even greater . Understanding that , I could understand how the prejudice that had buoyed me for so_long was weighing me down . But there was still one particular place I needed to go_to confront it . I had to find Dave Kopay . I ' M NOT SURE WHY I WANTed to find Dave Kopay . I ' m not seeking forgiveness for the past . Still , finding him might close my incomplete circle . When I arrive_at his apartment in West Hollywood -- he had suggested I come_by to watch a Monday night football game -- the door is open and he is hunched_over the phone . He motions me to come_in and sit_down . The game is already on . He ' s talking to the father of a friend in Washington state who is in the last throes of AIDS , and he ' s trying to figure_out when he can get_back for a final visit . There have been too many final visits of late . He excuses himself as he hangs_up and exits the room to compose himself . Underneath the violent sounds of televised football , I hear the quiet sound of a man unabashedly weeping at the imminence of human loss . When Kopay re-enters , he asks if I ' ve experienced an AIDS death of someone close to me . I tell him not really . He says I am lucky , then we talk_about the old days at the Hawk . &quot; I don ' t think your behavior was unusual at the time , &quot; he says with no sadness or anger . At 51 , there is a peace in his eyes that comes from self-knowledge and the struggle to attain it . &quot; It takes time . It takes time. &quot; There were other slights , he says , but he didn ' t pay that much attention . &quot; I was so caught_up_with what I was doing and how full I felt that the bulls- - - didn ' t much matter . I knew that it was all going_to be better. &quot; Many straight_men , then and now , saw his coming_out as a betrayal , and we are both intrigued by that , and what it reveals . &quot; It fractured what they believed me to be , &quot; he explains , laughing_at the contradiction . &quot; How could this guy who was nicknamed Psyche ( for his intensity ) by his coaches be a wimp ? How did this queer play football ? &quot; Others offered sympathy . &quot; I want to puke when I hear that word . What do I need sympathy for ? For what I am ? No. &quot; Over the next few hours , our conversation skips from the game that is_on in the background to his battle -- well-documented in his eponymous autobiography -- to accept himself , to his frustrations at being denied coaching_jobs , to the support he ' s received from old teammates , to the fulfillment he feels when other men thank him for being the role_model he never sought to be . Kopay , who works in the family_business , Linoleum City , a flooring company in Hollywood , admits he still chuckles to himself when a straight male art_director or interior_designer comes_in_for supplies ; the stereotypes die_hard on either side of the line . We smile at that . In the end , I realize , what our conversation is about is simply two men -- no adjective before the noun -- talking_about the myriad possibilities we contain and the frustrations and fears that prevent us from reaching them . &quot; I really believe , &quot; he insists , &quot; that most people do not fall 100 % in either scale of sexuality , male or female . &quot; Accepting who you are , what you are , where you are , and the responsibility for who you are , &quot; he says assuredly , contentedly , &quot; that ' s the only thing that defines manhood . We haven ' t even scratched the surface of defining masculinity. &quot; Then he says something so obvious that we overlook it every day : &quot; Love doesn ' t have a gender. &quot; No , it doesn ' t . Love is so damned hard to find in this world that who among us has the right to deny it to anyone else wherever it can be found ? So , this , then , is how it commences , face to face , the work to beat_back bigotry , with the simplest and most universal observation of all . The circle , closed , begins again . Which is what this is , a beginning . As Kopay said , it takes time , and at this time in my life , I ' m willing to give it all_the time it needs . It ' s certainly not a great accomplishment on my part . But the door has opened . And that ' s a start .</TEXT>
