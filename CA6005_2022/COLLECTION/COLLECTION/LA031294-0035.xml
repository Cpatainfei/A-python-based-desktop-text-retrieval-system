   <HEADLINE> PLEA FOR A DRY WORLD CUP IS SCOTCHED ; SPORTS : PASADENA REJECTS REQUEST FOR CITYWIDE BAN ON LIQUOR SALES IN EFFORT TO AVERT FIGHTS AMONG SOCCER FANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You can hoist your glass : The Cup is not going_to cork the keg in Pasadena . Officials said Friday that they have no intention of imposing a citywide ban on beer , wine and liquor during the upcoming World Cup soccer games as tourney organizers want them to do . The head of the World Cup Organizing Committee has asked mayors of all nine U.S. cities where championship matches will be played to enact the unusual drinking prohibition as a way of preventing hooliganism that has marred games in Europe . Game organizers are seeking the &quot; outright banning of sale or consumption of alcoholic_beverages &quot; in host communities during the games , Committee Chairman Alan Rothenberg said . His group is contemplating such a ban inside the Rose Bowl and at other stadiums during the tournament , which runs from June 17 to July 17 , he said . Citywide bans on the sale of alcohol on game days have become common in Europe , where drunken fans have turned violent and gained notoriety as soccer hooligans . The 1990 games became known as the &quot; Teetotaler World Cup &quot; when all 12 Italian cities hosting that 52-game series announced citywide alcohol restrictions . That is not going_to happen in Pasadena , Cole promised Friday . &quot; There ' s not going_to be some Draconian city ban , &quot; Cole said . &quot; We haven ' t even checked to see if it ' s legal . Unless the governor is prepared to issue a one-day state of emergency for the city , I don ' t think we could do it. &quot; World Cup officials said their proposed no-drinking policy comes even though one of the games ' major sponsors is Budweiser . Anheuser-Busch Co . has paid a reported $ 7 million to support the soccer series . The idea has rankled brewing company officials in St . Louis . &quot; We ' re disappointed . We think it ' s not only an empty symbolic gesture , but could even be problematic , &quot; said Joe Castellano , an Anheuser-Busch vice_president . &quot; It ' s un-American , you can put it that way. &quot; Pasadena business owners were ready to toast that news . &quot; It ' s a relief , &quot; said Billy Bitonti , who spent $ 150 # 000 to double the size of his Domenico ' s Big D Sports Bar in preparation for the games . &quot; I have a big security crew . Soccer fans can ' t be any rougher than 23-year-old college drinkers. &quot;</TEXT>
