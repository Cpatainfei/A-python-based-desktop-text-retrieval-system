   <HEADLINE> JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON TO SOAK_UP NEUTROGENA ; ACQUISITIONS : HEALTH PRODUCTS COMPANY WILL PAY A PREMIUM PRICE TO EXPAND ITS LINE OF SKIN AND HAIR_CARE PRODUCTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Aiming to broaden its offerings in the skin_care business , Johnson &amp; Johnson said Monday that it will pay a premium price of $ 924.1 million to acquire Neutrogena , the maker of premium-priced soaps , shampoos and other beauty products . A deal had been widely expected after Los Angeles-based Neutrogena said earlier this month it was holding buyout talks with a &quot; substantially larger &quot; company . Johnson &amp; Johnson will pay $ 35.25 cash for each Neutrogena share -- a 63 % premium over the market_price before Neutrogena disclosed Aug . 10 that it was talking with a possible buyer . Analysts praised the deal and said they doubted a rival would step_forward to break it up , mainly because of the high price offered by Johnson &amp; Johnson . The purchase unites Neutrogena ' s well-regarded lines of skin and hair products with such venerable brands as Johnson ' s Baby Shampoo and Baby_Oil . Johnson &amp; Johnson -- which also makes Tylenol pain reliever , Band-Aids and the skin treatment Retin-A -- has been trying to expand its line of skin_care products . Neutrogena shares rocketed $ 6.02 to $ 34.77 in Nasdaq trading Monday . The stock had traded as low as $ 16 earlier this year . Johnson &amp; Johnson shares added 12.5 cents to $ 49.125 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Diana Temple , an analyst with Salomon Bros . in New York , said the deal will be a big boost to Johnson &amp; Johnson ' s efforts to build its skin products business . &quot; Johnson &amp; Johnson spends a lot of money on skin_care research -- they came_up with Retin-A -- and what they add here is a strong brand franchise in the Neutrogena name , &quot; she said . Besides its baby-care line , New Brunswick , N.J.-based Johnson &amp; Johnson also has the Clean and Care skin_care line for teen-agers that it purchased from Revlon in 1991 . But that brand lacks the broad consumer recognition and reputation for quality enjoyed by Neutrogena . Johnson &amp; Johnson ' s product research should help Neutrogena develop new products to compete with recent &quot; high-tech &quot; skin products from such competitors as Oil of Olay and Avon , analysts said . Johnson &amp; Johnson , the world ' s largest health products company , will also be able to lend its expertise in international markets to boost Neutrogena sales abroad . Temple puts Neutrogena ' s international sales at $ 72 million this year , out of total sales of $ 307 million . In contrast , many personal care products firms have sales two to three times better overseas than in the United States , she notes . Although Neutrogena products are sold in 72 countries , Neutrogena Chairman Lloyd E . Cotsen declared it a company goal to &quot; plant the Neutrogena flag internationally. &quot; The company recently opened offices in Latin_America and test-marketed its hand creams in China . Rumors have circulated for years that Cotsen -- who directly and through his family controls 45 % of the company -- was interested in selling . The talk began after sales and earnings at Neutrogena , which enjoyed spectacular growth through much of the 1980s , began to slip . For the six months ended April 30 , net earnings were flat , at about $ 9.3 million , and sales were off 2 % to $ 133.7 million from a year earlier . Cotsen personally owns 9.87 million of the 25.7 million Neutrogena shares outstanding . He will reap about $ 347.9 million , before taxes , by tendering his stake . Neutrogena officials did not return several phone_calls seeking comment . PaineWebber analyst Andrew Shore said Cotsen , 65 , and Allan H . Kurtzman , the firm ' s 67-year-old president and chief operating officer , apparently were ready to sell their interests and hand_over the company to a new owner . Cotsen &quot; can go_out with his head held high and know that he ' s passed_on something of_value to someone , &quot; Shore said . * ' SOAP SALESMAN ' : Profile of Neutrogena CEO Lloyd E . Cotsen . D3 Face_Value By acquiring Neutrogena , Johnson &amp; Johnson adds more_than 45 products to its own small but venerable line of skin and hair_care products , including its mainstay , Johnson ' s Baby Shampoo . Analysts say J &amp; J benefits by acquiring a widely respected line pf products , while Neutrogena gains a deep-pocketed parent that can help expand its international sales . THE PRODUCTS What J &amp; J currently has : * Johnson ' s Baby Shampoo * Johnson ' s Baby_Oil * Clean and Clear skin cleanser Among what J &amp; J will get : * Neutrogena Facial Bar_Soap * Neutrogena Sunblock * Neutrogena Rainbath Shower and Bath Gel * Neutrogena Body Lotion * Neutrogena Shampoo and Conditioner * Neutrogena Face_Cream NEUTROGENA AT A GLANCE Founded : 1954 Headquarters : Los Angeles Chairman and Chief_Executive : Lloyd E .
