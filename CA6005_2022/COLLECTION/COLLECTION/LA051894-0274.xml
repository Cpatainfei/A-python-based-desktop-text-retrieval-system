   <HEADLINE> JUSTICE DEPT . ASKS PRINCIPAL ' S OUSTER IN RACE CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Justice_Department on Tuesday asked a federal_court in Alabama to order school officials to explain why a rural high_school principal should not be fired or reassigned for allegedly making racially derogatory remarks . In an unusual move singling_out a local school official for punishment , the Justice_Department claimed that the principal ' s alleged statements reflect a school_system that continues to discriminate against blacks despite two court_orders prohibiting it . Senior Justice_Department officials said privately that they could not recall ever before requesting that an official be fired for discriminatory remarks . Randolph County High_School Principal Hulond Humphries threatened to cancel the high_school prom if interracial couples attended and said the child of an interracial couple was a &quot; mistake , &quot; according to motions filed_in federal_court in Montgomery on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision outlawing public_school segregation . In addition , the Justice_Department charged school officials in new motions in a longstanding desegregation suit with violating court_orders by &quot; disciplining black students more harshly than whites and failing to recruit or hire black teachers and staff. &quot; &quot; This case is not just about one man who made a derogatory remark , but an entire school_system that we believe has allowed an atmosphere of discrimination to persist , &quot; said Deval Patrick , assistant attorney_general for civil_rights , whose office initiated an investigation after complaints from county residents , the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference . &quot; Today ' s action demonstrates that some of the problems that once haunted us are still with us . . . . &quot; Humphries and school officials could not be reached for comment . The principal ' s defenders have said he meant no offense but was simply trying to avoid racial confrontation , according to published reports . Fights had erupted on campus when interracial couples were seen together , they said .</TEXT>
