   <HEADLINE> GASOLINE SMUGGLING FUELS HAITI DEFIANCE ; CARIBBEAN : PETROL IS TRANSPORTED OPENLY FROM DOMINICAN_REPUBLIC . ACTIVITY SEVERELY WEAKENS INTERNATIONAL EMBARGO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In daylight , every 30 minutes or so , a tiny wooden rowboat makes a half-mile trip across the lake here . At night , the sound of oars slapping the water is replaced by the resonating roar of large trucks on the bordering road . The boats and trucks are carrying_over the plasma that is keeping Haiti alive for the moment . The boats and trucks are smuggling gasoline from the Dominican_Republic in open defiance of an international embargo designed to punish Haiti ' s military_leaders . Handmade and badly leaking , the boats come_across the Etang Saumatere , which appropriately means &quot; brackish lake &quot; in the local language , while the trucks take a paved highway . They meet at a border post here at Malpasse -- which means &quot; bad crossing &quot; -- where soldiers on both sides extract heavy payment for letting the illicit cargo through . The boats ' contribution is small -- each carries 20 to 50 gallons of gasoline in plastic bottles and jerrycans every trip -- but they are symbolic of the military government ' s easy and open defiance of the world trade_embargo . The trucks ' contribution , on the other hand , is massive . They are often large enough to haul 10 # 000 gallons of fuel at a time . At current prices , each gallon is worth more_than $ 6 . However it comes , the gasoline has allowed Haiti ' s hard-line military to ward_off the world ' s demand that they restore to power Jean-Bertrand Aristide , the president they drove from the country more_than 2 1 / 2 years ago . &quot; They actually have increased the supply of gasoline in the last month , &quot; one foreign fuel expert said . &quot; It is not back to normal , but they ' re getting enough to keep things going_to one degree or another. &quot; Oil_company technicians estimate that Haiti is now smuggling in about 25 % of the fuel that it imported legally before the embargo , which went_into effect in mid-October after the military reneged_on an agreement to allow Aristide back . All of it is coming_in from the neighboring Dominican_Republic , which , experts say , purchased at least 15 % more fuel in 1993 than it did_in 1992 to meet the Haitian demand . &quot; All of that has been transshipped to Haiti , &quot; one oil expert said . &quot; The amazing thing is that increase took_place entirely after October &quot; -- meaning , he explained , that several hundred_thousand barrels of fuel have made_it here during a time when as_many as 22 warships have blockaded the island nation . The key is the Dominican government ' s and military ' s willingness to ignore the embargo . Dominican officials openly declare their opposition to the boycott , even though they voted for the sanctions in the Organization of American_States and the United Nations . &quot; Evidently , the profits are so great that they are risking the anger of the Americans , &quot; a diplomat said . &quot; The day after ( U.S. Ambassador William ) Swing flew to Santo Domingo to protest , the smuggling increased. &quot; And it continues to expand . So_much was brought_in last week that the price fell 30 % in two days , from $ 9 to $ 6 . Traffic_jams are back in Port-au-Prince , commerce was restored to a limited degree , and electrical_power has expanded -- neighborhoods limited to two or three hours of electricity until a day or two ago were enjoying power all Saturday afternoon . All of this is amazing enough given the weight of the embargo , but it is especially awesome given that a gigantic fire earlier this month destroyed nearly all_of the area where the black-market gasoline was stored . Within two days of the fire , a new storage and sales area was set_up on a main highway on Port-au-Prince ' s north_side . Today the fuel market resembles an amiable riot , choked with trucks and cars lining_up to buy gasoline from dozens , perhaps hundreds , of vendors . Some is sold in one-gallon plastic containers to people with little money . Much is pumped out of barrels into the tanks of the big jeeps favored by Haiti ' s elite . All of it is done openly . &quot; Everybody thinks these people are just dumb brutes , &quot; a diplomat said of the Haitian military , &quot; but this fuel business shows that they are resourceful and certainly stubborn. &quot; And rich . According to experts , the smugglers pay about $ 1.90 a gallon in the Dominican_Republic . They pay an equal amount to officers of that country for permission to cross the border , leaving the rest as profit for the soldiers who control the whole business . Still , in spite of the availability of the fuel , in the long_run it is &quot; a mug ' s game , &quot; one diplomat said . The only ones getting rich are the military and the civilians who are permitted to share_in the largess . Business people interviewed for this story , even some who have bitterly opposed Aristide ' s return , agree that the embargo has been disastrous for them . &quot; I can ' t afford to keep this up , &quot; one industrialist said . &quot; I bought enough ( fuel ) to finish my existing orders . But I lose $ 3 for every gallon I buy . So I am shutting_down next month. &quot; Another businessman said commerce is being so badly damaged that it may never recover . That does not elicit any sympathy from the military , said the industrialist , whose family has backed the army from the day of the Sept . 30 , 1991 , coup through the resulting economic calamity . &quot; They don ' t care , &quot; he said . &quot; They are getting rich , and they think they have beaten the embargo , that the United States can ' t or won ' t stop them . They have so_much money themselves that they pay no attention to us. &quot;</TEXT>
