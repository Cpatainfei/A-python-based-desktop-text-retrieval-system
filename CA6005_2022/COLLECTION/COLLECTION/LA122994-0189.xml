   <HEADLINE> MEDICINE ; HOSPITAL TO SHED SOME BEDS AS IT GROWS ; FACILITY WILL DE-EMPHASIZE INPATIENT CARE IN FAVOR OF OUTPATIENT SERVICES , WHOSE DEMAND HAS QUADRUPLED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Following a trend among hospitals around the region , Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia is planning a $ 32-million expansion that will actually reduce the number of beds by 30 % and increase outpatient services instead . The Patient Tower project , which is being financed through a combination of hospital reserves , bond sales and donations , will reduce the number of beds from 347 to 243 , said Greg Bonn , a hospital vice_president . Because of advances in medical treatment and surgical techniques , the average number of days a patient needs to stay in the hospital has fallen dramatically , Bonn said , from an average of six days in 1990 to 5.4 days . As a result , many hospital_beds go unused , costing hospitals the money to maintain them without the income from patients . Of the 347 beds available at Methodist Hospital , only 190 were in_use in mid-December . &quot; What we are encountering is a whole new era for hospitals , &quot; Bonn said . In 1984 at Southern California hospitals , the average daily bed occupancy_rate was about 65 % , said David Langness , spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California . By this year , the rate had fallen to 48 % . At the same time , demand for outpatient services has increased 400 % , Langness said . &quot; This is happening all_over the region , &quot; he said . &quot; Southern California is just full of these kinds of projects. &quot; In the 1970s , hospital expansion meant more beds . Now , hospitals are working_on their buildings , but with fewer beds . Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena has a reconstruction plan that calls_for 146 of the hospital ' s 604 beds to be eliminated , said Huntington spokesman Steve Willis . In West Covina , Queen of the Valley Hospital and the Intercommunity Medical_Center merged in May , giving the combined facility 525 beds . The two hospitals use 370 of the beds .</TEXT>
