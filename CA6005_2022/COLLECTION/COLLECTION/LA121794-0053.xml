   <HEADLINE> POPE MOVES TO RESOLVE HOLOCAUST BLAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Pope John Paul II charts the course for the Catholic_Church in the coming millennium , he is preparing to resolve a painful but significant chapter of this century -- the Church ' s conduct toward Jews during the Holocaust . For the past seven years , the Pope and the Vatican have consulted with scholars from around the world to address what remains one of the most troubling events of modern times . The Pope , who witnessed the Holocaust in Poland and has characterized it as a personal tragedy , is expected to make a final determination next year on the controversial and complicated relationship between the Church and European Jews , 50 years after the end of World_War_II . By most accounts , the task will not be easy . What ' s more , even a definitive word will surely not be the last on the subject . The move to resolve the volatile question comes as the relationship between Jews and the Church is improving . A year ago , diplomatic ties were established between the Vatican and Israel . Despite what they consider some questionable diplomatic moves by the Vatican , many Jewish leaders have expressed fondness for the Pope , who refers to Jews in his recently published book , &quot; Crossing the Threshold of Hope , &quot; as &quot; our elder brothers in the faith. &quot; Tullia Zevi , president of Italy ' s Jewish Community , called the Pope &quot; courageous &quot; for undertaking the study and said , &quot; In my opinion , he has been very positive for our improved relations . He ' s a Pole and you feel_like he has seen it all. &quot; Born Karol Wojtyla and reared in Wadowice , near the Czech border -- where 2 # 000 of the 9 # 000 residents were Jewish -- he witnessed deportations and the death of friends . He lived_in the shadow of Auschwitz , which , he wrote , &quot; To this day . . . does not cease to admonish , reminding us that anti-Semitism is a great sin against humanity. &quot; He has expressed revulsion over the genocide and acknowledged the &quot; sinfulness &quot; among some Catholics . But the Pope has remained silent on the red-hot question -- whether the Roman_Catholic_Church was responsible_for sowing an atmosphere of hate against the Jews , in which its followers and servants found comfort and justification . The question of which way the Pope will turn is playing_out among church leaders who are deeply divided over how , or even whether , to address this issue . At the center of the vast and polarized landscape of opinion stands Pope John Paul II , whose personal views and experiences are clear but for whom the epoch will require passing judgment on the church he leads . Many German and Polish clerics , who , like the Polish-born Pope , witnessed the Holocaust , strongly promote a confession of guilt . Other Europeans and officials in the Vatican bureaucracy known as the curia , oppose a blanket condemnation . They say there is no proof that the Church actively supported or sympathized_with the Nazis and contend that the Vatican worked to halt the genocide . Agreement can be found on one point -- untold numbers of Catholics risked their livelihood and their lives to save Jewish friends , neighbors and strangers . &quot; There is no question that Catholics risked their lives , &quot; said Norbert Greinacher , a leading German Catholic theologian . &quot; But for the official church in the mainstream this was not true. &quot; Greinacher said anti-Semitic sermons were a mainstay in churches during the war and prayers against the Jews for the killing of Jesus often fed the flames of hatred . He noted that Catholic bishops in Germany and Poland were openly hostile to Jews . But Robert Graham , a Jesuit priest in Rome who has studied the Church ' s behavior during the war years , contends that time has blurred reality . The Vatican was responsive to requests by Jewish groups to help end persecution , he said . It sought visas for Jews and helped to plan escape routes and hiding_places . &quot; All the big Jewish organizations were involved with the Vatican and were greatly appreciative , &quot; he said . &quot; I find it unfair that there ' s a systematic blindness to the Vatican ' s role during that time . There was a lot of goodwill toward the Vatican then. &quot; Today , some of the most vocal critics of the Church ' s behavior during the war are not Jewish groups but Catholics . A working paper on the subject prepared by a German theologian said the Church was partly responsible_for the Holocaust . The paper was undertaken at church request , but caused a sensation when it was leaked to the press . Prepared by Hans Herman Henrix , of the Catholic Theological Institute in Aachen , Germany , the paper said : &quot; Despite the exemplary behavior of some individuals and groups , we were nevertheless as_a_whole a church community who kept_on living their lives in turning their back too often on the fate of this persecuted Jewish people . . . and who remained silent about the crimes committed against the Jews and Judaism. &quot; The Vatican immediately distanced itself from the study , saying it was a project of the German Bishops ' Conference and the Polish Bishops ' Conference . But Henrix said the Pope has been supportive of the project , which is expected to be completed in 1995 . &quot; I have not lost confidence that the result of this process will be helpful to the relationship of the Church and the Jewish community , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
