   <HEADLINE> INDIA ; ACTOR ' S ARREST ON WEAPONS CHARGES THREATENS ' BOLLYWOOD '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now playing : a real-life , multimillion-dollar horror show for the Indian film_industry , starring one of its biggest names . The drama ' s ending will tell a great_deal about how justice is administered in this country , and may reveal who was behind one of the most diabolical terrorist attacks in Indian history . Earlier this month , a Bombay judge sent Sanjay Dutt , the country ' s muscular , home-grown answer to Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone , back to jail , revoking his bail . It was the beginning of an all-too-real nightmare for the magnates , producers and financiers of Hindi films and for their bookkeepers . According to industry sources , Dutt is currently involved in the production of at least 15 movies in which $ 13 million has been invested . The shaggy-haired , 35-year-old macho actor is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing three AK-56 assault_rifles and ammunition for them . Arrested in April , 1993 , he was granted interim bail after a brief imprisonment . The alleged suppliers of the rifles were the underworld dons blamed for the March , 1993 , serial bombings that , by official count , killed 257 people and seriously wounded more_than 730 others in Bombay . Dutt ' s father , a former movie_star , now sits in India ' s Parliament . His late mother , Nargis , is held to be the greatest goddess to have ever graced the Hindi-language screen . In this country , that combination of pedigree and influence usually would be enough in most situations to lead to a bending of the rules . But Judge J.N. Patel , who had to decide whether to continue Dutt ' s bail , refused to give the hulking , dark-eyed VIP from &quot; Bollywood , &quot; the Bombay-based film_industry , a break . Dutt ' s lawyers pinned their hopes on an appeal_to the Supreme Court . Veteran director-producer Prakash Mehra said if that gambit failed , the Bollywood moguls , in the guise of the Film_Makers Combine , would petition the high_court for Dutt ' s release on &quot; humanitarian &quot; grounds . &quot; This judgment has left the film_industry emotionally hurt , apart from the huge losses that they are going_to suffer , &quot; Mehra said . &quot; What is the fault of the producers ? They should be allowed to complete the unfinished films. &quot; Dutt ' s legal predicament is particularly sticky because he is charged under a tough Indian anti-terrorism law that requires a judge to keep him in jail unless there is a reasonable doubt of his guilt . The actor admits buying the rifles , but says he kept only one , plus some ammunition , because he was worried about the communal violence that erupted in 1992 in Bombay . Rubbish , Patel said . He accused the actor of being &quot; fully aware &quot; that a huge quantity of arms and explosives had been smuggled into India by the alleged mastermind of the Bombay bombings , Dubai-based crime lord Dawood Ibrahim , and his associates . Some of the accused even claim that Dutt allowed the storage of the terrorists ' arsenal at his residence . The judge ' s decision requires the actor be jailed until the Bombay bombing trial , which began Thursday , is over . In opening arguments , the prosecution claimed the 193 accused planned follow-up attacks in New Delhi , Calcutta and other cities . The purported scheme to destabilize India was allegedly hatched with Pakistan ' s help , or at its instigation . A former drug_addict , Dutt has led a troubled and well-publicized private life . His fans will now be watching to learn whether the title of his last box-office hit , &quot; Khalnayak &quot; -- &quot; The Villain &quot; -- is a coincidence or an apt description of its star .</TEXT>
