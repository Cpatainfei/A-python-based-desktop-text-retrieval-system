   <HEADLINE> CLINTON VISIT REVIVES TIES WITH PHILIPPINES AFTER PULLOUT ; ASIA : THE TRIP COMES TWO YEARS AFTER AMERICA ' S BITTER MILITARY EXODUS . MANILA NOW FOCUSES_ON DEVELOPMENT AND REGIONAL RELATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> America always seems to dream of the Asian mainland , but it always returns to the Philippines . And so , in the person of President Clinton , America symbolically came_back to the Philippines on Sunday , just two years after a bitter exodus from the military bases it had occupied for nearly a century . This time , the tone was less grandiose than that of the most famous returnee here , Gen . Douglas MacArthur , who once said that the Philippines &quot; fastened me with a grip that never relaxed. &quot; MacArthur left the Philippines for Australia in 1942 promising to come_back . He kept his promise by wading ashore at Leyte two years later with the words : &quot; I have returned . . . . Rally to me ! . . . The guidance of divine God points_the_way . . . . Follow in his name to the Holy_Grail of righteous victory. &quot; Sunday ' s American return under Clinton was far more modest . But his arrival here was nonetheless welcomed , particularly after the bitterness of the 1992 American departure from Clark Air_Base and the Subic Bay Naval Base . It represents &quot; a revival of the old friendship between our two peoples , &quot; Manila Mayor Angelo Lim said Sunday . &quot; It is a signal to the world that the Philippines is back on the economic map , &quot; said Irene Natividad , head of the Philippine-American Friendship Assn . and one of several prominent Philippine Americans who flew back to Manila for Clinton ' s visit , the first here by a U.S. President in two decades . Still , America came_back Sunday to a different Philippines , one much more preoccupied with Asia and with the task of economic development than was the former colony that America left_behind . &quot; We have found ourselves back in Asia , &quot; said former Philippine Vice_President Emmanuel Pelaez , who served as ambassador to the United States during the closing of the U.S. bases . &quot; Both Japan and Taiwan are transferring their factories here , where land and wages are cheaper . You know , the Japanese prefer ( workers who speak ) English. &quot; The signs of change were evident at Subic Bay , which had been the center of U.S. naval operations in the Pacific from the Boxer Rebellion at the beginning of this century to the Persian_Gulf_War of 1991 . On Sunday , U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher attended a signing ceremony for a new commercial venture at Subic Bay , one in which Federal Express will set_up a new regional hub for its Asian operations . &quot; In the investment community , the Philippines are looked_on as a promising opportunity now , &quot; said Richard Solomon , a former U.S. ambassador to the Philippines . &quot; The things we always hoped would some day work for them are beginning to work . &quot; They have an English-speaking work_force . They don ' t have the political uncertainties of , say , Indonesia . And ( Philippine President Fidel V. ) Ramos seems to have done a good job of getting the security situation under control. &quot; To be sure , not everything has changed . Only one of the runways at Clark Air_Base is ready for use . The rest of the base is still covered with volcanic dust , the continuing legacy of the catastrophic eruption of Mt . Pinatubo in June , 1991 . The efforts of the Philippine government to recover the billions of dollars in assets it estimates were stolen by the late dictator Ferdinand E . Marcos and his cronies are still bogged down in the courts , not much closer to success now than when the litigation started eight years ago . &quot; You know , lawyers can make things last forever , &quot; Pelaez said . Parts of Manila are still lined with hovels . The streets are still full of jeepneys , the colorful converted buses , jeeps and carts that are the country ' s best-known mass transit and most popular folk-art form . And the handouts given to visitors by the U.S. Embassy contain security warnings that portray a different reality from the one the Philippines presents to potential investors . &quot; If in a taxi . . . do NOT allow the driver to pick_up additional passengers , &quot; the warning says . &quot; Stay alert . Be prepared to take evasive_action . Also , if you have packages with you and the driver asks you to get_out to ' check the tire , ' you will never see him OR your packages again. &quot; The Pinatubo eruption started the U.S. exodus from the Philippines , because it virtually eliminated any American interest in staying_on at Clark Air_Base . At the time , Washington and Manila were in the midst of negotiations over the future of the bases but were far apart on money . The George_Bush Administration was offering $ 450 million a year , and the Philippines was demanding $ 1.2 billion . The gap was never closed . On Sept . 16 , 1991 , the Philippine Senate voted 12 to 11 to turn_down a new agreement , effectively ordering the Americans to leave . That was only the beginning of the acrimonious end . Bush wrote then-Philippine President Corazon Aquino , asking_for a two- or three-year period for a gradual , orderly departure . As Pelaez sadly recalled Sunday , &quot; We didn ' t reply . . . . The ( Philippine ) nationalists wanted everything out_in one year . And so the United States pulled_out a lot of things that could have been left . There was some bad blood. &quot; On Nov . 24 , 1992 , the last U.S. warship sailed out of Subic Bay to strains of &quot; Bye-bye , G.I. &quot; on the shores . That ended 94 years of U.S. military presence in the Philippines , setting the tone for a new , more distant relationship between the two countries . &quot; The bases were the last remnants of the colonial era , &quot; said Solomon , who served as the U.S. ambassador in Manila when the military facilities were closed . &quot; It is a much less special relationship now , if it is special at all. &quot; Indeed , Clinton ' s arrival here brought_forth some wariness that the United States might be trying to revive the old paternalistic relationship in a country that has learned to live_on its own . &quot; It would do_well for Mr. Clinton not to act too_much like the Great White Father , &quot; warned an editorial in one newspaper , the Philippine Star . &quot; The Philippines is no longer a child that needs a pat on the back. &quot; For the time being , at least , the United States and the Philippines seem to want different things from each other . The Philippines seeks trade and investment from the United States . For its part , the United States sees the Philippines as an important democratic ally in its ideological skirmishes with Asian states such_as China and Singapore . Clinton evoked that struggle here Sunday . &quot; The great wave of democracy that has swept the world in our time began here in the Philippines , &quot; he said , referring to the 1986 &quot; people power &quot; movement that drove Marcos from office and made Aquino president . &quot; What happened here . . . encouraged events in countries like Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary and Russia. &quot; In addition to the common democratic ties , the United States still thinks_about security links with the Philippines , perhaps with U.S. forces given some access to Philippine military facilities -- such_as the United States enjoys in Singapore . &quot; My assumption was always that after a cooling-off period of a_couple_of years , ( the Philippines ) might want to have us around again , particularly if the Chinese were exercising their weight in Asia , &quot; Solomon said . But that is for the future . Clinton ' s visit Sunday focused_on the past and on revival of the historic ties . The President talked_of the Philippines as &quot; our oldest friend in Asia , a nation that has done so_much to enrich the United States. &quot; Sitting in the back of the cemetery at which Clinton spoke was Francisco T . Dandrido , a veteran who fought in a Philippine artillery_unit with U.S. troops at Corregidor when they surrendered to Japanese forces May 6 , 1942 . He was held as a prisoner for six months . Dandrido is now 76 . His children have gone_to work in Hong Kong . And last year , more_than half a century after his service at Corregidor , he was given U.S. citizenship . Dandrido wants to come_to the United States . But he said sadly , &quot; I have no money. &quot;</TEXT>
