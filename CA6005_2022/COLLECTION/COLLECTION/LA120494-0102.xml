   <HEADLINE> TAKING THE KIDS : WHEN THEY DON ' T WANT TO SKI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Barry Fieldman , please report to the children ' s ski school , &quot; the announcement blared over the din of the crowded slope-side cafeteria . Fieldman turned pale , dropped his burger in mid-bite and raced over to Northstar-at-Tahoe ' s ski school where his 6-year-old son was enrolled . &quot; I was sure Michael had gotten hurt , &quot; he explained later . But nothing so dramatic had happened . When Fieldman , a Las Vegas developer , arrived_at the Northern California ski school breathless and his stomach churning a_few minutes later , he found Michael all_in one piece and grinning from ear-to-ear . &quot; I just don ' t want to ski anymore , &quot; the kindergartner told his dad . The instructors hadn ' t been able to persuade Michael otherwise . So Michael , my nephew , spent the afternoon happily playing in the snow near the condo where his family and mine were staying . &quot; You can ' t make a kid ski , &quot; says Fieldman , himself an avid skier . &quot; It would just aggravate you and ruin your vacation . Find something else that ' s fun for kids to do at the ski area. &quot; Children ' s ski instructors around the country say he is right on the mark . &quot; Making_sure the kids are happy in the winter environment should be parents ' first goal , &quot; explains Rick Devos , director of Steamboat Ski School in Steamboat Springs , Colo. , where half the 50 # 000 lessons given each year are to children . &quot; Forcing it won ' t work . Too many parents have unrealistic expectations for their kids , &quot; sighs Devos , himself the father of two young children . ( Call Steamboat at 800-922-2722 and ask about its Kids Ski Free program , which enables one child 12 and under to ski free the same number of days as his or her parents when they ski five days or more , except during Christmas week. ) Younger children , the experts explain , may be the most reluctant skiers in the family , though older ones certainly have their moments too . They may be tired after traveling or unaccustomed to the altitude . Some may never have seen snow . And like my nephew Michael , they may come from parts of the country where they never need to wear winter clothes . &quot; Parents forget how much kids have to go_through before they even get_to ski school , &quot; says Sue Way , who oversees Aspen ' s programs for younger children . ( Call the Aspen Ski Company at 800-525-6200 for details on the Tiehack Mountain ' s First Time on Skis / Snowboard three-day package , which includes three days of lessons and lift tickets for $ 129 . It guarantees all beginners will be able to ski the mountain by the end of the program , or they ' ll get a fourth day of lessons free. ) &quot; Don ' t let ski school be their first experience with organized day_care , &quot; urges Way . That , coupled with so many new faces and trying to learn to navigate on skis , may simply be too_much for many preschoolers to handle . Still , parents paying $ 50 and more a day for their kids to learn to ski can ' t help but get frustrated when the kids refuse to try . that ' s all_the more reason to invest some time beforehand preparing the pint-sized skiers-to-be in your family for the experience . Explain that ski school will be a lot like nursery_school , day_care or kindergarten , with ski lessons thrown_in . Tell the older ones how much fun they ' ll have exploring the mountain with kids their age . Even if you plan to rent the kids ' equipment at the mountain ( always a good idea in case something gets broken or doesn ' t fit properly ) , visit a ski shop near your home and let the kids clomp around in skis and boots , instructors suggest . Have a &quot; dress_up &quot; night at_home to try_on ski clothes . They ' ll need waterproof pants , layered shirts and sweater , windproof jacket , heavy socks , hat and a neck gaiter rather than a scarf for warmth . Don ' t forget goggles and sunscreen . Spread_out the trail map on the kitchen_table -- some areas such_as Aspen now have special children ' s trail maps -- and talk_about the most fun runs . Then , when you arrive , take it slow . Check_out the facilities with the kids late in the afternoon the day before you plan to start skiing . Let the kids talk to some of the instructors . Buy some new goggles , a pin for their hat , a wool headband with the mountain ' s name or a new Chapstick . If the kids still balk at the ski school door , suggest they at least try_for the morning . Promise to check_in at lunchtime . Rest assured that ski resorts have ways to reach parents on the mountain if necessary . For example , at Vail , there are boards at the top and bottom of every lift where messages are posted . &quot; But once the kids get going , they usually have a great time , &quot; says Vail ' s John Alderson , who leads workshops across the country on teaching kids to ski . ( Call 800-4-SKI-KID ( 475-4543 ) to ask_for Vail ' s Family Fun Pack , which includes the new &quot; Guide to Kids Winter Vacations in the Vail Valley. &quot; ) No matter , it ' s never easy to leave a nervous child . Just ask Carolyn Hinckley Boyle , a communications consultant who lives_in Austin , Tex . Her 6-year-old daughter Amanda was so nervous that she threw_up outside the ski school at Breckenridge , Colo . Boyle , worried but convinced that Amanda was just scared , not sick , persuaded her daughter to at least give ski school a try . &quot; I came_back and she was out skiing , smiling away , &quot; Boyle says . &quot; She thanked me for making her go. &quot; Taking the Kids appears the first and third week of every month . &quot; Taking the Kids to the Great Southwest , &quot; &quot; Taking the Kids to Sunny Southern California &quot; and &quot; Taking the Kids to Northern California &quot; by Eileen Ogintz ( HarperCollins West , $ 9.90 each ) are now in bookstores .</TEXT>
