   <TEXT> The weeping woman grabbed a stranger ' s arm -- anybody ' s would have done . She tugged and twisted it before wailing , &quot; I am trying . I am trying so hard to like him . ( Sniff ) . But I . . . ( sniff , pause , sniff ) doooon ' t. &quot; Her sobs intensified as she watched her 24-year-old daughter , wearing a black bridal dress , nuzzle the neck of her soon-to-be son-in-law one recent Saturday . Then a bell tolled , beckoning them into the Little Church of the West Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas . Daughter gave mother a thumbs up and , in front of the groom , shouted : &quot; Don ' t look so sad , Mom ! If it doesn ' t work , we can always get a divorce. &quot; That attitude , experts say , is more and more common among people in their 20s -- a generation often depicted as stuck somewhere between childhood and adulthood , not taking much of anything seriously . It ' s an attitude that worries not only parents , but also the academics , attorneys , counselors and clergy who have noticed that young people are expressing increasing indifference toward matrimony . Most people in their 20s marry with intentions of forever . But when problems -- even petty ones -- muddy the expected marital bliss , young couples are quick to call it quits . And of those who divorce within five years , experts estimate one-third of them entirely discount their first marriages . &quot; I know people who act like the first marriage is a dress_rehearsal , &quot; said Kym Jones , 24 , a saleswoman in the Northeast , voicing sentiments shared by many in her age_group . &quot; It ' s the second one that counts , the real big show. &quot; These &quot; beginner marriages &quot; concern psychologist Scott Stanley , co-director of the Center for Marital and Family Studies at the University of Denver and co-author of &quot; Fighting for Your Marriage : Positive Steps for Preventing Divorce and Preserving a Lasting Love &quot; ( Jossey-Bass , 1994 ) . &quot; Young people have this mentality of , ' Oooops , there goes my first marriage . I hope it will be better the second time , ' &quot; Stanley said . Indeed , a recent study by the National Center for Health Statistics found that married people younger than 24 have the highest chance of divorce , 33.8 % , compared to 24.7 % among couples 25 to 44 . NCHS researchers analyzed an estimated 204 # 000 marriage and divorce records of people from an 18-state region . In a separate report , preliminary 1993 data from NCHS shows that 38 % of couples between 25 and 34 divorced -- a 5 % increase from 1973 , with that group ' s population fluctuating only slightly . Researchers have produced few studies on beginner marriages . Stuart Walzer , a California divorce_lawyer for 43 years , said it ' s easy to dismiss young divorces because most do not involve children , property or other assets . &quot; Unfortunately , young people matter less since they ' re not a tremendous burden on the ( legal ) system , &quot; Walzer said . &quot; But they should matter , especially if people want divorce to decrease in the future. &quot; He advocates that marrying couples undergo a mandatory four-hour class on commitment and marital responsibilities . As a primary reason for those throw-away marriages , experts point to the bleak success rate of all American marriages over the past two decades : about half fail . After all , those in their 20s are the children of mothers , fathers and even grandparents who have severed nuptial ties . As co-owner of the Las Vegas chapel , Greg Smith has witnessed parents marrying and remarrying . He ' s also recognized their children marrying and remarrying . &quot; I don ' t know if that signals a lack of commitment , &quot; he said . He does know that a chapel minister is concerned about a casual attitude toward marriage , particularly in young people . &quot; A lot of them have requested that ( the minister ) omit the ' till death do us part , ' &quot; Smith said . &quot; As if they ' re planning for a divorce. &quot; Divorce is even called easy or &quot; no big deal &quot; by some in their 20s . &quot; A lot of young people don ' t understand what commitment means , &quot; said Marion Solomon , a West L.A. psychologist and author of &quot; Lean_on Me : The Power of Positive Dependency in Intimate Relationships &quot; ( Simon &amp; Schuster , 1994 ) . Add_to that a generation deluged with politicians , celebrities and talk_show guests bypassing accountability in favor of blaming someone else for their problems . &quot; Young people think it ' s always somebody else ' s fault if their marriage doesn ' t work , &quot; Solomon said . * In retrospect , Ronald Alexander , now 43 , is happy his seven-year marriage failed . Wed at 24 , he recalled meandering through the relationship in dazed anomie . In the beginning , &quot; the ecstasy was at a high , &quot; reflected Alexander , who has remained single since his divorce . &quot; Then it shattered , as it often does when you find_out the person sleeping next to you is not the one you thought you had married. &quot; Now he can chuckle about it . &quot; I learned a lot about who I am , &quot; said Alexander , a Santa Monica psychotherapist and chairman of the graduate psychology_department at Ryokan College in West Los Angeles . &quot; Most people in their 20s are looking_to find_out who they are . It ' s a time of uncertainty. &quot; Alexander ' s &quot; fantasy marriage &quot; also left him pondering rude romantic realities . &quot; I realized that there is no happily ever after . There is no perfect love to save you from troubles . Those are the myths of Hollywood. &quot; Ever since Lisa Conti of Anaheim watched Richard Gere save Julia Roberts from her wretched life in &quot; Pretty Woman , &quot; the 26-year-old has dreamed of marrying a similar savior . Until six months ago , when her husband abandoned their infant marriage . &quot; I can ' t believe I really thought_of marriage as so carefree and fun , &quot; she said . &quot; I now know that it ' s like hell -- you have to work hard for the bliss . I ' ll know how to do_it the second time. &quot; As insurance for her second marriage , Conti should consider exchanging vows with a partner who has also experienced a beginner marriage . NCHS found that couples remarrying are less likely to divorce than first-timers . More_than three-fourths will remarry within five years of their divorces , wrote Constance Ahrons in &quot; The Good Divorce : Keeping Your Family Together When Your Marriage Comes_Apart &quot; ( HarperCollins , 1994 ) . &quot; Divorce and remarriage are normal , &quot; said Ahrons , a USC sociology professor and associate director of its Marriage and Family Therapy Program . &quot; It ' s time young couples stopped treating the subject of divorce like blasphemy . . . . It ' s also time people started accepting ( beginner ) marriages. &quot; * Experts are debating how to curb divorce rates , particularly in young people . Some say they need premarital counseling , others advocate mandatory classes on marriage and divorce provided by high_schools or public agencies . Almost all agree , however , that living together before marriage rarely helps . In fact , a 1989 study from the University of Wisconsin discovered that couples who cohabited before marriage divorced more_than those who did not . Yolanda Baltazar , 23 , of Lomita , has advice for people in her age_group : Be traditional when it comes_to marrying . She recently celebrated her second wedding_anniversary with Ruben , 25 . She ' s never read a 1993 study in the Journal of Family Issues . It revealed that couples who espouse traditional attitudes feel more satisfied with their marriage . &quot; But I know what I ' m talking_about , &quot; Baltazar said . &quot; Marriages won ' t work without love . That is sacrifice , compromise and being able to work_through problems without maiming or killing anyone. &quot;</TEXT>
