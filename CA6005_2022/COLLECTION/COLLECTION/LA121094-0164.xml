   <HEADLINE> CLINTON LINKS FREE_TRADE , JOBS AT SUMMIT ; SPEECH : PRESIDENT ALSO LAUDS HIS OWN DOMESTIC ECONOMIC_POLICIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton opened the first summit_meeting of Western_Hemisphere leaders in a generation Friday with a call_for a new free-trade &quot; partnership for prosperity &quot; -- plus a plea to U.S. voters to credit him with the creation of millions of new jobs . In a speech to Florida political , business and civic figures before he plunged into talks with the leaders of 33 other countries , Clinton said the weekend ' s giant meeting will cement a new kind of relationship between the United States and its newly democratic and prosperous neighbors to the south . &quot; History has given the peoples of the Americas a dazzling opportunity to build a community of nations committed to the values of liberty , progress and prosperity , &quot; he said . But he also delivered a fervent domestic political pitch , saying his economic_policies are working better than most Americans realize -- in part through the creation of free-trade areas like the one that will be this summit ' s centerpiece . &quot; If we ' re successful , the summit will lead to more jobs , opportunity and prosperity , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; If we act wisely , then we can make this new_world work for us . Trade can be a benefit for our people. &quot; Seeking to link his economic diplomacy and his domestic agenda , the President noted that increased U.S. exports create high-wage jobs -- and may even have begun to halt the 20-year stagnation in real wages that he has long decried . &quot; We hope that we are seeing the beginning of the end of a 20-year trend in stagnant wages , and the beginning of the restoration of the American_dream by reaching_out to the world , &quot; he said . &quot; Every American worker in every part of the United States should be glad that we are here at the Summit of the Americas , &quot; he added . A Central_American official at the summit said Latin governments understand Clinton ' s need to pitch his message to a U.S. domestic audience . &quot; We saw the election returns just as you did , &quot; he said . Still , the President ' s decision to scrap an initial draft of his speech , which concentrated_on the advances of democracy in Latin_America , and turn it into a domestic political message reflects a resolve in the White_House to turn every occasion to Clinton ' s most urgent priority : rehabilitating his appeal_to voters who elected him in 1992 but turned_away in 1994 . &quot; This has been our message for a long_time , &quot; White_House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said , &quot; but it hasn ' t been noticed . So he has to keep making the point. &quot; From a public-image standpoint , other officials noted , Clinton won ' t have many opportunities during the summit to address domestic issues , since his appearances will be tied more closely to the meeting ' s core agenda : free_trade , democracy and economic development . * Officials said they expect Clinton , as the summit host , to make two major announcements during the weekend : the leaders ' agreement to begin work toward an Americas Free_Trade Area , to be in place by the year 2005 , and an immediate invitation to Chile to join the United States , Mexico and Canada in the year-old North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Chile is being allowed into NAFTA first because it is &quot; further along with economic reform ( and ) with an open economy than other countries in the region , &quot; Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown said . Chile was given a choice between joining NAFTA or negotiating a separate free-trade agreement , and it decided simply to adhere to the accord already in place , he said . According to drafts of their expected declarations that have circulated widely , the summit leaders also plan to launch new cooperative efforts to curb drug trafficking and money_laundering , protect the environment and promote human_rights , education and health . But Clinton barely mentioned those efforts in his speech , concentrating instead on selling the benefits of wider trade to a wary U.S. public . The new , hemisphere-wide free-trade area could help create more_than a_million new jobs , he said -- &quot; good-paying jobs ; on average , export-related jobs pay 17 % more_than average wages. &quot; White_House officials distributed a fact sheet saying U.S. exports to Latin_America accounted_for 1.3 million jobs last year and produced a trade surplus of more_than $ 4 billion . Clinton ' s comment that the 20-year period of stagnating real wages might be ending appeared to be something of a throwaway line . But it reflected his search for a new way to persuade voters that the economy has changed for the better under his Administration . Asked about the long-term trend in wages , Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich said the picture was , in fact , mixed ; well-educated workers are seeing their incomes increase while unskilled workers are seeing theirs decline , he said . Other economists dispute the idea that wages have been flat , saying total compensation has in fact increased over the last two decades . The Summit of the Americas , as it is officially named , is the first gathering of the leaders of the Western_Hemisphere since 1967 , when then-President Lyndon B . Johnson traveled_to a similar meeting in Punta del Este , Uruguay . Clinton pointed_out that in 1967 , 10 of the nations of the Western_Hemisphere lived under dictatorships of the left or right . Today , after the restoration of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as Haiti ' s elected president , every independent country in the hemisphere is democratic -- with the sole exception of Communist-ruled Cuba , whose leader , Fidel Castro , was not invited . In his speech at the Jackie Gleason Theater for the Performing Arts in Miami Beach -- once the site of the rotund comedian ' s television revue -- Clinton drew his biggest applause from the Florida audience when he reaffirmed the U.S. policy of economic pressure on the Castro regime . &quot; We support the Cuban people ' s desire for peaceful democratic change , &quot; he said . &quot; And we hope by the next time we have one of these summits . . . a democratic Cuba will take its place at the table of nations. &quot;</TEXT>
