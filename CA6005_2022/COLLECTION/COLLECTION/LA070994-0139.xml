   <HEADLINE> KREMLIN PREPARES REFORM OF BOLSHOI ; THEATER : PENDING MANAGEMENT CHANGES MAY MEAN LOSS OF JOBS FOR TOP-LEVEL EMPLOYEES , BUT ARTISTS WELCOME THE DEMISE OF ANOTHER ' TOTALITARIAN DRAGON. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Any day now , theater insiders say , a big shake-up is finally going_to hit the Big Theater -- better known as the Bolshoi , Russia ' s premier performance center . Scandal has been simmering at the Bolshoi for years as the prestigious theater , long seen as the crowning glory of Russian culture , bled top performers to the West and engaged in vicious in-fighting over its artistic program . But only this week did the Kremlin indicate at long last that it would intervene . Sergei Filatov , President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s chief_of_staff , told the Itar-Tass news_agency Thursday that a pending decree would put the Bolshoi ' s staff on a new employment plan &quot; on the basis of a contract system and competition. &quot; In other words , Bolshoi workers believe , none of their jobs are safe anymore -- particularly those of the theater ' s longtime creative masters -- ballet czar Yuri Grigorovich , opera director Yevgeny Raykov and orchestra leader Alexander Lazarev . The Moscow newspaper Vecherny Klub , or Evening Club , reported this week that the theater ' s general director , Vladimir Kokonin , had &quot; liquidated &quot; those top creative posts in_order to exercise more power himself over what performances the Bolshoi puts_on , since he bears ultimate responsibility . In fact , Bolshoi officials said Friday , no jobs have actually been eliminated . The theater employs some 2 # 000 people , including 200 in opera , 200 in ballet and 200 in the orchestra . &quot; No one has been fired yet . No one has seen this decree yet , &quot; said the Bolshoi ' s deputy director , Valery Zakharov . &quot; It is too early to speak about any changes. &quot; If , however , the Bolshoi is indeed in_for sweeping change at the top , the news will bring rejoicing in many quarters , especially from performers bitterly disillusioned by how the theater is run . &quot; The decree would be a most welcome step that would finally destroy one of the last remaining strongholds of the Soviet totalitarian regime in Russia , &quot; said Gediminis Taranda , formerly one of the brightest stars of the Bolshoi ballet . &quot; First , the KGB network in the theater fell , then the Communist_Party organization and now this system of artistic directors , which is the third head of the old totalitarian dragon still riding the chariot of the Bolshoi. &quot; Taranda was fired last February -- technically for missing some performances while he was working abroad , but actually , it appears , because he had been leading an opposition movement within the theater . Moscow theater_critic Anatoly Agamirov also hailed the prospect of new blood in the Bolshoi leadership , saying that the theater had turned_into &quot; a big collective farm. &quot; &quot; The director and head masters -- that is artistic directors -- ruled over everything the way they saw fit , and performers -- ballet_dancers , singers and orchestra members -- led a very miserable existence , being totally dependent_on the whims of their masters , &quot; he said . He noted that ballet master Grigorovich had not produced a new ballet in 15 years , though he had rearranged and revived a_few old productions . The Bolshoi ' s opera and ballet repertories have become a particular bone of contention over the past five years , narrowing in Moscow to four or five operas a month -- almost all by Russian composers -- and about as_many ballets . Critics and performers complained that the Bolshoi was growing ever mustier , losing its creative edge just at the moment when it could have been taking_advantage of its post-Communist creative freedom . Dozens of top Bolshoi stars have left in recent years to work for other Russian theaters or abroad , where they enjoy more artistic liberty and incomparably bigger salaries . Among them were such celebrities as ballet stars Maya Plisetskaya , Andris Liepa and Irek Mukhamedov , as well as top singers Vladimir Atlantov , Tamara Milashkina and others . Indeed , the atmosphere at the Bolshoi appears amazingly poisonous . A half-dozen actors and musicians contacted by The Times on Friday would speak only if they could remain anonymous . One official called_back from a phone_booth and exclaimed , &quot; Don ' t you know that all_the phones in the theater are tapped ? &quot; Some used the terms &quot; snake pit &quot; and &quot; hornets ' nest &quot; to describe the ambience at_work . Bolshoi performers have good reason to be depressed . Although they work_at what is probably Russia ' s most renowned cultural institution , mid-level performers generally earn only about $ 100 a month . Most depend heavily on foreign tours , during which they can earn from $ 30 to $ 100 a day . Those foreign earnings are meant in part to cover expenses , but most performers bring canned_food from home to avoid shelling_out their precious allowances . Even their building may be_on the verge of collapse . Built over an underground river , the columned pink Bolshoi edifice in central Moscow is in drastic need of repair , and officials say it may need to close next year . Adding further to the gloom are employees ' fears that life under Kokonin , the general director , may be no better than under their current masters . Like the artistic directors , Kokonin , too , is a leftover from the old Soviet days of Communist control of the arts .</TEXT>
