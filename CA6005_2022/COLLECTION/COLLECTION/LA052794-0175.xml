   <HEADLINE> FLORIDA GOVERNOR SIGNS TOUGH NEW ANTI-TOBACCO LEGISLATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Lawton Chiles signed a law Thursday touted as the nation ' s toughest anti-tobacco measure , giving Florida new legal tools to sue tobacco companies for the costs of caring for Medicaid patients stricken by smoking-related illnesses . The move came just days after Mississippi sued 13 cigarette manufacturers seeking to make them reimburse taxpayers for the cost of smoking-related illnesses . &quot; We ' re going to take the Marlboro man to court , &quot; Chiles said . &quot; With this law , Florida sends a loud and clear message to the tobacco giants that they will be held accountable for sponsoring sickness and death. &quot; Walker Merryman , a vice_president of the Tobacco Institute , which represents the nation ' s cigarette makers , said he knew of no similar state law . &quot; This bill cheats thousands of Florida businesses and legitimate products out of the right to evidentiary protection and defenses , &quot; the institute said in a statement . If the law is not repealed in next month ' s special legislative session , the tobacco_industry will challenge its constitutionality , the institute said . The law , which takes_effect July 1 , enables the state to file class-action lawsuits against tobacco companies , holding them individually and collectively liable for smoking-related health_care costs paid by taxpayers . Officials say the state has spent $ 1.2 billion in Medicaid funds treating poor people with smoking-related diseases since 1989 . Traditionally , individual plaintiffs suing tobacco companies have had to show a direct link between physical harm and the company ' s tobacco . Under the new law , the state would be able to use statistics about smoking to show the link . &quot; It ' s taxpayer money we ' re going to try to get_back , &quot; Chiles said . &quot; It ' s being used to subsidize the profitability of some of the largest conglomerates in the country. &quot;</TEXT>
