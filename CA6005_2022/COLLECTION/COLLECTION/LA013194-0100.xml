   <HEADLINE> LAWMAKERS JUMP_ON ' 3 STRIKES ' BANDWAGON ; CRIME : SEVERAL BILLS THAT WOULD PUT HABITUAL CRIMINALS IN PRISON FOR GOOD GAIN SUPPORT IN THE LEGISLATURE . ALSO , AN INITIATIVE DRIVE IS WINNING SIGNATURES . BUT SOME DISTRICT_ATTORNEYS ARE SKEPTICAL OF ITS IMPACT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sponsored by a father whose daughter was murdered by a parolee , and favored by an electorate angry about crime , the &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; initiative is winning political support up and down California . Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren gives it his &quot; unqualified support. &quot; Gov . Pete Wilson endorses it . So do Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls Kathleen Brown and John Garamendi . Legislators are rushing to pass legislation mimicking the initiative . Criminal justice experts say the proposed initiative would create the harshest sentencing system in the nation for habitual_criminals . But in courthouses around the state , district_attorneys are skeptical that the initiative will do what its backers claim , and many prosecutors are opposing the popular idea . &quot; The root of all_of this is fear , &quot; said Los Angeles Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti . &quot; People are fearful for the safety of their loved ones and themselves , and angry that people who commit these crimes get_out of prison. &quot; Although Garcetti believes habitual violent criminals must be locked_up , he opposes the three strikes initiative . The way the initiative is worded , Garcetti said , a three-time felon could be sent to prison for life without committing any violent crimes . A juvenile age 16 who commits two residential burglaries and is sentenced in the juvenile system would amass &quot; two strikes , &quot; Garcetti said . In the extreme , the same person caught passing a bad_check for $ 500 a_few years later could be looking_at a sentence of life in prison . &quot; We cannot afford it , &quot; Garcetti said . &quot; We ' re going to have a tremendous jury backlash . Jurors are going_to require more proof than ( the current standard of ) ' beyond reasonable doubt. ' &quot; A year ago , the Assembly Committee on Public Safety , then controlled by liberal Democrats , refused to pass a three strikes bill carried_on behalf of Mike Reynolds , whose daughter was killed by a repeat felon outside a Fresno restaurant in 1992 . Reynolds resorted_to an initiative , essentially turning the legislation sponsored by Assemblymen Bill Jones ( R-Fresno ) and Jim Costa ( D-Hanford ) into the proposition heading for the November ballot . Using much of his life savings , along with donations from the National Rifle Assn. , the Gun Owners of California , and the California prison_guard union , Reynolds set_out to gather the required 385 # 000 valid signatures of registered voters to place it on the ballot . The proposal grabbed attention across the state when Richard Allen Davis , a habitual_criminal on parole , was arrested for the murder of Polly Klaas , a 12-year-old Petaluma girl kidnaped from a slumber_party while her mother was at_home . If the initiative had been law at the time of his earlier crimes , Davis would not have been_on the streets . In the days after Davis ' arrest , so many people called Reynolds ' 800 number that the entire 800 system became jammed in Fresno , where he lives . On some days , 20 # 000 people have signed his petitions . Reynolds , who has gathered more_than half the necessary signatures , said he will drop the initiative only if the Legislature approves and Gov . Wilson signs the Jones-Costa bill . With the signature-gathering continuing , the Legislature has had an apostasy . At its first hearing of 1994 , the Assembly Public Safety Committee revived and approved the Jones-Costa bill endorsed by Reynolds , and passed four other pieces of &quot; three strikes &quot; legislation , each of which would put three-time losers behind bars for life . They differ primarily in the kinds of crimes that are counted for each strike . The Assembly Ways and Means Committee approved the same five bills last week , even though no fiscal analyst knows how much they would cost -- except that it will be in the billions . The full Assembly is set to vote on the measures today . All of the bills would dramatically toughen the laws under which California judges sentence habitual_criminals , and keep repeat felons like Davis in prison for life . Since 1986 , California has had a statute that provides_for life sentences for habitual_criminals . But the law is so narrow that fewer than 50 people have been sentenced under it . An aide to Garcetti could find no instances in which it had been imposed on a repeat felon in Los Angeles County . The statute says judges can impose life sentences on felons who inflict &quot; great bodily injury &quot; on their victims , but only if the criminal has served two previous prison_terms for violent felonies . That combination of crimes and sentences is rare . California ranks 17th among states in its rate of imprisonment and has the largest prison population in the nation -- 120 # 000 . The Little Hoover Commission , a government watchdog group , reported recently that 43 % of the state ' s inmates are violent offenders , down from more_than 60 % in the 1970s . At the same time , the number of felons in prison for burglary and drug offenses has risen sharply . Reynolds ' three strikes initiative proposes to imprison for life people who commit violent or serious crimes , which are enumerated in the Penal Code . They include crimes such_as murder , rape , arson , child molestation , some property crimes such_as residential burglary , and some drug offenses . The number of felons who would fall_into the initiative ' s net is not known . But the initiative ' s proponents say several thousand criminals a year could receive life terms . The Department of Corrections is working_on an estimate , but is not expected to complete its work for another week . The legislative analyst estimates the expense at several billion dollars in prison construction , plus additional costs of incarceration that over time could reach more_than $ 1 billion annually . In another part of the initiative , Reynolds seeks to double the sentences of people who commit a second serious or violent offense . He said the two-time loser provision may be the initiative ' s most important component . Its goal is to keep violent second-time offenders behind bars until they pass age 40 . Statistics show that criminals become less violent once they reach middle_age . But the public focus of the initiative is_on three-time losers . Criminals who have been convicted of two serious or violent felonies would face a virtual lifetime behind bars if they commit a third felony . The initiative pegs the sentence for three-time losers at 25 years to life , or three times the current prison_term for the third felony , whichever is greater . The initiative says the third crime may be any felony , though Reynolds said prosecutors would not be compelled to seek life sentences against people who commit minor crimes on a third offense . &quot; District_attorneys will make the legislation work , no matter what , &quot; said Fresno County Dist . Atty . Ed Hunt , who supports the initiative . If a crime is minor , he said , &quot; You don ' t have to file it as a felony. &quot; For three-time losers , the initiative would mean a return to the system of indeterminate sentencing in which felons are given open-ended terms of up_to life in prison and must win release from parole boards . The Legislature did_away_with most indeterminate sentences in 1977 when it passed the determinate sentencing system , which set specific terms for almost all crimes other_than murder . At a minimum , someone sentenced to life under the initiative would serve 20 years . Reynolds says most three-time losers would die in prison , or spend virtually all their lives behind bars . Opponents believe repeat felons will demand jury trials if they face life sentences . In San Mateo County , 45 prosecutors tried 85 jury trials in 1993 . Dist . Atty . Jim Fox estimated that under the initiative , 400 people a year could face life terms in his county . &quot; We are looking_at judicial gridlock , &quot; Fox said , adding that he would need more_than twice the number of attorneys to handle the new work . Given that criminal cases take precedence over civil lawsuits , he said , &quot; the civil system as we know it will no longer exist. &quot; California ' s proposed initiative borrows the name from the three strikes initiative passed_by voters in Washington state last November . But unlike the California measure , Washington ' s initiative requires that three-time losers commit one of 25 &quot; most serious crimes &quot; before receiving life without parole . &quot; California is a step_up from ( Washington ' s ) three strikes , &quot; said John Carlson , a radio commentator in Seattle and sponsor of Washington ' s measure . He estimates that 50 to 70 criminals a year will be sentenced to life under Washington ' s new statute . Washington prisons_house about 11 # 000 inmates . Florida may have the most widely used statute aimed at habitual_criminals . Prosecutors use it 2 # 000 times a year , said James Austin , executive_vice_president of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency . Of the 55 # 000 inmates in Florida prisons , 15 # 000 have life sentences . As an alternative to the initiative , the California District_Attorneys Assn . is backing a bill by first-term Assemblyman Richard K . Rainey ( R-Walnut Creek ) . A former sheriff of Contra Costa County , Rainey fashioned a bill that would impose sentences of life or life without parole for violent and serious habitual_criminals . Assemblyman Tom Umberg ( D-Garden Grove ) is pushing a separate bill that would impose life without parole on people who commit a second crime against children . Felons who are convicted of a third violent felony also would receive mandatory sentences of life without parole . Assemblyman Ross Johnson ( R-Placentia ) has a less detailed proposal . It simply states that people who commit a third violent felony shall be sentenced to life without parole . In the upper house , Sen . Rob Hurtt ( R-Garden Grove ) and Sen . Phil Wyman ( R-Tehachapi ) have bills identical to the initiative and the Jones-Costa bill . Rainey ' s measure appears to have the most legislative support . It would impose sentences of life in prison without parole on criminals convicted of a third violent felony . It also would impose life with the possibility of parole for someone who commits a serious felony as a third offense . &quot; We are only talking_about the most violent people in society -- the people we have not been able to turn_around and who have proven they are going_to continue to commit violent crimes , &quot; Rainey said . Rainey estimated his bill could result in the imprisonment of perhaps a_few hundred to a_few thousand habitual_criminals annually , although no detailed analysis has been done . Had Rainey ' s bill been law , it would have kept Richard Allen Davis , as well as the killer of Reynolds ' daughter , off the streets . Criminal justice experts , meanwhile , remain skeptical that more prisons will have much impact on the overall crime_rate . The number of people in California prisons has quadrupled since the 1970s , but the crime_rate has remained relatively unchanged . Many experts say the emphasis should be placed on diverting young people from gangs and violence . Austin at the Nation Council on Crime and Delinquency warned that the three strikes movement could end_up worsening the crime problem by forcing the government to take money from prevention programs to pay_for prisons . The three strikes measure also could result in the incarceration of_aging felons who often are of little threat . &quot; While there may be moral justifications for locking_up offenders , imprisonment appears to have little impact on the amount of crime experiences in local communities , &quot; Joan Petersilia , a criminal justice expert at the RAND Corp. , wrote last year . She noted that much predatory crime is committed by juveniles too young for prison , or by young adults unlikely to be sent to prison for most first-felony convictions . People under age 18 account_for a fifth of the population but 30 % of the arrests for the seven most serious crimes . Statewide , 19 % of the homicide arrests in 1992 were of juveniles under age 18 , and 16.6 % were of young adults age 18 or 19 . At the Hall of Justice in Los Angeles , Garcetti supports Rainey ' s bill but has doubts that any three strikes measure will dramatically cut crime , unless there is more help for troubled youths . &quot; Unless we are willing to go_after youngsters at a much earlier age , &quot; Garcetti said , &quot; the three strikes initiative and building all_the prisons in the world is not going_to make this a better place to live . We have to restore hope , especially for our ethnic minorities . . . . Three strikes is needed . But if that is all we ' re going to do , we truly are spitting in the wind. &quot; ' Three Strikes ' Proposals There are at least half_a_dozen proposals being offered to impose life sentences on three-time losers . Each targets people who commit violent or serious crimes , which are defined in the California Penal Code . * Violent felonies include murder , mayhem , rape , child molestation , a felony in which a defendant uses a gun , a felony in which a defendant inflicts great bodily injury , robbery in a home , some arson , use of a bomb , kidnaping and carjacking . * Serious felonies include residential burglary , robbery , attempted murder , assault with intent to rape or rob , grand theft of a gun , assault with a deadly weapon against a police_officer and selling , giving or offering heroin , cocaine , PCP or methamphetamine to a minor . THE MAJOR PROPOSALS Here are some of the proposals and the series of crimes that would make a defendant subject_to a ' three strikes ' penalty : THREE STRIKES INITIATIVE * First offense : Any serious or violent felony . * Second offense : Anyone convicted of a second serious or violent felony must be sentenced to twice the prison_term now in_effect . * Third offense : Anyone convicted of a third felony , whether or not it is serious or violent , would be sentenced to three times the term or 25 years to life , whichever is greater . There is no requirement that the first two stem from separate prosecutions . * Juvenile offenses : Serious or violent felonies committed by youths 16 or 17 count as strikes , even if the juvenile was not tried as an adult . * ASSEMBLY BILL 971 Assemblymen Bill Jones ( R-Fresno ) and Jim Costa ( D-Hanford ) * Identical to the initiative . * ASSEMBLY BILL 1568 Assemblyman Richard K . Rainey ( R-Walnut Creek ) * First offense : Any serious or violent felony . * Second offense : Imposes 10 years more in prison beyond the current sentence for a second violent felony , and five more years for a second serious felony . * Third offense : Life without parole for anyone convicted of a violent felony , or anyone convicted of a serious felony if the first two were violent . Life with possible parole for anyone convicted of a serious felony . * Juvenile crimes : Not counted as strikes unless the juvenile was tried as an adult . * ASSEMBLY BILL 167 Assemblyman Tom Umberg ( D-Garden Grove ) * First offense : Any violent or serious felony , excluding burglary and furnishing drugs to a minor . Requires additional job training and education , and intensive parole supervision upon the felon ' s release . * Second offense : Life without parole for anyone convicted of a second violent crime against a child under the age of 14 , including molestation . * Third offense : Life without parole for criminals convicted of third violent and serious felonies , excluding burglary and furnishing drugs to a minor . * Juvenile crimes : May be counted as prior felonies .</TEXT>
