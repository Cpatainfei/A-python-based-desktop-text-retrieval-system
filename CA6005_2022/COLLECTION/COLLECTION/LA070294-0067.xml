   <HEADLINE> BRAZIL INTRODUCES NEW CURRENCY ; ECONOMY : THE CHANGE WAS PART OF THE EIGHTH ECONOMIC PLAN IN 12 YEARS . THE GOAL IS TO DRIVE DOWN CHRONIC INFLATION , WHICH EXCEEDED 2 # 700 % LAST YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Manuel Lira dos Santos spread his thick , muscled arms out toward the throng of buyers and vegetable and meat vendors haggling over prices Friday in the huge outdoor weekly Ipanema market . He sighed . &quot; Everybody is a little crazy today , &quot; he said from behind the stand where he sells chicken parts . &quot; You can feel it . Everybody is a little nuts today. &quot; And why shouldn ' t they be ? The entire country changed money in what may be one of the globe ' s largest currency swaps . For Brazil , the exchange was part of its eighth economic plan in 12 years , the latest effort to drive down the dizzying inflation that has plagued this country for more_than a decade . On Friday , from remote patches in the Amazon to the huge commercial center of Sao Paulo , a nation of 155 million people -- who participate in the world ' s eighth-largest economy -- began switching $ 5 billion worth of cruzeiro reals to the real , a new currency pegged to the U.S. dollar , in what one economist likened to &quot; changing the engine on a 747 while it ' s still in flight. &quot; Government officials hope that the new currency , backed by $ 40 billion in reserves , can beat_down inflation , which last year topped 2 # 700 % and which was running at 50 % for just last month . In brief , the theory is that Brazil ' s money change will break the inflationary psychology : There will be fewer units of currency chasing_after goods , and the value of the money will be more firmly anchored . Analysts predict that the plan will almost surely have an immediate impact , possibly pushing inflation down to a mere 2 % monthly by mid-August . The question , for which nobody has an answer , is how long this will last . On Friday , the confusion , hope , frustration and anxiety among shoppers around Dos Santos ' stand stood as microcosm of a nation that is greeting a new plan that effectively has forced everyone to deal with high mathematics to calculate what costs what . &quot; I won ' t pay in reals ! I won ' t pay in reals ! &quot; shouted one woman as she eyed Dos Santos ' prices posted in the new currency . He calmed her by reminding her that cruzeiros are still good for a time , then whipped out his pocket_calculator to figure the price in the old money . &quot; Normally , almost nobody brings a calculator , but , today , everybody has one , &quot; Dos Santos said as he punched_in the numbers : 2 # 700 cruzeiro reals for one real . Customers , however , remain confused . &quot; What is two reals ? &quot; one woman whispered to her husband as she eyed Dos Santos ' chicken necks . Confusion on Friday kept shoppers away , vendors agreed , particularly in the poorer sections of town where the uneducated and even the merchants had difficulty figuring prices . Shoppers are particularly wary because most merchants have increased prices sharply in anticipation of government steps to freeze them , as part of the real-linked inflation fight ; incomes were virtually frozen , as the government did_away_with monthly salary increases , designed to keep_up with inflation . &quot; Sometimes I think I ' m hallucinating when I see the prices , &quot; said lawyer Vera Lucia Viana , shaking her head at Dos Santos ' wares . She was discussing a major criticism of the government anti-inflation plan , an objection that has been raised particularly by union leaders , such_as Vicente Paulo da Silva , president of the largest union in Latin_America . Opponents say the plan has eroded worker salaries and &quot; frozen the poor in their misery. &quot; But economists , such_as Helio Portocarrero , a university professor and head of the local Economics Council , are unconcerned . &quot; The prices which are unrealistic will have to come_back down as the currency stabilizes , &quot; he said . Paulo claims that the real comes suspiciously at a time when it could help the presidential campaign of Fernando Henrique Cardoso , the former finance_minister who devised the plan . Cardoso , now trailing front-runner Luis Inacio Lula da Silva in the polls , has staked much of his campaign on the plan ' s success . &quot; If it works , it will certainly make me look much more favorably on him , &quot; said Joao Paulo Loureiro Martin , 54 , a marble salesman at the market . As for Dos Santos , he doesn ' t really care about Cardoso ; he just hopes that the plan will be good for business . Economists hope so too , but not immediately . If consumers embark_on a buying spree , they fear , it will fuel inflation . Consequently , banks are expected to raise interest_rates to 5 % monthly to make saving more desirable . High interest_rates will also boost the economy by attracting foreign investment , which already has been_on the upswing in anticipation of the real .</TEXT>
