   <TEXT> Standing_in a quiet neighborhood in West Hills , real_estate_agent Brett Howard glances furtively at a house across the street . The lender foreclosed on this house in January . But Howard doesn ' t have to knock_on the door to tell that people are still there . Trash containers on the side are_full , and , through a slit in the drawn blinds , Howard can see that someone has just turned_off a lamp . &quot; They ' re living there for free now , so they ' re in no hurry to get_out , &quot; Howard says , jotting the license_plate number of the car_parked in front of the house . Last week ' s visit was Howard ' s fourth in a month to this address . Pretty soon , he says , &quot; we ' ll be back with a marshal and a locksmith . The marshal will escort them out and we ' ll change all_the locks. &quot; Howard checks properties for Ron Prechtl , a real_estate_agent at Century 21 Lamb Realtors in Northridge who specializes in selling foreclosed properties for lenders . These days Howard is_on the move a lot , and his workload is about to get heavier . Back in Prechtl ' s office , a team of four others is fielding a flood of price requests from banks on houses soon to be foreclosed -- many of them properties damaged by the Jan . 17 earthquake . Most lenders gave homeowners with quake damage a three-month break on mortgage payments , but that moratorium has expired , and banks are starting to serve default notices , so other borrowers are walking away from their homes . &quot; The pipeline of foreclosures is beginning to fill_up again , &quot; Prechtl says . Prechtl , 33 , had his best year ever in 1993 , selling about 140 houses , more_than half foreclosures . His office grossed $ 750 # 000 in_commissions , from which Prechtl pays_out big overhead expenses . Through April this year , he ' s sold another 75 properties , and he expects the new_wave of foreclosures from the earthquake to keep him busy until at least the end of next year . &quot; It ' s absolutely going_to come , &quot; Prechtl says . &quot; We ' re bracing ourselves. &quot; Foreclosure proceedings typically take four months , so many quake-damaged properties repossessed by banks won ' t hit the market until late summer . But when they do , they will add_to an already-overabundant supply of recession-triggered foreclosures in the San Fernando Valley , which has helped drive down Valley housing prices to 1988 levels . Last year lenders repossessed a record 3 # 650 single-family houses and condominiums in the Valley -- 20 times more_than in 1990 , according to TRW-REDI Property Data in Riverside . And Valley foreclosures were up 38 % in the first_quarter of this year , compared to the same period in 1993 . Banks don ' t want foreclosed properties on their books , so they often dump them at fire-sale prices , which keeps driving down prices . Through April of this year , the resale price of an existing single-family house in the Valley averaged $ 230 # 080 -- down 9 % for all_of last year , and down from a peak of $ 296 # 675 in 1990 , says the San Fernando Valley Assn . of Realtors . The drop_in the median price has been even more severe . In April , house buyers in the Valley paid a median price of $ 179 # 000 , down 12 % from $ 204 # 000 a year earlier . The median price is the point at which half the houses sold cost more_than $ 179 # 000 and half cost less . &quot; We haven ' t seen the bottom of prices fall_out yet , &quot; says Catherine McKinley , a real_estate consultant in Newhall and a former vice_president at Pasadena-based Countrywide Funding , the nation ' s largest mortgage lender . McKinley , who has been helping homeowners hurt by the quake , doesn ' t see Valley housing prices rebounding until the end of next year . And then , she says , &quot; It ' s going_to be a slow and gradual ride back_up the mountain. &quot; Prices fell even though single-family house sales in the Valley rose 12 % last year , and through April sales were running 22 % above last year ' s pace . Meanwhile , the inventory of houses for_sale last month dropped to a seven-year low of 6 # 280 . &quot; This is the strangest market I ' ve ever dealt with , &quot; says Dale Fay , owner of Century 21 Oak_Tree in Valley Village , who has been in real_estate since 1961 . Resurging demand for houses is supposed to push prices up , she says . &quot; But this is defying all_the curves , all_the projections , just everything. &quot; Fay ' s 20 sales agents sold 15 houses in April , a_few more_than a year earlier . But eight of them were foreclosures , Fay says , and the average price of those 15 houses sold was down about $ 100 # 000 from April , 1990 . &quot; What ' s going_to happen when we see another glut of foreclosures ? &quot; she asks worriedly . Foreclosures aren ' t the only reason for the sinking resale price of houses . Low mortgage interest_rates in the past year have lured a lot of first-time buyers , who generally start_out with smaller and cheaper houses , lowering the overall resale price . And after the earthquake , brokers say , many homeowners decided to sell damaged properties &quot; as is &quot; at a big discount . Lance Brown , 24 , fits both categories . A Los Angeles city employee , Brown last month bought his first home , a three-bedroom , two-bathroom house in Mission Hills . The house went_on the market in November at $ 154 # 000 . But after the quake caused some cosmetic damage to the property , the owner re-listed it at $ 139 # 000 , and Brown bought_it for just $ 125 # 000 . Brown got_in with just a 3 % down_payment , the rest financed through a 30-year mortgage at a fixed rate of 8 % . Brown says he ' s already fixed most of the quake damage himself . &quot; I know I got a good_deal , &quot; he says . But across the street from Brown ' s house are two other properties that will probably soon be added_to the stockpile of Valley foreclosures . One owner lost his business and was overcome by personal bills . The second property , a five-bedroom , two-story house , was badly damaged by the quake . Cracks ran_along many of the walls , lumps formed on water-damaged ceilings , and the block wall was a pile of rubble . Shortly after the quake , neighbors say , the brothers who lived there packed up and moved to Arizona . They apparently took the toilet in one of the bathrooms because it was ripped_out . &quot; They take what they can get , &quot; said Howard , the Century 21 agent who inspects properties . &quot; Now some contractor will probably buy_it , fix it up and sell it . This house you can probably get pretty cheap . The bank doesn ' t want it. &quot; Mortgage lenders say borrowers can avoid a smear on their credit record by trying to work_out a solution with the mortgage holder . More financial_institutions today are willing to strike unusual deals with quake victims such_as &quot; short payoffs , &quot; in which a lender agrees to accept less than full repayment on a mortgage if the property is sold . This enables the borrower in_effect to walk away and keep his credit rating intact . Some lenders are also offering secondary loans , or a restructuring of the mortgage , so borrowers can have lower monthly payments . Lenders , however , are generally not extending the three-month payment moratorium . Karin Hopkins , manager of the loan department at Glendale Federal Bank , says the savings and loan has been aggressive in arranging short payoffs , once viewed by financial_institutions as anathema . Glendale Federal expects a loss of about $ 15 million from short payoffs , foreclosures and other problems from borrowers affected by the earthquake . Glendale Federal ' s current supply of repossessions are up 5 % from a year earlier , but Hopkins says it ' s unclear whether a big wave of foreclosures is coming . &quot; From talking to borrowers , there are a lot of people rebuilding , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s anybody ' s guess what ' s going_to happen. &quot; Chatsworth-based Great Western Bank , the nation ' s second-largest savings and loan , says 2 # 000 borrowers asked_for a temporary deferment on their loans . Of that number , about 250 reported they had major structural damage and did not have quake insurance . &quot; We have no idea how many will be foreclosure cases , &quot; said spokeswoman Linda Mueller . But if all 250 homes with major damage have to be taken_back by Great Western , Mueller says that at an average loan amount of $ 130 # 000 , it will cost the S &amp; L $ 32 million . Banks and S &amp; Ls want to avoid foreclosures because the properties are costly to maintain and sell . Some lenders dispose_of repossessed properties through auctions or through bulk sales to Wall_Street firms , many of which then contract with people like Ken Westfall to sell the foreclosed real_estate . His firm , Westfall &amp; Co . based in Denver , Colo. , had an abundance of foreclosures in that state in the 1980s . But now much of Westfall ' s work is in California . Currently he has about 1 # 000 properties on the market in California , of which 350 are in the San Fernando Valley . Westfall often fixes_up foreclosed properties that need repairs , and then he farms them out_to local real_estate_brokers . Westfall says he tries not to dump the houses in the market , but he knows of clearinghouses like his that flood the market with foreclosed real_estate at cut-rate prices . &quot; It ' s just to get_rid_of the volume , &quot; he says . Westfall thinks there ' s a lot of pent-up demand in Southern California , but he says buyers lack confidence . &quot; I don ' t see the number of foreclosed properties diminishing until the middle of next year. &quot; Whether sold in auctions , through clearinghouses or brokers , the large volume of foreclosures overall drives down other home values , because appraisals are generally made by comparing the last three houses sold in that area . Foreclosures also make_it harder for would-be trade-up sellers to compete , so they can ' t unload their properties and move_up in the market . Leonard L . Schapira , a Hermosa Beach lawyer , has about 100 homeowners for clients , including many in the Valley , who are trying to renegotiate their mortgages . Many of them bought their homes at the height of the market in the late 1980s , now they ' ve lost their equity or they owe more_than the property is worth because of the housing slump . Some of his clients are struggling with big quake repairs bills . Schapira says some lenders are agreeing to accept short payoffs and restructuring interest_rates and monthly payments . Schapira says he ' s arranged short payoffs for as much as $ 340 # 000 off the principal balance of a mortgage . But he says some lenders are giving homeowners little choice but to walk away . One lender , he says , wanted a $ 35 # 000 contribution from a client of his in mitigation of a short payoff . The borrower balked , Schapira says . &quot; I ' ve had clients who have thrown_up their arms and walked away because the banks were completely unreasonable , &quot; said Schapira , whose business has doubled this year . Even excluding these cases , Schapira says lenders have told him that for &quot; every borrower who attempts to work with the bank to save his credit , two or three don ' t bother and they just walk away. &quot; Foreclosure Boom in the Valley Housing Market Single-family house sales are up , and inventory is way down . So why are prices still falling ? Because last year there was a record of foreclosed houses in the Valley , and bank repossessions continue to climb this year because of the long recession . But this summer more owners of earthquake-damaged properties are expected to also walk away from their houses . Often these foreclosed houses are sold at fire-sale prices , which keeps driving down prices for the overall market .
