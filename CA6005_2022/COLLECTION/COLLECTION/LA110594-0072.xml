   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ; AD WAR ESCALATES IN BATTLE OVER PROPOSITION 188</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To back Proposition 188 , the initiative to repeal California ' s smoking bans , the tobacco_industry abandoned a low-key campaign and is making heavy use of television ads . The switch in strategy was in response to an &quot; educational &quot; ad_campaign aimed at the measure funded by two wealthy health_care foundations . * THE &quot; NEUTRAL &quot; ADS : Designed by the nonprofit Public Media Center in San Francisco , the advertisements at first appear not to take sides . The 30-second spots open with a crowd shot . A narrator says : &quot; Californians have a lot of important decisions to make this November. &quot; The narrator then focuses_on Proposition 188 , and says : &quot; Do you know who the major contributors are_on each side ? &quot; A file_folder appears on the screen . On one side of the folder , Philip Morris tobacco company is listed as the main donor for Proposition 188 . On the other side , the American Cancer Society is named as the main donor against it . * THE ANALYSIS : The ads accurately reflect aspects of the campaign . Although outwardly neutral , the ads can also be seen to serve as an equalizer to the &quot; vote yes &quot; campaign . Opponents of Proposition 188 say that people will vote_down the initiative if they know the tobacco_industry backs it . Although those openly opposed to Proposition 188 have had little money to run ads , the Public Media Center campaign budgeted as much as $ 4 million . Since those ads began running , support for Proposition 188 has fallen sharply in public_opinion_polls . * THE ADS &quot; FOR &quot; : In an imitation of the Public Media Center campaign , the Proposition 188 supporters aired 30-second spots that open with a crowd shot . A narrator intones : &quot; We Californians have a lot of complicated decisions to make . that ' s why you deserve to know the facts about Proposition 188. &quot; A file_folder appears . Reasons appear on both sides of the file_folder to vote for the initiative . Among the claims are that it prohibits smoking in public places , doubles fines for selling tobacco to minors and bans cigarette vending_machines . * THE ANALYSIS : Although the pro-Proposition 188 ads appear to be factual , they include several false_statements . The initiative would not ban smoking in public places , but would repeal scores of local ordinances that prohibit smoking in restaurants . Proposition 188 also would block a statewide ban on smoking in restaurants and other workplaces from taking_effect in January . If Proposition 188 becomes law , business owners would set their own smoking policies , and restaurant owners could set_aside up_to 25 % of their space for ventilated smoking sections . Nor would the initiative ban cigarette vending_machines . Rather , it would repeal 150 local ordinances that restrict or ban cigarette machines . The Public Media Center has sued , claiming the ads are misleading and portray its nonprofit group as a supporter of Proposition 188 .</TEXT>
