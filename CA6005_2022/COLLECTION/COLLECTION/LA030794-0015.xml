   <TEXT> This time , fortunately , it was an easy call . A jury in Pensacola , Fla. , deliberated less than three hours Saturday before convicting Michael F . Griffin , 32 , of first-degree murder for the slaying of Dr. David Gunn . Gunn was shot three times in the back last year when he arrived for work_at a clinic to perform abortions . Police_officers testified that Griffin , an anti-abortion activist , confessed to the crime immediately after the shooting . Right after the verdict , a Florida circuit judge sentenced Griffin , a former chemical worker , to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years . Griffin ' s act was unconscionable . Yet the intimidation of patients and incidents of violence against clinic physicians and nurses continue ; many of these acts stop just short of murder . Indeed , following Griffin ' s conviction , the leader of Defensive Action , an anti-abortion group that does advocate violence against doctors who perform the procedure , said that the verdict did not change his position that killing those physicians is acceptable . Strong condemnations from President Clinton and Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , among others , have apparently not persuaded extremists that such violence is in no way protected by the First_Amendment ' s guarantees of freedom_of_speech and expression . The Supreme Court recently upheld use of federal anti-racketeering laws against individuals who conspire to incite violence at abortion clinics . But Congress needs to go_further and complete work_on a bill giving broad federal protection , ensuring freedom of access to clinic entrances .</TEXT>
