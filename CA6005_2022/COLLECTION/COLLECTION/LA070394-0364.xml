   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 ; A DEADLY TWIST TO FAMILIAR THEME ; VIOLENCE : IT HAS LONG BEEN A FACTOR AMONG FANS OF THE SPORT , BUT A MURDER ADDS A CHILLING DIMENSION TO THE PROBLEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The debate about soccer violence will no doubt begin anew . What the murder of Andres Escobar does is change the pitch of the discussion . Violence in the name of soccer has been turned inward , with fans killing themselves after losses . Soccer violence has been turned outward in the form of rampages and rioting . This is different . This is not about hooligans . Hooligans have little to do with the game of soccer and often care not if the team they are supporting has won or lost ; they care about smashing a beer_bottle over someone ' s head . A soccer match merely provides the venue . A line has been crossed . Some inviolable border had been breached when fans attack players and take_out their frustrations in a pound of flesh . What can drive people to harm themselves and others because a soccer team has lost a game ? It is an ineffable passion . The general secretary of FIFA observed Saturday that the game has two faces . Indeed , it does . One , that FIFA shows to the world and that is showcased in the World Cup . That face bears a joyous smile . Soccer has the facility to raise the life of a fan . It gives something to a person who has nothing . If my team wins , I win . I am elevated . This is the emotion behind the ecstasy of victory . The sometimes suffocating identification of fans with teams and players can produce euphoria , and it can also , increasingly , engender outrage and brutal lashing out . This is the other face , of soccer and sport . In some countries , soccer serves to fill the gaping chasm between the haves and the never-haves . Soccer , the people ' s sport , is accessible and identifiable and very much belongs_to the underclasses of these places . Because they have nothing else , the soccer victories carry more emotional weight , they affect fans in a way that cannot be comprehended by a person whose life includes the daily victory of a home and a job and available food . Three soccer fans died of &quot; shock &quot; in Nigeria after that country beat Angola in a World Cup qualifying match in 1989 . If a victory is imbued with such import , what can a loss mean ? To many Bolivian fans , their team ' s exit in the first round of this World Cup was affirmation that in the eyes of the world they are a small landlocked country that supplies the raw_material for the Colombian drug trade . Nothing more . What made a soccer fan in Tegucigalpa shoot himself in the head after Yugoslavia scored the winning goal that eliminated Honduras from the 1982 World Cup ? Why did a woman kill herself after Cameroon was knocked_out of the 1990 World Cup ? Why do fans jump_out of buildings and swallow pills and suffer so ? Nationalism plays a part . A country ' s writers and poets and scientists and artists and actors are available on the international scene , but they don ' t compete . They don ' t represent their nations when they achieve , they represent themselves . Only athletes are followed around by a flag , like so_much diplomatic baggage . It doesn ' t take long to accumulate an overflowing file filled with accounts of soccer violence . -- Police use tear_gas to disperse 200 fans who are rioting at the training site of the Italian club , AS Roma , after the team ' s sixth loss of the season . -- A fight between rival fans at a soccer match in Turkey leaves 10 dead and 200 injured . -- In Lima , Peru , fans riot over a disallowed goal during an Olympic qualifying match . In the aftermath , 320 people are dead , more_than 1 # 000 are injured and martial_law is declared for 30 days . -- In Nanchong , China , a riot breaks_out at a club match in protest over a referee ' s call . Home fans stone police and visiting players . Fans loot a hotel and the police_station . There are 135 injured . -- Fans rampage after West Germany defeats England in the semifinal of the 1990 World Cup . Fighting breaks_out in 29 cities in England . In Brighton , English youths chase German students and tourists . More_than 300 students are locked_in a nightclub by authorities for their safety . In London , German-made cars are damaged . In Turin , a 23-year-old German is stabbed in the back . All of which caused an Italian police_captain to say : &quot; I ' ve been in Milan for four years and I ' ve never seen such violence . I can understand political violence and demonstrations against specific causes , but we just can ' t understand this sort of senseless fighting. &quot;</TEXT>
