   <TEXT> * Gene Wojciechowski ' s article about Stacey Asbury ( Dec . 18 ) and the tragedy of anorexia went_a_long_way toward helping dispel some of the misunderstanding about this disease . Like many ailments , early detection increases the chances of successful treatment of anorexia.It ' s crucial that parents and friends know the warning signs , so they can intervene quickly . Anyone who consistently refuses food or denies that they are hungry is suspect . Other warning signs include abnormal weight loss , recurring complaints of nausea or bloating after eating normal amounts of food and excessive exercise . Physical symptoms include the appearance of fine , downy hair on the arms . Like Stacey , anorexics will often complain of being fat even though they are dangerously thin . Tom and Carlie Asbury obviously did everything they could for their daughter . However , early detection and team treatment -- including medical_care , psychotherapy , nutrition counseling and family therapy -- can cure many anorexics and spare their families the loss suffered by the Asburys .
