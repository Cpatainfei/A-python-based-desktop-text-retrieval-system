   <HEADLINE> EUROPE ; INVESTIGATOR RIPS INTO DESIGNERS AT HIGH POINT OF FASHION SEASON ; ITALY : THE MAGISTRATE SPEARHEADING THE PROBE OF A MASSIVE BRIBERY SCANDAL TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO WELL-KNOWN COUTURIERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Italy ' s most popular judge has come_into fashion : Investigating magistrate Antonio Di Pietro brings sartorial taste -- including one smashing sports jacket -- but an awful sense of timing , in the view of the country ' s famous designers . Di Pietro , vortex of debate on how to resolve a national corruption scandal without permanently scarring Italy ' s business_community , is the reason more_than hemlines are under scrutiny this weekend as clothes-watchers gather_in Milan for the inaugural of the fashion world ' s annual ready-to-wear shows . What women will be wearing next spring and summer is up_to them . But it is Di Pietro who will decide if some designers are showing prison stripes by then . As ever , cameras will be riveted on skirt lengths of models sashaying the catwalks during the Milan extravaganza lasting from today through Thursday ; Di Pietro ' s more interested in hoodwinks and bribes . &quot; He ' s very simpatico , elegant even , in his gray cashmere jacket , &quot; said Gianfranco Ferre after being questioned by the judge who has spearheaded an almost three-year crusade against bribery and corruption . The investigation has focused_on whether businesses richly and routinely paid_off politicians and government officials in exchange for public contracts . Other pillars of a multibillion-dollar industry who have been to see Di Pietro when they would rather have been making final tucks_in their creations include : Giorgio Armani ; Santo Versace , brother and head of Gianni Versace ' s fashion empire ; Krizia , and jeweler Gianmaria Buccellati . They have told similar stories -- of yielding to official corruption by paying bribes that amounted to extortion . Krizia , who shows her new_line Monday &quot; with a certain air of austerity , &quot; told the judge this week that she had paid $ 260 # 000 to tax inspectors under guise of a consultant ' s fee in 1990 . In exchange , inspectors did not find irregularities in company books , which she says were clean anyway . &quot; I had to pay . It was the only way to stay free_of the threat of being closed_down or paralyzed , &quot; Krizia , whose real name is Mariuccia Mandelli , told Italian reporters . Di Pietro , the most respected figure in Italian public life , is the father of an investigation into a scandal called Tangentopoli ( Bribesville ) that has implicated an ever-growing list of prominent officials and business_leaders -- more_than 3 # 000 so far , including former Cabinet_ministers and captains of industry . Popular disgust at the scandal triggered an electoral revolt that broke Establishment parties after nearly half a century in power and brought political rookie Silvio Berlusconi to the prime_minister ' s office . By now , it is clear that corruption reached_into every corner of the country and virtually every industry . Magistrates say they have evidence against crooked tax police in more_than 200 cases , and businessmen are also falling_in a steady stream : A textile manufacturer and a trader known as &quot; the rice king &quot; ran_afoul of Milan judges this week . &quot; In a little while they ' ll even be investigating the saints , &quot; a disgusted Gianni Versace told reporters in Berlin . Italy is paying a huge cost for the scandal -- from lost taxes to a justice system overwhelmed by corruption cases to unsigned contracts and stagnant construction among companies fearful that skeptical judges will later vet their every move . With 40 # 000 people jamming Milan this week for the shows , the fashion world ' s encounter with justice may_not have tangible impact . But on the nervous eve of a new season , it is at the least unsettling to high-fashion wizards whose genius generates both national prestige and billions in export earnings . Di Pietro has been arguing publicly that investigations must be brought_to a close . To speed an end , he suggests greater transparency in the letting of government contracts and American-style plea-bargaining and immunity for those who confess and testify . The proposal has found greater echo in public_opinion than in official circles , where there are complaints that as a magistrate Di Pietro has no business doing politicians ' work .</TEXT>
