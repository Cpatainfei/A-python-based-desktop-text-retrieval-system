   <TEXT> * Your editorial of Feb . 6 ( &quot; Recharging the Electric Idea &quot; ) overstated sentiment for the electric_car among Northeast states making_up the Ozone Transport Region . The vote was nine to four to petition EPA for a low-emission vehicle program similar to California ' s.The vote specifically excluded an electric_car mandate . Take the four states voting against the California program ( even without the electric_car mandate ) , add at least two others that demanded deletion of an electric_car mandate before voting yes , and you get a much clearer picture of where the Northeast stands on the practicality of an electric_car over the next decade . With respect_to the California LEV program , note , too , that only four states in the OTC region commissioned independent studies on the subject , and all four studies concluded there were better and less costly alternatives to the California program for those states . The EPA ought to give serious consideration to these studies as it weighs the OTC petition . The EPA may also consider an alternative car proposed by the auto_makers , one that seriously addresses air quality in the Northeast , but at far less cost to the consumer . Even without an electric_car requirement , a costly program designed for California to deal with its unique problem should not be forced on states on the other side of the country . J . D .
