   <HEADLINE> SUN CRUSADE SEEKS CROWD REFLECTING L.A. DIVERSITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time since the Rev . Billy Graham preached to hundreds of thousands in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 31 years ago , a major Christian crusade will open in the newly renovated landmark next weekend with an appeal for reconciliation among racial and ethnic_groups . While the Gospel message of salvation remains unchanged from when it was preached in the Coliseum in 1963 by Graham , Los Angeles ' ethnic and cultural identity has undergone a dramatic transformation . For that reason , the upcoming Christopher Sun Crusade is aimed at drawing crowds that reflect the ethnic diversity of Southern California . If it is as successful as hoped , backers say the rally could become the largest multiethnic Christian crusade ever held_in the United States . Sun , who has held crusades in Taiwan , Canada , Australia , Malaysia and Singapore , said he didn ' t know how many would attend the Los Angeles event . Graham ' s 1963 crusade drew 134 # 000 on its single biggest night , Sun said . Seating capacity at the remodeled Coliseum is 67 # 500 . Expected to cost $ 580 # 000 , the Sun crusade has attracted widespread curiosity with its banners and billboards in ethnic neighborhoods throughout the city . The Christopher Sun Evangelistic Assn . is based in Arcadia . &quot; We preach the Gospel here because we really have a burden for our city , &quot; Sun said , referring to the 1992 riots and a series of recent natural disasters . &quot; This time Christian brothers and sisters come_together to be reconciled . . . to transform this city to a city of reconciliation , a city_of_God , a city of peace , &quot; the evangelist told reporters this week . The crusade , to be held Sept . 16-18 beginning at 7:30 p.m. each night , will be conducted in English and simultaneously translated into Mandarin , Korean and Spanish . To ensure broad ethnic representation , Sun began meeting monthly with African American , Anglo , Chinese American , Latino and Korean American religious_leaders . He was invited to preach at their churches . &quot; This is the first_crusade of this magnitude planned by spiritual_leaders of such diverse , ethnic backgrounds . Its purpose is really to heal , &quot; said the Rev . Harold Helms , pastor of Angelus Temple in Los Angeles . &quot; Los Angeles is quite different today , &quot; Helms added . &quot; We may be the most cosmopolitan city in the world . Our racial and ethnic diversities can explode or serve as a model for the world. &quot; In response to a question , Minister Calvin Brown of the West Angelus Church of God in Christ said Sun ' s crusade differs markedly from the Promise Keepers crusade in May that drew 50 # 000 predominantly white_men to Anaheim Stadium . &quot; He has come_to the community , ate_in the community , driven the streets at night . He has felt the heartbeat of the city , &quot; said Brown , who is minister for evangelism at the predominantly African American congregation . While he said Promise Keepers was &quot; an excellent crusade to . . . the middle_class , the very wealthy , Caucasian Americans , &quot; Sun was reaching_out to all ethnic_groups . &quot; This is the difference . This is what the Body of Christ is like . There is no race barrier , &quot; said Brown . &quot; Until large crusades stop becoming exclusive and begin to reach_out the way Dr. Sun has , &quot; Brown said , &quot; then we will always be divided. &quot; Promise Keepers is a men ' s ministry . Its founder , University of Colorado head football_coach Bill McCartney , has repeatedly called_for stepped-up efforts by Promise Keepers to break_down racial barriers . Sun and his wife , Shirley , said they were warmly greeted when they began calling_on various ethnic_groups in preparation for the Coliseum event . But he said they were surprised to learn how little dialogue exists between ethnic_groups . &quot; It ' s hard to imagine that it ' s even harder to preach in L.A. than foreign countries , &quot; said Sun . Shirley Sun noted that the population of Los Angeles County exceeds that of some foreign countries . Within that figure are ethnic_groups with large_numbers , she said . &quot; Los Angeles today belongs_to all ethnic_groups , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s no longer a one-race community. &quot; Sun , 41 , who grew_up in the Lutheran_church but now describes himself as interdenominational , began thinking_about holding his first U.S. crusade in 1988 . In 1992 , after a smaller evangelistic meeting in Anaheim that drew 7 # 000 people on each of two nights , he began planning for next weekend ' s Los Angeles event . Sun , a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Taiwan , said he made a commitment to become an evangelist after attending a Billy Graham crusade in Taipei in 1975 . Before entering the ministry , Sun was a licensed California architect . He received his bachelor ' s and master ' s degrees in architecture from UC Berkeley , a master ' s in theology from Fuller Theological Seminary in 1984 , and a doctorate from the California Graduate_School of Theology in 1987 . The crusade has been endorsed by pastors of a variety of churches within the African American , Latino , Chinese American , Korean American and Anglo communities . Among them are Campus Crusade for Christ President Bill Bright , who is honorary chairman . Others include the Rev . Lloyd Ogilvie of First Presbyterian_Church of Hollywood , Pastor Jack Hayford of the Church on the Way in Van Nuys , the Rev . Cecil Murray of First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles , Bishop Charles E . Blake of the Church of God in Christ , Dr. Emory C . Campbell , executive minister of the Los Angeles Baptist City Mission Society ( American Baptist ) . Pastor Hee M . Park of Young Nak Presbyterian_Church of Los Angeles , the Rev . Joel Torres , superintendent of the Pacific Latin_American District of Assemblies of God ; Dr. John E . Whan Kim of Los Angeles Christian Reformed Church and president of the International Theological Seminary ; and the Rev . Andrew Kwok of the Chinese Life Lutheran_Church .</TEXT>
