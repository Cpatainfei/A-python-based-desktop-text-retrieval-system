   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON EDUCATION ; SEX AND SIN : THERE IS A DIFFERENCE ; ABSTINENCE IS HARDLY THE HEIGHT OF MORAL BEHAVIOR ; OUR KIDS NEED GUIDANCE FOR REAL SITUATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Vista school_board in northern San Diego County has adopted a new curriculum on sexual values , called Sex Respect , which teaches abstinence and restricts information about birth_control , masturbation , abortion and sexually transmitted disease . It will be implemented this summer in Grade 7 , and the board will vote April 21 on whether to extend it through Grade 11 . To their credit , those who advocate this proposed sex-education curriculum believe that human sexuality is a serious issue for educators . The problem is , Sex Respect does not address the many consequences and responsibilities that come_with an active sex life and so leaves our youth woefully uninformed . The theme of the new curriculum is that men and women should remain chaste before they marry , that sexual_relations in any other context are immoral . As a rabbi and teacher who has worked with countless young people , I feel qualified to offer a different view : Premarital sex between consenting individuals is not immoral ; premarital sex is unholy . The difference between the two is significant . I do not want people who engage in premarital sex to think that they are committing a grave sin . The Hebrew Bible is virtually silent on this issue , but it certainly does not label premarital sex a sin . You will not find explicit reference_to relations between unmarried individuals who engage in sex among the prohibitions of the Bible . Sexuality becomes a moral issue when trickery or deceit is employed . Incest , rape and acquaintance rape are indeed sinful . I recoil when a person is described as &quot; moral &quot; because of their chastity . A far more significant question would ask if that person cheats_on income_taxes or gossips maliciously or acts in other ways with total disregard for fellow human_beings . At our most basic level , we humans are animals ; we have animal impulses and drives . We communicate , we eat , we relieve ourselves , we tire , we sleep -- and we have_sex . Ultimately , what makes us human is our ability to transcend our animal composition . What makes us human is our ability to channel and curb our God-given impulses in such a way that elevates the human spirit . Sexuality is one in a series of healthy life forces . When we eat with dignity , when we communicate to each other with respect , when we acknowledge the normal healthy function of our bodies , our animalistic foundation transforms itself and becomes human . From a religious perspective , sex becomes holy exclusively in the context of marriage . That is something radically different than labeling it immoral when it is performed out of wedlock . Abstinence until marriage is an ideal and the basic approach to sexuality that I would advocate as a rabbi . It is not only by far the best form of birth_control , it elevates sexuality and makes_it sacred . But honestly , do we provide a service to the generation growing_up in the 1990s when we withhold from them explanation about other forms of birth_control or open discussion of masturbation , abortion and sexually transmitted diseases ? What is the motivating force behind the advocates of Sex Respect ? I am curious to know if the issue is age or the sexual act itself rendered outside the context of marriage . I think we can agree that 13-year-olds who engage in sexual intimacy leave us both pained and bewildered . But are we faced by the same dilemma when 21-year-olds have a premarital affair ? If we say the issue is age , the inference is that not all premarital sexual encounters are equally wrong . Once we agree to the possibility that some premarital activity is not &quot; sinful , &quot; the issue becomes one of moderation and balance . We render a terrible disservice to our children by withholding vital information on sexuality from them . Concerned adults must push for a curriculum that teaches and empowers adolescent boys and girls , in an age-appropriate way , so they may choose a sex ethic wisely . Everything in life comes_with trade-offs . By not teaching our children all they need to know about sexuality , in the controlled environment of the classroom , they will learn about sex for themselves in an environment that may be less than ideal , at a time in history when the stakes are great . Be it through television and movies or magazines , or through uneducated , unprepared encounters on_their_own , our youth will happen_upon expressions of human sexuality . Therein lies the deficiency of the Sex Respect curriculum . It is inevitable that from the onset of puberty , human_beings will discover their own sexuality . So , while we still play an important role in the development of our children , why not teach them about sex in an open , sensitive way ? Given the gravity of the_matter , to do otherwise is both immoral and sinful .</TEXT>
