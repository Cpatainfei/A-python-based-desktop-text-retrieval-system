   <HEADLINE> ' DEATH ROW ' DOG PARDONED , ENDING YEARS OF LEGAL BATTLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Christine Todd Whitman on Friday pardoned New Jersey ' s &quot; Death Row &quot; dog , whose ordeal had sparked appeals for clemency from around the world . Whitman ' s action ended more_than three years of legal wrangling over the fate of Taro , a 5-year-old Akita that has been held_in a special kennel at the Bergen County jail . &quot; This has gone_on long enough , &quot; Whitman told reporters , noting that the case had consumed more_than $ 100 # 000 in legal_fees . A judge ordered the dog destroyed after ruling that it had attacked a girl who was visiting the Haworth , N.J. , home of Lonnie and Sandy Lehrer on Christmas_Day , 1990 . Taro was committed to the county jail on Feb . 11 , 1991 . Whitman faced an unusual legal dilemma since her power to grant clemency applies to people , and not pets . But she said she had found a way_out through a law on property forfeiture . Since pets are property , the executive order says , and the governor has the power to remit forfeitures , she will exercise that power to spare Taro and return the dog to her owners . The dog must be moved within 30 days , and the owners must accept any liability . Taro ' s saga became an international cause_celebre , with dog lovers from around the world offering to take the 100-pound Akita . The Japanese government even expressed interest , since Taro ' s breed is native to that land . Brigitte Bardot , the actress turned animal rights activist , had telegrammed Whitman ' s predecessor , James J . Florio , last year in support of the dog . Florio refused to get involved in the case . Taro was to have been killed under a law that orders dangerous dogs to be destroyed . But the author of that law said he meant it for pit bulls and other dogs bred to be aggressive . The state Legislature is considering revisions to the law to prevent similar disputes .</TEXT>
