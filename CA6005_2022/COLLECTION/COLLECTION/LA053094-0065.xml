   <HEADLINE> CHINESE SCRATCH A GROWING ITCH TO TRAVEL ; TOURISM : WITH ITS INCREASING WEALTH , CHINA SENT 17 % MORE VISITORS TO THE U.S. IN 1993 THAN THE YEAR BEFORE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At home_in Shanghai , Yu Jing used to daydream over pictures taken by her husband on business trips to the United States , imagining herself on a sandy beach in Southern California , strolling through Hollywood or visiting other famous U.S. tourist spots . Yu , a 29-year-old housewife , got her wish recently when she and her 2-year-old daughter accompanied her husband -- who is teaching under an exchange program at the University of Arkansas -- to an academic conference in Anaheim . After her husband ' s business meetings , the family visited Disneyland , Hollywood , the beaches and other Southern California attractions before heading north to San Francisco . &quot; A lot of Chinese want to come_to America , &quot; Yu said . &quot; Their impression of America is very good. &quot; Chinese tourists still make_up only a small number of the millions of foreigners who visit the United States each year , but their numbers are growing rapidly , thanks largely to China ' s increasing prosperity . The number of Chinese visitors rose 17 % to about 293 # 000 last year from about 250 # 000 the year before , according to U.S._government statistics . In 1990 , fewer than 200 # 000 Chinese visited the United States . Although most Chinese visit this country primarily for business or education , they are also taking the opportunity to see the sights . More Chinese would visit purely for pleasure , according to some travel_agents , if U.S. officials would grant more visas . Meanwhile , they say , Chinese have the itch to travel and are increasingly visiting nearby countries such_as Thailand , Malaysia and Singapore . U.S. cities may be missing out on a potentially lucrative new source of tourists , these agents say . &quot; There have been a tremendous number of requests to come here , &quot; Gloria Lan , a travel_agent at Los Angeles-based Jetours , said recently during a seminar at the Anaheim Visitors and Convention Bureau that focused_on tourism from China . However , Lan said , most of the Chinese who have contacted her have been unable to get visas . &quot; There are a lot of obstacles , &quot; she said . The State_Department does not discriminate in granting visas on the basis of nationality , a department spokesman said . But U.S. officials in various countries have the discretion to deny visas based on suspicions that applicants might attempt to stay in the United States illegally , said Gary Scheaffer , press officer of the Bureau of Consul Affairs at the State_Department . The problem for Chinese applicants , Scheaffer said , is the recent increase in illegal immigrants from China . U.S. consuls in China have been especially cautious since the discovery last year that many illegal immigrants were being smuggled into the United States on ships from some of China ' s impoverished coastal provinces . &quot; What you are trying to do is to judge intention , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s a pretty strong indication that there are those with a serious pull to immigrate to the United States. &quot; One reason for the recent increase in illegal immigration is that China ' s new prosperity is spotty , leaving_out large areas of the country , including the poor southern province of Fuzhou . The economic boom is most dramatic in the coastal cities of Shanghai , Shenzhen and Guangzhou , where per-capita income has risen dramatically in recent years to over $ 1 # 000 , according to Chinese statistics . Prosperity has given some residents of those areas the means to travel and government economic reforms have opened the door by encouraging more Chinese to travel abroad for business . Los Angeles and San Francisco are the ports_of_entry for 64 % of Chinese visiting the the United States , according to a 1992 survey by the California Division of Tourism . &quot; Hollywood is famous , &quot; Yu said . &quot; Young people ( in China ) like American films and they are familiar_with American stars. &quot; Chinese visitors also find Los Angeles ' variety of retail_stores and amusement_parks appealing , travel_agents say . According to a survey , 70 % of Chinese visitors said shopping was a major activity for them during their stay in California . Chinese visitors tend to save_up for a trip abroad , Lan said , and often spend heavily , especially on clothes and electronic goods , because they are either cheaper in the United States or unavailable in China . &quot; A lot of things are cheaper here , &quot; Lan said . &quot; You have such a large market , with products coming_in from Japan and other countries . So you have more variety . . . . Southern California is very attractive to Chinese , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s why they choose this place ( for business ) . &quot; Yu said Chinese visitors seem not to be deterred by California ' s high crime_rate or other problems that have contributed to a decline in Japanese tourists coming_to California . &quot; They consider the crime and the danger , &quot; she said , &quot; and they just try to avoid it. &quot; On the Go Chinese citizens account_for a small percentage of the millions of foreign visitors to the United States each year , but their number has grown more_than 50 % since 1990 .
