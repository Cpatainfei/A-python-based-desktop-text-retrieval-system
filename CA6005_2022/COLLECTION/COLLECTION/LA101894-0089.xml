   <HEADLINE> VALLEY INTERVIEW ; MISSION COLLEGE CLOSER TO ITS NICHE AT 20TH BIRTHDAY , LEADER SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With its 20th anniversary approaching in February , Mission College in Sylmar has come a long way from its humble beginnings in a collection San Fernando storefronts in 1975 . The campus , the youngest in the nine-campus Los Angeles Community_College District , moved to its permanent 22.5-acre campus site in the fall of 1991 . But with only a handful of permanent buildings and a site one-quarter of the size considered normal , it still has a long way to go toward becoming a full-fledged community_college . President Jack Fujimoto , 65 , who began as a city schools_teacher in 1959 , arrived in 1989 to help spearhead the transition . Prospects for rapid_growth and expansion dimmed when the college ' s enrollment , at its peak more_than 7 # 400 students in 1992 , fell to fewer than 6 # 000 this fall , reflecting both statewide enrollment declines and the impact of the Northridge earthquake in January . Fujimoto , who said he hopes to stay_at the campus several more years , talked_of how he has tried the steer the college into a closer relationship with the surrounding East Valley community . * Question : Give us an assessment of Mission College as it reaches its 20 - year anniversary . Answer : Mission College has always been , at least in my mind , a free_spirit where people try things . People do things , and even if you fail , nobody criticizes you for failing . But what ' s happening is we ' re finding consolidation of facilities and people to the new campus , and that ' s really a traumatic experience . It ' s like bringing the family together and the facilities are too small for the big family . So now , three years later , people are saying , &quot; 20th anniversary. &quot; But we ' re sort of locked_in . Q : Does Mission have a different role from your sister colleges in being more outwardly directed to community involvement ? A : Yes . I ' m taking it that way purposely , because my concept of a community_college is it ' s a college in a community , and we need to help the community develop . I see some of that from President Mary Lee at Pierce College . But I don ' t see as much as we try to do . We ' re in economic development activities , social development and community activities . Q : Describe a_couple_of things the college is doing_in those areas . A : If we look_at earthquake recovery , one of the first things that hit us was we lost about 1 # 000 students right off . But at_the_same_time we were out_in the community , counseling small business and community folks and helping them get loans from FEMA and SBA . Another activity is what we call the Blythe Street project . What in_essence happened in Blythe Street is Mission College opened a kitchen . We train immigrant vendors on the standards of good_health and nutrition for them to sell their wares . In a community where we have gangs and poverty as problems , and immigrants as an issue , we ' ve gone_in and we ' ve helped a population . Q : What are some of Mission College ' s main weaknesses at the moment ? A : I think one of the weaknesses has to be not being able to meet the needs of the people in the community as they ' ve expressed them . For instance , the Sylmar residents ' group has complained so_much about on-street parking , and students don ' t park in the parking_lots here because there aren ' t enough parking_spaces . Facilities are another problem . We don ' t have large classrooms . We don ' t have large offices . Q : Is the content of the programs you offer here different from what you ' re going to find at the other district campuses ? A : I think we ' re much more non-traditional , meaning that because we don ' t have a lot of faculty , many of them are going_to teach day , evening , split programs , four-day weeks , Saturdays . And our classrooms are going at least six days a week . I don ' t find that in the other colleges as much . Also , we ' re still a relatively young college . We borrow from the other colleges in terms of the courses and programs . What Mission College needs to do is find its own niche where it is going_to do_well . Yet at_the_same_time , we don ' t want to fall_into the niche that says , &quot; You ' re a remedial school. &quot; And we don ' t want to be known as a Hispanic college only , either . Q : Let ' s talk_about students . When students come_to Mission , do they differ from those going_to the other campuses in the district ? A : Those who go_to Valley and Pierce colleges I think are much more the traditional college-bound student . The college-going rate of students around Mission College is much smaller . Many of the students who come here are the first ones in the family . And the family is mostly saying , &quot; We have an economic struggle and you need to help us. &quot; Q : Traditionally , community_colleges have several goals for their students : transfers to four-year institutions , vocational_education , and basic skills such_as remedial programs . How does Mission fit into those categories ? A : I don ' t think Mission College has done_well in terms of transfer . We ' ve made significant progress in the time I ' ve been here . But the numbers are very small . In terms of vocational certificates , we give a lot of certificates . But what we need to do is track those individuals to say , &quot; What ' s that particular certificate done for you ? &quot; Q : What are students typically looking_to accomplish when they are done at Mission College ? A : They want to transfer to the Cal State or University of California systems . They want that , but their expectations are a little higher than what their abilities are . So therefore they become tailored very quickly to a vocational goal . About 60 % come_in hoping to transfer , but it becomes about 60 % certificate- or vocational-oriented . Q : Why is there that divergence in the expectations of your students and their abilities ? A : Basically society ' s values . I think as a parent I want my kid to go_into something that ' s going_to produce some bucks for them , or at least a comfortable living . But the student may_not have the same abilities , because whatever he learned up_to this point isn ' t going_to get him there . Q : Mission is third in the district in terms of its Latino student proportion . For incoming students , is the language issue something you have to deal with and how ? A : Many will be very strong in Spanish , and so in the initial contact , we have to have people who speak Spanish give them some guidance . But as time goes_on , I think that pretty much starts to fall by the wayside because many of them pick_up English-language skills very readily . Q : There were some developments in the state budget this year as far as Mission ' s plans for the future . Can you summarize what happened ? A : We were able to get_about $ 4.5 million in the governor ' s budget to start negotiating with the county for another 40 acres to expand into the adjoining golf_course or El Cariso Regional Park . In the coming year , I see an educational master_plan coming , an environmental impact report and a facilities master_plan . And we can use those as a backdrop for the 20th anniversary . Q : Do you have other plans for the future ? A : Mission College has roughly about 150 foreign students now . I ' d want to expand that into about 500 foreign students to make us much more cosmopolitan . One of the things we don ' t have is apartments . But if we start developing some kind of dormitory system or agreements with apartment owners , then that opens it up . Q : Financially , you have a reputation as someone who goes_out and tries to develop outside grant funding . Is Mission different from the other campuses in that regard and why ? A : Survival . Because we need the external funds . Budgets are based on full-time equivalent students . But the students who come here don ' t take a lot of courses . They ' re not the type that can manage 21 units or 24 units at a crack . So the number of full-time students is not that great . The only way we can keep_on top of things is by going_out and saying , &quot; We ' re the little kid on the block , we ' re just growing_up , we need a lot of money. &quot;</TEXT>
