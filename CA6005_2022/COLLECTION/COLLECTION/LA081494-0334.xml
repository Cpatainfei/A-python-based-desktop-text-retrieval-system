   <HEADLINE> POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES : THE SECOND-BIGGEST SEASON ; EXHIBITION_GAMES GET FOOTBALL FANS ' ATTENTION ; NFL NEEDS ONE IMPROVEMENT : BETTER PLAY-CALLING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Again it ' s late summer in America , and to sports fans , that means , among other things , the reappearance of pro football . This is the NFL ' s 75th anniversary season . And as the fun begins , here are three of the year ' s most frequently asked questions : -- Why do so many Americans spend so many summer days and evenings viewing exhibition football -- a fall sport ? -- Why do pro football_players spend so_much of their summer in training camps ? -- Who should call NFL plays -- coaches or quarterbacks ? Some answers : * Football fans like exhibition_games . There is more public support for the NFL exhibition_season than many people realize . To American spectators , according to TV ratings , it is the second-most popular of all sports seasons -- behind only the NFL regular season . * Pro football ' s training camps are indispensable . They are often wrongly compared to baseball ' s spring_training -- which is in part a publicity gimmick . Football is an arduous , intricate team sport whose appeal would diminish without a lengthy series of hard days at training camp . * Quarterbacks call better plays than coaches . In a more perfect world , the NFL ' s training camps and the exhibition schedule would be used to give quarterbacks leadership experience . The needless sameness of pro games , often criticized , stems mainly from the league ' s many conservative coaches , who keep sending_in similar , safe , conventional plays . Most pro clubs would improve noticeably with quarterback-called plays , leading to improvements in the quality of their sport . In particular , the Raiders would have been a Super Bowl team last season with better game-day decisions . They can win it this season if they let quarterback Jeff Hostetler call the plays . That should be their top priority . THE FINAL SCORE : LEAST IMPORTANT EXHIBITION STAT To measure public interest in the various U.S. sports , one significant barometer is the number of TV viewers . The most recent Nielsen findings : For every 2 million Americans who watch NFL regular-season games , there are 1 # 150 , 000 viewers for NFL exhibitions , 742 # 000 for NBA regular-season games , and 530 # 000 for baseball ' s regular-season games . The latest full-schedule national rating averages : NFL regular season , 13.2 ; NFL exhibition_season , 7.6 ; NBA regular season , 4.9 ; major_league baseball regular season , 3.5. On ABC in recent weeks , the average American TV rating for the 11-game , once-in-a-lifetime World Cup tournament in the U.S. was 5.3. Exhibition football seems out_of_place in that company , some would say . What ' s there to like about an exhibition ? Not the result , obviously . The least-important exhibition-game statistic is the final score , and largely for that reason sports fans prefer regular-season games . In most NFL cities , indeed , the distribution of exhibition tickets is tied to regular-season ticket sales . For TV spectators , however , there are no tie-ins . It ' s a fact that nobody forces Americans to turn_to televised exhibition football . Yet thousands do . Here are some of the reasons why : First , there are more fans for football than other sports . Second , in a typical exhibition-game first_half , the teams tend to match their best players in what becomes something of a test of comparative strengths . Football fans view it as a mini-preview of the fall season . Third , during the exhibition schedule , they also compare new and old players . Football fans enjoy keeping_up , forecasting the future , nudging the coach . And , fourth , the better TV commentators -- John Madden , Pat Haden , Bob Trumpy -- are usually informative . And for football fans , that ' s enough . ARE YOU ( PHYSICALLY ) READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL ? As for the training-camp season , the excitement has always appealed_to many of the hangers-on . For the better part of half a century , it has seemed that the three best days of the year are Christmas , the first day of vacation , and the first day at training camp . To football_players , however , the camp season is something else . To many , it can be a grind . The Rams , who have been training in California for 49 years , once brought_in 150 candidates and ran them around in the oppressive Redlands heat until several passed_out and dropped . Said former Ram coach Sid Gillman , &quot; that ' s how they used to cut the squad. &quot; Training camp in those days was for running players into condition . These days , most veterans , insuring their $ 700 # 000 salaries , work_out year-around . And with as_many as 80 candidates at any training camp , modern coaches prey on the players ' minds , mainly , not their muscles . The Raiders , for instance , on their first day at camp last month on the grounds of Oxnard ' s Radisson Suite Hotel , seemed physically ready for a game . But they would n ' t have played well . Theirs is a sport with hundreds of different offensive and defensive procedures -- each involving precise teamwork -- that must be learned , practiced , and mastered . That takes time . So their summers are still crowded with all-day and all-evening meetings and practices . And although they still don ' t like it much , they would n ' t be a team in September without the grind of July and August . Camp_followers don ' t always understand the extent of the problem . For example , hotel man Barron Hilton was unfamiliar_with most training camp routines in 1960 , when he founded the Los Angeles -- now San Diego -- Chargers . Hilton , a former prep receiver , had made a fast start in pro ball by hiring the most distinguished coaches of his day , with Gillman in_charge assisted by Al Davis , Al LoCasale , Jack Faulkner , Joe Madro and Chuck Noll . Today , three of the six , Gillman , Davis and Noll , are in the Hall_of_Fame . But at the Chargers ' first training camp , when a photographer wanted Hilton to pose with his four best receivers , he readily agreed -- and asked LoCasale to pick them out . &quot; I ' m afraid I can ' t do that , &quot; said LoCasale , who is now No . 2 to the No . 1 Raider , Davis . &quot; We ' ve got 12 prospects at those positions , and I never saw any of them before. &quot; Said Hilton , &quot; Don ' t worry about it , Al . Just pick_out the four who are going_to make the team. &quot; Those were difficult days -- for others , too . Absent were two modern training-camp landmarks , the camera tower and a helmet pump . Forty years ago , NFL coaches waited a week for practice-field movies . Today ' s videotapes are instantly ready for viewing . Forty years ago , nobody ' s helmet fit . that ' s one reason football_players look so funny in the old pictures . Today , the players , using an air_pump , carefully shape their expensive helmets to their heads vary considerably in size . &quot; The players are different , too , &quot; said Raider equipment manager Richard Romanski , whose opening day this summer was his 32nd . &quot; Give me the old-timers . These millionaires are tough to handle. &quot; But they work just as hard . WHY RUN ONE MAN INTO EIGHT DEFENSIVE LINEMEN ? NFL executives are missing another chance this summer to school their passers as play-callers in training-camp scrimmages and exhibition_games . Instead , fretting about noisy stadiums , they have wired their quarterbacks with helmet radios to make_it easier for coaches to call the plays . That is a major NFL mistake . Coaches have too_much control already . Too often on game day , all around the league , their first thought is for survival -- and , too often , that leads coaches to send_in safe , unimaginative , unexciting plays that they can plausibly explain . An off-tackle run that fails can be blamed on the blockers , or , in Los Angeles , on the ballcarrier . The single most misunderstood aspect of today ' s high-tech football is the value of judicious play-calling . We ' re talking_about a lost art . In a notorious recent example , Raider coaches , with the better players , were taken_out of the playoffs last winter by the plays they called_at Buffalo , where they opposed a team they should have eliminated -- a team they led at the half . For 30 minutes , the Raiders had run the ball with some success , after which TV_announcer O.J. Simpson asked both teams about their second-half strategy . Said the Raiders , &quot; We ' re going to come_out running. &quot; Said the Bills , &quot; We ' re going into a four-four front to stuff their run. &quot; And with millions of sports fans apprised of their intentions , both teams did just as they had said . The Raiders kept running and punting to the Bills until they blew the game . But it needn ' t have happened . With a player as their play-caller , the Raiders , in the critical moments that day , would surely have thrown more often . For players are aware of sudden shifts from three-four to four-four fronts . They become immediately aware of any front that leaves only three opponents in the pass defense . And Hostetler is more_than just another player . A Super Bowl winner as recently as 1991 , he is by far the best quarterback the Raiders have had since Jim Plunkett , who called the plays the last two times they were in the Super Bowl -- where they won games XV and XVIII . What a good signal_caller understands -- what Hostetler should be working_on this summer in training camp and exhibition_games -- is the gospel according to John Unitas , the Hall_of_Fame quarterback who said , &quot; Take what the defense gives you. &quot; Although that hasn ' t been a favorite Raider way , it ' s the way most Super Bowls are won . It can mean passing when the opponents brace for a run . It can mean running if they ' re lining_up in a pass defense . And any good quarterback can be taught to call plays that way . In fact , it is his natural tendency . Quarterbacks know how easy it is to complete a pass_on first down . They know how hard they ' re hit when asked to stand_in the pocket on third and long . Give a quarterback his head , he ' ll move you down the field the easiest way . All of the above is crucial to this year ' s Raiders , whose chief_executive , Davis , has signed -- for the second year in a row -- Super Bowl talent in most positions . Moreover , the Raider coaches , Art Shell and his assistants , are experienced , proficient leaders . They just shouldn ' t be calling the plays . They do deserve prior knowledge of what their quarterback is up_to . The radios should be in their hats .</TEXT>
