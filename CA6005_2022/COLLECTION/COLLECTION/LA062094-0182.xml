   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; BALBOA IS LEADING MAN FOR U.S. ; GROUP_A : DEFENDER TAKES_CHARGE ON THE BACK LINE , DELIGHTING THE COACHING STAFF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The transformation of Marcelo Balboa was not physical and it was not mental . It was verbal . In the U.S. team ' s opening World Cup game Saturday , the emphasis changed , from offensive strength to defensive prowess . Balboa ' s role in the game in the Silverdome at Pontiac , Mich. , was cited as key to salvaging a 1-1 tie with Switzerland . Balboa ' s contribution ? He spoke . For the first time , he assumed the leadership role the U.S. coaching staff has for so_long been coaxing the veteran of the 1990 World Cup to grab . Few U.S. players have been willing to act_as the vital communications center at the back of the formation , to be the player who directs the movement and tactical alignment of the team . Balboa did all_of that Saturday . &quot; Marcelo really lifted his game , &quot; U.S. assistant coach Steve Sampson said Sunday . &quot; Something I haven ' t seen from Marcelo in a long , long_time -- he was very vocal . Every coach on this team has talked to him about that aspect of the game . It ' s important that he organize the defense . He demonstrated leadership . Maybe it was the event . Thank God , it was desperately needed. &quot; Balboa didn ' t make an issue of his new voice in postgame interviews , but those who have followed the team immediately spotted -- and heard -- the change . &quot; It ' s something I ' ve had a hard_time doing , &quot; Balboa said . &quot; ( Saturday ) , it was a thing I had to do . I had to yell more . It was difficult to do because there were so many people in the stadium . But we needed to communicate. &quot; While the contact and communication between the U.S. defense and midfield was good , the space between the midfield and the two forward players was lost against Switzerland . Midfielders were able to help_out by dropping_back on defense , but , as the game played_out in 106-degree heat , midfielders were reluctant to join the attack . &quot; As the game wore_on , everyone got tired , &quot; Balboa said . &quot; We weren ' t able to push_up . We dropped_back a little too far . Defensively , it worked well for us , but offensively we weren ' t able to go forward. &quot; Balboa ' s performance was all_the more impressive in light of the general ambivalence of U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic regarding Balboa and where , if anywhere , he might play . It began with Balboa ' s absence because of a knee injury and , after his return , Milutinovic ' s vagueness about whether he planned to employ a sweeper -- Balboa ' s longtime position -- or abandon the position in favor of a four-back defense . Milutinovic chose to compromise , using a four-back system in which Balboa does some sweeping chores . &quot; There was some uncertainty , &quot; Sampson said of Balboa ' s place . &quot; Everyone was aware of it , even Marcelo. &quot; For the most part , the defense played well against Switzerland . Alexi Lalas was particularly effective against Swiss striker Stephane Chapuisat , a world-class player whom Lalas rendered a non-factor . Chapuisat ' s teammate Alain Sutter was roaming the midfield dangerously , but he drew one and at times two defenders . His presence created space that -- had Chapuisat been unmarked -- the striker might have exploited . The U.S. team returned to its sequestered hotel in Dana Point late Saturday night and the non-starting players practiced Sunday . Midfielder Claudio Reyna , who did not play Saturday because of a strained hamstring , practiced Sunday , but he still has pain when he strikes the ball and is listed as probable to play against Colombia on Wednesday at the Rose Bowl . Eric Wynalda , who scored the U.S. goal Saturday , did not practice and is still recovering from an allergic_reaction that caused him to break_out in hives . Team officials say the condition is expected to clear_up in a_few days .</TEXT>
