   <HEADLINE> WHOSE SEX_DRIVE NEEDS FIXING ? ; MEDICINE : HEALTHY WOMEN ARE BEING HORMONALLY ' CURED. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Medical researchers are busy playing catch-up . Studies are being designed and rethought to include the impact of various drugs , lifestyle changes and environmental factors on women ' s health , to balance the data available exclusively about men ' s health . This process is fraught with obstacles to clear thinking presented by the way researchers , both male and female , have been socialized . One example of this is the search for medicines that will boost women ' s sex_drives . A news release from a major medical_school and research_center came_across my desk recently announcing &quot; relief for menopausal women. &quot; It went_on to say that &quot; menopausal women suffering from reduced sexual_desire may find relief from an alternative type of hormone-replacement therapy. &quot; The words suffering and relief in this context bothered me . The release further claimed that &quot; women who took estrogen plus androgens reported improvement in libido and sexual satisfaction as early as three weeks after treatment began . . . . Their husbands reported the same thing. &quot; It made me wonder precisely who was being studied . This perspective might not be so troubling were it not so pervasive . Not long ago , a male colleague sought my opinion about a patient who had come_to see him because of her &quot; decreased sexual drive. &quot; The patient was a woman in her mid-30s who , after having been married for 10 years , had a child , and then a year later , a second child . She had returned to work soon after the birth of each child and , at the time she saw my colleague , was working full-time and mothering 1- and 2-year-old daughters . She reported being exhausted most of the time . This patient ' s husband was distressed because his wife seemed uninterested in sex , hence her visit to the doctor . After presenting this social history , my colleague went_through the unremarkable findings of the physical exam and the negative results of several lab tests . What , he wondered , did I make of this case ? I told him that his diagnosis was almost certainly in the first couple of sentences of the presentation and that his patient , happily , was a healthy , albeit overburdened , woman . Similarly stymied was a friend of mine , an extremely bright , socially competent and insightful woman , whose 15-year marriage had been in bad shape for some time . From many conversations , I gathered that her husband had particular and frequent sexual needs , but not the essentials of tenderness and respect . Over the years , she had undertaken couples counseling , read everything she could and repeatedly tried different ways of understanding her predicament . Despite all this , she called me one day and asked what she could take_to &quot; improve &quot; her sexual_desire . I told her I didn ' t think she needed improving . In my practice , this pursuit by patients -- to medically understand and alter the woman ' s sexual_desire -- is not uncommon . I have yet to hear , however , of a male patient seeking to deamplify his libido to meet his partner ' s needs . As a society , we hold very tightly to the notion that the male sex_drive is a given and that any adapting must be done_by women . How many men fake orgasms ? The curious aspect of this is that rarely do women ' s sexual impulses result in victimization . Women don ' t rape men , mothers don ' t sexually molest their sons , women teachers and ministers don ' t accost those in their trust . When we elect our first woman to the presidency , it ' s not likely that a series of men will emerge from the woodwork to accuse her of sexual_harassment . The damage resulting from sexually aggressive women is sparse ; that from male sexual aggression is legion . Still , we look_to perk_up the female ' s sex_drive to meet the male ' s . Though the ethics may_not have been fully examined , we long ago headed down the road to medically manipulating behavior . Drugs like Prozac can chemically influence people ' s psychodynamics , changing their lives and relationships . Soon it may be possible to modify much of what we don ' t like about human behavior . Libido , in women , is the target of hormonal manipulation . Aside from not knowing the long-term health consequences of this hormone exposure , it may be that we ' re treating the wrong people . This possibility needs to be contemplated with caution , thoughtfulness and an eye to the biases that underlie our assumptions .</TEXT>
