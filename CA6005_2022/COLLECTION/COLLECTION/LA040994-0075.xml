   <HEADLINE> NIRVANA FANS DESPAIR AT SINGER ' S DEATH ; REACTION : A SENSE OF DEJA VU HITS FOLLOWERS OF INFLUENTIAL BAND AS KURT COBAIN JOINS LIST OF FALLEN ROCKERS WHOSE EARLY DEMISE SEEMED FORETOLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Familiar_with the details of his troubled life , but appalled at the way he died , fans of Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain were shocked Friday . But they were not surprised . &quot; I saw it coming -- from the beginning , &quot; said Aaron Smith , a 21-year-old employee at the Tower Records store on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood . Smith , from Seattle like Cobain , remembered seeing him after a concert two years ago . &quot; He was just real solemn -- like he didn ' t like it . He was seemingly depressed -- at the time he should have been happiest. &quot; Nonetheless , news of his apparent suicide prompted gasps Friday . &quot; Oh , my God ! &quot; cried Suzi Brownsteen , clapping her hand to her mouth . &quot; I can ' t believe it ! It ' s so weird. &quot; At the_Virgin Megastore in Costa Mesa , Shawn Euzebio fought_back tears : &quot; His music touched lots of people -- it got me through my own stuff . &quot; This is the first band I ever had somebody die on me , &quot; said Euzebio , 20 . &quot; He was a spokesperson for our generation -- he represented what we all feel in our lives , but he lived it. &quot; Indeed , the sense of deja_vu was overwhelming as Cobain joined a long line of creative and self-destructive musicians . &quot; Another one bites the dust , &quot; Mark Narramore , 35 , said quietly as he flipped through Pink Floyd CDs at the_Virgin Megastore in West Hollywood . Some were infuriated . &quot; I ' m so disappointed in him , &quot; said Jodie Wilson , 24-year-old supervisor of Tower Records on Sunset . &quot; I think it ' s a very bad example to set . I know life gets bad but not this bad . And he had the power and the money to disappear and take_care of himself . . . . Just think if some poor kid is sad and puts_on a Nirvana album and thinks , ' Hey , if he did_it . . . ' &quot; In fact , that was one thought going_through the mind of an afternoon disc_jockey on KROQ who offered_up pleas to those listeners depressed about life , who might want to imitate Cobain , to call the station instead for sources of help . A curtain of mourning descended on some L.A. rock stations , and the bass lines of Nirvana ' s popular &quot; Come As You Are &quot; wafted across the airwaves all afternoon along with other Nirvana songs . Disc_jockeys offered_up melancholy reflections on the troubled Cobain and even the phone message recording from the Seattle medical_examiner ' s office that officially announced his death . KROQ announced that they would play Nirvana all Friday evening and postpone their promised Depeche Mode weekend . Kevin Blair , 24 , a musician shopping at the_Virgin Megastore in West Hollywood , was already mourning the passing of the music . &quot; The rawness of Nirvana is what I liked , &quot; Blair said . &quot; He ' ll probably be a legend. &quot; At some record stores , the playing of Nirvana was spurned . &quot; I kind of feel that ' s in bad taste -- to encourage or glamorize the fact that someone shot themselves , &quot; said Virgin Megastore floor manager Jon Nelson . Nonetheless , the store -- which was flooded with calls all morning from fans desperate to learn whether Cobain was really dead -- had no qualms about stocking up_to supply the expected demand for Nirvana CDs . &quot; We just ordered 150 more copies -- as_many as we could , &quot; said Nelson . &quot; that ' s business. &quot;</TEXT>
