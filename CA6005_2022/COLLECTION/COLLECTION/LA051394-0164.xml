   <HEADLINE> RICH GET RICHER FLOUTING U.N. SANCTIONS ON HAITI ; CARIBBEAN : EXEMPTIONS DESIGNED TO HELP THE POOR SURVIVE THE CRACKDOWN ARE BEING SUBVERTED FOR ' ENORMOUS PROFITS. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Exemptions designed to help the suffering poor here survive tougher U.N. sanctions that take_effect soon already are being subverted for &quot; enormous profits &quot; by the very targets of the international crackdown , diplomats and humanitarian aid experts say . Among the unintended benefactors are some of the richest , most powerful Haitian elite . They supported the 1991 coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and have financially backed the military since . &quot; The people the embargo is supposed to drive_out of power are already getting rich and will get_even richer , &quot; said an official of a large private relief agency , &quot; because they now control the import of the food exempted by the sanctions. &quot; According to a U.N. Security_Council resolution passed last Friday , the only trade that will be allowed here , starting May 21 , will be in food and humanitarian-related items . And while the resolution calls_for freezing assets and banning international travel for the military and its civilian allies , there are no provisions to prevent them from importing items exempted from sanctions . Diplomats and other foreign officials identify the Mev family , one of Haiti ' s richest and the most powerful allies of those who led the coup , as controlling the import of sugar , vegetable_oil and much of the propane permitted for cooking . It has already been disclosed that they are involved in the cement business with Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois , the national police_chief who played a crucial role in the 1991 coup and who has been named by U.N. officials as being responsible_for severe , large-scale human_rights abuses . The Brandt family -- identified by the United States as major supporters of the coup -- &quot; dominate the import of nearly all_the wheat and rice brought into the country &quot; as well as controlling currency exchange , an American official said . Haiti has been subject_to various levels of sanctions since the coup , all measures aimed at driving_out the military regime and restoring Aristide . But the sanctions , instead , have hurt the 95 % of Haitians who live_in extreme poverty . The sanctions have enriched army_officers and their civilian allies through government corruption and their control of the extensive smuggling , particularly in gasoline , that has grown out of the usually weak , incomplete measures imposed on Haiti by the international community . In theory , the tougher sanctions ordered last week by the U.N. Security_Council will end such profiteering by shutting_down all trade , except for food and humanitarian aid . &quot; These items are exempt , &quot; said an official of one of the largest private relief agencies , &quot; so the very people who are supposed to be punished are being allowed to get_even richer. &quot; A diplomat noted : &quot; Keep_in mind , Haiti now imports most of its basic food needs , even rice , beans and sugar , and the Mevs ( and ) Brandts . . . have been careful to establish their control over these products , which include the importation of normal fresh and packaged foods to be sold commercially here . So , even if the embargo shuts down everything else they operate , they still get rich. &quot; Under the new sanctions , the military-supporting elite &quot; may_not be able to fly to Miami , &quot; another official said . &quot; But I don ' t think they care. &quot; To illustrate how the rich get richer by flouting sanctions , Haitian experts , American officials and other diplomats pointed to the activities of civilian front_men for Francois , who controls the smuggling of gasoline and other fuel_oils . They said a major gas smuggler is Gerald Caroli , who lives_in the southern seaside town of Jacmel and is a longtime associate of Francois and other military_officers . Caroli , they said , has been responsible_for smuggling millions of gallons of fuel from the neighboring Dominican_Republic since U.N. sanctions on importing gas in Haiti took_effect last October . His gross_profits from his operations since then have gone as high as 400 % , experts said . They said he has restored 40 % of the fuel supply used by Haiti before the coup . Closing the Dominican border is crucial to enforcement . But this is a doubtful prospect , U.S. Embassy officials say . Even if it happens , several army_officers , financed by civilian allies , have purchased small_ships to continue smuggling gas and other banned items . &quot; They are betting that these ships will be small enough and run close enough to shore to escape detection or capture , &quot; one Haitian expert said . Caroli ' s major clients include the U.S. Embassy , which has bought so_much black_market gas for its generators and vehicles -- including private cars of American diplomats -- that its budget is at least $ 300 # 000 in the red , State_Department officials in Washington said . &quot; The situation is so serious , &quot; an official here said , &quot; that ( they ) may be forced to cut the size of the embassy staff. &quot; American sources said the huge bills reflect excessive , possibly abusive use of gas from the black_market . It supplies almost all who drive here -- including foreign journalists -- since the only non-government humanitarian groups , such_as National Catholic Relief Services and CARE , are exempt from the sanctions . &quot; When the problem was one of availability , ( embassy staffers ) were told they could have almost no gas for personal cars and very limited amounts for home use ( in generators ) , &quot; a source said . &quot; Much of the embassy was dark . But since the smuggling made_it available , the only problem was cost &quot; -- about $ 10 to $ 12 per gallon . &quot; There were senior officials who were running their home generators as much as 16 hours a day , &quot; the source said , adding that &quot; diplomats were permitted 10 gallons a week for their personal cars . There was a mini-scandal around here. &quot; Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager said he would investigate the allegations of abuses of black_market fuel , but after four days he had offered no response .</TEXT>
