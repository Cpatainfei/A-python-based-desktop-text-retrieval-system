   <HEADLINE> NEW AIRPORTS CHIEF FACES A WEIGHTY ISSUE ; AVIATION : THE RECENTLY NAMED ADMINISTRATOR MUST DECIDE WHETHER A RESTORED , 72 # 000-POUND TRANSPORT IS TOO BIG TO USE THE CAMARILLO RUNWAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When newly named Ventura County Airports Administrator Rod Murphy arrives on_the_job Monday , one of his first decisions will be whether an aging warhorse of an airplane , now lovingly restored to fighting form , is too heavy to take_off from Camarillo Airport . If he makes the wrong call , a catastrophic accident could occur , endangering crew , airplane and the airport ' s runway , county officials say . Murphy , who was appointed to the $ 68 # 562-a-year post by the Board of Supervisors last month , must determine not only whether the runway is strong enough to permit the newly restored Lockheed Super Constellation military transport to leave the airport , but also whether it should regularly fly in and out of the airport . The huge , four-engine aircraft -- known as the Boeing 747 of its day and one of three left in the world -- weighs more_than 72 # 000 pounds . Because of the plane ' s weight , county officials fear that the runway might collapse during takeoff . Murphy , who has been director of the Riverside Department of Airports , declined to comment on the issue Thursday . County officials ' fears were allayed somewhat April 29 when a consultant ' s report tentatively said the runway could support the plane . A final report on the condition of the runway is_due today . &quot; This whole issue has become very emotional , and people have said a lot of things back and forth , &quot; said Michael Musca , an administrative officer with the Department of Airports . &quot; But our concern has been_on safety . We were very concerned that the runway would fail underneath this aircraft . Until we know for_sure , why take chances ? &quot; But Jerry Doyle , general_manager of the Constellation Historical Society , a nonprofit group that has overseen the aircraft ' s three-year restoration , discounted the official ' s concerns . Doyle said his big plane does not pose a danger to the runway , initially built to handle a variety of military aircraft when it was the former Oxnard Air_Force Base before 1975 . &quot; We have spent thousands and thousands of volunteer hours preparing this grand old_lady for flight again . Now that she ' s nearly ready , all we have encountered is red_tape , &quot; Doyle said . &quot; They talk_about safety like it was something foreign to us . We want to stay here , but how much more of this stuff we will take is a question. &quot; The plane , with its 150-foot wingspan , was successfully towed April 29 along a taxiway from its storage site on the airport ' s eastern edge to the western side . But during a trial run of its four engines , one of the power_plants incurred a small electrical fire and had to be shut_down . &quot; The fire was a minor glitch , &quot; Doyle said . &quot; It ' s the fact that we towed her across the airport without a problem should be evidence enough that she can use this airport. &quot; Doyle said the small engine fire will delay the plane ' s readiness for flight by about a month . John R . Mikels , chairman of the Ventura County Aviation Advisory Commission , said many pilots in the county support the Constellation project but remain concerned about safety . &quot; I think the consensus among most of the pilots in the county is that we would like to see the Connie stay here , &quot; Mikels said . &quot; The preliminary look_at the runway ( by the consultant ) would seem to support a limited number of operations for the Constellation. &quot; But while Mikels said he understands airport officials ' desire to leave the decision to Murphy , Hal Geer , a fellow commission member , thought that the delays have been unfair to the historical society . &quot; I understand their reluctance to stick their necks out until Rod arrives , &quot; Geer said . &quot; But I also think that , in some cases , the bureaucracy just doesn ' t listen to common_sense . I think this may be one of those cases. &quot; Historical society officials also say the delays have prevented the Constellation from being part of the national air show circuit -- a critical source of funding for the restoration , upkeep and flight operations of the aircraft . Doyle estimated that if the Constellation could have been at last weekend ' s El Toro Air Show , the event could have raised as much as $ 100 # 000 for the society . Doyle said the society ' s C-121C Super Constellation , once again spit-polished to a high shine and replete with military markings , first saw service in the 1950s as part of the U . S . Military Air Transport Service , the U . S . Air_Force and finally the Mississippi Air National_Guard . It was used during the Korean conflict and the Vietnam_War . After being retired from military_service in the early 1970s , the society ' s plane changed owners a_few times , eventually ending_up as a crop duster in 1973 . In 1976 , the plane was placed in storage , where it remained until late 1982 , when it was purchased by historical society President Daryoush ( Benny ) Younesi of Van Nuys . In 1984 , the aircraft was flown to Camarillo Airport and placed in storage until the society ' s restoration project began in 1991 .</TEXT>
