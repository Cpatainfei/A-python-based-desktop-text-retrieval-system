   <HEADLINE> PAKISTANI OFFICIAL WARNS OF NUCLEAR WAR OVER KASHMIR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pakistan ' s foreign_minister warned Saturday of the danger of nuclear war in South Asia if India and Pakistan fail to resolve their longstanding dispute over Kashmir . The dire but ambiguous remark by Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali , on a weeklong tour of former Soviet republics in Central Asia , came just days after a stalemate in negotiations over Kashmir in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad . Ali ' s strong statement appears to be largely an attempt to regionalize the Kashmir issue by pulling Uzbekistan and the other Muslim republics of Central Asia into a negotiating process that India insists should be strictly bilateral . But talk_of war is likely to create more disquiet in the region rocked by fighting in Afghanistan , Tajikistan and other hot spots . Ali told reporters here that &quot; the core problem of South Asia is the Kashmir dispute. &quot; Unless this dispute &quot; is solved on the basis of international_law and the U.N. resolutions , &quot; he said , &quot; there cannot be lasting peace in South Asia. &quot; Pakistan and India have gone_to_war three times since their independence in 1947 . Kashmir , predominantly Muslim but mostly under the control of predominantly Hindu India , was the prime cause of two of those wars . The threat of another Indo-Pakistani war is heightened by the fact that both countries are believed either to possess nuclear_weapons or to have the components to assemble them . &quot; The concern of the world , the concern of South Asia countries , &quot; Ali said , &quot; is that if a war takes_place in South Asia , it might become a nuclear war . &quot; We all want to see that this does not happen , &quot; he said , &quot; and the best way to do that is to resolve the Kashmir dispute. &quot;</TEXT>
