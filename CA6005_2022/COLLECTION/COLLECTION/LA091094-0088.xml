   <HEADLINE> JAPAN CRITICIZES U.S. FOR ITS STRATEGY ON BALANCING TRADE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the countdown to a U.S. sanctions deadline , Japan criticized the United States on Friday for pursuing a managed-trade strategy that has helped stir &quot; frustration and distrust &quot; between the world ' s richest economies . Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto issued his attack -- along with plenty of promises to reform the Japanese economy -- as negotiators completed two days of talks in Los Angeles in pursuit of an elusive trade truce to ward_off a Sept . 30 showdown . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono met Thursday , and lower-level U.S. and Japanese officials met Friday . Neither side reported advances during this week ' s talks . Hashimoto arrived in town Friday for talks between the four big economic powers -- the United States , Japan , Canada and the European Union -- whose trade ministers were to meet Friday evening and start debating how best to advance the cause of global free_trade . But those &quot; Quad &quot; meetings , to begin in_earnest over the weekend , were all but overshadowed by the transpacific standoff . At issue : Japan ' s $ 131-billion trade surplus and how to crack open the world ' s No . 2 economy . Tokyo accuses the U.S. team of trying to micro-manage business , a strategy it says is anathema to free_trade . Japan says the U.S. insistence on yardsticks to measure how far it opens markets will lead to quotas for U.S. exporters and amounts to trade by government decree . Hashimoto , pledging &quot; the birth of a new Japan , &quot; said his coalition government is committed to reform and delivering consumers a better deal . Both sides , he said , must battle the &quot; frustration and distrust &quot; spawned by the dispute . The United States has threatened trade sanctions if Japan does not make substantial progress on opening its markets by the Sept . 30 deadline . Publicly , officials on both sides said the discussions were_on track and friendly -- or as friendly as can be expected given the U.S. deadline for progress or possible sanctions . Instead of a major breakthrough , a Japanese trade official said , the allies have now agreed to shoot_for a partial agreement in late September , just ahead of the deadline . As for the Quad talks , Friday ' s agenda was largely social . Weekend sessions will touch_on the status of world trade talks , prospects for liberalization and the traditional sparring over commerce that splinters the world ' s powerhouses . EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and Canada ' s Roy MacLaren were_due to arrive in late afternoon . Dinner with Hashimoto and Kantor was to follow .</TEXT>
