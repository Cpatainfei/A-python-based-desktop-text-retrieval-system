   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND JAMES BATES : COMPANY TOWN ; FOR ROY DISNEY , LEGACY IS EVERYTHING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Michael D . Eisner installed the Seven Dwarfs atop Team Disney headquarters as enduring symbols of the company ' s heritage , he might as well have added the image of Roy E . Disney . The painfully shy executive with the uncanny resemblance to his Uncle Walt has a habit of popping_up at critical junctures in the company ' s history to somehow help sway events his way . Roy Disney ' s fingerprints were all_over the management coup that ushered_in the Eisner-Frank G . Wells regime some 10 years ago . Now he ' s helped to derail the ambitious plans of Wells ' would-be successor -- studio Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg . &quot; Roy ' s a very clever , skillful man , &quot; one associate said Thursday . &quot; He ' s not openly aggressive , but he always gets what he wants . Maybe the cardigan sweaters lull people. &quot; Sources close to the company say that from the start , Roy Disney was openly hostile to Katzenberg succeeding Wells as president . As a close friend of Wells , he resented Katzenberg ' s intense lobbying effort . But even before that , Disney , who is in_charge of supervising the company ' s animation department , often complained that Katzenberg was taking too_much credit for the spectacular success of animated features such_as &quot; The Lion King &quot; and &quot; Aladdin. &quot; Despite Katzenberg ' s phenomenal success in managing Disney ' s studio operations -- annual filmed entertainment operating income alone rose from $ 2.2 million in 1984 to $ 622.2 million in 1993 -- Eisner and the other board_members shared Roy Disney ' s reservations about putting the studio chief in a corporate role . Sources say Disney ' s behind-the-scenes work -- augmented by the vociferous protests of director Stanley P . Gold , who heads the Disney heir ' s Shamrock Holdings -- clearly eased the way for Eisner to announce Katzenberg ' s departure . Board_member Raymond L . Watson said Thursday that Disney &quot; has a legitimacy that comes from both the amount of stock he owns and his heritage , &quot; adding , &quot; When he speaks at the board_meetings or speaks_to animators , they know this is not just a paid executive but someone whose life has been nurturing the company. &quot; * At 64 , Disney holds the title of vice_chairman of the board , but his role is much more expansive than that . He demanded and received the job of supervising animation in the 1980s , when Eisner and Katzenberg wanted to scrap the division . He has since become a trusted adviser to Eisner , who sees in him a non-threatening presence who also carries the prized family_name . Sources say their bond has grown even stronger since the company was shaken by two dramatic recent events : Wells ' death in a helicopter crash in April and Eisner ' s emergency quadruple heart bypass surgery last month . Disney rushed in from his seaside castle in Ireland to be at Eisner ' s side , and a company statement pointedly named him as Eisner ' s stand-in . It was an unaccustomed moment in the sun . Despite inheriting Walt Disney ' s physical features , Roy inherited practically none of his late uncle ' s famous charisma , close friends readily concede . Puffing on an ever-present cigarette , he can usually be found holding_up the wall at company events . One entertainment analyst says Disney has played no visible role in the company ' s investor gatherings in recent years , though Eisner and Wells may have been throwing him a bone at the annual meeting in Florida earlier this year when they allowed him to make the formal announcement that the company was finally releasing its classic animated tale &quot; Snow White &quot; on videocassette . Aside from his work_at the family store , Disney has profited handsomely from Shamrock Holdings , the investment_company led by Gold . The company made a fortune buying and selling soybean giant Central Soya . While he has cut_back on his work the last three years , people close to Disney say his passion for protecting the company ' s legacy is what keeps him going , long after he could have retired on a nest_egg valued at $ 540 million . * His interest in animation dates to his childhood , when Walt Disney tried_out concepts for movies such_as &quot; Pinocchio &quot; on his young nephew . Roy , whose father co-founded the studio , later went_to work_on the Burbank lot as a film editor , producer and writer . But he was resented be some colleagues because of his family connection and derided by others at the time as the &quot; idiot nephew &quot; for his diffident and uncommunicative manner . Even while serving on the board before the 1984 power shift , Disney rarely said much in meetings , something friends now attribute to the overall lack of respect he was accorded then . That changed drastically 10 years ago , when he and Gold engineered the ouster of the company ' s beleaguered management team in favor of Eisner and Wells , who orchestrated one of the most successful turnarounds in U.S. corporate history . * While Disney spends much of his time at his vacation_home in Ireland , jetting there in his private plane , sources say he is still involved in the day-to-day operations of the company ' s vaunted animation department , which was supervised by him , Katzenberg and animation chief Peter Schneider before the recent upheaval . People close to the studio say it was Roy Disney who pushed the company into paying_for the expensive automated equipment that allowed its animators to move_into the modern age . On the creative side , one executive describes Disney as &quot; a big-picture guy , &quot; whereas Katzenberg focused_on the finer points of character and script development . &quot; No one plays the bully role in animation . It ' s too collaborative for that , &quot; said one source . &quot; But Roy puts_forward ideas . He ' s very creative , he gives great notes and he ' s certainly no idiot . It ' s not just by luck that all this this has happened to him. &quot;</TEXT>
