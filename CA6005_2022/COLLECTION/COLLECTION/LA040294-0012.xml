   <HEADLINE> LONGSHOREMEN OUTLINE PROGRAM AFTER 2 SLAIN IN SAN PEDRO ; REACTION : UNION LEADER SAYS GROUP WILL LOBBY TO CREATE JOBS FOR HARBOR-AREA YOUTHS . RALLY IS AT SPOT WHERE JAPANESE STUDENTS WERE SHOT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles longshoremen gathered at noon Friday at the spot where two Japanese students were gunned_down last week to mourn the deaths and to hear their union ' s promises to fight crime by creating jobs and promoting tolerance . To applause , David Arian , president of the International Longshoremen ' s and Warehousemen ' s Union , outlined a union-backed program intended to stem violence in the Los Angeles Harbor area where many union_members live and work . &quot; All around us we see death taking_place , &quot; Arian told about 150 longshoremen and others gathered_in the Ralphs grocery_store parking_lot in San Pedro . It was there that Marymount College_students Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura , both 19 , were fatally shot during a carjacking March 25 . Arian announced that the union would lobby to create jobs for harbor-area youths , support suitable penalties for crime , launch cultural exchange programs and plant trees in memory of the slain students . &quot; Don ' t mourn , organize ! &quot; Arian urged members . The gathering , part memorial service and part union rally , illustrated again how the shootings have shaken the harbor community of San Pedro , 23 miles south of Downtown . Some residents say they are chagrined and worried that because of the international publicity catalyzed by the students ' deaths , their community has been unfairly cast as a crime capital . Some who attended the rally said they want to make clear to the Japanese that they oppose violence . &quot; We came here to show that we are not all crazy gun-toting people in this country , &quot; said Ernie Peterson , 60 , of Lomita , retired from the Merchant_Marines . Some have expressed concern that the publicity will damage Japanese trade_in the harbor area . Japanese cargo accounted_for about a quarter of the cargo tonnage passing_through Los Angeles Harbor in 1992 . &quot; The perception of Los Angeles is critical because Japan is our largest trading partner in terms of the amount of cargo moving_in and out of here from Japan , &quot; said Jeff Leong , spokesman for the Port of Los Angeles . To date , there is no indication that Japanese shippers are diverting cargo to other West Coast ports , Leong said . Steve Bebich , secretary and business_agent at ILWU Local 63 , said many jobs depend_on Japanese business , and he wonders if the shootings could make shippers think_twice about Los Angeles . But most longshoremen interviewed at the Friday rally said they were there not out of fear that business could be lost , but to take a stand against violent crime . Several said they agree with Arian that a program to create jobs could help keep youths out of trouble . &quot; If you got a job to go_to , you don ' t have time to mess_up , &quot; said Norman Tuck , secretary-treasurer of ILWU Local 13 , which has 2 # 700 area members . He said he is talking to industries in the area about job programs . Although the rally was prompted by the deaths of the two Japanese college_students , Tuck said : &quot; We have to make_sure that we don ' t exclude the youths that live and grew_up in this area. &quot; As the rally ended , Ronnie Escalante , 24 , of San Pedro , who described himself as a former gang member , noted that no such outpouring followed the death of his younger brother in a San Pedro drive-by_shooting two years ago . Youths in the area need jobs , he added . &quot; The port of San Pedro is so rich . How come we can ' t get these jobs ? &quot; Escalante asked . A passerby suggested he organize a meeting with the union , and Escalante promised to try .</TEXT>
