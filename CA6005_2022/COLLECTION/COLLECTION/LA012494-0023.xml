   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE ; OUR LIFELINES ARE ALSO OUR ACHILLES ' HEELS ; BESIDES BUILDINGS , WE MUST PROTECT ELECTRICITY , TELECOMMUNICATIONS , TRANSPORTATION AND WATER AND SEWER_SYSTEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The built environment for a city like Los Angeles can be divided into two categories : the buildings in which we live and work and those utilities , services and facilities that enable us to educate our children , increase productivity , protect ourselves against disease , live_in peace and enjoy an unparalleled standard_of_living . This second category , the civil infrastructure , can be further divided into public buildings and five lifelines : electric_power , gas and liquid fuels , telecommunications , transportation and water and sewer_systems . These provide the foundation on which modern society has built its wealth and quality_of_life . Since World_War_II , the United States has invested heavily in its infrastructure and has developed some of the most sophisticated lifelines in the world . Most of our food , shelter , health_care , commerce and defense depends_on an intricate network of interdependent lifelines . It has been said that lifelines are both the lubricant that speeds a society ' s development and the glue that binds us together . But for whatever reason , their existence is almost always taken_for granted and their availability at minimal cost is considered to be the right of every citizen . Yet they are surprisingly fragile . At 4:31 a.m. last Monday , a moderate-sized earthquake in the San Fernando Valley paralyzed portions of one of the world ' s largest cities . Electric supply was lost , bridges collapsed , major freeways were closed , water_mains and gas_lines ruptured , fires broke_out , dams and reservoirs were damaged and a train loaded with toxic materials overturned . Los Angeles , a city that lives on the edge , awoke to find itself on the brink of a major disaster . Fortunately , few people were_on the streets at the time , but reconstruction will take many years . For some people , the emotional scars and financial impact will last a lifetime . History repeats itself in surprising ways . The 1971 earthquake at Sylmar in the San Fernando Valley was of similar magnitude , and it too played havoc with our lifelines . In fact , the damage sustained in 1971 drew national attention to the importance and fragility of these systems . The Technical Council for Lifeline Earthquake Engineering was formed soon afterward by the American Society of Civil Engineers , with the object of improving the performance of lifelines in earthquakes . But progress has been hampered by the very nature of lifelines , their interdependence and the conflicting interests of the many owners with jurisdiction over these systems . Lifelines have been largely neglected by the research community since they have not been perceived to be as important as buildings when mitigating the loss of life and protecting property . Funding agencies have also been slow to recognize the importance of lifeline research and the development of design criteria . This situation has improved slightly in recent years , but with the exception of highway bridges , there are still no federal or state codes for the seismic design of lifelines . Some owners of large utilities in Southern California have developed their own standards , and they are to be commended for this action . But this voluntary effort is fragmentary at best and inadequate to the public interest . This is because most lifelines are linear systems with little redundancy and are only as robust as their weakest link . All elements of the system and all interdependent systems need to be designed to the same set of seismic criteria to assure their continued operation during and after a major earthquake . The most expeditious way to achieve this is through the adoption of nation- ally applicable seismic standards for lifelines . It follows that lifelines are the Achilles ' heel of modern society . They are the unprotected segment of our built environment without which life as we know it would cease to exist . The damage to the lifelines in 1971 , and again this last week , is the writing on the wall for the community and for state and federal decision-makers . Seismic standards for lifelines must be developed and adopted before the next magnitude 6 or larger earthquake pushes Los Angeles over the edge .</TEXT>
