   <HEADLINE> CITY_COUNCIL OKS FUNDS FOR QUAKE SOIL SAMPLING ; SIMI VALLEY : RESIDENTS HAD REQUESTED FURTHER STUDY OF POST-TEMBLOR GROUND SHIFTING . CITY EXPECTS FEDERAL MONEY TO COVER COSTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As part of an ongoing effort to pinpoint ground shifting that occurred because of the Northridge earthquake , the Simi Valley City_Council on Monday agreed to fund a study to help prevent future mishaps . The council will pay Ventura-based consultant Fugro West as much as $ 132 # 000 to bore deep into the soil in parts of Simi Valley that were hit hard by the quake.The city expects the cost of the study to be covered by federal quake relief funds . A preliminary study conducted earlier this year showed that the ground was largely stable but still subject_to some settling , prompting residents to ask the city to examine the problem further . Without more detailed information , some homeowners fear they cannot settle insurance_claims or begin rebuilding . In its investigation , Fugro West will collect and scrutinize soil samples from as deep as 50 feet , said City Engineer George Berg . The consultant will then offer homeowners tips on what they can do to shore_up against future damage . &quot; The initial report was primarily a surface analysis , &quot; Berg said . &quot; Now we ' re going below ground to take_a_look at these movements and come_up with some findings . It ' s more scientific. &quot; Mayor Greg Stratton said the study would help residents looking_to rebuild their homes and city workers concerned about laying pipes and electrical lines along quake-cracked streets . &quot; This will be good for the neighbors and good for us , &quot; Stratton said . &quot; Obviously , we need to know what ' s going_on below ground before we start putting things down there. &quot;</TEXT>
