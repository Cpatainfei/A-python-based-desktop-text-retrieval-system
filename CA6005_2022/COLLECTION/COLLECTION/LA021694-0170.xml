   <HEADLINE> COURTS REJECT PLEA ; AERIAL MEDFLY SPRAYING BEGINS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Aerial spraying of the Medfly-killing insecticide malathion began Tuesday night after the state Supreme Court and a Riverside Superior_Court rejected last-minute appeals_to stop the controversial air_attack on the crop-ravaging pest . Shortly after 9 p.m. , three helicopters began spewing a sticky corn_syrup bait laced with the garden-variety insecticide over an 18-square-mile area of Corona and Norco . Despite a widespread community outcry over the aerial application of malathion and four court battles in which the city stalled but could not derail the eradication plans , there were no disruptions once the operation began . Some protesters had threatened to release helium-filled balloons to thwart the aircraft , but later decided against it . Concern that the most passionate opponents might resort_to more violent means appeared to be unwarranted as the spraying continued into the night . Because of concerns that attempts might be made to sabotage the operation , the helicopters were prepared under military guard at March Air_Force Base near Riverside . Weather_conditions were considered perfect for the 3 1 / 2-hour operation , in which the helicopters flying in formation made continuous passes_over the city at an altitude of about 400 feet , blanketing residential neighborhoods , business , parks and farmland with the droplets . Throughout the area , many vehicles were covered with tarps and other material to protect the paint . Spectators watched the aircraft from a distance , then retreated indoors for cover as the helicopters approached . Some horse owners hobbled their animals so they could not run_away if they were spooked . Even though Corona could not stop the flights , officials threatened more legal_action . &quot; It will cost us $ 100 # 000 or better to send crews out_to hose_down the parks and schools , &quot; City Councilman Jeff Bennett said . &quot; I ' m advising every resident to file a damage claim against the state. &quot; The spraying began after three false starts caused by bad_weather and court-ordered postponements . Corona had appealed the spraying to a Riverside Superior_Court Judge , arguing that the state violated its own environmental regulations by failing to study the long-term health effects of malathion . It also contended that Gov . Pete Wilson legally erred when he declared a state emergency over the presence of a single Medfly in Corona . State agriculture officials said that if the fly is not eradicated in Corona it could spread to rich farmlands and threaten the state ' s $ 18-billion agricultural industry . The judge said that Wilson acted properly and that malathion did not pose a risk to the public ' s health . The city ' s appeal_to the 4th District Court of Appeals was rejected after that court said the need to eradicate the pest was obvious . Tuesday morning , the state Supreme Court in San Francisco refused to review the case . And later in the day , the city was again rebuked by Riverside Superior_Court Judge Vincent Miceli when it argued that the state ' s notice of the spraying was too ambiguous . Mayor Bill Miller said he talked to Wilson late Tuesday afternoon but failed to win a last-minute reprieve . Miller said he was resigned to the aerial spraying but worried about any possible long-term health effects . &quot; I don ' t want Corona to be the example of the case study 20 years from now , &quot; he said . Miller spent part of the evening at the local National_Guard armory , opened_to shelter the homeless from the spraying . The amount of malathion released equaled 1.2 fluid_ounces per acre -- a weaker dose than probably would be used by back-yard gardeners and commercial growers if they were to battle the Medfly on_their_own , state officials say . The concentration was half that used in 1989-90 when more_than 500 square_miles of Southern California were targeted for aerial malathion spraying . Officials believed then that they had gotten_rid_of the pest , but it reappeared in 1991 . Japan and other export markets have threatened to boycott California citrus and other produce vulnerable to the Medfly if the infestation spreads . To battle the current Medfly infestation in the Los Angeles Basin , about 500 million sterile Medflies will be released weekly in a 1 # 500-square-mile area encompassing parts of Los Angeles , Orange and San Bernardino counties . Corona officials said some of those flies should have been reserved for use in western Riverside County as well . But the state said there were not enough sterile Medflies to also blanket Corona , so the aerial spraying was a necessary last_resort . From eight to 10 aerial applications are scheduled in the next four months by the state and federal Cooperative Medfly Project to rid Corona of the Mediterranean_fruit_fly .</TEXT>
