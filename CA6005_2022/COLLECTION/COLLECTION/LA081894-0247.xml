   <HEADLINE> FELONY CHARGES ARE FILED OVER PORN CACHE AT LIVERMORE LAB ; CRIME : A RECENT EMPLOYEE IS ACCUSED OF COMPUTER SERVICES THEFT . A FORMER CO-WORKER FACES MINOR COUNTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Alameda County district_attorney filed felony charges against a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory employee Wednesday , alleging that he used lab computers to store and distribute pornography . A second employee faces lesser charges . The pornography cache , initially discovered by a Times reporter , contained 90 # 000 images , according to John Bell , the assistant district_attorney . The images allegedly were stored on lab computer tapes and loaded onto on-line systems by one of the two defendants . They could then be retrieved by others via the Internet computer_network . William Allen Danforth , a technician who worked in the Computer Applications Sciences and Engineering division of the lab , faces two felony charges of theft of computer services . Livermore officials confirmed that Danforth resigned Aug . 15 ; he could not be reached for comment Wednesday . &quot; If the guy hadn ' t been using the taxpayers ' computer for his personal interest in pornography , he would n ' t be prosecuted , &quot; Bell said , adding that the lab spent more_than $ 13 # 000 to conduct an internal investigation . &quot; Because of the nature of the work they do at the lab , they had no choice but to do a thorough cleansing of their computer_system to see just what this guy was doing. &quot; The facility at Livermore , southeast of San Francisco , is one of the nation ' s three nuclear_weapons laboratories . In a statement Wednesday , the lab said its own investigation concluded &quot; that ( Danforth ) had arranged for computer data storage and access that facilitated software copyright violations and publication of sexually explicit images by a select group of Internet users . Most of the images were of adults ; however , much less than 1 % involved children. &quot; Bell would not say whether additional charges relating to child pornography might be brought . More_than 50 gigabytes of porn -- far more_than originally reported -- was ultimately uncovered , and sources said that as_many as 20 collaborators inside and outside the lab may have been involved in obtaining and trading the images . Questions about individual roles and whether money was paid_for access were still being investigated . Bruce Tartar , acting director of the lab , said in the statement that he had ordered a review of computer use , management and oversight systems to prevent future abuses . Michael William Lazzarini , a computer technologist who reportedly worked for Danforth , was charged with infractions -- offenses on the scale of a traffic ticket . He is accused of collaborating with Danforth to operate the porn database . Lazzarini , reached by phone at the lab Wednesday afternoon , said , &quot; I have nothing to say about this incident at this time. &quot; The charges , prepared Wednesday by the district_attorney ' s office , were to have been announced Friday to allow lab officials time to make personnel decisions . Sources said calls from angry officials at the Department_of_Energy in Washington , which oversees the lab ' s operations , speeded_up the process . The lab was embarrassed when the porn cache was discovered last month . The case highlights security problems that have arisen with the rapid_growth of the Internet , which connects government , academic and business computers around the world . If convicted , Danforth could face a maximum sentence of three years in state_prison and a fine of $ 10 # 000 for each of the two felony counts .</TEXT>
