   <HEADLINE> ETHICS MISSING FROM CADAVER CLASS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The well-written article &quot; Bodies of Knowledge , &quot; ( Nov . 15 ) seeks to interest readers in a &quot; cadaver prosection class &quot; offered at Orange Coast College . ( You ) list as requirements for enrollment in the class &quot; a certain instinct and drive to learn about the human body. &quot; An academic prerequisite is a five-hour anatomy class . Why is mention not made of the need for sensitive instruction on medical ethics to include the ethics of cadaver study and a respect for the deceased ? Sensitivity is necessary to respect the wishes of those whose bodies are donated either by themselves or their families . A recent article in the school newspaper describes the same class and makes light and flippant mention of the cadaver ' s nicknames to which ( you ) refer . In defense of this breach of medical ethics , Prof . Ann Harmer states that the school reporter got the information from student interviews . Therein lies the problem . The students have not been indoctrinated with the necessary ethics to which they should have been exposed before having the privilege of cadaver research . Further evidence of the carnival atmosphere of the class is the description of a door opened_to curiosity viewers . can ' t proper ventilation be provided without the curious seeing these bodies being dissected ?
