   <HEADLINE> INTERIOR DEPT . AIMS TO RECHANNEL WATER POLICY IN WEST ; RESOURCES : U.S. PLUNGES INTO POLITICAL RAPIDS WITH NEW PLAN FOR STATES TO SHARE COLORADO_RIVER BOUNTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the arid West , where local authorities used to joke that &quot; whiskey is for drinking , water for fighting , &quot; the competition for Colorado_River water is getting a bit edgy again . At the direction of Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt , the Bureau of Reclamation is trying to reapportion the liquid bounty among the states of California , Arizona and Nevada , which now share about 7.5 million acre-feet , or 2.44 trillion gallons , of river water annually . As it recalculates how the three &quot; lower basin &quot; states should share their water , the federal_government will seek to shift some of the precious resource from powerful agricultural interests to the West ' s burgeoning city populations . In addition , it wants to leave more water in the Colorado to sustain fisheries and other networks of living_things that rely_on the river ' s natural flow for survival . The stakes are enormous . On the table is the Colorado_River Compact , a 72-year-old accord negotiated at a time when California agricultural interests ruled the West , when growing metropolises such_as Los Angeles , Las Vegas and Phoenix had considerably less clout than today . In an effort to begin building a consensus behind the potential changes , Bureau of Reclamation chief Dan Beard literally plunged into the policy rapids . In August , he invited a group of Western water users to join him on a five-day rafting trip so they could see for themselves some of the stresses and strains placed upon the river . Beard repeatedly whooped with delight as the raft plowed through the churning brown rapids of the Colorado . But the river trek , which was interspersed with sober discussions of water_rights and resource demands , is likely to appear tame compared to the political whitewater that Beard and Babbitt are attempting to navigate . Downstream from here , the 34.5 million residents of California , Nevada and Arizona await the refreshment that these waters bring . And thousands of newcomers are arriving daily in these states , clamoring for more . Their sheer numbers are creating dangerous fissures in the legal and political foundations of the current allocation scheme . The Colorado_River Compact and a series of subsequent court rulings are known collectively as the &quot; law of the river. &quot; And that body of law , by design , favors California in_general and irrigated farming operations in particular , by granting them the biggest shares and the first rights to the waters of a river so important to the West that it has been called the American Nile . Nevada , which had only 70 # 407 residents and virtually no agriculture in 1920 , fares poorly under the compact . While California and Arizona enjoy annual allocations of 4.4 million and 2.8 million acre-feet , respectively , Nevada is entitled to only 300 # 000 acre-feet . Nevada is demanding a bigger share , and the federal_government is sympathetic . The Las Vegas area grew by 62 % from 1980 to 1990 . It ranks as the fastest-growing urban_area in the nation , with nearly 1 # 000 newcomers arriving weekly . The Clark County area is projected to exhaust its river entitlement before the year 2010 , according to Patricia Mulroy , general_manager of Southern Nevada ' s Water Authority . Without a new supply , the county will be forced to stop its growth by the year 2000 , she said . Because the law of the river favors farms over cities and California over its lower-basin neighbors , it is seen by some critics -- and by Babbitt and Beard -- as an outdated arrangement that does not reflect the needs of the new West . California farmers , for example , use 3.85 million acre-feet of the state ' s yearly entitlement to irrigate their crops , leaving only 550 # 000 acre-feet for the state ' s other 30 million residents . The Interior_Department will stop short of trying to renegotiate the states ' actual legal shares to the Colorado . Instead , they hope to persuade the states to adopt new procedures enabling them to trade and store water among themselves more freely . Accomplishing even that would be a feat on the order of Moses parting the waters . Beard and Babbitt , already viewed with some distrust throughout the West , must find common_ground among state officials and water users who jealously guard their entitlements and are suspicious of &quot; water grabs &quot; by rivals . Farmers , who typically have held their entitlements longer than about anyone else , already are claiming that any move to reduce their share would constitute an uncompensated and illegal &quot; taking &quot; of private_property by the federal_government . In the past , the Bureau of Reclamation probably would have taken an easier route . Officials would have answered the clamor for more water by building more dams , reservoirs and irrigation projects . But those days are over , Beard said . Tight budgets , environmental concerns and a lack of cost-effective building_sites on the Colorado have brought such projects to a virtual standstill . The bureau -- once regarded primarily as the nation ' s premier dam-building organization -- is recasting itself as a manager of existing water resources . In its new role , the bureau is expected to unveil rules this fall to let California , Arizona and Nevada sell any unused Colorado_River water to each other . Only Arizona has water to spare ; its surplus of 700 # 000 acre-feet would be thirstily snapped_up by its neighbors . Such marketing schemes have met with stout resistance . Arizona is reluctant to go_along because it fears it might lose its rights to any water not retained for its own use . California is opposed because it gets nearly 1 million acre-feet of water each year at no cost . It can do so because it is , before Mexico , the last user of Colorado_River water , and the existing law of the river contains no explicit sanction against diversion of any water allocated to , but not taken by , upstream states . If the states agree to a scheme under which Arizona could market its surplus water , California would have to pay_for water it now gets free . Nevada would like to renegotiate a larger entitlement and , if possible , avoid paying_for any additional water it receives . But it is willing_and_able to pay more if necessary . The Interior_Department proposal gives the federal_government an expanded role in defining the uses to which Colorado_River water can be put . It would broaden Washington ' s traditional role in setting conditions , such_as the establishment of conservation programs . At a time when the federal_government has been accused of waging a &quot; war against the West , &quot; any such expansion is likely to be controversial . The Interior proposal could overturn a fundamental precedent that has been observed since the compact took_effect : Farmers must be allowed their ironclad grip on river water because they established their rights long before cities came_into the picture . Under current law , for example , Las Vegas cannot buy Colorado_River water from a farmer in the Imperial Valley , even if both sides are willing to make a deal . The Interior proposal creates a mechanism for such arrangements . Under the law of the river , marginally profitable crops such_as hay and alfalfa have been drenched with Colorado_River water in the desert-like environment of Arizona while urban dwellers in Southern California have been subjected_to strict water rationing . &quot; Clearly , the driving force behind these negotiations is urbanized southern Nevada and the feeling of leaders there that they ' re close to the edge , &quot; Beard said . More generally , he added : &quot; The big change that ' s going_to come is meeting the needs of Western urban communities . When millions of people in Southern California need water , you just can ' t say , ' Sorry , we need this water to grow alfalfa or hay. ' that ' s just not going_to happen. &quot; For California -- and for the 16 million people in the Southern California Metropolitan Water District -- the stakes in the coming negotiations could not be higher . Slightly more_than a quarter of Southern California ' s water -- about 1.2 million acre-feet annually -- comes from the Colorado . Colorado_River water is the Southland ' s cheapest source of water , costing less than one-tenth of the next-cheapest source . MWD officials have said they want to increase their supply of river water by 350 # 000 acre-feet by the year 2005 . A renegotiation of the compact ' s terms could offer the best opportunity . Despite the traditional interstate rivalries , metropolitan areas , such_as Southern California and Nevada ' s Clark County , along with other states have reached across borders to join forces . They have created an organization called the Western Urban Water Coalition to lobby for changes in Colorado_River water policy . In the long_run , the Interior_Department ' s efforts to increase cooperation among lower-basin states will be stopgap . The battle_royal over the Colorado ' s water lies somewhere beyond the next river bend . Arizona has water to sell today , but it expects to need its full entitlement by 2040 . In the coming decade , the populous lower-basin states are expected to open negotiations with the upper-basin states of Colorado , Wyoming , New Mexico and Utah in hopes of procuring some portion of their yearly entitlements of 7.5 million acre-feet . That will expose new rifts among the seven states served by the river , and it is certain to cause more resentment toward the federal_government . Unless the upper-basin states can persuade Washington to build dams and irrigation projects , they will be unable to use all_of the river water they were promised in the 1922 accord .</TEXT>
