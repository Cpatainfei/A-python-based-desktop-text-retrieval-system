   <HEADLINE> CLAIMS THAT TIE LEUKEMIA TO MALATHION ARE REBUTTED ; HEALTH : TOP COUNTY OFFICIAL SCOLDS GROUP AGAINST SPRAYING PEOPLE FOR SCARING PUBLIC WITH ERRONEOUS INFORMATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The county ' s top public health official on Thursday chided malathion opponents for suggesting there is a connection between aerial applications of the pesticide and leukemia . State Medfly eradication officials , meanwhile , announced that the malathion-laced bait will be sprayed over Camarillo every three weeks instead of every two weeks in January and February . Dr. Gary Feldman , Ventura County ' s public health officer , said a statement made earlier this week by Terri Gaishin , a member of Group Against Spraying People , inaccurately depicts the health risks of spraying malathion over populated areas . In particular , Feldman challenged the opponents ' use of a 1987 Yale_University study that looked_into possible links between malathion byproducts and leukemia . Gaishin , a Camarillo mother who organized a protest outside Feldman ' s Ventura office on Tuesday , told reporters and others gathered there that the Yale study concluded that &quot; malathion has been shown to cause leukemia. &quot; But Feldman said Gaishin ' s assertion is flat-out wrong . He read the same study , Feldman said , and found that the Yale researchers reached a far different conclusion . In the study , scientists drenched human cells drawn from bone_marrow with malathion and observed what happened to them , Feldman said . The replicating property of the cells was depressed for about 14 days before returning to normal , the researchers found . The scientists speculated that there is a possibility that exposure to massive doses of malathion could cause anemia , or depression of the body ' s ability to make red_blood_cells . That effect , however , has never been observed in clinical practice , Feldman said . &quot; There is absolutely no evidence at this point that would link malathion to cancer or human birth_defects , &quot; he said . &quot; There is nothing in the literature to support that conclusion. &quot; Feldman said the statement by Gaishin &quot; lowers the credibility of the GASP folks , who I think have genuine concerns. &quot; Feldman had agreed to review medical research into malathion after Gaishin and about 30 other GASP members picketed outside his office for two hours . The group targeted Feldman because he is charged with warning the community about possible health dangers , members said . Feldman said he decided to go public with his criticism of Gaishin and GASP because he has fielded calls from several Camarillo residents concerned for their families ' health after reading Gaishin ' s remarks . On Thursday , Gaishin admitted that she may have incorrectly stated the study ' s findings . She said she will forward the research paper to Nachman Bratbar , a toxicologist at USC-Medical Center , to ask_for his interpretation of its results . Gaishin also said she will keep fighting for a halt to spraying in Camarillo . &quot; Even if this leukemia study does not bear_out for us , it does not change the fact that there are so many other studies that show this is not a safe program. &quot; Malathion spraying began shortly after the first Medfly was found Sept . 29 in a Camarillo orange grove . The sixth spraying was successfully completed Wednesday night , a day after the scheduled application was delayed because of fog . Cooperative Medfly Project officials said the next spraying over a 16-square-mile section of east Camarillo will begin at 9 p.m. Jan . 17 . The next two treatments will take_place in three-week intervals , on Feb . 7 and Feb . 28 , state officials said . The two-week schedule will be reinstated in March , officials said . Fewer applications are needed in January and February because the cooler weather lowers the Medfly ' s ability to reproduce , said spokesman Doug Hendrix . In a related action Thursday , the Board of Supervisors extended a proclamation of local emergency due_to potential crop losses from the Medfly infestation for two more weeks . The proclamation ensures that the county will be eligible for reimbursement for Medfly eradication costs from state and federal_government programs .</TEXT>
