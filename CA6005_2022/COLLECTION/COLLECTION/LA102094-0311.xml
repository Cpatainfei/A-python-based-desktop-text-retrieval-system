   <HEADLINE> ALTERNATIVE FUELS SHINE IN U.S. STUDY ; ENERGY : TESTING SHOWS THEY BURN CLEANER THAN REFORMULATED GASOLINE TOUTED BY THE OIL_INDUSTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the most extensive comparison yet , natural_gas , methanol , propane and electricity are indeed cleaner-burning vehicle fuels than even improved forms of gasoline , according to preliminary results of a federal study to be released today . Many in the oil_industry have maintained that gasoline reformulated to be cleaner-burning -- which will be required in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities beginning in January -- can provide much the same emissions reductions as most alternative fuels . &quot; Sometimes when you talk to the oil_companies , they say that reformulated gasoline is as_good_as the alternatives , &quot; said Cindy Sullivan , technology advancement program supervisor for the South Coast Air Quality Management District . The study &quot; confirms that alternative fuels do have emissions benefits over gasoline , even reformulated gasoline. &quot; The other key early finding : All the alternatives provided performance that allows specific uses in everyday fleet work . The two-year , $ 10-million study -- called &quot; CleanFleet &quot; -- involved 111 Federal Express delivery_vans in Southern California . Final data , including cost-benefit comparisons , will become available in a series of reports beginning in November , as the vehicle motors are dismantled and tested . The reports -- available through the AQMD or Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus , Ohio , which conducted the study -- will allow fleet managers to consider which specific fuel would be most practical for meeting their regional air_pollution rules . &quot; This also lays the groundwork for other projects in the advanced transportation arena , &quot; said Doug Campbell , an assistant to Rep . Howard L . Berman ( D-Panorama City ) , who solicited funding for the study from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy.ALTERNATIVE FUEL</TEXT>
