   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / JULIE CART ; AS USUAL , FIFA ' S HAVELANGE GETS HIS WAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> That Joao Havelange got his way at last week ' s FIFA executive committee_meeting was no surprise , considering that the question carried potent financial and political ramifications . Expanding the World Cup_finals from 24 to 32 teams , as the executive committee unanimously approved for the 1998 tournament , has long been a pet project of Havelange . And Havelange usually gets what he wants . Politically , the expanded tournament has the same obvious appeal as lowering taxes . Havelange brilliantly appeased both the developing areas of soccer -- Africa and Asia -- and the powerhouse continent of Europe . Havelange wanted the expansion in Africa and Asia to reflect the sport ' s growth in the developing world , where , coincidently , the voting members see the Brazilian as their champion . At the same time , Havelange got European officials to approve the change after promising Europe ' s allocation would not be cut . Having gained that &quot; concession &quot; from Havelange , the Union of European Football Assns . withdrew its challenge to his reelection next month . Africa already had gained a third spot in the finals , after the success of Cameroon in the 1990 World Cup . Asia is_due at least another place with the candidacy of both Japan and South_Korea as host of the 2002 World Cup . It is expected that four of the additional eight teams will come from Africa and Asia . Europe can hardly complain . Thirteen of the 24 teams in next month ' s World Cup are European and , according to one newspaper , The European , Europe will have a shot at the four other new spots through a playoff , with fourth and fifth-place teams from the other zone qualifying . The officials ' allocation of the new berths is expected in December . Financially , the idea is a flat-out boon . Ratings in North_America notwithstanding , television adores the World Cup and more games involving more countries make television very , very happy . And , as Havelange knows , rights fees can now be raised to reflect the larger tournament . All very tidy , except for the_French , who now have a much larger tournament to organize for ' 98 . FIFA is quick to point_out that even with eight groups of four teams , the World Cup will not be any longer and each team will play the same number of first-round games . Yes , but the costs associated with eight additional teams will not be small for an already financially unwieldy creature . The organizers of this summer ' s World Cup had to cut the stadiums from 12 to nine to keeps costs in_line . How will the_French cope ? * U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel has signed a contract with Newcastle United , which finished third in the_English Premier League this season . He will become the third American keeper working in England and no doubt will be held to the high standards of the two others . Kasey Keller at Millwall , who was recently cut from the World Cup roster , had 17 shutouts and allowed 51 goals in 45 games . Juergen Sommer at Luton Town , who was named to the World Cup team , had eight shutouts and allowed 50 goals in 47 games . Friedel ' s prodigious work habits may impress Newcastle ' s coaches more_than the U.S. team staff . Friedel has been nothing but professional and focused during the months of speculation about which keeper -- he or Tony Meola -- will start in the World Cup . Meola ' s reputation is one of slacking_off in practice but coming_on strong in big_games . Friedel is always working hard , but seems to have bad_luck in games . Goalkeepers can accept their own mistakes that lead to goals easier than the mistakes of others . Saturday ' s game against Bayern Munich was another example of defensive breakdowns leaving Friedel exposed to one-on-one plays . Whether he starts a game in the World Cup Friedel , at 23 , can still have a long professional career . And it is going_to pay an immediate dividend . Because he was not with another pro club and had not signed a contract with the U.S. Soccer Federation , he will get_to keep all_of his transfer fee , a reported $ 525 # 000 , instead of giving 90 % to the USSF . * Some snickered at the news that German Coach Berti Vogts opened his team ' s training camp with his roster of 22 players , his coaching staff and doctors and . . . a World Cup referee . Don ' t pass the idea off as &quot; German fastidiousness. &quot; Hellmut Krug , a World Cup referee from Germany , will work the team ' s scrimmages and , &quot; explain the latest FIFA guidelines , &quot; Vogts said . This is just the sort of preparation that pays dividends . As in most sports , there are standards of play during the regular season and then there ' s what ' s allowed_in a World Cup game . Even Germany ' s experienced international players will benefit from training under World Cup conditions . Benefiting even more would be the U.S. World Cup team . The defensive players , in particular , have a habit of sloppy tackling and losing body control in the air . Tackling from behind will not be tolerated and FIFA promises such fouls will be met with a yellow card . The U.S. team can ill afford to compound its problems with the loss of a player to yellow cards or expulsion . And , even with all their accumulated international experience , the U.S. players haven ' t seen the level of acting from opposing players they will be subject_to in the World Cup . * Other notes to come_out of the FIFA executive committee ' s meetings : Officials in Washington , D.C. have halted their fence-building at RFK Stadium . Negotiations are continuing at Dallas regarding the construction of fences around the playing_field and at Palo Alto , where a low fence already exists . * The L.A. County sheriff ' s call_for a tactical alert -- to begin with the June 4 U.S.-Mexico game and run_through the World Cup -- may be standard at big events , but it ' s also clearly timed to offset the L.A. police union ' s rejection of a new contract offer . The union has been using the World Cup as a bargaining_chip in its talks with the city and even launched a short-lived advertising_campaign pointing_out the dangers of living in or visiting Los Angeles . * Last word : The response of U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic , now coaching his third different World Cup team , to the expansion of the number of World Cup teams : &quot; It ' s good . It means you have more places now to find a job. &quot;</TEXT>
