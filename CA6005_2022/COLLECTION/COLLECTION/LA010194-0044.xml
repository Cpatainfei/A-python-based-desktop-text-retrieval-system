   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S TRADITIONAL NEW YEAR ' S FEAST TAKES ON WESTERN FLAVOR ; CULTURE : THE 15 ITEMS OF THE OSECHI MEAL ARE RICH IN MEANING . THE MEAT BALLS AREN ' T .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Atsuko Iizuka spent the last two days of December doing what generations of Japanese women before her have done to ring in the New Year : simmering , boiling , baking and broiling 15 separate items for an elaborate feast called osechi . A highlight of the three-day holiday season that begins today , the New Year ' s feast is a dazzling array of colors and tastes with meaning imbued in each of the main elements . ( Osechi can also be dazzlingly expensive . Iizuka spent $ 180 for the ingredients alone , but the spread sells for as much as $ 900 if custom-ordered from the finest Japanese restaurants. ) Fish eggs symbolize the hope for many offspring . The yellow of the sweet_potato and chestnuts is meant to ward_off bad spirits . The seasoned dried fish , written with Chinese ideograms that mean 50 # 000 grains of rice , is a wish for bountiful harvests . The rolled egg symbolizes the wisdom of the ages handed_down in Japanese scrolls . The black_beans signify the desire for the health to work hard enough to soil the face with sweat and dirt , explained Iizuka ' s husband , Masao . The red and white of the fish_cakes are congratulatory , and the rounded rice cakes symbolize the dawning sun of the new year . Traditionally , five flavors , colors and cooking styles are used ; the food is seasoned to keep for a week to give women their only vacation from the kitchen all year . &quot; Most Japanese don ' t actually think_about these meanings , &quot; Iizuka said . &quot; And young people nowadays don ' t even like to eat osechi much. &quot; Indeed , international influences are permeating even the deepest traditions here and changing the tastes of modern Japanese . The Tokyu Department_Store , for instance , offered sets of Chinese and Western osechi alongside the traditional Japanese spreads . Never mind that roast_beef , smoked salmon and meat balls utterly lack any cultural meaning . To scores of Tokyoites , the international offerings taste better -- and were sold_out by Friday . &quot; Older folks go_for the Japanese sets , but the younger people buy the Chinese and Western , &quot; Tokyu ' s osechi vendor said . New Year ' s arrangements of pine , bamboo and plum -- all good_luck symbols -- also showed Western influences : Snoopy and Woodstock sat perched in some of them and graced the children ' s kites that traditionally portray scenes of sumo wrestlers or geisha . If modern tastes are eroding tradition , so is the recession . Tokyu ' s sales of the osechi sets , which average about $ 250 , fell to about 700 this year , compared to 1 # 200 during the era of the economic &quot; bubble &quot; four years ago , a spokesman said . Daijin Yoshikawa , who has sold New Year ' s wreathlike arrangements for the last 15 years , said his sales have been down for the past three years . During the boom days , he could sell some arrangements for $ 135 ; now he ' s lucky to move the ones priced at $ 35 . To counteract the recession , the famous Ameyoko fish market in Tokyo ' s Ueno district dropped prices by 30 % and managed to pull_in the same number of customers as last year -- about 740 # 000 on Wednesday , with projections of 900 # 000 for Thursday . But the most crowded place in Tokyo on New Year ' s Day will be Meiji Shrine , where an estimated 3.5 million people are expected to visit over the three-day period , police predict . Nationally , 87.5 million people are expected to visit shrines -- the highest number in history . Police say that clear weather and a heightened desire to appeal_to the gods for relief from the recession and rice-crop failure are reasons for the surge . Besides feasting and praying , many Japanese will spend time reading postcards , called nengajo , from friends , relatives and business associates delivered on New Year ' s Day . This year , the cards will be embossed with a pooch : 1994 , according to the cycle of zodiac symbols based on the Chinese lunar_calendar , is the Year of the Dog . The dog year , which comes_around every 12 years , has not been particularly fortuitous for Japan . The dubious hits list includes the annexation of Korea in 1910 , grabbing Manchukuo through a puppet emperor in 1934 , the cutoff of trade ties with China in 1958 and the Lockheed bribery trials in 1982 . This year also projects gloom : The Japanese economy is still going_to the dogs , and Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will face a dogfight getting his reform bills passed .</TEXT>
