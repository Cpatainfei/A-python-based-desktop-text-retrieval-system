   <HEADLINE> IN RUSSIA SPACE_PROGRAM HEROICS , COSMONAUT SNARES CRUCIAL SUPPLIES ; SUCCESS : LOSS OF WAYWARD VESSEL COULD HAVE FORCED CREW TO ABANDON MIR STATION . PROGRAM GETS BOOST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With Russia ' s beleaguered space_program on the line , a rookie cosmonaut aboard the Mir orbiting station guided an unmanned , supply-laden freighter to a safe docking by remote_control Friday after it twice failed to land on autopilot . The tricky linkup by Lt . Col . Yuri Malenchenko , a first in Moscow ' s annals of space achievement , saved $ 60 million worth of research equipment , food and supplies for scheduled manned missions with the European Space Agency next month and the United States in March . Russian space officials said that failure to dock the freighter on the third try would have forced Malenchenko and his two fellow cosmonauts , running_low on food , to abandon the Mir station . That , they said , would have delayed or even canceled the joint missions , worth millions of dollars in revenues . Several dockings between the Mir and American space shuttles are planned in the next two years to gain flight experience for assembling a new station later this decade . Rockwell International Corp. , the Seal Beach-based builder of the shuttles , and McDonnell Douglas Corp. ' s space group in Huntington Beach are developing major parts of the new station . &quot; We were very pleased when we heard of the successful docking , &quot; said Bill Collopy , a Rockwell vice_president . The earlier failed attempts &quot; were of great concern &quot; because they &quot; threatened the operation of the Mir , &quot; he added . Facing his first emergency after two months in space , Malenchenko was under severe pressure . The Itar-Tass news_agency declared that the survival of Russia ' s space_program &quot; now rests literally in the hands of one man. &quot; Technicians at the flight control_center in Kaliningrad guided the 32-year-old cosmonaut through his task by radio as he soared over the Atlantic_Ocean late Friday afternoon and burst into cheers when he succeeded . Malenchenko , a former air_force fighter_pilot , controlled both the Mir station and the freighter , Progress . From a command_module of the Mir , he watched television images beamed from the robot freighter that simulated the view from its driver ' s seat . When the two vessels were about 150 yards apart , space officials said , he activated the remote_controls and steered the Progress at about one foot per second toward a conical target two feet in diameter . &quot; Docking took_place on the first attempt , &quot; said Vsevolod P . Latyshev , a spokesman at the control_center . &quot; We are so relieved . You could feel the tension. &quot; Still , the events that led to the emergency were troubling for the space_program , which has fallen on hard_times since the Soviet_Union collapsed three years ago , and for the foreign clients lined_up to help revive it . Cosmonauts shuttle to the space_station aboard rocket ships and are resupplied regularly by rocket-borne freighters . But the government-run space agency ran_short of cash to pay the newly privatized company that makes the rockets and had to scrap plans for a supply launch in July . With the Mir station ' s food due_to run_out in mid-September and no backup rocket ready , everything depended_on the Progress and its 2.6-ton cargo , launched Aug . 25 . Because budget_cuts have closed some ground tracking stations , specialists believed that Russia risked losing Mir , the centerpiece of the space_program , if it were left unmanned . Guided by autopilot , the Progress made two docking attempts , last Saturday and on Tuesday , bumping_into the 130-ton space_station several times before gliding past . As the freighter ran_low on fuel , the space agency decided to try manual docking , which it had never tried with a loaded freighter . &quot; It is remarkable how Russians heroically create problems for themselves only to resolve them heroically too , &quot; television anchorman Sergei Dorenko said in a special report on the drama . Space officials have not publicly discussed the docking failures but complain of inadequate government financing for their once-mighty industry . They are pinning their hopes on $ 400 million in revenues pledged by NASA over the next four years for U.S.-Russian spaceflights and money from the Europeans for an Oct . 4 blastoff by a German and two Russians . &quot; Today , we work only four days a week instead of six or seven as we used to , &quot; Latyshev said . James Oberg , an independent consultant on the Russian space_program in Houston , said the crisis showed scientists , engineers and cosmonauts at their best in the face of exhausted resources . &quot; The cosmonauts definitely deserve a feast tonight with all that food they got , &quot; he said . &quot; But they can ' t keep going_to the edge like this. &quot; Times staff writer James Peltz in Los Angeles contributed to this report .</TEXT>
