   <TEXT> Prince Alexandre de Merode of Belgium , chairman of the International Olympic Committee ' s medical commission , confirmed Monday that documents concerning positive drug tests during the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles were destroyed before he examined them , but he said that he believes the episode resulted from an accident and not a cover-up . &quot; This was a small incident , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s not a scandal. &quot; Since arriving here for this week ' s Centennial Olympic Congress , members of the IOC ' s executive board have responded with a similar lack of concern about a recent BBC television report alleging that test results were stolen from De Merode ' s office in Los Angeles and shredded in a conspiracy involving officials of the IOC and the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee . &quot; You ' re talking_about something that ' s 10 years old , &quot; IOC Vice_President Kevan Gosper of Australia said . &quot; I think we would be_better served to discuss medical commission issues that are pertinent now. &quot; Another board_member , Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles , said : &quot; It ' s pretty old news . I don ' t know why it ' s being brought_up now. &quot; The IOC ' s director general , Francois Carrard , said last week that the executive board would seek information from De Merode during the medical commission ' s report scheduled for Sunday . When Carrard learned , however , that De Merode would be detained in Belgium until Monday , he said the executive board might not pursue the_matter . &quot; It ' s not on the agenda , &quot; Carrard said . Upon arriving in Paris on Monday , De Merode told the Associated Press that five or six test results were destroyed , not nine as reported by the_British television network . He also disputed the BBC ' s claim that he knows the names of the offending Olympians , saying that the code numbers used to connect the athletes to their tests were shredded before he had an opportunity to identify them . &quot; Nobody knows , &quot; he said . De Merode said he believes the documents , most of them involving tests conducted during the final two days of the Games , were victims of the LAOOC ' s efforts to save money as the committee shut_down as_many operations as possible after the closing ceremony . When de Merode returned to his office in the Biltmore Hotel on the night after the Games ended , he said he discovered that it had been reconverted into a suite . &quot; I called the organizing committee and was told , ' You must understand , you are in the United States . The Games are finished , everything is finished , ' &quot; he said . He said he went_to LAOOC offices the next day to inquire about the medical commission documents , including the drug test results , and was told by the organizing committee ' s chief medical_officer , Tony Daly , that they had been sent to IOC headquarters in Lausanne , Switzerland . When De Merode said he would travel_to Lausanne to inspect them , Daly changed his story , according to De Merode , who said he was then told : &quot; I must tell the truth . Everything was destroyed in the paper shredder . We are sorry , but we can ' t produce anything from your documents . I apologize , but we can ' t do anything. &quot; De Merode said he believed the explanation . &quot; I don ' t believe it was intentional because it ' s certainly not in their interest , &quot; he said . &quot; The U.S. mentality was the Games were finished . They didn ' t want to pay . They were a private organization . The U.S. attitude is not the same as the European one . They have their efficiency . Everything is done very quickly . They like to save money . &quot; that ' s why I believe it was an accident . It ' s an unfortunate story , but it was not done deliberately. &quot; But when asked about the missing tests last week , Daly told The Times he had not heard about them . He said nothing about accidentally destroying documentation in the organizing committee ' s haste to close the hotel offices . &quot; From the standpoint of covering_up , that would be shocking , &quot; said Daly , who served as chief medical_officer of soccer ' s World Cup ' 94 this summer . &quot; It would not be possible for ( the LAOOC ) to do anything . We report the results to the IOC. &quot; Several IOC members , including De Merode , questioned the motives of Arnold Beckett , a former IOC medical commission member from Great Britain who gave information about the drug tests to the BBC . Beckett left the commission in a dispute during the 1992 Summer Games at Barcelona . &quot; It ' s being brought_up by someone who left the medical commission and wanted to stay , &quot; said DeFrantz , who was an LAOOC official but was not involved with drug testing . In an interview last week with The Times , Beckett implicated Italy ' s Primo Nebiolo , president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation . When asked about the allegation , Nebiolo declined to comment . Times staff writer Elliott Almond contributed to this report .</TEXT>
