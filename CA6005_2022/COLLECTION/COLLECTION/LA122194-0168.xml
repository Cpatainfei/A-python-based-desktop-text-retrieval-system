   <HEADLINE> CHECHENS FORM HUMAN CHAIN TO DEFY RUSSIA ; CAUCASUS : TENS OF THOUSANDS LINE HIGHWAY FOR 40 MILES . BOMBS FALL NEAR STREETCAR STATION IN CENTER OF CAPITAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a striking show of mass defiance , at least 100 # 000 Chechens lined their last unoccupied highway Tuesday to call_for peace as Russian troops stepped_up land and air_attacks on their tiny breakaway republic . Top Chechen officials moved from the nine-story presidential palace here to an underground shelter after two bombs exploded nearby Monday night in the first major air assault on the city_center . Frigid wind whistled through President Dzhokar M . Dudayev ' s empty office , and snow dusted the windowsills . Tearful homeowners picked through the rubble of their possessions in a residential neighborhood near Grozny ' s central streetcar station where the two bombs hit . &quot; That used to be my house , &quot; said clockmaker Ruslan Ismailov , pointing at the partial husk of a structure . &quot; we ' ll deal with those Russian pigs ! &quot; Two people were confirmed dead Tuesday morning in three overnight air_raids on this oil-refining center . But the bombs and the constant thumping of prolonged battle in the northern suburb of Petropavlovskaya heightened tension among the estimated 200 # 000 people still in Grozny . As the Kremlin promised &quot; decisive offensive actions &quot; to press Dudayev into renouncing his oil-rich republic ' s claim to independence , fully a tenth of Chechnya ' s mostly Muslim population took_to its main highway in protest . Men and women , infants and old people walled the 40-mile stretch of the Moscow-Baku highway from the eastern outskirts of Grozny to the Dagestan border . Many carried hand-lettered signs demanding &quot; Freedom for Chechnya &quot; and &quot; Yeltsin ! Stop the War ! &quot; At prayer time , many in the crowd laid lambskin coats on the fresh snow and knelt on the curly wool , facing Mecca . &quot; We want freedom and independence , &quot; said Makhmadselakh Bechiev , a driver who had been standing_in the wet snow for two hours . &quot; If we have to , we ' ll stand forever , until there ' s peace. &quot; Andi Natsulkhanov , a 62-year-old farmer , said villagers had turned_out in such numbers because &quot; all_of the Chechen population wants to live its own life. &quot; &quot; No Chechen , &quot; he said , &quot; wants all our issues here to be solved by bombing and killing and the destruction of all that was built. &quot; The great line of people had many gaps along the road but swelled into huddled crowds near towns and spilled into Dagestan , a Russian republic , where thousands joined the protesters in solidarity . Organizers had billed the lineup as a march of peace meant to involve the entire North Caucasus . Politicians have warned that Russia ' s military moves_in Chechnya could explode into a new Caucasus war , a modern twist on the conflict that dragged_on for decades in the mid-19th Century , when czarist Russia tried to force the mountain region into its empire . Twenty-seven Russian soldiers have been reported killed since President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s government sent 10 # 000 or more troops into Chechnya on Dec . 11 . Chechen fighters shot_down a Russian helicopter Tuesday in the battle for Petropavlovskaya , killing two military doctors and a crewman . Nobody had bothered to count Chechen casualties until Sergei Kovalyov , Yeltsin ' s human_rights commissioner , reported Tuesday having personally seen the bodies of 42 civilians killed in fighting outside Grozny and bombing raids inside . &quot; The scale of human_rights violations by the Russian troops in Chechnya is such_that the conflict has ceased to be just an internal affair of Russia , &quot; said Kovalyov , who opposed the offensive from the start . His comments echoed protests and calls_for peace talks by Turkey , Iran , Jordan and other governments . In the wind-swept presidential palace , Dudayev adviser Abdullah Dadayev said the Chechen conflict is more likely to become a rerun of the Afghanistan war that bogged down and humiliated the Soviet army in the 1980s . &quot; This will be a drawn-out war , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' ve prepared a long_time for it , and it will be another Afghanistan , whether we want it to be or not. &quot; Tuesday ' s Kremlin statement made_it clear that the attacks are aimed in part at destroying the Chechens ' store of war materiel . Fifteen pieces of &quot; combat hardware &quot; and 10 artillery guns were destroyed in the last 24 hours , the statement said . The main combat Tuesday was focused in Petropavlovskaya , which was reported Monday to have been overrun by the advancing Russians . But Musa Mirzhuyev , Dudayev ' s liaison with his fighters , said Tuesday that Chechen forces in the suburb were holding_back Russian tanks and artillery guns with grenades and machine_guns . &quot; we ' ll beat them back , &quot; Mirzhuyev vowed . He said he still expected the Russian troops to try to storm Grozny . Despite the accelerated bombing and shelling of Grozny and its outskirts , Moscow appeared to be holding_back , possibly hoping to persuade Dudayev to agree to disarm his fighters -- the one concession demanded by Russia for a resumption of peace talks . Neighbors of the destroyed houses near Grozny ' s streetcar station said a bomb crater left in an intersection indicated that the Russian planes were dropping one-ton bombs . The crater measured about 20 feet across and 10 feet deep -- a devastating hit but far short of what the former Soviet air_force could do if it attacked full force .
