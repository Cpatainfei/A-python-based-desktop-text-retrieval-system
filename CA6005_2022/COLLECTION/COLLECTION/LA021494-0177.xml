   <TEXT> &quot; If the plaintiff is a woman and has those qualities which other women envy -- good looks , a handsome husband , wealth , social position -- then women jurors would be unwise . Women ' s inhumanity to women is unequaled . They are the severest judges of_their_own sex . &quot; -- Melvin M . Belli Sr. , 1982 &quot; I don ' t like women jurors because I can ' t trust them . They do , however , make the best jurors in cases involving crimes against children . It is possible that their ' women ' s intuition ' can help you if you can ' t win your case with the facts . &quot; -- From a 1970s jury selection manual for Dallas prosecutors &quot; Mostly it is astonishing how few gender differences you can find on most questions. &quot; -- University of Chicago law professor Albert Alschuler , 1994 Before the Menendez trial even started , lawyers in the case assumed that female jurors would be good for the defense , men for the prosecution . More_than six months later , the Erik and Lyle Menendez juries were deadlocked , torn between the prosecution ' s argument that the brothers murdered their parents out of hatred and greed and the defense ' s contention that they feared for their lives after years of abuse by their father . The outcome has set_off a tantalizing debate over a question that jury experts have grappled with for years : Does gender play a role in jury decisions ? Some close observers of the sensational trial argue that it most surely did . Totaling the votes from both panels shows a majority of men for murder_convictions and of women for leniency . On Erik Menendez ' s jury , the gender split could not have been more pronounced in the killing of his father , Jose . Deliberations churned_up a bitter battle of the sexes , with the six men pressing for first- or second-degree murder and the six women lined_up solidly for lesser charges . But such gender divisions are rare on juries , experts say . And , in fact , it did not happen that way on Lyle ' s panel : Women were slightly harsher than the men . Contrary to the widely held views of attorneys , studies have found that the gender of jurors does not shape most verdicts . Although jurors of one gender may be responsible_for a certain case ' s outcome , research shows statistical differences between male and female jurors only in sexual_assault trials . Sexual assault did figure in the Menendez case , where both brothers claimed that their father raped and molested them . But unlike Lyle Menendez , who said his father abused him for two years as a child , Erik Menendez testified that he was molested until the time of the killings . He , therefore , may have been perceived as having suffered more_than his brother . &quot; Women might have been more likely to believe_in the possibility of long-term sexual abuse than men , &quot; said Valerie Hans , a University of Delaware criminal justice and psychology professor and co-author of &quot; Judging the Jury. &quot; Experts said the gender polarization on Erik Menendez ' s jury also may have been triggered by hostility that developed during deliberations , prompting female and male jurors to unite by sex . Women may be more likely than men to believe testimony by children , ongoing research suggests , but it is not clear whether that difference holds_up after deliberations . More women than men also oppose the death_penalty . &quot; The research suggests that gender typically doesn ' t make much of a difference ( in verdicts ) except in cases that involve real women ' s issues , like rape , where women are more punitive than men are , &quot; said Phoebe Ellsworth , a University of Michigan professor . Whatever the reason , the Menendez case only reinforced what many lawyers have long believed : Women , particularly mothers , tend to be more sympathetic to certain kinds of defendants . &quot; If you have a death_penalty case , &quot; said prominent Los Angeles criminal defense_attorney Johnnie Cochran , &quot; you want a mother on the jury or someone who understands about raising children. &quot; Even more_than gender attitudes , the different jury votes may have reflected the different styles and personalities of the two defense_attorneys , Cochran said . He speculated that some of the men on Erik Menendez ' s jury &quot; may have felt threatened &quot; by defense_attorney Leslie Abramson , while the women may have been captivated by her &quot; dominating presence &quot; in court . He said her maternal gestures , such_as picking lint off Erik ' s shoulders , may have particularly struck_a_chord with the women . Jill Lansing , Lyle Menendez ' s attorney , was &quot; a bit more low key , not as dominating in the courtroom , &quot; Cochran said . But all sorts of factors can shape jury decisions . Juries often bend the law when they believe the outcome would be unjust , a factor cited by experts to explain the recent acquittal of Lorena Bobbitt and the verdicts in the Reginald O . Denny beating case . During Prohibition , juries rarely convicted bootleggers . Before the Civil War , Northern juries almost never convicted people charged with helping slaves escape . In 18th-Century England , juries refused to convict people in capital cases because they found the death_penalty too extreme . Today , abuse defenses resonate as realistic in what one legal_expert called our &quot; Oprah Winfrey society , &quot; accustomed to tales of dysfunctional families and famous people distraught because of childhood abuse . A male juror admitted that he believed Lyle Menendez was legally guilty of first-degree murder but voted for second-degree because he felt &quot; pity &quot; for him after hearing his claims of abuse . &quot; The physical abuse was so severe , I didn ' t want to convict him on first-degree murder , &quot; said the juror , who asked not to be identified . Although women today are considered more sympathetic to sexual_assault victims , lawyers widely assumed 15 years ago that women tended to blame the victim in rape cases . Some research back then suggested that women needed to distance themselves from the victim so they could convince themselves &quot; This could not happen to me. &quot; Jury experts also have learned over the years that geography can affect views of people of the same gender . Pretrial polls taken_in the early 1970s showed that women in Pennsylvania were more sympathetic than men to defendants in anti-war cases . But similar polls in Florida found women were harsher . &quot; The best guess that we have , &quot; said Neil Vidmar , a Duke University law professor and jury consultant , &quot; is that at least at that time , Southern women were much more traditional and deferential to authority. &quot; Even in abuse cases , predicting female jurors ' attitudes can be tricky . When a woman goes_on trial for killing an abusive husband , women who have been battered themselves may_not support the defendant because they never resorted_to killing , said Lois Heaney , a trial consultant for the Menendez defense . In her view , it is important to assess how jurors who suffered abuse dealt with it , including whether they sought psychological counseling . &quot; In some ways , &quot; Heaney said , &quot; the dangerous person is the person who says ' I was abused , but I am fine. ' . . . People tend to judge people like themselves more harshly. &quot; Some of the best jurors for battered women charged with murder have been men , she said . They tend to want to distance themselves from the cruelty committed by the husband and may feel protective toward the defendant . Nevertheless , lawyers pick jurors according to stereotypes all_the time . Most of their prejudices are based on how such people voted on previous juries . Irish-Americans have been thought to be good for the defense because they are considered emotional and likely to get_in trouble with the law , whereas Protestants have been seen as strict and judgmental . Women have been viewed_as sympathetic to the defense , men as more rule-bound . San Francisco criminal defense_attorney Gil Eisenberg said he follows his own generalizations when picking jurors : Women in their early 20s are categorical , judgmental and rigid ; middle-aged men are flexible , and Asians submit to authority . But he said he has found exceptions to all_of these rules . &quot; I pay_attention to them , &quot; he said , &quot; but I am not rigid about it. &quot; Gerard Lynch , a former prosecutor and now a professor of law at Columbia University , recalled that a fellow prosecutor many years ago advised him never to seat a juror who wore sunglasses indoors . Such behavior , the prosecutor opined , meant the person was probably a nonconformist who wanted to cultivate a &quot; hip &quot; image . Prosecutors also were wary of people who seemed stubborn , fearing a hung jury . But Lynch now would heed such admonitions no more_than he would the daily astrology column . Often the particular rapport an attorney may sense with a prospective juror is more important than anything else about that juror , he said . Lynch recalled trying a case in which an older_woman , a prospective juror , gazed at him in a way he felt was maternal . &quot; She just had this fond gaze so I figured this is somebody who is going_to be good for me , regardless of her political views or gender . And it turned_out the instinct was right. &quot; He later discovered that the juror had a son who was a professional about his age . The U.S. Supreme Court has held that prospective jurors cannot be eliminated because of race alone and will soon decide whether they can be eliminated because of gender . In the case before the high_court , the prosecution eliminated men from a jury deciding a paternity case . Lower courts have frowned_on gender-based disqualifications . The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in October reversed the conviction of a man convicted of passing counterfeit securities because the prosecutor disqualified two unmarried_women from the Los Angeles jury . The prosecutor had argued that the women would be physically attracted to the handsome defendant . The influence of women on juries has not been widely researched . In fact , women have been_on juries in significant numbers nationwide only since the late 1960s , said Stanford_University law professor Barbara Babcock , who has written extensively about juries . Even after women got the vote , she said , some states continued to ban them from juries . In later decades , women were routinely excused from jury duty because of child-rearing responsibilities . In studying 20 mock juries in 1979 and 1980 , Ellsworth , the University of Michigan researcher , found male jurors still did most of the talking . The men were more likely to be elected foreman , and they interrupted women more often . In the 20 juries , only one elected a forewoman . &quot; I also found that a woman will say something and there won ' t be any real response to it , &quot; Ellsworth said . &quot; And sometimes in the next five minutes , a man will say the same thing , and people will say : ' that ' s a good idea . We can get somewhere with that. ' &quot; Research shows that men and women are equally good at recalling evidence and understanding points of law . Bette L . Bottoms , an assistant psychology professor at the University of Illinois in Chicago , is using mock juries to study how male and female jurors respond differently to alleged crimes against children . So far , she has found that women tend to believe children more readily because they can more easily &quot; take the place of a child &quot; and empathize with_children . But the differences are slight and may_not hold_up after deliberations , a point she is still testing . In general , juries tend to be more lenient once they start deliberating because they begin to fret about &quot; reasonable doubt , &quot; she said . In the Erik Menendez case , the male and female jurors were divided on their first ballot . &quot; We were all_in shock &quot; about the gender split , said juror Wendy B . Delahunt , 51 . The deliberations eventually became &quot; nasty and ugly. &quot; One female juror accused the men of being uncomfortable with strong women , and the men referred to the women as &quot; you women , &quot; according to Delahunt . Deputy district_attorney Lester Kuriyama , echoing several experts , said the tensions may have polarized the two camps by gender . Looking_at the vote count_on both juries , he said female jurors are not necessarily detrimental to the prosecution . &quot; I don ' t think you can say we don ' t want women on the juries &quot; during the retrials . Male jurors thought Erik Menendez was gay , which the prosecution had suggested during the trial , and therefore knew how to describe in detail the sex he said his father forced on him , Delahunt said . The male jurors also surmised that Erik Menendez ' s father learned of his homosexuality and threatened to cut him off financially , providing a motive for murder . But Delahunt had her own reasons for wanting leniency . The single mother said she was moved by the apparent support the defendants received from their grandmother , the mother of the man they killed , as well as by the emotional testimony of Lyle Menendez . Jury experts said jurors , regardless of gender , often have difficulty deciding cases in which murder victims are portrayed as being as immoral as the defendants . Many said they were not surprised by the hung juries in the Menendez case and refused to draw generalizations about gender from them . Said Lynch : &quot; If you were going_to bet money on the outcome of trials based on whether the jury had eight men on it or four men on it , you would lose your shirt. &quot; Divided Juries Here is how the jury counts in the Lyle and Erik Menendez cases broke_down by gender : LYLE MENENDEZ JURY * Killing of Jose Menendez First-degree murder : 2 women , 1 man Second-degree murder : 2 women , 1 man Manslaughter : 3 men , 3 women * Killing of Kitty Menendez First-degree murder : 2 women , 1 man Second-degree murder : 2 women , 1 man Voluntary manslaughter : 2 women , 3 men Involuntary manslaughter : 1 woman ERIK MENENDEZ JURY * Killing of Jose Menendez : First-degree murder : 5 men Second-degree murder : 1 man Manslaughter : 6 women * Killing of Kitty Menendez : First-degree murder : 5 men Second-degree murder : 1 man , 2 women Manslaughter : 4 women BACKGROUND The six-month Menendez brothers ' trial ended Jan . 28 with both juries deadlocked . Lyle and Erik Menendez -- now 26 and 23 , respectively -- were arrested several months after the 1989 shotgun slayings of their wealthy parents at the family ' s Beverly Hills estate . Prosecutors said they killed out of hatred and greed , citing their lavish spending on cars , jewelry and tennis_lessons . But the trial was dominated by a bold defense that insisted the brothers killed in fear after years of sexual and mental abuse . Van Nuys Superior_Court Judge Stanley M . Weisberg has scheduled a Feb . 28 hearing to set a new trial date . The brothers remain in custody without bail .</TEXT>
