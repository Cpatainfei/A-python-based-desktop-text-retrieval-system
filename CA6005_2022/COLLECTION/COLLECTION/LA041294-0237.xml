   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; HONG KONG ' S NEW BUSINESS DYNASTIES ; THE GREAT BRITISH TRADING HOUSES RUSH TO HIRE MORE CHINESE EXECUTIVES , SHED THEIR COLONIAL VENEER BEFORE BEIJING TAKES_OVER IN ' 97 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ceremonial changing of the guard took_place high above Hong Kong Harbor , in one of the glass-enclosed aeries reserved for the colony ' s business elite . Simon Murray , a feisty Scotsman in the long tradition of British colonial traders here , reluctantly handed_over his job last fall as managing director of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. , the venerable British merchant trading house , to Canning Fok , a low-profile Chinese accountant from Hong Kong . The switch_on the 22nd floor of Hutchison House ended a boardroom debate about the company ' s direction and signaled a scramble among Hutchison and powerful companies like it to shed their British veneer before China takes_over in three years . Since 1979 , Hutchison , founded by a colonial class that once banned Chinese from its country_clubs , had been controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing . Li , known for his solid business ties with the Communist leadership in Beijing , wanted Hutchison to concentrate_on its trade with mainland_China . Murray , although bullish on China , pushed to maintain the company ' s business connections with the West through investments in Britain and Canada . Murray also presented another problem : He supported the democratic reforms proposed for Hong Kong by British colonial Gov . Chris Patten , the bane of the Beijing regime . When the dust settled , Murray was out . For the first time in its history , Hutchison was to be managed by a Chinese executive . Unequivocally , the main business of Hutchison would be China . There would be no more question of supporting Patten ' s reforms . In terms of Hong Kong history , it was a moment almost as significant as the day more_than 150 years earlier when Capt . Charles Elliot of the Royal Navy convinced the_British Empire that the rocky island might be a good place to set_up business . As the Hong Kong newspapers noted with varying degrees of celebration and alarm , usually depending_on the language in which the article was written , Simon Murray was one of the last British &quot; taipans. &quot; For more_than a century , the Hong Kong financial world has been dominated by a handful of British trading houses . These are the &quot; hongs &quot; made famous in recent years through the best-selling James Clavell novels &quot; Taipan &quot; and &quot; Noble House. &quot; But with Hong Kong set to revert to mainland_China in 1997 , the days of the_British taipan and the colonial-style hong are coming_to an end . At one time the business of the hongs -- the name comes from yang hong , meaning &quot; foreign company &quot; -- was tea and opium . Today it is telecommunications and fleets of jetliners . One of the hongs manages the Coca-Cola franchises on the mainland . Another is planning a huge new container port on China ' s Yangtze_River that it claims will create a Chicago-style hub on the Communist mainland . Another operates a chain of luxury hotels . Together , the four largest hongs -- Jardine Matheson , the Swire Group , Hutchison Whampoa and Wheelock-Marden -- have assets of more_than $ 17.5 billion . All are busy buying and selling real_estate on both sides of the Bamboo_Curtain . Historically , the boardrooms and executive offices of the biggest hongs were the exclusive domain of the_British taipans who commanded enormous power and staggering wealth . The world of the taipan was one of turbaned Sikh doormen , chauffeur-driven Bentleys and luxurious , mahogany-paneled cabins on company-owned cargo_ships plying the South_China_Sea . As an unquestioned right befitting his position , the taipan enjoyed the best boxes at the Happy Valley racecourse and the best tables at the once whites-only Hong Kong Club , described by a government officer in the mid-19th Century as &quot; the paradise of the select and temple of colonial gentility. &quot; Making the hongs , the very symbol of Victorian colonial expansionism , acceptable to the Communist landlords of this jewel in the South_China_Sea is one of the most compelling business stories of this decade . &quot; If you have someone who is your boss today and someone who is going_to be your boss tomorrow and they tell you to do two different things , which one do you obey ? &quot; Clive Weedon , head of research at the Nomura Research Institute of Hong Kong , asked rhetorically in a recent interview . This is the question that looms over all_of Hong Kong , from the political corridors of the Legislative_Council to the locker_rooms of the Hong Kong Police_Department , as the 1997 deadline approaches . The name of the game is positioning , with companies and institutions scrambling for strategic redoubts to prepare_for the changeover . About the same time that the Murray-Fok switch was taking_place at Hutchison , for example , the Swire Group announced the promotion of two Hong Kong Chinese executives to top positions at its Cathay Pacific Airways and Dragonair subsidiaries , replacing two British executives . One of the new management ' s first acts was ordering British flags removed from the tails of Cathay Pacific airliners . Other hongs , such_as the die-hard Jardine Matheson , are busy severing their ties with the colony . Jardine , once the most powerful of the &quot; princely hongs &quot; and widely considered to have been the model for Clavell ' s &quot; Noble House , &quot; took another important step_in its decade-long retreat from Hong Kong last month when it withdrew its stock from trading on the Hong Kong Stock_Exchange . Jardine had moved its corporate registration from Hong Kong to Bermuda in 1984 , after the_British government and Chinese Communists agreed on the 1997 takeover . After the Bermuda switch , the company then began shifting many of its investments to Singapore and Europe . Today , Jardine ' s upper management remains resolutely and unapologetically British . Unlike the other hongs , Jardine made little attempt to make_peace with the Chinese government . Its British executives , for example , were alone among hong officials in condemning the violent government crackdown on the 1989 democracy movement demonstrators in Tian An Men Square . They strongly support democratic reform proposals pushed by the_British government in its waning days as the political sovereign here . Jardine ' s pullout from the stock_exchange was a chilling reminder that the old ways of doing business in Hong Kong are over . The announcement drew the instant wrath of the Chinese government . Zheng Guoxiong , deputy director of China ' s official New China News_Agency in Hong Kong , described the Jardine action as &quot; very irresponsible. &quot; Without saying so directly , the Chinese official accused Jardine , which amassed a fortune under British rule , of jumping ship as the takeover approached . &quot; Between now and 1997 and beyond , &quot; Zheng said , &quot; it will take our concerted efforts to maintain Hong Kong ' s status as an international financial_center . We don ' t want to see companies failing to take_into_account Hong Kong economic development and Hong Kong people ' s interests by taking irresponsible action. &quot; In fact , the South China Morning Post newspaper in Hong Kong reported late last month , Jardine executives were secretly worried that the mainland Chinese antipathy toward their company would result in a stock buyout attempt by Chinese-backed companies on the Hong Kong exchange . Except for Jardine , the other hongs have all tried to make_peace with their new masters by converting their British businesses to Chinese standards . Many argue that this is long overdue . After all , 98 % of the population here is ethnic Chinese . At the same time the hongs were announcing their historic changes , Patten , probably the last colonial governor , named for the first time a Chinese civil_servant , Anson Chan , as chief_secretary , the highest bureaucratic post in the Hong Kong government . Simon Murray was philosophical about the changes in an interview with Newsweek just after he was removed from the leadership of Hutchison . &quot; Hong Kong is moving rapidly toward China , &quot; he said , &quot; and you ' ve got_to have Chinese guys on the block if you want to play that game. &quot; John Hung , the portly , chain-smoking executive_director of Wheelock , is a child of the old British hongs who is supervising the conversion of one of them into a Chinese institution . Hung ' s great-uncle and his father were both &quot; compradors , &quot; the Portuguese term adapted by the hongs to describe the senior Chinese officials who acted_as middlemen between the_British colonialists and their Chinese staffs and business contacts . The two essential positions in the hong were the taipan , or boss , and the comprador . &quot; These compradors -- and I know firsthand -- were in fact chief procurement officer of personnel , &quot; Hung recalled in an interview at Wheelock House in central Hong Kong . &quot; They paid them direct . They got a big sum_of_money from the company , and they paid these fellas . &quot; They were the guarantors of the receivables , they were the underwriters against loss claims -- they didn ' t have insurance_companies . They were the chief interpreters . They were the chief marketing and sales people . They did everything . They were the conduit between East and West . And without them , there would have been no success. &quot; To Mao Tse-tung and other Communist revolutionaries , the compradors were the personification of imperial evil , fellow Chinese willing to sell_out their race to the hated foreign powers . Even in the hongs , the comprador class began to disappear in the 1970s as the conversion to Chinese ownership began . Today , surprisingly , Hung and Wheelock Chairman Peter Woo have revived the term to describe their own company -- now a &quot; Chinese hong &quot; -- and the role it will play when the People ' s Republic_of_China assumes control of Hong Kong . Hung continued : &quot; We look_at ourselves at Wheelock as an entrepreneurial merchant house acting_as a comprador with China . There are thousands , hundreds of great Western companies with tremendous products that would die to get_into China . But they don ' t know how . Even if they did know how , it would take them 10 years . The perfect situation is for them to join hands with a company that understands East and West. &quot; As Jardine withdraws from its Hong Kong base , Wheelock and Hutchison are considered the two &quot; Chinese hongs. &quot; As for the taipans , they are seen as useless appendages in an Asia for Asians . &quot; The British families may well want to see China succeed , &quot; said one business analyst here , a former journalist with 25 years ' experience working in Hong Kong , &quot; but they probably don ' t have a lot of confidence that China wants to see them succeed . History is not really on their side. &quot; With Jardine in retreat , the last of the British-owned hongs with a significant stake still in Hong Kong is likely to be the London-based Swire Group . Unlike Jardine , Swire is naming Chinese executives for many senior positions while entering into ventures with powerful Communist state enterprises on the mainland . Linus Cheung , 46 , a Hong Kong Chinese named to head the commercial division of Swire-owned Cathay Pacific Airways , dismissed in an interview the significance of the rush to appoint Chinese to senior positions . &quot; But for_sure , with 1997 and with the changes that are occurring , &quot; Cheung said , &quot; I think Chinese who have the right experience and competence would have improved career opportunities compared to before . . . . It is this East meeting the West. &quot; Clive Weedon , the Nomura Research Institute head , agreed . &quot; There was a time , &quot; he recalled without any nostalgia , &quot; when it was probably very important to have a white face and to speak the Queen ' s English to get_on in Hong Kong . Those days have now departed , and it has become increasingly important that one is able to speak Cantonese and Mandarin ( dialects of Chinese ) if one wants to function at a senior level in this town. &quot; Tempest is a Times staff writer , and Courtney is a special correspondent .</TEXT>
