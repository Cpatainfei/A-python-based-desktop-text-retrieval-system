   <TEXT> It will go_down_on U.S. World Cup Coach Bora Milutinovic ' s ever-growing list of &quot; Things I Wish I Hadn ' t Said. &quot; He was speaking in an optimistic burst before the U.S. team ' s first game of 1993 in Tempe , Ariz. , when the slate was clean and the World Cup was a distant speck on the competitive horizon . The opponent was Denmark , tiny Denmark , which had shocked the soccer world and won the European Championships . No doubt seeking to be generous to the Danish coach sitting next to him , Milutinovic declared his goal for the U.S. team : &quot; We want to be the Denmark of the World Cup. &quot; Denmark -- which won the European Championships with a stylistically unappealing defensive game -- bombed_out of World Cup qualifying . Is this the metaphor Milutinovic wants for the U.S. team ? Doubtful , but he might have been hoping to capture that aura of the lightly regarded underdog and capitalize on the camouflage of low expectations . It has worked . The team is draped in a shroud of questions and doubts , which even its recent upset over Mexico has failed to lift . The crafty Milutinovic would n ' t have welcomed the poor showings by the U.S. team as a way to sneak into the tournament unnoticed , would he ? He would n ' t have arranged to show the team ' s Group_A opponents only the weak aspect of the U.S. World Cup team ' s abilities ? that ' s a reach , even for Milutinovic ' s constant scheming . The other explanation is the players have done their best and sometimes they play with surprising skill and other times they are painful to watch . The U.S. national team compiled a 5-5-8 record this year and went 2-2-7 against World Cup qualified teams . Much has been made of the players who play abroad and their miraculous healing powers on the team . After a particularly galling loss , the coaching staff could be counted_on to point_out the missing players . For a time , Milutinovic even took_to keeping separate records -- with and without the Europeans . The dozen or so players had obvious skill -- by definition , if they were playing professionally outside the United States they were among the best the country has to offer . When the_likes_of John Harkes , Eric Wynalda , Tab Ramos and Roy Wegerle have been with the team , their fortunes have risen . But how to judge ? Since the 1990 World Cup in Italy , the U.S. team has had all its final players nine times . The team has gone an impressive 7-1-1 in those games . U.S. Soccer Federation President Alan Rothenberg : &quot; When we have our full squad together and they play in the United States against top-level competition , we are a competitive team. &quot; Too often , however , the specter of the foreign-based players has been a divisive factor on the team . Players in Mission Viejo either didn ' t pursue offers from professional teams or elected not to try their luck in Europe and then had sit at_home and hear about what a second-rate bunch they were . At one point this spring , there was a change in Mission Viejo . Milutinovic began to speak less of the foreign-based players and attempted , in his confusing way , to boost the morale of his team at_hand . Too late or too_little ? It ' s difficult to judge what months of put-downs had done to the team and how much the players believed of_their_own ineptitude . DEFENSE , DEFENSE ? U.S. assistant coach Timo Liekoski has his &quot; I Wish I Hadn ' t Said That When I Said It &quot; list , too . At an informal gathering of reporters before the Joe Robbie Cup in Miami in February , Liekoski did what Milutinovic almost never does -- he spoke candidly about the players , analyzing their strengths and weaknesses . The session was hardly controversial . . . at the time . On the day before the first game , Liekoski spoke in glowing terms about the defense and its cohesiveness and how the players had benefited from playing together for so_long . Unlike the U.S. midfielders and forwards , only one defender -- Cle Kooiman , who plays professionally in Mexico -- was missing from the training camp that opened in January , 1993 . How could Liekoski have known the defense would fall_apart the next day against Bolivia ? The problem in the 1-1 tie was lack of communication . As Liekoski pointed_out later , the team lacked a player in the back who would verbally organize the defense and motivate his teammates . The goalkeeper and sweeper , by virtue of their positions on the field , usually fill the role . Tony Meola , when he is in goal , is not a quiet guy and has no problem calling_out positioning tips to his teammates in front of him . The sweeper is another issue and might have been the key to the hellish weekend , which concluded with a 3-1 loss to Sweden . With Marcelo Balboa at sweeper , the U.S. team had a take-charge player . When Balboa went_out with a serious knee injury , the team got used to Desmond Armstrong , also a capable , steady player whose tendency is not to be vocal on the field . &quot; We lack the one guy who is going_to grab the guys by the neck and say , ' Let ' s get going , ' &quot; Liekoski said . &quot; If you listen carefully when we play , there ' s not a lot of chatter. &quot; The one guy who has earned the right to run things is Thomas Dooley , a veteran of the German Bundesliga . Dooley ' s most natural position is at sweeper , but it is not natural for him to bark orders . He ' s the sort of leader whose barest whisper would send players off to follow him , but he ' s only now getting comfortable asserting himself . Without an adequate communications_system , the U.S. players were running_around the field with no apparent plan . Since soccer is a game of action and reaction , if one outside back made a run upfield , for example , his opposite_number would usually remain behind to cover . In Miami , Alexi Lalas was making pell-mell rushes , leaving the back open and men unmarked . He was not alone in being out of position , but even one player ' s missed assignment can impact each of his teammates . The U.S. defense wasn ' t the only thing that unraveled in Miami . Milutinovic had spent months attempting to introduce and sell his build-from-the-back system to a reluctant team whose players each had their own ideas about style . The weekend degenerated into a mini-revolt -- &quot; We don ' t like the flat back four defensive formation , so we ' ll show the coaches how badly it works. &quot; The reasoning had some merit to it , but it proved fatal to players who were being judged on their execution of the coach ' s game_plan , not their own . There should be no mistaking the hierarchy of Milutinovic ' s team -- he ' s the boss and , while everyone is welcome to offer suggestions , Bora is comfortable disregarding them . The players ' attempt to usurp Milutinovic ' s authority was met with an iron fist that carried an unmistakable message : Bora might not always be right , but he ' s always the coach . WHICH TEAM WILL PLAY ? The maddening aspect of monitoring the U.S. team has been its inconsistency . The team that lost to Iceland and Chile also beat England and Ireland . The ups and downs are a natural outgrowth of Milutinovic ' s constant experimentation : The U.S. coach spent much of the last year plugging_in players to positions like so many puzzle pieces . The sheer volume of players brought into camp -- &quot; for a look , &quot; as the coaches called it -- was a factor_in the confusion . Forty-five players were used at one time or another , and at times the notion of the U.S. team ever creating a chemistry was remote . The occasional recall of European players also added_to the ebb and flow of the team ' s fortunes . But mostly , it could be attributable to either the players ' own maturation or some tinkering by Milutinovic . Joe-Max Moore scored four goals against El_Salvador while playing_at center-forward , a position he rarely played . Elsewhere , players with some versatility were moved_around the field , barely lingering long enough to grow comfortable with one position . The most recent new wrinkle was the addition of the five-man back formation for some games in May . Milutinovic was criticized for adding such a significant change so late . In fact , the U.S. team had played a five-man back before and will likely use such a configuration against Colombia in the World Cup . The team is expected to come_out with four defenders against Switzerland . Romania remains a puzzle . The two goalkeepers were trapped inside a revolving-door rotation . Starting every_other game could hardly have helped Meola or Brad Friedel find an edge or any rhythm , even while it gave the coaching staff a chance to evaluate their play . Additionally , the keepers got a position coach only 11 months ago . All of which has been part of Milutinovic ' s plan . Presumably . Now coaching in his third_World Cup , Milutinovic makes decisions that are at times baffling but often become clear later . For example , there was his handling of midfielder Claudio Reyna . Reyna came_to camp as a highly decorated college player whom some called the future of American soccer . Milutinovic ' s response to the young player was to ignore him and give him scant playing time . This was inexplicable to outside observers who , along with everyone who saw Reyna play , recognized his creative field vision and ball-control ability . But in the first few months , any discussion of Reyna was likely to evoke a wave of hand from Milutinovic . Was it possible that he saw some major flaw in Reyna ? Or was Milutinovic reacting as he usually does when told by others to do something ? Milutinovic ' s reasoning , like so many other things , was revealed at the Joe Robbie tournament in Miami . During a wide-ranging discussion with reporters at the team ' s hotel , Milutinovic grew visibly impatient with constant questions about Reyna and his lack of playing time . Milutinovic abruptly left the room and returned with a bewildered Reyna in tow . The coach ceremoniously placed Reyna in the middle of a circle of reporters and introduced him to each . He then turned_to Reyna and said , &quot; How old are you ? &quot; Reyna replied , &quot; I ' m 20. &quot; Milutinovic asked , &quot; Do you think you are playing enough ? &quot; Reyna , having no idea where this was going but certain there was a right answer , said , &quot; You ' re the coach Bora. &quot; With that , he was sent from the room . Milutinovic thinks American players lack the proper respect and veneration for the World Cup . The competition to make a World Cup team in the United States is nothing like in Italy . Milutinovic well knew what he had in Reyna and had every intention of using him liberally . But he wanted to make_sure the young player -- for whom soccer had been nothing but rewards and accolades -- did not get the impression that playing in the World Cup was his birthright . What at first looked_like clumsy handling of a promising player showed itself to be a deft move calculated to season Reyna and knock some of the attitude out of him . Bringing him along slowly surely helped Reyna and the team . Milutinovic knew that Reyna , had he played , might have been able to set_up more goals and the U.S. team might have won a_few more games , but he has always been willing to sacrifice short-term gain for long-term benefit . Translation : Bora knows what he ' s doing . The tendency of American sports fans is to judge based on statistical information . By this measure , Milutinovic would be a failure . Hank Steinbrecher , secretary_general of the U.S. Soccer Federation , has admitted as much . But , he notes , the World Cup record is all that matters . By that standard , an assessment of the U.S. team strictly on the basis of its record in international friendlies leading_up to the World Cup has no meaning . Or , taken another way , each game has to be gauged in reference_to what it means relative to the World Cup . &quot; Bora always has his eye on the big picture , the World Cup , &quot; U.S. assistant coach Steve Sampson said . Milutinovic ' s Costa Rica team in 1990 lost seven consecutive games before the World Cup and shocked everyone by reaching the second round . The U.S. team has at least apparently peaked at the right moment . Its 1-0 victory against Mexico sent all_the right messages to the team regarding its preparation . The game was played before 91 # 123 pro-Mexico fans at the Rose Bowl and the team showed a single-mindedness that has flashed before but rarely shone . That game offered some indication of what ' s possible . But those signs have been sighted before . &quot; When you can beat a team like Mexico under adverse conditions , I can only assume we will be even better in Detroit when we will have everybody ' s support , &quot; Milutinovic said . &quot; If we put forth the kind of effort we did today , if someone beats us , they will have truly proved themselves. &quot; What does that mean ? As Milutinovic would say , it means nothing . Only World Cup games matter , and if the United States can ' t win in the World Cup and advance past the first round , no invocation of upsets over England or Mexico or the Gold Cup title will mean anything .</TEXT>
