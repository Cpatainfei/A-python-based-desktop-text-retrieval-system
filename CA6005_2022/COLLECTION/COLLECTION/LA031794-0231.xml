   <HEADLINE> JOB-SKILLS PROGRAM IS WORKING FOR HIM , AND VICE VERSA ; EMPLOYMENT : ONE-YEAR STINT IN CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS TURNED HIGH_SCHOOL DROPOUT ' S LIFE AROUND , HE TELLS GROUP OF YOUNG ADULTS AT RECRUITMENT SEMINAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A year ago , Edgar Sanchez says , he was a gang-banging , drug-using high_school dropout . That was when he decided to apply for the California Conservation Corps , a statewide yearlong program that teaches 18- to 23-year-olds home fix-up skills that they can use later to repair dilapidated housing in their community . On Wednesday , dressed in a brown khaki uniform and black steel-toed boots , Sanchez told a group of young adults attending a CCC recruitment seminar how the program taught him valuable job skills and put him on the threshold of earning his General Equivalency Degree . &quot; I was_sick and tired_of running the streets , I wanted to make a change , &quot; he told the group . &quot; Because you are here today means you also want to make a change. &quot; The seminar was held at Santa Ana ' s Southwest Senior Center and was part of an effort to get young adults from crime-troubled neighborhoods into programs that teach them job skills . The meeting drew 14 applicants , most of whom said they had not finished high_school and were looking_for work . For Jerson Tobar , 18 , the chance to earn a GED and work regularly drew him to the seminar . &quot; I worked as a painter , but there was never enough work , &quot; he said . &quot; When I heard about this , I had to come_down and see what it was about . I would like to work for the gas company. &quot; Recently , CCC recruiters , including Sanchez , visited a neighborhood bordered by 1st Street and McFadden Avenue to the north and south , and Raitt and Sullivan streets to the east and west , passing_out information on the program and the upcoming seminar to young adults . Instructors from Southern California Gas Co . teach sections of the program on home weatherization . Other organizations helping with instruction include the Carpenters Union , Santa Ana ' s Community Redevelopment Agency , and the Central County Regional Occupation Program . Applicants must be Santa Ana residents , ages 18 to 23 , and cannot be_on probation or parole . After they fill_out an application and take a physical , they are given an educational assessment to determine their academic needs . After two weeks of orientation , trainees then commute to work sites throughout the city to spend eight-hour days learning housing-rehabilitation skills . They also learn park maintenance , tree planting and landscaping and graffiti removal . Starting pay is minimum_wage . Corps members are also required to attend evening classes where they work_on writing , reading , computer use and English , if Spanish is their native language . Bernardo E . Garcia , the San Gabriel Valley and Orange County district director of the California Conservation Corps , said the program , now in its 11th year statewide , also attempts to teach young adults social skills . &quot; Our concept is team teaching , &quot; he said . &quot; We don ' t just teach job skills but try to encourage interaction between workers , which is how the real workplace operates. &quot; Sanchez has worked his way up_to becoming a regional crew leader supervising about 15 trainees since he began last April . &quot; This program has given me self-respect and direction , &quot; said Sanchez , who said he hopes to major in criminology and become a police_officer after he finishes the program . &quot; A year ago , I never pictured myself helping the community. &quot;</TEXT>
