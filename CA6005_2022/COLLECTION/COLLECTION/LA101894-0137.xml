   <HEADLINE> CAUSES OF SIMILAR 737 JET CRASHES STILL A MYSTERY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The two plane crashes were eerily similar . And thus far the searches for what caused them have proven similarly frustrating . The first crash -- near Colorado Springs , Colo. , on March 3 , 1991 -- involved a Boeing 737 jetliner that was preparing to land . Suddenly and without warning , United Airlines Flight 585 banked steeply to one side and plunged nose-first into the ground , killing all 25 people on board . The National Transportation Safety Board -- which in 27 years has solved more_than 1 # 000 transport-aircraft crash mysteries -- supplemented its own personnel with experts from the airline , the pilots ' union , the National Weather Service , the Federal Aviation Administration and the firms that manufactured the plane and its components in an exhaustive effort to figure_out what went_wrong . They examined the wreckage , studied readouts from the plane ' s two &quot; black_box &quot; recording devices , interviewed witnesses and used computer-generated &quot; flights &quot; in cockpit simulators in an effort to re-create the flight_path of the doomed jetliner . As the weeks stretched into months , the NTSB found it was coming_up with more questions than answers . And in the end -- for only the fourth time in the agency ' s history -- the crash detectives had to admit defeat . &quot; It was an equation with too many unknowns , &quot; said John Lauber , the NTSB member who headed the Colorado investigation . &quot; And there will always be the lingering fear that we overlooked something. &quot; Then , on Sept . 8 of this year , another Boeing 737 crashed while preparing to land -- this time near Pittsburgh , Pa . Once again , suddenly and without warning , the jet banked steeply to one side and then plunged nose-first into the ground . USAir Flight 427 carried 132 passengers and crew_members , and again there were no survivors . The NTSB launched another investigation , taking_note of the many similarities between the two accidents . Now , more_than six weeks into the new inquiry , investigators have come_up with a_few theories , but they have to admit that the Pittsburgh crash has them stymied . Carl Vogt , the NTSB member heading the Pittsburgh investigation , is optimistic . &quot; As of now , it ' s an unsolved crash , &quot; he said . &quot; But we ' re confident we ' ll figure this one out. &quot; Barry Schiff , a veteran airline pilot and respected air-safety consultant involved in the investigation of a number of crashes , is not so sure . &quot; Dollars to doughnuts , they won ' t find the cause , &quot; he said . Schiff ' s pessimism stems from the obliteration of evidence in the high-speed impact of Flight 427 and from his own studies of the Colorado crash , an accident that still confounds the experts . After more_than 20 months of detective_work , the NTSB admitted on Dec . 8 , 1992 , that it &quot; could not identify conclusive evidence to explain the loss of United Airlines Flight 585. &quot; The best the federal agency could do was identify the &quot; two most likely events &quot; that could have spun the plane out of control and hurled it to the ground . One of these was a &quot; rotor wind &quot; -- a horizontal tornado created by the strong , gusting winds that were spilling over the crests of the Rocky Mountains that day . However , no such wind ever measured has been strong enough to knock_down an airliner , and the board said &quot; too_little is known about the characteristics of such rotors to conclude decisively whether they were factors_in this accident. &quot; The other possibility cited by the board was a malfunction of the systems that move the plane ' s rudder -- the large , hinged slab on the vertical part of the tail that helps a plane turn left or right by pushing the tail in the opposite direction . Full deflection of the rudder could cause a plane to roll and then plunge nose-first toward the ground . But there are difficulties with this scenario too . The board conceded that although it had identified problems with the 737 ' s rudder systems , there were no problems that could not &quot; easily &quot; have been countered by the cockpit crew . More_than 3 # 000 Boeing 737s are flying throughout the world today , carrying more passengers than any other aircraft , so the NTSB ' s lack of a firm conclusion about what went_wrong in Colorado Springs is of more_than casual interest to the aviation industry . It also worries pilots . &quot; There ' s a lesson to be learned from every crash , and when you don ' t find_out what happened , you haven ' t learned that lesson , &quot; Schiff said . &quot; As a pilot , you think : ' Gee , that could happen to me. ' It ' s kind of spooky. &quot; Nonetheless , Lauber said air travelers should not be overly concerned about the plane . &quot; Because of the attention focused_on the plane and its systems after Colorado Springs , the public should be reassured , &quot; he said . The ( Boeing 737 ) was examined with great diligence and effort . . . . It ' s a good plane. &quot; The pilots of Flight 427 apparently had no problems with their Boeing 737 as the plane took_off from Chicago on the evening of Sept . 8 and headed southeast for Pittsburgh on the first leg of a scheduled trip to West Palm Beach , Fla . The weather was good , with calm winds , and the jetliner was making a routine approach to Pittsburgh International Airport when one of the pilots , during a conversation with air traffic controllers , suddenly shouted , &quot; Oh God ! &quot; At that same moment , the plane rolled to the left and plummeted straight down , slamming into the ground with such force that the aircraft and its contents were torn to pieces . Within a_few hours , an NTSB team had reached Pittsburgh , and by the next morning the investigators made their first visit to the crash site -- a shallow hillside gully near the town of Aliquippa . Joining them there were specialists from the airline , the pilots ' union and other parties with close interest in the crash . The personnel were divided into subgroups . One group began studying the plane ' s engines , another looked_at its control_systems , a third studied the meteorology , a fourth interviewed witnesses , a fifth talked with air traffic controllers , a sixth analyzed the wreckage to determine how the plane broke_up , and others reviewed maintenance records and the history of the crew , the airline and the plane . As they pursued their tasks , heavy rains pounded the hillside , slowing the gruesome job of extracting the fragmented remains of the victims from the shattered debris . That night , the investigators gathered at a local hotel to discuss their early findings . &quot; The leader of each group gets_up and says : ' Today we found this , ' &quot; Vogt said . &quot; That way , everyone knows what everyone else knows. &quot; &quot; One person will come_up with a scenario , and another person will try to shoot it down , &quot; said a source close to the investigation who asked not to be named . &quot; It ' s a process of elimination . If you can shoot one down , then there ' s one less avenue that you have to pursue. &quot; that ' s how a scenario involving sudden failure of the left engine -- which could have rolled the plane to the left -- was ruled_out . The recovered engine ' s fan_blades were bent , and dirt had been sucked into an inner turbine , showing that it was still spinning , under power , when the plane hit the ground . Inappropriate deployment of an engine thrust reverser was discounted in much the same way when actuators on the left engine ' s reversers -- the only ones that could have rolled the plane to the left -- were found in the stowed position . Weather problems were ruled_out , as were in-flight breakup and the likelihood of a bomb , which leaves tell-tale residue and characteristic metal distortions near the point of explosion . By the end of the investigation ' s second day , Flight 427 ' s two black_box recording devices -- which actually are painted orange -- had been recovered from the wreckage and shipped to the NTSB laboratories in Washington . Word came_back quickly that both had survived the impact in good_shape and were providing clear data . One of the boxes -- the cockpit voice recorder -- contained a tape_recording of all_the sounds in the cockpit during the last 30 minutes of the flight . In addition to the discussions and remarks of the pilot and co-pilot , the device recorded their conversations with air traffic controllers and a number of clicks , hums , thumps and other noises that can provide clues to what was going_on . For example , in the investigation of a 1987 Continental Airlines jetliner crash in Denver , engineers determined the takeoff speed by analyzing the sound of the spinning nose wheel . The voices picked_up by the cockpit recorder are often faint , garbled or distorted , requiring painstaking electronic enhancement by NTSB engineers . Listening to the desperate last moments of someone about to die &quot; is not a job for everyone , &quot; said Alan Pollock , an NTSB spokesman . &quot; You often hear things that are pretty unpleasant. &quot; The other box -- the flight data recorder -- collected 17 different types of information about the plane ' s performance during the final minutes of flight . The data included readouts on the plane ' s altitude , heading , airspeed , engine performance , pitch , roll and acceleration , both vertical and horizontal . While the recorder also contained information on the position of the control yoke , it lacked data -- available on newer recorders -- about other control settings . The readings from the flight data recorder have been programmed into a 737 cockpit flight_simulator at the Boeing Co . plant in Seattle , creating a full-scale replication of how the USAir jet behaved during its last moments of flight . Engineers are now feeding_in every combination of control failure , autopilot malfunction , weather phenomenon , engine_failure and pilot error that they can think_of in an effort to match the replication generated by the recording . If they can come_up with a match , it would provide strong evidence of what went_wrong . Thus far , they haven ' t , but they ' re still trying . &quot; So far , there are a number of theories , &quot; another informed source said . &quot; Most of these center around the possibility that the plane encountered severe wake turbulence from another plane , or that something went_wrong with the flight controls -- perhaps the rudder . Maybe it was some combination of the two . Maybe the pilot just didn ' t have time to react properly. &quot; The scenario involving wake turbulence -- cyclonic winds that spiral back from the wingtips of large aircraft -- arose after investigators learned that the USAir jetliner was flying below and four miles behind a Boeing 727 as the two planes approached the Pittsburgh airport . Once again , there ' s a hitch . The phenomenon has caused smaller planes to crash -- most recently a small corporate jet that was trailing a Boeing 757 as the two planes approached John Wayne Airport in Orange County last December . But planes the size of a 737 routinely fly behind other jetliners , and wake turbulence has never been known to down any of them . One source said that for wake turbulence to flip_over a 737 , the 737 probably would have to encounter the spiraling vortex at a very precise angle that would raise one wing and lower the other -- &quot; a very long shot , &quot; as he put it . &quot; But wake turbulence could be a factor , &quot; Vogt said . As for rudder system failure , the NTSB noted that after the Colorado Springs crash , regular inspections of 737 rudder systems were mandated by the FAA . The rudder on the plane in the Pittsburgh accident had been checked four times this year -- most recently less than a month before the crash -- and no problems were found . Investigators are scrutinizing the rudder components recovered from the wreckage . Thus far , no incriminating evidence has been found , but the suspicions continue and study goes_on . The wreckage of the plane -- some of it in pieces no larger than a dime -- has been spread_out like a mosaic on the floor of a hangar in Pittsburgh to form a two-dimensional reconstruction of the jetliner . &quot; They recovered 97 % to 99 % of that plane , &quot; a source said . &quot; They ' re looking_for anything abnormal. &quot; H . Keith Hagy , an accident investigator with the Air Line Pilots Assn. , said the evidence sometimes is minuscule , such_as tiny hairline cracks visible only under a microscope , that are left &quot; like rings in a tree &quot; every time a thin piece of metal is bent . Cracks like these suggest that a part may have failed from metal fatigue before the plane crashed , Hagy said , while evidence of stretching or tearing indicate that the part failed on impact . Other , larger cracks may indicate that an entire fuselage is about to burst open under the repeated stress of cabin pressurization . that ' s what happened to an Aloha Airlines jet a_few years ago in Hawaii , when a section of the fuselage popped_off , leaving passengers riding in the open at 300 m.p.h. Even the bodies of the victims can provide clues to why the crash occurred . If an autopsy shows a man was killed on impact but there is soot in his lungs , that indicates there was a fire on board before the plane crashed , while the victim was still breathing . Some evidence may_not turn_up until months after a crash -- like the flawed engine shaft from a DC-10 that an Iowa farmer unearthed while plowing . Some -- like the ice that doomed the Continental Airlines jet in Denver in 1987 -- melted away in the morning sun . And some may turn_out to point in the wrong direction . After an American Airlines DC-10 crashed in Chicago in 1979 when an engine fell_off , NTSB Vice_Chairman Elwood Driver announced that investigators had found a missing bolt on the airfield grass that was thought to be the culprit . It wasn ' t .</TEXT>
