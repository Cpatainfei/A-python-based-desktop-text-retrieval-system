   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON THE SIMPSON CASE ; TRY IT IN COURT , NOT IN THE PRESS ; PREJUDICIAL MATERIAL LIKE THE 911 TAPES AND CITATION OF ANONYMOUS SOURCES COMPROMISES THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an extraordinary ruling , the supervising judge of the criminal_courts dismissed the grand_jury in thJ . Simpson case because of prejudicial publicity . In spite of Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti ' s self-serving disclaimers , he must recognize his responsibility for the events leading to this fiasco . Garcetti had launched what The Times described as a &quot; media blitzkrieg. &quot; In an effort to reverse his office ' s string of losses in a series of high-profile cases , he committed himself to first trying this homicide case in the court of public_opinion . Through a lifetime of hard work , O . J . Simpson earned the affection and admiration of most of the public . This will make_it difficult to persuade a jury that he committed two murders . Sadly , the prosecution decided that to win this case , it had to manipulate opinion through public-relations gimmicks , anonymous leaks and character_assassination . Although it may surprise some , there are ethical rules controlling public statements of lawyers , including prosecutors . The American Bar Assn . Model Code of Ethics and case_law define what is prohibited . A prosecutor should not make any statement that &quot; will have a substantial likelihood of prejudicing a criminal proceeding. &quot; These ethics rules also specifically forbid a prosecutor to speak out of court about the accused ' s character , reputation or prior criminal acts ; to tell results of tests , or to give an opinion as_to guilt or innocence , the evidence or the merits of the case . The Supreme Court has emphasized that such limits on a lawyer ' s speech are necessary to ensure the fair administration of justice . Putting aside questions of legal ethics , fundamental_principles of fairness and our Constitution prevent a prosecutor from interfering with the right of the accused to a fair trial . Garcetti ' s media drive to manipulate public_opinion in the Simpson case is unseemly at best . The excuse that the prosecution is simply answering defense comments is not persuasive . First , it is not accurate , and second , it is the same &quot; retaliation argument &quot; that a federal judge rejected in January when Bruce Cutler , lawyer for New York mob figure John Gotti , was held_in criminal contempt for public statements he made in that case . If we can step back from the sound and fury of the Simpson case and examine the conduct of the prosecution team , which includes the police , what we see is indeed disturbing . The truth , the presumption of innocence , and O . J . Simpson ' s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury may be among the eventual casualties . We have seen an extraordinary amount of widely reported information from &quot; anonymous law-enforcement sources. &quot; Repeatedly we heard about devastating evidence , a bloody ski_mask , found in Simpson ' s house . In court , the prosecution was finally forced to admit that &quot; there is no ski mask. &quot; These same anonymous sources reported that Simpson had his hand inside a bag during the entire flight to Chicago . The implication was that it had been severely cut during a knife attack on his wife . Now a number of passengers have come_forward to testify that this bag incident never occurred . The anonymous sources also reported that Jill Shively , a grand_jury witness , observed Simpson fleeing the crime scene in his white Bronco immediately after the killings . Now we hear that her testimony is so unworthy_of belief that the prosecution will not be calling her as a witness . Nicole Simpson , Ronald Goldman and O . J . Simpson ' s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury are not the only victims of this sordid affair . The prosecutors showed no hesitancy in trashing the fine reputation of Judge Ronald Schoenberg , who sentenced Simpson in the 1989 spousal-battery case . Garcetti , in his recent media offensive , castigated Schoenberg for refusing to sentence Simpson to jail , calling his sentence &quot; a joke. &quot; The lawyer who heads the city attorney ' s domestic violence unit announced to the world that they had demanded a 30-day jail sentence for Simpson . Prosecutors claimed that despite their vigorous objections , Schoenberg , allegedly star-struck , sentenced Simpson to no time in jail . Commentators and reporters pilloried the judge . Finally the truth came_to_light : The transcript of the plea and sentencing shows that the prosecution did not ask_for a 30-day sentence , and specifically agreed that Simpson should receive no time in jail . As the campaign to trash O . J . Simpson ground on , we were treated to the release of the 1989 police battery report and tapes of the 911 calls . Transcripts of the calls were conveniently prepared by the police -- who are legally agents of the prosecution team -- to assist the media in dissemination of this prejudicial information . While ducking for cover by claiming he had no advance knowledge , Garcetti finally admitted that David Conn , one of the case prosecutors , knew that the material would be released . The police say they asked the D.A. ' s office to give them a good reason not to release the 911 tapes , but that &quot; prosecutors supported their release. &quot; Police and prosecution claim that they believed the tapes would not be admissible at a trial . The prosecution certainly knew that these tapes would receive extraordinary publicity and that potential jurors would be exposed to prejudicial evidence . This charade might help convict Simpson , but it is ethically and legally wrong . If Simpson committed these crimes , he should be held fully accountable . However , these events illustrate a concerted , win-at-any-cost approach by the prosecution and law_enforcement that prejudices Simpson ' s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury . If what we have seen in the past weeks is a preview of how the district_attorney plans to end his office ' s losing streak in high-profile cases , it is indeed troubling . It appears that the prosecution has misplaced its moral compass . If Garcetti wants to ensure that justice is done , he should stop trying this case in the press , shut_down the &quot; anonymous law-enforcement sources &quot; and step into the courtroom to try the O . J . Simpson case himself .</TEXT>
