   <HEADLINE> HATE CRIMES STIR FEAR IN ISLAMIC COMMUNITY ; MUSLIMS ARE CONCERNED OVER RISE IN ATTACKS AIMED AT THEM IN RESPONSE TO EXTREMISTS ' ACTIONS ABROAD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Over a sea of bowed heads during a recent religious_service at the Islamic Center of Southern California , the words of the sermon lingered heavily as solemn worshipers absorbed the message . &quot; Islam is a burden , &quot; the speaker admonished the multiracial crowd . &quot; But do not ask Allah to lighten your burden . Ask Allah instead to strengthen your back. &quot; The message could not come at a better time . In the wake of two recent arson attacks on Islamic mosques -- one in September in Yuba City in Northern California , another in October in New York -- the local Islamic community is trying to steel itself against a rising fear of hate crimes directed at Muslims . Recent terrorist acts committed by Muslims in the Middle_East , such_as the fatal Oct . 19 bombing of a Tel Aviv bus , coupled with American media coverage many in the Islamic community perceive as portraying their religion in a negative light , have Muslims throughout Los Angeles fearing further acts of retaliation aimed at them in response to other people ' s crimes . &quot; We do not condone violence , even if it is in the name of God . Yet every time you hear the terms ' Islamic militant , ' ' Islamic fundamentalist , ' and ' Islamic terrorist , ' we become targets , &quot; said Aslam Abdullah , editor of The Minaret , a nationally distributed magazine published by the Islamic Center , which is located in the Wilshire area . A fresh wave of hate mail and threatening phone_calls have flooded the center lately , Abdullah said . A bomb threat three months ago forced staff to evacuate the building , including more_than 60 young children who participate in the center ' s preschool through first-grade program . &quot; There ' s no question that it ' s very frightening , knowing these things can happen and do happen , &quot; said Jasser Hathout , an Egyptian immigrant whose two children attend the Islamic Center school . Several members of the center ' s congregation , one of the largest in Los Angeles with close to 1 # 500 members , have also reported incidents of verbal harassment on the street , on college campuses , and in other public places . Hate calls to the center peaked after the Nov . 21 KCET presentation of &quot; Jihad in America , &quot; a documentary about extremist Muslims that was criticized by the Islamic community as having perpetuated unfavorable Muslim stereotypes . The Public Broadcasting Service defended the film as balanced and meticulously documented . But Mona Hathout , who shares her husband ' s concern for their children ' s safety , saw it as yet another drop of fuel added_to years of press coverage feeding anti-Muslim sentiment . &quot; Unfortunately , it ' s the extremist elements that are newsworthy , &quot; she said . &quot; Your average American Muslims who go_about their business , take their kids to school and go_to work , they ' re not newsworthy . So what ends_up happening is that you don ' t get a balanced presentation. &quot; Since the mid-1980s , crimes of bigotry against Muslims and Middle Eastern immigrants -- including physical attacks , vandalism , and phone threats -- have been reported throughout Los Angeles County , increasing each time there is an international incident in which Muslims play a negative role . According to reports compiled by the county ' s Commission on Human Relations , the most dramatic increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes , not including verbal harassment , occurred during the Persian_Gulf conflict . Although local acts of hostility against Muslims have been_on the downswing since , the recent harrassment experienced by the Islamic Center , other Islamic religious and cultural centers and individual Muslims is being heralded as a sign that anti-Muslim activity in Southern California is again on the rise . The swell of anti-immigrant sentiment that carried Proposition 187 to victory last month also has local Muslims worried , since a large_number of the 200 # 000 Muslims living_in Los Angeles County are nonwhite immigrants . &quot; This is shattering the American_dream for a lot of Muslim families who came here fleeing persecution , only to find themselves discriminated against , &quot; said Salam Al-Marayati , director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in mid-Wilshire . The council wants to create a greater voice for Muslims in Los Angeles , encouraging them to report hate crimes to authorities and become involved in efforts to set the record straight on Islam in the eyes of the general public through community outreach . Although the council holds regular interfaith discussions with leaders from other religions , greater outreach must be done through schools and city government in_order to dispel the myth that associates Islam with political extremism , Al-Marayati said . &quot; We want people to see the positive side of Islam , that our charities go_to the homeless and needy , and that we are taxpayers like every_other American , &quot; he said . &quot; Our whole mission is to integrate American Muslims into society , and it ' s mainly a problem of overcoming powerlessness. &quot; One goal is to network with other Islamic groups throughout the state , encouraging them to also pursue greater interaction with mainstream society . Another is to fund a system for documenting and analyzing anti-Muslim hate crimes , Al-Marayati said . According to Abdullah , some local Muslims have become reluctant to frequent mosques and other Islamic gathering_places out of fear of victimization , with several younger Muslims going so far as_to change their names , and women adopting Western dress . But many others , like Sri Lankan immigrant Nabila Idroos , continue their normal routines and maintain their traditions with a bit of caution and unyielding faith . &quot; We can ' t always worry about what ' s going_to happen in the future , &quot; she said cheerfully , her hair covered by a white scarf . &quot; We just trust in God and go_on with our lives. &quot;</TEXT>
