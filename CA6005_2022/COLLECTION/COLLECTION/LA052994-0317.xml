   <HEADLINE> SOLZHENITSYN OPENS A NEW CHAPTER OF HIS LIFE : CELEBRITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the first day of a cross-country tour to rediscover his Russian homeland , Alexander I . Solzhenitsyn visited a hospital Saturday . As the famous author stepped into an elevator , a small crowd of doctors and a television film crew jammed in with him . Instead of going_up to the director ' s office on the sixth floor , the overloaded elevator sank part way between the lobby and the basement and stuck there for 15 minutes before a mechanic came_to the rescue . Aside from the hazards of everyday life here , the mishap reflected the quandary of Solzhenitsyn ' s identity as he returns from two decades of exile to help post-Soviet Russia find itself . Is he an intellectual or a celebrity ? can ' t he have peace to search for new truths , or must he put_up with media stardom and intrusive fans ? And how long can the 75-year-old Nobel laureate depend_on special protection from a government he criticizes so fiercely ? Solzhenitsyn spelled_out his controversial views on Russia ' s ills at a wide-ranging news_conference , insisting that there is no real democracy or economic reform here , no cleansing of the Communist legacy and too_much imitation of the West . He was equally passionate about his privacy . &quot; I would prefer not to have 200 photographers crowding around me all_the time and shooting me day after day , &quot; he said . &quot; I need to talk to the common_people . . . to learn in detail about life in Russia. &quot; To be more specific , he said he resents the fact that somebody in the crowd stepped_on his wife ' s foot after their triumphant landing here Friday on a flight from Alaska . &quot; When it ' s enough for each photographer to take two shots , why take 250 ? &quot; he asked . After talking with doctors and surgery patients at the Territorial Clinical Hospital , Solzhenitsyn rode to the city ' s Pacific port , where he was greeted by a navy band playing a lively classical medley , well-wishers pressing for autographs and more cameras . Strolling down a waterfront aisle of merchants selling food from truck-sized freight containers , the writer acted the part of a modern Rip_van_Winkle just awakened from a 20-year nap . &quot; How much is that ? &quot; he asked a man selling sausages . &quot; 10 # 000 rubles , &quot; the merchant replied . About $ 5 a kilogram . &quot; I don ' t get_it , &quot; Solzhenitsyn said , touching his long beard and appearing amazed . &quot; When I left the country many years ago , prices were very different. &quot; &quot; Come again soon , sir , &quot; the merchant said with a laugh , &quot; and I ' ll sell it to you for an even higher price ! &quot; Plainclothes police_officers locked arms in a protective ring around Solzhenitsyn and his wife as they walked , while uniformed officers stopped people at random to inspect purses and shopping_bags . &quot; While he ' s here , we will keep him under guard whether he likes it or not , &quot; said Igor P . Lebedinets , the acting territorial governor . &quot; We ' re mobilizing hundreds of men. &quot; Later , Solzhenitsyn was driven_in a black government Volga sedan to have lunch aboard one of the two luxury rail cars sent from Moscow by the Railway Ministry for his trans-Siberian journey to the Russian_capital . The cars , equipped with a kitchen and Oriental carpets , will carry his entourage of family , friends , chefs , attendants , security police and a British Broadcasting Corp . documentary_film crew . Solzhenitsyn said the 5 # 700-mile rail journey , which will take several weeks , will allow him to make many stops and to &quot; see things through the window. &quot; He said he last saw Siberia from a prison van , on the way to an eight-year term in Stalin ' s gulag after World_War_II -- the seminal experience for his powerful writings against the Soviet system . The lavish official hospitality by the current authorities prompted one Russian journalist to ask Solzhenitsyn about comparisons to Maxim Gorky , the writer brought_back from Italian exile under Stalin . &quot; Gorky came_back to serve the regime , &quot; Solzhenitsyn replied . &quot; I will never serve the regime , whatever government is in power. &quot; But he refrained_from criticizing Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , who sent a congratulatory telegram saying , &quot; Your talent and your experience as a historian and thinker will help us all_in reorganizing Russia. &quot; The writer did , however , repeat many criticisms he had made abroad about the Yeltsin government ' s attempts at reform . For example , he described the 1992 decisions to free up prices and sell_off state property without breaking_up monopolies as &quot; brainless &quot; steps that had made a country already wrecked by the Communists even poorer . He called Russia a &quot; pseudo-democracy &quot; that still lacks local self-rule , has failed to punish the crimes of Soviet repression and blindly imitates Western ways unsuited to its culture . He sneered at the seepage of such foreign terms as &quot; voucher &quot; and &quot; futures &quot; into Russian usage . &quot; It ' s not simply the sickness of our language , &quot; he declared , &quot; it ' s the sickness of our soul. &quot; Insisting that outsiders must &quot; give Russia a chance to pull_together as Russia , &quot; he implicitly called_for joining the Russian-speaking parts of neighboring Kazakhstan , Belarus and Ukraine with Russia proper . At the same time , he dismissed Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , the neo-fascist politician who played_up nationalist themes in last year ' s parliamentary election , as a &quot; caricature of a Russian patriot. &quot; While Solzhenitsyn denied any political ambitions , his more measured Russia-first views are likely to strike a powerful chord as he travels and speaks across the country . &quot; The atmosphere in the hospital changed in one minute after he came , &quot; said Yelizaveta B . Pyatina , 58 , a patient there . &quot; Everybody began smiling and talking_about books , politics , history . We all forgot about our ailments. &quot; Some Russian politicians and intellectuals have criticized Solzhenitsyn for coming_home too late to shape Russia ' s development . The newspaper Moscow Komsomolets reflected that view with a headline : &quot; The old_man missed the plane. &quot; The &quot; old_man &quot; was not amused . When that newspaper ' s correspondent rose to ask a question at his news_conference , Solzhenitsyn chided him for the headline and ordered him to sit_down . &quot; You ' ll have to wait for the next plane , &quot; Solzhenitsyn said . Sergei L . Loiko , a reporter in The Times ' Moscow Bureau , contributed to this story .</TEXT>
