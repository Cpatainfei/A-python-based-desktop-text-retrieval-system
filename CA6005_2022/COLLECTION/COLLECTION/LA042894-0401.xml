   <HEADLINE> CIVIC ARTS PLAZA TO MAKE A NAME FOR ITSELF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If the silver spurs , 10-gallon hats and red bandannas bouncing through Conejo Valley Days this week start to seem a bit hokey , Thousand Oaks ' cultural mavens can offer some relief : a delicate gold stickpin boosting the Civic Arts Plaza . The rectangular pins , which feature a leaping dancer against a turquoise background , will sell for $ 3 apiece at this week ' s Western-themed festival . They ' re the first -- and likely the cheapest -- of an expected gush of Civic Arts Plaza paraphernalia . From limited-edition medallions to colorful silk-screened T-shirts , a barrage of mementos bearing the performing arts center ' s logo should hit Thousand Oaks this summer and fall . The merchandise , which must be licensed by the city attorney , will commemorate both the Civic Arts Plaza ' s grand opening and Thousand Oaks ' 30th anniversary . Most will bear one of the Civic Arts Plaza ' s logos : a graceful silhouette known as the &quot; Exuberant Muse , &quot; or two dancers cavorting on a stylized piano_keyboard under an oak_tree . In approving the concept late Tuesday , Thousand Oaks council_members turned all licensing decisions over to a citizens committee organizing October ' s grand opening . As executive_director of the performing arts center , Tom Mitze has established just one ground_rule -- no weapons can be licensed . In lieu of assault_rifles , he suggested the Exuberant Muse might look good on tote_bags , cups and other inexpensive , family-oriented products . &quot; We could have everything from crystal goblets all_the way on down to coffee_mugs , &quot; theater Commissioner Julian Macdonald said . &quot; We could have a tremendous price range , so everyone in the community would have a keepsake. &quot; Under the program approved Tuesday , vendors must first approach the citizens committee with proposals . They can then negotiate for the right to use the Civic Arts Plaza logos . Vendors selling the merchandise for charity might get a discount , whereas others might have to pay a percentage of their profits in royalties , Mitze said . Eventually , a group called Friends of the Civic Arts Plaza may set_up a permanent souvenir store in the building ' s lobby . For now , however , most marketing will focus_on the grand opening . Former Thousand Oaks resident Scott Bennett , now an account_executive at_Liberty Mint in Utah , told the council his firm is prepared to launch a line of medallions . Bennett believes he could sell several thousand silver coins for about $ 30 apiece .</TEXT>
