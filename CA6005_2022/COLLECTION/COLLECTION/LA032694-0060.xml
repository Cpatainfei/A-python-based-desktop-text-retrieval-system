   <HEADLINE> PRI FACES A CHANGED NATION IN QUEST FOR NEW CANDIDATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Leaders of this nation ' s ruling party struggled on Friday with a vastly changed political landscape as they sought to come_up with a successor for their assassinated presidential hopeful , Luis Donaldo Colosio , who was buried in his hometown . Among other maneuvers , activists for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , as it is known , appeared to be testing to see whether the planned Aug . 21 national election could be rescheduled . But their overtures were met with staunch resistance from opposition parties . PRI strategists , analysts said , were likely seeking new flexibility on the election date so as_to widen the field of possible presidential candidates ; their options are now limited by a Mexican constitutional restriction . It prohibits Cabinet members and other top-ranking government officials -- the sort of individuals from whose ranks a presidential aspirant might normally emerge -- from running_for president within six months of leaving_office . But leaders of the PRI , which has governed this nation for 65 years , may want a range of presidential prospects to consider , especially since their candidate potentially will have to deal with a changed Mexico after Colosio ' s assassination Wednesday . In November , when Colosio was named the PRI candidate , Mexico was a country that had moved_in a decade from disaster to partnership in the world ' s largest trading bloc . Despite its need for domestic political adjustments and its problems with drug trafficking , many analysts hailed this nation as an economic model for the Third_World . The main duty for its next president , analysts said , once may have been simply to ensure the continuity of the present government ' s policies . But Colosio ' s successor , experts said , will now be expected to prove that he can lead a nation with an Indian rebellion in its southern state of Chiapas and growing concerns about public safety -- fears that were brought_home by Colosio ' s assassination at a campaign rally in Tijuana . In other developments Friday : * Colosio was buried in his hometown of Magdalena de Kino in northern Mexico after his family decided against his planned cremation . &quot; Bullets of hate , rancor and cowardice interrupted the life of Luis Donaldo Colosio , abruptly ending his existence , but not the ideas for which he fought , &quot; said his widow , Diana Laura Riojas , at a graveside service . * The Indian rebels shelved for now a draft peace agreement , charging that the government is poised to restart the war . The rebels said in a communique that the government is going_to use the assassination as an excuse to attack them , the Associated Press reported . &quot; We are_on red alert , &quot; the statement said . There was no reaction from the government . * In the first day of trading since the assassination , the Mexican Stock_Exchange closed at 2 # 520.78 , down 22.79 points -- less than 1 % , compared to Wednesday ' s close . The peso held at 3.36 to the dollar at exchange houses . The market dropped just a little more_than 4 % early in the day , but it quickly recovered . Traders said they believed that this nation ' s financial crisis had probably passed , since trading is traditionally light during Holy_Week , which starts Monday . * Mario Aburto Martinez , the suspected assassin , was moved and arraigned in a court near the capital . He now formally stands accused of premeditated murder and carrying a gun without a permit . He was sent to a maximum-security prison near the capital , where he was surrounded by guards carrying submachine_guns under the tightest security available . He was placed in a glass cage at Mexico ' s newest prison , where small groups of photographers were allowed to take pictures of him as he looked straight ahead , showing no emotion . * President Carlos Salinas de Gortari appointed Supreme Court Justice Miguel Montes as special prosecutor to investigate Colosio ' s killing . A congressional commission also left for Tijuana to begin an independent investigation of Colosio ' s death . The Political Scramble After a day of grieving , Mexicans returned to their national sport of reading political tea leaves , guessing who the new PRI candidate -- and , thus , the de_facto next president of this country -- might be . Former Mexico_City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis , at first considered a favorite , appeared to have taken himself out of the running when he was strongly rejected Thursday by the crowds outside Colosio ' s wake . That seemed to open the field . But the main constraint for PRI strategists appeared to be finding a prominent party member who has not held a high government_office in the last month so the individual could meet the constitutional requirement and would have been out of office for six months by the Aug . 21 election . Speculation in some circles was that , after having fielded a string of economists for Mexico ' s top job , the party might opt_for a candidate with a law_enforcement background . &quot; People are increasingly concerned about public safety , &quot; social commentator Homero Aridjis said . The assassination , combined with a series of high-profile kidnapings -- the most recent one this month -- has intensified Mexicans ' general sense of insecurity , especially in cities where violence traditionally has been minimal . That thinking is believed to favor former Interior Minister Fernando Gutierrez Barrios . But Sergio Aguayo , a human_rights activist , also cautioned that in Mexico , unlike in the United States , public safety is not identified with the police , who are often corrupt . &quot; People concerned about law and order want more control of the police , &quot; he said . As for the Mexican business_community , it still favors a candidate with strong economic credentials . The most prominent PRI economist not in a top government post now is Ernesto Zedillo , Colosio ' s campaign manager . While his credentials as an economist are respected , Zedillo had a mixed record as head of the now-defunct Planning and Budget Ministry ; he was enmeshed in a scandal over compulsory textbooks when he was education minister . In addition , Fidel Velazquez , the curmudgeonly leader of the government-affiliated labor_movement , cautioned that those handicapping the presidential race should not discount the real favorite of the business and financial community : Treasury Minister Pedro Aspe Armella . Aspe appears to be ineligible , because he will have been in office too recently to meet the constitutional prohibitions . But , Velazquez argued , &quot; laws can be interpreted. &quot; The mood of the country , however , also appears increasingly to be turning against such re-interpretations . &quot; We need a greater democratic opening , &quot; Aguayo said . &quot; The proof of that will be clean elections this year. &quot; The Funeral Thousands of mourners gathered_in Magdalena de Kino , a northern desert cattle town where Colosio was born , to say goodby to their beloved politician . As his metal coffin -- draped in the red-white-and-green Mexican flag -- was lowered into the ground , men and women wept , Reuters news service reported . Funeral ribbons fashioned from plastic bags were strung from road signs . Groups of schoolchildren were among the thousands who lined the highway from the Mexican border town of Nogales to Colosio ' s hometown , 50 miles to the south , the Associated Press said . Some held Mexican flags and Colosio campaign posters . Times staff writer Patrick J . McDonnell in Los Angeles contributed to this report . * ACCUSED ASSASSIN ' S INTENT : Mario Aburto Martinez says he only meant to hurt Colosio . A14</TEXT>
