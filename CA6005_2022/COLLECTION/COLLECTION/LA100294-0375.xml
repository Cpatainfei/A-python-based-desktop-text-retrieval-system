   <TEXT> In the searching-for-something positive department , Miami ' s 24-3 defeat of Rutgers was the Hurricanes ' 67th consecutive victory against an unranked opponent . Only a week ago , football fans were talking_about Miami ' s 58-game home winning streak , which was ended by Washington . &quot; If we beat ( Rutgers ) , 100-0 , it ' s not going_to take_away last week ' s loss , &quot; said Warren Sapp , a defensive tackle who Saturday set_up a 14-yard touchdown run_by Michael Stewart with a fumble recovery and 19-yard return . &quot; I had the whole weekend to think , ' Why , why , why , why ? ' I saw the film and still can ' t understand it. &quot; We can . The Huskies scored more points . HOME ALONE Speaking of home-winning streaks , Miami returned the favor by beating the Scarlet Knights at Rutgers Stadium in Piscataway , N.J. It was the first time Coach Doug Graber , Rutgers coach since 1990 , lost at Rutgers Stadium . His streak ended at 12 victories . IT HAD TO END Texas ' 34-31 loss to Colorado ended a 251-game streak for the Longhorns , who lost for the first time in their 102-year history when scoring 25 points or more at_home . LUNAR LAMENT Coach Joe Tiller of Wyoming knew his Cowboys were in_trouble when he heard this week that Nebraska planned to step_up its play to compensate for the loss of quarterback Tommie Frazier . &quot; Where are they stepping it to , the moon ? &quot; Tiller asked about the No . 2-ranked Cornhuskers . They did not have to go that far in a 42-32 victory over Wyoming at Lincoln , Neb . Lawrence Phillips , who scored three touchdowns , gained 168 yards in 27 carries . A FUTURE KRZYZEWSKI ? Everyone knows about Mike Krzyzewski ' s basketball program at Duke , but how many realize first-year coach Fred Goldsmith has the football_team off to a 5-0 start ? An easy schedule has helped . Duke defeated Maryland ( 2-3 ) , East Carolina ( 2-2 ) , Army ( 1-3 ) , Georgia Tech ( 1-3 ) and Navy ( 0-4 ) . &quot; To be in this situation and be 5-0 is just a tremendous blessing , &quot; Goldsmith said . &quot; We can ' t be anything else but ecstatic. &quot; SMALL STEPS Western Kentucky scored a 31-22 victory over soon-to-be Division I-A Alabama Birmingham , which was a big improvement for UAB . The Blazers lost , 72-0 , to Kansas last week . BIG IN BIG WEST David Barr , California ' s quarterback , was urging his charges not to overlook the Big West ' s San Jose State after losses to San Diego State and Hawaii of the Western Athletic Conference . &quot; I mean , I think we ' re in first place in the Pac-10 and last place in the WAC , &quot; he said last week . The Bears passed Barr ' s challenge , 55-0 . SIZING UP To those who think Washington ' s Napoleon Kaufman ( a career-high 227 yards in 34 carries against UCLA ) is too small to make_it big at a listed 5 feet 9 , 180 pounds , the NFL ' s two best backs are Emmitt Smith at 5-9 , 209 , and Barry Sanders at 5-8 , 203 . GIVEN THE BOOT Before playing Colorado , Texas safety Tre Thomas said : &quot; If that Hail_Mary shows_up , I promise I ' ll break_up the play. &quot; Last week , quarterback Kordell Stewart ' s tipped pass to Michael Westbrook with no time left gave the Buffaloes a 27-26 victory over Michigan . Thomas was no factor Saturday when Neil Voskeritchian ' s last-second field_goal did_in No . 16 Texas , 34-31 . EARLY EXIT Tailback Ki-Jana Carter of Penn State dislocated his right thumb late in the second quarter of the Nittany Lions ' 48-21 victory over Temple . Carter was replaced after catching a nine-yard pass with 25 seconds left in the first_half . No . 4 Penn State led , 21-12 . Penn State officials were not sure if Carter would be ready for the Lions ' next game , a Big Ten showdown against Michigan on Oct . 15 in Ann Arbor. , Mich . Coach Joe Paterno said : &quot; we ' ll try to put it back together without an operation. &quot; Carter gained 61 yards in nine carries , caught three passes for 49 yards and had 68 yards in kick returns at the time of his injury . He is averaging 8.1 yards per carry and has scored nine touchdowns . CRYSTAL BALL CHECK With Rose Bowl and national championship implications , Paterno was asked about his chances against Michigan . &quot; I ' m not clairvoyant , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t mean that to be smart-alecky . I just don ' t know. &quot; BEST_SELLER How much mileage can they get_out of the book , &quot; Rough Magic , &quot; in which Bill Walsh talks before he thinks in insulting many of his coaching rivals ? One of the book ' s seminal moments comes when Walsh calls Notre Dame ' s Lou Holtz a &quot; spoiled little brat. &quot; Before Notre Dame trounced Stanford , 34-15 , at South Bend , Ind. , Holtz was quoted on national television : &quot; I don ' t know about being a spoiled brat , but I like to get my own way. &quot; Walsh characterized the treatise , written by the San Francisco Chronicle ' s Lowell Cohn as a &quot; book I ' m not party to. &quot; All Walsh did was give the columnist free reign to cover the team for a season . WORST TALKER Mike Price , Washington State ' s coach , inadvertently supported Walsh ' s take when he said , &quot; I don ' t want to sound like Lou Holtz , but Tennessee has to be the best 1-3 team in the country. &quot; But unlike Notre Dame , which routinely routs the opponents Holtz tries to build_up , Washington State proved Price right . Going_into game , the Cougars had given_up only 108 yards in 94 carries , an average of 36 yards rushing per game . But Nilo Silvan went untouched 62 yards on a reverse and the Cougars gave_up 149 rushing yards in the Volunteers ' 10-9 victory at Knoxville . POURING IT ON West_Virginia , which entered the game with one of the country ' s worst scoring offenses -- averaging 9.4 points per game -- defeated Larry Smith ' s Missouri Tigers , 34-10 , in Columbus , Mo . FOILED AGAIN Ken Dilger , Illinois ' 6-foot-5 tight_end , was stopped on the one-yard line by Purdue ' s 5-7 John Jackson as time expired in the Boilermakers ' 22-16 victory . His explanation : &quot; I caught the ball . I hesitated a little bit . I saw an opening but a_couple_of guys hit me at the one . I just didn ' t make_it . It ' s probably the worst feeling in my life . I was the only guy open and I just didn ' t make_it across the goal line. &quot; He knows the feeling , though . In 1991 , Dilger dropped a pass in the end zone with 1:49 left as Missouri held_on for a 23-19 victory at Columbia . POISON_IVY The Ivy League had a banner day going 7-0 ( Penn was idle ) against nonconference opponents . A couple of victories were notable : Columbia ' s 28-13 victory over Lafayette was the Lions ' first over the Leopards since 1980 . Brown won consecutive games for the first time in seven years and defeated Colgate for the first time since 1968 , 26-7 . ON TARGET Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom was 37-for-59 for 360 yards in a 34-15 loss to Notre Dame . Stenstrom increased his career passing yardage to 9 # 349 to tie former Stanford great John Elway for second place on the Pac-10 list . He is 44 yards shy of the conference record set by Oregon State ' s Erik Wilhelm ( 1985-88 ) . He also has been successful against the Fighting Irish , completing 100 of 147 passes for 1 # 020 yards in four games . ALMOST ON TARGET Georgia ' s Eric Zeier became the top passer in Southeastern Conference history , but he could not make the passes when the Bulldogs ' needed them most in a 29-28 loss to No . 11 Alabama at Tuscaloosa . Zeier eclipsed the career record of 9 # 287 yards held by Florida ' s Shane Matthews . He finished with 263 yards and has 9 # 287 for his career . But in a last-minute effort to get his team in field-goal position , Zeier had two incompletions to give_up possession . ANOTHER MISERABLE DAY Idaho ' s 70-21 Big Sky victory over rival Idaho State recalls another unceremonious moment in the Bengals ' football history . The 70 points were the most given_up by Idaho State since a 137-0 loss to the Utah Aggies in 1919 . NOTEWORTHY Rashaan Salaam of Colorado gained 317 yards in 35 carries in the Buffaloes ' 34-31 victory over Texas . . . . After losing its first four games by a combined score of 236-53 , Northeast Louisiana defeated Weber State , 62-37 . . . . Indiana ' s Alex Smith , who started Saturday as the country ' s second-leading rusher at 157.3 yards per game , was held to 22 yards in 16 carries by Minnesota . . . . Brent Moss gained 173 yards in 27 carries and became Wisconsin ' s third 3 # 000-yard rusher . Moss , with 3 # 125 yards , joined former Heisman Trophy winner Alan Ameche and Billy Marek . QUOTEWORTHY &quot; After the first_quarter , I could see the goal posts falling_down and Philly going crazy. &quot; -- Henry Burris , the Temple quarterback who led the Owls on two early drives against Penn State . &quot; Stanford scares me running the ball as they do passing. &quot; -- Lou Holtz , before the_Irish defeated the Cardinal , 34-15 .</TEXT>
