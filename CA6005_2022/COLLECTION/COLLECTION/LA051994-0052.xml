   <HEADLINE> EARTHWATCH : ENERGY , BRAINS MAKE FOR HOPEFUL SITUATION ; PETROLEUM INDUSTRY SHOWS WISDOM OF ENCOURAGING SCHOLARS WHO MAY NOT PURSUE TRADITIONAL OIL-RELATED CAREERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The prospectors of oil were doing some prospecting for talent last week at the Ventura County Fairgrounds . It was Energy Information Night , on which the local chapter of the American Petroleum Institute held an energy careers fair and honored several of its professional members for their accurate -- and spill-free -- deep water drilling . The chapter also handed_out $ 1 # 000 scholarship checks , as it does annually , to 16 local students . The winners , chosen by a committee led by Dick Miller of Clawson Petroleum Consultants Inc. , could potentially do as much for our community as a new mineral discovery . This was not a simple exercise in beating the bushes for future petroleum engineers . Among the planned college studies listed by this group of 4.0-average earners were elementary teaching , history , electrical_engineering , bioengineering and medicine . Sure , a_few indicated they wanted to go_into the oil_business , and it made_sense that students so inclined would apply ; earlier in the nine-year history of these well-publicized awards , petroleum engineering was the focus . But , according to Michele Tebeau , organizer of the awards ceremony , the chapter is now accepting applications from bright and needy students -- period . I interviewed several of the winners . One , Daniel Geis , a Santa Paula High_School senior with a 4.15 grade-point average , proved a bit of a wag . Having determined that he wasn ' t going_into oil drilling , I asked him what he planned to do with an engineering degree . Wordlessly he pointed upward . Space was also on the academic dance card of Michael Churney , a Westlake High_School senior . Space and energy , specifically the way-out technology of hydrogen propulsion being considered by NASA for the planned National Aerospace Plane . I was thinking how clever I was that I already knew BMW and Mazda were using the new technology -- which is non-polluting -- in sports_cars . But I didn ' t know about the rocket version until Churney mentioned it . Clean space_travel . He found_out about it at his part-time job at Rockwell . When he was a sophomore . Fifteen years old . Are you getting_the_picture ? You may be asking if the American Petroleum Institute chapter isn ' t sort of shooting itself in the foot by aiding the careers of such kids . Well , there ' s plenty of work for the folks in the traditional oil_business to do even if we switch to machines powered by hydrogen , which is of course free . It turns_out that half of the oil America processes is used to manufacture consumer goods -- everything from footballs to fertilizers to fake fur . A lot of the consumer goods made with oil , by the way , are recyclable . The other half gets poured into the gas_tank . And the petroleum industry also purveys natural_gas , which is used for power generating , heating and cooling . The dry stuff , as they call it , now accounts_for more dollar sales at the Exxon and Chevron corporations than gasoline , according to reports released this spring . Now you can see why Energy Night was so interesting to me . I went_for the latest info on the industry , including natural_gas and plastics . But I found some things much more intriguing to an Earthwatch columnist . People . And hope . The kid who will be using his scholarship to become a lawyer and an opera singer will have to go_into somebody else ' s column . Details * FYI : For information on the cash scholarships awarded by the American Petroleum Institute call Dick Miller at 653-4482 . No limit on what students choose to study . For new career information about the energy industry call Tim Pompey at the Ventura County superintendent of schools office , 388-4435 .</TEXT>
