   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA ' S HERTA HALF A DYNAMIC DUO ; AUTO RACING : FORMER HART HIGH CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNER AND GO-KART RACER TEAMS WITH A.J. FOYT IN 78TH RUNNING OF INDY 500 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One is a four-time winner of the Indianapolis 500 , arguably the greatest race-car driver of all time . The other is only a_few years removed from the Santa Clarita Valley , where he raced go-karts at Saugus Speedway , ran cross-country at Hart High and held a part-time job at Magic Mountain . So why are A.J. Foyt , 59 , and Bryan Herta , 24 , being mentioned in the same sentence ? They are a match made in Indianapolis . On Sunday , the unlikely pair will be teamed among the 33 entries in the 78th running of the Indianapolis 500 . Foyt , who in 1958 made the first of a record 35 consecutive starts at Indianapolis , retired from Indy car_racing only days before last year ' s race . He is now a car owner . Three weeks ago , he found a protege in last season ' s Indy Lights champion , Herta , who has zoomed to the zenith of motor racing since graduating from Hart in 1988 . Herta will make his Indy 500 debut behind the wheel of Foyt ' s Lola-Ford Cosworth . Herta will start in 22nd position , seven rows behind pole-sitter Al Unser Jr . &quot; I guess I really have come a long way in a hurry , going from go-karts to Indy in only five years , &quot; said Herta , who resides in Dublin , Ohio , and attends Ohio State . &quot; But it ' s been a dream of mine for such a long_time . I ' ve never said I wanted to be here by this year or that year . I just wanted to hit each stop along the way and be successful at every level I was competing at . &quot; Indy is absolutely unbelievable . It ' s so different than anything I ' ve ever done . Speeds are so_much higher . You have to teach yourself to look much farther down the race track. &quot; Although Herta competed in cross-country for four years and placed third in the Foothill League junior varsity finals as a junior , his passion always has been racing_cars . He began driving on dirt at Indian Dunes north of Valencia shortly after his family moved to Newhall from his native Michigan . &quot; I was always a better driver than I was a runner , &quot; Herta said . Herta may be Indy ' s new kid behind the wheel , but he ' s hardly wet behind the ears . &quot; He ' s very impressive for a rookie , &quot; Foyt said . In six years racing go-karts throughout California , Herta won six championships . In 1988 , he won 14 of 18 main events . Herta also competed for two years in the Barber Saab Pro Series , winning the championship in 1990 with four victories in 12 starts . In 1992 , Herta moved_up to Indy Lights . Last season , he took the series by storm , winning seven of 12 races , including the final four of the season . He also won a series-record eight pole positions . Herta planned to join the Indy Car World_Series this season as a driver for owner Steve Horne . But when Horne contacted Foyt about conducting Herta ' s orientation program at Indianapolis Motor Speedway , Foyt was impressed by the young driver . &quot; I had the chance to work with Bryan and I had taken him around the track and showed him the groove I always liked , &quot; said Foyt , who last won at Indianapolis in 1977 . &quot; He ran a real nice pattern . The computer showed he was consistent . And when I made a change to the car , he could read it back to me , even if it was a small change. &quot; Foyt had just released Davy Jones as a driver and was looking_for a replacement . Herta was eager to sign . &quot; It was a great set of circumstances , &quot; Herta said . &quot; I was absolutely thrilled from the beginning . A.J. is a fascinating man . He knows more about this place , probably , than anybody ever . There ' s a lot I ' m going_to learn from him . He puts you at_ease right away . He ' s got that sort of Southern charm. &quot; Herta will need to be a quick_study if he expects to take the checkered flag . His qualifying time of 220.992 m.p.h. is slowest among the field of 33 drivers . On the final day of qualifying , Herta watched nervously as Willy T . Ribbs , Geoff Brabham , Mark Smith and Gary Bettenhausen all failed to qualify ahead of him . Moreover , only six rookies have won at Indy , the last in 1966 . But Herta ' s hopes are high . &quot; Our goal is to win , &quot; Herta said . &quot; Anybody who tells you otherwise is a liar . I don ' t think we expect to ( win ) , but we ' ve got the right equipment . We feel we ' ve got all_the pieces. &quot;</TEXT>
