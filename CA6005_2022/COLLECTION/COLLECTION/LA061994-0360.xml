   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; KOFI ANNAN ; THE SOFT-SPOKEN ECONOMIST WHO RUNS U.N. PEACEKEEPING FORCES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United Nations does no more vital work these days than peacekeeping . The official in_charge of the Blue Helmets and Berets -- as peacekeepers are known -- might be expected to be a blustery general renowned for his valor or cunning in some great battle . But it is Kofi Annan , 56 , an unassuming Ghanaian economist and financial manager who is undersec retary-general in_charge of peacekeeping , who heads the operations . Annan is the fifth U.N. peacekeeping chief -- and the first from the Third_World . None , however , had an empire to compare with his . With the Cold_War ended and the Security_Council no longer paralyzed by Russian and U.S. vetoes , the numbers of peacekeeping missions have mushroomed . Annan now runs 17 -- with 70 # 000 troops and police at an annual cost of $ 3.2 billion . His biggest problem these days , however , is putting_together missions in the wake of Somalia and President Bill_Clinton ' s Policy Directive 25 . The debacle in Somalia -- with 18 U.S. Rangers dying in a single raid during the manhunt for warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed -- made many countries , especially the United States , wary of peacekeeping . And the policy directive insists that the United States will not support a peacekeeping operation unless it meets a half-dozen conditions -- including a timetable for withdrawal , a cease-fire in place , an acceptable level of risk and a clear goal . The directive implies that the most powerful member of the United Nations has little enthusiasm for peacekeeping . Although U.S. policy now cramps Annan , he is popular among Americans , and U.S. officials encouraged Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to put him in_charge of peacekeeping in 1992 . Annan speaks softly , barely above a whisper , but it is worth straining to hear him . He is a clear-minded , thoughtful man with a reputation throughout the United Nations for speaking frankly . He infuriated several African ambassadors , for example , when he told the_French newspaper Le Monde in late May that he has had trouble recruiting African peacekeepers because African governments &quot; probably need their armies to intimidate their own populations. &quot; Annan , married with three children , was educated at Ghana ' s University of Science and Technology , Macalester College in Minnesota , the Institut des Hautes Etudes Internationales in Geneva and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . His entire career has been with the U.N. system , working in various administrative jobs in Addis Ababa , Geneva , Cairo and New York . Annan works in a spacious office on the 37th floor of the Secretariat building in U.N. headquarters , one floor below the secretary-general . Annan ' s office , where he recently sat_down to talk_about his work , is decorated with a_few select pieces of African sculpture , notably from the Ivory_Coast and Senegal . * Question : You ' re having more and more trouble getting troops for peacekeeping . Can you explain what the problem is ? Answer : Yes , we are encountering considerable difficulties in finding well-trained and equipped troops for the assignments that the ( Security ) Council has given us . This is partly due_to perceived dangers the governments see associated with these operations , which are supposed to be peacekeeping but . . . where there ' s really no peace to keep . . . . Here I am looking_at situations like Bosnia and Rwanda . I think that , as hesitant as everybody is about going_in , nobody says don ' t do anything . And yet , when you turn_around and ask , &quot; How many troops would you give ? &quot; -- each one is prepared to volunteer the other person ' s army , the other country ' s army and , if necessary , to make some financial contribution . It ' s a problem that we need to try and resolve quickly . Q : Everyone says that since Rwanda is Africa ' s concern , we should get African troops . But when you spoke_to the Senate recently , you said if you wanted troops quickly , the Organization of African Unity was not the place to go . What did you mean ? A : Basically , what I meant was that we had a situation that required immediate and urgent action . What was required in that situation was a quick and rapid reaction force . . . . The presence of that force -- determined to protect vulnerable groups of people -- would have made a difference in the violence . We were not dealing with a group of well-organized and well-trained armies . The militias are using machetes and other weapons to kill . The presence would have made a difference , and we could have saved some people . . . . But that kind of force is not available to any of the African_countries . The only African_country . . . that does have that force is South_Africa and it was too soon -- it was immediately after their independence ( to ask them ) . Q : And you never got the quick reaction force in there . A : We never got the quick reaction force , and every day that the governments examined whether to contribute troops or not -- and here I ' m talking_about both Western and African_countries -- more people lost their lives . And as late as it is , we can still make a difference if we can go_on in . . . . We have offers from Ghana , Zimbabwe , Senegal , Ethiopia and Nigeria . But they don ' t come_with the requisite equipment . So now we are passing the hat around , looking_for equipment . We are talking to the U.S. , the_French , the_British and the South_Africans . Trying to marry the men and equipment does take time -- as we have learned through our attempt to get German equipment for the Pakistanis before they go_to Yugoslavia . That has taken about nine months to a year . I hope this doesn ' t take that long . Q : Are you slowed_down in recruitment by President Clinton ' s new directive ? A : I think the role and the attitude of the U.S. always has an effect . It has a leadership role . It is the only superpower now . . . . You saw in Somalia -- when the U.S. went_in , lots of other governments followed . In the Gulf , when the U.S. led , lots of others followed . In Somalia , when the U.S. left , they left , too . And even in Bosnia , the European governments are saying if there is a cease-fire and we have to put_in a force of about 75 # 000 , we would want the U.S. to lead it . . . . So when the country with that dominant role and position takes a back seat and begins to hold_back , it has an impact on the attitude of other nations . But that having been said , nobody would disagree_with . . . the U.S. . . . when they say there should be some guidelines for the council to determine when they take_on a crisis and when they do not -- provided it ' s applied in a flexible and practical manner . Q : Let me take you back to Somalia . When you look_at it now , what do you think was the greatest error in the operation ? A : I think one of the errors was perhaps the decision to attempt to arrest Aideed and , in doing so , to be seen by some as going_against . . . Aideed ' s troops . In these situations . . . the impartiality of the force and the principle of consent of the parties are crucial . If you are perceived to be fair , you do not run the danger of being engaged . If you are seen as taking initiatives that could change the military balance on the ground and favor one group or the other , the troops who see themselves as disadvantaged might decide you ' ve taken sides and declare war on you . And this is what happened . . . . In Somalia , we did cross that line , and once you cross the line , it ' s extremely difficult to turn_back to that neutral , consensual approach . Q : Do you now feel that the Somalia experience , for whatever reason , has crippled peace enforcement ? A : I would say that categorically , without any difficultly , that yes , the Somalia experience has . . . . I don ' t think the member states have the stomach for this type of operation . It ' s going_to be a very long_time before the U.N. , as an organization , takes_on a peace-enforcement mission and manages it itself . My sense is that if there is going_to be another enforcement mission , that it ' s likely to be the Desert Storm model -- where the Security_Council would authorize a group of member states to take all necessary means to correct or redress a situation . I don ' t think , as an organization , the Security_Council will give a mandate to run an enforcement operation for quite a while . Q : Did you have higher hopes for peacekeeping when you took_on this job two years ago ? A : I think we all did . We all had higher hopes for peacekeeping . The Cold_War was over . The new consensus in the council permitted agreement on operations that had not been possible . The council was breaking new ground , accepting the fact that the threat to peace is not necessarily a war between two states , but it could start from an internal conflict , which we ' ve seen in Yugoslavia , or the Somalia one that throws refugees out and destabilizes its neighbors . Or even Haiti . . . . In addition , we are also getting involved in situations where there were massive abuses of human_rights or desperate humanitarian situations . So it was -- we were all expectant . It was thrilling , and we saw possibilities of doing perhaps , as somebody put it , what the organization was expected to do . So we were all excited . Q : Let me take you to Bosnia and one sensitive matter there . Do you feel Mr. ( Yasushi ) Akashi , ( the secretary-general ' s special representative ) , made a mistake in vetoing the NATO request for air strikes in the Gorazde incident last April ? A : No , I don ' t think so . . . . When the cease-fire had not gone_into force , NATO requested that we should go_in and use air_power . Akashi -- and here it wasn ' t just Akashi -- Akashi , Lt . Gen . ( Michael ) Rose , the commander in Bosnia , and Gen . ( Bertrand ) de Lapresle , the force commander , unanimously decided that it was the wrong thing to do . Why did they decide it was the wrong thing to do ? They had been sitting with the Serbs negotiating for 11 to 12 hours . And they had the sense that the Serbs would comply , meet the deadline . And that if the Serbs complied , they had arranged to introduce into Gorazde a U.N. force that would monitor the cease-fire line , would get_into the city with medical help , to give assistance to the sick and wounded and also be there to verify and monitor the withdrawal of the Serbs . And if one started bombing immediately , this was not going_to be possible . In the end , their predictions were right . The Serbs did withdraw , with some minor problems . . . . We achieved the results we all wanted without fighting . If you don ' t have to fight to win , why fight ? Q : But , whether justified or not , did the veto hurt the image of the United Nations ? A : It did hurt the image of the U.N. And I don ' t think the discussions and the information should have been leaked . If ( the U.N. ) had its own air wing , all discussions would have been internal . It is not unusual in a military situation for the commander to discuss all options and the majority of the commanders to say we are not going_on this . It is regrettable that such sensitive matters are discussed openly and get leaked . In fact , in some countries this would be grounds for court-martial . In fact , I made the point that if the Serbs and Bosnian army discussed their strategy openly in the press and in public , it would make the work of ( the U.N. ) and NATO very easy . ( Laughter ) Q : You don ' t have a military background . Do you feel at a disadvantage in not having a military background in this field ? A : No , I don ' t find it a particular disadvantage . I don ' t think it has kept me from carrying_on my role . I have learned a lot . I have very good military people with me . And perhaps in some situations , it is even an advantage . You ask questions , you don ' t take it for granted , and you don ' t know it all . So , in some ways , maybe it helps . It has not bothered me . It ' s quite interesting now that I ' ve been in this job for a while . You know the old adage , &quot; War is too serious a matter_to be left to the generals. &quot; Now that I ' m in this job , I have discovered something else . The generals are saying that use of force is too serious a matter_to be left to the civilians . ( Laughter ) Q : They are very reluctant . A : Absolutely , they are very reluctant , because they know the implications . Soldiers like to fight , but they don ' t like to declare war . It ' s fascinating . Q : If an American were in_charge of U.N. peacekeeping , do you think the United States would be more enthusiastic about going_into Rwanda ? A : I don ' t think so . I don ' t think it would make a difference . What makes a difference is the perception by the leaders as_to the popular will . And Somalia did quite a lot of damage . Having said that , I should also say that this is one area where we in the U.N. are very weak . . . with our public information . We are not_able to tell our stories , not even our success stories . Both in Somalia and Bosnia , we had difficulties . But we ' ve also made enormous contributions . . . . We know that , unless we can get the public to understand what we are doing and to get public support , we will not get the political will that we expect from the leaders. *</TEXT>
