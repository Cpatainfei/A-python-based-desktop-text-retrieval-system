   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES ; CAUTIONARY TALES ABOUT RELIGIOUS AGENDAS ; APPEALS TO UNIVERSAL VALUES MAY WORK BETTER WITH VOTERS THAN BIBLICAL QUOTATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Did religious communities play a positive role in last Tuesday ' s elections -- particularly at the local level -- or did they meddle unnecessarily and damage their credibility ? It appears that the survey of local candidates by Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa on specific moral issues ( abortion , gay rights , sexuality education ) backfired and forced the church to distance itself from the questionnaire . The majority of candidates didn ' t even respond because of the survey ' s narrow focus and demand for yes or no answers to complex questions . The Roman_Catholic_Church fought in vain to defeat Proposition 187 , as did the liberal Protestant California Council of Churches , which also supported Proposition 186 , for state health_insurance . To what extent are religious groups justified in becoming involved in politics ? To a considerable degree , according to Stephen Carter in his highly acclaimed 1993 book &quot; The Culture of Disbelief. &quot; He argues that religion is no hobby or extracurricular_activity and should have a place in the public_square . In fact , it is a &quot; very subversive force , &quot; particularly to those in America &quot; committed to the proposition that religious ways of looking_at the world do not count. &quot; Recent history proves Carter ' s point : The civil_rights movement was born and nurtured in the black churches of the south ; the anti-Vietnam War movement had a powerful base in the liberal churches and synagogues of the north ; and conservative Christians have catalyzed a national debate over abortion , euthanasia and gay rights . While I agree with Carter that religious groups should carry_out this &quot; subversive &quot; activity on behalf of the moral issues they feel so deeply about , they need to proceed with caution . I offer these guidelines : * Take a stand based on sound reasoning , not religious_doctrine . The public will be won_over not by biblical quotations interpreted in a sectarian way but by persuasive appeals_to universal values such_as decency and justice . * Stick_to relevant issues , especially at the local level . One of the Calvary Chapel queries to candidates for city or county government positions asked , &quot; Will you support laws restoring legal protection for unborn children from conception , with the possible exception that a medical procedure is necessary to prevent the mother ' s death ? &quot; Not only is this an issue having no bearing on the elected duties of a local_government official , it involves the most complex moral question of our time . What if the candidate is opposed to abortion except in cases of rape or incest ? Or is pro-choice , yet sees abortion as a option to be chosen only for the most serious of reasons , strongly preferring contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancies ? Does a yes or no answer suffice ? * Don ' t implicitly set_up a &quot; religious test &quot; for public office . Not only does the Constitution expressly forbid such tests , they are inherently repugnant to those of different religious backgrounds . Thus when Pat Robertson and his local counterparts in the Christian Coalition start talking_about electing &quot; Christians &quot; or the &quot; godly &quot; or &quot; Bible believers &quot; to public office , they are crossing the church-state boundary_line . * Educate voters by allowing candidates to explain briefly their positions rather than forcing them to answer &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; to complex questions . One of the yes-or-no questions to school_board candidates on the Calvary Chapel survey asked , &quot; Will you support an abstinence-only program that does not present premarital sex ( with or without contraceptives ) or abortion as responsible or acceptable options ? &quot; The candidates were expected to bubble in the &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; column and go right on to the next question . What I suspect many of them would like to have done is explain how complex the issue of premarital sexual_activity is , how abstinence is clearly the ideal and should be encouraged in all ways possible ; yet , how an estimated 80 % of teen-agers are sexually active by their senior year of high_school and need information about how to avoid unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases . If a religious organization really wishes to provide comprehensive voter information to its members , it might , for example , consider soliciting a short statement from school_board candidates on how they plan to improve the quality of learning and the safety of the school yard . Or a statement from the city_council candidates on how to promote new jobs in their districts . For , at root , these are questions with profound moral implications .</TEXT>
