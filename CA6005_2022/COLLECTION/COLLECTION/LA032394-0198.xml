   <HEADLINE> U.S. WILL KEEP PRESSING CHINA ON RIGHTS ; DIPLOMACY : OFFICIALS HOLD MEETING TO CLARIFY ADMINISTRATION STANCE . SOME HAD URGED A MORE CONCILIATORY APPROACH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After reviewing Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher ' s recent visit to Beijing , top Clinton_Administration officials decided Tuesday night to hold_fast to their policy of pressing for human_rights improvements in China , a senior Administration official said . There had been speculation in Washington that the Administration was preparing to change_course on China by de-emphasizing the issue of human_rights . The U.S. business_community is worried about losing out_to foreign competition in the Chinese market , and top officials of the National Economic Council and the Treasury and commerce_departments have been urging a more conciliatory approach to China . But after a nearly two-hour Cabinet-level meeting at the White_House , a State_Department source said the Administration has decided to stick_with its current human_rights policy . &quot; It was basically a reaffirmation of the approach we have been following up_to now , &quot; said the official , who supports Christopher ' s emphasis on human_rights . &quot; The bottom_line from the meeting was that we need to stay steady and to encourage China to make progress &quot; on human_rights . An executive order signed by President Clinton last year requires the Chinese government to make &quot; overall significant progress &quot; on human_rights by June to be eligible for a renewal of its most-favored-nation ( MFN ) trade benefits . The status permits China to export its goods into the United States under the same low tariff rates enjoyed by most other countries . When Christopher visited Beijing 10 days ago , Chinese leaders greeted him with stony hostility . Chinese security officials detained several dissidents before and during his trip . During the visit , Premier Li Peng warned Christopher that China has its own concept of human_rights and will never submit to U.S. pressure for change . But Tuesday in Beijing , after weeks of tough talk from the Chinese regime about America , Li said China will make &quot; great efforts &quot; to improve its relations with the United States . &quot; Generally speaking , I do not feel pessimistic about the prospects of Sino-U.S. relations , &quot; Li told a news_conference Tuesday at the close of a session of the Chinese Congress . &quot; I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that China is willing to improve Sino-U.S. relations , &quot; Li said in a prepared statement . &quot; We have made great efforts to improve relations and will continue to do so. &quot; U.S. business_leaders in Beijing had expressed their dismay with the Administration ' s policy of linking a renewal of China ' s MFN benefits to improvements in human_rights . Last week , Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen suggested to reporters in Honolulu that America needs to change its approach to ensure that it is not &quot; disengaging &quot; from China . &quot; I think we have to explore alternatives to see if we can work this out , &quot; he said . Tuesday ' s White_House session was designed to iron_out differences within the Administration to ensure that China will not get conflicting messages . President Clinton was not present at the meeting , a State_Department source said . But it is possible he will make a public statement soon to affirm that the China policy has not changed in the aftermath of Christopher ' s trip . The Administration also has been moving to shore_up support for its human_rights approach , both in Congress and among Chinese students and dissidents . Sen . Claiborne Pell ( D-R.I. ) , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , took_to the Senate floor Tuesday to defend Christopher . He asserted that the secretary ' s visit to Beijing &quot; was a necessary one , for it underscored to a Chinese audience too used to the accolades of businessmen the importance of human_rights to American foreign policy. &quot; Zhao Haiqing , a former student leader who works with Chinese dissidents in the United States , said he was organizing a letter-writing campaign to defend the Administration ' s linkage of MFN benefits and human_rights . Zhao said extending China ' s trade benefits without any human-rights conditions &quot; will be devastating for the democracy movement in China . It will really give a strong hand to the hard-liners . The hard-liners will be able to have their way inside China. &quot;</TEXT>
