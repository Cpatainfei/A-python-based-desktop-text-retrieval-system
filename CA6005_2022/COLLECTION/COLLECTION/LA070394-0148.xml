   <HEADLINE> UNCHARITABLE TIMES FOR CHARITIES ; NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO REMIND RESIDENTS OF THEIR DEEDS , AND NEEDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It has been all too apparent to charities , and perhaps to the people who benefit from them , that times have been extremely hard of late . Blame it on the recession and the lethargic recovery . Blame it on a succession of natural disasters that have so infringed upon our collective ability to give that donations have been much lower across the board . Examples abound , such_as the plight of the Antelope Valley chapter of the American Red_Cross . It is attempting to build a state-of-the-art headquarters , strong enough to withstand an 8.0 magnitude earthquake . The chapter has run_out of money for the project and faces many problems in trying to raise enough money to finish it . Another unfortunate symbol involves the United Way ' s North Angeles Region . The chapter has severely trimmed its grants to dozens of worthwhile regional projects , even as it attempts to respond to growing priorities in new areas of need . The reason ? United Way officials were faced with a fourth consecutive year of fewer contributions . Under such circumstances , it makes_sense to take_note of groups that are managing to swim against this tide . A case_in_point is the Santa Clarita Valley Boys &amp; Girls Club . Officials there say that they have raised $ 150 # 000 in their annual auction , which is the Santa Clarita chapter ' s primary fund-raising event . That is the largest sum they have raised at the auction since 1990 . What gives ? Perhaps it is explained , in part , by the fact that people in Santa Clarita got_to know the Boys &amp; Girls Club there very well in January , when it served as an earthquake shelter for the American Red_Cross . When it was time to consider the club ' s needs , people remembered its role after the quake , and they dug a little deeper . Also , Judy Belue , director of development for the club , said that &quot; people in this community believe we can prevent problems and turn some kids around . We had a lot of success stories to share. &quot; So there may be unique circumstances in this fund-raising success story that would be difficult to duplicate . Still , it ' s important to note that the club has done a particularly good job of convincing people that it serves an important role . For children and teen-agers -- ages 7 to 17 -- it is a safe gathering place on weekdays and evenings . It is a place where the children of single parents can get tutoring and attention until those parents are free_of their employment obligations . In business , the time to maintain advertising can be the very time in which money seems to be tight . The same is true for groups that depend_on charitable donations . Perhaps now is the time to remind people of the good works that they do .</TEXT>
