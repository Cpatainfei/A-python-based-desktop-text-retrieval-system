   <HEADLINE> A POST-MODERNIST CALIFORNIA IS BORN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the minimalist mid-1990s -- so fraught with peril and an odd , defiant kind of hope -- emerges the necessity of deliberate choice , of making California happen once again , as a matter of vision and will . Like the pioneers of the mid-19th Century , like the Californians of the Depression era , today ' s challenge is reassembling , renewing and re-earning the commonwealth . In the past , California might have glistened on the shores of the Pacific as an assured utopia : a place of unrivaled beauty and economic opportunity , where daily life could be better -- much better -- for ordinary Americans . This notion had deep historical roots and resulted in the development of California through a sequence of booms , from the Gold_Rush to the post-World War II economic explosion . What drove Americans and then , increasingly from the 1960s onward , non-Americans to choose California as their destined place ? When Crenner and Lee Bradley , African-Americans from Texas , arrived in Los Angeles in 1924 , they found no easy increment . Crenner went_to work as a maid , Lee found work as a Pullman_porter on the Santa Fe . Yet , for all_the difficulties the Bradley family faced , their son , Tom , a studious boy devoted to his brothers and sisters , gained admission to Polytechnic High_School in 1934 ( one of 113 African-Americans among 1 # 300 students ) and went_on to UCLA . The fact is , people like the Bradleys believed they could do_better in California , and , despite the apocalyptic musings of Nathanael West , most did . In 1849 , they came_to escape the confines and certainties of New England villages and small-town life in the Old_South . In the 1880s , they came , like Harry Chandler , to recover from lung disease in the sunny climate . In the 1920s , a generation of rural Midwesterners and Southwesterners , like the Bradleys , came_to enjoy the benefits and amenities of suburban life : especially the chance to own a home . After World_War_II , millions came , delighted that they had survived the war . They came_to possess and repossess the American_Dream in the biggest possible way . By 1948 , Gov . Earl Warren was writing in the Saturday Evening Post that California would have to build millions of housing units , thousands of schools , and thousands and thousands of miles of roadways and freeways if it were to accommodate the millions of Americans pouring into the Golden State . There were jobs aplenty , so many of them in defense-related industries , which , since 1941 , had been providing a continuing steroid boost to the economy . Innumerable K-12 plants had sprung_up since the school-building boom initiated by Warren in 1948 . The Master_Plan for Higher Education pushed_through by Gov . Edmund G . ( Pat ) Brown Sr. , in 1960 , offered a menu of choices : academic and / or vocational_training in junior_colleges , a state college system exfoliating campuses across the commonwealth , a UC system pushing toward nine campuses . Developers were bringing_on line millions of residential units , the vast majority of them within the economic reach of working Californians . A newly completed freeway system whizzed Californians to and from work with little delay , and , somewhere in the subliminal distance , the Beach Boys were always singing of a land of youth and leisure on the shores of the sundown sea . It was easy then to become or to remain a Californian ; indeed , California embodied what the 18th-Century Anglo-Irish parliamentarian and philosopher Edmund Burke called &quot; the unbought grace of life &quot; -- the gifts of beauty and abundance , which seemed to come at no cost . Sometime in late 1989 and early 1990 , however , just as the Berlin Wall was disassembled , a tragic sense of life entered the California consciousness : a sense that boom times , the easy times , were yielding to an era of transformation and challenge . Not that the tragic sense of life was previously absent from the consciousness of Californians . For Latino-Californians , resident in California since 1769 , Americanization had its tragic dimension , especially the Land Act passed_by the Yankees , which forced each Latino landowner to prove his or her title to ownership of property . Land lawyers prospered as Latino-Californians sold_off their properties or bartered them away to pay their legal bills . In the 1850s , cholera could wipe_out an entire wagon_train . The Depression of 1873 filled San Francisco with unemployed transients and rendered portions of the population homeless . The World_War I era migration included many Japanese , who were forbidden by the alien land laws of 1913 and 1920 to own property . The agonies of the Dust_Bowl migration speak_for themselves . Yet , never did these sectors of suffering overwhelm the image of the state . The consciousness that arose some four to five years ago , by contrast , put the entire California Dream in_question . Many non-Californians , ever envious of California ' s international notoriety as the American_Dream writ_large , pounced on any number of defaults , depressions or disturbances -- the agony of the defense industry after the collapse of the Cold_War , the rise of ethnic antagonisms , especially as expressed in gang culture and behavior , the riots , looting and burning of 1992 , the fires , the flood , the Northridge earthquake -- as proof positive that California was finished , kaput , road-kill , history . This is not the case . For amid all these difficulties , the economic and social fabric of California has begun to mend itself and gather new strength . California is doing this , however , having absorbed the tragic sense of life . More_than 100 years ago , the greatest philosophical mind ever to be produced by California , Josiah Royce , wrote that it was in the struggle for corrective action against human weakness , natural failures and tragic loss that Californians made connection with their best possible social and moral selves . California , Royce wrote , was not an escape_from history , from tragic experience . California was , rather , a headlong plunge into the very promise and perils of America itself . Flaws , failures , tragedy constituted essential components of the California formula . Here was no unmitigated idyll , no brainless Eden . Here was the moral challenge of the American Republic -- only more so . Never again , perhaps , will California experience the affluence , the easy times that extended through the 1980s . But will not the necessities of choice and action in hard_times bring_to California a certain depth , a resilience and tenacity of character that it somehow lost sight of in the decades of easy living ? This newly emergent post-modernist California , flawed but persistent in its corrective struggle , promises to be of even more importance to the larger American experiment than the easy-living California now receding into the distant past . After all , is not California , among other things , the prism through which America glimpses its unfolding identity ? And is not that unfolding identity , like California , conditioned by new peoples and a scarcity of resources ? The ancient_Greeks believed that scarcity and fate were one_and_the_same . Only when one chose amid narrow options , the Greeks believed -- indeed , chose to do that which must be done -- was one truly free . In re-earning California , in reassembling and revitalizing the embattled California Dream , Californians will create for themselves a commonwealth , ecumenical and energized by hope , that will once again , in completely new circumstances , help renew the larger American experiment .</TEXT>
