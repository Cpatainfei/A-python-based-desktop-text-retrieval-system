   <HEADLINE> SMART POLITICS , MEXICAN AMERICAN-STYLE : MOST WILL NOT VOTE ON ELECTION_DAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A friend of mine , an African American fireman in San Francisco , thinks that Mexican Americans are smart because most of us don ' t bother to vote . On the other hand , my Mexican mother frets . Unlike Texas or New Mexico , which have older , more politically active Latino populations , California has only lately begun to see Latinos running_for school_boards or city_halls . California has yet to see one of its own Mexican American politicians assume statewide or national stature . And , even this year , when so_much of the political debate concerns Mexico and Mexicans , most of us will not vote . My mother thinks that Mexican Americans have made themselves easy prey for ambitious politicians . My friend , the black fireman , by contrast , thinks the biggest mistake black Americans have made is believing_in politics and politicians . &quot; We have black mayors , black congressmen -- there are blacks everywhere among the political elites -- but what has our belief in politics gotten us , except for the assumption that the government would somehow solve our problems ? &quot; Two weeks ago , in one of the largest demonstrations ever seen in Los Angeles , an estimated 70 # 000 people marched against Proposition 187 -- the measure that would deny government assistance , including medical and educational , to illegal immigrants and their children . Organizers of the demonstration were ecstatic at the size of the crowd . Here , surely , was the galvanic moment of Mexican American political consciousness in California ! Other Californians were not so sure . They wondered why so many of the demonstrators were carrying Mexican flags . Mexican Americans are notorious in the United States for not cutting their apron_strings to Mexico . They violate the American habit of amnesia . We remain mama ' s boys , attached_to memory , unwilling to abandon our hyphen . On the other hand , Mexican Americans are quick to take offense . Since when does affection for Mexico mean one cannot be a loyal American ? Mexican Americans proudly name their fathers and grandfathers who have fought in U.S. wars . Mexican Americans won more Purple_Hearts in the Second_World_War than any other ethnic_group . The fact remains : Because of proximity to memory , because of the 19th-Century rivalry between the two countries , Mexican Americans have had a complicated relationship to Mexico and to America . If today , U.S. politicians assume that Mexican Americans are not a threat on Election_Day , our Mexican grandmothers never let us forget that we speak bad Spanish , they scold us for our gringo ways , for not being Mexican enough . Though Latinos constitute nearly 30 % of California ' s population , we number fewer than 10 % of the state ' s eligible voters . Many within that 10 % will not bother to vote . The politicians are counting_on it . The irony is that , this summer , after decades of political indifference , Mexicans in huge numbers lined_up to vote_in their nation ' s presidential election . Eighty percent of Mexico ' s eligible voters stood_for hours , many under the unblinking sun , to vote . In California , proponents of Proposition 187 have framed their argument in terms of welfare dollars . But for many Latinos , the issue of immigration is all about jobs . Surely , the most interesting pre-election polls indicate that large_numbers , perhaps even the majority , of Latinos will vote_in favor of Proposition 187 . Should that be so very surprising ? For decades in California , there has been a competition for jobs between native-born Latinos and newly arrived immigrants . The newcomer was willing to work for the lowest wage , the newcomer was always trying to find room in the overcrowded barrio , the newcomer posed the greatest threat to Latinos only one rung_up the ladder . I know a Mexican American who works as a border_patrolman along the San Ysidro corridor . He loathes Mexico . His father fled the corruption of Mexico , its politics and its cynicism . Now , the border_patrolman is horrified to see Mexico approaching , every night approaching , on his green radar screen . On the other side of line , what Mexican kids will tell you is that there are two Californias . As workers and consumers , these kids will be welcomed and used in Los Angeles . But as outlaws ( &quot; illegals &quot; ) , they will be methodically hunted . Mexicans are accustomed to the double_standard . For decades , there have been two ways in Mexico . There has been the realm of the public , the official -- the listed_price or written law . In fact , however , official means negotiable , capable of being subverted by private transaction , bartering in the marketplace , a bribe in jail . In the United States , Mexicans have come_to regard official prohibitions as just that : official -- an inconvenience to their lives in private America . Mexicans thus see right through America ' s hypocrisy . On the 11 o ' clock news , the politician complains about illegal immigrants ; in his private life , the politician employs an illegal immigrant as a nanny . Mexicans are not surprised . The kid in Tijuana -- tomorrow an &quot; illegal &quot; in California -- says he intends no disrespect of U.S. law . But there is a job at a dry_cleaners in Glendale . If he gets arrested tonight , he will try tomorrow . The determination registers not so_much defiance of the law as a patience with it , tempered with certainty that the law does not describe the way life actually is . My African American friend , the fireman in San Francisco , says : &quot; Everywhere you look now in California , you can see Mexicans working. &quot; ( We are sitting in a cafe for yuppies where the woman at the expresso machine , the busboy , the dishwasher -- everyone but the cafe owner -- is Latino. ) If it turns_out , as expected , that most Latinos in California will not vote this time around , perhaps that is only because Latinos have anticipated what many other Americans are only coming_to realize : Washington is irrelevant to our real_lives ; Sacramento is irrelevant . The womanizing politician preaches to us about family values . Another politician who complains about welfare mothers cannot tell us why his own children listen to black rap ; he promises us more jails as a solution to what ails America . Not a_few political observers have noted how eerie it is this year watching the candidates for the U.S. Senate and for the governor ' s office , listening to their debates , watching their handlers , their supporters . None of these people look_like California is beginning to look -- the United Colors of Benneton -- on the streets and freeways . California ' s political life is in danger of becoming a white masque . My Mexican mother is furious at the politicians . She is frustrated that many Mexican Americans will not bother to cast an answering ballot . And the politicians will take_advantage of Mexican apathy . My mother is right . But it is also apparent this year , as never before , that when politicians and politics are no longer connected to actual lives , our politicians and their coveted power may ultimately be in greatest jeopardy. *</TEXT>
