   <HEADLINE> ADMINISTRATION REJECTS CALLS TO SHORTEN MISSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Clinton_Administration officials on Sunday appealed for time for U.S. troops to establish order in impoverished Haiti and rejected suggestions that the United States must alter or shorten its military_mission in the Caribbean nation in the wake of the weekend violence and chaos that broke_out in Haiti ' s second-largest city . Administration officials said that , from the outset of the Haiti mission , they had anticipated the very kind of incident that occurred in Cap Haitien , where U.S. Marines killed 10 Haitian police_officers Saturday night and an emboldened mob ransacked the local police facilities Sunday , seizing arms and turning them over to American forces . Commenting on the Saturday night firefight , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry and Joint Chiefs_of_Staff Chairman Gen . John M . Shalikashvili said in separate interviews that such incidents should not prompt Congress to immediately set a firm date for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Haiti , as some members are beginning to favor doing . Perry , speaking on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet the Press &quot; news_show , called the Cap Haitien firefight &quot; typical of what we expected to see &quot; and warned that troops will continue to encounter sporadic resistance from Haitian soldiers , police or paramilitary supporters . Shalikashvili asserted that setting a date for American troops to depart Haiti &quot; creates a dynamic on the ground &quot; that complicates the U.S. mission , helps America ' s adversaries and puts American forces at a disadvantage . In a brief statement , the White_House said , &quot; We regret any loss of life in connection with our mission in Haiti , &quot; but added : &quot; We will continue to work with Haitian military authorities for a peaceful transition. &quot; But Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said a Senate resolution will be introduced this week directing the Administration to end the initial , unilateral phase of the U.S. mission in Haiti by a date to be specified , probably several months away . He said he believes the resolution will pass . Nunn -- part of former President Jimmy_Carter ' s delegation that negotiated an agreement last week with the Haitian junta , allowing the peaceful landing of U.S. troops -- said he hopes the Senate measure will provide &quot; some flexibility for the President. &quot; But Nunn added : &quot; Hopefully , we ' ll be able to turn this mission over to the U.N. at an early date. &quot; He said the U.S. military must_not allow itself to be pulled into rebuilding and democratizing Haiti . That , he said , is a job for the Haitians and the United Nations after the Americans establish order and security . But Madeleine Albright -- the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , who was briefed on the_matter -- sought to downplay the happenings in Cap Haitien , saying : &quot; That was one incident in what has been , I think , an amazingly successful operation . I think Congress is afraid that we are into something open-ended , when we know very clearly that we are not . . . . Every day , I think , has brought progress . That is not to say there have not been bumps in the road and will not be bumps in the road. &quot; Members of Congress , though , expressed growing doubts about the U.S. involvement in Haiti after the weekend incidents . Rep . Newt Gingrich , a leading Republican lawmaker from Georgia , said the House will take_up a resolution calling_for a rapid withdrawal of American forces from Haiti , perhaps by a firm date . He predicted &quot; substantial support &quot; for the measure . &quot; You just had a firefight last night . None of those 10 Haitian families who just lost somebody are going_to love Americans more , &quot; Gingrich said on CBS-TV ' s &quot; Face the Nation &quot; news_show . &quot; None of their friends are going_to love Americans more . . . . I don ' t think they ( U.S. soldiers ) want to wait around for ambushes and for booby_traps and for all_the things that can go wrong. &quot; In a development that may help buy the Administration some breathing room , Jean-Bertrand Aristide , Haiti ' s exiled president , declared Sunday that he will convene an extraordinary session of Haiti ' s Parliament on Wednesday to consider granting amnesty for the military rulers who ousted him . The agreement accepted last week by Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the Haitian strongman , and Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby , the army chief_of_staff , provided_for them to relinquish power when an amnesty was granted , or by Oct . 15 , whichever came first . Aristide supporters have expressed severe reservations about any action that would exempt members of the Haitian military and police from all punishment for their abuses and repression since the September , 1991 , coup . &quot; We hope that the security situation will be such_that the Parliament can convene and that the parliamentarians currently in exile in the United States can return to Haiti , &quot; said Gwen McKinney , an Aristide spokeswoman . President Clinton , in remarks at a church in New York , observed about Haiti : &quot; I think more and more Americans are seeing that what we are doing there is good and supports democracy throughout our hemisphere , which is nothing more_than saying our neighborhood. &quot; Administration officials have said they intend to phase_out the initial U.S. mission as early as possible . The 13 # 000 U.S. troops now in Haiti will increase to 14 # 000 or 15 # 000 soon , but that force will be reduced in a_few months &quot; as the security situation gets established , &quot; Perry said Sunday . Times staff writer Paul Richter in New York contributed to this report .</TEXT>
