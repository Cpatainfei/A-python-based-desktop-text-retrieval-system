   <HEADLINE> U.S. COMPUTER FIRMS HAVE JAPAN LOOKING WEST ; TECHNOLOGY : LOWER PRICES AND A SHIFT TO THE IBM STANDARD HAVE HELPED AMERICANS MAKE INROADS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Masaru Murai , president of Compaq Computer ' s Japanese subsidiary , apologetically guides a visitor past piles of computers in the halls and offices of the company ' s headquarters . &quot; We ' ve been growing faster than we expected and don ' t have enough space , &quot; he says . So fast that after only two years in Japan , Compaq K.K. must move to larger quarters . Japanese personal_computer companies have watched their sales slump in the sluggish Japanese economy . But Compaq , Apple and other U.S. computer makers are finding eager consumers in the world ' s second-largest computer market . Last year , American companies ' share of the Japanese PC market climbed from 15.1 % to 24.2 % , according to Dataquest , a market research firm . Each has taken a different route to higher sales , but together they have profoundly changed Japan ' s PC market . &quot; It ' s an anxious time for Japan ' s computer_industry , &quot; says Takahiko Umeyama , an analyst for market researcher IDC Japan Ltd . &quot; It needs to change because of the foreign vendors , but the changes are very difficult to make. &quot; Several factors are weakening the once-invincible claim Japanese PC makers had_on their home turf . Since cheaper American PCs were introduced in Japan two years ago , computer prices have dropped more_than 60 % . Japanese makers , who once were able to keep prices high by splintering the domestic market with non-compatible designs , are shifting to the worldwide IBM standard . Dealers and distributors once wed to a single maker have begun selling other brands , including imports . Japan ' s market still has plenty of room for growth . The average Japanese office has 10 PCs per 100 employees , contrasted with about 42 per 100 in the United States , IDC says . If wapuro -- the dedicated word_processors used widely to handle Japan ' s complex writing_system -- are included , the total is 16 machines per 100 workers . But as PC prices drop , Japanese are beginning to buy computers to replace the word_processors . The biggest winner so far has been Apple . Apple entered the Japanese market in 1983 but for years languished with expatriate managers , high prices and an exclusive distribution network . &quot; We thought it was the same market as the United States and tried selling the same computers , &quot; says John Floisand , president of Apple Pacific and acting president of Apple Japan Inc. &quot; It took us until 1988 to discover what it took_in terms of Japanese-language application software. &quot; Macintosh sales began taking_off in 1989 when a new Japanese management team signed_up dozens of new dealers , introduced an improved Japanese-language operating_system and encouraged development of Japanese software . In Tokyo ' s Akihabara electronics retailing district , it is now the rare shop that does not display the Apple logo . Nationwide , Apple has 3 # 000 resellers . that ' s still far short of market leader NEC Corp. ' s 8 # 000 outlets . NEC ' s proprietary models still dominate the market with a 52.8 % share -- a slip of 0.6 percentage_point from a year ago . But Apple ' s market share rose from 8.3 % to 13.9 % last year , displacing Fujitsu as the second-largest PC supplier , Dataquest says . IBM Japan , meanwhile , wrested fourth place from Toshiba with 6.7 % .</TEXT>
