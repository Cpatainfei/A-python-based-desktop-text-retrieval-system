   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN ALBUM : DIVE ! DIVE ! IDEA HATCHED FOR SUNKEN U-BOAT PARK ; THE RUBBER-COATED GERMAN SUB LIES IN THE POTOMAC . HISTORY BUFFS COULD COME CALLING IN SCUBA GEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sheathed in a layer of black rubber to avoid sonar detection , the German World_War_II U-boat known as the Black Panther served as a model of hit-and-run efficiency , always able to evade Allied counterstrikes thanks to clever German engineering . That same U-boat now sits dead on the floor of the Potomac_River near the coast of Maryland , a victim of U.S. experimentation and study that scuttled the submarine in 1949 . Yet efforts to bring life to the sunken U-1105 are under way as Maryland state officials work with the Navy to develop the country ' s first underwater diving park featuring a sunken WWII vessel . Don ' t let the word park fool you . The actual 85-foot dive will be restricted to experienced divers because of the swift currents and low visibility in the Potomac_River , said Maryland Historical Trust archeologist Richard Hughes , who is responsible_for the park ' s development . Divers will not be allowed inside the vessel out of concerns for their safety and preservation of the vessel . &quot; Our job is to protect the Navy heritage , &quot; said Dr. William S . Dudley , senior historian at the Naval Historical Center . &quot; We really are dealing here with elements of the past. &quot; The U-boat is the property of the federal_government . To appease history buffs who are not divers , a small visitors center probably will be created at a nearby lighthouse , featuring exhibits , historical information , artifacts , photos and diver-made videos of the submarine , Hughes said . Launched on April 20 , 1944 , the Black Panther was one of only 10 U-boats coated with four millimeters of synthetic_rubber designed to absorb sonar instead of reflecting it back to Allied ships . The U-1105 patrolled the west coast of Ireland on its only war patrol in April , 1945 , engaging enemy destroyers several times in attacks that left one ship badly damaged . To avoid detection , the U-boat descended to the ocean_floor . Allied vessels engaged in a furious search , setting hundreds of depth_charges , but the submarine survived . At the war ' s end a month later , the U-boat surrendered to British forces and was eventually turned_over to the United States for study . The vessel was scuttled as part of a Navy explosives research test . To create the park , the trust is seeking $ 100 # 000 from a Defense_Department fund for preserving historical sites . A number of states already have underwater parks featuring shipwrecks caused by war or accidents . The trust is examining those parks as possible models for the U-boat park . The dive probably would begin with a trip to the location , marked by a buoy , where divers would be able to follow a single line 85 feet down in muddy water to the sunken vessel , Hughes said . Once there , divers would see the 50-year-old submarine ' s conning tower , still in good_condition and the only portion of the U-boat not extensively covered in silt . Sections of the submarine most likely will be marked_off for easy identification , and there is a possibility of installing a surveillance_system to protect the vessel from vandals and collectors . If it weren ' t for a resourceful Virginia computer technician , the sub ' s location would remain a mystery . Fredericksburg resident Uwe Lovas , who said he became interested in shipwrecks as a child , discovered the sunken sub after stumbling upon a Navy error in records of the vessel ' s location . Lovas happened_upon the mistake in early 1985 while searching for a possible shipwreck that he and two other divers could explore . Lovas wondered why the Black Panther would have been sunk_in waters several hundred miles off the coast of Virginia , where the U.S. Naval Ordinance Disposal Unit and School recorded it . To Lovas ' excitement , he determined that the report had transposed the longitude figure , from 76 degrees to 67 degrees . The U-boat , he found , was actually just 70 miles from his home . Lovas , his brother , Ron , and a friend , Alan Russell , searched in the area three times before being able to tie a line onto the wreck and explore it . &quot; Most shipwrecks decay rapidly , but this has not suffered that kind of decay , &quot; Lovas said , noting that the fresh_waters of the Potomac have been gentler than the seawater enveloping most wrecks . The divers kept quiet about the discovery for five years before inviting U-boat historian Henry Keatts and a photographer to explore it with them . Keatts then documented the find in a diving magazine . That article subsequently found its way to Maryland state officials , who began working with the Navy to establish the park . No date has been set for the park ' s opening , although Hughes said it could occur sometime in the next 18 months .</TEXT>
