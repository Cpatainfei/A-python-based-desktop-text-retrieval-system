   <HEADLINE> EL PASO PLAN DETERS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ; BORDER : A FEDERAL STUDY FINDS OPERATION HOLD-THE-LINE EFFECTIVE . BUT RESEARCHERS SAY IT CAUSES STAFFING AND MORALE PROBLEMS FOR AGENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A concerted Border_Patrol effort to stop illegal immigration in El Paso is a substantial deterrent to illegal crossings and has led to small drops_in school enrollments and crime_rates , according to researchers working for the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform . Researchers also give Operation Hold-the-Line credit for significant decreases in allegations of human_rights violations and other abuses by the Border_Patrol , and the effort seems to enjoy strong public support , even among the Mexican American community . But the study also finds that the redeployment of agents causes staffing and morale problems and that the enforcement strategy is not a single , all-purpose solution to stemming large_numbers of illegal immigrants crossing U.S. borders . Indeed , the report found that illegal immigrants intent_on long-distance crossings were largely unaffected by the enforcement technique and adapted by finding new routes into the United States . The report , to be issued by the federal commission today , makes_it clear that merely stopping illegal immigration at the border is only one part of a complex problem . &quot; To the extent that Operation Hold-the-Line is successful in curtailing illegal crossings . . . perhaps it will also serve to focus increased attention on the need to facilitate legal crossings , &quot; the study found . For instance , some of the pressure to cross illegally is caused by lengthy delays at legal crossing points , highlighting the need for more Immigration and Naturalization Service administrative personnel , the researchers said . &quot; What is really needed is borders that work , &quot; said Frank D . Bean , leader of the group of researchers at the University of Texas at Austin that performed the study . Bean , a University of Texas professor of demographics , has been studying immigration policy for 15 years . He previously worked for the Urban Institute in Washington . He and six other members of the Population Research_Center at the Austin campus spent about eight months poring over official records and collecting anecdotal material on the effects of Operation Hold-the-Line . Although some politicians have called_for the INS to launch such an operation at the San Diego border , some immigration officials have said Operation Hold-the-Line is_better suited to El Paso ' s topography and immigrant population and not easily duplicated in Southern California . The INS , however , has said it intends to bring the strategy to San Diego . Agency officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday . Operation Hold-the-Line began in September , 1993 , and was aimed at a 20-mile stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border between El Paso and Juarez , where illegal crossings were estimated at 8 # 000 a day . Its original name , Operation Blockade , was dropped because of its negative connotation . Previously , the Border_Patrol there had allowed relatively unhindered movements across the Rio Grande , hoping to intercept illegal crossers already in the city . Under the new strategy , agents saturated the border to cut_off illegal immigration at its source . After the operation began in September , 1993 , apprehensions declined from 700 a day to about 200 a day . The nine-member federal immigration commission , created by the Immigration Act of 1990 , has been working for more_than two years on a comprehensive report to Congress on a wide range of immigration issues . Chaired by former Texas Rep . Barbara Jordan , the commission report is_due Sept . 30 . The commission requested the study on the El Paso program because it was concerned about a lack of hard data on the new , preventive border strategy . &quot; The commission is going_through the study very carefully , &quot; said Susan Martin , the group ' s executive_director . &quot; We had received some preliminary reports on ( Operation Hold-the-Line ) . . . and it ' s a pleasant surprise that the Texas team was able to confirm those early findings . They ' ve developed a very clever methodology , and the commission hopes it can be a broader model ( to evaluate ) other border strategies. &quot; The Texas researchers had to inch toward some of their conclusions . &quot; You have to take trends into account , &quot; said Bean . &quot; There does seem to be a small effect on certain types of crimes , especially property crime . But it ' s not at all_clear that Mexicans were committing these crimes . The decrease may have been caused by a transfer of police units . &quot; Some of the school findings were even more tentative . ( But ) when you take four or five indicators together , they start to suggest something. &quot; The nearly 200-page report also found that : * The deterrent effect seems to have lessened as the operation has continued . * Some illegal immigrants appear to have changed their daily border-crossing pattern and have extended their stays in El Paso . * Illegal immigrants who work as street vendors and small-scale , petty criminals have been substantially deterred from crossing . * Business_activity in El Paso and Juarez does not appear to have suffered during the operation . * The rate of seizure of illegal drugs and other contraband has increased . The bulk of the report is positive , but the commission also cites several potential problem areas . The study concluded that Operation Hold-the-Line was better at controlling localized immigration patterns in El Paso but ineffective at slowing long-distance labor migration . The toll on Border_Patrol agents was significant . The strategy locks agents into long periods of inactivity in fixed holding positions , causing boredom and anxiety , the study found . The saturation strategy is very labor-intensive and has &quot; stretched to the limit the ability of the El Paso sector to carry_out ( its ) functions , &quot; researchers said . Long before the commission released the study ' s findings , Operation Hold-the-Line had caught the attention of California politicians . Rep . Duncan Hunter ( R-El Cajon ) has been a leader in sealing the Mexican border by building better access_roads and an improved border fence . In September , he called_on Atty . Gen . Janet Reno to replicate Operation Hold-the-Line along the San Diego-Tijuana border . &quot; The success of the El Paso operation demonstrates that it is possible to seal the border , &quot; Hunter said . &quot; For years naysayers have said that what has been accomplished in El Paso was impossible. &quot; Holding the Line Here are selected findings from a study on Operation Hold-the-Line , a tough , preventive Border_Patrol strategy to stop illegal immigration in El Paso . The report is to be released today by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform . PROS * Illegal crossings have been substantially deterred . * Illegal immigrants engaged in street vending and small-scale crime have been discouraged from crossing border . * Charges of human_rights violations by the Border_Patrol have declined . * The strategy has broad public support , including from the Mexican American community . * The operation has led to small declines in school enrollment and numbers of births . CONS * Long-distance labor migration has shifted to other border crossings . * Seems more effective at deterring temporary crossers whose destinations are U.S. border communities . * Redeployment and longer individual shifts have eroded morale among agents . * Strategy is labor-intensive and expansion of program would stretch present resources . * Deterrent effect has lessened as operation continues .</TEXT>
