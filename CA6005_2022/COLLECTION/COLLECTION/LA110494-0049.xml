   <HEADLINE> ATLANTIS LIFTS OFF ON MISSION TO STUDY EARTH ' S ATMOSPHERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Space shuttle Atlantis and its six astronauts blasted_off Thursday on an 11-day voyage to study Earth ' s atmosphere , including the ozone_layer and its gaping hole over the Antarctic . The weather at the shuttle emergency_landing site in Morocco improved enough to allow Atlantis to lift_off at 9 a.m. PST , four minutes late . &quot; The Earth looks just as beautiful as it always did , &quot; commander Donald McMonagle said upon reaching orbit . The five Americans and one Frenchman aboard quickly began preparing_for the atmospheric observations from their 190-mile-high orbit . The shuttle is carrying seven instruments from the United States and Europe that will scour the stratosphere for ozone and other chemicals and examine solar_energy . Scientists are particularly interested in the ozone_hole over the Antarctic that forms every fall . The hole is 9 million square_miles this year , about the size of North_America . To study the hole , the shuttle will fly above a point just south of Cape Horn , at the tip of South_America . The ozone_layer is essential to life on Earth . It protects humans and other organisms from the sun ' s ultraviolet rays . The mission is the seventh and final shuttle flight of the year , but the first by Atlantis since 1992 . The ship ' s modifications included installation of wiring needed for Atlantis to dock with Russia ' s space_station Mir next May . Atlantis also is carrying a German satellite with infrared telescopes for studying the atmosphere . The crew will release it today and retrieve it eight days later . Before capturing the satellite , the shuttle pilots will practice a rendezvous technique for next year ' s Mir dockings .</TEXT>
