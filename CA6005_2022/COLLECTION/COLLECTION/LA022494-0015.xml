   <HEADLINE> LOST IN O.C. : GIVING OR RECEIVING AN EARFUL , JUST FOR EFFECT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I ' ve been having an etiquette problem . How do you tell someone that her gift to you , to put it kindly , sucks sprinkler heads ? Yes , I know , the easiest and kindest thing would be to never bring it up , but I suspect there might be another dozen volumes of the thing that she might continue to give me if I say nothing . I ' ve thought this through every which way , and decided that if I ' m going_to bring it up , hurting feelings and possibly jeopardizing a friendship , I might as well get paid_for it . You see , the gift in_question is a CD of 75 sound_effects , and it was given to me by the editor of this column , who fortunately is such a professional that she ' d never let a thing like this interfere with her editing abilities . She meant well . It isn ' t like the CD she bought is titled &quot; 75 Really Miserable Sound Effects. &quot; Instead they put spectacular in the title , over a photo of fireworks exploding . The problem is , most of the effects aren ' t that different from each other , and they all sound like they could have been recorded around the house . For example , everything from &quot; Chopping Tree &quot; to &quot; Galloping Horses &quot; to &quot; Pinball_Machine &quot; to &quot; Heartbeat &quot; sounds suspiciously to me like it might actually be &quot; Man Cracking Walnuts With His Shoe , &quot; while &quot; Indian War_Whoops &quot; should more realistically be titled &quot; Squeaky Fan Belt. &quot; You get_the_picture : &quot; Roaring Lion , &quot; &quot; Tropical Rainfall &quot; and &quot; Dog Growling &quot; sound like home recordings of &quot; Root_Beer Up Nose , &quot; &quot; Bacon in Shower &quot; and &quot; Bob Dornan on C-Span , &quot; respectively . I must admit , though , that &quot; Women Laughing &quot; sounds disquietingly like a confab of my former girlfriends , preserved forever in the handy compact_disc format . Aside from being wretched , the CD was quite an insightful gift , since tucked_away in my garage I have a sizable stack of sound-effects albums , including sub-genres like steam_engine reveries , race_car engines -- I ' m not kidding , I have a whole album of early ' 60s guys revving their motors -- and those &quot; environmental &quot; creaking-masts-in-a-rain-forest records . * You never know when in life you ' ll need a good sound_effect , so I keep hundreds of them at_the_ready . Unfortunately , the sounds that might be most apropos to one ' s career , such_as &quot; Sniveling &quot; and &quot; Man Taking Pay_Cut , &quot; are difficult to locate . I ' d like someday to see collections of region-specific sound_effects albums , one , say , of sounds indigenous to Orange County . It could contain titles like &quot; Audience at Performing Arts Center Applauding in the Wrong Place , &quot; &quot; BMW Engines Idling at the El Toro Y , &quot; &quot; Man Cracking Walnuts With Automatic Weapons Fire &quot; and &quot; Audience at Performing Arts Center Applauding in the Wrong Place , Again. &quot; I ' ve been a sound-effects buff since I first listened to my favorite record at age 4 . It was &quot; Sherri the Squirrel &quot; ( the name has been changed to protect us from litigious squirrels ) , an audio adaptation of a live action film by one of the nation ' s leading purveyors of nature films . Sherri frolicked around the forest , merrily , but for the vicious predators , crashing trees and raging fires trying to do her in , all represented by stirring sound_effects . One early example of the discerning mind I since have applied to journalism was the way I would listen , for 15 minutes sometimes , to the forest_fire that ended side one of the album . Eventually my mother pointed_out that I was actually listening , over and over and over , to the crackling sound of the phonograph_needle digging into the center groove of the record . I was chatting with another of my Times pod-mates recently , and he was telling me of the days he used to work for this particular purveyor of nature films . After regaling me with tales of how a documentary crew once shoveled lemmings off a cliff to get a desired shot , he continued , &quot; Of course , that ' s nothing compared to Sherri. &quot; I knew I didn ' t want to hear it , but kept listening as he continued , &quot; You know how the fox almost got Sherri ? Well , the fox got Sherri . Same with the fire . They must have gone_through hundreds of squirrels. &quot; It seems that , since it ' s hard to direct_fires and ravening animals , a lot of Sherris bought_the_farm before the cameras got the right shot . The daily rushes would be one take of furry carnage after another . From a squirrel ' s point_of_view , &quot; Sherri the Squirrel &quot; must be the von Stroheim ' s &quot; Greed &quot; of nature films . I still have my Sherri album , though I don ' t think I could bring myself to listen to it now . that ' s OK , I have hundreds of albums I can ' t bring myself to listen to , mostly for aesthetic reasons . I buy god-awful records the way some people take_in stray cats . * For example , I have a heap of &quot; tribal &quot; drum records that were briefly popular in the early ' 60s . The recordings were ostensibly African , by a &quot; prince &quot; who was invariably claimed to be the last member of his tribe . Usually , they instead sounded like bored union musicians getting paid scale to bang on stuff . The worst of the bunch , perhaps , was a bongo-happy affair called &quot; The Savage Rhythms of Modesto. &quot; I presume the creators had a hoot naming their &quot; prince &quot; after the then-obscure California town . I also collect live concert bootlegs , some of which I think are among the most important musical documents of our time , and others of which I have to admit I collect because they are so utterly distorted . There ' s a bootleg of the Band in which you ' d swear the peerless American group was performing underwater . With wool mittens on . Another abominable recording was one of Black Sabbath -- not entirely the most refined musical outfit to begin with -- on a boot called &quot; Love in Chicago &quot; that reputedly was made by the Mafia . Whoever made_it , it sounds as if it were recorded at a construction site , maybe in the same city the band was playing in . It ' s nonstop rumble . Did I mention it ' s a double album ? If I had to pick the most pathetic album I have -- and bear_in_mind , this is from a collection with &quot; Songs of the Humpback_Whale &quot; and no fewer than six Yoko albums -- it might be &quot; Stay Safe ! &quot; Its grooves contain &quot; family &quot; sounds : chairs scraping , food being consumed , and people engaging in insipid bickerings and arguments . According to the cover , it was intended to be played when you ' re not home , to give burglars the ambient impression there is a houseful of folks inside . I suspect instead that it was a play that was so ruinously bad that this was the only way they could market it . I don ' t think I ' d ever sell this album , largely because I ' m positive I ' ll never find anyone who would want to buy_it . Given time , I suppose I ' ll come_to have a similar warm regard for my &quot; 75 Spectacular Sound_Effects &quot; CD .</TEXT>
