   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / DOUG BANDOW : ANOTHER CRISIS OF PRESIDENTIAL WAR-MAKING ; AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL SLIDE TOWARD COMBAT WITH HAITI .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration seems to be slowly sliding toward war with Haiti . The goal , to restore democracy , sounds noble , but the means would be brutal : invading and occupying another sovereign state . Moreover , the constitutional power to decide to do so lies_with Congress , not the President . Not that modern chief_executives admit to many limitations on their war-making power . In the fall of 1990 , for instance , George_Bush stated that he didn ' t think he needed congressional approval before attacking Iraq . He only reluctantly accepted Congress ' plan to vote and the lawmakers ' narrow endorsement of war avoided a serious constitutional crisis . But Bill_Clinton is now similarly contemplating war without legislative assent . There are , however , few issues where the language of the U.S. Constitution , intentions of the framers and historical_record are clearer . The American colonists consciously avoided the European model of all-powerful executives when they created their new system . Article 1 of the Constitution_states that &quot; Congress shall have the power . . . to declare war. &quot; The President is to fulfill his responsibilities as commander_in_chief within the framework established by the Constitution . James_Madison wrote in 1793 that it is necessary to adhere to the &quot; fundamental doctrine of the Constitution that the power to declare war is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature. &quot; Delegates changed Congress ' authority from &quot; make ' to &quot; declare &quot; war , explained Madison , only to allow the President the authority to respond to a sudden attack . Delegates rejected a proposal to give the President the power to start war . Explained Virginia ' s George Mason : The President &quot; is not safely to be entrusted with &quot; the power to decide on war . Mason favored &quot; clogging rather than facilitating war. &quot; James Wilson , though an advocate of a strong presidency , approvingly observed that the new constitutional system &quot; will not hurry us into war. &quot; Similarly , Thomas_Jefferson wrote that &quot; we have already given . . . one effectual check to the dog of war by transferring the power of letting him loose. &quot; Even nationalist Alexander Hamilton agreed with his long-time adversary on this point . Advocates of expansive executive war power -- oddly enough , including some who claim to believe_in a jurisprudence of &quot; original intent &quot; -- nevertheless have come_up with a number of reasons to give the President unrestrained authority to act . One is that he must be able to use the military for &quot; defensive &quot; purposes . True , but defensive means defensive : At the Constitutional Convention , Roger Sherman of Connecticut stated that &quot; the executive should be able to repel and not to commence war. &quot; If President Clinton wants to &quot; commence &quot; war to overthrow Haiti ' s ruling regime , he must go_to Congress . Another argument is that it is impractical to involve the legislative_branch in foreign affairs . But Congress ' vote_in January of 1991 proves the contrary . While 535 legislators cannot direct the course of an attack on Haiti or anywhere else , they can decide whether or not the nation should go_to_war . Nor would a congressional debate tip_off the Cedras junta as_to the timing of any potential military_action . Congress has four times approved conditional declarations of war , authorizing the President to use force if certain objectives were not achieved . In three instances , the executive_branch peacefully resolved the disputes ; in the fourth , war ensued after Spain refused Congress ' demand that it withdraw from Cuba . Following these precedents , the President could ask Congress to authorize the use of force if Haiti ' s military rulers do not yield power after some reasonable period_of_time . Finally , proponents of executive war-making contend that ample precedent , 200 or more troop deployments without congressional approval , exists for the President to unilaterally initiate hostilities . Most of these were minor skirmishes , however , offering no justification for conquering another nation . And the fact that past chief_executives acted lawlessly does not empower the current one to do likewise . There is no more important issue than war and peace . Should young Americans die to &quot; restore &quot; democracy in a nation with no democratic tradition ? We need a broad national debate to answer this question . Indeed , the President can scarcely talk_of respecting democracy in Haiti if he does not follow the U.S. Constitution by asking Congress to vote first . And if he refuses to ask , Congress should schedule a vote now , well before an invasion is under way . Given the recent record of presidential misbehavior , it is important for Congress to maintain what Jefferson called the Constitution ' s &quot; check to the dog of war. &quot;</TEXT>
