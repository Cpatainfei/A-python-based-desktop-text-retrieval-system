   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL PRESSES ITS DRIVE AGAINST EXTREMISTS ; MIDEAST : LEADER OF HEBRON SETTLERS IS ARRAIGNED ON OLD CHARGES . BUT HE VOWS TO REMAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pressing their campaign against extremist Jewish groups in the occupied West_Bank , Israeli authorities on Tuesday brought the leader of the 450 Jewish settlers in Hebron into court here on a 2-year-old charge , symbolizing the political shift now under way . Rabbi Moshe Levinger , spiritual father of the Israeli settlers movement in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip , was charged with interfering with the troops policing Hebron , where the little community of Jews living among 70 # 000 Palestinians has long been a flash_point of tension . The charge was relatively minor and the incident far from threatening , even at the time . But Levinger was arraigned in Jerusalem district court and will go_on trial next month to make clear the government ' s determination to halt settler attacks on Palestinians . The maximum sentence is six months in jail . Levinger , however , replied at a right-wing rally in Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening that he and other settlers are equally determined to remain in Hebron and elsewhere in their communities in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . &quot; We will not be moved , and I believe fully that nothing bad will happen to the Jews in Hebron , &quot; Levinger said to the cheers of an estimated 30 # 000 supporters at one of Tel Aviv ' s largest political rallies in recent years . Benjamin Netanyahu , chairman of the opposition Likud Party , told the rally , &quot; If we don ' t have the right to live_in Hebron , we don ' t have the right to live anywhere in this country . &quot; A government like this must be brought_down . . . , &quot; Netanyahu said of Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin ' s center-left coalition . &quot; We will fight for the heart of our land. &quot; The protesters , a_few toting rifles , marched from the Square of the Kings of Israel in the center of Tel Aviv to the nearby Defense Ministry . Pushing baby_carriages , carrying torches and waving Israeli flags , they chanted slogans against Rabin and his &quot; leftist government. &quot; Four people were reported arrested in scuffles with police . Meanwhile , Israeli security_forces were_on high alert to foil suicide attacks threatened by Muslim fundamentalists on Jewish settlers in revenge for a settler ' s massacre of about 30 Palestinians as they prayed in a Hebron mosque last month . In the northern Gaza Strip , an Israeli police undercover squad opened_fire on a car whose occupants had just shot at an Israeli army patrol , said a military spokesman ; two Palestinians were killed . Acting on government orders , police closed the offices of Kach and Kahane Chai , two extremist Jewish groups outlawed on Sunday . Dr. Baruch Goldstein , the U.S.-born settler who carried_out the Hebron attack before being beaten to death , belonged_to Kach ; members of both groups are believed responsible_for other attacks on Palestinians . The Israeli human_rights group_B ' Tselem charged in a hard-hitting report Tuesday that , over the years , the army and police have allowed settlers to attack Palestinians &quot; with virtual impunity , &quot; rarely intervening to halt armed assaults and even more rarely prosecuting those responsible , even when Palestinians were killed . Eitan Fellner , a B ' Tselem researcher , said Israeli military authorities have come_to view settlers , &quot; despite of or because of &quot; the attacks on Palestinians , as &quot; a contribution to security and the maintenance of public order &quot; in the West_Bank . Israeli military and police spokesmen had no immediate comment on the B ' Tselem report , but the army issued a statement saying Israeli troops are authorized to shoot at settlers if they endanger other lives . Police and army_officers testifying before a commission investigating the Hebron massacre said last week that standing_orders prohibited firing at settlers in any circumstances . Emily L . Hauser of The Times ' Jerusalem Bureau contributed to this report from Tel Aviv .</TEXT>
