   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN TROOPS ' EXIT ENDS COLD_WAR SAGA IN GERMANY ; EUROPE : WHEN A RED ARMY COLONEL ARRIVED IN BERLIN , HE DIDN ' T FORESEE HIS GRANDSON BEING THERE 49 YEARS LATER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In April , 1945 , a Red Army colonel named Magomed-Khan Abdul Pashayev joined the assault on an encircled Berlin . After planting the first Soviet flag in the city ' s suburbs , his regiment helped capture and hold the Reichstag until the Nazi surrender on May 9 . &quot; Germany is defeated , but as soon as it is raised from ruin we shall leave , &quot; he told his son . &quot; What people would long endure a foreign army as masters of_their_own land ? &quot; Two winters later , Pashayev was back home_in Russia . But to his dismay , the Red Army stayed_on and on . The occupation was to reshape Europe and help launch the Cold_War , outlive the colonel himself and absorb three subsequent generations of his family before coming_to an ignoble end this week . Nearly five years after the Berlin Wall came_down , nearly three years after the Soviet_Union itself collapsed , another Pashayev in army uniform will close a chapter in postwar and family history Thursday when he joins the final trainload of Russian troops from Germany and chronicles their two-day journey to Moscow for the army newspaper Red Star . Along with the departure of the last Russian troops from the Baltics this week , the pullout from Germany will complete a historic retrenchment . It will put the army that once occupied all_of Eastern Europe back within the Soviet_Union ' s pre-World War II borders . &quot; The great_war is finally ending , &quot; Col . Sergei S . Pashayev said last week with the pride of finishing a grandfather ' s mission . &quot; Every army must come_home someday . This was inevitable. &quot; It was also humiliating . The liberating heroes of 1945 became , to many Germans , Cold_War occupiers of the 1950s , ' 60s , ' 70 and ' 80s , puppeteers of a repressive East_German Communist regime , agents of division . Unwanted in a reunified Germany , Russia ' s most prestigious military_forces -- half a_million officers , soldiers and dependents -- began retreating in 1991 to an exhausted , disunified and indifferent homeland incapable of housing them all . The Pashayevs who served in Germany during this extraordinary span look_back on it , as_many Russians do , with a selective and ambivalent view of history . They know they stayed too long yet refuse to see themselves as unwanted occupiers . The few Germans they knew were friendly and never challenged them on the Soviet propaganda about defending socialism against the West . When the end came , the Pashayevs found it easier to blame their own leaders in Moscow -- not for the decision to retreat but for the messy way it was done . &quot; A withdrawal to nowhere , &quot; Sergei Pashayev called it . The Pashayevs descend from a prominent Muslim family from Dagestan , a mountainous southern Russian republic famed for fine carpets and fierce , freedom-loving warriors . Sergei M . Pashayev , whose father stormed the Reichstag , was assigned as a staff_officer to Dresden from 1963 to 1968 . His son , the Red Star correspondent , was sent_in 1992 to Wuensdorf , the main Russian base outside Berlin , to report on the withdrawal . Both had also lived_in Germany as boys during their fathers ' tours . The correspondent ' s stepdaughter , Olga , became the fourth generation of the family to wear a uniform in Germany . She married a young Russian artillery officer at Wuensdorf in 1992 and enlisted there as a private , working as a telegrapher . The couple was transferred to Russia in May . The founder of this dynasty , the late Magomed-Khan Abdul Pashayev , was a decorated war hero -- &quot; always there when the going got_tough , &quot; one historian wrote_of him -- and a strict regiment leader who once shot open every bottle in a captured German wine_cellar to keep his men from drinking . He was also a propaganda officer who taught his subordinates and his descendants to like all Germans who weren ' t fascists . Practicing what he preached , he shared his officer ' s rations with his German housekeeper after the war . Sergei M . Pashayev , now 66 and living_in Ukraine , was a teen-ager at the time . He fraternized with American soldiers who had arrived to partition Berlin after the Nazi surrender . He admired their ability to drive a jeep with only an elbow on the steering_wheel . After leaving with his father in early 1947 , Pashayev enrolled in a Russian military_academy and learned how quickly the Americans had become enemies . He was taught about the Soviet blockade of Berlin , the anti-Communist Marshall Plan , the first Soviet nuclear bomb , the East-West struggle for world supremacy . Two years before he returned to Germany as an officer , the Communists built a wall dividing Soviet-controlled East Berlin from Allied-occupied West_Berlin . &quot; My mission was to protect the forward bastions of the socialist camp , &quot; Pashayev said . &quot; I think the task of the American army was more or less similar . It was us against them. &quot; His father would challenge that Cold_War logic during his son ' s home leaves . &quot; How long are you going_to be there ? &quot; he recalls the old_man asking . &quot; All is in_order . All is done . Why stay ? &quot; But the Germans who ran the ground-floor bakery in the building where they lived showered Sergei ' s children with cakes after school , and the Pashayevs never met a German who voiced objections to their presence . Sergei ' s only brush with hostility came_after his unit rushed to neighboring Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia to help crush the 1968 Prague Spring uprising . That part was swift and simple . But before leaving , he had to fall_into a roadside ditch to avoid being run_over by a resentful young Czech in a big truck . It would be another 21 years before Eastern Europe escaped the loosening Soviet grip of President Mikhail S . Gorbachev . By then , Magomed-Khan Abdul Pashayev was dead , and his descendants had come_to realize that the Cold_War was &quot; sheer madness , &quot; as his grandson put it . Arriving in a reunified Germany , Pashayev the army journalist was struck by how wealthy it had become since his boyhood there , when his mother would get cheap butter from the Soviet officers ' store for his German piano_teacher . Under a 1990 accord that made reunification possible , the German government put_up $ 7 billion to finance the promised Soviet withdrawal . Most of the money went_to supplement the salaries of officers waiting to leave and to build housing for them back home . For Russian officers lucky enough to be in post-Cold War Germany , the new mission was simple : make money , acquire goodies , to cushion the blow of coming_home to poverty . The German allowances tripled their salaries . Pashayev the journalist bought a 1988 BMW . Stepdaughter Olga and her husband , First Lt . Alexander Voznyuk , who together earned more_than $ 700 a month in Germany , bought a 1982 Ford , a stereo and years ' worth of new clothes . &quot; You see how the Germans live -- in comfort , beauty and neatness -- and you start feeling you want to live like they do , &quot; 21-year-old Olga said . &quot; Now it will be possible to live like that in Russia. &quot; Her husband added , &quot; The officers in my class who stayed in Russia have practically nothing. &quot; As their numbers dwindled , Russian troops sold_off duty-free cigarettes and vodka -- and , some German officials suspect , weapons . Then they grabbed anything they could barter back home -- concrete light poles , barracks doors , windows , sinks and toilets . The Wuensdorf base , once a military city of 70 # 000 Soviet soldiers , was stripped bare this summer , its hollowed apartment blocks abandoned to weeds , stray cats and advancing marshland . Pashayev ' s reports in Red Star over the past year have described assaults on the base and its environs -- by German skinheads , thieves and immigrants from the former Soviet_Union trying to buy weapons and sell stolen cars . As a journalist , he took_part in two sting operations with the German police to nab would-be weapons buyers . He also reported a scam by a Russian officer ' s brother who took housing funds from the army , built cottages in Russia and sold them on the open market . Despite German aid , as_many as 200 # 000 soldiers and dependents have returned from Germany without housing , including Pashayev ' s stepdaughter and husband . Lucky to get a Moscow assignment , they crowded with their baby into Pashayev ' s tiny two-bedroom apartment on the edge of Moscow , where the journalist will soon join his wife . Other officers , not so lucky , must live_in barracks while their wives return to their own families . &quot; The decision to withdraw was correct , &quot; the 44-year-old journalist said during a brief visit home last week . &quot; But it should have been done_in a more civilized manner . . . . Gorbachev is to blame for the ruined lives of many officers and for the broken families. &quot; That sentiment , echoed by his father and his stepdaughter , is stronger than any feeling that the Germans turned against them . So are two other complaints shared by the Pashayevs about the way the era ended . One is that , while Germany united , the Soviet_Union fell_apart , forcing their family members to cross borders to visit each other . The other is the loss of prestige for their military profession . Coming_home in May , Voznyuk realized that &quot; civilians look_at us as if we are mentally ill. &quot; And how do four generations of Pashayevs , whose mission in Germany changed so_much over the 49-year occupation , judge its impact on history ? &quot; We went_to Germany to end one war and prevent a new one from starting , &quot; said Sergei S . Pashayev , trying to speak_for the whole family . &quot; A new war did not start . There is hope that war will never break_out again . Now we can get_on_with the work of_our_own country . . . . &quot; If my grandfather were alive , he would say , ' Mission accomplished. ' &quot; Times staff writer Mary Williams Walsh in Berlin contributed to this report .</TEXT>
