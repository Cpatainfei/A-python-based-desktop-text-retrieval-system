   <HEADLINE> GAZA POLICE FIRE ON MILITANTS ; 11 DEAD IN CLASHES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Palestinian police Friday opened_fire on Palestinian demonstrators for the first time , killing at least 11 , wounding more_than 120 and fueling fears that PLO chief Yasser Arafat ' s confrontation with Islamic militants could trigger civil_war . Islamic militants and the police first clashed outside a mosque , then engaged in street battles that lasted even after police vainly imposed a curfew in parts of the Gaza Strip . Angry followers of the militant Islamic Jihad and Hamas movements poured into hospitals where the wounded were taken . They denounced Arafat , who is chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and head of the Palestinian self-governing authority , as a traitor and a stooge of Israel . Militants torched Gaza ' s single movie_theater and overran and burned an Israeli checkpoint near the isolated settlement of Netzarim . They gathered outside police_headquarters and clashed with soldiers there as truckloads of suspected militants who had been detained by police pulled into the compound . In Gaza City , as women wept in the stairwells and hospital_rooms of Shifa Hospital , the sound of gunfire could be heard in the streets outside . Hundreds of men milled_around the hospital compound . Some prayed , others wept . Across from the hospital , a mosque broadcast the names of the dead , who were given the title &quot; martyr &quot; -- one previously reserved for Palestinians who died fighting Israelis . In another part of the city , grim-faced , bearded men gathered at the homes of families who had lost a member in clashes with police . Hasty burials , lit only by the light of the full_moon , were under way by 7 p.m. &quot; We didn ' t expect this to happen between Palestinians , &quot; said a man who declined to give his name . He was hovering anxiously over the bed of his nephew , 13-year-old Mahmoud Sakr Biltaggi , at Shifa Hospital on Friday night . Biltaggi was shot in the abdomen during the clash that erupted at Gaza City ' s Palestine Mosque after noon prayers . Biltaggi ' s father , the uncle said , is an activist with Islamic Jihad who was arrested one week ago by the Palestinian police , after a suicide bomber and member of Islamic Jihad blew himself up at the same Israeli checkpoint that was overrun Friday . In the earlier attack , the bomber , Hisham Hamad , killed three Israeli soldiers . Israel responded to Hamad ' s attack by pressuring Arafat to crack_down on Islamic Jihad and Hamas . The two organizations have carried_out a string of bloody attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers and have vowed to torpedo Arafat ' s peace accord with Israel . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and other Israeli officials have repeatedly warned Arafat that he must either face down Islamic militants or risk the collapse of the peace process . Since arriving in Gaza in July , Arafat has ordered the arrest of dozens of Islamic activists after each attack on Israelis . But those arrested have usually been released without charge within a_few days . Until Friday , Arafat avoided using force against the militants . Advisers warned him that any use of force against Hamas in Gaza , where the organization is a strong , well-organized political and social force with a wide following , would alienate a majority of residents . But Hamas ' increasingly bold challenges to his authority appear to have pushed Arafat into Friday ' s confrontation . After Islamic Jihad and Hamas militants staged a massive rally Nov . 11 in the heart of Gaza City , chanting slogans against Arafat and Israel , Justice Minister Freih Abu Medeen warned that they had &quot; crossed a red line. &quot; The most recent clash started after noon prayers Friday at the Palestine Mosque , where some 6 # 000 worshipers had gathered to observe the Muslim Sabbath . The white mosque is Gaza ' s largest , and a Hamas stronghold . Militants interviewed at Shifa Hospital said worshipers were incited by the presence of about 200 armed , shielded police . The police reportedly surrounded a crowd of about 1 # 000 worshipers who had begun praying in the street when they couldn ' t squeeze inside the packed mosque . A police spokesman said that the officers took_up positions around the mosque only after police_headquarters received information that Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group planned a violent demonstration after prayers . The police said they started shooting only after militants started marching toward the home of the suicide bomber and began throwing stones at the police . The police said that they warned the demonstrators to stop , then fired in the air before shooting at any worshipers . But witnesses disputed that account . &quot; During the intifada ( Palestinian uprising ) , the Israeli soldiers would first fire tear_gas , and then fire rubber bullets and only then shoot live ammunition , &quot; said Mahmoud , a worshiper who returned to the Palestine Mosque for evening_prayers . &quot; They never shot at us without a direct order to shoot , and then they only shot a_few bullets . But these Palestinian police started shooting immediately , and they shot everywhere. &quot; Mahmoud declined to give his last_name . In a statement issued Friday evening , Brig . Gen . Gazi Jibali , the Gaza police_chief , said that worshipers were incited to riot by militants and &quot; opened_fire suddenly at some of our forces and burned two vehicles. &quot; One police_officer reportedly was killed during the riot that erupted , but it is unclear whether he was hit by a stone or a bullet . Several other officers reportedly were wounded . &quot; We were praying and at the last minute of the prayers , we heard shooting outside , &quot; said one worshiper , a 23-year-old who identified himself only as Mohammad . &quot; The police were ready for anything. &quot; Mohammad said he was standing with his closest friend , Hazzam Dalou , when the shooting began . Dalou , 23 , was fatally shot in the chest , Mohammad said . &quot; My clothes are still soaked in his blood , &quot; he said . &quot; I carried his body to the hospital. &quot; No one could say Friday night how many were injured in the initial clash , and how many were hurt in the street battles that followed . Police reportedly opened_fire on the demonstrators who gathered outside the central jail , and again at police_headquarters . Police and demonstrators also reportedly clashed outside Shifa Hospital , where militants ambushed a police_van carrying wounded police_officers , stoning the officers and setting fire to the van . &quot; We warn these groups of thugs against attempts to harm the public safety , &quot; Jibali said in his statement . Police threw_up checkpoints along many Gaza City roads , and armed plainclothes officers and uniformed police were out_in force . Late Friday evening , Israel Radio reported that disturbances had spread to Rafah in southern Gaza . Militants reportedly set fire to a cinema there . By 10 p.m. , there was still no statement from Arafat . But his Fatah faction issued a statement accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad of being involved in &quot; conspiratorial plans . . . on behalf of foreign parties. &quot; The statement added : &quot; We cannot make concessions or be lenient with_regard_to their insistence on harming national unity. &quot; Aides outside Arafat ' s office in the early evening said that he will meet with leaders of both Islamic Jihad and Hamas during the night to try to calm the situation . A Hamas leader , Salah Safade , appealed for calm during a rally at a Gaza City mosque Friday night . &quot; We don ' t want a massacre here to continue , &quot; Safade said .</TEXT>
