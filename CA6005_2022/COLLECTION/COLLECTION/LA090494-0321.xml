   <HEADLINE> CHINA IS HAVING ITS WAY WITH U.S. -- BUSINESS BEFORE HUMAN_RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It may seem paradoxical , but China is now getting more from the Clinton_Administration than it ever obtained from George_Bush . With Secretary_of_Commerce Ronald H . Brown ' s trip to Beijing last week , Bill_Clinton has made_it plainer than ever before that his 1992 campaign dictum -- &quot; It ' s the economy , stupid &quot; -- has overridden and washed_out his campaign attacks on Bush for &quot; coddling dictators &quot; in Beijing . Accompanied by more_than 20 U.S. business_leaders , Brown said the Clinton_Administration is giving much higher priority to U.S. commercial interests in China and avoided any public criticism of China ' s human-rights policies . In exchange for his deference , China announced the signing of nearly $ 5 billion in business_deals , of which more_than an estimated $ 2 billion in work will be done_in the United States . Many of these deals had been in the works , and would likely have been signed anyway . And some supposed agreements are probably letters of understanding , not binding contracts . Brown did announce that China will resume its human-rights dialogue with Washington . But that was merely a giveback by Beijing , since China suspended talks earlier this year ; the United States had been seeking to resume the talks for months . Brown ' s trip was not unprecedented . For years , China has selectively welcomed trade missions from various countries as a reward for their good behavior in other areas of diplomacy . British Prime_Minister Margaret Thatcher was granted the right to send a high-level trade delegation to Beijing after she signed the agreement to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 . Awarding contracts for political reasons would seem to run contrary to principles of free_trade , but Beijing is not a place for purists of the Adam Smith school . During 1989-92 , after the Tian An Men Square crackdown , the Democratic Party , with Brown as its chairman , repeatedly criticized Bush for seeking a reconciliation with the Chinese regime . Now , under the banner of what it calls &quot; constructive engagement , &quot; the Administration is seeking just such a reconciliation . The out-of-office Democrats attacked Bush for sending then-National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to Beijing . Now , the Clinton_Administration is set to dispatch a series of high-level emissaries to China . Brown will be followed later this fall by Defense_Secretary William J . Perry and Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary . China hopes all these trips will serve as a buildup for a visit by Clinton in 1995 . Indeed , in some respects , the Clinton_Administration has gone_further toward upgrading relations with China than Bush dared . It restored the U.S. military ties with China ' s People ' s Liberation Army that Bush cut_in June , 1989 , an act Bush was unprepared to take . During his last year in office , Bush risked Chinese ire by selling F-16s to Taiwan and dispatching a Cabinet secretary , U.S. Trade Representative Carla A . Hills , to Taipei ; Clinton has been much more cautious in his dealings with Taiwan for fear of offending Beijing . Most significant , the Chinese regime has more openly taunted and defied the Clinton_Administration on human_rights than it ever did the Bush_Administration . On the eve of Brown ' s trip , Chinese authorities detained a leading dissident , Wang Dan , in what seemed to be a test of how much the Administration would stomach . Brown said nothing publicly . Imagine what would have happened in the 1970s or 1980s if the Soviet_Union had thrown the country ' s leading dissident , Andrei D . Sakharov , into jail because he had committed the alleged offense of meeting with a senior U.S. official . Undoubtedly , Presidents Jimmy_Carter or Ronald Reagan would have expressed outrage and treated the incident as a serious breach in the relationship . Yet , this spring , China did virtually the same thing : It detained China ' s leading dissident , Wei Jingsheng , for more_than four months because he met with John H . Shattuck , Clinton ' s assistant secretary_of_state for human_rights . At least in public , Clinton has said or done nothing about the incident . On several occasions during 1990-92 , the Bush_Administration extracted concessions from China , such_as the release of a_few dissidents , that go beyond anything Clinton has yet achieved . That is not to say Bush deserved all_the credit for winning the concessions . Rather , he was able to get as far as he did because the former President could point to the Democratic Congress and say to the Chinese , &quot; You better give us something , because otherwise , the Democratic Congress is going_to punish you. &quot; That is the important , underlying change in U.S.-China policy from Bush to Clinton : Largely because he is a Democrat , Clinton has succeeded in overcoming the congressional proponents of human-rights and democratic reforms in China in a way no Republican could have managed . It is often said that it took Richard M . Nixon , a Republican and longtime anti-communist , to lead America ' s historic opening to China in 1972 . Similarly , it took Clinton , a Democrat and self-proclaimed human-rights advocate , to restore relations with Beijing after the Tian An Men Square upheaval . The Administration worked for a year with Democratic members of Congress who favored strong human-rights policies , including Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) and House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) . Then it broke_with them on China policy last May , after their support had been eroded and their intensity defused . &quot; We were just fooled , &quot; admitted Rep . Nancy Pelosi ( D-San Francisco ) in a recent interview . &quot; They ( Clinton_Administration officials ) asked us to give them time . We held_off from criticism while the Chinese were doing all sorts of nasty things. &quot; The Administration ' s principal justification for its new policy , aired repeatedly by Brown before and during the trip , is that greater trade will help reformers within the Chinese leadership and thus promote human_rights . That is , however , only an assumption , and so far there is little evidence to support it . In fact , at a time when China faces a major political struggle for succession to Deng Xiaoping , Clinton ' s conciliatory policies could unintentionally lend greater legitimacy to hard-liners like Premier Li Peng -- leaders who say that they know how to handle the United States and that there is no penalty to be paid_for China ' s repeated crackdowns on human_rights .</TEXT>
