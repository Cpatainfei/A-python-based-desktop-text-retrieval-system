   <HEADLINE> COUSCOUS ; THE TUNISIAN VARIATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Say North Africa to a food lover and chances are he ' ll say couscous . In Morocco , Algeria and Tunisia , it is by far the most popular food . It is famous , it is simple , it is soothing and it is delicious . Take a container with a perforated bottom , fill it with a_thousand tiny grain pellets , place it above a bubbling stew and voila ! The vapors from the stew will both swell the granules and flavor them . Eat the pellets and the stew together , and the result is happiness . Some people think_of couscous as a grain . Not so ; it ' s basically a way of treating grain . You can steam whole-barley or green-wheat kernels as couscous , or even green barley shoots . But many people make their couscous from ground semolina , in which case it ' s something more akin to pasta . They blend fine semolina flour and coarse semolina with a little water , roll it into little lumps and then press them through a sieve to form minute and uniform balls . These balls are rolled_around on another sieve to remove excess flour . They can be steamed and eaten right away , or they can be steamed , dried and stored . The dried form is the couscous &quot; grains &quot; you buy_at the store . In North Africa , making couscous by hand is a tradition handed_down from mother to daughter , and the average family eats couscous about twice a week , making_it a staple . But since making_it by hand takes time and many modern North African women work , the old method is rapidly falling_out of favor . On a recent trip to Tunisia I had a chance to visit the world ' s largest and most modern couscous factory , Couscousseries du Sud , located in Sfax , the second city of Tunisia and a major port . I didn ' t know quite what to expect -- perhaps a_thousand women in neat factory rows making couscous all at once . Instead , I found a completely automated plant run_by men , an almost nightmare maze of broilers , vats and chutes that turn_out tons of couscous a week . In the United States , Tunisian couscous is not as well known as the Moroccan style , but as I discovered , it can be very good . Chile peppers sound the predominating note . One of my favorites is a red and green specialty called kuski mfawwar , which combines fennel and carrot tops with celery leaves and powerful flavors such_as red_pepper , scallions , coriander , caraway and garlic . Use two pounds of greens for every pound of couscous and you will discover how much flavor and earthiness they can contribute . Kuski mfawwar has many variations . In Sfax , they make_it with malmouth , or grilled and cracked barley grits , instead of couscous grains , and I have also tasted it with whole-wheat couscous . But the best version is a recipe given to me by Aziza ben Tanfous , curator of the Sidi Zitouni Museum on the island of Djerba , who learned it from her grandmother . Since it tends to be slightly dry , you may want to serve it the traditional way , with glasses of buttermilk . The special texture and lightness of small-grain couscous makes_it an ideal substance for desserts . A delicious nut , date and custard dessert uses a fine-grain couscous known as mesfouf which , when steaming , swells to the size of the medium couscous available in_stores . Often Tunisians will substitute coarse-grain semolina , and that is what I have used . You can find coarse semolina at a Middle Eastern grocery . Dessert couscous is more popular in Tunisia than in Morocco . In Morocco it is rich with butter and sugar , and eaten warm or even hot . Tunisian couscous is less sweet and is served cool or even chilled , often mixed with fresh fruits in season such_as small grapes , or pomegranate seeds mixed with seedless black raisins . The recipe for the sweet couscous below comes from Sfax . What I especially like about it is that , while Tunisian sweet couscous dishes tend to be a little on the dry side , this one is moist due_to a layer of creamy pudding . There is also a large couscous known as mhammas . Pellets about the size of Italian acine de pepe are rubbed in olive_oil , steamed for a full hour , then dumped into a sauce so that they continue cooking until they become soft . Their silky and almost sodden texture is much appreciated in many southern parts of Tunisia . I found any number of delicious fish couscous recipes in Tunisia too . A particularly appetizing one is prepared on the island of Djerba in a three-tiered steamer . Slices of bluefish , embedded in a mixture of chopped mint , parsley , Swiss_chard and fennel leaves are steamed over a cinnamon-and-cumin scented broth . The couscous , steaming in solitary splendor on top , absorbs the aromas from the two tiers below . In southern Tunisia , dried fish , octopus and bits of pungent lamb jerky called qadid ( spiced , dried and preserved in oil ) are often used , with cubes of apricots mixed in to punctuate the salty flavors . The most popular home-style couscous on Djerba uses red_pepper , coriander , tomatoes , fresh green chile , lamb , olive_oil , qadid and dried baby sardines called ouzef , which add a distinctive fishy flavor that acts_as a taste stimulant and catalyst . You can eliminate the sardines but not the lamb jerky , which gives the dish its unique flavor and a mildly crunchy texture . Many modern Tunisian couscous dishes are hot and spicy , with lots of fiery harissa , ground coriander , cumin and garlic . Older ones , which tend to taste both mellow and exotic , are often made with quince , raisins and a curious blend of dried rosebuds , black_pepper and ground cinnamon . Lately it has become popular to mix the two styles . In Morocco , you can find couscous that is both spicy and sweet , the two contradictory tastes interacting and tantalizing the tongue . There is the simplest Berber couscous -- tossed with fresh favas , then downed with buttermilk -- and the most lavish palace version in which pigeons , stuffed with various fillings , are nestled in the grain . There is a spicy couscous in which chiles and ground pepper sound the predominating note , and there ' s the great classic sweet Moroccan couscous of Fez , in which onions , raisins , chick peas and lamb are served together in perfect harmony . Tunisians tend to steam their couscous covered , while Moroccans and Algerians do not . As a result , the Tunisian version tends to be more tender and moist ; the Moroccan and Algerian , a little fluffier and lighter . Tunisian couscous is also presented differently . Tunisian cooks moisten their steamed grains with lots of broth and often mix the ingredients into the grains so that the dish comes_to the table like a pilaf or paella . Moroccan and Algerian cooks prefer to moisten the grains lightly , with thin broth , then make a well in the center for the remaining broth and vegetables . Restaurants usually serve the various ingredients separately so that each diner can take what he likes . But in the home , couscous , like most North African food , is traditionally presented in one large bowl or platter . The popularity of couscous just grows and grows . Many countries have come_up with native versions of the North African original . There is keskes in Senegal , cuscuz in Brazil , kuskus in northern Greece and Turkey , and even cuscusu in Trapani , Sicily , for which the sauce is the local fish soup . In Lebanon and Jordan , they make a couscous of large round semolina pellets cooked with onions and chicken and call it mughrabiyya , which means &quot; from the Mahgreb , &quot; the collective noun for Morocco , Algeria and Tunisia .

Some sailed into the bay of Tunis to settle south of the city in a town called Testour . They introduced their own spice usages to the Tunisian culinary spectrum , the most important being a spice mixture called twabil , used in recipes for salads , stews and couscous . ( A confusing note : In the Tunisian dialect , word tabil or twabil -- which means &quot; spices &quot; in Arabic -- is often applied to ground coriander alone , but it ' s also the name of the following spice mixture. ) Tabil ( Twabil ) ( Tunisian Spice Mixture ) 2 tablespoons ground coriander_seeds 2 teaspoons ground caraway_seeds 1 / 4 teaspoon garlic powder , optional 1 / 2 teaspoon ground red_pepper 1 / 4 teaspoon crushed fennel_seeds 1 / 4 teaspoon crushed anise seeds 1 / 4 teaspoon ground cumin 1 / 4 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 / 2 teaspoon ground black_pepper Mix coriander , caraway , garlic powder , red_pepper , fennel , anise , cumin , turmeric and black_pepper in bowl .

Made with fine-grained couscous , it is flavored with red_pepper , coriander , tomatoes , fresh green chile , lamb , olive_oil and two unusual ingredients : qadid ( a lamb jerky that contributes a pungent flavor and a pastrami-like texture ) and ouzef , dried baby sardines with a distinctive fishy taste that acts_as a taste stimulant and catalyst . You can eliminate the dried fish , but not the jerked meat , which gives the dish its unique flavor and a mildly crunchy texture . This couscous can be made in_advance and reheated , uncovered , in small quantities in the microwave . DJERBIAN HOME-STYLE COUSCOUS 4 strips Qadid 1 / 2 pound onions , thinly sliced 1 / 4 cup olive_oil 1 / 4 cup reserved oil from Qadid 2 lamb shoulder chops , trimmed of excess fat and cut_into 1 / 2-inch pieces 2 tablespoons tomato_paste 3 / 4 cup crushed canned or fresh tomatoes 2 teaspoons crushed red_pepper flakes , preferably Aleppo pepper or Near East pepper , for best flavor 1 1 / 2 teaspoons Tabil ( Twabil ) 1 teaspoon ground caraway Fine sea salt 2 1 / 2 cups couscous 1 1 / 2 cups diced carrots 1 1 / 2 cups diced potatoes 15 dried baby sardines , soaked in warm water 10 minutes and drained , optional 1 cup green_peas , shelled or thawed 3 tablespoons chopped parsley 2 to 4 tablespoons minced green chile to taste In bowl soak Qadid in warm water until soft , 10 minutes . Drain and discard bones . Cut meat into small chunks . In bottom of couscous cooker heat 3 tablespoons olive_oil and oil from Qadid . Add onions and lamb and saute 5 minutes . Cover and cook over low heat until meat gives_off moisture and reabsorbs it . Add Qadid and tomato_paste . Cook , stirring , until meat is_well coated and glossy . Add crushed tomatoes , Tabil , caraway and 1 cup water , cover and cook 15 minutes . Then add 1 quart water and bring_to boil . Meanwhile , rinse couscous in sieve , spread on baking pan . Let stand until grains swell , 5 to 10 minutes . Break_up lumps by raking couscous through your fingers . Lightly oil inside of perforated top and fasten onto couscous cooker . Seal 2 containers , if necessary , with strip of wet cheesecloth . When steam is rising through perforated holes , pile couscous into top container , cover and steam couscous 20 minutes . Transfer steamed couscous onto baking pan . Gradually break_up large lumps of couscous with long spoon while sprinkling couscous with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 1 / 2 cups cold water . When couscous is cool enough to handle , break_up any lumps with moistened fingertips . Allow couscous grains to swell 5 minutes . Then sprinkle with 1 tablespoon olive_oil and lightly rake couscous grains with fingertips . Add carrots , potatoes and drained fish to simmering broth . Make_sure there is enough water to cover all solids by 1 inch . Bring broth back to boil . Fasten on perforated top , pile couscous into top container , cover and steam 15 minutes . Lift top container , slip_in peas , parsley and green chile to simmering broth , return top container and steam another 5 minutes . Tip couscous into wide serving dish . Taste cooking liquid . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Broth should be just thick enough to lightly coat back of wooden spoon . Add contents of cooker to couscous and gently toss to combine . Cover and let stand 15 minutes before serving . Makes 6 servings . Each serving contains about : 899 calories ; 1 # 518 mg sodium ; 43 mg cholesterol ; 53 grams fat ; 81 grams carbohydrates ; 26 grams protein ; 2.55 grams fiber . Note : Dried baby sardines , size of whitebait , can be found in Asian food stores , where they are called niboshi ( in Japanese ) , ca com ( in Vietnamese ) , joetkal ( in Korean ) and chao pai ( in Chinese ) . Look_for bright , shiny-skinned firm fish , which will keep indefinitely in dry place . Though it is not necessary to remove heads from Tunisian ouzef ( unless they are sandy ) , it is wise_to do so with Asian substitutes , because , according to Jacki Passmore , author of &quot; The Encyclopedia of Asian Food and Cooking , &quot; some fish heads will turn bitter when cooked . * Qadid is a sort of North African confit , where lamb is preserved in olive_oil . The spicing and drying of the meat is similar to the treatment given to Turkish bastourma . The resulting flavorful , pastrami-like flesh is used by Tunisian cooks to infuse aroma , spicy flavor and richness to an endless number of recipes , including dishes of beans and lentils , bread , couscous and even scrambled eggs . Shoulder chops have just the right amount of bone and flesh for preserving . The preserving oil , called dhen , should not be discarded because it makes an excellent fat to use for Tunisian soups and stews . Tunisian cooks insist Qadid will keep a year if well stored , but I have never kept it for more_than two months . Tunisian Spiced and Preserved Meat ( Qadid ) 1 1 / 2 pounds lamb shoulder 1 / 2 cup coarse sea salt 1 / 2 head crushed cloves of garlic 2 teaspoons crushed red_pepper flakes 1 / 2 teaspoon ground caraway 1 / 2 teaspoon ground coriander 1 / 2 teaspoon dried mint , pressed through sieve 3 cups olive_oil or more as needed Cut each chop into 3 or 4 long strips . ( Use cleaver to crack through bones. ) Rub flesh with salt and garlic . Stack strips in deep bowl , cover and refrigerate overnight . Following day , dry meat with paper_towels , rub with red_pepper , caraway , coriander and mint and set_on cake racks in 175-degree oven to dry , about 8 hours . Meat is ready when dry to touch but still supple enough to bend slightly . In deep skillet or saucepan heat olive_oil , add meat and fry until light crust forms on all sides . Remove from heat and allow meat to cool in oil . Divide meat between 2 ( 1-pint ) Mason_jars . Cover with frying oil and top_off with fresh oil to completely cover meat by 1 inch . Store in refrigerator . As you remove pieces of Qadid , add fresh oil to keep all remaining pieces from being exposed to air . Always soak Qadid in water to remove excess salt before cooking , about 15 minutes . Makes 15 to 20 strips Qadid . Each of 15 strips contains about : 434 calories ; 1 # 575 mg sodium ; 22 mg cholesterol ; 46 grams fat ; 1 gram carbohydrates ; 7 grams protein ; 0.1 gram fiber .</TEXT>
