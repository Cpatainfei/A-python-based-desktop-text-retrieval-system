   <HEADLINE> SMOG REACHES UNHEALTHFUL LEVELS IN SIMI ; ENVIRONMENT : FEDERAL STANDARDS ARE SURPASSED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN VENTURA COUNTY THIS YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hot sunshine and sluggish onshore breezes pushed smog levels in Simi Valley over Memorial_Day weekend to unhealthful levels for the first time this year in Ventura County , air quality officials said Tuesday . The pollution standard index for ozone , a major component of smog , reached 100 Saturday , touching the unhealthful level , according to readings taken_in Simi Valley by the county Air_Pollution Control District . On Sunday , the level pushed_up to 114 . Anything more_than 100 is considered unhealthful according to the pollution standard index of the federal Environmental Protection Agency , but California ' s stricter pollution standards consider air unhealthful if the smog is just three-quarters that thick . Ozone levels dropped considerably Tuesday , but district forecasters predict that it will push upward today in Simi Valley toward levels that would violate state air quality standards . And district data shows that Thousand Oaks violated state pollution standards Saturday and Sunday . And in Ojai , which suffered the next most severe pollution levels , the air was unhealthful by state standards Saturday and had improved only slightly Sunday . &quot; This is typical , &quot; said William Mount , deputy air_pollution control officer in Ventura County . &quot; Our smog season runs May through October , and the meteorology is conducive to fairly high levels of ambient ozone in those months . Over the weekend , we got strong sunlight and fairly stagnant conditions. &quot; Smog hit unhealthful levels for the first time in 1993 on May 9 , Mount said . Simi Valley , Ojai and other inland areas often suffer some of the worst pollution in the county because they are in &quot; convergence zones. &quot; Their canyons trap smog blown in from the Oxnard Plain by sea_breezes , and from the San Fernando Valley when winds are blowing_out to sea , Mount said . &quot; Winds have been onshore for the last few days , and what happens is all_the emissions from Ventura and Oxnard move onshore into the canyons , &quot; he explained . The high volume of holiday traffic could also have pushed the smog levels higher , Mount said . &quot; Vehicles typically are emitting higher levels of pollutants when the traffic ' s congested , &quot; he added . Ventura County ' s May-to-October smog season parallels changes in the weather that worsen the concentration of pollutants from vehicles and industry -- which actually remain fairly constant throughout the year , Mount said . &quot; It ' s just so meteorologically specific , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s what people don ' t seem to realize . The same amount of stuff is going_through the air every day . Everybody ' s driving their car the same way . &quot; A lot of people want to believe that our ozone problem is_due to the L . A . region , but typically our worst days for ozone are when the wind is blowing from the west. &quot; Air_pollution in Ventura County has decreased dramatically in recent years . In 1974 , its air_pollution levels violated the federal health standard for ozone on 122 days , but that dropped to 45 days in 1984 and only 13 days in 1993 , according to district statistics . Under the federal Clean Air Act , the county has until 2005 to reduce the number of unhealthful days to no more_than three in a three-year period .</TEXT>
