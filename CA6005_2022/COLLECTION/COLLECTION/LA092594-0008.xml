   <TEXT> Americans have long stereotyped China . Traders in the 19th Century brought_back images of erudite mandarins and laboring coolies along with their silks and teas . During the Republican era ( 1911-1949 ) , U.S. officials and missionaries depicted China as racked by conflict and corruption , yet striving to emulate American democracy . The American &quot; missionary complex &quot; to rescue and remold China in its own image was born . In the midst of the Chinese Civil War Mme . Chiang Kai-Shek passionately pleaded to a joint session of Congress for millions in aid &quot; to save the children of China , &quot; while Missouri Sen . Kenneth Wherry exhorted his colleagues to &quot; lift Shanghai up , up , forever up , until it is just like Kansas City ! &quot; Mao ' s revolution brought a new set of defining images : robotic &quot; blue ants &quot; laboring in lock-step ; ranting Red Guards denouncing American imperialism and attacking &quot; capitalist roaders ; &quot; and the rapprochement of the Nixon era . In the 1980s , Deng Xiaoping -- who emerged on top from the post-Mao power struggle -- was described as a &quot; cuddly communist &quot; and twice crowned &quot; Man of the Year &quot; by Time magazine for launching his &quot; capitalist &quot; economic reforms . The American missionary complex was reawakened and rushed to re-embrace the reformist China . This was fueled in 1989 by the sight of millions of students and workers challenging the communist state , quoting Paine and Jefferson , and erecting a replica of the Statue_of_Liberty opposite Mao ' s tomb in Tian An Men Square ( the hallowed ground of Chinese communism ) . These inspirational images -- broadcast by live satellite television -- were soon replaced by the brutal massacre of June 4 and the enduring icon of the lone man facing down three tanks on the Avenue of Eternal Peace . These perceptions have endured in the American public psyche for the last five years . Annual debates in the Congress over renewal of most-favored-nation trading status for China similarly revolved_around the political repression Chinese and Tibetans have known since Deng Xiaoping ' s hitmen invaded Beijing , guns blazing , on that hot summer night . The publication of two new books about China in the 1990s -- by longtime China-watcher Orville Schell and former New York Times Beijing correspondents Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn -- will do much to define American perceptions of China until the next cataclysmic event crosses our television screens . Both document in gory detail the repression and intimidation Deng ' s regime has unleashed on post-Tian An Men China but they also portray a diverse and complex society blossoming amid the Draconian coercion . The complexity they describe -- especially Schell -- will be difficult for Americans accustomed to simplistic stereotypes to digest , and will cause cognitive dissonance for many . The brutality and abuse of human_rights detailed in both books is shocking . Schell lays bare the horrors of the Chinese gulag , while Kristof and Wu-Dunn offer a chilling account of daily persecution and wrecked lives during 45 years under Communist_Party rule . Both recount endless examples of individuals subjected_to interrogation , harassment , ostracism , detention without charges , beatings , solitary confinement , forced abortions and sterilizations , hard labor , Draconian forms of torture and execution . Kristof and WuDunn recount the millions executed during various Maoist &quot; campaigns , &quot; and the estimated 30 million who perished in the largest famine in human history as a result of Mao ' s utopian &quot; Great Leap Forward. &quot; One of the more grotesque revelations comes_in secret Communist_Party documents depicting widespread cannibalism during the Cultural Revolution ( 1966-76 ) . Kristof writes that the motivation for the cannibalism was not hunger or psychopathic illness , but ideological . Cadavers of &quot; counterrevolutionaries &quot; were dissected and eaten_at public rallies orchestrated by zealous Communist_Party officials , &quot; students butchered and roasted their teachers and principals , &quot; while &quot; cafeterias displayed corpses . . . and served human flesh to government employees. &quot; These books are not for light reading before bed . Despite its title , &quot; China Wakes &quot; is a particularly damning indictment of the Chinese Communist_Party and a nation not fully aroused from its long socialist slumber . There is also a personal bitterness that emerges as the Pulitzer Prize winning authors recount their five years of harassment while trying to cover the China beat . Kristof and WuDunn offer important insights into the trials and tribulations of being a foreign correspondent in China . They displayed considerable fortitude and ingenuity in the face of constant surveillance by State Security goons , regular denunciations by Foreign Ministry monitors and an impenetrable bureaucracy . While illuminating of their travails , the autobiographical nature of the text and frequent reflections on how they felt in given situations adds a personal touch but detracts -- in this reader ' s opinion -- from an otherwise potent text . &quot; China Wakes &quot; also lacks a certain coherence . It is written in choppy segments , like a series of news dispatches . Orville Schell ' s &quot; Mandate of Heaven &quot; also strings together multiple vignettes of China in the ' 90s , but his is a more fluidly written volume . A seasoned observer of China , Schell has chronicled post-Mao China in several bestsellers : &quot; Watch Out for the Foreign Guests ! , &quot; &quot; To Get Rich Is Glorious ! &quot; and &quot; Discos and Democracy. &quot; Each has offered astute insights and polished narrative ; &quot; Mandate of Heaven &quot; is no different . Schell has a particularly keen eye and ability to render visual and aural observations into expressive prose . A master of metaphor and cross-cultural comparisons , Schell brings a levity to &quot; Mandate of Heaven &quot; that is missing in the depressing &quot; China Wakes. &quot; Both books reveal the diverse cast of characters that inhabit China today : pimps and prostitutes ; triads , hoodlums and gangsters ; cellular_phone and beeper-toting entrepreneurs ; newly rich tycoons with Swiss bank_accounts ; the 100 million homeless drifters and destitute vagrants ( the so-called &quot; floating population &quot; ) ; street_urchins and beggars ; child laborers in sweatshops ; disgruntled industrial workers ; rioting peasants ; despotic cadres ; corrupt officials ; paranoid hard-line leaders who lounge in private Jacuzzis ; swindlers , hustlers and scalpers ; bodybuilders and pin-ups ; rock musicians ; transvestites ; smugglers and gun runners ; democracy activists and political outcasts ; intimidated intellectuals ; underground writers and publishers ; masochistic prison_guards ; Han chauvinists and persecuted minorities ; eremitic monks and Christian clerics ; and other subterranean figures . China today is the home of talk radio ; horse_racing and off-track betting ; Formula One Grand Prix motor racing ; karaoke bars and sex clubs ; MTV and the Hard Rock Cafe . It is also a society were female infanticide is commonplace , late-term abortions are coerced and brides are bought and sold ( In Shanghai sex change operations can be had for a price ; in fact , virtually anything can be had for a price in today ' s China . Schell reports that even prisons charge fees for family visits , parole hearings and reductions in sentences , while Kristof and WuDunn claim that prisoners have secured release for cash payments or gifts . These phenomena are little known in the United States , where the Orwellian police_state , prison labor exports , democracy activists and human_rights abuses have received predominant press coverage since 1989 . More recently , reports of the China ' s booming economy and investment opportunities have hit the front pages ( thus resurrecting another longstanding image -- of the illusive China Market ) , but the pluralistic mosaic portrayed in these two books has not generally penetrated American perceptions . Will they stick ? Probably not , given the historical penchant for simple stereotypes and the difficulty of reporting on many of these phenomena ( especially by television correspondents ) . What is one to make of the new Hobbesian China ? Kristof and WuDunn wrestle with the complexities and implications . Their central thesis -- persuasively argued -- is that China today displays all_the classic signs of a disintegrating dynasty . Ruled by what they describe as &quot; red emperors , &quot; who live remote and isolated lives behind high walls and are out of touch with their own society and the world beyond the Middle Kingdom , the population ignore or feign compliance with imperial edicts . The official ideology is a hollow shell to which even the supposed Party faithful no longer pay lip_service . Corruption corrodes the body_politic while workers and peasants are_on the verge of revolt . An apparent illegitimacy pervades a moribund regime that clings_to power through the only methods it has left -- instruments of coercion . Yet Kristof and WuDunn are upbeat about China ' s future . They do not predict the dawning of democracy but believe that &quot; China will flourish and evolve &quot; . Orville Schell would concur , and his superb &quot; Mandate of Heaven &quot; offers ample evidence of the new dynamism in Chinese society . With an economy that has grown at 9 % per annum over the last decade and was the world ' s largest recipient of foreign investment in 1993 , China is slated to overtake the gross_national_product of Japan by 2000 and the United States by 2010 . The rise of China as the superpower of the 21st Century is a distinct possibility . Accommodating China as a rising power -- economically , militarily and politically -- will be a principal challenge to the international community and American foreign_policy in the years to come . However , given the myriad developments that the market has spawned , as described in these two books , the China juggernaut could just as easily come_off the rails . It is not unfathomable that China could fragment like the former Soviet_Union with various minority regions seeking their independence , or that China could convulse again in civil conflict . What is clear is that the current state of affairs is tenuous , and that the rush of foreign investment is pouring into a very volatile country . No nation of such size has undergone rapid and wrenching change of such magnitude in such a short period as has China over the past 15 years . Whether China grows strong and powerful or erupts in conflict , it will have a destabilizing effect on Asia and the United States . Prediction of China ' s future has always been hazardous , and as Kristof and WuDunn remind us &quot; China-watching is an exercise in humiliation , &quot; but the trajectory of change is clearly and elegantly described in these two compelling books .</TEXT>
