   <HEADLINE> ASSEMBLY OKS NEW OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING BAN ; LEGISLATION : THE MEASURE EXTENDS PROHIBITION TO VENTURA COUNTY . ASSEMBLY ALSO REJECTS A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE BROADENED STATE ' S ASSAULT WEAPON BAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Assembly on Tuesday passed and sent to Gov . Pete Wilson legislation to ban indefinitely new offshore oil drilling in state waters from Imperial Beach to the Oregon border . Although most of the state ' s coast is covered by a patchwork of prohibitions , this measure would extend the ban to Ventura County and remove provisions that would allow drilling to resume in some areas as early as next year . The Assembly , rushing toward tonight ' s scheduled adjournment , approved the bill on a 46-27 vote and sent it to Wilson , who has until the end of September to decide whether to sign or veto it . In other action Tuesday , the Senate passed a Democrat-backed campaign finance measure that probably faces a veto , while the Assembly approved another bill , also with doubtful prospects , that would overhaul a controversial school testing program . The Assembly also rejected a bill that would have broadened California ' s assault weapon ban so it would cover more of the high-powered firearms . The offshore oil drilling measure puts Wilson in something of an election-year bind . The governor has opposed offshore drilling since his days as mayor of San Diego , and as a U.S. senator he worked to persuade then President George_Bush to limit development of oil_wells in federal waters off California ' s coast . The drilling ban is needed to provide a uniform policy along the state ' s 1 # 000-mile coastline , according to Assemblyman Jack O ' Connell ( D-Carpinteria ) , the bill ' s sponsor . O ' Connell said that offshore drilling is a serious environmental hazard and that a major spill could devastate parts of the state ' s lucrative tourism industry . But the governor of late has been crusading against measures that harm the state ' s image as a good place to do business . Oil_companies , which have contributed significant sums to his campaigns , oppose the bill . Gavin McHugh , a lobbyist for Texaco , said the bill would limit job growth in the oil_industry and related fields that support the drilling operations . &quot; A permanent ban would block our development of new leases and eliminate the possibility of developing these resources for jobs , tax_revenue and royalties to the state , &quot; McHugh said in an interview . Wilson has not taken a position on the bill , according to a spokesman for his office . The Senate adopted a Democratic version of campaign finance reform on a 21-16 vote , the bare majority necessary . The measure , awaiting final passage in the Assembly , would limit contributions to legislative campaigns and provide_for partial taxpayer financing of those races . Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) , who voted for the bill , called it a &quot; token &quot; reform . &quot; But symbolically it is very important , &quot; Hayden said , because now there are no limits on contributions to legislative races . Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno said the bill was flawed because it would not stop party leaders from funneling huge amounts of cash from special_interest groups to their allies . The bill , Maddy said , &quot; provides all_the worst of the current system , plus public financing of campaigns. &quot; On another matter , the Assembly narrowly approved a bill to revamp the format for the controversial school performance tests known as the California Comprehensive Testing Program , formerly the California Learning Assessment System , and give parents a larger role in their development . A 41-28 party_line vote , the minimum required for approval , sent the bill , authored by Sen . Gary K . Hart ( D-Santa Barbara ) , back to the Senate for review of Assembly amendments . Democrats voted yes and Republicans voted no . Wilson is expected to veto the bill because it does not provide_for students to get individual test scores so they and their parents can measure progress against statewide standards . Assemblywoman Dede Alpert ( D-San Diego ) , who handled the bill on the lower house floor , called it &quot; truly a world class test , one that will really challenge our students , and determine if they are really prepared_for the workday world. &quot; Alpert said the new format expressly prohibits questions on the CLAS test that relate to the pupil ' s or parent ' s or guardian ' s personal beliefs or practices in sex , family life , morality or religion . She said parents also can choose to have their children not take the test . An opponent , Assemblyman Gil Ferguson ( R-Newport Beach ) , said the bill &quot; doesn ' t meet the mark &quot; because it does not meet three criteria : validity , reliability , and practicality . The assault weapons bill rejected in the Assembly represented the last chance for state Sen . David A . Roberti ( D-Van Nuys ) to clean_up his 1989 ban , which listed forbidden guns by name but gave gun makers and sellers an opening to market renamed models . The bill got 33 votes_in favor , eight short of the majority needed for passage . The vote followed an emotional exchange between Assemblyman Larry Bowler ( R-Elk Grove ) and Assemblywoman Jackie Speier ( D-Burlingame ) , who pushed for the bill ' s passage . Suggesting that Speier was out of her league , Bowler demanded to know how much Speier knew about the guns . She shot back : &quot; Have you ever been shot by an automatic_rifle ? Well , I have and I can show you a lot of scars. &quot; Speier was seriously wounded in 1978 during the Jonestown massacre in Guyana while an aide to the late Rep . Leo Ryan . Roberti said he was disappointed at the vote , but hoped to try to bring the bill up for another vote today . &quot; Maybe those who voted it down have to realize people in their districts don ' t like to hear the rat-a-tat-tat of automatic weapons. &quot; The Assembly , on a 58-0 vote , also passed and placed on the November ballot a proposed constitutional amendment to overhaul the state ' s judicial discipline process . The measure would remove the cloak of secrecy that has surrounded the disciplinary actions of the Commission on Judicial Performance . The Assembly also voted 73-0 to approved an Orange County lawmaker ' s bill that would put first-time child_molesters and violent rapists in prison for 25 years to life . The so-called &quot; one-strike &quot; bill carried by Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) now goes_back to the Senate for a vote today .
