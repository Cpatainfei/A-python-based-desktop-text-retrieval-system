   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; A MAGICAL ' MASK ' SENDS IN THE CLOWN ; THE FILM ' S STAR , JIM CARREY , IS ADEPT AT PHYSICAL HUMOR AND HAS A LIKABLE SCREEN PRESENCE . AND INDUSTRIAL LIGHT &amp; MAGIC ' S SPECIAL-EFFECTS TRICKS ARE SOMETHING TO SEE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is the summer Hollywood has decided Cartoons-R-Us . First &quot; The Flintstones &quot; had actors re-create cartoon roles , then &quot; The Lion King &quot; offered pure animation , and now comes &quot; The Mask , &quot; in which a flesh-and-blood performer is turned_into an elastic , living cartoon . Much of the early buzz about &quot; The Mask &quot; involved the wizardly computer-generated special_effects that allow kick-sand-in-my-face bank_clerk Stanley Ipkiss to turn_into an off-kilter superhero whose India_rubber body contorts like Spiderman and absorbs punishment like something out of Looney Tunes . And , masterminded by the imps at Industrial Light &amp; Magic , who ought to just wrap the visual effects Oscar and take it home , the tricks in &quot; The Mask &quot; are something to see . When the Mask ' s body recovers from being flattened like a tortilla and his eyes literally pop_out at the sight of a beautiful woman , audience eyes are likely to roll as well . Yet despite all this technology it is heartening to report that &quot; The Mask ' s &quot; sine_qua_non , the factor it would be hard-pressed to live without , is the actor who plays both the cartoon and alter_ego Ipkiss , Jim Carrey . Best known as the lucky man whose salary made a Roadrunner leap to millions per picture after the unexpected success of &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective , &quot; Carrey is revealed here as a comic actor of charm and talent . Not only is he adept at physical humor , the kind of knockabout stuff that recalls the classic silent clowns , but Carrey also has a bright and likable screen presence , a lost puppy quality that is surprisingly endearing . And when he plays the Mask , wearing a supple and non-confining latex facial apparatus designed by Greg Cannom , Carrey displays a manic side as well , doing riffs from old movies and dishy impersonations of everyone from Elvis to Clint Eastwood to Sally Field accepting her Oscar . Amid all these amusing elements , it may_not matter very much that &quot; The Mask &quot; runs_out of energy faster than its star does . Though director Charles Russell knows how to keep things loose and playful , the movie doesn ' t aspire to be more_than a gaudy showcase for Carrey ' s ability and ILM ' s magic , and anyone looking_for something else is open_to disappointment . In line with this , Mike Werb ' s screenplay , based on a story by Michael Fallon and Mark Verdeiden and before that on a comic-book character , is less a sturdy narrative than an extended premise on which all these assorted antics can be hung like ornaments on a tree . The pre-Mask Ipkiss lives and works in Edge City and wonders why nice guys finish last . A shy pushover and dupe whose primary emotional attachment is to his clever terrier Milo ( one of the more entertaining of recent dog performances ) , Ipkiss just about stops breathing when sultry Tina Carlyle ( Cameron Diaz ) stops by his desk at the bank . A headliner at the chic Coco Bongo Club , Tina is also the girlfriend of mobster Dorian Tyrel ( Peter Greene ) , but Ipkiss can ' t get her out of his mind . And though the movie presents Tina as little more_than the scantily_clad physical embodiment of Roger Rabbit ' s wife Jessica , model Diaz , in her first screen role , has enough presence to help us see past the tinsel . At a particularly morose point in his life , Ipkiss comes_across a nondescript green wooden mask , which , he later learns , is probably of Scandinavian origin and carved to represent Loki , the Norse god of mischief , permanently banned from Valhalla for his pranks . Not surprisingly , then , when Ipkiss puts the mask on , havoc breaks_loose . Normally timid , he becomes an amoral live_wire out of one of the Tex Avery cartoons he admires , a party animal with a face the color of key_lime pie capable of robbing banks and whirling off like a pastel tornado . That robbery aside , the Mask isn ' t really a bad_guy , and his most memorable moments are song-and-dance riffs so antic that in interviews Carrey has taken_to calling his character &quot; Fred Astaire on acid. &quot; Whether passionately twirling with Tina in a canary-yellow ensemble , playing the maniac French boulevardier in beret and loud pants or turning a SWAT team into a conga_line with his Cuban Pete impersonation , Carrey is a treat on his feet . While no one wants to look this kind of gift_horse in the mouth , it is hard to watch &quot; The Mask &quot; without wishing its pluses were attached_to a story even a trifle more inventive or involving . But in the glory days of Cartoons-R-Us , that is an awful lot to ask . * MPAA rating : PG-13 for &quot; some stylized violence. &quot; Times guidelines : violence of the cartoon variety and a steamy dance sequence .
