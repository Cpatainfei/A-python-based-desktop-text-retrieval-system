   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; OFFICIALS IN VENTURA COUNTY IGNORE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS TO AID OTHERS ; DISASTER : THE 6.6. JOLT WAS THE START OF A SELFLESS AND HECTIC WEEK . A FILLMORE COUNCILMAN RELUCTANTLY GIVES THE ORDER TO RAZE BADLY DAMAGED HOMES , INCLUDING HIS OWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Darkness . Then , abruptly , a jolt . A crash . Rumbling , screaming , shattering , tumbling . Panic . And again , darkness . Alone before dawn Monday in a hilltop parking_lot in Simi Valley , nighttime security_guard Mike Tam watched the shuddering earth heave through the San Fernando Valley and on toward Ventura County . One by one , lights flared and went dim as transformers blew . &quot; It was a hell of a show , &quot; Tam said . &quot; I could have used my surfboard up there on that ridge. &quot; Across Ventura County in Fillmore , Roger Campbell was not so sanguine . Campbell is a city councilman . A deputy fire_chief . And Fillmore ' s only emergency medical technician . As soon as the trembling stopped , he sprang into action . Jumping into his firefighter ' s boots , stashed as always by his bedside , Campbell stumbled through the house , grabbing shoes for his family and clearing a path through the rubble . He ripped the front_door off its hinges and hurried his wife and two teen-age children outside . Even in the dark , Campbell had an inkling that the quake had shoved his 90-year-old house off its foundation . But when he dashed_off to the fire_station at 4:40 a.m. , he shelved all thoughts of his personal tragedy . * It was the start of a selfless -- and hectic -- week . &quot; I ' ve mainly been working_on solving other people ' s problems , &quot; Campbell said . So have Julie Merich and Nan Thompson , emergency_room nurses at Simi Valley Hospital . They were nearing the end of their graveyard_shift Monday , helping physician Pam Biren deal with two patients who had just come for aid when the quake hit . Ceiling tiles smashed to the floor . The big sliding glass door exploded . Medicine and supplies tumbled off shelves . Sugary-smelling slicks of liquid Tylenol and Motrin oozed across the floor -- yellow and red pools snaking around the rubble . &quot; As soon as it started , we looked_at each other and said , ' Earthquake . Big earthquake. ' Then we ran to the doorway , &quot; Merich said . As the shaking subsided , Biren ran to check on the patients . Then , fearful that the whole building would collapse , the three emergency_room staffers shuttled their two patients -- a man with a sore back and an asthmatic woman -- out the door . Merich guided them to the parking_lot and sat them down in the chill , still darkness . The quiet was short-lived . Alone and in clusters , huddled under blankets or shuffling in slippers , the wounded , the scared and the dazed began to arrive within 10 minutes of the fearsome jolt . Most were bleeding from cuts , suffered as they tripped through rubble-filled hallways or lay stunned under fallen objects . A few had more serious injuries -- fractures , chest_pains , panic_attacks . As her watch inched toward 5 a.m. , Thompson held a flashlight in the hospital parking_lot while Biren stitched up a gash on a young_man ' s face . With that first , nerve-racking operation , they launched a primitive , open-air emergency_room . * Scores of off-duty doctors and nurses , some from neighboring cities , came_by in sweats and sneakers to offer their services . They quickly set_up an assembly_line to suture wounds in the parking_lot . Although the hospital ' s emergency generator had kicked_in immediately after the quake , no one wanted to go_back into the building . Not with ceiling tiles on the floor and aftershocks on the way . &quot; It seems like we took_care of at least 50 or 60 people by flashlight , &quot; Merich said . &quot; I had them lined_up on the curb . I was running_around like a chicken with my head cut off. &quot; Campbell in Fillmore and Merich in Simi Valley were among the first to respond to the earthquake that rocked Southern California with horrific force at 4:31 a.m. Monday . Although it was centered in Northridge , the magnitude 6.6 quake sent devastating tremors throughout Ventura County , shattering lives in Fillmore and Simi Valley and wrecking buildings in Moorpark and Thousand Oaks as well . The force of the quake bounced Larry Perillo -- a 6-foot , 2-inch , 280-pound quality_control worker -- clear_out of his bed in Simi Valley . He flipped in the air , landed face-down and hit his head on a table , leaving him bruised and disoriented . A few miles away in northeastern Thousand Oaks , Anne Weidenweber was jolted awake and tried to warn her husband that the heavy mirror behind their bed could come flying down on top of them . But he could not hear her shriek -- just then , the mantle and chimney came plunging down , bricks cascading in a thunderous crescendo . * And in a Vons supermarket in Simi Valley , Robert Moss found himself pinned in an aisle when the quake toppled a huge Coca-Cola display he was stocking . It took him 90 minutes to extricate himself and slither around the debris to freedom , using the light on his pager to guide him down the aisle . Amid all_the noise and destruction , Mary Beth Wolford , superintendent of the Simi Valley Unified School District , slumbered -- tucked into a comfortable bed in a guest room at a friend ' s house in Sun City West , Ariz . But her oblivion ended with a scare almost as frightening as the quake . Wolford awoke to a television_news account of the disaster , featuring an interview with a Simi Valley resident . Trembling , he described the fear . The chaos . The wreckage . &quot; The personal side of me was saying , ' I ' m glad I wasn ' t there at 4:31 a.m. , ' but the professional side was saying , ' What a lousy day to be gone , ' &quot; Wolford said . &quot; The more I heard , the worse I felt. &quot; Frantic to return and investigate the damage to her schools , Wolford scrambled to get a ticket -- any ticket -- to Southern California . When she finally got aboard a flight to Burbank , she found it filled with other nail-biting travelers desperately anxious about whether their homes , businesses and relatives had survived the quake . Wolford arrived in Simi Valley about 3:30 p.m. , took one look_at the broken glass littering her living_room , and headed straight out on a tour of the schools . * Most of them looked bad . And three -- Township Elementary School , Valley View Junior_High and Simi Valley High -- looked downright dangerous . Wolford ' s succinct assessment : &quot; It was a total mess. &quot; As Tuesday dawned in Fillmore , Campbell still had no clue about the earthquake ' s total punch . He had heard vague rumors about crumbled freeways , collapsed apartment_buildings , crushed bodies . He knew the epicenter was somewhere in the San Fernando Valley . But beyond that , he didn ' t know much . And he didn ' t much care . Every last ounce of Campbell ' s energy was focused_on his city , its three square_miles of territory and its 13 # 000 anxious residents . And he had more_than enough to worry about . Much of Fillmore ' s downtown district was destroyed . Bricks were scattered , helter-skelter , across cracked streets . Homes had crumpled like paper . Hundreds of people had jammed into a makeshift shelter at the San Cayetano Elementary School . Like scores of other firefighters and city officials , Campbell was working frantically . On barely two hours of sleep , he was coordinating the response to Fillmore ' s trauma . His crew was supervising building inspections , organizing the shelter , preparing an ordinance declaring a local state of emergency . No time to listen to the radio . No place to plug_in a television_set . No idea where to buy a newspaper . &quot; I wanted to know what was going_on in my own town , and I didn ' t pay_attention to anything else , &quot; Campbell said . He also didn ' t pay_attention to his own family ' s plight , focusing instead on those worse off . Finally , around noon , he managed to wrangle a_few minutes break from his post at the command center . He rushed to his home -- just three blocks away -- and saw , for the first time , the damage . The lime green , two-story house that he had lived_in for more_than 20 years was tilted several degrees to the west . Cockeyed and slumping , it looked as though it were about to collapse . But despite the clear danger , dozens of Campbell ' s friends were traipsing through the off-kilter door , carrying his furniture to safety . Elsewhere in the county , other quake victims spent Tuesday performing similarly grim tasks . They cleaned their homes or tried to salvage cherished possessions . They stood_in 30-minute grocery_store lines for water , flashlights and canned_food -- in at least one case , ignoring a sign that warned &quot; Shop_at Your Own Risk. &quot; They consoled distraught friends and called worried relatives . * In Thousand Oaks , council_members showed their congressman , Anthony C . Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) , their quake-ravaged library , picking their way around fragments from the metal ceiling that had blasted loose during the temblor . &quot; It looks_like Beirut , &quot; City_Manager Grant Brimhall said . &quot; Or worse. &quot; In Simi Valley , Wolford strode through the city with building inspectors and held conference after conference to decide which schools could reopen . And , in her home just blocks from the Simi Valley Hospital , nurse Merich tried to relax after the most hectic 15-hour shift of her career . Like many , Merich could not find peace . Although they tried to nap Tuesday , many Ventura County residents found themselves twitchy and tense . Even when they were lying_in bed , their muscles stayed taut , their hands reached_out toward flashlights and hard-soled shoes , their minds ran_through an endless catalogue of objects broken and friends left homeless . &quot; I didn ' t want to go_to_sleep because I was so afraid the Big One would come , &quot; 13-year-old Sarah Jenkins said . Others shared her fear -- and wondered how to prepare . &quot; In Mexico , we all have the idea that we should run outside as fast as possible , but here , they tell us to stay inside and get_in the doorway , &quot; Jose Lopez , 31 , said . &quot; But there ' s not enough room in the doorway for all_of us. &quot; By Monday evening , those who survived the quake with homes and possessions intact felt ready to get their lives back to normal . Some even felt relaxed enough to make a_few earthquake jokes . At a_Thousand Oaks council meeting marked by three small aftershocks , council_members expressed gratitude that their city had suffered less than nearby Simi Valley . Councilman Alex Fiore chuckled : &quot; This time , I guess it just wasn ' t our fault. &quot; The sign_in Fillmore on Wednesday seemed pitifully inadequate . * The entire downtown district was cordoned off , sheriff ' s deputies were patrolling homes and shops to prevent looting , and volunteer firemen were trying to move the emergency shelter to a bigger location . But the orange sign posted on a traffic cone near Santa Clara Street offered scanty news : &quot; Traffic Subject_to Delays Due_to Special Event. &quot; For a change , Campbell was free to help his family instead of aiding others . He scarcely knew where to start . &quot; I have no earthquake insurance , &quot; he said . &quot; I am financially devastated . I don ' t know what to do . Except work_on cars . I know I can make money working_on cars . I ' ll just have to keep working and hope the people who owe me money will pay me money. &quot; But despite his resolve , he did not get much done . &quot; I put_on my coveralls like I ' m going_to work , but I haven ' t touched a thing , &quot; he said . Like others who watched life savings crumble in the earth ' s violent spasm , Campbell got a small measure of support Wednesday , when President Clinton declared Ventura County a disaster_area , eligible for federal aid . But they also received some bad news . Caltech scientists reported that aftershock activity was unusually vigorous -- and migrating toward Ventura County . Two strong Wednesday afternoon temblors were centered barely six miles northeast of Simi Valley . Wolford did not need a geology degree to figure that out . When the floor started pitching shortly after 1 p.m. Wednesday , Wolford dove under a table in the district office , where she had been answering press calls about school damage . &quot; Right away , I said : ' that ' s a 5.1 , &quot; ' she said . &quot; My colleague said : ' No , no , no , that ' s a 3.2 , I ' ll bet you a dollar. ' As it turned_out , I was right on target . When we heard on the radio that it was a 5.1 , everyone in the room offered to give me a dollar . And we had a bit of laughter , which we desperately needed to break the tension. &quot; The chuckle might have made everyone feel better for an instant . But within minutes the district office was deluged with phone_calls from frightened students , teachers and custodians . No one wanted to go_back to school , not even to the schools that had been declared safe . Within an hour , Wolford had dashed_off a press_release canceling school in the Simi Valley Unified District for the rest of the week . &quot; I knew immediately that we ' d have further damage from those aftershocks , &quot; Wolford said . &quot; I thought : ' There goes the plan for tomorrow. ' &quot; It was Thursday . Three days had passed . But the aftershocks kept coming , smaller but still potent in some pockets of eastern Ventura County . And the talk kept coming as well . * For some it was idle chatter . How many pictures fell_off your wall ? How scared was your cat ? How long did_it take you to vacuum up the glass ? For those most affected , the talk was serious , and wrenching . Where will I live if it rains this weekend ? How can I get loans to repair my house ? Why won ' t the building inspector let me enter my shop ? Federal emergency aid offices opened at St . Francis of Assisi Catholic_Church in Fillmore and at the Sycamore Drive Community_Center in Simi Valley to answer those nuts-and-bolts questions . Hundreds of quake victims lined_up at the FEMA centers , some waiting for hours in the bright sunshine . But most got no tangible help Thursday -- just a sheaf of papers and an appointment for an individual counseling session later in the week . &quot; I don ' t even know what FEMA is , &quot; Campbell said , discouraged and disconsolate as the magnitude of his personal tragedy began to sink_in . &quot; I don ' t even know what they can do for us . All they did was give us pieces_of_paper and tell us to come_back tomorrow. &quot; The officers of the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- well versed in helping Californians after last fall ' s disastrous wildfires -- promised to work_on pragmatic problems soon . The philosophical questions , however , were harder to deal with . &quot; A lot of people have lost everything , so they ' re asking why , &quot; said Father Norm Supancheck of St . Francis of Assisi . &quot; I tell some of them I don ' t know -- only God knows . Some , I reassure that we can go_forward from here . For others , though , that ' s not enough. &quot; On Thursday , like every day since the earthquake , more_than 200 people attended church_services at St . Francis of Assisi -- a dramatic jump from the normal attendance of about three dozen . Many were children , who seemed to find peace in the sanctuary . &quot; It ' s beautiful to see how the children who haven ' t slept for days come_to church and fall_asleep leaning against their parents because they feel safe there , &quot; Supancheck said . While the newly homeless , suddenly jobless and simply shaken sought financial_aid or emotional support , administrators across the county continued the gritty work of assessing damages on Day 4 of Quake Week . Building inspectors plodded from door to door , pasting red , yellow or green tags to indicate the state of each structure they investigated . Surprisingly , many had good news -- at least in eastern Ventura County . In Thousand Oaks , officials checking out the library concluded that they had overestimated the damage . A new computer_system , installed the day before the earthquake , was working again -- although it had been sprayed with water when a sprinkler burst during the temblor . Despite the collapsed ceiling , City_Manager Brimhall pronounced the library structurally sound . * Although damage estimates topped $ 5 million in the Simi Valley Unified School District , the structural weakness was not as bad as it had appeared . After another exhausting day of touring schools , conferring_with inspectors and answering calls , Wolford reported Thursday that the schools once considered ruined could be salvaged . &quot; Some of the damage we were fearful was structural turned_out to be merely cosmetic , &quot; she said . &quot; we ' ll be able to repair them and the buildings will be in good_shape . They may_not look nice , but they ' ll be safe. &quot; Across the county in Fillmore , the devastation was every bit as bad as it had first appeared . Meeting as usual Thursday night , the Fillmore City_Council decided to take_control of the demolition bulldozer . Any building deemed a public hazard could be razed with 48 hours notice , the council_members decided . It was the toughest vote of Campbell ' s life . &quot; Basically , the ordinance we passed was a death sentence for my house , &quot; he said . &quot; I voted for it . But it was hard. &quot; The house he had lived_in nearly all his married life , the house he had raised his two children in , the house he had renovated room by room , would be swept_away by a city bulldozer . Logically , Campbell knew he had to tear_down the home . Leaning and shaky , it clearly jeopardized his elderly neighbor ' s house . Repairing his house would cost $ 60 # 000 to $ 75 # 000 . For that price , he said , he might as well build a new house . The thought was daunting . He had managed to find a temporary apartment for his family -- one bedroom for the four of them , &quot; not nearly enough room , but it ' s a roof over our heads. &quot; Dozens of tasks still lay ahead . He had to look_for a new home . He had to get price quotes from contractors . He had to keep_up with his City_Council and Fire_Department chores . He had to earn money , lots of money , in his auto repair_shop . &quot; My personal life is a shambles , &quot; Campbell said . &quot; I ' m trying to do a bunch of things at once . I have to , because I ' m in trouble. &quot; * The portable toilets stank . The lines were long . The paperwork was endless . And the check was nowhere near the mail . Still , many of the earthquake victims waiting for federal assistance Friday remained good-natured , patient , and even optimistic . Some were frustrated -- wanting immediate answers when they could get only future appointments . But others were glad to be taking some action , glad to be talking to people who could help . * Strolling up and down the line in Simi Valley , distributing fliers and flashing his smile , disaster relief worker Michael Kavanaugh tried to keep everyone cheerful . &quot; If people are hurting , we ' re there , &quot; said Kavanaugh , a retired police_officer from Roanoke , Va . &quot; that ' s the whole point , isn ' t it ? We ' re here to help and we ' ll be here for as long as we need to be here. &quot; John Ayers , for one , was glad to hear that . The Simi Valley computer_programmer had just experienced a rather traumatic Friday . He had been rooting through the Elks Lodge , seeking a wheelchair for his injured son , when a series of aftershocks rolled through eastern Ventura County about 11 a.m. Rubble rained_down around him as he dashed for the door . A few hours later , he was checking out his chimney when another jolt hit . The earth swayed slightly as he clutched the roof in terror . Two near-escapes in one day convinced Ayers to stay outside and on the ground -- and the FEMA line outside Simi Valley ' s Sycamore Drive Community_Center was as good a place as any . Like many , he was not sure what he might need from the government . But he thought he might as well queue_up , just in case . Perhaps , he said , he would ask_for a low-interest loan to fix his cracked foundation . On Friday , though , Ayers could not think that far ahead . After four tense nights of fitful sleep , he had one main wish : &quot; Let ' s just have a little peace , &quot; he said wearily . But , even on the fifth day , peace seemed far away . Wolford was harried and harassed at the district office in Simi Valley , fielding calls from school_principals , custodians and worried parents . Campbell was harried and harassed at his auto repair_shop in Fillmore , trying to take_care of business and find new lodging for his family . And John Dosen was harried and harassed at an industrial building in Newbury Park , welcoming a small army of State Farm Insurance_claims adjusters from across the country . More_than 800 out-of-town employees joined the 250 stationed in State Farm ' s regional office in Westlake Village . Before they could fan_out to handle the claims -- which were expected to reach nearly 100 # 000 -- they shuttled through an &quot; induction center &quot; in Newbury Park , picking_up maps , flashlights , hard_hats , gloves , and instructions on how to assess earthquake damage . &quot; To a casual observer , this may look a little chaotic , but really , it ' s organized , &quot; Dosen said , as claims adjusters in red &quot; Special Disaster Team &quot; T-shirts swarmed through the building . Experienced in dealing with natural disasters -- many spoke calmly of having &quot; worked Andrew , &quot; as in the hurricane -- the claims adjusters nonetheless admitted some fear of aftershocks . Yet they all tried to ignore the shakes , girding themselves for six weeks of nonstop work . &quot; You can make the adrenaline rush last that long , &quot; said Karen O ' Neill , who left her husband and 4-month-old daughter in icy Ohio when she flew west to process earthquake claims . &quot; It was 21 degrees below zero when I left , &quot; O ' Neill said , marveling . &quot; Here , I don ' t even need a jacket. &quot; For Jennifer Jimenez , Saturday meant : Another morning of waking_up in the Royal High_School gym , surrounded by crying babies , barking dogs and snoring men . Another trip to the smelly portable toilets . Another communal shower in the women ' s trailer . Another pass_through the cafeteria line for sticky_buns , fruit and cereal . Another makeshift day . But the 23-year-old mother was not complaining . She had slept_in her house at the east end of Simi Valley the first night after the quake -- or rather , she had stood vigil over her infant ' s crib , fearful that at any moment the creaky old building would cave_in . &quot; Then I came here , &quot; Jimenez said , gesturing to the Red_Cross shelter . &quot; And I had my first good sleep . I know this building can hold an 8.9 earthquake . I wish I was at_home . But I feel safe here. &quot; Many of her fellow shelter-dwellers seemed to agree . Despite the inconveniences , they expressed boundless admiration for the Red_Cross volunteers , and deep gratitude for the temporary housing . Hundreds of people have slept at Red_Cross shelters in Simi Valley and Fillmore each night since the quake , and hundreds more have accepted emergency food and water . &quot; These people couldn ' t be better , &quot; said Frances Littlefield , 82 , who spent Saturday morning reading the paper and joking with the volunteers . &quot; They ' re all wonderful. &quot; As Littlefield sat in her wheelchair , cozy in a white terry cloth bathrobe , 8-year-old Jessica Valadez played with her pet rats in the shelter ' s lobby . Meanwhile , Danielle Maston , 12 , tried to shush her puppy , which had started barking furiously in its tiny carrier . Their public_schools superintendent , Wolford , had just formulated a plan that would put them back in the classroom within days -- a plan that made neither girl happy . Surrounded by games , pets and potential playmates , Jessica and Danielle said they considered life in the Royal High gym even better than summer_camp . And they wanted the vacation to continue . &quot; I actually don ' t like my house much , &quot; Jessica said . &quot; It ' s too boring there . Here , they give us lots of activities and it ' s much more fun. &quot; The good cheer and hard work of those who had come_to Ventura County to help the needy also impressed Campbell . After spending three hours with FEMA officials , Campbell said he felt optimistic for the first time since he had paused to contemplate his plight . &quot; I know financially I ' ve taken a terrible hit , and I lost 21 years of history in my home , but I know that FEMA can help me . Not with gifts , but with loans , loans that I can pay_back , &quot; he said . While fellow firefighters escorted merchants into their wrecked downtown stores , Campbell stayed in his auto repair_shop , tuning_up cars so his customers could get_back to work Monday . &quot; I was in a real despair , a really bad depression , &quot; Campbell said . &quot; But I haven ' t cried_for almost 24 hours. &quot; * For some , prayer . For others , Joe Montana . After a week of terrifying tremors , confounding commutes and boggling bureaucracy , Ventura County residents plan to take solace Sunday in meditation , recreation or vegetation . Father Dennis Mongrain expects hundreds to attend his morning service at St . Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley , looking_for answers to that eternal enigma : Why ? Why the floods ? Why the fires ? Why the quakes ? Why me ? Unable to answer such cosmic questions , Mongrain decided instead to remind his congregation of the earthquake ' s primary lesson : homes and cars , even fat bank_accounts , can crumble in an instant , felled by nature ' s awesome force . Focus_on building spiritual and personal_relationships , not on accumulating material_possessions , Mongrain will urge . After all , he plans to tell them , &quot; You can ' t take your surfboard to heaven. &quot; While some will seek peace in churches , other quake victims will look_to escape their sorrows and fears by plopping down in front of a television_set for a day of NFL playoff action . Watching the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers , the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills sounded like an ideal Sunday to Joe Martini , who has spent several nights in Simi Valley ' s Red_Cross shelter , bunking_down on an army cot and showering in a trailer . &quot; I ' m sure they ' ll have the playoffs on TV here , &quot; he said . &quot; That really will be fun -- something to take our minds off what ' s happened. &quot; But even the best diversion will not distract Campbell and thousands of other county residents -- still stunned and disbelieving . &quot; I just have to start rebuilding a life , &quot; Campbell said . &quot; A life that was pretty nice last Sunday. &quot; Canvas Cities With rain in the forecast , officials were hurrying Saturday to erect tent cities to shelter at least some of the estimated 14 # 500 people living_in parks and parking_lots . About 7 # 000 people can be housed in 72 large military tents 164 medium-sized tents sent to Van Nuys from military_installations around the state . Lanark Park , 21816 Lanark Street in Canoga Park , 2 # 500 people . Winnetka Recreation Center , 8401 Winnetka Avenue , Canoga Park , 600 people . Valley Plaza Park , 12240 Archwood Street in North Hollywood , 1 # 000 people . Balboa Park , 17015 Burbank Blvd. , Encino , 1 # 000 people .
