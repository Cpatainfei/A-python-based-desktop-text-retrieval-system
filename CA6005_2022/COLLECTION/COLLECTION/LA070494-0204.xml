   <TEXT> When I was 1 year old , a beautiful , dark-haired girl was born thousands of miles away . Her parents named her Svetlana Svyataya , which in Russian means roughly &quot; Light of the Saints. &quot; When Svetlana was 4 , she played_on the muddy banks of a creek running past her grandparents ' Ukrainian farm . I was 5 , mucking about on the muddy banks of Pittsburgh ' s Allegheny River , which ran past my grandparents ' cottage . Svetlana eventually moved to St . Petersburg , where she grew_up and began to work_on a doctorate in astrophysics . I ended_up in St . Petersburg as a journalist . We met , fell_in_love and decided to marry . But today , more_than a year after our marriage , Svetlana cannot enter the United States to stay . She has been there once -- with me , after an epic struggle with the U.S._government , one that indeed has still not ended . Like most foreigners , my wife needs a visa : permission from the U.S._government to enter the country . In the frank words of Duke Austin , a senior spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington : &quot; Just because you ' re marrying someone doesn ' t mean they ' re eligible to come_to the States. &quot; Getting a visa isn ' t easy . It depends_on your citizenship , why you want to visit the States , whether you are rich or poor , sick or healthy , married or single , male or female . Svetlana and I learned all this about 17 months ago when we got engaged and I decided to introduce her to my parents . So we went_to the U.S. Consulate in St . Petersburg for a visa . The State_Department handles all tourist visa applications . Diplomats judge applications at their whim : They are not required to explain denials and there is no appeal . In Russia -- and in other countries where the economy is wheezing or the political situation unstable -- the State_Department is particularly miserly with tourist visas . Diplomats say about 20 % of the Russians to whom they grant tourist or business visas don ' t come_back , choosing instead to live and work illegally in America . Young , single Russians -- and especially young , pretty Russian women -- are the least likely applicants to return from the States , diplomats say , and so their applications are often denied . The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said it denied about 20 % of all Russian non-immigrant visa applications last year , and 45 % of all such applications from people 18 to 25 . None of which , we thought , concerned us . We were wrong . At the consulate , we were told not to even bother applying . The officer on_duty said a single 23-year-old like Svetlana could not receive a tourist visa because &quot; she might marry someone and not come back. &quot; I explained that we were engaged and that I wanted Svetlana to meet my parents . I explained that I had a job and Svetlana her studies , that we had an apartment and a dog and a car in St . Petersburg and would have to come_back . The officer was unmoved ; the State_Department just couldn ' t trust us . If Svetlana and I sneakily got_married on a tourist visa , he said , &quot; it would really screw_up our paperwork. &quot; The officer suggested a different route : the K-1 fiancee ' s visa . This &quot; fast-track , hassle-free &quot; visa would &quot; be ready very quickly , perhaps in a month. &quot; But we would have to get_married within 90 days of arriving in the States . For Russian-American couples like us , there are no other options . The government forbids you to introduce your Russian girlfriend ( or boyfriend ) to your parents unless you ' re prepared to get_married . We were prepared ; but not every couple looking down the barrel of Uncle_Sam ' s shotgun can say that . So we agreed to apply for the K-1 . The State_Department , at least , was happy : They had passed the buck . The K-1 is an immigration visa , which meant we would be dealing with the INS . The diplomats would have to do much of the work_on our case , but technically we weren ' t their problem anymore . So , we asked , what does getting the K-1 visa involve ? Diplomats that day -- and every day for the next several months -- gave us wildly different , often incorrect and infuriatingly vague answers . Several insisted that I would have to fly to Washington to collect an INS application in_person . Not true ; my father mailed one to me . * Despite our requests , no one would lay out the application process for us ; most diplomats would instead tell us only enough to get us to the next step_in the process . Frustrated , we called the INS . A computer answered . &quot; Our automated system is less than perfect , &quot; admitted INS spokesman Austin dryly . &quot; We got 7 million telephone inquiries the year before last . If we answered telephones manually , it would take every employee working every working hour. &quot; Indeed , if the diplomats had been evasive , INS officers were too busy drowning in their own paperwork . Our bulky file was added_to a pile of nearly 4 million immigration applications , reviewed by a mere 2 # 166 officers of the 18 # 000-member INS . &quot; We ' re permitting in excess of 900 # 000 people to immigrate to the United States ( annually ) . In the marriage category , the numbers are running 140 # 000 to 150 # 000 a year , &quot; Austin said . &quot; Nor is it an easy rubber stamp. &quot; Nor is it . We gathered and filled_out a mountain of documents for the INS , only to have our application rejected for using &quot; old forms. &quot; The rejected application was sent not to my parents in Maryland but into the black_hole of the Russian regular mail system . ( Today , more_than a year later , it still hasn ' t arrived. ) We got the &quot; new forms &quot; -- which were exactly the same as the old ones , except for an errata slip raising the filing fee from $ 35 to $ 75 -- and reapplied . * Meanwhile , the infamously disorganized Russian government_issued Svetlana her passport in three days , thanks in part to a chocolate_cake and a bottle of red_wine given to passport officials . And Svetlana and I got_married in her hometown church ( unofficially -- if we got legally married , Svetlana would then need a wife ' s visa ) . The INS approved our application in June . We arranged to rent a beach_house in Maryland in August . Svetlana took_leave from her graduate work , while I priced tickets to the States . But at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow , instead of a visa we were given more forms : Packet Three . &quot; After you ' ve filled_out Packet Three , you can come get Packet Four , &quot; the unsmiling official said . Packets Three and Four were the beginning of &quot; the Questions. &quot; Ever trafficked drugs ? Ever gambled ? Do you intend to be a ward of the state ? Have you ever engaged in genocide or ordered the killing of any person ? Do you plan to practice polygamy ? Work as a prostitute or a pimp ? Overthrow the U.S._government ? That government , guardian of the Bill of Rights , even asks whether applicants have ever been accused -- not convicted , just accused -- of a crime . We turned_in Packet Four and were told to report a week later to a grungy Moscow clinic for Svetlana ' s medical_exam . The exam included an AIDS test ; an HIV-positive result means no visa . The clinic contacts -- by telegram -- only those applicants whose results are positive . AIDS tests are notoriously unreliable , but the U.S._government reports all positive results to the Russian government , whose policies strip people with AIDS of many rights . The summer slipped_away without results ( and , thankfully , telegrams ) . We let the beach_house go . Finally , in September , we got the visa . * My parents met us at the Baltimore airport with flowers and hugs ( but not before INS officers had fingerprinted Svetlana ) . We got_married -- officially , this time -- at the Rockville County_Courthouse in Maryland , where bride and groom take a number and wait in a lobby under signs that sternly forbid rice-throwing . A more substantial wedding -- the kind my mother would have liked -- would have required long-term planning made impossible by the uncertainties of the visa process . At the INS Baltimore office , we traded our marriage certificate for more forms . We were unexpectedly asked to pay $ 120 . And then the kicker : We were told to come_back in two months for our next interview and -- surprise ! -- not to leave the country in the meantime . ( Never mind that the diplomats had repeatedly assured me we would be able to return to Russia immediately. ) I told a supervisor that my job would be jeopardized if we stayed . But he would n ' t consider my request to advance the interview date , so I demanded the $ 120 back . He refused , explaining that ' s the fee for getting an interview date . We got a lawyer . He was sympathetic , but this late in the game , $ 100-an-hour sympathy was about all he could offer . So we quit . Today we are back in St . Petersburg , waiting for a wife ' s visa . Consular officials say this visa is more complicated than the &quot; fast-track , hassle-free &quot; K-1 . We have plans to travel_to America later this summer , but when I suggested Svetlana buy a bathing_suit for the trip , she just laughed .</TEXT>
