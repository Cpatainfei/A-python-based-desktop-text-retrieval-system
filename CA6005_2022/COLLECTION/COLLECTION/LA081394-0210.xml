   <HEADLINE> CLINIC SLAYING SUSPECT CHARGED UNDER FEDERAL LAW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sending a message that the government will use its full powers to combat abortion clinic violence , a federal grand_jury indicted Paul J . Hill , accused killer of a doctor and his escort in Pensacola , Fla. , on federal charges of violating the new federal clinic access law . Hill , 40 , who has contended that killing abortion providers is justifiable homicide , already faces double premeditated murder_charges in Florida for the July 29 slayings and could be sentenced to death if he is convicted . If a jury finds him guilty under the Federal Access to Clinic Entrances law , Hill could be sentenced to life without possibility of parole . Citing a &quot; strong federal interest against violence , &quot; Deval Patrick , assistant U.S. attorney_general for civil_rights , said in announcing the indictment in Pensacola : &quot; The violence must end. &quot; Eleanor Smeal , president of the Feminist Majority Foundation , said that she was &quot; relieved &quot; by the U.S. action &quot; because at last there will be a major federal investigation into the murders and whether or not there was a conspiracy . It ' s extremely important that the federal_government take full responsibility for a nationwide investigation into anti-abortion terrorism. &quot; However , sources familiar_with the investigation of a special federal task_force into the possibility of a conspiracy in the Pensacola clinic murders said that no evidence has been developed to date that others were involved . Patrick declined comment on that aspect of the case , noting only that the investigation into the existence of a nationwide conspiracy &quot; is continuing. &quot; Hill was charged Friday with three counts of violating the federal clinic access law in the slayings of Dr. John B . Britton and his escort , James H . Barrett , and the wounding of Barrett ' s wife , June G . Barrett , outside the Ladies Center Clinic in Pensacola . He also was charged with using a firearm -- a 12-gauge shotgun -- in connection with a crime of violence . Usually the Justice_Department does not pursue federal civil_rights charges when there is parallel state action against a suspect and there is no doubt about the vigor and thoroughness of the local investigation . But Patrick noted : &quot; This indictment should serve notice that the newly enacted clinic access law is a powerful tool that will be used to combat violence aimed at reproductive health services. &quot; Patrick said Florida &quot; Gov . Lawton Chiles and state officials asked that a federal prosecution be brought against Hill in addition to the state murder_charges and we have done so . This demonstrates our mutual resolve to deter this kind of violence. &quot; The Justice_Department announcement brushed_aside any double-jeopardy concerns by citing &quot; the legal_principle that Hill ' s conduct was an offense against both the United States and the people of Florida. &quot; The charges against Hill are the second criminal case brought under the clinic access law , which President Clinton signed_on May 26 . In June , six persons in Milwaukee were charged with violating the act . That case is yet to be tried .</TEXT>
