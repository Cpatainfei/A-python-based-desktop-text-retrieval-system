   <HEADLINE> U.S. COLLAPSES AGAINST SWEDEN ; TENNIS : SAMPRAS DEFAULTS , MARTIN LOSES , SWEDES REACH DAVIS CUP_FINAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson thought he was dealing with tennis ' Dream Team II ; the first incarnation had won the title in 1992 . He discovered he was working with damaged goods , a team as heavily favored as it was heavily bandaged . In an unraveling the team ' s trainers and doctors could not stem , the United States blew a 2-0 lead and lost to Sweden , 3-2 . On Sunday , the world ' s No . 1 player , Pete Sampras , defaulted to Stefan Edberg after one set because of a hamstring injury and it was left to Todd Martin to beat a player ranked 27 places below him . He could not . Sweden , as it had here in 1984 , upset the United States and won the Davis Cup semifinal . Sweden will play_at Russia in the final Dec . 2-4 . It is only the third time in history that the U.S. team has lost after holding a 2-0 lead . The other losses came_in 1960 and 1939 . &quot; It was quite astonishing coming_back after being two matches down , &quot; Edberg said . &quot; It ' s incredible . I was quite skeptical on Friday , but anything can happen , and this shows it. &quot; The United States saw its 2-0 lead from Friday erode to 2-1 with Saturday ' s doubles loss . Its mandate on Sunday was to win one of the two singles matches . Disaster struck in the form of Sampras ' hamstring injury and Edberg , who won the first set , 6-3 , earned the point that evened the match . &quot; In retrospect , this week our guys have spent a lot more time in the trainer ' s room than the tennis_court , &quot; Gullikson said . The assignment of playing the decisive Davis Cup match seemed not to faze Martin , who had been devastating in beating Edberg on Friday . Despite his various physical troubles -- knee , groin , etc . -- Martin , by any logic , was expected to beat Magnus Larsson . Such is the caprice of Davis Cup , where the No . 34 player in the world can dismantle the world ' s No . 6 and make a mockery of the rankings , which pale in the face of flag and country . Larsson clinched it with only minor difficulty , 5-7 , 6-2 , 6-2 , 6-4 . While defaults happen with some frequency on the tour , they are not common in Davis Cup . There have been only six defaults by Americans since Davis Cup began in 1900 . Sunday ' s was the first default that has made a difference to the outcome . The most famous default involved Andre Agassi in the 1990 final against Australia . The United States had already clinched the title with a 3-0 lead going_into the last_day of singles . Agassi split sets with Darren Cahill , then announced he was injured . He was later heard to say he had faked the injury because he saw no reason to play a meaningless match . Michael Chang won the next match and the United States won the title , 4-1 . Chang , like Agassi and so many other of the top American players , chose not to play in the Davis Cup this year . Jim Courier had been a stalwart for the U.S. team all year , but he needed a break and was not available . &quot; On paper , we look_like we ' ve got a lot of depth , &quot; Gullikson said . &quot; But when players start filling their schedules , it gets pretty thin. &quot; Had other Americans been available , Sampras might not have felt compelled to play here with such a glaring lack of fitness . U.S. Davis Cup physician George Fareed said the hamstring strain might have occurred during Friday ' s four-set match against Larsson . Fareed said the muscle , which he said was slightly torn , might take a month to heal . Sampras was in good_spirits after the match , even though his hope was dashed of ending the season on a high note after disappointments . &quot; I can ' t lift my foot or bend the leg , &quot; he said , his foot propped_up on a couch . &quot; One thing after another . It feels_like it ' s kind of been an interesting year . A great_year but also very frustrating. &quot; Sampras ' stomach has been wrecked by anti-inflammatory medication and it can ' t tolerate the drugs usually prescribed for muscle strains . Nevertheless , he was given ibuprofen , a mild anti-inflammatory , during the fifth-game changeover . It was more to make the trainers feel useful than something that would offer immediate help to Sampras . His leg was bandaged a_few games later , but that only further restricted his movement . From the moment he walked on the court for warm-ups , it was clear that Sampras ' ability to move was severely compromised . He limped rather than walked at the baseline and getting_to the net consisted_of a series of hop-skips . Edberg knew that it would have been acceptable for him to hit for the lines and run Sampras around , but he would have none of it . Perhaps Edberg , who defaulted out of the final of the 1990 Australian Open because of a pulled stomach muscle , had some empathy for Sampras . &quot; It ' s not the way you like to win , &quot; Edberg said . &quot; I noticed in the first game that he wasn ' t going full speed on his first serve . After four or five games it was getting noticeable . He made_it difficult for me to play the last games . What should I do ? You could see that he was not moving . It was a matter of time , really. &quot; Having placed his teammate in a pressure-filled position , Sampras sat glumly in the stands and watched Martin being taken_apart by Larsson ' s pinpoint serving . The 24-year-old Swede had 16 aces and many_more service winners . The crowd of 4 # 256 at the Scandinavium arena came_to_life late in the match , sensing impending victory . Body_language told it all . Larsson walked briskly after points ; Martin dragged , with his head down . Asked if nerves had played a role in his loss , Martin shook his head . &quot; I was never nervous , &quot; Martin said . &quot; I just purely got outplayed. &quot; After the final point , Larsson leaped over the net and shook Martin ' s hand . The Swedish team went_into a mass hug and began to jump up and down while cheers rained_down . The Americans packed their rackets and liniment and gauze and limped off into the night .</TEXT>
