   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; THIS TIME AROUND , TURNER IS DISQUALIFIED ; SPEEDSKATING : AMERICAN CLAIMS THE DECISION IS RETALIATORY . U.S. MEN WIN THEIR FIRST SHORT-TRACK MEDAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The woman other short-track speedskaters would most love to beat if only they could , the United States ' Cathy Turner , received hate mail from a competitor , but that did not disturb her as much as the even harsher message sent to her Saturday night by International Skating Union judges . Turner , called &quot; the dirtiest skater in short track &quot; by a competitor , was disqualified in the semifinals of the 1 # 000 meters , an action she said was retaliation for the controversy she has been involved in since the opening_night of the Winter Olympic competition . For the two-time 500-meter champion , it was the first time in five races since short track became an Olympic sport in 1992 that she has not won a medal . U.S. men , however , won their first short-track medal Saturday night inside the Olympic Amphitheatre , finishing second to Italy in the 5 # 000-meter relay with a team that included Eric Flaim . The 1988 runner-up in long track ' s 1 # 500 meters , he became the first_person to win medals in both of speedskating ' s disciplines . Australia finished third for its first Winter Olympic medal ever . The silver medal gave the Americans 13 medals , their most ever in the Winter_Olympics . They won 12 in 1932 and 1980 , both on home ice and snow in Lake Placid , N.Y. Nevertheless , most of the attention again was focused_on the 31-year-old Turner , the former pop singer and Ice Capades headliner who dominates the sport both on an off the ice . When she won her 500-meter gold medal Thursday night , Chinese officials protested that she interfered in the final with second-place Zhang Yanmei , who was so upset that she refused to pose with Turner on the victory stand . When Turner read her electronic_mail in the athletes ' village the next day , there was a message from an anonymous Canadian that told her to go_to a place where the weather even in February is much warmer than Norway . Canadian officials later apologized to Turner . Two Canadian speedskaters complimented Turner Saturday night , saying that she skated one of her cleanest races in the semifinals and seemed puzzled that she was disqualified . So was Turner , who was called_for a minor brush that she had with Zhang and South_Korea ' s Kim So-Hee while passing them on a curve midway through the race . South_Korea ' s Chun Lee-Kyung won the gold medal with a world_record time in the final of 1:36.87. &quot; I feel strongly that the judges were just waiting for me , &quot; Turner said . &quot; I watched the videotape , and I couldn ' t believe it . I never did anything wrong tonight . &quot; I had a great Olympics , and this doesn ' t hurt me at all . But what they ' re doing here with all_of the controversy is really hurting the sport. &quot; International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch asked the ISU Friday for a report on the numerous protests and disqualifications . Samaranch was particularly concerned about Zhang ' s behavior on the victory stand and the perceived threat of violence against Turner by a competitor . Canadian Nathalie Lambert said Thursday that she hoped Turner would &quot; get what she deserves &quot; in Saturday night ' s race . Asked to elaborate , she said , &quot; Something bad. &quot; What Turner got was a disqualification .</TEXT>
