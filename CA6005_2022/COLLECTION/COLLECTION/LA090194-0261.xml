   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN TROOPS BID FAREWELL TO GERMANY , BALTICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They came as conquering heroes 49 years ago but left Wednesday ideologically vanquished , economically broken and even pitied by the people they had once defeated : In a day of brass_bands , goose-stepping and speeches , the occupying Red Army received its farewell salute from Germany and prepared to board the last trains home for Moscow . Russia also withdrew virtually all_of its troops from Latvia and Estonia on Wednesday , formally ending its massive , 50-year occupation of the Baltic_states . It completed its withdrawal from Lithuania exactly one year ago . In Berlin , fewer than 3 # 000 Russian troops were_on hand for the departure ceremonies out of the more_than 330 # 000 that occupied East_Germany at the Cold_War ' s height . The soldiers who remained marched in well-rehearsed drills and sang songs composed especially for the occasion , while Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin laid a wreath atop an imposing Berlin monument to the Soviet victory over German fascism . &quot; Historical truth demands . . . that we remember that for hundreds of millions of people , all_over the world , the hope of victory was linked to the Soviet army , &quot; said Yeltsin , who chose to concentrate_on the Russian role in defeating Adolf Hitler ' s Germany rather than dwelling on Josef Stalin ' s 1948-49 Berlin blockade or any other Cold_War unpleasantness . Yeltsin asserted that the Red Army ' s presence in Europe from the end of World_War_II until now had helped to keep the peace , although he acknowledged that &quot; after today ' s final reconciliation , our relations can take_on a new quality . . . . We are in a position to make our neighborly relations warmer and more human. &quot; German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who participated in the ceremonies with Yeltsin , spoke out against the Soviet blockade of Berlin but was otherwise cordial . He noted that much could be learned from both countries ' previous bad behavior and thanked the then-Soviet troops for letting the East_German Communist regime collapse peacefully in 1989 . &quot; When the ( Berlin ) Wall fell on Nov . 9 , 1989 , the Soviet leadership decided not to offer resistance , &quot; said Kohl . &quot; German unification would not have taken_place without Soviet cooperation . . . . We Germans will always remember this with gratitude. &quot; Small but surprisingly appreciative crowds of eastern and western Germans gathered as Yeltsin moved through the streets of central Berlin on Wednesday , laying wreaths on a number of World_War II-era Soviet monuments , hearing concerts and making speeches . Some Berliners waved red hammer-and-sickle flags as his entourage rolled by . One woman tossed him a bouquet of flowers , while other people cheered , &quot; Boris ! Boris ! &quot; Still other Yeltsin-seekers pleaded with police to get a better look_at him , complaining , &quot; He ' ll never be back again ! &quot; &quot; I think the Russians might have stayed &quot; in Germany , suggested Arnold Hackel , 54 , a teacher from what used to be East Berlin . &quot; They never did us any harm. &quot; Asked about the Soviets ' use of tanks to put_down an uprising in East Berlin in 1953 , and again to support the building of the Berlin Wall_in 1961 , Hackel said , &quot; Oh , one is always wiser afterward . It was not their fault . Hitler started the war . that ' s why they came here . And I say this even though my family suffered. &quot; His friend Joachim Benedix , 34 , also a teacher , added : &quot; I saw the Soviets , always , more or less as soldiers doing their service , and I felt sorry_for them . They were locked_up and disciplined all_the time . I remember that once I went_to ( their headquarters ) with a class . They served us pea_soup , and we , as guests , got the biggest pieces of meat . And we knew that they didn ' t get meat very often . I didn ' t consider them an occupying force. &quot; But the sympathy and even tolerance on the part of ordinary Germans for their impoverished Russian &quot; friends &quot; did not reflect official German attitudes . German officials had argued earlier this summer that the Red Army was an unwanted occupier of East_Germany , in contrast with the three Western Allies , whom they called a positive force in the former West . On that basis , Germany rejected Russian requests that the four World_War_II Allies hold their departure festivities together . The Germans even went so far as_to propose that the Russians hold their departure parades in Weimar , a small city that the Red Army did not even capture in 1945 . Although the Russians were successful in blocking that idea , they were not allowed to join the Western Allied farewell ceremonies , set for next week in Berlin . Even less festive was Wednesday ' s departure of the Red Army from the Baltic_states . The Soviet army occupied Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania in 1940 under a then-secret 1939 pact with Nazi Germany . Hitler invaded the three Baltic_states in 1941 , ending the pact . With the German retreat in 1944 , the Soviet army returned ; thousands in the Baltics were packed off to camps in Russia -- mostly Siberia -- as they had been during the first Soviet takeover . Because the Baltic people never saw Russians as liberators and because negotiations for the Red Army withdrawals were long and acrimonious , no ceremonies were held_in Estonia or Latvia . The Baltic talks were complicated by differences over the rights of thousands of Russians , particularly retired military_officers , who have settled there . Both countries eventually agreed to let them stay . Estonia ' s government first planned a reception to mark the Russian withdrawal but canceled it . Officials in Riga , the Latvian capital , vetoed plans for a garden_party downtown . Nationalists in both countries have argued that , with small numbers of Russians staying_on , the occupation is not really over . &quot; Fifty years ago , it was Hitler and Stalin . Now , it is the West and Boris Yeltsin who are cutting deals over other people ' s destinies , &quot; warned an editorial in The Baltic Independent newspaper . In the end , churches in the Baltic countries tolled their bells in memory of those who suffered and died under Soviet occupation and the presidents issued a statement calling it &quot; a momentous day for our three countries. &quot; &quot; With the final withdrawal of Russian forces . . . our peoples have again become genuine masters of_their_own fate , &quot; they said . &quot; Russia now moves closer to the accepted norms of international behavior. &quot; Estonian President Lennart Meri , who vowed three years ago not to consume champagne as long as Russian troops occupied his nation ' s soil , drank a farewell glass at a reception Wednesday , just after speaking at a solemn observance at a World_War_II memorial in Tallinn . &quot; Today signifies the end of the saddest chapter in our history , &quot; he said . &quot; But it is also true that today a new chapter is opened for an Estonia liberated from foreign troops , which we must all write together. &quot; In Latvia , meanwhile , the last few Russian soldiers left Riga Wednesday morning in two passenger_cars of a freight_train laden with jeeps , trucks , armored personnel_carriers , civilian cars and whatever they could strip from their base . Some brought wives , children , dogs and cats . Others had bid long , tearful goodbys to girlfriends in the shadows of boxcars the night before . Andrei Y . Nekrasov , 31 , a contract private , left alone . He said his German wife , whom he had met in Latvia , left him three months ago , taking their 18-month-old son to Germany . There was no place for his family to live_in Russia , he explained , and he would never have found work in Germany . &quot; Our army is marching_out of Germany with honor . Here , they are kicking us out , &quot; he said bitterly , standing on a flatcar . &quot; The Russians got_along well with people here . It was the politicians , the people at the top , who decided our fate. &quot; After the train left , the last Russian officers departed on three military planes from Riga . On the way to the airport , the two top Russian commanders called_on Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis to inform him that the occupation was over . &quot; These people are leaving without hate , &quot; Ulmanis told reporters later . He added with a wry smile : &quot; If they return , they will be welcomed as visitors and as tourists. &quot; Walsh reported from Berlin and Boudreaux from Riga . Petra Falkenberg and Andreas Scharpf of The Times ' Berlin Bureau and Times special correspondent Matt Bivens in Tallinn , Estonia , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
