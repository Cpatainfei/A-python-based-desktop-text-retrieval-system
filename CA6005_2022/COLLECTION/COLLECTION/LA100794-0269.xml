   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : LAGUNA NIGUEL ; HOMEOWNERS RESIST WATER_PLANT EXPANSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Moulton Niguel Water District ' s plan to expand a water treatment plant here has received a clear &quot; thumbs down &quot; from neighboring homeowners . Residents near the plant at La Paz and Kings roads say they want the district to eliminate the plant ' s nasty odor before embarking_on the $ 7.5-million project in May . &quot; This is a state-of-the-art facility that stinks to high heaven , &quot; Crown Royale Homeowners Assn . secretary James Brown said . He said property values around the plant are declining because of the plant ' s stench . But the district said the expansion plan will not increase odors from the plant . The district wants to equip the plant to reclaim more waste water for irrigation , said Larry Dees , who is heading the project for the water district . The state requires that water districts recycle water . That step_in the treatment process doesn ' t cause odors , Dees said . The Laguna Niguel plant treats 12 million gallons of commercial and residential waste water a day , with 9.6 million gallons being treated twice , making_it clean enough to be released into the ocean , he said . The rest is cleaned three times , which makes_it suitable for irrigation . After the expansion , 11.4 million gallons of the water treated there will be cleaned three times , Dees said . The expansion , which includes bringing_in a new tank and new filters , is expected to take more_than a year . Dees said the plant ' s occasional foul odor comes from the pond in front of the treatment plant , where the water that has been treated twice is stored for a short time before being washed_out to the sea . Brown said the plant ' s odor has increased in recent years , making life unpleasant for nearby residents . LYNN FRANEY</TEXT>
