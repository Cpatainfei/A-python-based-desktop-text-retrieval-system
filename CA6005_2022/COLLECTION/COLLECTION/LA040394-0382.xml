   <HEADLINE> YOUR MORTGAGE ; CONTROVERSIAL PROGRAMS AVOID FORECLOSURE , TAX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A top home mortgage industry executive calls it &quot; pushing the envelope of the law &quot; and vows to fight it nationwide if necessary . Officials at the Internal Revenue Service say they ' ve recently become aware of it and are studying its possible tax implications for participating homeowners . What they ' re talking_about is 1994 ' s latest , creative wrinkle in mortgage credit : Companies that offer financially distressed homeowners a way to avoid foreclosure , negative marks on their credit_bureau files and -- most significantly -- large tax_liabilities to Uncle_Sam . Lenders say such enterprises have been encouraged by a 1993 federal tax code change that requires lenders to report &quot; debt relief &quot; they extend_to borrowers in excess of $ 600 . Here ' s how the concept works . Say you bought your home at the top of the market cycle several years ago , and you know its sale value today is less than the mortgage balance . To compound matters , your spouse ' s employer closed last year , cutting your family income by 40 % . You ' ve been missing mortgage payments and you ' re staring at the grim_reaper of foreclosure two or three months down the road . What to do ? There are several options , but the one that ' s bothering lenders involves deeding your property over to a third_party . The &quot; purchaser &quot; makes no payment to you , but agrees to become the owner of legal record on the property . A firm active in this field is Boston Harbor Corp. , based in San Diego . For an upfront fee equal_to 1 % of your original mortgage principal balance , the firm steps into your shoes and immediately contacts the lender . The first thing Boston Harbor says to the lender , according to its general counsel , Eric F . Fagan , is that &quot; there will be no further payments &quot; on the loan . Instead , the firm will provide a service free_of charge : It will sell the property quickly at the best price it can get -- often less than the loan amount -- and turn the net proceeds over to the lender . &quot; The advantage ( to mortgage lenders ) , &quot; according to Fagan , &quot; is that they avoid all_the expense and time of a foreclosure &quot; as well as the possibility of having to hold the property in portfolio for months or years as REO -- real_estate owned . The attractions to the erstwhile homeowners ? Several , in Fagan ' s view . First , they get_out of the financial jam they were in . Second , they avoid the Scarlet_Letter on their credit report that would haunt them for years following a foreclosure . Even if their lender ultimately did take_back the house , the party foreclosed upon -- the legal owner of the property -- would be Boston Harbor , not the original homeowner . Finally , if the sale of the property yielded less than the mortgage balance , the homeowners would avoid the sticky tax trap known as &quot; debt relief. &quot; Under the federal tax code , any relief of indebtedness on behalf of a borrower constitutes taxable income to the borrower . For example , say the foreclosure sale of your home , with your name on the property deed , yielded $ 125 # 000 but you owed $ 150 # 000 to the bank . If the bank licked its wounds and walked away , your debt relief on the transaction would be $ 25 # 000 . In the 31 % marginal tax_bracket , that could mean you owe $ 7 # 750 in additional federal taxes . And under a provision of the 1993 tax law , the bank is now required to report your $ 25 # 000 in debt relief to you -- and to the IRS -- on tax_form 1099 . The law mandates such reporting for all debt forgiveness over $ 600 . If Boston Harbor ' s name was_on the deed , however , argues Fagan , the debt relief would go_to Boston Harbor . As a corporation that buys and sells houses , it would be able to offset the $ 25 # 000 &quot; income &quot; ( debt relief ) against the $ 25 # 000 paper &quot; loss &quot; it recorded on the sale . Fagan ' s program defines the price it pays_for a house as the outstanding mortgage balance at the time of acquisition . The homeowners ' tax position after all this ? According to Fagan , presto : They ' re out of the loop . They owe neither Uncle_Sam nor their former lender a cent . Boston Harbor , meanwhile , has pocketed 1 % of the original loan balance in cash . that ' s $ 1 # 500 on a $ 150 # 000 mortgage , $ 3 # 000 on a $ 300 # 000 mortgage . Fagan says business is booming . By his count , the firm has initiated or completed over 100 transactions in the past six months alone . But that doesn ' t necessarily sit well with lenders . Richard D . Bryan , an executive_vice_president at Freddie Mac , the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. , says the firm is encountering more of these transactions and vigorously opposes the concept . By encouraging homeowners to walk away from their financial_obligations and promising tax and credit-file benefits , said Bryan , such firms are &quot; pushing the envelope of the law. &quot; Freddie Mac , for its part , will send 1099s and report foreclosures in the original borrowers ' names , Bryan warned . The IRS , in the meantime , says it is &quot; looking_at &quot; the whole subject of mortgage debt relief . Asked if he had contacted the IRS for an opinion to safeguard his homeowner clients , Fagan confirmed that he had not . His own tax attorney cleared the plan , according to Fagan . The upshot on mortgage debt relief programs for consumers : Be aware that they ' re controversial at the least . Get solid legal and tax advice before plunging ahead . * Distributed by the Washington Post Writers Group .</TEXT>
