   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; SOCCER / GRAHAME L . JONES ; GARCIA AT CENTER STAGE WHEN IT COUNTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The inscription on the back of the Mexican fans ' shirts said it all : &quot; Confia en Mexico. &quot; Rely on Mexico . The fans were confident that Mexico would not let them down a second time . The 1-0 loss to Norway in the first game was but a memory , a defeat that could be blamed on World Cup nerves , perhaps , or even bad_luck . After all , Mexico had held the more powerful Norwegians in check until the final minutes before yielding a goal . Even then , Coach Miguel Mejia Baron ' s team had fought_back and almost gained a tie . Ireland would be an equally difficult opponent , but the fans were sure that victory could be theirs . Over in the_Irish camp , the feeling was that , having beaten Italy , the favorite to win the group title , Mexico could also be defeated , or at least tied . That would give Ireland four points and virtually assure passage to the next round . Yes , the heat and humidity would be a factor , but surely it could be no worse at the Florida Citrus Bowl than it had been at Giants Stadium in New Jersey . Ireland approached the game , therefore , in an equally confident manner . Mexico made a_couple_of surprise changes in its lineup , relegating forward Hugo Sanchez and defender Ramon Ramirez to the bench and bringing_in Carlos Hermosillo as the central striker , flanked by Luis Roberto Alves on the left and Luis Garcia on the right . Garcia had seemed out_of_place playing wide against Norway , his usual position or role being central striker . The same thing was true Friday , but Garcia solved the problem by abandoning his role on the right and drifting more and more toward the center of the field . The result was two goals by the Atletico Madrid star and a 2-1 victory for Mexico , which meant there was no way Baron could blame Garcia afterward . Both Mexican goals resulted from short passes in or near the penalty area to a wide-open Garcia , who had managed to elude the_Irish defense simply by not being where he was supposed to be . Rather than criticize Baron for playing him on the right , Garcia was diplomatic when asked about it . &quot; I did like my new position , &quot; he said . &quot; I felt good about it. &quot; Not feeling so good was Ireland ' s coach , Jack Charlton , whose behavior at the postgame news_conference was matched only by the foul language he and his players were guilty of on the bench . Soccer is not for choirboys , true , but there are limits . &quot; You write what you like , &quot; Charlton fumed at reporters . &quot; You always do anyway. &quot; Why did Ireland lose ? The answer is simple : It was beaten by a better team ; a team that could pace itself to last 90 minutes without wilting in the closing stages ; a team that let the ball do the work , making the pass a more effective weapon than the run ; a team that had some creative ideas and put them to use . Ignacio Ambriz played a captain ' s role for Mexico , setting the example on both offense and defense , while Hermosillo and especially Alberto Garcia Aspe were constant thorns in the side of the_Irish . Ireland played with heart and deserved the late goal that John Aldridge scored on a crossing pass from his fellow substitute , Jason McAteer . They might even have got the tying goal had Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos , wearing his usual circus outfit , not been there to save Andy Townsend ' s wickedly curving shot . But the result was a fair one and it leaves the group wide open . Each of the four teams has three points from two games . Tuesday will be decision day when Ireland and Norway meet at Giants Stadium in a game that has 0-0 written all_over it , while Italy and Mexico play in Washington . Complicating matters for the_Irish , however , is that defenders Terry Phelan and Denis Irwin both received their second yellow cards of the tournament , meaning they will have to sit_out Tuesday ' s game . The Mexicans had a mathematical edge until Aldridge ' s goal left the teams deadlocked at the top of the standings -- in goals scored . Similarly , the Italians and Norwegians are tied just behind them . Which teams go_through and which go_home seemingly will not be determined until the final kick . If it ' s Luis Garcia who takes it , put your money on Mexico . ATHLETICS</TEXT>
