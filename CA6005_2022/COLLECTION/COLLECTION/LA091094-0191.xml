   <HEADLINE> SMOG AGENCY BOWS TO L.A. , DEFERS SOME STRICTER LIMITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Setting a new course for clearing the nation ' s dirtiest skies , Southland air quality officials on Friday unanimously adopted a plan that aims to clean_up ozone , the main ingredient of smog , by 2010 but does not commit them to controversial measures regulating heavily polluting trucks , trains and other diesel equipment . As a concession to the city of Los Angeles , the South Coast Air Quality Management District board decided to defer many proposals that target nitrogen_oxides , including a series of pollution limits that would force many diesel_engines to use futuristic technologies such_as fuel_cells , natural_gas or other clean-burning alternatives . The city had said not only that such stringent measures were unrealistic but also that they would be economically devastating . Although they remain in the district ' s own plan , the measures will be removed from the version submitted to the federal_government . In doing that , the AQMD and the state will not be committed to implementing them if they find a better answer . They can take until 1997 to find alternative ways to achieve health standards for particulates , the soot-like air pollutants that can cause lung disease . Even without the nitrogen_oxides regulations , the AQMD says its plan contains enough aggressive anti-smog steps -- an array of almost 100 proposed measures -- to meet the federal health standard for ozone , the lung-scarring gas that is the Southland ' s worst pollutant . One important new approach , officials say , is a pollution trading program requiring about 1 # 100 aerospace plants , metal-plating shops and other industrial facilities to cut their hydrocarbon emissions 70 % by 2010 . As a financial incentive , the companies would be allowed to buy and sell pollution credits under a system similar to a smaller program the AQMD launched this year . But even with such new smog-fighting programs , curbing ozone will be a huge challenge because pollution from vehicles , industry and other sources must be cut by two-thirds in 16 years even as the region ' s population is expected to grow by 4 million . The compromise over particulates is a major victory for Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan , who days before a scheduled AQMD vote last month raised strong objections and sparked controversy when he came_up with his own eleventh-hour alternative . AQMD executive_officer James Lents called the uproar over accommodating the mayor &quot; a tempest in a teapot &quot; that eclipsed what air quality officials believe are more critical portions of the plan . On Friday , Los Angeles Vice Mayor Michael Keeley called the AQMD ' s compromise a &quot; constructive alternative &quot; that &quot; addresses all pollutants while maintaining flexibility and local control , which the mayor considers crucial. &quot; After five months of acrimonious debate and attempts at building consensus , Southland business_leaders say the plan approved Friday -- which will cost at least $ 5 billion a year -- still contains many economic pitfalls and could prevent recovery from the recession . &quot; We think that Mayor Riordan ' s plan will ease the pain , &quot; said Ron Lamb , a vice_president with the Los Angeles Area Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; It goes_a_long_way to resolve some of the things we ' re concerned about . But still , considering how our businesses are suffering , we have to be careful in how we implement it. &quot; Some environmentalists , however , view it as a weak plan that accommodates polluters and may never bring_about clean air . They say the board sent a strong message to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , which regulates trains , interstate trucks and ships , that aggressive diesel measures are not needed . In fact , about 50 members of a community and labor rights group based in Wilmington lambasted the board Friday in a vehement and emotional protest , chanting , &quot; You ' re killing our children ! &quot; &quot; You have turned this into a farce , &quot; said group leader Chris Mathis . &quot; No agency at all is better than what we have now . . . . To industry , congratulations , you all win. &quot; The AQMD plan , covering Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside and San Bernardino counties , is the third update of the region ' s clean-air strategy in five years . By law , the agency is required to come_up with an update every three years . Now the plan goes_to the state Air Resources Board for approval , which could come next month . At that time , the ARB will add statewide measures , including future goals for electric and other low-emission passenger_cars and other motor_vehicles . Under the federal Clean Air Act , the ARB has until Nov . 15 to submit a final plan to the EPA . Although the AQMD staff had originally proposed reducing nitrogen oxides 79 % by 2010 , the plan to be submitted to the EPA would reduce it by 50 % -- a difference of about 270 tons of pollutants per day . Nitrogen_oxides contribute to the Los Angeles Basin ' s ozone pollution as well as_to its famous brown haze and its particulates . The proposals not included in the version now going_to the EPA would have set stringent pollution standards that would have required most locomotives to stop using diesel_fuel by 2000 and many heavy-duty trucks and construction equipment to switch after 2010 . Retrofitting aircraft_engines to cleaner-burning technologies would have been required after 1998 . The trucking and airline industries were harshly critical of those rules , saying that no workable technology exists . They contended that they would be forced to reduce hauling of goods and eliminate flights in and out of the region . But the AQMD staff said setting stringent anti-smog targets would help trigger development of technology , just as earlier regulations produced catalytic_converters on cars and cleaner power_plants . Jack Broadbent , AQMD planning director , said , &quot; We are still very much committed to implementing these rules &quot; because they remain in the district ' s version of the plan . Also eliminated in the update were proposed fees on diesel-powered ships entering Los Angeles and Long_Beach harbor , which had been vigorously opposed by Riordan and the business_community . Instead , the AQMD will urge the federal_government to allow ships to switch to lanes farther out_to sea so that less pollution from their engines reaches the shore . Because it does not reduce nitrogen_oxides enough , the compromise plan would fail to achieve federal health standards for particulates . To meet federal deadlines , the AQMD must come_up with additional options by February , 1997 . One suggestion from Riordan ' s office is to find ways of controlling natural dust particles , which blow from farms , unpaved roads and lots , particularly in San Bernardino County . That suggestion , however , has prompted complaints from many Inland Empire officials that Los Angeles is trying to shift the burden of controlling particulates to them . They point_out that motor_vehicles in urban_areas are by far the largest source of particulates . The AQMD will convene two conferences of experts to try to devise other ways to reduce particulates , although no dates have been set . &quot; We believe our measures are cutting-edge . The question is , have we missed something ? &quot; said Barry Wallerstein , AQMD deputy executive_officer . Even though they got a reprieve , diesel_engines still will be part of the plan submitted to EPA . It calls_for standards , dubbed &quot; clean diesel , &quot; that require that engines emit less pollution by 2000 . Los Angeles and the state also are urging the federal_government to set national standards for trucks , trains and other heavy-duty vehicles , which would mean Los Angeles and other major urban hubs would remain competitive . The EPA says it is seriously considering the idea . Facing a court_order after losing a suit by environmentalists , the EPA is preparing a backup clean-air plan for the Southland and Sacramento by February , and its proposals may be even more stringent than the AQMD ' s . Dave Titus , a spokesman for the California Trucking Assn. , said Friday that the changes in the AQMD plan are a positive sign , but that truckers still face the prospect of economically devastating measures proposed by the EPA . In debating the updated plan Friday , the AQMD board virtually ignored a new tax proposal from a panel of 70 city and county elected officials at the Southern California Assn . of Governments . The group recommended that the AQMD incorporate in its plan a tax on motorists of 3 to 5 cents per mile -- equivalent_to about $ 1 per gallon of gasoline -- to replace current gasoline_taxes of about 2.5 cents per mile . The money would fund mass transit and other advanced transportation improvements . The AQMD board created a task_force to study the idea , but Chairman Henry Wedaa said such a tax is unrealistic and would require approval of the state Legislature . Clearing the Air The South Coast Air Quality Management District 20-year clean air plan contains about 100 measures targeting vehicles , industries , consumer products and other sources of pollution . Here is a look_at the plan : * History : This is the third plan created by the AQMD in the past five years . The four-county Southland region , which has the nation ' s most polluted air , is required under federal law to achieve all health standards by 2010 . Every three years , the AQMD must update its plan for meeting those mandates . * Programs : The plan includes a pollution-trading provision for 1 # 100 companies , such_as aerospace firms , that emit hydrocarbons ; controls on petroleum facilities such_as tanks and fuel supplies for pleasure_boats ; controls on dust from farms , paved and unpaved roads and construction activity ; smog checks for light-duty diesel vehicles and cleaner-running diesel trucks and buses ; advanced shuttle transit and electronically controlled freeways ; building infrastructure for electric_cars and alternative fuel cars . * Schedule : Some of the measures could be adopted and implemented as soon as next year , while others requiring advanced technology would not go_into effect until 2010 . * Costs : Business_leaders say the revisions will cost at least $ 5 million a year . * Enforcement : The measures would be implemented by the AQMD , the state Air Resources Board , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and local_governments . * Next step : The plan goes_to the state Air Resources Board for approval . Deadline for submitting it to the EPA is Nov . 15 .</TEXT>
