   <HEADLINE> WORK AROUND JAPAN ' S REVOLVING PRIME-MINISTER DOOR ; POLICY : THE U.S. SHOULD FORM A COHESIVE STAND AND STICK TO IT , RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIGURE_OUT EACH NEW GOVERNMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ultra right-wing campaign truck passes my home here : Rising Sun flags fluttering from the roof , &quot; For an Independent Constitution &quot; painted across its doors . Loudspeakers blare_out support for just-resigned Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano ' s provocative May 3 assertion that Japan ' s invasion of Asia was a war of liberation , not aggression , and the Nanjing massacre &quot; a fabrication. &quot; This dissent from apologies to Asia from former Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Emperor Akihito was ideological par for the new government of Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata and his backstage fixer Ichiro Ozawa , arguably the most nationalistic , right-leaning cabinet since World_War_II . Too many Americans , grasping for straws of hope , see Ozawa as the &quot; can do &quot; man who will put the politicians in_charge of a recalcitrant bureaucracy and lead Japan to greater democracy , deregulation , open markets and &quot; internationalization. &quot; This is a serious misperception , compounded by the Clinton_Administration ' s decision to go easy on trade lest the new government ( for which most Japanese see a life span of one to two months ) collapse . The tumult at Japan ' s prime_minister level strikes some foreign observers as a Gilbert_and_Sullivan farce , inexplicable for a nation normally so purposeful and &quot; together. &quot; It is neither . Japan ' s long-term direction in the postwar period has always been laid_down by the political arm , then left ( too broadly , to be sure ) to the permanent bureaucracy for implementation . After nearly a half-century of stability , political structures and ideologies are in long-delayed flux . In the 1950s , Prime_Minister Shigeru Yoshida placed Japan firmly on the track of a low military profile , close ties with the United States , acceptance of the new democratic constitution and concentration on the economic miracle those commitments made_possible . Although the right_wing of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party would have preferred to turn the clock back , the mainstream conservatives have adhered to that formula , with the large socialist opposition also blocking any return to political and military chauvinism . With the LDP finally out of power after too many money-tainted scandals , that old political configuration collapsed . Meanwhile , with no Cold_War rationale for following the U.S. lead , foreign complaints about unfettered trade expansion and the lure of a prospering Asia , Japan now seeks a new definition of purpose . To many Japanese , Hata ' s &quot; reformist &quot; New Life Party and its prime_mover , Ozawa , look too_much like the old politics of veiled intentions , Byzantine coups and rough riding over democratic process . Voters were upset by Ozawa ' s sudden and secretive launching of a new parliamentary group excluding the coalition ' s largest partner , the Social Democratic Party . Having made painful policy concessions to get Hata elected , the Socialists withdrew , leaving Hata with a minority cabinet . The rump alliance now combines the political nationalism of Hata ' s Shinseito ( dominated by former LDP right-wingers like Nagano ) and the religious nationalism of the Buddhist-affiliated Komeito ( Clean Government Party ) . Ozawa ' s strategy is to lure additional LDP hawks to his fold , decimate the Socialist and smaller opposition parties through the &quot; reformed &quot; single-seat election_district system and create two sibling conservative_parties on the prewar model . The strategy ' s basic goals include an expanded military role , a revision of the postwar constitution ( shamefully &quot; imposed &quot; by the United States ) and a more aggressive leadership of Asia . There has been talk_of rallying a more liberal-minded and less chauvinistic alternative alliance of the LDP left ( cleansed of tainted money ) and Socialist Democrats ' right ( purged of Marxist hard-liners ) . A tall_order -- but a truer two-party system than Ozawa ' s , and one that could hold Japan to its postwar democratic heritage . In their eagerness to see Japan ' s bureaucrats humbled , Americans should also mind who does the humbling . Actually , differences on trade issues between bureaucrats , politicians and the public are not nearly as wide as some Americans would hope . Japanese people still think_of themselves more as job-holders , producers and loyal company workers than as individual consumers , and are grateful for protection , whatever leadership may supply it . The United States should simply develop a visibly coordinated , persuasively argued and consistently applied Japan policy and stick_with it . Nothing would better concentrate the mind of this , or any other new Japanese administration . If we don ' t , America may have invented Tokyo ' s best gambit yet for fending off market-opening pressures : just keep changing prime_ministers . A punishment fitting the crime .</TEXT>
