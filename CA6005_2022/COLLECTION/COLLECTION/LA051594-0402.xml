   <HEADLINE> TRAVELER ' S JOURNAL : ISTANBUL ; TURKISH BATHOS ; SHE WANTED TO FIND_OUT WHAT THE CELEBRATED TURKISH_BATH EXPERIENCE WAS REALLY LIKE . HERE ' S THE NAKED TRUTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> My wealthy Istanbul friend was appalled . &quot; You ' re not , &quot; she demanded , eyebrows hoisting to her hairline , &quot; really going_to a Turkish_bath a la Turque ? &quot; I admitted that this was my intention . My friend grimly hinted at dire consequences ( &quot; Would it be clean ? &quot; she asked ) , while strongly urging me to go instead to the hamam ( Turkish_bath ) at the fitness center at the Swissotel , to which she was driven once a week by her chauffeur . But I couldn ' t see the pristine Swissotel , glassily luxurious on its hill in the smart district of Besiktas , providing anything like the ambience for which I was looking . In fact I wasn ' t exactly sure what to expect of a typical Turkish hamam , and in an effort to find_out , I had read everything I could lay my hands on that described the experiences of others , some of them more_than a little distinguished . But their impressions were bewilderingly different . For instance , Mark Twain , visiting Istanbul in 1869 , had no words bad enough to describe his experience . &quot; The celebrated Turkish_bath , &quot; he fulminated in &quot; Innocents Abroad , &quot; &quot; is a malignant swindle . The man who enjoys it is qualified to enjoy anything that is repulsive to sight or sense . It is tedious , and wretched , and dismal , and nasty. &quot; And of the hamam he visited , he wrote , &quot; The place was vast , naked , dreary ; its courts a barn , its galleries stalls for human horses. &quot; He complained that , after he had undressed , &quot; an unclean starveling , &quot; ( his masseur ) , &quot; wrapped a gaudy tablecloth about his loins , and hung a white rag over my shoulders , &quot; and of having to rest_on &quot; rusty old mattresses , indented with impressions left by the forms of nine successive generations of men who had reposed_on them. &quot; All distinctly discouraging . However , I fortunately then read the letters of a distinguished Englishwoman , remarkable for her courage , intelligence and insatiable curiosity . Lady Mary Wortley Montagu , wife of the_British ambassador to the &quot; Sublime Porte of Turkey , &quot; in 1717 , and perhaps the nearest thing to a female investigative reporter the 18th Century produced , saw it all very differently . When visiting Sophia , which was at that time within the Turkish Empire and famous for its hot baths , she took herself off to the hamam at 10 o ' clock one morning , by which time it was already filled with about 200 women . She declared herself &quot; charmed by their civility and beauty &quot; and described the scene with keen interest . &quot; ' Tis the women ' s coffeehouse , where all_the news of the town is told , scandal invented etc . They generally take this diversion once a week and stay there at least four or five hours. &quot; The hamam consisted_of five rooms , some warm , some very hot and sulfurous , and two with hot baths . One very large room , paved with marble and containing four cool fountains , had two sofas of marble , one above another , running_around the perimeter . &quot; The first sofas were covered with cushions and rich carpets , on which sat the ladies , and on the second their slaves behind ' em , but without any distinction of rank by their dress , all being in a state_of_nature , that is in plain English , stark naked. &quot; Lady Mary wrote that she would &quot; have been very glad to pass more time with them . . . . &quot; In light of such conflicting evidence , my curiosity was piqued . And so on a cool damp day last fall , which was less than ideal for sightseeing , I took myself off to the 300-year-old Turkish_baths in Cagaloglu , in the old part of the city , not far from the great museum-church of St . Sophia . The leaflet put_out by the baths described it glowingly . &quot; This magnificent monument was used only by the Sultans , important people of the palace and high class of society &quot; ( and to think the Swissotel was open_to just anybody ! ) . It listed among past visitors King Edward_VII , Kaiser Wilhelm , Franz Liszt , Florence_Nightingale , one of the Rockefellers , Tony Curtis and Rudolf Nureyev . How could I go_wrong ? It was described , rather vaguely , as having been built , &quot; it is said &quot; in the early 18th Century , one of the works &quot; it is said &quot; of Sinan ( whose superb vessels of holy space , the Suleymaniye and Edirne mosques , made him the greatest architect in the history of Turkey ) . Sinan might have been surprised at the attribution , particularly as he died in 1588 . The exterior was less than distinguished , and I entered by a door that said &quot; Women Only. &quot; I was rather relieved . No Rudys or Rockies allowed_in this section . Through a narrow entryway I stepped into a large dark room with a high domed ceiling , where five women in smocks lounged on seats in the center , watching television . Small cubicles with bunk-like beds_covered in striped fabric opened off the central area , and a second tier of these opened off a balcony , above . Each cubicle door had a glass window with designs to obscure vision in the lower part ( &quot; latticed chicken_coops &quot; Twain had described them , &quot; more suggestive_of the county hospital than anything else. &quot; ) One of the cotton-wrapped women detached herself from the television to attend_to me and silently held_out a card on which were listed the different treatments available , with their prices . It wasn ' t particularly cheap , but I told myself that I was paying_for the privilege of bathing where the_likes_of Rudy , Rocky and Florence_Nightingale had bathed before . Yikan , meaning &quot; wash oneself &quot; -- a novel privilege denied most of us -- cost about $ 3.60 , and soap was included ; &quot; Keselenmek , &quot; translated as &quot; body rub with a hair glove , &quot; cost about $ 5 ; Yikama ve Masaj &quot; combined a self-wash and massage for $ 6 ; or for $ 7.25 , one could have a hair glove rub and massage . Throwing caution to the winds I decided on all-out , self-indulgence and opted for the &quot; Luks osmanli servisi , &quot; the Luxury Ottoman service , for about $ 10.75 , with both soap and shampoo included . ( Ooh the depravity of it ! ) * I paid my money , and another smocked woman heaved herself to her feet , selected a large pink towel from a pile , indicated a cubicle and told me to take_off my shoes and put_on the blue rubber sandals at the door . She also indicated , by pantomime , that I should take everything off . I did as I was told . Then , clad only in sandals and clutching my pink towel about me , I followed her as she opened a great arched wooden door on heavy black hinges , led the way through a warm , high-domed , gray marble room and opened an identical door on the far side . A gust of hot_air hit me as we went_in . This room was much like the first but much hotter , very large , with a huge , high dome , pierced by glass-filled stars and hexagons and circles , supported by 15 marble columns . Filling the center of the floor under the dome was a huge , knee-level , 10-sided marble platform , which I recognized as the gobek tasi ( or center stone ) , on which the massage took_place . Just as in Lady Mary ' s description , a wide , foot-high platform ran_around the sides of the room . Rising from it was a low bench that ran between each of the basins against the walls . Set at intervals corresponding to the 15 columns , were marble basins with brass taps . Water overflowing from these basins would spill from the side platforms onto the floor around the gobek tasi and flow in rivulets to a dark square hole visible under the step of the door through which we ' d entered . It all seemed very familiar from reading Lady Mary , except for one very major difference : Rather than being , as she was , in the company of 200 other women , I was the only person there . The attendant turned_on the taps and removed my pink towel . For a second I felt_like a limpet that has lost its protective shell -- a self-conscious yellow-pink blob . She handed me a pewter bowl and made water-pouring gestures over her head by way of encouragement . &quot; Just water , &quot; she said , and paddled off , leaving me sitting , as Lady Mary would have it , &quot; in a state_of_nature , &quot; on the marble bench . . . alone in the large , hot room . I sat there a long_time , simply pouring very hot water over my head and body . It was such a simple exercise , yet I found myself overtaken by a strange and wonderful sense of freedom . It was blissful . I began to feel_like a warm , hedonistic cat , northern inhibitions rinsing away along with superficial dirt . The sensuous feelings briefly evaporated as the attendant trudged back in bearing a sign that listed Turkish tea or coffee or apple tea . The apple tea was brought_in a little glass -- delicious , sweet and piping hot . Mark Twain , I recollected , had been brought Turkish_coffee . &quot; Of all_the unchristian beverages that ever passed my lips , &quot; quoth he , &quot; Turkish_coffee is the worst. &quot; He said it , not I . After some time a bizarre creature entered the room : a vast pear-shaped woman , with great pear-shaped breasts and black briefs , her hair tied_up in a scarf and gold earrings dangling from her ears . She had a strange , strong-jawed , small-eyed face . I wondered if she were another customer , perhaps a regular , as she seemed very much at_home . I politely averted my eyes as she drew_near but she , on the contrary , had no such qualms and I knew that she was staring at me boldly as she shuffled past . She then busied herself at a nearby basin with her back to me , running the taps and noisily splashing washcloths in the water . I concluded that she must be my masseuse . No starveling , she . * Big Pear was preoccupied in this fashion when I suddenly noticed , running toward me from the direction of the door , a small dark animal scuttling around the marble floor surrounding the gobek tasi . Then a second ran after it , and for the briefest instant they frolicked . Rats ! Oh help ! Oh Mary and 200 ladies ! Where are you now ? &quot; OHMYGOD ! &quot; I yelled and rose to my feet dripping with water . The rats instantly evaporated in the direction from which they ' d come , down the hole under the door . I stared wildly in the direction of Pear , but there was absolutely no reaction from that massive back . My call had been lost in the sound of the running , dripping water , and Pear , bent over her task , did not notice . Should I create a scene ? Would she understand ? Or should I save my breath and just calm_down ? What would Florence have done_in my place ? Probably said &quot; Only two ? &quot; but reorganized the sewers . I controlled myself and sat_down . Pear now moved_over to the gobek tasi and placed a small black pillow on the marble in the middle . She seated herself and indicated to me that I was to lie_down on the platform beside her . There was something rather dismaying about all this . The dismal inhibitions started creeping back , but I meekly did as I was told . Then , with a rough luffa-like black glove on her right_hand , she proceeded to go_over my entire body , front and back , rubbing the skin with enormous vigor -- the Keselenmek treatment , which Twain described quite accurately as &quot; polishing. &quot; My feelings of modesty quickly dissipated as I realized the years of naked bodies these gimlet eyes must have seen ; among all_the tall , slim beauties and walrus hulks like herself , I would be very forgettable . I decided at this point that I would attempt to tell her about the rats , so I pointed over to the water exit hole , made a running motion with one hand , said &quot; Squeak , squeak , &quot; and held_up two fingers . She stopped polishing and the gimlet eyes regarded me expressionlessly for a moment . She plainly understood . She then said something in Turkish and made two great chopping movements with her right arm . Was she telling me I should have killed them both ? There was no telling , so I let the subject lapse . After this I was directed to return to my marble basin and rinse myself thoroughly . I came_to notice that each time I moved from one area to another Pear would sluice the area I had vacated with a container of soapy water and carefully rinse it . It was rather less than flattering , but at_the_same_time , reassuring . I returned to the gobek tasi where Pear lathered me all_over with soapsuds and massaged me mercilessly with fingers like brutal little rollers , up and down and round about , rippling over and into every muscle I ever knew I had and a great many I had no idea about , first on one side and then on the other . I am perfectly confident that she had never had a lesson in anatomy in her life , but each muscle got its moment of punitive attention . Periodically she would stop massaging and drum my muscles forcefully with the sides of her great ham-like hands . Tenderizing a steak was a comparison that came_to my mind . Again I had to be rinsed_off , and the same procedure repeated with a mixture of lathering by hand and the rough-textured glove . One at a time she would pick_up my arms -- which were beginning to resemble limp lengths of rubber tubing -- massage them , then put them down , and the same with my legs , and finally my feet . * While I was lying there , the door opened and another customer was led in , draped in a blue towel . She was an attractive small woman with well-cut dark hair . Feeling prudish is a pointless exercise in futility , lying spread-eagled on your back garbed only in soapsuds while being vigorously massaged . But for a moment I wondered whether to just shut my eyes tightly and pretend the newcomer wasn ' t there or to show some sort of recognition . In the end I looked_up and grinned , and the newcomer -- soapless , so by now even more naked than I -- grinned back . She turned_out to be French , and as unfamiliar_with the routine as I . Once again , rather the worse for my pulverizing , I had to totter over to my basin to rinse myself , after which Pear seated herself beside her own basin and indicated that I should sit on the low platform in front of her . She produced a pumice_stone with which she gently pumiced my knees , feet and elbows . The newcomer had been engaged in pouring water over herself since she arrived . Now she called over , &quot; How long do I have to do this ? &quot; &quot; A good long_time , &quot; I replied . I also warned her about the rats and her eyes opened wide . I suspect Pear must have understood because suddenly she grasped my neck in her grip of steel , emptied shampoo straight over my head , and began massaging not just my scalp , but my face , nose and eyes , too , with her great penetrating fingers . I opened my mouth to object and a deluge of rinse water filled it . I was pulled upright and led over to my basin for one final rinse , and it was all_over . Pear wrapped me up in my pink towel , and led me by the hand_out of the room . Perhaps I was meant to rest_on the bed in my cubicle , but I didn ' t wish to , although , in contradiction to Mark Twain ' s description , it was spotlessly clean . I dressed , dried my hair with a blower and went_out , feeling a great_deal cleaner though somewhat filleted and wobbly kneed . But what about the spirited Lady Mary ' s own impressions of this intimate experience ? Did_it release any hidden libido ? And how did she cope , the solitary foreigner among 200 Turkish women ? Ah , here Lady Mary disappoints . Female adventurer she might have been , who loved wandering the streets of Istanbul ( or Constantinople as it was then ) in Turkish disguise , but for this remarkably enlightened woman it seems emancipation didn ' t translate to public_nudity . &quot; I was in my traveling habit , which is a riding dress , &quot; she related , of her arrival among the women at the hamam , &quot; and certainly appeared very extraordinary to them . . . &quot; but they &quot; would fain have undressed me for the bath . . . I was at last forced to open my skirt and show them my stays , which satisfied ' em very well , for I saw they believed I was so locked_up in that machine that it was not in my own power to open it , which contrivance they attributed to my husband. &quot;</TEXT>
