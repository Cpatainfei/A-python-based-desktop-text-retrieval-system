   <HEADLINE> SCENE STEALERS ; IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER THE FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wearing come-hither smiles and rose-colored sunglasses , representatives from Thailand to Pittsburgh descended on Santa Monica last week , hoping to snatch a piece of L.A. ' s signature film and television industry . They had their work cut_out for them . Anyone venturing outside the annual location expo quickly encountered the sparkling Pacific_Ocean , temperatures approaching 80 degrees and maybe even a celebrity or two . Southern California , for all its recent misfortunes , still looked every bit the glamour capital of the universe . &quot; It ' s wonderful -- I rented a convertible , &quot; a partially thawed convention official from New York marveled . But none of that was enough to keep boosters of frozen flatlands , crime-plagued cities and developing countries from making a grab for Tinseltown ' s tarnished crown . Packed into the Santa Monica Convention Center , nearly 200 exhibitors spent three days at Location Expo ' 94 , which ended Monday , pitching their locales as ideal for movie and TV production . They insisted they came not to steal jobs from the Los Angeles area , as some local officials claimed , but to attract so-called &quot; location &quot; work that would be done outside of Southern California anyway . Whatever their motives , the delegates hawked their respective homes with a fervor that , despite the slick brochures and sweet financial inducements , sometimes seemed strained . Consider the sales job confronting North_Dakota , which hopes to capitalize on its status as the nation ' s leading sunflower and rapeseed producer . &quot; There are just huge fields of the stuff , &quot; enthused Kip Stolberg of the North_Dakota Film Office , pointing to the potential for &quot; panoramic crop shots &quot; near Fargo . He also zealously promoted a defunct missile bunker as an ideal sci-fi movie set . But as the convention wound down , it became clear that North_Dakota had a visibility problem . &quot; People walk by here and say , ' Oh , North_Dakota , ' &quot; Stolberg grumbled . &quot; It ' s like an afterthought . Some of these areas are just screaming to be used. &quot; In fact , representatives from almost every corner of the planet showed_up in Santa Monica screaming to be used , which helps explain why the exposition -- sponsored by the Assn . of Film Commissioners International -- is the largest event of its kind anywhere . * The show attracted 6 # 000 people , many of them producer-types based on the Westside . It was one of the major events associated with the American Film Market , a nine-day spree of movie marketing that attracts 10 # 000 visitors annually , injecting millions of dollars into the local economy . For Santa Monica , still recovering from the Jan . 17 earthquake , the timing couldn ' t have been better . &quot; February was a rough month , &quot; said Kathleen Rawson of the city ' s Convention and Visitors Bureau . &quot; With the AFM coming_into town , it filled our hotels again , and they needed it . For them it was the light at the end of the tunnel. &quot; For television and movie producers , meanwhile , the convention provides a way to scour the world for film locales without leaving the confines of the Convention Center . For localities , it ' s a chance to compete for a slice of a $ 4-billion industry that tends to be clean , prestigious and increasingly lucrative . In Utah alone , for example , the industry now pumps $ 88 million a year into the state , up from $ 38 million just two years ago . Los Angeles officials estimate that such location shooting represents a $ 1 billion drain on the local economy , but that is of little concern to far-flung convention delegates who have their own interests to consider . A brochure on Missouri described the Show Me State as &quot; Your 69 # 674-Square-Mile Back Lot , &quot; while Louisiana officials peppered their PR with complimentary grab bags of Cajun spices and other indigenous goodies . &quot; We ' re one of the few states that has really good swamps , &quot; boasted David Jones , director of the Louisiana Film Commission . Still reeling from its much-publicized string of calamities , and from a lingering perception that it isn ' t business-friendly , Los Angeles was fair_game . It was denied exhibit space after failing to register for the expo in time , forcing angry and chagrined city officials to pitch a promotional tent on the grounds of the adjacent county_courthouse . Inside the Convention Center , rival delegations smelled blood . &quot; After California ' s disasters ( fires , earthquakes , mudslides , etc. ) , we ' re getting a lot of calls , &quot; said Karen Runtel of the Oregon Film Office .</TEXT>
