   <HEADLINE> LORENA BOBBITT TESTIFIES ON ABUSE CLAIMS ; ASSAULT : SHE SAYS SHE WAS RAPED , BEATEN AND SUBJECTED TO ' MARINE-TYPE TORTURES ' BY HUSBAND . WITNESSES IN MUTILATION CASE SAY THEY SAW BRUISES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lorena Bobbitt , charged with cutting_off her husband ' s penis , took_the_stand in her own defense Wednesday and told a jury in a trembling voice that her husband , John Wayne Bobbitt , raped her , beat her and used &quot; Marine-type tortures &quot; to cow her into submission during the violent course of their four-year marriage . In halting English , the Ecuadorean-born woman described being forced to participate in anal sex and being threatened frequently with a repetition of the act . &quot; Later , every time we had_sex he would threaten me , &quot; she said softly . &quot; He would say he would like to have that kind of sex . . . . I tried not to let it happen again. &quot; Mrs . Bobbitt ' s emotional testimony came_on the third day of a trial that has drawn international attention because of the unusual nature of the crime . If convicted on a charge of malicious wounding the 24-year-old manicurist faces_up to 20 years in prison as well as deportation to Venezuela , where she grew_up . Although Mrs . Bobbitt has admitted committing the mutilation of her husband , the defense has taken the position that she was a battered wife driven to temporary insanity . Her husband , an ex-Marine whose penis was reattached after nine hours of surgery on the day after the June 23 , 1993 , incident , was acquitted of marital assault last November . Much of the evidence produced in the last two days of testimony was never introduced at the previous trial , which was limited to the events that immediately preceded the mutilation and focused more narrowly on the issue of whether John Bobbitt had raped his wife on the night in_question . The defense hopes to convince the jury of seven women and five men that Mrs . Bobbitt is the &quot; classic example &quot; of a battered spouse who , pushed to the edge by &quot; constant and relentless violence , &quot; acted_on an &quot; irresistible_impulse &quot; she could not control . To do that , defense_lawyers Blair Howard and James Lowe began by putting John Bobbitt on the stand as a hostile witness and allowing him to deny a series of specific instances in which Mrs . Bobbitt has said that she was beaten , threatened or verbally abused by him . They then began calling witnesses who testified that they had seen Bobbitt abuse his wife on those occasions or that they had seen bruises on her body . Two witnesses , friends of Bobbitt ' s , also testified that he once confessed to enjoying forced sex and watching women &quot; squirm. &quot; As the extraordinary trial entered its third day Wednesday in this small_town 30 miles west of the nation ' s capital , six more witnesses -- either friends or acquaintances of Mrs . Bobbitt -- testified that she came_to them , crying hysterically at times , after Bobbitt had beaten her . From their comments to reporters earlier in the trial , it was clear that Bobbitt ' s lawyers had been hoping to discredit his wife ' s accusations by reminding the jury that no physical evidence of abuse was ever uncovered at his trial . But while a physician who treated Mrs . Bobbitt for stress-related symptoms last June admitted under cross-examination that she saw no bruises on her body , four other witnesses called by the defense Wednesday testified that they saw bruise marks and swellings on her arms , shoulders , head and hips when she came_to them after an episode of alleged abuse . &quot; Sometimes she would get hysterical and shake and cry . At other times she would be very quiet and depressed , &quot; said Mary Jo Willoughby , a friend in whom Mrs . Bobbitt confided frequently . &quot; I saw bruises on her wrists , upper arms and forehead , &quot; declared Beth Ann Wilson , the assistant manager of the apartment_building where the Bobbitts lived . Recalling an incident that occurred about two weeks before the mutilation , Wilson said that she was talking with Mrs . Bobbitt and watched her begin to tremble visibly when her husband approached . &quot; You could see the fear in her . It was obvious she was having a terrible time. &quot; Another witness , Mercedes Castro , said that she took Polaroid pictures of bruises on Mrs . Bobbitt ' s right hip , left shoulder and arms when the defendant came_to her home one night in early 1991 , looking &quot; really scared and crying. &quot; The emotional high point of the trial came when Mrs . Bobbitt herself was called to the stand earlier than the defense originally had planned . Before eliciting Bobbitt ' s testimony , defense_lawyers had planned to question a psychiatrist who would buttress the argument that the defendant was psychologically driven to commit an act that she never would have contemplated under normal circumstances . But Judge Herman Whisenant Jr . ruled that the psychiatrist could testify only about facts already introduced into evidence . His ruling could have hampered the testimony unless Mrs . Bobbitt introduced into the record some of the alleged episodes on which the psychiatric evaluation was based . In nearly two hours on the stand , she gave her account of episodes described in almost mirror-image fashion by her husband the day before . She spoke softly at first of how marrying the young , handsome Marine lance_corporal had been a &quot; dream &quot; come true -- one that meant she could have the home and family that she always wanted in the United States . But she said the dream soon became a nightmare . Her husband began abusing her , she testified , when she objected to his desire to make extravagant purchases that they could ill-afford or to his inclination to invite friends and family to stay_at their tiny efficiency_apartment without consulting her beforehand . Mrs . Bobbitt said that he first hit her while they were driving_home from an evening at a Washington bar . He was drunk and &quot; zig-zagging all_over &quot; the road , she said . She pleaded with him to pull over to the side of the road and tried to grab the wheel . &quot; Then he punched me . I started to cry and he called me ugly names and told me to stop but I couldn ' t. &quot; When the couple arrived home , &quot; he hit me and pulled my hair and squeezed my face and told me , ' I told you not to cry , ' &quot; she said . After that , the violence gradually worsened , she testified . Bobbitt not only struck her but used what she characterized as &quot; Marine-style torture . . , karate-type techniques &quot; to abuse her.TRIALS</TEXT>
