   <HEADLINE> O.C. DOCTOR CONVICTED OF MURDERS IN ' 93 CRASH ; TRIAL : COLLISION KILLED MISSION VIEJO COUPLE . LAGUNA BEACH PHYSICIAN WAS UNDER INFLUENCE OF DRUGS , ALCOHOL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Laguna Beach physician with a history of drunk driving arrests was convicted on two murder counts Wednesday for driving while intoxicated and causing a car wreck that killed a Mission Viejo couple and injured three others . Dr. Ronald Allen , 32 , who was_well known for treating poor AIDS patients , becomes one of the few drivers in Orange County to be charged and convicted of second-degree murder for taking lives while driving under the influence . He was found guilty by a Superior_Court jury in Santa Ana that deliberated for 2 1 / 2 days after trial testimony ended . He faces a maximum term of 30 years to life in prison when he is sentenced Feb . 24 in the deaths of Mark and Noreen Minzey . The verdict brought exclamations of &quot; Oh , God &quot; and sobs from friends of the Minzeys , including Jackie Rodriguez , who was riding with the couple . Rodriguez was injured in the crash , along with her sister , Danielle , and the Minzeys ' daughter , Karie . Allen sat with his head bowed and eyes closed for most of the proceeding , showing no visible emotion as the verdicts were read . &quot; He was given a gift to save lives , and look what ' s done with it , &quot; Jackie Rodriguez said afterward . &quot; He took two lives . He should just be put_away and not be allowed to go_back to the streets. &quot; Outside the courtroom , Rebecca Rodriguez , the mother of Jackie and Danielle , said : &quot; I was praying to God that the public was tired_of drunk drivers , and today the jury ' s verdict shows me they are. &quot; &quot; He has to answer to God now , &quot; she said . &quot; We can forgive him , but he has to live with it. &quot; Noreen Minzey , 33 , and Mark Minzey , 38 , were_on their way home after attending Karie ' s softball_game on July 11 , 1993 , when their car was struck head-on by Allen ' s rented vehicle on Santiago Canyon Road near Orange . The crash left Karie Minzey , now 12 , critically injured with broken bones and head injuries . Jackie Rodriguez , now 25 , suffered burns on her legs and Danielle Rodriguez , now 12 , sustained a broken arm . Allen was found to have been driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs . Most intoxicated drivers in fatal collisions are charged with vehicular manslaughter , which carries a maximum prison_term of 11 years . But prosecutors took the unusual step of lodging the most serious charges possible against Allen , arguing that his medical background and two prior arrests on suspicion of driving while intoxicated made him fully aware of the deadly risks when he got_behind the wheel . Assistant Deputy Public_Defender Michael P . Giannini had asked jurors to convict Allen on lesser charges of manslaughter , arguing that his client was suffering from clinical_depression and struggling financially . Just hours before the crash , Allen had learned that his father had died of a heart_attack . After the verdict , Giannini said that being labeled a murderer was painful for the doctor . &quot; Here is still a man who trained his whole life to save lives and now members of the community are labeling him a murderer , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s a very difficult philosophical pill for him to swallow. &quot; Giannini said he is disappointed in the verdict and plans to appeal . He will also argue at sentencing for much less than the maximum term . But jurors said that despite the tragic aspects of the case for Allen , he deserved a tough sentence because he must have known what could happen when he decided to drink , take drugs and drive . Allen ' s prior drunk driving arrests and medical training also convinced jurors that he had sufficient understanding that he could harm others when he took the wheel , according to jury foreman John Gornik of Buena Park . &quot; We didn ' t figure he was a bad_person because of prior incidents , but we knew he knew the consequences , &quot; Gornik said . Gornik added that jurors tried hard not to become emotionally involved in the case or step into the role of crusaders against drunk driving . &quot; All we wanted to say was these are the laws and they were broken . We feel we did the right thing , &quot; he said . Juror Ron Taylor , 34 , said tempers flared during deliberations because some jurors weren ' t at first convinced that Allen knew what he was doing . &quot; It was very difficult because a_few of us were leaning the other way at first and felt he was out of his mind , &quot; he said . &quot; But we came_to the conclusion that he knew what he was doing . He was very smart. &quot; Taylor said the fact that Allen didn ' t testify worked against him . &quot; I felt he might have seemed more sympathetic if he had testified , &quot; he said . Taylor said Karie Minzey ' s testimony , during which she said she felt no anger toward Allen , touched jurors and made them sympathize_with the Minzey family . &quot; We were all amazed at her attitude , &quot; he said . &quot; We all wished we were a lot like her and could forgive that way . Her testimony had a big emotional impact on us. &quot; Her testimony was also an emotional turning point for Allen , helping him accept responsibility for what he has done , his lawyer said . &quot; That did more_than for him than any verdict the jury could have , &quot; Giannini said . &quot; He is totally remorseful . But to know that she is not going_to spend her life in anger and being embittered also gives him tremendous hope . The girl ' s forgiveness took_away some of the horrible sting he feels. &quot; Besides the second-degree murder counts , the jury found Allen guilty of felony drunk driving for the injuries to Karie Minzey and the Rodriguezes . Karie and her older sister , Shelbie , who was not involved in the crash , now live with an aunt and uncle in Georgia . The family greeted the verdict with relief . &quot; We ' re just really glad it ' s over , &quot; said Jeanine Posey , the girls ' aunt and Mark Minzey ' s sister . &quot; We ' re glad that he got all three counts . Hopefully it will save someone else ' s life. &quot; Karie , who had helped lead her all-star softball team to victory shortly before the crash , suffered a broken left knee and right wrist , but the most serious injuries were to her head . While she was in a coma , doctors shaved her head and removed nearly the entire left side of her skull to relieve pressure on her swollen brain . She had to learn to walk again and must undergo further operations . The removed portion of her skull was frozen and later replaced , but it has not healed properly and has left a large sunken spot on the left rear of her head . Deputy Dist . Atty . Robert Molko has termed the incident &quot; the most egregious drunk driving case &quot; he ' s seen in 20 years &quot; both because of the injuries and how much knowledge he ( Allen ) had of drugs. &quot; &quot; He learned so_much in medical_school and yet with all that awareness , he ended_up committing one of the worst deeds you can , &quot; he continued . On the day of the crash , Molko said Allen had been driving recklessly , using left-turn pockets to speed ahead of traffic on the rural road . Blood_tests show Allen had used alcohol and taken_five different drugs , including a &quot; substantial &quot; amount of Valium , before the fatal crash . During the trial , Molko also emphasized Allen ' s previous brushes with the law . In June , 1993 -- shortly before the fatal crash -- Allen was arrested on suspicion of public intoxication , hit-and-run driving and resisting arrest after he allegedly rammed his car into three parked vehicles in Laguna Beach . That case was pending at the time of the July 11 accident . Hours before the crash that killed the Minzeys , Allen was cited for speeding . But the officer who stopped him did not discover an outstanding warrant for his arrest stemming from another collision in April , 1992 , when Allen allegedly rear-ended a car while driving drunk in Laguna Niguel . In late 1992 , Allen had consumed alcohol shortly before he was stopped by a police_officer in Palm Springs , according to court testimony . The officer admonished Allen after learning of his profession , saying , &quot; You should know better than that , &quot; according to court records . But Giannini stressed through the trial that Allen had never been convicted of driving while intoxicated , although charges were pending at the time of the fatal crash , and asked jurors not to discriminate against Allen because of his medical background . Allen also faces civil lawsuits seeking damages filed by the Minzey and Rodriguez families . Times staff writer Diane Seo contributed to this report .
