   <HEADLINE> ABORTION CLINIC SLAYINGS MAY KILL OPERATION RESCUE ; MOVEMENT : VIOLENCE DRIVES A WEDGE BETWEEN MILITANTS AND THE CHRISTIAN_CHURCHES THAT BACKED TERRY ' S GROUP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Operation Rescue , the militant anti-abortion group that mobilized a segment of Christian fundamentalists and brought the tactics of civil_disobedience to the conservative cause , is_on the verge of collapse as a significant political_movement . With Operation Rescue ' s influence already in decline , the brutal slaying of an abortion doctor and his escort in Pensacola , Fla. , on July 29 by the leader of an extremist anti-abortion splinter_group may prove to be the movement ' s political death_knell , according to leaders of the organization and others involved in the abortion debate . Indeed , while sporadic anti-abortion violence and fitful street protests undoubtedly will continue , the ability of Operation Rescue and related groups to tap elements of the Christian right in large_numbers seems likely to be a thing of the past . Although the anti-abortion movement includes Catholics and others , the bulk of its supporters , especially Operation Rescue members , are Christian fundamentalists . Ironically , Operation Rescue ' s hold_on the fundamentalist movement is slipping at a time when &quot; born-again &quot; Christians are more politically active than ever and are making well-documented inroads into the Republican_Party ' s hierarchy . But the spreading anti-abortion violence has finally created a wedge between anti-abortion militants and their natural base in Christian_churches , where Operation Rescue has always turned for money and recruits . &quot; I think the general feeling in the churches is that we don ' t care what Randall Terry ( Operation Rescue ' s founder ) has to say about abortion anymore , &quot; said Bob Jewitt , a spokesman for Operation Rescue . &quot; They are tired_of the debate. &quot; &quot; It is sad , but even Christian radio_station managers tell me they are tired_of hearing about &quot; the anti-abortion movement , Jewitt said . &quot; A lot of people in the Christian community are burned_out on this. &quot; The murders , which included the third shooting of an abortion physician in less than 18 months , have been the most damaging of any because this time , a leader of the movement is accused of pulling the trigger . Paul Hill , a defrocked fundamentalist minister and leader of his self-styled Pensacola-based group , Defensive Action , was charged with the murders . That has made_it quite awkward for anti-abortion groups to dismiss the crime as an isolated incident , as they have attempted to do with previous acts of violence . In fact , more_than 20 other extremist leaders have signed petitions circulated and published by Hill in recent months endorsing the killing of abortion doctors as &quot; justifiable homicide. &quot; Not only has that severely damaged the movement within the fundamentalist community , but it also has prompted an intensive , nationwide federal investigation of the anti-abortion movement ' s leadership . The Clinton_Administration has deployed U.S. marshals to provide protection for abortion clinics in 12 cities , and the Justice_Department has established a joint task_force between the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms to investigate militant anti-abortion groups . Almost overnight , Operation Rescue has been effectively stripped of its political rank in Washington . It has gone from being perceived as a player on the fundamentalist Christian right to the untouchable status of a violence-prone cult . Hill ' s crime prompted Rep . Charles E . Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) and other congressional leaders who favor abortion rights to demand that the FBI begin undercover infiltration of anti-abortion groups . The Pensacola killings are &quot; not a form of protest against abortion , it is murder by terrorists , no different from the murders resulting from the World Trade Center bombing , and it must be treated just as seriously as we treat other terrorist attacks , &quot; charged Schumer . &quot; They are clearly on the ropes -- their former supporters are backing_off because of the violence , &quot; said Dallas Blanchard , a sociologist at the University of West Florida and author of two books on anti-abortion violence . Only a scattered few conservative Republican lawmakers -- notably Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) and Sen . Robert C . Smith ( R-N.H. ) -- have rallied to the defense of anti-abortion militants this time . Most conservatives have remained silent . Operation Rescue officials cringe at each act of violence and have sought to distance themselves from militants like Hill . The group ' s new national director , Flip Benham , confronted Hill and others who are said to favor violence at a secret meeting of anti-abortion leaders in Chicago in April . That meeting followed an even more emotional leadership conference in Melbourne , Fla. , last September , during which Keith Tucci , then head of Operation Rescue , decreed that the group would expel any members who advocated violence . Yet Operation Rescue , founded eight years ago in Upstate New York , has suffered from the violence and has been hit by dramatic reductions in membership and contributions . At fundamentalist churches where Operation Rescue rallies once could draw thousands , they now can generate crowds of only a_few hundred . The group ' s annual budget , which totaled $ 400 # 000 as recently as 1992 , has been plunging since early last year , following the March , 1993 , killing of Dr. David Gunn , another Pensacola abortion clinic physician . Donations slipped again after the August , 1993 , shooting of Dr. George Tiller in Wichita , Kan . The organization fears another steep decline in the wake of last month ' s shotgun slayings of Dr. John Bayard Britton and his escort , abortion-rights advocate James H . Barrett . &quot; It ' s been a nightmare , &quot; said Patrick Mahoney , national spokesman for Operation Rescue . &quot; In terms of the public perception of our movement , the impact from the violence has been extremely harsh . It makes people who might join us view us in a different light and to be afraid to go_out in front of a clinic . And it has been devastating economically for the finances of the major anti-abortion groups. &quot; Even before the Pensacola killings , Operation Rescue was reeling from a series of legislative and legal defeats in 1994 . The group ' s ability to mount headline-grabbing street theater and abortion clinic blockades -- the key to its political influence -- has been sharply eroded through a series of Supreme Court rulings and new legislation imposing tough federal penalties for abortion protests . In January , the Supreme Court ruled that federal racketeering laws could be used to investigate and prosecute anti-abortion groups . Abortion-rights groups believe that ruling will prove a potent weapon against anti-abortion organizations that have learned how to change their legal names and hide their assets to skirt civil and criminal_court injunctions . In June , the court ruled that &quot; buffer zones &quot; to prevent protest and loud chanting around abortion clinics do not violate the First_Amendment rights of anti-abortion demonstrators . Such zones are rapidly being thrown_up around clinics throughout the nation . Overshadowing the court rulings , however , was the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act . Signed into law by President Clinton in May , the act makes_it a federal crime , punishable by up_to six months in prison , to blockade an abortion clinic or to engage in other forms of disruptive civil_disobedience around clinics . Local anti-abortion leaders report that many volunteers are drifting away from Operation Rescue as a result . Since it went_into effect , only small handfuls of demonstrators have been willing to challenge the law by blockading clinics . &quot; Our free speech rights have been eliminated in front of abortion clinics by a politically correct Supreme Court and Congress , &quot; fumed Jay Sekulow , chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice , which represents anti-abortion demonstrators in court cases . Internal divisions over the violence have also led to a breakup of the group ' s national leadership , leaving Operation Rescue with just four full-time staff_members in its Dallas headquarters . At last September ' s leadership meeting , Tucci demanded that all Operation Rescue leaders sign a written pledge condemning violence , and his hard-line stance on the issue angered many other leaders , creating a rift that now divides the anti-abortion movement into a series of small , largely ineffective factions . Paul Hill and Michael Griffin , the anti-abortion extremist convicted of murdering Gunn , &quot; have accomplished what ( abortion-rights leaders ) Patricia Ireland and Molly Yard failed to do -- and that is split_up a very tight-knit group of pro-life leaders , &quot; Mahoney said .</TEXT>
