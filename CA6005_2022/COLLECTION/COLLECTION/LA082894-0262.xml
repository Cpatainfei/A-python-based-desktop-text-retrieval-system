   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; ROCK ' S TOP 40</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> MICHELE ANTHONY , 37 , executive_vice_president of Sony Music Entertainment . This former Los Angeles attorney , whose clients included Guns N ' Roses and Soundgarden , is widely admired for being skilled at both day-to-day operations and for relating to artists . She played a pivotal role in securing deals with Pearl Jam , Alice in Chains and the return to Sony of Aerosmith . KEN BERRY , 42 , CEO of EMI Records Group International and Virgin Music Group . This Brit quietly built Virgin into one of the industry ' s most attractive independent labels . If Virgin maintains its momentum , Berry -- who besides running Virgin is the No . 2 man in EMI ' s international operation -- could add the U.S. operations to his domain if business doesn ' t improve domestically for EMI . CHRIS BLACKWELL , 57 , chairman of Island Records . After selling his Island Records to PolyGram in 1989 for $ 300 million , the word was that Blackwell -- who helped make Bob Marley and U2 international forces -- had lost interest in the music business . But he ' s back full-time following a new arrangement with PolyGram . JOHN BRANCA , 43 , attorney . He must be tired by now of hearing that he looks more like a rock musician than a lawyer , but one of the reasons Branca ' s the industry ' s top legal gun on the West Coast is that he relates so well to the artists , including Michael Jackson , Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones . He was instrumental in sculpting the Interscope and American Recordings deals . TONY BROWN , 47 , president of MCA Records / Nashville . You got a sense this year of just how hot Brown is when other labels began throwing money at him , hoping to lure him away from MCA , where he had either signed or produced records by such stars as Reba McEntire , Vince Gill , Wynonna Judd and Lyle Lovett . JHERYL BUSBY , 45 , president and CEO of Motown Records . Things have been slow at Motown , but this is a cyclical business and Busby is a hard_worker with savvy instincts . So he remains a factor , especially with a roster that includes Boyz II Men , Queen Latifah and ( don ' t forget ) Stevie Wonder . CLIVE CALDER , chief of Jive Records . You may never see a photo of Calder even in the trades , but you certainly hear the hits from his label . In Top 40 now : R . Kelly ' s &quot; Your Body ' s Callin ' &quot; and Aaliyah ' s &quot; Back and Forth. &quot; So why does this South_African native in his mid-40s keep such a low profile ? Responded his assistant , &quot; No comment. &quot; CLIVE DAVIS , 61 , president and CEO of Arista Records . Critics may_not always agree with the taste of this hands-on music exec ( bestsellers include Ace of Base and Kenny G ) , but no one can argue with his results . Last year , Arista racked_up $ 220 million in U.S. sales in 1993 -- the best in its 18-year history . DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY SoundScan ' s Mike Shalett , 42 , and Mike Fine , 51 , introduced a computerized monitoring system that for the first time told labels exactly how many of their albums were sold each week . Now look_for a similar impact from Broadcast Data Systems , a tracking system that gives companies the same accuracy when it comes_to radio airplay of records . MICHAEL DORNEMANN , 48 , chairman and CEO of Bertelsmann Music Group . Don ' t expect this former IBM and BMW executive to ever be mentioned in the same breath as Clive Davis or Mo Ostin , but BMG has moved during his watch past EMI and MCA into a third-place share_in the domestic record industry . 1993 worldwide sales : $ 3 billion . DR . DRE / SUGE KNIGHT , both 29 , co-owners of Death Row Records . Rap producer extraordinaire Dr. Dre , left , and partner Marion ( Suge ) Knight couldn ' t get anyone to finance their gangsta rap record label three years go because both had criminal_records and contract disputes . But Interscope took_a_chance and it paid_off with an estimated $ 60 million in sales this year . TIM DUBOIS , 46 , president of Arista Nashville . After early success as a songwriter ( the novelty gem &quot; She Got the Goldmine , I Got the Shaft &quot; ) , this former financial analyst moved_into production and then to his current post . Results of his golden touch at Arista : Alan Jackson , Brooks &amp; Dunn and Diamond Rio . He ' s been rewarded with his own Texas label . DON ENGEL , 64 , attorney . It ' s understandable why record executives get nervous when Engel ' s on the phone . The dapper Los Angeles attorney may come_across as low-key , but he ' s widely regarded_as the toughest litigator in the industry . When artists , including Clint Black and Don Henley , want to break or revise their contracts , Engel gets the call . JAMES G . FIFIELD , 52 , president and CEO of EMI Music . There was lots of snickering two years ago when everyone thought this former General Mills manager , who heads the long-troubled , $ 2.64-billion EMI Music global empire , paid w-a-a-a-y too_much ( $ 1 billion ) for Virgin Records . But Virgin is now the jewel of the EMI stable . Future challenge : Shore_up the rest of that stable . DAVID GEFFEN , 51 , founder of the David Geffen Co . The big question is what he ' s going_to do with his $ 1 billion once his contract with Matsushita ( which now owns Geffen Records ) expires at the end of this year . If he leaves the music business , it may be because the sharpest man in the industry wants new challenges . On to politics ? DAVID GLEW , 53 , chairman of Epic Records Group . With input from such aides as Richard Griffith and Glen Brunman , Glew has expanded the Epic image boldly in such varied areas as contemporary rock ( Pearl Jam , Rage Against the Machine ) and soundtracks ( &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; and &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; ) . DANNY GOLDBERG , 44 , president of Atlantic Records . This former manager of Bonnie Raitt and Nirvana was brought_in by Doug Morris three years ago to strengthen the label ' s rock credentials . In a remarkable series of moves , Goldberg , cut deals with four promising indie labels : Matador , Mammoth , Rhino and Curb Records . Look_for him to be elevated to head of the entire Atlantic Music Group by year ' s end . ALLEN GRUBMAN , 51 , attorney . One reason so many superstars turn_to him when it comes_to renewing contracts is that Grubman is the man that the industry kingpins -- from David Geffen to Tommy Mottola -- also turn_to when they need counsel . Billy Joel once accused Grubman of conflict-of-interest , but other stars who rely_on him include Madonna , Bruce Springsteen and Mariah Carey . ANDRE HARRELL , 33 , CEO of Uptown Entertainment . After the dramatic success of such acts_as Mary J . Blige and Jodeci led to a spectacular $ 50-million pact with MCA in 1992 , Harrell , to some degree , is_on trial , following the loss of talent_scout Sean ( Puffy ) Combs and staff producer DeVante Swing , who signed a production deal with Death Row Records . But he ' s still got the acts and is making a move_into TV and movies . DON IENNER , 41 , chairman of Columbia Records Group . Known as a sagacious worker with a quick_temper , Ienner has reportedly doubled profits at the Columbia label , devoting as much time to such young mavericks as Cypress Hill and Alice in Chains as such established superstars Pink Floyd and Billy Joel . He ' s skyrocketing . JIMMY IOVINE / TED FIELD , 41 and 42 respectively , Interscope Records . Just as doomsayers two years ago were saying that there was no longer room in the conglomerate era for the maverick vision that built the industry , financier Field ( left , above ) and record producer Iovine parlayed a strong vision ( for cutting-edge forces such_as alternative rock and gangsta rap ) and a Time Warner financial stake into the pop success story of the ' 90s . CHARLES KOPPELMAN , 52 , chairman and CEO of EMI Records Group North_America . The veteran music man was lauded for luring talent guru Gary Gersh away from Geffen Records , helping orchestrate last year ' s Frank Sinatra comeback for Capitol and the unexpected success this year with the Benedictine Monks on Angel . But many feel his ERG division is still in need of a life-support system . L.A. REID &amp; BABYFACE , 38 and 36 respectively , LaFace Records . Antonio Reid and Kenny Edmonds ( top , above ) -- whose credits include writing and producing Boyz II Men ' s &quot; End of the Road &quot; and much of the Toni Braxton album -- may have called it quits as a studio team , but they ' ll continue running this hugely successful R &amp; B and rap Atlanta label . ALAIN LEVY , 47 , CEO of PolyGram International . As head of a $ 3.8-billion global operation , this Frenchman continues to try to find the formula to put PolyGram in position to make a serious run at the industry dominance of Sony and Warner Music . The latest , pricey acquisitions : Motown and Def Jam distribution pact . JUDY McGRATH , 41 , president of MTV Music Television . There isn ' t anybody you ' d rather have owing you a favor than McGrath because MTV remains the best way to build an audience for a new record . With the full support of chairman and CEO Tom Freston , McGrath is the one who pushed the cable channel to take a higher political and social profile in recent years . ROBERT MORGADO , 50 , chairman of Warner Music Group . Morgado ' s bold directive to Doug Morris to overhaul Atlantic Records has resulted in dramatically increasing not only the bottom_line , but the credibility of the company ' s artist roster . Now the industry is waiting to see if his equally daring moves_in restructuring Warner Bros . and Elektra also pay_off . 1993 global sales : $ 5.4 billion . DOUG MORRIS , 54 , chief operating officer of Warner Music USA . No one has made more impressive strides since the last Calendar Top 40 in 1992 than this New Yorker , who came_out from the shadow of legendary Atlantic chairman Ahmet Ertegun into his own when Robert Morgado asked him in 1990 to rejuvenate the slumbering label . Morris delivered so well that Morgado elevated him to the No . 2 U.S. post . THOMAS D . MOTTOLA , 44 , president and chief operating officer of Sony Music Entertainment . This former talent manager ( Hall &amp; Oates and John Mellencamp ) hasn ' t just prevailed at Sony , he is now widely regarded_as a formidable player with strong leadership qualities . With Sony ' s troubles in its movie and TV ventures , Mottola ' s Music division is the jewel in the Sony entertainment complex . MO OSTIN , 67 , chairman of Warner Bros Records . Tick . . . tick . . . tick . that ' s the sound of an era ending as this legendary figure in the business for three decades steps_down on Jan . 1 . He not only brought_to the Burbank label a philosophy in the ' 60s that the artist is king , but he also instituted a competitive management system that remains a model for the industry . PEARL JAM , rock_band . Any rock act that sells 12 million albums in two years has power , but few use that muscle for anything other_than to build a career . Pearl Jam ( with singer Eddie Vedder , above ) is the exception . In a complaint filed with the government in May , the band charged that Ticketmaster is a monopoly that prevented the group from staging a low-price summer tour . SYLVIA RHONE , 42 , CEO of Elektra / EastWest Records . The status of women was so low in the industry two years ago that no one interviewed nominated a woman for Calendar ' s Top 40 list even though Rhone was already CEO of EastWest Records , whose roster included En Vogue . But Morris and Morgado were watching and they named her to head Elektra Records , one of the industry ' s most distinguished labels . FRED ROSEN , 45 , chairman of Ticketmaster . If you want to go_on tour in America , the road leads through Rosen ' s company , which virtually controls the nation ' s pop-rock ticket distribution system . But Rosen ' s power is being tested by the Pearl Jam antitrust complaint -- a move that he dismisses as a publicity stunt . RICK RUBIN , 31 , founder of American Recordings . His label seemed ideally positioned two years ago to attract all_the new cutting-edge rock and rap acts , but Interscope appears to have steamrolled past him . Though Rubin ' s roster -- which includes Danzig , Black Crowes and Sir Mix-a-Lot -- still has some punch , his strength may be tied more to his production credits . MICHAEL P . SCHULHOF , 51 , CEO of Sony Corp . of America and Sony Music . When it comes_to the revitalization of Sony in the ' 90s , this former physicist began the ball rolling by orchestrating Sony ' s $ 1-billion purchase of CBS Records and then installing the unproven Mottola to run it . The result : worldwide grosses of $ 4.5 billion , which puts Sony right on the heels of perennial leader Warner Music . RUSSELL SIMMONS , 37 , chairman of Rush Communications . Simmons may often seem like he ' s moving_in 10 directions at once -- from movies to TV to music -- but he ' s got a feel_for the street pulse . that ' s why PolyGram ' s Levy paid an estimated $ 50 million for a record label that rivals say has been losing money . Latest Def Jam hits : Warren G and Onyx . SEYMOUR STEIN , 52 , president of Sire Records . You don ' t hear as much about the godfather of alternative music as in the ' 70s and ' 80s when he was signing Madonna , Talking Heads and the Pretenders . One reason is the rest of the industry has learned from his daring and now competes with him for the acts that once seemed on the commercial fringe . AL TELLER , 50 , chairman of MCA Music Entertainment and executive_vice_president of MCA Inc. Besides running MCA Records , Teller oversees the entire MCA music distribution network , which includes the hot Nashville country division and the always potent Geffen Records . Respected as a sharp strategist and keen manager , Teller still needs to expand MCA ' s low domestic market share . 1993 worldwide sales : $ 1.6 billion . VIDEO JUKEBOX NETWORK What to do if you can ' t get your controversial rock or rap videos on MTV ? You turn_to the Box , founded by former MTV executive Les Garland to play videos 24 hours a day . Selection of videos on the Box cable channel is determined by viewer requests and &quot; playola &quot; -- a system that , for $ 27 # 000 from a label , gets play for a specific video . And don ' t think executives leave request lines to chance . They reportedly hire phone solicitors to jam the lines . LENNY WARONKER , 52 , president and CEO of Warner Bros . Records . Because he has been so closely identified with Mo Ostin , it ' s hard for many industry observers to imagine Waronker taking_over the reins at Warner Bros . Records . But he ' s going_to start Jan . 1 -- and he ' s a popular choice within the company because he ' s so artist-oriented . THE WILD CARD No one knows exactly which budding computer genius will revolutionize the record business by changing the way we think_about hearing and seeing music . But the chances are the hotshot already has a subscription to Wired , the Rolling Stone of the emerging computer culture . Companies already are scrambling to set_up on-line services to tap into the world of virtual_reality -- and exploit it .</TEXT>
