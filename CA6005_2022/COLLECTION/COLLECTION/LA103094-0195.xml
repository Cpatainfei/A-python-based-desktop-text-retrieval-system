   <HEADLINE> ILLEGAL STUDENTS GIVEN PREFERENTIAL COVERAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Your front page on Oct . 23 had two stories showing what the Los Angeles Times considers to be of_import . One featured an illegal alien student attending Cal State Northridge ; the other , the shooting death of a Los Angeles police_officer . The illegal alien student has his color photograph on the first page , and other illegal aliens are given large photos on pages 26 and 27 . The officer ' s photograph is buried on page 28 . The prominence you gave to the illegal aliens is an insult to the officer who gave his life to the city . The Los Angeles Times has gone too far in political correctness . Contrary to a belief of your newspaper and leftist Democrats , the state of California is not a province of Mexico . The victory of Proposition 187 will be proof that the state of California belongs_to the United States of America . The illegal alien students should be immediately picked_up and deported to the country_of_origin or pay the tuition charged to foreign students . When the trustees are proposing to raise student fees by 10 % , it does not make any sense to allow illegal aliens to attend California State University without paying higher tuition . It is an injustice to the thousands of foreign students who pay the higher tuition . This is another example that people who play by the rules are the fools . RICHARD K . YAMAUCHI Sylmar</TEXT>
