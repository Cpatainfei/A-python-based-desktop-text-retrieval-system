   <HEADLINE> FIRST EVIDENCE OF ASTEROID MOON SHOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> NASA scientists at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory on Wednesday released the first evidence of a moon orbiting an asteroid , a discovery that could yield clues to the creation of the solar_system and how the traffic_jam of orbiting rocks between Mars and Jupiter came_into being . The moon , a mountain of stone about a mile in diameter , appears to circle an asteroid the size of Los Angeles , called Ida . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration released a photograph of the asteroid and its newly discovered moon . &quot; This is the first clear detection of a satellite of an asteroid , &quot; said Clark R . Chapman at the Planetary Science Institute at Caltech in Pasadena . &quot; There have been hints before . &quot; One reason this is important is that asteroids have played a role in shaping our own planet . We need to understand these objects that rain_down on us , &quot; he said . Such small pairs of asteroids and their moons may be responsible_for unusual double craters found in Canada , Siberia and on the surface of the moon and Mars , astronomers and scientists said Wednesday . &quot; At first we worried it might be scrambled data , but most of us were believers , &quot; said imaging team member Ann Harch , who first spotted the object near Ida in a photograph transmitted to Earth by the agency ' s Galileo probe . Aesthetically , it is just so beautiful to think_of all these objects dancing out there together . &quot; Discovery . . . . It ' s great ! &quot; she said . Science Coordinator Marcia Segura , who helped confirm the moon ' s existence with measurements from an infrared sensor also on board Galileo , said , &quot; At first we were kind of blase about it . Then we were really jazzed . Really excited . The adrenalin is still pumping . It comes_in waves. &quot; So far the only thing NASA scientists can say for certain about Ida ' s moon is that it exists -- hanging_in space , about 62 miles from the larger asteroid , well within its sphere of gravity . Both lie_in the belt of more_than 50 # 000 cold , dusty , meteor-pocked rocks between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter . But it may be months before scientists can determine its composition , its orbit around Ida or how fast it is moving . They do know that for an object in the deep_freeze of space , it is relatively warm -- about 99 degrees Fahrenheit below zero . &quot; I am sorry I can ' t be definite ( now ) but the indications are that the satellite is the same type of material as Ida , &quot; said Robert W . Carlson , the JPL scientist in_charge of the infrared mapping sensor on Galileo . &quot; It is so similar that it may even be part of the same rock Ida is -- a true daughter of Ida. &quot; NASA scientists said Wednesday they suspect the moon and Ida were formed at_the_same_time , but they don ' t know when . Ida , a battered rock shaped like a sweet_potato , belongs_to the Koranis family of asteroids . Scientists think the group was formed when a very large asteroid perhaps 180 miles in diameter broke_up several hundred million years ago , creating a constellation of smaller orbiting fragments of rock . Galileo project scientists said they think that the moon may be a smaller fragment from the break-up of that parent body , or that it may be a chip_off the asteroid Ida itself caused by a more recent collision . They said it was virtually impossibly that the moon just happened to wander by the larger asteroid and be captured by its gravity field . One thing they hope to learn from Ida and its moon is how such small orbiting bodies interact within the asteroid_belt , under conditions that resemble those during the formation of the solar_system . Now that they have found one moon_around an asteroid , NASA scientists said , they will step_up the search for others . &quot; If you find one , then it is probably not the only one . We will be taking_a_look for others , &quot; said Michael J.S. Belton , a space imaging expert from the National Optical Astronomy Observatories in Tucson . The new_moon has been provisionally designated &quot; 1993 ( 243 ) 1 , &quot; meaning that it is the first natural satellite discovered in 1993 near Ida , which in turn was the 243rd asteroid discovered over the past two centuries . Eventually , the International Astronomical Union will give the moon its formal name . All About Ida * Background : The moon was photographed by Jupiter-bound space_probe Galileo last Aug . 28 , about 14 minutes before its closest approach to the asteroid . The photograph was transmitted to Earth earlier this year . * Size : Ida is about 35 miles long , and its moonlet , which some astronomers are calling &quot; Baby Ida , &quot; is about one mile long . * Location : There are more_than 50 # 000 asteroids orbiting in a belt between Mars and Jupiter . Sun-scorched , meteor-pocked , and devoid_of life , they range_in size from a_few feet in diameter to more_than 600 miles across . Often they collide , producing debris that falls to Earth as meteorites . * Significance : NASA scientists hope that their observations of Ida and its moon will help them better understand the formation of the solar_system .</TEXT>
