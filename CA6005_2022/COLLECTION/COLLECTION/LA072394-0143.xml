   <HEADLINE> HOME BUILDING VOTE STIRS GROWTH DEBATE IN VENTURA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time in four years , some developers are expected to get permission Monday to construct homes_in the city of Ventura . The issue of who gets_to build and when has become especially contentious in a town where council elections usually divide between slow-growth and pro-business camps , and where many residents bear sentimental attachments to the open agricultural lands that crisscross the east_side . &quot; This topic touches a central issue in this city , and that is how fast are we going_to grow ? &quot; said Councilman Steve Bennett . &quot; Land use and the rate_of_growth are the driving issues in Ventura politics. &quot; This year ' s housing allocation process is especially difficult because the General Plan allows a maximum of 1 # 018 allocations through 1999 -- but developers want to build about 2 # 600 units . And some council_members , who consider 1 # 018 allocations too many to distribute in one year , would like to hold that number down to a couple hundred allocations annually . Awarding an allocation does not mean a house automatically can be built_on the designated site . Rather , it means the builder can apply for permits to construct the specified number of apartments , condominiums , mobile_homes or houses . The city still gets_to review the development design , a process that can stretch over months or even years . Eleven developers have applied for allocations . Aside from two proposed developments near Ventura Avenue , all_the projects would be built_in the middle or east end of town . The two proposals with the most council support have also excited the most public controversy , turning neighbor against neighbor , inciting threats of a lawsuit in one instance and a possible ballot initiative in the other . * A proposal to build 200 homes , office_buildings , bike paths and a park on Ventura Avenue seemed destined to sail_through the contentious allocations process . But threats of a lawsuit from small property_owners on the site , who did not want their land rezoned from heavy industrial to lighter industrial and commercial uses , persuaded one of the three main development partners to drop_out of the project this week . Even without the Huntsinger family ' s land , the other property_owners involved in the project -- the Neel family and Kinko ' s , the national copy service giant headquartered in the area -- say they still hope to make the deal work_at City_Hall . * Equally controversial is a proposal by developer Ron Hertel to swap his land at Telephone and Kimball roads for a city-owned lemon grove at Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue . To sweeten the deal , Hertel has offered to give the city $ 2 million toward building a regional park on his 94-acre site . Both the city ' s land and Hertel ' s property , however , lie within Ventura ' s agricultural greenbelt -- sites designated to remain farmland until the year 2010 under the General Plan . The deal has pitted local sports enthusiasts against neighbors of the proposed development and greenbelt preservationists . Opponents are circulating petitions for a ballot initiative that would not allow any development in the city ' s greenbelt without approval from the voters . Other proposals include a plan to build 60 apartments at Darling and Wells roads , a project calling_for 467 homes at Telegraph and Hill roads , and a request to construct 227 homes at Telegraph and Kimball roads . Ventura ' s Planning_Commission , meeting to review the proposals last week , recommended awarding allocations to the 60-unit apartment complex , a mobile_home park at Copland Drive and Telephone Road , and a condominium project at Cedar and Kellogg streets , for a total of about 170 allocations . But council_members have shown the most interest so far in single-family home developments , particularly the Neel-Kinko ' s project on the Avenue and the Hertel land swap . City officials expect Monday night ' s meeting to be so heated that they have decided to start it at 6 p.m. , an hour and a half earlier than usual . Sheri Vincent , who devotes about four hours a week to gathering signatures for the greenbelt ballot initiative , said she hopes to pack the council meeting with as_many as 50 people opposing the land swap . &quot; I think sparks are going_to fly , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
