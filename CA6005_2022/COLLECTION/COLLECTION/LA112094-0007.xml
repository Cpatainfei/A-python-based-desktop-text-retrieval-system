   <HEADLINE> THE PEACE THAT NEVER CAME ; FRANCE ' S ACROBATIC SELF-DELUSION KEPT ITS PEOPLE BELIEVING , UNTIL THE VERY LAST MOMENT THAT NOBODY , HITLER INCLUDED , WANTED WAR ; THE HOLLOW YEARS : FRANCE IN THE 1930S , BY EUGEN WEBER ( NORTON : $ 25 ; 352 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eugen Weber ' s new book , &quot; The Hollow Years , &quot; is a pitiless account of France in the 1930s , a decade that , if it is anything but glorious , has nevertheless something inescapably fascinating about it . It offers a painful case study of a society bringing itself almost willingly under a spell . But , however depressing , this story suggests that in France even the most Dostoevskyan tragedies can be made into farcical Offenbachian operettas . The only redeeming episode in these &quot; Hollow Years , &quot; for example , is the Popular Front government ' s implementation of paid vacations . ( The government ' s only successful division , Weber claims , was &quot; Le Ministere des Loisirs , &quot; an expression which , with a particularly American condescension -- Weber is Romanian -- he translates as the Ministry of Idleness. ) That was in 1936 . The French would have fared far better had they spent time thinking_about Hitler and Nazi expansionism rather than about holidays . Roger Caillois , a young sociologist at the time , was struck by the lethal untimeliness of such a concern . In one of the lectures he gave at the College of Sociology , he wondered what could be happening to a civilization whose bottom_line , even on the eve of war in 1939 , was a refusal to mandate an expansion of working hours in plants that were involved in the national defense . ( By the way , the word vacation comes , as one knows , from vacuum : it refers to a kind of hollow time , a time of committed demobilization. ) True , glory and great leaders are no longer the stuff of historians . Following the trend initiated in the ' 30s by the Annales school , to which Eugene Weber pays due homage , historical narration emphasizes contexts , replacing individuals with common_men , events with daily life , proper_names with statistics . However , the absence of great men in &quot; The Hollow Years &quot; is not merely the result of a methodological choice . Did France suffer from having no Hitler , no Lenin or Stalin , no F.D.R. , not even a Mussolini or a Franco ? She clearly , at times , felt that way . The title of Weber ' s book refers , among others , to a dramatic emptiness of the seats of power . It also refers to other vacant zones . 140 # 000 soldiers had died , leaving an equal number of empty ( or half-empty ) beds . France had broken the world_record in widows . Moreover , the war effort had been fed by foreign ( mostly American ) loans whose repayment would mortgage the coming decades , adding a financial vacuum to the demographic one . France thus became dependent_on America for money , and on immigration for manpower . Having been fought , mostly , on French territory , war also caused immense civil destruction . France was exhausted by a victory that was beyond her means . Hence the impatience of the annees folles ( crazy years ) : no sooner was the Versailles treaty drafted , than the_French rushed to celebrate the end of war , not waiting to hear that an accounting error had been made . They never totally believed_in their victory -- and they were right not to . The years that were to end with a phony war started with a phony peace . In a deeper sense , hollowness refers to a lack of direction , a sense of purposelessness . Psychiatrists describe moments where one loses a sense of time . The past , it seems , is still to come , while the future has the discouraging flavor of deja_vu . So , while the reader of &quot; The Hollow Years &quot; is offered a picturesque mix of anecdotes and statistics , one senses , crawling , looming behind , the menacing presence of war . It is everywhere , like the figure in the carpet . But is it behind or in front ? More and more , that became the_French people ' s question . They didn ' t know which way things were moving . Were they moving away from or ahead , toward war ? Was war receding or approaching ? No wonder so many artists of the time were inspired by the theme of the labyrinth , and the legendary figures associated with it , Theseus and the Minotaur . This feeling of a lack of direction was reflected in the way they named their time . For what followed war was not peace but post-war , l ' apres-guerre , which lasted 10 years . And , when the decade closed , 1930 was celebrated as the end of the postwar , &quot; la fin de l ' apre s-guerre. &quot; After war and postwar thus came post-postwar , which , typically , was a way of saying war without saying it . Some French_people might still have thought that they had won the war , none would claim they had won the peace . In fact , by the mid-30s , almost everyone had discovered the period ' s real name , entre-deux-guerres . Like a river in the desert ' s sands , war had gone underground . The hollow years were just a creepy intermission . Eugen Weber draws a parallel between the events of 1939 and those of 1870 , an analogy that allows him to use Emile_Zola ' s novel about the Franco-Prussian war , &quot; La Debacle , &quot; as a refrain in his story of the Third Republic ' s twilight . But the gay Paris of the Second Empire was not obsessed by the war that was to put an end to it . Offenbach did not write , as did a famous employee of the_French Foreign Ministry , Jean Giraudoux , &quot; The Trojan_War Will Not Take Place. &quot; &quot; The Hollow Years &quot; is thus a study of &quot; mentality &quot; that brings_to the fore the paradoxical coexistence in French minds of two statements that should have excluded each other : War is unavoidable ( especially after Hitler ' s rise_to_power ) ; there will always be a way to avoid it . Convinced as the_French were ( and justly so , but who cared ? ) that they deserved peace , they were committed to pretending that what they knew was not true . No wonder Sartre was , at this point , constructing his concept of bad faith . How did they accommodate these two propositions ? During the decade , France ' s mass psychology rested_on an acrobatic system of self-delusion . The concluding chapter of &quot; The Hollow Years &quot; is entitled &quot; The War Nobody Wanted. &quot; There is something miraculous in the way the_French managed to keep believing until the very last moment that , indeed , nobody , Hitler included , wanted war . For the death instinct can manifest itself equally through war and through a refusal of war . In any case , and this is Weber ' s point , it is not enough not to want war for it not to occur . Even worse , pacifism is a clear invitation to war when your next-door neighbor is anything but pacifist himself . Among the misperceptions generated by this desperate longing for peace , the most spectacular is probably the denial of Nazi aggressiveness . The success of Erich Maria Remarque ' s pacifist novel &quot; All Quiet on the Western Front , &quot; one of the best_sellers of the time , was a reassuring screen that allowed its readers to ignore a rather different sort of German voice : &quot; Mein Kampf. &quot; With the Munich crisis , wishful_thinking reached a hallucinatory level . The novelist Jean Giono , for example a militant pacifist , claimed that Hitler had renounced attacking Czechoslovakia not because of the military power of the democracies ( a point nobody would hesitate to grant ) , but because of the street demonstrations staged at_home by German peace-loving people singing &quot; La Marseillaise. &quot; Alexandre Kojeve , soon to be a major player in shaping European policies , claimed that , thanks to the Munich deal , Europe had settled_down , once and for all , for an eternal peace . As for Robert Aron , the ideologue of L ' ordre nouveau , the events reinforced his assuaging Hitler . They should bend over backward , Aron argued , to convince Hitler that he is wrong to be afraid of them , sending the clearest possible message that they in no way constitute a threat for him . Aron also opposed those who justified France ' s humiliation at Munich on the basis that it had prevented a war . No , he replied , it didn ' t prevent anything . Munich was a war , but wars today are won without being fought . War has entered the world of the immaterial , of the conceptual . Such delusions were feeding_on the deep consensus that no war was worth fighting , and especially not the one that was waiting at the gate . A common explanation of the tragic hollowness of French politics during the decade is France ' s two conflicting policies vis-a-vis Germany and war reparations , that of Poincare , intransigently nationalist , punishing , and definitively past-oriented , and that of Briand , more European , constructive , and future-oriented . Eugen Weber ' s picture suggests that the real_number was not two but zero . The French political project of the decade seems to have been a systematic and radical vacating of the seat of decision . The slightest mark of authority in a government , immediately denounced as fascism , resulted in an automatic fall . This perverse and collective fascination with political impotence allows Weber to condemn . Between heroism and laziness , the difference is sometimes minimal . For history is not fate : Men and women are not objects , they are responsible subjects . &quot; The Hollow Years &quot; is an indictment of a society that let history be imposed on it as a fate .</TEXT>
