   <HEADLINE> G-7 JOB SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The job summit is another exercise in futility and casuistry ( March 15 ) . The leaders of the G-7 are crying in their soup about the high unemployment in their respective , heretofore affluent democracies , and yet put_in place mechanisms and incentives in the name of free_trade and global competition that tend to make unemployment and underemployment a structural and long-term , rather than cyclical , phenomenon . The blame is often placed on the victims of unemployment : They are not sufficiently trained , lack of basic skills , too expensive , too_much regulation , too_much taxation , etc . It is difficult to swallow the &quot; lack of training &quot; story when you hear that IBM , Apple , GM , and dozens more Fortune 500 companies lay off hundreds of thousands of workers , most of them highly skilled and college graduates . Does our government propose to retrain them to flip hamburgers ? In this country we have created tax incentives to destroy jobs . Every announcement of a downsizing , merger , restructuring is inevitably followed by a statement of how many workers will be let_go , and of how much it is going_to cost and impact profits for the period : hundreds of millions , billions in some cases . Read : The taxpayer is going_to subsidize the layoffs by sheltering corporate profits . Which , of course , is a double hit since the taxpayer is also paying_for unemployment_compensation and all_the other programs designed by government to fix the problem . A problem that , by its own policies , the government had a major role in creating . MANUEL MORENO La Jolla In Detroit , President Clinton called_on the world ' s leading industrial democracies to embrace the technological changes that are shaking their economies . Whether embraced or not , there are growing concerns that the improvement in technology leads to layoffs . The industrial nations must admit that unemployment , whether 6 % or 16 % , is inevitable when advanced technologies cause substantial reductions in employment . They must move beyond President Clinton ' s symbolism and carefully crafted rhetoric about future benefits generated by technological changes . They must provide jobs for the jobless .
