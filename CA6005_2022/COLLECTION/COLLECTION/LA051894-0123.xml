   <HEADLINE> FED HIKE HELPS STOCKS , BONDS BUT NOT DOLLAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Buyers swarmed in_stock and bond markets Tuesday after the Federal_Reserve_Board took a tough stand against inflation by raising short-term interest_rates again . But the dollar failed to get a lift from the Fed ' s move , suggesting that foreign investors remain wary of U.S. securities . In the stock_market , the Dow Jones industrials , which had been up 12 points just before the Fed ' s afternoon announcement , rocketed to close_up 49.11 points at 3 # 720.61 in active trading . In the bond market , yields tumbled nearly across the board . The 30-year Treasury_bond yield plunged from Monday ' s 7.44 % to 7.26 % . The yield on three-year T-notes sank to 6.26 % from 6.40 % . Just one week ago , the Treasury was forced to pay 6.54 % on new three-year notes . Traders said investors were reacting both to the size of the Fed ' s rate hike -- half a point in the discount_rate , from 3 % to 3.5 % , and half a point in the federal funds rate , from 3.75 % to 4.25 % -- and to the central_bank ' s suggestion that this will be the last increase in short-term rates for a while . &quot; For the time being , the message of the stock and bond markets is that the Fed has hit the bull ' s-eye , &quot; said Hugh Johnson , market_strategist at First Albany Corp . &quot; The Fed administered medicine strong enough to kill_off worries about inflation but not harsh enough to hamper growth in the economy and corporate earnings. &quot; The Fed said the economy is now close to the &quot; neutral point &quot; that central bankers had been seeking -- the point at which interest_rates are neither spurring economic_growth nor retarding it . Analysts said they were impressed with the magnitude of the rally in_stocks and bonds , but many also cautioned that both markets remain vulnerable . Investors who failed to sell_out as stock and bond prices dove in recent months may take the opportunity to trim their portfolios as prices rebound , some experts say . That could restrain any rallies . Nonetheless , the strength in some interest-rate-sensitive stock groups Tuesday indicated that Wall_Street believes rates have peaked for now , analysts said . That message was also apparent in bonds ' rally , experts said : Yields on long-term mortgage and muni bonds plummeted with T-bond yields , as investors rushed to lock_in current high returns . But in currency markets , the dollar lost ground despite the Fed ' s move . Ordinarily , higher short-term rates should bolster the dollar by attracting more foreign investment to short-term U.S. securities . In New York , the dollar eased to 1.673 German marks from 1.674 on Monday . It also slipped to 104.45 Japanese yen from 104.75. Many foreign investors believe U.S. rates remain less attractive than those offered by Germany or Japan after adjusting for inflation , some currency traders said . In the stock_market , meanwhile , buyers focused_on banking , utility and insurance stocks , all_of which should perform better if market interest_rates stop rising . Among the market highlights : * Winners topped losers by 13 to 8 on the NYSE on active volume of 312 million shares . But broad market indexes were weaker than the blue_chip Dow . The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks fell 0.39 point to 711.52 , though it had been down more_than 6 points at midday . Losers edged winners 14 to 12 on Nasdaq . * In the Dow , some industrial names rose on new hopes for stable economic_growth . Alcoa gained 2 1 / 8 to 70 1 / 2 , Bethlehem Steel added 1 1 / 4 to 18 1 / 8 , IBM jumped 2 3 / 4 to 61 1 / 4 and GM was up 1 3 / 8 to 54 3 / 8 . * Bank stocks jumped , helped in part by bankers ' decision Tuesday to hike the prime lending rate to 7.25 % from 6.25 % . That will help offset banks ' higher cost of funds because of the Fed rate hike . Among major banks , Citicorp soared 1 3 / 4 to 38 7 / 8 , First Interstate surged 1 5 / 8 to 82 3 / 8 , BankAmerica gained 1 7 / 8 to 48 3 / 8 , Wells Fargo jumped 2 1 / 8 to 146 7 / 8 and NationsBank gained 1 1 / 8 to 54 1 / 2 . * In the utility group , Detroit Edison added 5 / 8 to 25 , Pacific Gas &amp; Electric gained 3 / 4 to 24 1 / 4 , Bell Atlantic leaped 1 5 / 8 to 52 7 / 8 and U.S. West jumped 1 1 / 4 to 40 1 / 4 . * On the downside , many tech stocks weakened again . Lotus Development plunged 3 7 / 8 to 52 on rumors about swelling software inventories , and computer chip maker Xilinx sank 7 to 39 1 / 2 on fears about slowing growth . Overseas , markets were mixed ahead of the Fed ' s meeting . London ' s FTSE-100 index added 7.9 points to 3 # 123.5 , while Frankfurt ' s DAX index eased 11.40 points to 2 # 259.71. In Tokyo , the Nikkei index fell 54.91 points to 20 # 133.53. But Toronto and Mexico_City stocks rallied with U.S. shares after the Fed made its move . Toronto ' s TSE-300 index jumped 60.87 points to 4 # 269.15 , while Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index gained 48.75 points to 2 # 288.59. Early today in Hong Kong the Hang Seng index jumped 328.29 points to 9 # 372.99 , buoyed by Wall_Street ' s gains . In commodity markets , oil , gold and coffee prices fell , and commodities in_general rested after Monday ' s surge .</TEXT>
