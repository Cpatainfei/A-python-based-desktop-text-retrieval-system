   <TEXT> At dawn one July morning in 1984 , Weston J . Naef disembarked from a cargo plane in a remote area of LAX . His 10-year-old son , Edward , was at his side , and thousands of the best photographs in the world were still in crates on board . Their arrival marked the final chapter in an art world thriller that began just the year before , when J . Paul Getty Museum Director John Walsh learned that at least three major private photography collections might soon be for_sale . He saw the potential for a world-class museum collection , and he urged the Getty board to act . The board did . New York art_dealer Daniel Wolf circled the globe for the Getty , methodically acquiring the most important photographs money could buy . He purchased all or substantial portions of the fabled collections of Americans Samuel Wagstaff and Arnold Crane and of Andre and Marie-Therese Jammes in France . Photographs poured in from other top collections in France , Germany , Switzerland and elsewhere . &quot; By being able to move very quickly and quietly , we were able to make an extraordinarily favorable deal , &quot; Walsh says . &quot; We were able to get the whole works for less than the price of a moderately good Cezanne still life. &quot; The Getty instantly became one of the world ' s great repositories for photography . And Naef , the man who had been offstage advising Wolf and the Getty on what to buy , was hired to oversee and expand the Getty ' s riches . Naef was also a widely known figure in the world of photography . While still serving as a curator of prints and photographs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , where he had worked for nearly 15 years , he helped the Getty evaluate possible photography purchases and suggested additional ones . Then , anticipating that the Getty would prove successful in its quest , he left one of the world ' s most important museums and headed west to an institution whose reputation was then based primarily on its enormous endowment . &quot; That challenge was one that I could not resist , &quot; says Naef , today the Getty ' s curator of photographs . &quot; It offered the promise of building one of the greatest collections of photographs that may ever be created. &quot; Energetic , intense and very , very determined , the 52-year-old Naef has continued amassing treasures in the only Getty department that regularly collects 20th-Century art . Starting with the initial acquisition of 18 # 000 photographs , he has built the collection to more_than 25 # 500 , with thousands more mounted in albums and on cards and other media . Sometimes it has been a matter of adding_to strong areas of the collection such_as 19th-Century French photographs , Walsh says ; sometimes Naef has focused_on weaker areas , such_as classic American modernists . As he puts it : &quot; We started with a great base and persisted -- searching , hunting and gathering the very best that complements the existing collection or fills gaps. &quot; One such gap was work by Frederick Sommer , an 89-year-old Prescott , Ariz. , photographer whose evocative images are currently on view at the Malibu museum . Although art experts have long appreciated Sommer ' s work , he has not been as widely known as less reclusive , more prolific contemporaries . Just one Sommer photograph was among the Getty ' s original purchases , so last summer , after three years of effort , the museum made a major purchase of Sommer ' s work . Naef had first met with the artist ' s New York dealer , then repeatedly visited the artist ' s Arizona studio , talking with the artist and his assistants . By last spring , Naef had selected 107 photographs for the Getty to buy . &quot; Sommer ' s work is just extremely rare and it trickles onto the market , &quot; Walsh says . &quot; I was just floored when it was possible for Weston to come_up with an agreement. &quot; * Naef may look_like a scholar in the tweedy clothes and bow_ties that belie his Palm Springs upbringing , but he clearly knows how to forage . &quot; Weston is a dauntless unearther of treasures , &quot; says Robert A . Sobieszek , curator of photography at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . &quot; He ' s got the dough and knows how to negotiate. &quot; The Getty photography collection today is obviously worth considerably more_than the $ 20 million estimated as its initial value . ( The Getty won ' t disclose such information. ) Its annual acquisitions budget is reportedly $ 1 million to $ 2 million . By comparison , LACMA curator Sobieszek says that after the current fund-raising_drive , he expects his annual photo acquisitions budget to be $ 150 # 000 to $ 200 # 000 . But dealers here and elsewhere say that , despite its resources , the Getty hasn ' t tipped the marketplace out of balance . &quot; They ' ve been amazingly responsible when you consider the amount_of_money they have , &quot; says Los Angeles photography dealer G . Ray Hawkins . &quot; While they will pay top price for something they desperately want , they won ' t overpay for it . &quot; They ' ll wait until the price fits_in with their idea of_value . Even though ( a photo ) may go_to a collector or another institution , the sense of certainty that they will get_it offered to them again in the next millennium gives them the freedom to say no. &quot; Consider , for instance , Naef ' s acquisition of almost 100 Alfred Stieglitz photographs purchased from artist Georgia O ' Keeffe ' s estate between the time of her death in 1986 and September , 1992 , the close of a Getty show of Stieglitz ' s photos of O ' Keeffe . Most curators buy art before they show it , and dealer Hawkins says that Naef ' s willingness to wait displays an underlying conservatism . &quot; He didn ' t commit to purchasing until he gave himself time to curate his ideal show , frame it , install it and live with it. &quot; Another time , Naef went_to Walsh teary-eyed , describing a Stieglitz photograph he would buy if the money were available . ( Naef recalls that the photograph , &quot; Hands Sewing , &quot; went at auction for $ 400 # 000 in 1993. ) &quot; Even we don ' t have the money for everything , &quot; Walsh says . &quot; Weston is constantly moving the pots from the front to the back burner , turning_down the gas , and hoping to keep a patient collector on simmer ( without ) the flame going_out . He ' s like a cook , and the kitchen ' s hot. &quot; Naef enjoys the heat , Walsh says . When they both worked_at the Metropolitan Museum , &quot; I ' d get_into an elevator , and there would be Weston with a short old_man with a beret , and he ' d say , ' Oh , John , I ' d like you to meet Andre Kertesz. ' &quot; The Sommer exhibition , which opened Tuesday , is just the Getty ' s third of a living artist . ( The others presented the work of Manuel Alvarez Bravo and Edmund Teske. ) &quot; We put more money into work of people who aren ' t making any more , &quot; Walsh says . &quot; It ' s a question of where we ' re best off putting the money . And across the board at the Getty , we ' re still looking_for the endangered species . We figure the others will still be around. &quot; The Getty ' s initial foray_into photography actually began with such concerns . &quot; Starting as late in the day as we were starting , &quot; Walsh says , &quot; we were looking_for areas in which the Getty could do something really distinctive without preempting the place of some_other Los Angeles institution. &quot; Walsh next turned_to Naef , someone he had known since Naef first went_to work for Walsh at the Met as a college intern . &quot; I admired ( Naef ' s ) collecting and exhibitions , &quot; Walsh says . &quot; I got his advice on formation of this new collection , and then I got him to make a career change. &quot; About 2 # 000 photographers are represented in the Getty collection , but Naef has focused_on the work of about 24 masters . He calls such artists as Stieglitz and Walker Evans &quot; creative geniuses &quot; and seeks with each &quot; a panorama &quot; of work . The Getty buys individual photographs , of course , but it often makes larger purchases of photo groups that place those masterworks in context . &quot; It is a superb collection , &quot; says Peter Galassi , chief curator of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art in New York . &quot; It is notable for its range and diversity and for great depth of such holdings as August Sander , Man Ray and Walker Evans , where they have pictures in very significant quantity as well as quality. &quot; Many of those photographs have been shown in the 35 exhibitions Naef and his staff have organized since 1986 . The department ' s small gallery located near the Impressionist paintings has also presented shows of such individual artists as Edward Weston and Alexander Rodchenko , early French and Egyptian photos and several shows on experimental photography . Although the collections have long been available to scholars and curators , the general public will soon be able to get_to know them better . Late next month , the UCLA / Armand Hammer Museum of Art will open a major exhibition of Getty photography holdings , and due out_in early spring is a handbook of the collection , the first to document its scope and size . Naef , who will curate the Hammer exhibition , also wrote the handbook , and his office reflects the many demands on his time . A testimonial to his motto that &quot; More is more , &quot; no desk or shelf space is visible in the modest office . Every surface , from the floor to his Stickley chairs and table , is covered with papers , photographic_materials , books or other possessions . Naef ' s shows , like the collection itself , have spanned photographic history , styles , attitudes and artists . He even refers to the exhibitions as his metaphoric children , calling them the &quot; fulfillment of personal dreams &quot; realized by both himself and his colleagues . The dreamers aren ' t always the dozen or so staff people Naef supervises either . Producer-screenwriter and collector Michael G . Wilson ( best known for his James Bond films ) guest-curated a recent Getty show on Northern California pictorialism , for instance . Jackie Napolean Wilson , a Detroit attorney whose grandfather was a slave and who collects photography about the life of African Americans in the 1850s and 1860s , will curate a show called &quot; Hidden Witness &quot; at the Getty in February . &quot; Hidden Witness &quot; provides the Getty an opportunity to show 25 rare pieces in the collection , Naef says , and the museum occasionally also collaborates on exhibitions with local museums to maximize impact . The pictorialism show , for instance , was done_in collaboration with a companion show in the Virginia Steele Scott Gallery at the Huntington Library in San Marino . Naef says that each year the Getty lends to a dozen or more institutions from New York to Paris and Tokyo . &quot; It would be hard to think_of major historical photography exhibitions to which the Getty has not lent , &quot; the Museum of Modern Art ' s Galassi says . &quot; They ' ve done wonderful small exhibitions in the space they have , but one way the richness of the collection is known is through their loans. &quot; Access will also increase with the Getty ' s newly ambitious publications program . Naef says he has studiously avoided coffee table-size books , believing that there are already too many available , and he has recently begun an &quot; In Focus &quot; series of small &quot; serviceable books. &quot; Reception has been good , he says , to their first &quot; In Focus &quot; book , on Kertesz , and the Getty plans books tied to coming exhibitions of Stieglitz , Laszlo Moholy-Nagy , Doris Ulmann and others . The Getty hopes to publish 10 &quot; In Focus &quot; books by the time it moves_in 1997 to the Getty facility currently under construction in Brentwood , and the museum also plans a major book on Walker Evans for late next year . It was written by Getty associate curator Judy Keller and documents the museum ' s 1 # 200 Evans photographs , the largest public collection of the artist ' s work . The photography department ' s final show at the Malibu museum site will be work by Englishwoman Julia Margaret Cameron , also the subject of the department ' s first show , and Naef expects to inaugurate its space at the new Getty facility with a Walker Evans show . Besides two galleries for changing exhibitions , Naef will have a small gallery for selections from the permanent collection and an occasional turn at a general exhibition gallery . But he warns against expecting many blockbuster photography shows . &quot; We ' ve found between 50 and 100 pictures seems to be a very satisfying number to bring_together , &quot; Naef says . &quot; We will stay deliberately small . We want ( exhibitions ) to be contained and focused in_order to have our visitors leave with a taste for more. &quot; * &quot; Frederick Sommer : Poetry and Logic , &quot; J .
