   <HEADLINE> RED , WHITE AND REWARDING ; O.C. RED_CROSS VOLUNTEERS ARE AIDING NORTHRIDGE QUAKE VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The powerful aftershock ripped through the temporary Red_Cross shelter here , sending hundreds of terrified earthquake refugees bolting for the door . Carol Beuschlein , a 20-year Red_Cross veteran from Westminster , heard a shelter worker yell , &quot; Cut them off at the pass. &quot; Calmly surveying the panic around her , Beuschlein began to circulate among the mostly Spanish-speaking evacuees , reassuring them that there was no danger of the building collapsing . &quot; We wanted to keep the people in , because we were afraid that they would break_through the glass door , &quot; Beuschlein said Thursday , recounting the incident that occurred just two days after the devastating Northridge quake . &quot; I found a little_girl who I nicknamed ' Mickey ' because she was wearing a Mickey_Mouse shirt , to translate and tell people that everything was OK. &quot; Beuschlein , a 37-year-old former ambulance driver , is among the dozens of Red_Cross volunteers dispatched from Orange County to operate one of the busiest earthquake shelters in the Los Angeles area . While relief operations were at their peak , the volunteers typically logged 12- and 14-hour shifts . Some even gave_up their vacations so they could get the time_off from work . &quot; The day of the quake , I called the Orange County chapter and they said they needed me , &quot; said Tom Sipe , 37 , an operations coordinator at John Wayne Airport . &quot; I walked into work and told them I needed to go and they said it was OK as long as I took vacation time. &quot; Sipe has worked as an assistant to shelter manager John Kulla , a 31-year-old chef from Anaheim , since the day after the quake . When Sipe ' s shift ends , he spends the night at a Los Angeles-area hotel until it is time for him to return to his shelter duties the next day . &quot; A vacation is for doing something you like to do , and to me that means helping others , &quot; Sipe said . &quot; Even if I couldn ' t have gotten the time_off , I would have come_out here and worked_on the weekends. &quot; Under the Red_Cross policy of mutual_aid , whenever a major disaster becomes more_than a local chapter can handle , volunteers are sent from all_over the country . Volunteers have come from as far away as Colorado and Louisiana to help Northridge quake victims , their red and white emergency vehicles packed with first-aid_kits and other supplies . * But the San Fernando Recreation Center_on Park_Avenue , now converted into an evacuation site , is operated almost entirely by Orange County volunteers -- many of whom began arriving just hours after the quake . Like Beuschlein , many believe it was only God ' s will -- or sheer luck -- that kept the disaster from striking closer to home . Now they feel it is their duty to help those who found themselves homeless simply because of the accident of geography . For the volunteers , it has been a rewarding , albeit exhausting , experience . On one night last week , more_than 1 # 100 evacuees were at the shelter , sleeping on cots inside the gym . More_than two_dozen Orange County residents have worked_at this site , which was &quot; adopted &quot; by the county ' s Red_Cross . In one day alone last week , volunteers served 4 # 000 meals . They struggled to maintain order amid a sea of shattered nerves , monitoring the distribution of drinking_water , blankets and toys for the children . They provided a sympathetic shoulder for people who had lost loved ones and had nowhere else to turn . &quot; This guy came_in one day last week and his girlfriend had been killed in the apartment_building in Northridge , &quot; said Muriel Bagley , a volunteer from Huntington Beach . &quot; He just kept saying , ' I have to keep busy , I have to keep busy. ' I talked to him for a little while . It ' s just so sad , it makes you want to cry. &quot; On Thursday , nearly 300 people who had spent the night -- afraid or unable to return to their homes -- bombarded shelter volunteers with requests for assistance . &quot; Do you have anything to eat ? &quot; &quot; Can you tell me where the FEMA office is ? &quot; &quot; Do you have any teddy_bears left for my children ? &quot; Inside a converted gymnasium overflowing with cots where many had spent the previous night , families huddled_together in small groups . Others crowded in front of a small television_set , while countless other weary , disheveled evacuees lined_up to collect their lunch ration of corned_beef hash , peaches , bread and soft_drinks . The greatest responsibility has fallen on Kulla ' s shoulders . As shelter manager , it is he who must order the food and other provisions and enforce the shelter rules . Kulla , another longtime Red_Cross volunteer , first joined up in his native Spain and has worked major disasters from hurricanes in Europe to the earthquake in Mexico . &quot; So it didn ' t hit Orange County this time . But it could have , &quot; Kulla said , explaining his reasons for becoming a volunteer . &quot; And if it did , they ' d be doing this for us instead of the other way around. &quot;</TEXT>
