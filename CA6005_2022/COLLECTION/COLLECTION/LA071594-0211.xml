   <HEADLINE> CLINTON_ADMINISTRATION FORESEES NO RECESSION ; ECONOMY : UPBEAT MIDYEAR REPORT STICKS WITH EARLIER PREDICTIONS OF CONTINUED MODEST GROWTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rapidly rising interest_rates and the international collapse of the U.S. dollar will not lead to another recession , the Clinton_Administration predicted Thursday . White_House officials , in an upbeat midyear report on the state of the nation ' s economy , said the Administration will stick_with its earlier predictions of continued modest growth throughout the remainder of President Clinton ' s term . However , the White_House did not attempt to break_down its economic forecast by region , so offered no predictions about the outlook for areas of the country such_as Southern California that are still struggling . The White_House said interest_rate increases will dampen growth somewhat by 1996 but not significantly , and that effect will be offset by strong job growth and increases in business investment . U.S. exports , which are now rising at double the rate of those of other industrial nations , will continue to boost the economy , largely because of America ' s improved international competitive position . Laura D ' Andrea Tyson , chairwoman of the White_House Council of Economic Advisers , said the Administration still believes the economy will grow by 3 % this year -- the same rate it predicted in its last official forecast in January . The Administration said it does not believe the economy can sustain its 3.4 % first-half pace during the last six months of the year , but it also said it does not believe that the rapid rise in interest_rates over the past few months will lead to big drops_in employment or growth . Officials made only slight reductions in growth estimates , trimming the Administration forecast by 0.1 % for each of the years 1996 , 1997 , 1998 and 1999 . The White_House sought to use the mid-session budget and economic review as a forum to provide an 18-month &quot; report_card &quot; on Clinton ' s handling of the economy . A series of Administration officials , armed with full-color charts and graphs , each credited the Clinton economic plan of 1993 for bringing_about the turnaround . Indeed , for an Administration sorely in need of good news , the economic figures seemed to provide welcome relief . &quot; The 1992 election hinged_on one major issue , and that was the economy , so I ' m here with charts to give you the report_card , &quot; Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said at a White_House briefing . &quot; By any standard , this economy is doing_well , and we ' re doing_it with inflation under control. &quot; Bentsen , just back from an economic meeting in Naples , Italy , added that the U.S. economy is now growing faster than that of any other major industrial nation . &quot; We are confident of our forecast because the foundations for a period of moderate growth with low inflation and rising incomes are stronger now than they ' ve been in a generation , &quot; said Tyson . Despite fears on Wall_Street of a surge in inflation -- fears that have put almost constant upward pressure on interest_rates since February -- the Administration ' s new forecast calls_for inflation at the consumer level to rise only gradually to 3.2 % next year and to peak at 3.4 % by 1997 . Administration officials said they believe the best news , however , is_on the job front . Since Clinton entered office , they said , 3.8 million jobs have been created . That puts him ahead of his campaign pledge to create 8 million jobs in four years .</TEXT>
