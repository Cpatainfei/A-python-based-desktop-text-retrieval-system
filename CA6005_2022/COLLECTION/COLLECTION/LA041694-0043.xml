   <HEADLINE> ASTRONAUTS USE RADAR TO STUDY FLOODING IN MIDWEST , GERMANY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> NASA pushed Endeavour ' s advanced , new radar to the limit Friday in an attempt to survey flooding_in the Midwest and in Germany . Scientists managing the radar equipment aboard the shuttle had not planned on mapping those areas until the floods struck this week.Any information gleaned about the terrain and overflowing rivers , while of no immediate use , could help in predicting the course of future flooding , project scientist Diane Evans said . &quot; Radar is really the ideal sensor because of the cloud_cover associated with the thunderstorms that are being seen , &quot; Evans said . Astronaut Michael Clifford reported &quot; tremendous &quot; lightning over the Midwest as Endeavour soared across the central United States at an altitude of 135 miles . Evans said researchers are not sure if the radar can reach the flooded areas from Endeavour ' s orbit as the shuttle passes_over Oklahoma , but are trying anyhow . Radar sweeps_over northern_Europe also are being extended_to try to include overflowing rivers in eastern Germany . The radar in Endeavour ' s cargo bay is the most advanced ever sent into space by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . The U.S. , German and Italian radar instruments have been scanning Earth ' s environmental hot spots since the mission began last Saturday . The mission is expected to end Tuesday . By Friday , 93 of the 183 radar data-recording tapes aboard the shuttle had been filled , representing nearly 50 hours of information , NASA officials said . &quot; It ' s very rewarding to see that our experiment is going so well and that we ' re really bringing_back the information about our environment that we came_to get , &quot; astronaut Thomas Jones told high_school honor students during the &quot; CBS This Morning &quot; program .</TEXT>
