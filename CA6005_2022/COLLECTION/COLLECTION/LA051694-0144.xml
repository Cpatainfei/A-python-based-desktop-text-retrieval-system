   <HEADLINE> DEATHS PROMPT SHIFTS IN POLICE USE OF HOGTYING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Law_enforcement policies on hogtying combative suspects are being challenged and in many cases revamped across Los Angeles County after a series of recent deaths partly linked to the tactic and mounting medical evidence of its potentially lethal effects . In the year since controversy erupted over the death of a Pasadena barber who had been hogtied by police , records show that three additional , little-noticed deaths in police custody have been partially attributed to the effects of hogtying -- or hobbling , in police parlance . The cases have fueled potentially costly wrongful death claims and a flurry of policy_changes by police and paramedics , ranging from minor tinkering to an outright ban . Typically used when officers confront violent or drug-intoxicated suspects acting bizarrely , hogtying immobilizes an arrestee by attaching the ankles to cuffed hands behind the back using a cord or strap . Some agencies , such_as the LAPD , see it as an effective tool on the streets . But others , including the New York Police_Department , banned it years ago and use padded Velcro strips to restrain suspects . By some accounts , hogtying gained favor in Los Angeles in the 1980s when officers found themselves increasingly confronting PCP users exhibiting superhuman strength . But Hubert Williams , a former New Jersey police_chief and now president of the Washington , D.C.-based Police Foundation , said &quot; most departments don ' t use hogtying. &quot; It appears to be more common in the West , he said . Still , the tactic has largely escaped serious study as researchers have focused_on what they considered more lethal police practices , he said . &quot; It is an area that really cries_out_for more serious attention , &quot; he said . One reason for the newly heightened scrutiny locally is that medical_examiners , influenced by recent West Coast studies , are increasingly citing hogtying and its effects as a contributing cause of death in police custody_cases . Researchers have found that hogtying , particularly when excited or obese suspects are placed on their stomachs , can interfere with their ability to breathe and can be deadly . &quot; Because of the growing awareness . . . our doctors are looking_at this very critically , &quot; said Scott Carrier , spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner ' s office . A review of five years of police custody deaths in the county by The Times in early 1993 , after the death of the Pasadena barber , Michael James Bryant , found that restraint tactics were cited as a contributing cause in just five cases . By contrast , in just nine months since that period , hogtying or its effects have been cited as a contributing factor_in at least four deaths . The first direct links between hogtying and sudden_deaths in police custody were made in a 1992 study co-authored by Seattle area coroner Donald Reay . A broader study by Ventura County coroner Ronald O ' Halloran , published in December , further documented the risk and suggested that it would be &quot; both humane and prudent to develop some safer means of control and protection. &quot; Still , officials stress , circumstances vary widely in such cases , and it is often near impossible to say conclusively that a person would not have died without the hogtying . &quot; It ' s not black_and_white , &quot; said Carrier . With understanding of the dangers still evolving -- and some police officials saying alternatives for dealing with violent , often drug-intoxicated suspects are limited -- city representatives maintain that they are addressing the issue appropriately . &quot; Obviously , we are learning , &quot; said attorney Bruce Praet , whose law_firm represents dozens of police agencies in Southern California . &quot; ( But ) it ' s not like the bad_guys are taking a break while we test these things . There obviously is a need to prevent people from kicking officers , nurses , ( paramedics ) and kicking the windows out of patrol cars. &quot; The deaths are providing ammunition to watchdog groups for a full assault on the practice , reminiscent_of earlier controversies over use of chokeholds , which eventually were banned by the LAPD and other agencies . &quot; We really intend to go_after the use of the hogtying , &quot; said John Burton , a board_member of a group called Police Watch and an attorney representing the family of a 30-year-old man who died in September after being hogtied by Bell Gardens police . Burton says law_enforcement is &quot; acting completely irresponsibly to allow these death cases to mount . Hogtying someone is barbaric . It really has no place in a society that gets sanctimonious about someone getting caned in Singapore. &quot; Recent modifications of hobbling policies may raise additional safety questions , records and interviews show . For example , the LAPD revised its policy in late 1992 , after medical studies first pointed to the potential dangers and a jury awarded $ 1.1 million to the parents of a man who died after being hogtied . The new policy requires hogtied suspects to be kept_on their side , which is considered safer , although they still may be transported while hobbled in the back seat of patrol_car . &quot; I don ' t think you should transport them in that mode , &quot; said Reay , the Seattle coroner who did pioneering research on the issue . &quot; I think that ' s dangerous. &quot; The LAPD also appears to allow tighter cinching of the behind-the-back restraint during transport than some_other agencies , including the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department , which also has revamped its policies . &quot; It ' s not designed to be torture , &quot; said LAPD Lt . John Dunkin . &quot; ( But ) if they still are able to flex and unflex their knees , then you would n ' t have obtained the desired result . . . preventing them from kicking about. &quot; Dunkin added that the procedure is under continuing review . The Sheriff ' s Department policy , amended after the Bryant case , requires arrestees to be transported sitting upright in a patrol_car . Legs are secured by a strap , which can be held_in place by closing the patrol_car door on it . Those who must be transported lying_down are required to travel_by ambulance , strapped to a gurney on their side . But questions now are arising about the modified versions of the restraint . The Sheriff ' s Department is examining what role the revised hobble may have played in the January death of an Azusa man . The coroner ' s office ruled the death a homicide caused by the combined effects of drug intoxication and various restraint procedures used by deputies , including the hobble . According to the department ' s account of the incident , deputies followed the new procedures and kept the man on his side . The ongoing review is looking &quot; at different ( arrestee ) positions using the hobble ( and whether ) we need to change the position of the hobble itself , &quot; said Sgt . Gilbert Aguilar , who works_on training issues involving field deputies . &quot; We have to reduce the risks being experienced out there with sudden death. &quot; Pasadena recently banned hogtying altogether . As practices and policies shift , there are potentially large financial stakes for taxpayers . &quot; Once we identify something as a hazard . . . there are great risks ( in ) terms of the amount_of_money hanging_out there in liability , &quot; Reay said . Indeed , wrongful death claims and lawsuits have been filed by relatives of Bryant , the Pasadena barber , and three other men who died in the recent cases linked to hobbling . In March , 1993 , Bryant led police on a multi-city chase that ended in Highland Park . He died after being hogtied by LAPD officers and placed on his stomach in the back seat of a San Marino patrol_car . The cause of death was ruled to be cocaine intoxication and asphyxia related to the restraint procedures . Two months and two days later , after considerable publicity about the effects of hogtying in the Bryant case , records show that 35-year-old Richard Coleman died near Hollywood after being hobbled by LAPD officers . Coleman had been acting bizarrely in the middle of Sunset Boulevard , banging his head on the pavement , according to official accounts . Officers struggled with and hogtied him , but kept him on his side , a district_attorney ' s investigation found . However , Coleman later was hoisted onto a gurney and strapped face-down when paramedics arrived . He went_into cardiac_arrest on the way to the hospital , investigators found . Coleman ' s death was ruled a homicide because of the combined effects of methamphetamine intoxication and the restraint maneuvers used . While investigations by the LAPD , the Fire_Department and the district_attorney ' s office found no wrongdoing on the part of officers or paramedics , Coleman ' s father is not satisfied . &quot; I ' m very , very uncomfortable with it , &quot; said Robert Coleman , 64 . &quot; I think they just mishandled him after they hogtied him . . . . that ' s what we feel cost him his life. &quot; His son , a once successful salesman and father of two children , had struggled with drug problems off and on , said Coleman , an Army retiree . &quot; I ' m not disputing that ; not trying to make excuses for him . ( But ) I don ' t care what his problems were . Misuse ( of force ) by authorities under any conditions is not appropriate. &quot; The family has filed a multimillion-dollar wrongful death claim against the city . A remarkably similar scenario unfolded four months later in Bell Gardens , where Phillip Vogel was hogtied by police and strapped face-down on an ambulance gurney . Vogel , a house_painter and aspiring musician , was found riding his bicycle in and out of traffic on Gage Avenue one afternoon last September , according to police accounts . After struggling and spitting blood at police , Vogel was hogtied and continued struggling , according to police reports . Los Angeles County Fire_Department paramedics were summoned , checked Vogel and approved him for transport to County-USC Medical_Center , police reports show . Officers and ambulance attendants strapped Vogel face-down on a gurney . Officers questioned maintaining the restraints , according to police reports , but deferred to the ambulance attendants , who requested that Vogel remain hogtied and strapped down . Vogel went_into cardiac_arrest on the way to the hospital and was pronounced dead a short time later . Police officials refused to discuss details of the arrest , particularly how Vogel was positioned by police , citing pending litigation by Vogel ' s relatives . A district_attorney ' s office investigation is continuing , but Bell Gardens officials said no officers violated policy . The coroner ' s office ruled Vogel ' s death a homicide , with the immediate cause asphyxiation related to the effects of hogtying . Multiple drug intoxication was a contributing factor . &quot; I think that they had him in the hogtie too damn long , &quot; said Vogel ' s sister , Suanne Garcia . Vogel had been arrested in drug-related incidents before and &quot; had drugs in his body that day , &quot; she said . &quot; But he did not deserve to die for that . &quot; He had a job . He had hopes and dreams , &quot; she said . In the most recent case , Los Angeles County sheriff ' s deputies answered a 911 call_in Azusa in January and confronted 25-year-old Daniel Gizowski . A parolee just out of prison after serving time for narcotics sales , Gizowski was causing a disturbance at a female friend ' s house and yelling incoherently when deputies arrived , the department says . Deputies used pepper spray and a Taser gun with no effect , said Deputy Patrick Hauser , a department spokesman . Several deputies , some of whom were bitten and injured , swarmed Gizowski and applied a hobble restraint . &quot; He was specifically placed on his side &quot; and was only on his stomach &quot; during the time he was being placed in restraint , &quot; Hauser said . After being moved to the back_porch , Gizowski began showing signs of shortness of breath . Deputies performed CPR while awaiting arrival of paramedics , but he was later pronounced dead at a local hospital , Hauser said . The coroner ruled the case a homicide , saying Gizowski died of a combination of methamphetamine intoxication and asphyxia related to forcible restraint procedures , including a neck hold and hobble . The Sheriff ' s Department says the deputies followed a revised , presumably safer hobbling policy that had been adopted in June , 1993 , after the Bryant death . It requires looser hobble binding , keeping suspects on their side and constant monitoring for breathing difficulties . Roger Diamond , the attorney for the Gizowski family , said he is investigating the sheriff ' s hobbling and restraint procedures . &quot; It ' s amazing . . . the L.A. County coroner is willing to go this far , &quot; he said , referring to the autopsy findings . He said it raises the prospect that the department &quot; might be utilizing a procedure that itself is defective . If it is flawed , the county should recognize that right away so it doesn ' t happen again. &quot; Aguilar , the sheriff ' s training specialist , said the department believes it has selected the best option currently available , and is continuing to examine alternatives . &quot; We can only deal with what . . . we have right now , &quot; he said . &quot; I do not believe that ( we ) want to take anything away that would put deputies at risk . . . and not give them something in its place. &quot; The string of cases has highlighted the widely varying , sometimes loosely coordinated changes in policy that have emerged in the past 18 months . In October , 1992 , when the LAPD amended its hobble restraint policy , it spelled_out the risks . &quot; Recent medical evidence suggests that use of the cord-cuff leg restrainer ( on certain arrestees ) can result in serious injury or death , &quot; the policy noted . Officers were instructed to ensure that hogtied suspects remained on their side and were monitored closely . But it was unclear in the Bryant case how many LAPD officers at the scene actually knew of the department ' s revised policy . Three months after Bryant ' s death , the LAPD reissued a departmentwide bulletin on the procedures . The revisions apparently were not immediately communicated to Los Angeles paramedics , who frequently work with LAPD officers in transporting hogtied suspects . It was not until a month after Coleman ' s death -- and nearly seven months after the city Police_Department modified its policy -- that the paramedics were prohibited from strapping hogtied patients face-down on gurneys . Fire Capt . Dave Thompson , assistant bureau commander of medical services , said he could not account_for the delay , although he said that the LAPD apparently had not advised the Fire_Department of its concerns and that the medical risks had not been noted in paramedic literature . It was not until December -- three months after Vogel ' s death -- that Bell Gardens police adopted a new policy that requires hobbled suspects to be kept_on their side and transported only in a seated position in patrol_cars , a department spokesman said . And it was only in the past few weeks -- nearly a year after the Sheriff ' s Department revised its policy to reduce risks -- that the county Fire_Department issued guidelines to paramedics to ensure that hobbled patients are not allowed to rest_on their stomachs . &quot; It ' s something we ' re just moving_into , &quot; said Battalion Chief Ed Thacher . &quot; I don ' t know if they have that much medical information out there that says conclusively this is better than that . I don ' t think there ' s been enough study yet to show if ( someone ) comes_in on his side , he won ' t come_in dead. &quot; Critics contend that the issue simply hasn ' t been a high priority for police and other agencies . &quot; The fact is they don ' t understand they ' re doing this to people , or they don ' t care , &quot; said attorney Burton . &quot; It just seems impossible to me there ' s no way of restraining these people without killing them. &quot; Hogtying Controversy A controversy over hogtying of violent suspects by law_enforcement officers is heating_up amid growing medical evidence that the practice can interfere with breathing and contribute to sudden_deaths . Here is a look_at the Los Angeles County coroner ' s office findings in four recent cases that were ruled homicides , partly because of the effects of hogtying restraint procedures . Name : Michael James Bryant Case : In March , 1993 , the Pasadena barber died from a combination of cocaine intoxication and asphyxia after being hogtied by LAPD officers and placed face-down in the rear seat of a patrol_car . Name : Richard Coleman Case : In May , 1993 , the salesman died of a combination of methamphetamine intoxication and asphyxia after being hogtied by LAPD officers and later strapped face-down on a city paramedic gurney . Name : Phillip Vogel Case : In September , 1993 , the house_painter and musician died of asphyxiation after being hogtied by Bell Gardens police and then strapped face-down on an ambulance gurney . Multiple drug intoxication was a contributing factor . Name : Daniel Gizowski Case : In January , the newly released prison parolee died of a combination of methamphetamine intoxication and asphyxia related to restraint procedures , including hobbling , used by Los Angeles County sheriff ' s deputies .</TEXT>
