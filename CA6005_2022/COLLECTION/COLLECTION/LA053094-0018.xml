   <HEADLINE> VIDEO REVIEW ; ' BIX ' FAILS TO CLARIFY BEIDERBECKE ' S GENIUS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How do you separate fact from legend , authenticity from dramatic impact , in filming a movie based on an actual life ? The answer is not entirely clarified in &quot; Bix : An Interpretation of a Legend , &quot; which purports to tell the story of Leon Bix Beiderbecke ( 1903-1931 ) .An Italian / U.S. production , it was directed and co-written by Pupi Avati and shot partly on location in Davenport , Iowa ( Beiderbecke ' s home town ) , and other American locations . That Beiderbecke was a genius can hardly be disputed . As a cornetist , he made a number of records in the late 1920s , mostly in partnership with the saxophonist Frank Trumbauer , that were timeless gems . As a pianist and composer , he wrote a brilliant series of impressionistic works , only one of which he recorded ( &quot; In a Mist &quot; ) . * Beiderbecke , played by Bryant Weeks ( with sound track by Tom Pletcher ) is depicted as a rebel , torn by love of family and the need to succeed in jazz . Plagued by alcoholism , drifting in and out of jobs with the bands of Paul Whiteman and others , he died almost unknown to the public . One complaint lodged against the Charlie Parker film &quot; Bird &quot; was that it never clarified just what made him a unique artist . &quot; Bix &quot; has the same problem . Among many omissions , his interacting with black musicians ( Louis Armstrong inspired him ; trumpeter Rex Stewart even copied Beiderbecke ' s famous &quot; Singin ' the Blues &quot; solo ) is bypassed . The movie never catches_fire dramatically , but the credible traditional music , directed by saxophonist Bob Wilber and featuring pianist Keith Nichols , clarinetist Kenny Davern and others , justifies following the somewhat episodic story , which flashes_back and forth in often confusing disorder . * &quot; Bix : An Interpretation of a Legend &quot; is available on cassette from Rhapsody Films , Box 179 , New York , NY 10014 , $ 64.95 .</TEXT>
