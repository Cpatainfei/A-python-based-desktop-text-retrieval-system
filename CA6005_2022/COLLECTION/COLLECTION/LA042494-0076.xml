   <TEXT> &quot; A Baldwin Brothers Crib Sheet &quot; was a hoot until I read the line about Stephen Baldwin -- &quot; hairless as a pre-adolescent &quot; ( Film_Clips , April 3 ) . What a snide , gratuitously negative way to describe a man with a smooth chest ! The anonymous &quot; Film_Clips staff &quot; reduces smoothness in men to a kind of arrested development , as if such men were stuck_in puberty . Would you let this same limited standard of male beauty ostracize such &quot; hairless &quot; types as Arnold Schwarzenegger , who has the biggest smooth chest ever , or Tom Cruise , Richard Gere , Mel Gibson , Liam Neeson , Patrick Swayze , Michael Douglas , Gabriel Byrne , Don Johnson or good old Paul Newman ? The gutless writers who refused a byline owe an apology to Stephen Baldwin . And to Paul Newman too . Hell , you owe all_the smooth-chested guys out there an apology . I just had to get that , ahem , off my chest . ALISON SKIPWORTH Sacramento Your writing staff proved that sexism and the double_standard are alive and well . Let ' s just say that an identically flavored article appeared in Calendar , but instead of the Baldwin brothers , you featured the breast-size differences of sisters Meg and Jennifer Tilly or a facial-hair shaving analysis of the not-all-related Leighs : Janet , Jennifer Jason and Vivien . Just what would the women ' s organizations do when presented with such an article ? Since when is it politically correct to make sexist and abusive remarks about a man ' s physical appearance , even if it ' s only a &quot; joke &quot; ? I ' m tired_of the behind-the-back posturing of the media getting their jollies by demeaning men and manhood while presenting themselves as a voice for equality and fairness .
