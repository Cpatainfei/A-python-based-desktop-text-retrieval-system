   <HEADLINE> ONASSIS GIVEN LAST RITES ; FAMILY , FRIENDS GATHER ; ILLNESS : ADMIRED FORMER FIRST_LADY IS SURROUNDED BY ' A LOT OF LOVE ' AS SHE STRUGGLES WITH LYMPH CANCER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , who charmed America as a graceful First_Lady and then eased its anguish as a stoic young widow , received the last rites of the Roman_Catholic_Church on Thursday as relatives and close friends rushed to comfort her as she struggled with lymph cancer . A close friend described the 64-year-old widow of President John F . Kennedy as &quot; gravely ill. &quot; But her nephew , Rep . Joseph Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) , the son of the late Robert F . Kennedy , stressed another side to the sad news . &quot; There ' s a lot of love in her room and in her apartment , &quot; he told reporters . Onassis had entered New York Hospital-Cornell Medical_Center on Monday for further treatment of non-Hodgkin ' s lymphoma . But she asked to return to her 5th Avenue apartment that faces Central_Park on Wednesday after doctors decided that the disease could not be cured . &quot; There was nothing more to do for her , &quot; her close friend Nancy Tuckerman told reporters . &quot; The disease has progressed . She will not have any further treatment. &quot; Throughout her public life , Onassis has been known as a shy woman who tried to shun reporters and cameras but never could escape the glare of the media as it tried to satisfy the curiosity of millions of Americans . As she fought her illness in the seclusion of her apartment , scores of journalists crowded outside the exclusive building . Television trucks and special antennas stretched to the edge of the Metropolitan Museum of Art a_couple_of blocks away . In Washington , President Clinton said that he and his wife , First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , had talked with the former First_Lady during the last few days and were receiving reports on her condition . &quot; She ' s been quite wonderful to my wife , to my daughter and to all_of us , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; We ' re thinking about her and praying for her. &quot; Throughout the day , relatives and close friends entered the apartment to stand at her bedside and then take solace in each other . Her son , 33-year-old John F . Kennedy Jr. , ran_across 5th Avenue from Central_Park in the morning so he could rush into the building without replying to questions from reporters . Her daughter , 36-year-old Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg , and her husband , Edwin , came_to the bedside as well . President Kennedy ' s last surviving brother , Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) and his wife , Victoria , arrived in the early evening after a flight from Washington . Others who joined the vigil included Onassis ' sister , Lee Radziwill Ross , and two of President Kennedy ' s sisters -- Eunice Shriver and Patricia Kennedy Lawford . Her brother-in-law , Sargent Shriver , arrived with Eunice . Their daughter , television_reporter Maria Shriver , also stopped by . Sen . Kennedy , after visiting his sister-in-law for 90 minutes , told reporters that Onassis is &quot; enormously grateful to all_the people who have been kind enough to send her notes wishing her well . She ' s resting comfortably and I look_forward to seeing her tomorrow. &quot; The media outside chronicled all_the comings and goings , not surprising since she is widely viewed_as the most glamorous of American first_ladies , a shy yet sophisticated woman who spoke French and immersed herself in the history of the White_House . When President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 , the dignity of the young widow in black with two small children at her side at his funeral was stamped via television into the memory of the nation . Some of that aura was lost when she married the older Greek millionaire Aristotle Onassis , five years after the death of the President . But that marriage , though it lasted until Aristotle Onassis ' death in 1975 , was not regarded_as a happy one , and she did not go_to Paris to be near him in his last_days . A widow for the second time , she then entered the book publishing business in New York . She is now a senior editor at Bantam-Doubleday . In recent years , she was often accompanied in public by millionaire Maurice Tempelsman . He was reportedly at her bedside Thursday . Msgr . George Bardes of St . Thomas More Roman_Catholic_Church , her parish church , administered &quot; the sacrament of the sick. &quot; That is more commonly known by its former name of &quot; the last rites &quot; and is given to anyone who is regarded_as seriously ill . Doctors at the hospital had been treating Onassis with radiation and chemotherapy since January , when she was first diagnosed as suffering from non-Hodgkin ' s lymphoma , a cancer of the lymphatic_system , which produces the white_blood_cells that fight infection and bolster immunity . Some variations of this disease are often regarded_as curable , but there can be sudden relapses . The extent of the seriousness of Onassis ' illness was not widely known and she was seen strolling in Central_Park only Sunday , the day before she entered the hospital . The gravity of the illness became clear , however , when she decided to leave the hospital and return to her bed in the apartment . &quot; She ' s near death , &quot; said a friend of the family . &quot; They ' re very careful about her privacy and they ' re trying to make_it as private and dignified as possible. &quot; Times staff writers Marlene Cimons and Alan Miller contributed to this story from Washington .</TEXT>
