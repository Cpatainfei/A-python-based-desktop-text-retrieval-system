   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CLINTON HAD CLEAR VIETNAM STRATEGY -- AND FOLLOWED IT ; FOREIGN_POLICY : POLITICAL SENSITIVITY OF THE MIA ISSUE CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION . BUSH HAD ALREADY LAID GROUNDWORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Bill_Clinton became President a year ago , the conventional wisdom among foreign_policy experts was that improving relations between the United States and Vietnam had just moved onto a distant back burner . Clinton had spent much of his campaign answering charges that he had maneuvered to avoid the draft during the Vietnam_War . And only weeks after he came_to the White_House , the new President was embroiled in another emotional military_issue , his order to allow gays to serve in the armed forces . So it seemed unlikely that Clinton would take bold steps_on the touchy question of Vietnam . &quot; If this issue waits for a Clinton_Administration , &quot; one Indochina expert said before the inauguration , &quot; we might have to wait until ( 1995 ) or even longer. &quot; In fact , Clinton and his aides quietly began moving_on Vietnam almost immediately -- denying all_the while that they had made any firm decisions . They devised what Assistant Secretary_of_State Winston Lord called &quot; an incremental strategy , &quot; moving one small step at a time through the political minefield of the prisoner-of-war issue . They frequently stopped to gauge public reactions before moving forward . On Thursday , Clinton finally took a major public step , lifting the U.S. trade_embargo that has applied to Communist-ruled North Vietnam for 30 years and to South Vietnam since it fell to the Communists 19 years ago . &quot; I have made the judgment that the best way to ensure cooperation from Vietnam ( on accounting_for troops missing in the war ) . . . is to end the trade_embargo , &quot; Clinton said . The move drew criticism from groups representing the families of Vietnam POWs and MIAs -- but praise from most of Congress , including some frequent Clinton critics . &quot; I think the President has handled this very well , especially given the circumstances surrounding his involvement in the issue , &quot; said Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , a conservative former POW who has campaigned for more normal relations with Vietnam . Indeed , for a President who has come_to grief in other forays_into foreign_policy , from Somalia and Bosnia to Haiti , the careful but steady march toward lifting the trade_embargo stands_out as a notable case of sure-footedness . Officials offer several reasons for the Administration ' s success . One is that Clinton decided early in his Administration on a set of clear , precise goals , which has not been the case on some issues . A second important factor is that Vietnam , anxious for U.S. trade and investment , cooperated enthusiastically . And a third , ironically , was the political sensitivity of the MIA issue . It captured Clinton ' s attention in a way that only a_few other foreign_policy problems have , focused the policy clearly on winning cooperation from the Vietnamese -- and ensured that the problem would get top-level treatment when decisions were needed . &quot; This is one issue where he has clearly delineated his priorities , &quot; a senior official said of Clinton . &quot; We often have some tension between goals when we ' re pursuing relations with various countries -- security , human_rights , economics . . . . This is one case where the priorities were firmly established . In this case , ( it was ) the MIA issue. &quot; Clinton was lucky on one other count : He basically agreed with the policy that his predecessor , George_Bush , was already following . In 1991 , Bush had given Vietnam what officials called &quot; a road map &quot; for improved relations with the United States . At the top of the map was greater cooperation on clearing_up the cases of more_than 2 # 000 servicemen listed as missing from the Vietnam_War . In his campaign , Clinton never explicitly endorsed Bush ' s policy , which had drawn criticism from POW-MIA family groups . Instead , battling his own Vietnam problem , he gave the impression that he would be extra tough on the issue . &quot; This is personally a very big issue with me , &quot; he said . At a &quot; town_meeting &quot; in Detroit , he told a POW activist that he would &quot; make_it clear to Vietnam and to the other countries in Southeast_Asia that full normalization of relationships depends_upon an accounting_for every single one of those people. &quot; But two weeks after the election , Clinton offered a softer line -- one that turned_out to be the policy he followed . Instead of demanding a complete accounting , something military experts say is a practical impossibility , Clinton called_on Vietnam to provide &quot; the most extensive and good_faith possible effort &quot; to account_for the missing . The first_steps were halting -- and thrown_off course by unexpected events . State_Department and National Security_Council officials began drawing_up policy papers within weeks of the inauguration . As an initial move , they suggested , Clinton could drop the U.S. objection to new loans for Vietnam from the International Monetary Fund . But in February , the Administration found itself embroiled in the controversy over gays in the military , prompting caution on other military_issues . And in April , a Harvard researcher published a document from Soviet archives which charged Vietnam with deliberately concealing the survival of hundreds of U.S. prisoners in 1972 . That touched_off an uproar among POW-MIA groups -- and forced a three-month postponement of the IMF move . By July , Clinton was ready to take his first major step . On the Friday before the July 4 weekend -- a time chosen partly because Congress was out of town and the public was heading for the holidays -- the White_House announced that the United States was dropping its opposition to new international loans for Vietnam . At the same time , Clinton laid_out four specific areas where he wanted more cooperation from Hanoi before the United States would lift the embargo : the recovery of remains of servicemen who died in Vietnam ; the resolution of cases in which MIAs might have survived ; faster delivery of Vietnamese documents that could contain information about MIAs , and a joint effort with Laos to search that country ' s border with Vietnam . The White_House held its breath for public reaction . &quot; Some people were worried that the sky would fall , &quot; a senior official recalled . &quot; They were pleasantly surprised when it didn ' t. &quot; A_few weeks later , Clinton sent three officials to Hanoi to assess Vietnam ' s performance : Lord , Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Herschel Gober and Lt . Gen . Michael E . Ryan , an aide to the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff . The officials talked with much of Vietnam ' s Communist hierarchy -- and with the U.S. military experts sifting through aircraft crash sites on the ground . They looked_at cardboard boxes with bits of bones and teeth , at battered old dog_tags , at tattered , faded logs from Vietnamese anti-aircraft units recounting the survival or death of U.S. pilots whose planes were shot down . And they came_away impressed . &quot; They were clearly trying to cooperate , &quot; one official said of the Vietnamese . Gober , an old friend of Clinton ' s from Arkansas , told the President that the Vietnamese performance was real . &quot; When Hershel Gober switches , when he ' s convinced , that makes a big difference , &quot; a White_House official said . &quot; They go_back a long_time . And not only that . Here ' s a guy who understands deeply the way the families feel. &quot; Still , the President wanted to move slowly . In September , some officials suggested at least a partial lifting of the embargo . But Clinton was heading toward a showdown in Congress over the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . &quot; There was a lot of nervousness in the Senate about taking_on the Vietnam problem , &quot; recalled Sen . McCain . So , instead , Clinton announced another partial measure : allowing U.S. firms to bid on projects in Vietnam financed by the IMF and other international institutions . &quot; These were projects financed partly by U.S. tax dollars , &quot; an official explained . &quot; It didn ' t make_sense to prohibit Americans from bidding for them. &quot; The move also reflected another new factor_in the debate : the growing insistence of U.S. firms that Vietnam was turning_into a major market -- and that companies from Japan , France and other countries were moving_in fast while Americans were standing on the sidelines . Still , the White_House announced its action only quietly -- and on the same day that Israel ' s Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat sealed a peace agreement at the White_House . Again , the timing helped forestall POW-MIA groups from mounting much of a protest . Lord even joked about the pattern of &quot; Stealth &quot; announcements . &quot; Stay tuned for Christmas , &quot; he told a group of State_Department employees . He was almost right . In December , he and other officials made another trip to Hanoi and found more evidence of real cooperation from the Vietnamese . According to one official , Lord told a Dec . 20 meeting of the National Security_Council Principals Committee -- Clinton ' s top advisers , including the secretaries_of_State and Defense -- that the time had come_to lift the embargo . The White_House and the State_Department assured the POW-MIA groups -- and the public -- that no decision at all had been made . Finally , two senators stepped_in . John Kerry , a liberal Massachusetts Democrat who had won the Medal_of_Honor in Vietnam before turning against the war ; and McCain , a conservative Republican , who had spent seven years as a prisoner_of_war in Hanoi . Both agreed that it was time to lift the embargo -- and neither feared accusations of softness on Vietnam . Early last week , Kerry decided , virtually on the spur of the moment , to offer the Senate a resolution asking Clinton to lift the embargo . He told his national security adviser , Anthony Lake , of his plan . To some senators , Clinton seemed -- again -- to be testing the wind without committing himself on the issue . And some believed that was not all bad . &quot; It was smart , &quot; McCain said . It kept the issue bipartisan , he said . Kerry ' s resolution passed_by a surprising 62-38 vote . &quot; It gave Clinton essential political cover , &quot; McCain said .
