   <HEADLINE> FROM SUNKEN TREASURES TO WEIRD MAPS , IT ' S A MYSTERY ; RECORDS : COUNTY OFFICIALS ARE PLAGUED BY UNSOLVED INTRIGUES -- SOME GRIM , SOME MERELY PUZZLING -- THAT REFUSE TO GO AWAY AS 1994 BEGINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The New Year promises a fresh_start , the opportunity to shed the baggage of 365 days of loose_ends and unaccomplished goals . With a_few exceptions . When 1993 departed , it left a handful of unanswered questions to plague Orange County officials and record-keepers , mysteries that refuse to go_away . For example , the Orange County coroner ' s office last year noted the passing of three men and two women who were marked for perpetuity as anonymous , bringing_to an even dozen the number of John and Jane Does recorded in the past three years . &quot; There are 101 reasons why people might not be identified , &quot; said deputy coroner Cullen Ellingburgh . &quot; Maybe no one knows they are missing or there are only skeletal remains &quot; which are difficult to identify , he said . Surprisingly , Ellingburgh added , only a very small number of missing persons reports on file with authorities contain dental records , making_it very difficult to identify skeletal remains . Not every unanswered mystery is grim , though . Some simply reek of adventure . Take the case of the sunken merchant_ship laden with riches . &quot; The most frequently asked-for shipwreck record is for the Adda Hancock , which blew_up in Los Angeles Harbor in 1863 , &quot; said Suzanne Dewberry , assistant director of the National Archives in Laguna Niguel . &quot; Apparently it had gold bullion on it. &quot; Dewberry said that of a &quot; whole bunch &quot; of sunken ships off the coast , the Adda Hancock is far and away the favorite among treasure hunters . &quot; Sometimes I think it ' s a test to see if we ' re able to answer , &quot; she said of the questions posed by people with that golden_glow in their eyes . &quot; Something in old newspaper_articles leads them to believe &quot; the ship was carrying gold bullion when it sank . Alas , archive staffers have searched for a clue so often they don ' t even have to look any more in_order to say there ' s nothing in their 19 # 000 cubic_feet of government records to clear_up this mystery . &quot; We ' ve been through it time and time again , &quot; Dewberry said . &quot; We have never , ever found any records for it. &quot; The federal_government holds no monopoly on mysteries . There is more_than one unanswered riddle filed_away in the subterranean vaults of the Orange County government archives in the old County_Courthouse in Santa Ana . For starters , what ' s the deal with that 140-year-old map of a stretch of English countryside ? Last February , stacks of_aging court exhibits from the 1930s that had become separated from their respective case files were transferred from the county clerk ' s office to the archives for storage . But one yellowed , oversized map had no case number stamped on it , even though it bore a large letter &quot; A , &quot; indicating it probably had been an exhibit . &quot; I looked_at a modern map of England and I couldn ' t find it , &quot; said archive technician Ana Christensen . &quot; But we did enough research to find_out what area it represented -- West_Yorkshire . It ' s probably less than a square mile. &quot; Unable to connect the map to an Orange County court case , Christensen turned across the sea for help . &quot; We got the address of the Sheffield city museum and made a facsimile of the map . . . and sent it to them , &quot; she said . * In June , Lisa A . Atkinson of the Sheffield Archives provided what news she could . &quot; The map was most likely drawn_in Sheffield . . . circa 1850 , &quot; Atkinson wrote in a letter to Orange County archivists . A check of English census , tax and property records , voter rolls and old maps had proven a dead_end . &quot; And she never did identify why it was here , &quot; or why it should show_up in a stack of 1930s-era Orange County court documents , Christensen said . &quot; It ' s the wrong country and the wrong century. &quot; In another corner of the Orange County Archives , a turn-of-the-century map of Fullerton poses a_couple_of intriguing questions of its own : Exactly who was buried alongside that roadway , and where did the bodies go ? The map turns_up in a file from an 1898 petition for a new road that appears to be the forerunner of Associated Road in Fullerton , north of Yorba Linda Boulevard , Christensen said . Next to the east_side of the road are what appear to be markers just above the notation &quot; graves. &quot; &quot; It looks_like three crosses , &quot; Christensen said . A further curiosity is that the review board that studied the road request and wrote a three-page report to the Board of Supervisors made not even a passing reference_to the grave sites , Christensen said . A couple years after the request was denied , another was submitted with a copy of the map , complete with markers and the same notation . But again there was no reference_to the graves in the report . &quot; It could have been that it was_on somebody ' s old homestead , a family graveyard , &quot; speculated Tom Cordry , an Orange County Cemetery District_manager . &quot; Before they would have issued them any permits to put a road through there , they probably would have had to move those bodies in those graves and interred them somewhere else. &quot; On the other hand , he suggested , &quot; you might be able to dig around there and find something . They were a lot more lax about things in those days. &quot; The county recorder ' s office may have solved one last mystery that resides in an oversized musty old book that duly records in 17 pages the county ' s entire &quot; Record of Oyster Beds. &quot; &quot; We have a record of oyster_beds , &quot; allowed assistant recorder Ella Murphy , &quot; but there ' s no record of oysters ever being taken_out of Orange County water. &quot; For the record : Early this century , a state law made_it illegal to dump sewage or other garbage into waters where oysters were being cultivated . Seizing this opportunity , locals who may best be characterized as the vanguard of the environmental movement came_up with a scheme to keep the waters off Newport Beach pollution-free . From June 9 , 1910 , through Sept . 13 , 1920 , these ocean-loving activists filed claims with the recorder ' s office purporting to identify oyster_beds just off Newport . But , according to Murphy , the Orange County Historical Commission has since determined that there is no record of a single oyster ever being pulled from those waters .</TEXT>
