   <TEXT> If Elizabeth I had been faced with the_likes_of the wayward Princess Diana , she ' d have thrown the witless woman into the Tower_of_London and launched a smear campaign . So asserts British literary scholar Rosalind Miles , Oxford-educated author of 15 nonfiction and fiction works -- including two bestsellers in England . But it ' s not Diana ' s alleged adultery that would have irked the so-called Virgin Queen . It ' s that Diana broke the aristocracy ' s centuries-old code of honor by leaving her husband and publicly whining -- moves to rock the royal barge that she learned from her mother . &quot; She ' s bleated , whined and leaked like a sieve , &quot; says Miles , relaxing with coffee in her Times Square hotel_room at the end of a three-week U.S. book tour , soon to return to her 16th-Century farmhouse in Warwickshire . &quot; In Elizabeth ' s day , she would ' ve been silenced and saved from these embarrassing affairs . . . with chinless wonders. &quot; Miles , 43 , is accustomed to speaking_for the 16th-Century monarch . Her latest tome -- a 595-page novel called &quot; I , Elizabeth &quot; ( Doubleday , 1994 ) -- is written entirely in the first_person and took_five years to write . &quot; Elizabeth I ' s own voice was so distinctive , in the end I could almost hear her talking to me , &quot; Miles says . She says she wrote the book because she respects the woman who juggled a problem-plagued childhood , religious tempests , breathless bedchamber secrets , the Spanish_Armada and her nemesis Mary , Queen of Scots , all without losing her royal image . &quot; What an amazing woman , &quot; Miles says . She can ' t say the same for Diana , whom she calls &quot; unbelievably narcissistically involved. &quot; And she ' s not too keen on Prince Charles , either , for having followed Diana ' s example of &quot; girlie blabbering. &quot; Again she harks to the glory days of Elizabeth I . &quot; She would ' ve sent Charles off to conquer new_worlds -- heroic action is always good . Give him a whiff of grapeshot and he would ' ve had plenty to do . Today , he ' s just a man without a function. &quot; So what ' s a modern-day Royal Mom to do ? &quot; The Queen couldn ' t have done anything more , &quot; Miles says . &quot; She has put_up and shut_up all her life . She ' s staggered by this betrayal of privacy. &quot; Adds Miles : &quot; I follow this with great concern . It ' s not a soap_opera , it ' s a Greek tragedy. &quot; * As Miles details in her book , randy royalty is nothing new . In fact , she says , Elizabeth I was a sexy and passionate woman who likely had several romantic liaisons with members of her court , remaining single only to retain independence and power . &quot; People were not faithful in the Old_World . . . . It was a virile , full-blooded age , &quot; she says , adding that there is still today much more random and adulterous sex in England than ever in America . But the difference between then and now and here and there is the way infidelities are handled by spouses . Explains Miles of those centuries-old English ways : &quot; Edwardian girls were brought_up to believe lovers were flowers and husbands trees . Divorce was not acceptable. &quot; Likewise , for men , &quot; There ' s a solidly established tradition of having a wife and mistress . You treat your wife decently , don ' t bring your mistress to the dinner_table and turn_a_blind_eye to your wife ' s boyfriends. &quot; Adds Miles : &quot; It ' s a stark code but it ' s clear . You live_by it and die by it. &quot; So what went_wrong with Charles and Di ? The answer is simple , says Miles : Their calculated merger was a royal matchmaking mistake right from the start . &quot; The ( royal_family ) wanted a wife for Charles who was blue-blooded , a virgin , and she had to be tall , &quot; Miles says . &quot; The physical pedigree dominated their minds. &quot; But had they taken Diana ' s &quot; psychological pedigree &quot; into account , the royals would have thought_twice , she says . &quot; This was the child of the worst divorce that ' s rocked British aristocracy since the 18th Century , &quot; Miles says , detailing the history of Diana ' s mother , who left her husband for her lover . &quot; Her mother broke the code of carrying_on the affair and remaining in the marriage . She ran_away with the bloke. &quot; As a result , Diana grew_up with a series of &quot; horrible nannies &quot; and a &quot; hysterical obsession to build a family life -- to make things right this time , &quot; Miles says . that ' s why she would n ' t &quot; put_up and shut_up &quot; about Charles ' infidelity . Says Miles , who calls herself a feminist : &quot; Charles was brought_up by the code and taught that adultery is OK . But Diana wasn ' t , so she blew ( the code ) out of the water . She ' s a selfish and hysterical mother who puts her own unhappiness above her children . If she loved her children , she would ' ve stayed with their father. &quot; But doesn ' t she sympathize_with Diana ' s plight ? &quot; Well , she was used , but she ' s deeply ignorant , &quot; Miles says . &quot; The cruel truth is she was redundant the minute she produced the heir and the spare. &quot; She sniffs . &quot; Damaged people are damaging , &quot; she says . &quot; She ' s dragged British aristocracy into the era of tabloid confessionals , which are low class . that ' s why people there hate her to death. &quot; Still , when pressed , she does express a bit of hedged pity for the princess . &quot; I do feel terribly sorry_for her , but she 100 % contributed to everything , &quot; Miles says . &quot; She ' s a player in this Greek tragedy . Given an option at every stage , she ' s picked the stupid one. &quot; * Miles ' impatience with Diana perhaps stems from the plucky way the author has handled her own life ' s travails . At the age of 10 , after getting a scholarship , Miles was plucked from her &quot; very ordinary family -- poor as church_mice &quot; ( her father was a baker ) who lived_in a wild-flowered rural paradise . She was sent to a &quot; hothouse girls ' school with daughters of bishops and things. &quot; &quot; One day I ' m climbing trees in the countryside and the next day I ' m learning Greek in a repressed girls ' school atmosphere , &quot; she recalls . &quot; I was to be bitterly unhappy for the next 7 1 / 2 years. &quot; Still , she was a good student , and &quot; cottoned onto the fact that if I hung_in , I ' d get_to Oxford . It came_to me that this was the price , so you bite the bullet and you get there. &quot; During this time , her father , who suffered throughout her childhood with what was diagnosed as tuberculosis but really was cancer , had a lung removed and was in a convalescent home for two years . Her mother developed cancer and died when Miles was 15 . But Miles didn ' t break_down , she says . &quot; I learned to be British , to put_up and shut_up . You don ' t talk_about your feelings -- no bleating , no whining . You ' re magnanimous in victory , dignified in defeat. &quot; She went_on to study English at Oxford , where she won prizes ; earned master ' s and doctoral degrees at Birmingham ' s Shakespeare Institute , and then another master ' s at the Centre for Mass Communication Research at the University of Leicester . She also married and had two children . Her marriage is happy , she says , but even if it weren ' t , she ' d never leave her husband . &quot; As soon as I had children , divorce was off the agenda , &quot; she says . She describes her studies as her &quot; secular religion. &quot; &quot; I ' ve always found my comfort in it , &quot; she says . &quot; Every crisis we face , someone has been there before us and written_about it beautifully . that ' s our solace. &quot; She notes that in America , the religion is &quot; spilling your own guts &quot; in everything from 12-step meetings to talk_shows . Asks Miles : &quot; Why not see if someone ' s done_it before and done_it better ? &quot; But despite her disdain , she admits to fascination . &quot; I ' m glued to the TV here where grown-up people are spilling everything , &quot; she says , segueing into the subject of a talk_show she saw here on her tour . The subject : sexual incompatibility . &quot; Here this dorky-looking guy is saying his wife ' s sex demands are insatiable , &quot; she says . &quot; And in bounces this woman -- his wife -- just oozing sexuality . The defeated-looking nerd was all_over her like cheap after-shave. &quot; She laughs . &quot; I couldn ' t tear myself away even though I had important appointments to get_to , &quot; she says . So , will British aristocracy go the way of Diana and undignified , spill-your-guts America ? Absolutely not , Miles says . &quot; This is seen as a big dramatic thing but it ' s not , really . People underestimate the phlegmatic nature of Britain . &quot; There ' s a bit of logistical juggling , of twiddling knobs to adjust the reception , but things go_on and things don ' t change. &quot;</TEXT>
