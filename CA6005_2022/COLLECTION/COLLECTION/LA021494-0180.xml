   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN WINS THE DOWNHILL IN OLYMPIC UPSET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tommy Moe of Palmer , Alaska , became only the third American male ever to win an Olympic gold medal in Alpine skiing on Sunday when he defeated , in dramatic fashion , local favorite Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway to win the downhill before an estimated crowd of 40 # 000 at Kvitfjell , Norway . Moe succeeded where Olympic officials had failed , turning attention to the Lillehammer Games and away from the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan situation . &quot; I didn ' t even have any thoughts in my mind that I was going_to win , &quot; said Moe , who won by 0.04 of a second over Aamodt in the closest Alpine race in Olympic history . &quot; I just figured , ' Hey , I ' ll ski the best I can. ' &quot; In other developments : * First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was late getting_to the slopes and missed Moe ' s medal-winning run , but she and daughter Chelsea were in_attendance later in the day when the U.S. hockey_team rallied from a two-goal third-period deficit to achieve a 4-4 tie against France . * Norwegians at the Viking Hall celebrated a world-record-setting gold medal performance by countryman Johann Olav Koss , who won easily in the 5 # 000-meter speedskating event . * Kerrigan , among the favorites in women ' s figure_skating , issued a statement regarding the decision Saturday by U.S. officials to allow Harding to compete in the Games despite Harding ' s admission that she knew about the Jan . 6 attack on Kerrigan well before she reported it to authorities . &quot; The matter has been resolved , &quot; Kerrigan said in the statement , which did not mention Harding by name . &quot; Regardless of my opinion on the ruling , the Olympics have begun and it ' s time to skate. &quot; Moe silenced a mountain full of clanging cowbells with his victory over Aamodt , the world ' s top skier . Moe won with a time of 1 minute , 45.75 seconds . Aamodt , skiing from the sixth position , had taken the lead from Luxembourg ' s Marc Girardelli , much to the delight of fans who cheered wildly and waved Norwegian flags . But the euphoria was short-lived as Moe , skiing right after Aamodt , stunned the crowd with the finest race of his career . Although he was the world ' s ninth-ranked downhill skier entering the Lillehammer Games , Moe had never before won an international race . Moe earned the gold 10 years after Americans Bill Johnson and Phil Mahre won the downhill and the slalom , respectively , at the 1984 Sarajevo Games . Johnson , Mahre and Moe are the only American men to have earned Olympic gold medals in Alpine skiing .</TEXT>
