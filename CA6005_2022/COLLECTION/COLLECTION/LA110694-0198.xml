   <TEXT> Next to a sidewalk with weeds in every crack , a purple-blossoming plant was growing : a petunia , planted by someone as optimistic as the writer and political missionary Jim Wallis . On a hot September afternoon , Wallis was leading me through a stretch of Washington , D.C. , known as the 14th Street corridor . The petunia stuck_out among the forsaken patches of a neighborhood -- Columbia Heights , 20 blocks from the White_House -- that has lain in waste since the 1968 rioting . Rounding a corner , we came_upon five youths standing over another young_man who was prone on the sidewalk , breathing loudly , his face messed_up , skin broken , blood running onto his shirt . His assailants looked murderous , but , seeing Wallis , they changed their minds and pedaled away on bicycles . Wallis signaled to another teen-ager standing nearby . &quot; Get him cleaned_up , will you , please ? &quot; The two were friends , and , arms around each other , herky-jerky , they went_across the street . It occurred to me that a group of avengers with automatic weapons might appear at any second . Wallis , streetwise and shaman-like , seemed oblivious to such a danger , and events would bear him out . Wallis has had 20 years to learn how to tell the merely horrible from the tragic along the 14th Street corridor . He is the founder and leader of the Sojourners Community , a ministry cum commune cum social movement started by mostly middle-class , mostly white evangelical Christians who threw_in their lot with the inhabitants of Columbia Heights in the last gasp of the do-good ' 60s . Wallis and about 50 others live_in cooperatively owned row_houses there , within walking distance of each other . In a former crackhouse , they run education programs for adults and children , a tenants ' rights organization , a food_bank and an all-purpose Neighborhood Center . Wallis ' idea , and the force behind Sojourners , is that bibilical faith compels radical social_action . While most of us accept the successes wrought by public policy on behalf of justice , peace and the poor -- small successes that admit , in_essence , that injustice , war and poverty will always be with us -- for Wallis , that isn ' t good_enough . His conscience leads him to take_on these issues again and again , firsthand , every day . He is surely the only participant in President Clinton ' s prayer breakfasts who chooses to make the 14th Street corridor his home . He regularly gets himself arrested in acts of civil_disobedience . In a quixotic protest of the wildly popular Gulf War , he fasted for 47 days . He presides at the funerals of neighborhood youngsters gunned_down at close range and then takes_on the improbable cause of a nationwide gang truce . In the late ' 80s , he sneaked into South_Africa to report back on the anti-apartheid movement . When the United States was arming the Contras , he mobilized thousands of Witness for Peace and joined them in Nicaragua as they made_it known that they were willing to take a bullet to stop the fighting . &quot; There has to be more_than just writing_about a vision of social transformation , &quot; the 46-year-old Wallis explained to me . &quot; You have to give your life to it -- if necessary , risk your life for it. &quot; Wallis also preaches what he practices . He travels the lecture circuit half the year . When he is at_home , he is the lay pastor of the ecumenical Sojourner ' s &quot; church , &quot; which meets every Sunday in the Neighborhood Center . He contributes to Sojourners magazine , which he co-founded and edits . In his just-published third book , &quot; The Soul of Politics , &quot; Wallis delivers a sermon that has to be called a manifesto . The world isn ' t working . . . . Ideologies and policies of liberal and conservative , Left and Right , have run their course and come_to a dead_end . . . . Politics has been reduced to the selfish struggle for power among competing interests and groups . . . . We need a personal ethic of moral responsibility , a social vision based on bringing people together , a commitment to justice with the capacity also for reconciliation , an economic approach governed by the ethics of community and sustainability , a restored sense of our covenant with the abandoned poor and the damaged earth , and a renewal of citizen politics to fashion a new political future . We must , writes Wallis , &quot; find common_ground . . . by moving to higher ground &quot; -- or perish . It is no accident that &quot; The Soul of Politics &quot; arrived on bookshelves at the height of another electoral season . Against the 1994 campaigns -- cutthroat , cynical , divisive and manipulative -- -Wallis ' jeremiad can ' t help but sound like a righteous voice crying in the wilderness , a voice made all_the more prophetic , according to social critic Cornel West , because of his rare standing as &quot; visionary . . . who grounds his reflection in concrete action . Wallis is politically idealistic beyond the bounds of anything that is familiar or conventional in Washington . The fact that he wants the rest of us to follow him may make him a saint or God ' s fool , or maybe an ordinary American revolutionary . The cliche about saints is that they are insufferable in_person . In this regard Wallis has achieved a breakthrough . He is engaging at a_level that wins_over a wide variety of people . One recent day , he talked business on the phone with a financial_officer who was with a women ' s community in the Catholic_Church ' s Dominican Order while holding a second conversation , by hand signals , with two reformed California gang leaders who had dropped_by his office . One secret to Wallis ' likability is his unpolished , shy social manner : He has a stutter ; when he ' s in a hurry , he eats Chinese food with a fork . Also , he is willing to admit to periods of heartache and depression . Many evenings , his soul is heavier than when the day began . &quot; Washington is in crisis , America is in crisis , the world is in crisis and I will sometimes get_to a point , realizing I am not totally together in my own life either , where I wonder how worthwhile is it to go_on , &quot; he told me . &quot; On those nights I come_home , drop_in my chair and drown_out everything with music -- jazz , rock , it doesn ' t matter . I love the soundtrack from the movie ' The Mission , ' all those haunting Indian wind_instruments , but lately I ' ve been listening a lot to the old spirituals ; they really satisfy my soul. &quot; That Wallis goes_through his ups and downs , in my mind , invests him with a humanity he might otherwise lack . There is suspense in his character . A man of middle height with a bodybuilder ' s physique , Wallis has a soft face . His burly arms are hairy , his sandy hair is combed in an early rock ' n ' roll style , his complexion is reddish . The son of a World_War_II romance , he was raised in suburban Detroit in a Middle-American family anchored by the church . His home today is a modest brown-brick , two-story row_house . The day I visited , the smell of burned beans hung_in the air ; a phone_call had distracted him while he was cooking supper the night before . Upstairs was a treadmill , the only evidence of the boutique spirit of the late 20th Century that I could find in the house . On the wall of his dining_room , in a shrine effect , Wallis has affixed about 25 crucifixes and crosses made of wood or tapestry and collected from around the world . On one of them , two thin sticks glued together , the name of a Salvadoran priest , Ignacio Ellacuria , and the date of his murder , 11-16-89 , has been printed . Wallis thought it had been lost in a police storage_room -- he was carrying it during a protest that resulted in his arrest -- but a police_officer went_to the trouble of retrieving it . &quot; This was a hardened , tough-guy cop , a guy you ' d expect to stomp on you , but he did a decent thing , &quot; Wallis said . &quot; So you see why , no matter how down I get , I never stop believing_in hope. &quot; Few of the standard positions of the Left or Right , nothing about national security or the gross_national_product , are of much concern to Wallis . What drives his activism , both as a citizen of his destitute neighborhood and as a citizen of the wider world , is an inclusive and egalitarian power-to-the-people , spread-the-wealth , peace-be-with-you morality . The sum of his political strategy is to encourage people to take responsibility and fight for their own local issues , whether an end to poverty or an end to apartheid . The sum of his philosophy is a Christian humanism based on the concept that all people were created in the image of God . &quot; Most of the world ' s religions believe_in this concept , imago dei , which is to say that the value of each person is the same . A rich_person ' s life is no more sacred than a poor_person ' s , &quot; he said to me . &quot; If we could only adopt this simple concept in our lives , how might the world be transformed ? &quot; When I asked him about breaking the cycle of poverty and violence in neighborhoods like Columbia Heights , he corrected me . &quot; Poverty isn ' t the root problem ; poverty leads to hopelessness , which is a deeper , spiritual problem . These kids see no reason to grow old . All they own are a_few matters of pride . that ' s what they kill each other over . Who flirted_with my girlfriend ? Who looked_at me the wrong way ? Who disrespected whom ? &quot; The ultimate answer , he said , lies_in the old-fashioned notion of letting people take_charge of_their_own lives , referred to popularly these days as &quot; empowerment &quot; and favored nominally in Washington by both liberals and conservatives . It is not clear what politicians mean by the term , but it is likely a far_cry from the sweeping forms of self-rule and self-responsibility Wallis has tried to institute . The Sojourners Community has tried to find every means possible whereby its mostly African-American neighbors , who now hoard dribs and drabs of income for the landlord , can gain their own stake in the city , through expanded tenant rights , cooperative housing , accessible mortgages , whatever it takes . As far as Wallis can see , neither liberals nor conservatives truly believe_in sharing power with poor people . &quot; Most conservatives want to abandon the poor , and most liberals want to control the poor . There are liberals who give money to our little operation solely because they want to stop the violence . They care nothing about rebuilding society. &quot; For some years , the building across the street from Wallis ' row_house was inhabited by crackheads . On one occasion , these neighbors used a heavy object to smash through his front_door and rummage inside for valuables . Then , remarkably , the building was sold to a young professional couple , and the addicts were evicted . Over the weeks , Wallis observed the couple , evidently well-off , as they converted what had been apartments into a mansion of rooms for themselves . A masonry wall was erected out front , topped by a fence of black wrought iron . A gate was installed for the driveway , and marigolds and geraniums were planted in profusion . Wallis had a reaction that cuts against the grain of a materialistic age . &quot; I don ' t know which is the worst evil , the crackhouse or the gentrified house , &quot; he said to me . He spoke in a mild voice , as if expressing an ordinary opinion , as if he was not rebuking most of his peers in contemporary America . When Wallis is in Washington , he spends his days at the offices of Sojourners magazine , on the outer edge of the corridor in an old Gothic building with finely carved moldings and domed-ceiling rooms . For awhile , during the reign of the Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua , that country ' s ambassadors to the United States were based in this building . In the 1980s , Wallis devoted many pages of the magazine to Nicaragua and caused himself to be arrested at demonstrations , all_in an attempt to stop the Reagan_Administration from returning to power the Somozatistas , then called the Contras . The irony of moving_into the old Somoza embassy , the rent now at ghetto rates , was not lost on Wallis . &quot; We hope by being here we can settle a karmic debt , &quot; he told me good-naturedly . His humor that particular September morning was a little forced . He had just learned that the entire Sojourners operation had slipped into yet another financial crisis , perhaps the most threatening ever . Revenues for 1994 were going_to be_well short of the projected $ 1.2-million budget . The magazine might have to miss an issue . Layoffs seemed inevitable ; there might be payless paydays , a nightmare for a staff already stretched to the limit ( almost everyone who works for the magazine belongs as well to the Sojourners Community ) . They might even be evicted from the old embassy . There was a sink-or-swim mood among the Sojourners staffers , many of them young heartlanders wearing sandals , shorts and T-shirts , but by the same token , everyone seemed to be expecting Wallis to resolve the crisis . He had hoped to use the better part of the month to collect himself mentally before embarking_on a long nationwide tour to promote &quot; The Soul of Politics , &quot; but instead , he now would have to devote himself to seeking loans from a network of friends . Aside from the occasional grant , money for Sojourners is raised a_few dollars at a time from magazine subscriptions , direct-mail solicitations and book sales ( the Sojourners book catalogue has an extensive list of religious Left authors ) . Wallis took a minute in the mail room to confer_with two interns who were about to ship a copy of his new book to England for an auction of the_British rights . It would cost $ 40 for UPS to deliver the book overnight . &quot; Better find a cheaper way , &quot; Wallis said . He thought a minute , finger to lips . &quot; OK , send it UPS , but enclose the bill and ask the publisher to pay. &quot; He gave me an embarrassed smile . &quot; I hate being poor all_the time. &quot; In his office , the walls postered with quotations from Gandhi and Dr. Martin_Luther_King Jr . ( &quot; Unarmed truth is the most powerful thing in the universe &quot; ) , Wallis dialed the number of a prospective lender , a friend at a nonprofit financial cooperative . &quot; I wish I was calling just to say hello , &quot; he said into the phone , &quot; but , the truth is , our back is against the wall . We need $ 50 # 000 in the next two weeks. &quot; Meanwhile , two leaders of Barrios Unidos , a broad-based effort to stop gang violence , showed_up at his office for lunch . Daniel ( Nane ) Alejandrez and Otilio ( O.T. ) Quintero , from Santa Cruz , had hit it off with Wallis two years ago during preparations for the Gang Summit , an attempt to broker a national truce among Crips , Bloods , Vice Lords , Black Disciples , Gangster Disciples , Black Souls , Cobras , Stones and Latin Kings . The Gang Summit , co-chaired by Alejandrez and by Fred Williams of the Common_Ground foundation of Los Angeles , was held last year in Kansas City . It had several moments of rage that were overcome by praying and gospel singing , and thus far the summit truce has exceeded many expectations . Not that Wallis didn ' t have his doubts about it , or about his role as an outside peacemaker . &quot; Most of the time I was the only white guy in the room . I could see the question in their eyes : ' What the hell is he doing here ? ' I felt I was being continually tested . I think the deciding factor , for me as well as for them , was where my home is . I ' ve been living_in a war zone for 20 years -- I know street violence , &quot; he told me . While Wallis worked the phones , I asked Alejandrez , a Vietnam veteran and onetime heroin_addict living_in the Santa Cruz barrios , what his first impression of Wallis had been . &quot; I don ' t remember meeting Jim , but I remember , later on , thinking , hey , this white guy , he ' s blending right in , &quot; he answered . Quintero added : &quot; Jim ' s not sanctimonious . He ' s not a guy from some foreign white world . He ' s like one of us. &quot; Alejandrez and Quintero , sporting business_suits and Cesar Chavez buttons , were scheduled to meet later in the day with sub-Cabinet officials of the Clinton_Administration . Their sudden high standing in Washington was owed , in part , to Wallis , who had helped underwrite their credibility as owners of small businesses . A few months ago , Wallis volunteered to help them obtain funding for a sloganeering-T-shirt enterprise and barrio-related computer software ; given their tattoos and their backgrounds , they were having no luck with commercial lenders . Wallis took the request to Gaylord Thomas , director of community services for the Evangelical Lutheran_Church of America , headquartered in Chicago . The selling job was not made any easier by the arrest of one of Wallis ' closest allies in the gang world , the Vice Lord leader Sharif Willis , implicated in the killing of a Minneapolis police_officer . While no charges were filed against Willis , the front-page headlines about the gang-related homicide in the Midwest reinforced an understandable nervousness about associating with gangs . Nonetheless , a $ 100 # 000 loan for Barrios Unidos from the Lutheran_church is being arranged . &quot; It was out of the respect and love I have for Jim that I went_ahead , &quot; Thomas , who is African American , told me . Having finally put_down the phone , Wallis explained in a matter-of-fact voice the state of emergency now surrounding Sojourners . Alejandrez stood_up and pulled Wallis into a big hug . &quot; You can ' t go_under , &quot; he said emotionally . &quot; You ' re the mouthpiece . We need you. &quot; Wallis looked straight at him . &quot; We will not go_under , &quot; he said . He may_not have the manner of the fiery televangelists , but the fire is there . Lunch , far behind schedule , was to be takeout chicken and Chinese vegetables . Wallis discussed economic development and how groups such_as Barrios Unidos could access a pot of gold , altogether about $ 35 billion , that exists in the pension_funds of Christian denominations . &quot; It ' s invested in blue-chip_stocks , doing absolutely no good for anybody except the blue-chip companies , &quot; Wallis said . &quot; If Jesus were_on Earth , he would tell the churches to give the whole $ 35 billion away , give it to the poor . All I ' m asking is for them to move it around a little , invest it in projects like yours. &quot; Might Wallis be able to tap into the pension_funds for his own organization ? &quot; No , probably not . You have to look far and wide for a source of money that we qualify for. &quot; Difficult as it is for someone stigmatized by the violence of gangs to raise money , it may be even more difficult for Wallis , the veteran pacifist . The ambiguity of Sojourners , in terms of standard political ideology , makes him an alien among the professional fund-raisers aligned with either the Christian Right or the public-interest Left . &quot; Sojourners falls between the cracks . We are anathema to both sides , &quot; he explained . &quot; The Christian Right will not help us because we talk_about racial and economic justice and are opposed to war ; the liberal-funding world is remarkably biased against religion. &quot; It is easy to understand why Wallis has found little common_ground with a Christian rightist like William J . Bennett , who codified the Republican vision of self-determination in his recent bestseller , &quot; The Book of Virtues. &quot; Bennett promulgates resistance to change , whereas Wallis seeks transformation and will settle for reform . Wallis traded point-and-counterpoint with Bennett in June at the Christian Booksellers convention in Denver . Said Bennett , calling_in by speaker phone : &quot; Why is it that Christians are not welcome in the national political debate ? &quot; Replied Wallis : &quot; Why is it that progressive evangelicals aren ' t welcome in the Christian debate ? &quot; Wallis has even less in common with Jerry L . Falwell , founder of the Moral Majority Inc. , with whom he also has tangled in public . Kindness to his enemies is considered one of Wallis ' political failings , but he had notably unkind words for Falwell : &quot; He is blustery , always interrupting , and he is combative where Bennett is scholarly. &quot; On the other hand , the estrangement between Wallis and the liberal establishment was to me a little less understandable . It is true that Wallis doesn ' t toe_the_line of pure liberalism ; his position on abortion , for example , is notably tortured . In his new book , he lets his female counterparts speak on the issue , and they come_down on the side that almost all abortion is immoral , but that criminalizing it is no answer . Wallis believes it should be society ' s goal to eliminate any need for abortion . But the Left ' s real problem with Wallis , according to the politically idiosyncratic author Garry Wills , who is a contributor to Sojourners magazine and something of a politial loner himself , is &quot; the learned liberal superstition that the separation of church and state must mean the separation of religion and politics. &quot; For Wallis ' part , he has taken pains to separate himself from the Left as well as the Right . &quot; ( Both ) have run their course and come_to a dead_end , &quot; he declares in the introduction of his new book . &quot; Liberalism is unable to articulate or demonstrate the kind of moral values that must undergird any serious movement of social transformation . . . . Conservatism still denies the reality of structural injustice and social oppression. &quot; Wallis was_on the phone again when our lunch was delivered . Alejandrez , Quintero and I ate off cracked china plates at a coffee_table . Hanging up , Wallis managed only two mouthfuls before another call interrupted . Linda Wertheimer , at National Public Radio , was asking him to rush over to the studio to be interviewed about Haiti . &quot; I don ' t have an easy solution for Haiti , &quot; he said , &quot; but OK. &quot; We piled into one of the Sojourners vehicles , a pickup_truck , and crossed into downtown Washington , the well-dressed Alejandrez and Quintero acting_out an impromptu bit of mad-lark theater from their perch on wheel rims in back , scanning the streets and playing the part of Secret_Service agents . At that moment President Clinton was hours away from a televised speech announcing a countdown to an invasion of Haiti . Bob Dole , the Republican leader of the U.S. Senate , had already declared his opposition , saying : &quot; I don ' t think invading Haiti . . . is worth one American life. &quot; Most Democrats , however , justified an invasion as a necessary evil in the furtherance of democracy . This was the point Wertheimer tried to drive_home in her interview with Wallis , and , listening , I began to have a better understanding of the difficulties he poses for anyone who wants to define things with neat political labels . Even while dismissing Dole ' s view ( &quot; I hear racism in that statement &quot; ) , Wallis criticized Clinton for trying to make the ends justify the means . The issue for Wallis was that an invasion would cost lives , American and Haitian . &quot; People are going_to die . I can ' t defend that. &quot; His belief in the sanctity of life is one of the constants on which he has predicated politics for nearly 30 years . Wertheimer , who clearly accepted the inevitability of a military invasion , grew exasperated with Wallis and demanded that he come_up with an alternative . Reluctant to add_to his criticism of Clinton , of whom Wallis is generally respectful , he allowed , &quot; It ' s an agonizing decision. &quot; But then , pressed further , Wallis took_a_breath and laid_out his solution . He spoke in a clear baritone ; his stutter had disappeared as soon as he entered the radio booth . &quot; Well , some of us have been talking_about a different kind of invasion , an unarmed invasion of religious_leaders . Why not send_in a boatload of ministers and teachers with several tons of food ? I think you could find enough of us who would put our lives on the line. &quot; Realpolitik , Wallis style . Wertheimer wasn ' t buying it . She talked right past him and ushered us out with a tight smile : &quot; We might be able to use some of it. &quot; On our way_out , a tanned , easily recognized man joined us in the elevator : George McGovern , just back from talks in Cuba with Fidel Castro . Wallis extended a hand , &quot; Hello , senator. &quot; After a_few seconds sorting through his memories , McGovern said delightedly , &quot; Jim Wallis . You were the seminarian who was banned from campus. &quot; In 1970 , after making a radical name for himself in anti-war and civil-rights protests at Michigan State University , Wallis enrolled for postgraduate studies at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield , Ill . There he organized prayer vigils for Vietnam peace , which he justified to his professors with neglected passages of the Bible . Alumni tried to have him expelled , and at nearby Wheaton College , another conservative Christian school where he also spoke against the war , he was banned from subsequent formal speaking engagements . In 1972 , when an anti-war McGovern , himself a former seminarian , challenged Nixon for the presidency , Wallis brashly volunteered to arrange for a candidates ' night at Wheaton . Wallis sneaked onto the campus ( &quot; I had to go_by night like Nicodemus &quot; ) and persuaded the student government to ask both Nixon and McGovern to appear . Richard Nixon declined the invitation , so McGovern got his chance alone . McGovern seemed to impress the superpatriotic Wheaton students , although the presidential election was a lost cause . After his defeat , McGovern sought counsel from a number of religious_leaders , including Wallis . &quot; He was extremely , extremely downhearted . I remember saying to him , young as I was , ' Well , senator , this might be a backward step , but it ' s only one step_in a long struggle . You have to carry_on , ' &quot; he said , smiling at his earnestness . Since age 14 , Wallis had known he wanted to turn his life into a mission . It was not at the urging of his parents , who , although they were founders of a Bible-based church , had raised him in Little_League and Boy_Scouts and public_school . &quot; To them , faith was a personal act . They didn ' t relate it to people ' s suffering on the larger scale of war or racism . But I kept asking , why do we live_in this nice little white , middle-class enclave , while a mile away , black people are living_in slums ? Eventually I got_in so_much trouble with my parents ' church over this issue that I spent my teen-age years attending black churches in Detroit. &quot; Wallis never got a degree at Trinity , probably much to that institution ' s relief . After the anti-war movement was rendered moot and the civil-rights movement finished its heyday , Wallis tried to figure_out what to do with the rest of his life . He came_up with a list of essentials . He wanted to establish a national forum for the discussion of religion and social_action ; he wanted to provide a place for spiritual renewal , a nondenominational church ; he wanted to live tribally among friends and colleagues , and there would have to be a way in which he could do service to the poor . Among the ' 60s generation , there were a lot of namby-pamby , would n ' t-it-be-nice approaches to doing_good . Wallis , the quintessential idealist , took a more pragmatic approach and succeeded . Forming the Sojourners group with friends from Trinity , Wallis located first in Chicago , then , as of 1975 , in the Fourteenth Street corridor . Five years later , as the high-living -- some might say greedy -- ' 80s kicked_off , Wallis would be leading a community of about 45 , who pooled their income , mostly from Sojourners magazine , which had a circulation of 45 # 000 . Dozens of neighborhood residents would flock every Sunday to Sojourners services , which were nondenominational and led by lay pastors . A day-care center would be up and running , and Wallis would tell a Washington Post reporter , &quot; We ' ve become a fixture in landlord-tenant court. &quot; From time to time , Wallis is asked by strangers if he has ever contemplated pulling_up his roots in the corridor . &quot; Yes , I ' ve thought_of getting_out , &quot; he tells them , in much the same way you or I might say we ' ve thought at times of being Good_Samaritans ourselves in a place like Columbia Heights . In the abstract , you can fool yourself into believing that Wallis is not so different from the rest of us . That is especially so if , like me , you came_of_age in the ' 60s . Wallis and I have lived_in proximity most of our lives , growing_up in similar Michigan households , protesting the war on Michigan campuses , even getting tear-gassed in 1969 at a stop-the-war protest in Washington . Both of us became writers and settled in the capital . However , Wallis has always resided inside the city_limits , and I outside them , just 10 miles apart , but a distance that constitutes a world of difference . After I met Wallis , the abstract became concrete : He is not likely to move_out of the 14th Street corridor , and I am not likely to move_in . At the Sojourners office , a piece of good news had arrived -- the likelihood of $ 25 # 000 in short-term credit . Wallis , who has a good Midwesterner ' s aversion to debt and a conservative ' s sense of self-responsibility , began immediately to scheme about ways to repay the loan . Perhaps the new book would bring_in a bonanza of new members . &quot; We could use that cash to pay it off , &quot; he said . &quot; Or we could use that cash to pay_off the rest of our bills so we ' re not all bald by Christmas from tearing out our hair , &quot; interjected Elizabeth Holler Hunter , the thin , tense-looking director of development for Sojourners . She was trying to be flip , but her voice was all worry . &quot; By Christmas , this will all seem like a bad dream , I hope , &quot; Wallis said , patting her shoulder . A man in Wallis ' position is obliged to be reassuring , to make things appear stable . But there is nothing stable about day-to-day existence for Sojourners or the corridor . Life in these communities will always be life on the edge . When Wallis first moved_into Columbia Heights , many houses were boarded_up , and 9 of 10 of the others were occupied by African-American renters . Today , there are significantly more property_owners , but there is greater enmity . &quot; Now there are warring factions : the Latino immigrants against the African Americans , the white homeowners against the tenants . The tensions are very high , &quot; Barbara Tamialis , who is Wallis ' sister , told me . The prematurely silver-haired Tamialis , who is a year younger than her brother , has lived_in the corridor as part of Sojourners from the beginning . She directs the Neighborhood Center . With her husband , Jim , a high_school math instructor and the guitar_player at Sojouners services , she has raised three children in the corridor and now is valiantly raising two more , an 8-year-old adopted as an infant and a 9-year-old rescued from the foster-care system . A decision was made to send the three oldest Tamialis kids to public_schools outside the corridor . The reasons were practical ones . &quot; Our children always played with the neighborhood kids , &quot; their mother said , &quot; but the teachers were teaching them to hit back while we were teaching them not to hit . And the schools were at a lower level. &quot; For all_the adversities that the Tamialis family has suffered over the years , their row_house broken_into and so forth , and for all_the violence visited upon neighborhood children they have watched grow_up and die , they are not drawn to the suburbs . &quot; It ' s not nirvana out there . The suicide rate is higher in the suburbs . Wherever you live , you pick your poison , &quot; Barbara Tamialis said . &quot; There are different pluses to the suburbs , but also different minuses . When you add it all up , I do not consider living here a sacrifice. &quot; The fact remains , though , that the life Wallis has chosen -- not just the mean streets , but also the times in jail , the risks to life and limb in far-off places , the denial of security and many creature comforts -- is a reminder of why the ranks of priesthoods are often filled by loners . Not until a_few years ago did Wallis marry , after falling_in_love with a young_woman who happened to join Sojourners . Now divorced from her , he will not talk for the public record about his marriage , except to say &quot; it has been the most painful chapter of my life. &quot; Wallis has friends inside Sojourners , some as close as family , and he has blood_relatives there in the Tamialises ( &quot; There are days when I truly thank God for Barbara and Jim &quot; ) . At times he has had house mates ; once , after trying unsuccessfully to prevent the eviction of a neighbor and her son , he ended_up sharing his house with them for several months . Yet the sum of his personal existence today is that he is a middle-aged man who finishes his day alone , the music up loud . One day after Wallis suggested at NPR that the Clinton_Administration consider an unarmed invasion of Haiti , former President Jimmy_Carter , the most prominent of America ' s progressive evangelicals , began negotiations on Clinton ' s behalf . The Carter-led talks in Haiti avoided a war but drew ridicule from many conservatives and not a_few liberals who claimed that the former President , while saving lives , had let moral issues dominate the national interest , undercutting Clinton ' s strong-arm policies . Wallis has also been accused of naively choosing the human over the political . I asked him whether tipping the balance in such a direction doesn ' t make the U.S._government appear weak and indecisive . &quot; Governments are fully capable of looking_after their own interests . The balance is always tipped_in their favor . Governments are survivors . Politicians are survivors . It ' s the people who do the dying -- usually to pay_for the sins of the politicians -- and they need all_the advocacy they can get , &quot; he said to me . The U.S. soldiers who finally landed on Haiti , while under orders to shoot if necessary , represented less a conquering force than a band of guidance counselors and security_guards -- which was , I realized , a not unreasonable variation of the solution Wallis had put_forward . And as it turned_out , in Haiti at least , Carter and Wallis -- not to mention Bill_Clinton -- would be redeemed . On the Sunday evening before Wallis was to depart on his book tour , the Sojourners congregation gathered for services , sitting on folding_chairs in the living room of the old crackhouse . On a cloth-covered table there was a loaf_of_bread and a pitcher of grape_juice , and on the wall a peace-dove banner . For most of a month , Wallis had been soliciting money . &quot; We are a family , and we ' ve all been worried about what ' s going_to happen to us , &quot; he said in his preacher ' s voice , sans stutter , rocking on his toes at a wooden lectern . &quot; We ' ve raised $ 40 # 000 so far , but I ' m exhausted at the thought of all we have to raise to keep our little ministry going. &quot; Outside , somewhere in the corridor , a woman screamed . Wallis went_on . &quot; And , I will tell you truthfully , I am also exhausted from all_the anger and violence and political polarization we see in Washington every day . I can feel the flood rising , and I wonder , can we stop it ? &quot; In the weeks since we had met , Wallis seemed to have aged noticeably . Some of his hollow look was from lack of sleep , but a lot of it was the strain of holding together his host of quixotic endeavors . Wallis might be devoid_of cynicism , I had come_to realize , but he is not someone untouched by life . After the services I asked him what he planned to do next . &quot; Buy a couple pairs of socks and a toothbrush and get my weary butt ready for this book tour . I can raise money from the road if I have to , &quot; he said , flashing a strangely upbeat smile . What , after all this time , keeps him going ? &quot; that ' s a good question , &quot; he said . &quot; I know many people admire the work I do , but most of them think I ' m crazy . All I can tell you is I ' m doing the work I ' ve always wanted to do . Call it the Lord ' s work , call it anything you like . For me , that ' s enough. &quot;</TEXT>
