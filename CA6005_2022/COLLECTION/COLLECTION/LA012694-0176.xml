   <HEADLINE> RADIATION TESTS STILL GO ON , O ' LEARY SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary said Tuesday that the government continues to sponsor radiation experiments involving human subjects but that none is being done_in secret or without the informed consent of participants . The acknowledgment came_in testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee , which is investigating radiation experiments performed by the government , often on unwitting participants , in the 1940s and ' 50s.O ' Leary told committee_members that the full extent and nature of those experiments probably would not be determined for at least a year . But she added that all_of the information eventually would be made public . O ' Leary said that the Energy_Department now is either funding or providing facilities for between 200 and 260 experiments , about 40 % of which are believed to involve radiation . Most of the current experimentation involves the use of low tracer doses in nuclear medicine research , she said . None of the experiments are being conducted in secret or in violation of ethical guidelines -- in_effect since 1991 -- that govern the terms of such experiments on humans , she said . &quot; We ' re pretty certain that everyone is following the spirit and intent &quot; of the ethics guidelines , she said . O ' Leary said that as a precautionary measure President Clinton will issue a directive this week ordering a halt to any classified experiments involving radiation and human subjects . But she said she does not believe that such experimentation is under way . &quot; As far as we have been able to ascertain , the department is not conducting any experiments that violate medical ( or ) ethical standards , &quot; she said . The hearing is the first in what is expected to be several congressional inquiries into disclosures that unsuspecting subjects were used as human guinea_pigs for government-sponsored radiation experiments during the Cold_War .</TEXT>
