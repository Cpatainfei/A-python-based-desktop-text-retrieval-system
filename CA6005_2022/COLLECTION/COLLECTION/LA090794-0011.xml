   <HEADLINE> THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT JACKPOT ; RIDICULOUS LEGAL AWARDS AND BAD LAWS WON ' T FILL IN FOR SOCIETAL RESTRAINTS . WOMEN SHOULD SPEAK UP FOR THEMSELVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Of all_the legal jargon we ' ve recently created in an attempt to compensate for the moral_principles jettisoned over the last 30 years , no term is more absurd than sexual_harassment . People , just like other members of the animal_kingdom , are attracted to one another to ensure perpetuation of the species . Since sexual attraction is such a powerful drive , civilizations have evolved cultural norms to modulate it , and these norms are flouted only at great risk . To put it another way , sex is fun , but it can have some unanticipated results , and societies must come_up with taboos to minimize their occurrence . In days of yore , a guy had to be ready to put unanticipated results through college or at least to teach them the family_business before he indulged . Girls didn ' t get_off easily either . They were instructed to wear appropriate clothing to avoid &quot; leading a guy on &quot; and to eschew excessive indulgence in certain beverages lest their innate modesty be washed_away . Most people played by the rules . Then came the sexual revolution . Equality demanded that women be free to have_sex whenever and with whomever they wished . Men no longer felt responsibility because women had all_the tools to prevent any unintended results of the sex_act . All of this new freedom was heady except for one thing : Women were perceived as having surrendered their moral right to societal protection . Overstepping the boundaries was no longer possible ; there were no boundaries . So women sought protection from unwanted sexual intrusions through the courts . And thus was born the term sexual_harassment . Now , I don ' t believe anyone , male or female , should have to tolerate behavior that makes them uncomfortable . Good manners demand that all_of us try to respect one another ' s feelings . But we do seem to be overdoing it a little when it comes_to taking offense from certain words , gestures and touches . ( Rape is a crime of a totally different dimension and is certainly not to be considered in the same arena as sexual harassment. ) Take the case of the 40-year-old San Francisco secretary who just hit the jackpot in her suit against a lawyer alleged to have inappropriately touched her and to have made lewd comments . This lady was able to extract from her touchy boss and all 1 # 700 of his legal associates $ 7.1 million in punitive damages . I suspect that most of those associates had no desire to similarly grope her and were guilty of only the remotest of associations with the defendant . Yet all were punished . This case , if upheld , could establish a legal precedent with the force of law . And speaking_of laws , one sits on the desk of Gov . Pete Wilson at this very moment . Apparently groups like the National Organization for Women , California Women Lawyers and others feel that there is little recourse when people other_than one ' s employer grope or make lewd comments . Infliction of emotional distress being a hard thing to prove , they ' ve opted to push for a law making actionable unwelcome sexual comments uttered in the course of a professional relationship such_as dentist-patient or collection service-debtor , if the plaintiff has requested that these comments cease . Note that no groping need take_place . The clear implication in this law is a sexist one , namely that males are the professionals and females the clients . In point of fact , most women doctors in a recent study reported instances of &quot; sexual_harassment &quot; by one or more of their patients . According to this law , these physicians could sue their patients for three times the financial_loss they incur through this harassment . But who would be sued ? The patient ' s managed-care plan ? Blue Cross / Blue Shield ? Medicare ? Badly written laws that attempt to make_up for the shortcomings of a society that has thrown_away its natural decorum concerning sexual matters can only do more harm than good . They make people vulnerable to false accusations , present the risk that misinterpretation of a casual comment may result in litigation and promote the Victorian image of women as frail and fragile flowers who swoon when four-letter_words are in the air . Let ' s fight the battle that needs to be fought , for equality of opportunity . But let ' s not get sidetracked in the process . If you ' re lucky enough to elicit admiration from the opposite sex but find this admiration unwelcome , well , you ' ve got a tongue ! If things get physical , there already are laws to protect you . And lest I be justly accused of chauvinism , let me add that you buff guys who silently suffer the unladylike stares and comments of female escrow loan officers and financial planners have recourse even if Sen . Tom Hayden ' s bill escapes Wilson ' s pen , as do those undergoing same-sex &quot; harassment. &quot; Lets all treat each other with respect and common_sense and cease this legal demonization of those whose chromosomes may be a little different from our own .</TEXT>
