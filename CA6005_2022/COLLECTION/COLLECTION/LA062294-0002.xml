   <HEADLINE> PROTESTS AND TOASTS GREET ROYAL VISITORS ; DIVERSITY : THE JAPANESE IMPERIAL COUPLE MEET A RICH VARIETY OF LOCAL LEADERS . ASIAN AMERICAN MARCHERS DEMAND REPARATIONS FOR WAR_CRIMES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko have been working hard in their United States visit to pay tribute to the diversity of America . But in Los Angeles , the Japanese royal couple have been encountering even more of it than was scheduled . At City_Hall , hundreds of people of Chinese , Korean , Filipino and Vietnamese descent demanded an apology for Japanese war_crimes . In Little Tokyo , Latino workers at a Japanese-owned hotel appealed for the emperor to support their union , holding_up a sign_in Japanese and trying to present a letter to him . And nearby , young_men from Japan shouted a tribute of banzai -- in American gangsta-style baggy pants and baseball_caps . None of the protesters -- or well-wishers , for that matter -- got near the imperial couple . Their close encounters with the diversity of the city were entirely over the clink of fine crystal . There was , for example , a luncheon with the mayor atop the Transamerica building Tuesday . The guest list of 100 was designed to let the emperor see the rich variety of leaders here . At one typical table , Latina businesswoman Ana Barbosa , Bruce Ramer of the American Jewish Committee and Joe Hicks of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference sat together . &quot; I ' m delighted to meet with leaders from a cross-section . . . of Los Angeles , &quot; said the emperor in a toast . &quot; I ( hear ) with much interest that Los Angeles ' community is made of people with various and diverse cultural backgrounds. &quot; The task of the unfailingly statesmanlike emperor has been to mend fences torn_apart by the clumsy personnel management of Japanese corporations in the United States , by boorish Japanese politicians who blame minorities for American social problems , and by Japanese intellectuals churning_out bestsellers spouting anti-Semitic conspiracies . And to some degree , it ' s working . &quot; The wounds are still deep ( from past insults ) , &quot; Hicks told a reporter . &quot; ( But ) I ' m encouraged by these remarks . The more interaction there can be between highly placed Japanese officials and African Americans who are clearly in the mainstream and influential people , the better. &quot; Japanese doing business in Los Angeles could tell the emperor a_few things about the influence of powerful African Americans . It was an African American -- former mayor Tom Bradley -- who aggressively forged ties with Japan that helped build Los Angeles over the last two decades into an international trading giant . He focused so_much on Asia , in fact , that some of his constituents accused him of ignoring his own back yard . Bradley was among the guests at a gala black-tie dinner for 650 at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Monday night , as well as at Riordan ' s lunch . At the dinner , the emperor and empress were welcomed in speeches by Gov . Pete Wilson and Arco Chairman Lodwrick M . Cook . But it was Yvonne Brathwaite Burke , chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors -- and an African American woman -- who gave the most personal welcome , noting the long history of Japanese Americans in her district and the sister city ties between her district and Ibaraki , Japan . Many other Angelenos , however , feel far less friendly toward Japan because of its lack of apology for its aggression and atrocities in Asia during World_War_II . About 400 Asian Americans marched from Chinatown to City_Hall to the Japanese Consulate to demand that Japan pay reparations to victims of crimes against humanity during World_War_II . At the head of the protest_march , which snaked for an entire city_block , white-clad Korean musicians played ceremonial drums . Their protests were addressed to the emperor , but they didn ' t try to approach him , instead focusing_on the consulate . &quot; I want you to come_down and get_on your knees and apologize for what you ' ve done , &quot; yelled 70-year-old Jom Jo Lee , aiming her bullhorn at the Bunker_Hill skyscraper where the consulate is ensconced . Lee , who said he was forced into slave labor in Japan during World_War_II , waved a placard that said &quot; Japan Is the Asian Nazis. &quot; Many of the protesters said they had firsthand experience with Japanese atrocities . Yuh Fan Sung , 75 , carried a handmade ink drawing that showed the scene in his hometown of Shen-yang in northeast China on the day that the Japanese invaded . Sun was 19 years old and witnessed Chinese civilians lining_up to be shot by Japanese soldiers . Heads of decapitated Chinese hung from walls . Sung ' s black-and-gray drawing was carefully inked with red to show blood dripping from severed heads . &quot; I can ' t forgive what the Japanese did to my city , &quot; Sung said Tuesday . But other protesters , too young to remember the war directly , said the issue still burns in their hearts . &quot; My parents told me a lot about the war , &quot; said Daniel Wang , 30 , who skipped out from his Downtown job to join the demonstration . &quot; These are things no one can forget , even my children and their children. &quot; Akihito was a child during World_War_II , but the protesters are asking him to take responsibility for making_peace among the next generation by apologizing and making reparations . It was during the reign of Akihito ' s father , Hirohito , that the atrocities occurred , but ironically , when Hirohito visited in 1975 , demands for apologies and reparation were not reported by the press . There were protests , to be sure . But they were by Japanese Americans upset at Japanese investment in Little Tokyo displacing local people , and by Koreans focusing_on Japanese and U.S. support for the military government in South_Korea . The Asian American population in 1975 was far smaller and less diverse than today -- and less politically sophisticated . Today , a new generation of Asian Americans -- who speak English , are media-savvy and well-organized -- are overcoming their differences to press demands . Japanese American groups , with a long history in the United States , have helped lead the politicization of Asian Americans through their fight for U.S._government reparations for the internment_camps of World_War_II . David Monkawa , an organizer of that effort , said it ' s only natural that Japanese Americans support Asians seeking redress from another government . Japanese Americans are also active in pressing Japanese corporations to act responsibly in the United States -- in part because anger against Japanese companies often is taken_out on Americans of Japanese descent . Glenn Omatsu , a staff_member of the UCLA Asian American Studies Center , was marching with Latino workers trying to unionize the Japanese-owned New Otani hotel . &quot; The owners of the New Otani are certainly not promoting the image of Japan , and they ' re certainly not promoting inter-ethnic harmony , &quot; Omatsu said . &quot; Maybe the emperor can intercede on our behalf , &quot; said Argelia Ortiz , a cashier and union backer . Despite all_the activity on the street , the emperor and empress sailed serenely through the day , she in a beige kimono , he in a dark gray suit . At the Japanese American Culture and Community_Center , they met with Japanese Americans bringing not labor demands but expressions of friendship and shared cultural ties . And perhaps the most relaxing part of the day came at the beginning , when they visited an exhibition on Abraham_Lincoln and the lush gardens of the Huntington Library in San Marino . Even here , the painful roots of America ' s diversity were_on display , in historic posters advertising slaves for_sale . But the imperial couple seemed fascinated by the material , lingering_over an original manuscript of the Gettysburg Address and the Emancipation Proclamation . * Times staff writer Patrick J .
