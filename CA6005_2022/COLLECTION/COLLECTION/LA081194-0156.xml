   <HEADLINE> SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY ; IN THE GREEN ; THE GROWING HEALTH_FOOD FIELD IS PROVING LUCRATIVE FOR SOME COMPANIES , BUT THEIR CLAIMS ARE BEING QUESTIONED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At Sunrider International in Torrance , founder Tei Fu Chen talks_of a world where people adhere to the &quot; Philosophy of Regeneration , &quot; living_on a diet of herbal foods that cleanse each of the body ' s systems . He got the idea from centuries-old traditions he studied in Chinese texts . At another Torrance company , Green Foods Corp . founder Yoshihide Hagiwara works_on his late wife ' s cells , searching for a cure for cancer , the disease that killed her . His solution : antioxidants derived from green barley_grass . Their research may be exotic , but the natural methods they are using already have made them millions of dollars . The men run two of the South Bay ' s fastest-growing health_food companies , capitalizing on a craze for natural foods ranging from grass-derived drinks to ginseng . Their work has won praise from politicians , celebrities and athletes . Golfer Arnold Palmer drinks Green Foods ' Green Magma , as does actress Jodie Foster . Last year , former Gov . George Deukmejian and then-Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert appeared at the grand opening of Sunrider ' s new headquarters and gave the company high marks for adding jobs in a dire economy . But the combination of health and wealth has also ignited a national debate over just how far health_food companies can go_in the claims they make about their products . &quot; Free_enterprise is great , but none of us want to be ripped_off , &quot; said Dan Walsh , food and drug fraud program specialist for the state_Department of Health Services . &quot; We want legitimate businesses that will build here for a while , that will be here in 20 years. &quot; He points_out actions filed by federal and state regulators in the late 1980s to restrict both Sunrider and Green Foods from boasting that their products could help relieve a host of ills . Walsh and several consumer groups oppose a bill pending before Congress that would prohibit the federal Food and Drug Administration from treating any dietary supplement as a drug or food_additive , making_it easier for manufacturers to make health claims . But health_food companies , their marketing departments and loyal customers say they are victims of a medical and government establishment that has failed to recognize the benefits of these products . They point to FDA efforts to restrict some herbal ingredients . &quot; Everybody should have freedom of choice to choose what kind of foods they want to eat instead of ( being ) regulated by the government_agency , &quot; said Chen , the founder of Sunrider . &quot; They try to control everything . They hope . . . if you want to eat rice , you have to get a prescription. &quot; His company calls its approach &quot; The Philosophy of Regeneration , &quot; nourishing the body ' s five major systems -- endocrine , digestive , respiratory , immune and circulatory -- with herbal formulas that include Chinese ginseng , dandelion root and licorice_root . Chen ' s goal is to use modern techniques to create herbal food_products that are rooted in ancient traditions . &quot; Rather than regulate the body ( with medicines ) , we can nourish it , and let it regulate itself , &quot; said Chen , who came_to the United States from Taiwan in 1974 . Critics say Chen ' s emphasis on ancient traditions is just a marketing technique that gives the company ' s herbal foods and cosmetics a greater mystique than others on the market . &quot; If you look_at the health_food movement , it really has religious overtones , &quot; said Mark Meskin , director of the nutrition program at USC School_of_Medicine . &quot; A lot of the lingo is about detoxification and purification . They sound great , but we already have a detoxification system on board . that ' s what the liver is. &quot; But Chen says his network of 300 # 000 independent distributors &quot; are not herb food nuts. &quot; They work in a multilevel marketing system like that established by Amway , and &quot; are people devoted to wellness , to good health. &quot; * Company officials say much of the skepticism comes from the clash of rigid Western ideas with Eastern traditions . They say that their marketing stops short of offering cures , but the company ' s products can benefit the body . &quot; We think the FDA ought not to solely judge things on the Western approach to science , &quot; said Bob Henrie , Sunrider ' s marketing manager . &quot; We do believe that herbs are good for the system . This a strong body of evidence based on 5 # 000 years of science. &quot; But the company came under_fire in the late 1980s for its claims . According to a 1989 suit filed by the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office , the company said in its Sunwriter magazine that its Nutrien and other products had an effect on heart_disease and pneumonia , and Sunrider salespeople said that the products had an effect on high_blood_pressure . In one case , the company listed Vitamin B-8 on its Nutrien food packages . No such vitamin exists , the suit said . The district_attorney obtained a consent agreement forbidding Sunrider from making unsubstantiated claims that its products have any effect on diseases or medical conditions . Sunrider admitted no wrongdoing , but paid $ 175 # 000 in penalties . Still , some of the company ' s distributors did not immediately stop making claims about the products , according to Stephen Barrett , a retired psychiatrist and author of the upcoming book &quot; The Vitamin Pushers. &quot; A Texas Sunrider distributor phoned him in 1990 and claimed that Sunrider products helped him and other family members who had arthritis , Barrett said . Company officials , however , say distributors must sign forms agreeing not to make false claims about the products . &quot; We focus_on wellness , we focus_on health and not disease , &quot; Henrie said . Making &quot; claims doesn ' t succeed much . People won ' t purchase the product on a sustained basis if it doesn ' t work. &quot; Sunrider has also been sued over its products . In 1989 , U.S. judo champion James Martin filed suit against the company after he failed a drug test that disqualified him for the 1988 Olympic team . Martin said the Olympic Drug Testing Center found ephedrine , a stimulant banned by the Olympic committee , in Sunrider Action Caps , an energy product he had taken . Sunrider did not admit any wrongdoing , but settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed sum . In another lawsuit , Phoenix resident Debi Boling claimed that she purchased an herbal weight-loss medicine from Sunrider that contained rat poison and lead . According to court records , she lost her hair and suffered gastrointestinal problems . A federal_District Court jury in Phoenix agreed and awarded her $ 650 # 000 in damages after a 1992 trial . The company says that it has found a new piece of evidence : Boling ' s ex-husband Ken Andrews told a private_investigator that he tainted the food in a scheme to defraud the company . But a U.S. District Court judge refused to overturn the judgment , saying the evidence was not sworn testimony . Sunrider is appealing his decision . * Publicity over the trial proved troublesome for Chen . Company sales literature included in court files claimed that Chen was the owner of manuscripts that contained Chinese herbal-medicine secrets dating_back 5 # 000 years . It said Chen ' s great-grandfather , a guard at the Emperor ' s Palace in Beijing , obtained the texts during the Boxer Rebellion and passed them down through the Chen family . In an affidavit , however , Chen ' s father said he had no knowledge of his son ' s story about the documents . He also refuted some of the claims made in the company ' s sales literature about the younger Chen . Among them : that he was a sickly , impoverished child until the herbal formulas transformed him into the two-time kung_fu champion of Taiwan and , later , a Chinese medical doctor . The father said Chen was a healthy child and was not trained as a doctor . In a deposition , the younger Chen said that he could not recall where his kung_fu medals were , and could not specifically name where the championships were won . The company also has said that Chen is not a doctor in the Western sense , but it &quot; is the Chinese custom and tradition that a person with ( Chen ' s ) experience , education and traditional training to be referred to as doctor. &quot; Chen has an honorary doctorate degree from the Chinese Culture University in Taiwan . The story about the manuscripts , Chen said in a deposition , was a &quot; legend. &quot; But Chen insists that he does have texts , which are 100 to 300 years old and include information gathered over 5 # 000 years . &quot; My attitude is to say , ' So what ? ' &quot; Henrie added . &quot; People are not joining Sunrider based on what transcripts he has in his possession . . . . The issues raised , in my mind , are diversionary issues . There are some that compete in this business by attempting to discredit others. &quot; Chen says one such company is E . Excel International Inc. , a Utah health_food company and competitor that is run_by his sister , Jau Fe . The company in 1992 mailed letters to Sunrider ' s distributors , informing them of the judgment in the Arizona case . The motive , Chen said , was to &quot; be a success without starting from the beginning . What is the easiest way ? The best way is to knock me down. &quot; In any case , publicity about the cases hardly cut_into the company ' s sales . Revenue has steadily climbed in the past five years , to $ 350 million in 1993 , Chen said . It now employs 150 people in Torrance and 500 at its manufacturing operations in the City of Industry . The company also has its world headquarters , a futuristic , green glass building featuring indoor streams and herbal gardens , a movie_theater and museum of Chinese artifacts . Skeptics have also criticized Green Foods , which makes the barley products . But that company ' s sales have climbed ever since its Green Magma powdered drink was first introduced in the United States 14 years ago . On a visit to Green Foods headquarters in a Torrance industrial_park , founder Hagiwara , 68 , holds_up a Japanese tabloid that displays his photo . It trumpets his resolve to live to be 129 by eating natural foods . &quot; Just about every food you eat , you can ' t help but get a pollutant chemical in your body , &quot; said Hagiwara , who runs the company from Osaka , Japan . &quot; You need something to remove the toxics. &quot; Green Foods ' U.S. sales in 1993 were $ 50 million , primarily through distribution in health_food stores as Green Magma and through multilevel marketers as Barley Green . And customers swear by it . &quot; I live for my Green Magma , &quot; said Janice L . Green , 35 , a Lomita photographer who takes it six times a day and says it cleans toxins from her body . &quot; When I don ' t have it and go running , I ' m dragging the rest of the day. &quot; The company promotes the non-chemical means of making its products , harvested and processed at an Oxnard plant that employs about 50 people . Instead of pesticides , it uses ladybugs that eat smaller pests . Five acres of the grass are harvested a day . Standing on the Oxnard factory floor , Takahiko Amano , who runs the company ' s U.S. operations , explained how the juice drink is created . The barley is grown nearby on 120 acres of fields the company owns or leases . Then , specialized equipment crushes the grass , extracts juice and dehydrates it . The story of how Hagiwara stumbled on barley as a dietary supplement dates_back to the 1950s , when he became wealthy from a product he created to treat athlete ' s foot . The formula contained mercury , a toxic ingredient . Hagiwara said that he and others were unaware of the heavy metal ' s harmful effects until his hair turned prematurely gray , he lost his teeth and skin came_off his hands . The Japanese government banned the ingredient in 1962 . The experience made him wary of synthetically produced medicines . So he set_out to find a natural substance that could make the body healthier . Observing that cows yielded more milk when they ate certain greens , he went_on a mission to see which plants could have similar energizing benefits for humans . At a kitchen laboratory at his home_in Osaka , he sampled hundreds of greens -- from bamboo leaves to chickweed -- before he settled_on the leaves of barley . The leaves , he says , contain enzymes , vitamins and proteins . &quot; All the possible nutrients , &quot; Hagiwara said , &quot; you name it , it ' s in there. &quot; In 1970 , he started marketing the product in Japan . &quot; There was very strong rejection from the medical and drug industry , &quot; he said . &quot; They were saying , ' These are the things that the cows and the horses live_on . that ' s not something that the humans should eat. ' &quot; * Nutritionists in the United States echoed the criticisms when the product was introduced here in 1980 . Many questioned whether Green Magma -- which sells for about $ 26 per box -- is any better than any other form of greens . Green Foods promotes the product ' s concentration of chlorophyll , the green pigment in plants . In a press_release , the company says that it stimulates the healing and regeneration of tissue and is a natural detoxifier . ( Sunrider also markets a chlorophyll product , Evergreen , that it says helps eliminate body_odor and bad breath. ) Chlorophyll , however , has no role in human nutrition , argues William Jarvis , president of the National Council Against Health Fraud and a professor at Loma Linda University . Its benefits , if any , would be lost in digestion , he said . &quot; To me , it ' s kind of a laugh , &quot; Jarvis said of Green Foods ' claims . &quot; People sell things so enthusiastically , they don ' t know when to quit. &quot; Green Magma &quot; is a fairly harmless mess , &quot; said USC ' s Meskin . But he fears that people who use the product will stop conventional treatment for diseases . &quot; That is when it is a dangerous problem. &quot; In 1989 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned Green Foods to stop marketing their product as a way to eliminate a host of ailments , including diabetes , acne , asthma and high_blood_pressure . * The critics have not deterred Hagiwara from searching for a cure for cancer through his Hagiwara Institute of Health in Osaka . He was researching treatments for cancer in 1981 when his wife was diagnosed with uterine cancer . But he was far from getting regulatory approval to use his cancer antibodies . &quot; I was desperate , &quot; he said . &quot; But to go_through regular channels , it takes 10 years. &quot; So he tested the antibodies on himself first , and then on his son . Then he injected the antibodies into his wife , he said , in the presence of her doctors . But it was too late . She died in 1983 . &quot; The X-ray showed that the cancer stopped spreading in the lung , &quot; he said . &quot; There was some effect. &quot; Since then , he and his son , Hideaki , have obtained a research contract with UC Davis in which they use his wife ' s cells . Among their findings : that green barley inhibits &quot; lipid oxidation , &quot; the oxidizing process in all living matter that hastens the destruction of the immune_system . Researchers at UC Davis are also studying the antioxidants in other foods , including brewed coffee and even cooked beefsteak . The National Council Against Health Fraud ' s Jarvis says that the research on antioxidants is far from conclusive . &quot; Antioxidants are enjoying their own mythology , &quot; he said . Nevertheless , Hagiwara vows to continue his research and to convince doubters with more studies . He predicts that today ' s naysayers will come_to accept Green Magma , even use it themselves . &quot; Every single household will have this , &quot; he said at a conference_table where several of his employees had glasses of the green liquid , which smells like newly mowed grass and tastes like tea . &quot; Just like every household has Coca-Cola as a drink , we are going_to market it as an ideal fast food. &quot; Sunrider ' s Chen sees a global future for his company ' s products , including untapped markets in China and Russia and in countries of South_America . But he ' s also not missing out on a product common to the back yards of Southern California . Just introduced : &quot; Dr. Chen ' s Secret Sauce &quot; for barbecuing .</TEXT>
