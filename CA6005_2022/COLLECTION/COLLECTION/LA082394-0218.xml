   <HEADLINE> MILITARY ; PENTAGON ' S ' BOTTOM-UP REVIEW ' APPEARS TO BE DOWN AND OUT ; A YEAR AFTER DEFENSE CHIEF ASPIN PRAISED HIS POST-COLD WAR REDESIGN , IT HAS BECOME A LIABILITY . NOW SOME CRITICS ARE ASKING FOR A REVIEW OF THE REVIEW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Barely a year after it was unveiled , the Pentagon ' s highly touted &quot; bottom-up review &quot; of U.S. defense_policy -- intended to serve as the Clinton_Administration ' s blueprint for the post-Cold War military -- is largely in tatters . As envisioned by former Defense_Secretary Les Aspin , the review was supposed to clean_out old Cold_War thinking , forge a new role for the military and yield a smaller but tougher fighting force . Aspin claimed that it did exactly that . &quot; It has produced a lean , mobile , high-tech force , ready to protect Americans in this new time , &quot; he told reporters proudly last September , when the new study was completed . &quot; It . . . is based upon the real dangers that face America in the new era. &quot; But today , the bottom-up review has become a liability , derided by outside defense experts of all stripes and given only a lukewarm embrace by the Department_of_Defense ' s new management . Liberals complain that the review ' s central recommendation -- that the United States maintain a large enough force to fight two major regional wars &quot; nearly simultaneously &quot; -- is merely a holdover from Cold_War days and is out of sync with the relatively low-intensity conflicts that have broken_out in Rwanda , Haiti and elsewhere . Conservatives charge that the Administration ' s defense budget is nowhere near sufficient to finance the force that the review says would be needed . And to top it off , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , who moved_up from deputy secretary after Aspin resigned in December , conceded recently that the military would not be able to meet the goal of fighting two major regional wars at once for several more years . &quot; The bottom-up review stated fairly clearly . . . that the ability to meet the two-war contingency hinged_on some force enhancements being made , &quot; Perry told the Navy Times in an interview last month . But he warned that modernizing forces -- by outfitting warplanes with precision-guided bombs and missiles , for example -- is &quot; going_to take a_few years . To have those force enhancements then capable of fighting two full-scale major regional contingencies is a_couple_of years ahead of us. &quot; Dov Zakheim of Systems Planning Corp. , a defense-oriented technology and strategy company , said that the Administration is clearly &quot; torn &quot; over the bottom-up review . &quot; They recognize they don ' t have the resources to support it , but they have no alternative . They ' re caught between a strategic rock and a fiscal hard place. &quot; With budget pressures already intense , the Administration is finding itself in the ironic position of having to use the bottom-up review -- which initially was designed to help justify further cuts_in military spending -- to protect the current defense budget level instead . Defense_Department officials now cite the review to warn would-be budget-raiders in Congress that , if they cut the military budget any more_than Clinton already has proposed , the ability of the military to meet the new goals will be in jeopardy . As a result , such outside critics as Andrew F . Krepinevich , director of the Defense Budget Project , a nonpartisan defense-monitoring group , are calling_on Perry to review the review , with an eye toward scrapping it . Although defense officials insisted that Perry still fully supports the review ' s conclusions , insiders say John M . Deutch , the deputy secretary_of_defense , is quietly giving the document a second look and may end_up rewriting it entirely . Indeed , in a preliminary memo made public on Monday , officials warned that budget pressures could well force the Administration to cancel some of the military ' s most pressing big-ticket future weapon programs , including the F-22 jet fighter and the Army ' s Commanche helicopter . It is not certain yet how many of these programs ultimately will be cut , but the military already has begun to complain about the prospect of the reductions . Strategists say the services already are being stretched to carry_out their current missions . By far the most serious criticism of the bottom-up review is that it has not produced recommendations for the kinds of sweeping post-Cold War changes in U.S. military policy that Aspin appeared to have_in_mind when he proposed it two years ago . Despite the demise of the Soviet_Union , analysts said , the review would leave military policy essentially unchanged from the days of the George_Bush Administration . It calls_for only marginal reductions in troop strength and almost no major cuts_in weapon_systems . Analyst David Isenberg of the Cato Institute , a libertarian research organization , contended that the review ' s scenario of two major regional wars is a throwback to the Cold_War , when the Pentagon was concerned about fighting 2 1 / 2 full-scale wars in Europe and Asia . And many analysts , such_as Systems Planning Corp. ' s Zakheim , questioned Aspin ' s use of the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War as the standard for figuring future U.S. military requirements . The situation that U.S. troops faced there is likely to prove unique , Zakheim said . Instead , he warned , the United States is far more likely to encounter a series of simultaneous low-level conflicts such_as today ' s in Haiti and Rwanda . The force structure required for those is likely to be &quot; entirely different , &quot; he said . Conservatives warned that even if the two-war scenario is valid , Clinton ' s current defense budget falls far short of what is needed to finance the force structure demanded by the review and will stretch existing troops and equipment paper-thin . Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , a former fighter_pilot , predicted that the Aspin plan risks a return to the &quot; hollow forces &quot; of the 1970s , when the military was so depleted that it would have been unable to mount a serious offensive . The Army already is having to cut modernization and some maintenance and training activities . And the operating tempo of some units -- the amount_of_time that they actually spend on operations , as opposed to being down for maintenance or replenishment -- is down . On procedural grounds , the authors of the bottom-up review are criticized for crafting it to fit within the budget limits that Clinton already had set , rather than setting military policy first and then shaping the budget to reflect it . &quot; There ' s no question that the budget is what was driving this , &quot; said Don M . Snider , director of political-military affairs for the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a middle-of-the-road Washington think-tank . Despite Perry ' s continued support of the review in public , many senior military_officers are highly critical of the document . The Army , the service that was hardest-hit by the cuts , has launched a full-scale attack in Congress , quietly urging members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees to oppose the reductions in spending on force modernization . There is no real consensus on what ultimately will happen to the bottom-up review . Some insiders predict that it may be allowed to fade_away after Congress passes the fiscal 1996 budget about a year from now . But for now , Clinton appears to be stuck_with the bottom-up review , for appearances ' sake if nothing else . Analysts said that the Administration would look even more awkward if it abandons the document so soon after its unveiling . And Pentagon-watchers said that the White_House now needs the review to help defend its military programs from would-be budget-cutters in Congress . Clinton warned lawmakers in January that he planned to hold_the_line on the defense reductions that he had proposed . To do so , Administration lobbyists have been warning that any further cuts would jeopardize the goals set_in the bottom-up review . &quot; For the moment , &quot; Zakheim said , &quot; there ' s nothing to replace it. &quot;</TEXT>
