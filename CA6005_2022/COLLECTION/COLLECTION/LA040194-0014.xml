   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON HUMAN_RIGHTS ; WEARING THE VEIL , UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH ; IN THEIR QUEST TO ROOT_OUT ' WESTERN CORRUPTION , ' ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS DECLARE OPEN SEASON ON ALGERIAN WOMEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The most radical faction of the Islamic fundamentalist movement announced in February that any woman seen in public without the hijab ( veil ) prescribed by Muslim orthodoxy could and should be killed . This was no empty threat . It was carried_out Feb . 28 , when a 17-year-old girl was murdered on her way to high_school by a group of young_men . On Wednesday , two more young_women were killed at a bus_station . Since then , all_the young_women in the factory where I work as a junior manager are wearing the veil . I doubt three of them have the remotest interest in following the precepts of Islam in a strict sense , if at all . We respect the religion of our parents and of many of our contemporaries . But we were taught that religion is a private matter that cannot be imposed by decree . Now , practicing what we were taught can get us killed . None of us wants to wear the veil . But fear is stronger than our convictions or our will to be free . Fear is all around us . Our parents , our brothers , are unanimous : Wear the veil and stay alive . This will pass . I am no intellectual , but I believe other people were told , elsewhere in other times , that the evil and the fear around them would pass . As far as I know , it did not pass . It got_worse . I believe it will get_worse here unless someone hears us . Today the Islamists , as the Islamic fundamentalists are called , want to impose the veil on us . Tomorrow they will keep us from working or even going_to school . They say that we should not vote or take_part in public affairs . The veil between us and our country beyond the thick walls of our homes is to be total . And we all can guess that the slightest visit with a boyfriend can get us killed . The best of Islam is founded in human dignity and tolerance and respect for others . But it is not the best of Islam that is coming_to_the_fore now in Algeria . The war against women that is taking_place here is not founded in Islamic precepts , but in the terrorist mentality that took_over Iran years ago . Scarcely a day goes_by when a teacher , a journalist , a labor_leader , a lawyer is not murdered , not to mention ordinary working people who show signs of free thinking . They are considered Westernized , corrupt beyond salvation , good only for extermination . Algeria ' s greatest playwright and actor , Abdelkader Alloula , was gunned_down at_home . Because our country ' s medical facilities , under the strain of civil strife and economic disorder , are no longer equipped to treat severe head wounds , Alloula was flown to a hospital in France , where he died a_few days later . Most of the terrorists ' victims , of course , cannot even hope for a desperate attempt at rescue . Algerian women are alone . The secular , democratic_parties will not come_out to back us . Even the National Liberation Front -- the former ruling party which since the fiasco of the 1992 elections has taken a back seat to a series of military committees , and which the terrorists have sworn to eliminate and therefore has nothing to lose -- will not support us . Yet it was they who promised Algerian women they would be free after the war against the_French . France , the country closest to our country ' s destiny , has waited nervously , hesitating between a serious policy of helping Algeria repress the terrorists and one of seeking a deal with the eventual winner in what will soon be a full-scale Lebanese-style civil_war . Our neighbors , Morocco and Tunisia , have done nothing , terrified by the prospect of the most powerful country in the region turning_into another Iran and exporting its terrorist jihad -- and millions of refugees . And the United States has done nothing . Yet America is deeply implicated in our fate . And it is threatened , too . In the neighborhood where I live , they say that the United States armed and trained the most extreme Islamic fundamentalist factions in the Afghanistan war in the 1980s . If that is true , America provided a continuing training_program for the Algerian extremists . The military_leaders of the terrorist jihad in my country , young_men in their 20s and 30s who are as fearless as they are ruthless , are called Afghans . I have to believe that you Americans do not understand us or the full importance of our problem . Those whom you supported or still support in Afghanistan and Saudi_Arabia are_full of scorn for you . They believe that American women are filthy whores . I do not believe this and neither do my friends . We do not want to be like you , but we want to live_in a country where we can be like you if that is what we please , or be ourselves , or even wear a veil if we want to . But the Islamist terrorists , after they have turned Algeria into another Iran , will not give us any choices at all .</TEXT>
