   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK ; POWER WEB FRAYED ; SYSTEM IS SO INTERCONNECTED , QUAKE KNOCKED_OUT ELECTRICITY IN IDAHO AND CANADA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the earth shook Monday morning , massive damage to vital power facilities in the northwest San Fernando Valley cut electricity from one end of Los Angeles to the other , the first time in history the whole city was blacked_out . But that was not all . Customers in Alberta , Canada , lost their power too . In fact , as frantic Los Angeles Department of Water and Power officials were launching their battle with the city ' s worst power disaster , neighborhoods were flickering out from Nevada to Wyoming . Outside of Los Angeles , the most disruptive effects of the Northridge earthquake were in rural Idaho , where 150 # 000 customers lost power for three hours . Southern California ' s earthquake thus offered a dramatic illustration of how intimately the entire western states are interconnected in a gigantic and immensely complicated system that shuttles energy back and forth to protect the sockeye_salmon of the Columbia_River and help reduce smog in Los Angeles . Because of the region ' s key role in the interdependence of the power_system throughout the West , the quake could have triggered outages in much of western America . But despite the massive inconvenience experienced by Los Angeles residents as harried workers struggled through the day and night to reconnect the city , the big energy highways righted themselves almost without human intervention . &quot; We never want this kind of test , but we had an awesome test , &quot; said Dulcy Mahar , spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power Administration , the agency that wholesales federal hydroelectric power from the Columbia_River basin . &quot; The system worked. &quot; Of 1.3 million DWP customers blacked_out immediately after the quake , all but 60 # 000 in two pockets of the San Fernando Valley had service restored by Tuesday night , said Eldon Cotton , assistant general_manager for power . Although the system will soon be fully running , the repair and replacement of damaged equipment will go_on for more_than a year and cost $ 200 million , he added . In addition to the entire city of Los Angeles , 600 # 000 customers of Southern California Edison from Montebello to Santa Barbara lost power , said Steve Conroy , communications director for the power_systems division of SCE . Power had been restored to all but 150 # 000 by dusk and 1 # 500 by Tuesday morning , Conroy said . Emergency crews were hoping only to rig_up temporary connections to bypass a still-undetermined clutter of damaged equipment . &quot; We ' ve got_to tie things together that aren ' t normally tied together , &quot; said Charles P . Serazio , who worked to come_up with solutions . He is superintendent of the Rinaldi receiving station in Mission Hills , the largest of seven stations that distribute the city ' s power . &quot; It ' s a lot of creative problem solving. &quot; Monday morning , Serazio looked_up disconsolately at long aluminum bars called buses that resemble railroad_tracks suspended 40 feet in the air . They were twisted and bent toward the earth . He said the damage had punched a hole in an electrical beltway that circles Los Angeles , mixing power from dozens of sources and moving it in all directions . His immediate goal was limited : to energize a small part of the station to deliver power to the DWP ' s nearby water_pumping station to help restore potable water to the city . Only then could he begin to think_of getting power back to people ' s homes . By midafternoon , Serazio ' s workers had strung a thick red cable along the ground to bypass damaged equipment . Then he waited for a switch operator at another station to energize the line . By Tuesday morning , while large portions of the San Fernando Valley had yet to get electricity , a haggard-looking Serazio was still at it . He smiled wanly as a psssst sound rose from a bank of transformers where workers were busy connecting live_wires . &quot; that ' s a comforting sound , &quot; Serazio said . The most devastating blow to the system occurred only a_few miles to the north at a cinder-block building and caged yard of transformers called the Sylmar Converter , the southern terminus of an 846-mile , million-volt transmission_line between the Southland and Pacific Northwest . The control building of the Sylmar Converter , demolished in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and rebuilt to tougher seismic standards , was once again badly damaged . Floors tilted , file_cabinets tumbled across offices and complex electronic switching banks broke_open , disgorging their circuitry . By midday Monday , the building still did not have power , and work was going_on inside under the glare of a generator-fed floodlight . Supt . Brent Hollingworth said he thought it would be possible to get part of the plant running_by the end of the day by connecting it to the city ' s coal-burning power_plants in Utah , Nevada and Arizona . The first hurdle , though , would be to get power into the building to run the controls . That power had to come from the Rinaldi receiving station , which had no power for its own controls . Until Rinaldi got its first line connected at 2 p.m. there was nothing Hollingworth ' s crew could do . That was only a sample of the interrelatedness that spread the effects of the Los Angeles earthquake across the Pacific Northwest . Southern California was exporting power at the moment the lights went_out . Through the night , when demand is low in the south , power moves north along the direct-current highway and three smaller alternating-current lines , to the colder areas where demand peaks at night , Mahar said . A similar cycle occurs annually , as Southern California turns_off its air conditioners and northern residents turn_on electric_heaters . When the complex connections were severed in Los Angeles , the result was observed by sensors along the system as a loss of frequency . &quot; If your frequency doesn ' t match the equipment , you can blow_out transformers , &quot; Mahar said . &quot; We had 750 megawatts moving northward on the line , &quot; Mahar said . &quot; When the quake hit , it couldn ' t move . It tried to reroute itself through the east. &quot; That caused frequency changes in Arizona and Utah . &quot; A power island formed , &quot; Mahar said . &quot; This island took itself off the inter-tie as a protection . It was like tripping a giant circuit_breaker to protect our equipment. &quot; Almost immediately , as load was shed from the system , generation was increased by building the flow of water through hydroelectric plants in the Columbia basin , Comish said . In all , about 13 utility companies lost some service to hundreds of thousands of customers , said Bill Comish , director of dispatcher training for the Western Systems Coordinating Council , a Salt Lake City-based cooperative of 63 utilities that exchange power across the west . The blackouts , dispersed in pockets from Nevada through Alberta , Canada , ranged from 8 # 300 customers in Spokane blacked_out for 20 minutes to the 110 # 000 in Seattle for 30 minutes , Mahar said . The worst blackouts hit southeastern Idaho near Treasureton , Comish said , because that is the location of a sophisticated protective program installed to disconnect the system in just such an emergency . The interdependence of the western power_grid pays dividends to both north and south . &quot; The net benefit of all this interconnectedness is cheaper power , &quot; Mahar said . &quot; Because we can swap power during peak times , we don ' t have to build idle power plants. &quot; A protracted drought that has been depleted reservoirs since 1987 has aggravated the north ' s power needs . The subsidiary benefits can be subtle . &quot; It helps us with our fish problem , &quot; Mahar said . To protect the endangered sockeye_salmon , the Bonneville Power Administration is required to guarantee specific levels of water flow during the spring breeding season . Power from Southern California allows the agency to save water behind its dams for the spring . &quot; It ' s helped Southern California shut_down fossil_fuel generation , &quot; Mahar said . Once , Los Angeles generated 80 % of its own power at four natural_gas burning plants . As regional air_pollution standards have tightened , the DWP has replaced those generators with coal-burning plants in Arizona and Nevada . On Tuesday , one of those old plants , in Sunland , was running again . It had been fired_up to get the city through its crisis . Restoring Vital Elements Monday ' s quake left more_than 1.3 million power users in the Los Angeles region without service . The priorities followed by the Department of Water and Power when restoring major outages : 1 . Critical need : Service to customers serving a critical public need , such_as hospitals , police and fire_stations and airports . 2 . Number affected : Service is restored to the greatest number of people . For example , a damaged circuit serving 800 users is assigned a higher repair priority than one bringing power to 10 users . Areas with large businesses have higher priority than those that are primarily residential . 3 . Individual needs : Problems affecting individual homes and businesses . UTILITY PROBLEMS * Without power : 95 # 000 users were without power as of late Tuesday afternoon . Areas still affected included Northridge , Tarzana , Encino and Sylmar and the Palms , Fairfax and Koreatown sections of Los Angeles . * Preventing trouble : Those still without power are asked to switch_off all nonessential electrical appliances to ensure that when service is restored , the sudden power draw does not overload circuits . * Without water : 50 # 000 users remained without water as of late Tuesday afternoon , primarily near the Northridge epicenter . * Purifying tap_water : The earthquake knocked_out all DWP water purification systems and shook loose sediment from pipes . It is safe to bathe and wash clothes in tap_water , but do not drink it without boiling or treating it with chlorine bleach . The remaining sediment poses little harm , and can be strained out before drinking . Boil water vigorously for at least 10 minutes to kill biological contaminants . If you are without power and unable to boil water , add two to four drops of chlorine bleach per quart of tap_water . * Areas affected : Authorities broadened the areas in which residents should boil or bleach water before drinking it . The regions now include all_of the San Fernando Valley , all_of Los Angeles west of Fairfax Avenue , and neighborhoods north of Sunset Boulevard between Fairfax and Western avenues .
