   <TEXT> A 14-year-old girl who begged for her life was spared by assailants who shot three of her friends , killing two and critically wounding one in a sudden attack heard by residents of a quiet cul-de-sac , the youth and authorities said Saturday . The young_girl frequently broke_into tears as she recounted the brazen shooting of three men as they congregated around a car on North Highland Street Friday night . &quot; I thought they were going_to shoot me , &quot; the teen-ager said in Spanish . &quot; I said to them , ' You know me , I ' m your friend . I ' m a woman. ' I said , ' Please don ' t kill me. ' &quot; The girl ' s younger sister , who fled as the attack occurred , also escaped injury , the two youths said . Neighbors said they heard at least a dozen gunshots followed by the teen-ager pleading with the attackers . &quot; I heard a woman screaming , ' No ! No ! Not me ! ' &quot; said a man who asked not to be identified . Police confirmed that the 14-year-old was in the car in the 2000 block of North Highland when 19-year-old Julio Damian Cerroblanco and 21-year-old Jorge Orozco were shot and killed around 9:30 p.m. by gunmen with whom they had been arguing . A third victim , 19-year-old Jorge Avalos , was in critical condition at UCI Medical_Center in Orange Saturday . The victims , who suffered multiple gunshot wounds to their heads , were residents of Orange , police said . The girl was sitting inside the car at the end of the cul-de-sac with two of the victims , while her sister and another victim were outside the car at the time of the attack , police said . The victims had been arguing with the suspects via a third_party who was acting_as messenger , said Police Lt . Timm Browne . Police and witnesses said that after the final message was delivered , 22-year-old Maximino Garcia , his brother , 20-year-old Juan Jose Garcia , and a 17-year-old male charged out of an apartment . One of them repeatedly fired at the victims with a 9-millimeter handgun , according to authorities . &quot; I heard many , many shots . I don ' t know how many , &quot; the 14-year-old recalled Saturday . &quot; I said , ' Please don ' t hit my sister. ' &quot; I have a lot of fear ( today ) , &quot; she added . &quot; I ' m scared . My head and ears hurt . I can still hear the shots. &quot; &quot; The boys killed my friend , &quot; the younger sister said . &quot; Then I ran. &quot; Browne said the argument &quot; just kind of escalated rather quickly . The suspects were in the apartment , the victims were outside and the argument was being carried_on by a messenger. &quot; Police said the shooters and victims knew each other , but declined to discuss details of the argument . Neighbors said tensions between the two groups had been simmering for some time , and that threats had been made . The Garcia brothers had been living_in an apartment on the street for the last two months but had not been involved in any previous altercations , police and neighbors said Saturday . The victims ' blood was still on the grass Saturday , as friends set_up a small memorial of flowers and candles at the spot where they were shot . Neighbors were huddled_together in groups , still talking_about the shootings . &quot; Everybody ' s kind of surprised , &quot; said 60-year-old Robert Torres , who has lived_on the street for 15 years . &quot; This is a great neighborhood . Unfortunately , there were some people who came_in from the outside looking_for trouble. &quot; Browne said the neighborhood , located near the Costa Mesa Freeway , has not been particularly violent in the past . The shootings are the eighth and ninth homicides in Orange this year , police said . The suspects remained at_large Saturday and may be headed for Mexico , police said . According to investigators , they were last seen fleeing the area in a 1973 black or dark brown Mercury Cougar , with a California license_plate of : 2YVA800 . Anyone with information about the shooting or the suspects ' whereabouts is asked to call Orange Police Detective Cathie Ralph at ( 714 ) 744-7575 or 744-7494 .</TEXT>
