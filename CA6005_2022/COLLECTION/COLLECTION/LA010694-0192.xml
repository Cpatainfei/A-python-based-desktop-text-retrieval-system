   <HEADLINE> WILSON LACKS VISION , BROWN , GARAMENDI SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The two Democratic contenders for Gov . Pete Wilson ' s job in 1994 accused the Republican chief_executive Wednesday of failing to provide California with the vision , leadership and broad scope of solutions needed to make the state safe and prosperous . In delivering the official Democratic Party response to Wilson ' s State of the State address , State_Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi faulted Wilson more for what he failed to say than for the proposals he actually made . For example , Garamendi said California can use the talent and expertise of its declining defense industry to develop a new multibillion-dollar transportation manufacturing program in the state , making trolleys , subway cars and the_like . &quot; But it ' s going_to take a different kind of leader than we have today , &quot; Garamendi said during a side-by-side television appearance with Brown , whom he will face in the June primary for the Democratic nomination for governor . Brown faulted Wilson for neglecting to address education in his speech and urged Californians to make their own assessment of how the state is doing under Wilson , who is expected to have no major opposition in the GOP primary . She asked rhetorically : &quot; Do you feel safer than you did three years ago ? Are your children ' s schools better ? Do you feel more secure about your families ' economic futures and are you getting more from your hard-earned tax dollar ? &quot; Answering_for herself , Brown said , &quot; I think these last three years left too many people out_of_work , too many criminals out of jail and too many Californians out of hope. &quot; The real political battle of the next five months will be between Brown and Garamendi as they fight for the party ' s selection as the candidate to challenge Wilson ' s reelection to a second term . Brown and Garamendi already have sparred sharply over which one has_the_best ideas , the most experience and leadership qualities . On Wednesday , however , they treated each other as friends and allies in the greater political fight facing Democrats in the summer and fall -- unseating a governor whose popularity has plummeted as California ' s problems mounted , yet is recognized as a veteran , tough political campaigner . By packaging Brown and Garamendi for the response , the Democratic Party sought to frame the State of the State as a campaign event . Wilson , in contrast , presented the speech as about the chores of government rather than the hostilities of electoral politics . He struck a tone of conciliation , reaching_out to Democrats to work with him during the coming session . At the same time , Wilson projected a political message to viewers around the state : That he ' s been toiling hard on their behalf and should be entrusted with another four years in office . A Wilson spokesman , Dan Schnur , said the State of the State address was not meant as a vehicle for laying_out Wilson ' s entire campaign more_than a month before his official announcement , but that the twin themes of economy and crime will be heard frequently in the months ahead . &quot; The two issues that he talked_about tonight , jobs and crime , are issues that are foremost in the minds of the voters and in all likelihood will be foremost in the campaign. &quot; Beyond that , however , the governor was attempting to persuade voters that California is_on the way back from the depths of the recession that helped make Wilson the most unpopular governor in recent California history midway through his first term . &quot; The message is that we are making_it through , &quot; Schnur said . &quot; We are headed in the right direction . There is a difficult road ahead , but we will make_it through. &quot; Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( D-San Francisco ) said Democrats are in a strong position for an assault on Wilson ' s governorship . He said Kathleen Brown sounds tougher than Wilson on the crime issue and that Garamendi has projected a more comprehensive , coherent view than Wilson of what California needs to build for the future . For the statewide television audience , both Brown and Garamendi sought to project sober reflection to appear gubernatorial . But in interviews with reporters , both were more sharply critical of the governor . &quot; There were a lot of very old , tired cliches &quot; in Wilson ' s speech , Garamendi said . &quot; One of the two of us is going_to be the Democratic candidate and I think , in all honesty , one of us is going_to be the next governor . We ' re going to challenge Pete Wilson. &quot; Brown said it was a major omission for the governor not to address the problems facing public education in California . &quot; The issues of crime and the economy are paramount . . . . But we will never deal with the crime situation and the economy unless we deal with education and how we will have the high-skilled jobs and how we will have the high-wage jobs to truly move us forward into the 21st Century. &quot; In speeches throughout Northern California this week , Garamendi also talked_about how the issues of crime and the economy are interconnected with improving the education system , job training , restoring the state ' s manufacturing base , and putting new emphasis on research and development . Garamendi also said far more must be done to solve crime than just locking criminals away for longer periods_of_time in more new prisons . Both he and Brown called_for creation of &quot; boot camps &quot; to house first_offenders , drug prevention and drug rehabilitation_programs in an effort to break the cycle of crime . Job opportunities are critical to the process , they say . Brown took a shot at Wilson ' s proposed tax cut by saying that his speech consisted_of &quot; election year rhetoric from an election year governor who raised taxes more_than any governor in the history of California. &quot;</TEXT>
