   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; CHEERLEADERS STAR IN THIS BIG GAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s not just shaking pompons and yelling &quot; Go , team ! &quot; anymore . With national competitions and magazines devoted to cheerleading , it ' s considered a sport by the 4 # 000 cheerleaders from more_than 300 schools across the United States and Canada who descended Friday on the Anaheim Convention Center . They ' re here for the two-day , ninth annual USA Nationals Competition . As in team sports , cheerleading has junior varsity and varsity levels . And there are the injured bench-warmers and teary-eyed teammates frustrated with their performances . &quot; These girls take it very seriously , &quot; said Kenny Wardell , a spokesman for the United Spirit Assn. , which sponsors the competition . &quot; To them it ' s a sport. &quot; The evidence is in the participants ' training , performance and attitude , Wardell said . But compared to other sports , cheerleading involves a lot of glamorizing and accessorizing . Friday , for example , many of the teen-agers ' heads were smothered in big pink foam curlers . They had been wearing them all day so their ponytails would sport springy curls . They came_with their best faces on -- their smiles and make-up glowed for yards as they performed their high-spirited , brief routines . Gestures have evolved from simple arm movements , tumbling and tossing , and standing on teammates ' shoulders_in arabesques . Now there are soloists and props , including tennis_racquets and stuffed animals . The complexity of the shows requires work and patience -- cheerleaders from Trabuco Hills High_School in Mission Viejo said their coach trains them for 25 hours each week . To compete in this weekend ' s event , the Trabuco Hills squad first had to qualify in a regional competition . This is the squad ' s first trip to the national competition . For 16-year-old squad member Shanna Alexander , dancing is the best part of being a cheerleader . Like many competitive athletes , she said that while waiting to perform she would &quot; worry &quot; and &quot; see what the competition is doing. &quot; Becky Harkins , one of Alexander ' s teammates , could not compete Friday . She hurt her knee skiing a month ago and the squad has had to re-choreograph some of its routines . But Harkins -- with a big brace on her leg -- suited up in her blue and white sweater and short skirt anyway , to support her teammates . Their slogan : &quot; Blue , gray and white , let ' s fight , all_right ! &quot; According to former cheerleading judge Paul Marks , athletics are important in deciding who wins . Uniformity and strength of the movements , choreography , and recovery from any mistakes also count , he said . Tonight , the winning junior varsity team from Friday ' s competition will give an exhibition , and the top varsity finalists will compete . Winners will take_home trophies and prizes from sponsors.ELAINE TASSY</TEXT>
