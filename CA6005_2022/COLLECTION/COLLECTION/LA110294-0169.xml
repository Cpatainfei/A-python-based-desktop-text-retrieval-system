   <HEADLINE> CONTINENTAL MAY MOVE 1 # 400 JOBS FROM LAX ; AIRLINES : THE SHIFT OF JET MAINTENANCE WORK WOULD INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND TRIM COSTS , A SPOKESMAN SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Continental Airlines is mulling whether to move most of its jet maintenance now done_by 1 # 400 workers at Los Angeles International Airport to the carrier ' s facilities in Florida or other states , a Continental spokesman said Tuesday . Nothing final has been decided , but Continental ' s recent opening of a new maintenance base in Orlando , Fla. , &quot; will have consequences for LAX &quot; operations , said spokesman David Messing at the airline ' s Houston headquarters . The transfer of the LAX work is being considered as a way for Continental -- which emerged from its second reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in April , 1993 -- to increase its efficiency and reduce costs , Messing said . If the work is shifted , it would further reduce what once was Continental ' s significant presence in Los Angeles . The city formerly was Continental ' s home before the carrier moved to Texas in 1982 . Continental , the nation ' s fifth-largest airline by passengers flown , employs 3 # 300 at LAX , including terminal agents and pilots and flight_attendants that are based at the airport . The aircraft-maintenance work is performed at a 60-acre hangar facility at the west_end of LAX behind the international terminal , on property leased from the city ' s Department of Airports . But Messing said the &quot; higher costs of doing business &quot; in California relative to many other states &quot; are not the driving force &quot; behind the possible move . Rather , Continental during the past year has substantially increased its presence in the eastern United States with its fledgling low-fare service_called Continental Lite , or CALite . The airline thus is looking_to shift its maintenance work closer to the majority of routes it serves , he said . Continental wants &quot; to have our maintenance support conveniently located to where our airplanes are flying , &quot; Messing said . Regardless , the threat of Continental ' s departure comes only three weeks after airport officials and Delta Air Lines worked_out a plan to keep Delta from closing its LAX operations , where about 900 employees are involved in reservations and other customer service . A key issue in Delta ' s case was that Delta , which is undergoing a massive cost-cutting effort , faced the prospect of a rent increase at LAX . Delta decided to stay after the parties agreed to try to sublease some of Delta ' s space and effectively cut Delta ' s rent . But the Department of Airports vehemently denied that rent is a factor_in Continental ' s possible cutbacks at LAX , even though Continental currently is in negotiations with the city on how much , if any , its rent would increase . &quot; It ' s got nothing to do with our rates and charges , &quot; said Philip Depoian , deputy executive_director of the Department of Airports . &quot; We ' ve been told . . . this is a strategic corporate decision. &quot; Although Continental serves LAX , Orange County and San Diego , much of the carrier ' s recent emphasis has been_on CALite , which is trying to garner market share_in short-haul Eastern markets from rivals USAir and Southwest Airlines . But in announcing only a modest third-quarter profit last week , Continental conceded that CALite has yet to break_even . And on the same day , CALite ' s main backer , Robert R . Ferguson III , resigned as Continental ' s chief_executive amid reports he was forced to leave because of the airline ' s displeasure with its results . * GLOBAL COMPETITION : The Clinton_Administration wants international airline regulations eased .
