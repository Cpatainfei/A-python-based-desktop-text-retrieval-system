   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : BOYS ' NIGHT OUT BECAME A NIGHTMARE ; THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS ABOUT CRASH THAT LEFT SEAHAWKS ' FRIER PARALYZED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the first night of December , around 7:30 , Kelly Butler drove through a corridor of twinkling Christmas lights in this lakeside village to a combination billiards parlor and pub called The Shark to pick_up her boyfriend , Mike Frier , 25 , a 6-foot-5 , 299-pound defensive tackle for the Seattle Seahawks with whom she has a baby daughter . He wasn ' t there . Five of the football_team ' s players had been inside The Shark , playing pool on what Butler called &quot; a boys ' night out. &quot; She had dropped_off Frier at 4:30 and promised to pick him up . A bartender told police that the five men had consumed approximately 10 beers and did not seem to be , in his professional opinion , drunk . From a pay phone inside the pool hall , Butler had her boyfriend paged . Frier ' s beeper went_off in the back seat of a 1992 Oldsmobile Bravada with Indiana license_plates belonging_to teammate Wilbur Lamar Smith , 24 , a Seahawk running back . Up front with Smith sat the team ' s superstar , Chris Warren , also a running back , in fact the American_Football Conference ' s leading rusher . Question is , which man sat behind the wheel ? Police presumed it was Warren . They slapped handcuffs on him and charged him with vehicular assault . Warren ' s attorney , however , says Smith was the driver . So does Smith ' s attorney . And so does Butler , who heard this directly from her boyfriend , just after doctors fused the broken vertebrae in his neck , placed him in cervical traction and prepared him for a lifetime of paralysis from the neck down . The music inside the Olds was evidently quite loud . Frier had neglected to tell his girlfriend that he had a ride . Upon receiving her page , he leaned forward to let Warren and Smith know that he needed to find a phone . Warren suggested that they drive to his place in Redmond , no more_than six miles away . But then , patting his pockets , Warren suddenly realized that he had forgotten his house keys in Kirkland , at the football_team ' s training camp . At a reported 8:40 p.m. on the rainy night in_question , the utility vehicle registered to Smith traveled northbound down 108th Avenue Northeast , running parallel to the banks of Lake Washington off to the passengers ' side . They passed an espresso and pastry shop called the Muffin Break and then a Kirkland fire_station , approaching the little gray schoolhouse , gaily decorated for the holidays , that marks the turnoff to the Seahawks ' camp . A police_sergeant said the initial indication was that the vehicle carrying the players pulled into a left-turn lane to pass another car . An eyewitness , Dave Needham , 19 , of Kirkland , reported that he and his friends heard the very loud music , &quot; a big , booming bass , &quot; turned_to look and to their amazement saw the Olds swerve off the road and into a roadside electrical-power pole with a noisy crash . The teen-agers ran to a nearby house , one of them screaming , &quot; Call 911 ! &quot; All electricity went_out in about 4 # 500 homes_in Kirkland and nearby Bellevue , including the residence of Tom Flores , the Seahawks ' general_manager and coach . He had just gotten home from practice and had no idea that three of his players were responsible_for the blackout , that they were , at that moment , pinned inside the wreckage of a small truck , its front_end so smashed that the steering_wheel was practically pressed against the utility pole . The wait was terrible . Most of the windows were broken . Needham stood nearby , virtually helpless until authorities came . He said , &quot; The guy in back ( Frier ) was doubled_over , yelling . The man was in incredible pain. &quot; When fire_fighters finally began working to free the men from the debris , crackling showers of electrical sparks descended on them from atop the power_line . A second witness said he looked_into the truck and saw a case of beer , Bud Ice , partly crumpled . A detective from the Kirkland police , Jim O ' Toole , confirmed that empty beer_cans had been found . No skid marks were visible on the damp pavement . &quot; We ' re not talking drag racing , &quot; Kirkland Police Sgt . Mark Smith said . &quot; We ' re talking people driving too fast for conditions. &quot; The next morning , the news of the accident hit the people of Seattle with considerable impact . Details were sketchy , some incorrect . &quot; Chris Warren Arrested , &quot; a headline read , and this much was true . The identity of his paralyzed teammate was withheld in many accounts , pending notification of the family . At least two newspapers misidentified the make of the vehicle and one of them , the Journal-American of Bellevue , described it as a &quot; Chevy Blazer driven by Warren , &quot; possibly erring twice in five words . What followed in days to come was a veritable Warren Report of fact-finding investigation . To this day , police have yet to formally exclude Warren as the driver of the vehicle , despite denials all around . They have dusted the steering_wheel for fingerprints but not yet revealed their findings . Warren also agreed to a lie-detector test , administered by a University of Utah professor who also tested serial_killer Ted Bundy and kidnap victim Patty Hearst . The professor , David Raskin , announced that Warren had passed . &quot; What this does , it lends substantial credence to Lamar Smith ' s admission that he was the driver and Warren ' s denial , &quot; said Warren ' s attorney , John Wolfe . Warren ' s agent , Richard Schaeffer of Baltimore , issued a statement that he was confident that Warren was not the driver and that &quot; there was a misunderstanding at the accident scene. &quot; Witnesses told police that Warren was the driver . Police obtained a warrant to search the vehicle and dusted the steering_wheel for prints . King County Prosecutor spokesman Dan Donohue said , &quot; We are moving very slowly , very deliberately . We are not going_to jump into this thing. &quot; Police reportedly are re-contacting witnesses . Warren has clammed_up , at his attorney ' s behest . He has two cracked ribs . Smith has foot and neck injuries and cannot play football . Frier remains in intensive care , where teammates have not been permitted to visit . He recently developed post-operative pneumonia , a common complication of quadriplegia , and fluid is being sucked from his lungs . Frier is now breathing with the aid of a tube . &quot; The likelihood of his walking again is very poor , &quot; said the neurological surgeon , Michael Schlitt , who performed the spinal_fusion on Frier . &quot; He will almost certainly be wheelchair-dependent. &quot; Warren , meantime , has not missed a minute of football . He has rarely played better . He rushed last week at Houston for a career-high 185 yards . Beforehand , he kiddingly kicked at a ground-level TV camera as the Seahawks ran onto the field -- not menacingly , but playfully . Maybe he is making an effort to lighten the mood . After his first game after the accident , Warren said , &quot; I am not answering those questions about Mike. &quot; In the opinion of columnist Steve Kelley of the Seattle Times , he was &quot; as matter-of-fact as a ticket-taker , as cold as an Arctic wind. &quot; This has been said of him before . * Every so often , Warren wonders why he is not a brighter star , why he is not a more popular player among fans . People tell him it ' s Seattle . That the team is weak and the exposure is poor . Somewhere else , had someone rushed for 1 # 000 yards three consecutive seasons the way Warren has , that player might be as marketable as Emmitt Smith . Then again , Thurman Thomas played in several Super Bowls , and how popular is he ? It is a favorite story of linebacker Rod Stephens that in public places in Seattle , their bodies being large and their faces looking vaguely familiar , athletes are approached by people who ask , &quot; ' Y ' all play for the Seahawks ? ' So we say yes . So they ask_for an autograph and Warren signs and they say , ' Oh , yeah ! Now we know who you are ! ' &quot; Even when he was finally invited to join other NFL notables for something called &quot; NFL Kickoff ' 94 : Run to Daylight &quot; before this season , Warren was reminded of his lack of stature . A box of custom-made jerseys for Jerome Bettis , Ricky Watters , Eric Metcalf and other top running_backs was opened and the shirts were dispersed . Warren ' s had the wrong number , 32 instead of 42 . &quot; They gave me ( former Seahawk ) John L . Williams ' number , &quot; he said . Another time , Warren insists , Howie Long of the Raiders was speaking_to him about being a running back for Seattle and how it must be difficult to get playing time because of this guy Chris Warren who plays_up there . Warren said , &quot; He was talking to me the whole time about me and he didn ' t know it was me. &quot; Perhaps were Warren to show the warmth to outsiders that he does to teammates , he might be suitably famous . He has been known to treat blockers to $ 1 # 000 dinners . He bought each of them Rolex wristwatches as gifts last Christmas . After Warren was named to the Pro Bowl last week , he announced that he was buying first-class airplane_tickets to Hawaii for the offensive linemen for the Feb . 5 game . &quot; I owe them at least that much , &quot; Warren said . It also was Warren , with no small measure of irony , who one month ago , as he again neared the 1 # 000-yard mark , tried but failed to take teammates on the town after practice . At the time he said , &quot; Almost all_of them had other commitments . I can never get all_the guys together . Everyone has their own lives . They have girlfriends or wives wanting them to do things in their off-time . I understand that . It ' s no big deal . I don ' t want them to get_in trouble , saying that they had to do something with me. &quot; Funny thing about that . Ever since childhood , Warren has been seen , more or less , as standoffish . His mother said that in Little_League baseball , Chris would hit a home_run , round the bases , return to the dugout and sit without a word or a smile . Regina Eagle said of her son , &quot; He ' d just be sitting there like , ' Go away. ' &quot; Similar sentiments came from his high_school football_coach in Fairfax , Va. , where ability was more Warren ' s thing than sociability . Nick Hilgert said he would need Warren for only three quarters because by then the team would be leading by several touchdowns . &quot; He wasn ' t someone who jumped up and down and put his hands on his hips and said , ' Well , look_at me ! ' &quot; Hilgert recalled . But oh , could he look good . Warren ' s mother said Chris was so conscious of his appearance , she had to buy a washboard and special soap to scrub the grass stains from his uniform , because mere laundering wasn ' t enough . Chris even cleaned his shoes in the sink with a toothbrush . &quot; He wanted to be immaculate , &quot; she said . What he forgot to be was academic . All the major colleges came calling and Warren picked nearby Virginia . Offensive tackle Ray Roberts of the Seahawks was there at the time and couldn ' t wait to see this kid who people said could catch punts behind his back . Seahawk linebacker Andy Heck played in high_school against Warren and remembered being dragged for 15 yards into the end zone , trying to tackle him . Heck said , &quot; He even beat us at the buzzer in the basketball playoffs. &quot; But the D he got_in Greek_mythology and the same grade he got_in biology cost Warren his eligibility , not with the NCAA but with the more demanding university . Warren enrolled at an academy called Ferrum , so intimate that teachers dined with students . It was so anonymous to people from the sports world , though , Warren later joked , &quot; They must wonder if it ' s a black college. &quot; Scouts from the Seahawks made an appointment to see Warren . Where they ended_up seeing him was at a rest stop along Interstate 81 , somewhere between Roanoke , Va. , and the North Carolina border . Warren ' s car had broken_down on his way to see the Seahawks . Player personnel director Mike Allman told him to stay_put . He and his associates cleared_out parking_spaces at the rest area , threw Warren a_few passes and picked him in the fourth round on draft day . He waited two years for someone to hand him the football or for Coach Chuck Knox to leave . After carrying 17 times from scrimmage over two seasons , Warren was given his chance by Flores . Only five NFL backs topped 1 # 000 yards in both 1992 and 1993 , among them Warren . This season he leads the AFC in rushing and total yards . With 120 yards rushing today against the Raiders , he will break Curt Warner ' s single-season club record . And no busted ribs can stop him . On the Saturday night after the accident , Warren slept_in his own bed , rather than at the team ' s hotel . &quot; I had to think_about it before I made a decision , &quot; he told John Clayton of the Tacoma News-Tribune . &quot; It ' s not like I made the decision ( to play ) right away when I woke_up . I had a_few days to make it. &quot; Warren showered , shaved , then phoned Clarence Shelmon , who coaches the running backs , to say he would play against Indianapolis . Entering the locker_room , Warren encountered his teammates for the first time . He couldn ' t slip_in unnoticed . &quot; It ' s hard to go_into a locker_room and not be noticed , &quot; Warren said . &quot; There were a number of players who greeted me and just said they were praying for me . It was like a comfort zone for me. &quot; Some of this comfort came from teammate Eugene Robinson , who said , &quot; I gave the brother a hug just to let him know that he ' s not out there by himself , and said , ' I ' m praying for you and will continue to pray for you. ' &quot; Praying for Warren to do what , he didn ' t say . Mack Strong began the game in his place , but fumbled a screen_pass on Seattle ' s first possession . In came Warren , wearing a flak jacket over ribs too tender to bandage . Seahawk tackle Roberts said , &quot; Even if he had just dressed and come_out , I think it would have helped him . For Chris , I think this was his way of being at_peace with himself . The more he sits around and thinks , the worse it becomes. &quot; What else he was thinking , Warren pretty much kept to himself . &quot; Any soreness ? &quot; someone asked . &quot; Of course there was soreness , &quot; Warren snapped . &quot; I ' ve been in a car wreck. &quot; * So had Mike Frier . In the intensive-care ward of Overlake Hospital medical_center in Bellevue , the big tackle was having his feet massaged by his girlfriend . He whispered to her that he could feel it . He was even moving both arms , although he could move nothing else . &quot; He ' s unbelievable , though , &quot; Butler said . &quot; Before the surgery , he was joking with the nurses , joking with me . They wheeled him into the operating_room and he was still joking . He knows the situation himself , but you would n ' t have known something was wrong with him. &quot; Frier appeared in 34 NFL games and will appear in no more . Like Warren , he came from a small-college background , at Appalachian State , and beat the odds . In 1992 , the Seahawks tried to hide him on the practice squad in a roster move , but the Cincinnati Bengals got wise and claimed him on waivers . He didn ' t like it there and complained about his lack of playing time . The instant Cincinnati set him free , Seattle snapped him back_up . At the woodland training camp nestled amid the tall green firs , Seahawk defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy sits and does what Warren has been told not to do -- talk_about Frier . &quot; I was going_to take him under my wing , &quot; Kennedy said . &quot; I helped him rent a car when he got here . This isn ' t a new experience for me . I lost my friend Jerome Brown in a car crash like this . I just wish I ' d gotten_to know Mike better . About all I do know is how much he loved that baby girl of his. &quot; Flores said he had begun to use Frier more and that he had played particularly well against Kansas City . The accident saddened the coach , but he decided against lecturing the team about being careful because &quot; emotions were pretty sensitive at that point &quot; and because he thought the danger was self-evident . Twelve days later , cornerback Orlando Watters was arrested for drunken driving and five other violations . Flores this time told all_the players directly through Watters , &quot; You screwed_up . Every player is an adult and has to be held accountable for what he does_in his personal life. &quot; As for himself , Flores said , &quot; I can ' t go_home with each one of them . I can ' t lock them in a dorm. &quot; The coach wasn ' t sure how to handle the first incident . He instructed Warren to go_home and think for himself . &quot; All the confusion of who was driving , all_the stories coming_out , it became bigger than life , &quot; Flores said . &quot; People kept reminding everybody , ' Wait a minute . We ' ve got a man in the hospital who ' s paralyzed . Let ' s think_about him. ' Yet the games go_on . I told Chris to make the decision and we ' ll go_with it . He ' s still sore , but he had a career day . &quot; Chris is not a talkative guy , but you could see it in his eyes . He was feeling a lot of emotion . Perhaps this was good therapy for him. &quot; Mike Frier ' s therapy will continue for months . He has no feeling in his hands or legs . There is slight movement in his biceps . His temperature has returned to normal , now that he is breathing with the aid of a ventilator . Lamar Smith has a chip fracture in his neck and a foot injury worse than first believed . He is sidelined for the rest of the season and awaiting results of the police ' s continuing investigation into whether he was driving the car . Chris Warren was to be honored Saturday by the Rainier District Youth Athletic Assn . as its role_model of the year . He did say of Mike Frier , &quot; I wish I could say ' Hi ' to him right now with a capital H. &quot; It is unknown whether he will again ask his teammates out after practice , or whether they will have previous commitments .</TEXT>
