   <HEADLINE> BREYER ' S PUBLIC LIFE OFFERS FEW CLUES TO PRIVATE BELIEFS ; SUPREME COURT : THOUGH AMBITIOUS , NOMINEE HAS TRIED TO HAVE PRACTICAL IMPACT . BUT LEANINGS ARE UNCLEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When friends and colleagues of Judge Stephen G . Breyer search for anecdotes about him , what they recall is his career advice . Kathleen Sullivan , now a law professor at Stanford_University , was starting as a member of the Harvard Law_School faculty when she met Breyer . At a faculty reception , Breyer urged her to get involved in &quot; something like the federal sentencing commission -- something practical. &quot; &quot; We need intellectuals to get involved in projects that have an impact on people ' s lives , &quot; Sullivan recalls Breyer telling her . To Akhil Amar , who worked as a law clerk in Breyer ' s judicial chambers and now teaches at Yale Law_School , the judge offered a more direct suggestion : After listening to his young clerk ' s plans for a series of law review_articles , Breyer counseled him that to really have an impact , he should write a book . And he should not wait too long , Breyer added . &quot; I really wanted to have a book before I was 40 , &quot; Amar recalls him saying . The advice , as Breyer told those he counseled , was autobiographical -- reflecting twin elements of his life that explain why Breyer now stands on the edge of an all-but-certain confirmation to the nation ' s highest_court : a strong desire to use his formidable legal talents to make a practical impact beyond Ivory_Tower theorizing , coupled with a keen appreciation of the quickest , surest routes toward his own advancement . &quot; Every move he has made has paid_off , &quot; said his friend Alan M . Dershowitz , a Harvard Law_School professor and noted criminal defense_lawyer . &quot; Steve just never makes a mistake. &quot; But while Breyer ' s path has been so smooth and steady as_to appear almost effortless , it has provided few clues to answer the ultimate question : If he is to become a leader of the Supreme Court , as President Clinton hopes , where would Breyer take it ? Breyer has become well-regarded as an expert on federal regulatory law , about which he has written influential articles and books . But by contrast with several past Republican nominees , who had staked out clear ideological positions before being chosen , Breyer has made almost no public comment on constitutional law or on such controversial topics as abortion or privacy rights or affirmative_action . &quot; Steve is a lot like President Clinton in many ways . He ' s a pragmatist , a centrist with an enormous array of friends , &quot; said Dershowitz . In pursuit of his goals , Breyer has traveled a route from Stanford to Oxford to Harvard to a Supreme Court clerkship , back to Harvard , to the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee and then to the federal appeals court bench -- mixing academic work with immersion in practical politics . &quot; Steve has the same philosophy his father had , &quot; said his aunt , Shirley Black , whose brother , Irving Breyer , was a prominent attorney and public_servant in San Francisco , counsel for nearly 40 years to the city school_board . &quot; It ' s doing the most good for people . If you want to help people , you should try to gain power. &quot; Along the way , he has impressed and charmed scores of people scattered through the upper reaches of American law and politics , from the late Justice Arthur M . Goldberg , who used to tell friends he hoped to see his former clerk one day don a justice ' s robes ; to Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) , for whom he worked in 1974- ' 75 and again in 1979- ' 80 as a top Judiciary Committee aide and who then secured an appeals court judgeship for him in the Jimmy_Carter Administration ' s closing days ; to such conservatives as Sens . Orrin G . Hatch ( R-Utah ) and Strom Thurmond ( R-S.C. ) , whose support for him has virtually guaranteed a smooth confirmation . What he has not done , conceded another longtime friend , Peter Edelman , is live a life that makes &quot; good copy. &quot; Breyer ' s biography includes no epic struggle , none of the up-from-obscurity morality tale that so delights ( and sometimes deludes ) American audiences . At home_in Cambridge , Mass. , in a comfortable house not far from the Harvard campus , Breyer lives the life of a conventional and successful member of the American intellectual and policy elite -- enjoying fine food , wine and conversation , rooting for his hometown baseball and basketball_teams , running and riding a beat_up , one-speed bicycle to stay fit , driving a dark_blue Volvo station_wagon , sending his three children to Harvard , Stanford and Yale . In his 55 years of life and 30 years as a lawyer , a law professor and a judge , Breyer &quot; has never represented the underdog and never been an underdog , &quot; said a prominent Washington attorney and friend who is otherwise highly complimentary of the nominee . Despite the lack of drama in his life , Breyer could become one of the most influential public figures of his generation . Many lawyers who study the court believe Breyer has a strong chance of being far more_than merely one vote among nine . The current court , in the opinion of most lawyers and academics who study it , notably lacks a leader . Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia , who could exercise leadership by virtue , respectively , of position and intellectual prowess , stand too far toward the judicial right to do so effectively . The justices in the court ' s conservative center -- David H . Souter , Sandra Day O ' Connor , Anthony M . Kennedy -- have shown little ability to lead . By contrast , of the nine men and two women placed on the court in the last generation , only Scalia and , perhaps , Clinton ' s other nominee , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , come_close to matching Breyer ' s record of legal scholarship , intelligence and achievement . At a time when many federal judges complain frequently about the crushing burden of their workloads , Breyer was able to handle the work of an appeals court judge while still teaching at Harvard , playing a central role on the U.S. Sentencing Commission and educating himself about architecture to guide the construction of a new federal courthouse in Boston . Moreover , unlike Ginsburg , who often has appeared to associates as distant , shy or aloof , Breyer is gregarious and charming . His experiences heading a Senate staff , on the court of appeals and on the sentencing commission demonstrate that he is a highly effective small-group politician who inspires genuine affection on the part of those who have worked under him and loyal friendship from those he has served . About the only open opponent to his nomination so far has been consumer advocate Ralph Nader , who objected that Breyer has sided with big business too often in antitrust_cases and has been too skeptical of federal regulatory efforts . But in a telling example of the network of Breyer ' s friendships , Nader ' s top lawyer , Alan Morrison , is a close friend of the nominee ' s who has defended Breyer ' s views . Breyer ' s judicial opinions on antitrust prove little . He is clearly no economic populist , but the Supreme Court ' s conservative rulings on antitrust_cases over the last two decades give lower court judges relatively little leeway . But his views on regulation reveal more about him . Breyer ' s writings show a desire to bring order to messy legal problems and an underlying belief , reflective of the California progressive tradition in which he grew_up , that government programs are subject_to improvement by careful , expert thought . Breyer ' s work_on regulation also reveals his skill at practical politics . As an aide to Kennedy , he played a key role in winning approval of federal airline deregulation , though he and Nader , who was an ally in the effort , later criticized the Ronald Reagan_Administration ' s unwillingness to use antitrust_laws to police the deregulated airlines . In his writings , Breyer has objected to the wholesale efforts at deregulation pushed during the Reagan_Administration but also criticized the weaknesses of many current regulatory programs . Last year , delivering Harvard ' s prestigious Oliver Wendell Holmes lectures , he described system-wide problems of regulation . In particular , he objected to the tendency of regulators to spend 90 % of their energy cleaning_up the &quot; last 10 % &quot; of a problem . He also described the difficulty of allocating scarce regulatory resources rationally given the way the public and Congress overreact to some minor risks -- he cited intact asbestos in existing buildings as a prime example -- while underemphasizing more serious ones . Breyer ' s desire to bring order to complex subjects , as well as his ability to bridge ideological gaps , also can be seen in his work_on the federal sentencing commission , a body set_up in the early 1980s to end disparities in sentences imposed by different federal judges for similar crimes . Originally , many members of the commission believed they could devise formulas to cover every possible circumstance that might influence a sentence . In practice , however , the effort quickly bogged down amid disagreements over attempts to weigh various types of heinous acts , as well as ideological differences . Breyer convinced both sides to drop their more ambitious goals . Instead , relying_on a statistical study of some 10 # 000 sentences handed_down by federal judges , he constructed a formula that eliminated wide disparities by largely ratifying existing average practices . While that experience provides a clear picture of his leadership abilities , neither his appeals court opinions nor his scholarly writings indicates much about Breyer ' s views on the great constitutional issues that attract attention to the high_court . That absence of comment has made some liberals uneasy about Breyer ' s imminent ascension to the high_court , particularly given his endorsements from such prominent conservative voices as Hatch and the Wall_Street Journal editorial page . Clinton ' s choice has caused more_than a little behind-the-scenes grumbling from Democratic liberals who have complained that , after years in which Republican presidents carefully sought_out strict conservatives for the court , President Clinton has now chosen two justices , Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who joined the court last year , who are known for moderation . Breyer ' s friends have responded in recent days , arguing that as a justice he will emerge as a newly liberated champion of an updated form of judicial liberalism -- one who will uphold strong protections of civil_rights and civil_liberties but be more skeptical about the ability of federal judges to improve society than was the case during the court ' s liberal era under former Chief_Justice Earl Warren . Now that Breyer has achieved his ultimate goal , argued Dershowitz , &quot; all_the constraints are off . There ' s nothing else he wants in life. &quot; A similar prediction is made by Edelman , who serves as counselor in the Department of Health and Human Services and who , along with his wife , Marian Wright Edelman , who heads the Children ' s Defense Fund , is also a longtime friend of President Clinton and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . &quot; He ' s very deeply committed to civil_rights issues , &quot; Edelman said , citing Breyer ' s work handling civil_rights measures as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee in the late 1970s . Others , however , make more tentative judgments . John Hart Ely , former dean of Stanford Law_School who now teaches at Yale , clerked for Earl Warren the year Breyer clerked for Goldberg . The two then taught at Harvard together for 10 years and served in Washington together in the mid-1970s . &quot; I ' m guessing he ' ll be protective of civil_liberties , but that ' s an inference from the fact that he ' s generally a fairly liberal Democrat , &quot; Ely said . &quot; The only thing we ever discussed at length was deregulation. &quot; Another friend , Philip B . Heymann , who until recently was the Administration ' s deputy attorney_general , offers a compliment that not all_of Breyer ' s liberal doubters will find reassuring -- likening Breyer to the late Justice John M . Harlan , who was by many accounts the most distinguished justice of the last two generations , but who also dissented from many of the Warren court ' s liberal rulings . Like Harlan , Breyer has strong views , but also a deep intellectual honesty that allows his views to affect , but not decide , his judicial_decisions , Heymann said . &quot; You can ' t predict his positions , but you can detect his opinions , &quot; he says . Breyer ' s steady march toward the nation ' s highest_court began in San Francisco , where Irving Breyer and his wife , Anne , raised Stephen and his younger brother , Chuck , who is also now a lawyer , in a modest , two-story home_in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in the shadow of the University of San Francisco . Their street was bordered_on one side by the university and the other by a private college for women , symbolic , perhaps , of the place that education took_in the family ' s list of priorities . Education came easily to the young Breyer . In addition to his classes , he insisted that his parents , who were Jewish but religiously unobservant , send him to religious_school on Sundays , Chuck Breyer recalled . As a college_student , he later taught religious_school at a local synagogue . But Anne Breyer pushed constantly for him to be &quot; well-rounded , &quot; his brother recalled , chiding that -- if he did not put his books down and go outside -- he would end_up like her brother , Leo , a curmudgeonly man who taught for a brief time at Radcliffe College and then retired to a book-lined study for a life of reading and avoiding others . Mrs . Breyer insisted that her son take_part in sports , although he was not particularly good at them , and attend camp , although once there his tender feet quickly won him the nickname Blister King . Nonetheless , in a pattern that would become typical of his life , Breyer persevered and excelled , becoming an Eagle_Scout at 12 . &quot; He wasn ' t very popular but he was_well known as the troop brain , &quot; recalled his Scoutmaster , Bob Anino . The Breyer boys attended the city ' s prestigious Lowell High_School , the elite academy of the San Francisco public_school system . There , Steve Breyer took an active part in the school debate team , competing against the_likes_of future Gov . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr. , who attended rival St . Ignatius Loyola High_School . In 1955 , Breyer graduated with only one B marring an otherwise straight-A record . He was voted &quot; most likely to succeed. &quot; &quot; He was one of the brightest kids in my 30 years at Lowell , &quot; said Paul Lucey , his economics and social_science teacher . Breyer wanted to go_on to Harvard but bowed to the wishes of his parents , who feared , again , that he would become too bookish , and attended Stanford instead . After graduating , he won a Marshall Scholarship to attend Oxford , where he picked_up a fascination with economics , then went_on to study law at Harvard , where he became an editor of the law review and quickly developed a reputation as one of the school ' s bright lights . In the spring of 1964 , Breyer received word that Goldberg had selected him as a clerk for the high_court term beginning in October . Historians recall the 1964-65 term primarily because of Griswold vs . Connecticut , in which the court for the first time recognized a constitutional right_to_privacy in sexual matters . The court held that states could not forbid married_couples from buying or using contraceptives , a ruling that laid the grounds for Roe vs . Wade a decade later that guaranteed women the right to abortion . Breyer , according to fellow clerks , helped Goldberg draft his opinion . But the opinion ' s central idea that a right_to_privacy could be grounded in the Ninth Amendment , which protects rights not listed elsewhere in the Bill of Rights , was one that Goldberg had toyed_with earlier and provides little evidence of Breyer ' s views . Over the next several years , Breyer worked in the Justice_Department ' s antitrust division . He also met the woman who in 1967 became his wife . She is the former Joanna Hare , an Englishwoman who then was working as an assistant in the Washington office of London ' s Sunday Times . Joanna Breyer , now a psychologist at Boston ' s Dana Farber Clinic , was the daughter of Lord John Blakenham , a British political figure who was a leader of Britain ' s Conservative_Party . The marriage contributed heavily to Breyer ' s current wealth . According to his financial disclosure forms , which report assets in broad categories , the couple has at least $ 3.2 million and perhaps as much as $ 6.7 million . From Washington , Breyer returned to Harvard to teach regulatory law but he continued to visit the capital , working for several months in 1973 on the Watergate prosecutions , joining two other Harvard colleagues as aides to special prosecutor Archibald Cox . In 1974 , he accepted Kennedy ' s offer to head the staff of the Judiciary Committee ' s subcommittee on administrative_law . In 1979 , he returned to Washington again , this time as the Judiciary Committee ' s chief counsel . That background , plus his years on the bench , made Breyer an immediate candidate for the &quot; short_list &quot; of high_court nominees when Clinton returned the White_House to Democratic hands . Indeed , when he arrived in Washington last year for a luncheon interview with Clinton , in pain from a bicycle accident in which he had broken a rib , White_House officials and Breyer ' s friends believed the Supreme Court job that was then open would be his . That afternoon , as he stretched_out on the floor of White_House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum ' s office to rest , officials told him to delay his return to Cambridge and begin preparing an acceptance speech . But , as Clinton pondered his choice , Breyer ' s lack of an engaging life_story -- a factor that has always had strong appeal_to the President -- did him in . Clinton opted instead for Ginsburg , a pioneer in women ' s rights whose biography offered more excitement . Breyer , disappointed , returned to Cambridge but characteristically avoided any negative comment about Clinton ' s selection and conspicuously attended Ginsburg ' s swearing-in ceremony . One year later , with the White_House already finding that it had more excitement than it could handle , a nominee with a conventional background and broad support in the Senate seemed newly appealing . Breyer ' s time had come . Times staff writer Richard A . Serrano contributed to this story from San Francisco .</TEXT>
