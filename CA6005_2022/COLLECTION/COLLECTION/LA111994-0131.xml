   <HEADLINE> STORMY WEATHER LEADING TO PRICIER THANKSGIVING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Vegetables for Thanksgiving dinner may be pricier and punier because of severe storm damage to Southern Florida farmland . &quot; Right now , much of America ' s Thanksgiving dinner is under water , &quot; Florida Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford said . Tropical Storm Gordon caused an estimated $ 200 million to $ 225 million in damage to vegetable crops in southern Florida , which supplies about half of the nation ' s winter produce . In addition , the state could lose up_to $ 70 million of its sugar_cane harvest , state officials said . About 100 # 000 acres of cane were damaged , but the full extent of the loss would not be known until after Thanksgiving . High winds shredded thousands of acres of leafy_vegetable crops , such_as lettuce and celery , and torrential rains washed_away other crops , including squash , sweet_corn , tomatoes , green_beans , peppers , eggplants and potatoes . Gordon zigzagged across Florida early in the week , reaching hurricane strength Thursday off North Carolina . It weakened into a tropical storm again Friday and turned_back toward Florida , causing forecasters there to again keep a wary eye on its track . Ray Gilmer , spokesman for the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Growers Assn. , said Gordon ' s timing was particularly bad because growers are just about to enter the peak period of their growing year . &quot; During the winter months , a lot of these vegetables are only grown here in Florida , &quot; Gilmer said . &quot; that ' s why the timing of this storm was so critical. &quot; Gilmer said standing water was the biggest threat , as crops too wet to save would have to be replanted . &quot; The next few days will decide , &quot; Gilmer said . &quot; When those fields dry_out , you ' ll be able to tell if ( the plants ) can be saved or if there ' s been too_much damage. &quot; Only citrus growers escaped the storm relatively unscathed . Ken Kennedy , owner and president of United Indian River Packers Inc. , said Gordon would cause brief delays in harvesting that shouldn ' t result in higher prices . Judy Decker , a spokeswoman for American Stores Inc. in Dublin , Calif. , said the crop damage in Florida has created more demand for California produce and pushed prices higher there . While some retailers said Friday they had no choice but to raise prices , several other companies said they ' ll stick_to advertised specials and honor discounts on Thanksgiving menu favorites . &quot; We expect to be able to maintain our pricing throughout the Thanksgiving holiday period , &quot; said Stan Sorkin , a vice_president at Pathmark Stores Inc. , which operates supermarkets in the mid-Atlantic states . &quot; After Thanksgiving , we expect prices to rise on the commodities affected by the hurricane. &quot; Al Bagoly , produce director for Food Gallery , a chain of four Pittsburgh , Pa. , supermarkets , said he bought bell_peppers for $ 10.50 a box last week , before the storm hit the Florida coast . He said suppliers are now asking $ 19 to $ 24 a box .</TEXT>
