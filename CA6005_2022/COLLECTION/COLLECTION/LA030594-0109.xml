   <HEADLINE> HEARTH AND SOUL ; WHETHER CONTEMPORARY OR ANTIQUE , A MANTELPIECE ADDS A WARMTH OF ITS OWN TO A ROOM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For centuries the fireplace was our source of heat and light , the place we cooked meals , warmed quilts , dried clothes , read books , the place the family met in the morning and gathered at the end of the day . Today , we may get heat from a gas_furnace and light from an electric_current , but a crackling fire still has a magnetism that is hard to resist . Sometimes a home comes_with just the right one , sometimes not . Increasingly , homeowners seem willing to change a mantelpiece to reflect their tastes , whether contemporary , traditional or antique . Designer and author Alexandra Stoddard knows firsthand the difference a mantelpiece can make . When she married , she and her furniture moved_into a Park_Avenue apartment . The apartment was roomy and handsome , but Stoddard quickly discovered that the 1920s English-style painted mantel that dominated the living_room was at_odds with her own light and airy French Provincial style . &quot; The proportions looked all wrong , &quot; she says . &quot; The mantel just towered over the furniture. &quot; Her solution was a direct one : Instead of trying to make the furniture she loved fit the architecture , she changed the architecture to fit the furniture , replacing the_English mantel with an antique French one . Stripped and bleached , the new mantel transformed the room . But that fabulous mantel is not always so easy to find . Too often the style is right but the size is wrong . Or the size is right , but the materials are wrong . And when everything is right , the price may be way over budget -- a good antique mantel can cost $ 6 # 000 or more . that ' s where reproduction mantelpieces can come_to the rescue . With a reproduction , you not only have a wide selection of styles to choose from , but you also can often dictate size and proportion . &quot; For many people , choosing a reproduction is a matter of simply not being able to find the right antique , &quot; says Sylvia Bianchi , West Coast manager of Danny Alessandro Ltd. , a company that deals in both antique and reproduction mantels . Mantelpieces , as we know them , date to the 17th and early 18th centuries , when European architects began borrowing designs from classical Rome . &quot; There weren ' t fireplace surrounds in ancient Rome , so what the architects did was adapt the whole notion of door and window_frames , &quot; explains John Bivins , an architectural historian and woodcarver . &quot; A mantel is essentially the shelf at the top of a door frame with an entablature underneath . The overmantel is a window. &quot; Most of today ' s reproduction mantelpieces fall_into three broad style categories : English , Federal or American and French . English mantels , inspired by 18th- and early 19th-century originals , tend to be formal and ornate , and often sport carvings of fruit , flowers or seashells . Federal mantels are plainer , with more austere geometric decorations . French mantels are often softly curved . French reproductions are available in both wood and cast stone , a molded material made of stone dust . A true reproduction mantel is taken line for line from an antique model . The Winterthur Museum , for instance , has commissioned Driwood Moulding , a South Carolina company , to produce exact copies of the mantel and overmantel from its famous Port Royal Parlor . Danny Alessandro Ltd . and the William H . Jackson Co. , which deal in antique mantels , both offer reproductions based on pieces from their collections . Typically a mantel is between 54 and 60 inches high with a 42-to 55-inch opening , but wood mantels can be custom-ordered in different sizes . Although these are not true reproductions in the strictest sense , adaptations are a real help if you have an unusual fireplace opening to fit or an awkwardly shaped room . Once you ' ve selected a mantel style , the company will help you through the ordering process , which is relatively easy . If you ' re ordering a wood mantel , you ' ll have a choice of several finishes , or no finish at all . The only measurements needed are that of the firebox opening , but you should mention any nearby windows , architectural elements or other limitations that may affect the size of the mantel shelf . Another important consideration -- one that did not trouble our ancestors -- is building codes , which can sometimes be met only by a custom-size design . ( Some codes require , for instance , at least seven inches of non-flammable surround between the fireplace opening and the wood mantel. ) If you can ' t find what you need in catalogues of existing reproductions , some companies will work from photographs to make a copy . You can decide just how close to the original you want , but remember that the price goes_up sharply if the manufacturer can ' t use stock components . A beautiful fireplace warms a room in any season . And a good reproduction has a special glow , linking us to the days when the hearth was truly the heart of the home .</TEXT>
