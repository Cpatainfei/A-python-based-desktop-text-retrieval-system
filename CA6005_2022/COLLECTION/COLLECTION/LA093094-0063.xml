   <HEADLINE> GETTING THE BIG PICTURE ; THE NEW EXHIBIT AT BURBANK ' S NATURAL_HISTORY MUSEUM WILL OFFER FACTS AND EXPLORE MYSTERIES ABOUT WHALES , DOLPHINS AND PORPOISES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We are moved by the plight of whales and their relatives , even to_the_point of identifying with them , and yet what do we really know about them ? The problem , of course , is that they live_in the oceans , and we rarely , if ever , get an unobstructed view of them in that vast , mysterious habitat . The conditions for observing whales , dolphins and porpoises in the wild are , in the words of expert John Heyning , &quot; terrible , which is the reason we know relatively little about them. &quot; What we do know about whales and their relatives , including discoveries made only recently , is the subject of a major new exhibit opening Saturday at the Natural_History Museum of Los Angeles County / Burbank . The show , which will embark_on a six-year international tour after its Burbank run , has taken three years to create . Called &quot; Masters of the Ocean Realm : Whales , Dolphins &amp; Porpoises , &quot; it will include life-size models of seven different species in their natural habitats and will address such persistent puzzles as the daily life of cetaceans ( the creatures ' family_name ) and why some individuals end_up stranded each year on the world ' s beaches . As the tremendous popularity of &quot; Free Willy &quot; made clear , cetaceans have an enormous mystic . &quot; They ' re like dinosaurs , &quot; says James Mead , curator of marine mammals at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington . Why ? &quot; They ' re big , they ' re physically attractive , &quot; he notes , and , perhaps most important , they ' re no immediate threat to us . According to Heyning , head of the Natural_History Museum ' s Marine Mammal Program , the new show is especially timely because so_much has been learned about whales and their relatives in recent years . There is still much to discover , he says , such_as just how many species there are , exactly what they look_like and how they behave . But , thanks to new techniques , including DNA analysis and electronic tagging , we are beginning to find_out more and more about the charismatic sea creatures . Among the important recent discoveries : half_a_dozen newly identified species , including a second species of common_dolphin . Scientists have also learned recently that female killer and pilot_whales undergo something akin to menopause , once thought unique to humans . Heyning is the man people call when they find a stranded whale , dolphin or porpoise on a Southern California beach . As he explains , the museum has been collecting and studying stranded cetaceans since the 1960s . As a result , the Los Angeles museum has a collection of skeletons and other remains second only to that of the Smithsonian Institution -- a total of more_than 3 # 000 specimens . Heyning and his volunteers collect 25 to 30 stranded whales and other cetaceans a year , often using a truck equipped with a special whale-sized winch to haul the creature off the beach , especially important during the hot summer months , and deliver it to the Marine Mammal Program ' s research station in Vernon . There the cetacean corpses are flensed ( stripped of their blubber ) and scrutinized for clues about everything from the individual ' s age ( which can often be determined like that of a tree , by studying ring-like markings within the teeth ) to what it had for dinner . The study of stranded individuals has revised conventional wisdom about many marine mammals , Heyning says . In recent decades , scientists have learned that the humpback is not a rotund leviathan with an eggplant-colored hide , but a much more streamlined , dark blue-gray creature . Cetacean autopsies have also revealed how a species of beaked whale manages to eat prodigiously without teeth : It uses its tongue like a piston to suck_in squid . To strip his cetacean skeletons , Heyning employs a traditional helper : the larva of the dermestid beetle . Harsh chemicals can harm the bones , and enzyme cleansers are temperamental and expensive , he explains . &quot; I ' d rather do_it the old-fashioned organic way , &quot; he says . Besides , he adds , &quot; they work for cheap. &quot; DNA testing -- the very stuff that is making headlines in the O.J. Simpson case -- is also revolutionizing the study of whales and their more diminutive relatives . Conservationists recently used DNA analysis to prove that some Japanese markets were illegally selling the flesh of protected whale species . Modern science ' s ability to read a particular cetacean ' s genetic profile is also illuminating in other ways . Explains Heyning : &quot; We ' ve learned a lot recently about the social_systems of whales using DNA . You can actually dart them with a small arrow and take a tiny skin sample. &quot; Analysis of the resulting DNA has shown that male pilot_whales typically stay in their mothers ' pods but do not father the young in those groups . A similar pattern of outbreeding seems to be typical of killer_whales . One of the seven main exhibits will show how killer_whales , or orcas , hunt cooperatively . The show will also feature a model of a Tlingit Indian woman of the Northwest , telling the traditional tale of how the orca came_into being . According to Tlingit lore , the orca was carved out of yellow_cedar by Naatsilanei , who created the animals to take revenge on the jealous brothers-in-law who tried to kill him . In some ways the scientific story of the origins of the killer_whale and other cetaceans is much harder to believe . As Heyning explains , the common ancestor of whales , dolphins and porpoises is the 55-million-year-old mesonychid , a meat-eating ungulate that lived_on land and looked_like an extremely unpleasant short-legged dog . Visitors to the show will be able to see how the cetaceans evolved from this ancient ancestor to live_in the sea , how the nostrils migrated to the top of the head and became blow holes , how the tail widened into flukes . One of the exhibits in the show utilizes fiber optics so that visitors can compare the bones in the human arm with the bones in the flipper of their very , very distant cousin , the white-sided dolphin . Whales have also found an unusual place on the information superhighway in recent years as a result of electronic tagging , Heyning says . &quot; The new electronic tags are essentially small computers , &quot; he points_out . A scientist can now sit before his or her computer_screen and see data about the depth or duration of a dive being transmitted directly from a tagged whale -- a veritable cyber-cetacean . But technology hasn ' t begun to answer all_the questions scientists still have about these glorious sea mammals , Heyning says . One example : Milk has been found in the stomach of a 15-year-old sperm_whale . Since a whale that age has long been able to feed_on its own , observers wonder if the milk doesn ' t reflect some not yet known aspect of the social behavior of the animals . * The organizers of the show have tried to make_it as captivating as possible , reasoning that a spoonful of theatricality makes the hard science go_down . Among the hands-on exhibits will be a jukebox that features the cetacean Top 40 , recordings of the songs and vocalizations of dozens of whales , dolphins and porpoises . Each of the dioramas has also been designed , according to Heyning , &quot; to give you an idea of what it ' s like to be out there in the field , at least as much as you can if you ' re not Disney. &quot; For example , the exhibit on the narwhal , a whale with a single unicorn-like tusk , will allow visitors to imagine they are hunting the creature in a vinyl Zodiac , the contemporary craft of choice among the Arctic Inuit , who are allowed to hunt the otherwise protected mammals . Conservation is one of the themes of the show , and to illustrate it the organizers chose to focus_on the Gulf_of_California harbor_porpoise , described by Heyning as one of the most endangered cetaceans in the world . Threatened with extinction because of gill-net fishing , the animals have dwindled to perhaps 200 individuals . Devoted as he is to saving the whales and their cousins , Heyning hopes that visitors to the exhibit will come_away with an understanding of how complex conservation issues are . Human and animal interests are sometimes difficult to balance , he points_out . Some 10 # 000 dolphins and porpoises are killed each year off the coast of Peru , caught for food by people who are starved for protein . A similar number die_off the coast of equally hungry Sri Lanka . It ' s easy for well-fed Americans to denounce the slaughter , Heyning says , but in fact there are no easy answers to such ecological dilemmas .
