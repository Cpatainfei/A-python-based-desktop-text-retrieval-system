   <HEADLINE> A FOOT IN THE LOCAL DOOR ; IN MISSION VIEJO , U.S. SOCCER TEAM ALREADY IS A WINNER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the rest of the world works itself into a fever over professional soccer ' s World Cup , the United States seems successfully inoculated . Even the sport ' s name is different here : It ' s called football everywhere else.But sometimes the low-key atmosphere is not such a bad thing . For more_than a year , the U.S. soccer team has had its training center in Mission Viejo . Local residents helped candidates for the team learn the neighborhood , find good restaurants , pick motels and apartments . The players reciprocated , happily signing autographs for youngsters , standing_still for photographs , behaving like nice guys instead of spoiled brats . It proved a refreshing change from millionaires in American baseball , basketball and football occasionally insulting fans and even charging for autographs . Although youth soccer has long been popular here , American professional players run no risk of being mobbed while walking down the street . There is a faint chance that could change in less than two weeks , when World Cup play begins in the United States for the first time . The quadrennial event will obviously stir passions among the sizable number of Americans born in countries where soccer is the dominant sport ; scalpers are already bidding up tickets for the championship match at the Rose Bowl July 17 . But so far , many Southern California fans have enjoyed seeing the practices from front-row seats in a casual atmosphere , much as baseball fans could during spring_training decades ago . The team , which in past World Cup years lived_out of suitcases while moving from town to town , got a sense of stability , thanks to Mission Viejo . It ' s been fun having the players train locally , and they will break_camp in a week with the paradox intact : A country that makes heroes of athletes largely ignores sportsmen who would be lionized abroad .</TEXT>
