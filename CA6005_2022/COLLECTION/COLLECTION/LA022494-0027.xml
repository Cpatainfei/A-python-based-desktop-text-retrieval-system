   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / BARRY GLASSNER : ' DOWNSIZINGS ' TRANSLATE TO HUMAN MISERY ; UNNECESSARY CORPORATE SHUFFLES SHOULD MEET CONSUMER BOYCOTTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An eager young_man from AT &amp; T called during dinner . He cheerfully offered me $ 75 if I would switch from my current long-distance carrier . I told him what AT &amp; T can do with their 75 bucks . Usually , I ' m polite to telephone sales people , even when my mouth is_full of fish , but I was angry at the man ' s employer . A few hours earlier , AT &amp; T had announced plans to lay off 15 # 000 employees . Who knows , the fellow who called me might be among those tossed into the street . In retrospect , I feel guilty about the way I treated him . But I ' m fed up with companies laying_off their workers . I know too many people who have lost their homes and their self-esteem in unnecessary downsizings . AT &amp; T is just the latest in a string of profitable companies over the past few months that have turned thousands of lives upside down . Last month , it was Scott Paper ( 8 # 300 people ) . In December it was Xerox ( 10 # 000 ) . November was Philip Morris ( 14 # 000 ) and Bell South ( 10 # 200 ) . The excuse is always the same : &quot; international competitiveness. &quot; The real reason is greed . A company ' s stock price almost always rises after it announces a big layoff . The misery rate for employees also increases sharply -- for those laid_off and also for those who remain . The survivors have to do twice as much work in an environment where everybody ' s demoralized and waiting for the next ax to fall . In the case of a service company like AT &amp; T , customers will almost certainly suffer as well . What ' s going_to put an end to layoff mania ? An improving economy hasn ' t done the trick . American corporations announced 108 # 000 layoffs last month , the highest number in four years , more_than at the peak of the recession . Neither does experience seem to deter corporate officials . The American Management Assn . recently surveyed 900 executives at companies that had downsized . Sixty percent said they had seen no productivity gain and one in five actually admitted to declining earnings . Only a revolt by socially responsible investors can push CEOs to change their ways . Promiscuous downsizing should be up there beside despoiling the environment , doing business in South_Africa and producing weapons , tobacco and alcohol . Refusing to invest in companies that downsize not only makes_good ethical sense , it also makes_good investment sense . While a company ' s stock may rise just after a mass layoff is announced , the effect is usually short-term . A study by Mitchell &amp; Co . of the 16 largest downsizers of the mid-1980s found that the stock prices for these companies trailed their competitors ' by an average of 26 % three years after they restructured . The revolt by investors could be augmented by a consumer revolt . Every time we hear a company brag about layoffs , we should make a mental note and stop giving them our money . I can just see the bumper sticker : Ma Bell with a diagonal red_line across her face .</TEXT>
