   <HEADLINE> STUDY OF GULF VETERANS ' ILLNESSES URGED ; MILITARY : NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH SAYS EXTENSIVE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND UNDERLYING CAUSES . 20 # 000 TROOPS REPORTED SYMPTOMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A National Institutes of Health panel recommended Friday that extensive research be conducted into the mysterious spate of illnesses reported by men and women who served in the Persian_Gulf_War . The committee concluded that the &quot; complex biological , chemical , physical and psychological environment &quot; of the operation produced a range of illnesses &quot; with overlapping symptoms and causes &quot; and that collaborative government-supported programs should be established to study them . The committee &quot; was moved by the extent of suffering among Persian_Gulf veterans , &quot; said Dr. Gareth Green , professor of environmental health at the Harvard_University School of Public Health , who served as chairman . &quot; There is a clear need for continuing and compassionate care_for these veterans as well as concerted research efforts to understand the underlying causes of these illnesses. &quot; Nearly 700 # 000 troops served in the Persian_Gulf in 1990 and 1991 . The panel estimated that 20 # 000 or more of them have reported an array of debilitating symptoms , including fatigue , skin_rash , muscle and joint pain , headache , memory_loss , shortness of breath and gastrointestinal and respiratory problems . No single substance or organism has been identified as the sole cause of the health_problems , although many of the troops were exposed to a variety of potentially toxic chemicals , such_as fumes and smoke from oil_well fires , toxic pesticides and uranium used in munitions and armor . In urging the study , panel member David W . Gorman , deputy national legislative director of the Disabled American Veterans , recalled the health consequences of Agent_Orange , an herbicide used during the Vietnam_War . After many years of controversy , exposure to it ultimately was blamed for health_problems experienced by Vietnam_War veterans . The Persian_Gulf Veterans Coordinating Board , which includes representatives from the departments_of_Defense , Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services , said in a statement that it would &quot; carefully review &quot; the panel ' s recommendations . The board , established to coordinate interdepartmental activities aimed at resolving health concerns of Persian_Gulf veterans , said it supports further studies and predicted that they &quot; will bring us closer to answers concerning the causes and cures for unexplained Gulf War illnesses. &quot; The three departments already are engaged in more_than 20 research projects related to health , environmental effects , chemical_agents and depleted uranium during the war , the statement said . The board urged veterans experiencing health_problems to contact a VA medical_center for a free examination . The panel also recommended sending a health questionnaire to all_of the nation ' s 700 # 000 veterans , or a representative_sample in an effort to uncover health_problems . The panel attributed cases of leishmaniasis -- a parasitic infection transmitted by the bite of sand_flies -- and post-traumatic stress disorder to service in the Persian_Gulf . The committee urged the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop &quot; more responsive and effective approaches &quot; for the diagnosis and treatment of stress-related illness . Stress-related disorders have been associated in the past with service in Vietnam and in the two world_wars , although they were identified belatedly . Persian_Gulf service &quot; was an experience of unprecedented stress for our military and their families , &quot; Green said . &quot; The known threat of chemical or biological_warfare by the Iraqis had a tremendous psychological impact . . . . We must learn more about the influencing effects of the central_nervous_system on immunological , cardiac , respiratory and gastrointestinal function. &quot;</TEXT>
