   <TEXT> When Larry and Linda Gross of Encino were married in 1990 , both had already traveled thousands of miles -- he primarily in Europe and South_America , she in Europe and Asia. &quot; That left Africa &quot; for a 5 1 / 2-week honeymoon , Larry says . The couple arrived_at the Karnak Temples in Luxor on a July afternoon when temperatures hovered at about 120 degrees . &quot; We didn ' t realize it would be that hot , &quot; Gross says , but they were not distracted . &quot; This is our memory of Africa . It seemed like time had stood still. &quot;</TEXT>
