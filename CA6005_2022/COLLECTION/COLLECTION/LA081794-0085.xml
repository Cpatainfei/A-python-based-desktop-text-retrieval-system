   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; POSTCARDS FROM CYBERSPACE ; LATEST PROOF OF CYBERCITIZENSHIP IS ' HYPERTEXT HOME PAGE ' ADDRESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you think having your electronic_mail address on your business_card is sufficient proof of cybercitizenship , you might have to think again . The latest cachet in cyberspace-aware business_cards is having an &quot; http home page &quot; address for people to access . The ubiquitous e-mail address is only good for sending or receiving electronic messages . But the http home page address , otherwise known as HyperText Transport Protocol , is a good way of letting others get information about you or your company . There are several ways to browse http home pages if you don ' t have Mosaic or aren ' t directly connected to the Internet . If you have Lynx , you can simply type lynx at the prompt , then type g followed by the http address you want . Be warned : Some http home page addresses are quite lengthy , and must be typed exactly as shown , including correct use of upper- and lower-case_letters . For example , type g , space , http : / / info.cern.ch / hypertext / DataSources / WWW / Servers.html for a geographic guide to thousands of home pages to browse . If you don ' t have a direct Internet connection to your machine , it ' s difficult to set_up a homepage address . But some entrepreneurs have begun offering complete home page service on_their_own machines for companies and individuals who can ' t set one up themselves . To see a good_example of this kind of service , type g http : / / www.internet-is.com / from within Lynx . For alternate access to a World Wide Web_browser , you can use the Telnet service . Type telnet fatty.law.cornell.edu and then type www at the log-in prompt . This will start_up the Lynx browser program , which you can use to navigate home pages . Here is a selected list of http home pages : * http : / / www.scubed.com : 8001 / caltrans / transnet.html ( updated traffic reports ) * http : / / smaug.ucr.edu / Quakes / quakepage.html ( current earthquake information ) * http : / / www.acns.nwu.edu / internet / bdgtti / ( Big Dummy ' s Guide to the Internet ) A list of new California sites is available at http : / / www.llnl.gov / ptools / california.servers.htmlca.new and is updated every few days .
