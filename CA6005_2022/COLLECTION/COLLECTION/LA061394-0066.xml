   <HEADLINE> O.C. ENTERPRISE : THE PENULTIMATE WORKOUT ; COLLECTIVE STAMINA HELPS IRVINE SOFTWARE COMPANY SURVIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every day at 4:15 a.m. , Paul Mondschein rises for his morning workout . First it ' s him against the stair-climbing machine , then he does about 2 # 500 sit ups . He faces even more punishment with free weights and Nautilus machines . Sometimes he plays squash . It ' s always about 90 minutes long . On weekends , its up_to three to five hours . He says rigorous exercise is the only thing that keeps him sane as chief_executive of a start-up company , PenUltimate Inc. , in the treacherous world of designing software for pen-based computers . Mondschein and PenUltimate ' s 26 employees say it ' s their collective stamina that helps them survive in a business where the body_count is high ; the best known victim was Momenta Corp. , a Silicon_Valley company that lost $ 40 million before it collapsed in 1992 . The losers staked their companies on widespread acceptance of pen technology , where a computer user enters computer data by placing a pen directly on the screen , thereby replacing the mouse and traditional keyboard . By now , the pen computing market was supposed to be $ 3 billion a year . The technology was billed as a more intuitive way of entering data into a computer . Some companies , like Momenta and Apple Computer Inc. with its widely criticized Newton , also tried to create computers that recognized handwriting . But Mondschein , 45 , says 3-year-old PenUltimate has survived because of its tenacity , its willingness to undergo mid-course corrections , and its foresight in relying_on more_than just pen computing . As religiously as he pushes himself in his workouts , Mondschein works seven days a week . His favorite Latin slogan is &quot; Nocte dieque incubando , &quot; which translates to &quot; by thinking_about it day and night. &quot; &quot; In the early days we were pigeon-holed as another pen computing company , &quot; he said . &quot; We tried a different approach . Pen was a technology , but mobile computing is a real market . Within that market , we decided to focus_on . . . ( making ) the salesperson ' s job easier. &quot; PenUltimate has become the only company pitching in-depth sales automation software to structure a traveling salesperson ' s life , according to an analysis by the Gartner Group , a market researcher in Stamford , Conn . Its software uses a pen mainly to take electronic notes , which can be stored in the computer and passed_on to a sales manager . No handwriting recognition for translating writing into typewritten text is involved . And it can even run with a keyboard , instead of an electronic pen . The biggest selling point is the software ' s ability to analyze data and predict -- based on sales patterns from previous customers -- when a sale might close . For instance , at any given point in the sales cycle , the software predicts the odds of a successful sale . &quot; Their name starts with the word ' pen , ' but I don ' t think_of them as a pen-based computer company , &quot; said Thomas Betcher , an analyst for the Paulson Investment Co . in Portland . &quot; They ' re serious about offering solutions to mobile people. &quot; Mondschein joined Larry Taylor , a software veteran who worked for Orange County ' s MAI Systems Corp. , to start the company in August , 1991 . Mondschein and Taylor raised $ 73 # 500 from family and friends ; Mondschein ' s home serves as collateral for the four-year lease on the company ' s Irvine headquarters . Since the beginning , almost nothing has turned_out the way they expected . Mondschein said he couldn ' t find any venture_capitalists willing to take a risk with his fledgling company . He has since come_to consider that a bit of luck , he says . &quot; The most dangerous thing for a young company is to have too_much money , &quot; he said . &quot; Momenta ' s mistake was having $ 40 million &quot; in investor money . PenUltimate ' s initial software was created to run_on what is now considered an obsolete software_system . On Taylor ' s advice , the company switched after a_few months to adapt its programs to run_on what has become the surviving technology , Microsoft Corp. ' s Windows for Pen operating system . The company also decided against selling a computing_system to law_enforcement agencies , so that police or sheriff ' s deputies , for example , could use the systems to automatically write traffic tickets . But it took too long for government_agencies to decide whether to invest in the systems , so PenUltimate shelved that project . Meanwhile , the initial burst of pen technology was a nationwide bomb in the early 1990s . Among the few survivors are systems designed for delivery drivers , where pen computers are convenient . PenUltimate raised $ 4 million in a public offering in December , which gave it the money to sell its main product , SalesForce . Its strategy has been to equip its own traveling salespeople with pen computers and the software , which organizes their sales pitches and simplifies communication with bosses . And last month , the company raised an additional $ 1.9 million in a private offering . PenUltimate has signed about a dozen contracts , but sales are a pittance so far . For the nine months ended March 31 , the company reported revenue of $ 129 # 093 , compared to zero sales the year before . The company lost $ 2.3 million , compared to a loss of $ 883 # 171 . On a per share basis , the loss was $ 1.76 , compared to $ 1.13 a year earlier . The future is still unsure , but Mondschein said he is confident because the company has a backlog of 1 # 600 copies of its software , which sells for $ 1 # 500 to $ 2 # 500 , depending_on the size of the order . Over the next few months , the company will begin filling most of its initial orders . A five-month delay in the public offering , blamed on slow processing by the California Department of Corporations , set the firm back . But Paul McBride , chief financial_officer , estimates the company can break_even in the quarter ending Sept . 30 . By July , PenUltimate expects to supply up_to 500 copies of its software to the IBM Personal_Computer Co . PenUltimate hopes to benefit from the resuscitation of pen computing as a niche industry . The cost of pen technology has fallen and now the feature is marketed mainly as a supplement to a keyboard , not as a replacement . IBM ' s ThinkPad computers come_with both keyboards and pens , selling for prices from $ 2 # 899 to $ 3 # 399 . Jim Alfaro , program manager of pen computing at IBM , says his sales representatives love the PenUltimate software because it frees them from tedious report writing . &quot; When Miller Time comes_around for the salesperson , the last thing they want to be stuck doing is writing reports to the boss , &quot; Mondschein said . &quot; With our software , they just hit a button and the ( handwritten ) report is sent over the phone_line to the boss. &quot; Alfaro also likes PenUltimate ' s SalesForce : Central version for managers because it gives him instant updates on sales forecasts for the coming quarter from all_of his salespeople . &quot; Right now , I have no way of telling exactly what is happening with the potential sales , &quot; Alfaro said . &quot; Forecasting is where most sales organizations fall_down and shoot in the dark. &quot;</TEXT>
