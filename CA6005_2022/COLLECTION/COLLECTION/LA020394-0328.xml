   <HEADLINE> DRUG TO BOOST MILK OUTPUT SET FOR SALE ; BIOTECHNOLOGY : WHILE IT MAY NOT BE A BLOCKBUSTER FOR MONSANTO , IT IS EXPECTED TO BE A KEY TEST OF CONSUMER REACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Monsanto Corp . on Friday will begin selling a synthetic drug for cows that can lead to significant increases in milk production , thus opening a crucial new chapter in the arduous and controversial development of genetically engineered products . The drug , to be marketed under the brand name Posilac , is not expected to be a blockbuster for the St . Louis-based company . But the way consumers react to its use could set the tone for the planned introduction of a wide range of foods designed in biotechnology laboratories . The vocal opponents of Posilac , a genetically engineered form of a naturally occurring substance called bovine somatotropin , or BST , hope to add_to a list of creameries and retailers that have already pledged not to carry dairy_products derived from the milk of cows treated with the supplement . Demonstrations , including milk-dumping protests , are scheduled for today in a dozen cities nationwide , including West Hollywood . The critics claim that BST is unsafe . * Sale of BST was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last year , but was delayed by a moratorium included in last year ' s budget bill . The moratorium expires today . The introduction of BST is not likely to produce any immediate changes in either the availability or price of milk and other dairy_products . Scientists in and out of government say consumers will not see any difference between milk from treated or untreated cows and that repeated studies have shown there is none . However , depending_on how widely BST is accepted by dairy_farmers , experts have said it could speed_up a trend toward fewer but larger dairy_farms that has been transforming the dairy landscape over the last 40 years . Many dairy_farmers view BST mainly as an economic issue . In the Midwestern heartland of the dairy industry , which already lags California in per-cow milk production and implementation of technological advances , farmers worry that failure to use the supplement will only increase their disadvantage . This year , California is expected to cement its status as the No . 1 dairy state , achieved for the first time last September and knocking longtime leader Wisconsin for an ego-deflating loop . But the opposition campaign , led by longtime biotechnology foe Jeremy Rifkin of the Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends , has succeeded in putting many farmers and consumers on edge with its claim that milk from BST-treated cows presents a &quot; serious public health risk &quot; -- a claim forcefully rejected by the FDA when it approved the use of Posilac . Monsanto said it will begin accepting orders from farmers today . Delivery of the drug will be immediate , the company said , but it cannot be used until nine weeks into a cow ' s lactation cycle ( which begins after calving ) , making its introduction in a dairy herd gradual . * Rifkin said again Wednesday that BST , by spurring cows to produce more milk , could lead to a greater incidence of infections in the animals , resulting in greater use of antibiotics and thus greater residues of antibiotics in milk . The federal_government sets and is supposed to monitor acceptable levels of antibiotic residues . The demonstration in West Hollywood today is scheduled to take_place at a Pavilions supermarket on Santa Monica Boulevard . A spokeswoman for Vons , parent company of Pavilions , said the firm was not aware of the plan . Vons said it has not taken a position on the use of BST .</TEXT>
