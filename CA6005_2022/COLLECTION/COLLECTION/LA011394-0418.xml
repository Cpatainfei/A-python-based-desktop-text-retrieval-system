   <HEADLINE> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY : THIS PUB SPECIALIZES IN SAKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shortly after Kazuhiro Kono arrived in America , he noticed an article in The Times predicting that Japanese cuisine would be the next big food craze . So he apprenticed at Hama Sushi in Little Tokyo , one of the establishments featured in that 1978 article , to learn the trade . Eight years and a dozen restaurant jobs later , Kono opened his own place , Fukuhime , in Gardena . Fukuhime is an ikaza-ya , a traditional Japanese pub serving a large variety of sakes . Something like a Spanish tapa bar , it offers 24 different sakes to accompany nearly 50 appetizers . There may be a sense of intrigue as one enters Fukuhime through the strands of rope that dangle from the doorway . In the center of the softly lit room is a colorful tangle of marine artifacts , including hanging abalone shells and dried fish . The walls are a curious mixture : classical Japanese prints , Kirin beer posters and removable slats , written in Japanese calligraphy , listing the dishes the restaurant offers . ( There ' s also a menu printed in English. ) A popular selection is yakitori ( $ 2 ) : two sticks of chicken , marinated in soy , ginger , garlic , sake and sugar , then grilled . Another good choice is the shimeji ( $ 3.80 ) , often called oyster_mushrooms , which are simply cooked with soy_sauce and butter . Chinese_cabbage ( $ 3.80 ) is sauteed with bacon and served with a light oyster sauce . Garlic lovers might try the green garlic sprout cooked with sliced beef ( $ 3.80 ) . Complete dinners , which include miso soup and rice , are also available . For instance , a combination of beef teriyaki and shrimp tempura ( $ 10.50 ) . For a more traditional Japanese taste , consider a dish billed as &quot; stamina tofu &quot; ( $ 3.80 ) , a purportedly energy-inducing concoction of fermented soybeans , sea_urchins , and mashed yams mixed into broth and topped with a quail egg . Perhaps the Raiders should stock up_on this before Sunday ' s big_game . Fukuhime is at 17905 S . Western Ave. , Gardena . 324-7077 . Open Monday through Friday 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. , and 5:30 p.m. to midnight , Saturday and Sunday 5:30 to 11 p.m. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</TEXT>
