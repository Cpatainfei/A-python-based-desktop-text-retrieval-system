   <HEADLINE> YOUR MONEY ; FINANCIAL MARKETS ; YIELDS FALL ; DOLLAR RISES DESPITE REPORT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bond yields continued to slide Tuesday , as market optimism intensified ahead of Federal_Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ' s congressional testimony . At the same time , the dollar rose strongly despite news that the U.S. trade_deficit widened in May . On Wall_Street , selling of some banking and technology stocks kept pressure on the broad market despite the ongoing bond rally . The Dow Jones industrials eased 7.12 points to 3 # 748.31. In the credit markets , the Treasury ' s key 30-year bond yield fell to 7.46 % from 7.50 % on Monday ; shorter-term yields also declined . The T-bond yield has been dropping steadily from its recent peak of 7.73 % on July 11 . Greenspan is to appear before a Senate panel today and Friday with updates on Fed economic and monetary policy . Recent reports suggesting that the economy slowed in the first_half of this year have convinced many analysts that the Fed won ' t raise short-term rates again before late August at the earliest . That sentiment has recently increased investors ' willingness to buy bonds . &quot; The tone of the market has turned constructive , &quot; said Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp . in Minneapolis . Meanwhile , in the currency market , rumors of unrest in North_Korea provided a reason for technically motivated traders to exchange Japanese yen for dollars , currency dealers said . &quot; Rumors started the ball rolling , but people were already looking_to buy dollars for technical reasons , &quot; said Zlatko Glamuzina , chief dealer for the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia . Though the Commerce_Department reported a widening of America ' s overall trade_deficit in May -- to $ 9.17 billion from $ 8.5 billion in April -- the U.S. deficit with Japan narrowed nearly 20 % to $ 4.4 billion . Some analysts were doubtful , however , that the deficit figure represented a turning point in America ' s longstanding trade imbalance with Japan . Still , currency dealers cheered the trade report , pushing_up the dollar in New York to 99.25 Japanese yen from 98.35 on Monday . The dollar also gained against the German mark , to 1.568 marks from 1.547 on Monday . On Wall_Street , stocks were mostly lower amid a flood of quarterly corporate earnings_reports . In the broader market , retreating issues outnumbered advancing ones 9 to 8 on the NYSE . Stocks traded_in a narrow range throughout the day as investors reacted to earnings_reports from some of the largest companies . GTE Corp. , General Electric , Sprint , TRW and Amgen were among those posting better-than-expected earnings , and their stocks rose accordingly . &quot; Earnings are coming_in just about right , and there have been some nice positive surprises , &quot; said Bill Allyn , managing director at Jefferies &amp; Co . But concern about earnings in certain sectors , particularly banking and technology , kept a lid on the market . Computer chip giant Intel , for example , announced earnings late Monday that were in_line with expectations . But the company also said its profit_margins shrank . The stock fell 1 5 / 8 to 57 on Tuesday . Chase Manhattan ' s strong earnings_report also was overshadowed by its remarks about tighter competition in the banking business . Chase shares slid 2 3 / 8 to 36 3 / 8 . Among other market highlights : * Technology stocks losing ground with Intel included software firm Lotus Development , which dropped 5 5 / 8 to 33 1 / 8 after saying that product delays and pricing pressure hurt its second-quarter results . Also , computer maker Compaq , which is scheduled to announce earnings today , fell 1 1 / 4 to 33 1 / 4 in heavy trading . Other losers included Computer Associates , down 7 / 8 to 40 ; Cirrus Logic , off 3 5 / 8 to 27 5 / 8 ; Powersoft , down 4 to 50 3 / 4 , and IBM , off 1 1 / 4 to 55 5 / 8 . * Banking stocks hit by selling included Signet , which sank 4 3 / 8 to 36 1 / 2 on its earnings_report . Among other falling issues , Citicorp dropped 1 1 / 4 to 40 3 / 4 , First Chicago eased 1 1 / 8 to 48 7 / 8 and BancOne lost 1 to 33 1 / 8 . But California banking issues were mixed , as_many California institutions reported strong quarterly earnings . First Interstate eased 7 / 8 to 78 and Wells Fargo slipped 1 1 / 4 to 157 1 / 2 , but Ahmanson inched up 1 / 8 to 20 1 / 8 and Union Bank was unchanged at 29 1 / 2 . * Southland-based biotechnology giant Amgen jumped 2 1 / 8 to 48 7 / 8 after its strong earnings_report prompted several Wall_Street brokerages to upgrade their ratings on the stock . * Merrill Lynch retreated 7 / 8 to 36 1 / 4 after reporting second-quarter earnings of $ 1.18 a share , compared to $ 1.52 in the equivalent three months of last year . That was below market expectations of $ 1.36 a share for the period . * PepsiCo was unchanged at 30 1 / 2 . The company said second-quarter profit rose 5 % , a sub-par performance that reflected lagging profits from the company ' s restaurants and beverage businesses abroad . Overseas , Frankfurt share prices rose sharply in the last few minutes of trading , as players covered short positions . The market mood was buoyed by hope for a Bundesbank rate cut Thursday . The 30-share DAX average closed 30.60 points higher at 2 # 128.79. Tokyo ' s 225-share Nikkei average ended 57.52 points higher at 20 # 775.16 ; London ' s Financial Times 100-share average rose 9.3 points to 3 # 091.3.
