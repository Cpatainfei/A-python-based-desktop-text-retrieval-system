   <HEADLINE> POP EYE : SOME CROW WHILE OTHERS JUST KVETCH ; COMPANIES THAT ARE PLUGGED IN TO THE NEWEST ARTISTS ARE THE ONES THAT FARE BEST IN THE LATEST EDITION OF RECORD COMPANY SCORECARD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You can debate all you want about what is valued more in pop_music -- image or craft , melody or rhythm , physical beauty or artistic vision . But here ' s the one common_denominator in today ' s pop world : change . Of the year ' s 25 best-selling albums ( as of Dec . 12 ) , guess how many were made by artists whom pop fans would have recognized just five years ago ? Two : Salt-N-Pepa and Pink Floyd are the only &quot; veterans. &quot; Even Mariah Carey , who sells so many records you ' d think she ' d been around forever , didn ' t surface until 1990 , making her a veritable old-timer next to such ' 95 hit-makers as Ace of Base , Counting Crows , Boyz II Men , Green Day , Candlebox , Warren G and Offspring , an Orange County-based indie band who proved that you don ' t need a major record label to go triple platinum . This dramatic influx of new talent is just one reason why the record industry had one of its most profitable years ever -- and why its most successful companies are the ones with A &amp; R staffs best equipped to spot gifted young artists . In the early ' 90s , the rush was_on to sign established free-agent superstars . But why pay a premium if an unknown artist can rocket from nowhere to No . 1 ? Seeing how quickly Nirvana and Pearl Jam emerged as mega-platinum pop icons , high-rolling record labels engaged in an unprecedented series of bidding wars for new talent , paying upward of $ 1 million to sign young rock contenders . There ' s plenty of money to go_around , thanks to the increasing popularity of the CD format , which provides record labels with a considerably higher profit_margin on each purchase . With the industry adding a dollar to its superstar CD prices , the result is a huge boom in revenues , with domestic sales approaching the $ 11-billion mark by year ' s end , up nearly 10 % from last year . For a more complete picture of the year ' s ups and downs , Pop Eye offers its annual Record Company Scorecard , which analyzes the 1994 performance of the industry ' s major companies -- and picks each company ' s artists to watch in 1995 . The evaluations are based on SoundScan sales estimates and interviews with key industry figures , who evaluated companies on both image and performance . BMG Arista : Forget about that $ 70 million-plus NBA contract Anfernee Hardaway signed this year . If you want to see a b-i-i-i-g contract , wait till you see what Clive Davis will get_to stay_at Arista , which is as hot as any company in the business . Most of Davis ' acts are critical featherweights , but they ' re heavyweights on the charts , where both Ace of Base and Toni Braxton enjoyed huge records , while holdover albums from Alan Jackson and Whitney Houston remained top sellers . Other big releases included Crash Test Dummies and Kenny G ' s Christmas album , which hit No . 1 and is still going strong . Coming attractions : a new label with Offspring manager Jim Guerinot , a Houston hits package and new albums from Annie Lennox and Taylor Dayne . RCA : At this label , &quot; Dumb and Dumber &quot; isn ' t just the name of a new soundtrack album . It ' s bad enough when a label ' s only success is a soundtrack ( &quot; Reality Bites &quot; ) , but what really hurts is that RCA passed_on a chance to sign &quot; Reality &quot; songstress Lisa Loeb , putting the label on the signing-war sidelines when Loeb ' s single &quot; Stay ( I Missed You ) &quot; became a huge hit . After signing ZZ Top to a $ 30-million deal , the label ' s first ' Top album fizzled . Is it any wonder that months after sending Joe Galante back to Nashville the label can ' t find anyone to take its top job ? 1995 picks : the Dave Matthews Band and rappers Tha Alkaholiks . MCA Geffen : For any other label , it would ' ve been a disastrous year : Kurt Cobain commits suicide , Aerosmith and Don Henley defect to rival labels and Guns N ' Roses , beset by inner turmoil , seems to have lost its sure-thing status . But Geffen has always had a knack for reinventing itself . President Ed Rosenblatt brought_in a new crop of baby A &amp; R execs who won more bidding wars than any other label , signing such promising acts_as Veruca Salt , Elastica and Jawbreaker . With Counting Crows ending the year with SoundScan ' s biggest-selling rock album and Hole coming_on strong , the label ' s future looks bright . Trade of the Year : Don Henley ( last solo album : 1989 ) for the Eagles ' &quot; Hell Freezes Over , &quot; which debuted at No . 1 . Coming attractions : Lisa Loeb , Elastica and Roots . MCA : No one moves country_music like MCA , where Nashville darlings like Reba McEntire and Vince Gill enjoyed continued success this year , with the emergence of the Mavericks making_up for a disappointing outing from Lyle Lovett . Sales were slower on the black music side , with only Uptown ' s Mary J . Blige now emerging as a platinum contender . Despite some promising sales by Live , MCA is not considered a factor_in the rock arena : The label ' s reissued Jimi Hendrix albums sold more_than 1 million copies ( though a pending legal battle over ownership looms ) and it had success with its &quot; Rhythm Country &amp; Blues &quot; project , but career building is still a major MCA weakness . ' 95 projects include alternative bands the Nixons and Dimestore Hoods . PolyGram A &amp; M : It was a good year here , thanks to patient artist development , which paid big dividends for Sheryl Crow and the Gin Blossoms as well as for Soundgarden , who had one of the year ' s top-selling CDs . On the black music front , A &amp; M ' s Perspective label has been a bust , but Barry White , of all people , surfaced as a chart contender at year ' s end . The only nagging question : Can A &amp; M keep its focus while releasing 60-plus albums next year ( up from 35 this year ) ? Priorities for ' 95 include a new Aaron Neville release as well as albums from alternative acts Monster Magnet and Dishwalla . Island : With Chris Blackwell actively involved with the label again , Island had a solid year , enjoying a big breakthrough with Melissa Etheridge while continuing its pop success with Salt-N-Pepa and the Cranberries . Sales were also strong at newly acquired Def Jam , which hit rap paydirt with a huge record from Warren G and is riding high now with Method Man . Coming attractions : Stereo MC ' s , LL Cool J and PJ Harvey . Mercury : It was a dreary year at Mercury , which remains a label in decline , especially in terms of attracting promising rock talent . The label ' s top brass deserves credit for making Vanessa Williams a pop star while recasting Jon Bon Jovi , with some success , as a Rod Stewart-type pop singer . But until it beefs_up a weak A &amp; R staff , it will have to survive on sales from such aging artists as Def Leppard and John Mellencamp . Due in ' 95 : new albums from Def Leppard , INXS and Rusted Root . Motown : The big story -- the only story -- is Boyz II Men ' s &quot; II , &quot; which hasn ' t left the Top 10 since late August , giving the label its biggest hit since . . . the last Boyz II Men album . For ' 95 : Stevie Wonder . Sony Columbia : The industry ' s well-oiled hits machine delivered again this year -- but some signs of rust were showing . The label ' s mega-stars hit their marks , with big sales from Mariah Carey , Pink Floyd and Michael Bolton . But the label didn ' t break a rock_band all year , contenting itself with strong sales from Alice in Chains and hip-hop newcomer Da Brat , who made_up for rap rookie Nas ' sluggish debut . To remedy matters , Columbia is launching a West Coast label with industry vets Jeff Ayeroff and Jordan Harris , who will absorb the alternative-oriented Chaos label . Priorities in ' 95 include singer Jeff Buckley and hip-hopstress Dionne Farris , plus new albums from Soul Asylum and Bruce Springsteen . Epic : In an industry full of self-promoters , it ' s nice to see Epic ' s self-effacing chairman Dave Glew enjoying a triumphant year . You couldn ' t ask_for a better balanced label , with a monster rock_band in Pearl Jam , mainstream pop from Celine Dion , Luther Vandross and Babyface , alternative pop from the Indigo Girls and gangsta-rap from MC Eiht . Top that off with a big year from Epic Soundtrax , which hit_home runs with &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; and &quot; Philadelphia. &quot; Even with a weak outing from the Spin_Doctors , Epic ' s A &amp; R signing coups portend a healthy future . ' 95 priorities include Brit faves Oasis , songstress Des ' ree and Rage Against the Machine . Thorn-EMI Capitol : The Tower raked_in money through shrewd marketing of its deep catalogue , which provided re-packaged Beatles albums ( and a &quot; Live at the BBC &quot; collection ) and a Frank Sinatra duets sequel . Label mainstay Bonnie Raitt had solid sales , as did the Beastie Boys , whose Grand Royal label brought_in newcomers Luscious Jackson . But Gary Gersh ' s fabled A &amp; R skills have produced few results , with Capitol losing to Geffen and Interscope in the year ' s big new-talent bidding wars . Insiders say that Gersh might nab more new talent if he had more autonomy from EMI Group chief finance officer Terry Santisi . Key ' 95 projects include R &amp; B songstress Rachelle Ferrell and rockers Triple Fast Action . EMI Record Group : Out with the old president ( Daniel Glass ) in with the new ( Davitt Sigerson ) . Few are betting it will make any difference at a label with such a spotty track record . The strength of EMI Records Group chairman Charles Koppelman ( whose domain also includes Liberty and Capitol , where he was instrumental in both the &quot; BBC &quot; package and the Sinatra duets ) is promoting records , not building careers . The image of EMI , which includes his old SBK label , is still one of a label that runs_up huge marketing bills and concocts controversial stunts ( the latest a Garth Brooks-McDonald ' s tie-in ) while once-promising artists like Arrested Development and Sinead O ' Connor fall_off the radar screen . Key in ' 95 : R &amp; B singer-producer D ' Angelo and super-model Milla . Virgin : The Rolling Stones did whatever it took ( including a beer ad ) to sell records , joining Smashing Pumpkins , Janet Jackson and Enigma as the label ' s big success stories . The label also joined the gangsta-rap world with Scarface , which arrived via Rap-A-Lot Records . Virgin ' s new-band signings were hampered , however , by turmoil between label president Phil Quartararo and executive_vice_president Nancy Berry ( wife of Virgin CEO Ken Berry ) , prompting a her-or-me ultimatum before Quartararo won a vote_of_confidence . Coming attractions : indie faves Royal Trux , L.A. cow-punks Geraldine Fibbers and hip-hop soulsters Massive Attack . Time Warner American : A disaster . With a bomb from Sir Mix-a-Lot and a woeful start for Black Crowes ' much-touted &quot; Amorica , &quot; the label didn ' t have any of the year ' s Top 200 albums . Memo to label chief Rick Rubin : Stop moonlighting as a record producer and focus_on your own company . ' 95 priorities include Pete Droge , Danzig and the Jayhawks . Atlantic : It was a good year for the label ' s mainstream stars , thanks to huge sales from Stone Temple Pilots , All-4-One and John Michael Montgomery , plus strong showings from Tori Amos and Collective Soul . The label had less luck with its crop of critic darlings ( Liz Phair , Juliana Hatfield and the Lemonheads ) , who couldn ' t match their modest past sales . Meanwhile the much-heralded Page-Plant reunion album is fading fast , hindered by a steep $ 19.98 list_price . Outgoing label chief Danny Goldberg gave the label an image infusion ; now it ' s up_to new president Val Azzoli to provide some substance . ' 95 projects include Hootie &amp; the Blowfish , Brandy and Bettie Serveert . Elektra / East West : The label ' s artist-oriented image took a beating this year , first with the forced exit of chairman Bob Krasnow , then with a nasty tussle between his corporate chiefs and Metallica , the label ' s top act . Chairman Sylvia Rhone inherits the label ' s rich artist roster , which delivered a big pop album from Anita Baker and had a strong showing with its 10 # 000 Maniacs &quot; Unplugged &quot; album . Unfortunately , the label ' s costly Motley Crue re-signing has been a bust while Keith Sweat and Pantera couldn ' t equal previous sales highs . Good news : Artist-oriented exec Seymour Stein arrives as president . ' 95 projects include Natalie Merchant , the Cure and Better Than Ezra . Giant : Just why Warner Music is considering renewing its deal with Giant is a mystery to some who ' ve perused this label ' s current artist roster ( though a Don Henley-Eagles signing might give the label added commercial clout ) . Outside of speciality projects like the Eagles tribute album &quot; Common Threads , &quot; Giant has little besides Big Head Todd &amp; the Monsters ( who had a weak second album ) and country crooner Clay Walker . On deck : Green Apple Quick Step and Christopher Williams . Interscope : You must be doing something right if you ' re about to sell your company for a whopping $ 300-million-plus . Critics say the ' Scope wildly overpays for new bands , but while other new labels have struggled , Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field ' s company has flourished , enjoying huge sales from Death Row bad boys Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre ( who also produced the soundtrack hits &quot; Above the Rim &quot; and &quot; Murder Was the Case &quot; ) . Nine Inch Nails ' Trent Reznor also emerged as the year ' s alternative-rock icon . On the down side , Tom Jones has been an expensive flop so far , and 4 Non Blondes has broken_up . Coming attractions : R &amp; B singer Xavier , Brit-rockers Bush and rap newcomer Jewell . Warner Bros : It ' s hard to imagine anyone ousting the top brass of a more successful company . With hits flying from all directions , chairman Mo Ostin and president Lenny Waronker exit in_style , dominating the charts with hits from both established artists like R.E.M. , Eric Clapton and Tom Petty as well as newcomers Green Day and Candlebox , the latter the product of a savvy label deal with Madonna , who managed decent sales of_her_own . Warners even made progress in black pop , with big records from Tevin Campbell and Seal , while breaking country artist David Ball . The biggest downer : career-threatening nuttiness from not-so-fresh Prince . On deck : Red Hot Chili_Peppers , Belly and the Flaming Lips . Best of the Rest Offspring ' s punk energy put Epitaph Records on the map , outselling every new major-label alternative artist except Green Day . . . . Tim McGraw had the biggest country record of the year on Curb Records , which moves to the Atlantic Group next year . . . . R . Kelly had a big year for Jive Records , a joint_venture with BMG . . . . New Age instrumentalist Yanni was a huge seller for Private Music . . . . Ice_Cube had another strong year at Priority . . . . Coolio was a big hit for Tommy Boy . . . . And rappers Bone Thugs-N-Harmony had the biggest sales at Ruthless Records . Chuck Philips and Steve Hochman contributed to this article .</TEXT>
