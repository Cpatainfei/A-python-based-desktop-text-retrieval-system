   <TEXT> &quot; Lost in the Taiga &quot; is one of the most remarkable stories to emerge from the smoke and rubble of the former Soviet_Union , a shining saga of survival in the Siberian wilderness that also serves as a kind of parable about the function of faith and tradition in the history and destiny of Russia . The story begins in 1978 , when a party of Soviet geologists was surveying a remote stretch of wilderness by helicopter in search of iron_ore deposits . To their astonishment , they observed a rough-hewn cabin and a cultivated garden in an otherwise pristine and wholly inaccessible portion of the vast coniferous forest known as the &quot; taiga. &quot; What the geologists had discovered -- and what Soviet journalist Vasily Peskov went_on to investigate in intimate detail -- was the refuge of a family of &quot; Old Believers &quot; who fled from the worst excesses of Stalinism in the 1930s and who managed to preserve themselves for nearly a half-century on the strength of their survival skills and their abundant faith . &quot; Their existence , squalid in the extreme , &quot; observes Peskov , &quot; consisted_of prayers , reading prayer_books , and a genuine struggle for existence in nearly primeval conditions. &quot; When a party of curious but cautious geologists , bearing both gifts and arms , finally reached the mysterious encampment , they found a scene &quot; like something halfway between Peter the Great and the Stone Age. &quot; The Lykov family dressed in rough burlap , they lived_on pine_nuts and potatoes , they drank out of birch-bark vessels -- and suddenly they were face to face with the 20th Century . &quot; Greetings , grandfather ! &quot; one geologist hailed the long-bearded patriarch of the family , Karp Lykov . &quot; We ' ve come_to visit. &quot; &quot; This is for our sins , our sins ! &quot; cried one of the women who huddled in fear in a dark corner of the cabin . As it turned_out , the family belonged_to a sect that had broken_away from the Russian Orthodox Church in the days of Peter the Great . Indeed , the long-dead czar and his churchmen &quot; were for Karp Osipovich implacable , intimate , and personal foes. &quot; And it was the religious fervor of the Lykov family that sustained them over the long years of self-imposed exile . &quot; Often conversation was broken_off by their impulse to go pray that very second , &quot; recalls Peskov . &quot; The prayer stopped as abruptly as it had begun , and the conversation took_up where it left off. &quot; Peskov visited ( and wrote_about ) the Lykovs over more_than a decade , and he watched as the family slowly acquainted itself with the history and technology of the world they had shunned . They rejoiced at gifts of a piece of canvas , a kitten , a spinning_wheel , but they refused a box of matches : &quot; Sinful fire , &quot; says Karp Lykov , who refused to give_up the flint and tinder that he used to strike a flame . &quot; Our trick is better. &quot; According to Peskov , the Lykovs came_to welcome the intrusion of the outside world , and he refuses to depict their experience as a casting_out from Eden . &quot; We were starting to wear_out , &quot; says Agafia , Karp Lykov ' s daughter . &quot; We were eating without salt. &quot; But there ' s a faint trace of Adam and Eve in his tale , and Peskov observes that &quot; an avid curiosity awoke in ( the family ) , a desire to learn and understand. &quot; The story of the Lykov family is so remarkable , so moving and so well-told that I wondered at first if they were not a kind of Siberian version of the Tasaday tribe of the Philippine rain_forest : Was &quot; Lost in the Taiga &quot; a good yarn made even better by some colorful embellishments ? Still , we have no reason to believe that Peskov is not telling us exactly what he saw . Today , the last survivor of the Lykov family is Agafia , a 50-year-old woman who lives utterly alone in the taiga and refuses to seek the company of other human_beings . &quot; I shall live as we have always lived , &quot; vows Agafia , and her words resonate with larger meanings as we contemplate not only her own curious fate but the destiny of Russia itself .</TEXT>
