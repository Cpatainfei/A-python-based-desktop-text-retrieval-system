   <HEADLINE> ANOTHER PR NIGHTMARE FOR O.C. ' S TOURIST TRADE ; TRAVEL : OFFICIALS WILL TRY TO REASSURE JAPANESE IN WAKE OF SLAYINGS . STRATEGY MAY INVOLVE A DISTANCING FROM L.A.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Having endured the effects of riots and earthquakes , Orange County tourist officials say they are frustrated by the battering their $ 4.8-billion industry has taken following problems in Los Angeles County . Now , with the latest setback -- the vicious slayings of two Japanese students in the Los Angeles seaside community of San Pedro -- local tourism executives say they need to take immediate steps to reassure Japanese tourists as well as forge a long-term , countywide tourism strategy -- possibly one that is more independent of Los Angeles . &quot; We have to emphasize how safe Orange County is , and we have the figures to back it up , &quot; said Diane Baker , president of the Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau . Though San Pedro is a dozen miles away from the Orange County border , the killing has tarred all_of Southern California , experts say . &quot; The farther you get from anyplace , the more the geography gets clouded , &quot; said Bruce Baltin , who heads hotel services for PKF Consulting in Los Angeles . The county could try to sever the connection with Los Angeles in tourists ' minds , he said , but &quot; it just takes lots of marketing dollars. &quot; These issues are sure to be at the forefront at an upcoming countywide tourism summit being organized by Supervisors Gaddi H . Vasquez and William G . Steiner . &quot; In Orange County , we have created a safer atmosphere for tourists as well as business , and we need to find an effective way to carry that message , &quot; Vasquez said . While long-term strategy is important , local business owners say the immediate concern is the Japanese market . With the world recoiling at the news of the killings , they fear that tourism may take yet another drop . Yet , Orange County may be_better prepared this time , since it has been gradually trying to move_out of its larger neighbor ' s shadow -- particularly with the Japanese . Since the Los Angeles riots in 1992 , more Japanese tourists have been asking to stay nights in Orange County where they perceive they are safer , according to Shigeto ( Chuck ) Mayumi , who directs package tour planning for Japan Travel Bureau International in Los Angeles , a large agency that specializes in vacation packages for traveling Japanese . &quot; More are going directly to Anaheim , &quot; he said . And with the rising popularity of team sports like professional hockey in Japan , more Japanese are becoming aware of Anaheim ' s distinct identity because of the Mighty Ducks . Moreover , foreigners are increasingly taking West Coast package tours that circumvent the usual port_of_entry , Los Angeles International Airport . The Anaheim Hilton and Towers , for instance , is involved in marketing packages to Asians that make San Francisco their gateway to the United States . From there , they fly to Las Vegas and Orange County through John Wayne Airport . Some may never set foot in Los Angeles . To underscore the program , the hotel is hosting 80 top Japanese travel_agents next month , and chances are they will see very little of Orange County ' s northern neighbors . &quot; It is a way of combatting all_the media problems we are having in Southern California , &quot; said Andrew Fransen , the Hilton ' s Japanese-speaking director of leisure sales . While they do not show_up in the greatest numbers of any nationality -- that distinction usually goes_to the Canadians -- Japanese visitors are highly prized because they are a major market and tend to spend heavily . The average Japanese tourist stays seven to 10 days in the United States and shells_out $ 3 # 000 to $ 4 # 000 , according to Elaine Cali , spokeswoman for the Anaheim Area Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau . About 80 % of the 800 # 000 Japanese who visit California stop off at Disneyland . &quot; That doesn ' t mean they all stay in Orange County , but a good portion of them spend at least a night here , &quot; Cali said . Local hotels routinely offer native meals , hosts and other enticements to attract Japanese visitors . Some have even put_together wedding packages for Japanese couples who elope to escape their country ' s ritualistic -- and expensive -- marriage process . So the last thing that local tourism executives want is the kind of media attention in the Japanese media that has befallen Los Angeles since the weekend killings . The deaths of Go Matsuura and Takuma Ito , both 19 , outside a San Pedro supermarket have struck deeply in Japan , where violence is rare and guns are strictly controlled . Though Orange County had its own disaster last year -- the brush_fires in Laguna Beach that razed hundreds of homes -- it never was viewed_as a personal safety threat to the Japanese . John Dravinski , general_manager of the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point , said that the media tidal_wave rolling from San Pedro to Japan is insurmountable . He said that individual hotels need get_hold_of their customers and reassure them that all is_well . The Anaheim Area Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau , which has a $ 4.5-million annual advertising budget , has yet to launch the kind of a fax counterattacks to travel_agents in the wake of the San Pedro killings that usually follow earthquakes . Finding the right mix of local and regional appeal is tricky , Cali said . &quot; It ' s a real thin tightrope you walk on those issues . We are close to L.A. ( but ) you don ' t want to be interpreted as taking_advantage of someone else ' s disadvantages. &quot; Times staff writer Jeffrey L . Rabin in Los Angeles contributed to this report .</TEXT>
