   <TEXT> MOUNT VERNON : The Civil War Years : The Presence of a Lady by Dorothy Troth Muir ( The Mount Vernon Ladies ' Assn. , Mount Vernon , Va . 22121 : $ 10.95 ; 136 pp. , paperback original ) . In 1860 , the women of the United States , represented by the Mount Vernon Ladies ' Assn. , purchased George_Washington ' s estate to preserve for future generations . When the Civil War broke_out , the members of the association agreed that &quot; the presence of a lady &quot; was the best way to ensure the safety of the historic site . Sarah Tracy , secretary to the regent of the association , spent the war there with a chaperon , a handyman and a_few servants . Although several major battles ( 1st Manassas , Antietam Creek , Bull_Run ) were fought near Mount Vernon , both sides respected its absolute neutrality . Compiled from letters and diaries , this charming chronicle presents a vivid account of one woman ' s courage , and a little-known chapter in American history .</TEXT>
