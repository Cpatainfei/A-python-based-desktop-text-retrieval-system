   <HEADLINE> NIXON LIBRARY WILL INHERIT BULK OF ESTATE ; LAW : FORMER PRESIDENT LEFT CASH GIFTS , PERSONAL ITEMS TO DAUGHTERS AND GRANDCHILDREN . LEGAL ACTION OVER WATERGATE TAPES , OTHER DOCUMENTS COULD BRING WINDFALL TO YORBA LINDA INSTITUTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace will inherit the bulk of the former President ' s estate , but a legal_action over the infamous Watergate tapes and other documents could also mean a windfall worth millions . A federal judge in 1992 ordered the federal_government to compensate Nixon for documents and tapes seized during the Watergate scandal , which could be worth a fortune as collectors ' items . But the value of those papers and tapes has yet to be determined , and the beneficiary of that money was not specified in the will . The nation ' s 37th President left cash gifts to his four grandchildren and bequeathed his diaries and other personal items to his daughters , Julie Nixon Eisenhower and Patricia Nixon Cox , according to a will filed May 11 in Bergen County , N.J. , where Nixon lived the past decade to be closer to his grandchildren . Nixon died April 22 at age 81 . He signed his will on Feb . 24 , eight months after the death of his wife , Pat . The will does not estimate the worth of the estate left by the former President and First_Lady , but it is believed to be in the millions . The inheritance will help the $ 21-million Nixon library , a key tourist attraction in the area that has struggled financially since its opening in July , 1990 . According to the will , the library received $ 2.65 million in cash gifts from the former President over the past two years . &quot; He took_care of his legacy , &quot; Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley said Tuesday . &quot; Yorba Linda appreciates it . It could be a boon to the city. &quot; The potential windfall in the lawsuit involves a federal appellate_court ruling in November , 1992 , that the government may keep documents and tapes seized during the Watergate investigations , but must pay Nixon for the historically valuable documents . A federal judge must determine the just compensation . Any money received from his lawsuit seeking the tapes would become a &quot; charitable gift , &quot; according to the will , which does not specify to whom . In the will , Nixon directs his executors to continue any pending lawsuit regarding ownership of his property &quot; for as long as they , in their discretion , deem it appropriate to do so , knowing my wishes in this matter. &quot; Had Nixon ' s daughters not survived him , Nixon instructed that the diaries and other items be destroyed . Nixon defined the items as &quot; any notes , tapes , transcribed notes , folders , binders , or books that are owned by me or to which I may be entitled under a judgment of law . . . that may contain my daily , weekly or monthly activities , thoughts or plans. &quot; If Nixon ' s daughters decline to accept the items , they are to be turned_over to the library , according to the will . Nixon said his daughters have first claim to his personal_property , but cannot take more_than 3 % of the total value , although the will bequeaths the balance of the estate to his daughters . The will does not specify who will receive royalties from Nixon ' s best-selling books . The former President gave $ 50 # 000 to each of his four grandchildren . Three of the grandchildren also get amounts ranging from $ 10 # 000 to $ 70 # 000 to &quot; equalize &quot; past gifts . Library director John H . Taylor and New York attorney William E . Griffin were named co-executors of the will . The will declares that the balance of a $ 1.2-million pledge Nixon made to his library last year must be paid first before the rest of the estate is paid_out . The nation ' s only presidential library to operate entirely without public funds , the institution lost $ 1.5 million during 1991 and part of 1992 . Library officials blamed the loss on early expenditures on promotions and special events and vowed to cut expenses . The library includes the wood farmhouse Nixon ' s father built from a kit . Library officials believe attendance will soar since the President was buried alongside his wife . Library officials and attorneys did not return phone_calls .</TEXT>
