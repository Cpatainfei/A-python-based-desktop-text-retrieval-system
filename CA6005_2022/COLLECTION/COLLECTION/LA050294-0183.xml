   <HEADLINE> JURY SELECTION TO BEGIN IN LAWSUIT OVER 1989 EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL ; COURTS : ABOUT 14 # 000 PLAINTIFFS SEEK PUNITIVE , COMPENSATORY DAMAGES FROM THE HUGE FIRM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After five years , several failed fish harvests , a huge wildlife death toll and discovery of what government scientists say are chronic and genetic injuries to marine life , the case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill is going_to trial . Jury selection is scheduled to start today in U.S. District Court in the case of about 14 # 000 commercial fishermen , Alaska natives , property_owners and others suing Exxon Corp . over the 1989 spill . The trial will consider Exxon ' s responsibility for paying compensation and punitive damages for the 11-million-gallon disaster , one of the most deadly to wildlife . The trial is expected to last four months . That this case against a huge multinational corporation has even made_it to a courtroom is remarkable , said Brian O ' Neill , chief plaintiff trial_attorney . &quot; The question here is whether one of the biggest institutions in the world , including many countries , will be held accountable for its actions , &quot; O ' Neill said . &quot; These guys never go_to trial . These guys are so big that they usually grind plaintiffs into the ground . And they certainly tried that here. &quot; Exxon has portrayed itself as a good corporate citizen that has already accepted responsibility for the accident . It spent more_than $ 2 billion for the cleanup and promised $ 1.03 billion over 10 years in natural_resource compensatory damages under a 1991 settlement with the U.S. and Alaska governments . On June 6 , a smaller case filed by a coalition of municipalities and Alaska native corporations will be tried concurrently in state Superior_Court . That trial , to consider only compensatory claims , is expected to last five weeks , plaintiff liaison attorney Dave Oesting said . Both trials are expected to concentrate_on a duel of scientists with opposing pictures of the affected ecosystem . &quot; The jury will hear two completely different stories . Establishing a strictly scientific link between the spill and the damages is variable , &quot; said Bob Spies , chief scientist for the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council , the panel that manages the governments ' spill settlement . Of special concern are Prince William Sound fisheries . Pink salmon returns there collapsed in 1992 and 1993 , and a poor return is forecast for this summer . Sparse and diseased herring runs ruined spring harvests last year and this year . Angry fishermen last summer staged a three-day blockade of the trans-Alaska pipeline ' s terminal in Valdez . The protest was ended through negotiations by Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt . Exxon , pointing to a record salmon run in 1990 and a large 1991 run , has said the sound ' s fishery troubles are unrelated to the spill . &quot; It just doesn ' t seem fair that Exxon should be held accountable for these current hardships when they ' re not connected to the spill and are more likely resulting from any number of factors that aren ' t related to the spill in any way , &quot; company spokesman Dennis Stanczuk said . Exxon has maintained that the spill-struck areas have fully healed . &quot; Prince William Sound has seen a remarkable recovery , &quot; Exxon Chairman Lee Raymond told reporters at the company ' s annual meeting last week . Plaintiff attorneys are seeking about $ 3 billion in compensatory damages . A plaintiff-hired expert said that punitive damages -- which may depend_on proof that recklessness contributed to the Exxon Valdez grounding -- must be at least $ 6 billion to $ 10 billion to adequately punish Exxon . U.S. District Court Judge Russel Holland , who will preside over the trial , has disqualified that expert ' s testimony . Exxon has compiled other pretrial victories limiting the number of plaintiffs and their claims . Holland dismissed the claims of tourism business operators and about 1 # 000 cannery workers and fish wholesalers who said the spill ' s ripple effects hurt them economically . He dismissed the claims of sport fishermen , environmentalists and others seeking compensation for loss of enjoyment in the spill-polluted marine areas . He also dismissed claims filed by fishermen for lost fishing-permit values , which have been halved since the spill , and those filed by some 4 # 000 Alaska natives for non-economic losses to their traditional &quot; subsistence &quot; lifestyle , which is based on gathering fish and wildlife from the sea .</TEXT>
