   <TEXT> An extraordinary tribute to film is now playing . Not in your local theater , but at a gallery near you . The Beverly Hills-based Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences has brought_together film costumes of yesterday and today , in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the Costume_Designers Guild . The exhibit , &quot; Building Character : Costume Design for the Cinema , &quot; presents a colorful account of more_than six decades of Hollywood . Opening Friday in the academy ' s fourth-floor gallery , the show features works by nearly 100 designers and includes more_than 150 pieces such_as jewelry , costumes , hats , shoes , design sketches and set photographs . &quot; These treasures are being lost and stolen , &quot; said Eloise Jenssen , an Academy Award-winning designer and co-chairwoman of the exhibit . &quot; We tried to show everyone living and dead who ' s important in the motion_picture business. &quot; Exhibition curator Ellen Harrington said the show is a rare exhibition combining film costumes and related accessories such_as the gold and silver cigar case carried by Clark Gable in &quot; Gone With the Wind &quot; and jewelry worn by Rita Hayworth in &quot; Salome. &quot; To arrange such an elaborate exhibit , Harrington , Jenssen and co-chair Mina Mittleman have spent almost a year acquiring items and planning . The pieces came from a variety of sources , including the academy ' s Margaret Herrick Library , the Costume_Designers Guild and many designers and sketch artists . The exhibit is organized by styles -- from Victorian England to futuristic-wear to the Wild_West and more -- rather than chronologically . The costumes include Valentino ' s &quot; suit of light &quot; from &quot; Blood and Sand , &quot; Vanessa Redgrave ' s crown and coronation gown from &quot; Camelot , &quot; and the white suit worn by Gary Oldman in &quot; Bram Stroker ' s Dracula. &quot; &quot; It ' s much more interesting that we can take a sketch from the 1930s or 1940s and place it near a similar costume made today , &quot; Harrington said . &quot; Hollywood hasn ' t always been as careful as it should have in keeping its history , &quot; said Harrington . &quot; No one thought there was a huge value for these things . What we are trying to do is to preserve this artwork. &quot; The Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences is at 8949 Wilshire Blvd. , Beverly Hills . Gallery hours are from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday , and from noon to 6 p.m. on weekends . The free exhibit will be shown through June 19 . Information : ( 310 ) 278-5673 . CHRISTINA V .
