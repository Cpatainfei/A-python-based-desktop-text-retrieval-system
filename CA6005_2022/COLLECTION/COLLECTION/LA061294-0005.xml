   <TEXT> &quot; What this year ' s Tony Awards ceremony needs , &quot; says Broadway producer Richard Jay-Alexander , &quot; is the theater ' s equivalent of Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan . A real fight-out fraught with tension that ' ll get people to tune in. &quot; There ' s only one category that might qualify among the 20 that will yield winners tonight on the 48th annual CBS telecast , and that is the race for one of the two top Tonys -- best musical . The traditional Broadway Establishment , represented by the Shubert Organization and the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical &quot; Passion , &quot; is facing_off against the new 800-pound kid on the block -- &quot; Beauty and the Beast , &quot; produced by Disney , whose well-financed and maverick ways have sent tremors through the small , cliquish industry . &quot; Passion &quot; leads with 10 nominations , but &quot; Beauty , &quot; the most expensive musical ever mounted on Broadway , has nine . What ' s at stake is not only prestige and a marketing boost . The winner will also signal where the Establishment power stands_in an industry increasingly anxious about its commercial future ( despite the fact that ticket sales are up ) . Of course , the Tony Awards are also about art and quality on Broadway , and that certainly will play a role in selecting the winners . But , according to most insiders , the politics are more pronounced than usual this year , partly because neither musical has managed to muster much enthusiasm among the 678 Tony voters -- producers , the media and representatives of theatrical unions and organizations . It ' s also because the Broadway theater itself appears to be in more of a state of flux than usual . &quot; We ' re going through a rather convulsive period_of_time , especially in the musical_theater , &quot; says James Freydberg , a New York producer ( &quot; Fool Moon &quot; ) who recently took a lease on the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles . The paucity on Broadway of strong , influential activist voices like the late Joseph Papp ' s has taken its toll . &quot; Nobody knows what to do , &quot; Freydberg added , &quot; so they ' re doing revivals . that ' s not producing , that ' s presenting . Things seem to be in an odd holding pattern. &quot; Indeed , the best musical revival category has four strong contenders -- &quot; Carousel , &quot; &quot; She Loves Me , &quot; &quot; Grease &quot; and &quot; Damn Yankees. &quot; But the Tony nominating committee practically had to be whipped and hogtied to come_up with four best musical nominees . A minor scandal erupted on the day the nominations were announced because the committee balked at adding the two other shows that were eventually nominated -- &quot; Cyrano , &quot; a Dutch import based on the Edmond Rostand classic , and &quot; A Grand Night for Singing , &quot; a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical revue -- both of which have closed . &quot; I ' d have understood if they ' d eliminated that category altogether , &quot; said producer Margo Lion ( &quot; Jelly ' s Last Jam &quot; ) . &quot; ' Beauty and the Beast ' really is a world apart . It doesn ' t have anything to do with what the rest of us are doing . And ' Passion ' ? It ' s new and daring , but its appeal is not very broad . So what you have is one show of limited artistic quality and wide commercial appeal pitted against a show of ambitious artistry and limited accessibility. &quot; &quot; I like both musicals , &quot; said Robert Straus , a Broadway general_manager . &quot; The problem is that there are only two productions to show for a whole season . I ' d like more choice. &quot; By coincidence , &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; and &quot; Passion &quot; share themes . Both inspired by movies , the musicals , to some extent , are about physical and spiritual beauty . Based on Disney ' s enormously popular animated feature , &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; is an extravagant $ 12-million retelling of the 18th-Century French fairy tale about an ugly beast in an enchanted castle who tries to win the heart of a bookish young_girl . When the show opened last March at the Palace , many reviewers likened it to a Disney theme-park event and spent about as much space on the all-stops-out merchandising in the lobby as on the all-stops-out production . Damp notices , however , had little effect at the box_office and the show is this season ' s hottest ticket . &quot; Passion &quot; is the musical adaptation of a 19th-Century Italian novel of dark and obsessive love . The fatal attraction here is between a plain , consumptive woman and a handsome soldier . Unlike the cuddly pair at the heart of the Disney spectacular , Fosca and Giorgio are an intense but doom-ridden duo , playing_out their disturbing and dissonant affair in a severe and cerebral $ 4.5-million production at the Plymouth . Following a troubled preview period in New York , the show opened_to mixed but respectful notices . Buoyed by the magical name of Stephen Sondheim , the adventurous show has been drawing moderately well , but most people agree that it must win the Tony to have a viable run , because of its difficult subject_matter . * If &quot; Passion &quot; prevails , there is speculation that &quot; Disney-bashing , &quot; as it has been characterized in the press , will have had something to do with it . Much has been written_about the less-than-warm welcome extended by the theater Establishment to the rich and powerful entertainment conglomerate since its arrival on Broadway . Eyebrows were immediately raised when Disney chose a director , choreographer and set designer whose experience stemmed largely from creating theme-park productions . Giving_notice that they intended to do things their own way , including putting_up all_the money themselves , Disney ' s executives aroused the envy and skepticism of many of Broadway ' s elite , who have to scramble , sometimes for years , to raise financing for a show . In an industry with so few major players , there was concern that a company with such deep pockets might shift the balance . &quot; We haven ' t been entirely surprised by the so-called ' bashing , ' &quot; said Robert McTyre , who produced &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; for Disney . &quot; But we ' re getting standing ovations every night and selling_out , so we did something right . We have a particular point_of_view and appeal and we believe there ' s room for that on Broadway and for ' Passion ' as well. &quot; The Broadway community ' s mixed feelings have been compounded by the Disney Co. ' s commitment to renovate 42nd Street ' s New Amsterdam Theatre , thus spearheading the long-delayed redevelopment of the tawdry Times Square area . When news of Disney ' s deal with the city , which included tax abatements and a low-interest $ 21-million loan , first surfaced , longstanding Broadway theater owners protested they were entitled to some of the same favorable tax_breaks . Still many producers have expressed the hope that Disney ' s muscle will help to bring_down steep union costs that are making musicals prohibitively expensive to mount . &quot; I ' m delighted that Disney ' s on Broadway , &quot; said producer John Hart of Kardana Productions , which co-produced &quot; Guys and Dolls &quot; and &quot; Tommy. &quot; &quot; I think ' Beauty and the Beast ' misses on the emotions , but its sense of spectacle will bring a lot of new and younger people into the theater . Quite frankly , I worry about them turning Times Square into a theme park . I don ' t want to come_to work in a monorail and get my morning cup of coffee from Minnie Mouse. &quot; A more commonly stated fear is that a company as rich as Disney will repeatedly come_up with the money to create a product that will do little to advance -- and may even be detrimental -- to the art_form of theater itself . * Of course , even the Broadway pros have not exactly been successful with musicals this season . Harold Prince and Tommy Tune -- the two directors most successful in combining artistry with commerce in the proportions that Tony voters love -- are notably absent from among the nominees . Tune had a disastrous flop with &quot; The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public &quot; last month and Prince ' s new show is a revival of &quot; Showboat , &quot; a 67-year-old musical that opened in Toronto and won ' t be in New York until the fall . Gordon Davidson , artistic director of Los Angeles ' Mark Taper Forum , which is nominated as co-producer of three of the four best play nominees ( &quot; Twilight , &quot; &quot; Perestroika , &quot; &quot; Kentucky Cycle &quot; ) , suggests that too_much emphasis is being placed on &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; as the litmus test of future Disney involvement . &quot; Money can ' t buy quality , &quot; he says . &quot; But it can ' t hurt . The next venture for Disney will tell us more_than ' Beauty , ' and it may_not be quite so easy to adapt in the same way . They ' re very smart people . I think they ' ve learned a lot and may reach_out to more traditional artists next time. &quot; Disney ' s McTyre agrees that may be the case but thinks the repeated comparisons to theme-park entertainment are &quot; ludicrous. &quot; &quot; We ' re going to do things that are Disney-branded , but we ' re going to look_for original things as well. &quot; Where &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; to a certain extent came_to Broadway as a pre-sold hit , &quot; Passion &quot; took a more perilous route . Unlike most original American musicals , which these days go_through years of development and workshop productions , the latest Sondheim-Lapine collaboration was in previews within six months of its only workshop production at Lincoln Center . &quot; I think it would send a terrific signal if ' Passion ' won , &quot; the Taper ' s Davidson said . &quot; It ' s great whenever works that are of a certain boldness and ambition can be acknowledged . It encourages risk-taking from other quarters. &quot; &quot; As a writer in the theater , I see a growing tendency toward frivolousness , &quot; said writer-director Richard Maltby ( &quot; Miss Saigon &quot; ) . &quot; Steve ' s on the artistic cutting edge. &quot; Yet , for all_the reverence and respect accorded to Sondheim by the Broadway community , there is still a nagging sense among some that a vote for the esoteric &quot; Passion &quot; over &quot; Beauty &quot; sends a misleading signal to the general public . &quot; I know the lyrics of ' Company ' better than the national_anthem , &quot; says John Hart , &quot; but I ' m not comfortable voting for ' Passion. ' Broadway is in danger of becoming like opera -- too expensive , too elite and no longer part of people ' s vocabularies . When I attended ' Passion , ' I was stunned by its failures to connect with an audience. &quot; A Broadway press_agent who wished to remain anonymous put it even more bluntly . &quot; ' Passion ' needs the win to stay alive , &quot; he says , &quot; but it won ' t promote Broadway business in the long_run . If the average tourist goes_to see it because it won the Tony over , say , seeing ' Crazy for You , ' then it ' s likely to scare them off . The effect of it winning will be fascinating , if ironic . After all , the Tony is supposed to not only promote excellence , but also promote Broadway business. &quot; * It is neither Sondheim nor Disney ' s responsibility , of course , to create products that will please the Tony voters . In the end , awards often have little to do with real merit . The recent past is littered with examples of musicals that won the best musical Tony and never recouped their investment while on Broadway ( &quot; Will Rogers Follies &quot; is one ) . Furthermore , Sondheim ' s &quot; Sunday in the Park With George , &quot; which lost to &quot; La Cage aux Folles &quot; in 1984 , appears to be growing in stature as &quot; La Cage &quot; recedes into memory . While many voters express the wish that they could vote on nominees that more confidently combined artistic excellence with commercial appeal , the problems with the Broadway musical will persist long after the envelopes are discarded . &quot; The sadness in the American theater at this moment is that even many of our hits are not new work , &quot; Maltby said . &quot; Even ' Tommy ' is 25 years old . Leave Steve ( Sondheim ) out and there are not many new and talented creators around , and I ' m not sure that Disney ' s arrival on the scene is going_to change that. &quot; &quot; You know what the irony is in all this , &quot; said one voter . &quot; Steve ' s Oscar is for ' Sooner or Later , ' a song from ' Dick Tracy ' that Disney produced , and James Lapine ' s last movie , ' Life With Mikey , ' was also released by one of their companies . We may all end_up working for Disney , sooner or later. &quot;</TEXT>
