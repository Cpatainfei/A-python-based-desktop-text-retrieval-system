   <HEADLINE> YOUR MONEY ; WORKERS ' PAY RISES AT HISTORICALLY LOW RATE ; LABOR : ECONOMISTS SAY THE GOVERNMENT FIGURES ON COMPENSATION SHOW INFLATION REMAINS IN CHECK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Compensation for American workers grew at a historically slow pace in the second quarter of the year , the government said Tuesday . The Labor_Department ' s employment cost index provides the latest evidence that inflation remains in check , economists said . It shows that worker compensation rose at an annual rate of 3.2 % , the same as in the 12 months ended March 30 , which was the smallest increase on record . The report shows there is &quot; no convincing sign &quot; of inflation in the economy , said Robert G . Dederick , chief economist with Northern Trust Co . in Chicago . The index , created in 1982 , measures changes in wages , salaries and employer costs for employee benefits such_as health_insurance , vacations and sick_leave . It is considered one of the best gauges of wage inflation . Wages and salaries , which constitute 72 % of total worker compensation , edged_up 3 % , the Labor_Department said . Benefit costs were up 3.8 % . Inflation &quot; remains contained on the labor level , &quot; said economist Robert Barr of the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; You would expect that if the strong economy was indeed going_to push us into a much higher level of inflation , there would be higher numbers at this point. &quot; A continuing slowdown in the cost of health_insurance , workers ' compensation and state unemployment insurance helped moderate the increase in benefit costs . Health_insurance and workers ' comp costs are the most rapidly rising expenses for businesses . Worker salaries and benefits represent about two-thirds of the cost of a product , and holding_the_line on increases in compensation allows businesses to offer goods at the lowest possible prices . Wages and salaries rose 0.8 % in the second quarter after a 0.7 % increase in the first three months of the year . Benefit costs increased to 1 % , after a 0.9 % gain in the previous quarter . Economists pay more attention to the annual rates because they smooth_out fluctuations seen in the more volatile quarterly figures . * The Labor_Department reported separately that contracts negotiated by unions for their members in the second quarter of this year provided annual wage increases that were smaller than those called_for in the agreements they replaced . Agreements reached during the period had wage increases averaging 2.3 % in the first year and 2.4 % over the life of the contracts . The agreements they replaced had increases averaging 2.9 % in the first year and 3 % over the life of the contracts .</TEXT>
