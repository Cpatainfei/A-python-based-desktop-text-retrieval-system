   <HEADLINE> SALVATION_ARMY ELECTS L.A.-AREA CHIEF TO TOP POST ; AID : PAUL A . RADER , 60 , A REGIONAL COMMANDER , IS THE FIRST AMERICAN TO HEAD THE WORLDWIDE EVANGELISTIC AND SOCIAL_SERVICE ORGANIZATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time in its 129-year history , the Salvation_Army has elected an American as its international leader -- Paul A . Rader , 60 , a regional commander based in the Los Angeles area . The evangelistic church body organized along quasi-military lines is_best known for its social_service and disaster relief efforts . After its 1865 beginnings in London under founder William Booth , the denomination that is_active in 100 nations has had a succession of British , Scandinavian , Australian and Canadian generals . Rader was elected the 15th general in London on Saturday after six days of deliberations by the army ' s High Council . The new general will return to Los Angeles on Friday and move to London , where the army is headquartered , Aug . 28 , said Robert Bearchell , spokesman for the army ' s 13-state Western Territory headquarters in Rancho Palos Verdes , where Rader has been commissioner since 1989 . With 450 # 000 officers , cadets and members , the U.S. branch founded in 1880 is the largest national component of the worldwide organization of 3 million Salvationists , as the denomination ' s adherents call themselves . Why has it taken so_long for an American to be elected ? &quot; that ' s a good question . We ' ve always wondered why , &quot; Bearchell said . Rader came within one vote of being elected general last year , Bearchell said . However , the Canadian who won , Gen . Bramwell H . Tillsley , resigned this spring for health reasons , making another election necessary . Rader is the best-educated general in the army ' s history : His four degrees include a doctorate in missiology from Pasadena ' s Fuller Theological Seminary in 1973 . Born in New York City to prominent Salvation_Army officers , Rader also earned degrees at Asbury College and Southern Baptist Theological Seminary , both in Kentucky . In remarks released Tuesday , Rader said the army ' s High Council sought to choose a leader who is adept in strategic use of its worldwide , yet limited , resources . &quot; Quite frankly , it is what I brought_to the table . ( A strategic approach ) means having a clarified awareness of what our task is , where our resources ought to be invested in_order to accomplish God ' s purpose for the army at this moment in history , &quot; he said . &quot; We live_in a world of crisis . . . . The world is_on fire and bursting with opportunity at the same time. &quot; While serving as western territorial leader , Rader oversaw efforts to alleviate the misery that has come_with California earthquakes and brush_fires and a Hawaiian hurricane , as well as ongoing programs for runaways in Hollywood and alcohol and drug rehabilitation , among other projects . He was credited with expanding Salvation_Army support for 7 # 800 employees and about 50 # 000 volunteers in the region . Rader , who is fluent in Korean , spent 22 years on Salvation_Army assignments in South_Korea , interrupted only by studies at Fuller Seminary . He rose to the second-highest Salvation_Army post in South_Korea before returning to the United States in 1984 and assuming command of several Eastern U.S. posts . Rader and his officer wife , Kay , who will serve as president of the army ' s Women ' s Organizations , have three adult children , all_of whom have remained in South_Korea . Rader ' s term_of_office will be five years , although he could be reelected and serve until age 67 , Bearchell said .</TEXT>
