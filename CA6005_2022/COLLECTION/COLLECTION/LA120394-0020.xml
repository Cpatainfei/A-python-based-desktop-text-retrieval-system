   <HEADLINE> JAPAN OBJECTS TO ATOMIC BOMB STAMPS ; WWII : ONE IN U.S. POSTAL SERIES SAYS ATTACKS HASTENED END OF CONFLICT . IT IS THE SECOND DISPUTE OVER UPCOMING ANNIVERSARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A planned American commemorative stamp , declaring that atomic_bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki &quot; hastened &quot; the end of World_War_II , is an &quot; affront to the feelings of the Japanese people , &quot; Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama declared Friday night . &quot; We must make Japan ' s thinking known to the United States in an appropriate way , &quot; the Socialist leader told reporters . The stamp , to be issued by the U.S. Postal Service next year as one of a series to commemorate the 50th anniversary of World_War_II ' s end , depicts an atomic_bomb mushroom_cloud and carries a caption reading , &quot; Atomic bombs hasten the war ' s end , August , 1945. &quot; The flare-up marked the second acrimonious dispute that has erupted over the upcoming anniversary . Plans by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington to display the Enola Gay , the B-29 aircraft that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima , and artifacts of the bomb ' s effects in Hiroshima and Nagasaki stirred protests from American veterans groups and the U.S. Congress . They complained that depictions of the suffering caused by the devices ' use distorted the historical backdrop of the bombings . In the wake of the protests , the Smithsonian agreed to remove part of the displays showing the devastation caused by the bombs . Earlier this month , U.S. Ambassador Walter F . Mondale warned of impending emotional trouble over commemorations of the end of World_War_II that are being planned in both countries . &quot; Here we are 50 years after the war , and we still cannot agree on the facts of what happened , &quot; Mondale said . Americans generally believe that the bombs -- which killed about 140 # 000 of Hiroshima ' s 340 # 000 residents and 70 # 000 of Nagasaki ' s 270 # 000 in 1945 -- saved hundreds of thousands of American troops who might have been forced to have staged a ground invasion of the Japanese mainland . But the Japanese believe that the civilian toll and the survivors ' distress over radiation illnesses even decades later made the attacks inhuman and unjustifiable . Murayama made his statement after Foreign Minister Yohei Kono , Chief Cabinet Secretary Kozo Igarashi and leaders of organizations of survivors of atomic_bombs dropped_in Hiroshima Aug . 6 , 1945 , and Nagasaki Aug . 9 , 1945 , all condemned the stamp as an attempt to justify the bombings . &quot; It is disagreeable to see such a stamp in_view of the special feeling of the Japanese people , &quot; Kono said . Igarashi noted that &quot; more_than 300 # 000 people ( including those who died after 1945 ) were killed , and even now there are those who are suffering atomic_bomb illnesses . We want ( the United States to realize ) that pain exists deep in the hearts of the Japanese people. &quot; One official who tried to avoid criticizing the stamp was forced to retract his remark . Terusuke Terada , the Foreign Ministry ' s spokesman , initially said the timing of Japan ' s surrender nine days after the Hiroshima bomb lent credence to the &quot; way of thinking &quot; that the bombs did hasten Japan ' s surrender . In withdrawing his remark , Terada said only that he wanted &quot; to avoid historical judgments at this stage. &quot; In Washington , the Postal Service replied to Japanese criticism of the planned stamp , saying a citizens ' advisory committee had studied the issue carefully . &quot; With regard_to the specific stamp in_question , we would be remiss in omitting such a watershed and historically critical event as the use of the atomic_bomb , &quot; agency spokesman Robin Wright said . &quot; . . . Our purpose is to provide a comprehensive history of the events of World_War_II , and we are not making a value judgment on any of those events. &quot; Times staff writer Jim Mann in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
