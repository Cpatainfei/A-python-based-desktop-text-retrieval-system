   <HEADLINE> FIRST VACCINE FOR CHICKENPOX PASSES KEY STEP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first vaccine to prevent chickenpox took a major step toward federal approval Thursday when a key advisory committee concluded that the experimental vaccine is safe and effective against the common childhood disease that afflicts 4 million children annually . Chickenpox , a highly contagious illness characterized by fever , weakness and a rash that itches and blisters , is virtually the only significant childhood ailment for which there has been no approved vaccine . Vaccines already are in widespread use for diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis ( whooping_cough ) , measles , mumps , rubella ( German_measles ) and polio , among others . In a nearly unanimous decision , the FDA vaccines advisory committee said : &quot; There is available data to support claims of safety and efficacy for children , adolescents and adults. &quot; &quot; We ' re very pleased , &quot; said Dr. Gordon Douglas , president of Merck &amp; Co. ' s vaccine division , which developed the vaccine . &quot; We believe the vaccine is safe and effective , and will be a big advance in terms of children ' s health in this country . We think that prevention is always far preferable to treatment. &quot; * While advisory committee decisions and recommendations are not binding on the agency , they typically wield considerable influence in FDA decision-making . If approval comes quickly , the vaccine could be available by summer . Officials of Merck , which is based in Whitehouse Station , N.J. , told the committee that its studies have shown the vaccine to be highly effective . Dr. Jo White , senior director of the company ' s research laboratories , told the committee that in a controlled study , the vaccine &quot; provided 98 % protection from . . . disease following one dose of vaccine in healthy children ( whose progress was ) followed for two years. &quot; In follow-up studies of more_than 9 # 000 children over 12 years old , only 1 % to 3 % of them developed a mild form of the disease after they were exposed , she said . Research conducted in a household setting -- where exposure typically results in severe disease -- demonstrated that the vaccine provided 98 % protection , she said . She defined severe disease as cases in which an individual had &quot; 300 lesions or more and a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. &quot; In its submissions to the FDA , the company has suggested that children 1 to 12 years old receive a single dose of the vaccine and that those 13 or older , including adults , be given two doses one to two months apart . The vaccine has caused minimal side_effects in a small percentage of children -- with a mild rash the most serious . A similar vaccine already is in_use in Japan , Korea and several countries in Europe . &quot; I think this will be a very important addition to our vaccine arsenal , &quot; said Dr. Richard Duma , executive_director of the National Foundation for Infectious_Diseases . &quot; There are a lot of studies that indicate the vaccine will be cost-effective , that at least $ 4 or $ 5 will be saved for every dollar spent , &quot; Duma added . &quot; If it is used widely , I think there ' s a very good chance we can basically wave goodby to chickenpox. &quot; In normal , otherwise healthy children , chickenpox , or varicella , generally is a benign disease , although the rash can be quite severe . In some cases , complications can occur , resulting in hospitalizations and even deaths . * &quot; Children can get very sick from it -- they are uncomfortable , they lose time from school , and parents have to stay home and take_care of them , &quot; Merck ' s Douglas said . &quot; Some get very sick and about 9 # 000 get hospitalized , and there are some deaths in normal children every year. &quot; Complications can include bacterial skin infections arising from the rash and , more rarely , encephalitis ( infection of the brain ) , meningitis ( infections of the covering of the brain ) and Reye ' s syndrome , a sometimes fatal illness that results when aspirin is given to children suffering from chickenpox or flu . For most people , however -- including children who get sick and the parents who must stay home and care_for them -- chickenpox is an uncomfortable , costly and inconvenient nuisance . After the disease , individuals usually maintain a lifelong immunity to chickenpox and do not suffer further episodes . But the virus can reactivate later in life as shingles , a painful skin_condition .</TEXT>
