   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN ALBUM : NUCLEAR TESTING NO LONGER SUPPORTS BOOM_TOWN ; THE COLD_WAR ' S DEMISE HAS IMPERILED THE FUTURE OF A DESERT ENCLAVE NEAR ATOMIC BOMBING_SITE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When you turn_off U.S. Highway 95 on the five-mile-long spur road that takes you to Mercury , you pass two square compounds surrounded by high chain-link fences . They are holding areas , one for men and one for women . For years , peace demonstrators who periodically blocked the road into Mercury and the U.S. nuclear_weapons test site were detained in the rocky , unsheltered pens . Afterward , buses hauled them away to be booked on formal charges . Now , the pens are little more_than relics of the Cold_War . And Mercury itself may_not have much of a future . More_than a town , this desert enclave was and is a base camp for the sprawling desert test site where the United States exploded 925 atomic_bombs between 1951 and 1992 . But a year and a half has passed since the last &quot; shot &quot; in the Nevada desert . Whether there will ever be another one is an open question . Test workers are already being laid_off . Total employment for the entire weapons-testing program is down to 7 # 000 from a peak of 10 # 000 . As_many as 500 more jobs may be lost at the 1 # 350-square-mile test site before the year is over . Workers who remain pore over the results of the most recent underground explosions and maintain two sites where preparations for tests were almost complete when President George_Bush declared a moratorium in 1992 . President Clinton has extended the ban through September , 1994 , provided no other countries resume testing . Mercury can be excused if its feelings are ambivalent . Time was when its dormitories were filled to capacity , and communities of campers , trailers and mobile_homes were crowded . At one time , more_than 6 # 000 soldiers camped in tents at Camp Desert Rock , a temporary post just to the south . The movie_theater and the bowling_alley were booming in those days , as was the post_office , the cafeteria , the laundry and all_the offices and warehouses clustered in the valley . Scientists from Los Alamos and Lawrence-Livermore Laboratory regularly flew in and out of Desert Rock Airport , along with government officials from Washington and cargo planes bringing explosives to be tested . In the days when tests were still conducted in the atmosphere -- bombs dropped from planes , suspended beneath balloons or mounted in high towers -- reporters from around the world were ushered through . Out on a pile of rocks called News Nob , they could watch mushroom_clouds rise into the stratosphere . They made Frenchman Flat and Yucca Flat internationally known datelines during the strategic arms race . Above ground and underground , the explosions during four decades left the desert floor so pockmarked by craters that high-altitude photographs of the area looked more like the moon than the Earth . The largest atmospheric test , called Hood , created a 74-kiloton explosion in 1957 . The largest underground shot was 1.3 megatons , 65 times the power of the bomb that leveled Hiroshima in 1945 . There were other memorable explosions as well . Not long after the site opened in 1951 , a device dropped from a B-50 bomber above Frenchman Flat broke store windows in Las Vegas . Sedan , a 104-kiloton device exploded 635 feet underground , lifted 12 million tons of earth into the sky . Part of a program to demonstrate the utility of nuclear explosives in earth-moving projects , it created a crater 1 # 250 feet in diameter and 320 feet deep . With worldwide concern over radioactive materials entering the food_chain , atmospheric tests were banned by the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty negotiated in 1963 . Its restrictions have since been stiffened . In 1990 , the United States ratified another treaty , negotiated during the Richard Nixon Administration , that limited the size of underground tests to no more_than 150 kilotons . Throughout the history of the test site , the government was able to conduct smaller explosions deep underground that went undetected for decades . Last year , in keeping with its new policy of openness , the Energy_Department recently announced 204 tests never before acknowledged . These days , however , the only activity on the test site is the arrival of visitors to tour the craters and see the ghostly remains of the bridges and buildings that were erected in the desert to help experts study the effects of nuclear_weapons . They can look_into the giant Sedan crater , where Apollo 14 astronauts later trained for their visit to the moon . They can drive into the Bixby crater , created by a blast that sent memorable tremors through Las Vegas . They can visit the site of the Apple II test , where a house was seared but Joshua_trees , 200 years old and more , survived . And they can still find the trenches , now overgrown by scrub , where soldiers crouched , getting as close as troops have ever come_to combat on a nuclear battlefield .</TEXT>
