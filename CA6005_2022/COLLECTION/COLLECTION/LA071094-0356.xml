   <HEADLINE> PALESTINIAN POLICE HELD IN MAN ' S DEATH ; GAZA STRIP : THE PLO GOVERNMENT FACES ITS FIRST HUMAN_RIGHTS CHALLENGE IN THE KILLING OF A PRISONER ACCUSED OF COLLABORATING WITH THE ISRAELIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Faced with its first major human_rights test , the new Palestinian Authority is moving quickly to bring_to justice three members of its police_force accused of beating to death a taxi driver suspected of collaborating with the Israeli secret_police . Khaled Kidra , the Palestinian prosecutor general , said Saturday that the three Palestinian officers were arrested after an autopsy showed that Farid Jarbou had been severely beaten &quot; close to sensitive areas of his body &quot; during interrogation last week and had died &quot; as the result of the use of violence. &quot; Jarbou , 28 , from the southern Gaza town of Shabura , was arrested June 25 on suspicion of working for Shin Bet , Israel ' s secret_service , according to Palestinian officials . He was found dead in his cell in the interrogation wing of the Al Saraya prison complex in the Gaza Strip before dawn Tuesday , officials said . Freih abu Medein , the justice minister , in a statement Saturday condemned the killing as a &quot; very grave offense &quot; and promised that &quot; all those found responsible &quot; would be punished . At the same time , the issue of Palestinians who have worked for Israeli intelligence and security services , as hundreds have , is one of the most sensitive the Palestinian Authority faces because of the intense popular hatred toward them . As Israeli forces prepared to withdraw from Gaza , it reportedly recruited even more agents in what Palestinian security officials contend was an effort not only to ensure continued intelligence from the region but to manipulate politics there . &quot; The recruitment of these informants and agents is a dirty , dirty game , &quot; a senior security aide to Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat said , &quot; and we will be a long_time in cleaning_up the results . . . . A lot of that dirt inevitably will soil us. &quot; Two captains in the counterintelligence branch of the Palestinian security service and an &quot; interrogator &quot; have been arrested , Justice Ministry officials said , and are expected to be tried by court-martial . Jarbou ' s death was the first of a prisoner since Israel handed_over the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority two months ago , and it renewed fears among Palestinian and international human_rights groups about adherence to the rule_of_law . &quot; We are very concerned that Mr. Jarbou ' s death appears to have been caused by severe abuse by the Palestinian security services , &quot; said Kenneth Roth , executive_director of the New York-based Human_Rights Watch . &quot; At the same time , we are encouraged that the authorities have acknowledged the abuse and are saying that three members of the security_forces have been arrested . &quot; At this early stage of Palestinian self-rule , the authorities need to send clear signals that violations of human_rights will not be tolerated , and we hope that their handling of this death in detention will exemplify this approach , &quot; he said . In a letter to Abu Medein , Human_Rights Watch also urged the Palestinian Authority to establish an office where complaints about police abuse , as well as other human_rights violations , can be made by prisoners , their lawyers and families . The Washington-based human_rights group Solidarity International also said it was investigating after receiving a complaint from Jarbou ' s family . Arafat has promised Amnesty International that the Palestinians will apply internationally recognized human_rights standards in the autonomous Gaza Strip and the Jericho District in the West_Bank . But in its annual report , Amnesty said last week that Palestinian groups &quot; continued grave human_rights abuses , including torture and deliberate and arbitrary killings. &quot;</TEXT>
