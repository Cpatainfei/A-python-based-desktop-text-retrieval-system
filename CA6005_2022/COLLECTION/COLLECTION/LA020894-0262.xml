   <HEADLINE> 3 INCHES OF RAIN DUE IN STRONGEST STORM OF WINTER ; WEATHER : STEADY DOWNPOUR HAS CAUSED NO SERIOUS HILLSIDE EROSION . BUT OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SLIDES IN FIRE-SCORCHED AREAS IF SHOWERS INTENSIFY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The most potent storm of the season was expected to drop up_to three inches of rain in some areas of the county and blanket mountainous areas above 4 # 000 feet with up_to two feet of snow before skies clear later today . But the rain , which fell steadily through Sunday night and Monday at a pace of less than a quarter-inch per hour , sank into the ground and did not cause major hillside erosion , officials said . If the rain continues at the same pace , then subsides for at least three days as expected , county Public Works officials do not anticipate problems . But if the rainfall intensifies , officials and residents are concerned about potential mud and debris slides in areas where the October fires scorched hillsides above residences . Barbara Boone , whose Deer Valley Avenue house sits at the foot of a still charred and barren hill in Newbury Park , said she had a foot of mud in her home after rains in December . Now , she said , the back of her house is protected with sandbags as she watches the hillside . &quot; We haven ' t had the slightest bit of a problem so far , but I was up every hour looking_at the window , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' re still very nervous. &quot; John Philpott , who lives_on Erinlea Avenue in Newbury Park , said he was grateful that the rain has been gentle . &quot; So far , we ' ve been real lucky with the rain being light , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s been quite a year . We ' ve gone_through the fire , the earthquake and now , here come the rains. &quot; Locally heavy showers and hail were expected in some areas Monday night , with possible thunderstorms in the mountains . But today , scattered showers in the morning were forecast to give_way to clearing skies in the afternoon , said National Weather Service meteorologist Debra Rominger . Gusty winds_up to 30 m.p.h. were expected through the week , but no rain is forecast before Friday , she said . Sheri Klittich , soil conservationist for the U.S. Soil_Conservation Service office in Somis , said the agency has been applying a mixture of mulch , seed and a glue-like substance to the burned hillsides in an attempt to create a ground_cover of vegetation to prevent mudslides . * But up until now , she said , there has not been enough rain for the seeds to take_root , and the cover has not returned . But she said the mulch will help slow any runoff . The areas without vegetation or mulch could be vulnerable to a slide once the ground is saturated . &quot; With the burn , you get a multiplier effect , &quot; she said . &quot; A storm that might happen only every 10 years would act like a 100-year event and the impacts could increase dramatically. &quot; Since the October fires , including the Green Meadow fire in Thousand Oaks and the Steckle fire above Santa Paula , the Department of Public Works has begun construction on three catch basins -- graded areas with earth dams designed to trap silt and debris and minimize mudslide problems . Two of the basins built_in canyons above Santa Paula are incomplete but are nevertheless expected to operate well enough to contain any mud flow , said Dolores Taylor , division engineer for Ventura County Public Works . But the third basin being built_in Newbury Park got a later start and would probably offer little protection , she said . &quot; Much of the burn area is underlined by bedrock , so there is just the surface_soil that can come_off there , &quot; Taylor said . She said other areas of concern are places where the mountains have been graded , and that &quot; compacted soil can get saturated and start moving. &quot; The city of Thousand Oaks has built_up banks of gravel in the canyons above the Deer Ridge area that burned during the fire . The banks are designed to allow the water to go_through , while cutting_down the flow of silt and mud . &quot; We haven ' t had any problems yet , &quot; said Gil Pableo , city engineer . * In Simi Valley , rain may have settled into some of the cracks in the earth created by the Jan . 17 earthquake , said Michael Kuhn , senior planner for the city . That could cause additional settling of the ground , he said . And there is some concern that the earthquake may have left some canyon areas unstable , but those areas are not populated , he said . Simi ' s planned Whiteface development , which would include 1 # 600 homes between Tapo and Sand canyons , could be an area of concern , so the developer has been instructed to have a geologist investigate the stability of the area , he said . In Fillmore , rain delayed demolition of the Fillmore Hotel and the city ' s Mason ' s Building , but demolition was expected to resume as soon as the rain let_up . Crews used sandbags to shore_up a domed tent that was erected to house displaced merchants after the earthquake . Public Works crews were out Monday patrolling streets and drainage_ditches to make_sure that county roads were kept free_of rocks and flooding . Road maintenance engineer Loren Blair said the roads were clear . &quot; We ' re keeping_an_eye_on the Yerba Buena area because there is not a lot of vegetation left up there to stop runoff. &quot; But crews were not expected to be needed through the night , he said . The rain forced crews cleaning_up an oil spill in the Santa Clara River east of Piru to postpone much of their work . Only a_few hand crews and three vacuum trucks were at_work on Monday cleaning_up oil that spilled from a ruptured pipeline during the earthquake . More_than 400 people were working_on the cleanup last week . Bob Schlichting , a spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Game , now estimates the spill at 193 # 494 gallons , and said it is about 25 % cleaned_up . The rain could spread the remaining oil downstream if river runoff breaches the berms built_up to contain the spill , Schlichting said . &quot; But if we got a really heavy rain , it could actually help wash it down the river and out_to sea , &quot; he added . * Meanwhile , crews finished the cleanup at McGrath Lake , where another ruptured pipeline that was discovered on Christmas_Day spilled 84 # 000 gallons into the lake , the surrounding wetlands and creek . Heidi Togstad , who supervised the cleanup for Fish and Game ' s Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response , said the official declaration will come_after state parks officials sign_off on the cleanup . Test results showed that even less oil than expected remained at the lake_bottom , she said . &quot; It seems like we got the vast majority of that oil , &quot; Togstad said . &quot; But we dug_up a lot of earth and we removed a lot of soil. &quot; * Correspondents Matthew Mosk and Scott Hadly contributed to this story . * RELATED STORY : Mudslides surge through beachfront houses in Malibu .
