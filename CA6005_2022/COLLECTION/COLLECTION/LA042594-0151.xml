   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; LACMA ' S SPANISH SCULPTURE : A SMALL GEM OF A SHOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mention Renaissance and Baroque sculpture in Europe , and you ' re likely first to think_of Italy , then perhaps of some_other region of the central continent , such_as France or Germany . The Iberian Peninsula probably won ' t come_to_mind . Nor will sculpture made of painted wood . Because Italian Renaissance and Baroque artists wanted their work to resonate off the vaunted traditions of Greek and Roman antiquity , bronze and marble were their preferred mediums . Sculpture of painted wood seems vaguely medieval , an artifact of that supposed &quot; dark age &quot; of irrational superstition that had followed the catastrophic decline of glorious antiquity . For this and other reasons , the painted wood ( and occasionally terra-cotta ) reliefs and free-standing figures in the exhibition &quot; Spanish Polychrome Sculpture ( 1500-1800 ) in United States Collections &quot; will likely be new_to most museum visitors . If it registers at all , painted Spanish sculpture of the 16th through the 18th Century might come_to_mind as a prominent prototype for colonial devotional sculpture in the Caribbean , the Americas and the Philippines , where Spain had far-flung outposts . The unprecedented exhibition of 37 sculptures , which was organized by the Spanish Institute in New York and currently may be seen at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , is a small gem . Three centuries are a lot to cover with just three dozen objects , while many individual sculptures were originally meant to be seen as part of large and complex altarpieces . Still , the provocative show offers a solid overview of this rarely considered art . Almost never does this religious sculpture awe with authoritative power . Authority is simply assumed in doctrinal art , for these are effigies of holy people . Instead , even the bloodiest of what can be a very bloody art , such_as intensely veristic depictions of a tortured Christ , seems designed to perform an elaborate seduction . The use of paint to achieve highly realistic human flesh , of glass_eyes whose reflectiveness seems moist , of dazzlingly decorative estofado -- a laborious technique in which incised gilding catches flickering candlelight , pumping up the theatrical magic -- all conspire to create an empathetic pathway for a viewer . This is sculpture conceived as a doorway , opening away from the physical and onto a metaphysical world , and partaking of both . Spain ' s Catholic_Church knew that you catch more believers with honey , and the artists in their service laid it on with often astonishing skill . Frequently , as in an exquisite rendition of a martyred 18-year-old -- St . Stanislaus Kostka , the first Jesuit to be beatified -- the artist would juxtapose a serenely idealized figure with tempestuous , dramatic drapery . Hints of the elaborate excitement of the saintly story swirl around the fixed compass of a coolly unruffled figure , like an echo of a thrilling hurricane around a storm ' s calm eye . Another standard device , found in more_than half the objects at LACMA , is the brilliant , seemingly simple technique of carving the figure ' s mouth in a slightly open position . These sculptural men and women seem to register an eternal sigh -- a silent exhalation whose aura of longing is tinged with grief . The slightly opened mouth is also a unique stylistic convention remarkable for its subtle effectiveness . It signals a figure about to speak , but of course unable to . In the face of holy mystery these beatific saints are pointedly rendered as speechless . Spanish polychrome sculpture is radically different from Italian bronze and marble sculpture of the period , but not just for mundane reasons of material . Spaniards may_not have had marble quarries or a tradition of bronze sculpture to mine , but neither explains the distinctive tenor of their painted sculpture . * In Italy , an acute consciousness of progress and modernity was paramount : Artistic allusions to classical antiquity were meant to celebrate a cultural origin , but their sharp departure from medieval convention also meant to show how far civilization had come since Greece and Rome . In Spain , by contrast , the manifold realities of the present were instead a launching_pad to communion with eternal mysteries . Medieval conventions were not jettisoned or wholly transformed by artists , as much as added_on to newer Renaissance and Baroque forms ; the unusual cumulative style meant to be perpetually alluring . From our postmodern vantage_point today , this artistic strategy has much to tell us . A few pieces did not travel_to California from the East . And unfortunately missing from all venues were any works from the New York-based Hispanic Society of America , home to the largest and most significant collection of this material in the country , but which has a firm policy against making loans . Still , several worthwhile additions exclusive to the presentation in Los Angeles make_up for the loss . Most notable are two wood sculptures , one of St . Mark ( circa 1560 ) wrapped in wildly energetic drapery , the other a grave and imposing life-size figure of the obscure St . Gines de la Jara . Believed to have been carved in 1692 by Jose Caro , the latter is a gilded eye-dazzler acquired awhile back by the J . Paul Getty Museum and now making its public debut after extensive conservation work . The St . Mark -- dramatic and very Italianate in its tornado of Mannerist style -- is by Alonso Berruguete , perhaps the most influential sculptor in Renaissance Spain . LACMA has added eight liturgical vestments and textiles from its own collection , in_order to provide a bit of context . Some , such_as a tapestry fragment embroidered with dragons juxtaposed to a carved relief panel from a choir stall , are remarkably similar not only in_general style and mood but in specific design . * The show also offers LACMA a chance to highlight a small , astonishingly beautiful painted terra-cotta figure that has been in its collection since 1978 . Barely a foot tall , and clad in a Cistercian monk ' s habit whose exquisite modeling yields a stunning monumentality that belies its modest size , the figure of St . Bernard of Clairvaux , head tossed_back and arms outstretched , seems poised to lift_off its little pedestal and ascend into the ether . And that , in a nutshell , suggests what is so distinctive about Spanish Renaissance and Baroque sculpture . &quot; Come with me , &quot; these figures beckon . You ' re inclined to want to follow . * LACMA , 5905 Wilshire Blvd. , ( 213 ) 857-6000 , through June 26 . Closed Mondays and Tuesdays .</TEXT>
