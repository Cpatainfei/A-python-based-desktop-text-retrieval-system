   <HEADLINE> VENETIAN CLASS ; GUINEA_HEN . GOOSE-BREAST PROSCIUTTO . BLACK RISOTTO . NOT YOUR EVERYDAY ITALIAN MENU .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At one end of Santa Monica ' s Third Street Promenade , heavy terra-cotta pots and canvas market umbrellas mark_off the tiny sidewalk terrace of Remi , an oasis of good taste in the midst of flashy fast-food outlets and tired trendy venues . It ' s not exactly new -- it opened in 1990 -- but Remi is one of the most consistent and truly pleasant Italian restaurants in L.A. It ' s not too loud . The lighting gives everyone a Scavullo-like glow . And the blue-and white-striped canvas banquettes and the dainty chairs with bowed_legs are actually comfortable . Designer Adam Tihany has an eye for subtly beautiful details : watery handblown glass chandeliers , smart yellow-and-red glass sconces from Murano , a polished hardwood floor striped in lighter wood . The menu , too , takes its inspiration from the Veneto . You can begin with a definitive version of carpaccio ( the dish of finely sliced raw beef that was virtually invented at Harry ' s Bar in Venice ) , then order the dark risotto with squid ink or a classic fegato alla veneziana ( calves ' liver with caramelized onions and grilled polenta ) ; and for dessert , a straightforward tiramisu or a plate of delicate little Venetian cookies . The chef is Josie Le Balch , who has been cooking here since the beginning . She was trained by the original chef-owner , Francesco Antinucci , a Venetian , who left after a_few months to reopen the original New York Remi in a larger space . ( There are also Remis in Mexico_City and Tel Aviv. ) Le Balch has a fine , restrained hand and an instinctive understanding of the simplicity and clean , focused flavors of northern Italian cooking . While she ' s true_to its spirit , her menu doesn ' t read like that of every_other restaurant on the canal . To start , there ' s a sumptuous smoked goose-breast prosciutto luxuriously perfumed with truffle oil . One night , you could also order bresa ola , a ruddy , cured , air-dried beef from the mountains that is usually garnished with a thread of olive_oil . The sharp and peppery arugula salad , with its pounded walnut-olive sauce , shaved Parmesan and soft , caramelized , slightly sweet-and-sour shallots , was excellent . The &quot; grappalox &quot; is another sterling starter : gorgeous and satiny , with the faint taste of grappa and crushed pink peppercorns . The lightly breaded scallops with a delicious , earthy salad of cannellini and borlotti beans is also delicious . The kitchen will make half orders of pasta dishes ( but not risotto ) or split an order for a slight charge . I could have happily eaten an entire order of the pasta special one night , penne with speck ( smoked , raw-cured ham ) and baby artichokes in a light tomato_sauce . What ' s puzzling is how penne piccanti on another occasion could have come from the same kitchen . The overcooked pasta was cloaked in a terribly over-reduced tomato_sauce . It ' s back to Pasta 101 for this one . Le Balch ' s heart seems to be more in the specials , like the exemplary handmade agnolotti with a classic filling of ricotta and fresh spinach , tossed_in browned_butter and frizzled sage leaves . Ravioli Marco Polo , filled with fresh tuna in a shrimp-tomato sauce and topped with shreds of ginger , sounds intriguing , but in the end , this melding of East and West just doesn ' t work . Risotto is notoriously difficult to make in a restaurant . Remi comes_through with an outstanding risotto al nero di seppie , rice cooked with squid and its rich , sea-scented ink . A risotto special one night of shrimp and radicchio was in the same league . The spinach gnocchi ? Well , I found them just a bit gummy , the tomato_sauce again too thick . Among the eight secondi , the Chilean sea_bass is an appealing update on the Venetian sweet and sour pesce en sao r . Here the flaky filets are presented with rosy vinegar-marinated onions and sultanas . Rolled in cracked pepper , the rare ahi tuna with a dice of tomatoes and grilled bitter endive is about as good a version as I ' ve had . The guinea_hen is another excellent choice , the flavorful bird simply grilled and served with soft polenta , carrots and pancetta . But the big Florentine-style steak is no match for the fiorentina served at Campanile . For dessert , consider the rustic apple tart or the budino , a round of barely sweetened , extravagantly rich mascarpone set_on a layer of fresh berries . Or the starfish-shaped zabaglione , browned in the oven and served with a scoop of crema gelato . Ordering wine from Remi ' s list can be frustrating ; the best bottles are overpriced , and when you do find an affordable Italian wine , it often turns_out to be a mediocre vintage . The 1991 Anselmi Soave Classico &quot; Capitel Croce &quot; ( $ 25 ) and the 1990 Frescobaldi Chianti Rufina &quot; Nipozzano &quot; riserva ( $ 35 ) are among the best choices from this uninspired list . Remi is one of the few cigar-friendly restaurants in town . There ' s no smoking in the restaurant proper , though it is allowed at the bar , but after dinner , you can purchase a Davidoff cigar and retire either to the terrace or to the wine room ( if it ' s not booked ) for a smoke and a glass of spirits . It does have an enticing array of cognacs , armagnacs and , especially , grappas , more_than 45 , including several outstanding examples from the reigning queen of grappa , Giannola Nonino ( $ 25 a shot ) , and from the top Veneto producer , Jacopo Poli ( $ 15 to $ 20 a shot ) . Prices like these may be one reason why the grappa craze seems to have peaked . ( In all fairness , Remi does have a number of less distinguished Italian grappas in the $ 8 to $ 10 range. ) Still , there ' s no more Italian way to end a meal at this dependable Santa Monica spot than with a_few drops of the fiery spirit . Remi Restaurant , 1451 Third Street Promenade , Santa Monica ; ( 310 ) 393-6545 . Smoking in bar and wine room . Valet parking on Broadway . Dinner for two , food only , $ 49- $ 95 . Corkage , $ 10 .</TEXT>
