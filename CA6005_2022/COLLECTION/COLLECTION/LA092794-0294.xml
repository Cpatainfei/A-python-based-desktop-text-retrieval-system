   <HEADLINE> NOON WINS $ 1-MILLION JURY AWARD ; JURISPRUDENCE : VERDICT IN FAVOR OF FORMER NCAA SHOTPUT CHAMPION IS INTENDED TO SEND USA TRACK &amp; FIELD A MESSAGE ABOUT DRUG TESTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sending a strong message to USA Track &amp; Field , a San Diego Superior_Court jury Monday awarded Brent Noon , three-time NCAA shotput champion from the University of Georgia , almost $ 1 million in a suit over a 1992 drug test . Noon , 22 , claimed that the national governing body for the sport illegally banned him from competition in 1992 when he failed to take the test , violated its own rules and then tried to conceal mistakes by back-dating documents . Noon said he ' d suffered mental distress because the suspension , handed_down five weeks before the U.S. Olympic track_and_field trials , adversely affected his ability to make the 1992 Olympic team . &quot; Brent did this to stop this kind of conduct ( by track officials ) , to make_sure it didn ' t happen to any other athletes , &quot; said Terry Singleton , an Escondido attorney representing Noon , who could not be reached for comment . Pete Cava , USA Track spokesman , said the organization will file an appeal . &quot; Of course it ' s disappointing , &quot; he said from Indianapolis . &quot; But we don ' t want to say much. &quot; Monday ' s verdict concludes a two-year battle for Noon , who also had sued Art Venegas , UCLA ' s assistant track coach , for defamation . Noon claimed that Venegas had spread rumors that the shotputter from Fallbrook used anabolic_steroids to become California ' s all-time best . UCLA and Venegas settled with Noon in July . Terms of the settlement were sealed by Superior_Court Judge Richard Haden . John Campbell , USA Track ' s attorney , said the award was about as much as Noon asked_in settlement proceedings . Although Noon was awarded $ 983 # 000 , Campbell said it will be reduced to $ 740 # 000 . Still , he said USA Track did nothing wrong beyond making a human error . &quot; The result does not fit the evidence , &quot; Campbell said . Jurors said they wanted to send a message to track officials to ensure athletes are handled fairly when undergoing drug testing . &quot; They ruined his reputation , ruined his name and they were going_to pay_for it , &quot; Singleton said . &quot; I understood ( the decision ) has tremendous ramifications for other athletes who come_through the system , &quot; said Eletta Files , a juror from Lakeside , Calif . Noon claimed he was banned in April of 1992 . The notice was sent to Fallbrook , but the Noons had moved to Athens , where Noon was enrolled at Georgia . Then a drug-test kit was sent to Georgia ' s athletic department with instructions to return it within 48 hours . Noon said he learned of the request a day after the deadline . Although he claimed not to have known about the test and offered to take it afterward , Noon was banned . His eligibility was restored after five weeks , but Noon said the ordeal affected his training . He finished ninth at the Olympic trials .
