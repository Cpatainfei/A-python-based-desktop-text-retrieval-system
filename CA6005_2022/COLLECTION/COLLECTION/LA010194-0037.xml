   <HEADLINE> RACIAL RAGE CLAIMS 4 MORE LIVES IN S . AFRICA ; VIOLENCE : RADICAL BLACK GROUPS TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACK . INCIDENT SHOWS CAPE_TOWN IS NOT IMMUNE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Welder Roland Palm decided it was time to take his 22-year-old daughter , Rolanda , who had graduated recently from college , out for &quot; a good father-daughter chat &quot; Thursday night at his favorite local pub . Like the surrounding neighborhood , the Heidelberg bar was filled with mostly white students and young professionals . To avoid the crush , the Palms sat drinking near the door when five black youths walked in shortly before midnight and , without a word , fired a rifle_grenade and began shooting from the hip with assault_rifles . &quot; At the first burst , I pulled her down , &quot; said Palm , sobbing as he spoke . &quot; But she just ducked her head . that ' s when she got hit. &quot; When the shooting and screaming stopped , three women , including Rolanda Palm , lay dead inside the bar and a fourth victim lay on the street outside . Five others were wounded . Dozens of bullets had scarred the wooden walls . Police said the death toll would have been far worse , but the grenade , which the killers had packed with nails , failed to explode . &quot; If that grenade had gone_off , it would have killed us all , &quot; survivor Steve Hamilton said . He said he &quot; hit_the_deck &quot; when the shooting began , and watched in horror as the three women &quot; jerked like puppets &quot; when they were hit . The South_African Press Assn . reported that men claiming to represent two radical black organizations that violently oppose sharing power with whites -- the Azanian People ' s Liberation Army and the Azanian National Liberation Army -- telephoned separately to claim responsibility for the massacre . Neither claim could be confirmed . But the latest deadly racial attack did confirm that Cape_Town , a seaside resort that prides itself as a bastion of liberal politics and traditions in a country of conservatives , is not immune to the explosive rage that still seethes in South_Africa ' s black township slums as the nation moves away from apartheid and toward majority_rule . Indeed , this gracious city of colonial buildings , leafy public gardens , busy outdoor cafes and a spectacular setting on the slopes of cloud-shrouded Table Mountain has seen the country ' s worst black-on-white violence of the last year . And many fear more is yet to come_in the run-up to democratic elections in April . &quot; It ' s clearly political extremists trying to unsettle the people , to terrorize them , to derail everything we have all worked for , &quot; said Ian Iversen , a city councilman . In April , for example , Cape_Town suffered the country ' s bloodiest and most destructive race_riots after the assassination of popular black leader Chris Hani . Rampaging mobs attacked white passersby , shopkeepers and even white officials of Nelson Mandela ' s African National Congress . In July , several black gunmen armed with assault_rifles and hand_grenades killed 11 people and wounded more_than 50 others in an attack on a multiracial congregation at a suburban church . A 17-year-old youth is_due to stand trial for the massacre in February . Then in August , a chanting crowd of black youths in Guguletu township stabbed and beat to death Amy Biehl , a 26-year-old Fulbright scholar from Newport Beach , Calif. , simply because she was white . Her death_capped a campaign in which white visitors to the township were openly stoned and attacked . Like the others , the Heidelberg bar massacre drew quick denunciations from political and religious_leaders around the country . Police offered a $ 60 # 000 reward for help in arresting the gunmen . &quot; I ' m just very deeply shocked , really shattered , because somehow one was thinking that this kind of carnage was a thing of the past , &quot; Anglican Archbishop Desmond M . Tutu told reporters here . Black-on-white violence remains the exception in South_Africa . More_than 4 # 000 people died in political violence in 1993 , and the vast majority were blacks killed by other blacks in mostly anonymous attacks on hostels , homes and trains inside the townships . In a statement , the ANC noted that most of the deaths go unreported and unremarked . &quot; It is regrettable that there seems to be a different response when such attacks occur in townships as compared with those that occur where whites are victims , &quot; it said . Most township violence , the ANC added , is &quot; virtually dismissed as routine. &quot; Still , Cape_Town has seen itself as distinct from the rest of the country . It is the only city to consistently send members of the anti-apartheid white Democratic Party to Parliament , and the only one to boast of its racial tolerance in a country ruled by white_supremacists . But the city ' s liberal credentials have always been part illusion . Most whites were sheltered from the brutal reality of apartheid . Back behind Table Mountain , hidden from the crowded beaches and fancy French restaurants , are some of the country ' s most impoverished slums -- and blacks with some of the most bitter memories of white rule . This is the only part of the country where blacks are not in the majority . They are outnumbered by people of mixed race , classified as &quot; Colored. &quot; To keep it that way , the white government ruled during the apartheid years that blacks could stay only if they had a job -- and the only way to get a job was to prove that both a white and a Colored_person had turned it down . The result was a brutal campaign of forced removals -- and fierce resistance . Since most blacks were not supposed to be there , few hospitals , schools or other basic services were built for the more_than half a_million people who crowded into bleak townships and squatter areas that grew on the city ' s outskirts . Today , the desolate warrens of tin-roofed shacks and garbage-strewn lanes outside Cape_Town are home to some of the country ' s most militant and marginalized black youths . The Pan-Africanist Congress , with its notorious anti-white slogan of &quot; One settler , one bullet , &quot; considers the Cape townships a key stronghold . Those accused of Biehl ' s murder and the church massacre were members of the PAC or its student wing . And the APLA , one of the two groups claiming responsibility for the Heidelberg bar attack , is the armed wing of the PAC . Maj . Des Segal , chief police investigator , said those who attacked the church and the bar used similar weapons , ammunition and tactics . &quot; There are obvious similarities , &quot; he said , examining the bullet-riddled bar . Less clear is why the gunmen would attack Observatory , a fashionable , multiracial suburb that has a history of anti-apartheid activism . Blacks_and_whites mingle easily on streets lined with elegant Victorian homes , trendy boutiques and art_galleries . &quot; There ' s a complete state of shock here , &quot; said Stefanie Hefer , 30 , a local resident . &quot; This suburb is so cool . Everyone thought it was the last place for a racial attack. &quot; Anguished friends and neighbors placed dozens of bouquets of flowers along a curb near the Heidelberg bar Friday , and several hundred area residents gathered for a brief afternoon memorial service on the wind-swept street . Ebrahim Adams , 27 , wept quietly after placing a spray of flowers on the curb . He had survived the attack but was still in a state of shock , he said . &quot; You come here to have an enjoyment , and you can ' t even do that anymore , &quot; he said . &quot; You ' re bloody scared to go_out tonight . You don ' t know what to expect. &quot;</TEXT>
