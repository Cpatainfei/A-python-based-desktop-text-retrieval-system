   <HEADLINE> IN DJIBOUTI , INDEPENDENCE HAS BROUGHT LITTLE CHANGE ; AFRICA : AFTER 17 YEARS , NATION STILL RELIES HEAVILY ON FRENCH AID . ITS ONLY EXPORTS ARE GOATS AND CAMELS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a proud moment , one of the proudest this African outpost had known since being stillborn into nationhood 17 years ago . By 8 a.m. , a veritable Who ' s Who of Djibouti was_on hand for the ribbon-cutting ceremony that would open the new little airport with a single departure gate . There were French military_officers in their summer whites , ambassadors and government officials , and Siad Coubeche , who owns Djibouti ' s major commercial_enterprise -- a Coca-Cola bottling plant . Finally , arriving 45 minutes late in his Cadillac limousine , flanked by outriders on motorcycles , was the Somali-born president himself , Hassan Gouled Aptidon , 78 , Africa ' s oldest leader . &quot; We won ' t forget our friends who made this possible , &quot; Gouled said last week in French , nodding toward three Arabs in the crowd of dignitaries . Then he headed into the air-conditioned , marbled-floor terminal to marvel at a baggage conveyor_belt and a digital message board that flashed his name . Clerks in the duty-free shop snapped to attention as he approached . No matter that the one-jet national carrier , Air Djibouti , had gone belly up five years earlier or that only a dozen commercial flights a week -- half of them Air France jumbo jets from Paris -- would land here . This airport was a symbol of national identity and stood , along with a Sheraton Hotel , as one of the rare visible achievements of Djibouti ' s post-colonial era . Indeed , the former French Territory of Afars and Issas hasn ' t had much to cheer about since it became the last European colony in Africa to gain independence , on a steamy June night in 1977 . Not a single head_of_state showed_up that night to watch the_French tricolor lowered for the last night over Africa ; of the Djibouti males in_attendance , most sat quiet and glassy-eyed , chewing qat , a narcotic weed imported from Ethiopia to which almost all men here are addicted . A few weeks before independence , Gouled , a former camel herder with a sixth-grade education , was asked by a visiting journalist how a country that imported almost all_of its food , produced nothing except Coca-Cola and ice and counted among its 320 # 000 citizens three university graduates and no doctors could hope to survive economically . He replied , &quot; We have many possibilities -- salt , tourism , atomic_energy , maybe a duty-free port like Hong Kong. &quot; He took a puff on his French cigarette and paused for emphasis -- &quot; And French aid. &quot; No one would argue his last point . Probably no African_nation today remains more dependent_on its former colonial master . French aid and business account_for 60 % of Djibouti ' s gross_national_product , and were it not for the presence of 10 # 000 French nationals and soldiers , diplomats say , this empty , Vermont-sized wasteland might simply disintegrate as a country and be left for Somalia or Ethiopia to swallow_up . Djibouti ( meaning &quot; my casserole &quot; in the Afar language ) has but three national assets : an excellent Red_Sea port , which served as a backup staging_area during the Persian_Gulf_War ; a broken-down railway to Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , operating at 5 % capacity , and now , the airport . Its only exports are goats and camels -- which are transported on the hoof to Saudi_Arabia and the Gulf states . Its imports include almost everything it needs , from drinking_water to butter , meat and matchsticks . As if Djibouti ' s journey into independence weren ' t perilous enough , civil_war struck the country in 1991 when the minority Afars of the north took_up arms against Gouled ' s Somali-speaking Issa tribe . The tiny Djibouti army fell_apart and its commander_in_chief was suspended on corruption charges . Within weeks the Afar-based Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy ( FRUD ) controlled two-thirds of the country . France keeps 4 # 000 troops and legionnaires here -- its largest military presence in Africa -- but refused to intervene in the fighting . Left to his own devices , Gouled built_up a 15 # 000-man army , largely made_up of Issas recruited from Somalia and Ethiopia . By September , the Afars had been driven into the volcanic mountains of the north and across the border into Ethiopia . The war for now , at least , has sputtered to an end with the Afars the apparent losers . Although FRUD boycotted the May , 1993 , multi-party election that Gouled won handily , the government hopes to get peace talks under way with the rebels , perhaps this summer , and has announced plans to demobilize its army . In response to French urgings , Gouled has allowed an increasing degree of political debate . France , which colonized Djibouti in 1862 as a fueling stop for its Saigon- and Madagascar-bound ships , has left an imprint on this run-down capital that is as evident today as it was a century ago ; from an Air France cargo flight each Wednesday comes such an abundance of fine foods and luxury goods that a visitor might wonder if he were in Paris instead of Africa . In Place Menelik , Djibouti ' s dingy square , among cafes and bars nestled under urine-drenched arches , little stores , some with French shopkeepers , offer the latest fashions , finest jewelry and freshest vegetables from France . In the Cafe de Paris , the recent menu included sea_trout in leek sauce , endive and walnut salad , and sea_bream with cucumbers and pink peppers , complemented by a wide selection of wines and cheeses . Outside , on Rue de Paris and Rue de Marseille , children hawked postcards and chewing gum and handless beggars thrust their stumps in pedestrians ' faces . The stifling heat of day had diminished with the dusk when a group of French legionnaires headed into the Blue_Note and ordered Stella Artois beers . It could have been 1976 . Djibouti , though shabbier and dirtier , seemed largely unchanged by its journey into statehood .</TEXT>
