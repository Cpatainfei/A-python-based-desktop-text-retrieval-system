   <HEADLINE> AIR_BAG THEFT AN EXPANDING NEW PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Auto burglars from New York to Los Angeles have added an explosive new item to their list of things to steal -- air_bags . Insurance industry experts and police say the national outbreak is little more_than a_few months old , and although statistics are not yet available , there are plenty of word-of-mouth reports . &quot; It ' s becoming much more commonplace in urban_areas throughout the country , specifically on the East and West Coast , &quot; said Steven Goldstein , vice_president of the New York-based Insurance Information Institute , a national trade group representing property and casualty insurance carriers . The thefts for_sale to unscrupulous auto repair_shops were first reported in Detroit in late 1992 , and in the last six months the thefts have popped_up in Los Angeles , New York , St . Louis and several New Jersey cities , Goldstein said . &quot; There are just no statistics available yet because it ' s a relatively new crime , &quot; Goldstein said . Throughout Southern California , from Long_Beach to Santa Clarita , thieves are stealing the safety devices , which can cost up_to $ 1 # 200 , from cars_parked in driveways , parking_lots and even auto dealerships , police say . In Ventura County , thieves in search of air_bags have robbed the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall twice in the last two months , stealing between eight and 10 of the devices during each robbery , authorities said . &quot; It seems to be a new trend that ' s developing , &quot; said Ventura County Sheriff ' s Sgt . Jerry Weaver . However , the trend apparently has not yet reached parts of west Ventura County . Authorities in Oxnard and Ventura said they could not recall any instances of air_bags being stolen from dealerships or private owners . Thieves also took about 15 air_bags from cars at two auto dealerships in the west San Fernando Valley over the last four months , authorities said . &quot; It ' s exploded , &quot; said LAPD Detective Mike Lewin , describing the popularity among car thieves . &quot; Six months ago you didn ' t even hear about it . Now they ' re going through the roof , &quot; he said . Auto theft detectives in the Van Nuys and North Hollywood divisions report more_than a dozen such thefts in the past month . The air_bags , which inflate rapidly but briefly to cushion the impact on the driver or passengers in crashes at 15 m.p.h. or more , were once installed solely in expensive luxury cars . But as they began to appear as standard equipment in less expensive new cars , the number of thefts rose with them . The market for stolen air_bags seems to be expanding as well . Police suspect that some professional auto thieves are in_league with body shops and workers who want the bags at reduced rates because they need them to complete repairs on cars involved in accidents in which the factory-installed bag inflated . The bags work only once and cannot be reused . Auto dismantlers buy the bags as salvage items with no questions asked , reselling them to repair_shops and home mechanics for about half the cost of a new bag . In the case of a Mercedes or Lexus , the replacement_cost is about $ 1 # 200 , without installation_charges . New bags for other makes run $ 800 to $ 1 # 200 . A body shop worker with a supply of stolen air_bags can pocket the difference between what is paid to the thief -- perhaps about $ 150 -- and the $ 1 # 000 or more that is billed to an insurance_company or car owner for a new bag , Lewin said . The major risk for air_bag thieves is that the devices are activated by a small charge of gunpowder that can be detonated by static_electricity , although there have been no reports of such incidents , said Detective Bob Graybill , who heads the Valley-based Community Effort to Combat Auto Theft , known as CECATS . In tests conducted at an auto theft investigators ' school operated by the LAPD , the bags , when inflated , rocketed up_to 70 feet in the air , Detective Gil Hetrick said . &quot; If it deployed while you had a bottle of soda_pop , it would shove it right through your face , &quot; Hetrick said . &quot; It would be like Mike Tyson hitting you right in the face. &quot; When a motion detector senses the impact of the crash , it detonates a gunpowder-chemical charge , creating a cloud of gas that instantly snaps the balloon-like bag open . Tom Treinen , president of Special Devices Inc. , a Santa Clarita-based maker of the explosive &quot; initiators &quot; that trigger air_bag deployment , agreed , saying the initiators can cause serious injury . &quot; I don ' t know if it would blow your arm off , but it would certainly blow a finger off if you didn ' t know what you were doing , &quot; he said . Treinen also confirmed that static_electricity could , in extreme cases , trigger the initiator . Treinen said his company expects to sell about 7 million of the devices in this fiscal_year , and demand is growing . Investigators say it is next to impossible to find crooked repair_shop operators and prove that they violated the law by receiving stolen goods . But in at least one case , catching the alleged thieves was easy . Lewin was_on the trail of a stolen car ring working in the Valley on Dec . 3 when he noticed three men trying to break_into his unmarked police_car in the parking_lot of the Northridge Fashion Center mall . He arrested them and later discovered that one of the suspects , Sang Van Tran , 35 , of North Hills , was the same man he was looking_for in connection with the theft of five cars that had been resold to unwitting victims after their vehicle identification_numbers were altered . At the time of his arrest , Tran had an air_bag , also thought to be stolen , Lewin said . Lewin matched the serial number of the air_bag with the vehicle identification_number of a car that had been burglarized at a Metrolink parking_lot in the West Valley , one of a dozen from which air_bags had been stolen . Tran , who has been charged with nearly a dozen crimes in two separate cases , is awaiting trial in Los Angeles Superior_Court , Lewin said . The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington , Va. , reports that 91 % of all 1994 vehicle models are equipped with air_bags , according to the Automobile Club of Southern California . The prospect of high profit_margins and such a large market will continue to drive_up air_bag thefts , said Goldstein and Detective J.R. Rolfe , an auto theft investigator at the Police_Department ' s Devonshire Division . &quot; If it ' s in a car and has some value , someone will try and take it , &quot; Rolfe said .
