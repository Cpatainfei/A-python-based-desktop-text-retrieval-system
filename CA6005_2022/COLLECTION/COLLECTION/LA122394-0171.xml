   <HEADLINE> GOLDEN GLOBE NODS A LOT LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES . . . ; AWARDS : ' GUMP ' AND ' PULP ' LEAD FILM NOMINATIONS , WHILE ' FENCES ' TOPS TV LIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; and &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; films that viewed America respectively through contrasting prisms of a simple man ' s remarkable life and hit_men cruising the drug underworld , led the 52nd annual Golden Globe Awards nominations Thursday in Beverly Hills . Director Robert Zemeckis ' &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; which rode a wave of baby_boomer nostalgia to become the fourth-highest-grossing picture of all time with nearly $ 300 million in domestic box-office receipts , grabbed seven Golden Globe nominations -- including best motion_picture drama -- the most for any film . Six nominations , including one for best film drama , went_to director Quentin Tarantino ' s &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; which has been the darling of critics since it won the Palme d ' Or at last spring ' s Cannes Film Festival . The two films now likely will be considered front-runners in the race for the Academy Awards , which will be handed_out on March 27 . ( Nominations will be announced Feb . 14. ) Once scoffed at , the Golden Globes , which are bestowed on feature_films and television_programs , in recent years are taken more seriously by the Hollywood studios since they are often seen as a precursor to Oscar nominations . Other Golden Globe nominations in the best drama category went_to &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; director Robert Redford ' s film about the ' 50s TV quiz show scandals , which recently won the New York Film Critics Circle Award ; &quot; Nell , &quot; director Michael Apted ' s film about a young_woman found in a remote North Carolina cabin who speaks her own language , and director Ed Zwick ' s &quot; Legends of the Fall , &quot; a movie about a Montana rancher whose family is torn_apart over the love of a woman . Both &quot; Nell &quot; and &quot; Legends &quot; are dark_horse candidates . If there was one big surprise omission in this year ' s balloting for best drama it was the critically acclaimed remake &quot; Little Women , &quot; which was totally ignored by the 90 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. , which vote on the Golden Globes . In contrast to the Academy Awards , the Golden Globes also honor musicals and comedies . This year ' s best picture nominees in those categories were &quot; The Adventures of Priscilla : Queen of the Desert , &quot; &quot; Ed Wood , &quot; &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; &quot; The Lion King &quot; and &quot; Ready to Wear ( Pret-a-Porter ) . &quot; The mainstream Disney and its avant-garde subsidiary Miramax Films dominated the Globes , garnering a dozen nominations each . There were two surprises in the best director category : Oliver Stone for his violent black comedy &quot; Natural Born Killers , &quot; the controversial film ' s only nomination , and Ed Zwick , for the sweeping family saga &quot; Legends of the Fall. &quot; Zemeckis , Redford and Tarantino round_out the nominees . Apted was shut_out of the race , though his film was nominated . Best actor drama nominations went_to last year ' s Oscar winner Tom Hanks for his title_role in &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; John Travolta in &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; Morgan Freeman in &quot; The Shawshank Redemption &quot; and Paul Newman in &quot; Nobody ' s Fool. &quot; But few expected to see a nomination for Brad Pitt , who plays a distraught son in &quot; Legends of the Fall. &quot; Three-time Golden Globe winner Meryl Streep was nominated for her role in &quot; The River Wild. &quot; Joining her in the best actress drama category were likely Oscar favorites Jodie Foster in &quot; Nell &quot; and Jessica Lange in &quot; Blue_Sky , &quot; as well as Jennifer Jason Leigh in &quot; Mrs . Parker and the Vicious_Circle , &quot; and Miranda Richardson in &quot; Tom &amp; Viv. &quot; Jim Carrey , who exploded on the big screen with the unexpected hit &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective &quot; and went_on to star in two other hit comedies , was nominated for best actor in a comedy for &quot; The Mask. &quot; Other nominees are Johnny Depp ( &quot; Ed Wood &quot; ) , Hugh Grant ( &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral &quot; ) and Terence Stamp ( &quot; The Adventures of Priscilla : Queen of the Desert &quot; ) . A big surprise vote went_to Arnold Schwarzenegger ( &quot; Junior &quot; ) . In the best actress in a comedy arena , nominees are Jamie Lee Curtis ( &quot; True Lies &quot; ) , Geena Davis ( &quot; Speechless &quot; ) , Andie MacDowell ( &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral &quot; ) , Shirley MacLaine ( &quot; Guarding Tess &quot; ) and Emma Thompson ( &quot; Junior &quot; ) . Samuel L . Jackson , who was overlooked as a best actor ( drama ) nominee as a Bible-quoting hit_man in &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; though his role was largely equal_to Travolta ' s , received a best supporting nod for the movie . He also received a best actor nomination for the HBO prison movie &quot; Against the Wall. &quot; Miranda Richardson was the only other nominee to receive nominations in both film and TV , with a best actress drama bid for &quot; Tom &amp; Viv &quot; and best supporting actress nod for HBO ' s Nazi thriller &quot; Fatherland. &quot; The best supporting nominees for movies also include Martin Landau for his role as Bela Lugosi in &quot; Ed Wood &quot; and Dianne Wiest for &quot; Bullets Over Broadway. &quot; Both have won several critics ' awards for those performances . Among the TV_programs honored with Golden Globe nominations , CBS ' quirky series &quot; Picket_Fences &quot; led with five nominations , including best television series ( drama ) . NBC ' s popular sitcoms &quot; Frasier &quot; and &quot; Seinfeld , &quot; and &quot; The Burning Season , &quot; HBO ' s drama about the Brazilian activist Chico Mendes , followed with four nominations each . Overall , CBS led the pack with 15 nominations , followed by NBC with 14 , ABC with 12 and HBO with 11 . Besides &quot; Picket_Fences , &quot; which has received the Emmy for best dramatic series the past two years , the best television series ( drama ) nominees are &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; the cult fave &quot; The X-Files &quot; and the medical dramas &quot; Chicago Hope &quot; and &quot; ER. &quot; The latter is the highest-rated new show of the season . In addition to &quot; Frasier , &quot; which also won the Emmy this year , and &quot; Seinfeld , &quot; the nominees for best television series ( musical or comedy ) are &quot; Grace Under Fire , &quot; &quot; Home Improvement &quot; and &quot; Mad About You. &quot; The nominees for miniseries or movie made-for-TV are &quot; The Burning Season &quot; ( HBO ) , &quot; Fatherland &quot; ( HBO ) , &quot; The Return of the Native &quot; ( CBS ) , &quot; Roswell &quot; ( Showtime ) and &quot; White Mile &quot; ( HBO ) .
