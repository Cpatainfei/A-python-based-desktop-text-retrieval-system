   <HEADLINE> OUSTED LAWMAKERS TO WALK AWAY WITH HUGE PENSIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thomas S . Foley ( D-Wash. ) , the first House Speaker to lose reelection in a century , heads the list of ousted congressmen who will take huge pensions with them when they leave the capital . With 32 years of government service , Foley is eligible to begin collecting $ 123 # 804 a year starting in January . Most of the more_than three dozen lawmakers rejected on Election_Day are immediately entitled to pensions ranging from about $ 35 # 000 to more_than $ 100 # 000 , according to estimates calculated by the National Taxpayers Union , a Washington-based group that advocates lower government spending and taxes . Qualifying for pensions of $ 96 # 462 a year , according to the group , are : * Former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D-Ill. ) , who awaits trial on public corruption charges . * Rep . Jack Brooks ( D-Tex. ) , upset in his reelection bid after 46 years of government service . * Rep . Neal Smith ( D-Iowa ) , who has 39 years of service . If Foley , Rostenkowski , Smith and Brooks reach their respective ages of life_expectancy -- 80 to 85 -- their four pensions alone will have cost taxpayers nearly $ 9 million , the taxpayers group says . The various congressional plans also have other benefits not available to many Americans . Those include early retirement ages ( as young as 50 ) , fewer years of service to be vested ( usually five ) and a mandatory adjustment for inflation . Most private pension_plans don ' t adjust for inflation . Pension figures aren ' t readily available on Capitol_Hill . But the NTU annually provides its own estimates based on surveys it takes of members of Congress . Lawmakers who declined to provide the information are assumed to be in the main civil_service pension program for the purpose of the estimates , the group said . Big pensions also await some lawmakers who retired , including Robert H . Michel ( R-Ill. ) , who can begin collecting $ 110 # 538 a year in January . On the Senate side , retiring Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) is eligible for an $ 84 # 595 pension beginning in January .</TEXT>
