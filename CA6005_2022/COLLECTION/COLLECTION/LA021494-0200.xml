   <HEADLINE> POLICE FIND WAYS , WORDS TO AID MUGGED TOURIST ; CRIME : A NIGHTMARE THAT BEGAN WHEN A FRENCHMAN GOT LOST IN WILLOWBROOK HAS A HAPPY ENDING . HE SAYS HE WOULD BE WILLING TO VISIT LOS ANGELES AGAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Willowbrook at 11 p.m. is not a common tourist destination . But that ' s where Michel Poipou found himself meandering when he got_off a bus that he belatedly figured_out was not headed toward Los Angeles International Airport . Before he knew it , the_French tourist was in a chokehold , bashed in the face and relieved of his money , his traveling bag and his plane_ticket by two thugs , police said Sunday . The officers who arrived_at Figueroa Avenue and 152nd Street on Saturday night found that the disoriented traveler spoke no English . They called_on Officer John Zambri , who had studied French in hopes of taking a European vacation , to help_out . Zambri and his partner , Officer Auston Price , spent the next 12 hours ferrying the penniless Poipou , 39 , to the airport and fighting the airline bureaucracy to make_sure he got a ticket , explaining to the Northwest Airlines staff the gory details of why Poipou couldn ' t pay the $ 50 lost-ticket fee . Meanwhile , Steve Gardner of Silver Lake -- a teacher of French -- heard of Poipou ' s problems on the radio Sunday . Determined that Poipou not leave without some more pleasant Los Angeles experiences , Gardner called the police and offered to put Poipou up and show him around . But the Frenchman said that although he appreciated the offer , he ' d take a rain_check and catch his flight home . So Zambri and Price walked Poipou to his Northwest flight at Terminal 2 -- his passport safely in his sock , as it had been throughout the ordeal -- and said goodby . &quot; He ' s pretty happy , &quot; said Price . &quot; We made_sure he was comfortable and told him he could rest assured he ' d be welcomed back and taken_care of here. &quot; Zambri said the success of their night ' s work showed in Poipou ' s parting words : &quot; He said he had no reservations about coming back. &quot;</TEXT>
