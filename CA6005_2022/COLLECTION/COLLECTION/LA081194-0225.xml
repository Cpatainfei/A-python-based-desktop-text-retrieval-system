   <HEADLINE> ARGENTINE JEWS START RECOVERY FROM TRAGEDY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is with pain that 92-year-old Samuel Rollansky thinks_of rebuilding . The bomb that ripped through the heart of Argentina ' s Jewish community not only killed almost 100 people -- it also destroyed Rollansky ' s lifework , one of the world ' s most precious collections of Jewish historical books and papers . &quot; As Jews , we are accustomed to having to start over , &quot; he said quietly , cradling a volume of &quot; Master Works of Yiddish Literature , &quot; which he published more_than 30 years ago . &quot; It is an obligation . As the poet H . Levick said : ' I fall , I get_up . I fall again , I get_up again. ' It is not a matter of ' Can we rebuild ? ' but that we must. &quot; Even as the government on Wednesday issued its first arrest_warrants in the case , the largest Jewish community in Latin_America was beginning to emerge from the shock and despair that engulfed it after a car_bomb on July 18 destroyed the Buenos Aires headquarters of the community ' s social_services . And as Argentina ' s Jews look_to the long process of recovery , they are assessing the permanent psychological damage , fears and uncertainties . In these post-crisis assessments , some Argentine Jews speak with new bitterness . They watch in dismay as non-Jewish Argentines take their children out of schools near Jewish offices . They see new outbreaks of an anti-Semitism that , one way or another , has long existed in Argentina . And they feel a growing apprehension that the investigation into the bombing will never turn_up those truly responsible , leaving open the possibility of another attack . &quot; Terror not only managed to kill 100 people , wound 200 and leave a crater in the middle of the city , &quot; said Ruben Beraja , a banker and community leader . &quot; Terror also managed to install a certain amount of fear . The spirit and color of the city has been changed . Look , ( many ) days have passed ( since the bombing ) and we are still trapped by trauma and shock. &quot; There are outward signs of recovery . The frenetic pace has slowed at the Marc Chagall Cultural Center , which became a makeshift command_post for teams of counselors and rescue workers and where some 500 relatives awaited tragic news during the first days after the explosion . The ruins of the seven-story building -- the terrorists ' target -- have been mostly cleared_away . All but 10 victims have been identified and buried ; DNA testing is expected to give names to the last 10 . With the help of Israeli experts , Jewish schools are instructing their teachers to incorporate the bombing into their curricula , and enhanced security now means leaving cellular_telephones and electronic date books at the front desks of many synagogues . &quot; The pain is enormous , &quot; said Enrique Klein , a publicist who was badly hurt in the 1992 car-bombing of Buenos Aires ' Israeli Embassy , which almost killed his wife . &quot; But that doesn ' t mean you cross your arms . You have to keep fighting. &quot; Jews fleeing pogroms and prejudice began migrating to distant Argentina from Russia and Europe in the latter half of the 19th Century , colonizing vast , vacant pampas as farmers and merchants . By 1882 , the first rabbi was recognized by the government ; by 1898 , three newspapers were being published in Yiddish . The Jewish exiles ' first rural colony was called &quot; Moisesville &quot; -- Moises is Spanish for Moses -- and populated by thousands of Jewish gauchos , or cowboys . Descendants of the first Jewish settlers became part of Argentina ' s prosperous middle_class . Many Jews today , despite Argentina ' s persistent current of anti-Semitism , hold prominent positions in government and business . The community numbers about 250 # 000 , having declined in recent years because of migration to Israel and the United States . This history was meticulously detailed in the largest library of Judaica in Latin_America , a compilation of 70 # 000 books , diaries , original birth and death certificates and other papers housed under the Jewish Scientific Institute and founded by Rollansky . Many of the priceless works were destroyed in the bombing . &quot; I have lived to see my own funeral , &quot; Rollansky tearfully told reporters on July 18 . Later , in an interview at his apartment in the center of the Once neighborhood , established as Buenos Aires ' first Jewish ghetto at the turn_of_the_century , Rollansky recalled how he began collecting the materials after his immigration to Argentina from Poland in 1926 . Among the items housed in the library and archives were original , irreplaceable works of 16th- and 17th-Century literature , 19th-Century Hebrew magazines , phonographic recordings of Jewish tango stars , files documenting the Jewish immigration to South_America , World_War_II memorabilia , a model of a Nazi concentration camp.. &quot; A diabolical bomb , placed by diabolical people , destroyed some of the most peaceful and noble work imaginable , &quot; Rollansky said . Many Jews fear that one of the lasting aftereffects of the bombing will be a new_wave of subtle and not-so-subtle anti-Semitism . They cringed at hearing people refer to the &quot; innocent victims &quot; of the bombing -- the non-Jewish passersby or workers . Parents have reportedly withdrawn 50 children from La Salle Catholic_school across the street from the Chagall Center in the last week ; fearful residents have staged protest rallies over the possible location of an Egyptian Embassy in their neighborhood . &quot; We have seen the best , and the worst , come_out , &quot; said Edgardo Knopoff , 32 , a psychoanalyst . &quot; There have been expressions of solidarity and support , and there has been discrimination . Sometimes this kind of ( overt ) fear exacerbates a fear that is latent in society. &quot; Knopoff and others blame the bombing , in part , on the &quot; country ' s sickness. &quot; They say a government that has not done enough to eradicate anti-Semitism , and a society that tolerates extremist hatreds and prejudice , helped to create a climate that permits attacks on Jews . Although an Islamic fundamentalist group claimed responsibility , the 1992 embassy bombing was never fully resolved , and no one was ever arrested . Despite assurances from President Carlos Saul Menem that this time will be different , and the government taking concrete steps_in the prosecution of the case Wednesday , many Argentines have their doubts . &quot; We took the first case as isolated , &quot; said Fabian Triskier , 30 , a psychiatrist . &quot; Now we are convinced a third attack could come. &quot; Triskier , Knopoff and psychologist Alejandro Stilerman , 36 , are members of a volunteer health team that has worked practically around the clock to counsel victims of the bombing and the relatives of the dead . With the crisis easing , they were able to take time to sit_down and speak_to a reporter last week . Smoking furiously , the three said the bombing and its consequences have forced them to re-examine their own religious commitment . Knopoff said he had not been to synagogue in 10 years . &quot; Now , &quot; he said , &quot; I don ' t know . I want to analyze this. &quot; The counselors said they found poignant solace from another ugly chapter of recent Argentine history : Argentines who lost children or other relatives in the &quot; dirty war &quot; gave words of comfort and advice . That war was a campaign of terror by the_Argentine military and fascist groups in the late 1970s and early ' 80s that killed thousands of dissidents , students and others . The earliest major incident of anti-Jewish violence in Buenos Aires was recorded in January , 1919 , when angry mobs denouncing &quot; Bolshevism &quot; hunted_down and beat Jews , looted Jewish-owned businesses and burned two Jewish libraries . The Semana Tragica ( Tragic Week ) left a toll of one dead and 71 injured , Ricardo Feierstein said in his 1993 book , &quot; Historia de los Judios Argentinos. &quot; The mobs were led , Feierstein said , by the sons of some of Argentina ' s wealthiest families , who wanted to protect their vision of a national identity -- conservative and Roman_Catholic -- that the Jews , portrayed as foreigners and leftists , threatened . Jews continued to be attacked in the decades that followed , especially under the government of Gen . Juan Peron , who welcomed Nazi fugitives to Argentina after World_War_II . As recently as January of this year , the chief rabbi of Buenos Aires , Salomon Benhamu , was beaten by a gang on his way to synagogue .</TEXT>
