   <HEADLINE> BANNED CHEMICALS FOUND ON SHIP WITH CARGO FROM CHINA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A ship carrying cargo from China to the Middle_East was recently inspected and found to contain illegal chemicals used for making dangerous weapons , U.S. officials acknowledged Friday . The ship Asian Senator , which is of German origin , was examined at a Saudi_Arabian port in a new demonstration of the intensified U.S. and international campaign to stop the spread of deadly weapons and chemicals . The episode is likely to touch_off an exhaustive effort to determine who was responsible_for arranging the sale of the chemicals -- a Chinese manufacturer , the shipper , the purchaser or a third-party intermediary . The officials emphasized that the ship itself was not Chinese and that there is no indication at this point that Chinese authorities were responsible_for , or even aware of , the shipment . The Chinese Embassy in Washington had no immediate comment . &quot; The Chinese cooperated fully in the investigation , and they agreed that what was found was not good stuff , &quot; one State_Department official said . International agreements prohibit the export of a number of chemicals that can be used to manufacture nuclear , chemical and biological weapons and missiles . U.S. officials did not specify Friday exactly what chemicals were found , but they said there was no doubt that the export of the chemicals was a violation . According to some sources , the ship was carrying the chemicals to Iraq . State_Department officials say that fact has not been confirmed . If Iraq was in fact the destination , the shipment would be in violation of the U.N. sanctions against Saddam Hussein , and any countries found responsible could be called before the U.N. Security_Council . The new incident is reminiscent_of the episode last summer in which American_planes and warships for weeks tracked a Chinese ship , the Yin He , which U.S. intelligence officials believed was carrying chemical-weapons ingredients from China to Iran . But there are important differences between the two cases . The earlier incident involved a Chinese ship carrying a Chinese cargo . The Chinese government complained angrily that there were no dangerous chemicals aboard the Yin He , and those protests led to a nasty diplomatic confrontation with the United States . In the end , an inspection of the Yin He at a Saudi_Arabian port turned_up no evidence of any chemical weapons precursors . This time , U.S. officials said , there was no diplomatic confrontation between American and Chinese authorities . And the inspection in Saudi_Arabia this time was said to have turned_up solid evidence of the dangerous chemicals . It was not immediately known Friday how or why the German ship was required to submit to the inspection at the Saudi port . U.S. intelligence officials have made_it clear that they are monitoring the shipments of chemicals , weapons and technology from China to the Middle_East . According to U.S. officials , the Asian Senator is one of a number of ships owned by Germany ' s Senator lines . Although the ships are used primarily to transport cargo , some also rent_out luxury cabins for small numbers of passengers who want the experience of traveling the world by freighter . A 1992 description of the Asian Senator ' s facilities in the New York Times Travel section proclaimed : &quot; Capacity five passengers , outdoor pool , international cuisine with German specialties , one sitting. &quot; For the fee of $ 7 # 960 , the ship offered an 84-night cruise . The officials said the Asian Senator has some &quot; space-sharing &quot; arrangements to trade open space and cargoes with other ships from Germany and from South_Korea -- thus raising the possibility that the owners of the Asian Senator may have taken_on the chemical shipments from someone else at the last minute and without knowing what was in the cargo . The ship made a number of stops on the way to the Middle_East . According to sources familiar_with the investigation of the incident , the Asian Senator stopped at the South_Korean port of Pusan on Nov . 28 , in Hong Kong on Dec . 3 , in Singapore on Dec . 7 and in Saudi_Arabia on Dec . 18 . Over the last seven years , exports of dangerous weapons and materials from China to the Middle_East have been one of the most sensitive and divisive issues between Washington and Beijing . The issue first arose in 1987 , when the Ronald Reagan_Administration complained bitterly that China was selling Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher is preparing to meet Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Paris on Monday in the latest of a series of high-level contacts between the Clinton_Administration and the Chinese government .</TEXT>
