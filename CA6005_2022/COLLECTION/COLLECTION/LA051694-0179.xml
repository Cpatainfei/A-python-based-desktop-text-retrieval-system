   <HEADLINE> WORK_FORCE DIVERSITY ; TEST YOUR DIVERSITY IQ</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here ' s a chance to test your diversity-etiquette IQ by matching your answers against those of our experts in this multiple-choice test . Not everyone will agree with the answers our experts have provided . Clearly , there often is no right or wrong answer . Still , we offer this tentative road map to the evolving new manners of the workplace . 1 . A woman in your office is very private about her personal life . You suspect she ' s a lesbian , but you want her to know that ' s OK with you . So you : * A . Tell a_few lesbian jokes to provoke comment * B . Invite her out for a drink to talk_about it * C . Mind your own business The answer is C . She has every right to keep her personal life as private as she wants to , and many lesbian and gay_men in the workplace have reason to be fearful of their sexual orientation becoming known . However , if you are supportive and she ' s ready to talk_about it , she will . You cannot force the issue . As for the other two choices , the first option could be construed as harassment , and inviting her out for a drink might also be construed as sexual_harassment , whether you ' re a man or a woman . 2 . Your male boss has taped a photo of a scantily_clad woman from a lingerie catalogue on the wall of his office cubicle . Each time you confer_with him , you are forced to see this photo , which you find inappropriate for the workplace . What do you do ? * A . Put_up a Chippendale ' s male dancer poster * B . Talk to him about it * C . Talk to his supervisor about it The answer is B . Our experts recommend using the most informal method initially . You might say , &quot; That photo makes me uncomfortable , and I ' d appreciate it if you took it down. &quot; If talking individually to him doesn ' t work , you could ask him to meet with a group of women co-workers to show that you are not the only one who finds the picture offensive . Do not post your own poster ; you do not want to escalate the situation by stooping_to his level . 3 . You are an executive in a medium-sized company . Lately you have been hearing a lot of grumbling and complaints about Susan , a mid-level manager . After some investigation , it becomes apparent that Susan is not doing her job , although there ' s no smoking gun that would allow you to fire her immediately . Plus , you have another problem : Your company needs to show that its management ranks include a certain percentage of women and minorities , and Susan is both . Still , you are increasingly worried about flagging morale . What do you do ? * A . Fire Susan * B . Ignore the situation ; eventually it will go_away * C . Explain to the staff why firing Susan would cause a problem * D . Talk with Susan The answer is D . In fact , our experts say not talking with Susan on a regular basis could have caused the problem in the first place . Part of your job includes providing employees with feedback about how to improve their performance . As a boss , you have a responsibility to develop her talents and communicate with her regularly so things don ' t degenerate to_the_point where you have to fire her . However , if after talking and coaching Susan , you conclude that she is still not performing up_to company standards , fire her and document it . Otherwise , you would be supporting an incompetent_person to the detriment of everyone . 4 . You are a white male . Several new positions have been created at your company , but the informal buzz is that they are being reserved for &quot; a certain type of person. &quot; You want to apply but fear that you are not the right color or gender . How do you handle the situation ? * A . You ask your boss whether you should apply * B . You let it slide and complain to your colleagues in private that white_men just don ' t stand a chance at this place * C . You apply The answer is A . Our experts advise being as direct and upfront as possible in this situation . Tell your boss you are interested in the position but that you have heard the job may be reserved . Then ask whether it ' s appropriate for you to apply . If you have a good boss , he or she will be honest in answering . The boss has a responsibility to tell you whether the job is reserved and why . The boss may tell you , &quot; We need a person of that gender or race in this company because we realize we need different points_of_view and voices as we make our business decisions. &quot; 5 . You are a woman working in a mostly male office . You feel shut_out of social interactions with your colleagues and bosses because the men cluster together at every opportunity to discuss sports . You couldn ' t be more bored by the topic , but you realize you are missing important opportunities to schmooze and bond socially with higher-ups . You also have a nagging feeling they are doing this to exclude you . You should : * A . Seethe silently * B . Bone_up on sports so you can take_part in this important ritual * C . Say something The answer is C . You don ' t want to stop men from enjoying their sports confabs , but you also want to feel included and to reap the benefits of these informal relationships . You might say , &quot; Hey , I ' m really not interested in sports , but I ' d like to be included in conversations , so can we find some_other topic in common that we can discuss ? &quot; The trick is not to imply that the men are behaving badly , which will only alienate them , but to make_it clear what your needs are and that you want to feel included . 6 . You work with a person_of_color . You like this person and want to become more friendly but feel awkward in conversation . You ' re not sure how to refer to him or her . As a black ? African American ? Nor are you sure how to refer to Mexican Americans . By that term or Hispanic ? Chicano ? Latino ? What is the appropriate and sensitive way to proceed ? * A . You play it safe and avoid the topic * B . You float a term like a trial_balloon and wait for the person ' s reaction * C . You ask the person what he or she would like to be called The answer is C . The reason you feel uncomfortable is because in our society we think it ' s inappropriate to introduce and discuss such topics . You might tell your colleague that while you feel awkward about being so blunt , you are bringing_up the subject so you can learn . This sets the tone for further communication and dialogue . 7 . You are Japanese American . Your boss and some of her colleagues are discussing where to go_for lunch . They want Chinese food . Your boss sees you and exclaims happily , &quot; Let ' s ask May ! She ' ll know. &quot; You : * A . Say , &quot; Why don ' t we ask a Chinese American person ; I ' m Japanese American. &quot; * B . Make an ethnic_joke * C . Say , &quot; How would I know ? &quot; The answer is A . Don ' t assume your boss is a racist , but don ' t let it pass unregarded . Take the middle ground . Try to engage your boss in a conversation that will educate her . 8 . You ' re walking into your office_building when you see someone who is apparently partially paralyzed struggling to open the door . You : * A . Rush up and hold the door open * B . Stand_back and wait for the person or go_to another door to avoid the situation * C . Ask if the person would like help The answer is C . Don ' t make any assumptions -- ask instead . When people see someone with a disability , they often assume they don ' t have to ask_for permission to help . But that is condescending . However uncomfortable it may be , ask first . 9 . You are a black female manager . Yesterday you were having lunch in a restaurant with a colleague when you overheard a conversation between Brad , one of your young , white , male employees , and his lunch companion . Brad was complaining vehemently about the lack of opportunity for white_men in your group . He said all_the recent promotions have gone either to women or people_of_color , and he threatened to see an attorney because he believes he is a victim of reverse discrimination . What do you do ? * A . Stop by Brad ' s table on the way_out to say hello * B . Ignore what you heard because Brad was_on his own time * C . Enroll Brad in the company ' s next diversity training workshop * D . Talk to Brad about what you heard The answer is D and possibly C . Although it might be easier to ignore what you heard , the situation should be handled in a more direct way . Talk to Brad and explain that you inadvertently overheard his conversation and ask him to share more of his thoughts and opinions with you . Many white_men today feel &quot; out of the loop &quot; and passed_over for promotions . Some also fail to see women and people_of_color as individuals , instead focusing_on them as representatives of groups that are taking something away from them because of affirmative_action programs or government intervention . In your talk , try to help Brad explore why he ' s not being promoted and others are . Also try to help him realize that he is still valued as a member of your staff . It is your job to help Brad see that diversity is a workplace reality that will not go_away . You could send Brad to a diversity training course , but this should not be seen as a punishment , and it must be reinforced by discussions before , during and after the training . 10 . You ' re a male employee who ' s receiving love notes from a female co-worker . She wears low cut blouses , leans over your desk , brushes_up against you whenever she gets a chance . Everyone in the office thinks it ' s a joke , including your boss , but you ' re not laughing . You ' ve already told her to stop , but she won ' t . What should you do ? * A . Complain to a co-worker and find a way to retaliate * B . Go_to your boss , even though he thinks the whole_thing is a joke * C . File an EEOC complaint The answer is B . You need to go_through your direct supervisor first , even if he thinks it ' s a joke . You should also put your complaints in writing so there will be a paper trail . Your complaint will then have to make its way up the ladder through the company . It is necessary to follow the chain of command and exhaust in-house remedies before seeking outside action . 11 . Maria is a Latina being interviewed for a corporate position . She feels the interview is going well . As it winds down , Maria ' s prospective boss says : &quot; Gee , I really admire your ambition . It must have been tough for you to leave your roots behind in_order to succeed in the business world. &quot; How should Maria respond ? * A . Let it pass , fearing that if she calls him on his racist comment , she won ' t get the job * B . Make a snide comment back * C . Regardless of whether Maria gets the job , she should remind him of what he said and explain why she found it upsetting The answer is C . Whether Maria gets the job or not , she should tell her interviewer afterward that she was offended . Of course , this is a measured risk . Sometimes , when unpleasant comments are made , one has to ask : &quot; Is this a battle I want to fight ? &quot; You can win the war , but you can ' t win every battle . On the other hand , Maria may decide she doesn ' t want to work_at a company where people feel free to make such comments . 12 . You are a woman who regularly attends management meetings that are dominated by men . One of the men has a penchant for telling sexist jokes . He thinks they ' re funny ; you find them offensive . What should you do ? * A . Say nothing and hope it doesn ' t happen again , but secretly prepare your own sexist jokes aimed at men * B . Boycott the meetings * C . Challenge the man and his joke . Say , &quot; I don ' t believe this is happening in this room and I find it offensive. &quot; * D . Go_to the boss There are several ways to handle this common office problem . One choice is C , challenging the joke teller . However , our experts say that if the man persists_in telling such jokes , complaining to the boss is the next step . 13 . You supervise a group that is composed of three-person teams . Today , one of your white employees came_in to talk to you about two other team members . She says they frequently speak Spanish when the three of them are working together and she feels left_out . She also thinks they are talking_about her . She wants you to stop them from speaking Spanish during working hours . You : * A . Tell her you think she ' s overreacting * B . Have a group meeting and talk to all_of your employees about the issue * C . Agree to the employee ' s request and issue a written memo saying that only English will be spoken in the workplace * D . Talk to the three people involved The answer is D and possibly B . Although you cannot stop the two employees from speaking their native language , you can talk_about the impact of speaking in a language that other team members don ' t understand . It would also be helpful to determine if there ' s a valid reason for their choosing to speak Spanish on_the_job . Often , employees find it more convenient to communicate work problems in the language they are most comfortable with . If these employees are not fluent in English , perhaps you should provide language training . The white employee ' s complaint is not unusual . She feels left_out and assumes that the other two people are talking_about her . You should make_it clear that you are not forbidding the employees to speak in their native language , but rather asking them to include her and be sensitive to her feelings . 14 . John is a 30-year-old black_man who has worked in your group for three years . He has an MBA from one of the best business_schools in the country and is one of your top performers . An opportunity for a promotion just came_up in the corporate office , and you recommended John for the job . A colleague in the corporate office has other thoughts . Although he is complimentary of John ' s work , he doesn ' t feel John is &quot; right for the job. &quot; The problem is that John is viewed_as arrogant and cocky . Further , John ruffled a_few feathers when he challenged the company president about his commitment to diversity during an open forum meeting . Your colleague said he would interview John but offered little hope that John would get the job . He even hinted that you ' d be jeopardizing your own career by sponsoring John . What should you do ? * A . Sponsor John for the position and let him take his chances during the interview * B . Heed your colleague ' s warning . After all , you don ' t want to put your career in jeopardy * C . Sponsor John but give him some coaching before the interview The answer is C . You should give John as much help as possible in assessing whether this is the right job for him , as well as in preparing_for the interview . It would probably be inappropriate for you to share what your colleague said , but it might be useful to give John feedback on how some people perceive him . Part of a manager ' s job is to support their employees and act_as sponsors or mentors , which often involves giving feedback based on subjective information . You should be prepared to talk to John about your own view of his work and his behavior . Assessment of someone ' s self-confidence is often based on other feelings we have about the person . Minority men have complained that their self-confidence is perceived as arrogance , while the same trait is viewed more positively in their white colleagues . If you feel John ' s self-confidence is unnecessarily inflated and unseemly , he needs to hear this and have the opportunity to improve . 15 . You are a corporate manager interviewing applicants for a marketing job that would include some travel and putting_on seminars . One of the applicants , Mel , uses a wheelchair . You have concerns about whether his disability would interfere with the job requirements . You want to bring_up the subject but aren ' t sure how to handle it . You : * A . Level with Mel , telling him that despite his qualifications , you worry that his disability will affect his ability to do the job * B . Ignore the issue , thank Mel and put his application in the circular_file * C . Ask Mel to describe how he would handle the job on a daily basis The answer is C . With reasonable accommodation , 90 % of all jobs can be done_by 90 % of all working-age people with disabilities . Chances are that if Mel is qualified , his disability will pose no problem . You should focus_on Mel ' s experience , qualifications and ability to do the job , not his disability . But don ' t be afraid to discuss in an open , straightforward manner how he would approach his job duties and what accommodations , if any , might be necessary . Under the federal Americans With Disabilities Act , answer B would constitute discrimination . Answer A could be discriminatory .
