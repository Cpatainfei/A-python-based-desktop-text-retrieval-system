   <HEADLINE> DISNEY ' S FILM FORMULA STARTING TO LOSE MAGIC ; NEWS ANALYSIS : HIGH CONCEPT , LOW BUDGET WAS WORKING , BUT LATELY BOX-OFFICE RECEIPTS HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSINGLY LOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The movies all seem to have catchy titles with easy-to-understand themes . &quot; Blank_Check &quot; : A lonely 11-year-old boy &quot; cashes_in &quot; on an opportunity to become very popular when an impatient crook runs_over his three-speed bike and absent-mindedly leaves a blank_check to cover the damage . The boy boldly fills_in the check for $ 1 million . &quot; My Father the Hero &quot; : A vacationing , love-struck 14-year-old girl concocts a scheme to pass her father off as her lover in_order to impress the boy of her dreams . &quot; The Air Up There &quot; : A college coach travels_to Africa to woo a 7-foot tribal member to play American basketball , and then dons tribal paint and takes_part in a full-court game against other African players in a contest fraught with consequences . So high concept . So low budget . So Disney . For years , Disney has proudly adhered to a philosophy that differs from many other Hollywood studios . Make high-concept movies on relatively small budgets , keep talent costs down , advertise like crazy , then flood the marketplace with product week after week . If it fails , there are always video and other ancillary markets . &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; and &quot; Aladdin &quot; may have stirred audiences with their brilliant animation and delightful tunes , reaping hundreds of millions of dollars for the Disney empire , but more often than not over the last year the Walt Disney Co . in Burbank has continued to churn_out a steady stream of forgettable movies : &quot; Cabin_Boy , &quot; &quot; Aspen Extreme , &quot; &quot; Life With Mikey , &quot; &quot; Father Hood , &quot; &quot; Born Yesterday , &quot; &quot; Swing Kids , &quot; &quot; Super Mario Bros. , &quot; &quot; Blame It on the Bellboy. &quot; Critics winced and audiences didn ' t show_up . Over the past couple of years , Disney ' s philosophy has generated handsome profits with such live-action films as &quot; Cool Runnings , &quot; a film about a Jamaican bobsled team at the Olympics that grossed more_than $ 65 million ; &quot; The Hand That Rocks the Cradle , &quot; a 1992 nanny-from-hell movie produced for pittance ( $ 87 million ) , and Whoopi Goldberg ' s comedy &quot; Sister Act &quot; ( $ 140 million ) . Even some of Disney ' s live-action family films such_as &quot; Homeward Bound &quot; ( $ 42 million ) were very profitable relative to cost . But , often Disney ' s low-ball strategy has backfired at the box_office . Nowhere has this been more apparent than at the studio ' s Hollywood Pictures division , which saw box-office receipts for many of its movies remain embarrassingly low . Formed in 1988 , Hollywood Pictures has long been the source of conjecture in the film_industry . Until this week , it had been headed by Ricardo Mestres , a close friend of studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg and his boss , chairman Michael Eisner , since the days a decade ago when all three worked_at Paramount Pictures . On Tuesday , Mestres was forced_out after one lackluster film after another . Mestres took the fall publicly , even though it is widely known that Katzenberg and Eisner sign_off on virtually all movies that flow_from Hollywood Pictures , as well as its sister divisions , Touchstone Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures . Many wondered why Katzenberg had waited so_long to act , but sources said his Achilles ' heel had always been that he liked Mestres too_much , was too loyal to simply dump him . Sources confirm that it was Eisner who last week abruptly mandated the resignation of Mestres . Ending months of speculation , Mestres relinquished his stripes and accepted a long-term production deal with the studio . * While a successor was not immediately named , the supposed front-runner for the job is a non-movie executive from Disney ' s Hyperion Books named Michael Lynnton , a close friend of Touchstone president David Hoberman . Hoberman is poised to be appointed head of all three movie divisions under Katzenberg . But in the wake of Mestres ' departure , questions that have dogged the studio for years have resurfaced . Is Disney pursuing profitability above good filmmaking ? And , has Disney become creatively stifled because of its tightfisted cost controls and overbearing management style ? Executives at Disney argue that management has already begun to rethink its strategy and make changes . They point to such upcoming products as the Julia Roberts / Nick Nolte romantic action movie &quot; I Love Trouble &quot; ; Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia in &quot; When a Man Loves a Woman &quot; ; and the Robert Redford directed &quot; Quiz Show. &quot; In an attempt to diversify its product and boost its creative output , Disney has brought into the fold some respected moviemakers , including former 20th Century Fox chairman Joe Roth , the filmmaking team of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory , and bought the independent New York-based Miramax Films , best known for releasing such unconventional fare as &quot; The Crying Game &quot; and &quot; The Piano. &quot; Upset with criticism about primarily making mindless movies , one high-level Disney executive said , &quot; Well_over a year ago we made adjustments and are doing a more balanced program of movies . . . . This event ( Mestres ' departure ) has nothing to do with any of that. &quot; But others say Hollywood Pictures is a good_example of why Katzenberg ' s system needed altering . &quot; What ' s happened is that Disney had an idea to do high-concept , low-budget movies , &quot; said entertainment lawyer Peter Dekom . &quot; On the whole , that concept hasn ' t performed . The movie business is a business of balance . High-concept has its place , but so do other kinds of movies. &quot; * It also hasn ' t escaped Wall_Street ' s attention that what is driving Disney ' s film studio is its animated product , not live-action films . &quot; Profitability , in large measure , is coming_out of their animated film product , &quot; analyst Jeffrey Logsdon said recently . &quot; When you get right down to statistics , about 15 % of their revenues on film entertainment side come_out of live-action features , their non-animated product . That gets_down to a really uninspiring number . But they ' ve always been driven that way . It ' s not as if that ' s some big revelation. &quot; Some who have worked in the Disney system contend that too many studio executives exerting control over projects has stifled creativity . &quot; There are too many cooks to spoil the broth , &quot; said one producer who made movies for Hollywood Pictures . &quot; Too many executives telling you how to change this and that. &quot;</TEXT>
