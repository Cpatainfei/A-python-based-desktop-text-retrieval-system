   <HEADLINE> U.S. CONSIDERS ALLOWING SALES OF RUSSIAN HANDGUNS ; TRADE : OFFICIALS SAY LETTING MOSCOW EXPORT WEAPONS TO AMERICA COULD HELP END KREMLIN ' S ARMS DEALS WITH IRAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bowing to Russia ' s desperate need for export earnings , the Clinton_Administration is moving toward a decision to let Moscow sell a famous Russian product in the United States : handguns . As a result , the Makarov semiautomatic_pistol , favorite side_arm of KGB spies and Cold_War bad_guys , may soon come_to a gun store near you . A U.S. gun importer has filed an application to sell as_many as 7 million Russian firearms in the United States , and the Administration is leaning toward approving at least part of the deal , officials said Tuesday . The decision is still being debated between the Treasury_Department ' s Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , which is hesitant to open U.S. gates to more inexpensive gun imports , and the State_Department , which wants to give visiting Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin a break . The Administration has been putting major pressure on Yeltsin to stop selling submarines , tanks and high-tech weapons to Iran -- and some U.S. officials see the low-tech handgun deal as a reasonable substitute . &quot; If we want them to listen to us on issues like Iran , we have to let them compete on the world market with products they can sell , &quot; a State_Department official said . But he acknowledged the irony of the Administration , which has argued for stricter gun_control at_home , now advocating bringing Russian guns into the country . &quot; A lot of people think it ' s nutty to start importing Russian handguns , &quot; he said . The likely outcome , he said , will be &quot; a common-sense solution &quot; -- one that lets the Russians sell some weapons without flooding the American market . An official at the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , which regulates arms imports , confirmed that the issue was under discussion but refused to provide details . But other officials said the importer ' s initial application had been for a whopping 7 million guns -- half of them handguns -- and billions of rounds of ammunition . That would be almost three times the number of firearms imported into the United States in 1992 , the last year for which the ATF has statistics . But the actual number of Russian guns imported would probably be much smaller , as importers routinely file applications for far more items than they really expect to sell . The total number of guns in the United States in 1992 was about 212 million , including nearly 72 million handguns . Russia ' s state-owned arms industry has found itself awash in surplus guns since the collapse of the Soviet_Union and the shrinkage of Russia ' s armed forces from more_than 5 million to fewer than 2 million troops . Because of that oversupply , the Russian imports would almost surely sell for less than comparable U.S.-made guns . The 9-millimeter Makarov pistol , for example , already sells in limited numbers in the United States for about $ 150 ; large-scale imports would drive the price down . Moreover , there may be a market opening for low-priced Russian handguns since the Administration restricted firearms imports from China earlier this year . China shipped hundreds of thousands of pistols , assault_rifles and other guns to the United States beginning in the mid-1980s , but Clinton virtually stopped the trade earlier this year . The United States also imports large_numbers of guns from Austria , Belgium , Brazil , Canada , the Czech Republic , Germany and Italy . During the Cold_War , virtually all Russian guns were barred from the United States under import regulations that remain in_effect . But importers can apply to the ATF and State_Department for specific licenses . Officials at both the ATF and State_Department refused to identify the dealer who has applied for the license under_consideration . But they did say that the application does not include the AK-47 assault_rifle , whose import was banned by a law passed earlier this year .</TEXT>
