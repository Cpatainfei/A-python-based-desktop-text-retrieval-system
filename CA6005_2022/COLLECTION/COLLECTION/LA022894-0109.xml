   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : VENTURA ; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER CUTTING 2 BUS_LINES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Ventura City_Council today will consider cutting bus_service from the Buenaventura Mall to Ventura Harbor and from Ventura to Ojai because of the high cost of subsidizing the rarely used routes . City Transportation Engineer Nazir Lalani said too few people use the two bus_lines , which cost the city nearly $ 150 # 000 a year to operate.The fares from the Ojai bus_line make_up about 4 % of its costs , and the fares from the mall bus_line make_up about 8 % of its costs , he said , adding that the city ' s goal is to subsidize 80 % of a bus_line ' s operation . &quot; It ' s cheaper to pay people cab_fare , &quot; Lalani said . If the council decides to cut the service , the South Coast Area Transit board of directors must also give final approval in April , Lalani said . Bus_service would be eliminated July 1 . In a related action , the council is expected to recommend that SCAT officials limit the purchase of buses next year and put_together a five-year financial plan that evaluates how much it would cost to implement accommodations for the disabled called_for under the American with Disabilities Act .
