   <HEADLINE> CREATORS OF PROP . 187 LARGELY ESCAPE SPOTLIGHT ; BALLOT : FROM SECRET O.C. LOCATION , POLITICAL NOVICES AND VETERANS SPAWN STRONG DRIVE AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like other political neophytes who banded_together last autumn for an all-out war against illegal immigration , Ronald Stephen Prince had a story to tell -- a tale that would inspire the statewide &quot; Save Our State &quot; campaign . His bitter account would become a campaign refrain : an illegal Canadian immigrant bilked him out of $ 500 # 000 in a construction project , and the judicial_system offered no recourse . But it ' s also an account sharply disputed by court records and the Canadian himself , who has lived_in the United States legally for almost 33 years . Frustrated , this obscure , enigmatic Tustin accountant stood_in front of a Vons supermarket with a clipboard and pen in_hand , hoping to whip_up public sentiment against illegal immigrants . Eventually , he would become one of the key leaders of the SOS campaign . Though the sweeping initiative and its prickly package of immigration reforms has unleashed powerful emotions on all sides , its founders at the California Coalition for Immigration Reform have labored in political anonymity , escaping the celebrity and scrutiny that often focuses_on the authors of controversial ballot initiatives with far-reaching consequences . A handful of political beginners and seasoned veterans have cobbled_together a powerful volunteer movement from a statewide campaign headquarters in Orange County that is a secret location even to some of the leaders . Some of the key players are citizens like Prince who are avenging injustices they believe were committed against them at the hands of illegal immigrants . Others believe illegal immigration has unfairly drained American tax dollars . Still others with the same agenda also will reap financial benefits from the campaign . Although the campaign has been touted as a volunteer effort , at least three of the organizers have billed the SOS campaign for tens of thousands of dollars for political consulting services . Alan C . Nelson , the former head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and a co-author of the initiative , is owed $ 26 # 500 for his work , according to campaign finance reports . Two other consultants , who have themselves petitioned for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 , also have received more_than $ 35 # 000 through June for managing the campaign and reimbursement of expenses , according to financial disclosure statements filed by the SOS committee . The consultants , Robert Kiley and his wife , Barbara -- the mayor of Yorba Linda -- are owed an additional $ 51 # 000 for their work . The Kileys hosted the first strategy session that spawned the initiative , which would deny education , non-emergency health_care and other public benefits to illegal immigrants . The measure , Proposition 187 , faces a vote on Nov . 8 . When they all met last Oct . 5 at a posh , members-only Center Club in Costa Mesa , the future SOS leadership knew little about each other except that they shared the same contempt for illegal immigrants , a group some scorned in their newsletters for the &quot; stench of urination , defecation , narcotics , savagery and death. &quot; The 10-member group -- which included Assemblyman Richard L . Mountjoy ( R-Arcadia ) -- recognized that it lacked money and a statewide political organization . But it had the determination to do something more active than -- as one participant , a newsletter publisher , put it -- &quot; wring hands . . . and drink tea. &quot; They debated the issue for the entire day , settling_on a strategy proposed by a political unknown , Prince : a statewide petition drive for an initiative to end public_services to illegal immigrants . A few weeks later , they would pick the name SOS -- like the international distress_signal -- for their campaign while dining on Mexican food at a restaurant in Orange . &quot; Ron set everything up , &quot; recalled Barbara Coe , co-chairwoman of the coalition , who had a network of political contacts that Prince sorely lacked . &quot; It was all his idea . He said , ' If you people will pick_up the ball , I will run with it. ' &quot; * For someone who has placed himself directly at the forefront of the state ' s most controversial ballot initiative , Prince has proved a private man . At 46 , the campaign co-chairman guards details about his personal life more zealously than the location of the SOS headquarters , which is a closely held secret because the leaders fear retaliation from their opponents . Prince , who says he is a fifth-generation Californian , politely refuses to say where he was born ( Long_Beach ) , where he resides ( Tustin or Downey , according to government_agency records ) , prefers not to divulge his middle name ( Stephen ) , or to disclose his place of employment . He is an accountant who used to work for his family ' s business in Downey , but now spends most of his workdays and weekends at the Tustin campaign office . Why so private ? &quot; Because of the repeated threats we have gotten , especially when it ' s directed at me , &quot; Prince says without elaborating . His SOS co-chair , Coe , says she recently received a dollar_bill with a bullet_hole drawn_on George_Washington ' s forehead and drops of red-ink streaming down his face . She said the handwritten message on the bill read : &quot; Beware of Prince and Coe. &quot; His reticence to discuss his background contrasts starkly with his smooth debating style during private and public forums on the illegal immigration issue . Appearing cool and aloof at times , the volume and pace of his speech quickens only slightly as he defends the initiative against a coalition of opponents made_up of civil_rights activists , Roman_Catholic_church leaders , teachers and others . So devoted was Prince to the movement that he donated $ 2 # 000 to get the SOS campaign off the ground late last year , and then loaned another $ 20 # 000 in May , according to campaign finance reports . &quot; Where the heck did he get the money ? &quot; asked William Baker , Prince ' s former attorney who has a keen interest in his income . Baker obtained a court judgment against Prince -- that as of July totaled $ 9 # 643 -- after the accountant refused to pay the lawyer for defending him in the legal dispute involving a Canadian citizen who Prince contends defrauded him in a construction project . In a statement obtained by Baker last year , Prince said he was unemployed and had no assets . During the course of that case , Prince dropped Baker as his attorney and filed with the secretary_of_state an unsuccessful proposal for an initiative measure that called_for every member of the State Bar to be re-examined every four years . Prince said recently the events were unrelated . Prince ' s fight with his attorney was but a minor skirmish in the larger court battle between Prince and his former friend , Leonard Thomas Chornomud , 59 , a Tustin auto garage owner and -- INS records show -- a legal Canadian immigrant . Although Chornomud had no construction experience , both informally agreed in 1984 to finance and build an addition to Chornomud ' s Tustin home . They later expanded their oral agreement to include construction of a home for Prince . Prince told a bankruptcy judge that he entered both projects to learn new steel-construction techniques possibly for future business ventures . The partnership ended six years later , with each man accusing the other of fraud , according to court documents . The pair slapped each other with lawsuits and countersuits in state and federal_courts , but even the attorneys for both sides and the judge conceded that the deal -- born_out of friendship -- was too messy to assign blame . Perplexed by Prince ' s contention that he had contributed about $ 70 # 000 for the projects , bankruptcy court Judge James N . Barr pointedly asked from the bench during an October , 1991 , hearing why Prince gave the money . Prince replied : &quot; I am a nice guy , I am a good friend . I trusted Leonard and Gloria Chornomud . Gloria ( who legally emigrated from Nicaragua ) had gone_on at great length about how honorable Spanish_people were and that they could be trusted , and I believed her , because that has also been my experience in the past. &quot; Although Prince would later allege he had lost about $ 500 # 000 as a result of his dealings with Chornomud -- the bankruptcy court case documented only $ 70 # 000 -- he settled for a $ 32 # 000 payment from Chornomud that ended the case in May , 1993 . Chornomud , meanwhile , contends to have lost even more . A San Francisco Examiner article about the initiative published in June told of Prince being &quot; defrauded by a Canadian citizen living here illegally , and ( Prince ) said he and others never would have lost money if this country took its immigration laws seriously. &quot; &quot; It ' s totally false , &quot; says Chornomud in anger . &quot; Our country is in_trouble because of men like him . Our country is what it is today because of immigrants . It ' s the immigrants that worked harder than any other group. &quot; Last week , Prince refused to discuss Chornomud . At first , he contended Chornomud told him he was an illegal immigrant . But then later , he said Chornomud was not the illegal immigrant he had referred to in previous newspaper interviews . Was it possible that there could be another Canadian citizen who had allegedly bilked him out of a half-million dollars in a construction project ? &quot; I am not going_to tell you who it was , &quot; said Prince . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s pertinent. &quot; Prince argued that the news media had paid too_much attention to his anecdote . The impetus for the campaign , he added , was not his story , but &quot; the stories of all_of the people I have talked to &quot; who alleged they have been harmed by illegal immigrants . * If Prince is the philosopher of the movement , then Barbara A . Coe is its general . When SOS formed last fall , the new coalition ended_up relying_on the extensive contacts of Coe , 60 , a diminutive , chain-smoking woman with an apocalyptic vision of the world that is all exclamation_points and question_marks . From her home_in Huntington Beach , she presides over an active political network tied together by the passionate prose of her newsletter , &quot; 911. &quot; An Oklahoma native , Coe is a late-blooming political scrapper and mother of three who has contributed more_than $ 15 # 000 to the SOS campaign . Coe works as a crime analyst for the Anaheim Police_Department -- a job that will end in December in_forced retirement . Gina Beitler , a representative of the Anaheim Municipal Employees Assn. , said she helped Coe in her effort to save her job . Beitler said Coe came under_fire within the department after she used a city Polaroid_camera to snap a picture of striking dry wallers who were picketing police_headquarters . Many of the strikers were illegal immigrants , primarily Mexican nationals . Coe , who declined to comment on her job , complained to friends that she is being forced_out because her immigration-reform activities interfered with her work . Her political baptism came just three years ago when she went_to an Orange County social_services office to smooth_out a dispute involving an elderly war veteran ' s public health benefits . The frantic scene in the lobby startled her , reminding her of the United Nations , she said . Coe noticed windows open_to serve Spanish- and Vietnamese-speaking clients but said the single one available for English-speaking applicants was closed . &quot; I walked in and I ' m going , ' Where am I ? ' &quot; Coe recalled . &quot; There were hundreds of people ; I thought I was at UCI maternity ward -- vast numbers were very pregnant . There was every language under the sun being spoken , and I am going , ' What ' s happening ? ' &quot; A welfare agency employee offered some answers and sympathy . Coe listened_in dismay as the counselor complained that illegal immigrants were able to obtain the same services that were denied to Coe ' s elderly friend . &quot; I went ballistic , &quot; said Coe , whose rage led her to other immigration-reform groups that she found weak and powerless . So Coe and a former INS border agent , Bill King , decided to form a group with more muscle . They placed a brief advertisement in a free newspaper announcing a Costa Mesa meeting of &quot; everyone concerned about the illegal aliens problem. &quot; &quot; We made a big pot of coffee , crossed our fingers and waited , &quot; Coe said . To her surprise , almost 40 people showed_up to listen to the featured speaker , none other_than the same government worker who had complained to Coe about illegal immigrants . From those grass-roots beginnings , Coe and King formed Citizens for Action Now , joining with other groups worried about illegal immigration . That loose web of connections ultimately brought Prince and Coe together last fall , to form the California coalition for Immigration Reform . &quot; We clicked , &quot; laughed Coe . &quot; He said , ' I ' ve heard about you. ' I said , ' I hope it ' s good and if it isn ' t , it ' s a lie. ' &quot; * If Prince and Coe were the muscle behind the movement , then the stars in the beginning were two former top INS officials . Nelson and Harold Ezell , who were known for their controversial styles at the INS , are credited with co-authoring the initiative . They lost their top positions in the INS in 1989 several months after George_Bush took_office and accepted their letters of resignation , which are routinely submitted by top appointed officials to a new President . Campaign records show that Nelson was paid $ 26 # 000 for his early work_on the initiative , although he says he has not received the money . Nelson , a Sacramento-based lobbyist , and Ezell , of Newport Beach , say they have actually eased out of the day-to-day SOS campaign to form a national group of_their_own called Americans Against Illegal Immigration , which was organized after the SOS campaign was underway . &quot; My feeling is that there needs to be a lot of groups that are picking_up this issue ( nationally ) and running with it , &quot; said Ezell . So distant are they from the current campaign , that Ezell says he has no idea where the SOS headquarters is . However , both men continue to stump for the cause on radio shows and public forums . In their prior jobs with the INS , they proved to be masters at preaching the gospel of immigration reform . Ezell became known for his affinity for television_cameras and microphones -- sometimes holding as_many as six news conferences a week during his six-year stint . But Latino immigrant rights activists pressed for his resignation , and some Republican Administration officials also considered him an embarrassment . In 1988 , while the Justice_Department was investigating deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos , Ezell danced with Imelda Marcos at a party hosted by the couple , and led a prayer asking_for the exiled couple ' s safe return to the Philippines . Like Ezell , Nelson stirred controversy as INS commissioner . He produced a film touting his accomplishments in an effort to save his job but ultimately was ousted in 1989 after a seven-year stint . Part of his undoing was an audit by the Justice_Department , which criticized the INS_for inefficiency . Nelson constantly engaged in battle with immigrant rights groups and drew fire when the INS planned to construct a four-mile ditch at the San Diego border . Even before the SOS committee organized , Nelson was already a high-profile lobbyist for the cause through a consulting contract he had with Federation for American Immigration Reform . However , the group allowed the contract to expire late last year out of concern that Nelson ' s political activities might threaten its nonprofit status . * Robert and Barbara Kiley are , by trade , political hired guns . But this is the first time they have managed a high-profile statewide initiative campaign . Leaders say the campaign is strictly volunteer . However , the Kileys ' political consulting business has received more_than $ 35 # 000 during the first six months of the campaign for management services , commissions and overhead , according to campaign finance records . The firm is owed another $ 51 # 000 for the Kileys ' services . &quot; We ' ve taken commissions but haven ' t taken any salary , &quot; said Robert Kiley , who added that they may_not be paid the money still owed to them if more money does not come_into the campaign . In all , the campaign raised $ 335 # 923 through the end of June , with expenditures totaling $ 406 # 319 . Those expenses included $ 115 # 000 paid to professional signature gatherers , American Petition Consultants of Rancho Cordova . They are owed another $ 38 # 506 for that effort . Once the petition drive was underway late last year , the Kileys reported to bankruptcy court that they had new , unspecified business clients . Instead of being forced to liquidate their assets , the Kileys asked to convert their case from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13 , which would let them pay_off creditors with their new income . Unlike Prince and Coe , who came_to the fight with personal stories , Robert Kiley said his involvement does not stem from any first-hand experiences with immigrants . &quot; I believe_in this issue . This was not a thing about money , basically we believe_in the issue . We ' re consultants and we like to be paid , but that ' s not what this is about , &quot; said Robert Kiley . He said tax money is being wasted on illegal immigrants . &quot; As a tax-paying citizen , I ' m feeling pinches like everyone else , &quot; Robert Kiley said . While unaccustomed to controversial statewide campaigns , they are not new_to political clashes . Robert Kiley , a former member of President Reagan ' s advance team , last year helped defeat a Newport Beach measure backed by environmentalists which would have taxed property_owners to buy three bluff-top properties for open space preservation . Barbara Kiley , as a Yorba Linda council_member , became the mayor last year by forming a coalition that denied the office to the next councilman in_line . Now they are in the biggest political fight of their careers . Robert Kiley wonders whether the measure , if approved by voters , will face legal challenges . But at least , he said , they have accomplished their initial goal -- to call attention to illegal immigration . &quot; What we wanted to do , &quot; Robert Kiley said , &quot; is wake_up the Legislature. &quot; Times staff writer Matt Lait contributed to this report . * IMPACT OF PROP . 187 : Experts cite pros and cons of statewide initiative . A24 What Proposition Would Do An initiative on the Nov . 8 ballot , if approved , would prohibit people who are not in this country legally from receiving educational , health and social_services . Here ' s what the proposition would do : * Prohibit public education for undocumented immigrants . * Halt non-emergency public health_care to undocumented immigrants . * Prohibit public social_services to undocumented immigrants . * Require health_care facilities , educators , social_service agencies and law_enforcement officers to report suspected undocumented immigrants to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and other authorities . * Order school districts to verify immigration , residency or citizenship status of all students and parents or guardians of students . * Require public colleges and universities to verify the legal residency or citizenship status of all students enrolled after Jan . 1 , 1995 . * Make forging , counterfeiting , distributing or selling citizenship and INS documents a state crime , punishable by five years in prison or a fine of as much as $ 75 # 000 .
