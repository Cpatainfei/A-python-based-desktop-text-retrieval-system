   <TEXT> The temperature had climbed above 90 degrees , but Tressa , a slender 20-year-old woman sitting on a park_bench outside the Staten Island Ferry Terminal , was wearing five layers of clothing . The holes in her jeans were stuffed with cardboard . Her shoes were wrapped in silver duct tape . She had occupied the same bench every day , all day , for the last five months . A psychiatrist and a nurse , members of an outreach organization called Project Help , were trying one last time to persuade her to enter the Bellevue Hospital Center psychiatric ward voluntarily . Eyes wide with fear , Tressa refused , as she had for five months . &quot; There ' s a time and place for everything , &quot; she told them . &quot; Even though I ' m just sitting here , I certainly hope I ' m not drifting from reality . I have a strong_belief in God . He has always let me know when the right moment comes. &quot; Within hours , Tressa became part of a quiet but significant change in the way American society is dealing with the mentally_ill , especially those who are indigent and resist treatment . Invoking special authority recently granted to health_professionals , a Project Help psychiatrist took Tressa to Bellevue , despite her pleas to be left alone in the tiny triangle park where she felt safe . For more_than three decades beginning in the 1950s , government policy , medical opinion and the law lined_up together to enforce strict limits on the conditions under which such involuntary commitments could occur . But today , the situation is changing : Under pressure from the public , from relatives of mental patients and from the medical_community , the strict prohibitions against involuntary commitment are being reconsidered and several states have already relaxed their standards for involuntary treatment . This has made_it easier to commit mental patients -- especially the indigent -- whether they agree or not . &quot; The pendulum is starting to swing back , &quot; said E . Fuller Torrey , a clinical and research psychiatrist based in Washington who is a leading voice in support of involuntary treatment . &quot; None of us are saying it should go_back to where it was in the 1920s or ' 30s . But we ' re definitely going_back in the direction where you will be able to get people in the hospital who need treatment. &quot; Most jurisdictions still permit involuntary commitment only for people with severe mental_illnesses -- schizophrenia , manic-depression and major depression -- and only when they pose a danger to themselves or others -- the standard set_in the 1950s during the movement away from involuntary commitments . Recently , however , some states -- including , Arizona , Hawaii , Oklahoma , Delaware , South Carolina and Iowa -- have modified those criteria , allowing courts to order involuntary commitment based on other factors , including psychiatric history and potential emotional injury to a family . In effect , the new rules permit authorities to act where the need for treatment is very clear and individuals are unable to make a decision for themselves . In part , the change is being driven by neighborhood groups and citizens who are frightened by -- or fed up with -- the growing numbers of homeless mentally_ill people in their communities . The balance between the rights of society and the rights of individuals is out of kilter , these groups contend . Moreover , relatives and friends of mentally_ill people who refuse treatment are banding_together to pressure lawmakers . Consigning such people to live_on the streets , eat_out of trash_cans and suffer without care or medication -- all_in the name of protecting their civil_liberties -- is perverse , they argue . &quot; In the name of civil_rights they are denying people like my son the human_right to live , &quot; said a 70-year-old engineer whose 40-year-old son has suffered from schizophrenia for 17 years and has lived for years on the streets of New York because he denies that he is_sick and refuses to take medicine . &quot; When my son is psychotic , he ' s an animal . He can ' t decide what is best for him , &quot; his father says . Families tell of being unable to get treatment for their loved ones , no matter how clearly psychotic , until they have crossed the line into violent behavior . Slicing one ' s scalp , pulling one ' s hair out or hurting another person are among the examples cited by relatives . Desperate to get help , family members say , they sometimes lie to authorities , claiming that violent acts have already occurred . Adding_to the pressure from neighbors and families is the fact that doctors have new tools for alleviating the problems of serious mental_illness . &quot; This comes at a time when we have a new generation of anti-psychotic drugs that are more effective and have fewer side_effects , &quot; said Robert Levy , the Project Help psychiatrist who decided to treat Tressa . &quot; It ' s much more humane to give these people treatment. &quot; The movement to abolish involuntary commitment , a common practice throughout most of the nation ' s history , began partly as a result of public horror over the &quot; snake pit &quot; conditions that existed in many mental_institutions during the first_half of this century . It also reflected the difficulty in justifying mandatory commitment on medical grounds when the care patients received was little more_than custodial and seldom made them better . Patients could be treated as well or more effectively in community-based mental_health centers , reform-minded doctors argued . Also , large-scale commitment was expensive ; emptying the huge mental_hospitals that existed in every state appealed_to voters who , then as now , thirsted for tax relief . Civil liberties groups mounted a series of successful court challenges to the old system . All across the country , the idea that individuals had an almost absolute right to refuse treatment began to replace the idea that a benevolent state had an obligation to treat those who were seriously mentally_ill , even if they objected . From 1955 to 1992 , the number of people in mental_institutions plummeted from 559 # 000 to 90 # 000 . Now , as the tide of opinion swings back , civil_liberties advocates and some legal_experts warn that changing the laws could result in denying individuals their constitutional rights or overburden the inadequate services available for helping the mentally_ill . Government officials also warn that financial resources are not available to expand services . &quot; Broadening the commitment laws is bad in terms of policy and bad in terms of constitutional principles , &quot; said John Parry , chief_of_staff of the American Bar Assn. ' s Commission on Mental and Physical Disability Law . &quot; The gut reaction is to solve the problem of homeless mentally_ill by putting people back in institutions , instead of providing a more humane life for these people , &quot; he said . &quot; But given the resources that we have and given what institutions are able to do , it is not a good idea to put more people into institutions. &quot; Many mentally_ill people who have been involuntarily treated in the past are also worried about changing commitment standards . &quot; I see this as heading down a slippery slope of losing our rights , &quot; said Charlie Rodican , 51 , of New York , who has been treated for mental_illness through most of his adult life but has been stable for several years . &quot; I think people have a right to choose whether they should be treated. &quot; Some mentally_ill people and civil libertarians are banding_together to speak out against broadening standards for involuntary treatment . They repeat horror stories of patients being abused by insensitive orderlies and argue that the risks of treating people against their will outweigh the benefits . Dorothy Purnell , for one , does not see it that way . A 43-year-old former homeless crack addict who suffers from schizophrenia , Purnell was diagnosed as mentally_ill as a child in Savannah , Ga. , but for more_than three decades denied she was_sick . &quot; My shoes used to talk to me , &quot; Purnell said in an interview , referring to the first time her parents committed her when she was a child . &quot; that ' s when they involuntarily committed me . I was mad at them for putting me into the hospital , because I felt_like it was fine that my shoes were talking to me. &quot; She refused to take medication unless she was hospitalized -- and she hated hospitals . She ended_up living_on the streets of New York -- smoking crack , sleeping_in subway cars or train_stations and eating_out of garbage bins . Several times , the police took her to emergency_rooms , but because she was not violent they had no legal grounds to treat her against her will . &quot; I thought , I ' m not going there with crazy people because I ' m not crazy , &quot; she recalled . On one cold night three years ago , Purnell took refuge in a shelter . A social_worker was unusually attentive and , for the first time in many years , Purnell took medication . &quot; She would watch me take it , &quot; Purnell said . &quot; I had to open my mouth to show I had swallowed it . It was involuntary treatment , but a good kind of involuntary because it helped to stabilize me and it was done with kindness. &quot; Now that she is stable , Purnell wishes the laws had been different . &quot; I would like for someone to have committed me to the hospital , because I was not_able to care_for myself , &quot; Purnell said . &quot; Intervention would have helped a lot . There are a lot of people out there who have problems with reality who could be helped through involuntary intervention. &quot; For the first time in decades , she is in close contact with her family . She has discovered grandchildren she did not know . And she is attending college on a scholarship . She just started a job as a counselor at a halfway house associated with the program that helped her . Specialists estimate that 30 % to 40 % of the people living_on the streets or in homeless shelters suffer from severe mental_illness . Most get no medication or treatment , in large part because -- like Purnell -- they are afraid of hospitals or insist that they are not sick . One sign of the increasing public determination to do something about the problem was a decision this summer by the New York state Legislature to expand the state ' s authority to compel mentally_ill people with a history of hospitalization to take medication or attend counseling on an outpatient basis . If the patients refuse , they can be recommitted . Civil libertarians , conceding that public views had changed so_much that they could not defeat the proposals , opted not to fight . Instead they helped draft the legislative language . &quot; It ' s inconceivable that five years ago it would have passed , &quot; Torrey said . &quot; The fact that they passed that law without opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union is a significant indication of how far things have come. &quot; Robert Levy , who for a long_time was the New York Civil Liberties Union ' s expert on the issue , contended that the new law is not a sign of a trend but a reaction to a specific , highly publicized case involving a homeless , schizophrenic crack addict named Larry Hogue who menaced an Upper West_Side Manhattan street for years . Hogue had a long history of involuntary commitments . He was often picked_up by police . Sometimes he was released in days , sometimes within months . When discharged , he would stop taking his medication , start smoking crack and return to setting fires , grabbing passing schoolchildren and hurling himself into traffic . In one especially horrendous episode , he pushed a teen-ager in front of a truck . Fortunately , the driver swerved the vehicle in time , avoiding a tragedy . The cycle stopped when he was involuntarily committed for a longer term to a state hospital on the grounds that he was likely to abuse crack and become dangerous . &quot; Sometimes exceptional cases tend to drive legislation , &quot; Levy said . &quot; I think there ' s a great tension between the forces of liberty and the forces of benevolence . For the last seven or eight years there has been a lot of pressure to cut_back on the constitutional liberties that had been recognized in the 1970s and 1980s , &quot; he said . Advocates of greater freedom to impose involuntary commitment see the issue not as a matter of civil_liberties but of effective medical treatment and balanced social_policy . &quot; The Hogue court finding as a precedent was a very important one , &quot; conceded Zebulon Taintor , a professor at New York University , a practicing psychiatrist and the president of the U.S. branch of the World Assn . for Psychosocial Rehabilitation . But he added : &quot; Involuntary treatment is often a necessary first_step to getting people involved in treatment. &quot; Besides , he said , &quot; we think untreated mental_illness gives all mental_illness a bad name. &quot; Families of mentally_ill homeless have argued that they should be trusted to advise authorities when someone is psychotic and needs treatment . Every time the family of Victoria Jacobs Madeira sought involuntary treatment for her , authorities in California said that the Anaheim woman showed no signs of endangering herself or others , because she was finding food and shelter -- even though she got her food from Dumpsters and she and her then-11-year-old son lived_in a parking_lot . Like many people with mental_illness , Madeira did not recognize her illness and refused treatment . One day in 1990 , Madeira dressed her son in girl ' s clothes and makeup , took a taxi 75 miles to her parents ' home and stabbed and shot her 78-year-old mother . &quot; She did not fit the criteria ( for treatment ) until she murdered my mother-in-law , &quot; said Carla Jacobs , who is crusading to change the commitment laws in California . &quot; Waiting for danger is too late. &quot; Jacobs said that her sister-in-law ' s case illustrates the absurdity of the claim that the law protects individuals ' constitutionally enshrined liberty . &quot; The laws give civil_rights to the psychosis rather than human_rights to the person , &quot; she said . After being arrested , Madeira bounced from a mental_hospital to jail , where she refused medication and was found incompetent to stand trial , then back to the hospital . She finally was committed to a state mental_hospital . California ' s 1967 Lanterman-Petris-Short Act , which prevents involuntary commitment of those not deemed to be dangerous to themselves , was a pioneering step_in the nationwide transformation of mental_health laws during the period in which it was passed , and all attempts to change it failed . But Jacobs said that he believes public_opinion is changing . She and other advocates plan to launch another attack on the law during the next session of the California Legislature . Still , even those who advocate more flexibility in commitment laws acknowledge that it is a difficult issue , that there can be a downside to involuntary treatment and that no single strategy is best for all cases . Liz Ramsey , the mother of a 31-year-old mentally_ill woman , lobbied strongly and successfully for broadening the standard in Arizona and used the new criterion of &quot; persistently and acutely disabled &quot; to get treatment for her daughter at what she believes was a critical moment : &quot; She had not done anything to me . She had said she wanted to kill me with a knife . But she did not have a knife , so that was not enough to show she was dangerous . But we were able to show by her previous records that she had been helped by being in the hospital and receiving treatment , so they hospitalized her. &quot; But she understands clearly the perils of forcing treatment . &quot; Broadening the standard to those who are persistently and acutely disabled is as far a step as we can go_to take_away someone ' s civil_rights , &quot; she said . &quot; Taking someone ' s civil_rights away creates a trauma that the person will never get over. &quot; Her daughter ' s words still echo in her memory : &quot; You have taken_away my life , Mom. &quot; On balance , however , Ramsey said that she believes she and her daughter are better_off now . &quot; The way it was , she said , &quot; you had to have someone hurt themselves or someone else &quot; before you could get help .</TEXT>
