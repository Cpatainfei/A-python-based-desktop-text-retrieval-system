   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE TURNS ON THE GAS FROM LANDFILL TO POWER HOMES ; WASTE : EXPERTS SAY METHANE-TO-ENERGY SYSTEMS HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND CAN GENERATE A PROFIT FOR AGENCIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the turn of a valve Friday , gas created by garbage rotting at a local landfill was used to generate enough electricity for 30 # 000 homes_in Glendale . It sounds like an environmentalist ' s dream , but the process is becoming a reality for municipalities across the country . Eight such systems are being used at landfills and power_plants throughout Los Angeles County , according to sanitation officials . The county ' s landfill system is_on the verge of a crisis as the capacity to hold solid waste diminishes . Diverting landfill gas toward power_plants will do little to improve the condition of dumping grounds , officials with the Sanitary Districts of Los Angeles County say . But many agree that gas-to-energy systems are good for the environment and can sometimes generate a profit for participating agencies . &quot; It ' s a win-win-win all_the way around , &quot; John Cosulich , a supervising engineer with the sanitation agency . Methane and carbon_dioxide gas naturally emitted by decomposing trash at the Scholl Canyon Landfill is collected , treated , compressed and dehydrated with equipment at the site of the $ 10-million project in Glendale . It is transported to the city ' s power_plant 5 1 / 2 miles away through an underground pipeline . When it reaches the Grayson Power_Plant , the gas is blended with more methane and used to fuel the boilers that produce electrical_power . On Friday , Glendale Mayor Eileen Givens smashed a champagne bottle against an above-ground portion of the pipeline and turned a large valve that ushered the landfill gas into the power_plant . &quot; We come_together to publicly dedicate this pipeline , &quot; she said Friday . &quot; My city colleagues would want me to say , ' It ' s been a real gas. ' &quot; Virtually everyone involved with the project -- city officials , the developer , homeowners and officials with the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County -- expects to benefit . Over 20 years , Glendale officials anticipate revenues and savings of $ 40 million stemming partly from less money spent on gas needed to operate the power_plant . The project ' s developer , Palmer Capital Corp . of Massachusetts , will sell the treated gas to the city for at least $ 330 # 000 a month , a discount of 12.5 % from what the city spent for natural_gas . The Scholl Canyon Landfill collects about 2 # 000 tons of garbage a day from Glendale , Pasadena , Sierra Madre , San Marino and unincorporated parts of Los Angeles County .</TEXT>
