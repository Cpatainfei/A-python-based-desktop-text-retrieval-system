   <HEADLINE> ETHICAL TREMORS IN WORLD OF SCIENCE ; PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY ALARMED BY REPORTS OF DISHONESTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nothing is quite so corrosive of science as reports of fraud and misconduct by scientists . One expects cheating and thievery in business , where the object is to make money , but not in science , where the ultimate reward , ostensibly , is finding the truth . But there have been so many allegations of scientific dishonesty lately that the_British journal Nature observed that &quot; outsiders can be forgiven for believing that science is not the honourable profession it pretends to be , but a mafia in which rival gangs scheme to win the credit for intellectual innovation. &quot; The reports have damaged the credibility of science in Congress , which recently set_up a special commission to examine the integrity of research supported by the U.S. Public Health Service . The time has come for the scientific community to drop its defensiveness on this issue . It must help determine whether misdeeds are isolated events or signs of a wider problem driven by underlying institutional pressures to publish , succeed and win research grants from the government in a highly competitive environment . CANCER-TEST SCANDALS : Leaders of science assert that fraud is rare and that , in any case , the process is self-correcting because other scientists ultimately will discover the error when trying to replicate the work . But the steady flow of reports of alleged cheating is disconcerting . Earlier this year the National Institutes of Health were jolted by reports that some researchers had compromised a breast_cancer study by including ineligible subjects . More recently , the agency has been looking_into whether data was altered in a study of ocular cancer . Scientific misconduct ranges from outright fabrication and plagiarism and the sabotage of others ' work to the more ethically ambiguous acts of overinterpreting data to claim priority for an unproven idea or not giving sufficient credit to others . One hoary practice that should be dropped immediately is the use of &quot; honorary &quot; authorship by which a senior researcher puts his name on publications of disciples or co-workers even though he had nothing to do with the research and cannot defend it . We suspect that instances of gross fraud are rare , if only because such cases are so easy to detect . When physicists at the University of Utah falsely claimed to have achieved nuclear_fusion at room_temperature in 1989 , the conclusion was quickly debunked because it was so improbable . Probably the wider problem is that of fudging and shaving , the seemingly innocent corner-cutting that could pollute the scientific literature for years and is very hard to detect . The problem is that there is little hard data on the true prevalence of misconduct . Five years ago Dr. Drummond Rennie , a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco , stirred a storm by proposing an experiment by which publications on clinical research would be checked to see whether they conformed_to the raw data . PUSH FOR SPOT CHECKS : That idea has been taken_up by some members of the new Commission on Research Integrity , and is expected to come_up at the commission ' s meeting in Washington Dec . 1 and 2 . Under it , journals that publish original clinical research would require that scientists submit to random , confidential spot checks of their records . Such audits of drug research by the Food and Drug Administration suggest that the incidence of misrepresentation and sloppiness is not small . Outright deception in applying for or using federal grant money is grounds for criminal prosecution . But federal agencies cannot police the scientific community . That responsibility lies mainly with universities and hospitals . Staffs must be monitored better and institutions must examine themselves , asking whether they have put such emphasis on publication as a condition for tenure and promotions that the very scientific truths they seek to advance are compromised .</TEXT>
