   <HEADLINE> LOVE IN THE TRENCHES ; CONJUGAL BLISS : A COMEDY OF THE MARTIAL ARTS , BY JOHN NICHOLS ( HENRY HOLT : $ 22.50 ; 304 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> John Nichols ' new novel bears the fortunate subtitle , &quot; A Comedy of the Martial Arts &quot; ( with a transposition mark in &quot; Martial &quot; between the &quot; t &quot; and the &quot; i &quot; ) , and this wordplay is a kind of truth in advertising for this novel is a broad marital comedy and it is_full of the kind of play and sense_of_humor that we know is the often the true sense in his work . Nichols , who has treated politics and the environment and the obvious ironies of our social order with his ebullient , sometimes zany wit in his other novels , takes_on marriage here , specifically the ill-fated matrimonial tempest of Roger and Zelda . Roger , a moderately successful science_fiction writer , was moderately happy in his laid back bachelorhood . He had a series of lovers , ( longstanding relationships really ) , an ex wife , a dog , two grown children , a gang of friends , a resident spider ( Big Al ) , a book and screen contract , in other words , a life . He ' s a nice guy who actually tells us he thinks life is a bowl of cherries . Into this bowl comes Zelda , a woman we come_to see who has no particular propinquity to moderation . Her physical attributes -- which are catalogued at every opportunity in this rambunctious , episodic story ( and which are frequently accompanied by stimulating footwear ) -- seem to be the libidinous manager that unmoor lusty Roger , leading him to abandon his carefree days and enter the wholly agitated state of matrimony . At first , of course , there is honeymoon , a bonding of cosmic proportions that bodes a life of productive , trusting bliss if not sex , with short breaks to work_on his writing . His current Sidney Bard thriller &quot; Perseid Meteor Thugs &quot; is_well under way . With his blessing , Zelda move_into his house and starts her own novel . Their days are spent writing , loving , not in that order , and then eating hors d ' oeuvres and having libations in the early evening the way we were meant to in the garden_of_Eden , here a small_town in what we imagine might be New Mexico . Then things begin to shift . She cleans his house . Big Al bites the dust . An irreverent photograph of his children comes_down . Up goes her credo written_on a napkin and framed : &quot; I always win. &quot; Roger has as his most salient characteristic , after his relish of all things sexual , an easy-going generosity . He doesn ' t care about winning : He cares about keeping the peace and fostering the opportunity for sexual_congress . He rolls with the punches . And a great_deal of this novel chronicles her punches and his rolling . Zelda notes , &quot; I ' m like Pancho Villa . . . . I ' m fearless , I never learned how to retreat . I was born to attack. &quot; The attacks concern : the mail , his former lovers , his ex-wife , nomenclature for sexual_congress , the hypothetical if-I-die argument , a balloon ride , table manners and the children . Roger seems blindsided by each , dumbstruck , certainly struck , and he tries ( oh how he tries ) to accommodate his charming wife ' s demands . The skirmishes escalate as does the wear_and_tear on Roger . Some of these battles are broadly comic , some assume more heft . Roger ' s former lover Gretel is dying of cancer , and Zelda ' s jealously seems beyond understanding . Many moments test our patience with Roger and his great willingness to bend over backward when Zelda is clearly in the wrong . Roger drops his old friends , changes his customs and even denounces his own children to avoid her wrath . He falls impossibly behind on his book . There ' s a funny argument when he offers Zelda the compliment of being his muse and she takes offense that she might have inspired the dreck he writes ! The big tip_off on Zelda for me came when she practiced mime in the garden , her face painted white with two big red dots on her cheeks . that ' s over the top for anybody anywhere . . . . The writing itself in this novel ( which Nichols calls a &quot; sleazy piece of fiction &quot; in the dedication ) most reminds us of Roger ' s behavior : it feels profligate . Roger himself is &quot; known in some circles as the Speedie Gonzales of sci-fi. &quot; A_few of his friends call it &quot; the blam method of writing. &quot; I ' m not sure if Nichols used the blam method for &quot; Conjugal Bliss , &quot; but there are times when he seems to be writing with a grin , having more fun than we are . At other times , splashes of this book are reminiscent_of the quirky juxtapositions of Richard Brautigan . Consider this coupling : &quot; Then Zelda climbed all_over me like Joe DiMaggio on his 56-game hitting streak , delightfully immortal and unstoppable. &quot; And later these two one-line paragraphs : &quot; I could kiss Zelda the way raindrops cling_to a leaf &quot; and &quot; I could touch her intimate places like Michelangelo ' s ' Pieta. ' &quot; Four friends witness them fight &quot; like monkeys watching the atomic bombing of_their_own private banana plantation. &quot; Nichols also gives us Zelda ' s friend , the nutty Weezy Bednarik , who spies on Roger constantly but only communicates through a parrot hand_puppet ( which comes_to a timely end ) and Roger ' s ungainly son Woody , a &quot; dysfunctional Yeti &quot; who resembles Sid Vicious playing &quot; Quasimodo down on his luck. &quot; Nichols also has a romp with the synopses of Zelda ' s &quot; novel &quot; an outlandish tale of melodrama , sex , and mayhem , which Roger can ' t resist peeking into . &quot; Conjugal Bliss &quot; is a larger-than-life anti-romance , antic and full of low-jinx ; imagine &quot; Othello &quot; by the writers of &quot; I Love Lucy. &quot; Even after Rogers comes_to and realizes which way is up , ( we hope ) Nichols is not above pulling ( or trying ) a joke on the reader . John Nichols is to be celebrated as a grinning trickster with this wry roman_a_clef ? ? ? a book rich_in the humor and energy of caricature .</TEXT>
