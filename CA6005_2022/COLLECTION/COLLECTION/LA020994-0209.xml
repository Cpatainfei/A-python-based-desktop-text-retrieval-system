   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; INSPECTORS UNCOVER WEAK WELDS IN PIPELINE ; OIL : AN INVESTIGATION OF AT LEAST EIGHT LEAKS CAUSED BY THE QUAKE IS CONTINUING . THE STATE WILL REQUIRE ARCO TO REPLACE AGED SECTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The oil_pipeline that ruptured during the Northridge earthquake is held together in many places with weak welds that pose a danger of breaking , and regulators are pushing the line ' s owner , Atlantic Richfield Co. , to replace them . Although an investigation of at least eight breaks that occurred along a 35-mile span of the Four Corners Pipeline remains incomplete , an official from the State Fire_Marshal ' s Office on Tuesday pinpointed the archaic acetylene welds and the overall age of the pipe as serious weak_points . &quot; Basically , all_the spills that occurred , occurred at these welds , &quot; said Chuck Samo , supervising pipeline safety engineer for the State Fire_Marshal ' s Office . The agency , which has sole authority for the safety of such pipelines statewide , will require Arco to replace the aged segments and welds , probably over several years , said Samo . &quot; We want to cooperate , &quot; Arco spokesman Albert Greenstein said . &quot; We don ' t want to work in a hostile environment. &quot; One of the Jan . 17 ruptures killed hundreds of fish and other wildlife in the Santa Clara River near Valencia . Another spill resulted in a fireball that injured one man and burned three homes and 17 vehicles on Wolfskill Street , close to a segment of the pipe that runs under the playground of O ' Melveny Elementary School . In response to the fire , the San Fernando City_Council on Monday night voted not to renew its franchise agreement with the Four Corners Pipeline Co. , a subsidiary of Arco , until members are satisfied that all safety concerns have been addressed . The council also voted to explore ways to relocate the mile-long segment that runs_through the city . But San Fernando has no jurisdiction over pipeline safety issues , said the State Fire_Marshal ' s Office . And the city has no control over the pipe segment beneath the playground of O ' Melveny School , according to the Los Angeles Unified School District . The district gave Arco an easement for the pipeline at least 40 years ago and cannot rescind it unilaterally , said Bob Niccum , director of real_estate for the district . In addition , Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon , whose district surrounds San Fernando , told the San Fernando council on Monday night that he opposes relocating the pipe_in his district , and he does not want to reopen the franchise agreement between Arco and the city of Los Angeles . Alarcon , chairman of the public works committee , has called a meeting with residents and public officials today . Meanwhile , the State Fire_Marshal ' s Office is trying to find_out where the archaic welds are located and how many exist , said Samo . About half of the 1920s-era pipeline has been replaced over the years , he said . &quot; Even the plans sometimes don ' t tell you what you have , &quot; Samo said . &quot; In those days , there were no regulations. &quot; Until 1979 , there were no federal regulations for oil_pipelines , and no state rules until 1981 , said Samo . An Arco spokesman said the company would consider any changes , which would depend_on cooperation among the city governments of San Fernando and Los Angeles . The pipeline , which runs from Kern County to refineries in the South Bay , remains shut_down for repairs and inspection . &quot; It will remain shut_down until we ' ve completely satisfied it ' s safe to operate , &quot; Samo said . His office will require extensive tests to look_for cracks or separations resulting from the quake . Greenstein said Arco hopes to reopen the line in about six weeks to two months . &quot; The state fire_marshal doesn ' t want us to operate an unsafe line , and neither do we , &quot; said Greenstein . Greenstein said he is unsure what effect ending the San Fernando franchise would have_on the flow of oil through the pipeline . The Four Corners franchise with the city of San Fernando has been under negotiation since it expired in 1989 . City_Council members confronted by angry residents Monday night said they did not renew the franchise in part due_to safety concerns . City Administrator Mary Strenn said Tuesday the council also wanted to assure that only crude_oil would be shipped -- not more volatile compounds . Crude_oil does not ignite easily , and council_members have questioned the content of the line after the fire , which witnesses said erupted from a motorcycle ' s spark . Samo said as far as his office knows , the contents were light crude_oil , and added that he is unsure if a spark could have ignited it .</TEXT>
