   <HEADLINE> POSITIVE THINKING ; IN A DIVISION OF THE MORGAN AGENCY IN COSTA MESA , HEALTHY-LOOKING MODELS PUT ANOTHER FACE ON HIV AND AIDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Model Rebekka Armstrong leaned over to give a photographer a hug after a long afternoon photo session . But she fell forward and stumbled . &quot; Sorry , &quot; she said softly , &quot; it ' s the dementia. &quot; She wasn ' t whirling from a hard day ' s work . Rebekka Armstrong has AIDS , and she is suffering from one of its side_effects . The conversations that followed were not about her eyes , her makeup or her best side . She chatted about doctors , drugs and T-cell counts , and it was clear that this former Playboy Playmate is a giant reality-check apart from the hoard of other hopefuls striking a pose to make a buck . After her diagnosis in 1989 , she was alone . Less than a year ago , she drank a case of beer daily , lived_in residential back yards and &quot; never talked to anyone. &quot; Now , she ' s among the 40 models age 20 to 45 in the Proof Positive Division of the Morgan Agency in Costa Mesa , a group of people with HIV and AIDS who hope their fresh , healthy appearance will spread a stronger message about the virus that has infected an estimated 750 # 000 to 1 million people nationwide . The men have muscles and rugged good looks , and the women sparkle with the healthy complexions of a Noxzema ad . They are the new faces of HIV -- quite a contrast from the image of emaciated patients dying in hospital_beds , said Morgan Agency president Keith Lewis . The idea for the Proof Positive division , Lewis said , came_to him after he had received a steadily increasing number of calls_for HIV-positive models to promote products marketed for the AIDS community . Since the division was formed , many of the Proof Positive models have also promoted other products and companies not affiliated with the virus . &quot; There are so many people out there living with the disease ( who ) don ' t fill a certain stereotype , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; They are very conscious about their health , and we think it ' s important to show them . We feel good about ushering_in the new face of HIV. &quot; After Lewis began his search for HIV-infected models to start the division a year ago , he said there were a_few agency clients that were &quot; a little nervous &quot; about having models with the virus working_at the Morgan Agency . But as the months passed , the models have been accepted in the industry , and the Proof Positive division is the fastest growing segment of the agency , he says . The idea for the Proof Positive division , Lewis said , came_to him after he had received a steadily increasing number of calls_for HIV-positive models to promote products marketed for the AIDS community . Since the division was formed , many of the Proof Positive models have been hired on their looks alone to promoted other products and companies not affiliated with the virus . Lewis said he met controversy after one of the Proof Positive models appeared in a national ad that critics say exploits the afflicted and incites fear among HIV-infected patients . The ad , featuring Christopher Crays of Costa Mesa , was for Advera , a nutritional supplement promoted by Ross Products Division of Abbott Laboratories as effective against progressive weight loss . Progressive weight loss , or wasting syndrome , leads to malnutrition , one of the leading causes of AIDS-related deaths . The print ad shows Crays , wearing a tank_top and gym shorts , sitting on the living room floor next to a pair of running_shoes . &quot; I never worried too_much about nutrition , &quot; the ad reads . &quot; Then my doctor told me I was HIV-positive . Now I do everything I can to maintain my energy , strength and quality of life. &quot; The national campaign has taken most of its hits from John Stansell , M.D. , medical director of San Francisco General Hospital ' s AIDS Clinic , who calls the disease-specific pitch &quot; a disgusting distortion. &quot; &quot; The advertising gives the impression that every HIV-positive person needs to be taking supplements , &quot; he said . &quot; Advera is a good product . But most ( HIV ) patients don ' t need Advera if they eat balanced meals , &quot; he said . &quot; When I heard the radio ads , I was really angry . It was the way they pitched it to the entire HIV community , as if all patients needed it . They used fear , really , I believe , to turn a profit. &quot; Neither executives from Ross Products or LCF &amp; L , the New York agency that created the ad , returned phone_calls . Crays , 35 , who has been HIV-positive for more_than six years , said he is proud_of the campaign , the product and his recognition as &quot; the Advera man. &quot; He said that he and a lot of other HIV-positive patients are taking a proactive approach to their health instead of a reactive one . &quot; The likelihood is that this ( virus ) is probably going_to kick me in the butt . I don ' t want to live my life like that , &quot; said Crays , who also heads the Life AIDS Lobby in Sacramento . &quot; Nutrition is a very important part of my life. &quot; It is believed to be the first time that ads for an AIDS-related product have been marketed in the mass media , rather than being placed only in gay and lesbian publications . Crays said the Advera campaign was also the largest in the history of the epidemic , something he considers an encouraging breakthrough . &quot; Although some people might be nervous , it ' s been a positive thing for all_of us . We have to get_rid_of this perception that we are all wasting_away or on our deathbeds . . . . This is not a ' them ' disease ; this is an ' us ' disease , &quot; Crays said . Proof Positive is the Morgan Agency ' s fastest growing division both in model count and agency revenue , generating 10 % of the talent and modeling agency ' s business , Lewis said . He interviews all Proof Positive applicants at length , and only those who are comfortable with their HIV-positive status are signed with the 466-client agency . As far as exploitation , he said , there is none . &quot; Exploitation comes_through ignorance . This is about education , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m able to go_to_bed at night and feel good about what I ' m doing . I ' m giving something back by sending a message to everyone that this could be you ( with HIV ) , and hopefully restoring a certain amount of dignity along the way. &quot; Lewis also said that using models who have HIV in AIDS-related ads and public_service announcements requires an honesty that isn ' t always present in the advertising business . &quot; They don ' t have to use models with HIV ; they can hire actors to say they do , &quot; he said . &quot; But by using ( models with HIV ) , we are offering a more accurate portrayal. &quot; &quot; There ' s a growing demographic out there in the mainstream , and using models with HIV to reach them helps them and gives the models work they might not have gotten , &quot; he said . Former real_estate finance attorney Jim Ballard of Hollywood , who set a short-course 100-meter backstroke world_record for his age_group at Gay Games IV , is among those who have signed with the agency . Standing 6 foot 4 , the boyishly handsome Ballard is one of the division ' s most successful models , currently promoting his own greeting_card line . &quot; I ' m not a model . I ' m a face to connect with an epidemic , &quot; said Ballard , 36 . &quot; And this really isn ' t about modeling . It ' s a way to say that there are people out there with HIV . This could be anybody. &quot; Ballard practiced law for 10 years in a large Los Angeles firm before fatigue and other symptoms of the virus made_it too difficult to handle the 60- to 80-hour weeks that came_with the job . &quot; I can ' t really say that I like doing this more_than practicing law ; I love law . But I feel good about this and the message we ' re sending , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s very important. &quot; Darrell Smith , 29 , a Costa Mesa home health-care worker , said with a smile that he also isn ' t a model , just an average guy . &quot; When I was first diagnosed , it was hard for me because I work with AIDS patients , and that ' s all I saw , &quot; he said . &quot; I would go_to work and think , ' God , that ' s going_to be me. ' But now I say , ' I ' m not a victim . It ' s not my whole life. ' &quot; Smith said he was feeling tired and getting some_other blood_tests three years ago , so he had the doctor test him for HIV . &quot; I didn ' t even give that test a second_thought . I know people who are tested and agonize over it . I was sure it was negative , &quot; he recalled . Smith , who has also modeled for Advera , said working with the division has been a positive experience . &quot; If my face or my voice can tell people that anyone can get ( HIV ) , I ' ll be happy , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t see it as exploitative at all . It ' s informative. &quot; Giggling , and typing up her bio in the Morgan Agency ' s booking room , Feliece Jones of Thousand Oaks has a smile that fits right in with the hundreds of 8-by-10 glossies on the wall . &quot; I ' m a very spiritual person , so I don ' t think_about dying , &quot; said Jones , one of the newest Proof Positive models . &quot; that ' s just not me . But if seeing my face can show people out there that they better get tested and protect themselves , then I ' m happy to do it. &quot; Armstrong pushed_aside a strand of long , wavy hair and spoke with innocent candor about AIDS and how it ' s affected her life . &quot; When I found_out , I hit the floor , literally , &quot; she said . &quot; Then I hit rock-bottom. &quot; She ' s not sure how she contracted the virus , she said , adding that that doesn ' t really matter . What matters_to her now is staying healthy and speaking_to teen-agers about HIV , protection and spreading the it-could-be-you message to everyone who will listen . &quot; When these kids come_up_to me after I speak , they say that it really means something to them that someone like me has this virus , &quot; she said . &quot; that ' s really important to me , that I got_through to them. &quot; Like the other models in the Proof Positive division , Armstrong has to worry about symptoms of the virus and how it affects her appearance . &quot; This morning , I saw this little crack in the corner of my mouth , and I thought , not my face , &quot; she said with a laugh . Ballard said he doesn ' t worry too_much about small physical imperfections because &quot; that ' s what the airbrush is for. &quot;</TEXT>
