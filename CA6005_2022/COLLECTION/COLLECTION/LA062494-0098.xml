   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; BOLIVIANS THROWING A FIT OVER SCORELESS TIE ; GROUP C : ROUGH GAME AGAINST SOUTH_KOREA ENDS WITH ANGRY SOUTH_AMERICANS CRITICIZING OFFICIALS AND CRYING CONSPIRACY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Goals ? Who needs goals ? Not the World Cup game between South_Korea and Bolivia on Thursday . Not when it involved crime and punishment , violence and vitriol , and a good old fashioned conspiracy theory . The two gangs that couldn ' t shoot straight ended the game with this World Cup ' s first scoreless tie , probably knocking both from the tournament after the first round . That there was no winner figures in a game between countries that have yet to win a World Cup game in 15 combined tries . What didn ' t figure was that it would be so_much fun . Before 54 # 456 at sold-out Foxboro Stadium , South_Korea and Bolivia spent much of the evening fighting , with shin kicks and headlocks and bear_hugs . The game was only 23 minutes old when a player from each team was taken_off on a stretcher . . . at_the_same_time . Referee Leslie Mottram , a teacher from Scotland , responded with card_tricks , handing_out six yellows and one red . One of the yellows went_to star Bolivian midfielder Julio Baldivieso , his second yellow card of the tournament , causing an automatic suspension for the next game . The red card and one-game suspension went_to Bolivian midfielder Luis Cristaldo in the 83rd minute . With forward Marco Etcheverry suspended for one more game because of a red card in the opener against Germany , the Bolivians will play their final first-round match against Spain on Monday without three of its best players . All of which has totally convinced them that FIFA , soccer ' s governing body , wants them eliminated . &quot; It ' s fine that we have to play Spain and South_Korea and Germany , &quot; Cristaldo said through an interpreter . &quot; But now we have to play FIFA and the referees . &quot; FIFA is only fair to the bigger guys. &quot; Cristaldo was surprisingly expelled when given a red card instead of a yellow after tackling Kim Pan-keun from behind . Unknown to him or the crowd or even the statisticians , it was his second caution of the game . Only after a postgame meeting with FIFA did the Bolivian team realize Cristaldo had been cautioned in the 24th minute for arguing with Mottram . Not knowing why he had been ejected , Cristaldo argued even more after the red card . He went chest to chest with Mottram before finally being restrained by teammates . &quot; I didn ' t understand where the card had come from , I told the referee I thought he was very unjust , &quot; Cristaldo said . &quot; I don ' t think he understood me , but I told him anyway. &quot; Once Cristaldo left , the Bolivians became even angrier . Not only were they forced to play the final eight scoreboard minutes with only 10 players , they had to survive a surprising nine minutes of extra_time before the game ended . Extra_time is accumulated for injuries and other stoppages . It is kept only on a referee ' s watch and is used_up at the end of each half . Many felt there had not been nine minutes of extra_time accumulated in the entire game . During that extra_time , the Koreans nearly repeated the late heroics of their opener against Spain , in which they scored two goals in the final five minutes . If Mottram had waited long enough , they probably would have . Kim Joo-sung missed wide left . Ha Seok-ju ' s shot was knocked left by goalkeeper Carlos Trucco . Ko Jeong-woon kicked a shot directly at Trucco . By that time , the South_Koreans had finally tied the Bolivians with 20 shots each . But they could not untie the score . When the game finally ended , several South_Koreans collapsed in exhaustion . The Bolivians trudged off the field in anger . &quot; In the past , things have always been made hard for Bolivia , and now is nothing different , &quot; said Guido Luayza Mariaca , president of the Bolivian Soccer Federation . When asked if FIFA would rather have big-money teams from Spain and Germany advance from his group , Mariaca said , &quot; You could say that. &quot; When a reporter handed a FIFA official a similar question for Bolivian Coach Xavier Azkargorta in the FIFA-controlled postgame press_conference , the official refused to ask the question . &quot; Maybe we have to pay somebody to let us win , &quot; said one Bolivian official . The South_Koreans , who have little chance in their final first-round game against Germany even with all_of their best players , were appropriately somber . &quot; We should have won , &quot; said Coach Kim Ho . &quot; I wish our players had played calmly . I wish they had not rushed. &quot; So does the U.S. team . It was pointed toward a second-round meeting with the winner of this game . Providing , of course , there was a winner . And you thought this game made the Bolivians mad .</TEXT>
