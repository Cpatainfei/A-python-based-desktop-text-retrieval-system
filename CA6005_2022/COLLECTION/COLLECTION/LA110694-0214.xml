   <TEXT> The Quichua-speaking villagers around this bustling Amazonian oil town blame Texaco Inc. for the black crude oozing from old storage pits , for their forest ' s oil-stained stream beds , even for the lack of game in recent years . &quot; The company ran_off all_the animals , &quot; complained Oscar Machoa , one of 50 residents sitting on wooden benches under the metal roof of an old equipment shed -- women and babies on one side , men and boys on the other -- at a village meeting in nearby San Carlos . But Machoa and local leaders in other countries around the globe have gone beyond complaining about foreign oil producers in their midst . From Machoa ' s corner of the rain_forest , Indian groups are suing Texaco in a U.S. district court , seeking more_than $ 1 billion to clean_up the Amazon ' s oil fields . And elsewhere , from Nigeria to East Timor , increasingly sophisticated demands are confronting U.S. energy companies , which have greatly expanded their hunt for new oil overseas as exploration prospects have dimmed at_home . Some local groups accuse the companies of wreaking environmental damage , others of human_rights abuses . Many have sought concrete bounties in exchange for welcoming Big Oil -- demanding , for instance , a new hospital , school or road . &quot; It ' s important to set a precedent that an indigenous community can demand accountability , &quot; said New York-based environmental activist Judith Kimerling , one of the lawyers who has filed suit against Texaco on behalf of Amazonian Indian federations and other rain-forest groups . Such legal hammers , wielded in U.S. courts , are going_to make &quot; every U.S. oil_company think long and hard about its international actions , &quot; she warned . The history of oil exploration in the developing world has been a drama of exploitation , corruption and lush rewards -- most of them going_to risk-taking , entrepreneurial corporations from the industrialized West . Beginning in the 1880s , companies were granted concessions giving them virtually sovereign sway over exploration tracts . But since the 1970s , central governments in developing countries have been able to command much-improved terms , often reaping half the profits -- and bearing little of the risk -- of petroleum production . Overseas exploration and production spending by the 18 leading U.S. oil_companies grew from 28 % to more_than 61 % of their exploration budgets from 1982 to 1992 , according to a study by the American Petroleum Institute . But until recently , only rarely have the local people of a developing nation had much say in the fate of their region ' s rich resources . &quot; There ' s a real problem in country after country where the resources are considered state-owned , &quot; said Owen J . Lynch , who teaches at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington . Central governments make natural-resource agreements without cutting the locals in on the deal , he said . &quot; We ' re talking_about hundreds of millions of people , and they ' re considered squatters on public land. &quot; So , many local groups are pressing their case directly to U.S. companies , often through environmental and human_rights groups based in the industrialized nations . And around the globe , this newfound political sophistication has substantially changed the game : * In Papua New Guinea , indigenous groups hold what amounts to veto power over foreign energy projects . * In Myanmar , formerly Burma , the concerns of local groups are squelched by an authoritarian regime , but Western allies have brought their complaints directly into U.S. oil_companies ' boardrooms . * In Russia , American companies as part of oil-production deals have agreed to provide communities with medical supplies and to build low-cost housing for Russian soldiers returning from former East Bloc nations . &quot; Getting_into Kuwait in the 1940s , one of the major ( oil_companies ) was asked to provide a yacht , &quot; said Daniel Yergin , president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates . &quot; Now it ' s housing. &quot; For the oil_companies , the hazards of exploration &quot; have shifted from geologic or technical risk to commercial or political risk , &quot; added J . Robinson West , president and CEO of Petroleum Finance Co. , based in Washington . A recent oil workers ' strike in Nigeria underscored the power of an emboldened populace . The nine-week strike cut production an estimated 29 % for resident foreign oil_companies , which include Chevron and Mobil . The strikers , who sabotaged some facilities , had called_on the companies to halt operations . Their goal : to cut_off government_revenue as they pressed to install jailed opposition leader Moshood K.O. Abiola as president . The companies declined , saying that would have amounted to internal political interference . Nigeria ' s military head_of_state now commends &quot; our major partners in the oil_industry &quot; for their support during the strike , which failed in September when the junta arrested strike_leaders . Historically , it was the success of the grass-roots campaign aimed at prodding U.S. businesses to pull_out of apartheid South_Africa that gave hope to efforts around the world to influence corporate behavior . &quot; It took a while , but eventually most of them left , &quot; said Paul M . Neuhauser , a University of Iowa law professor who represents church groups of the Interfaith Center_on Corporate Responsibility , the New York-based organization at the heart of the anti-apartheid campaign in the 1970s and ' 80s . One target now eyed by the interfaith center is China , where foreign companies have invested more_than $ 5 billion in the oil hunt -- but whose Communist regime ' s human_rights record is criticized worldwide . And the center already is campaigning to introduce shareholder resolutions at Unocal and Texaco annual meetings , hoping to force management to stop doing business in military-run Myanmar . According to Sister Valerie Heinonen , director of the center ' s militarism program , Myanmar villagers tell church activists that government soldiers are forcibly displacing whole villages and then drafting the locals to work -- without pay or even food -- to prepare areas in_advance of a planned petroleum pipeline . &quot; And that ' s where the horror stories come_in , &quot; Heinonen said . &quot; These people are put_to_work either as laborers in the sense of hacking out a road , or space for a railroad , or to carry equipment or whatever the soldiers need. &quot; Amoco already has pulled_out of Myanmar , although the Chicago-based company maintains that it saw no evidence of slave labor . An Amoco spokesman said pulling_up stakes was &quot; purely a business decision driven by geology. &quot; Los Angeles-based Unocal , which plans to stay in Myanmar , says that pipeline infrastructure work hasn ' t even begun . &quot; We have flown over the pipeline ( route ) several times , and we can ' t find any evidence to support the allegations , &quot; Unocal spokesman Barry Lane said . &quot; We can ' t find any work going on. &quot; Lane and others in the oil_industry argue that the presence of U.S. companies actually spurs human_rights progress in developing nations . Local people are &quot; better_off , &quot; Lane contended , &quot; because of the wages we pay , the working conditions we have , the education , the training and the compelling day-to-day example of respect for human individuals and their rights. &quot; Unocal and its French partner , Total S.A. , plan to train local farmers and others for higher-paying oil field_work and eventually may set_up a formal school like one Unocal runs in Thailand . Several U.S. ambassadors to Southeast Asian_nations , speaking recently to Southern California business groups , noted that U.S. companies bring their best oil field equipment overseas , transferring that technology and operational knowledge to the developing nations ' oil_industries and workers . Japanese companies , by contrast , often bring older technology . U.S. firms also have more local employees in senior staff ranks , according to the diplomats . &quot; American companies have done demonstrably better at moving Indonesians up , &quot; said Robert L . Barry , U.S. ambassador to oil-rich Indonesia . But Indonesia is also at the heart of one of oil ' s toughest political conflicts . In 1975 , the predominantly Muslim nation conquered the former Portuguese colony of East Timor , a Roman_Catholic enclave on an island 300 miles north of Australia . In the years since , up_to 200 # 000 Timorese have been killed in a bloody campaign of subjugation . The United Nations -- including the United States -- does not recognize Indonesian rights over the area . The dispute is expected to be heard this year or early next by the International_Court_of_Justice at The Hague . In 1989 , Australia and Indonesia divvied_up the potentially lucrative offshore oil rights in the waters between East Timor and Australia . U.S. companies , including San Francisco-based Chevron , have since bid for and won exploration rights . What happens if the World_Court overturns the Australian-Indonesian deal ? &quot; It ' s too early to assess , &quot; said a spokesman for Chevron , which has not yet sunk a well . A U.S. group representing the Timorese thinks otherwise . &quot; The Indonesians haven ' t any right to sell oil in the water there , &quot; said Charles Scheiner , national coordinator for the New York-based East Timor Action Network . &quot; The East Timor people themselves say they would be perfectly happy to negotiate leases with the Western companies , however. &quot; A_thousand miles to the east , in Papua New Guinea , Chevron has tried to meet local entanglements head on . And with good reason . The indigenous people of the island nation own 90 % of the land , and traditional clans aggressively defend their rights , occasionally with ax and spear . Chevron spent 1988 to 1990 negotiating village to village to forge local agreements for a $ 1-billion pipeline and oil field project . Heeding environmentalists ' recommendations , the company included a wide range of environmental safeguards -- planning , for instance , to haul equipment with helicopters during construction to avoid building a road . Roads in undeveloped areas often are blamed for bringing destructive settlement , unchecked logging and other ills to the backcountry . But the 10 # 000 people around remote Lake Kutubu -- poor even by Papua New Guinea standards , with per capita incomes averaging $ 60 a year -- had other priorities . They wanted Chevron ' s development to create jobs , with salaries that would pay school fees for their kids and build clinics . And , although some villagers opposed the idea , most -- tired_of having to walk three days to get_to transportation , local_government facilities or health_care -- wanted Chevron to build a road . They wanted &quot; transportation access to the outside world at times , and also the frills of life -- to go buy some beer , or go_into town , &quot; said Don Henry , director of the South Pacific program for the World Wildlife Fund . Even so , Henry ' s environmental group counseled villagers against the idea . And he has seen one of his fears realized since the project was finished this year : Small-scale logging already has appeared along the road ' s shoulders . Still , Henry has been impressed by Chevron ' s efforts , which include not only the $ 40-million road but more_than $ 45 million in contributions to other community projects . &quot; We found this situation in Papua New Guinea more encouraging than anything we ' ve run_into , &quot; Henry said . Texaco is receiving no such praise for the legacy of its decades of oil_production in Ecuador . Today in the rain_forest , petroleum towns such_as Lago Agrio , Shushufindi , Sachas and Coca have grown from nothing into small cities where pickup_trucks and buses come and go_on streets lined with equipment yards , supply stores , bars and brothels . Pipelines stretch_along the sides of roads coated with greasy waste from oil_wells . From these roads , settlers slash and burn deeper and deeper into the forested hills . A 1.2-million-acre area , once dense rain_forest and pristine rivers , is scarred with roads and pocked with oil_wells after development by Texaco in the 1970s and 1980s that turned Ecuador into South_America ' s No . 2 oil exporter . Critics in Ecuador and the United States say Texaco , the fourth-biggest U.S. oil_company , shares the blame for the damage with Petroecuador , the government oil concern that took_over operation of the Texaco fields in 1990 . ( Texaco ceased all operations in Ecuador two years later. ) And those critics have clout . Ecuador boasts the best-organized , if sometimes divided , indigenous federations of any in the developing world . The local groups have strong advocates in the industrial nations -- including the Natural_Resources Defense Council , Oxfam America and the Rainforest Action Network , all_in the United States . The Ecuadorean government ' s own preliminary evaluation of environmental damage runs to $ 5 billion , according to Luis Carrera , environmental adviser to President Sixto Duran Ballen . Texaco spokesman J . Michael Trevino is quick to agree with Ecuadorean officials who say Petroecuador did most of the damage . Still , he said , Texaco will pay_for part of the cleanup : &quot; We know there is limited and localized damage , and we are prepared to remediate it. &quot; The company ' s latest offer , according to reports in Ecuadorean newspapers : $ 12 million . &quot; We don ' t think that ' s going_to do_it , &quot; retorted Cristobal Bonifaz , an Ecuadorean-born attorney practicing in Amherst , Mass. , who sued Texaco in November , 1993 , in a U.S. district court in New York . The lawsuit charges in part that Texaco executives used technology and methods in Ecuador that were below industry standards , all to save money . Atlantic Richfield Co. , meanwhile , has sought to avoid Texaco ' s oily black_eye . Under a 1988 contract with Petroecuador , Los Angeles-based Arco has drilled three exploratory wells in a tract of forest crossed by the Villano River . The company hopes to drill more wells in the same area to develop the field . After the first two well sites were capped , the earth was re-contoured with topsoil saved when the areas were cleared . Native trees grown in Arco nurseries were used in reforesting . Drilling wastes were re-injected into the ground , underneath potable water_tables . Nonetheless , the Rainforest Action Network and other U.S. environmental groups have hounded Arco in a series of public demonstrations -- in large part because the company negotiated agreements with individual Ecuadorean communities rather than working with a provincial federation of native communities known as OPIP . Critics say the company bought the cooperation of local community leaders who knew less about potential damage than OPIP ' s leaders . W . Ken Keag , resident manager of Arco ' s Ecuador business , and other Arco officials deny it . Whatever the case , OPIP leaders on a U.S. tour sponsored by Oxfam America met for 12 hours in March with Arco executives in Texas . Since then , more meetings in Ecuador have begun to develop a regional resource planning mechanism . Ecuador ' s Ministry of Energy and Mines has pledged to create a national committee to monitor petroleum activities that , in an apparent first for Latin_America , will include Indian and environmental umbrella groups . For their part , many indigenous leaders have come_to agree that there is no alternative to some form of collaboration with the oil_companies . Said Rafael Pandam , vice_president of CONAIE , a major indigenous group that is suing Texaco , &quot; We are sure that Ecuador cannot live without petroleum. &quot; Parrish reported from Los Angeles , Long from Ecuador . In Search Of . . . With domestic production down sharply , nine farflung regions of the world are the hottest spots for exploration today by U.S. oil_companies . Virtually every venue draws the oil_industry into political , social or environmental conflict with increasingly savvy local populations .
