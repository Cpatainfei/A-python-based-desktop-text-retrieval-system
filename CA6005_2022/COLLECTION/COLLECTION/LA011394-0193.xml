   <HEADLINE> SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE ; LACK OF SNOW IS LEAVING SOME RESORT OWNERS OUT IN THE COLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hey kids , anyone for some dirt-boarding ? It ' s approaching mid-January , yet dirt is still the only skiable surface at some local resorts . At Big Air Green Valley near Running Springs , proprietor Eric Schwartz is running_out of patience as he awaits the coming of winter . &quot; I just finished building a judges ' stand_for an event that we ' re not going_to have Sunday , &quot; he said . The snowboarding-only area opened for a week in December but has been closed since . &quot; It ' s bleak , I ' m very depressed , &quot; Schwartz said . Such is life without snow-making . Areas that have been able to make enough of_their_own snow are surviving what has so far been a dry winter . In fact , one ski insider said this week the best skiing in California right now might be at the three Big Bear resorts , which have taken_advantage of technology and cool temperatures . So_much for the good news . Mt . Waterman and Krakta Ridge have yet to open . Ski Sunrise in Wrightwood opened in December , but is closed again because of lack of snow . Mt . Baldy closed Wednesday because of strong winds , but hopes to reopen later in the week . &quot; that ' s Southern California , &quot; Schwartz said . &quot; Part of you gets upset . I ' ve thought_of sacrificing virgins , but that doesn ' t work . I had high hopes , but we still have two months left. &quot; Schwartz said he had plans to invest in a snow-maker , at a cost of $ 500 # 000 after this season . &quot; I was taking_a_chance , &quot; he said . &quot; I was hoping this would be a good year. &quot; * As the World ( Cup ) turns . . . What is it with the International Ski Federation ( FIS ) , the sport ' s alleged governing body ? Las Vegas should lays odds as_to when these Euro-crats will next do something right . Another week , another FIS controversy . Every nation involved in last Saturday ' s super-giant slalom at Altenmarkt , Austria -- with the exception of Austria and Switzerland -- was expected to officially protest the outcome of the race , which was at first halted after 32 racers because of slick course conditions that caused 26 skiers to crash in a frozen finish area . Norway ' s Astrid Loedemel was seriously injured on the course , and Megan Gerety of the United States wiped_out a television crew when she crashed . Loedemel , the top woman with a medal hope in her home country Olympics next month , tore right knee ligaments and will require surgery , ending this year ' s Olympic dream . Yet , after protestations from the_Swiss , who had at stake the race ' s leader , Heidi Zurbriggen , FIS later deemed the Altenmarkt results official . Rules ? According to World Cup bylaws , an abandoned race doesn ' t count if fewer than half the field has completed the course . Eighty-five racers entered the Altenmarkt super-G . Only 32 finished . Either FIS chucked the rule book or invented an interesting new math . You ' ll recall , this is the same FIS outfit that stripped the United States ' AJ Kitt of a World Cup downhill victory last year at Aspen when it canceled the race because of a small hole on the course created -- skiers maintained -- by FIS course designers . U.S. ski team officials are hoarse from screaming about the FIS ' double_standards and now can add Altenmarkt to their files . &quot; If we organized a race like this in the U.S. , they ( FIS ) would have our heads , &quot; U.S. Alpine Coach Paul Major said after Altenmarkt . &quot; It was an embarrassment. &quot; Major maintains the race should have never been run , even though the United States ended_up with an an eighth-place finisher who desperately needed the result : Diann Roffe-Steinrotter . The protests , we boldly predict , will fall on deaf ears at FIS . Still , Major will tell you , it feels good to scream . Skiing , the dangerous sport . FIS , its dangerous leader . * The U.S. Alpine team ' s tough-stance Olympic qualifying criteria have served as a wake-up call to two U.S. veterans who , at least on paper , were in jeopardy of not qualifying for the Olypmic team , to be announced Feb . 7 . Julie Parisien and Roffe-Steinrotter , two former Olympians who had not yet met the U.S. team ' s self-imposed guidelines , responded with top-10 finishes last week . Parisien was eighth at the Altenmarkt slalom , her best finish of the season . Roffe-Steinrotter , the 1992 Olympic silver medalist in giant slalom , finished eighth in a Saturday ' s controversial super-G . After nearly two years in the skiing doldrums , Roffe-Steinrotter appears to be at last gaining momentum , having finished 13th in a giant slalom at Morzine , France , the week before . &quot; Diann seems to be getting a little more fire , which is what she needs. &quot; Major said last week . &quot; She ' s getting a little more ornery every day , and that ' s what I want to see . The more difficult she is to be around , the better she is. &quot; With the top-10 finishes , Parisien and Roffe-Steinrotter each have three top 15 finishes this season , enough to qualify based on the Olympic criteria . Ski Notes Donna Weinbrecht , Olympic freestyle moguls champion , continued her impressive comeback from a knee injury by winning her third_World Cup event of the season last weekend at Blackcomb , British_Columbia . Weinbrecht , 28 , from West Milford , N.J. , missed all_of last season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee during training in November of 1992 . The victory at Blackcomb was the 27th World Cup victory for Weinbrecht , who shows no signs of rust as she prepares to defend her Olympic championship at Lillehammer , Norway , next month . In one of her last tuneups before the Olympics , Weinbrecht will compete Saturday in the Alamo Freestyle Classic at Breckenridge , Colo . It was at Breckenridge in 1992 that Weinbrecht injured her right knee in training while trying to complete jump called a Daffy Twister . . . . World Cup freestyle champion Trace Worthington , who injured his right knee in training last week , said he plans to be back in time for the Olympics . Tests revealed only a partial tear in the medial collateral ligament . The U.S. freestyle team will be selected after the Subaru Freestyle International at Lake Placid , N.Y. , Jan . 20-23 . Here ' s the glimmer of hope for the U.S. technical team . After spending two weeks training at_home in Park City , Jeremy Nobis rejoined the team in Europe and missed the top-30 first-run cut by . 05 seconds at a GS last week at Kranjsk Gora , Slovenia . . . . The United States ' Doug Lewis defeated 11 racing greats last Sunday at Aspen to win the first King of the Mountain downhill race . Lewis , whose time was 2 minutes 4.06 seconds , picked_up $ 25 # 000 for the victory . Lewis , a member of the U.S. ski team from 1980-88 , won the bronze medal in the 1985 championships in Bormio , Italy , and was the U.S. national downhill champion in 1986 and 1987 . Conradin Cathomen of Switzerland finished second , with race organizer Bill Johnson , the former American Olympic gold medalist , finishing third .</TEXT>
