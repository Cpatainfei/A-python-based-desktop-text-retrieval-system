   <TEXT> The scenario is called &quot; nuclear dominoes , &quot; and it is every defense planner ' s nightmare -- because the first dominoes have already begun to fall . It begins this way : North_Korea succeeds in putting a nuclear_warhead atop a medium-range missile -- and then offers to sell similar weapons to other &quot; outlaw states. &quot; Or Iran buys a nuclear bomb from the arsenal of the former Soviet_Union . Or Ukraine declares itself a nuclear_power and keeps some of the nuclear_weapons already on its territory . Those events are not fiction ; all are under way already . The &quot; domino effect &quot; is what happens next . If North_Korea goes nuclear , South_Korea and Japan seek atomic deterrents of_their_own . In response to Iran ' s coup , Saudi_Arabia asks the United States to deploy nuclear_weapons on its soil , and Israel targets Tehran with its own atomic_warheads . If Ukraine stays nuclear , Russia begins rebuilding its armed forces , Germany and Poland think_about atomic weapons , and Central Europe becomes a potential battleground . Five years after the end of the Cold_War , the familiar terror of the old U.S.-Soviet nuclear stalemate has abruptly been replaced by new , more unpredictable dangers : The Bomb , with its power to level cities and destroy civilizations , is passing into many_more hands . President Clinton calls it &quot; the biggest threat we will face. &quot; &quot; I spend a lot of time on this issue , &quot; he said last year . &quot; We have got_to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. &quot; &quot; It ' s the toughest issue there is , &quot; said Samuel W . Lewis , who recently retired as the State_Department ' s chief of policy planning . &quot; It keeps people awake at night. &quot; Concern has been growing for more_than a decade as the irresistible spread of technology made_it possible for countries such_as Israel , India and Pakistan to build atomic weapons on_their_own . But since 1990 , three unexpected events have made the problem more pressing -- and more dangerous : * The Persian_Gulf_War revealed that Iraq was much closer to developing nuclear_weapons than the United States had realized -- and showed that the United Nations ' safeguards against proliferation did not work . Before the war , U.S. intelligence knew of only two Iraqi nuclear-weapon development sites ; after the war , they learned that there had been at least 20 . &quot; If that war had come a year or two later , we might have been looking_at a nuclear Iraq , &quot; one U.S. official said . * The collapse of the Soviet_Union left more_than 30 # 000 nuclear_warheads under the uncertain control of an impoverished and disintegrating military Establishment . At some point , officials fear , some of those weapons will be sold on the black_market to Iran , Libya or some_other eager buyer . &quot; that ' s the most frightening thing , &quot; said David Kay , the United Nations ' former chief nuclear inspector . &quot; I think it ' s inevitable . . . that at some point we will face either the use or the threat of use of former Soviet nuclear material. &quot; * North_Korea ' s drive to develop its own nuclear_weapons already has produced enough plutonium for two warheads and could soon produce enough for five more . What worries U.S. officials most is the prospect that the Pyongyang regime might sell nuclear_warheads abroad , just as it has already sold medium-range missiles to Syria , Iran and possibly Libya . &quot; North_Korea is the destabilizing factor , &quot; a senior U.S. official said . &quot; We are at a turning point with that one. &quot; The potential sale of nuclear_weapons from North_Korea or the former Soviet_Union raises an entirely new threat , what one official calls a &quot; blowout &quot; in the non-proliferation system . In the past , a country that wanted nuclear_weapons had to spend years assembling nuclear material and warhead technology . Now , with enough money and the right connections , any country -- perhaps even a terrorist group -- could simply buy a nuclear arsenal &quot; off the shelf. &quot; If that happens , many_more countries will want nuclear_weapons -- if only to protect themselves against &quot; outlaw nations &quot; such_as North_Korea and Iran . And , in time , they will get them . &quot; Countries who want the technology bad enough will eventually get_it , &quot; Lt . Gen . James Clapper , director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , told a recent congressional hearing . &quot; We ' re looking_at a future in which every major_power has nuclear_weapons , &quot; agreed Michael Vlahos , a strategist at the Center for Naval Analyses . &quot; The only question is whether they use them or not. &quot; * Most analysts believe that they already know the answer to that question . &quot; Somewhere , some time -- but in this decade -- somebody . . . is going_to set_off a nuclear_weapon in deadly earnest , &quot; said Rear Adm . Edward D . Shaefer Jr. , director of naval intelligence . Not everyone agrees with Shaefer ' s prediction . A few political_scientists , such_as UC Berkeley ' s Kenneth Waltz , even argue that proliferation can make the world more stable in the long_run by making war so dangerous that it is unthinkable . But nearly everyone agrees that as more countries acquire nuclear_weapons , chances of something going_wrong -- a misguided war , a miscalculation in crisis or a simple accident -- will increase . That new reality has prompted a basic change in U.S. policy . Once , the United States concentrated_on preventing countries from gaining nuclear technology . Now , U.S. policy acknowledges that more countries may acquire atomic weapons and has added two additional goals : making proliferation safer and building &quot; counter-proliferation &quot; weapons in case a U.S. President decides to destroy a budding arsenal . For more_than a decade , for example , the United States cut_off military sales to Pakistan to discourage it from pursuing nuclear_weapons . But now that Pakistan ' s bomb is virtually acknowledged , the Clinton_Administration is proposing to relax the sanctions and to begin talks on how to prevent accidental nuclear war . Benjamin Frankel , editor of the journal Security Studies , calls this the &quot; New York City public_school solution &quot; : Like teen-agers and sex , nations that want nuclear_weapons are going_to do_it anyway , and the best we can do is to help them do_it safely . At the same time , the Pentagon has launched a new counter-proliferation program to develop forces capable of destroying nuclear_weapons and facilities abroad -- to prevent their shipment to another country or their use in a local war . But proliferation does not only increase the probability of nuclear wars . It also changes the balance of world_power and diminishes the superpower status of the United States . In the Gulf War , U.S. strategists worried that Iraq might use chemical weapons against U.S. troops or Israeli civilians -- but they never had to worry about nuclear_weapons . If the United States ever considers another war with Iran , Iraq or North_Korea , the story could be different . &quot; This is going_to put us in a world much like that of the 1930s : a world of several equally sophisticated military powers , with no one clearly on top , &quot; Vlahos warned . &quot; The conventional wisdom in defense planning is that we dominate the ' battle space ' and we always will . But it isn ' t necessarily so . Nuclear weapons are a great equalizer. &quot; * And that has a political as well as military impact . If a potential adversary has nuclear_weapons , &quot; the cost of intervention for the United States is much higher , &quot; a senior U.S. official said . This means that the other country has less reason to fear the United States -- and a freer hand to intimidate its own neighbors . The proliferation outlook , region by region : * North_Korea : CIA chief R . James Woolsey says the Communist regime of Kim Il Sung probably already has made at least one nuclear_weapon using plutonium from its own atomic_power plants . If North_Korea goes_ahead with plans to remove the fuel from its 25-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon , it could extract enough plutonium to build several more . Coupled with a determined program to develop ballistic_missiles -- and a penchant for selling weaponry to such customers as Iran and Syria -- the North_Korean nuclear project is the world ' s most dangerous military enterprise . If North_Korea goes nuclear , the effect on the rest of Asia will be immediate . South_Korea , which abandoned nuclear_weapons research under U.S. pressure in the 1970s , would clamor for atomic weapons . Japan , which officially has renounced nuclear_weapons , would reconsider that stand -- and U.S. experts believe that Tokyo could build a bomb within months . Last year , Japan briefly balked at endorsing an indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -- apparently because some officials were not sure they could promise to stay non-nuclear forever . Next door , China is already modernizing its nuclear force , testing more accurate warheads and better missiles for medium-range targets such_as Taiwan or Japan and for long-range targets such_as the United States and European Russia . A North_Korean nuclear threat could prompt China to add more weapons to its arsenal of at least 450 warheads . China ' s nuclear strength , in turn , worries two neighbors : India , which already has nuclear_warheads on medium-range ballistic_missiles , and Taiwan , which has twice been stopped by the United States from launching a nuclear program . * Iran and Iraq : The CIA says that Saddam Hussein ' s Iraq was only a year or two from testing a nuclear_weapon when the Gulf War interrupted his program . U.S. officials say they believe that Iraq ' s weapon development program is moribund but almost certainly will be revived if U.N. inspections ease_up . Meanwhile , Iran is working hard to acquire nuclear_weapons . The CIA has said Tehran ' s dogged domestic research program is making only slow progress and still appears at least eight years from producing a weapon . As a result , Iran has stepped_up its efforts to buy warheads or nuclear material from the former Soviet_Union . Iranian agents reportedly have been sighted in Russia and Kazakhstan in search of a deal . The impact of an Iranian bomb would be immense -- in both the Middle_East and farther afield . Nuclear weapons would make Iran the most powerful country on the gulf , able to intimidate its neighbors without fear of military reaction from the United States or Iraq . A nuclear Iran could seize territory or demand cuts_in others ' oil_production . Saudi_Arabia , Iraq and Israel would all view an Iranian bomb as a direct threat . * The Saudis would probably react by seeking more protection from the United States . Israeli leaders might well be tempted to launch a preemptive strike against the Iranian nuclear force , just as they bombed Iraq ' s Osirak reactor in 1981 . Even Turkey , Kazakhstan and Russia would feel nervous about an Iranian bomb . * Libya : Col . Moammar Kadafi reportedly has been negotiating to buy ballistic_missiles from North_Korea and may also be in the market for nuclear_weapons . U.S. analysts do not believe that Libya has significant nuclear research ability of its own . If Libya acquired nuclear_weapons , its potential targets would include Israel , Egypt and U.S. forces in Europe . And Libya ' s long history of support for terrorist groups , from Palestinian guerrillas to the_Irish Republican Army , would raise the specter of an atomic weapon falling_into their hands . * Ukraine : In January , Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk signed agreements with the United States and Russia to remove and dismantle the estimated 1 # 656 nuclear_warheads in Ukraine within seven years . But U.S. officials still worry privately that Ukraine , fearful of neighboring Russia , will be tempted to hang_on to a deterrent force . &quot; We ' re holding our breath and crossing our fingers , &quot; one official admitted . A Ukrainian nuclear force would heighten tension in Eastern Europe -- and probably prompt neighboring Germany , Poland , Hungary and Belarus to reconsider their non-nuclear status . And in the event of a civil_war in Ukraine , the presence of nuclear_weapons could provoke Russian intervention rather than deter it . The ability of smaller countries to acquire nuclear_weapons does not mean that they will actually do so , officials noted . In fact , the last decade offers three examples of countries that abandoned nuclear_weapons projects . South_Africa built a nuclear force of six bombs , apparently for possible use against its black citizens , but destroyed them in 1993 . Brazil and Argentina were_on the way to building nuclear arsenals for use against each other but managed to turn_back in 1991 . Instead , the lesson of half a century of nuclear weaponry is that the drive to acquire atomic hardware is rarely predictable . Josef Stalin shocked the United States when he detonated the first Soviet atom_bomb in 1949 ; China surprised the West in 1964 ; Iraq stunned the United Nations when its nuclear enterprise was discovered in 1992 . &quot; The bottom_line is that we ' ve seen so many sudden and surprising developments that we have to anticipate more of them , &quot; said Leonard S . Spector , a non-proliferation specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . &quot; For example , the nuclear allergy in Ukraine and Japan . . . may_not last forever , &quot; he said . &quot; As soon as the security environment becomes more dangerous , people begin to rethink things . &quot; The danger is to think that there is only going_to be incremental change . That isn ' t going_to happen . There are probably going_to be some big shocks. &quot; Nuclear Weapons : A Growth_Industry Countries ranging from Israel to Pakistan have developed atomic weapons , thanks to the spread of technology around the globe . Many more are_on the verge of having weapons , either through their own development programs or by buying necessary components . COUNTRIES WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS : United States , Russia , China , Britain , France , Israel , India , Pakistan , Ukraine * , Belarus * , Kazakhstan * * Ukraine , Belarus and Kazakhstan inherited part of the nuclear forces of the former Soviet_Union ; all three have pledged to remove or dismantle nuclear_warheads on their territory . ON THE NUCLEAR THRESHOLD : North_Korea COUNTRIES WITH ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS : Iraq , Iran COUNTRIES WITH POTENTIAL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS : Algeria , Libya , Egypt , South_Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Poland , Germany WHAT TO WATCH 1 . North_Korea ' s nuclear project is the world ' s most dangerous military enterprise . 2 . Iraq was only a year or two from testing a nuclear_weapon when the Persian_Gulf interrupted , the CIA says . 3 . If Libya acquires nuclear_weapons , potential targets would include Israel and Egypt . 4 . A Ukrainian nuclear force would heighten tension in East Europe -- and probably prompt neighboring Germany , Hungary and Poland to speed_up development of nuclear_weapons .</TEXT>
