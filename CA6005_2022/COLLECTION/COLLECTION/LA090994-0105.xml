   <HEADLINE> JET CRASH KILLS 131 NEAR PITTSBURGH ; WORST IN 7 YEARS ; DISASTER : USAIR PLANE OUT OF CHICAGO NOSE-DIVES INTO HILLSIDE WHILE TRYING TO LAND . EYEWITNESS SAID CRAFT ' WAS GOING STRAIGHT DOWN , AND THEN A BIG BALL OF FIRE CAME UP. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A USAir jetliner roared out of a clear evening sky and hurtled nose first into a wooded hill late Thursday about a half-mile from a small shopping_center near this Pennsylvania steel town , killing all 131 people on board . It was the deadliest airplane crash in the United States in seven years . The plane , a Boeing 737 en route from Chicago to Pittsburgh , had been scheduled to continue on to West Palm Beach , Fla . It shattered on impact . Engine parts , pieces of airframe and passenger seats flew across the hillside , setting fires . The bodies of its passengers and five crew_members were torn_apart and thrown into bushes and trees . &quot; Our crew_members landed at the scene and ( said ) there were no survivors , &quot; said Jim Bothwell , director of STAT-Medevac in Pittsburgh , about 20 miles away . STAT helicopters were contacted by air traffic controllers to search for the plane when it disappeared from radar . &quot; ( Rescuers ) said the aircraft crashed nose-down. &quot; The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington dispatched investigators to determine the cause of the crash . &quot; There was no indication there was any problem with the flight , &quot; said USAir Assistant Vice_President Dave Shipley . &quot; The weather was clear . . . . We have no indication at all as_to what caused the accident. &quot; The plane ' s &quot; black_box , &quot; containing flight data , was recovered , said Jim Eichenlaub , who coordinated emergency services at the crash scene . Information in the box was expected to help investigators piece together what happened to the aircraft during the fatal moments before it plummeted to the ground . It was the fifth fatal USAir crash in five years . In 1989 , a USAir jet skidded off a New York runway , killing two people ; in 1991 , another collided_with a commuter plane on a Los Angeles runway , killing 34 ; in 1992 , another crashed on takeoff in New York , killing 27 , and last July 2 , another crashed at Charlotte , N.C. , killing 37 . Shipley acknowledged that USAir ' s safety record has been marred in recent years . But he noted that in the Los Angeles collision , &quot; we were totally exonerated from blame. &quot; He added : &quot; There has been no thread of continuity whatsoever &quot; among the five crashes . He said Boeing 737s were &quot; completely safe. &quot; President Leo Janssens of the Aviation Safety Institute , a private air safety organization , agreed with the assessment . He told CNN that the Boeing 737 has &quot; an excellent safety record. &quot; Janssens added that USAir &quot; normally runs a good airline. &quot; He blamed its five crashes on nothing more_than &quot; a run of bad luck. &quot; Thursday ' s ill-fated Flight 427 began in Chicago . * At about 7:02 p.m. , about six minutes before touchdown at Pittsburgh International Airport , the plane vanished from radar screens in the Pittsburgh control_tower , Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Pat Cariseo said . The plane was about 6 # 000 feet above the ground when it disappeared , said Pat Boyle , a spokesman for the Allegheny County Department of Aviation . Boyle said that it was about seven miles from the end of the runway in Pittsburgh . Mary Ann Koren , her son , John Koren Jr. , 32 , and her daughter , Martina , said they were at_home , near the airport flight_path , when the accident occurred . They were sitting in their living_room in front of their television_set and had just tuned_in &quot; Jeopardy &quot; when they heard the jet roar overhead . &quot; Our house was rumbling , &quot; Mary Ann Koren said . &quot; It was like a real loud roar. &quot; She said that she and her son and daughter ran to their front_door . &quot; We saw the plane going straight down , &quot; she said , &quot; nose first. &quot; They grabbed blankets and tried in vain to drive to the site of the crash . They finally cut their way through a wooded area . &quot; There were flames , &quot; John Koren Jr . said . &quot; I saw a seat and some body_parts . . . lying at Martina ' s feet. &quot; The wreckage was scattered among trees on a hilltop about a half-mile from the Green Garden Plaza , a small strip mall near Aliquippa . The hilltop is in Beaver County , near the border of Hopewell and Raccoon townships , in terrain so rough that rescuers had to cut a road to find the wreckage . Fire_trucks and rescuers followed bulldozers to the site . Among the first to arrive was Dr. Stephen Zernich Jr. , a physician from Aliquippa Hospital . &quot; I saw pieces of bodies on the ground , a body hanging_in the trees and several small fires , &quot; he said . In the underbrush , he said , he saw a foot , an arm , a hand severed at the wrist and small pieces of human bone . Smoke from burning jet fuel was extremely thick . A fireman stepped_out of the haze . Dr. Zernich said he asked the fireman if anyone had survived . &quot; ' No , ' &quot; he said the fireman replied . &quot; ' There were no survivors in there , Doc . You might as well go back. ' &quot; * A police_officer from the nearby town of Shippingport , who declined to give his name , said he saw debris from the plane everywhere -- &quot; engine parts , framework , parts of seats . I saw parts of bodies . I ' m a Vietnam vet . I ' ve seen this before -- after B-52 strikes . &quot; that ' s what this reminded me of . Not too_much of anything ( is ) left. &quot; Other eyewitnesses gave equally vivid accounts : &quot; I looked straight up , and there it was , &quot; Tom Michel told the Associated Press . &quot; It was just coming straight down . I was screaming for everybody to run . It looked_like it was under full power , and he just went straight in . . . . All it was was a big boom and the sky lit_up . There was black smoke everywhere , and that was it. &quot; Denise Godich , a nurse , told KDKA-TV , a station in nearby Pittsburgh : &quot; We saw the plane go_down , straight down , and then all we saw was smoke . All we saw was body_parts hanging from the trees , just people everywhere . My husband said the only body he could recognize was a 3- or 4-year-old girl. &quot; Jack Casey told the TV_station : &quot; I saw the tail_end , and it was going straight down , and then a big ball_of_fire came_up . I spent time in Korea , and it ' s the worst thing I ' ve seen. &quot; A woman near the wreckage , Sandra Zuback , told CNN : &quot; The engines just went dead . It just blew up. &quot; The Federal Aviation Administration took_control of the area and sealed it off . The FAA called_in FBI_agents to fingerprint the remains so that they could identify the victims . A temporary morgue was set_up near the scene . Allegheny County Commissioner Larry Dunn , whose office runs the Pittsburgh airport , said USAir set_up an area to receive relatives of the crash victims . He said about 290 had arrived by midnight . &quot; It ' s just such a terrible tragedy , &quot; Dunn said . &quot; You can ' t feel the extent of what this is like. &quot; He said the mood in the closed reception area where families had been sequestered was &quot; very somber. &quot; &quot; People are dumbstruck by the tragedy of it , &quot; he said . Tom Briercheck , 56 , of Pittsburgh , counted himself lucky to have avoided the tragedy . He missed the fatal flight . Briercheck had attended a machine_tool show in Chicago , then stayed downtown for a_couple_of beers -- and was late for the plane . Briercheck and David Carter , a factory manager for his company , arrived_at the Chicago airport just as the flight left , around 6 p.m. They had another beer . When they returned to check for a later flight , a ticket_agent told Briercheck he should count his blessings . Briercheck called home from O ' Hare International Airport at 7:15 p.m. His 13-year-old grandson , Billy , answered the telephone in tears . When he heard who it was , the child yelled , &quot; Grandma ! He ' s O.K. ! He ' s coming_home ! &quot; &quot; It really didn ' t hit me until then how fortunate I was , &quot; Briercheck said . He added that he plans to play the numbers when he gets home . &quot; My wife won ' t complain anymore , &quot; he said , &quot; when I have that extra beer. &quot; The crash was the worst in the United States since 1987 , when a Northwest Airlines MD-80 went_down at Detroit Metropolitan Airport , killing 156 people . A 4-year-old girl was the sole survivor . The cause of Thursday ' s crash was all_the more perplexing because weather did not appear to have been a factor . The hourly weather report at 6:52 p.m. EDT for the Pittsburgh airport was clear , visibility 15 miles , temperature 73 degrees and the wind at 7 m.p.h. -- perfect for flying . Circumstances of the crash seemed similar to an accident involving a United Air Lines Boeing 737 that rolled_over and dived into the ground on March 3 , 1991 , while on approach to the airport at Colorado Springs , Colo . During its investigation of that crash , the NTSB discovered abnormalities in rudder control and recommended that the rudders of all Boeing 737 and 727 aircraft be inspected . * The FAA issued an aircraft directive , a mandatory repair order , as a result of the NTSB recommendation . This led Boeing to redesign the &quot; rudder power control unit servo valve , &quot; a hydraulic control_system component in the 737 , according to Boeing spokesman Steve Thieme . The new parts were made available early last year , and all 737s in_service and on the production_line have been retrofitted , Thieme said . At the time of Thursday ' s crash , the USAir jet should have been flying at about 220 to 230 knots , according to a former USAir employee familiar_with the Boeing 737 who declined to be identified . Any problems with aircraft systems should have been easily overcome , he said . The 737 is a twin-engine aircraft that can fly well on one engine . Failure of an engine at that point in flight would have meant a shutdown , an operation easily accomplished by a two-person flight crew , said a pilot familiar_with the aircraft . Similarly , the pilot said , a failure of hydraulic_systems that control ailerons , which make the plane turn , or the rudder , which keeps it properly aligned with the direction of flight , should have posed little problem . The plane should have had plenty of altitude and air speed to recover from any unusual flight attitude caused by such a failure , the pilot said . The plane that crashed , a 737-300 model , was delivered to USAir in October , 1987 . It was a middle-sized model of three 737s currently in production . Depending_upon configuration , it could hold 128 to 149 passengers . The 737 , in its various models , is Boeing ' s most popular airliner . As of June 30 , 1994 , the manufacturer had delivered 2 # 624 of them to airlines around the world . Three of the five USAir crashes in the last five years have involved Boeing 737s . But USAir officials and others discounted the likelihood that the plane had a mechanical problem . &quot; There ' s no question that the 737 is a completely safe airplane , &quot; Shipley , the USAir assistant vice_president , told CNN . &quot; We operate a lot of them , as do a lot of airlines. &quot; USAir has encountered financial problems in recent years . It has blamed fare wars , fewer passengers because of fears of terrorism and the nation ' s economic recession . Altogether , the airline has lost more_than $ 2.3 billion since 1989 . The loss has caused USAir to cut costs to try to increase its revenue . Only hours before Thursday ' s crash , the carrier announced a plan to provide business passengers with more leg room and wider seats . Times staff writers Pasternak and Ross reported from Pittsburgh , and special correspondent Steigerwald from Aliquippa . Staff writers Richard E . Meyer , Richard O ' Reilly and Shawn Hubler in Los Angeles also contributed to this story . Adding_to a Long List of Air Disasters A USAir Boeing 737 from Chicago crashed near Pittsburgh , Pa. , killing 131 . The flight originated from Chicago ' s O ' Hare International Airport and was headed for West Palm Beach , Fla . This is the fifth fatal crash for the airline in five years . The Boeing 737-300 * Delivered to USAir in October , 1987 , according to a Boeing spokesman . * Can carry from 128 to 149 passengers . * The 737-300 is the most popular commercial airplane model ever developed . * More_than 2 # 600 737s have been put into service since 1967 . USAir Disasters Five fatal crashes in five years : * SEPT . 8 , 1994 : A Boeing 737 crashes near Pittsburgh , Pa. , killing 131 people . * JULY 4 , 1994 : A crash near Charlotte-Douglas International Airport in North Carolina kills 37 of the 57 aboard . * MARCH 22 , 1992 : A jetliner goes_down in a snowstorm at LaGuardia Airport in New York killing 27 people . * FEB . 1 , 1991 : A collision with a commuter plane at Los Angeles International Airport kills 34 people . * SEPT . 20 , 1989 : A jet skids off the runway at La Guardia Airport .
