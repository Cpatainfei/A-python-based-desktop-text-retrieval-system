   <TEXT> In the suspenseful &quot; Day of the Jackal , &quot; a master assassin hired to kill French President Charles de Gaulle works to complete his mission while government detectives race to uncover his identity and stop him . The movie , based on the novel by Frederick Forsyth , begins as French generals are plotting to kill the president and entice an assassin known only as &quot; the Jackal &quot; to do the job . Police soon discover the plot but have no idea who the hit_man is or when he may strike . Worse , the president insists on maintaining a schedule of risky public appearances and refuses extra security measures . Edward Fox is the Jackal , a villain who is all_the more menacing because his attitude is so matter-of-fact and businesslike . Much of the film follows the Jackal as he prepares_for his mission , doing such tasks as getting passports to match his disguises and a collapsible rifle capable of firing explosive-tipped bullets . Dialogue is often sparse because he is alone in many of the scenes , preparing , planning and evading capture , but the action is involving because it reveals only one small piece of his plan at a time . Michel Lonsdale plays Claude Lebel , the police_commissioner charged with the seemingly impossible task of identifying and capturing the assassin . The shrewd and thorough Lebel is up_to the task . When he unmasks the source of an information leak among more_than a dozen cabinet-level officials , they challenge him to provide evidence . So he plays a recording of one of the officials ' lovers phoning information about the investigation to the conspirators . Later , the impressed prime_minister tells him : &quot; There is one thing , though . How did you know whose telephone to tap ? &quot; &quot; I didn ' t , &quot; Lebel replies . &quot; So I tapped all_of them. &quot; The movie unfolds as a kind of chess_game between an assassin bent_on taking a life and a detective determined to save one . Each employs move and countermove , hoping to catch the other off balance and strike the final blow . &quot; Day of the Jackal &quot; ( 1973 ) , directed by Fred Zinnemann . 143 minutes . Rated PG .
