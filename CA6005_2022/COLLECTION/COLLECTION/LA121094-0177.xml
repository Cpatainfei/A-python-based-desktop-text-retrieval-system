   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN AUTHORIZES FORCE AGAINST RESTIVE CHECHENS AS WAR LOOMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin authorized the use of force against the breakaway republic of Chechnya on Friday , instructing his government to use &quot; all means at the state ' s disposal &quot; to restore order . Russian soldiers are massed along the border of the tiny Caucasus Mountain republic , and Russian warplanes have been flying over Grozny , the capital . Yeltsin ' s presidential decree accused unspecified militias in Chechnya of &quot; causing bloodshed , taking lives and violating the rights of Russian Federation citizens. &quot; He called_for the use of &quot; all means at the state ' s disposal &quot; to subdue these &quot; illegal armed groups. &quot; In Grozny , people braced for war . Moscow has long portrayed the government of Chechen President Dzhokar M . Dudayev as a criminal regime and the forces loyal to him as gangsters and terrorists . It wants Dudayev out and refuses to recognize Chechen independence , which Dudayev declared in 1991 . Although Yeltsin ' s decree did not say what &quot; means &quot; his government would use , the threat of force was clear . The decree was a reversal of Yeltsin ' s earlier statements that using force in Chechnya was out_of_the_question .</TEXT>
