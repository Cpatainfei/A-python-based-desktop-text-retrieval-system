   <TEXT> Crush some garlic and add a dash of cayenne_pepper . Brew with the juice of six grapefruit . Bombard with positive thoughts -- this , like , being Southern California . And , oh yes , let someone tuck you into bed with tender , loving care . This concoction was among the nearly 200 responses sent_in by readers who shared their best cures for wintertime colds and flu . Chicken is big , booze is bigger . And lots of readers have faith in salt , onions , garlic , and sizzling teas and soups . There were readers who passed_on home remedies that had been in their families for generations -- like Magda Simon ' s chicken_soup , which originated_in Hungary at the turn_of_the_century . &quot; The chicken has nothing to do with it , &quot; says Simon of Los Angeles . &quot; It ' s the onion , garlic , parsley roots , parsnips and carrots. &quot; And , the call_for home remedies clearly brought_back memories of a time before TheraFlu . Devra Hill , a Beverly Hills writer , was raised on her Italian grandmother ' s boiled grapefruit_juice and her English grandmother ' s hot_toddy consisting_of lemon_juice , brandy and hot water . Ben Fellstad of Mission Viejo recalls that while growing_up during the Great Depression in the backwoods of Norway , &quot; Home remedies were all we had . &quot; It was a common remedy ( to put ) two drops of turpentine or naphtha on a sugar cube , chew fast and swallow . After a_few minutes in the stomach , this vile concoction started a revolution that could only be relieved by a tremendous burp that was more like an explosion . And you felt_like your face disappeared through your ears. &quot; Other readers recalled home remedies that saved them as a child but dare not be repeated in the days of antibiotics . It was apparently common to blow sulfur through a straw into a child ' s sore_throat ; swab the neck with kerosene , also to relieve raw_throats ; blow smoke in an aching ear , and hang little bags of smelly &quot; asafetida &quot; or fried onion around the neck to ward_off germs . ( Actually , the bag probably warded_off other children , which warded_off germs. ) Lael Littke of Pasadena says her &quot; flesh cringes &quot; when she thinks_of her mother ' s remedy for chest colds : flannel plaster bags smeared with a concoction of dry mustard , water and cayenne_pepper . &quot; She smeared this mess inside the two bags at bedtime , then fitted them onto the unfortunate child , &quot; Littke recalls . &quot; After a couple tablespoons of cod_liver_oil . . . the child was deposited to bed , covered with heavy quilts , and left to fry gently all night . &quot; In the morning , our small chests were fiery red and close to blisters from the heat generated by the concoction , but we were free from congestion . Or , at least we claimed we were , to avoid a second night ' s cooking. &quot; * Home cures clearly have a place in the modern_world . Some ingredients do have the power to relieve cold and flu symptoms , according to science . Others may simply work because people believe they work , although there is no evidence that any home remedy can cure a cold . But perhaps feeling good is just as important as getting_over a cold quickly . Maybe that is why so many readers say they turn_to their liquor cabinets instead of their medicine_cabinets when the sneezes strike . Liquor , like other home remedies , is contrary to what science dictates is_best to treat colds and flu . Alcohol can raise your body_temperature -- not a good idea if you ' re already stoking the thermometer . Other home remedies make some sense for reasons strongly rooted in folklore and homeopathy , if not in medical_science . Garlic , for instance , is considered a potent cure in some areas of the world . It ' s said to reduce throat soreness and chest congestion . Garlic contains selenium , known to have a calming effect , says pharmacology professor Fred Weissman of USC . ( He was solicited for this story as the scientific voice of reason. ) &quot; There is some mystique in terms of how garlic works , &quot; he says . &quot; But selenium does seem to suppress excitability , so there may be some effect in making you feel better. &quot; Equally bad for your breath but good for your health are onions , among the oldest natural remedies -- dating to the Greeks and Romans . Onions , long thought to prevent infection , are now considered to be effective as an expectorant , especially when consumed in a syrupy form . Onions are also rich_in Vitamin_C ( which studies show may have a mild effect in reducing the duration of a cold ) . * Many home remedies are based on liquids , which counter dehydration caused by vomiting or high fever , loosen congestion and relieve sore_throat and coughing . Hot liquids do the same things while also raising the temperature of the throat , which , legend has it , stops the reproduction of viruses . Viruses often take_hold in the throat before spreading throughout the body . So some people believe that gargling with hot salt water at the first sign of soreness may kill the virus before it has a chance to spread . According to folklore , salt breaks_up mucus and draws it out of tissues . But salt probably works as an anesthetic , Weissman says , adding that he doubts that gargling at the first sign of a cold can stop it in its tracks . &quot; It may be true that some viruses colonize in the throat . But it depends_on the virus . If you have a headache or stomachache as well , it ' s gone beyond the throat. &quot; Honey is often used in remedies because of its gooey consistency -- thought to coat the throat membranes , soothing and protecting them . But two cautions : Honey should not be given to a child less than 1 year old because it can be contaminated with bacteria poisonous to young children ; also , honey may help quiet a cough , but coughing may be beneficial to clear phlegm from the respiratory_tract . Citrus_fruits , popular natural remedies among readers , are thought to work by providing an acidic environment in the throat where viruses can ' t flourish . As for concoctions that contain a variety of fruits and vegetables , many are high in vitamin_C and vitamin A , thought to strengthen the body ' s immune_system . Spicy foods containing chili_pepper , Tabasco , hot mustard or curry are also frequent remedies . Many spicy foods are rich_in capsaicin , the substance that adds zing to hot_peppers . Capsaicin causes tissues to release fluids and loosens the sticky congestion . Herbs are also trendy among Southern Californians . Echinacea is said to boost the immune_system to fight germs . Although the herb has been studied extensively in Germany and is used for many problems , including colds , it hasn ' t received much scientific attention in this country . * All our readers swear that their cures work . But Weissman is not so sure . &quot; I ' m not saying these things are nonsense . We do see some people improve . But that leads to the question : Were these people going_to improve anyway ? &quot; he asks . &quot; And then there is the mental component . If you take something , you often start to get better . I guess the bottom_line is , if it makes you feel better , you take it. &quot; Weissman is not above trying a_few home remedies . He says he once iced his toes on the theory that lowering body_temperature via the feet would provide an inhospitable climate for the virus . &quot; I don ' t know that it worked , &quot; he says . &quot; I know I got cold toes. &quot; And , when he ' s sick , Weissman says his wife prepares a glass of water with one teaspoon of vinegar and one tablespoon of honey . Does he drink it ? You ' d better believe it .</TEXT>
