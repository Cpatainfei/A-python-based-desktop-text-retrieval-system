   <HEADLINE> AFTER BRACING FOR WORST , SOUTHLAND ELUDES STORM ' S WRATH ; WEATHER : REPEATED WARNINGS OF MUDSLIDES HAD BEEN ISSUED BUT LITTLE DAMAGE WAS REPORTED . WEEKEND FORECAST CALLS FOR SUNNY SKIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Leaving Southern California damp but largely undamaged , a powerful Alaskan storm departed for Arizona on Friday after dumping up_to 1 1 / 3 inches of rain in the coastal valleys and more_than a foot of snow at some resort areas in the mountains . Despite repeated warnings from the National Weather Service about possible mudslides in areas stripped bare during last fall ' s destructive wildfires , most of the storm runoff was contained . Rockslides did force temporary closure of Pacific Coast Highway and five canyon roads in the Malibu area , but the routes were reopened to residents Friday as Caltrans crews labored to clean_up the mess . The rain snarled traffic Thursday evening and apparently contributed to dozens of accidents on Los Angeles freeways and streets during the night . In Van Nuys , a motorist apparently lost_control of his car on a slippery roadway shortly after midnight Thursday and died when his vehicle struck a wall , Los Angeles police said . Roberto Luna , 26 , was driving eastbound on Saticoy Street when he may have failed to notice that the street veers to the right as it approaches Van Nuys Airport , Sgt . Rod Grahek said . Investigators said that when Luna tried to stop , his car skidded on the wet pavement , glanced off a sign , vaulted over a guide wire and slammed into the wall . Shortly before 11 a.m. Friday , the Coast Guard called_off a search west of Santa Catalina Island for the source of an apparent distress_signal first picked_up about 9 a.m. Thursday as the storm system began moving_into Southern California , generating heavy seas along the coast . The signal , which seemed to be from the type of emergency radio_signaling device carried by many small_boats , faded_out about two hours after it was first heard , Coast Guard Petty_Officer Trent Jones said . An airborne search team spotted a light on what appeared to be a raft in the same general area late Thursday night , but another sweep at dawn Friday turned_up nothing , Jones said . Although forecasters had predicted that the storm would hang_around much longer , most of the rain fell_in heavy thundershowers Thursday night , with only a_few light sprinkles reported in most areas on Friday . By nightfall Friday , the forecast was for clearing skies with plenty of sun today and Sunday , and high_temperatures climbing into the mid-70s . The high_temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center_on Friday was 62 degrees , after an overnight low of 48 . As of 5 p.m. , the Downtown rainfall total from the storm was . 77 of an inch . The season ' s rainfall total was 7 inches , compared to a normal total of 13.13 inches . Times staff writer Timothy Williams contributed to this story .</TEXT>
