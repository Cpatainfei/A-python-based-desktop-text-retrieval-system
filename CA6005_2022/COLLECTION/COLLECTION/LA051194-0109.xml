   <HEADLINE> SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS STRAIN PENSION_FUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County ' s 6 # 000 present employees may have to pay higher contributions to their retirement_funds in future years if the county ' s 2 # 200 retirees are to continue receiving supplemental benefits , the county tax_collector said Tuesday . The $ 5-million annual bill for supplemental benefits -- which are paid in addition to those due retirees by contract -- could also come from the county ' s general fund , Tax_Collector Harold S . Pittman said . But given the county ' s budget problems , it is unlikely that the Board of Supervisors would approve such a move , he said . Pittman told county supervisors Tuesday that he opposes a proposal to be considered by the county Board of Retirement on Monday to continue paying the supplemental benefits by tapping the retirement_fund ' s $ 42-million reserve_account . Pittman said that taking money from the reserve_account would only deplete the retirement_fund for present employees . If the reserve is tapped , employees would have to make higher pension contributions to make_up for income lost from the money taken from reserves , Pittman said . Since 1977 , the county has been able to give supplemental benefits -- now amounting to as much as $ 280 per month for some retirees -- because the retirement_fund was earning large profits on its stock , bond and real_estate investments . The supplemental benefits were sort of a bonus in addition to the benefits provided by the employees ' contributions to the pension_fund . But with the recent downturn in the markets , the Board of Retirement has no extra funds to pay the supplemental benefits , Pittman said . The Board of Retirement would have to take capital from reserves to pay the benefits this year . But Pittman acknowledged that it would be difficult for retirees to accept smaller pensions . &quot; It ' s a very emotional issue for these people , &quot; he said . &quot; People out there have grown to depend_on the supplemental benefits . But I don ' t think it ' s my responsibility to approve benefits to the detriment of current employees and the county general fund. &quot; Pittman told supervisors Tuesday that they should decide the_matter and not leave it to a nine-member board of appointed and employee-elected representatives who govern the retirement_fund . The supervisors decided to put the_matter on the agenda in two weeks to discuss a possible policy_change . Supervisors Chairwoman Vicky Howard said the downturn in the markets was bound to happen . &quot; We ' ve been riding the upsurge for a number of years and this is the inevitable shakeout , &quot; she said . &quot; But part of our fiscally conservative approach is to keep that 5 % ( reserve ) to protect present employees and retirees. &quot; Supervisor Maria VanderKolk , who sits on the Board of Retirement as the supervisors ' representative , said she also objects to paying the supplemental benefits this year . &quot; We expect a large_number of retirees coming_to complain on Monday about how difficult it is to deal with what could amount to a couple hundred dollars a month less , &quot; she said . &quot; But we just don ' t have the money. &quot; Retirement board_member John Crossan , president of National Benefit Services , a pension administration and asset management company in Westlake , said he plans to take both viewpoints into account when he votes on the_matter Monday . &quot; We understand the retirees ' position and we would certainly like to help them in any way we can , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' d love to do_it . But we have to look_at our fiduciary responsibilities to the whole fund. &quot; Pittman added that despite the possible loss of some reserve_funds , the retirement_fund overall is financially healthy , with holdings worth $ 896 million , including the reserve . He said that by law , the retirement_fund is required to keep only a 1 % reserve . But the reserves were bumped_up seven years ago when investment returns were extremely good . &quot; If it was a good idea to have 5 % in times of plenty , why would we want to reduce it during a time when we ' re losing money ? &quot; he asked .</TEXT>
