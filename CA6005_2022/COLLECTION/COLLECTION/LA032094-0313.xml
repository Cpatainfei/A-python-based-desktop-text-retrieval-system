   <HEADLINE> GOOD MORNING , VIETNAMESE AMERICANS ! ; COMMUNICATIONS : AFTER NINE MONTHS ON THE AIR , O.C. ' S LITTLE SAIGON RADIO HAS BECOME THE SOURCE OF NEWS FOR COMMUNITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trang Nguyen , president of Little Saigon Radio Broadcasting , barely had time to sit_down at her desk Tuesday morning before her phone started ringing . It would not stop for hours . Early reports about the Vietnamese American who had gone_on a shooting rampage at a Santa Fe Springs electronic plant had just hit the newspapers . Nguyen ' s Vietnamese-speaking listeners wanted to know if the station could tell them more about Tuan Nguyen , the Orange County man who had killed three people and then himself . Reporters for mainstream media also were_on the line , asking if Little Saigon Radio could provide additional information for their own coverage . Even tearful relatives and friends of the victims called_in , seeking advice . Though it has been_on the air for a mere nine months , Little Saigon Radio has become an influential voice in Vietnamese-American affairs throughout Southern California at a time when debate over U.S.-Hanoi relations has intensified here . The station provides news , a platform for debates on issues and community service information . Its emerging , multifaceted role was not planned by station founders -- not to mention completely unanticipated by skeptics -- when the idea of the first extensive Vietnamese-language daily broadcast in Southern California was bandied_about this time last year . &quot; It was quite a bold move to start a daylong radio program , especially since other , shorter Asian-language programs on the radio at the time were not very successful , &quot; said Nghia Tran , executive_director of the Vietnamese Community of Orange County , a nonprofit social_service organization . Tran , like many others in the expatriate community , had politely dismissed the program ' s chances of success when Trang Nguyen initially asked his opinion . &quot; Somehow , against all odds , &quot; he now marvels , &quot; it has become an institution , a medium which Vietnamese -- those who are not acculturated as well as those who are fluent in English -- can turn_to for help and information. &quot; Stroll through almost any store in Little Saigon during business hours any day_of_the_week , and chances are that if the radio is_on , it is tuned to KWIZ-FM ( 96.7 ) , Little Saigon Radio . Broadcast entirely in Vietnamese , the program features music ; local , state , national and international news ; commentaries and talk_shows . More important , the station supplies news that Vietnamese Americans from Orange County to parts of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley normally can ' t find or understand in the English-language media . &quot; There ' s a sense of need for information in the Vietnamese community , and people trust us , &quot; Nguyen said . &quot; We ' re journalists . We ' re professionals . But our listeners also know that we want to extend our hands instead of just doing a job . It ' s not a cliche : We are a community service. &quot; Some critics , however , charge that the program at times shows an anti-Communist bias in its coverage of Vietnam and the local community . Dr. Co Pham , the president of the Vietnamese Chamber_of_Commerce who has received death threats for openly supporting the normalization of diplomatic ties between the United States and Vietnam , cited as an example the September demonstration in front of his office -- the first major story broadcast by the station since it began airing on July 1 . The protest began with one man staging a hunger_strike in the parking_lot of Pham ' s Westminster practice and grew_into a crowd over two days that totaled thousands . Pham alleges , and some others in the community privately concur , that by allowing demonstrators to get_on the airwaves to ask_for participants , Little Saigon Radio unduly helped fan the protest . &quot; There were only a_few hundred anti-Communist protesters at my office several months ago but they said on the air there were several thousand , &quot; Co recalled . &quot; Then their announcer urged listeners to go join the protest . So several hours later there were several thousand people . that ' s irresponsible. &quot; Little Saigon Radio said it was merely doing its job by reporting the demonstration . Viet Dzung , the morning disc_jockey who broadcast the event live , denied he encouraged listeners to protest . But &quot; even if I did , &quot; Dzung said , &quot; if Dr. Co is in the right , if what he does is for the good of the community and not his own , then I could have screamed my lungs out for people to show_up and protest and no one would have come. &quot; His boss , Nguyen , is just as unabashed . She and other board_members of the private_corporation were disappointed , she admitted , when President Clinton ended the economic sanctions against Vietnam last month which allows the two former enemies to conduct commercial business . And in the critical months to come while the U.S._government mulls_over whether to renew diplomatic ties with Vietnam , Nguyen said , the station ' s broadcasters will continue to advocate that normalization should only occur when human_rights and democracy for the Vietnamese are restored . But they also will invite those who support normalized relations with Vietnam onto the program to present the other side , she said . Nguyen pointed_out that in the interests of balance , the station has been willing to risk losing advertisers who oppose the ending of economic sanctions . For example , the program last year interviewed Nghia Nguyen , an economist who works for the World_Bank and who favors the lifting of the embargo . Following that interview , employees of the station fielded calls and letters from angry anti-Communist callers , some threatening to bomb the station , Trang Nguyen said . &quot; We may_not have supported ( the economist ' s ) viewpoint , &quot; she said , &quot; but we were not going_to suppress it either. &quot; The station &quot; can ' t tell the listeners what to think_about anything , &quot; Nguyen said . &quot; They will make their own decisions. &quot; Other criticism of Little Saigon Radio has less to do with station ' s politics and more with the broadcasters ' ethnocentric approach . A few Vietnamese American followers of the station claim that broadcasters seem to promote ethnic elitism during the morning and afternoon drive-time talk_shows . One recent example , some said , were the closing comments earlier this week by Viet Dzung after an on-the-air interview with a witness to the Santa Fe Springs shootings . During his address to the listeners , asking Vietnamese to unite in the aftermath of the tragedy , the disc_jockey labeled mainstream media coverage of the shooting as &quot; distant , cold. &quot; &quot; I ' m sure they ( the media ) don ' t intend to do so , but it seems that because they ' re looking_at this tragedy through the eyes of someone not a part of this community , they ' re searching for some reason to blame the tragic shootings on something relating to the Vietnamese community as_a_whole , &quot; Viet Dzung said on the air Tuesday , a day after the shooting . He continued : &quot; We all know it ' s not so . . . . The community should show its unity by comforting relatives of the victims . . . . We need to show those who are not a part of the community that we care_for each other. &quot; Because of the broadcasters ' practice of &quot; complimenting &quot; the potential audience and many of the guest speakers , said Yen Do , editor of the Westminster-based Nguoi Viet Daily newspaper , &quot; the listeners get this image that our community is all good and we ' re the victims of the outside world. &quot; For every critic , Little Saigon Radio owners said , there are thousands of listeners who value their program and the community voice it has indisputably become . When the station first went_on the air , the corporation formed by Nguyen and three partners had attracted only only five advertising accounts after weeks of soliciting . Three weeks into the program , the station had filled all its advertising air time . It now has about 200 advertisers with new accounts lining_up every day , Nguyen said . It cost the partners , including Nguyen ' s husband , $ 150 # 000 to launch the station . They had hoped to be in the black within six months ; they reached that goal within three . Nguyen declined to discuss the station ' s profitability because of future potential competitors . The program began with nine hours of daily air time , Monday through Friday . Today , it broadcasts from weekdays from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sundays . The station , now with 60 # 000 to 70 # 000 listeners , is in the process of negotiating for Saturday air time . For all their reservations about the program , even the critics agree that Little Saigon Radio offers many Vietnamese Americans some degree of belonging , something mainstream media probably could never match . &quot; It lessens the stress of homesickness in our community , &quot; Dr. Co Pham said . &quot; The station gives Vietnamese people a sense of pride in our heritage. &quot; Do , the editor , added : &quot; It ' s really given our community a sense of focus . Now , any time people have questions or comments , they call_up the station. &quot; Such was the occasion for Chi Pham of Garden Grove , whose fiance , Chin Nguyen , was one of the three people shot to death last week at Extron Electronics in Santa Fe Springs . ( None of the Phams or Nguyens in this story are related. ) The day after the shooting , when official information was still scant , Chi Pham frantically called Little Saigon Radio for help . &quot; I don ' t know what ' s going_on , &quot; she tearfully told Trang Nguyen in Vietnamese . &quot; I don ' t know who to turn_to for information on what happened to my fiance . I don ' t speak English very well . Please help me. &quot; Nguyen told Pham what the station knew , what Pham couldn ' t understand in the English-language media , and helped calm her . &quot; I didn ' t know who else I could trust to give me some information , &quot; Pham said later in an interview . &quot; The radio was my only link. &quot; Little Saigon Radio started_out as a business venture and as an attempt at become a voice where one has not existed before for the Vietnamese community in the Southland , Nguyen said . &quot; We now realize that whether we want to or not , we have become something a little bit more -- something like some sort of a leader , I guess &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t think we could ever live_up_to that expectation because we are journalists , after all . All I can say is I hope we can do our part in strengthen the sense of the Vietnamese community. &quot;</TEXT>
