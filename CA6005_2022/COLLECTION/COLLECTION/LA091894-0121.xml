   <HEADLINE> IS BILL_CLINTON ' S LASTING POLITICAL LEGACY GOING TO BE THE RESURRECTION OF THE GOP ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Overemphasis on President Bill_Clinton ' s individual failures -- in health reform , foreign_policy and moral leadership -- clouds our understanding of what could be his most significant 1993-94 political impact : the extraordinary rebuilding of the Republican_Party and the serious dislocation of U.S. liberalism . Barring a surprise in Haiti , Clinton is doing for liberalism what Jim Jones did for Kool-Aid . The political reversal has been stunning since George_Bush left_office in January , 1993 , after getting just 37.5 % of setback the vote -- the lowest for any Republican President since 1912 . Earlier , Bush ' s job approval had set another modern record by plummeting 60 points in 15 months -- from 90 % in March , 1991 , after the Gulf War , to just 30 % in midsummer , 1992 . But now the GOP is storming back , with a string of 1993-94 off-year and special-election victories unprecedented for the party out of power , and the prospect of operational , and perhaps official , control of the U.S. House and Senate . If Republicans make even a modest version of the November gains predicted , Clinton will confront the largest_number of congressional Republicans to face a Democratic President since 1952 . This may_not be altogether bad for the President , but it is bleak news for the U.S. liberal agenda , which faces a Siberian winter for the next year or two . What ' s remarkable , though , is how the Democrats are following the same counterproductive political-sitcom script they ' ve followed most of the last_half century : Elect a President from a border state or the South with a taste for cronyism , frequently with a brother out of a L ' il Abner cartoon , a tendency toward ideological compromise and military ineptitude , a manner that grates on many voters and a diplomatic style that produces snickers in the global community . Harry S . Truman of Missouri , President from 1945 to 1952 , begins the list . The roster should also include Lyndon B . Johnson of Texas and his brother , Sam Houston Johnson ; Jimmy_Carter of Georgia with his brother , Billy , and now Clinton of Arkansas with his brother , Roger . During these presidencies , the holiday White_House has shifted to centers of gravitas like Johnson City , Texas ; Plains , Ga. , and Hot Springs , Ark . Scandals and conflicts_of_interest have been epidemic since Truman ' s term , usually involving mink_coats , 5 % rake-offs , deep_freezes , family broadcasting stations , peanut deals , country banks , commodity straddles and good ol ' boy law_firms . Truman , Johnson and Carter all botched wars or military_actions -- the Korean_War , the Vietnam_War and the Iranian hostage crisis with its failed U.S. rescue attempt . Because voters were unimpressed , all three faced strong renomination challenges . Such is the unfortunate regional and philosophic tradition from which the Democratic Party chose Clinton in 1992 , but the latter so far has surpassed his predecessors . After his first 100 days , he had the lowest ratings of any newly elected chief_executive since the invention of polling in the 1930s . His current ratings are near the lows for this point in a presidency ; and he is the first Oval Office occupant to generate major scandals and lose the trust of the American people even before the first midterm elections . Clinton has reduced the public ' s faith in Washington below the levels achieved by Johnson , Richard M . Nixon , Carter and Bush . Moreover , Haiti has the potential to be a historic first : the first invasion ordered over the opposition of much of the public -- 73 % -- by the first President accused of being a draft_dodger . The previous military miscarriages in Korea , Vietnam and Iran were all damaging to the Democratic Party , but were all ordered by Presidents who had themselves served as military_officers . Compared with Clinton , a cynic could say that Truman , Johnson and Carter were Dwight D . Eisenhower , Douglas A . MacArthur and George S . Patton Jr . So is all this about to be held against the Democratic Party ? Probably . At least that ' s what the polls and the special elections of the last 20 months seem to suggest . In fact , Clinton ' s three border state-Southern predecessors did much the same thing . Truman ' s unpopularity enabled the GOP to sweep the 1952 elections ; Johnson ' s multiple foul-ups allowed the GOP to resurrect itself from the 1964 Barry M . Goldwater disaster and elect Nixon in 1968 . And national dissatisfaction with Carter paved the way for the stunning victory of Ronald Reagan in 1980 , just six years after Nixon was forced to resign after Watergate . In short , the resurrection of the GOP achieved by Clinton isn ' t unprecedented . What is unusual , though , is the breadth and speed of the process . If Carter was a case of Geritol for the GOP of 1980 , the Clinton_Administration has been the equivalent of Ponce de Leon ' s fountain_of_youth . No one is praising the great sagacity , talent pool and leadership of the Republican_Party -- if the Vegetarians were the sole party on the ballot opposing Clinton , they ' d probably be winning , too . Therein lies the second_half of the American political dilemma . The Republicans can be resurrected , but they can ' t gain the lasting trust of the people . The Truman , Johnson and Carter failures produced the two- and three-term regimes of Eisenhower , Nixon-Gerald R . Ford and Reagan-Bush , but none of these could please the public enough to give the GOP a top-to-bottom national political supremacy . On the contrary , by 1992 , when the GOP had held the White_House for 20 out of the last 24 years , the party ' s share of the presidential vote plummeted 16 points from its previous level in 1988 . Historically , that magnitude of decline has signaled a watershed and movement into a new era -- as it did_in 1932 and 1968 . The point is that conservatives who believe Clinton ' s failure was inevitable and that the GOP era is simply being renewed may be fooling themselves , like the Democrats did after Nixon resigned in 1974 and Carter won in 1976 . Democrats generally assumed that they were back , that the Nixon years were a fluke and liberalism could resurrect its old rhetoric and blueprints . Carter ' s defeat in 1980 proved the new era was real . If the Republicans make major gains in November , as appears likely , they may make the same error . They may mistake Clinton ' s personal failure as a mandate for a return to an ideology of domestic inaction and drift that the public rejected under Bush -- and that also helped cut_short previous GOP regimes . This kind of GOP record in Congress over the next two years could give Clinton just the 1996 whipping boy he needs . If the Democratic Party of the last half-century has continued to bounce along in a rut , arguably that is almost as true of the Republicans . The time has come_to face a basic truth . Disgusted American voters aren ' t merely tired_of Clinton and the Democratic Party . They ' re angry at Washington and its entrenched political classes , they ' re sick_of the two-party duopoly and there ' s some evidence that they ' re also radicalizing toward support for a major overhaul of the U.S. political_system . would n ' t it be ironic if this larger upheaval was the ultimate political consequence of the Clinton_Administration ?</TEXT>
