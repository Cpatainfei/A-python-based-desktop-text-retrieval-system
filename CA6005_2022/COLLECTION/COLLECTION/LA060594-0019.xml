   <HEADLINE> BALLAD OF AN INTELLECTUAL , BY E . E . CUMMINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Listen , you morons great and small to the tale of an intellectuall ( and if you don ' t profit by his career don ' t ever say Hoover gave nobody beer ) . ' Tis frequently stated out where he was born that a rose is as weak as its shortest thorn : they spit like quarters and sleep_in their boots and anyone dies when somebody shoots and the sheriff arrives after everyone ' s went ; which isn ' t , perhaps , an environment where you would ( and I should ) expect to find overwhelming devotion to things of the mind . But when it rains chickens we ' ll all catch larks -- to borrow a phrase from Karl the Marks . As a child he was puny ; shrank_from noise hated the girls and mistrusted the boise , didn ' t like whiskey , learned to spell and generally seemed to be going_to hell ; so his parents , encouraged by desperation , gave him a classical education ( and went_to_sleep in their boots again out_in the land where women are main ) . You know the rest : a critic of note , a serious thinker , a lyrical pote , lectured on Art from west to east -- did sass-seyeity fall_for it ? Cheast ! if a dowager balked at our hero ' s verse he ' d knock her cold with a page from Jerse ; why , he used to say to his friends , he used &quot; for getting a debutante give me Prused &quot; and many ' s the heiress who ' s up and swooned after one canto by Ezra Pooned ( or -- to borrow a cadence from Karl the Marx -- a biting chipmunk never barx. ) But every bathtub will have its gin and one man ' s sister ' s another man ' s sin and a hand in the bush is a stitch in time and Aint It All A Bloody Shime and he suffered a fate which is worse than death and I don ' t allude to unpleasant breath . Our blooming hero awoke , one day , to find he had nothing whatever to say : which I might interpret ( just for fun ) as meaning the es of a be was dun and I mightn ' t think ( and you mightn ' t , too ) that a Five Year Plan ' s worth a Gay Pay Oo and both of us might irretrievably pause ere believing that Stalin is Santa Clause : which happily proves that neither of us is really an intellectual cus . For what did our intellectual do , when he found himself so empty and blo ? he pondered a while and he said , said he &quot; It ' s the social_system , it isn ' t me ! Not I am a fake , but America ' s phoney ! Not I am no artist , but Art ' s bologney ! Or -- briefly to paraphrase Karl the Marx -- ' The first law_of_nature is , trees will be parx. &quot; ' Now all_of you morons of sundry classes ( who read the Times and who buy the Masses ) if you don ' t profit by his career don ' t say Hoover gave nobody beer . For whoso conniveth at Lenin his dream shall dine upon bayonets , isn ' t and seam and a miss is as_good_as a mile is best for if you ' re not bourgeois you ' re Eddie Gest and wastelands live and waistlines die , which I very much hope it won ' t happen to eye ; or as comrade Shakespeare remarked of old All that Glisters Is Mike Gold ( but a rolling snowball gathers no sparks -- and the same hold true of Karl the Marks ) .
