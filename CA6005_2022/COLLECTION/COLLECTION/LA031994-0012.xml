   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO DOUBLE RUSSIA AID FOR DEFENSE PLANT CONVERSION ; EUROPE : A ' PRAGMATIC PARTNERSHIP ' IS CITED . PERRY TELLS MOSCOW THAT $ 20 MILLION WILL BE ADDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States will double the aid it has pledged for Russian defense conversion , allocating $ 20 million more to help weapons factories produce civilian goods in joint_ventures with U.S. companies , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry announced Friday . The increase in U.S. aid comes despite rising tensions between Moscow and Washington over espionage , the fate of economic reform and Russia ' s assertive new foreign_policy . Perry and his Russian hosts spoke different languages but used an identical phrase -- &quot; pragmatic partnership &quot; -- to describe the changing U.S-Russian relationship . The new program announced Friday aims to appease both American critics , who argue that aid to Russia would be_better spent at_home , and Russian industrialists , who are frustrated that long-promised Western aid and investment have yet to materialize . The grant money will be distributed through the U.S. firms -- thus ensuring that it is spent to convert weapons plants , not upgrade them -- to help defray start-up costs of ventures with ailing defense industries in Russia , Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Belarus . One such possible project , Perry said , is a venture to convert one of several advanced defense electronics plants -- that are now being privatized -- to build personal_computers for the Russian market . Russian officials suggested cooperation in commercial satellites , housing construction , air traffic_control and ticketing , and other civilian communication technologies . The program is designed to stimulate both the Russian and U.S. economies , while requiring most of the capital , labor and technology to be invested by the private sector and all_of the work to be performed by the two countries ' private sectors . The defense conversion pact was signed by Perry , Russian First Deputy Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin and First Deputy Economics Minister Valery Mikhailov on Friday as Perry wound_up a two-day visit to Moscow that included talks on destroying chemical and biological weapons and on Russia ' s role in negotiating a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina . The new U.S. defense_secretary also met with Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , though President Boris N . Yeltsin is vacationing on the Black_Sea and did not receive him . But even as Perry was delivering an upbeat assessment of his trip , Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev , in article headlined &quot; Don ' t Threaten Us , &quot; chastised Western politicians for treating Russia &quot; not as an equal partner but as a junior partner. &quot; &quot; Russia is destined to be a great_power , not a junior one , &quot; Kozyrev wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed piece published Friday . &quot; Under Communist or nationalist regimes , it would be an aggressive power , while under democratic rule it would be peaceful and prosperous . But in either case it would be a great power. &quot; Kozyrev warned of &quot; chauvinistic new banners that flap in the Washington wind &quot; and argued that &quot; there is simply no alternative to genuine partnership &quot; between Russia and the United States . In subtler fashion , Mikhailov also drove_home the notion that Russia will no longer play supplicant for Western aid . Even while noting that the defense conversion program had been discussed &quot; in an exceptionally amicable and cordial atmosphere , &quot; Mikhailov stressed that &quot; we are not talking_about assistance , but about cooperation and co-production. &quot; Perry pointedly spoke_of a &quot; special role &quot; for Russia in NATO ' s Partnership for Peace program , a loose military cooperation agreement for countries of the former Warsaw Pact and newly independent Soviet republics . After strongly objecting to its former satellites becoming members of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization before Russia does , Moscow agreed Thursday to submit a proposal to join the partnership by the end of the month . Perry said Russia , as the largest and most powerful member of the partnership , would naturally play a greater role in the Partnership for Peace . In a briefing for Western reporters Friday , Perry said the Partnership for Peace idea had been received favorably by about half the members_of_Parliament he had met with a day earlier . The Russian skeptics , he said , were much like American critics , some of whom favor cutting_off aid to Russia . Perry argued that both countries have an interest in cooperating on defense conversion , disarmament , military cooperation and prevention of nuclear proliferation .</TEXT>
