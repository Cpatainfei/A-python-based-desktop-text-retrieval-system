   <HEADLINE> NOURUZ ; AT LAST , CELEBRATING NEW YEAR ' S THE OLD WAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> March 20 is the ancient Persian New Year ' s Day , Nouruz . But Nouruz ( rhymes with &quot; no-lose &quot; ) is not the heritage of Iran alone . Many neighboring countries also celebrate it . Under the former Soviet regime , public celebration of Nouruz was outlawed in Central Asian republics such_as Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan . The holiday is of pre-Islamic origin , so it should have presented no threat to the Soviet_Union ' s official atheism , but the Communist authorities may have feared that any popular traditional holiday threatened their cultural hegemony and might serve as a rallying point for resistance . They had good reason for their apprehension . Stalin didn ' t manage to eliminate the last freedom fighters ( basmachis ) from Uzbekistan until the middle 1930s . By an irony of history , a number of basmachis took refuge in Afghanistan , where their sons and grandsons avenged them 50 years later in the Afghan War . Since the collapse of the Soviet_Union , the new republics of Central Asia have been falling all_over themselves to liberalize their cultural and religious policies . Mosques have been reopened ; pilgrimage to Mecca , though limited by quota , is now permitted . * And the New Year ' s festival ( the Central Asian pronunciation is Nauroz , rhyming with &quot; now rose &quot; ) has been ostentatiously legalized . Huge banners reading &quot; Have a Blessed Nauroz &quot; were still hanging_on public buildings in Tashkent last September , a good six months after the holiday . Ironically , at_the_same_time that the Central Asian_countries are finally able to celebrate this ancient Iranian holiday , Shiite authorities in Iran have been trying to suppress it because of its pagan origins . As a result , Iranians living_in our country often celebrate Nouruz with special fervor . In Uzbekistan , sidewalk booksellers now sell a pamphlet explaining how to make the traditional Nauroz dish called sumalak ( in Iran it ' s called samanu ) . Only a_few years ago it would have been a crime to publish the recipe . In the ' 70s , the Uzbek food writer Karim Makhmudov secretly made a videotape of the process of making sumalak because of the possibility that the tradition might be entirely lost one day ; his family still shows the place where they hid the tape . Like many Nauroz / Nouruz traditions , sumalak is pregnant with symbolism of springtime and new life . To make_it , you start sprouting a kilogram of wheat grains in a dark place a week or 10 days before Nauroz . The day before the holiday , you grind up the wheat grass and squeeze_out the juices . Then you boil the juices in a huge pot with four kilograms of flour , a little oil , water as needed and a handful of pebbles ( they bounce around in the pot and keep a burnt layer from building_up on the bottom ) . If you start cooking it about 8 p.m. , it should be done around mid-morning , 13 or 14 hours later . * The result is thick , brown and sweet . &quot; It is said , &quot; reads the sumalak pamphlet , &quot; that the more people taste your sumalak , the greater a good deed it is . That is to say , sumalak isn ' t just a Nauroz dish but a friendship event , and a friendship food blessing as well. &quot; With Nauroz / Nouruz coming this Saturday , it ' s a little late to start making sumalak / samanu now . Other traditional dishes for the holiday don ' t take so_much planning . They are based on either the first vegetables of spring or the last staples of the winter pantry : meat stewed with butter and whole wheat ( halim ) , carrot and cauliflower soup , a radish and cucumber salad garnished with dill and cilantro , mushrooms grilled on a skewer and little dumplings or ravioli filled with wild greens . * Spring herbs -- which can include wild greens such_as shepherd ' s purse and clover -- give a fresh and unusual flavor to these ravioli . The original recipe calls_for frying the filling in the tail fat of the local breed of sheep -- it ' s a soft fat , not hard and tallowy like ordinary lamb fat . In any case , it ' s obviously unavailable here , so this recipe substitutes butter . Sticklers for authenticity could mince a small piece of fat from a lamb chop and fry it to cracklings in the butter . NAUROZ RAVIOLI ( Kok Chuchwara ) 1 / 2 cup butter 1 / 2 pound onions , finely diced 1 bunch green_onions , finely chopped 2 pounds mixed spring greens , such_as mint , cilantro , cress , sorrel , clover , shepherd ' s purse and wild_spinach , all finely chopped 2 teaspoons salt Ground red_pepper Noodle Paste squares , or won ton skins , cut_in tiny squares 2 tablespoons melted butter Melt 1 / 2 cup butter in wide pan over low heat . Fry diced onions until tender . Add green_onions , mixed greens , salt and 2 teaspoons red_pepper . Cook until greens are tender and reduced in size . Remove greens and reduce pan liquid by at least half . Mix reduced liquid into cooked greens . Set_out Noodle Paste squares . Place filling_in center of 1 square . Lightly moisten square ' s edges . Fold square diagonally over filling to make triangle , pinch edges to seal , then fold opposite corners of triangle over each other and pinch together . Continue with remaining squares until filling is used_up . Cook ravioli in boiling water until done , 3 to 4 minutes . Using slotted spoon or colander , remove and drain ravioli . Place in warmed serving bowl . Toss with 2 tablespoons melted butter . Season to taste with red_pepper . Makes about 24 ravioli , or 4 to 6 servings .
