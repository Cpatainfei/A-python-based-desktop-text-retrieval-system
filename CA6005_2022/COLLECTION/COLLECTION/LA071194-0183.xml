   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; ' MOON_SHOT ' DETAILS APOLLO ADVENTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you have a sense of deja_vu during the two-part , four-hour &quot; Moon_Shot &quot; on TBS , it ' s probably because you saw Philip Kaufman ' s deliciously irreverent movie &quot; The Right Stuff , &quot; based on Tom Wolfe ' s book about the Mercury astronauts . Both films tend to magnetize your eye , as if you ' re seeing the daring ' 60s U.S. space project for the first time , and both are told from the astronauts ' point_of_view . The point_of_view in &quot; Moon_Shot &quot; is specifically test pilot-turned-spaceman Deke Slayton ' s , and it freely blends a Wisconsin farm_boy ' s crudeness with a military_man ' s sense of profound mission . This story is wrapped together in such a compelling package by producer-director Kirk Wolfinger that the post-moon shot generation might rightly wonder why U.S. manned space exploration was grounded after its greatest successes . Veteran astronauts Alan Shepard , Jim Lovell , Scott Carpenter and Stu Roosa wonder aloud too . The adventure depicted in &quot; Moon_Shot &quot; may have been propelled by the Cold_War competition with the Soviet_Union , but it also may mark the last time American technology is driven by a purely American romance of exploration . This is why Slayton ( whose words are spoken in narrator Barry Corbin ' s wry , gravelly drawl ) is the ideal voice for the adventure . The test_pilots picked by NASA for the Mercury mission were high-tech rough_riders , and tended to buck authority when they felt_like it . Not all_of the Mercury men were Slayton ' s kind of tough breed , though , and he describes a deep internal competition as strong as the Soviet rivalry . * Like &quot; The Right Stuff , &quot; &quot; Moon_Shot &quot; becomes very special stuff as it reveals the personal dramas behind the carefully designed public relations facade : How John_Glenn ' s squeaky-clean image bugged some of the guys ; how Gus Grissom ' s near-fatal Mercury landing dogged him until his tragic death on the Apollo launch_pad ; how Frank Borman ' s wife planned his funeral without letting him know ; how many of the men hung_around and slept_with astronaut groupies ; how Wally Schirra brazenly disobeyed orders during the Apollo 7 flight ( and how it led him to do a commercial for Actifed ) . While &quot; Moon_Shot &quot; disturbs the heroic image of astronauts with plenty of glimpses of their all-too-human flaws , another program on the first American with lunar dreams -- the Disney Channel ' s &quot; A Moon Man From Massachusetts : The Robert Goddard Story &quot; -- is plain old bland TV biography . Goddard developed the first liquid-fueled rockets and the engineering that permitted space rocketry , and his story has some of the hubris described in &quot; Moon Shot. &quot; But here , the most excitement comes from Goddard ' s problems with Nazi spies gaining access to his rocket plans ; the real excitement of the Goddard story -- in stretching the bounds of physics and the imagination -- never comes_across . &quot; Moon_Shot &quot; airs on TBS at 7:05 p.m. tonight and Wednesday . &quot; A Moon Man From Massachusetts &quot; airs 9 p.m. Tuesday on the Disney Channel .
