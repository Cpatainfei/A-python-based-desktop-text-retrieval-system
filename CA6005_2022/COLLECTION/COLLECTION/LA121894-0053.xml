   <HEADLINE> SIMON BOLIVAR STILL STIRS PASSIONS 164 YEARS LATER ; HISTORY : WHEN AN UNFLATTERING PAINTING OF THE REVOLUTIONARY HERO WAS INCLUDED IN AN EXHIBITION AT A LONDON GALLERY , SOUTH_AMERICANS WERE INCENSED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Simon Bolivar died 164 years ago , but the passion of South_Americans for &quot; The Liberator &quot; still burns hotly and is not to be trifled with . When an unflattering painting depicting the revolutionary hero as partly clothed with female breasts and making an obscene gesture was included in an exhibition at a London gallery , South_Americans were incensed . Venezuelans massed at their native son ' s imposing statue near Congress in August and demanded the painting by Chilean artist Juan Davila be burned . Diplomats from Colombia , Ecuador and Bolivia protested to Chile ' s government , which also criticized the artwork . The flap was front-page news . &quot; I ' m crying because it hurts me , &quot; a housewife , Aurora Pineda , screamed into a megaphone at the Caracas demonstration . &quot; It ' s not right that the father of our country be mocked. &quot; University_student Litdell Diaz also spoke : &quot; My dignity is offended . Bolivar is here . He ' s not dead . He ' s in each one of his children. &quot; The man who led five South_American_nations to independence from Spain , and dreamed of creating a sort of United States of South_America , is much more_than a dusty historical figure . His deeds and thoughts resonate in Bolivia , which was named for him , and in Colombia , Peru and Ecuador . But they are felt perhaps most of all_in this Caribbean nation where he was born in 1783 and which still laments his lonely flight to exile and early death at age 47 . &quot; The cult of Bolivar is the main reason for unity among Venezuelans , &quot; former President Ramon J . Velasquez , a historian , said in an interview . &quot; His ideas are still current . They ' re not just something you go_to the library to read about. &quot; Venezuela ' s current president , Rafael Caldera , also is a Bolivar fan . In an essay published last June , he saluted Bolivar for being the &quot; highest expression &quot; of Venezuela ' s values and an inspiration for its constitution . &quot; He was a great romantic dreamer , but he was also a man_of_action , and he didn ' t subjugate an entire continent as Napoleon did -- he liberated it , &quot; said British filmmaker Michael Cooper , who plans an epic movie that he hopes will thrust Bolivar back into the spotlight outside South_America . Cooper promises his film will reflect the grandeur of Bolivar and his accomplishments , but South_Americans are wary . Many feel Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez tarnished Bolivar ' s reputation with &quot; The General in His Labyrinth. &quot; That best-selling 1989 novel depicted Bolivar in his final days as rejected and bitter . Anything less than a glowing tribute is likely to mean trouble for Cooper . He acknowledges he faces the same situation that American director Oliver Stone confronted in trying to film a version of the play &quot; Evita , &quot; about the famed wife of the 1940s and ' 50s Argentine leader Juan Peron . Some Argentines consider her a saint for her work for the poor . So when President Carlos Menem of Argentina found_out the movie might depict her as power-hungry and promiscuous , Stone was blocked from filming at government buildings . He ended_up shelving the project . Bolivar portraits are ubiquitous in Venezuela . The standard one , a reproduction of an 1825 oil_painting , shows him standing confidently with one gloved hand tucked into a tight military waistcoat , the other gripping a sword in a decorated scabbard , looking serenely content , a man of destiny . On his birthday , July 24 , newspapers still publish his portrait on the front page . Venezuelans can tell you the year he died , 1830 . The exact date , too : Dec . 17 . It ' s a national_holiday . So is his birthday . In most every city and village , &quot; Liberator &quot; avenue is a main thoroughfare , and a well-tended Bolivar Plaza is located outside a prominent church , government building or military base .</TEXT>
