   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; QUAKE GIVES_RISE TO BRIEF POLITICAL UNITY ; AID : STATE ' S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION AND SACRAMENTO OFFICIALS OF BOTH PARTIES MEET IN WASHINGTON TO PUSH FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE . BUT RIFTS QUICKLY EMERGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The biggest names in California politics turned momentarily chummy Tuesday as they squeezed in shoulder-to-shoulder at a news_conference to put aside partisan bickering and push for billions of dollars in earthquake relief funds . But , as is often the case with the diverse California delegation , it took only a_few minutes -- and several prodding questions from reporters -- to jolt the unanimity like a sharp aftershock . First , a fissure developed between Republican and Democratic lawmakers over a proposal to bar illegal immigrants from receiving earthquake assistance . Then , Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi blasted Treasurer Kathleen Brown , his opponent in the upcoming Democratic gubernatorial primary , and Republican Gov . Pete Wilson for refusing to acknowledge the need to raise state taxes in an election year to rebuild Southern California . &quot; Anybody who says we are going_to do this without a temporary tax increase is either a fool or a liar , &quot; Garamendi fumed . California Democrats in the House also privately accused Wilson of playing election-year politics when he focused_on illegal immigration instead of on securing earthquake assistance during a closed-door breakfast meeting . Amid the political rumblings , about 30 California Democrats and Republicans from Washington and Sacramento expressed optimism that they will succeed in passing President Clinton ' s $ 8.6-billion aid package through Congress and generate matching funds to meet the state ' s obligation . &quot; Natural disasters are not a political event , &quot; the state ' s leaders said in a joint statement . &quot; They strike Democrats and Republicans alike . That is why we are here today in a show of strong bipartisan support. &quot; After their meeting in the elegant Rayburn House office_building , the elected officials paraded to a nearby committee room filled with reporters . The Californians looked as if they were posing for a reunion photo as they uneasily crowded together before television_cameras . Wilson , the former Marine , stood ramrod-straight between Democrats Kathleen Brown and Garamendi , who are vying for the chance to knock_off Wilson in November . Assembly Speaker Willie Brown , no soul_mate of the governor ' s , also flew cross_country to join the festivities . Directly behind the governor were Sen . Barbara Boxer and Sen . Dianne Feinstein , who lost a bitterly contested race to Wilson in 1990 . Nearby was Rep . Jerry Lewis ( R-Redlands ) , who has feuded openly with Feinstein over legislation to protect the California desert . Rep . Don Edwards ( D-San Jose ) , the retiring dean of the congressional delegation , reported that the California leaders had emerged from &quot; a very friendly &quot; meeting at which they agreed to mobilize support for quake relief . &quot; It ' s going_to take a lot of hard work to pass the bill . It is essential that California be united . We are united. &quot; Before long , however , the unified front began to crumble . Some Democrats left the news_conference seething at Wilson for devoting less than 10 minutes of the hourlong meeting to the Northridge earthquake . Instead , the governor concentrated_on his crusade to get the federal_government to reimburse California $ 3 billion this year for the cost of providing services to illegal immigrants . &quot; It was just beyond my comprehension , &quot; said one prominent California House Democrat , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . &quot; If the people in Los Angeles were watching this , they would not fathom it . Two hundred_thousand people are suffering from the California earthquake and we are talking_about immigration . It is just mind-boggling. &quot; At the press_conference , efforts to maintain the cooperative spirit were sidetracked when Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) was asked about his proposed legislation to keep illegal immigrants from receiving earthquake assistance . &quot; I hate to be the skunk at the lawn_party here , &quot; he said . The &quot; illegal alien problem &quot; in California , Rohrabacher said , is breaking the state ' s budget . &quot; Providing millions , perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars , worth of aid for people who are here illegally . . . is ridiculous. &quot; Most members of the California congressional delegation have come_to expect explosive remarks from Rohrabacher . But his statements about immigrants proved too_much for freshman Rep . Xavier Becerra ( D-Los Angeles ) , who shook his head in disgust as he approached the podium . Becerra , visibly upset with Rohrabacher , said : &quot; It does damage to the California delegation and all representatives for us to say that the undocumented are breaking the back of California . . . . This is a time now to look_at every human_being in this country , particularly in Los Angeles , who is in need as a result of this disaster. &quot; Moments later , Wilson tweaked Garamendi and Kathleen Brown for their dispute over the need to raise state taxes and their lack of authority in deciding the issue . &quot; I must tell you , &quot; Wilson told reporters with tongue partly in cheek , &quot; I bitterly resent your efforts to try to divide the treasurer and the insurance commissioner , who disagree strongly on this . I think that in decency you should allow them to go_back to California and find_out the magnitude of the numbers . Then they can argue about it . Those of us who actually make the decision , the Legislature and myself , can be advised. &quot; The presence of the two Democratic candidates for governor also was questioned by Speaker Willie Brown . &quot; Kathleen and John were pretty much nonexistent in that room , &quot; Brown said of the breakfast meeting . &quot; They didn ' t say anything . They were just there . Period . And I don ' t know what either one of them ( is ) doing back here. &quot; Other partisan differences surfaced when Rep . Randy Cunningham ( R-San Diego ) served notice that Republicans intend to demand a vote on forcing Congress to find cuts_to offset the earthquake package . But before Cunningham could elaborate , Edwards cut him off and abruptly ended the news_conference .</TEXT>
