   <TEXT> HURRICANES LOSE STEAM , AGGIES NEW KINGS AT_HOME Washington stormed into Miami and ended the Hurricanes ' NCAA record 58-game home winning streak . While Miami is forced to start over , Texas A &amp; M becomes the new owner of the nation ' s longest home winning streak . The Aggies defeated Southern Mississippi , 41-17 , winning their 22nd in a row at College Station , Tex . MCNAIR TAKES TO AIR AGAIN , BUT HE MIGHT BE GROUNDED Alcorn State ' s Steve ( Air ) McNair lived_up_to his nickname again on Saturday , completing 33 of 56 passes for 395 yards and two touchdowns in a 48-23 loss to Sam Houston State . But McNair ' s bid to become the first Division I-AA player to win the Heisman Trophy might have suffered a blow . The quarterback suffered a slightly separated shoulder during Saturday ' s game and left with his throwing arm in a sling with about 10 minutes to play . &quot; I don ' t know exactly when it happened , &quot; McNair said . &quot; I took a lot of hits . . . some that I thought were unnecessary shots. &quot; It was not immediately known if or for for how long McNair might be sidelined . THE FIX WAS DEFINITELY IN -- THREE TIMES IN FIRST_HALF Aaron Fix returned three punts for touchdowns in the first_half , setting an NCAA Division I record and helping Canisius to a 28-7 victory over Siena . The three returns broke the Division I-A and I-AA records of two set by many players . The last time it was accomplished at the I-AA level was in 1985 by Sebron Spivey of Southern Illinois in a game against Southeast Missouri State . Fix finished with 200 yards in punt returns , an interception for 18 yards and a kickoff return for 27 yards . He also set a Division I-AA mark for average yards per punt return with 40 . The old record of 30.9 yards was set by Gary Harrell of Howard University against Morgan State in 1990 . EVEN WITH WATER_BOY , THEY COULD HAVE POURED IT ON Nebraska ' s goal was not to run_up the score against Pacific , but to play as_many people as possible . The Cornhuskers accomplished that goal . Included were backup quarterbacks Adam Kucera , who started fall camp as a team trainer , and Ryan Held , a freshman split_end who was switched to quarterback about 10 days ago . &quot; I think we got them all_in today , &quot; Osborne said . &quot; Should be about 110 players . we ' ll never have more play than we did today. &quot; All of them -- notably backup quarterback Brook Berringer , who threw for three touchdowns and ran_for another -- helped overwhelm Pacific . The Cornhuskers scored the first seven times they touched the ball and cruised to a 70-21 victory . TESTING THE WATERS , THEY WERE IN OVER THEIR HEADS Alabama Birmingham , having played as a club sport as recently as 1989 , is trying to make the transition to major college football . The Division I-AA Blazers are scheduled to join Division I-A in 1996 , and they tested their team against Kansas on Saturday . The Blazers were routed , 72-0 , and shut_out for the first time in 32 games . Kansas put_up its biggest margin since beating South_Dakota State , 86-6 , in 1947 . COUGARS VERY MUCH WORSE FOR WARE How times have changed at Houston . The Cougars , who five years ago averaged 54 points a game with Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware at quarterback , have scored 20 or fewer points in four losses this season while giving_up 135 points . Ohio State got more_than one-third of those points Saturday while routing the Cougars , 52-0 . Houston was shut_out for the second game in a row for the first time since 1965 . It was the most lopsided shutout by Ohio State since a 63-0 victory over Northwestern in 1980 . &quot; Houston is not the best team we ' re going to play this year , &quot; Buckeye quarterback Bob Hoying said . FRY AS HE MIGHT , HE can ' t ESCAPE THE PAC-10 HEAT Iowa Coach Hayden Fry was sure his Hawkeyes would finally get_the_best of the Pacific 10 . &quot; we ' ll be more in our class against Oregon , &quot; Fry had said . Hardly . The Ducks took_advantage of several Iowa mistakes and won , 40-18 . Since coming_to Iowa in 1979 , Fry is 3-7 against the Pac-10 . Among the losses was a 44-6 setback to the Ducks , in Iowa , five years ago . His most recent Pac-10 foe was California , which beat Iowa , 37-3 , in last season ' s Alamo Bowl . we ' ll PUT NEW REPLAY UP AGAINST OLD REPLAY Kordell Stewart ' s last-second desperation pass in Colorado ' s victory over Michigan brought_back memories of Doug Flutie ' s bomb that beat Miami 10 years ago . What did Flutie think_of Stewart ' s performance ? &quot; I haven ' t seen it , but that ' s sweet , &quot; Flutie said Saturday night after his four touchdown passes helped Calgary beat Sacramento , 39-25 , in the Canadian Football_League . &quot; I ' ll have to go and see all_the replays tomorrow. &quot; HAVING TAKEN A WAC , THEY ' RE BACK IN THE PAC After opening-season losses against Hawaii and San Diego State , California began play in the Pacific 10 Conference and came_out a winner . The Golden Bears edged Arizona State , 25-21 . &quot; This win means everything , &quot; Cal quarterback Dave Barr said . &quot; I can ' t imagine what another week would have been like if we would have lost. &quot; NOTEWORTHY Tennessee freshman Peyton Manning , son of former NFL star Archie Manning , came_off the bench to throw two touchdown passes in a 24-21 loss to Mississippi State . . . . Brigham Young Coach LaVell Edwards won his 200th game . With the 49-47 victory over New Mexico , Edwards improves to 200-74-3 in his 23rd season with BYU . . . . Tyrone Wheatley of Michigan scored his 41st career touchdown , breaking Anthony Carter ' s school record in a 27-26 loss to Colorado . . . . Maryland put_together its first winning_streak since 1990 by beating Wake Forest , 31-7 . The Terrapins , who beat West_Virginia last week , hadn ' t won two in a row since defeating Wake Forest and Duke in October 1990 . . . . Freshman Kyle Bryant ' s 61-yard field_goal for Texas A &amp; M was the second-longest since the NCAA banned the use of kicking tees in 1989 . Jason Hansen of Washington State had a 62-yarder against Nevada-Las Vegas in 1991 . Penn State ' s Bobby Engram caught eight passes for 200 yards in a 55-27 victory over Rutgers . . . . Robert Morris , playing its first season of football , improved to 4-0 with a 28-0 victory over Gannon . The Colonials are coached by Joe Walton , former head coach of the New York Jets . . . . Dick Tomey became the second-winningest coach at Arizona , with 49 victories . Pop McKale had 60 as coach of the Wildcats from 1914-30 . . . . Stanford ' s Steve Stenstrom threw a touchdown pass to Tony Cline with 4:16 left in the first_half against Arizona , giving him 61 touchdown passes , second in Pac-10 history to John Elway ' s 77 . Stenstrom had been tied with former Oregon quarterback Bill Musgrave with 60 touchdown passes . . . . Air_Force racked_up a school-record 700 yards while defeated Texas-El Paso , 47-7 . NEWSWORTHY A former Texas A &amp; M band member collapsed during a performance of the alumni band at halftime of Saturday ' s game between the Aggies and Southern Mississippi . Jack W . Jernigan , 59 , was listed in critical condition at St . Joseph ' s Hospital in Bryan , Tex . He collapsed near the end of the performance as the former band members played_on the field with the current marching band . NO HAIL_MARY FOR ABC Not only did ABC give Los Angeles a dog of a game in Arizona-Stanford , the network also deprived this market of seeing the incredible finish of Colorado ' s 27-26 victory over Michigan . Nothing prevented ABC from switching_off Arizona-Stanford to either Colorado-Michigan or Washington-Miami , according to ABC spokesman Mark Mandell . But ABC stuck_with Arizona-Stanford until it ended at about 4 p.m. &quot; It ' s a judgment call , &quot; Mandell said . &quot; We ' ve had success with our regional coverage , and we try not to leave a game in_progress . When the Arizona-Stanford game ended , Michigan had a 12-point lead , so we went_to local programming. &quot; Colorado ' s Hail_Mary pass came_about 15 minutes later . About half the country saw it live , and 36 % of the country watching the end of the Washington-Miami game got a replay within seconds . QUOTEWORTHY &quot; I didn ' t think he could throw that far. &quot; -- Colorado Coach Bill McCartney , on Stewart ' s 64-yard Hail_Mary pass_on the final play , giving the Buffaloes a 27-26 victory over Michigan . &quot; That was a nightmare to say the least . We just got ourselves beat good . We got a rump-kicking. &quot; -- Indiana Coach Bill Mallory , after the Hoosiers ' 62-13 loss to Wisconsin . &quot; It ' s tough when they ' re breathing down in your face. &quot; -- Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom , who was sacked seven times by Arizona during a 34-10 loss to the Wildcats . &quot; We didn ' t come_in thinking we couldn ' t win , but I think we were realistic about it. &quot; -- East Tennessee State Coach Mike Cavan , on his Division I-AA Buccaneers ' game against Auburn . The Tigers won , 38-0 , extending the nation ' s longest_Division I winning streak to 15 games .</TEXT>
