   <HEADLINE> A BITING PROBLEM ; OFFICIALS SAY POPULAR DOG BREEDS CAN POSE DANGER TO CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scores of stitches later , the first-grader who used to look just like his father still loves the former playmate who suddenly , inexplicably , tried to kill him . But the 70-pound family dog , a flash of tooth and muzzle whose Japanese ancestors were bred to hunt bears , was put_to_sleep , while surgeons did their magic on the 6-year-old Ventura boy ' s face . &quot; I ' ll never forget that one , &quot; said Richard Lambert , a Ventura County animal control officer who took the year-old Akita into custody after the Sept . 24 attack . &quot; We ' re not talking_about a stray dog , a sick dog , but a family pet. &quot; Across the county , across the country , officials are finding that the dog breed of the moment too often becomes the mauler of tomorrow , in part because breeders rushing to meet surging market demand have compromised some dogs ' genetic integrity . Too often , the victims are trusting children . &quot; Dog_bites are the most commonly reported childhood health_problem in the United States , &quot; said Rachel Lamb , a Humane Society spokeswoman in Washington , D.C. In Ventura County , Animal Regulation Department statistics over the last 13 months indicate German_shepherds and chow_chows are the most likely to bite , followed by pit bulls , Rottweilers and -- a little farther down the list -- Akitas . &quot; I would say that 90 % of the ( serious ) bites are involving those dogs , the chows , the Akitas , the Rottweilers , &quot; said Kathy Jenks , county director of animal regulation . She speculated that German_shepherds might head the list because they far outnumber the more notorious dogs . Also found to be frequent biters , however , are cocker_spaniels , Labrador_retrievers and springer_spaniels , certainly not the breeds a layman might consider dangerous . &quot; We ' re destroying breeds , &quot; said Debbie Inglis , owner of Inglis Pet Hotel in Oxnard and a longtime dog breeder . &quot; There are some reputable breeders , of course , &quot; she said . &quot; But there are too many back-yard breeders and others out there , especially with popular dogs . It takes years to learn bloodlines , but these people aren ' t waiting for that . They ' re in too_much of a hurry . . . , and so less attention is paid too quality_control . &quot; The more over-bred the dog becomes , the more we ' re seeing problems among them . We ' re even seeing golden_retrievers now who are biters . ( And ) Dalmatians . . . are showing_up to do more biting. &quot; Some breeders are even inbreeding families of dogs , mating parents with offspring and brothers with sisters , she said . * Although eighth on the list -- in part because there are so few of them -- Akitas are emerging as a concern because of a genetic_disorder that is spreading through their rising population . The disorder can make the dogs ill-tempered and unpredictable , said W . Jean Dodd , an Irvine veterinarian and immunologist . &quot; ( Akitas ) have been turned_into something that they were never intended to be , &quot; said Thousand Oaks resident Barbara Bouyet , 45 , national coordinator for the Akita Rescue Society of America . &quot; They ' re breeding these dogs for money , and they give no thought to the outcome or the damage it does to children. &quot; Name the breed -- Doberman_pinscher , boxer , even Irish_setter -- and observers have found that temperament problems accompanied each group ' s burgeoning popularity and resultant population explosion , said Inglis , who has bred German_shepherds for 18 years . &quot; Fifteen to 20 years ago , the Saint Bernard was a very loving dog , &quot; she added , &quot; but they became over-bred and ( many ) became very vicious dogs. &quot; Overwhelmingly , the victims of dog_bites are children -- an estimated 1.8 million nationwide last year , according to the Humane Society of the United States . Nine children were killed by dogs in 1993 and 11 so far this year , including 5-year-old girl who was mauled by a Rottweiler Oct . 23 in Colorado . Although there is no recorded fatal dog attack in Ventura County history , the mauling on Sept . 24 came_close . &quot; I believe that dog was going_to try to kill that kid , &quot; said Officer Lambert , referring to the attack in which a baby-sitter pulled the Akita off Jeffrey Landry before it could inflict more injury . Naturally curious , incautious and small -- with their eyes at the dog ' s own level -- children often are mistaken by the animals as a challenge for dominance or as a nuisance that can be corrected with a bite , with little risk of retaliation by the child . Male animals that are not neutered are three times more likely to bite than other dogs . Lamb , who attributed most bites to irresponsible dog owners , said adults should teach children proper precautions with dogs and never leave them alone with certain breeds , such_as Rottweilers and Akitas . Deceptively cute as puppies -- hence their popularity -- Akitas have long served as protectors and nannies to children in their native Japan . But the genetic_disorder that has infiltrated their ranks in America -- which Dodd linked to dietary changes , careless breeding and perhaps even to nuclear fallout after the atomic bombing of Nagasaki , Japan , in 1945 -- has left some Akitas prone to unpredictable bursts of violence . One example is the Sept . 24 attack . Since joining the family as a puppy last fall , the Akita named Bear had romped the house with Jeffrey and his 4-year-old sister , Kassandra , under the parents ' watchful supervision , father Alan Landry said . He said the boy even rode_on the dog ' s back . But while Alan and Kim Landry attended a wedding that Saturday afternoon , Bear , without warning , knocked the boy to the concrete patio as he was leading the dog by the collar to the back-yard dog-run , the father said . Kassandra was playing_on the grass nearby . Rachel Szatkowski , 19 , the baby-sitter , rushed to the boy ' s aid and was bitten on the left forearm while pulling the dog off the child , Ventura firefighter Vern Alstot said . He said the boy ' s head and face had been severely mauled . &quot; I never knew or had any idea that something like this could happen , &quot; Alan Landry said . &quot; The ( books ) we bought told us they were a great family dog . . . . ( But ) if people could see what I saw and go_through what we went_through , they would n ' t have a dog like that , period , as long as they have kids. &quot; The dog , which was euthanized while the boy was undergoing four hours of plastic_surgery , is one of three Akitas killed since Jan . 1 by county officials after dog attacks . So far this year , Akitas in the county have attacked 16 children , including three 2-year-olds who were bitten on the face . A 22-month-old girl was killed by an Akita last year in St . Louis , Mo . In Japan , where Akitas have been the national dog since 1931 and their line is strictly monitored , the animals are more temperate with humans and more predictable , Bouyet said . They originally were bred to guard emperors and to hunt and fight other dogs . Anastazya Tomoko Wada-Mellor , 29 , who grew_up Chigasaki , Japan , said Akitas served as nannies for her and her brothers from infancy on . &quot; They baby-sat us , literally , &quot; she said . But Wada-Mellor , a member of Bouyet ' s Akita Rescue group , said she will not get an Akita here because of the behavioral disorders so rampant in their American population . Bouyet said the hypothyroid disease that can trigger aggressive behavior among Akitas can be countered with hormone treatment . The genetically related disease afflicts about 70 % of the Akita breed and can usually be detected with a simple blood_test , she said . &quot; The public isn ' t aware that these ( blood ) screenings are vitally important , &quot; Bouyet added . &quot; The public doesn ' t demand it because they don ' t know it. &quot; Lamb , whose Humane Society estimates there are 2 million to 3 million reported dog_bites each year nationwide , said , &quot; What we find is that the breeds that attack depend_on the whim of the market. &quot; Although the county bite totals do not reflect a particular breed ' s estimated share of the dog population -- Labradors far outnumber chow_chows , for example -- the statistics do resemble lists compiled elsewhere , such_as in Palm Beach , Fla. , and Denver . * Similarly , five animal behaviorists , asked by a pet industry magazine to identify the most troublesome of the 134 recognized dog breeds , chose Akitas , chow_chows , Rottweilers , Shar-Peis and Dalmatians , in that order . The first three accounted_for a disproportionate number of bites -- 159 -- in the past 13 months in Ventura County . While such breeds as cocker_spaniels might score high on bite lists , they are of less concern , authorities say , because their bites are less severe and they are house dogs that tend to be exposed to more people . Chow_chows , Akitas and Rottweilers , on the other hand , typically have fewer opportunities to bite . &quot; What we ' re seeing is personality_disorders due_to poor breeding , dogs that can be extremely neurotic and extremely fearing ( of people ) , &quot; said Liz Palika , an Oceanside dog trainer who participated in the magazine survey . Although the American Kennel Club has set specific standards for size , shape and other physical traits of dogs , it has remained largely vague or even mute on disposition by breed , said Deena Case-Pall , a Camarillo-based psychologist and animal behaviorist . Driven to meet suddenly skyrocketing demand , some &quot; puppy mills &quot; are inbreeding their animals and churning_out dogs by mating within families , Inglis said . &quot; People just don ' t always look_at themselves as being craftsmen when they breed dogs , &quot; Case-Pall said . &quot; If you can put an egg and sperm together , you ' re a breeder , if by accident or on purpose. &quot; Not only can this muddy bloodlines and amplify genetic defects already appearing in some breeds , but it can also compound the risks faced by children . Citing a study by the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control , Case-Pall said that a child by age 14 has a nearly 50 % chance of suffering a serious dog_bite . Most involve a known canine , like a neighbor ' s dog , she said , and the second most common bites are by children ' s own pets . Canines , whether poodles or Pekingese , are creatures of the pack and accordingly settle themselves into some niche in the group hierarchy , whether the group is canine or human , the county ' s Jenks said . A child ' s lunge to hug a dog is , to some animals , a blatant effort to displace the dog in the social strata of the pack -- where the diminutive child typically is at the bottom -- and must be opposed with a snap , she said .
