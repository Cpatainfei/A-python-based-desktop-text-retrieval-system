   <HEADLINE> CLINTON REJECTS GATT VOTE DEAL ; POLITICS : PRESIDENT SAYS HE WILL NOT BACK A TAX CUT ON CAPITAL_GAINS IN EXCHANGE FOR DOLE ' S SUPPORT OF THE GLOBAL TRADE ACCORD . HE ALSO OPPOSES SCHOOL PRAYER AMENDMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , still battling to secure congressional approval of a new global trade agreement , declared one potential deal off-limits Tuesday , flatly rejecting a Republican effort to link the trade accord to a capital_gains tax cut . Addressing for the first time the capital_gains horse_trade suggested by incoming Senate Majority_Leader Bob Dole , Clinton expressed optimism that he would be able to reconcile his differences with the Kansas Republican . But even if the two men come_to terms , he said , the GOP-backed tax cut would not be part of the bargain . &quot; I disagree that there should be some deal cut regarding capital_gains , &quot; Clinton said during a news_conference in the Old Executive Office_Building adjacent to the White_House . &quot; I don ' t think that ' s the right thing to do. &quot; The pact , which would create a World Trade Organization as a successor to the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as the referee for the global trading system , &quot; is an important agreement on its own merits , &quot; the President said . By gradually reducing protectionist tariffs that limit commerce between nations , the expanded trade agreement would stimulate economic_growth and job creation in America , he said . &quot; Everyone concedes it will lead to hundreds of thousands of jobs , &quot; Clinton asserted . With President Leonid D . Kuchma of Ukraine at his side , Clinton sought to delineate under what circumstances he would be willing to compromise with the new Republican leaders of the House and Senate , and under what circumstances he would resist . He said that he would fight any move to pass a constitutional amendment providing_for school prayer . Similarly , he promised to resist moves to repeal handgun purchase restrictions , the new ban on some assault weapons and the new law requiring companies to provide unpaid family leave to employees . Clinton considers all three measures centerpieces of the first two years of his presidency . But all three face likely attack by the new Republican congressional majority . The President expressed confidence that he and congressional Republicans would be able to cooperate on efforts to restrict lobbying practices , reform campaign finances and give states more flexibility over the federal programs that they administer . Yet a compromise continued to elude Clinton on his most pressing legislative objective : approval of the GATT accord during a special lame-duck session of Congress set to begin Tuesday . Unless the pact is endorsed by Congress before the end of the year , many trade specialists contend , the 124-nation agreement could unravel . Many signatory nations are awaiting the outcome of next week ' s congressional debate before taking final action on the accord . While the House is widely expected to approve the trade accord , its prospects appear dicey in the Senate . A White_House vote count taken Tuesday indicated that 26 senators , including Dole , remain undecided . Another 14 were said to be leaning_against the pact . Although Republicans traditionally have supported tariff reductions , the politics of trade has become more polarized since Election_Day . Clinton is trying to win the support of middle-of-the-road Republicans and Democrats while Dole holds_back his own crucial backing . Dole suggested Sunday that he would be more likely to support GATT if the White_House agreed to an accounting change to make_it easier for the Republicans to seek passage of a capital_gains tax cut . A longstanding GOP legislative objective , the capital_gains measure would reduce taxes paid by investors , landowners , entrepreneurs and businesses on profits from sales of stocks , bonds , real_estate and other assets . By introducing the tax measure into the trade debate , Dole put Clinton in a political bind . Yielding on capital_gains would cost the President support among his Democratic base while providing only questionable support from Republicans , a senior Administration official said . So far , Dole ' s suggestion has not produced a capital_gains groundswell . Sen . Phil Gramm of Texas , who is expected to challenge Dole for the GOP presidential nomination in 1996 , said that Dole ' s effort to link the trade plan to the tax cut &quot; is not a good pairing. &quot; Besides pressing the capital_gains issue , Dole has suggested other concessions that might win his support for the trade accord . One would involve establishing a procedure for Congress to monitor the actions of the World Trade Organization . Dole and a diverse group of opponents , ranging from conservative firebrand Patrick J . Buchanan to consumer activist Ralph Nader have expressed concern that the trade organization would be able to overrule U.S. laws that protect the environment , labor and public health and safety . One trade official said that Dole seemed close to accepting a plan under which a group of retired U.S. judges would determine whether the global trade body treats U.S. interests fairly . If the judges believed that it did not , Congress presumably could vote to withdraw from the organization . Administration officials said that more talks between Dole and a Clinton team including U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen would be needed before they would be convinced that they could count_on Dole ' s support . The Senate leader ' s vote is considered critical because it would provide cover_for other Republicans who are anxious about supporting Clinton . Yet even as they worked toward reconciliation with Dole , White_House officials suffered a setback when Sen . Robert C . Byrd of West_Virginia , the Senate ' s senior Democrat , said that he would try to use parliamentary_procedures to defeat the trade plan -- or at least delay it . Senate Finance_Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) said that he could count only 41 senators favoring or leaning strongly toward supporting the agreement . That would leave it 19 votes short of the 60 needed to win a crucial procedural vote . Meanwhile , Clinton tried to clarify his view on school prayer , which he had muddied with remarks at a press_conference last week in Indonesia . Saying that he was tired when he appeared to endorse a constitutional amendment making prayer or a moment of silence legal in schools , Clinton said that he opposes such an amendment as &quot; inherently coercive. &quot; &quot; I have always supported a moment of silence , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; When I was a governor , I supported the moment of silence legislation . I do not believe that we should have a constitutional amendment to carve out and legalize teacher- or student-led prayer in the classroom . . . . &quot; In a related development , a coalition of religious groups delivered a letter to Clinton opposing a school prayer amendment . The organizations , which include Christian , Jewish and Muslim groups , said that the proposed constitutional change would weaken separation of church and state while drawing unnecessary attention to children who refuse to take_part in the prayer . Times staff writers Ronald Brownstein and Aaron Nathans contributed to this story . * ' CORPORATE WELFARE ' : Labor_secretary urges GOP to trim business tax_breaks .
