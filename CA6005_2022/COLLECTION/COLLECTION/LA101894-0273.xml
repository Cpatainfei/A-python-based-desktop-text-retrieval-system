   <HEADLINE> KRAFT SELLING ITS BUDGET GOURMET UNIT TO HEINZ ; FROZEN FOOD : SPOKESMAN FOR BUYER UNSURE OF PLANS FOR ORANGE HEADQUARTERS . HE SAYS ACQUISITION WILL COMPLEMENT ITS WEIGHT WATCHER LINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kraft General Foods Inc. agreed Monday to sell All American Gourmet Co . of Orange , maker of the popular Budget Gourmet line of frozen_food , to H.J. Heinz Co . Terms of the deal were not disclosed . A Heinz spokesman said he was unaware of any immediate plans for All American ' s Orange County headquarters , where 89 executives and other workers are employed . The company has total employment of about 1 # 000 . &quot; They haven ' t gotten_around_to the organizational details , &quot; explained Heinz spokesman D . Edward I . Smyth . The frozen foods are packaged at plants in Clearfield , Utah , and in Atlanta . Smyth said that Heinz is excited about the acquisition because it complements its other product_lines . By combining raw_materials , packaging and shipping with Heinz ' s other frozen foods , the Pittsburgh-based food giant hopes to wring more profit from the Budget Gourmet line . &quot; This acquisition gives Heinz another major brand -- the Budget Gourmet -- to complement its Weight Watcher brand in the growing frozen-meals category , &quot; said Heinz Senior_Vice_President David W . Sculley . The All American unit will report to Michael McGrath , president of the Weight Watcher Food Co . division of Heinz . Smyth said that McGrath was one of the founders of the Budget Gourmet brand a decade ago before coming_over to Heinz . The two lines are complementary , he said , because Budget Gourmet is popular in the West , while Weight Watcher frozen foods are strongest in the East . Budget Gourmet is , as the name implies , value priced while Weight Watcher meals sell at higher prices . And Budget Gourmet food sales of more_than $ 300 million in 1993 are strong year-round , while Weight Watcher registers its best sales during January and February , when New Year ' s weight-loss resolutions are still fresh in the minds of dieters . &quot; About 50 % of Weight Watcher ( meals ) are sold to present or former Weight Watcher members , &quot; Smyth said . &quot; Budget Gourmet will be a stronger market. &quot; Kraft Chairman Richard P . Mayer said in a statement that its decision to sell Budget Gourmet &quot; is consistent with our recently announced program to improve on the strategic alignment of our food portfolio. &quot; Kraft is a unit of Philip Morris , which has been attempting to streamline by selling non-core product_lines . Philip Morris confirmed earlier this month , for instance , that the Kraft Food Service unit was for_sale . A Kraft spokeswoman , Kathy Knuth , said that the company is trying to concentrate_on such core areas as cheese , cereal , baked_goods and coffee .</TEXT>
