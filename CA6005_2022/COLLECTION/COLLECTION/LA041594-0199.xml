   <HEADLINE> TAX DOCUMENTS RAISE NEW QUESTIONS ON WHITEWATER ; INQUIRY : REAL_ESTATE COMPANY ' S RETURNS DO NOT REFLECT LOSSES CLAIMED BY PRESIDENT CLINTON AND HIS WIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Newly released tax_returns for the Whitewater Development Corp . raise fresh questions about the assertion by President Clinton and his wife that they poured tens of thousands of dollars into the losing venture and received nothing in return . The Clintons have consistently defended themselves against critics by arguing that they lost $ 46 # 636 on the land_development project during the 1970s and 1980s . Most of the money they spent , they have said , consisted_of large interest payments made_for Whitewater Development from their personal funds . Yet the corporate tax_returns of Whitewater Development , made public for the first time earlier this week , do not show evidence of payments anywhere near as large as the Clintons have said they made . Instead of documenting the $ 46 # 636 that the Clintons say they lost on the Whitewater project , the tax records and supporting documents show only about $ 13 # 000 in such payments by the Clintons . Tax accountants said the corporation would have been obligated to reflect the full amount if it was adhering to standard accounting practices . The Clintons ' personal tax_returns for the years in_question show that they claimed $ 46 # 636 as tax_deductions , though no canceled checks or bank_statements have been released to substantiate the deductions . The Clintons have said the payments they claimed on their personal returns were made directly to banks holding Whitewater mortgages or to other corporations owned by James B . McDougal , the Clintons ' partner in the Whitewater venture . In that case , the payments also should have shown_up on Whitewater Development ' s corporate tax_returns , according to independent tax accountants who reviewed the corporation ' s financial records . &quot; If a good job of bookkeeping was being done , you would find some record or some notation in the tax_returns that the corporation was being relieved of its obligations , &quot; by the Clintons , said Mark Rogers , a Little_Rock , Ark. , accountant hired by The Times to review the Whitewater Development returns . The apparent discrepancy between the personal and corporate tax_returns raises more questions about central issues posed by the Clintons ' chief GOP critics : Did the President and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton actually lose large sums_of_money on the Whitewater project , as they have said , and did they receive tax_benefits to which they were not fully entitled ? The corporate tax records seem to support assertions made in recent months by McDougal . McDougal has claimed that the Clintons only invested about $ 13 # 000 in the Whitewater project , not the larger amounts cited by the President . ( Clinton originally had said that he and his wife contributed $ 68 # 900 to the Whitewater endeavor , but he later revised the figure. ) So far , the White_House has released no supporting materials , such_as canceled checks or bank_statements , to document the payments listed in the Clintons ' personal tax_returns . Tax experts said the corporate tax_returns should have included entries corresponding with the payments listed in the personal returns , but they do not . The White_House declined to comment on the discrepancies . A source familiar_with the Clintons ' tax records said he could not explain why the full $ 46 # 636 was not reflected in Whitewater Development ' s corporate returns . There could be several possible explanations for the discrepancies between the personal and corporate tax_returns . Whitewater Development bookkeepers could have failed to properly record all_of the payments made by the Clintons or a tax preparer might have overlooked them . Similarly , the Clintons ' records might have been faulty . Indeed , the Clintons and McDougal have characterized Whitewater Development ' s record-keeping practices as somewhat haphazard . Whitewater Development ' s corporate returns show that in 1980 , Hillary Rodham -- the name used by the First_Lady at the time -- made $ 10 # 131 in interest payments on behalf of Whitewater Development . In 1979 , the returns show , Bill_Clinton made a loan to Whitewater Development of $ 2 # 900 . In 1981 , however , Hillary Clinton received $ 15 # 185 back from Whitewater Development , according to the corporate tax records . The entry indicates that the payment was in the form of land owned by the corporation and not in cash . Hillary Clinton took_out a $ 30 # 000 loan from a McDougal-controlled bank to build a model home on one Whitewater lot , according to documents released by McDougal along with the corporate tax_returns . But the corporate returns indicate that the property was not considered an asset of the corporation . Hillary Clinton later sold the property herself . The Whitewater Development tax_returns also call into question findings contained in a report issued by the Clinton presidential campaign in March , 1992 , in response to disclosures about the Whitewater controversy . The report , prepared by an accounting_firm hired by James M . Lyons , a Denver attorney and old friend of Clinton , exonerated the Clintons of any misrepresentations . Financial information in the corporate tax_returns conflicts sharply with the figures in that report . For example , the report stated that the Whitewater venture suffered losses during years in which the corporation ' s tax_returns show that it made money . And the corporate returns indicate that Whitewater Development was bringing_in as much as $ 60 # 000 annually from land sales during years in which the Lyons report said that no land was sold . The accounting_firm that prepared the 1992 report clearly had access to the Whitewater Development tax_returns . The campaign report said the analysis was based on the returns and many of the line entries in both the report and the Whitewater Development tax_returns are identical . The White_House has distanced itself from the 1992 report in recent months but still uses many of its basic findings to defend the President and Hillary Clinton . Rogers said there is nothing in the Whitewater Development tax_returns , the Clintons ' personal tax_returns as released by the White_House or the campaign report that explains the discrepancies between the documents .</TEXT>
