   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENT ; RED ARMY LEAVES BIG MESS BEHIND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the last trainload of Red Army troops rolled across the Polish border from Germany on Thursday , the Russians left unanswered a major question : what to do with all_the vacated real_estate -- 1 # 026 scattered tracts of land totaling 667 # 000 acres , pocked with tumbledown buildings , toxic dumps and many thousands of unexploded artillery shells ? Germany was studying this dubious windfall even before the Russians boarded their trains home . In the last three years , Bonn spent $ 700 million just to keep the ground_water safe . And now , after inspecting 925 former Red Army posts , officials have turned_up 24 # 000 assorted environmental hot spots -- anything from oil spill sites to haphazard caches of chemicals . About 3 # 000 of these locations are said to pose &quot; acute danger &quot; to the surrounding population . And then there ' s the unspent ammunition . &quot; The Russian , in my experience , goes_about the decommissioning of ammunition according to the principle of ' ocular isolation , ' &quot; complains Guenter Knueppel , a forestry official in Colbitz-Letzlinger Heide , a flatlands area where the Warsaw Pact forces used to stage major maneuvers twice a year . &quot; He digs a hole_in_the_ground , and if he doesn ' t see the ammunition anymore , it ' s gone. &quot; German officials say any serious cleanup will cost billions of marks . And who has that kind of money ? Certainly not private investors , as state and local_governments in the former East_Germany have discovered , to their chagrin . They had hoped that private developers might turn some of the former Russian bases into resorts , industrial_parks , low-income housing estates , theme parks and nature preserves . But in most cases , the potential cost has proven too forbidding and the land too far removed from population centers for economic viability . And so it has come_to pass that the most enthusiastic prospective occupant for the Russian lands is the German army , which sees an opportunity to expand its own assets . Already , the army is reclaiming 12 Russian training grounds , totaling 355 # 000 acres , for training purposes . One 55-square-mile MIG bombing range northeast of Berlin , known as Wittstocker Heide , is now used by the Luftwaffe for practicing tactical air strikes , ground-support sorties and other maneuvers . This doesn ' t sit well with the neighbors . For decades , East_Germans put_up with the roar of Red Army_tank columns and the shriek of low-flying jet fighters , and now they wonder why they should accept more of the same from their own forces . &quot; People are really embittered , &quot; says Reinhard Lampe , a Protestant minister in the village of Dorf Zechlin , which lies on the edge of Wittstocker Heide . &quot; The Russians never asked anybody whether they could do this or not . Now the German army has just taken_over , using Stalin ' s methods. &quot; Angry Germans have responded to the army ' s arrival with candlelight vigils , road blockades , petitions , a &quot; Woodstock for Wittstock &quot; concert and even threats . These tactics have proved futile , however , and now the opponents have turned_to the German judiciary , filing land claims and trying to win court_orders to protect the ground_water or to have some bases set_aside as cultural heritage sites . Most recently , the army planted the flag atop the 89-square-mile Colbitz-Letzlinger Heide , where it plans to build a high-tech center for tank maneuvers and laser-simulated target_practice . But state officials for Saxony-Anhalt argue that 45 years of Soviet and Warsaw Pact environmental insult have left the ground_water at risk . No problem , said the army . It would bring federal funds to clear_away the Russians ' mess . The army estimated that a cleanup would cost $ 100 million to $ 200 million . State officials argued that a proper job would cost $ 900 million and entered talks with their federal counterparts . On the very day of the talks , the army moved onto the base .</TEXT>
