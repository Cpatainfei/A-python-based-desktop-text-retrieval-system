   <HEADLINE> FBI STUDY ADDS CREDENCE TO O.C. CRIME CONCERNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only days after a poll showing that two-thirds of Orange County residents still ranked crime as their No . 1 worry , newly released federal crime statistics show they have reason to be concerned . While the rate of property crimes like burglary and auto theft declined 4.6 % in Orange County from 1992 to 1993 , violent crimes -- murder , rape , robbery and assault -- dropped a mere 1.1 % . And murders during that time_period jumped 13 % , equal_to 7.8 killings per 100 # 000 people . But other statistics measuring crime in the first six months of 1994 show that the number of Orange County murders has continued to rise , jumping another 9.5 % in the county ' s eight largest cities . Violent crime overall increased nearly 4 % in Orange County during the same six-month period , while the rest of the country saw a 4 % decrease in murders , rapes , robberies and assaults . The growing violent crime_rate locally mirrors the mounting anxiety among Orange County residents who responded to the 1994 Orange County Annual Survey released last week . UC Irvine Prof . Mark Baldassare conducted the poll Aug . 19-29 for the university ' s School of Social Ecology . Of those polled , 44 % said they were afraid of becoming crime victims and 66 % said they favored tougher gun_control legislation . Crime was rated as local residents ' greatest concern . &quot; We ' ve seen violent , violent crime come_to places where it usually doesn ' t happen : hate crimes at the beach , a boy killed with a paint_roller , drive-by_shootings in Irvine , drive-by_shootings in Mission Viejo , &quot; said Garden Grove Police_Chief Stanley L . Knee . &quot; Crime , reported by the media , has spread to parts of the county that thought it was safe . . . . It has an unsettling effect. &quot; According to new FBI statistics , the county ' s three safest cities are Laguna Niguel , Yorba Linda and Laguna Hills . None of the cities had a murder in 1993 and together the cities had 16 rapes -- one less than the city of La Habra by itself . The number of assaults in Laguna Hills dropped 50 % from 130 to 65 . The three cities with the highest crime_rates are Costa Mesa , Stanton and Laguna Beach . Laguna Beach had nearly five times as_many assaults as the more residential Laguna Hills , which has more_than double its population . The serious crime_rate for Anaheim could not be calculated , because of a change in way that the city ' s police reported aggravated assaults . There was good news for the nation in the FBI ' s latest statistical tally of homicides , rapes , robberies , aggravated assaults , burglaries and thefts . Nationwide , overall crime dropped 3 % in the first six months of 1994 , which comes_on top of a 2 % decline in 1993 . In Orange County , the number of nonviolent property crimes continued to drop_in 1993 , with burglaries down nearly 10 % . Some cities showed declines in crime nearly double or triple the county average . Among the top crime-busters : Orange , where overall crime dropped 12.9 % , and Fullerton , where crime dipped 8.7 % . But while the violent crimes increased in Orange , Fullerton saw its number of violent crimes drop 7.7 % . &quot; We ' re just seeing the fruits of what we ' ve been doing for a_couple_of years , &quot; Fullerton Capt . Ken Head said . &quot; Our gang detail is maturing and it ' s starting to pay off. &quot; Head said it took two of the department ' s crime-fighting programs -- its gang detail and Operation Cleanup , which targets three of the city ' s crime hot spots -- several years to establish themselves in the community and begin showing significant results . But Head said some crime statistics in Fullerton have remained relatively static , simply because the crooks couldn ' t plunder more_than they already were . &quot; We ' ve been hit hard with auto thefts , but I don ' t know if they could steal any more cars in the city , &quot; Head said . &quot; There ' s only so many criminals. &quot; Irvine , a city of nearly the same population as Fullerton , had 3 # 336 fewer crimes , but a smaller drop_in crime . Cited as one of the safest cities in the nation last year , Irvine again had a low crime_rate , with crime declining 8.2 % . Most of the drop was fueled by a 19 % dive in the number of burglaries from 1 # 226 in 1992 to 990 in 1993 . But law_enforcement officials countywide cautioned that the statistics don ' t always paint a clear picture of a city ' s crime troubles . &quot; You could have a rash of 20 residential burglaries in one neighborhood in a month ' s time and that can throw_off your whole year ' s statistics , &quot; said Orange County Sheriff ' s Lt . Kim Markuson , chief of police services for Mission Viejo . &quot; that ' s where these statistics are deceiving. &quot; Mission Viejo , which contracts with the Sheriff ' s Department for police services , showed an astonishing 21.4 % rise in crime from 1992 to 1993 , all_of it in property thefts . Auto thefts alone jumped 30.2 % . Meanwhile , the number of violent crimes has remained nearly the same -- and less than local cities of comparable size . There were 13 rapes , 32 robberies and 142 assaults in the city in 1993 , compared to 25 rapes , 42 robberies and 205 assaults in Newport Beach , which has 8 # 000 fewer residents . &quot; We ' re fortunate in Mission Viejo that we don ' t have a lot of violent crime , &quot; Markuson said . &quot; Our problems are of the property crime type , but I don ' t see them to be overwhelming . It seems cyclical . Sometimes they ' re up , sometimes they ' re down. &quot; Huntington Beach also saw a big jump in crime , up 7.1 % over 1992 , with 10.5 % more assaults . &quot; I ' m very concerned about rapes and assaults going_up , &quot; said Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson , who leaves_office Monday . &quot; There are more handguns out there and frankly we don ' t have enough police officers. &quot; Moulton Patterson said Huntington Beach has one of the lowest ratios of police_officers to residents , about 1.2 per thousand residents . She compared the ratio in Huntington Beach to that of Newport Beach , another coastal city with lots of tourist traffic , but one that has nearly double the ratio of police to residents . But she said the city is doing battle with the statistics , recently approving the hiring of eight more police_officers . &quot; I think Huntington Beach is still a very safe city , &quot; she said . Garden Grove Chief Knee saw violent crime in his city decrease 6.0 % from 1992 to 1993 , but he said reports of violent crime will most likely increase next year -- and he ' s happy about it . Knee said beefed-up community policing efforts have encouraged people to report violent crimes at a greater rate than in the past . This year his department already has seen a 25 % increase in the reporting of assaults such_as domestic violence , he said . But for the purposes of crime statistics , it ' s a Catch-22 , Knee said . His officers encourage reporting , so there are more violent crimes reported in Garden Grove . * CITY-BY-CITY ANALYSIS : Crime in O.C. from 1992 to ' 93 falls by 5 # 524 incidents . B3 Crime Statistics Show Mixed Results While Orange County property crimes declined almost 5 % in 1993 , and violent crimes were down about 1 % , murder increased 13 % . The overall decline from 1992 to 1993 is the second consecutive year in which crime fell_in the county , and the fourth consecutive year in which the rate per 100 # 000 residents has dropped . Crimes in the FBI index include murder , non-negligent manslaughter , rape , robbery , aggravated assault , burglary , grand theft ( larceny ) and motor_vehicle theft . Crime in Decline After peaking in 1991 , the number of serious crimes reported to Orange County police has continued to fall . Over the past five years , the rate of serious or felony crimes has steadily fallen : Total Crimes 1993 : 135 # 212 * Crime_rate per 100 # 000 residents 1993 : 5 # 386.5 Rate Comparison Laguna Niguel had the lowest crime_rate per 100 # 000 residents during 1993 . Examining cities by rate rather than absolute number of crimes removes size as a factor_in analysis , allowing comparison on an even basis . Here is how the cities compare , from the lowest rate to the highest Note : Anaheim ' s rate is not available Sources : FBI ; California attorney_general ' s office , Bureau of Criminal Statistics</TEXT>
