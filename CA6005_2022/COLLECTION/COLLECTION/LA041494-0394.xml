   <HEADLINE> OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS &amp; VIEWS ; POLICIES THAT AFFECT STUDENTS AND TEACHERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sexual_harassment policies may differ in_length , but content is similar in guidelines adopted by school districts across the county . Policies , pertaining to both students and teachers , cover a definition of sexual_harassment , examples of such behavior , how to file a complaint and possible consequences . The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines state that &quot; prevention is the best tool for elimination of sexual harassment. &quot; School districts have held in-service training for teachers , and students at some schools have been briefed about the policy at assemblies . Some schools , however , have not taken the message directly to students , relying instead on students reading about the policy in their handbooks . * Here is a portion of Villa Park High_School ' s sexual_harassment policy , which is similar to others adopted in the county : Sexual harassment may include but is not limited to : * Verbal or physical harassment or abuse ; * Subtle pressure for sexual_activity ; * Demanding sexual favors accompanied by implied or overt promises of preferential treatment with_regard_to an individual ' s employment status ; * Offers of sexual favors or advances to secure favorable employment conditions or to avoid unfavorable ones . Sexual harassment does not refer to behavior or occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature . It refers to behavior that is not welcome , that is personally offensive , that fails to respect the rights of others , that lowers morale and that , therefore , interferes with work effectiveness . Sexual harassment may take different forms . One form is the demand for sexual favors . Other forms of harassment include : * Verbal : Sexual innuendoes , suggestive comments , comments on clothing or physical appearance , jokes of a sexual nature , sexual propositions , flirtations , advances or threats , highly personal questions and unwanted notes or love_letters with a sexual message . * Nonverbal : Sexually suggestive cartoons , pinups , graphic commentaries , suggestive or insulting sounds , leering , whistling , obscene gestures , graffiti , offensive language and displaying sexually suggestive objects or pictures . * Physical : Unwanted physical contact , including touching , pinching , kissing , brushing the body , physical interference with movements such_as blocking or following , patting , hugging , back or neck rubs , coerced sexual_intercourse , assault . * At the three high_schools in Irvine , students attended assemblies where they received the policy on sexual_harassment and watched a performance by Live Action , a troupe that concentrates_on social issues . Live Action also distributed a flier on sexual_harassment . Excerpts from the flyer : Remember : when it comes_to sexual_harassment , it ' s not your intentions , but the impact of your behavior that counts . Sexual harassment can be very hurtful , even if you don ' t mean it to be . The following types of behavior may be sexual_harassment : * Name calling , verbal or written , of a sexual nature , such_as : hunk , stud , fag , ho , etc. , when used as sexual put-downs . * Sexual threats , demands , teasing , taunting . * Pressure for sexual_activity . * Blocking movements . * Explicit pictures , posters , calendars in class or on notebooks . * Sexual gesturing , grabbing , pinching in_line * Comments about someone ' s sexual preference . Flirting is different from sexual_harassment . There are no rules against flirting . Sexual harassment , unlike flirting , is unwelcome or unsolicited . Ask yourself the following questions : 1 . Would I want this behavior to be written_up in the school newspaper or appear on the evening news ? 2 . Would I behave this way if a member of my family were standing next to me ? 3 . Would I want someone to act this way toward someone I love ? 4 . Is this behavior agreed upon by me and the other person ? If the answer is no , then you probably shouldn ' t do_it .</TEXT>
