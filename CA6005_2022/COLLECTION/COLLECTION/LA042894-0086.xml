   <HEADLINE> VEGETABLES AS MEAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Home economists used to suggest that we plan menus by deciding on a main_course of meat , fish or poultry and then designing the rest of the meal around it . But these days , doctors tell us we should eat many_more vegetables than we do . So if beautiful , nutritious broccoli , snow-white mushrooms , shiny purple eggplants or brilliant sweet red_peppers are featured in the market , why not start with them ? I have always liked the Chinese style of serving rice with a variety of accompanying dishes , rather than thinking in terms of a main_course of meat and one or two side_dishes . Or you can prepare one or more vegetable dishes and serve them with pasta , rice or another grain . With this approach , a meal can be nutritious , colorful and satisfying . Often you will find you either don ' t need meat at all or end_up eating it in smaller amounts . For diversity in menus , try the exotic and newer vegetables -- the many varieties of squash , the baby vegetables , the wild mushrooms , the Chinese greens . It ' s not unusual now to find vegetables that were unknown to us several years ago , such_as broccoflower , sugar-snap peas and sweet dumpling squash . This is true not only at farmers ' markets but also at regular produce markets and supermarkets . To make_it easier to include vegetables in menus , markets now provide many cut and cleaned vegetables for convenience . There are broccoli florets , sliced mushrooms , washed spinach , shredded cabbage and other ready-to-cook vegetables from both the produce section and the salad_bar section . Ready-washed salad_greens make preparing salad a delight -- you just put the greens you want in the bowl and sprinkle them lightly with a small amount of dressing . One easy way to incorporate more vegetables in your diet is to cook enough for two meals at one time . Most vegetables can be cooked ahead ; even green vegetables can be reheated easily . You can always heat the second portion of vegetables with a small amount of tomato_sauce or sprinkle it with herb- or garlic-scented olive_oil , vinaigrette or a little salsa . You can add the vegetables to soups , meat or bean stews or vegetable medleys . Or turn the extra vegetables into a new dish . Make them into salads , soups or purees , or toss them with rice pilaf , tortellini or other types of pasta . * With so many possibilities , you can easily make vegetables into the most exciting part of the meal . * My friend Somchit Singchalee , a Thai chef in Paris , taught me how to make this dish . She used this as a basic Thai red curry recipe for all sorts of vegetables -- squash , eggplant , even potatoes . For this dish we sometimes bought tiny Thai green eggplants that looked_like large peas . But our common large eggplants work just fine . This curry is very rich , and so I like to serve it in small portions with Thai jasmine rice and another simple dish such_as grilled chicken_breasts or a quick spinach salad . Most of the ingredients for this curry are available in good supermarkets . My local market in Santa Monica often has the Thai chili paste , canned coconut_milk and even the fish sauce , which is occasionally labeled &quot; Thai seasoning sauce. &quot; You can also buy these ingredients in Asian specialty shops . THAI MUSHROOM AND RED CHILI CURRY 2 tablespoons oil 1 / 2 pound large fresh mushrooms , halved Salt Freshly ground pepper 1 medium shallot , chopped 2 medium cloves garlic , chopped 1 tablespoon Thai red chili paste 1 ( 14-ounce ) can coconut_milk 2 teaspoons sugar 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon Thai fish sauce ( nam pla ) 1 small eggplant , cut_into 1-inch cubes 1 sweet red_pepper , cut_into strips 1 / 2 cup shelled fresh or frozen peas 1 ( 15-ounce ) can baby corn , rinsed and halved 1 / 2 cup small Thai or Italian basil leaves , optional , plus basil sprigs for garnish Heat 1 tablespoon oil in saute pan over medium-high heat . Add mushrooms , salt and pepper to taste and saute 4 minutes or until lightly browned . Remove to bowl . Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and heat over low heat . Add shallot and garlic and saute 1 minute . Stir in chili paste , then 1 1 / 4 cups coconut_milk and bring_to boil . Simmer over low heat 5 minutes , stirring often . Add sugar and 2 tablespoons fish sauce . Add eggplant and red_pepper strips . Bring to boil . Cover and simmer , stirring often , about 15 minutes or until tender . Add remaining coconut_milk and bring_to boil . Add mushrooms , peas and corn . Cover and simmer 5 minutes or until vegetables are tender . ( Curry can be kept , covered , 2 days in refrigerator . Reheat in covered pan. ) If sauce is too thick , gradually stir in 1 or 2 tablespoons water . Add remaining 1 teaspoon fish sauce , or more to taste . Remove from heat and stir in basil leaves . Taste and adjust seasonings . Garnish with basil sprigs . Makes 4 to 5 main-course servings . * I first tasted this soup when it was cooked by a friend ' s teen-age guest from Mexico_City , who knew how to cook only one thing -- tortilla soup . We thought it sounded like a strange dish , but it turned_out to be delicious . The soup is made in different ways throughout Mexico . It might contain only tomatoes and onion , or it might have zucchini , carrots , chiles or sweet_peppers . I like to add corn for its taste and texture and because it complements the corn tortillas . I also stir raw tomatoes and cilantro into the finished soup for a fresh touch . Many versions of this soup call_for cheese , such_as crumbled Mexican queso fresco or shredded Monterey Jack . You can serve cheese separately if you like , but I prefer the soup without it ; it ' s lighter and still flavorful . You can also accompany the soup with avocado slices . In the interest of lightness I have tried making the soup with toasted tortillas instead of fried ones , but the results are disappointing . If you don ' t wish to fry the tortillas , use 2 or 3 cups packaged tortilla strips instead ; some are now available without oil or without salt . TOMATO AND CORN TORTILLA SOUP 6 corn tortillas , preferably stale 5 tablespoons oil 1 1 / 4 pounds ripe tomatoes , peeled , seeded and chopped , or 1 ( 28-ounce ) can plum_tomatoes , drained and chopped 1 medium onion , chopped 2 long mild green chiles , diced small 2 large cloves garlic , minced 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock or mixed broth and water 1 ear corn , kernels removed , or 1 cup frozen kernels 1 / 3 cup plus 1 teaspoon coarsely chopped cilantro Salt Freshly ground pepper Pure ground chile or cayenne_pepper If tortillas are not stale , let stand about 30 minutes unwrapped in 1 layer until dry . Cut tortillas in half , then cut each half into 1 / 4-inch-wide strips . Heat 1 / 4 cup oil in heavy , medium saute pan over medium-high heat . Test with 1 tortilla strip , when oil is hot enough , it should bubble around strip . Add 1 / 2 of strips to pan and fry 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly darker and firmer but not crisp . Do not brown and do not stir too often or strips will break_up . Remove pan from heat and quickly transfer tortilla strips with slotted spoon to paper_towels . Reheat oil slightly , add remaining strips and fry them . Remove to paper_towels . Set_aside 3 / 4 cup chopped tomatoes for finishing soup . Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in large saucepan . Add onion and chiles and saute over medium heat 5 minutes or until light-brown . Add garlic and saute 30 seconds . Add stock and remaining tomatoes and bring_to boil . Cover and simmer 10 minutes . Add corn and simmer 5 to 10 minutes or until corn is tender . Just before serving , reheat soup if necessary . Add reserved 3 / 4 cup chopped tomatoes , 1 / 3 cup cilantro , salt , pepper and ground chile to taste . Serve soup sprinkled with tortilla strips and remaining 1 teaspoon chopped cilantro . Makes 4 appetizer servings . Note : If fresh green chiles are not available , substitute 1 cup diced green_peppers or canned mild green chiles .</TEXT>
