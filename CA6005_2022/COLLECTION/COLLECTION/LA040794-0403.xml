   <HEADLINE> PARKER ' S PLACE : A CORRESPONDENCE_COURSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a way of bringing a little goodness to daily life while putting_off the unpleasant as long as possible , I ' ve developed the Citizens ' Mail Prioritizing System ( patent pending ) that seems to be working well . I am happy to share it . STEP 1 : Gather_up your newly arrived mail , then stand over the nearest trash_can or perhaps in the yard of an unpleasant neighbor and toss all_of the junk mail into the can or onto the grass . This immediately gets_rid_of all_the supermarket ads , the coupon booklets and credit_card propositions that should be illegal to send_out anyway because so many trees are destroyed to make the stuff . STEP 2 : Take what remains and rapidly flip through it . Set_aside anything that looks_like personal correspondence or checks . Then take the rest -- mostly bills , of course , but not always -- and set them on a small unpadded surface of some kind . ( A bar stool , wooden chair or crowded counter is ideal , as Step 6 will illustrate. ) You are now free to forget about these intrusive items . STEP 3 : Tear immediately into the personal_letters . Few pleasures in life can match a genuine handwritten missive from somewhere you ' re not . They ' re like dispatches from your own private intelligence network . Recently I ' ve had the honor of receiving news from Oshkosh , Neb. ; Cheyenne , Wyo. ; Eaton , Colo. ; Athol , Mass. ; Taveuni , Fiji ; Paris , France , and from several points in my favorite of all -- Orange County , Calif . STEP 4 : Open checks and set them by the front_door of your place . For the next two or three days leave them there , neatly positioned , and glance at them each time you leave or enter the house . Appreciate their integrity , the way this little legal_document can actually be drawn_up on paper featuring highlights from , say , Disneyland , the American Southwest , or a skier going_down a mountain . Take_pride in the fact that they are made_out to you . Imagine the pleasure of endorsement , deposit , cash back . STEP 5 : When you are tired_of reorganizing these windblown checks , which will lift_off and fly around your home like tiny magic carpets every time you open or close the door , take them to the bank and assign them their fate . STEP 6 : Toward the end of 30 days , the bills and mystery mail stacked on the bar stool or counter ( see Step 2 ) will begin to slide off or fall_down . It is important that bills be stored in a place where they will either slip to the floor or tip_over , because this will be your cue that the bills are almost due_to be paid . It will happen two to four times a day . When you are angry enough about having to pick_up these dread documents , it is time to move them to a large , uncluttered table or desk . STEP 7 : Leave these unopened bills on the desk or table for another one to three days . This is a little breather , a reward for taking the next step toward paying them , a rest before the unpleasant demands of Step 8 . STEP 8 : Open one bill at a time , throw_away all_the attendant junk that bills contain these days , go right to the bottom_line , and write a check to cover it . Do not thoroughly scrutinize each bill for accuracy ; companies maintain huge staffs of people to make_sure that you neither underpay nor overpay . If you ' ve overpaid , the &quot; credit due &quot; statement on the next bill will be a significant mood lifter . It is critical to achieve the proper state_of_mind while writing_out checks to cover exorbitant bills for things such_as bottled water , credit_card interest , home mortgages and insurance . You must look_upon each payment you make as a victory over the cruel machinery of capitalism . For instance , you should consider it a triumph over the phone_company when you pay them for your calls to Rio ; you should be proud that you ' ve averted the threat of a scandal-ridden water district ' s discontinuing your water service as you write the check . When you pay a ton of money to the gas or propane company , look_on this act proudly . It is an act of heroism , a blow struck for the little guy . They are all trying to bankrupt you , and you have won , for now . Gloat . Never write your account number on a check for the convenience of the company receiving it . And never write &quot; amount paid &quot; in the box on the return portion of the bill . If they can ' t read their own bill , find their number on it , and understand how much your check is written for , these are their problems , not yours . ( The obvious exception to this rule is the IRS or Franchise_Tax Board of California , two organizations that actually might not be able to find your Taxpayer ID Number on the forms they send to you . Fill_in this number for them . Go_ahead and fill_in the &quot; amount paid &quot; blank also , in the likely event that your check will simply mystify them . Look_on these acts_as something akin to helping an unthankful elderly blind_person across a busy street. ) STEP 9 : Take a_few moments to leisurely pore over the mail that was segregated in Step 2 but isn ' t bills . These are the real wild cards , stuff that can be exciting or banal , but always unexpected . A recent sampling of my own included a renewed U.S. passport in which I look_like a dazed and bloated toad ; an anarchist newsletter published by local high_school students that contained excerpts from a gay porn magazine called Spunk ; a belated birthday_card containing a Sizzler Senior Club Discount membership ; and a newsletter from an insurance_company featuring a cover story that begins , &quot; Taking personal time each day to do the things we truly enjoy is something everybody should do , &quot; and has an article inside called &quot; Laughing Gas Dangers. &quot; Enjoy these offbeat treasures . STEP 10 ( optional ) : If you subscribe_to a cable TV system , check your bill to see if you ' ve been charged for &quot; property tax. &quot; If your bill is like mine , you indeed will have been charged , and you may wonder why the gigantic check you write_out to &quot; Bob &quot; Citron twice a year isn ' t enough , unless he needs more to cover his own cable bills . Make some phone_calls to find_out why you ' re paying property_tax every month to the same people who thrust the Home Shopping Channel in your face , and while you ' re at it , ask why &quot; Bob &quot; pads his name with those furtive quotation_marks . Please write me a letter and let me know what you find_out . * I ' d like to correct a mistake in my March 3 column about trying to ride a horse . I wrote that the horse &quot; reared &quot; when in fact he only stopped and pulled_back his head as another horse intruded into his area . As an over-excitable non-rider , I labeled this &quot; rearing , &quot; though , as any horse person knows , it is certainly not . My sincere apologies to the fine instructors at the Club riding school at the Sycamore Trails stables in San Juan Capistrano .</TEXT>
