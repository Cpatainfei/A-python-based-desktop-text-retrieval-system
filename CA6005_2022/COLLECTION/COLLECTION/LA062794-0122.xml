   <HEADLINE> AFGHAN PRESIDENT FORCES FOE FROM CAPITAL ; CIVIL WAR : TWO DAYS OF FIERCE FIGHTING MAY HAVE BROKEN A LETHAL , 6-MONTH-OLD STALEMATE IN KABUL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The army of Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani , backed by aerial bombardments , artillery and rocket barrages , scored a signal victory Sunday by driving the forces of one of his main foes out of the country ' s capital , reports said . Although no one was predicting an end to the country ' s civil_war , which has now lasted for a decade and a half , the two days of fierce fighting in Kabul may have broken a lethal , 6-month-old stalemate in Afghanistan ' s most important city . &quot; God is great ! &quot; Rabbani ' s men shouted , pumping their fists in the air as the magnitude of their victory became clear . At dawn Saturday , presidential forces launched an air and ground offensive to push_back militia loyal to former Communist Gen . Abdul Rashid Dostum and fighters from the Hezb-i-Islami fundamentalist faction led by the rebel prime_minister , Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . Since full-scale warfare broke_out in Kabul on New Year ' s Day , the two anti-Rabbani leaders had failed to gain much ground , but remained masters of the_hills in southern Kabul and subjected the city to unrelenting rocket bombardment . Gen . Haji Fahiam , the head of national security , told reporters in Kabul that air strikes , rocket attacks and a ground assault on Sunday had succeeded in finally dislodging Dostum ' s forces from a strategic location , Marunjan Hill . Troops loyal to the president also stormed the second important outpost that had remained in Dostum ' s hands , a group of Soviet-built apartment_buildings in eastern Kabul . Another strategic spot held by Dostum ' s forces , the ancient Bala Hissar fort in southeastern Kabul , was bombed from the air and fell to Rabbani ' s fighters on the first day of the campaign . Its ruins were still smoking Sunday . Five SU-22 and MIG-21 fighters roared over Kabul from Rabbani ' s main air_base at Bagram , 25 miles north of the capital , to attack Marunjan Hill . A day earlier , more_than 20 jets blasted Bala Hissar in the most intense air bombardment Kabul had seen in 15 years of civil_war . Hospitals reported to local journalists that at least 20 people were killed and 130 wounded in the two-day engagement . But since many dead and wounded in Afghanistan ' s fighting are never taken_to a hospital , the total number of casualties was uncertain . In the face of such daunting firepower , many of Dostum ' s fighters fled , leaving_behind weapons , ammunition , food and several armored vehicles and tanks . Rabbani ' s victory appeared to have reduced Dostum ' s presence to a minimum in Kabul , though he is still a force to be reckoned with in Afghanistan ' s north . In a reported act of retaliation for the humiliation suffered in the capital , jets from Dostum ' s bases in northern Afghanistan dropped eight bombs on the center of Herat , 370 miles west of Kabul , on Saturday , killing 10 people and injuring 70 . &quot; All targets and casualties were civilians . The U.N. should take_note of this , &quot; a U.N. official quoted Gov . Ismail Khan as saying . More_than 2 # 000 people have been killed since Hekmatyar and Dostum joined forces Jan . 1 to try to oust Rabbani . At least 20 # 000 people have been wounded , and a third of Kabul ' s 1.5 million residents have fled as rival leaders battled . The Muslim factions formed an uneasy coalition to fight the 1979-89 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and to topple the Soviet-backed Communist government in Kabul in April , 1992 , then began fighting each other . Reports from Kabul said that Rabbani ' s government decided on the weekend assault to preempt a similar strike ostensibly being planned by Hekmatyar and his allies . Rabbani ' s term in office expires Tuesday , but he has refused to go if there is no agreement on a successor . Hekmatyar , meanwhile , has said there will be more bloodletting if his foe does not quit as scheduled .</TEXT>
