   <HEADLINE> TRUST , MAYBE -- BUT DO VERIFY ; N . KOREAN DEAL IS PROMISING , BUT INCONCLUSIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After 16 months of complex and frustrating negotiations the United States has struck a deal with North_Korea that , if Pyongyang does what it seems to have committed itself to doing , could in time eliminate the budding nuclear threat in Northeast Asia . Harsh experience , however , demands that the uncertainty implied by that &quot; if &quot; be emphasized . North_Korea under Kim Il Sung was routinely contemptuous of such basic conventions of international behavior as keeping one ' s promises . Whether things will change under the apparent new leader , Kim Jong Il , has yet to be shown . At a minimum , it would be premature to see the accord that ' s to be signed_in Geneva on Friday as anything more_than a possible hopeful departure . The plan calls_for North_Korea to freeze its nuclear program . Then over a period of up_to a decade it will swap its nuclear_reactors -- one operational , two under construction -- for oil to revive its largely moribund industries and for two 1 # 000-megawatt light-water reactors . Reactors of this kind are far less capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium than the reactors North_Korea would discard . South_Korea and Japan are expected to cover most of their $ 4-billion cost . The oil will come from the United States and other sources . Only toward the very end of the phased exchange process would North_Korea yield control over the 8 # 000 nuclear fuel rods it has been holding_in storage . Those rods contain material that could be processed for weapons ; earlier reprocessing may already have given Pyongyang one or two nuclear devices . The International Atomic Energy Agency is supposed to have full access to North_Korea ' s nuclear facilities . In the past , however , IAEA inspectors were denied entry to several suspect sites . Robert Gallucci , the chief U.S. negotiator with North_Korea , insists that adequate inspection and verification procedures are built into the agreement . But the text of the accord has yet to be published , and some serious doubts and questions have been raised . North_Korea , when all is said and done , will retain possession of nuclear material for many years to come . For at least five years it can continue to deny inspectors entry to a number of sites that have figured in its efforts to divert material from spent fuel rods to weapons use . Meanwhile , it will soon begin getting the oil it so desperately needs and a start on two modern reactors . Does all this signal a North_Korean shift to moderation and true international cooperation ? Certainly that ' s the implicit promise . But North_Korea ' s promises by themselves are without value . The proof of its intentions and its trustworthiness can come only from its deeds .</TEXT>
