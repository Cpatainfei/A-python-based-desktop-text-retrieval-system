   <HEADLINE> JAPANESE STOCKS FALL AS FEARS MOUNT THAT FED WILL HIKE RATES ; MARKETS : TOKYO INVESTORS CONCERNED THAT THE GROWTH IN U.S. EMPLOYMENT WILL LEAD TO ACTION TO CHECK INFLATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japanese stocks fell_in early trading today after an upbeat U.S. employment report released Friday rekindled concern that the Federal_Reserve will raise short-term rates in the U.S. to keep inflation in check , traders said . In the first fifteen minutes of trading , the Tokyo Stock_Exchange ' s benchmark Nikkei 225 average was down 257.36 points , or 1.34 % at 19 # 019.80. The broader Topix index of all shares on the first section of the Tokyo Stock_Exchange dropped 16.42 points , or 1.05 % , to 1 # 554.76. Nikkei 225 stock index futures for June delivery fell 400 points to 19 # 005 in Singapore . Futures in Osaka were yet to trade due_to an imbalance of sell orders . The U.S. Labor_Department said Friday that last month the U.S. created 456 # 000 new jobs , the biggest gain in more_than six years . The report sent the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury_bond to its highest levels in 14 months , up from less than 7.10 % to as high as 7.27 % . &quot; These figures are proof that the U.S. economy is_well on_the_road to recovery , &quot; said Tatsuya Oguchi , general_manager of futures and options at James Capel Securities . Many U.S. analysts were watching the performance of the Tokyo market today for clues to the direction of the U.S. market when it opens this morning . Other Asian markets , including Hong Kong , Australia , New Zealand , and Taiwan are closed today for holiday observances . In the United States , the New York Stock_Exchange index last week posted a loss of 139 points , continuing a sharp selloff of more_than 300 points that began in_earnest in early February . The dive has been attributed to a response to the Fed ' s moves to raise interest_rates for the first time in five years . The Federal_Reserve has raised rates twice since Feb . 4 , most recently to 3.5 % from 3.25 % on March 22 . Following the Feb . 4 increase , Japanese stocks fell 287.03 points , or 1.4 % , while share prices slid 291.43 points , or 1.44 % after the Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise short-term rates . Oguchi predicted trading volume would be thin today because Japanese institutional and overseas investors will await reaction from investors abroad before actively entering the market . On Friday , activity on the first section of the Tokyo Stock_Exchange was 230 million shares today , down from a six-month average of 337 million shares a day . However , gains in_stock prices at the end of last week and a rise in Japan ' s smaller indexes indicates that Japanese stocks could weather a rise in U.S. rates without much damage , said Paul Migliorato , a senior salesman at Jardine Fleming Securities . &quot; I think the weakness in the bond market in the states is certainly going_to unnerve Japan , &quot; Migliorato said . &quot; But there have been some areas of strength , and I think Japan will be helped by the weekend and by the fact that American ( inflationary ) problems aren ' t necessarily Japan ' s problems. &quot; Compared to a 3.67 % drop_in the Dow Jones industrial average , and a 5.10 % fall_in the Nasdaq index , Japan ' s over-the-counter market reached a new high for the year last week , rising 1.59 % , Migliorato said . Since March 17 , the Dow has declined 6 % , or 229.18 points . &quot; Inflationary numbers in the U.S. don ' t necessarily mean inflationary things for Japan , &quot; Migliorato said . Japanese bond prices also were down at the start of Tokyo trading as traders reacted to the fall_in U.S. bonds on Friday . Bond futures for June delivery , currently the active futures contract , were down 0.25 yen at 111.85 yen . The yield on the benchmark No . 157 10-year government_bond was 3.925 % , up 0.06 % . &quot; With U.S. yields at 7.27 % , we can ' t say there won ' t be an effect on Japanese bonds , &quot; said Mikinao Matsushita , a fund manager at BOT Asset Management , a unit of the Bank of Tokyo . &quot; The influence of the U.S. bond price fall , however , will be limited , &quot; Matsushita said . &quot; Actions by the Bank_of_Japan and movements in the currency market could divert attention away from the U.S. &quot; U.S. Treasury_bonds opened higher in Tokyo today and the U.S. dollar was stronger against the yen , said Masashi Takiya , head of the customer desk at Industrial Bank_of_Japan . In New York trading Friday , the dollar soared against most major currencies as the yield on U.S. bonds climbed following a government report showing the biggest gain in jobs since 1987 . The dollar will change hands between 103.30 to 104.20 yen during Tokyo trading hours , as it moves_into the 103-106 yen range_in the coming months , Takiya said .</TEXT>
