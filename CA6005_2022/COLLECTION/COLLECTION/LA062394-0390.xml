   <HEADLINE> JUDGE DENIES SIMPSON GOT SPECIAL TREATMENT IN ' 89 ; COURTS : SENTENCE FOR ASSAULTING WIFE WAS THE ONE PROSECUTORS URGED , HE SAYS . TRANSCRIPTS SEEM TO BACK HIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Breaking a week of silence , the judge who has come under_fire for allegedly letting O.J. Simpson off too easily on a 1989 charge of wife beating defended himself Wednesday , saying he gave the football star-turned-murder-suspect &quot; almost exactly &quot; what prosecutors asked_for and was not &quot; star-struck. &quot; Municipal Judge Ronald R . Schoenberg -- who has become a lightning_rod for criticism of the judicial_system ' s handling of domestic violence -- said he did not give Simpson jail time because the Los Angeles city attorney ' s office , which prosecuted the case , did not ask_for_it . Moreover , contrary to the angry assertions of prosecutors , Schoenberg said Simpson was not initially allowed to undergo counseling by telephone . But the judge acknowledged that he permitted Simpson to continue his sessions by phone when the retired running_back moved to New York to work as a football broadcaster . Partial transcripts of the case , made public after Schoenberg called a news_conference in his Downtown Los Angeles courtroom , appeared to support the judge , adding yet another bizarre twist to the unfolding drama surrounding Simpson -- charged in the slayings of his former wife , Nicole , and her waiter friend , Ronald Goldman -- and his previous brushes with the law . Now , instead of prosecutors pointing fingers at a silent judge , the judge and prosecutors are pointing fingers at one another . A matter that seemed clear-cut now turns_on semantics , with prosecutors continuing to insist that they did ask_for jail time -- albeit not publicly -- and the veteran judge complaining that critics are smearing his good name . &quot; Up until now , I have sat quietly by as the district_attorney , members of the city attorney ' s office , legislators and reporters questioned my integrity and judgment based on false and inaccurate statements , &quot; Schoenberg said . &quot; The sentence I gave Mr. Simpson was almost exactly the punishment recommended by the city attorney. &quot; The bespectacled 56-year-old jurist , who was elected to the bench in 1978 , spoke_for just five minutes , reading aloud from a three-page typewritten statement . He said he had remained silent because he &quot; wanted to make_sure that my recollection of what happened was correct and that I could prove it. &quot; When he was through , he announced that he would not take any questions and referred reporters to the transcripts . Several hours later , the court made partial transcripts public -- 26 pages documenting bits and pieces of three 1989 hearings held before Schoenberg , one on May 22 , another May 24 and a third Sept . 1 . The records reflect a give-and-take between the judge and his celebrity defendant , with the judge at times complaining that Simpson was not carrying_out his sentence properly . &quot; I ' m in a position of being mean , &quot; Schoenberg tells the former football star at one point , &quot; of making you do something that you don ' t like to do. &quot; But the records do not tell the whole story , according to Deputy City Atty . Robert Pingel , who prosecuted the case . Pingel said that in discussions before the open-court proceedings , he argued repeatedly that Simpson should be jailed &quot; due_to the violent nature of the battery incident &quot; and because police reports indicated this was not the first time Simpson had abused his wife . In a prepared statement , Pingel said Wednesday that he also asked_for a fine , for Simpson to contribute money to a shelter for battered women and for him to perform community service and undergo therapy at a program designed to curb domestic violence . &quot; Throughout those discussions , &quot; the statement said , &quot; the judge was unreceptive to those arguments. &quot; The transcripts , however , document only what happened in open court , and not behind closed doors . According to the transcripts , when Simpson was sentenced in May , prosecutors asked that he be fined $ 200 , plus a penalty , that he perform 120 hours of community service , that he give $ 500 to a shelter for battered women and that he attend a counseling program for men who batter their wives . Pingel also asked the judge to place Simpson on 24 months probation , and to have him report to the court every six months to see if he had fulfilled the terms of the sentence . The judge did order the $ 200 fine , plus a $ 270 penalty , as well as the $ 500 payment and 120 hours of community service . To complete the community service requirement , Simpson worked raising money for a charity -- Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times . In September , when Simpson reported back to the judge , the volunteer coordinator responsible_for supervising Simpson ' s case said she approved the work , even though the charity was not registered with her agency and it was Simpson -- and not she -- who selected the project . Describing his efforts to seek corporate sponsorship for the event , Simpson told the judge that he flew to Atlanta to meet with Coca-Cola executives , to Boston to meet with officials from Reebok and to New York to talk to representatives of Hertz , whose car rental commercials he appeared in . But the judge was not impressed . &quot; This is business . This is just not community service , &quot; he complained to Simpson ' s lawyer , Howard Weitzman . &quot; . . . that ' s part of what he does as a celebrity. &quot; He also complained that Simpson had not paid his fines on_time -- a lapse for which Weitzman claimed responsibility . The judge then ordered Simpson to perform an additional 32 hours of &quot; regular community service. &quot; The transcripts also show that , at the May sentencing , prosecutors asked Schoenberg to order Simpson to attend a special state program for men who abuse their spouses . Simpson balked at the program . Weitzman told the judge that the former football_player was already undergoing counseling &quot; not just simply for this situation , but also to get_to the cause behind the problem. &quot; Denying the prosecution ' s request , the judge permitted Simpson to remain with the therapist he was using . He instructed Simpson to continue his therapy . In September , when Simpson moved to New York , the judge permitted him to continue the sessions by telephone . Pingel has complained in interviews that the therapist Simpson used was not trained to help violent spouses . On Tuesday , Deputy City Atty . Alana Bowman , who heads the unit that handles domestic violence , declared that out of the 20 # 000 cases her office handles each year , in only one -- Simpson ' s -- was a defendant allowed to undergo counseling by phone . &quot; Something happened , &quot; she said , &quot; that is not common. &quot; The transcripts also reveal that by September , Simpson was tired_of the counseling , saying he had overcome whatever problem he had . &quot; I don ' t even know what else to talk_about . I come_in . I sit_down with him ( the therapist ) , &quot; Simpson told the judge , who was ordering him to continue the sessions . &quot; We start talking_about other things that are happening in my life at this point . . . . I mean , I just don ' t know how long , sir , I can talk_about one incident in my entire life . &quot; I think I ' ve been a great citizen , &quot; Simpson continued . &quot; My wife has indicated we have a great marriage . We had one bad night in our life . . . . I think we all understand what happened that night , why it happened and have taken steps to see_to_it that it can never happen again. &quot; With Simpson facing double murder_charges , the nation ' s attention has now been riveted on the issue of domestic violence and the court ' s handling of the 1989 battery charge . The charge stemmed from a New Year ' s Eve incident in which Simpson beat his former wife so badly that she sought hospital treatment . Police records reveal that Simpson stormed out of the house and drove_off in his Bentley when it appeared police were going_to arrest him . &quot; The police have been out here eight times before , and now you ' re going to arrest me for this ? &quot; Simpson is quoted in one report as yelling to two police_officers who were responding to a 911 call . &quot; This is a family matter . Why do you want to make a big deal_out of it when we can handle it ? &quot; Nicole Simpson , bruised and scratched , ran_out of bushes crying : &quot; He ' s going_to kill me , he ' s going_to kill me , &quot; one of the officers wrote . &quot; She kept saying : ' You never do anything about him . You talk to him and then leave. ' &quot; As details of the beating emerged , Judge Schoenberg came under intense criticism not only from prosecutors in the Los Angeles city attorney ' s office , but also from victims rights advocates , the news media , and Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , who called his sentencing &quot; inappropriate and ineffective. &quot; The case has been portrayed as an example of how the judicial_system fails to protect abused women and how celebrities receive favored treatment in the courtroom . The sentence imposed by Schoenberg has already sparked a wave of reform efforts . In California , the Assembly has approved a resolution requiring judges to attend annual training sessions to learn more about domestic violence . And in New York , legislative leaders have agreed on a bill that would require police_officers to arrest anyone suspected of seriously beating a spouse . Although the measure was in the works before the Simpson case , Gov . Mario Cuomo acknowledged that the case is likely to spur activity on the bill . Meanwhile , Schoenberg has kept_out of the spotlight . A Santa Monica native , he is the son of the renowned Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg . The younger Schoenberg worked as a public_defender for three years after graduating from law_school at UC Berkeley and worked in private practice for a_few years before being elected to the bench . In recent days he has refused to talk to reporters , even as he was being vilified in the media . Saturday night , a reporter visited Schoenberg ' s Brentwood home , which is_on the same street and a_few blocks away from Simpson ' s house . The judge would only say &quot; No ! &quot; when asked if he would comment on his handling of the Simpson case or whether he knows the football star . In another connection , the judge ' s son works for the same law_firm as Weitzman , the high-profile criminal defense_attorney who represented Simpson in the 1989 spousal abuse charge and served as his lawyer in the first few days after the double murders . Sources said that Schoenberg ' s son , E . Randol Schoenberg , began working_at Weitzman ' s previous firm as a clerk some time after the judge sentenced Simpson , and was hired as a lawyer at Weitzman ' s current firm after graduation from USC Law_School in 1991 . Contacted by The Times , the son refused to discuss the_matter . Weitzman did not return telephone_calls seeking comment on how Schoenberg ' s son came_to work_at his firm . Schoenberg receives mixed reviews from prosecutors and defense_lawyers . Michael Guarino , a former deputy city attorney who teaches law in San Francisco and who ran_for office against incumbent City Atty . James Hahn , praised Schoenberg as &quot; bright and fair and a very decent man. &quot; Guarino , who once was at_odds with Schoenberg over a sentence he considered too lenient , nonetheless complained that prosecutors have been protecting themselves through their harsh criticism of the judge . Guarino said that if the city attorney ' s office was so insistent on jail time for Simpson , prosecutors should have demanded it in open court . &quot; What we ' re trying to do , &quot; he said , using the pronoun we even though he no longer works there , &quot; is get our own office off the hook. &quot; But Deputy City Atty . Pat Milne , acting supervisor of the West Los Angeles office , was one of several prosecutors openly critical of Schoenberg . &quot; He was a very lenient sentencer , &quot; Milne said . &quot; We had a lot of disagreements with him where we wanted jail time and he just would n ' t do it. &quot;</TEXT>
