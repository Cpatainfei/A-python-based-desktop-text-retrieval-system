   <HEADLINE> UP TO 70 % CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH MIDDAY MONDAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Surfers were out_in force Saturday to take_advantage of prime wave conditions ahead of the storm expected to arrive in Orange County early today . &quot; With no strong on-shore breezes , the ocean is smooth , not choppy , &quot; said Marine Safety Lt . Steve Davidson at Huntington City Beach , where an estimated 2 # 000 crowded the west_side of the pier to catch the waves . Despite the day ' s overcast skies and high_temperatures in the low to mid-60s , he said , &quot; it ' s good for surfing. &quot; Though rain is forecast , beach officials predicted that many of the wave riders would be back for more today , especially since strong winds are not expected . Forecasters are calling_for cloudy skies and a 60 % to 70 % chance of rain in Orange County , with the precipitation expected to end by midday Monday . In the Santa Barbara and Ventura coastal areas , some thunderstorms are forecast . The National Weather Service predicts half an inch of rain along Orange County ' s coasts and valleys , with heavier downpours in the mountains , said meteorologists at WeatherData , which provides forecasts for The Times . Snow is expected above 7 # 000 feet , which would exclude Orange County because none of its terrain reaches that altitude . The precipitation is being driven by a cold_front that started in the Gulf of Alaska at midweek and has been moving through the northern and central parts of California . At the same time , moisture has been building along the Southland coast for the past few days , WeatherData meteorologist Kris Farnsworth said , and that will fuel the storm . Winds along the beaches today will be from the west to southwest at 17 m.p.h. , with waves at two to three feet . Temperatures across Orange County will range from midmorning lows in the mid-40s to mid-50s , to afternoon highs in the lower to mid-60s .
