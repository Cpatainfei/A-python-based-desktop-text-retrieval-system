   <HEADLINE> LAST CHARGES ARE DROPPED BY NAVY IN TAILHOOK PROBE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Navy wrapped_up its Tailhook sex scandal investigation Friday with a decision not to revive charges against the last aviators facing misconduct trials . Vice Adm . J . Paul Reason , who handled Tailhook discipline , said &quot; no further judicial action &quot; will be taken , although he said he plans to write letters to three officers who had charges against them dismissed Tuesday . Reason acknowledged that some guilty aviators probably went unpunished . &quot; I ' m almost certain of it , &quot; he said at a news_conference . &quot; But what would you have me do about that ? Evidence is a requirement. &quot; Several investigations implicated 140 officers in the scandal over a 1991 convention of Navy and Marine Corps aviators . Dozens of women said they were assaulted at the Las Vegas gathering of the Tailhook Assn . About 50 officers received administrative discipline , but none went_on trial . Adm . Frank B . Kelso Jr. , the chief of naval operations , attended the convention and received a letter of caution . At a news_conference Friday , Kelso again denied a Navy judge ' s accusation that he witnessed some of the lewd conduct and interfered with the investigation . &quot; I ' ve been accused of lying , I ' ve been accused of manipulating the system to protect myself and others , and I categorically deny that , &quot; a visibly angry Kelso said at the Pentagon . &quot; I am not happy about this , &quot; he added . &quot; I am an honest man . I did not lie or manipulate any investigation. &quot; The 60-year-old Kelso said he intends to remain in office as the Navy ' s top admiral until his scheduled retirement at the end of June . &quot; I said from the beginning I didn ' t see anything untoward at Tailhook and I stick_by that . I did nothing to influence the process , &quot; Kelso said in an interview . &quot; I ' m going_to continue to serve in my job. &quot; Reason said no one tried to influence his handling of any cases . A statement issued Friday by Secretary_of_the_Navy John H . Dalton said he intends to complete his review of the case next week and then will make a decision &quot; as_to how to proceed with_respect_to Adm . Kelso. &quot; The Navy judge , Capt . William T . Vest Jr. , dismissed charges against Cmdrs . Thomas R . Miller and Gregory Tritt and Lt . David Samples , saying that Kelso ' s appointment of the person handling Tailhook discipline was inappropriate . Reason could have appealed Vest ' s ruling to the U.S. Court of Military Appeals or sent the cases to Dalton for review on whether to revive the prosecutions . Miller and Tritt were accused of witnessing misconduct by junior officers at Tailhook and failing to stop it . Samples had been charged with participating in an indecent assault on a woman who was stripped while being passed_over the heads of men in a gantlet on the third floor of the Las Vegas Hilton . All three men said they were innocent . They can now return to duty . In another development , Lt . Paula Coughlin , who blew the whistle on the scandal , has announced that she is resigning from the Navy . &quot; I ' d hoped that she ' d be able to stay in the Navy and make_it a career , &quot; Kelso said Friday . Coughlin said in a letter to Dalton that the assault &quot; and the covert and overt attacks on me that followed have stripped me of my ability to serve. &quot; In a statement released through her attorney , Coughlin said she has no specific plans , other_than concentrating &quot; on regaining my physical , emotional and mental health. &quot; &quot; I have no regrets about the course of action I chose in reporting the assault , &quot; she said . &quot; This is simply a personal decision forced by my own current needs. &quot; Coughlin is expected to remain at the helicopter combat support unit in Norfolk where she is assigned for the couple of months it will take_to process her resignation .</TEXT>
