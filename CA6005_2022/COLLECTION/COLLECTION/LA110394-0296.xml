   <HEADLINE> BIG NAMES , BIG FILMS : SO WHAT WENT_WRONG ? ; MOVIES : REDFORD ' S ' QUIZ SHOW ' AND BEATTY ' S ' LOVE_AFFAIR ' FIND LIMITS AT THE BOX_OFFICE . WHY DIDN ' T AUDIENCES RESPOND TO THE PROMINENT FILMMAKERS ' EFFORTS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They were two of the most highly anticipated films of the fall season , each made by veteran movie_stars and Oscar-winning filmmakers : &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; directed by Robert Redford , and &quot; Love_Affair , &quot; co-written and produced by the film ' s star , Warren Beatty . Both movies were backed by powerful studio marketing and distribution machines , and both were hyped to the hilt by their high-powered creators . Yet , the movies failed to ignite the box_office . Was &quot; Quiz Show &quot; too high-brow for middle America ? Does Beatty no longer have the drawing power to open a film , or is the country too cynical to accept an old-fashioned romantic melodrama ? &quot; It ' s risky to ask the audience to think , &quot; says Redford . &quot; I don ' t know whether they ' re in that mode or not. &quot; A circumspect Beatty said he hopes his film will still &quot; find its audience. &quot; Of the two , Disney ' s &quot; Quiz Show &quot; had all_the advantages . According to Redford , he received his best directing notices to date . In addition , &quot; Quiz Show &quot; provoked news_stories and editorial columns aplenty about the actual ' 50s scandal and what it says about America -- both now and then . From the start , the film has been consistently mentioned on the short_list for best picture and best director nominations . To date &quot; Quiz Show &quot; has grossed about $ 20 million , which , according to Entertainment Data Inc. ' s Tom Borys , is not particularly low given the film ' s &quot; reality drama &quot; genre . In the last year , the only films of a similar nature to do_better were &quot; Philadelphia &quot; ( $ 77 million ) and &quot; The Piano &quot; ( $ 44 million ) . Box_office for the movie , which stars Ralph Fiennes , started strong in big markets . The movie then slowly unfolded around the country . Too slowly , according to critics of Disney ' s release strategy . &quot; They left money on the table by not expanding more quickly , &quot; says one rival studio executive . &quot; That may have cost them as much as $ 10 million. &quot; The challenge from the start , says Dick Cook , Disney ' s distribution head , was to spread the bounty outward from the core urban audience . &quot; We did_well in every major city downtown theater , &quot; he said . &quot; But in suburban theaters we had only limited success. &quot; The play-out was similar to 1992 ' s &quot; A River Runs Through It , &quot; Redford ' s last directing effort , a film that was thought to have little commercial potential but wound_up grossing $ 43.4 million . The difference , says Redford , is that &quot; River &quot; was &quot; rural and went_deeper into the culture . ' Quiz Show ' is more sophisticated in nature and more urban . . . . Maybe it ' s reached the audience it was meant to reach. &quot; According to Borys , he may be right . The film should , with Oscar nominations , achieve numbers comparable_to last year ' s &quot; Remains of the Day , &quot; &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; and &quot; Shadowlands &quot; -- all_of which grossed $ 20 million to $ 30 million . * Another irony is that all_the media attention &quot; Quiz Show &quot; received may actually have backfired . &quot; It made_it sound like the film was a documentary , that it was good_for_you rather than entertainment , &quot; says Cook . &quot; The presentation of moral ambiguity in all_the characters may also have been a detriment , &quot; adds Eammon Bowles , head of distribution for the Samuel Goldwyn Co . &quot; Ultimately , the subject_matter may have been limiting . People like good_guys and bad_guys to root for . It ' s playing very much like a specialty film. &quot; Unfortunately , not at specialty prices . &quot; Quiz Show &quot; reportedly cost in the mid- $ 20-million range , before marketing . And , while Redford says that the media places too_much emphasis on box_office , he does admit that today ' s average_cost of a studio movie ( about $ 30 million before marketing ) makes such assessments inevitable . &quot; Those were the days , &quot; he sighs , about a time when films like &quot; Quiz Show &quot; could be made inexpensively and not have to gross $ 50 million in_order to show a profit . In the case of Warner Bros. ' &quot; Love_Affair , &quot; some Hollywood observers believe its modest performance ( just under $ 11 million through its first two weekends ) derives from several factors . Beatty was reluctant to discuss the movie ' s performance in detail , except to say , &quot; I like the movie very much . It ' s doing OK , and it will be nice if it continues to hang_in there and find its audience. &quot; A Warner Bros . official said the studio knew going_in that &quot; Love_Affair &quot; could be a tough sell . &quot; Clearly , this was an old-fashioned concept and an old-fashioned movie , &quot; said studio spokesman Rob Friedman . &quot; There were no special_effects . It had no violence , no sex . . . . &quot; Sadly , he added , perhaps today ' s audiences are just not drawn_in large_numbers to movies about &quot; starry-eyed romance. &quot; Then there is the generational factor . Friedman said that &quot; younger people did not come &quot; to &quot; Love_Affair &quot; but that the studio is not sure why . Some believe younger audiences do not readily identify with the 57-year-old Beatty as a romantic lead and question whether the actor is losing some of his drawing power . While a bona_fide star , he is usually not considered in the same league with Arnold Schwarzenegger , Mel Gibson , Kevin Costner or Tom Cruise , although they too have had box-office duds . &quot; I think we ' re seeing in the marketplace that actors of the Keanu Reeves generation are pulling moviegoers into theaters , not the Warren Beatty romantic-lead generation , &quot; said one official at a rival studio . &quot; With ' Speed ' and ' Interview With the Vampire , ' you have_young , sexy casts. &quot; On the other hand , TriStar ' s current romantic comedy , &quot; Only You , &quot; with young stars Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. , is struggling to find an audience . Some say audiences may_not feel the same attachment to Beatty as they did a similar character , Tom Hanks in &quot; Sleepless in Seattle. &quot; Directed by Glenn Gordon Caron , &quot; Love_Affair &quot; is a remake of the 1957 classic &quot; An Affair to Remember &quot; and the 1939 original &quot; Love Affair. &quot; * One agent suggested that &quot; thematically , ( ' Love_Affair ' ) is the story of a guy who is a womanizer who comes_to grips with his life after finding his true love . I don ' t know if that is enough to be drawn to a movie . In ' Sleepless in Seattle , ' Hanks was a sympathetic character who was still in mourning for his wife . You felt_for him . At the climax of the movie , at the top of the Empire_State Building , you were rooting for this guy , who you just loved . &quot; With ' Love_Affair , ' in real_life , everybody knows Beatty was a womanizer . Everybody knows his history . And , everybody knows he ' s married to Annette Bening , &quot; he said , referring to Beatty ' s co-star . Some believe the marriage may have turned_off filmgoers . ' You already know , in the back of your head , that they ' re together so you don ' t believe the tension , &quot; said one studio official . &quot; It takes the fantasy away , &quot; said another . &quot; If Beatty had been cast with Demi Moore or someone else , even though you know they ' ll get_together , it ' s more suspense , &quot; said another industry source . Friedman said if their marriage was to blame , it never appeared in the exit polls taken of test audiences . One real problem with the movie , some say , was that it lacks sufficient romance . &quot; There ' s no love in it , no spark in it -- none of those things you go_to a romantic film for , &quot; said one studio executive. &quot; Industry sources say that Warner Bros . stands to lose a lot of money on &quot; Love_Affair , &quot; which is estimated to have cost more_than $ 40 million . One high-profile agent suggested : &quot; Assuming that it cost $ 40 million to $ 50 million to make and they spent another $ 15 million to open it , you ' re chasing a lot of money . . . maybe it will gross $ 20 million ( domestically ) . &quot; Friedman said the $ 40-million production figure is &quot; high &quot; and estimated that the film will top out at $ 30 million domestically and have a good afterlife in overseas release . * Robert Welkos is a Times staff writer ; Richard Natale is a regular contributor to Calendar .</TEXT>
