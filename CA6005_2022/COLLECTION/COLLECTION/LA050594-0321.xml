   <TEXT> The palm-shaded town of Jericho and the broiling slums of the Gaza Strip became the centers of a new Palestinian homeland Wednesday as Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization , bickering to the last moment , signed an unprecedented pact on Palestinian self-rule . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin expressed fears that the PLO is not ready to assume the government of its turbulent people over the next three weeks . But he still signed with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat the final autonomy accord , which for the first time in the modern era puts Palestinians in control of territories in the historic land of Palestine . As hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were released from Israeli jails and the first Palestinian police crossed the border from Egypt into Gaza , Israel and the PLO ended almost seven months of often painful negotiations with a last-minute dispute over maps . That disagreement left Rabin and Arafat fuming in frustration on stage as the signing drama unfolded in front of an audience of 2 # 500 dignitaries and of television viewers around the world . &quot; We are trying to create peaceful coexistence between two entities where there is no love lost between them , and I put it mildly , &quot; Rabin explained of the dispute that came as one of the world ' s most enduring conflicts was about to move a major step closer to resolution . But both Rabin and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were adamant that Israel is determined to make_peace work . Peres , as he stepped to the podium , looked over at the PLO chairman , clad in khaki military dress , and grinned , &quot; Chairman Arafat , our partner in a very difficult journey : We did_it ! &quot; For almost half a century , we experienced blood and hatred , terror and war , &quot; Peres said . &quot; Today , we declare that the conflict is over . We don ' t want to be the generals , the judges or the police of the Palestinian people . . . . Today , we welcome you , the Palestinian people , as neighbors. &quot; Arafat , whose irritation over the map reflected months of frustration at trying to turn the Declaration of Principles signed last September into a meaningful statement of Palestinian independence , stood subdued for much of the ceremony . He kept his hands clasped behind his back , stared straight ahead and tapped his left foot . &quot; If this step needs great courage to complete it after long decades of war and violence , then the coming steps will need even greater courage and deep vision , &quot; Arafat said . &quot; Our peoples have struggled for a very , very long_time to witness this day . . . . We must all realize that all those who are lovers of peace must consider the seriousness of this step to see that it is carefully executed and implemented. &quot; Wednesday ' s signing touches_off a rapid series of events in the occupied territories , as Israel prepares to make its first troop withdrawal from Palestinian lands it has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War . A total of 6 # 000 new Palestinian police are to arrive in Gaza and Jericho over the next week to two weeks , and the hundreds of prisoners released from Israeli jails Wednesday are the first of 5 # 000 scheduled to be freed during the next two weeks . The PLO will appoint a 24-member Palestinian Authority to take_over within the next three weeks , to be replaced later in the year by an elected council that eventually will govern all_over the West_Bank . Talks on the final status of the territories , including the issue of Palestinian statehood and the future of Jerusalem , will not begin for three years . Arafat ' s remarks Wednesday reflected PLO concerns that the new autonomy in Gaza and Jericho , a dramatic gamble that risks alienating millions of Palestinians , must represent a meaningful enough step to relieve years of pent-up frustration . The PLO chairman seethed over Israel ' s reluctance to grant a significant block of territory for Palestinian control in Jericho . In the end , the Israelis conceded 25 square_miles -- half what Arafat had pleaded for at the last minute , though the issue remains subject_to further discussions . The Israelis also declined to grant symbolic concessions , such_as Palestinian police on the international borders and the designation of Arafat as rais , an Arabic word that could be defined as president . The PLO sees all these stands as shortsighted and counterproductive to its attempts to lure support amid what has been an ambivalent or even hostile public . For his part , Rabin expressed fears that the two sides spent so_much time negotiating the agreement that not enough attention was paid on the Palestinian side to preparing_for a transition from Israeli military rule to Palestinian autonomy . His remarks were a clear indication that Israel does not expect the transition in the next few weeks to go smoothly . As an example , Rabin said Israel on Wednesday paid salaries to 24 # 000 employees in Gaza , about 6 # 000 of them permanent employees of the civil administration . &quot; Tomorrow we will leave . Who will pay these 24 # 000 people ? We can leave in two weeks , but ( who will ) . . . handle all these problems ? &quot; Rabin asked at a news_conference after the signing ceremony . Rabin also raised fears that most of the 9 # 000-member police_force and additional civilian cadres returning to administer Gaza and Jericho have not been in the West_Bank and Gaza for some time , in many cases since Israel ' s occupation of the region in 1967 . &quot; How long will it take them to acquaint themselves with the situation there ? &quot; he fretted . &quot; There are practical problems that , unfortunately , focus was not given enough for proper preparation in the handing_over . . . ( and ) we have now unfortunately to waste time. &quot; He said Arafat , apparently heeding the same concerns , hinted early Tuesday that he might favor drawing_out the coming transition period . While Rabin said Israeli forces can be out_in two to three weeks , or even days , Arafat seemed to be suggesting a four-week withdrawal , he said . In Israel , where Jewish settlers seized the synagogue at Jericho and dozens more gathered for prayers and psalm readings , the opposition to the Rabin-Peres peace overtures in Cairo was already building . &quot; This is a black day for the state of Israel , and one of the most difficult days in the history of Zionism , &quot; said Likud opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu . &quot; Rabin will be able to say , ' In Cairo , I established the Palestinian state , the Palestinian terrorist state. ' &quot; Zvi Hendel , a Jewish settler in Neve Dekelim , told Army Radio : &quot; We are continuing to build , to live , to take_in new residents , and with the help of God are waiting for better days when there will be a new government. &quot; Syria -- which , like Lebanon , did not send a foreign_minister to Wednesday ' s glittering signing ceremony -- vowed that it will never sign a separate peace with Israel . &quot; Such separate and partial solutions would put obstacles in the way of the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace that should be based on U.N. resolutions and the principle of land for peace , &quot; the official Syrian daily Al Thawra said . Radical Palestinian factions in Lebanese refugee camps , who have little to gain from autonomy in Gaza and Jericho , demonstrated against the agreement , burning tires , calling_for strikes and hailing posters that said &quot; To Hell With the Shameful Cairo Agreement. &quot; Wednesday ' s signing ceremony -- held_in the presence of such dignitaries as Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev , Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and their counterparts from nations around the globe -- was hosted by Egypt on the occasion of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ' s 66th birthday . Conducted at a conference_center only a_few hundred yards from the reviewing stand where Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was assassinated after he made his daring , single-handed peace with Israel , the PLO-Israeli ceremony to a great degree culminated Egypt ' s attempts to square its peacemaking with its Arab neighbors . Isolated and rejected by Arabs for years because of the 1979 Camp David accords , Egyptian diplomats have worked feverishly to help broker the PLO accord . Mubarak beamed as he declared , &quot; A historical move toward peace in the land of peace has started. &quot; The signing took_place against a stage backdrop of the Sphinx , a pyramid and twinkling stars ; Christopher , Kozyrev and Mubarak all signed as witnesses . &quot; We live_in an age of political wonder , where old hatreds are giving_way to new hopes , &quot; Christopher declared . &quot; With leadership , vision and courage , peace between old enemies is possible . . . . We ' re here today because unspeakable acts of violence could not still the voices of peace , or weaken the resolve of the peacemakers. &quot; Among the audience of international political_leaders , intellectuals and artists were delegations from Jewish American and Arab American groups and other political organizations . &quot; It borders_on the unbelievable . You have to pinch yourself that these dramatic_events are happening . It ' s an incredible tribute to the tenacity of the parties to commit to make_peace despite the obstacles in the way of Rabin and Arafat , &quot; said former Westside congressman Mel Levine , co-chair of Builders for Peace , a group of American Jews and Arabs working to promote deals that will facilitate a better life in the territories with the onset of peace . Stanley Sheinbaum , former president of the Los Angeles Police Commission and one of five American Jews who broke the ice on the peace process in 1988 by visiting Arafat , observed of Wednesday ' s accord : &quot; It means that the idea of peace is increasingly acceptable and realistic and that major change among the mainstream political groups is possible . &quot; Not all groups have come_around , &quot; he added . &quot; But this helps show that having direct contact is the best way to go_to find peace. &quot; Times staff writers Robin Wright in Cairo and Michael Parks in Jerusalem contributed to this report . The Contract for Freedom Palestinians in two areas of the territories Israel occupied in 1967 -- Jericho , in the West_Bank , and the Gaza Strip -- are about to experience their first freedom after 27 years of occupation . KEY POINTS IN THE PACT * What the Palestinians get : Responsibility for a broad range of_their_own affairs , ranging from health services and police to zoning , tourism , air service , fishing and finances . * What Israel gets : Overall security responsibility in the occupied territories and control of international borders . * A new government : A new appointed Palestinian Authority headed by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat will become the effective government in Gaza and Jericho , with its authority expanded throughout the West_Bank later this year . * Palestinian police : The autonomous territories will be policed by 9 # 000 Palestinian police_officers , rather than Israeli troops . About 7 # 000 will be drawn from PLO troops throughout the Middle_East and the rest from the West_Bank and Gaza . * Troop withdrawal : Israeli troops will immediately begin withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho , with withdrawal to be completed within three weeks . * Israeli military options : Israeli retains the right to move troops into Gaza and Jericho in the event of an outbreak of general hostilities or threats to the safety of Israeli settlements . Israeli troops will remain around Jewish settlements in Gaza as well as at military_installation area nearby . * Jewish settlements : Jewish settlements will remain in place , though they may be consolidated to provide better security . WHAT PALESTINIANS FAILED TO GET * More room : Jericho will remain only a little larger than the existing city_limits , much smaller than the 93-square-mile enclave the PLO had envisioned . But the boundaries are subject_to further discussion . * Own currency : There will be no Palestinian currency , though talks on that issue are continuing . * Economic independence : The Palestinian economy will remain to a very large degree dependent_on Israel . Palestinians will regulate banks and set taxes on imports and income , but Israel retains customs quotas on a broad range of goods to protect against a flood of cheap Palestinian goods , including gasoline . TIMETABLE 1 ) Israeli troops are to begin an immediate withdrawal from Jericho and the Gaza Strip . 2 ) The first Palestinian police_officers begin arriving , with 6 # 000 to be deployed in the first two weeks . 3 ) The new governing Palestinian Authority will be appointed and take power in Gaza and Jericho within three weeks . 4 ) Elections to appoint a governing council throughout the West_Bank are tentatively scheduled for Oct . 10 .
