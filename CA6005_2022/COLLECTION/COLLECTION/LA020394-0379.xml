   <HEADLINE> A LUCKY START TO CHINESE NEW YEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sometime between taking a bite of white clumped rice and passing the steamed fish , I realized that even small actions like these could determine my destiny in the coming year . According to Chinese superstition , that is . Chinese New Year ' s Day , Feb . 10 , is a date that signifies the beginning of the 10th year in the cycle of the Chinese calendar , the Year of the Dog . Rather than being just a twist on zodiac astrology , the Chinese New Year -- and the new year in a number of other cultures -- is based on a lunar_calendar . The calendar is based on the phases_of_the_moon , which signaled to the ancient farmers when to plant and when to harvest . Chinese New Year ' s Day traditionally falls on the day after the crops are all harvested , when it is a time to feast on the plentiful abundance that hard work has produced and secure a new start for another lucky year . The plate of fish in my hand , covered with green_onion and ginger , is traditionally cooked whole even though there is a risk of an eyeball dislodging and rolling across the plate as it is served . The fish represents prosperity in the coming year , and no matter how little it is , there is always meat left on the plate to symbolize abundance so great that there are leftovers . Other foods eaten_on Chinese New Year ' s Day include boiled baby spinach_plants that have to be consumed in one bite , roots and all , even if the mouthful makes soy_sauce dribble down your chin . The spinach_plants represent longevity , and biting one in two would be cutting your life short . Eating glutinous desserts made from sweet rice flour gives &quot; sweet &quot; success in your job or work in the year to come . The real work begins on the night before the Chinese New Year commences . During that evening , the entire house must be thoroughly cleaned for a fresh_start in the new year , and all preparations must be made_for the feast and festivities the next day . &quot; If you do any work_on the first day of the new year , even if you pick_up a broom , &quot; my mother said , wagging her finger at me , &quot; that means your entire year will be filled with hard , unfulfilling labor. &quot; Though relaxing during the day does not necessarily guarantee a vacation during the entire year , it is a time where children can play and be as naughty as they want without being subject_to their parents ' disapproval . Any anger or unhappiness expressed on New Year ' s Day will mean strife between family members for the rest of the year . Much like an American holiday , keeping peace in the household becomes difficult when it involves the gathering of family and relatives for a feast . Once again , however , the children gain an advantage because each relative presents them with an elongated , perfumed red envelope embossed with gold Chinese characters for luck and fortune . Red , the traditional color representing luckiness , complements the gold printing , which stands_for gold and wealth . Upon carefully lifting the edge of a red envelope , a child discovers that the inside is filled with crisp , new money and best wishes from his or her elders for the upcoming year . * With money in_hand and a sweet taste in their mouths from eating desserts , the family then piles into the car , careful not to let arguments ensue about who is to sit in the front seat , to head for a Chinatown , where the annual Chinese Dragon Parade takes_place . The dragon , a long , snake-like beast with colored scales as variable as the rainbow , is supported by a file of men who duck , dive and zigzag down the street to animate a dragon chasing a large_white pearl , another symbol of wealth . Its head , with a green snout and fiery eyes , wags and shakes as it parades a crooked path . The surrounding crowd waves and cheers at the dragon ' s awkward movements in reaching the pearl , then laughs when the pearl slips out from under its nose again . In conjunction with an old Chinese legend , strings of noisy red firecrackers are set_off simultaneously with the discord of the drums and cymbals of the parade . The tradition of igniting firecrackers on the first day of Chinese New Year is said to have originated as an attempt by a widow to save her toddler son from a ravenous marine beast that came each New Year ' s Day to feast on the humans of a seaside village . The mother scared_off the beast by setting_off fireworks made of bamboo and yelling as she banged on pots and pans . The same clanging sound with glass upon glass startles me out of my reverie and , lifting my cup with my family around the table , we toast the New Year with goodwill greetings . And , as my attention focuses_on the faces surrounding me , the thought remains that if one auspicious day could actually become a prediction of the future , then I would indeed have a very lucky year .</TEXT>
