   <HEADLINE> YOUR WHEELS : THE GOODS ; PUSHING FOR A ' LEMON LAW ' WITH MORE BITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Automobile quality has increased so_much in the last 10 years that many buyers mistakenly believe that they no longer have to worry about getting stuck_with a lemon . In fact , thousands of new cars sold in California each year are the subject of arbitration . An unknown number of additional cases end_up in various courts . This summer , consumer advocates are fighting to strengthen California ' s &quot; lemon law , &quot; which is widely regarded by consumer organizations as among the weakest in the nation . Under California law , auto_makers can offer arbitration to dissatisfied motorists , but some of these arbitration programs do not meet state guidelines . A recent study by the California Public Interest Research Group showed marked discrepancies in the records of those auto_makers that do offer certified arbitration . Saturn far outperformed all other makes , having just one arbitration complaint for every 2 # 623 cars sold in 1993 . Volkswagen had the worst record with one dispute for every 37 vehicles sold . In rising order of complaints per car sold in California , the others were Infiniti , Lexus , Nissan , Toyota , General Motors , Chrysler , Ford and Isuzu . Honda , Acura and Hyundai have uncertified arbitration programs , while BMW , Mazda , Mercedes , Mitsubishi , Subaru and Suzuki have no programs at all . Moreover , when California car owners do file for arbitration , they are likely to fare worse than motorists in other states . Just 25 % of arbitration complaints led to a refund or replacement in California , compared to 48 % in New York , 50 % in Florida and 64 % in Washington , according to a study by Motor Voters , a Sacramento consumer group . Assemblywoman Jackie Speier ( D-Burlingame ) introduced a bill in the California Assembly this year that would mandate a state-run arbitration program covering all car_makers , financed by a $ 3 tax on every new car sale . The bill allows a motorist to arbitrate if a car_maker was unable to fix a defect after three attempts in the first 12 months , among other tough provisions . The auto industry has been fighting the bill and may yet defeat it . Jane Lightfoot , an attorney for the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn. , said auto_makers do not oppose arbitration , but the Speier bill has provisions that &quot; would be injurious to the industry. &quot; Lightfoot expressed concern that the $ 3 tax is too high and auto_makers would not get a fair chance to fix a problem before getting_into arbitration . The Assembly passed the measure in June , but the bill faces stiff Senate opposition as the session draws to a close .</TEXT>
