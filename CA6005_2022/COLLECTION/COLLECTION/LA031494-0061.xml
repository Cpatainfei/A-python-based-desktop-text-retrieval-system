   <HEADLINE> AGING U.S. COPTERS SENT TO SOMALIA , PAKISTANI CHARGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A senior Pakistani official Sunday charged that the U.S. military is leasing obsolete helicopters to the U.N. peacekeeping force the United States is leaving_behind in Somalia , and he indicated to the visiting chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs_of_Staff that without better equipment the entire mission could be jeopardized . In a news_conference closing his 22-hour tour of U.S. and U.N. camps in the lawless Somali capital , Gen . John M . Shalikashvili said he will review Pakistan ' s request when he returns to Washington . He also confirmed that the eight AH-1S Cobra attack helicopters that Pakistani pilots will fly over Somalia under a $ 40-million U.S. rental agreement came from old stock in the Hawaii National_Guard . Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali told reporters that some of the Cobras have 45 minutes of flying time left before they are no longer airworthy . Assef and Pakistani Defense Minister Aftab Shahban Mirani , during a visit here to celebrate the Islamic holiday Eid al Fitr with Pakistan ' s 5 # 500 troops , lodged their complaint with Shalikashvili and also urged him to provide additional air_power to the U.N. forces , including scout helicopters and aerial surveillance equipment . But Shalikashvili said Pakistani officers , who will command the largest single force after the last U.S. soldier withdraws March 25 , told him Saturday night that the equipment already leased will give them enough force to continue the mission . The 10-month lease includes 30 U.S. tanks and 80 armored personnel_carriers . Still , Assef ' s comments underscored a sense of bitterness and abandonment among the largely Third_World armies that will stay behind after the United States and a dozen other Western and Middle Eastern nations withdraw their last troops from Somalia in the next two weeks . &quot; Are Pakistani lives worth less than those that come from the West ? &quot; Assef asked , referring to what he called the &quot; outmoded and substandard &quot; Cobra helicopters . He said the pullout , ordered after the United States suffered high casualties in a firefight last October , could open the United Nations and the West to charges of racism . &quot; We are very dismayed by this , &quot; Assef said of the remaining peacekeeping force that will be almost entirely Asian and African -- among them the Pakistani force that arrived in September , 1992 , months before thousands of Americans landed on the beaches of Mogadishu . &quot; It is beginning to look_like Europeans for Bosnia , and Africans and Asians for Somalia , &quot; he said , adding that it &quot; smacked of racism. &quot; Assef said that if Shalikashvili and the U.N. Security_Council cannot satisfy Pakistan ' s concerns , &quot; we will have to take a very careful look_at what sort of role we are going_to have in the future -- and if we are going_to have a role. &quot; Privately , U.N. military_officers said the Somali mission almost certainly will collapse if Pakistan , which suffered more casualties here than the United States , decides to withdraw . Asked whether he believes that the United States , which initially led the mission to save Somalia from famine and self-destruction , is abandoning the country , Assef said : &quot; Life in America is very good . Nobody in America wants to die for anybody else ' s causes. &quot; Shalikashvili gave the opposite message Sunday . Speaking_to hundreds of U.S. Army , Air_Force , Navy and Marine personnel through a field megaphone inside Mogadishu airport ' s cavernous hangar , Shalikashvili said : &quot; We all came here not because we wanted to get any credit for it . . . but for no other reason than to help someone else , someone in need . that ' s an awful noble thing to do . &quot; I leave here with a very good conscience , &quot; the chairman told reporters at Mogadishu ' s heavily guarded airport moments before his Boeing 707 left for home . &quot; I leave here thinking_about the good things we have done . And I leave here with a guarded optimism about what lies ahead. &quot; That optimism came despite spreading anarchy throughout the country and his own top commanders ' assessments that lawlessness will increase after the U.S. soldiers leave . Underscoring such concerns , two rounds apparently fired from a mortar or rocket_launcher in the capital exploded at_sea a_few hundred yards from several U.S. warships and from the seaside headquarters of the U.S. commander , Maj . Gen . Thomas Montgomery , where Shalikashvili spent Saturday night . U.S. Army spokesman Col . Steve Rausch said it was unclear what was targeted . Before his departure , Shalikashvili addressed fears that the U.N. mission -- indeed , the Somali nation -- will disintegrate after the U.S. peacekeepers exit , leaving_behind about 1 # 000 American diplomats and civilians on shore and only about 50 U.S. Marines to guard them . &quot; You and I hope that after we ' re gone , the Somalis will put their country back together , &quot; he told the American forces . &quot; No one can erase the good that you and your buddies did here . And for the Somalis , well , we can ' t guarantee their safety for the rest of their lives. &quot;</TEXT>
