   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE ECONOMY ; START ISSUING U.S. BONDS IN YEN ; IT WOULD EASE PRESSURES ON THE DOLLAR , REASSURE WORLD MARKETS AND REVIVE JAPANESE INVESTMENT IN AMERICA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the foreseeable future , the United States will run a sizable current-account deficit , while Japan will continue to post an equally large current-account surplus . Forecasts for the respective balances are in the range of $ 120 billion to $ 130 billion . Due_to the imbalance in domestic savings rates , there is a need for a significant flow of Japanese savings into U.S. coffers . However , as a consequence of the phenomenal strengthening of the yen against the dollar in recent years , Japanese investors in dollar-denominated assets already feel badly burned . The value of these assets has eroded in a spectacular fashion . Some observers estimate their losses to be in the range of $ 300 billion . Under these circumstances , it is quite unlikely that Japanese investors will be keen on re-entering the market to buy U.S. assets with dollars in a significant volume . This leads us to a conclusion discomfiting for all major economies : The dollar would become even weaker and , in_order to defend its eroding currency , the United States would have to raise interest_rates significantly above the levels indicated by conditions in the domestic economy . Its current upswing would be an obvious victim along the road . Japan ' s domestic economic problems would also worsen . Over the past year and a half , the country has -- for the first time in its postwar history -- seen domestic production capacity lie fallow . In the process , an outright culture shock has hit Japan . It has had to cope_with the unwelcome fact that the bureaucrats have proved themselves incapable of managing the economy according to plan . In addition , the resulting shift toward investment outside of Japan will do little to stimulate the opening_up of the country ' s domestic economy . What can be done_in the light of these circumstances ? One constructive step would be if the U.S. Treasury , or at least some government_agency , began to issue yen-denominated paper ( bonds whose value is in yen rather than dollars ) . This approach would have several advantages . First , the markets have been telling the U.S._government -- despite its reasonable assurances -- that they are not certain whether the Clinton_Administration can be relied_upon not to use the exchange_rate as a tool to promote U.S. competitiveness . Right or wrong , as long as that perception is out there , the politicians in Washington are forced to deal with it . Issuing yen-denominated U.S. Treasury_bonds would provide crucial comfort to Japanese institutional investors . With new bond assets denominated in the yen , they would no longer have to assume the exchange-rate risk . It would therefore go_a_long_way toward enticing the Japanese to once again recycle their trade surplus . But more important , it represents a very potent tool to convince the markets of the credibility of the Clinton_Administration ' s intentions . By taking this step , it would show itself prepared to put its money where its mouth is . By using a foreign currency to fund part of its debt , the U.S._government effectively assumes the exchange-rate risk on such debt . In other words , it would stand to lose if the dollar went_down even further . Under this scenario , it would get fewer yen for the dollars it budgeted to service that debt and would thus be forced to spend more dollars than planned . While this may sound dangerous at first sight , the downside risk is very much worth taking . Aside from eliminating the nagging doubts about the real intentions of the Administration , these yen-denominated Treasury instruments could be issued at interest_rates below current U.S. levels . Given the lower level of interest_rates prevailing in Japan , they would still be very attractive to investors in the yen zone . Obviously , this would also help reduce the potential costs of the exchange_rate risk mentioned above . What should be the size of such yen-denominated U.S. public_debt ? While obviously limited in scope initially , this kind of funding could eventually be as high as the Japanese share of the U.S. current_account deficit . That amounts to roughly $ 70 billion , which coincidentally is equal_to one-third of the federal budget_deficit . Why should I , a European , be concerned about all this ? First , none of the world ' s major industrialized economies benefits from wild swings in exchange_rates . Second , we Europeans have worked hard at_home to bring_about exchange-rate stability . Against much skepticism in the markets , and due_to an ever-increasing degree of coordination in economic and fiscal_policy as well as a result of greater trade integration , we are reaping the benefits of such stability within the European Monetary System . However , there always is a danger that this delicate balance may be upset , primarily due_to extraneous circumstances ( for instance , great volatility in the dollar-yen exchange rate. ) . Such cross-rate pressures may well have significant spillover effects on European currencies , thus upsetting the balance established within the system . Yet there is an even more important issue . Europe currently finds itself the bystander in what it considers to be an unproductive fight on trade issues between the United States , the world ' s sole remaining superpower , and Japan , a country without much of a functioning government and therefore in some disarray . This dispute leaves the world financial system vulnerable . If we were to see domino effects , for example as a result of overleveraged Japanese firms collapsing due_to an excessive use of the exchange-rate weapon and a potentially unaware lender of last_resort ( the Japanese government ) , the world financial markets might be at risk .</TEXT>
