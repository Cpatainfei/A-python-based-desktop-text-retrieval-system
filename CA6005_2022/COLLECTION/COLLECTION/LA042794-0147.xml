   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN SERBS AVERT AIR STRIKES WITH PULLBACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Serb gunmen grudgingly withdrew tanks and artillery from around battered Gorazde on Tuesday , U.N. officials said , averting the threat of NATO air strikes against weapons that had been savaging the &quot; safe haven. &quot; U.N. forces patrolling Gorazde reported evacuation of all known gun_emplacements by nightfall , although it remained unclear whether the weaponry had actually been removed from the 12-mile exclusion zone proclaimed by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . Even before U.N. ground forces in Gorazde relayed their general impression that the Serbs had complied with the withdrawal order , the peacekeeping mission here showed itself to be extremely reluctant to approve the use of force to impose the NATO ultimatum , probably fearing that any outside attack could do more damage to its operation than to the defiant rebels . &quot; We are not going_to go_to_war over a broken-down tank , &quot; British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia , said of the uncertain Serbian compliance and mounting Western pressure to show the rebels some military resolve . The 15 # 000-plus troops of the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia are deployed on a neutral , humanitarian mission , and Rose has stated he sees no prospect of &quot; bombing our way to peace. &quot; Throughout the monthlong crisis triggered by the Bosnian Serb offensive against Gorazde , Rose and other top U.N. officials have played_down the severity of the fighting that killed or wounded nearly 3 # 000 . They have also granted vast leeway to the rebels each time they violated cease-fire orders . &quot; All the sites in the 20-kilometer ( 12-mile ) exclusion zone where the Bosnian Serb army ' s heavy_weapons were previously located have been reported by U.N. military observers as being cleared , &quot; said a U.N. spokesman , Cmdr . Eric Chaperon . About 500 U.N. troops have been deployed to Gorazde over the past two days to separate the Muslim-led government forces and the rebel Serbs . NATO reconnaissance flights in the afternoon showed some tanks and artillery still within the weapons exclusion zone , and Chaperon earlier conceded that some Serbian infantry remained within a 1.9-mile radius of central Gorazde -- a safety_zone from which the rebels were supposed to have pulled_out three days ago . As the Bosnian Serb soldiers retreated from the inner protected zone Sunday , they looted and burned hundreds of houses and blew_up a water_plant . U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi , the civilian head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission for the Balkans , denounced the &quot; scorched earth &quot; tactics and lodged a protest with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic . Despite evidence to the contrary , the Bosnian Serb leadership had announced itself in full compliance with the withdrawal edict 12 hours before the NATO deadline of 5:01 p.m. PST Tuesday , or 2:01 a.m. Wednesday local_time . When NATO Secretary_General Manfred Woerner warned Friday that the alliance would call_in air strikes against the Serbian war machine unless shelling of the haven ceased immediately , the rebels pulled_back their troops to the protected zone border by early Sunday , and all U.N. troops and relief operations were granted unhindered freedom of movement . Yet Bosnian Serb forces have continued to hamper troops and aid convoys throughout Bosnia . A food convoy was let into Gorazde in the morning after a 24-hour blockade by Bosnian Serb gunmen , but a separate delivery of shelter materials was turned_back by the rebels who claimed the tents and plastic sheeting were military materials . The Bosnian Serbs also have been sighted moving tanks and other heavy_weapons back into an exclusion zone proclaimed around Sarajevo in February , after NATO threatened to bomb the hardware if it was not surrendered or pulled_back . Although the rebels have failed to adhere to the letter of any of the recent peace orders , U.N. officials have been reluctant to approve punitive air strikes . Two token attacks by U.S. warplanes on April 10 and 11 prompted a massive campaign of harassment and hostage-taking that handcuffed U.N. operations . Meantime , in London on Tuesday , a new , international &quot; contact group &quot; on Bosnia -- which consists_of the United States , the United Nations , the European Union and Russia -- agreed to begin negotiations with the warring parties in Sarajevo on Thursday , senior U.S. officials said . But the new diplomatic initiative is dependent_on Bosnian Serb compliance with the NATO ultimatum that the rebels pull_back their heavy_weapons around Gorazde , U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher emphasized . Times staff writer Robin Wright in Geneva contributed to this report .</TEXT>
