   <TEXT> Futurist Alvin Toffler outlined the evolution of power in his recent book , &quot; Power Shift. &quot; In the distant past , Toffler wrote , power derived from brute force , and in recent centuries from wealth , but now the Age of Information has arrived . Digby Diehl , moderator of a recent symposium , &quot; Books to Bytes : Tension in the Transition , &quot; sponsored by Occidental College and Vroman ' s Bookstore , spoke_of Toffler ' s concept in his opening remarks . An audience of 250 attended the event . Panelists Ward Ritchie , scholar and publisher , and John Espey , UCLA professor and author , are both legendary in Southern California ' s relatively short literary history . Dressed in conservative coats and ties , these two distinguished octogenarians represented &quot; Books &quot; while Paul Saffo , 39 , a director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park represented &quot; Bytes. &quot; On a low table in front of the dais , a six-volume , leather-bound set of Gibbon ' s &quot; The Roman_Empire &quot; rested between marble bookends next to a computer_keyboard and screen . The setting itself seemed to pose the question , &quot; What form will books take_after the Transition ? &quot; While Espey and Ritchie are revered figures , Saffo inspired something closer to a nervous awe as a cybernetic seer , a &quot; techno-guru. &quot; Most of the questions from the audience were for him . Ritchie , 89 , was raised in South Pasadena and founded Ward Ritchie Press in 1936 , specializing in publishing books on the American West , from histories to cookbooks . Ritchie said he believes books will be the prime repositories of ideas and expression in the future . Espey , 81 , shared many of the reservations others voiced about the printed page being entirely replaced by new media , he did suggest that listening to books on tape in L.A. traffic_jams allow many to actually reach the end of great ( lengthy ) Russian novels . The average age of the audience was close to , if no over 50 . Virtually every person to rise with a question identified themselves as a librarian and , with the exception of Cal Tech ' s librarian , they seemed a bit dubious about the unmixed blessing of he information superhighway . The concerns raised by those asking questions or making comments reflected practical concerns , a_few aesthetic issues and , frankly , more_than a little &quot; technophobia &quot; ( the phrase &quot; soulless technology &quot; was used ) . At one point Saffo , the panel ' s &quot; tekkie &quot; described a state-of-the-art document titled &quot; Agrippa. &quot; It is a short_story by sci-fi author William Gibson . Saffo said the deluxe edition is $ 14 # 000 but went_on to explain that both available formats , paper and computer disc are very temporary . The paper edition is printed with ink containing chemicals causing the text to slowly vanish after exposure to light . The disc has a built-in computer virus that &quot; eats &quot; the text as the screen , on automatic scroll , allows only one chance to read and no chance to print it out . Ward Ritchie , who has spent his career in publishing creating carefully crafted books , cringed visibly when he heard this . Diehl , musing on the possibility of a book-less world , asked Saffo if the libraries and bookstores of the future would be &quot; nothing more_than electronic filling_stations ? &quot; Saffo , too witty to play the villain , underscored the fact that technology can have a human_face . At one point he observed , &quot; talking_about the future of books to this group is like talking_about the future of religion in front of the pope. &quot; Steve Tice</TEXT>
