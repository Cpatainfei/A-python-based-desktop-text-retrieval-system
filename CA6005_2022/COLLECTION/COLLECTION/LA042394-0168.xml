   <HEADLINE> SERBS DEFY NATO , CONTINUE SIEGE ; BALKANS : AS AIR STRIKES LOOM , GORAZDE ' S MAYOR DESCRIBES SCENES OF CARNAGE IN EMBATTLED ENCLAVE . U.N. TROOPS CAUGHT IN MIDDLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Serbian gunmen willing to take_on the world , and U.N. officers loath to confront them , maneuvered ominously Friday in anticipation of NATO air strikes that threaten a colossal escalation of the Balkan war . Despite a warning by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization of massive air_attacks unless the Bosnian Serb assault on the city of Gorazde ceases immediately , nationalist rebels continued to pound artillery shells into the crowded U.N. safe area , the mayor of Gorazde reported via ham radio . U.N. Protection Force commanders recalled a blocked convoy of 141 peacekeepers headed for besieged Gorazde , only to have their return to Sarajevo halted by rebels intent_on keeping them as a potential human shield against Western bombardment . NATO officials meeting in Brussels gave the Serbs until just after midnight tonight local_time to pull_back all gunmen and artillery 1.9 miles from Gorazde and to let U.N. troops and humanitarian aid through to its 65 # 000 desperate inhabitants . Gorazde suffered another day of fierce bombardment as Bosnian Serb leaders engaged in fruitless peace talks in Belgrade with the top U.N. civilian in the war-torn Balkans , Yasushi Akashi of Japan . Shelling and sniper fire killed 99 people and wounded nearly 300 in a second day of carnage among the Muslims herded into the city_center and exposed to the wrath of the militant nationalist rebels . The death toll Thursday was 97 . The city ' s mayor , Ismet Briga , described a scene of horror , with human corpses and animal carcasses littering streets so racked by artillery_fire and gunfire that harried medics could not retrieve the victims . Four aid workers with the U.N. Office of the High_Commissioner for Refugees trapped in Gorazde reported intense bombardment of vital facilities filled with desperate civilians displaced earlier in the 3-week-old siege . &quot; The hospital has been hit several times again , &quot; said the Sarajevo spokesman for the refugee agency , Kris Janowski . &quot; The area is shrouded in smoke. &quot; The U.N. airlift of food and vital supplies to Sarajevo resumed Friday after a 12-day suspension after token air strikes April 10-11 . Some relief officials speculated , however , that the move was more an effort to stock up supplies for an expected escalation of the conflict than an indication that the security concerns have abated . Janowski said he hoped that the Serbs comply with the NATO ultimatum , warning : &quot; Otherwise , we ' re facing a humanitarian disaster which we will be talking_about for a long_time . What has happened is bad enough , but it could get_worse if the indiscriminate shelling continues. &quot; Serbian rebels see Gorazde as a vital part of the rogue republic they have carved out of Bosnia because it is at the junction of two important roadways and the Drina River . It is also one of only three surviving Muslim pockets in eastern Bosnia , which has otherwise been conquered and subjected_to the Serbs ' brutal policy of &quot; ethnic cleansing. &quot; In Belgrade , the Yugoslav capital , Akashi met with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic , his Bosnian proxy , Radovan Karadzic , and the Bosnian Serb military chief , Gen . Ratko Mladic . No progress toward restarting peace talks was reported from the session conducted while the Bosnian Serb rebels carried_out their bombardment . House-to-house fighting was reported in Gorazde as Serbian infantry moved to within a_few blocks of the city ' s main square , the mayor reported in an emotional exchange with Sarajevo officials via ham radio . &quot; We have only two choices : We can be slaughtered , or we can fight and die with dignity , &quot; Briga said . &quot; The town will not fall as long as there is anybody alive in it. &quot; The courage to hold_out against the storm of Serbian artillery and tank fire appeared inspired by the expectation that NATO warplanes may soon come_to their rescue . While the prospect of Western intervention kindled hope among the anguished people of Gorazde , U.N. officials at mission headquarters feared that the peacekeeping force is about to be sucked into full-scale war without the necessary troops , equipment or mandate . &quot; We know we haven ' t got an army that works , &quot; said one U.N. officer concerned that the 15 # 000-strong contingent deployed to assist humanitarian aid operations is unsuitable for conducting the ground activities needed in conjunction with air strikes . &quot; Quite apart from the ( differing ) regiments and the nationalities , we don ' t have the equipment . The heaviest kit we ' ve got are 11 Leopard tanks up in Tuzla , &quot; the European officer said of the peacekeeping force made_up of troops from dozens of countries . &quot; We ' re not here for war . This is the problem , &quot; the exasperated officer said . &quot; There ' s an immense feeling of frustration , because we felt so close a_few weeks ago to getting somewhere , &quot; he said , referring to a NATO ultimatum that stopped the shelling of Sarajevo and to the reunion of Bosnian Croats and Muslims . &quot; Suddenly we ' re in a situation where it ' s all blown_up in our faces . It ' s like being a beaten semifinalist . It ' s awful. &quot; Another officer at the U.N. command_post here warned that stepping_up air strikes would effectively put the impartial peacekeeping force on the side of the outgunned Bosnian government forces . If new air_raids fail to force the Serbs to desist and return to negotiations , the U.N. mission would be unable to continue its operations in support of delivering humanitarian aid , he said . &quot; If things went badly wrong , we would all scuttle back to the federation and put_together a new force and a new mandate , &quot; the officer said , speaking_of a possible retreat by the U.N. mission to territory held by the reunited Bosnian Croat and government forces . Sarajevo , the current headquarters , is surrounded by Serbian forces . Foreign diplomats and relief workers , however , seem united in the view that peaceful options for resolving the Bosnian crisis have been exhausted , especially in the Gorazde enclave , where at least 535 civilians have been killed and 1 # 740 wounded in the latest offensive . The Bosnian government praised the NATO decision to halt the killing in Gorazde . Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic expressed gratitude to President Clinton , whom he credited with pushing the NATO alliance to finally confront the rebels who have conquered at least 72 % of this country since taking_up arms against its proclaimed independence in March , 1992 .</TEXT>
