   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : ROUND OF 16 ; TEAM MULLS FUTURE -- IN U.S. AND ABROAD ; SOCCER : AT LEAST FIVE RECEIVE OFFERS TO PLAY IN EUROPE . MILUTINOVIC EVASIVE ABOUT COACHING PLANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was a melancholy mood among the players and staff of the U.S. World Cup team on Tuesday as they said their goodbys , exchanged telephone_numbers and prepared to return to their homes or , in some cases , rejoin their professional clubs . Their part in the 1994 World Cup ended by Monday ' s 1-0 loss to Brazil , the U.S. players spent the day relaxing , assessing their futures and checking out of their hotel in Dana Point . Not present was Tab Ramos , who suffered a skull fracture in the game and had remained in Stanford_University Medical_Center on Monday night for observation . Doctors said the break_in the bone above his left ear would need three to six months ' healing time . Ramos returned to Mission Viejo on Tuesday afternoon and is scheduled to undergo a CAT scan today . Ramos ' injury is especially difficult for him because his professional team , Real Betis of Spain , was promoted to the first division at the end of last season and will begin training camp in a_few weeks . At least five players under contract to the U.S. Soccer Federation have been offered contracts by European professional teams -- Mike Sorber , Paul Caligiuri , Alexi Lalas , Cobi Jones and Joe-Max Moore . Moore was a member of the U.S World Cup team but did not play . Three others -- Claudio Reyna , Frank Klopas and Mike Burns -- are free_agents and available to play for any team . Reyna is expected to sign a contract within a week . The players under contract to the USSF are paid through September or October and the coaches are paid through December . U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic was asked repeatedly about his plans but was evasive . Milutinovic has lived_in Mexico for 20 years , has coached at the club and national team levels in that country and still owns a home outside Mexico_City . However , Milutinovic and his wife , Maria , have been living with their young daughter , Darinka , in Laguna Hills and he has said many times he is happy with his lifestyle . &quot; If you are no happy in California , you are crazy , &quot; Milutinovic has said . His coaching future in the United States depends_on several factors . Milutinovic ' s boss , USSF President Alan Rothenberg , is_on record as saying he is happy with Milutinovic ' s performance in the three years the Serbian has been national coach . But Rothenberg must run_for reelection next month and only after that will Milutinovic ' s role be determined . Although there has been speculation that Milutinovic might find work elsewhere , he would not say Tuesday if he had been contacted by any clubs . He did say he wasn ' t interested in coaching a club again , saying that brought_on too_much pressure . By most measures , Milutinovic and the U.S. team have been successful , having reached their avowed goal of the second round of the tournament . And Milutinovic has now coached three countries ' teams to the second round of the World Cup or beyond . The surprise in this case was how well the largely inexperienced U.S. team played in compiling a 1-2-1 record . The players said they were excited about how the World Cup had brought attention to their sport , which in the United States has been a relatively obscure one . &quot; When everybody talks_about soccer , everybody is into it , everyone watches the games , it gets a lot of attention -- this is the way it is overseas , &quot; Lalas said . &quot; It ' s a way_of_life . For an American , I ' ve never experienced that . that ' s not the way soccer is here . You go_for so_long just being an outcast , in terms of the sporting world , and then all_of a sudden , Boom ! It ' s what you always dreamed and thought it could be . It makes you feel very good . You start thinking , ' Why can ' t it be like this all_the time ? ' &quot; Others were more circumspect about the long-term impact the U.S. team ' s success will have_on the sport in this country . &quot; I really hope it lasts , &quot; John Harkes said . &quot; We set higher goals for ourselves as a team . We want to achieve more . To be_on the field against Brazil . . . no one would have thought that . we ' ll do_better next time . I ' m already excited about 1998 . I really am. &quot;</TEXT>
