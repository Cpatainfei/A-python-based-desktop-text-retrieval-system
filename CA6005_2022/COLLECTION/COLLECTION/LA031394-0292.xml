   <HEADLINE> ITALIAN ARCHEOLOGIST DIGS HIS SCUBA GEAR ; TREASURE : GOVERNMENT STRUGGLES TO SAVE RICH UNDERWATER SITES FROM PLUNDERERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Many_an underworld figure in Italy has ended_up in a watery grave , so when Luigi Robusto , an off-duty police_officer , spied a foot sticking_out of the bottom of the Adriatic , he figured he had found the latest corpse . Instead , Robusto , who dives as a hobby , made one of the most fabulous finds in the last few decades of Italian archeology -- a bearded head , two arms and a left foot believed to be parts of 4th-Century BC Greek bronze statues . Luckily for archeology , the diver was a member of the carabinieri , the paramilitary police corps that patrols Italy ' s 5 # 000 miles of seacoast . It ' s on alert for looters of ancient artifacts as well as drug smugglers and illegal immigrants . The bronzes , discovered in 1992 off the coast of Brindisi , are under restoration for display in a museum . But for countless other treasures of the deep , it ' s finders keepers . With high-tech expeditions plumbing the seas from Central_America to the South Pacific for sunken treasure -- quests_for the Titanic and Spanish galleons are some recent examples -- archeologists are racing against time to save sites from plunder . Complicating their crusade is little recognition for underwater_archeology as a discipline . &quot; Underwater archeology is still considered a side branch of archeological research , &quot; complained one expert , Werner Johannowsky , writing in Italy ' s first journal of undersea archeology , which made its debut this winter . A few years ago , a cubbyhole of sorts was carved out by the Culture Ministry for an office for underwater_archeology . Claudio Mocchegiani Carpano , an archeologist and diver who runs it , relies heavily on volunteers , the coast guard and carabinieri to protect and retrieve ancient treasures , most of which are found by chance . that ' s not all that much different from how things were in 1972 , when a scuba_diver off the coast of Calabria fished out Italy ' s most celebrated undersea find , the stunningly handsome Riace Bronzes , a pair of life-size warriors , nearly half a ton apiece and possibly the work of the 5th-Century BC master Greek sculptor Phidias . &quot; In those days , we worked underwater on our own free_time , &quot; recalled Mocchegiani Carpano in his office near the Tiber , whose polluted waters he regularly searches for ancient Roman ships and cargo . To get an idea of what straits underwater archeologists work in , imagine leaving the job of unearthing the equivalent of a Hadrian ' s Villa , the popular tourist site on the outskirts of Rome , in the hands of amateurs . that ' s how the &quot; excavation &quot; off Capri of a sumptuous villa of 1st-Century Emperor Tiberius is being carried_out . Volunteers from Archeoclub , a nationwide group of archeology lovers , work every summer to reveal a little more of the baths , swimming_pools and fish ponds that delighted the emperor and his entourage . Because the island off Naples is in an earthquake-prone area , the villa slowly sunk below sea_level over the centuries . &quot; Capri was never ( systematically ) studied underwater , &quot; said the leader of the project , Orlando Pandolfi , an engineer and Archeoclub official . &quot; Before we came , there were looters and , only very sporadically , professional archeologists. &quot; When archeologists have to leave an underwater site , they sometimes cover it with cement or a metal grid . Pandolfi hopes someday at Capri there will be glass-bottom boats for tourists and marked trails for divers . &quot; Italy has probably the most interesting seas in the world because for centuries all_the trade_routes passed_by , &quot; said Pandolfi . &quot; There are thousands of shipwrecks and lots of submerged cities. &quot; Work underwater -- by volunteers or by the state -- moves slowly because of the cost . It ' s just like working_on terra_firma , &quot; only you don ' t excavate with a pick ax and it costs 10 times as much , &quot; Mocchegiani Carpano said . With a minuscule budget , his dream of having staff archeologists , photographers and sketchers who know how to dive isn ' t about to come true soon . Digging_out sunken wrecks has helped tell more about commerce , construction techniques and even what were the latest fads in household decorating -- many Roman wrecks were filled with Greek antiquities to fill that empty niche or two in the atrium in some patrician house .</TEXT>
