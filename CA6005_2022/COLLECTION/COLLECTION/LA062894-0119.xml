   <HEADLINE> SAN ONOFRE PLAN GENERATES HEATED DEBATE ; UTILITIES : PROPOSAL TO CLOSE PLANT 15 YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE IS EXPECTED TO DRAW OPPOSITION FROM SCE , LABOR_UNION AT HEARING TONIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State officials seeking the early closure of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station will present their case at a public hearing here tonight , with fierce opposition expected from the utility company that owns the plant and the labor_union representing its 2 # 500 workers . Many of those employees who want to protect their jobs live_in South County or northern San Diego County . Union officials argue that the plant represents an economic benefit of more_than $ 250 million a year to surrounding communities . For weeks , the Utility Workers Union of America has lobbied city_councils , claiming that closing the plant by 1998 -- 15 years ahead of schedule -- would be another crippling blow to an area already ravaged by recession . And last week , in a show of support for the union and Southern California Edison , which owns the plant , the San Clemente City_Council voted to support keeping San Onofre open . Tonight ' s meeting will begin at 7 in the San Clemente City_Council chambers . Another public hearing is set for 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Fullerton High_School . Both hearings will be conducted by an administrative_law judge , with a final_decision by the state Public_Utilities Commission expected by the end of the year . Opened in 1967 , the San Onofre plant now supplies 12 % of the power used by customers of Southern California Edison , which serves residents throughout the Southland . Southern California Edison owns about 75 % of the plant , which features two huge domes visible along the coast south of San Clemente . San Diego Gas &amp; Electric owns 20 % , with utilities in Anaheim and Riverside owning less than 5 % . Opponents say the cost of operating the plant is far too high and could easily be reduced by turning_to alternative_energy sources , including solar_power , natural_gas and even agricultural waste . &quot; We could save the ratepayers more_than $ 1 billion over the remaining life of the plant , &quot; which is scheduled to close_in the year 2013 , said Robert Kinosian , spokesman for the Division of Ratepayer Advocates , a department of the PUC . DRA attorney Irene Moosen said the division reports to the PUC commissioner but acts solely on behalf of ratepayers at hearings where utility rates are determined . Kinosian ' s group encountered stiff opposition when the future of San Onofre was last discussed , in 1992 . The outcome of that round of hearings was the closure of Unit 1 , the oldest of the plant ' s three operating reactors . &quot; By forcing the closure of Unit 1 , we saved ratepayers $ 130 million a year , &quot; Kinosian said . * But Southern California Edison officials argue that merely converting to other forms of energy , such_as gas-powered facilities , would cost far more_than would be saved by shutting_down San Onofre 15 years early . Union officials point to the economic damage from the loss of jobs . &quot; A lot of the jobs involved , such_as health physics technician or nuclear control operator , would not be transferable to other industries , &quot; said Carl Wood , business_agent for Local 246 of the Utility Workers Union of America . &quot; Our annual payroll of $ 120 million would be gone , wiped_out , eliminated , &quot; Wood said . &quot; You ' d have have a half-a-billion-dollar loss in business_activity in Orange and San Diego counties alone. &quot; Kinosian counters by saying that millions of dollars in savings would more_than offset the loss of jobs at San Onofre or the money its workers would spend in surrounding communities . &quot; Sure , it would take_away from employees at the power_plant , &quot; he said , &quot; but the enormous savings would go_to ratepayers , and every_other business in the region would be dramatically better_off because of lower electric bills. &quot; Units 2 and 3 at San Onofre cost as much as $ 600 million a year to operate , Kinosian said , whereas alternative forms of energy , such_as gas-powered plants , some of which were mothballed years ago , would account_for the savings he envisions . Joe Wambold , manager of business and finance for Edison ' s nuclear department , said the company plans to show during public hearings that Kinosian ' s group is &quot; way off base &quot; in making such claims . In converting to new or different forms of energy , Wambold said , the capital outlay attached_to start-up costs &quot; manages to defeat Kinosian ' s argument single-handedly. &quot; The Alliance for Survival , an environmental group based in Santa Ana , plans to speak in support of closing the plant early , citing high costs and the ongoing risk of a nuclear accident , such_as those at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979 and at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet_Union in 1986 . But officials for Southern California Edison say the conversion to other forms of energy , such_as natural_gas , would contribute to air_pollution . Nuclear power , they argue , is free_of air_pollution .</TEXT>
