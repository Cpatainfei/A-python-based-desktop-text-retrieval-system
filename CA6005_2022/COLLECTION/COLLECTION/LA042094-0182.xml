   <HEADLINE> DEL MAR AVIONICS TAKES NEW DIRECTION ; TECHNOLOGY : THE COMPANY , ROOTED IN MILITARY CONTRACTING , TURNS TO MANUFACTURING COMPACT_DISKS AS DEFENSE INDUSTRY SLUMPS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bruce Del Mar has experienced a lifetime of change . An aviation pioneer -- he co-invented the pressurized airplane cabin -- this Orange County inventor is credited with dozens of technological innovations . And at 81 , Del Mar said , he is ready to undergo another conversion . The defense and medical equipment company that bears his name , Del Mar Avionics , is again shifting focus away from its military-contracting roots -- this time to profit from the fast-moving compact_disk manufacturing industry . It ' s like turning swords into plowshares with a vengeance . &quot; When you ' re like a polar_bear on a floating iceberg and it ' s melting , you jump to another iceberg , &quot; said Del Mar . &quot; We move our technology to where the market is. &quot; Del Mar Avionics was_on its way toward becoming yet another victim of the defense downturn . But its chairman and founder decided to join the revolution of multimedia -- the use of text , video , sound and graphics to create dazzling animation and movie-like effects on personal_computers . By modifying the technology it uses for the medical monitors it makes , the company has devised a cheaper way to create compact_disk masters , which are used as templates to mass-produce thousands of copies of compact_disks for audio and computer software . With a name to rival that of any weapons program , Del Mar Avionics ' Fire Trac master system is the company ' s latest shot at diversification . It uses a laser , or &quot; fire , &quot; to burn soundtracks onto CDs . And there is a market for Fire Trac -- nearly 100 million software CDs were manufactured in 1993 , based on estimates by the Optical Publishing Assn. , a trade group based in Columbus , Ohio . Del Mar Avionics invested $ 1.5 million last year in its 30-person optical division and expects a sales boost in 1994 . Since January , the company has sold five Fire Trac systems , which generate about $ 500 # 000 from each customer . This is about a quarter of the $ 2 million that record companies spend for conventional mastering equipment . The fight for success isn ' t necessarily over , though . Defense companies often fail when seeking commercial applications for their products . The usual culprit , says Santa Ana defense conversion consultant M.L. ( Bud ) Warrick , is failure to master the skills of marketing to a variety of customers rather than just one -- the government . &quot; A lot of guys think they know what they ' re doing , &quot; Warrick said . &quot; Sometimes they have luck if they go_into a specialized market where there is a limited number of customers and distribution isn ' t as difficult. &quot; &quot; It ' s an adjustment to move_into the entertainment world , &quot; Del Mar admits . &quot; We went_to one trade show dressed in suits and a lot of people there were showing a lot of bare skin. &quot; Things were a lot different when Del Mar began working in 1937 for Douglas Aircraft Co. , where he and other Douglas scientists designed the pressurized cabin . Using money he got from royalties on his inventions , he started his own company , Del Mar Engineering Laboratories , in 1952 , making training systems for aircraft weapons . In 1975 , the company -- by then renamed Del Mar Avionics -- moved to a 10-acre site in Orange County that was surrounded by orchards and places where Del Mar could go duck hunting . These days , the location is part of Irvine ' s industrial district . A walk through Del Mar Avionics ' lobby , which includes a museum of products from the company ' s past , reveals Del Mar ' s history of iceberg-hopping . In one area are weapons-training systems that look_like big bombs , and a bright orange , helicopter-size freight carrier that was never delivered . Sensing a chance to expand into the medical business , the company more_than 30 years ago started making magnetic_tape recorders that monitor the vital signs of hospital patients . In the 1960s those monitors were housed in 50-pound boxes . Today the same functions are performed by a hand-held device . A stair-climbing exercise machine that was supposed to ride aboard the space shuttle is now gathering dust . The machine broke_down before its scheduled trip . Del Mar Avionics peaked in the early years of the Reagan_Administration ' s military buildup . It employed 600 people and had revenue of $ 35 million in 1982 . The numbers were down to about 200 employees and revenue of $ 20 million last year . Military contracts were a declining part of Del Mar ' s sales in the last decade . The company lost a contract for making weapons-range instruments , which tell pilots whether they hit dummy targets . It shed some workers and shifted other workers to new divisions . About six years ago , the company decided to invest in optical storage , a system that uses lasers to record information on spinning disks similar to but larger than the CDs used in the home . Optical methods could store more information than magnetic_tape and so were a natural choice for the hospital monitors . Using optical technology combines research in chemistry , physics , optics , electronics , software and high-tech manufacturing . That doesn ' t come cheap , said David Johnson , vice_president and general_manager of the company ' s laser optics division . Over the last 10 years , the company has invested more_than $ 30 million in research and development . Its Fire Trac system uses a laser to embed data -- which later becomes music , moving picture or text -- on a light-sensitive disk in patterns that can be interpreted as the 1s and 0s of computerese . Once recorded , the disk is encased in metal and processed to function as a &quot; stamper , &quot; or mold for disk replication . The patented Del Mar system helps smaller publishers and manufacturers of CDs stay competitive with and less dependent_on a limited number of mastering companies , such_as Sony Corp . Barry Taylor , a manager at Better Quality Cassettes Inc. in Council Bluffs , Iowa , said Fire Trac allowed his company to cut its costs of producing master CDs by 20 % . Warrick , the defense consultant , said Del Mar will have to be ready to deal with a competitive backlash -- including price_cuts by Sony and other players in the mastering market -- as part of the daily routine of commercial sales . &quot; They can ' t just be a one-trick pony and come_up with only one product , &quot; he said . With new sales from Fire Trac and some luck , Del Mar Avionics expects 1994 sales to hit $ 30 million and employment to grow to 240 people . &quot; We ' re envisioning this as our major growth for the year , &quot; Johnson said .</TEXT>
