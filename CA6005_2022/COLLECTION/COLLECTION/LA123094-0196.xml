   <HEADLINE> BOYS ' BASKETBALL / HART TOURNAMENT ; SIMI VALLEY EDGES NOTRE DAME IN OVERTIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Simi Valley High ' s boys ' basketball_team has found a rather irksome way of beating opponents . It starts slowly , lies_in_wait , then strikes with venom at the end . The Pioneers did_it again , beating Notre Dame in overtime , 60-56 , Thursday night in the semifinals of the Hart tournament at Valencia High . Simi Valley ( 10-1 ) trailed by nine points with 6 minutes 31 seconds left but closed it out with a 24-9 run . Senior guard Anthony Tauriello led the latest ambush with 11 points -- all_in the second_half -- and nine assists . &quot; This is about the third time we ' ve had to come_back , &quot; said Tauriello , who , like his team , started slowly . &quot; I was struggling . But I knew in the second_half it was important for us to get_into a rhythm. &quot; The Knights ( 8-4 ) were seemingly in control , leading , 45-36 , at the 6:31 mark of the fourth quarter . Then they hit the skids with four turnovers . After two scoreless minutes , Simi Valley sliced the lead to 45-41 . After an exchange of baskets , Tauriello made a pull-up jumper to give the Knights a 47-45 lead . Then Tauriello made a layup to tie the score after center Dan Van Etten stole a pass . With 1:27 left , Van Etten ' s first field_goal , a three-foot jumper , gave Simi Valley the lead , 49-47 . Canyon 54 , Hart 52 -- The Cowboys ( 7-4 ) earned their first berth in the championship game in the 23-year-old tournament when Ruben Castaneda made two free_throws for his only points with six seconds left . Canyon ' s Greg Minor scored 18 of his 25 points in the first_half . * MORE REGIONAL HIGH_SCHOOL BASKETBALL : C14</TEXT>
