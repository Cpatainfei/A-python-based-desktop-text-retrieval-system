   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : WEST HILLS ; A HUMBLE WIN IN MARTIAL ARTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even with their many victories at the Taekwondo U.S. Junior Olympic Championships in Chicago , David Howell , head instructor at Twin Dragon Martial Arts in West Hills , was just as proud at the humility they showed in winning . &quot; We teach our kids to be gracious winners as well as gracious losers , &quot; said Howell . But with the way they won , Howell ' s kids needed a lot of humility . The club came_home from the championship a week ago with 13 gold medals , seven silver and four bronze . Two of the students were double_gold medal_winners , and all but three of the students in the national competition came_home with a medal . They did better than any other school at the championships , Howell said . Kwon Sung Choi , president of the California Taekwondo Assn. , is master of the Palos Verdes Taekwondo club , where his students won just as_many gold and silver medals , and two fewer bronze . Only by combining that medal count with his students from his other club in Torrance had they done better in a medal count , said Choi , whose students also included a national black_belt champion . The sweetest taste of victory for the Twin Dragon students came when they were allowed to dig_into soda , ice_cream , and candy -- all_of which had been banned for the past five months under a strict training regimen . Such artificial treats give an unnatural rush of energy during a workout and eliminating sweets gave the kids a better chance at building endurance , Howell said . &quot; I missed Snickers , &quot; said Lauren Radel , 11 , a Twin Dragon silver medal_winner , who headed for the candy machine as soon as the competition was over . &quot; I had to have my Snickers bar. &quot; Heather Larsen , 10 , who won two gold medals in the competition , did not miss the soda because she likes drinking juices anyway . &quot; I celebrated with a big , king-sized Hershey ' s bar right after I won , &quot; she said . &quot; It felt pretty good , &quot; Larsen said of her win . &quot; Actually , it was really tough. &quot; Pushed for further superlatives , Larsen described her first national win as &quot; fun . . . good . . . cool. &quot; Although she and Radel said they were just trying to do their best and not worry about winning or losing . Larsen said she wants to compete in the Olympics someday . &quot; They were humble in their reactions to people , &quot; Howell said . &quot; But inside you could tell they were very proud . You could see the impact it had_on these kids. &quot; Tae kwon do , a form of martial_arts started in Korea 2 # 500 years ago , has been in the Junior Olympics for 14 years and recently became an Olympic sport . In the Junior Olympics , kids age 7 to 16 compete within their age , weight and experience categories . The Twin Dragon students were among 450 competitors from California , which , as a state , had the largest_number of gold medal_winners at the championships , Junior Olympic officials said .
