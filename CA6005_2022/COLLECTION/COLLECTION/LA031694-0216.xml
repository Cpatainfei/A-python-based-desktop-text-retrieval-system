   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; ATTEMPT TO OVERTURN PROSTITUTION LAWS DENIED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Los Angeles Superior_Court judge Tuesday denied a motion by a Santa Clarita couple to overturn state prostitution laws that they say prohibit members of their church from practicing rituals that include having_sex . Mary Ellen Tracy , head of the Church of the Most High Goddess , sued Los Angeles Dist . Atty.Gil Garcetti last September in an effort to legalize meetings at her church by getting the laws overturned . A favorable ruling would have allowed Tracy to seek a court injunction barring Garcetti ' s office from enforcing the state laws in her case . Tracy had asked the court to declare the state laws unconstitutional as a result of the recent enactment of federal laws that bar the government from intruding_on religions without a compelling reason , said Senior Deputy County Counsel Marion Douglas , who is representing Garcetti . Los Angeles Superior_Court Judge Madeleine Flier denied Tracy ' s request , noting that many of the issues raised by Tracy in her lawsuit had been heard during her earlier criminal trial , Douglas said . Tracy , also known as Sabrina Aset , and her husband Will Tracy , were convicted in 1989 of pimping , pandering , prostitution and keeping a house of ill_fame for activities related to their church . A judge sentenced Mary Ellen Tracy to a year in jail and Will Tracy to six months . The couple claimed to absolve the sins of male followers through sexual religious_rites . Mary Ellen Tracy said that she had_sex with more_than 2 # 000 men , many of whom also gave monetary &quot; sacrifices &quot; to the church . The Tracys said they will ask the state court of appeals_to stop Flier from signing an order finalizing her ruling . &quot; If we teach our religion to a woman we ' re subject_to a three-year mandatory prison sentence , &quot; Will Tracy said . &quot; We ' re totally prohibited. &quot;</TEXT>
