   <TEXT> Canada and Russia have traditions to uphold , but Finland and Sweden have reputations they would like to shake today in the semifinals of the Olympic hockey tournament . Canada ( 4-1-1 ) gave hockey to the world and has never given_up its claim to supremacy.That claim will be tested by Finland , at 6-0 the tournament ' s only unbeaten team but still considered a question_mark because of its history of Olympic failures . Russia , successor of the Soviet and Unified teams that won eight of 10 Olympic gold medals from 1956-92 , had a mediocre start that included losses to Finland and Germany in the preliminary round . But when it mattered , Russia found a way to win . Alexander Vinogradov ' s overtime goal against Slovakia propelled the Russians ( 4-2 ) into the semifinals . Tonight they play Sweden ( 4-1-1 ) , three-time world champion , but never an Olympic gold medalist . HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
