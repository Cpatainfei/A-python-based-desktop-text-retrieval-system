   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; RICHARD RILEY ; REBUILDING THE NATION ' S PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the mid-1950s , while in the Navy , Richard W . Riley developed a degenerative bone disease that caused intense , chronic pain for many years and eventually curved his spine . Determined not to become dependent_on pain relievers , he chose to endure the pain . Throughout his career as a lawyer , politician and education reformer , he has exhibited the same fortitude and tenacity that he has displayed in dealing with the disease , which now prevents him from turning his head or standing_up straight . In the 1960s , as a state legislator in South Carolina , Riley fought an uphill battle for school desegregation . While many white parents put their children in private_schools to avoid integration , Riley continued to send his children to public_schools . Largely through his children ' s education , Riley learned how miserably the schools were failing South Carolina ' s children . Riley was an underdog when he launched his second attempt for the governorship , but he came_out on top after a campaign that stressed overhauling the schools -- which , at the time , spent less per pupil than all but one other state . His reforms , paid_for by a special sales tax , are credited with helping South Carolina ' s students make the nation ' s biggest leap in SAT scores , increasing employment opportunities for graduates from vocational_education and encouraging far more high-school graduates to go_on to college . Now , as secretary_of_education , Riley , 61 , is trying to do the same thing for the nation ' s schools . The linchpin of his strategy is legislation to create national scholastic and skills standards , called Goals 2000 . Riley has shunned the bully pulpit -- where his predecessors waged their wars . Instead , he has used his persuasive powers in closed-door sessions with key members of Congress . In these moments , the secretary ' s dogged determination combines effectively with his genteel Southern courtliness . President Bill_Clinton and Riley are friends and were fellow warriors in the battle for better schools as governors , but the President has pretty much left him alone to fight for national education reform . This has made Riley ' s job of pushing the Administration ' s initiatives through Congress particularly difficult . Riley and his wife , Ann , known as &quot; Tunky , &quot; have four children . Riley has passed his passion for public education on to his children -- his daughter , Anne , chose teaching public_school as her profession . Question : What is the state of education ? Answer : It ' s mixed and fragmented . In any school district , you find grand examples of schools that are working , and classes that are working , and kids engaged in education and parents involved . And , in the same region , you find some where that ' s not the case -- some where it ' s mediocre , and some where it ' s poor . Q : You talk , in particular , about how public_schools fail poor children . Why is that so and what should the government do to change that ? A : Research shows that poor children have a more difficult time achieving in school -- that ' s a fact . It shows further that poor children in a poor school have a double difficulty in achieving . By the same token , poor children in a more wealthy school , surrounded by kids who are well-educated , and motivated in an educational way , do_better . that ' s part of what the elementary and secondary act is about -- Chapter 1 , which we call Title 1 -- and that ' s why we ' re paying special attention to that . That is , money -- $ 9 billion over the major act , and Chapter 1 is $ 6 or $ 7 billion . We are trying to target more of those enrichment funds in Chapter 1 to the poorest schools . . . . The high standards we are talking_about are for all kids -- no more watered-down Chapter 1 curriculum , no more watered-down Chapter 1 assessment . Every kid will be expected to learn under Goals 2000 . Every kid will then be given the responsibility to study and prepare . It will take several years for that to sink into the system , but that is going_to be an enormous change for this country . When you go_into kindergarten , every single child is expected to learn . You aren ' t out hunting for kids to pull_out and put into slow groups , but you are expecting all kids to learn . Q : Teachers often say they now have to play more of a parenting role , because children do not come_to the classroom with the same preparation they had in previous generations . What is the role of parents and communities in education reform ? A : When I talk to teachers , it has been my observation that they don ' t talk to me about their pay or their long hours or the difficulty of their jobs . They talk to me about the fact that they can ' t get parents to help them with the education of their children . That is a real problem in American education . . . . Goals 2000 is the answer to that . It is a way that each school can develop their own systemic reform -- which means parents are involved in it . Each person can begin by working with their own children every night -- and take a special_interest in what is happening in their school and what their teacher is telling them and develop respect for teachers and schools and learning . Every parent can do that . For people who are not parents , there are so many needs for mentors and tutors in the neighborhoods and the schools . I think it is tied to this whole idea of building community spirit back into this country -- something we ' ve kind of lost . It used to keep the country great , because we had this community spirit . The school should be the center of the community spirit ; and people involved in helping the young people grow and become leaders in the community . that ' s why I tell parents not just to get involved , but to spend time with their own children and spend time supporting the school . Do not get frustrated and stay away , but go_into the school and participate . Q : It seems schools have to deal with more serious issues now than they did_in the past -- life-and-death issues , like violence and AIDS . A : What I say to people is identify your needs , find_out what your special problems are . If it is teen-age pregnancy , then you have a need to deal with it . Sit down with good people in your community and state and decide how you think is the best way to deal with it . Don ' t not deal with it . It ' s not my place to tell you how to deal with it . If it ' s a problem that affects children and their learning , then deal with the problem the way you think is best . I think it ' s important for me , as a national_leader , to say : Don ' t turn your back on these problems . Q : How can the federal_government help states and localities educate immigrant children -- legal and illegal ? A : The law of this country is that all children are entitled to have an education , that ' s universal . That means we do not go_into whether their parents have a green_card or whatever other kind of card . If there are children who live_in a region , under this country ' s laws , they are entitled to an education . That works a special hardship on the education systems in many areas -- the L.A. region is a good_example of that . When I was in L.A. , I visited several schools where 40 or 50 languages were spoken . I recognize all that . We have bilingual programs and other ways to recognize certain support . Chapter 1 is a key way that helps especially disadvantaged kids who would come here as immigrants . The recognition of foreign language being a competency -- that every child should be educated in two languages -- is another way we can help . It ' s good for kids who grew_up speaking English as a first_language to learn Spanish or French or German or whatever ; and it ' s good for a kid who has Spanish to learn English . Q : Why has the Administration focused education on apprenticeships for high-school students who do not intend to go_on to college ? A : If you stood_back and looked_at the American education system , I think you would have to say that those young people who are not studying for a four-year college program have been somewhat neglected . Our systems have been devised to provide a good education for those going_on to a four-year education and to help the others get_by . It has caused a disconnection of young people from the learning process and from our economy and society in_general . In the high_schools you see that problem begin to show_up in graphic ways -- in violence issues , drug issues , truancy and drop-outs ; 82 % of those in prisons are high-school dropouts . A lot of that can be prevented if , from the very early years , we drive the education system with high standards for all students and make their academic standards important to them and have them connect that with success and jobs and a place in the community . Q : Why do you support public-school choice but not public vouchers for private_schools ? A : I don ' t see any way that you can say a voucher -- paid with tax dollars to pull students and active parents out of the system -- can help the schools . . . . One is designed -- public-school choice -- to improve public_schools for the children , and the other is designed for what would amount to destroying the public_schools for the purpose of getting them so bad that you have to start over . I don ' t think that makes_good sense , and it would be very damaging to schools and to children . Q : Has the role of public education changed in America ? A : It has changed dramatically . I was asked the other day , what is the problem with public education -- in a philosophical way . My answer was that the needs and requirements in education itself have changed in the world and we are having to change the education system , the schools and the process to make the changes that are already out there . We are in a world-competitive economy . We are in a global society . It used to be , in terms of literacy , if you could sign your name , you were perceived to be literate . Now that ' s not enough . The person who can ' t read and write well is not going_to get a meaningful job in this country today . You could do that in the agricultural era and under the industrial era . There was a place for manual_labor and domestic labor . But that is relatively nonexistent today . Things have dramatically changed and we have to do more in those school_years in terms of education . . . . In this era , all kids are going_to have to be productive ; and to be productive , they ' re going to have to be well-educated . Demographics also make_it more important -- because we have more older people , more people going_into retirement , percentage-wise . So , it is more important for all kids to learn and be well-educated . We have never in this country needed young people who can do things , and who know things , like we do now . So it becomes more important to take kids with a learning disability or with a disability and say , &quot; We expect more of you . We are going_to give you more opportunities to learn but we are expecting you to learn and produce and participate in our great economy. &quot; We can ' t spare anyone . I don ' t care if they ' re an immigrant who has just come here and can ' t speak the language , or a kid who has a learning disability or a brilliant person who is hanging_out and is not interested in studying . All kids are going_to have to get_into this world of knowledge and education and become part of it . And that is going_to happen . Goals 2000 is the first_step for it to happen , and it is going_to energize all states and all schools . Then you ' re going to see a patriotism develop -- if you want to serve this country ' s future , the way to do_it is to become well-educated . Q : Are charter schools and contracts with private companies to run public_schools good options for preparing young people for the demands of the next century ? A : The trend in several places of contracting for management services or operating schools is an option , but it should be accompanied with a criteria , and that criteria is hard to reach . And that criteria are more resources in the classroom instead of fewer . If you can contract with the private sector and have more resources in the classroom , and have high academic standards prevail , and be the driving force and have flexibility and accountability -- then it makes_sense in some cases . But that ' s going_to be awfully hard to come_by if you start talking_about a large profit being taken . . . . You must be careful with all these options . You are dealing with_children ' s lives and the future of the country . There is no easy magic_bullet . The magic_bullet is teaching and learning .</TEXT>
