   <TEXT> In a policy speech , and in unusual messages to Asian leaders , Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday renewed &quot; the recognition that Japan ' s past actions , including acts of aggression and colonialism , caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people. &quot; Hata made the declaration in the aftermath of statements by his ousted justice minister , Shigeto Nagano , who denied past Japanese aggression and described a major atrocity Japanese soldiers committed in 1937 in China as a &quot; fabrication. &quot; In both the speech -- his first to Parliament since he was elected prime_minister April 25 -- and the special messages , Hata promised to convey to future generations of Japanese the recognition of the nation ' s past misdeeds . &quot; Based on its deep remorse , Japan will do its utmost to create peace and a bright future for the Asia-Pacific region , &quot; he added , declaring that his statement would constitute the &quot; political creed of the new Cabinet. &quot; &quot; The pain and anger of peoples of neighboring countries caused by the recent remarks of a Cabinet_minister shows . . . that Japan ' s past actions have left great scars which remain even today , &quot; he said . Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said Hata dispatched a special letter to Chinese Premier Li Peng , telephoned South_Korean President Kim Young Sam and had Japanese diplomatic_missions deliver messages to other Asian leaders . Apparently for foreign consumption , official translators subtly strengthened Hata ' s main remark . Where the_English translation had Hata condemning &quot; aggression and colonialism &quot; in his speech , in Japanese he said &quot; acts of aggression and colonialism. &quot; That phrasing stops short of describing Japan ' s entire war as aggression -- as ex-Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa characterized it in an August news_conference . Referring to a Socialist walkout from his coalition , which left his government without a majority in either house of Parliament , Hata said he wanted to add &quot; cooperation &quot; to &quot; reform &quot; as a second pillar of his minority government . He also took_note of predictions that his administration may soon face a test at the polls . A bill to establish the boundaries of 300 new single-seat districts for the lower house will be submitted as soon as possible &quot; so that the next general_election can be held under the new system , &quot; he said . Without the establishment of new districts , any election that Hata might be forced to call by a vote of no confidence would be carried_out under the old system , in which voters choose an average of four representatives from each district . On economic issues , Hata added a tone of concern that Hosokawa had not shown before resigning over suspicions involving his personal finances . &quot; The Japanese economy has experienced sufferings previously unknown and has gone even to_the_point of shaking our confidence about future prospects , &quot; Hata said . He also called a prolonged delay in enacting the 1994 budget &quot; alarming &quot; and promised to tackle &quot; serious economic issues ( that ) remain unresolved between Japan and the United States. &quot; While insisting that Japan ' s large surpluses were built_upon &quot; the untiring efforts of the people within the rules of international free_trade , &quot; Hata acknowledged that Japan ' s continuing black ink &quot; cannot but invite the criticism of its trading partners. &quot; &quot; We must change our way of thinking . . . to achieve a phased reduction of the current_account surplus ( and ) to change Japan ' s economic structure so that it is internationally harmonious , &quot; he said . Hata said Japan &quot; tended to be an onlooker to developments of the international community &quot; during the Cold_War . Now , he said , &quot; Japan needs to move to center stage , play an active role for world peace and prosperity and earn the trust of the international community. &quot;</TEXT>
