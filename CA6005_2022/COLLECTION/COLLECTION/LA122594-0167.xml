   <HEADLINE> RIPPLE EFFECT FROM ' 93 OIL SPILL SWIRLS ON ; OXNARD : A YEAR LATER , CLEANUP OF 84 # 000 GALLONS OF BUSH CO . CRUDE IS INCOMPLETE , OFFICIALS SAY , AND LEGAL ISSUES ARE UNRESOLVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No one at Bush Oil Co . noticed the sharp drop_in oil_pressure last December as a ruptured pipeline unleashed black crude into a man-made lake and surrounding wetlands near Oxnard . Crude_oil continued to flow into McGrath Lake for four days until a slick spread hundreds of yards into the Pacific_Ocean and was spotted by federal inspectors flying in a helicopter to an offshore oil platform on Christmas morning . By the time the pipe was shut_down , the line buried beneath Harbor Boulevard had released 84 # 000 gallons of oil to become one of Ventura County ' s worst oil spills . It took months and $ 10 million to mop_up the oil that soiled miles of beaches and inundated the sensitive habitat . Workers clear-cut acres of sensitive coastal vegetation . Swarms of volunteers scrubbed hundreds of oil-coated birds and other wildlife , but only saved a fraction of the dying ducks , coots and other waterfowl . An endangered pelican and snowy plover were among the casualties . One year later , most of the oil , contaminated dirt and sand has been scooped_up and carted_away . Yet investigators still find oily residue buried in the sediment as they assess the wetland ' s recovery . &quot; We ' ve noticed residual petroleum in areas gathered_in the creek , &quot; said Robert Ricker , a California Department of Fish and Game toxicologist . &quot; So we ' re continuing to monitor to get an accurate picture of where it is and how long it will persist. &quot; Bush Oil executives have not admitted responsibility , though they pleaded no contest in August to criminal charges stemming from the spill and paid $ 600 # 000 in fines . The foreman on_duty also pleaded no contest to water_pollution and was sentenced to 18 months probation and 320 hours of beach cleanup . State and federal prosecutors are now preparing a civil case against the company , which could lead to millions of dollars more in fines to pay_for wetlands restoration . For their part , company officials said public agencies should share any blame for the spill because they ignored early reports of the leak . Nonetheless , officials at Bush Oil and its parent company , Berry Petroleum , said they have done the best cleanup possible and have taken steps to prevent future leaks . &quot; We ' ve done quite a bit of investment to make_sure that nothing remotely similar to this ever happens again , &quot; said Ralph Goehring , chief financial_officer of Berry Petroleum . It all started four days before last Christmas , when a corroded 8-inch transfer pipe pumping 1 # 200 barrels a day beneath Harbor Boulevard ruptured from high_pressure and old_age . Bush Oil officials insisted at a hastily called news_conference Christmas night that only 10 barrels of oil had spilled , an estimate they raised to 250 barrels within 24 hours . But the next day a clearer estimation of the leakage emerged : this time an eightfold increase to 2 # 000 barrels , some 84 # 000 gallons of unprocessed crude . Further spreading the mess , an unidentified farmer activated a pump at the lake sometime before Christmas , pushing thousands of gallons of contaminated water out_to sea . &quot; My first impression was that we had a mess and I wasn ' t going_home for Christmas dinner , &quot; said Mark Caywood , a state_Department of Fish and Game lieutenant who was one of the first officials to arrive_at the lake that Christmas morning . * By midday , dozens of cleanup workers and government_agents had converged on the scene , where thick globs of oil clumped along the lake ' s edges and the wetland surface was capped with six inches of heavy black tar . Hundreds of migratory birds and other wildlife coated with oil began clawing their way to the shores , lodging themselves in thick reeds and marshland in desperate attempts to free themselves from the toxic substance . By nightfall , more_than 50 workers had been summoned to mount cleanup operations on three fronts : the freshwater lake , miles of beaches and the offshore slick . The next day , a Sunday , hundreds more cleanup workers joined wildlife rescue personnel to pitch_in . Beach crews fanned_out over miles of coastline , raking miles of sand for golf ball-sized tar bits while offshore workers encircled and cleaned_up what oil they could . Huge vacuums sucked_up clumps of oil as they were loosened from the lake shore by wind generated by the beating blades of a hovering helicopter . Volunteers washed thick blankets of oil from mud_hens , ducks and other waterfowl . &quot; The product was like liquid asphalt -- very , very thick -- and the animals were literally stuck_to themselves , &quot; said Mimi Wood-Harris of the Berkeley-based International Bird Rescue and Research_Center . &quot; In terms of the consistency of the product , it was the worst I had ever worked with , &quot; she said . &quot; And I ' ve been doing this for six years. &quot; The easiest of the three cleanup efforts was offshore , where roughly 75 barrels , more_than 3 # 000 gallons , is estimated to have spread into the Santa Barbara Channel . The ocean cleanup was completed by 9 a.m. Monday , barely 48 hours after the slick was first spotted . &quot; We did what we practice 100 times a year : containment and recovery operations , &quot; said Darryle Waldron , manager of the Carpinteria-based Clean Seas , a commercial recovery company called_in early Christmas morning . &quot; The offshore size was relatively small , probably 60 to 80 barrels , &quot; Waldron said , &quot; about the size of one tanker truck that overturns in Los Angeles every day. &quot; Most of the oil had gathered on shore , choking the slough leading from the pipeline leak across Harbor Boulevard to McGrath Lake , and badly soiling another drainage canal leading from the wetland to the ocean . Outboard skiffs floated booms across the lake , dragging the oil toward a cleanup station , where men in protective white jumpsuits pumped the product into waiting 5 # 000-gallon tanker trucks . At the drainage slough between the lake and beachfront , crews battled thousands of gallons of sticky black crude that had congealed in the stream bed like a thick stew . In the dense vegetation between the lake and Harbor Boulevard , other crews carved out a work area from the trees and brush , where subcontractors hauled_off tons of oil-stained soil and shrubbery . Light_breezes , meanwhile , carried the stench of raw oil across the 160-acre cleanup site and beyond . &quot; Marshland hasn ' t got the potential for recovering fast , and beyond that , it ' s hard to get all_the oil out , &quot; said state_Department of Fish and Game biologist John Grant , who supervised cleanup of the grove between Harbor Boulevard and the lake . &quot; The oil gets ground in , then it makes problems that it ' s slow to recover from , &quot; said Grant , who spent weeks digging_out and then rebuilding the entire stream . By midmorning Sunday , a team of professional and volunteer wildlife rescue personnel had set_up camp in a flat area northwest of McGrath Lake under the direction of Wood-Harris of International Bird Rescue . The death toll among waterfowl and other species rose by the hour as relief workers combed the lake shore in search of stranded animals . Gloved rescuers used cotton swabs to clean the birds ' oil-soaked eyes and a saline_solution to wash their bodies . &quot; I had never seen so_much confusion in my life , &quot; said Estelle Busch , who runs the Wildlife Care Network , a Santa Barbara nonprofit group that volunteered its resources to help save the soiled animals . &quot; When you have an oil spill , the chain of command is very confusing , &quot; said Busch , citing the litany of local , state and federal agencies that answered the emergency call . &quot; You have to go_through all this stuff before you can even touch a bird , &quot; she said . &quot; But I spent 23 days washing birds , cleaning them. &quot; * An impromptu care center was established on the grounds of the Ventura County Animal Regulation office in Camarillo , where volunteers treated as_many waterfowl as they could . But they fought a losing battle . Very few survived . &quot; It was messy and smelly , &quot; said wildlife rescue volunteer Susan Venegas . &quot; It was a little distressing to see the birds , but we did save some and I felt good about that. &quot; According to Wood-Harris , relief workers were able to save fewer than 40 animals , including a variety of birds , some lizards , a turtle and one toad . Only 25 of those creatures ever made_it back to their habitat , she said . &quot; We did lose a number of animals , but every single one of them would definitely have died had there not been intervention , &quot; Wood-Harris said . &quot; We look_at it as a success if we save one life. &quot; The California Department of Fish and Game is now preparing a natural_resources damage assessment on the region , a document to serve as the foundation for the civil case against Bush Oil and Berry Petroleum . Department of Fish and Game officials and other biologists have been studying the McGrath Lake habitat over the past year , inventorying the returning vegetation and migrating sea_birds to measure the spill ' s full impact . The process is tediously slow . &quot; They can take years , &quot; said Toni Abajian , a U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service biologist surveying McGrath Lake for the federal_government . Abajian declined to discuss in detail how the habitat is recovering , saying she did not want to jeopardize the pending civil case against the oil_company . Deputy Atty . Gen . Jennifer W . Rosenfeld , handling the case against Bush Oil on behalf of numerous state agencies , said negotiations with the company are ongoing , but that any settlement or civil filing is months away . &quot; We are still actively investigating the damages that occurred out there , &quot; Rosenfeld said . &quot; With damages to natural_resources such_as occurred in this case , it can take a long_time to determine the full extent. &quot; State investigators are looking_into every aspect of the case , including the firm ' s immediate and long-term response , as well as the overall impact to the ecosystem , she said . Any civil damages recovered from Berry , a sum likely to be in the seven-figure range , would be used to pay_for continuing restoration work . &quot; There may be lasting effects on the habitat as a result of the spill , &quot; Rosenfeld said . Ricker , the Department of Fish and Game toxicologist heading the state ' s damage assessment , said that more work clearly needs to be done at the site . Still , some progress has been made . &quot; We ' re starting to see some recovery , &quot; he said . &quot; At least the plant_life is returning. &quot; It is too early to speculate on how long the spill may affect the wetland , Ricker said . But in some cases , such residual oil can last for decades , he said . Several other officials also said McGrath Lake and surrounding wetlands are far from full recovery . Inches beneath the sand along the lake shore lie huge pockets of oily residue . &quot; I know there are some spots where there is still oil left , &quot; said Shirley Birosik of the state Water Quality_Control Board in Los Angeles , one of the agencies involved in the civil case . &quot; Probably most of the ( remaining ) oil is_on the edge of the lake , &quot; said Birosik , who visited the site as recently as September . &quot; Getting the oil cleaned_up in the sediment is what ' s important. &quot; * Glen M . Reiser , a private attorney retained by the Ventura County district_attorney to prosecute the criminal case earlier this year , said he found ample evidence that more cleanup needs to be performed when he visited the lake this summer . &quot; Unless it was some aberration that we were standing on a pocket of oil , there needs to be further examination and cleanup , &quot; Reiser said . &quot; ( Fish and Game ) does the best it can under the circumstances , but in this case there could maybe be some remedial cleanup done that would assist the habitat. &quot; Reiser said his investigation found that the pipe Bush used to move its oil beneath Harbor Boulevard was an abandoned , badly corroded gas_line never intended to transport heavy crude . He said he also discovered that company officials failed to repair a faulty safety_valve on the line , choosing to remove it entirely rather than interrupt production despite complaints from oil field workers . The pipeline first ruptured Dec . 16 , 1993 , Reiser said , spilling at least 40 gallons of oil . But Bush never reported that leak and continued to use the failed line until increasing pressure caused the major rupture Dec . 21 , which leaked for days before being discovered , he said . &quot; Berry ' s conduct reflects a substandard approach to oil field operations , &quot; Reiser said . The ruptured pipe itself was excavated in January and remains in the custody of the Ventura County Sheriff ' s Department , state prosecutor Rosenfeld said . A new system was installed weeks later . Goehring , Berry chief financial_officer , acknowledged that his firm might have violated company policy by reactivating the line immediately after the Dec . 16 spill . &quot; Obviously the right thing to do is correct the situation and make_sure it doesn ' t re-occur , &quot; he said . &quot; They must have felt it was a temporary situation and that they would get_it corrected as soon as possible. &quot; Berry has spent more_than $ 800 # 000 upgrading its equipment at McGrath Lake since the leak , Goehring said . The pumps at the McGrath Lake oil field have been back on line since May . Nevertheless , the company is seeking to minimize its liability , having filed claims against six agencies , arguing that each had ignored early reports of the spill made by citizens before Christmas_Day . Berry attorneys filed claims against the Ventura County Sheriff ' s Department , Oxnard police and fire_departments , the California Highway Patrol , California Department of Parks and Recreation , and the Channel Islands Harbor Patrol for failing to immediately respond to early reports of the spill from campers or other citizens . &quot; It made a tremendous difference in the cost and where the oil went because of the lack of reporting , &quot; Goehring said . The various agencies have all denied the claims , but lawyers for Berry Petroleum still may file suit to recoup some of its losses , Goehring said . Negotiations in those cases are ongoing . Reiser and others said the fact that some public response agencies failed to follow up early reports of the spill does not mitigate Berry Petroleum ' s responsibility . The oil_company has made some headway restoring the McGrath Lake habitat to its natural_state , according to records filed with the California Coastal Commission . A letter to the commission dated July 5 states that Berry consultants have succeeded in rebuilding many of the dunes affected by the spill , and that various plants &quot; have re-invaded this area and are actively growing under jute netting. &quot; They also created new breeding areas for migrating snowy plovers , and replaced most of the oil-tainted dirt with clean soil , the letter said . But information in the Coastal Commission application for a restoration permit concedes several other points , including an admission that the company has no inventory of its own transfer pipeline systems . &quot; Bush has no data regarding most of the pipelines which may be located on the property , &quot; attorney Marc L . Charney wrote . &quot; They are considered unregulated. &quot; All that may change . * A law that goes_into effect Jan . 1 requires the state fire_marshal to study the fitness and safety of all low-pressure pipelines in California , and could lead to eventual monitoring of those lines . &quot; You can ' t even consider regulation unless you know what you ' re dealing with , &quot; said Gavin Payne , chief_of_staff to state Sen . Jack O ' Connell ( D-Carpinteria ) , who sponsored the bill as an assemblyman in response to the McGrath Lake spill . For Bruce Fincher , the legislation is long overdue . The Ventura electrician spent part of Christmas_Eve day last year walking with his son and dog along McGrath State Beach south of the lake . Right away he noticed a strong stench of petroleum , and his dog came_back moments later caked in crude_oil . Fincher returned home , washed his mixed breed named Wilbur and called his local officials . &quot; I thought my so-called obligation was satisfied , &quot; he said . &quot; I had contacted our authorities , then I find_out it had gone_on 24 hours without any response. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) McGrath Lake Oil Spill A Bush Oil Co . pipeline ruptured four days before Christmas , 1993 , leaking 84 # 000 gallons of crude_oil into McGrath Lake .
