   <HEADLINE> O.C. ' S VIRGIN INTERACTIVE TO SELL STOCK ; OFFERING : THE VIDEO AND COMPUTER_GAME PUBLISHER WILL DEAL 16 % OF SHARES . OWNER ' S SHARE WILL DIP UNDER 50 % .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Virgin Interactive Entertainment PLC , Orange County ' s largest publisher of video and computer_games , said Wednesday it will put 16 % of its shares up for_sale in an initial_public_offering . Virgin in Irvine will become Orange County ' s only public game publisher in an industry that many analysts believe will introduce the so-called &quot; interactive entertainment &quot; of the future , including games that provide stunning motion-picture quality video , stereo sound and computer animation . The company is owned by Richard Branson , founder of England ' s Virgin Group , the airline and record store empire . Blockbuster Entertainment Video , the giant video rental company , and Hasbro Inc. , the world ' s largest toy maker , paid a total of $ 55 million for minority stakes in the company during the past year . Blockbuster ' s $ 30-million purchase of a 19.9 % stake in Virgin last month suggests Virgin ' s total value is $ 150.7 million . Based on that valuation , the company could raise $ 24 million at $ 13 a share_in the offering . An actual price has not been set . The company said it will use the funds generated from its offering for working capital , product development and general corporate uses . Branson , whose holdings include Virgin Atlantic Airways and Virgin Megastores , would remain the video_game publisher ' s largest shareholder . In the offering , Branson and his family trust would sell 850 # 000 shares of the company ' s current 9.8 million shares . The company also would issue about 1 million shares of new stock , bringing the total shares outstanding to about 11 million . As a result , Branson ' s stake would slip from 61.7 % before the sale to 46.8 % . Branson ' s London-based Virgin Group started its own video_game unit in 1983 and in 1987 it acquired a video_game company in Irvine run_by British transplant Martin Alper , the current president of Virgin Interactive . The company changed its name from Virgin Games to Virgin Interactive Entertainment last year to reflect its push into broader fields of entertainment . &quot; They are one of the best-positioned publishers in the market today , &quot; said John Taylor , an analyst at L.H. Alton &amp; Co. , an investment bank in San Francisco . &quot; They have good titles , good in-house development , worldwide sales distribution and are up_to their elbows in connections to Hollywood. &quot; Richard Devereux , chairman of Virgin Interactive , said the Branson family was selling its stock to fulfill a promise it made when the_Virgin Group went private in 1989 . The company said at the time it would return to the public market with a highly visible business , he said . &quot; This will also raise a lot of money , and that is good to have in this fast-moving , ever-changing industry where opportunities arise every day , &quot; Devereux said . &quot; It ' s useful to have a war chest. &quot; Aside from Nintendo and Sega , which are privately held , Virgin competes against larger independent video_game companies such_as Electronic Arts Inc. in San Mateo , Acclaim Entertainment Inc. in Oyster Bay , N.Y. , and Japanese-owned Capcom in Sunnyvale . Virgin has operations in Irvine , London , Paris , Las Vegas , Tokyo and Hamburg , Germany . The company has 300 employees , many of whom develop games in Irvine and Las Vegas . But it also hires other companies to develop titles published under Virgin ' s name . During the last fiscal_year , it released 31 titles for the Nintendo and Sega systems and for personal_computers . The company ' s more popular titles include &quot; The 7th Guest , &quot; a mystery set_in a haunted mansion that has become the most popular game on computer compact_disk with sales expected to hit 500 # 000 copies by spring ; &quot; Dune , &quot; &quot; Monopoly Deluxe , &quot; &quot; Cool Spot , &quot; &quot; Terminator &quot; and &quot; Robocop vs . Terminator. &quot; Virgin worked with Walt Disney Co . to develop a game based on the animated feature_film &quot; Aladdin &quot; and will do so again with Disney ' s upcoming feature , &quot; The Lion King. &quot; Devereux said the company is investing heavily in developing games for the CD-ROM , or compact_disk , read-only_memory , a software format similar to the music CD that allows the combined use of text , video , graphics and sound . Taylor said CD-ROMs are the fastest-growing format in the industry . &quot; We are a believer in the interactive future , although we will sell our products on whatever technology becomes the dominant format , &quot; Devereux said . A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week reveals Virgin Interactive ' s financial performance for the first time . Virgin reported a loss of $ 4 million on sales of $ 99 million for the fiscal_year ended July 31 , 1993 , compared with a loss of $ 1.5 million on sales of $ 50.2 million in the previous fiscal_year . However , the loss includes a one-time expense of $ 6.4 million to convert the compensation of two top_executives , Alper and Tim Chaney , to stock_options . Not counting the expense , the company reported a profit of $ 4.3 million for the year , Devereux said . The losses in past years were prompted by huge investments -- about $ 9 million a year -- in the next generation of video_games . The company ' s headquarters were recently expanded to include 17 game production studios where teams of eclectic video_game creators labor on expensive Silicon Graphics &quot; graphics supercomputers &quot; to build increasingly complicated games . The company reported a profit of $ 1.1 million on sales of $ 22 million for its first fiscal quarter ended Oct . 31 , compared with a loss of $ 2.7 million on sales of $ 12.5 million in the similar period a year earlier . Blockbuster will own 17.7 % of the stock after the sale , compared with 19.9 % before the sale . Hasbro ' s ownership will decrease from 16.2 % before the sale to 16 % afterward . Both companies have options to sell some stock as a part of this offering . The offering will be underwritten by CS First Boston in New York and Piper Jaffray Inc. in Minneapolis , according to the filing this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission . The company shares will be traded on Nasdaq .</TEXT>
