   <HEADLINE> HOLIDAYS ; PROGRAMS GIVE SKIERS A LIFT ; SEVERAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RESORTS ARE USING ADVANCE-TICKETING SYSTEMS TO CUT DELAYS ON THE WAY TO THE SLOPES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For skiers , making one ' s way down the mountain is heaven . Making ' s one ' s way to the mountain is , well , often an uphill battle . That long , cold , lonely wait in_line to purchase a lift ticket is the final hurdle , yet maybe the most difficult . There you stand , skis in_hand , for as long as 30 minutes -- so close , yet so far from the slopes . And watching all those lucky skiers already frolicking in the snow doesn ' t make the wait any easier . &quot; Your first experience at a ski area , hassling the parking and then going and standing_in a long line . . . nobody wants that , &quot; said Phil Edholm , general_manager of Ski Sunrise near Wrightwood . That much is clear at Snow Summit , where skiers tend to make their feelings known . &quot; Part of my job is to answer customer-complaint letters , &quot; marketing assistant Bonnie Tregaskis said . &quot; And one thing I know that people don ' t like is waiting in_line . I ' d be upset too. &quot; This season , getting from Point A to Point Ski figures to be a lot faster at several Southern California resorts , thanks to new advance-ticketing systems that enable customers to purchase lift tickets before ever pulling their skis out of the garage . Ticketmaster and RealTime , a Manhattan Beach marketing network , have launched programs in which lift-ticket arrangements can be made_over the telephone or by visiting a local sporting goods store . Ticketmaster ' s system will be in_force exclusively at Bear Mountain . RealTime is affiliated with Mt . Baldy , Mt . Waterman , Ski Sunrise and Snow Summit . And Snow Valley plans to expand its advance-ticketing program that originated last season . Such programs , ski-industry sources say , may soon make the lift-ticket window a thing of the past . &quot; Automated advance-ticket technology is definitely the wave of the future in the ski industry , &quot; said Margi La Porte , sales manager at Snow Valley . &quot; Nowadays , you want to offer guests a convenience as much as you want to offer them ways to save money . Five or 10 years down the road , we ' re going to see everybody on this kind of system. &quot; Snow Valley ' s &quot; Park-and-Ski &quot; package began as a pilot_program in which skiers were able to purchase lift tickets in_advance at nine Southern California sporting goods stores . This season , availability will be expanded to more_than 100 stores -- including Big 5 , Oshman ' s and Newport Ski Co . -- from San Diego to Ventura . &quot; People loved it , &quot; La Porte said . &quot; We expect it to be 10 times more effective this year. &quot; RealTime ' s system is similar in that lift tickets are available for purchase at 21 sporting goods stores , including Sport Chalet , Chick ' s Sporting Goods and Newport Ski Co . The system involves the use of ATM-like kiosks from which lift tickets are obtained via credit_card with the touch of a_few buttons . RealTime also includes an electronic catalogue system by which ski equipment and apparel can be purchased from manufacturers , and a television information_system that provides up-to-the-minute ski-related news and snow reports at local and national ski resorts . RealTime ' s system also will be in_force at several Lake Tahoe-area resorts , as well as in areas in Utah , Colorado and the Northeast . &quot; We have been developing this system for two ski seasons , &quot; said Dick Sells , RealTime president . &quot; There is all kinds of research going_on in the ski industry in this area. &quot; Ticketmaster ' s Permanent Ticket is a reusable plastic card -- similar to an ATM card -- that is worn like a lift ticket on the slopes and activated by making a telephone reservation with a credit_card . The card includes a personal identification_number and an electronic bar_code that is scanned with a hand-held_computer by chair_lift operators . Advance-ticket arrangements may differ in names and stipulations , but the premises are the same : Park the car , head for the slopes . &quot; The idea is to get the lift tickets into people ' s hands faster , &quot; La Porte of Snow Valley said . But it doesn ' t take computer_technology to accomplish that at Mountain High in Wrightwood . All it takes is a stop along the way . Wrightwood Ski and Sports , an accessory shop located only two miles from the resort ' s lift-ticket windows , has long been one of the best-kept secrets among resort regulars , said promotions director Tracy Henry . At the shop , skiers not only can purchase lift tickets but also obtain ski rentals for Mountain High . Few skiers are aware of the convenience , Henry said . &quot; Every year , it ' s something new and unique with each ski area , &quot; Henry said . &quot; We just didn ' t feel any ( advance-ticketing system ) was necessary. &quot; Mountains Lowdown Bear Mountain Location : Big Bear Lake .
