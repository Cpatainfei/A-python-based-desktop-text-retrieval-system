   <HEADLINE> SCIENCE ; RISING TO THE TOP FOR A NEW LOOK_AT AN ANCIENT FOREST ; FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NORTH_AMERICA , RESEARCHERS WILL BE ABLE TO STUDY TREES FROM ABOVE WITH THE HELP OF A MECHANICAL CRANE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The silence of an ancient forest has given_way to the sounds of workers erecting a giant steel crane that will give scientists an extraordinary opportunity to study the great old cedars and Douglas firs that tower over this pristine land . When completed late this year , the 240-foot-tall crane will lift scientists above the forest canopy to carry_out long-term research on a part of the forest they rarely get_to study -- the top . The crane is a dream come true for some scientists , who were beginning to wonder if it would take longer to get a permit to erect the crane than it did to grow the forest they want to study . For years scientists tried to acquire a permit to build the crane in Washington ' s Olympic National Forest , but residents of that area feared that the research might lead to the discovery of another spotted owl or some_other creature that would further curtail logging . Faced with threats from some opponents , officials finally killed the project for the Olympic Peninsula , one of the most lush forest canopies in North_America . But the crane has finally found a home here on the northern shores of the Columbia_River , in a community long accustomed to scientific_research . &quot; Down here , reaction has been very positive , &quot; said David Shaw , a forest pathologist with the University of Washington and manager of the crane project . The crane is being erected in the Wind River Experimental Forest , which is part of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest just north of the Columbia_River Gorge . &quot; This land has been designated an experimental forest since the early 1900s , &quot; Shaw said . &quot; Research is not that foreign to these people. &quot; The crane is_on the cutting edge of a new technology , and it will be the first such facility in North_America . Its only rival is a crane in the Panamanian forest , although others are under study for Europe and South_America . The crane can take us to places we can ' t get_to any other way , &quot; Shaw said . &quot; And it can do_it repeatedly , very safely. &quot; The $ 1-million crane is enjoying a rebirth . It was used to construct the new downtown library in San Francisco , and soon it will be used to carry scientists to the treetops to study everything from pollination to plant_disease . Now that it is becoming a fact , the use of a crane to study forest canopies seems an obvious solution to a difficult problem , and Shaw said he expects to see cranes proliferate around the world . In the past , the best way for scientists to study the top of the forest was to climb the trees and carry_out short-term research , but that frequently led to inconsistent and interrupted studies . And some of them fell_out of the trees . &quot; Climbers do get killed , &quot; Shaw said . So little is known about the upper forest canopy that some of the research will be quite basic . Shaw , for example , plans to study the dwarf mistletoe found in the huge Western_hemlock . &quot; It ' s considered one of the most important pests in the West , &quot; he said , and it is blamed for the death of many trees . &quot; It ' s been a very difficult species to study , &quot; because it is found in the tops of the 200-foot-tall trees . &quot; We don ' t even know how it is pollinated , whether by insects or wind . that ' s extremely basic , but it ' s not understood. &quot; The crane , funded by Congress through the U.S. Forest Service , will be operational for at least five years , and scientists hope to keep it up for 10 to 20 years . Any scientist with a need to study the forest canopy is eligible to use it , Shaw said . Among those already lining_up are entomologists , who have had a difficult time_studying insects that inhabit the upper canopy . The crane will allow them to return to precisely the same spot , season after season , to determine the impact of various insects on the forest . Tree physiologists and geneticists also are expected to use the crane extensively . In the past , much of their research has been carried_out on smaller specimens in greenhouses , and it has been very difficult to study the tops of old-growth trees . Planners have taken special precautions in the process of building the crane to keep_from destroying the forest they want to study . A 2 # 000-foot-long road has been built through the forest , and it is so narrow that heavy equipment practically grazes the 450-year-old trees as it is moved to the site . Erecting the crane is a bit tricky . &quot; It ' s kind of hard , &quot; said construction supervisor Jim Brandner . &quot; The problem is , it ' s not self-erecting. &quot; A 360-ton portable crane had to be trucked to the site to lift the heavy steel components into place . Brandner ' s crew recently completed pouring more_than 1 # 000 tons of concrete into a 12-foot-deep hole to provide a footing for the crane . When the 240-foot tower is completed , possibly by early December , a horizontal boom will be added , and it will sweep 360 degrees over 5.6 acres of forest . A gondola below the boom will carry scientists to any part of that area they want to study . That will give them access to the tops of about 1 # 000 trees , mostly Douglas fir , Western_hemlock and cedar . Some of the trees are nearly 500 years old , making_it truly an old-growth forest .</TEXT>
