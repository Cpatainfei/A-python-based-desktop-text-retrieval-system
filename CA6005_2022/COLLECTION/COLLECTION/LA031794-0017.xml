   <TEXT> Leafy , green spinach is often used in salad along with mushrooms , hard-cooked eggs and bacon . But it also works well with steak and pasta . Here are some guidelines for its preparation . Since fresh spinach is sandy , it must be carefully cleaned before cooking . Remove the stems by pulling them off the leaves , then discard . Wash the leaves thoroughly by placing them in a sink full of cold water , lifting them out into a bowl and changing the water . Repeat rinsing two or three times or until no sand remains . Frozen spinach can be substituted for fresh in recipes calling_for cooked pureed spinach , although the flavor and texture will not be quite as good because frozen spinach also contains stems . Because frozen spinach is already blanched , it does not require cooking in water , but simply thawing ; to save time , however , it can be cooked in boiling water until it thaws , then drained and squeezed according to the recipe . Fresh and frozen spinach vary in the amounts of actual cooked spinach obtainable from a certain weight . From 1 1 / 2 pounds of fresh spinach ( weight including stems ) , I have most often obtained 3 / 4 cup puree , but occasionally only 1 / 2 cup . In comparing 10-ounce packages of frozen spinach of different brands , I have also found that they give between 1 / 2 cup and 3 / 4 cup puree . Keep this in mind if the exact quantity of puree is crucial to the recipe . * In the Provencal-style dish of grilled steak with garlic and spinach , sauteed garlic slices add a pleasant crunch and aroma to the steak . Instead of sirloin , Porterhouse , T-bone or club steak can be used . A creamy spinach sauce is used in bow_ties with spinach sauce and Gruyere cheese . This you make by simmering lightly cooked spinach in cream and seasoning it with its best partners -- nutmeg and cheese -- making a bright-green complement to the butterfly-shaped pasta . GRILLED STEAK WITH GARLIC AND SPINACH 9 garlic_cloves Freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons Cognac or brandy 7 tablespoons olive_oil 1 ( 1 1 / 2 pound ) top sirloin_steak , about 1 inch thick 3 pounds fresh spinach , stems removed , leaves rinsed well , or 2 ( 10-ounce ) packages frozen leaf spinach 1 tablespoon butter Salt Finely chop 4 garlic_cloves . Combine chopped garlic with pepper to taste in small shallow dish . Stir in Cognac and 3 tablespoons olive_oil . Trim off excess fat from steak . Add steak to dish and coat on all sides with Cognac mixture . Cover and marinate 2 hours at room_temperature or overnight in refrigerator . Place fresh spinach in large saucepan of enough boiling salted water to cover . Return to boil and boil , uncovered , until just tender and wilted , about 2 minutes . If using frozen spinach , cook according to package instructions until just separated . Drain spinach . Rinse with cold running water until cool and drain thoroughly . Squeeze spinach by handfuls to remove as much water as possible . Coarsely chop spinach with knife . Cut remaining 5 garlic_cloves into very thin lengthwise slices . Cover and set_aside . Prepare charcoal grill or heat ridged stop-top grill over high heat , or preheat broiler with rack about 3 inches from heat source . Remove steak from marinade and pat dry . Grill or broil until browned on both sides and done to taste , about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare . ( Rare meat does not resist when pressed , medium-rare meat resists slightly , medium-done meat resists slightly more , and meat that is_well done is springy to touch. ) Transfer to carving board and keep warm . Heat remaining 1 / 4 cup olive_oil in medium skillet over low heat . Add garlic slices and cook until tender and lightly browned , turning occasionally , about 5 minutes . Remove with slotted spoon . Add spinach to oil from cooking garlic and heat , stirring . Add butter and stir until absorbed . Season to taste with salt and pepper . To serve , cut steak into thin slices . Place spinach on hot_plates . Arrange steak slices on top . Season to taste with salt . Garnish with garlic slices . Makes 3 to 4 servings .

Cook uncovered over high heat until wilted , about 2 minutes . Drain . Rinse with cold water and drain well . Squeeze_out as much liquid as possible . Chop spinach .

( Sauce can be kept , covered , up_to 1 day in refrigerator. ) Bring large pan of salted water to boil . Add pasta . Cook uncovered over high heat , stirring occasionally until tender but firm to bite , 6 to 8 minutes . Meanwhile , heat sauce to simmer over low heat . Add remaining 1 / 4 cup cream and bring_to simmer . Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and heat until blended . Drain pasta well . Transfer to heated serving dish . Add sauce and toss to blend .
