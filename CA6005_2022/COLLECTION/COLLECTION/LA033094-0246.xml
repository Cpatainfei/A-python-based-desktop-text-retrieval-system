   <HEADLINE> STATE ECONOMY IN RECOVERY , UCLA FINDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After California ' s dispiriting slide into the depths of recession , a long-awaited recovery has finally begun , according to a UCLA analysis to be released today . The report of a slow recovery is the first by a prominent forecasting group that the state ' s deepest slump in six decades has ended and a fragile expansion is in_progress . Moreover , the analysis may signal a broader shift in perceptions about California ' s economy in light of surprising recent data on jobs and housing . In a revision to be made public Friday , the state Employment Development Department now estimates that California added payroll jobs in January and February -- the first consecutive two-month gain since mid-1990 . Similarly , California shared_in a national jump in consumer confidence in March , it was reported Tuesday , although the state level remains lower than the nation ' s . &quot; By the time you read this , California will be in recovery ! &quot; exclaimed economists Larry J . Kimbell and Tom K . Lieser in the new UCLA report , which cites earthquake rebuilding aid as a short-term catalyst . Still , while Orange County economists agreed with the UCLA analysis that the state ' s economy may be in recovery , they said the Southern California economy has much further to go . &quot; For the state as_a_whole , it may be correct to say it ' s in recovery , but that ' s definitely not correct for Los Angeles County and we ' re certainly not going_to have job growth of any consequence in Orange County this year , &quot; said Walter Hahn , an economist with Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. , an accounting_firm . &quot; Basically , Southern California as_a_whole will probably lose jobs this year while the rest of the state will do OK. &quot; There are other limits to the enthusiasm , however : Job gains are expected to be frustratingly slow and uneven in the emerging recovery , and the aerospace squeeze will continue . Thousands more high-paying defense jobs will vanish in the next few years . Yet even a lukewarm upturn would be a striking shift from the four-year barrage of bleak economic news , a traumatic period in which the state lost between 600 # 000 and 800 # 000 jobs . For the first time since 1990 , the UCLA analysis says , Californians have reason to anticipate an increase in jobs , incomes , retail sales and construction . &quot; This solidifies trends we saw at the end of 1993 ; trends like a drop_in unemployment , increased home sales and consumer confidence up . I think what you ' re seeing now is the beginning of the growth cycle , &quot; said Dennis Aigner , dean of the UC Irvine Graduate_School of Management . &quot; Orange County has always been a bit of a favored area in this recession . It ' s not as if we ' ve been immune but we have not been hit to the extent Los Angeles has. &quot; However , Aigner predicted Orange County was still in_for some economic pain as continued defense restructuring and the closure of El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station will put more people out_of_work . &quot; While there are still all_of these positive signs of the recovery there is still the issue of the base closures , &quot; Aigner said . The county must work to retain its businesses , he added , noting that a UC Irvine survey shows an increasing number of Orange County-based companies are considering relocating . In 1992 , only 20 % of the local companies were considering moving , Aigner said , but by last October that number had increased to 38 % . &quot; that ' s surely not a good sign for Orange County or the state , &quot; he said . To make their case , economists at the UCLA Business Forecasting Project selected from a growing if tentative array of evidence : * Payroll jobs rose 15 # 900 in February and 7 # 300 in January -- a month in which officials earlier had counted a decline , according to state Employment Development Department estimates . * Business failures in January , as gauged by Dun &amp; Bradstreet , fell 23.3 % in California compared to a year ago . * Sales of existing homes have been running about 20 % higher than year-ago levels , a rally that could boost purchases of everything from curtains to carpets to kitchen cabinets . &quot; We ' ve changed our thinking , &quot; said Adrian Sanchez , a regional economist at Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp , which is revising its forecast in light of the improved economic news . &quot; California is clearly close to a recovery. &quot; The public mood is improving , albeit from very low levels , according to a survey released Tuesday by the privately funded Conference Board . The report found that consumer confidence in the Pacific region , largely reflecting California , jumped a healthy 6.8 points on the board ' s index , the same increase registered nationally . Until now , economists have generally viewed the California economy as having hit bottom , almost like a sunken ship creeping along the ocean_floor but too weak to climb back_up . A recovery , while a somewhat inexact term for a state economy , suggests steady lift in a range of economic gauges , particularly jobs . Some economists , such_as the UCLA forecasters , had expected a slow ascent to begin in the second_half of the year ; other analysts had not anticipated a revival before year ' s end or 1995 . Indeed , not everyone is persuaded that a bona_fide upturn is in_progress . &quot; I ' m not going_to drink a bottle of Dom Perignon just yet , &quot; said Joseph A . Wahed , chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco . &quot; Companies are still laying_off people and going_out of business . This is not a recovery in the real sense of the world. &quot; Key evidence will become available Friday , when March job totals are reported , showing whether the gains of January and February have been sustained . &quot; In Orange County , job expansion won ' t take_place till at least the third quarter of this year , &quot; said Esmael Adibi , director of the Center for Economic Research at Chapman University . &quot; Then we will start to add jobs to the local payrolls. &quot; Economists also are monitoring the recent sharp rise in interest_rates . Low rates have boosted the state and national economies by making houses , autos , factory equipment and other items cheaper to buy on credit . &quot; I think they ' re a major wild card , &quot; Sanchez said of interest_rates . According to the UCLA forecast , the fledgling upturn will become more apparent in the coming months as personal_income -- a broad measure that reflects re-employment , added working hours and more -- grows in the 5 % range , a pace it may maintain for the next few years . Retail sales also are expected to improve this year . The state ' s jobless rate , which has been hovering in the 9 % to 10 % range , should decline gradually to 7.6 % by 1996 , the UCLA researchers estimate , with more_than nine out of 10 new jobs in construction , trade and services . A sharp rise in home building also will help the economy , analysts said . The state ' s battered home building industry appears to have hit bottom last June , when new homes were started at an annual rate of about 80 # 000 . By December and January , the pace had edged_up to 90 # 000 -- still a far_cry from the booming rate of a quarter-million in the late 1980s . &quot; The anecdotal evidence we ' re getting from the builders suggests there ' s quite a bit in the pipeline , &quot; said Ted Gibson , principal economist at the state_Department of Finance . Such areas as tourism , recreation and international trade will be among the sources of rising employment , the UCLA report said . California ' s jobless rate is expected to exceed the nation ' s through the late 1990s , however . In the next couple of years , more unemployed people will leave the state , drop_out of the labor_force and settle for jobs that pay less than their previous ones . In the short run , the Jan . 17 earthquake may help revive the regional economy , adding 20 # 000 jobs in the next year , according to the UCLA analysis . It might also accelerate a drop_in unemployment , partly through new jobs and partly through the more painful measure of people moving away . Longer term , the study said , the quake ' s effect on Southern California ' s economy will be very small but negative , as some businesses choose to stay out of the region , cutting job growth by about 30 # 000 . &quot; The seismic risks in Los Angeles and California in_general are_well known , but the earthquake serves to remind investors of those risks , &quot; the report said . The analysis is not the first time that UCLA ' s forecasters have stood apart from the pack . A series of gloomy forecasts during the recession by Kimbell ' s predecessor , David Hensley , upset many in the state ' s business_Establishment , although the dramatic forecasts proved on target .
