   <HEADLINE> BUILDING UP CALIFORNIA ABS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There once was a time when abalone , this most succulent of shellfish , was plentiful along the Pacific Coast of North_America . Within barely a generation , however , the delicate mollusk and its distinctive ear-shaped shell has become a rarity in the wild , a victim of gastronomic overkill . Experts have several explanations for this unfortunate depletion . The main reasons include overfishing and illegal gathering of undersized abalones . Abalones also suffer from the gluttonous appetite of such natural predators as California sea_otters , whose taste for it rivals that of discriminating epicures . These various factors account_for the 90 % drop_in commercially available wild abalone over the past 30 years , principally along the Southern California coast . Luckily , there is new hope for American abalone fanciers . Thanks to a handful of forward-thinking aquaculturists who have established commercial abalone &quot; farms , &quot; Pacific red abalone is making a domesticated comeback . The endeavor requires intensive scientific_research as well as staggering amounts of patience , for abalone in the shell grows only one inch a year and requires up_to three years before it reaches marketable size . Biologist John McMullen , a 20-year veteran of abalone production and founder of AbLab in Port Hueneme , Calif. , was one of the first to farm abalone . He specializes in live , three-inch California-farmed abalone in the shell . * &quot; We want people to know they ' re really eating abalone , &quot; he explains . &quot; There ' s a lot of consumer education involved . Abalone is still relatively unknown outside California. &quot; At AbLab , the abalone is nurtured from the egg stage , when it is tinier than a grain of sand , to marketable size . For three years , the pampered mollusks feed_on sea water and fresh kelp in large round tubs located within a_few feet of the beach and cooled by fresh ocean breezes . The end_product is so tender that &quot; we don ' t even need to pound it into a steak , &quot; says McMullen . Farther up the California coast , Pacific Mariculture occupies the edge of a low , scraggly cliff a_few miles north of Santa Cruz . Fittingly , the farm lies_in the shadow of the oldest Indian midden ( prehistoric refuse mound ) in California , a pile consisting largely of discarded abalone shells ; it once belonged_to the Alones -- whence the name abalone . The shimmering blue crescent of Monterey Bay serves as a backdrop . In the distance , glistening acres of kelp nurture some of the best fishing grounds in the state , a fact not lost on the army of sea_gulls and brown pelicans floating lazily over the waves . Home to one of the world ' s richest ecosystems , this area was recently declared a marine sanctuary . The fresh sea water of Monterey Bay is continuously pumped into the 400 # 000-gallon tank towering over the Pacific Mariculture acres -- water that , in turn , is funneled into dozens of fiberglass tubs brimming with abalone in various stages of growth . In some tubs , seedlings are so small as_to be almost invisible to the naked eye . In others , clouds of bubbles breaking_through the blanket of fresh kelp are telltale indicators of the &quot; baby &quot; abalones ' healthful appetite . * Pacific Mariculture maintains close ties with the University of California-Santa Cruz ( and also with Stanford_University ) , which advises the company in matters of animal selection and improved breeding techniques . &quot; We saw what the future would be , &quot; says Pacific Mariculture ' s president , Dr. Peter Scrivani , a founder and researcher for the project . &quot; It ' s simply old-fashioned farming with a college education. &quot; Their most popular product is the Petite 1 3 / 4-inch abalone , popular_with Bay Area chefs . Like their colleagues at Pacific Mariculture , Chris and Linda Van Hook of ABALONE International in Crescent City , Calif. , have spent years perfecting their product . &quot; We should have been bank tellers ; we would have made more money , &quot; says Chris Van Hook , whose hearty laugh belies the fact that he spent eight full years exploring the Pacific Coast from Baja California to Vancouver , securing the perfect site and the permits that would allow him to grow ocean-raised abalone . Crescent City ' s wide oceanic harbor , close to the Oregon border , fit the bill perfectly for Van Hook to fulfill his ambition . * The year 1988 marked the beginning of ABALONE International and a 40-year lease in the waters of Crescent City Harbor . Armed with a B.A. degree in environmental studies from the University of California-Santa Barbara , the aquaculturist started toying_with the idea of producing abalone commercially as far back as 1976 . &quot; Nearly all land-based farms were started in the ' 70s when energy wasn ' t a major consideration , &quot; he says . &quot; We set_about it totally the opposite way . We asked ourselves , where should we go ? Rather than remaining landlocked , I preferred to go_out in the ocean with my cages. &quot; In a departure from most other similar ventures , Van Hook ' s abalones grow in cages hanging from a long floating dock , inside converted plastic barrels that have had top and bottom removed and replaced with plastic mesh to allow_for free circulation of sea water . When they reach 39 millimeters in size , the juvenile abalone are transferred to large , rectangular plastic mesh cages that hold vertical panels . The abalone attach themselves to the panels in the same way they attach_to rocks in the wild . A labor-intensive feeding process ensures correct nutrition , requiring kelp to be gathered from wild kelp beds ( for which a small fee is paid to the state ) , then brought_to the farm site and cut_up into small pieces before being fed to the developing abalone . Three years later , the three-inch mollusk will be ready for market , a lengthy process by any stretch of the imagination , and one that explains the abalone ' s relatively high market_price . * A sideline of ABALONE International ' s commitment to sound environmental practices is its cooperation with the Del Norte County Abalone Replant Program . Funds gathered through fines levied by the county ' s fish and game department purchase three-quarter-inch abalone in_order to &quot; replant &quot; them in the rocks lining the county shoreline . Through such programs , hopes Van Hook , wild abalone might once again thrive in California waters . At US Abalone in Princeton , south of San Francisco , farming is also a family operation . Tom Ebert , an aquaculture scientist and a veteran of 17 years in abalone research and production , holds a master ' s degree in marine research from the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory in California . He credits his father , Earl , a research_director at the California Department of Fish and Game for more_than 30 years , with being one of the pioneers in abalone research in the state . Ebert ' s brother , David , who holds a Ph.D. in marine ecology and fisheries science , is now in_charge of expansion and development . US Abalone actually consists_of two operations : one on land and the other at_sea . At the Santa Cruz facility , the abalone is raised in raceways , or long troughs , continually fed sea water and seaweed . At the open ocean location in Pillar Point Harbor , abalone are raised in large cages suspended from 20-by-12-foot rafts just inside the breakwater . * &quot; The flavor of the meat depends_upon food and water quality , &quot; explains Tom Ebert , who , like his colleagues , sees a tremendous national potential for farm-raised abalone . &quot; Much of our success in marketing our product domestically depends_on educating the public. &quot; Although national consumption is increasing , thanks to many upscale chefs ' predilection for the product , much of the California abalone production is still bound for the Japanese market , which tolerates premium prices . Thanks to these commercial producers , American consumers may well join in the abalone feast once again . * Chris Van Hook credits his friend Diane Davies with developing this recipe . &quot; Don ' t forget to save the shells , &quot; he advises . &quot; They make beautiful containers for the sauce. &quot; Placed in the refrigerator on a drain board so they do not sit in water , abalone will stay alive for three days , and fresh for four additional days . Abalone can also be prepared immediately and frozen between layers of wax_paper . ABALONE IN JADE SAUCE 10 ( 2 1 / 2-inch ) abalone 2 tablespoons minced ginger root 3 / 4 pound spinach , rinsed , stemmed and patted dry 1 bunch chives , rinsed and dried 4 sprigs cilantro 4 basil leaves 1 / 4 cup chicken_stock 3 / 4 cup whipping cream 1 / 2 teaspoon salt 1 / 4 teaspoon Chinese chili_sauce 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon cold water 1 / 4 cup butter , cut_up Freshly ground pepper Rinse , tenderize and thoroughly dry abalone scallops . Rub scallops with half of ginger root . Cover and refrigerate until ready to use . To make sauce , process spinach , chives , cilantro , basil and remaining ginger root in increments until finely chopped in blender or food_processor . Add chicken_stock and process until fairly smooth . Add cream , salt and chili_sauce . Process until pureed . Place mixture in medium saucepan over low heat and bring_to simmer . Meanwhile , combine cornstarch with 1 tablespoon cold water in small bowl . Mix until smooth . Add mixture to simmering sauce . Stir until well blended . Cook , stirring occasionally , until sauce thickens , 2 to 4 minutes longer . Place prepared abalone on baking sheet . Dot with butter . Season to taste with pepper . Bake abalone at 500 degrees until flesh turns white and is firm to touch , 3 to 4 minutes . Remove from oven . Spoon sauce in pool on dinner_plate . Place abalone on top of sauce . Serve immediately . Makes about 4 servings . Note : To prepare and tenderize abalone , run thin-bladed knife around inside edge of shell to shuck out meat . Discard visceral parts without trimming off dark edges . Then place abalone scallop in plastic zipper food bag . With wooden mallet , using sharp wrist movements , tap flesh repeatedly without ripping apart , working in circular motion , starting from center , to obtain uniform thickness . Repeat same procedure for other side . Or place abalone scallop on lower half of tea_towel , fold other half over scallop and pound as directed . * This recipe from Pacific Mariculture calls_for the small abalone , usually reserved for appetizer-size helpings . Leave the abalone in the shell until ready to use . GRILLED ABALONE 1 / 4 cup soy_sauce 1 / 4 cup sake or dry Sherry 2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable_oil 2 tablespoons minced ginger root 12 small abalone in shells Bring charcoal to red-hot stage in outdoor grill . Mix soy_sauce , sake , oil and ginger root in medium bowl . Remove abalone meat from shells and place in marinade . Marinate 10 minutes . Return marinated abalone to shells . Reserve marinade . Place filled shells , shell side down , on oiled grill . Grill 1 minute , shell will act_as receptacle . With tongs , turn shells with abalone over carefully and grill 30 seconds longer until meat is lightly browned . Heat reserved marinade until boiling and use as dipping sauce . Serve abalone in their own shells immediately . Makes 4 servings .</TEXT>
