   <HEADLINE> CITY GOES AFTER GANG MEMBERS ON TOP 25 LIST ; CRIME : DEPUTIES ARE TARGETING THOSE CONSIDERED THE MOST VIOLENT . IN EIGHT MONTHS , 30 HAVE BEEN ARRESTED OR LEFT TOWN . NEW NAMES HAVE REPLACED THEM ON THE LIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lil Zig Zag was arrested on murder_charges . Joker ' s sitting in jail , accused of armed robbery . And Gizmo moved_out of town . So Los Angeles County sheriff ' s deputies knocked three names off Paramount ' s list . And three more were waiting to take their places . &quot; The list &quot; is not where a young_man living_in Paramount wants to be these days . It names the 25 youths considered to be the most violent gang members in town . Those on the list can expect to see a deputy two to four times a day . Six deputies have been added_to Paramount streets to watch the targeted gang members . The list is the core of Paramount ' s new Target_Program -- the city ' s most recent attempt to salvage its image as a quiet suburb . Since the program began eight months ago , at least 30 youths have been jailed -- sometimes as a direct result of surveillance -- or have abruptly moved_out of town and out of the spotlight , according to Sheriff ' s Department and city officials . The department ' s top brass is excited about the program , enough so to send the idea to a national law_enforcement organization , which will distribute it to interested agencies nationwide . &quot; We ' re not saying Paramount is crime-free , but the gang problem is way down , &quot; Deputy City_Manager Patrick West said . * Of 10 homicides in the city in 1992 , seven were considered gang-related . Although killings increased to 14 during 1993 , just three were gang-related , he said . Businessman Chuck Lyons gauges gang activity by the amount of graffiti he has to clean off the 94 warehouses his company , Fu-Lyons Associates , owns or manages in town . &quot; I can tell you graffiti is way down , and we take that as a real good sign , &quot; Lyons said . &quot; We tell people who are thinking_of moving here about the Target_Program , and it is a big selling point. &quot; For deputies , the case of Bouncer is one example of the program ' s success . Bouncer , 20 , whose real name is Adrian Guerrero , was_on the list . Sheriff ' s deputies had contacted him repeatedly . He knew , no doubt , that he was being watched . But on Sept . 22 , he and another young_man went_to Downey with a . 380 Beretta automatic handgun . At 4:30 p.m. , they walked into Omega Burger at Lakewood Boulevard and Imperial Highway , pulled the gun and demanded cash , Downey police Detective Ed Compton said . Bouncer and the accomplice got $ 371 and took_off , just as Compton pulled_up in an unmarked car . The officer followed but got mired in traffic . Meanwhile , a deputy from the Paramount sheriff ' s substation heard the robbery report on the police radio and drove to the Downey border . In a mini-mall parking_lot , he saw Bouncer and the other youth and decided to talk with them . While they were talking , the radio squawked out complete descriptions of the two robbery_suspects . The deputy realized he was looking right at them . Guerrero was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced in November to seven years in prison . The 17-year-old was not charged because witnesses were unable to identify him . A list of Target_Program successes also includes such entries as : * M-Loc , 17 , nine previous arrests . &quot; Released from custody , moved to Arizona . Moved back and now in CYA Camp. &quot; * Gangster , 22 , 10 previous arrests . &quot; Felony arrest for assault with a gun. &quot; * D-Dog , 20 , two previous arrests . &quot; Felony arrest for robbery. &quot; * Sniper , 17 , three previous arrests . &quot; Felony arrest for assault -- sentenced to eight years prison. &quot; Two youths on the list died . One was shot in a South-Central Los Angeles gunfight . Another walked through a plate-glass window in Orange County while under the influence of drugs . In at least one case , a targeted gang member went_to Paramount ' s new substation and asked about the program . Then he announced his intention to leave the city . He has not been seen in town since , West said . &quot; And there are some that just grow out of ( gangbanging ) , but they are few and far between , &quot; Sgt . Peggy O ' Neal said . According to Sheriff ' s Capt . John Anderson , all 25 youths on the initial list are in jail or have moved_out of town . Deputies closest to the program say it is nearly impossible to give an exact count of how many gang members have left town . Sometimes , the list changes quickly as deputies receive new information on who has been sent to jail or has moved . To get_on the list , a youth must be a gang member as defined by state law , meaning he or she must claim membership to a gang whose members engage in criminal activity , O ' Neal said . After that one criterion is met , selection to the target list becomes more subjective . A violent history is certainly a common_denominator , but not all have been arrested for violent acts . One youth , who goes_by the street name Toro , was added_to the list after he was shot at twice by &quot; rival gang members , &quot; said Public Safety Director Robert D . Robinson . Toro ' s mother was caught in the cross-fire once , suffering bullet wounds in her face . Another time , cheerleader Sheila Lorta , 16 , was killed by a bullet probably meant for Toro , Robinson said . Toro is also suspected of other gang activities , said Robinson , who would not elaborate . The American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern about the Target_Program , saying the deputies ' tactics could cross the line into harassment . The ACLU requested information on the program from the Sheriff ' s Department months ago , but the request has gone unanswered , said Mark Silverstein , an ACLU attorney . City and sheriff ' s officials refused to reveal the names or criminal histories of those on the list . Even in cases where an adult was arrested and convicted , making the name_part of the public record , officials would not reveal the identities of the people on the list . Although they are secretive about the list , officials say they are convinced that the program is working -- and necessary . They knew a new tactic was needed , West said , after three 1992 slayings . In three high-profile cases that year , suspected gang members killed three people who were , or had been , students at Paramount High_School : Alfred Clark , 17 , a star athlete who was shot the day before graduation after refusing to surrender his compact_disc player at a McDonald ' s restaurant near campus ; Lorta , the cheerleader who was_on a break from practice and was caught in a drive-by_shooting ; and Maritza Bonilla , 21 , an aspiring hairstylist , who was fatally wounded at her sister ' s birthday_party in a drive-by_shooting that injured nine others . * More_than any other incidents , these three cases made city leaders take_stock and realize they were losing the war against gangs . &quot; It all started with the Alfred Clark murder , really . It was a pointless , needless , horrible murder , &quot; West said . A task_force of about 60 city officials , residents , teachers and deputies brainstormed and came_up with the Target_Program . In April , the City_Council agreed to raise the utility users ' tax by 2 % , which costs the average family $ 3 a month , to generate $ 1 million a year and pay_for six new deputies , a crime analyst and new equipment . As part of the Target_Program , Robinson , the civilian head of Paramount ' s Public Safety Department , has become a sworn officer , giving him more control of day-to-day Sheriff ' s Department operations , although he is not attached_to any department . The money also paid_for one fairly inexpensive item : a magnetic bulletin_board in the substation ' s back_room where deputies check their targets . Then deputies take_to the streets , keeping_in mind that 25 youths out there need a visit .</TEXT>
