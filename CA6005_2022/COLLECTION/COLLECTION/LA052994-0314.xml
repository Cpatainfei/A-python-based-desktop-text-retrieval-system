   <HEADLINE> MARCHERS ASSAIL BIAS AGAINST IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thousands of Latinos marched through Downtown Los Angeles on Saturday in a tightly organized counterattack on what participants called a growing sentiment in California and the nation against immigrants -- both legal and illegal . At a time when many legislators in California and elsewhere say illegal immigration is draining government treasuries , the marchers -- estimated at 8 # 000 to 25 # 000 -- voiced the hope that their effort would galvanize a movement to defend the new immigrants who have altered the nation ' s demographic makeup . Protesters in the march , one of Los Angeles ' largest demonstrations in recent years , emphasized the contributions of legal and unlawful newcomers in paying taxes , performing low-wage jobs , launching businesses and revitalizing inner-city communities from Los Angeles to New York . They pledged to reverse what they acknowledged is a legislative tide against immigration and to avert further defeats in the political and legislative arenas . &quot; We ' re here to put an end to the big lie propagated by all those who use immigrants for political expediency , &quot; said Roberto Lovato , executive_director of the Central_American Resource Center in the city ' s Pico-Union district , a densely populated immigrant enclave west of Downtown . &quot; This is a civil_rights movement for the 1990s , &quot; Lovato said . &quot; I came here to show support for my people , &quot; said Maria Rodriguez , 40 , a Mexican citizen who was accompanied by her 2- and 5-year-old sons . Although police estimated that 8 # 000 made the well-coordinated , two-mile trek up Broadway , which culminated in a rally on the west steps of City_Hall , organizers said 25 # 000 took_part . Latino groups , immigrant advocates and Spanish-language media had promoted the march in recent weeks . Police reported no arrests and no major disturbances . A bulging line of marchers , many waving Mexican and Salvadoran flags and led by a red-lettered banner reading &quot; Stop Racist Attacks Against Immigrants , &quot; filled 10 blocks along Broadway , where ground-level stores cater to Latino shoppers . Festive participants hoisted colorful placards and banners , their rhythmic chants echoing off the grimy facades of once-elegant office_buildings lining the boulevard . A few men donned broad-brimmed Mexican sombreros . A band from Tijuana , its members outfitted in green fatigues , provided a steady drumbeat of marching music . The principal target of the march was Gov . Pete Wilson , who has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his reelection campaign , using ominous television advertisements showing people rushing across the U.S.-Mexico border . Banners and slogans excoriated the governor , whose stuffed figure was burned in effigy in front of City_Hall . Although Wilson and others seeking to limit immigrants have attempted to distinguish between their opposition to unlawful immigration and their support of regulated legal immigration , marchers contended that the governor and his allies are fomenting antipathy against all immigrants . &quot; The backlash against immigrants becomes anti-Latino sentiment , &quot; said Susan Alva , staff attorney with the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles . Many banners said : &quot; No Human_Being Is Illegal. &quot; &quot; The politicians are happy to have my people here working , but they don ' t want us to have any rights , &quot; said Jasmin Aguilar , a U.S.-born college_student and daughter of immigrants who held_up an image of the_Virgin of Guadalupe , the revered Roman_Catholic patroness of Mexico and Latin_America . Participants included immigrants and U.S. natives , the documented and undocumented , the elderly and young . Activists , politicians , clerics and ordinary working people were part of the mix . The prevalent mood was one of ethnic pride spiced with outrage at what many view_as a racially motivated assault . &quot; The church cannot remain silent while its people are made victims , &quot; said Father Vicente Lopez of St . Rafael ' s Roman_Catholic_Church in South-Central Los Angeles , one of four Carmelite priests in flowing brown cassocks who marched at the head of the protest . The orderly marchers took their cues from several dozen organizers with bullhorns who guided the entourage . It took nearly an hour for the throng to fill City_Hall ' s park and adjoining 1st Street . Although this was largely a Latino event -- reflecting Latinos ' position as the largest immigrant population in California -- speakers also voiced support for Haitian refugees who have been denied entry to U.S. territory . And Asian Americans also joined in assailing what many characterized as making immigrants the scapegoat for the nation ' s many woes . &quot; We people_of_color are being blamed for a socioeconomic crisis in this country , &quot; said Fernando Fernando , a representative of Los Angeles ' large Filipino American community , who was among the many speakers addressing the rally . Many urged immigrants to sign_up for citizenship , a step strongly nationalistic Mexican immigrants have traditionally been hesitant to take . U.S. authorities have vowed to bolster citizenship programs in an effort to ease an expected crush of applications . More_than 3 million foreigners -- more_than half living_in California -- obtained legal residency via the federal amnesty initiative of 1987-88 ; most are only now becoming eligible for citizenship . &quot; We must become citizens and vote so that our voices can be heard , &quot; said Dolores Huerta , co-founder of the United Farm_Workers of America . Illustrating the anti-Wilson sentiment , vendors hawked T-shirts that featured the governor with his neck in a noose . One person carried a figure of a skeleton hung , crucifix-style , from crossing M-16 rifles . It bore a banner stating : &quot; Made by Wilson. &quot; Saturday ' s march , while garnering media attention , is unlikely to alter the increasingly heated public_debate about immigration , according to those seeking reductions on immigration . Washington and Sacramento are awash in proposed bills that would cut legal entries and exclude benefits for those who are in the United States illegally . &quot; It is quite clear that the American people feel there is too_much immigration , &quot; said Ira Mehlman , Los Angeles representative for the Federation for American Immigration Reform . The protest comes as a citizens group is pushing an initiative -- probably for the November ballot -- that would deny public education and most health_care to California ' s large undocumented population . An initiative strategist said the march would paradoxically boost the cause , publicizing efforts to reduce illegal immigration . &quot; I would advise ' em to have a march every month , &quot; said Harold Ezell , a former Immigration and Naturalization Service official who is one of the initiative ' s sponsors . Nevertheless , organizers say they plan to schedule similar demonstrations , including at least one more before the November election , which some political observers see as a referendum of sorts on immigration . Saturday ' s event was sponsored by a statewide network of civil_rights and immigrant advocacy groups including the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles , and the Central_American Refugee Center and One Stop Immigration . Among the participants were Councilmen Mike Hernandez and Richard Alatorre . Simultaneous protests were held_in Sacramento , San Diego , Fresno , San Jose and Santa Maria . Some of the loudest applause in the Los Angeles rally erupted as speakers called_for a 1996 march_on Washington as a national demonstration of support for Latino rights . Organizers of Saturday ' s event compared the idea to the 1963 march_on Washington , and said such a demonstration could illuminate the plight of immigrants , particularly those from Latin_America .
