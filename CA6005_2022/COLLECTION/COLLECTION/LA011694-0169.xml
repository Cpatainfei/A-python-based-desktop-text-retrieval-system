   <HEADLINE> U.N. SENDS DEPUTY TO ARISTIDE MEETING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.N. ' s chief trouble-shooter on Haiti will not be attending the weekend conference_called by exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on the future of the country . The United Nations will send Colin Granderson , executive_director of the U.N. operation in Haiti , and not chief mediator , Dante Caputo , to the Miami conference , a U.N. spokesman said Friday . The move apparently reflects doubts by the United Nations that the conference would have much impact in solving the Haitian crisis as well as disappointment with Aristide for killing a broad-based conference planned for December in Haiti , diplomats said . Officially , U.N. spokesmen say that Caputo could not go_to Miami because he is at his home_in Argentina and would not arrive in time . They point_out that in addition to Granderson two officials from U.N. headquarters in New York will attend . Of the four nations serving as an advisory body on Haiti at the United Nations , the United States is sending Lawrence Pezzullo , Washington ' s special envoy for Haiti . France , Venezuela and Canada are sending medium-level delegates . Aristide had originally excluded the military from the conference but then invited them , although it was doubtful they would attend . Diplomats also said it was not certain if representatives from the private sector would arrive . Many prominent Haitians had expressed a hope to attend , but were fearful of reprisals from the military if they said so publicly , Aristide ' s backers say . U.S. officials had pressed for inclusion of military representatives saying it would be harder to resolve the crisis if they failed to take_part . Like the United States , U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed a conference he first backed in December called by Prime_Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all_the feuding parties together . At the same time , diplomats said there was a realization that the Haiti problem could not be resolved without Aristide , the country ' s first democratically elected president who warned U.N. officials months ago that the military would not restore democracy without an international force on the scene .</TEXT>
