   <HEADLINE> CAMP CURBSIDE ; NEIGHBORHOODS : HOMELESS FIND SAFE HAVEN IN THEIR VEHICLES ALONG A STRETCH OF STREET IN SILVER LAKE . RESIDENTS CALL FOR THEIR OUSTER , SAYING THE CAMPERS ARE SPOILING THE AREA AND HURTING PROPERTY VALUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For four years , a 1972 Dodge van with its tiny bed has been home to Ralph Smith . A few steps away a man known only as Ed spends his days_watching a small portable television in a pickup_truck with a camper on top . Behind them , Betty West lives in a trailer with her dog Blondie . This fleet of homes on wheels -- which sometimes can grow to 20 or more -- is not located in a trailer court . Instead , it is parked along Riverside Drive just south of Fletcher Drive_in Silver Lake , a place that Smith and others say they heard about from friends as a safe haven from harassment by police . To the dismay of nearby property_owners , some of the campers , who say they have no other place to live , have parked here for as long as six years . &quot; This isn ' t a preferred spot , &quot; explained Stan Carpenter , who unlike many others in the small motor community has been able to occasionally find work fixing cars . &quot; It ' s very noisy and very dirty . We stick_together basically because there is no place else for us to be. &quot; Although they say they feel sorry_for the campers , nearby residents also have bitter complaints and want them removed . &quot; A city street is not a trailer_park , &quot; said homeowner John Ruege . &quot; Get the people off the street and find them jobs. &quot; Ruege and others were so outraged six months ago that they complained to City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg about transients urinating , defecating and littering along the street , accosting passersby for money and intimidating residents . They also blamed residents of the encampment for a rash of car burglaries and graffiti in the neighborhood . The transients say none of those charges are true and ask why they would want to spoil the area where they live , even if it is only a street . Connie Farfan , one of Goldberg ' s aides , said the city could force those in the motor community to leave , but that it would be unfair for the city to harass them unless there is a suitable alternative location for them . Goldberg ' s staff think they have such a solution . They hope a trailer court will be included in a proposal by the mayor ' s office to turn a vacant city_block in the eastern part of Downtown into a homeless drop-in center . If such a trailer_park is established , Farfan said , those along Riverside Drive would have to abandon their current spot . When questioned about that suggestion , Gene Boutilier , who heads the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority , said he likes it . &quot; that ' s a strategy that ought to be part of the mix of alternatives , &quot; he said . &quot; Let ' s work_on it. &quot; In response to the complaints from residents , Goldberg ' s office had garbage_cans put near the campers , established regular trash_pickups , installed a portable toilet and restricted parking to about a one-block area . But property_owners say such actions are only a quick_fix . &quot; I know it ' s part of an effort to clean_up , &quot; Ruege said . &quot; But that ' s also welcoming them . It ' s like telling them it ' s OK to live there . There needs to be a real solution. &quot; Micheal Frances , who helped organize the Riverside Drive Neighbors ' Alliance to deal with the complaints , said that as long as the trailers are_on the street , &quot; it lowers our property values and makes rental very difficult. &quot; Carpenter and others said they do not want to live_on the street , but they do like staying in their portable homes . &quot; It feels more free to be in a motor_home , &quot; Carpenter said . David Hershey-Webb , another Goldberg aide , said , &quot; There are people all_over the city living_in vehicles . Most of these people can ' t pay rent . Most have been evicted . Living_in a van gives them a feeling of security. &quot; The campers unfairly get blamed for everything that goes_wrong in the neighborhood , Carpenter said . He said they try to keep the area clean and call Goldberg ' s office when they see something unusual . &quot; They are our eyes and ears , &quot; Farfan agreed . &quot; They call us about people dumping sewage . They sweep and clean. &quot; During the day , many of the campers drive_around so they can recharge batteries running their televisions and lights . Most don ' t have jobs . None have a telephone and they get their mail from post_office boxes . Only a_few have sinks or refrigerators , so they stock up_on canned_food and items they can heat on their portable stoves . Many have to use the showers at a local swimming_pool or the YMCA . Smith , who counts_on his neighbors to guard his van when he must go_to the hospital , says he does not want to leave a community he has grown to trust . &quot; If I park in a new place I ' ve got_to learn the people , &quot; he said . &quot; If you shave and get a haircut they ' re wary of you . You ' re Mr. Clean. &quot; West , who is now in the hospital , says she has a heart_condition that prevents her from holding_down a regular job . She lives_on a monthly Social_Security check of $ 690 , which she says is not enough for an apartment or house rental , or even a space in a mobile_home or trailer_park . Although property_owners are still pressing for removal of the campers , both Goldberg ' s office and police say they are receiving fewer complaints . &quot; In the last four to five months we haven ' t had more_than three to four calls , &quot; Farfan says . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s as disruptive to the community as a_few people say it is. &quot; &quot; Do you think if somebody is going_to be living somewhere seven days a week , with their license_plates exposed , they would wander off right in their neighborhood and rob somebody ? &quot; Smith asked . The fleet now sits on Riverside Drive with the Golden State Freeway on one side and a steep embankment on the other . It is about one block away from the nearest homes . Before the area where they could park was restricted , the transients would scatter along Riverside from Los Feliz Boulevard to Fletcher . For their part , property_owners want the campers out of their neighborhood . &quot; I really don ' t want them in my back yard , &quot; Ruege said .</TEXT>
