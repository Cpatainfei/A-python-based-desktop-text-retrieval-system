   <TEXT> A metal dragon exhaling orange sparks and a scalding plume of vapor , this vintage steam_locomotive rumbles over the rails , shattering the stillness of India ' s plains at twilight . First Fireman Anil Sharma , a bandanna wrapped around his head to keep_out coal dust , yanks open the firebox . With a_few expert flicks of the shovel , the square-shouldered 26-year-old piles more A-grade Bihar coal onto the flames , then clangs the door shut . The New Delhi-bound train -- made_up of 10 cars , a tender laden with 20 tons of coal and 5 # 000 gallons of water , four crewmen and several hundred passengers -- accelerates . Its trembling speedometer needle shows a bone-shaking 75 kilometers per hour -- 46 m.p.h. -- and the thick steel_plate under foot in the cab vibrates weirdly . In fields greened by the recent arrival of the monsoon rains , naked children taking the day ' s final dip in muddy ponds and drovers coaxing water_buffalo homeward look_up at the sudden approach of the hissing , thundering engine . Many smile and wave . Such scenes on the plains of Uttar Pradesh may seem like the quintessence of Indian life , tableaux virtually frozen since the years of British rule . But their days are numbered . By the end of this year , if the officials who run India ' s railroads implement their plans as scheduled , the bullet-nosed locomotive that makes the 100-mile run west from Moradabad to the country ' s capital will be no more . By 1996 , steam is to be gone from all regular rail service throughout India , to be replaced by diesel or electric traction . The reasons are cold considerations of efficiency and cost , and the decrepit state of many aging steam_locomotives . &quot; You simply can ' t afford to keep an antique in_operation , &quot; says Jasbir Pal Singh , chief mechanical_engineer on the Northern Railway , the largest of India ' s nine regional rail networks . For a vast land where railroads were indispensable in creating an industrial economy , and even the movement for independence and national identity itself , the passing of steam will be the end of an era . In many fields , India is striving to modernize and open itself to the outside world . But many feel the country is losing much of its uniqueness and heritage in the bargain . &quot; A steam_locomotive is like a human monster , &quot; Rajagopalan Gopal , Singh ' s counterpart on the Bombay-based Western Railway , says with evident emotion . &quot; But today , neither the puff is there , nor the fire . Where is the fire of life ? &quot; For more_than 140 years , chugging steam_locomotives have been a ubiquitous feature of the Indian landscape . They rushed British reinforcements to the rebellious Northwest Frontier , brought tea from the Himalayan foothills to ships waiting at Calcutta , and carried untold billions of passengers , many in cattle car-like third-class coaches that no longer exist , others on the roof . In the middle of the last century , Lord Dalhousie , India ' s governor_general , advocated railroads -- they were all steam-powered then , of course -- along with the telegraph and uniform postage , as three &quot; great engines of social improvement &quot; to hasten the modernization of Britain ' s premier colonial possession . On the afternoon of April 16 , 1853 , guns boomed from the ramparts of Bombay ' s fort as three small steam_engines , spouting smoke , rattled_off with 400 passengers on a maiden 21-mile run . The &quot; iron_horse &quot; had come_to India . The Bombay Times gushed that &quot; a sun is rising on the darkened land. &quot; Not everybody rejoiced , however . &quot; Railways accentuate the evil nature of man . Bad men fulfill their evil designs with greater rapidity , &quot; Mohandas K . Gandhi , the &quot; Great Soul &quot; who turned hostile to Western technology , once fulminated . &quot; It may be a debatable matter whether railways spread famine , but it is beyond dispute that they propagate evil. &quot; The apostle of nonviolence never said whether trains might not help propagate good , but no Indian took greater advantage of what is today the world ' s second-largest rail network to spread his views . ( Asked why he always traveled in third_class as he crisscrossed India , Gandhi answered , &quot; Because there is no fourth class. &quot; ) . Steam-powered trains , although enough of an endangered species in this age of supercomputers and interplanetary probes to lure many rail buffs to India , have grown increasingly unpopular with administrators and accountants at the Ministry of Railways . Steam is labor-intensive , they say , and the cost of labor is increasing in India these days . Digging and then transporting coal throughout the nation is also becoming more expensive , and burning it pollutes the environment more_than other fuels now available . &quot; Ultimately , these locos will have to go_into a museum , &quot; concludes Singh , who half-jokingly presents himself as &quot; the man who is killing_off steam &quot; on the Northern Railway . Conscious of the valuable drawing power of steam , railroad officials have modified their original plan and will allow half_a_dozen old engines to remain on routes popular_with foreign and Indian tourists , like the &quot; toy train &quot; that climbs to Darjeeling or the ritzy &quot; Palace on Wheels &quot; in Rajasthan . But for the ordinary Indian passenger , steam will pass into history within the next two years . The process is already well under way . In 1992 and 1993 , 786 steam_locomotives were retired and 38 sheds where they had been based were shut_down . In the same period , the number of electric engines in_service topped steam for the first time . The share of passenger_trains pulled by steam , as high as 15 % a_few years ago , is dropping every day . Such trends cause pangs of regret even among those responsible_for them . In 1944 , when he was 7 , Gopal watched from his home_in Meerut as a crack express , the Frontier Mail , roared by , sending glowing constellations of sparks into the night sky . He dreamed of being at the throttle . Instead , he went_into the mechanical side of railroading . Two summers ago , as chief official in his field on India ' s second-biggest railroad , he phased_out all steam-powered locomotives of the class designated WP -- for wide-gauge / passenger -- and a sister model designed for pulling freight_trains . It left him heartsick . &quot; Is efficiency all we look_for in life ? &quot; asks the mechanical_engineer with the soul of a romantic . &quot; What about beauty ? Or class ? There is something truly beautiful and song-like about a steam_locomotive . In comparison , diesel or electric is dead. &quot; For the average passenger , the demise of steam is probably a welcome thing . After chugging off one recent Saturday in a nimbus of black smoke and steam from Moradabad , and sounding a shrill whistle as cows grazed on the neighboring track , this New Delhi-bound passenger_train took no less than 7 hours , 53 minutes to reach the Gothic-arched station at Delhi Junction only 100 miles away . When it panted to a halt at 1:27 a.m. , Train No . 307 was more_than an hour late . &quot; Steam_locomotives are very unreliable . They have a very high running cost , &quot; groused one passenger , Usman Ali , 18 . &quot; Diesel locos are fast and economical. &quot; In microcosm , the train carried the picturesque universe of humanity that is India . There were three eunuchs dressed as women , and at least as_many Hindu religious ascetics with Christ-like coiffures and some unbiblical aluminum lunch pails . Farmers who had sold their milk that morning in Moradabad slung the empty cans from the bars that run_across the glassless apertures substituting for windows in second_class , and stretched_out on the hard wooden benches to sleep . The doors to the toilets had been torn_off . Inside , holes in the floor opened right onto the tracks . Not a single ceiling fan was working . Vendors plied the filthy aisles , selling peanuts mixed with chopped onions and tomatoes , slices of fresh melon and coconut , hot tea spiked with sugar and milk , spiced lentils and boxed lunches of unleavened_bread and potatoes . There was just one track on several stretches of the route , so passengers piled out at four different station sidings to wait for higher-priority expresses , none pulled by steam , to go_by . ( Those enforced halts , driver Madan Singh later said defensively , were why he arrived_at Delhi so late. ) Rail travel is cheap in India , and a ticket in second_class -- the only class available for the Moradabad-to-Delhi run -- costs just 77 cents . But like passengers almost everywhere , the people riding Train No . 307 complained about service . A farmer worried about what the demise of steam would do to the price and availability of diesel_fuel , which he uses to run irrigation pumps . But it was day_laborer Satpal Singh , 45 , who had the last word . &quot; The trains never run_on time , so it hardly makes a difference whether they run_on steam or electric , &quot; he said philosophically . Many other passengers agreed . The experts , though , say there is a difference and that India ' s steam_locomotives , of which 1 # 725 remained in_service as of March , 1993 , are relatively old and slow . The country hasn ' t manufactured a steam-powered engine since 1972 . &quot; If there is proper maintenance , these locos can run 75 to 80 kilometers per hour ( 46 to 50 m.p.h. ) , &quot; said Niaz Ahmad , an official with the Northern Railway_Locomotive Training_School . &quot; But the maintenance is decaying these days . These are outdated engines. &quot; Steam is also notoriously temperamental . One recent day , Train 307 ' s opposite_number bound for Moradabad from Delhi had to be pulled by diesel when a steam crew bungled and had to drop their coal fire onto the tracks to prevent the boiler from blowing_up . Engine No . 7102 showed its age badly . Its rounded nose was jauntily adorned with the spread white wings that mark a steam_locomotive based in Moradabad . But the rest of it looked aged and shabby . The plates that compose the engine ' s metal skin were pitted , ill-fitting and caked with soot . The whistle stuck . The nameplate in the cab that should have shown the locomotive ' s serial number and age had fallen_off . The crew guessed No . 7102 was around half a century old . It is a humble end facing a machine that for decades had figured among the thoroughbreds of India ' s railroads . Gandhi might not have approved , but the genesis of the WP-class locomotive can be traced to 16 American-made prototypes built and delivered to India by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia in 1947 . By 1970 , when production ceased , 755 had been built . In railroad jargon , the 102-ton locomotive is called a 4-6-2 because of its wheel configuration . The &quot; 6 &quot; means three pairs of driving wheels , which stand more_than five feet high , move the engine and the train . They are linked on both sides by a connecting rod to a large piston , which is shoved back and forth by steam . Such technology , now almost ancient , gives an exhilarating sensation of speed . In the locomotive cab , buffeted by gusts of pungent coal smoke and steam , it feels as if the crew can barely control the awesome power unleashed by the heating of water into vapor . The engine hisses and seethes , like a giant pressure_cooker , and seems ready to burst . As the modernization of India ' s railroads continues , skills that allowed people to earn a living through steam are becoming more and more irrelevant . Sharma , a railroad employee since 1988 , uses his shovel like a precision instrument . He can heave coal evenly throughout the firebox and appears to know intuitively when it ' s time to toss_in more to maintain an even , 12-inch-high layer of burning anthracite . Singh , No . 7102 ' s 43-year-old engineer , or &quot; driver , &quot; as they say in India , has worked with steam so_long that he seems to have organically meshed with his handlebar-shaped regulator handle and reversing wheel . By manipulating those two controls as he stands_by the engine ' s right-hand window , he regulates the flow of steam and motion of the pistons that make the driving wheels speed_up or slow_down . As steam_locomotives are retired , their crewmen are supposed to be provided by Indian Railways with new jobs . Sharma , though , isn ' t confident . Sweat streaming down his bearded face , he says he will likely be transferred to work as an assistant in an electric or diesel_locomotive , but will probably never advance because of quotas that reserve some railroad jobs for people of lower castes . Sharma is a Brahman , a member of Hinduism ' s highest stratum . On impulse , Second Fireman Ghan Shyam Singh grabs a hunk of coal , and sends it spinning into the darkness . The 24-year-old joins his hands together in a sign of reverence . He has given the sacred river some coal as an offering , he says , because he isn ' t carrying any coins .</TEXT>
