   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : THE AGRICULTURAL HERITAGE ; LA PALMA ; PROGRESS PUT DAIRY_COWS OUT TO PASTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Signs of this city ' s agricultural heritage have vanished in the 40 years since a group of dairy_farmers incorporated the community under the name Dairyland . The last of the dairy_farms that once dominated this community disappeared years ago -- replaced by tract houses . In 1965 , city leaders even changed its name from Dairyland to La Palma . For the first_half of the century , La Palma and surrounding communities made_up a vast cow-grazing area that stretched from Cerritos to Cypress . As suburban growth began to encroach the area , dairy_farmers organized to preserve the town ' s farmland , said Pamela Gibson , La Palma ' s city_manager . The farmers won cityhood for Dairyland in 1955 and attempted in vain to hold_off residential development . For a while , the city required property sites to be at least five acres , according to the book &quot; A Hundred Years of Yesterdays. &quot; But state tax laws favored residential development over farming , and slowly , the dairies gave_way to housing tracts . As more residents moved to the city , the remaining farms were viewed by some to be more of an irritation than a treasure -- especially during the summer , when the cows smelled bad and attracted flies . Gibson said one La Palma council candidate even distributed fly-swatters that bore the phrase : &quot; Vote for me and you won ' t have to use one of these anymore. &quot; By 1973 , just one dairy_farm remained in the city , according to the book .
