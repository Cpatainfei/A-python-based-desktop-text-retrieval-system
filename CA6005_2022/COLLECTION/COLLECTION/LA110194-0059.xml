   <HEADLINE> EUROPE : FIVE YEARS LATER ; ' WE can ' t AFFORD THIS STUPIDITY ANYMORE. ' ; FRIEDRICH SCHORLEMMER , EASTERN GERMAN CLERGYMAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> H e was a father of the East_German revolution , but Pastor Friedrich Schorlemmer is saddened by much of what has come of the fall of East_Germany , and Germany ' s subsequent unification . &quot; I have the impression that the West is treating the former German Democratic Republic as if they were_on a hunting party and we were a lame deer , &quot; he said , interviewed by Times correspondent Mary Williams Walsh in the compartment of a train traveling from the eastern state_capital of Magdeburg to the western city of Cologne . &quot; They have already killed us , and now they ' re going to take the very best pieces for themselves. &quot; His is a hard view , and yet Schorlemmer had never intended that the fall of the Berlin Wall should lead to the dissolution of East_Germany and unification with the West . Like many other East_German intellectuals and reform agitators in 1989 , he had merely sought a recasting of the East_German state . When he appeared at the microphone in the huge demonstrations of November , 1989 , he quoted Martin_Luther and urged nonviolent resistance to Communist authority : &quot; Let the spirits clash together , but not the fists , &quot; he said : * Question . What , exactly , were you trying to achieve in 1988 , when you promulgated your 20 Wittenberg Theses ? Answer . The main goal was to do whatever I could to ensure that the final document of the Helsinki Accord ( the charter of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , signed_in 1975 ) , which East_Germany had signed , would be fulfilled , particularly its provisions on culture , communication and human_rights . If this were to happen , then East_Germany would have to become a state where people would be happy to live , where work would be meaningful , where people could participate in public decision-making processes and where the state would n ' t make all_the decisions for everybody . This meant that there had to be free elections . Second , I wanted the detente and the arms reduction that was going_on in the outside world to take_place within East_Germany . I wanted East_Germany to stop madly categorizing every country in the world as good or evil , friend or foe . I wanted ours to become a society capable of peace , a society that could survive without organizing itself around an enemy . That is , a society that could negotiate with its internal critics and not clap everybody who suggested there might be some problems into prison . East_Germany thought that by banning seismographs , it could prevent earthquakes . * Q . Instead , East_Germany has disappeared . What made the quiet revolution in East_Germany turn_out the way it has ? A . The problem with the revolution of 1989 was the following : The people who were calling_for change , until November , 1989 , wanted a democratic revolution . Then , when the Berlin Wall was broken through , the participants in the demonstrations , and also the leaders , changed . The revolution was detoured toward German unification . Money was a big part of the game , even though everybody was talking only about the ideal of German unity . If someone says , &quot; Here is unity , &quot; and unity means you get_to have the deutsche_mark , then everyone will say , &quot; I am for German unity. &quot; * Q . What sort of attitudes toward the former East and toward unification do you encounter on your travels in western Germany ? Will the former West ever understand eastern Germans ? A . Forty-five years of separation have caused a tremendous mental gap between eastern and western Europe . In addition , there is the equally large economic gap . These divisions will be with us for another generation . The majority of west German citizens consider the fall of the Berlin Wall to be nothing more_than an irritating accident . Because now , the poor , poor citizens of the Federal_Republic_of_Germany are being asked to pay ( for the reconstruction of the former East ) . And , the east_Germans take the money , and then have the ingratitude to turn_around and vote for the Party of Democratic Socialism ( the former East_German Communist_Party ) . But one shouldn ' t forget to mention that there have been a considerable number of ( western ) people who are truly delighted , and who have been willing to make a sacrifice for East_Germany . * Q . What else has surprised you about the way the events of 1989 have turned_out ? A . The problems of converting the military infrastructure to peaceful purposes are so_much larger than I ever imagined . The two superpowers , and their allies , were able , with conventional and nuclear_weapons , to fight each other and destroy everything on Earth 50 times over . So one can see that it ' s very hard to come_up with answers to questions like : What will we do with all these weapons ? What will we do with the weapons factories ? What will we do with the workers there , in America as well as in Czechoslovakia ? What do we do with the gigantic armies ? How should we motivate them , the sailors in Murmansk ( Russia ) with their submarines , for instance , to come ashore ? They don ' t know whom they ' re doing_it for . This lack of a clear role for the ( post-Cold War ) military is a dangerous thing . * Q . What happens next in the process of bringing Eastern and Western Europe together ? A . I anticipate an authoritarian solution to Russia ' s problems in the near future . This could come from the military , or from somebody else . In any case , the enormous economic and social problems in Russia are not enhancing democratic development in the former East . I can ' t see that democracy in Russia is stable . But the gigantic military potential in weapons , and in human resources , is still present . I consider the present situation more dangerous than the one in 1983 , at the height of the nuclear confrontation . * Q . And in Germany ? A . The majority is stupid . In the old ( East_German ) days , I didn ' t dare say that , because I would have been called arrogant , but it ' s the truth . We can ' t afford this stupidity anymore . The saying goes , &quot; One learns by making mistakes , &quot; but we can no longer afford to make these costly mistakes . Somebody has to say this . I admit it : I am an extremist , a left-Green extremist . But the people who write me off as an extremist are rushing at full speed toward a global catastrophe . If the West doesn ' t change , the world will break_apart . The West has to change . The East failed first , because its inefficiencies showed first . But the West will follow .</TEXT>
