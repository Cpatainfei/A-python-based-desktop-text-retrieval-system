   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL SCREENING : PARADISE FOUND IN UCI ' S POTPOURRI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Following &quot; Angel Heart , &quot; the bloody horror-mystery that launched UC Irvine ' s fall film series last week , with &quot; Cinema Paradiso , &quot; the gentle Oscar-winner screening Friday night , is like following a scream with a whisper . While Alan Parker ' s messy but often fascinating &quot; Angel Heart &quot; is all about rude provocation , Giuseppe Tornatore ' s &quot; Cinema Paradiso &quot; is all about the tenderest of provocations . It ' s as if the organizers of UCI ' s &quot; Cinema Potpourri &quot; series wanted to first rile the nerves , then calm them back_down . Winner for best foreign-language film for 1990 , Tornatore ' s movie can feel_like a sedative . There ' s so_much reaching for soothing epiphanies in the story of Alfredo , the bearlike projectionist in an ancient Sicilian movie_theater , and Salvatore , his young friend and later apprentice , that you get drowsy after a while . Sentiment is &quot; Cinema Paradiso ' s &quot; reason for being , and Tornatore never strays from providing it . But within their small tale , which draws_in , however tangentially , several others in the fishing village where they live , there ' s also meat for dedicated movie lovers . As we watch the relationship develop between Alfredo and Salvatore , nicknamed Toto , we also watch their excitement over the pictures_shown in the Cinema Paradiso , a worn-out but still elegant theater . Passages from Renoir ' s social-realist classic &quot; The Lower Depths &quot; mingle with those featuring Chaplin , Errol Flynn , Greta Garbo and dozens of others from filmdom ' s Golden Age . The weekly screenings are the town ' s highlight , bringing_in everybody within miles . The upper_classes sit in the balcony , even spitting at the noisy crowd of blue-collar workers , fishermen and prostitutes below . But the pictures unite them , as they unite Toto and Alfredo . Tornatore ' s message about the shared experience of art , especially popular art , is distractingly obvious but joyous nonetheless . &quot; Cinema Paradiso &quot; is a movie easy to forgive , simply because it ' s so pleasurable . Tornatore also wins us over through the details . The opening sequence , in which we ' re introduced to Alfredo ( played with a bellowing goodness by Philippe Noiret ) and Toto ( Salvatore Cascio ) , shows the local priest gasping at the kissing scenes in &quot; The Lower Depths. &quot; With a violent ring of his bell , he signals Alfredo which passages to edit_out . Later , a man screams during the butchered movie that he ' s never once seen a kiss on screen , sending the audience into a fit over the censorious nature of the Catholic_Church . Still later , that first passage echoes in the final , remarkably effective epiphany as Toto , now well into middle-age and a successful TV director with doubts about his emotional resources , has to face what he ' s become as a man . * What : Giuseppe Tornatore ' s &quot; Cinema Paradiso. &quot; * When : Friday , Oct . 7 , at 7 and 9:30 p.m. * Where : The UC Irvine Student_Center Crystal Cove Auditorium . * Whereabouts : Take the San Diego ( 405 ) Freeway to Jamboree Road and head south to Campus Drive and take a left .
