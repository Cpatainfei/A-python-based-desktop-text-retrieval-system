   <HEADLINE> U.S. SENATE ; CONTROVERSY OVER HIRING OF IMMIGRANT ; HUFFINGTON CLAIMS HE HAS INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED THAT FEINSTEIN USED AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT AS A HOUSEKEEPER IN THE EARLY 1980S . INS OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE NO PROOF OF SUCH ACTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new controversy over illegal immigration engulfed the U.S. Senate_race Thursday as GOP candidate Mike Huffington seized_on a disputed and unverified news_report claiming that Sen . Dianne Feinstein hired an illegal immigrant as a housekeeper in the early 1980s . By late Thursday , the striking San Francisco newspaper reporters responsible_for the initial story said they were revising it because they had received incomplete information from the Immigration and Naturalization Service . INS officials also said they had no proof that Feinstein had employed an illegal immigrant and were rechecking their records . But Huffington ' s campaign , which has been battered by his admission that he employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny until last year , said it had independently verified the report . The campaign immediately began airing a 30-second television commercial accusing Feinstein of lying . At least two of the contentions in the ad were apparently untrue . In a crowded news_conference in San Francisco , Feinstein told reporters that she had employed a Guatemalan woman , but the woman had provided documentation showing that she was in the country legally . Feinstein pointed_out that in any case , the woman worked for her years before a 1986 federal law made the employment of illegal immigrants a crime . Asked if she believes the woman was in the country illegally , Feinstein told reporters : &quot; No , and I don ' t believe she was . . . based on documentation that I saw when she came_in . . . . I was a new mayor . I was not going_to hire someone who was here illegally . She presented work documentation to me and I hired her. &quot; Throughout the day there was continuing uncertainty about the housekeeper ' s legal_status , with Feinstein saying she was legally in the country and Republican challenger Huffington insisting otherwise . The first report about the housekeeper was prepared Thursday morning by striking San Francisco newspaper reporters and sent_out over the Internet computer_network . But by the end of the day , Pamela Burdman , one of the two striking San Francisco Chronicle reporters who wrote the story , said the paper was revising the story for a strike edition &quot; based on the fact that we now know the information from the INS is incomplete. &quot; In a Century City news_conference earlier , Huffington accused Feinstein of deception and an attempted cover-up . &quot; She is a liar . And she is a hypocrite . And she has purposefully and blatantly attempted to mislead you and the people of California . She is unworthy to serve in the United States Senate , &quot; Huffington told reporters . The day ' s furor erupted one week after the Santa Barbara congressman acknowledged that he and his wife had hired an illegal immigrant as a nanny for more_than four years , beginning in 1989 -- well after federal immigration law made such hiring a crime . At his conference Thursday , Huffington refused to concede that he broke the law and Feinstein did not . &quot; There may have been different laws . You will have to have lawyers look_at that . . . . She may well have ( broken the law ) but you ' ll have to ask your lawyers. &quot; Asked_in another way , he suggested that reporters are working_on Feinstein ' s behalf . &quot; I already had my discussion . I am talking_about Mrs . Feinstein . . . I have talked_about my case . I want to talk_about her lying and I think it ' s about time you print it , unless you are part of her campaign also. &quot; Late Thursday , Huffington campaign officials insisted that their account was accurate . They said the woman who worked with Feinstein provided them with her immigration case number and that a source in the INS matched it to the record of an amnesty applicant who was in the country illegally in 1981 and 1982 . The Huffington television ad said the INS had confirmed that the woman was an illegal immigrant ; it also said that the Associated Press had proven Feinstein lied . INS officials late Thursday said they could make no such confirmation and AP challenged the accuracy of the ad . &quot; No AP story has said Feinstein lied_about this , let alone proved that she lied , &quot; said AP ' s San Francisco bureau chief Dan Day . &quot; I have sent the Huffington campaign a fax pointing_out that we take_issue with their description of our reporting. &quot; Huffington ' s campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Grossman said : &quot; We are standing_by the ad . Mrs . Feinstein lied . Everyone knows she lied. &quot; But Feinstein ' s campaign manager said the ad should be withdrawn . &quot; I think the Huffington campaign should pull their ad and wait until this is all sorted_out , &quot; he said . Feinstein on Thursday drove_home the distinctions between Huffington ' s action and her own . Most notably , she said , she hired the woman only after asking_for documentation and employed the woman years before the federal law was enacted . Unlike Huffington , Feinstein opposes Proposition 187 , the ballot measure that would deny health and education services to illegal immigrants . The political impact of Thursday ' s events was unclear . &quot; I think , from what I understand , it is does not appear to be the smoking gun . On the other hand , to the extent that Huffington can obfuscate the issue -- as he has done with some success in terms of wealth and campaign spending and residency -- it is . . . helpful &quot; to Huffington , said Arnold Steinberg , a GOP consultant not associated with the Senate_campaign . Huffington ' s accusations consumed Feinstein ' s day of campaigning . She had scheduled a series of news_conferences with women ' s groups and abortion rights advocates . In a teleconference with reporters , senior campaign strategists Ed Rollins and Ken Khachigian not only called Feinstein a hypocrite , but suggested that federal agencies were attempting to protect her by withholding information . &quot; Worse than her lies , worse than her hypocrisy is the disturbing appearance that her campaign may have actively tried to mislead you and the voters by attempting to cover_up this story , &quot; said Khachigian . But federal_officials said there was no effort to keep information from the Huffington campaign . Late Thursday , Ron Rogers , an INS spokesman at the regional office in Laguna Niguel , said there was confusion over whether the woman in_question actually was here illegally . &quot; I can ' t confirm the status of the person in_question , &quot; said Rogers . &quot; What happened is that a similar name was given , and the INS ran a check on a person with a name similar in nature. &quot; Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata said the Guatemalan woman worked for Feinstein from 1980 to 1982 as a housekeeper while Feinstein was mayor of San Francisco . Although the law did not require it , Feinstein asked the woman to show her documentation of a work_permit and the woman complied , Kuwata said . Kuwata said Feinstein did not learn that her housekeeper had immigration problems until after the woman was no longer working for her . By 1983 , however , the mayor knew there was a problem because sometime between 1982 and 1983 , the housekeeper had returned to Guatemala and was unable to re-enter the United States . Feinstein and her husband arranged for the housekeeper ' s son , Josue , who was a U.S. citizen , to come from Guatemala and live_in their household so he could continue his schooling . A 1984 profile of Feinstein in the San Francisco Examiner reported this : &quot; Without any publicity , the couple opened their home last year to 9-year-old Josue Paiz , the son of their former Guatemalan housekeeper , who was stuck_in her native country with immigration problems . Feinstein said they sent_for Josue so that he could continue in school . ' She loves him like her own , ' says daughter Kathy. &quot; While the former housekeeper was stuck_in Guatemala , Feinstein wrote a letter on her behalf to authorities , Kuwata said . He said he did not know what the letter said , or to whom the mayor sent it . Kuwata said Feinstein paid all applicable taxes and Social_Security for the housekeeper . Earlier , John Nelson , who has been conducting research on Feinstein for the Huffington campaign , said without confirmation of the former housekeeper ' s status from INS , he could not prove she was an illegal employee . &quot; that ' s all speculation , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t know for_sure she was working illegally. &quot; Nelson said the Huffington campaign had received a number of tips_in the past week from people who knew that at one point Feinstein had a Latina housekeeper and that later the mayor was taking_care of her son . But the Huffington campaign could not produce anyone who could say for_sure that the woman did not have legal_status at the time she worked for Feinstein . One of the callers was Tony Hipchen , who painted houses for Feinstein in the early 1980s . He said that in 1983 or 1984 he noticed &quot; she had this little boy who appeared to be Mexican being chauffeur driven by the mayor ' s limo to school. &quot; At the time , he said , Feinstein explained to him that the boy was the son of her former housekeeper , that the housekeeper had gone_back to Guatemala because of a death in the family and that she could not get_back into the United States . Hipchen said he assumed the housekeeper had been illegally employed before her return to Guatemala , but said he had no proof . He also said Feinstein ' s subsequent housekeeper , Shirley , &quot; pretty much &quot; told him that the previous worker was illegal .</TEXT>
