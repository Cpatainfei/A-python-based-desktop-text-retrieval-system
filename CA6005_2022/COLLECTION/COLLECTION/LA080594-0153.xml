   <HEADLINE> EL TORO IS DEEMED BEST OF 5 MILITARY SITES FOR AIRPORT ; STUDY : REPORT BACKS FAA FINDINGS , WHICH IDENTIFIED THE BASE AS A VIABLE COMMERCIAL FACILITY THAT WOULD HAVE MINIMAL IMPACT ON JOHN WAYNE ' S PASSENGER BASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station is the best existing site in Southern California for a new commercial airport of five area military bases scheduled to close , but would take little burden off John Wayne Airport if both existed , according to a study released Thursday . The Southern California Assn . of Governments concluded that &quot; El Toro easily works best as a commercial airport of all_the military bases &quot; but John Wayne Airport would still bear the brunt of the demand in the county . In addition to El Toro , the study also looked_at potential airports at Point Mugu Naval Weapons Station in Oxnard , March Air_Force Base in Riverside County and George Air_Force Base in San Bernardino County and Norton Air_Force Base , now called San Bernardino International Airport . Besides the increased passenger travel , an airport at El Toro would bolster Orange County ' s economy by serving as an air cargo facility , the report said . Although 28 % of Southern California ' s air cargo originates_in Orange County , &quot; very little of that amount &quot; can be handled at John Wayne Airport , the report said . Most cargo is shipped through Los Angeles International Airport , but Orange County businesses are forced to deal with early cutoff time for overnight deliveries because of congested freeways . The new study confirms findings of a 1993 report funded by the Federal Aviation Administration , which identified the El Toro base as a &quot; very viable commercial airport &quot; that would have minimal impact on John Wayne Airport ' s passenger base . However , SCAG excluded the FAA ' s findings from a report the regional planning agency released last year that only addressed the impact that the closures of Norton Air_Force Base and March Air_Force Base would have_on existing regional airports such_as John Wayne . The decision to exclude those findings caused a firestorm of controversy from those who accused SCAG of playing politics with the report . The updated results released Friday , however , did not faze opponents of an El Toro airport . &quot; Surprise . Surprise . We ' ve got_to give SCAG credit . At least they ' re consistent , &quot; said Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph , who opposes a civilian airport at El Toro . Earlier this week , the Lake Forest City_Council announced it will sue to remove an initiative from the November ballot that calls_for a commercial airport at El Toro . City officials said the measure is inconsistent with the Orange County General Plan , the blueprint for how the county should be developed . The SCAG study released Thursday said an airport at El Toro would attract 6.2 million passengers annually by 2010 . But the study also estimated that John Wayne would serve 8.4 million passengers annually at_the_same_time , which is the maximum amount that airport could handle . &quot; John Wayne is_better suited to attract demand , since it can serve both central and north Orange County , while El Toro would serve primarily south Orange County , &quot; the report said . However , the SCAG study also said that both El Toro and John Wayne would still lose &quot; a substantial number &quot; of passengers who live_in northern Orange County to Ontario Airport because it is easier to get_to that facility . Lonnie Mitchell , spokeswoman for Long_Beach Airport , said Long_Beach will also be competing for passengers from north Orange County and south Los Angeles County in the future . The SCAG report did not address the impact that Long_Beach Airport could have_on both El Toro and John Wayne in the competition for air passengers . The report estimated that Long_Beach would serve about 1.4 million passengers annually by 2010 . Alaska , America West and Sun Jet airlines currently fly out of Long_Beach Airport . &quot; North Orange County and south Los Angeles County are definitely markets that we want to go_after , &quot; Mitchell said . &quot; Our biggest selling feature is our convenience and close-in parking . It looks_like we ' re going to fit nicely into a low-cost niche that ' s attractive to air travelers. &quot; Nevertheless , Partnership 2010 President Tim Cooley said he was encouraged by the recent SCAG report . The Orange County group is privately funded and develops economic plans for local businesses . It supports a commercial airport at El Toro . &quot; An airport at El Toro would give a good jump-start to our local economy and take it into the next century , &quot; Cooley said . &quot; A 1992 study done for the Los Angeles Department of Airports showed that each ton of air cargo is worth $ 10 # 000 to the local economy and each passenger is worth $ 500. &quot; Rudolph said she was not impressed by arguments from proponents who said a commercial airport at El Toro is necessary for Orange County ' s 21st-Century economy . &quot; This entire report was done with 20th-Century thinking , &quot; Rudolph said . &quot; There is nothing in it that addresses 21st-Century needs for Orange County. &quot;</TEXT>
