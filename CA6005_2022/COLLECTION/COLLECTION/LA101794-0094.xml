   <HEADLINE> GANGSTA RAP : DID LYRICS INSPIRE KILLING OF POLICE ? ; POP_MUSIC : TWO TEENS AWAITING TRIAL IN MILWAUKEE SAY TUPAC SHAKUR ' S ANGRY LYRICS INFLUENCED THEM IN THE SLAYING OF AN OFFICER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The debate over the social impact of gangsta rap_music moves to a Milwaukee courtroom Wednesday , when two Wisconsin minors will be charged with murder in the country ' s second case of rap allegedly inspiring the killing of a police_officer . The case involves two teens who told authorities they plotted a Sept . 7 sniper attack on a police_van &quot; because of a Tupac Shakur record that talks_about killing the police. &quot; The assault resulted in the shooting death of 31-year-old Milwaukee Police_Officer William A . Robertson . The 17-year-old defendants , Curtis Lee Walker and Denziss Jackson , will be tried as adults in a case that is expected to reach trial before the end of the year . They have been held without bail at the Milwaukee County Children ' s Court Center since their arrest and were unavailable for comment . Assistant Dist . Atty . Mark Williams declined comment on the case , but sources in the Milwaukee County Homicide Unit said Shakur ' s violence-laced rap_music will play a pivotal role in the prosecution ' s attempt to establish a motive for the first-degree &quot; intentional &quot; homicide . Walker , the alleged trigger man , told the police that Shakur ' s angry lyrics on South Central Cartel ' s album &quot; ' N Gatz We Truss &quot; &quot; geeked him up &quot; to stalk the officer , according to his court-appointed attorney Ann T . Bowe . &quot; The violent anti-police lyrics appear to have acted_as command hallucinations which influenced his behavior , &quot; said Bowe , whose client has a six-year history of drug , burglary and weapons offenses . &quot; This young_man insists that certain passages in these songs are so_much a part of his consciousness that it was as if they just kept playing over and over in his head that night. &quot; According to court records , Walker told police he hid in a vacant field for 40 minutes with a loaded weapon waiting for a police vehicle to pass_by . After receiving a signal from Jackson that a police vehicle was approaching , Walker traced the movement of the police_van in the scope of his . 308 rifle and then fired a single shot . The bullet ripped through the rear of the van and struck Robertson , who died minutes before reaching the hospital . The two youths were arrested after a 30-hour sweep of the neighborhood . This is the second criminal case in which Shakur ' s music has been blamed for inciting the murder of an officer -- and it will most certainly renew criticism of the record industry and rekindle the free-speech debate over violent lyrics . Last year , an Austin jury rejected a similar defense proposed by Ronald Ray Howard , a 19-year-old car thief who has been sentenced to die for the slaying of a Texas state_trooper . Howard had claimed that &quot; cop-killing &quot; songs on Shakur ' s &quot; 2PACALYPSE NOW &quot; album influenced his actions . * While that case remains on appeal , a multimillion-dollar civil suit filed by the Texas trooper ' s widow against Shakur and his Interscope Records , a Time Warner subsidiary , is scheduled to go_to trial in October , 1995 . The suit charges that the label and the rap artist were &quot; grossly negligent &quot; in manufacturing and distributing music that incited &quot; imminent lawless action. &quot; In the Milwaukee case , the officer ' s widow , who is pregnant with twins , could not be reached for comment . Police sources said she has not indicated whether she intends to file a civil suit . This is the latest legal controversy surrounding Shakur , 23 , who was convicted in L.A. seven months ago of battery and possessing a loaded and concealed firearm . Last week , Atlanta prosecutors dropped aggravated assault charges against Shakur , dismissing a case that stemmed from a 1993 incident in which Shakur exchanged gunfire with two off-duty police_officers . He will stand trial next month in New York for allegedly holding a woman down while his friends sodomized her . On Sept . 3 , police blamed Shakur for a disturbance that broke_out at a Milwaukee rap festival when one of his security_guards allegedly brandished a gun and frightened concert-goers during his performance . Murder defendants Walker and Jackson have told authorities they began plotting to kill a police_officer after Shakur ' s concert in Milwaukee -- just days before the homicide occurred . Shakur could not be reached for comment , but his attorney , Chokwe Lumumba , characterized the accusations as &quot; ridiculous. &quot; * &quot; Tupac is an artist , and his work is social commentary , &quot; Lumumba said . &quot; It ' s unfortunate when anybody is killed , but Tupac has never told anybody to shoot a policeman . It ' s true that he raps about problems with the police , but those problems existed long before he was even born. &quot; A growing number of black church leaders , feminists and politicians have recently begun to call_for the government to ban the sale of gangsta rap to minors . Dr. C . DeLores Tucker , chair of the Washington-based Political Congress of Black_Women -- who encouraged African American lawmakers to convene anti-gangsta rap hearings on Capitol_Hill this year -- said she hoped Robertson ' s slaying would serve as a warning to the record industry . &quot; This case confirms what many of us have long been saying : that gangsta rap encourages vulnerable youngsters to commit horrible acts of violence , &quot; Tucker said . &quot; Gangsta rap may_not be the root cause of the violence , but it ' s dangerous because it encourages young people to try to heal their pain in violent ways. &quot;</TEXT>
