   <HEADLINE> STATE VULNERABLE TO OIL SPILLS , GROUP SAYS ; ENVIRONMENT : REPORT RELEASED ON THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EXXON VALDEZ DISASTER SAYS OLD TANKERS AND POOR MONITORING RAISE THE THREAT OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite a bundle of tough laws passed after Alaska ' s devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill , the coast of California remains vulnerable to a similar catastrophe , a national environmental group charged Thursday . In a report released on the fifth anniversary of the Valdez disaster , the Center for Marine Conservation says California has been lucky to avoid a major spill so far . The report cited problems posed by an aging tanker fleet , shrinking crew size and poor offshore monitoring by the U.S. Coast Guard . &quot; Playing Russian roulette is stupid , and doing_it with oil_tankers is lunacy , &quot; said Warren Chabot , Pacific region director of the Washington-based center . &quot; There are ways to reduce the risks . The time to take action is now. &quot; The center ' s study focused_on a 225-mile section of coast from San Simeon north to Bodega Bay . That stretch includes three national marine sanctuaries , areas set_aside because of their biological richness . Although the sanctuaries enjoy federal protection from offshore oil drilling , they remain endangered by tanker spills , the report said . Each year , nearly 3 # 000 vessels carrying millions of barrels of crude_oil pass_through the sanctuaries en route to San Francisco and Southern California . Except on approach to ports , the massive tankers are free to navigate along any route they choose , with virtually no monitoring by the Coast Guard , the report said . Although the Valdez accident spurred improvements in the state ' s ability to clean_up oil spills , measures to prevent them are lacking , the center warned . To make oil shipping off California safer , the report recommends : * Creating a 50-mile , tanker-free buffer zone around the marine sanctuaries . The zone would reduce the risk of a tanker running_aground and , in the event of an accident , would give emergency crews time to reach a disabled ship before the oil drifted ashore . If a spill occurred , the 50-mile distance would give oil more time to disperse before reaching beaches . * Establishing a radar system -- similar to air traffic_control -- to track tankers offshore . Already in_use in Alaska ' s Prince William Sound , the system would require tankers to carry beacons announcing their location and identity to the Coast Guard . * Stationing an emergency offshore response vessel -- one capable of towing disabled tankers -- in San Francisco Bay . * Increasing aerial surveillance of oil vessels by Coast Guard planes . Because of state laws passed after the Valdez disaster and a 1990 spill off Huntington Beach , oil_companies have spill prevention and response plans and contribute to a fund used to clean_up spills of mysterious origins . Coast Guard officials said these changes , among others , have reduced the odds of a catastrophic spill in California . &quot; Our feeling is we ' ve made a lot of progress since the Valdez , &quot; said Lt . Kristin Barlow , a Coast Guard spokeswoman . &quot; There is always more you can do on environmental protection , but we ' re moving_in the right direction. &quot; Oil_industry representatives declined to comment on specifics in the report , which they had not read , but defended their shipping practices . They noted that under an agreement enacted by nine major oil_companies last year , tankers traveling_to California from Alaska -- the source of nearly all_the crude_oil coming_to the state -- remain a minimum of 50 miles offshore except on approach to port . &quot; Our folks operate vessels in a way that they feel is safe , &quot; said Robert Getts , assistant executive_director of the Western States Petroleum Assn . &quot; Remember , the last thing our member companies want is an oil spill . To them , a spill is terribly costly . . . not only in dollars and cents but in public reaction and outcry. &quot; The Exxon Valdez supertanker ran_aground March 24 , 1989 , spilling 11 million gallons of crude_oil that killed hundreds of thousands of animals in Prince William Sound , an Alaskan inlet . The center said it was releasing its report now because the Coast Guard has failed to produce two studies on tanker traffic that were mandated by the Oil Pollution Act , passed shortly after the Valdez spill . Coast Guard officials said the studies are under way , but could not give an estimated date for their completion . &quot; Our coast can ' t wait , &quot; said Marci Glazer , co-author of the report . &quot; Since the Exxon Valdez , at least seven fully laden tankers have lost power or steering in Prince William Sound . Those same tankers have been in San Francisco Bay 48 times in one year. &quot;</TEXT>
