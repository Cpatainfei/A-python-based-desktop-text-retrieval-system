   <HEADLINE> REFORMING A WAYWARD INITIATIVE PROCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A week ago today we made our case that California ' s initiative process , while it empowers citizens , is extremely flawed and is in urgent need of reform . Today we spell_out the details of a reform we like . It ' s in the shape of a future ballot initiative that addresses reform of the initiative law itself , and it may be presented to the voters as soon as 1996 if legislation sponsored by Assemblyman Jim Costa ( D-Fresno ) is successful . The Costa reform , which incorporates recommendations contained in the very valuable work of the Citizens ' Commission on Ballot Initiatives , attempts to make lawmaking by the Legislature and by initiative a new kind of cooperative process , rather than an adversarial one . Proposed are a variety of changes , including several that affect financial disclosure and improve presentation of competing initiatives in the ballot pamphlet . When several such measures appear on the ballot at once , as happened with the controversial automobile_insurance initiatives of 1990 , this part of the reform could help the beleaguered voter wade through it all with greater ease . Here are the other key changes : One would permit initiative proponents to correct drafting errors in an initiative even after it had qualified , so_long as the corrections were consistent with the initiative ' s intent . Another would encourage the Legislature to cooperate with the proponents of an initiative by meeting with them and , wherever possible , quickly passing laws that achieved the same purpose , thus obviating the need for yet another statewide ballot measure . A third would permit initiative proponents , under such circumstances , to withdraw an initiative . And the fourth would permit the Legislature to modify an approved initiative through a two-thirds vote , so_long as , again , the modification was consistent with the initiative ' s original intent . The aim of Costa ' s reform is to spur the Legislature to take actions the voters want . Now , no matter how poorly written or unwieldy an initiative is , once the measure is qualified for the ballot it cannot be corrected or modified . The voters often vote for , in_effect , &quot; the bottom_line &quot; as they did when they overwhelmingly supported Proposition 13 . Voters wanted lower property_taxes , period . Problem was , that law was and remains unfair to anyone who purchased property after 1975 . It would have been good if that flaw could have been corrected . But the current laws don ' t provide any flexibility . Once an initiative has qualified , its words are in stone . Unless , of course , you can come_up with yet another initiative to fix the one already passed . There ' s got_to be a better way . The proposal by Costa is a start . Voters want their voices heard through the initiative process . But if there ' s a way for them to be heard without cluttering the ballot with incomprehensible measures , so_much the better . The proposals of the Citizens ' Commission on Ballot Initiatives and of Costa are extraordinarily valuable and should be pursued .</TEXT>
