   <HEADLINE> WAVES SPAWNED BY QUAKE KILL 171 INDONESIA VILLAGERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Twenty- foot waves caused by a strong earthquake crashed ashore on sleeping coastal villages on Indonesia ' s main island of Java early Friday . At least 171 people were killed . More_than 400 people were injured and 43 were reported missing , said a meteorological official , Johannes Tasar . At least 413 houses and 245 fishing_boats were swallowed by the raging waters in eastern Java , he said . The pre-dawn quake caused no casualties or heavy damage . But the seismic sea waves that followed about an hour later roared a third of a mile inland , sweeping away homes and the people sleeping inside . Pesanngerahan , a poor fishing community , was hit hardest . &quot; It all started with the rising high_tide -- this is normal , &quot; said Slamet , a fisherman who , like most Indonesians , uses only one name . &quot; Then the waters began to reach their homes , and before they could realize something was wrong , the looming , rising waters swept them away , &quot; he said . Joko , a teen-ager from the same village who managed to escape to high ground , said he watched the waters wash_away his home and his neighbors ' homes . His baby sister was killed . &quot; My mother was calling_for help , &quot; he said . &quot; Then I realized something was wrong . My father and mother did not have time to save my baby sister because the waters were suddenly rising very fast in our home. &quot; The tidal_waves struck a scenically beautiful corner of Java , separated by a strait from the resort island of Bali . A group of foreign tourists visiting from Bali for surfing and water-skiing narrowly escaped as a tidal_wave missed their beach huts at Plengkung , police said . It was not immediately clear whether the waves also hit the west coast of Bali . Most of the tourist resorts are in the south and north of the island . Java is located in the center of the Indonesian archipelago , an area that has been hit repeatedly by earthquakes . In February , a quake on Sumatra , a major island northwest of Java , killed at least 217 people . In December , 1992 , an earthquake with a surface-wave magnitude of 7.5 killed at least 2 # 500 people and destroyed thousands of buildings on Flores island , 950 miles southeast of Jakarta . Friday ' s quake had a surface-wave magnitude of 7.2 , according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden , Colo . Surface-wave magnitude is based on an analysis of seismic waves that travel_along the Earth ' s surface . The quake was centered 18 miles beneath the Indian_Ocean , 140 miles south of the eastern Java city of Malang and 577 miles southeast of Jakarta , officials said .</TEXT>
