   <HEADLINE> DANA POINT VOTE BINDS CITY TO HEADLANDS PLAN ; DEVELOPMENT : LANDOWNERS WIN RIGHT TO BUILD $ 500-MILLION HOTEL AND 370 HOMES ON PRIME COASTAL PARCEL . APPROVAL COMES OVER ENVIRONMENTALISTS ' PROTEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A contract that binds the city for at least a decade to plans for a $ 500-million hotel and 370 homes on the Headlands peninsula near Dana Point Harbor was approved Tuesday by the City_Council . The council voted 4-1 to adopt the 73-page development agreement giving the landowners the right to build the homes and a 400-room hotel on 121 acres of prime oceanfront land , one of the last undeveloped coastal properties in Orange County . The agreement , which has been renegotiated over the past two weeks , is a document that legally secures the plan the council approved on April 5 , despite the protests of several environmental groups that want to save the property as a natural_resource . The council majority has for months insisted that not only does the landowner have the right to develop its property , but that the city will need the more_than $ 2 million in estimated annual revenue that ultimately will be produced by the hotel and two planned commercial sites . &quot; This is an economic insurance_policy for the city , &quot; said Councilman Mike Eggers . &quot; Ultimately , it will be good for the landowner and the taxpayers of Dana Point. &quot; The plan ' s opponents , who have fought for more_than three years to save more of the bluff-top land for parks or open space , have urged the council to reject the agreement . One grass-roots group is circulating a petition calling_for a citywide vote to overturn the council ' s actions . Councilman William L . Ossenmacher , who supports that effort and who cast the lone vote against the project , said , &quot; This agreement looks_to me to be extremely one-sided . There are some very small benefits to the city and some great benefits to the property owner. &quot; Resident Bob Larwood , one of the plan ' s most outspoken critics , said before the meeting that the plan is not the financial boon some expect . &quot; All through this negotiation , ( the council ) has put_through the idea there would be $ 2.3 million coming_into the city from this plan , &quot; Larwood said . &quot; But unless the hotel and commercial areas are built , we will never see that money , at least not for 10 or 15 years . There is this feeling that once this deal is passed the city will be rolling in money , but that ' s just not going_to be the case. &quot; The timing of the construction of the proposed hotel and retail centers was one of the key issues in the renegotiation of the agreement over the past two weeks . As the agreement now stands , at least 50 % of the hotel would have to be finished before the last 65 homes could be built . The agreement does not require a guarantee that the commercial centers will be built . The new agreement also pushed_up the completion of the hilltop park at the highest point of the bluffs and reduced the purchase_prices on two parcels_of_land the city has the option of buying . &quot; We have tried to respond to all_the requests the City_Council has made , &quot; said Dan T . Daniels , a spokesman for the Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. , which owns the property along with the Chandis Securities Co . ( Chandis Securities , a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the Chandler family , is a principal stockholder in Times Mirror Co. , which publishes the Los Angeles Times. ) The city also will get 59 acres dedicated as parks or open space and $ 2.8 million in improvements to the parks , according to the agreement . &quot; I think the development agreement , especially now with these changes , gives an awful lot of benefits to the city of Dana Point , &quot; Daniels said . Members of the Dana Point Headlands Conservancy said they will continue to work to save more land on the bluffs , despite the council vote . Jacqueline Cain , one of its founders , said the group did not take a stand on the plan . &quot; We are nonpolitical , &quot; said Cain , an eight-year Dana Point resident . &quot; We are seeking federal and state grants and working_on a bond initiative to purchase parts of the land . We are going_to continue that no matter what happens. &quot;</TEXT>
