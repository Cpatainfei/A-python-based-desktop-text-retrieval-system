   <TEXT> Linda Luschei Hunio , a founder of Women at Risk , a Los Angeles advocacy and support group for women with HIV and AIDS , died Saturday of complications from the virus . She was 36 . Under her maiden_name -- Linda Luschei -- she had been a frequent speaker in the cause of educating women about the risks of HIV infection while helping them confront ostracism . With a_few female friends , Mrs . Hunio founded Women at Risk , based in Culver City . As an advocate , she lectured before students , church groups and health_professionals , and was featured on TV and radio talk_shows . In 1993 , the city of Los Angeles honored her with a Lifetime Achievement Award for her efforts . Often , she told her own story . A graduate of UCLA , Mrs . Hunio was working in the publishing industry in New York when she married Michael Ruggere in 1985 . After his unexpected death a_few months later , she learned she had HIV , having contracted the virus from her husband . He had evidently and unknowingly contracted HIV from transfusions before blood was tested for the virus . For five years , she once told The Times , she kept her condition secret from all but a_few confidantes , terrified of society ' s ignorance and bigotry . Overcoming those fears , she learned to caution women of their risk and urged those with HIV to seek joy in their lives . Her quest_for love and companionship prompted her to place an ad in the L.A. Weekly personals identifying herself as HIV-positive . She dated several men as a result , both HIV-positive and negative . In her last two years , her quest was answered by Stephen Jay Hunio of Los Angeles , who is also HIV-positive . They were married in March , a_few days before Mrs . Hunio ' s illness required her to enter the hospital .</TEXT>
