   <HEADLINE> SUIT CITES IMPAIRED CHILDREN AIDED BY SERVICES ; COURTS : CLASS-ACTION CHALLENGE TO NEW LAW DESCRIBES CASES SUCH AS A DEAF GIRL IN THE STATE ILLEGALLY WHO LEARNED SIGN_LANGUAGE IN SPECIAL CLASSES . CO-AUTHOR OF MEASURE SAYS LEGAL TACTIC IS DISHONEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Opponents of Proposition 187 say there are at least 300 # 000 reasons to keep fighting against the popular new law . Barbara Ayala is one . Barbara , 15 , is an illegal immigrant who would be forced_out of school by the measure and a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits filed to block it . Hearing- and speech-impaired , she was unable to communicate with others until her parents brought her from Mexico in 1992 and enrolled her in special classes at Alhambra High_School . &quot; I felt that I could not talk , people did not understand me , &quot; she said Thursday , speaking through a sign-language interpreter . &quot; Now I can sign . . . . I feel free. &quot; The suit naming Barbara is one of at least eight legal challenges filed since Tuesday ' s passage of Proposition 187 , which denies public_services to illegal immigrants , including about 300 # 000 students statewide . Legal experts say it is too early to tell whether the suits will ultimately be combined . For her parents , Cipriano and Andrea Ayala , the lawsuit is the latest chapter in a lifelong quest to help their daughter . The trek began , they said , with incessant tests and ineffective treatments when she was a toddler . It continued with the decision to abandon good jobs and family in Cuernavaca for an illegal hike across the border and an uncertain future . &quot; We heard that education would be_better for her in the United States -- that there were special programs , &quot; said Andrea Ayala , who left two grown children behind when she came north . &quot; We came for our daughter. &quot; Barbara ' s father , who traded a journeyman contractor ' s position in Mexico for entry-level work in a factory here , said the sacrifices have been worthwhile . &quot; It was really very , very small , that sacrifice , &quot; he said . Backers of Proposition 187 say that peppering lawsuits with emotional stories such_as Barbara ' s is a clever but dishonest tactic to influence public_opinion . A boy identified only as Gregorio T . in the suit filed by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund has encephalitis that will be terminal , the suit says , if he is denied medical_care . Another has had a kidney transplant and allegedly will not survive without rigorous follow-up care . &quot; They pick_out the horror stories , the hard-luck cases , &quot; said Alan Nelson , co-author of the new law and former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service . &quot; Of course , if I was_on the other side , I ' d be doing the same thing. &quot; These hardship cases are the exception , not the rule , and they are not this country ' s responsibility , Nelson said . In addition , he said , disabled illegal immigrants such_as Barbara may be taking special_education slots away from legal residents . However , current state law requires that public_schools accommodate all students with special needs . Alhambra ' s superintendent of schools , Heber Meeks , said there is no waiting list for the Alhambra High program . Special_education students are among the most expensive to educate . On average , a student costs the state about $ 3 # 400 a year , and hearing-impaired high_school students cost at least $ 1 # 000 a year more , state education officials said . Because Alhambra High keeps classes small in its special_education program and Barbara Ayala also takes regular classes -- with a personal interpreter -- the tab for educating her is higher than $ 6 # 000 annually , according to Assistant Supt . Dianne Saurenman . Barbara is blissfully unaware of that cost . In Mexico , she attended school only with hearing-impaired students and the teachers required them to read lips . She never learned to sign there and conversed as best she could with her parents and a_few close friends in a combination of a gestures , grunts and note-writing . &quot; It was very frustrating , &quot; she said Thursday . &quot; I felt oppressed. &quot; Here , she eagerly shoulders a full academic load -- math , science , history and English -- as well as taking cooking and physical_education classes . She is learning to work_on computers and envisions that skill as leading to a possible career . She has more friends here , she said , many of them deaf . At times , her father said , he finds himself relying_on his daughter . She can read English signs and labels . He cannot . Barbara ' s attorney , Fred Kumetz , said Thursday that he initiated the class-action suit after he met the Ayalas through another client and was touched by their concern for their daughter . Under federal_court rules , Kumetz can be paid_for his efforts by taxpayers , but only if he wins . &quot; ( Money ) is not the motivation , &quot; he said . &quot; I was born in Mexico . This is an important issue to me. &quot;</TEXT>
