   <HEADLINE> UNIQUE GEOLOGY KEY TO QUAKE ' S UNEVEN IMPACT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The titanic energy of the magnitude 6.6 Northridge quake was reflected like sunlight through a prism of hidden rocks and soft sediments to violently shake some areas far from its epicenter in the San Fernando Valley , while leaving closer neighborhoods unscathed , scientists said . In its path , the largest earthquake in the basin ' s modern history left_behind a puzzling seismic patchwork of shattered communities , often separated by areas where the sharp shudders Monday did no more_than disturb sleep and fray nerves . Geophysicists now believe that shock_waves within the San Fernando Valley crisscrossed like ripples in the caldron created by the high , hard rock of the surrounding mountains . Where the crests of the waves intersected , the power of the ground shocks was intensified . Where the troughs of the waves met crests , their energy was canceled . As the shock_waves spread , the Los Angeles Basin also served as a lens to capture and focus the quake ' s force , extending the duration of the shocks . The combination was enough to make one side of Pasadena shake three times harder than another , strong enough at the interchange of the Santa Monica and San Diego freeways to hurl cars in the air , according to sensors maintained by the state Division of Mines and Geology . The direction along which the fault ruptured also may have helped aim Monday ' s tremors more directly toward the Westside of Los Angeles and Santa Monica , geologists said . There , dozens of buildings were severely damaged and a section of the Santa Monica Freeway was smashed , even though they were more_than 15 miles from the epicenter . &quot; There was something happening in the West L.A. area which was causing an amplification of the ground motion higher than the adjacent areas , &quot; said Wilfred D . Iwan , the Caltech earthquake specialist who is chairman of the California Seismic Safety Commission . &quot; There is a fairly wide variation in the intensity of the ground shaking even within a small area several miles around the epicenter in the Valley , &quot; he said . Scientists still are trying to determine precisely which thrust_fault slipped . They do not know which way the rupture progressed either , from east to west , or from top to bottom -- all_of which could affect the direction and intensity of the temblor ' s force . Experts caution that there is no hard formula to calculate the immediate intensity of the ground shaking caused by a single earthquake . Each stamps the landscape with a unique imprint . Although a nuclear_explosion radiates its deadly energy equally in all directions , an earthquake ' s power can be dissipated safely or channeled into even fiercer intensity , depending_on factors ranging from geophysics to the makeup of dirt . &quot; The fault plane is not complicated . What we do know , however , is that . . . thrust earthquakes radiate their energy in some unexpected ways , &quot; said Jim Mori , head of the Pasadena field office of the U.S. Geological Survey . Seismologists were caught off_guard by the raw force of the ground motion generated by the Northridge quake , which yielded some of the highest ground-acceleration readings ever recorded in the area -- motion strong enough to lift a building off its foundations and drop it like a handkerchief . &quot; It is like two pieces of bad news : Not only was it a large earthquake , it was an unusually strong one , &quot; said USGS geophysicist John Boatwright in Menlo Park . At some locations in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside , the shaking intensities were even higher than those produced by the magnitude 7.6 Landers earthquake of 1992 , sensors showed . &quot; I was very surprised that the ground motion was so big to the south of the epicenter and to the west , &quot; said Hiroo Kanamori , director of the Caltech Seismological Laboratory . &quot; The earthquake ' s magnitude is not a very good predictor of the actual ground motion we will feel , &quot; he said . In the desperate seconds of a major earthquake , the power of ground motion -- the shudders that throw people to the floor and even topple buildings -- is above all a matter of frequency , a low_pitch to which people and the structures they inhabit naturally vibrate , like bells spontaneously responding to a tuning fork . If the waves are short and fast -- of high_frequency -- the earthquake ' s energy may radiate harmlessly through buildings and other structures . But if the shock_wave slows sufficiently -- down to 10 hertz or less -- its frequency dips_into the ranges to which houses and high-rises will respond . &quot; What you really are feeling when you feel your house shake is the frequency of the building , &quot; one seismologist said . &quot; Other frequencies go_through the building and don ' t affect it. &quot; And when it comes_to frequency , local soil conditions can mean the difference between safety on one side of the street and calamity across the way . That is what geologists call the &quot; site effect. &quot; &quot; The implication is that there may be something about a local site that amplifies ground shaking , independent of the source of the seismic shaking or how far away it is , &quot; Iwan said . In the Valley , sensors at a firehouse on Nordhoff Avenue recorded the ground accelerating during the earthquake at about one-third the force of gravity , while farther away from the epicenter at Sylmar Hospital , three miles east of the interchange of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways , sensors measured horizontal ground motion almost three times stronger . The measurements taken_in Tarzana , closest to the epicenter , showed even larger ground acceleration , almost twice the force of gravity -- &quot; enough to knock your socks off , &quot; Iwan said . &quot; Anything in excess of one G would mean that something would actually hop off the ground , &quot; Iwan said . Iwan and other earthquake experts believe that part of the variation is in the difference between a house that sits on rock and one on fill dirt . &quot; Motion is amplified by soil , &quot; said Boatwright of the Geological Survey . As the shock_waves move from hard , dense rock , such_as granite , to more loosely compacted sedimentary_rocks , the waves slow_down . As they move from those rocks into gravel or dirt , they slow even more and their amplitude -- the size of the waves -- increases . &quot; When you have sedimentary basins . . . the energy gets trapped and bounces around for a longer period_of_time . The San Fernando Valley is a very good_example of a place where the seismic energy becomes trapped , &quot; Boatwright said . Loosely compacted alluvial_soil in the San Fernando Valley greatly enhanced the damage in the 1971 Sylmar quake , contributing to the collapse of the San Fernando veteran ' s hospital . Shock_waves from the quake ' s epicenter traveled through the hard rock of the San Gabriel Mountains at 35 # 000 feet per second . But when the waves hit the looser soil in the north Valley , they slowed to 12 # 000 feet per second and concentrated the energy , records show . Where land is composed of loose fill , underlaid by a high_water table -- as in the Marina del Rey , Oxnard and Long_Beach areas and San Francisco ' s Marina District -- shock_waves can instantly transform solid land into quicksand . The Marina District was devastated in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake , even though it was 70 miles or more from the epicenter , when its solid foundations became fluid . In the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , such soil liquefaction ruptured water_lines , allowing fires to sweep_through the city unchecked . So far , no evidence has been found that soil liquefaction caused the damage on the Westside . But even compacted sediments or sandy soil , such_as that underlying some of the Westside and much of the Valley , can slow an earthquake ' s shock_waves to the frequency that will shake a building apart , earthquake experts said . State seismic hazard maps indicate that the land under the collapsed Santa Monica Freeway interchange at La Cienega is former swampland and fill . &quot; I am sure the site effect was very important in the case of the highway , &quot; Kanamori said . As scientists better understand the way an earthquake ' s energy is distributed block by block , the knowledge could have far-ranging implications for zoning , building codes and real_estate values , earthquake experts said . &quot; The scientific understanding is so imperfect now that we are not_able to differentiate one block from the next , &quot; Iwan said . If they tried , he added , &quot; we would create either a false sense of security or a false sense of panic. &quot; Times staff writer Kenneth Reich contributed to this story * RELATED STORIES : A2-A5 , A33 , B1-B4 , B6 , B8 , B15 , D1 , F1 , F3 Liquid Earth Earthquakes are typically measured by magnitude , which may_not be the best indicator of how powerful local shaking may be . The violence of earth movement is determined by many factors , including soil type , local terrain and surface irregularities in the fault itself . These variables help explain why in Monday ' s 6.6 quake , homes a_few miles from the epicenter lost only their chimneys while massive sections of a freeway collapsed 20 miles away . ON SHAKY GROUND Shaded area shows how much of the metropolitan area could be subject_to failure because of soil conditions , including liquefaction . Ground motion in such areas is magnified , so damage could be substantial even in a moderate quake . Measuring stations around Southern California recorded the intensity of ground motion at key sites during the 4:31 a.m. quake . The sensors measure the force of the motion by recording the acceleration caused by the quake . The motion is measured in terms of the force of gravity . One ' g ' is strong enough to make unsecured buildings or vehicles literally hop off the ground .

The particles of soil move freely , lubricated by the water , and with repeated shock_waves take_on the characteristics of gelatin or liquid . Where ground_water may_not be a factor , the uncompacted soil tends to amplify shock_waves and intensify local shaking . Shock_Waves Trapped Energy : In a sedimentary basin like the San Fernando Valley , shock_waves radiating from an earthquake ' s epicenter can be trapped by harder surrounding rock and reflected back on themselves . Amplification : Where the crests of the shock_waves intersect , the power of the earthquake is effectively amplified ; where the crests intersect a trough , the power is canceled .
