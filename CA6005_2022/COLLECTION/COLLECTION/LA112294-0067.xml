   <HEADLINE> MEDIA ; MITTERRAND ' EXPOSE ' IRRITATES THE FRENCH ; ' FRANCE HAS PASSED FROM GOOD OLD_CATHOLIC INDULGENCE TO ANGLO-SAXON PURITANISM , ' COMPLAINS ONE EDITOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For two decades , French journalists and the nation ' s high and mighty kept this scandalous secret : President Francois Mitterrand , a married_man , had a mistress and an illegitimate daughter . So when Paris Match published that fact earlier this month , along with a photograph of Mitterrand and his 20-year-old daughter , the outcry was , understandably , deafening . But it wasn ' t the affair that turned_out to be the scandal . No one criticized that . And few even seemed to care that Mitterrand might have used taxpayer money to support his &quot; second family. &quot; What agitated many of France ' s leading journalists and political figures was that Paris Match had printed the expose at all . In their view , the magazine had violated the heretofore sanctified realm of a politician ' s private life , breaking an unwritten journalistic code . Their biggest fear was that the_French press was becoming too_much like the American and English press . &quot; For years , France has remained an island of wisdom in an ocean of revelations that pollute the newspapers of America , Britain , Italy and Germany , &quot; wrote Franz-Olivier Giesbert , editor of Le Figaro , Paris ' largest-circulation daily newspaper . &quot; In the space of a_few hours , France has passed from good old_Catholic indulgence to Anglo-Saxon puritanism. &quot; Lost in the debate was the story itself , the details of which were enough to make Fleet_Street drool . In the mid-1960s , when he was 50 years old , Mitterrand began a long affair with Anne Pingeot , a 30-year-old campaign volunteer . In 1974 , she gave_birth to their daughter , Mazarine . Mazarine is the third child of Mitterrand , 78 , who also has two grown sons by Danielle Mitterrand , his wife of the last 50 years . The public revelation came_in the final months of Mitterrand ' s 14-year presidency and , perhaps , his life . He has prostate cancer and has himself raised the possibility that he may_not survive until May , when his term expires . The Paris Match photos and articles , which boosted circulation of that popular weekly from 800 # 000 to 1.2 million , uncorked a host of troubling questions for editors faced with dwindling readership , journalists protecting other secrets and politicians worried about their private lives . By keeping Mitterrand ' s daughter out of the papers , had journalists contributed to the aura of monarchy that surrounds his presidency ? Did Mitterrand himself , by taking his daughter to public restaurants and inviting her to state dinners , not open the door ? And if taxpayer money was used to support Mitterrand ' s mistress and offspring , should not the citizenry have been told sooner ? But the overriding question was : Where is the line between a politician ' s public and private lives ? The debate has put the_French press , as well as some basic tenets of French life , under the microscope . It also mirrors the American debate over what the public has a right to know -- and , in this case , whether breaking one ' s marriage vows consistently over a period of decades casts doubt on a politician ' s character or his or her fitness for public office . In the United States , the sexual misconduct of public figures &quot; has more to do with the fact of lying , &quot; said Christine Ockrent , one of France ' s most respected journalists and editor of the weekly newsmagazine L ' Express . &quot; But in France there is a certain politeness , where things relating to sex are not discussed . &quot; We never talk_about sex , you know , we talk_about love , &quot; she added . &quot; It ' s cultural . And I feel in our part of the world it is important to maintain the dividing line between what people do_in bed and what they do_in government. &quot; The Paris Match article stemmed from &quot; Plaidoyer Impossible &quot; ( Impossible Defense ) , a book by Philippe Alexandre , a French journalist and political analyst . The existence of Mitterrand ' s daughter had been revealed before , but only in books and articles written by right-wing critics of the Socialist president . It had never been exposed in a mainstream publication . Defending their decision to publish , Paris Match and Alexandre argued that Mitterrand had effectively revealed his daughter ' s existence himself by appearing in public with her . And Alexandre said the likelihood that Mazarine and her mother were supported by the state makes_it a public matter . &quot; The French aren ' t very curious about love_affairs , &quot; Alexandre said in an interview . &quot; If I learn that a public figure has a mistress and spends the weekend with her , that doesn ' t interest the_French . They think that is nearly normal . &quot; But money does interest us , &quot; he added . &quot; And that is my justification -- not that Francois Mitterrand had a liaison that lasted 30 years , but that he used public money for it. &quot; Serge July , editor of the left-leaning Liberation newspaper , said &quot; everyone knew &quot; about Mitterrand and his daughter . July himself had run_into the pair twice at restaurants . But he never published it because the relationship had not influenced public policy , and Mitterrand had never made his own morality a political issue . &quot; The only other question for me was : Is this second family supported by government money ? &quot; July said . &quot; And that remains to be investigated. &quot; Giesbert , whose newspaper , Le Figaro , has opposed Mitterrand , called Alexandre &quot; a very courageous journalist. &quot; But , he added , &quot; I just don ' t agree with him . &quot; Look , I don ' t think it ' s OK to use public money to support a mistress , &quot; Giesbert said in an interview . &quot; But it ' s not the scandal of the year . I don ' t think it is . I ' m sorry . I don ' t think it ' s a story. &quot; Like many editors in France , Giesbert believes that the public ' s right to know stops at the doors of a politician ' s home . In the debate here , even Alexandre ' s critics acknowledge that many journalists in France are timid , and especially too reverential and too respectful of political power . And the most powerful man in politics for nearly 14 years has been Mitterrand . For years , journalists knew that Mitterrand had mistresses and that he and his wife , Danielle , led largely separate lives . Danielle Mitterrand is said to have first met her husband ' s mistress last year in the hospital , when the president was recovering from a cancer operation . In the 1960s and 1970s , journalists say , Mitterrand often brought Pingeot to Socialist_Party meetings . And Pingeot and her daughter reportedly lived_in a state-owned apartment , under police guard . Mitterrand has never denied Mazarine ' s existence . In 1984 , four years into his first term as president , a group of top political reporters asked Mitterrand if he had a &quot; natural daughter. &quot; He responded : &quot; Yes . So what ? &quot; And no one wrote a word about it . Paris Match contends that Mitterrand knew of its intention to publish and did not object . In the fuzzy long-lens photograph published in Paris Match , Mitterrand is resting his arm protectively on the dark-haired young_woman ' s shoulders as they emerge from a Paris restaurant .</TEXT>
