   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; CITY , SCHOOL , TRANSIT OFFICIALS MAP STRATEGY ; REACTION : SCHNEIDER TALKS TO CITY_MANAGERS . SCHOOLS GET STATE ADVICE . TOLLWAY AGENCIES SAY WORK TO GO_ON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Orange County ' s financial crisis deepened Thursday , city_managers , school administrators and transit agency officials huddled in closed-door sessions across the county , struggling to determine what implications it may hold for them . About 50 city_managers and finance officers gathered at Irvine City_Hall for a two-hour meeting that included a question-and-answer session with County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider . Schneider , who spent an hour with the city representatives , &quot; was very candid , &quot; Orange City_Manager David F . Dixon said later . &quot; To be very frank , I had a lot of empathy for him. &quot; Other officials said they emerged from the meeting supportive of the county and its weary leadership , but anxious for more information about the likely effects of the crisis on their cities . &quot; I think they are doing the best they can , &quot; Anaheim City_Manager James D . Ruth said . &quot; It ' s a very complex thing and there is a lot of uncertainty. &quot; Irvine City_Manager Paul O . Brady Jr. , president of the Orange County City_Managers Assn. , said after the meeting that none of the cities were considering filing bankruptcy , at least for now . But the administrators also complained of difficulty in keeping_up with the quick pace of events and frustration with their inability to get answers from the county . &quot; It is hard to . . . keep informed and that is part of the value of this meeting , &quot; said Costa Mesa City_Manager Allan L . Roeder , who added that cities must play an active role in resolving the issue . &quot; We can ' t afford to just wait and see what happens. &quot; The administrators also formed an advisory committee of city_managers from each of the county ' s supervisorial districts . Brady will chair the group , which will include Ruth , Santa Ana ' s David N . Ream , Huntington Beach ' s Michael T . Uberuaga , Fullerton ' s James L . Armstrong and Laguna Niguel ' s Tim Casey . The committee , which will act_on behalf of all_of the managers , is scheduled to meet for the first time today . &quot; We will talk_about where we go next and will consider if we want to hire legal counsel , &quot; Brady said . &quot; We want to formulate a game_plan on how to keep the cities involved and up_to date. &quot; Brady said many in the group have mixed feelings about the county and its actions . &quot; I think we feel let_down , concerned that we weren ' t at least told about this sooner so we may have taken individual acts_as cities to protect our monies we ' ve invested , &quot; he said . While the managers met in Irvine , about 100 county school_superintendents , district financial_officers , school_board members and attorneys met at the Orange County Department_of_Education headquarters in Costa Mesa . The 90-minute meeting included a conference_call with state Secretary of Child Development and Education Maureen DiMarco , who urged school officials to find a way to keep their incoming tax_revenue out of the county pool , according to Capistrano Unified School District Supt . James A . Fleming . Fleming said DiMarco suggested that school districts try to divert their revenue to the San Diego or Los Angeles County treasuries , or even to deposit the money in banks of_their_own choosing . Fleming , for one , was comforted by the session . &quot; Yesterday my comfort level was a 1 . Today it ' s a 3 , &quot; he said . Participants said school districts received assurances that they will be able to make today ' s payroll for classified employees . They were also promised that they will be able to make the payroll for teachers in two weeks . The school districts also decided to join together to share the costs of legal counsel . It is too early to say whether the County Department_of_Education itself will file for bankruptcy or sue the county , said Ronald D . Wenkart , the department ' s general counsel . Some officials said they are frustrated with the situation because it might tarnish the reputations of the school districts . &quot; All the school districts have been in excellent financial_condition , &quot; said William Habermehl , assistant superintendent of the Department_of_Education . &quot; Because of its impact on schools , to many people it looks_like schools have been mismanaged . This happened to us , not because of us. &quot; It was announced at the meeting that the county is establishing a separate fund for school district revenues , said Ron Walter , superintendent of Garden Grove Unified School District . Still , several districts took steps Thursday to demand that their incoming tax_revenues be kept separate from the failed county investment pool . At a Thursday night meeting , trustees of the Fullerton Joint Union High_School District unanimously adopted a resolution to stop their tax contributions from going_into the county fund , with the La Habra City School District Board_of_Education taking the same action a short time later . Transit and toll road agency officials also met Thursday to assess the widening repercussions of the county ' s financial trouble . Officials of the Transportation Corridor Agencies met for nearly an hour in closed_session and said later that Orange County ' s major toll roads will be completed , although $ 324 million earmarked for their construction is frozen in the bankrupt county ' s money-losing investment pool . &quot; There is a commitment . . . to completing these projects . This is one more hurdle we will overcome , &quot; said Scott Diehl , chairman of the Foothill / Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency . Nonetheless , the corridor agencies ' two boards of directors , in_charge of developing the San Joaquin , Foothill and Eastern corridors , authorized their chief_executive , William C . Woollett , to take any action necessary , including hiring consultants , to offset any negative effects of the bankruptcy ' s impact . The agencies ' board_members also agreed that at their next public hearing , on Jan . 12 , they will review the track record of their financial team , including their investment_bankers . Robert L . Richardson , a board_member who recommended the action , said afterward that he expects the investment_bankers to do whatever they can to help and not to further undermine the agencies ' financial position . &quot; If they don ' t work with us now , they won ' t be working with us in the future , &quot; Richardson warned . Among those most interested in knowing what effect the county bankruptcy may have_on the fate of the highway projects are the environmentalists who have been fighting the projects in court . &quot; I am truly loving this , &quot; said a gleeful Patrick Mitchell , a representative of Earth First , a group opposing construction of the Eastern Corridor . &quot; We have been saying the whole time the projects are a bad deal and now there is economic evidence to suggest that might be true. &quot; Mitchell , who attended the Transportation Corridor Agencies public hearing , said he believes construction of the Eastern Corridor will be delayed because money for its construction has yet to be raised in the bond market . He predicted that the county bankruptcy will sour the market for the bonds . Mike Phillips , executive_director of the Laguna Canyon Conservancy , which last week lost an appellate_court case challenging the adequacy of the environmental studies paving the way for construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway , said he also hoped the bankruptcy would add_to the delay of that project . But Woollett said construction on the San Joaquin Hills tollway , which cuts_through environmentally sensitive Laguna Canyon , will begin &quot; the instant &quot; a federal appeals court lifts an injunction on the project . The court last week ruled against the environmentalists ' legal challenge . Woollett said he had advised board_members that the Transportation Corridor Agencies would have no trouble continuing to pay the salaries of their 44-person staff . Woollett acknowledged , however , that a bond offering planned this spring to raise construction funds for the Eastern toll road might have to be postponed . Also Thursday , the Orange County Transportation Authority , which operates the county ' s bus system , said it is making efforts to ensure that revenue remains available for debt service , bus operations and payments to construction contractors and other vendors . OCTA officials said they have asked Orange County to release state transportation funds deposited in the county treasury and to ensure prompt receipt of the authority ' s portion of county property_tax revenue . The authority has asked the county to establish a trust_fund for deposit of its future state revenue , which would be separate from the county treasury and thus not affected by the county ' s bankruptcy action .</TEXT>
