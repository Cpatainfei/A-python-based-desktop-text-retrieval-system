   <TEXT> * Robert Kasten ' s column ( Commentary , Dec . 27 ) provides a thoughtful analysis of why the United States should support Taiwan ' s participation in the United Nations . The residents of the Republic_of_China on Taiwan have worked very hard to accomplish remarkable economic , political and social changes_over the past 40 years.Taipei has shared its success by providing economic aid to Latin_American , African and other Asian_countries . Even Washington has encouraged Taipei to participate in multilateral efforts to promote global prosperity . Taiwan belongs only to the people living there . Neglecting this population and its government is a gross violation of the universality of membership principles which the United Nations upholds . Taiwan ' s people deserve better than this . As president of the Taiwan Benevolent Assn . of America , I feel the United States should add its vote to those who believe the Republic_of_China on Taiwan has earned a U.N. seat .
