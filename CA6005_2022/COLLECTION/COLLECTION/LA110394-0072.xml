   <HEADLINE> GARCETTI ON ' 3 STRIKES '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Times ' series , &quot; Six Months of ' Three Strikes ' &quot; ( Oct . 23 , 24 ) , highlights many of the issues the Office of the District_Attorney is facing in prosecuting &quot; three strikes &quot; cases . I am concerned , however , that the series misstates the three-strikes enforcement policy of my office . Since the enactment of three strikes , I have stated consistently that I will follow the letter and spirit of three strikes . My three-strikes policy dictates that it is the rare three-strikes case which should be resolved without three-strikes penalties . Our line prosecutors appear to be following this policy . There are cases which should be and are resolved differently , but these cases are not common . Despite the best efforts of this office , your series makes clear that some judges are working to evade three strikes . We are fighting this by appealing appropriate cases to see that three strikes , in fact , is enforced . Finally , prosecutors in this office file criminal actions against three strikes defendants -- and all other defendants -- solely based on the merits of the particular cases ; that is , whether the evidence warrants conviction by a reasonable trier of fact . We do not consider whether the defendants are_on parole from state_prison ( and potentially facing proceedings for violating parole ) . If there is a case that should be filed , we file it . Period .
