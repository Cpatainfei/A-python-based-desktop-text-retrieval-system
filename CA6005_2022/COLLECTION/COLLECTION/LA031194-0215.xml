   <HEADLINE> SKIING / WORLD CUP AT MAMMOTH ; SCHNEIDER RUNS AWAY WITH A MILESTONE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More amazing than Vreni Schneider ' s 50th World Cup victory Thursday , a slalom that the_Swiss star led from start gate to finish , was her contemplation of retirement at 29 . She ' s some has-been . Schneider dropped some hints after winning her sixth World Cup slalom of the season and moving past Sweden ' s Pernilla Wiberg into the World Cup overall lead heading into next week ' s finals at Vail , Colo . Schneider left the drama to the also-rans , posting the fastest times for both runs to win with a total time of 1 minute 18.52 seconds . Katja Koren of Slovenia was a distant second , 1.43 seconds behind , and Germany ' s Martina Ertl finished third . Long_Island ' s Carrie Sheinberg was the top American , posting a career-best 11th place . She said watching Schneider race is like attending a clinic . &quot; There must be something she does that we don ' t , &quot; Sheinberg said . &quot; Because she beats us by a lot . I really don ' t know what it is. &quot; Retirement ? Schneider is skiing down the back slope of perhaps her best season . She is coming_off an Olympics at which she won three medals -- gold , silver and bronze -- to add_to the two gold medals she won at the 1988 Calgary Games . She has won more medals -- five -- than any other female skier . She is within striking distance of Annemarie Moser-Proell ' s record of 62 World Cup women ' s victories . After Schneider ' s Mammoth victory , Swiss coaches and teammates presented her with a gray sweatshirt with &quot; 50 Times &quot; printed in blue block_letters across the front . Schneider appears to shock herself with each achievement . She might be shocked again next week at Vail , where she may very well clinch the second overall title of her career . Picking_up 100 points with her latest triumph , Schneider overtook Wiberg in the overall standings and leads by 41 points . Wiberg finished fourth Thursday . &quot; Obviously , now the World Cup overall is_on my mind , &quot; Schneider said . &quot; Then , I ' ll go_home and , in the quiet of my home , make a decision. &quot; Schneider said her chances of returning next year are 50-50 . Another number , 62 , might enter into her decision . &quot; Obviously , 62 is something to shoot_for , &quot; Schneider said of Moser-Proell ' s record . &quot; But I think it ' s too many wins for me to achieve. &quot; American expectations are more modest . Sheinberg is trying to pick_up the slalom slack left when Julie Parisien , a three-time World Cup winner , announced that she was taking a sabbatical . After a disappointing season through December , the 21-year-old Sheinberg gained momentum into the Olympics , where she placed a surprising 18th in slalom , the best U.S. finish . Sheinberg had the 14th-fastest time in the first run and moved_up three positions with a second-run time of 39.67 , and a two-run total of 1.21:82. Sheinberg said her problem has been self-confidence . After her top-20 finish in the Olympics , she was asked to give a motivational speech to the basketball_team at her former high_school in Port Washington , N.Y. &quot; I think it helped me as much as it helped them , &quot; Sheinberg said .</TEXT>
