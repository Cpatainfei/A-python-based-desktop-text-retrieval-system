   <HEADLINE> BLAST LEVELS ARGENTINE JEWISH CENTER , KILLS 26 ; SOUTH_AMERICA : PRESIDENT MENEM SAYS ATTACK WAS PLANNED ' FROM ABROAD. ' AREA IN BUENOS AIRES DEVASTATED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A huge explosion , probably a terrorist bomb , destroyed a seven-story downtown building housing two Jewish groups here Monday . At least 26 people were killed and 127 were injured . Rescue workers feared they would find more bodies in the rubble of the building , where about 100 people worked . The blast , which occurred shortly before 10 a.m. , flattened cars and hurled deadly shards of glass and concrete along busy Pasteur Street . Parts of adjacent buildings also were destroyed , and others nearby were severely damaged . Many of the injured were passersby . Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem , who said the attack was planned &quot; from abroad and helped by people here , &quot; called the perpetrators &quot; beasts , savages. &quot; The explosion coincided with the start of peace talks between Israel and Jordan . Jewish community sources said the government has told them that they believe the explosion was the work of a Muslim fundamentalist group that came_into the country from abroad . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , visiting Israel , said the attack was &quot; a reminder that despite the glowing prospects there are still the enemies of peace around the world , not only here in the Middle East. &quot; Two years ago , at least 29 people were killed , and more_than 200 injured , in a bomb attack on the Israeli Embassy here . Police have not established responsibility for that explosion . The building that was reduced to rubble Monday housed the_Argentine Israelite Mutual Assn . and the Delegation of Argentine Israelite Assns. , two of the most important Jewish organizations . About 250 # 000 Jews live_in Argentina , most in Buenos Aires . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin called the attack &quot; a cowardly , criminal and evil act , &quot; vowing that &quot; Israel will continue to chase the perpetrators of terrorism to the end. &quot; A Palestine Liberation Organization official in Argentina denounced the blast . &quot; We deeply lament this attack against peace , &quot; said Sujail Aquel , who represents the PLO in Buenos Aires . A group calling itself Islamic Command telephoned a local radio_station to take responsibility for the attack , but officials said nothing was known about such a group and that the call could have been a hoax . Menem ordered the borders closed , and said two people were detained -- an Iraqi carrying an expired Brazilian passport at the border with Brazil and an Iranian detained elsewhere . The president gave no details . Earlier , a German woman and Iranian man were detained for questioning at Ezeiza International Airport outside Buenos Aires but were later released . In the first hours after the explosion , Pasteur Street was crowded with rescue workers , volunteers , onlookers and people seeking news about relatives and friends . A child and a young_man were brought_out of the ruins alive more_than eight hours after the blast . A crowd also gathered outside the nearby Clinicas Hospital , where most of the victims were taken . Interior_Secretary Alberto Iribarne said late Monday that 26 people were killed and 127 injured . Ruben Beraja , president of the Delegation of Argentine Israelite Assns. , said in a telephone_interview that the scope of damage was so great it looked as if the explosives had been placed by demolition experts . Because Argentine extremists are not known to have such expertise , he said , the attack appeared to be the work of international terrorists . &quot; It has the characteristics of being a repeat of actions by Islamic fundamentalists , &quot; he said . The fundamentalist group Hezbollah is suspected in the March 17 , 1992 , attack on the Israeli Embassy . One project housed in the building destroyed Monday seemed to raise the possibility of a motive for the bombing unrelated to the Middle_East : It was the headquarters for research into previously secret government files to trace the steps of World_War_II Nazis who immigrated to Argentina . The 2-year-old project , far from complete , has turned_up documents that detail a historical pattern of tolerance and complicity benefiting the fugitive Nazis . Beraja said much of the documentation compiled in the project may have been destroyed in the explosion . But he said the possibility that pro-Nazi groups could have set_off the explosion was remote because they are not believed to have the &quot; operational capacity &quot; for such an attack . Times staff writers William R . Long in Santiago , Chile , and Robin Wright in Jerusalem contributed to this report .</TEXT>
