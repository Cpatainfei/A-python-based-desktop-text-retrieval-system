   <HEADLINE> HUNDREDS DIE AS CHOLERA SWEEPS RWANDA REFUGEES ; AFRICA : IN GRIM SCENES AT ZAIRIAN BORDER , RELIEF WORKERS RUSH TO BURY VICTIMS OF EPIDEMIC IN MASS GRAVES . OVERWHELMED OFFICIALS HAVE LOST COUNT OF THE BODIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The acrid stench of death filled the air here Thursday , as hundreds upon hundreds of corpses -- a_few here , a dozen a_few yards farther , 25 more just beyond -- lined dusty roads and littered the cruel fields of what has become the world ' s closest glimpse of hell . Relief operations for the more_than 1 million Rwandan refugees who have flooded this remote Zairian border town focused_on the grim task of picking_up and burying at least 1 # 100 men , women and children who fell victim in the last 24 hours to what doctors confirmed as a suddenly raging cholera epidemic . &quot; We stopped counting at 800 bodies &quot; along the road Thursday morning , said Koenraad Henckaerts of the relief group Doctors Without Borders . But that was early , and worse was to come as the fiercely contagious_disease spread amid the squalor and filth . &quot; We ' ve lost the body_count , &quot; French Army 1st Lt . A . Ramasco said wearily at midafternoon as he supervised six military trucks that rumbled slowly down the road outside the airport on burial detail . &quot; We ' re a transport regiment , not morticians. &quot; He wiped his brow and stared at the nearest row of roadside corpses . Most were wrapped in thin reed mats or tattered rags . Babies and children were tiny bundles in the dirt . A few legs and arms poked_out , coated like all else here in the thick gray dust and smoke that chokes the air and stings the eye . Even as the soldiers drove_off with the dead , more victims collapsed behind them . One man simply fell_over as he rode his bicycle ; two others dragged him to the side where he lay , limp and shaking , amid the passing crowd . Another dropped as he walked , his head resting_on a wrapped body . Nearby , two boys , no older than 10 , tugged at a filthy gray blanket to cover the thin corpse of another boy . Not far away , a girl , younger yet , gasped in silent sobs by her father ' s limp body . An infant sat , wailing weakly by her mother ' s lifeless form in a pile of volcanic_rocks . Up the road , a French front-end loader dug a long trench near a grove of banana_trees . Workers tossed body after body into the_pit ; each tumbled down to join the ghastly jumble of torsos , limbs and rags . At least 500 corpses were in the mass grave , officials said . Behind them , a bulldozer pushed dirt over the searing scene . Perhaps the inner_circle of this Dantesque tableau was three miles north at Munigi . Physicians from Doctors Without Borders and other aid groups worked a makeshift triage ward on an open field strewn with jagged lava rocks and the bodies of the dead and dying . &quot; Yesterday morning we had 10 dead , &quot; said Dr. Isabelle Pardieu . &quot; Last night , we had 100 . Now it is just growing and growing. &quot; A handful of the still-living had intravenous drips hooked_up . But most simply waited for the agony to end . Groans of pain and children ' s cries filled the still air . A corner of the field was reserved for the dead ; fresh corpses arrived in a steady stream at midday . &quot; Is he dead yet ? &quot; shouted Kevin Noone , from the_Irish aid group GOAL , pointing at the limp body of a man face-down on_the_road . &quot; Not yet ! Not yet ! &quot; shouted a colleague . &quot; Soon. &quot; Without pausing , they returned to their grisly work : spraying a dozen bodies with disinfectant and loading them , sad and sagging , into a brown pickup_truck . More bodies arrived as fast as these were carted_off , 60 in an hour , 300 by nightfall . &quot; It ' s literally like a conveyor_belt , &quot; Noone said as he worked . &quot; They bring them in , and we load them on the truck. &quot; Noone said he had rented a 40-foot trailer_truck to carry bodies today , an indication of the horrors expected ahead . Doctors predicted that the cholera -- which causes severe diarrhea , vomiting and sometimes death within five hours -- is likely to infect 10 # 000 to 50 # 000 refugees . Untreated , half will probably die . &quot; You cannot stop it at the moment , &quot; warned Henckaerts . Cholera initially spreads in contaminated water , but then can be passed directly from person to person . Corpses are especially contagious , so quick burial is critical . The chief treatment for those infected is immediate rehydration with special solutions to replace lost fluids . And the only reliable prevention is provision of chlorinated water . But both the solutions and clean water are in impossibly short supply . The first air shipment of 10 # 000 liters of solution arrived Thursday but most had been used by nightfall . Another shipment was expected today , but the airport is already running at near capacity . &quot; We ' ve only got one runway and you can ' t just pound it and pound it or you ' ll have to close it , &quot; said Paul Gilham , in_charge of the airlift here . Moreover , only six planes can be parked and unloaded at one time , or fewer if large cargo planes come_in . Still , relief supplies are increasing . About 80 tons of food were distributed Thursday and 200 tons are planned for today . Up to 400 tons may arrive by next week . About 600 tons of food are needed each day , however . The first truck convoy is expected late today or Saturday , officials said . They hope the road link from Kampala , 420 miles away in neighboring Uganda , may open a lifeline for faster provision of supplies . The epidemic , the latest legacy of Rwanda ' s 3 1 / 2-month civil_war and slaughter , created obvious new demands on already-overwhelmed relief groups . They have barely begun to provide food , water and shelter for the estimated 1.2 million Hutu refugees who fled here in the last week for fear of retribution from victorious Tutsi-led rebels in Rwanda . In Washington , President Clinton said the United States was ready &quot; to lead the United Nations in responding to the cholera problem and in dealing with the other aspects of this human catastrophe. &quot; He ordered Anthony Lake , White_House national security adviser , J . Brian Atwood , administrator of the Agency for International Development , and Pentagon officials to develop a plan for U.S. emergency relief . Atwood said the first priority was to send water , medicine and medical equipment to help check the cholera epidemic . The Pentagon plans to use as_many as 1 # 000 U.S. service personnel to deliver relief supplies . &quot; The international community has never seen anything like this , &quot; Atwood said , announcing an additional $ 41.4 million in U.S. aid . Atwood said the only long-term solution to the crisis was to persuade Rwandans still in their country to stay there and to get refugees to return home . To that end , he said , the United States plans to send much of its food aid to the southwest part of Rwanda as an incentive to refugees to remain there . In Goma , CARE country director Ralph Hazleton , who flew in Thursday from Nairobi , Kenya , on an Antonov cargo plane filled with a Toyota truck , mattresses and supplies , said his immediate plans were to help move 400 # 000 refugees to a more rural site selected by the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees . Just where wasn ' t clear . &quot; I got one report that it ' s four kilometers north of Goma , and another that it ' s 70 , &quot; Hazleton said . &quot; we ' ll find_out when we get there. &quot; Refugee camps are a misnomer . Hundreds of thousands of people simply squat by the roadside , awaiting their fate . Survivors lead bleating goats and long-horned cattle ; a_few sell yams and corn by the road . Rwandan soldiers , routed by rebels , strut by in their camouflage uniforms . Long lines of people shuffle endlessly down the road . Many carry yellow plastic jugs on their head , filled with water from Lake Kivu , about four miles south . Others head north to promised food distribution sites . Those who can , cover their noses with handkerchiefs , towels or surgical masks to cut the odor of death , dust and diesel . The sun , dimmed by the smoky haze , is a dull orb overhead . The refugees have stripped many of the trees for firewood . Their countless cooking fires were the only sign of life when night fell like a shroud on the tragedy of Goma . Times staff writer Norman Kempster in Washington contributed to this report . Cholera ' s Spread Poor sanitation , lack of clean drinking_water and crowded living conditions have prompted a cholera epidemic in Rwandan refugee camps . Human feces contain the cholera germs . Bacteria is spread by flies and unsanitary handling of food . Cholera spreads when germs are ingested from contaminated food and water . Bacteria causes diarrhea , vomiting and cramps , leading to dehydration . If untreated , half the victim die . Gross dehydration can be treated with intravenous fluid and antibiotics . When treated promptly , and if no kidney damage has occurred , patients can fully recover .</TEXT>
