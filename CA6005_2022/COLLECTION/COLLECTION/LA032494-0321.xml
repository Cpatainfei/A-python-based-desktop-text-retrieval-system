   <HEADLINE> OC HIGH : STUDENT NEWS &amp; VIEWS ; EXCHANGE GIFTS ; FOREIGN STUDENTS WHO STUDY HERE LEARN ABOUT THE U.S. AND SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR NATIVE_LANDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When foreign_exchange students come_to this country , they have to leave friends behind , learn a different culture and language , adapt to a new environment and go_to a school where they have to make new friends -- not to mention live with people they hardly know . It can be an intimidating decision . Why , then , do so many students from other countries visit the United States annually through exchange programs ? Some , such_as Magda Sehnalova from the Czech Republic , want to learn firsthand about a place she has heard so_much about . Others , such_as Frank Kaiser from Germany , hope to perfect their English . Have you ever wondered what life as a teen-ager would be like in a different country ? In countries all_over the world , students start learning a foreign language -- often English -- long before reaching high_school . Imagine school six days a week with up_to 13 classes a semester . While this may be unheard of in the United States , it is common practice in other areas of the world . In separate interviews , four exchange students spending a year in Orange County shared some of their opinions on the differences between being a teen-ager here and in their native countries . CECILIA ANDERSON Country : Sweden Age : 17 High_School : Fountain Valley Q : What was your impression of America before you came here ? A : In Sweden , we get all_the American TV_shows like &quot; Roseanne , &quot; &quot; Melrose Place , &quot; &quot; The Cosby Show &quot; and &quot; Arsenio Hall , &quot; so a lot of our ideas about America come from these shows . Before I came here , I thought Americans were all fat people who ate burgers and drank Cokes . Q : What were the first things you noticed when you came_to California ? A : It was a real big culture shock . Everything here is so big , like the parking_lots and freeway lanes . All the stuff is really cheap , too . In Sweden , a Big Mac costs $ 4 ! The best part about America is seeing people from all different cultures living together . That is very impressive . Q : What was something that you were surprised to see in America ? A : I was really surprised to see how nudity is censored here , but not violence . In Sweden , we censor the violence and allow nudity on television , magazines , newspapers , etc . We have less crime . Q : How are American teen-agers different than in Sweden ? A : Teen-agers are so open with each other . They are very nice and easy to talk to . Swedes are very quiet , shy and reserved , but they are also more open-minded . Q : How is dating in America different than in Sweden ? A : In America , dating is very complicated . In Sweden , if you kiss somebody , that means you are going_out with that person . Instead of going_out on dates , we go_out in big groups to dance clubs and parties . Q : How are relationships with parents ? A : Swedish parents are very open-minded . If you have a boyfriend , you are allowed to spend time with him , alone , in your bedroom . Parents realize when you are mature and independent . When they see you can take_care of yourself , they let you make more decisions . Things like teen-age pregnancies are not very common in Sweden , as compared to America , because teen-agers are able to talk to their parents about contraceptives and things like that . We are very well-informed and open with our parents . MAGDA SEHNALOVA Country : Czech Republic High_School : Aliso Niguel Q : Why did you want to study in America ? A : I decided to visit the U.S. to learn English and to learn about the culture . In Europe , we talk_about America all_the time , but nobody knows who the American people really are . I wanted to find_out . Everybody in my country thinks it is great because of all_the American movies they watch . They love the movie_stars , but that ' s all they see about America . Q : How are teen-agers in the Czech Republic different from the ones here ? A : In my country , the teen-agers are not as friendly . They are not very open_to making new friends . In my school you are with the same 30 students for six hours a day , five days a week , and all four years throughout high_school . We do not change classes like we do here . This is why it is hard to meet other people . We do not have sport teams or clubs at school . Q : What kind of government is the Czech Republic ? A : We are a democracy just like America , but we have only been like this since 1989 . Five years ago , our country had a revolution . We switched from communism to a democracy . We have had many changes in the past few years . For example , in school we used to learn about communism and the Russian language . We never learned about other countries or things that did not relate to Russia . After the revolution , we were allowed to learn English . I have been taking the language for three years . Before the revolution , families were not allowed to believe_in religion , because it went_against community principles . Today , my parents are Christians . My dad also owns a firm , which was not possible before 1989 , because the government owned everything . Now , ( the government ) just own things like the railroads . FRANK KAISER Country : Germany Age : 18 High_School : El Dorado Q : How is your school_system different from the one in America ? A : Our school_system is really different . In Germany , teachers change classes , not students . We don ' t have electives until the 11th grade . We get 13 classes a semester . Not all classes meet every single day . Every second Saturday we have to go_to school for four hours , but that ' s only in the &quot; Gymnasium , &quot; which is the highest out of three high-school levels . We have the &quot; Hauptschule , &quot; which is the lowest level , and the &quot; Realschule , &quot; which is the middle . Instead of grading from A to F , we have grades from 1 to 6 -- 1 being the best . We have 13 years of school when we go_through the &quot; Gymnasium , &quot; then you can go_to the University . If you decide to go_to a university , the government will pay your admission_fee . Q : Why did you want to become an exchange student ? A : I like to learn about different cultures . I have been to Russia , England , France , Italy , Spain , Denmark , Holland and many other countries . Most of the people who live_in Europe travel a lot . That is probably why we know more about the world around us , as compared to Americans . I wanted to learn about the daily life in an American family . I also wanted to come_to America to perfect my English , because it will help me get a job . Q : How would you describe the political situation in Germany today ? A : Germany is still going_through a lot of changes because of the unification between East and West Germany in 1991 . It was like two different worlds coming_together . Turning from socialism to a democracy was difficult for East_Germans . They were not used to the freedoms and liberties , which are taken_for granted in America . MARCELLA BARBOSA Country : Brazil Age : 16 High_school : Villa Park Q : Do you think teen-agers are different here ? A : I think they are different in some ways but , deep down , teen-agers have similar problems here and in Brazil . People in Brazil don ' t care how you dress like they do here . Q : What differences do you see between the countries ? How is the Brazilian government different from America ' s ? A : In Brazil , there is a lot of corruption . The politicians know the rain_forests are being destroyed , but they are paid_off by the lumberers , so they don ' t say anything . The government is similar to America because they pay_for public education , but the schools aren ' t good . Those who can afford it go_to private_schools , which are usually in the city . The opportunities teen-agers have to go_to school and be involved are greater in America . In Brazil , if you want to play a sport you have to pay_for it . Q : How is family life different in Brazil than in America ? A : There aren ' t as_many divorces in Brazil as compared to America . Families in Brazil are closer . Q : What are the youth of Brazil mainly concerned about ? A : Our generation is more worried about the political problems . Brazil just impeached a president . Right now we have no future leadership . Young students know a lot about world events . American students only know about America . They aren ' t very aware of the world around them .</TEXT>
