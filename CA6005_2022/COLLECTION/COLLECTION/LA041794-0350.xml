   <HEADLINE> ITALY ' S RIGHT WINS TOP PARLIAMENT POSTS ; EUROPE : THREE-PARTY ALLIANCE HEADED BY BERLUSCONI NOW LOOKS TO GETTING THE PREMIERSHIP , PROBABLY BY MIDWEEK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three months after making his political debut , billionaire Silvio Berlusconi took a decisive stride toward the prime_minister ' s office Saturday when supporters of his right-wing alliance won leadership of both houses of Parliament . He could be named the head of Italy ' s next government by midweek . Berlusconi called Saturday ' s election of new presidents for the Senate and Chamber of Deputies a test of his ability to govern . He passed -- by a whisker . The restive three-party alliance that Berlusconi led to a stunning victory in elections last month easily won in the Chamber of Deputies but only captured the Senate by a single vote . Jubilant supporters of Berlusconi ' s free-market party and its federalist and neo-fascist allies hailed the victories as the first_step on_the_road to what they call a Second Republic , a modern state that overcomes the inefficiency and corruption of its predecessor . In a government-changing ballet performed 52 times in Italy since World_War_II , the installation of parliamentary officers allowed technocrat Prime_Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to submit his resignation , which he did Saturday . Ciampi will remain in office as a caretaker while President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro begins a round of consultations to determine a successor . Berlusconi , as leader of the largest party in the new Parliament , is the inescapable choice . Most observers think Scalfaro will ask him to form a government Wednesday or Thursday . The 59-year-old Milan media and real_estate tycoon -- who also owns supermarkets , Italy ' s largest advertising_agency and the country ' s best soccer team -- is raring to go . Himself one of 452 rookie legislators in the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies , Berlusconi threatened new elections if his candidate did not win in the Senate . And he writhed at the measured pace of legislative life as the Parliament convened for the first time Friday . &quot; Will I always be forced to live this kind of life ? &quot; he asked reporters playfully . &quot; I never have done so little in my life. &quot; Berlusconi ' s free-market Forza Italia ( Go , Italy ) and its allies are a_few votes short of an outright majority among the 315 elected senators and 11 nominated-for-life senators . In the Senate , Forza Italia candidate Carlo Scognamiglio , 50 , a white-bearded economist-executive who is now a university rector , ran_into fierce opposition from supporters of outgoing Senate President Giovanni Spadolini , a former prime_minister and leader of the tiny Republican_Party . For decades , Scognamiglio was the bespectacled and rotund symbol of the political Establishment . Backed by centrists and leftists still smarting from their electoral drubbing by Berlusconi , Spadolini held_off the right-wing candidate in two votes Friday . A third round Saturday ended in a tie . Scognamiglio won the fourth ballot , 162-161 . Then he braced the chamber with a let ' s-work-together maiden speech written_on a single page of notes and delivered in an informal , professorial style so markedly different from Spadolini-era rhetoric and formality that it captured both the changed face and the changed nature of the new legislature . In the Chamber of Deputies , Berlusconi ' s backers hold an absolute_majority , and the victory of the right ' s candidate was never in_question , although she proved more controversial than some of her backers might have liked . Irene Pivetti , a 31-year-old Catholic fundamentalist member of the Northern League , received 346 votes to win the powerful post that is the Italian equivalent of Speaker of the House in the United States . &quot; Your soul to God , your vote to Bossi , &quot; was her campaign slogan , referring to Northern League leader Umberto Bossi . Pivetti ' s Catholicism is so pervasive that she has drawn accusations of anti-Semitism . She dismisses them as &quot; foolishness. &quot; Saturday ' s parliamentary votes represented the first test of unity for members of three alliance parties wed more by a thirst for power than common goals . Bossi distrusts Berlusconi and dislikes alliance partner Gianfranco Fini and the new respectability of neo-fascism .</TEXT>
