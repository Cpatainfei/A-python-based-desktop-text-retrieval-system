   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 / DAILY REPORT ; YOU THOUGHT N.Y. TABLOIDS WERE TOUGH ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Brazil continued to draw criticism back home despite an 8-2 rout of Honduras on Wednesday night in a World Cup warm-up at San Diego . &quot; Brazil Blows Out Honduras , But Makes Many Mistakes , &quot; read a front-page headline in O Globo , a Rio de Janeiro daily . The daily Jornal do Brasil reported that Brazil &quot; didn ' t control the game . We have serious problems. &quot; Soccer writers were merciless . &quot; Rai hasn ' t woken_up , &quot; O Globo said . &quot; He tried to run but his legs didn ' t obey . He missed simple passes , was afraid to create plays , was not daring. &quot; Sergio Noronha , a Rio sports columnist , wrote : &quot; We still have no creativity at midfield . Rai -- despite his goal -- was a complete zero. &quot;</TEXT>
