   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN COURT CLEARS LAST ' 91 ANTI-GORBACHEV PLOTTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the end , not one of the men who plotted to overthrow Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev in the 1991 failed coup will be punished : On Thursday , Gen . Valentin I . Varennikov , the last of 12 defendants , was acquitted of treason by the Military Collegium of the Russian Supreme Court . That brought_to a close a three-year trial that has degenerated from high political drama to disturbing farce . The other leaders of the hard-line August coup , whose collapse brought_on the breakup of the Soviet_Union by the following December , have either died , had the cases against them dismissed because of poor health or been pardoned under a political amnesty declared by Parliament in February . Varennikov , formerly deputy defense minister , was the only defendant to reject the amnesty and demand a trial , where he argued that it was Gorbachev who should be tried_for treason for allowing the Soviet_Union to disintegrate . The 70-year-old general said his only regret was that the coup , which horrified the world , failed . Thursday ' s verdict was greeted by cries of &quot; Thank you ! &quot; from about 150 spectators who have come_to the courtroom each day to cheer Varennikov -- and to heckle Gorbachev , who put_in a cameo appearance last month to denounce the general ' s testimony as &quot; arrogant lies &quot; and &quot; slander. &quot; Varennikov , the former commander of Soviet ground forces , declared his acquittal to be &quot; proof of Mikhail Gorbachev ' s guilt , &quot; and said he would now set_about promoting &quot; the revival of our fatherland. &quot; Varennikov has asked the Russian prosecutor general to press treason charges against Gorbachev and called_on Parliament to hold an inquiry into the breakup of the Soviet_Union . He said it is now up_to the authorities &quot; to decide who should be put_in the dock next. &quot; In exonerating Varennikov , the court noted the general was not a member of the State Emergency Committee but did its bidding on the orders of his boss , then-Defense Minister Dmitri T . Yazov . Hence , the court said , Varennikov was only following orders . Further , the court found no evidence that Varennikov knew his orders were illegal , saying he had no way of knowing his superiors had placed Gorbachev under house_arrest at his vacation_home in the Crimea . Varennikov ' s lawyer asserted that Gorbachev had secretly gone_along with the coup , a charge the Nobel laureate furiously denied . Gorbachev said he was held incommunicado for almost three days while the State Emergency Committee held a news_conference claiming that it had temporarily assumed power because of his illness . The court ruled that Varennikov ' s decision to support the coup did not constitute a betrayal of his country , the Soviet_Union . In a 45-minute reading of the verdict , the court declared Varennikov ' s &quot; goals and interests were not mercenary ones . . . . He was interested only in preserving and strengthening his country , which fully corresponds to the will of the people expressed in the referendum on March 17 , 1991 , &quot; in which Soviet citizens voted to keep the Soviet_Union intact . A Gorbachev spokesman denounced the ruling , saying it sets a dangerous precedent for Russia . &quot; Now anyone who tries to organize a coup , fails , and is put_on trial can say , ' I was following orders ' and get_away with it , &quot; said Vladimir A . Polyakov of the Gorbachev Foundation . &quot; Sometimes , in this country , the boundaries of reason are transcended , &quot; Polyakov added . &quot; You can commit a crime , be put_on trial , be acquitted and become a national hero . This is what happened today. &quot; The only consolation , he said , was that because Varennikov was not a member of the State Emergency Committee , the court ruling cannot be interpreted as meaning that group is blameless ; also at no point did the court say the attempted coup was legal . In his new memoir , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin describes Varennikov as part of the &quot; radical wing of the conspiracy &quot; to overthrow Gorbachev , a man who personified the ambitions of the military-industrial complex . Among other things , Yeltsin writes that , on the first day of the coup , Varennikov made telephone_calls and sent dispatches &quot; demanding that this ' playing democracy ' and ' the opportunist Yeltsin ' be put to a stop. &quot; Still , Varennikov ' s acquittal became all but inevitable Wednesday when prosecutor Arkady Danilov asked the court to find the defendant not_guilty , a move that is permitted under Russian law . The prosecutor general ' s office said Danilov was acting independently but has not said whether it agrees with his actions . The prosecutor ' s office can ask that the case be reviewed by the full Supreme Court , but none of Varennikov ' s foes held_out hope that the verdict would be overturned . Instead , a Yeltsin spokesman tried to play_down the case , saying the trial had become a farce and the acquittal was politically meaningless . &quot; However much Varennikov and the other ' heroes ' of yesterday puff_out their cheeks ( in pride ) , they will receive no political credibility , &quot; the spokesman said . For Gorbachev , who has hinted that he might consider a run_for the Russian presidency in 1996 , the decision was a final humiliation . The man who tried to make the Soviet_Union into a nation ruled by law , not by arbitrary Communist_Party fiat , had agreed to testify at the trial because he said he wanted to see Russians stop solving their problems by force . &quot; we ' ll never accept the law if we forgive everything , &quot; Gorbachev testified . Viktor Yaskin , the court chairman , said he did not doubt that public reaction to the decision would be &quot; mixed. &quot; But he said the decision was based &quot; not on sympathies , antipathies or opinions , but only on the law. &quot;</TEXT>
