   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; DEATH WILL TEST THE STABILITY OF POLITICAL SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This nation ' s much-vaunted political stability will be sorely tested by Wednesday ' s assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , the ruling party ' s presidential candidate and the man who was widely expected to assume the next six-year term as Mexico ' s leader . Mexican officials had expected 1994 to be hailed as their country ' s entry into the First World as a full partner with the United States and Canada in the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Instead , the nation has been racked by violence , with Colosio ' s killing coming_on the heels of the much-publicized kidnaping of a prominent banker and a peasant uprising that left at least 145 people dead . As an indicator of just how anxious people were here Wednesday night , usually talkative analysts were tight-lipped . They were utterly unwilling to speculate on how the Tijuana assassination might affect this country ' s political and economic future . It was anathema to commentators to even discuss the future of Colosio ' s political rival , peace envoy Manuel Camacho Solis . Although his campaign had been eclipsed by the rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas , Colosio had still represented stability and continuity . That stability was an important selling point for NAFTA as it was debated in the U.S. Congress . Colosio was the handpicked successor of outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . His political ascension , as the presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party -- or PRI , as it is known -- occurred as part of a party rite , an archaic national tradition that rescued Mexico from the chaos of civil_war and political murders 65 years ago when the party was founded . The stability that such presidential successions ensured has been the justification for the survival of the PRI amid a growing clamor here for democratic reform . It was unclear how a successor to Colosio will be designated . PRI rules allow the National Executive Committee to call a party convention or anoint a substitute candidate , but no candidate has died campaigning since the PRI was founded . As the Mexican Congress debates reforms aimed at ensuring clean elections and widely seen as a response to the rebels ' demands for democracy , Colosio ' s death is sure to provoke questions about the nation ' s stability for the first time in six decades . Ironically , the assassination came just a day after Camacho Solis said he would not launch a maverick presidential bid , quelling rumors that had kept politicians and financial markets unsettled for months . Camacho Solis , the popular former Mexico_City mayor , had been openly disappointed when his friend Salinas passed_over him in favor of Colosio . His career , however , was revived in mid-January when Salinas sent him to negotiate peace with the Indian rebels who took_control of several southern towns in a New Year ' s Day uprising . In the Byzantine world of Mexican politics , it was even speculated that Salinas was intentionally promoting Camacho Solis to keep Colosio under_control and retain power far longer than a lame-duck president generally does_in his last year . But the assumption that there was such a rivalry caused financial jitters in a country that depends_on foreign investment in the stock_market to offset its multibillion-dollar trade_deficit and to finance investment . Those concerns were compounded when Alfredo Harp Helu , chairman of Mexico ' s largest financial group , was kidnaped earlier this month . He has not yet been released . This week ' s edition of the political magazine Proceso termed that crime &quot; another blow to the administration. &quot; But that was before an assassin ' s bullets dealt Salinas the hardest blow a Mexican president and his party have suffered in decades . * NEW ECONOMIC WORRIES : The shooting of Colosio will aggravate worries about Mexico ' s business climate .
