   <TEXT> The final two heats of four-man bobsled will help conclude the Winter_Olympics today . U.S. drivers Randy Will and Brian Shimer -- 10th and 11th respectively after Saturday ' s first two heats -- are out of contention but not out of bizarre accounts . Improbable ? It ' s as if those trolls of Norwegian legend are riding as brakemen for these guys . Consider : -- Will , reacting to the February cold of Norway as if it were a sudden development , said the ice was too cold for his Austrian-made runners , the steel blades on which the sled rides . The ice of the Olympic chute was 13 degrees below zero Saturday . He said it needed to be 10 degrees warmer . &quot; We had two awesome trips , &quot; he said of the two runs . &quot; The guys pushed their hearts out and I drove 100 % , but our battle is with the temperature . If it ' s warmer , nothing beats me , but this is Norway . I need the DDG runners that the_Swiss and Germans use . They ' re flying here. &quot; Harald Czudaj , driver of Germany II , held a narrow lead over two bobsled legends heading into today ' s competition . Gustav Weder of Switzerland I was . 12 of a second behind , and Wolfgang Hoppe of Germany I was . 18 of a second behind . The Swiss claim to mold their own runners . The Germans use what are called DDGs , made by a factory in Dresden . &quot; Used to be East_Germany , &quot; Will said . &quot; Now it ' s free enterprise. &quot; Did Will , ninth in the 1992 Olympics and retiring after this race , consider buying DDGs in preparation for the cold ? &quot; I don ' t have the $ 5 # 000 , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve already spent $ 70 # 000 on my equipment ( he uses his own Italian-made sled ) the last four years . I ' m just a broke athlete having a blast here , trying to salvage some dignity and do my best for the U.S. &quot; It ' s just a shame getting beat on a technical edge . They ' re just not going_to beat us any other way. &quot; -- Shimer employed the only DDGs to which the U.S. Bobsled Federation had access . In a strange twist , they were rented from driver Bruce Rosselli , who failed to qualify for the Olympic team while using them and subsequently named Shimer and the federation in a conspiracy suit that was rejected in arbitration and in court . Now Shimer and the federation are promising to sue Rosselli for libel and defamation . Thus , on the eve of the Olympics , Shimer went_to an on-and-off the ice antagonist for runners he has never used before , but that ' s not all . He also chose to drive a new sled , borrowing the Bo-Dyn sled that has been used by Jim Herberich , who was eliminated by Will and Shimer in a race-off for the two U.S. Olympic berth . Is this a little chancy ? &quot; Yes , but you never know how sleds are going_to perform under different conditions , &quot; Shimer said . &quot; The way we were going_in the system we were using , I ' d have struggled to finish in the top 10 , and I didn ' t come this far to do that . I mean , I know it ' s a little late for a fresh_start , but I thought it was worth the risk . Besides , there are three different setups with the Bo-Dyn , and we put the steering_system off my sled into this one , so it wasn ' t entirely new. &quot; Shimer jumped from 13th to 11th with the ninth-best time in the second heat and said he was excited about that and the opportunity to move_up even more when he starts early in the third heat on clean ice . &quot; We could be 2 1 / 2 seconds faster or more , &quot; he said . A three-time Olympian , Shimer plans to continue , enthusiastic about the Bo-Dyn project and his hope it will make as much progress in runner development as it has in only two years with the sled itself . &quot; If they continue to receive financial_support , we should have more_than one or two options by the time of the next Olympics , &quot; Shimer said , referring to runners . Said Will : &quot; If I was four years younger and not married I ' d be staying with the Bo-Dyn project , too. &quot; Part of him will be . He said that he had sold his runners to the Bo-Dyn interests . Don ' t look_for their future use in Norway , however . It tends to be brisk here in February .</TEXT>
