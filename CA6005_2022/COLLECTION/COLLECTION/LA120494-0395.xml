   <HEADLINE> CUBA CRISIS GROWS AS CASTRO TRIES TO CRACK_DOWN ON GROWING DISSENT ; CARIBBEAN : SOME ANALYSTS FEAR TENSION COULD ERUPT IN VIOLENCE . SECRET OPPOSITION CELLS REPORTED THROUGHOUT COUNTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Facing intensified popular discontent bordering_on resistance , and caught between conflicting demands by hard-liners and reformers , Fidel Castro is falling deeper into a crisis likely to leave Cuba either more repressive than ever or in the agony of civil violence , foreign experts and Cuban sources say . The country appears placid at the moment , with superficial signs of a slightly improved life_style resulting from more electricity and gasoline and a stronger peso . But interviews with diplomats , military experts and dozens of Cuban sources in Havana and the countryside indicate a society barely under_control . &quot; One can never predict Cuba , &quot; said a European diplomat from a country generally friendly to Castro , &quot; but I think one can say with assurance that there will be dramatic changes here within two years . . . . If I have to predict , I would say that Castro will be able to keep his system only by increasing repression . If he doesn ' t crack_down I don ' t see how he can keep control. &quot; Almost all_the experts and observers say the problem , as it has been since Cuba entered crisis with the collapse of its patron Soviet_Union in 1989 , will be economic . Castro continues to permit some reformist tinkering , including a minor expansion of Cuba ' s tiny self-employed sector and creation of semi-private food and small goods markets . But almost every foreign economist here agrees it is a half-hearted patch that won ' t work . &quot; Industrial capacity is about 20 % , &quot; said an economist with an international_organization . &quot; Real productivity doesn ' t really exist . Even tourism is so inefficiently run that its profits are about 70 % short of what they ought to be. &quot; Worse , others said , is the predicted failure of the next sugar crop , &quot; which could drop to close to 3 million ( metric_tons ) , and that would be a crushing , even disastrous thing , &quot; a European diplomat said . In its best days , the sugar harvest was 8 million metric_tons , even 10 million metric_tons . But a combination of poor planning and horrid weather has left Cuba with less than half that . The last crop dropped to 4.3 million metric_tons , severely restricting the country ' s ability to obtain foreign currency . &quot; If all this continues and Castro continues blocking meaningful economic reform , the public won ' t stand_by , and neither will Castro , &quot; the European diplomat said . &quot; If there is another round of riots like last summer , you will see a far tougher reaction. &quot; To many dissidents , the added repression is already under way . Anti-Castro human_rights groups report heavy harassment , including arbitrary arrests , constant surveillance and economic punishment . &quot; People who join us or attend our meetings are losing their jobs , &quot; said a woman who leads a semi-clandestine dissident group . &quot; When I tried to attend a meeting I was invited to by the Canadian Embassy , I was detained and kept_in jail for a day . Even my friends and a nephew who are dissidents are being punished just because they know me or are related. &quot; Human_rights officers in several embassies support the assessment of increased repression , with one diplomat saying at least 44 dissidents were arrested in October , with some held for up_to three weeks without charge or hearings . Worse , according to another diplomat , is the economic punishment . &quot; It is difficult to live here in the best of times , &quot; he said . &quot; Now , if you are suspected of opposition , you will lose what little support you had , your job , your house . If you turn_to family or friends , then they ' ll be punished . &quot; It ' s a quiet repression , &quot; the diplomat said , &quot; but it ' s harsh and getting more so. &quot; A diplomat from another country with relatively good relations here agreed that Castro is cracking_down hard but said an even heavier government hand isn ' t likely to stop the crisis and may even backfire . If Castro &quot; doesn ' t tighten the screws and doesn ' t really reform ( the economy ) , what we saw last summer will be a frolic compared to the popular anger that is bound to occur , &quot; the diplomat said . He was referring to sometimes violent protests and demonstrations that began in April , were repeated throughout the summer and climaxed with more_than 30 # 000 Cubans setting_out for the United States in every imaginable sea-going conveyance . Castro let them go then , even encouraging the departures in an effort to embarrass the United States and force negotiations on ending a three-decade economic embargo . Most experts now expect him to crack_down on any renewed public dissent . &quot; But , &quot; said the same diplomat , &quot; if he really moves toward totalitarian control , he ' s likely to set_off an earthquake of discontent that could end in violent opposition. &quot; A former Communist_Party leader in Santiago , the country ' s second largest city and traditionally a focus of Castro support , observed : &quot; I never thought I would see it and I never thought I wanted to see it , but Fidel is losing Cuba. &quot; This man , recently removed as a local party first secretary by the army , asked not to be named . But he said the discontent in his region is barely kept below the surface and is leading to the creation of dissident groups , including secret opposition cells . A reporter who spent two days with members of such groups was taken_to meetings in both cities and in the countryside . One of the meetings occurred in a mountain village between Camaguey and Santiago . No weapons were evident and the six dissidents said they had no plans for an armed revolt , at least not in the near future . &quot; What we want right now is simply to create organizations , &quot; said the former Communist . &quot; We are following Fidel ' s pattern , &quot; he said , explaining that the dissidents were building a popular following_through creation of small , semi-secret cells . &quot; As the people become more and more discontented , they know we will be here with a framework of opposition. &quot; He would not say how many people belonged_to his group or how many cells existed . &quot; We don ' t even have a name right now , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re just people who think the revolution has been betrayed and Castro has failed. &quot; The leader , a man in his early 40s who did all_the talking , nearly yelled when he denied being linked to older , Havana-based dissident groups , particularly those in contact with American diplomats . &quot; Look , those people are either fronts for the Americans or they have been infiltrated by Castro ' s security , &quot; he said . &quot; Understand , we are not against the revolution and we don ' t want American capitalism . But we are tired_of no food , no work and we will not accept any more government terror. &quot; It is almost impossible to judge the strength of the groups , if they are true organizations or whether they present any threat to Castro . But interviews with private Cuban citizens , as well as the assessments of several diplomats and experts , point to a serious increase in public frustration and anger . In Cojimar , a beachside neighborhood near Havana of shabby , fallen-down workers ' houses and the site of several earlier violent protests , idle men and boys sit on door steps , grumbling . &quot; There is nothing here , &quot; said Jacobo Alonso , an out-of-work electrician who is living_on the money he charged to help build rafts for people who set_out for the United States from Cojimar . With several of his friends nodding in_agreement and mumbling about getting_even , Alonso said &quot; there will be a next time when the police won ' t be able to stop us . We used to believe Fidel that the ( American ) blockade was the problem and that he would repair things and that socialism would cure all , but that ' s a lie. &quot; A greater sign of deepening public disillusion , according to some experts , has been the deterioration of the neighborhood defense committees established early on by Castro . These groups served multiple functions , ranging from outright spying on the neighborhood to dispensing ration books to ensuring streets were swept and yards were kept free_of pigs . &quot; They ' ve all but collapsed , &quot; said a diplomat who lives next door to the chairman of his neighborhood committee . &quot; There are even pigs in her yard . Nobody shows_up to sweep the streets , and people are just staying away. &quot; More important in the deflating of the defense groups than dirty streets is their loss of authority and importance in the daily struggle for a decent life . &quot; The committees are the grass roots of Castroism , &quot; said a foreign businessman who has lived_in Havana for two years . &quot; You couldn ' t get a ( food ) ration or keep a job if the committee thought you were unreliable . &quot; On the other hand , if you belonged and were_active , you got privileges , &quot; he recalled . &quot; That people are no longer afraid or that they find the committees ineffective in making life easier means the failure of one of Castro ' s major elements of control. &quot; A representative of a government that once backed Castro said he thinks that all_of these developments are combining for disaster : &quot; Castro may survive for another year or two or even three , but I don ' t see how he can do_it without either real reform or heavy pressure on the people . . . . In the past when he went_after his opponents , the masses supported him . But now he will have lost that support . I think you are looking_at disaster. &quot;</TEXT>
