   <HEADLINE> WHEN PETS GET SICK AS A DOG , INSURANCE HELPS ON BILLS ; ANIMALS : POLICY ELIMINATES DILEMMA FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN CARING FOR PET AND FEEDING FAMILY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Rev . Bradley Wirth considers the health_insurance he bought for Oliver Wendell Wirth -- a 15-year-old &quot; terrier-poodle-cocker and , we ' ve always said , Presbyterian &quot; -- almost providential . The All Saints Episcopal Church priest , concerned about Oliver ' s difficulty navigating steps , took the dog in_for X-rays . Two large bladder_stones were discovered , requiring surgery last January . The $ 930 operation cost Wirth $ 176 . &quot; In my role as a priest , I have seen people agonize over medical procedures for their pets , &quot; he said . &quot; ( Insurance ) was an absolute godsend for us , and I think it would be for other folks. &quot; Pet insurance costs an average of $ 75 a year , but it is unusual . Only one major multi-state carrier provides nationwide coverage , and a major insurer that had offered it quit because it sold few policies . Smaller plans , akin to HMOs , are springing_up , however -- which is how Wirth covered Oliver . Without such coverage , an owner may have to choose between healing his pet and feeding his family . Dr. Scott Matheson , medical director for the Family Veterinary Hospital ' s All Pet Complex in Taylorsville , Utah , noted that the cost of emergency veterinary_medicine can exceed many clients ' budgets . &quot; A real common example is a dog or cat that gets hit by a car , &quot; he said . &quot; If it has a single broken bone , it would not be uncommon to have surgery , and that ' s $ 800 to $ 1 # 000. &quot; &quot; We find that the vast majority of pet owners don ' t really take proper care of their pets , &quot; Matheson said . &quot; A lot of times , the option that people choose is euthanasia . &quot; that ' s frustrating when perhaps 80 % of all euthanasias are unnecessary . We would rather be able to treat these animals and get them back to their families. &quot; In a country that spent nearly $ 7 billion on veterinary care_for dogs and cats in 1991 , pet health_insurance might seem to be a logical growth_industry . &quot; Basically , we think it ' s a great idea , &quot; said Katherine Brant , spokeswoman for the Humane Society of Utah . &quot; Many people deeply devoted to their companion animals will quite often put their companion ' s health_care needs ahead of their own. &quot; Last year , Family Veterinary Hospital launched a three-tiered dog and cat health plan . So far , more_than 200 pet owners have signed_up , and Matheson expects enrollment to reach 400 to 500 by year ' s end . Wirth is one of the policyholders . Here ' s how it works : A $ 10-a-month plan offers vaccinations , other routine treatments and savings on spays and neuters . For $ 7.50 more , the plan extends discounts to medical , surgical , prescription and laboratory services . A $ 25 monthly payment covers the full cost of medical , surgical and lab work_up to $ 500 , and half the cost above that . Matheson said the prepaid options are more akin to human health_maintenance_organizations than to traditional third-party insurance plans , dozens of which have failed in the pet care market in recent decades . The latest to go_under was the Fireman ' s Fund Insurance Co. ' s Medipet program , which quit writing new policies on April 4 . John Kozero , spokesman for the Novato , Calif.-based firm , said less than 7 # 000 pet owners signed_up during a three-year trial run . &quot; An awful lot of people showed interest , but after they received the brochures , very few sent_in checks , &quot; he said . That left the nation ' s largest pet health insurer , Veterinary Pet Insurance , without major competition . The Anaheim , Calif. , company has issued more_than 500 # 000 policies in 39 states since it was founded 14 years ago . Premiums average $ 75 a year . &quot; We cover accidents or illnesses . In that sense , it ' s pretty much the same as regular ( human ) health_insurance , &quot; said Vice_President Richard Stephens . &quot; Elective surgeries , spays , neuters and routine care aren ' t covered. &quot; That leaves plenty of room for small-scale , prevention-oriented pet health plans such_as Matheson ' s . The American Veterinary Medical Assn . recently appointed an executive panel to explore the pet insurance issue . &quot; Everybody seems to be very interested in this , &quot; said spokesman Mike Walters , reached at the association ' s offices in Schaumburg , Ill . In 1991 , the last year for which the AVMA has figures , Americans owned 52.5 million dogs and 57 million cats . Dog owners spent nearly $ 4.6 billion on veterinary care ; cat owners more_than $ 2.3 billion . Walters argued that dogs and cats are better risks than people . &quot; If you consider that a lot of health_problems may be the result of voluntary or discretionary but unsafe activities -- drinking , smoking or riding motorcycles without helmets -- animals don ' t engage in those activities , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
