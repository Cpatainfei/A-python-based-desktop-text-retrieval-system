   <HEADLINE> WARDEN OUSTED AT TROUBLED STATE_PRISON IN LANCASTER ; CORRECTIONS : OFFICIALS ORDER OTIS THURMAN TO RETIRE OR ACCEPT A DEMOTION . FOUR ESCAPES , INCLUDING ONE BY A CONVICTED MURDERER , HAVE PLAGUED THE YEAR-OLD PRISON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a surprise move , officials have told the warden at the state_prison in Lancaster either to retire or accept a demotion -- probably the result of a series of problems that have plagued the year-old prison , including the escapes of a convicted murderer and three other inmates . &quot; The California Department of Corrections has made a decision to restructure the management team ( at the Lancaster prison ) . . . . Otis Thurman , warden , has yet to determine which options available to him would be in his best interest and has decided to take some time_off , &quot; said a brief statement issued Friday by state_prison officials . * No other details were released , but several members of the prison ' s citizens advisory committee said they were told that Thurman ' s options were to retire -- after more_than three decades as a Corrections Department employee -- or accept a demotion and be transferred to another institution . &quot; I was notified Thursday the warden was being asked to take a demotion and / or retire , &quot; said Jake Maeders , a committee_member . The sudden shake-up also includes the demotion and transfer of Thurman ' s second in command at the 4 # 000-inmate prison . Chief Deputy Warden Alex Marmolejo has been reassigned to an associate warden ' s position at the state_prison in Tehachapi , state officials said . Advisory committee_members said they were given little information and were surprised that Thurman was being replaced . * But committee_member George Root , a Lancaster councilman , said he wasn ' t surprised . &quot; I think ( Thurman ' s ) problem was he was too laid-back , &quot; Root said . &quot; I ' m really happy the Department of Corrections saw fit to remove the warden and his deputy as a first_step to reorganization of the management staff. &quot; Root and other advisory committee_members said the shake-up is the result of the four escapes , including that of two maximum security inmates , and other problems that have occurred since the prison opened Feb . 1 , 1993 . The first escapes occurred five months after the prison opened . On July 2 , two minimum-security inmates , one serving time for burglary and the other for robbery , walked away from their barracks . Both were recaptured . On Oct . 5 , convicted murderer Eric Rene Johnson escaped_from the maximum-security unit . Johnson , serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole , was seen about five hours after his escape at a Lancaster convenience_store , a_few miles from the prison . Johnson ' s escape triggered an uproar in the community . Prison officials waited more_than two hours after they suspected the escape to notify the local sheriff ' s station . The Lancaster City_Council was not told for more_than 12 hours , after Johnson was recaptured . The escape and how it was handled led community leaders to abandon plans to support the construction of a second state_prison in Lancaster . * On Jan . 13 , Steven Charles Brigida , a maximum-security inmate , escaped by hiding in a garbage bin . He was dumped with the trash into a truck and later deposited at a Lancaster landfill . The prisoner , who was serving a sentence of life plus eight years for attempted murder , suffered broken ribs . The prison and Thurman have been criticized for failing to keep the community informed about the escapes . And members of the citizens advisory committee have become frustrated by their inability to pass_on information to residents . Reports on investigations into the escapes have not been released . &quot; We need to have openness , &quot; said James Lott , advisory committee chairman . &quot; We cannot have a perception they ' re hiding things at the prison. &quot; Andrew Banks , a correctional officer at the prison , said that employee morale has been low since word of Thurman ' s departure spread . &quot; As far as I know he was well-liked , &quot; said Banks , president of the local chapter of the California Correctional Peace_Officers Assn . Banks is skeptical that the shake-up will reduce escapes . &quot; New management won ' t make a difference . Nothing ' s foolproof ; you try to do all_the security measures you can. &quot;</TEXT>
