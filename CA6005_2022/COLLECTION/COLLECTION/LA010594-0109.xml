   <HEADLINE> STATIC FOR A HERO ; SCOUT USES CB IN RESCUE , BUT SOME WANT TO PULL HIS PLUG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 20-year-old Explorer Scout who helped save six people aboard a boat stranded off Dana Point said Tuesday his homeowners association wants to fine him for using his citizens band radio in the rescue . On the night of Dec . 28 , Richard Wright and two other CB operators answered a distress call from an 18-foot pleasure_boat . Through questions and communication relays , they guided a Coast Guard helicopter and Orange County sheriff ' s patrol_boats to the stricken vessel five miles offshore . But Wright said his good deed did not impress the homeowners group . &quot; The president of the association called our manager , and he notified my mom that they want to fine me $ 150 for using my CB radio inside the association grounds , &quot; said Wright , a member of Explorers Post 540 . Ron Meixell , president of the 124-member Moulton Parkway Assn . No . 1 , confirmed that the group ' s board will decide at its meeting next week whether to fine Wright . Meixell contended that Wright was notified of the possible fine when he used the CB a week before the rescue . Meixell said Wright had promised three months ago to stop using his CB radio after several condo owners complained that it interfered with their cordless telephones and television reception . &quot; I think he and his mother are simply using this rescue thing to help them out , &quot; Meixell said . But Wright said he was notified of the possible fine shortly after he used the CB to assist in the rescue . The Coast Guard is clearly on Wright ' s side . In a letter to the association , a ranking officer called it &quot; ludicrous to fine the boy for saving lives. &quot; &quot; If it wasn ' t for his helping us , &quot; Petty Officer Randolph Reid added Tuesday , &quot; it could have ended_up in serious injury or loss of life to the boater and his family. &quot; It ' s not the first time Wright has won praise for his actions . In 1992 , he was recommended for a certificate of valor from the Orange County Fire_Department after he kicked open the door of a burning condo and searched for people possibly trapped inside . He found no one but broke_out a window to help a family ' s dog and hamsters escape . In October , he and other Explorers who are part of an emergency services squad assisted with emergency vehicles at the Laguna Beach fire . A week later , the same post volunteered to help line muddy streets in Laguna Beach with sandbags after rainfall caused damage from flooding . His latest adventure involved two other CB operators , Richard Bianchini , a Mission Viejo teen-ager , and another CB user known only as Shorty . The skipper , Jose Santana of Anaheim , was aboard the vessel with his wife , two children and two other adults without flashlights and only a_few blankets , Reid said . Through a series of questions and communication relays , the three radio operators were able to approximate the boat ' s bearings and forward the information to the Coast Guard . Wright said he kept an open line to the Coast Guard while relaying messages through the two CB radio operators . From time to time , the signal was weak , Wright said , and one of the three operators would lose or gain the signal during the three-hour rescue operation . &quot; We first got the Mayday about 5 o ' clock , &quot; Wright said . &quot; And it took us about an hour to find_out where the ( boater ) was . The whole_thing ended like close to 8 at night. &quot;</TEXT>
