   <HEADLINE> CONDO Q &amp; A : WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR QUAKE REPAIRS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : I serve on the board of directors in a condominium association whose property was damaged in the Northridge earthquake . The association does not have earthquake insurance . There is damage to the common areas of the building as well as some interior damage in several of the condominium units . Is the association responsible_for all repairs ? What , if anything , would the unit owners be responsible_for repairing ? What about balconies that are designated as &quot; exclusive use common area &quot; in the association ' s legal_documents ? Can the association apply for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) or should the individual owners apply ? ANSWER : Your legal_documents should be reviewed by the association ' s attorney to determine responsibility for specific repairs . If your association has not consulted an attorney in the past , I recommend that you contact an attorney who specializes in community association law . The attorney will refer to your association ' s condominium plan and the declaration of covenants , conditions and restrictions ( CC &amp; Rs ) to find_out where the association ' s responsibility ends and the owners ' responsibilities begin . In general , the association is responsible_for repairing the structure of the building and all common areas . For instance , common area includes the common walls , the framing , studs and wallboard . The unit owner is responsible_for the paint or wall covering or other improvements on the interior surface of the perimeters of the unit . Therefore , tiles that fell from the bathroom wall or a broken shower door in an individual unit would be the unit owner ' s responsibility to fix . Regarding exclusive use common area , many associations have CC &amp; Rs that state that the owner is responsible_for maintaining areas such_as garage spaces , entry doors and balconies . The state law clarifies maintenance responsibility if your documents are unclear regarding exclusive use common area . Many attorneys believe that the owner ' s responsibility to maintain in this context means keeping the area clean , and possibly even repainting as the need arises , but the owner ' s responsibility would not extend_to major balcony repairs of a structural nature . The board of directors should rely_on expert legal advice regarding the meaning of the documents and the California laws that apply in your situation . The association can apply for FEMA assistance and then your association will be referred to the Small Business Administration for a loan_application . Lisa Cookie , public information officer of the SBA , states that the individual owners also can apply for assistance in paying one lump-sum special_assessment that the association ' s board or membership approves . The association or individual owners can apply for assistance prior to determining the specific amount of damage or the total cost of repairs . Subsequently , the loan can be declined if you find that it is not needed . The association ' s board of directors can vote to use reserve_funds for emergency repairs_to the common area and other related expenses such_as hiring structural engineers and other experts . The board should then replenish the reserves by approving an emergency or special_assessment . Proper 30-day notice must be redistributed to all_of the owners prior to the due_date for the special or emergency assessment . The board can approve a special_assessment that is less than or equal_to 5 % of the current year ' s total assessment . If the association ' s expenses exceed the 5 % ceiling , the board has two choices . They can either submit the special_assessment to the owners for approval or they can approve an emergency assessment and distribute the necessary documentation to the owners . Since the earthquake recovery expenses were an unforeseen expense at the time that the current fiscal_year ' s budget was adopted , the board of directors has the authority to approve an unlimited emergency assessment . The board should consult an attorney to be certain that the association complies with all requirements of the legal_documents and the California Civil Code , Section 1366 . The individual owners can also apply to SBA for assistance to pay_for repairs within their units . Again , if you find that the assistance is not needed , you can decline it in the future . How Does Board Start Picking Up Pieces ? Q : Our condominium was damaged extensively by the earthquake . Although we have earthquake insurance coverage , the insurance deductible is a major expense that some of our owners will probably be unable to pay . Some unit owners have told the board of directors that they plan to abandon their units . It appears that the association may be unable to rebuild even with the insurance proceeds . There are so many complex issues that my fellow board_members and I need some advice so that we can set some priorities . Where do we start ? A : For many association board_members , aftershocks aren ' t the only cause of sleepless nights . As board_members , in addition to your own personal losses and concerns , you must deal with the association matters too . You are undoubtedly getting numerous phone_calls from anxious owners wanting to know what is being done . You should not be embarrassed to tell the other unit owners that you just don ' t have all_of the answers yet . I recommend that the board schedule a special meeting of owners to let them know what is happening and what the board is doing . If possible , invite the association ' s attorney , insurance_agent , manager and any other professional who can assist the board in answering the owners ' questions . Attorney Leonard Siegel , with the law_firm of Wilner , Klein &amp; Siegel in Beverly Hills , recommends that the board ' s first priority is to review the association ' s declaration ( CC &amp; Rs ) concerning destruction and condemnation of the project . The law_firm has prepared an excellent checklist for community association boards of directors that are dealing with post-earthquake issues . The checklist states , &quot; Most likely , the CC &amp; Rs of your association will contain provisions that will require that the board take certain actions as a result of the earthquake . Because the CC &amp; Rs of your association are unique , your board should review your CC &amp; Rs for pertinent provisions with the assistance of the association ' s attorney . &quot; For example , CC &amp; Rs of a community association may contain provisions which require that the structures be rebuilt where damage is extensive , provided that insurance proceeds are sufficient to finance some percentage ( often 85 % ) of the costs of rebuilding the project . Likewise , your CC &amp; Rs may require that the board initiate the reconstruction pursuant to existing plans . However , if the board wishes to modify these plans , your CC &amp; Rs may provide that reconstruction in accordance with modified plans requires approval of some percentage of the association ' s members and some percentage of the holders of the first trust_deed ( ' senior lenders ' ) . &quot; If the insurance funds are not sufficient to finance the stipulated percentage of the rebuilding costs , your CC &amp; Rs may provide that rebuilding may only be initiated with the approval of members and senior lenders . Your CC &amp; Rs also probably address how insurance proceeds must be distributed , to whom and on what basis . &quot; In the event your project will not be rebuilt , your CC &amp; Rs probably authorize the partitioning of units , and require that certain notices be made . &quot; Finally , if the buildings of your project have been condemned , your CC &amp; Rs should address how these condemnation proceeds are to be distributed , to whom and on what basis . You must review your CC &amp; Rs to determine the rights and obligations of your board and your members. &quot; I have added some of my comments and summarized Wilner , Klein &amp; Siegel ' s checklist of steps that the board of directors should take : 1 -- Notify the homeowners about damage , liability and other issues as soon as reliable information can be obtained . Try to limit the information to statements of fact that can be substantiated . Be sure to disclose the statements or conditions that need further research or clarification and put a date on the material that is distributed . As the information is updated or revised , owners will be able to see from the date which information is most reliable . If the board has consulted with independent sources or professionals , inform the owners . For example , your notice could state , &quot; The board of directors has been advised by the association ' s insurance_agent that . . . . &quot; 2 -- Apply for Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance . Call FEMA at ( 800 ) 462-9029 or ( 800 ) 525-0321 . They will mail to you the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) loan_application . All loans are processed through the SBA . 3 -- Obtain a list of all senior lenders ( first mortgagees ) for all_of the condominium units . Your insurance_agent may be able to help with this . The association CC &amp; Rs probably state that the senior lenders have the right_to_vote on any decision not to reconstruct and the senior lenders are entitled to their pro rata share of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards . 4 -- Notify the lenders and the unit owners of any actions that may require their approval . Some lenders may have already filed an official request for notification of any occurrence that may affect their interests . 5 -- If any units are uninhabitable , advise the owners to check their individual insurance_policies to see if relocation expenses are covered . The owner should check with their insurance_agent regarding the specific coverage and then keep records of reasonable expenses resulting from the relocation . I assume that most insurance_companies will challenge a claim that includes five-star accommodations with caviar on the room service bills . Many hotels are offering discount_rates to those who are displaced by the earthquake . The owners may have earthquake coverage under their individual condominium owners ' insurance_policies . One of the options available is &quot; earthquake loss assessment coverage , &quot; which protects the unit owner when a special_assessment is approved by the board or the association members . 6 -- The board should retain a structural engineer as soon as possible to identify the extent of the damage and estimate the cost of repairs and the estimated time that repairs will require . The board should consult the association ' s attorney for referrals to engineers , architects and other professionals . Relying_on the advice of these professionals will tend to reduce the board ' s liability . 7 -- Adopt a plan for funding the reconstruction . The board must decide how the insurance deductible will be paid and how to finance any repairs that are not covered by insurance . Consult the association ' s attorney regarding the procedures for special_assessments and emergency assessments . 8 -- If the association is already a party to a loan agreement , consult the lender regarding deferred loan payments , an increase in the line_of_credit or any other special benefits that the lender might offer to the association . Advise owners to check with their mortgages about deferred loan payments or other special arrangements that will temporarily ease their financial burden . 9 -- Review vendor contracts and equipment leases if revision or termination seems advisable . Consult your attorney regarding any changes that are needed . 10 -- Advise homeowners to contact the county assessor ' s office about a reassessment of the property_taxes on their unit . 11 -- Inform homeowners about their responsibility for repairs_to the interior of their units . Wilner , Klein &amp; Siegel ' s advice is , &quot; Under the CC &amp; Rs of your association , homeowners may be responsible_for the repair of damage to the interior of their units ( including the interior surfaces of walls , ceilings and floors ) , as well as fixtures and personal_property in the units , to the extent that these damages are not covered under the association ' s master insurance_policy . Typically , this will be true if there is not major exterior damage to your project. &quot; After consulting an attorney , the board ' s written notice to the owners should cite the attorney ' s advice regarding the owners ' responsibilities . 12 -- Consider hiring a construction engineer and / or architect before hiring a contractor . Most of the law_firms that I have talked with advise associations to complete the repair work that the structural engineer has recommended . Damage must be inspected , reconstruction plans need to be designed and specifications need to be prepared so that contractors can submit competitive bids . A construction engineer or architect may be able to assist the board in reviewing the bids , inspecting the work of the contractor as it progresses and interfacing with the insurance carriers . The additional cost can be submitted as part of the insurance_claim . Wilner , Klein &amp; Siegel advises the association board to &quot; exercise the same care with this reconstruction as you would with any construction project your association undertakes . Many of our clients advise us that they are under great pressure to reconstruct their project as quickly as possible , even if this means neglecting to take the kind of precautions they would take under ordinary circumstances . These precautions include soliciting competitive bids , checking references , having your construction agreement reviewed by the association ' s attorney , and monitoring the work performed to ensure that no payments are made unless the work to date has been satisfactory and all lien releases have been obtained . &quot; Although exercising this level of care may delay the date your project is reconstructed by several weeks or more , these precautions are essential . A year from now , if your project has been reconstructed properly , no homeowner will care that the board proceeded methodically . However , if in the upcoming year the workmanship is so poor that the board has to hire a substitute contractor to complete the job , and at great additional time and expense , no homeowner will forget and many may_not forgive the board. &quot; Free Quake Seminar A free seminar for homeowner association directors and members entitled &quot; After the Quake : Rights , Responsibilities and Relief &quot; will be presented from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday , Feb . 26 , at the Encino Community_Center , 4935 Balboa Blvd. , Encino , by the greater Los Angeles chapter of Community Assns . Institute . Speakers will include representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , Small Business Administration ( SBA ) , California disaster-recovery agencies and Michael Kennedy , from Sunrise Bank in San Francisco , who will share his experiences of community associations ' recovery from the Loma Prieta quake . Marc Goldsmith , an attorney with the law_firm of Wilner , Klein &amp; Siegel , will explain whether condominium associations or the individual owners are responsible_for uninsured damage to homes . He will also talk_about the associations ' authority and owners ' rights regarding reconstruction , special_assessments , approval of bids and the decision not to rebuild . Insurance_agents Timothy Cline and Steve Segal will discuss what kinds of earthquake-related damages are covered under an association ' s fire-and-casualty policy without earthquake endorsements and the types of losses that are included and excluded under typical association and condo owners ' earthquake policies . Disaster-recovery resource materials from several government_agencies and the Red_Cross will be available . Call Kathleen Daniels at ( 310 ) 285-8286 for more information .</TEXT>
