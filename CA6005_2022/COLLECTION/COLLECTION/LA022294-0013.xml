   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / RAMSEY CLARK : IRAQ EMBARGO IS KILLING KIDS ; END IT NOW ; THE UNITED NATIONS SHOULD DECLARE SUCH ECONOMIC ASSAULTS TO BE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the fourth consecutive February , I have made the long road trip to Iraq under embargo . First it was to assess the effect of the U.S. bombing that became an admitted 110 # 000 aerial sorties , 88 # 500 tons of bombs -- seven Hiroshimas -- augmented by many rockets and missiles including 56 # 000 with depleted uranium tips . Most of the civilian targets were admittedly chosen to accelerate the effect of the sanctions : water_supply facilities , food production and distribution including poultry and livestock operations , and food processing plants . The deadliness of the sanctions initiated in August , 1990 , was already clear in February , 1991 . The director of the Red Crescent of Iraq estimated 6 # 000 dead children , most infants needing milk supplement and simple medicines , others from dehydration . In the following years , I observed the devastating effect of the blockade on the entire population . Through 1991 and 1992 , thousands died monthly as a direct result of the sanctions , including epidemics and large increases in infectious_diseases arising from the lack of vaccines and destroyed sanitation facilities . In 1993 , deaths above the normal rate caused by the blockade exceeded 125 # 000 . It takes little thought to know who is first and most affected by the economic blockade of a whole nation . It is the poor , their infants , children , chronically ill and elderly . Most of the more_than 375 # 000 who have died in Iraq have been from these three groups . Others have suffered terribly . There are thousands of undersized infants , weighing less than 5 1 / 2 pounds at birth , tens of thousands of victims of kwashiorkor and and marasmus , forms of malnutrition virtually unknown in Iraq before the Gulf crisis . The little bodies and limbs waste away , the belly bloats . The chronically ill often die for the lack of insulin , or medicines for heart , lung , liver , kidney or other common ailments . Cases requiring surgery -- performed in only a_few hospitals for want of anesthetics , sutures , gloves and compresses -- must wait . The elderly live through their last_days without sufficient food or even common painkillers like aspirin . Food consumption for the country is half what it was before the embargo . Available medicine is less than 15 % of before . The sanctions are a weapon of mass destruction attacking an entire nation at once , injuring all physically , mentally and spiritually . Severe physical handicaps will afflict many who survive . The life_expectancy for the whole population is radically reduced . Tragically , hundreds of millions on the planet suffer a similar fate because those with power fail to act to end hunger , starvation , sickness and epidemics . The people of Iraq suffer because the United Nations , coerced by the United States , has acted knowingly and deliberately to cause their suffering . This takes a terrible toll on faith in the future and belief that the Untied Nations seeks justice and to end the scourge of war . In times of the most dangerous war , even if required to avoid defeat , international_law prohibits assaults on the civilian sector . All humanitarian law has strived to preserve nonmilitary parts of society , to prevent the use of cruel weapons of death and weapons of mass destruction . How then is it possible that the United Nations would authorize the cruelest weapon for destruction of the masses , knowing its first and primary effect will be_on the poor , infants , children , sick people and those we should respect most , our elders ? And that in time of peace . There can be no possible justification or avoidance of responsibility for these deaths . If law prohibits even minimal assault on civilians in time of war , when a government will not surrender , can it permit peacetime assault on an entire nation when its government will not submit , hitting the poorest and the weakest hardest and killing the most fragile ? The sanctions against Iraq must end immediately . Time taken_to save face or find an excuse will cost several hundred lives each day , more_than five times the 68 deaths at the market at Sarajevo that so rightfully outraged the world . Yet who bears the greater culpability , soldiers facing the horror of prolonged combat in the midst of mindless violence or heads_of_state and diplomats in cool reflection who unleash the worst horsemen of the apocalypse on the children and babies and sick and grandparents while cursing the evil of their adversary ? Only the prohibition of sanctions by the United Nations and a new covenant proclaiming economic assaults on a whole people to be a crime against humanity will show we can learn from the mistakes of the past . Only then will these tragic deaths not have been entirely in vain .</TEXT>
