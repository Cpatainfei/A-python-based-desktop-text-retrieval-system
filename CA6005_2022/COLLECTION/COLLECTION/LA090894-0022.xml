   <HEADLINE> SCHOOL LUNCHES ; PINK POTATOES ? YUM !</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Believe me , I know : You ' re harried , you ' ve occasionally left the house with a hole in your sock , grooming is but a fond memory , and your 5-year-old thinks that the words &quot; past your bedtime &quot; are the doorway to paradise . To top it off , now you have to pack lunch five days a week for a tiny tyrant who is absolutely capable of deciding , in the time it takes_for cheese to melt , that he hates the quesadilla he couldn ' t live without when you dropped everything to make_it five minutes ago . Worse yet , you are the primary target of that most powerful of combines , the convenience_food / entertainment_industry complex , a synergistic cabal of businesses whose sole mission in life is to convince you that kids don ' t eat unless you serve them packaged food imprinted with a favorite character ' s likeness or endorsement . But don ' t cave_in . The truth is , you ' re in a much more powerful position than you realize , once you understand the basic tenets of pre-pubescent food service . First , realtors are not the only ones who talk_about &quot; pride of ownership. &quot; A cooking kid ( or even just a mixing kid ) is an eating kid . Second , grammar schoolers still want to grow_up to be like mom or dad , which can mean eating what the grown-ups eat . This particular yearning will soon evaporate and be replaced by weary disdain , so take_advantage of it while you can . And , third , never forget that your child cannot yet read your cookbooks and so does not know anything about truly authentic regional Italian cuisine or instructions such_as , &quot; Serve piping hot. &quot; * Kindergartners are intensely aware of how dependent they are . They can ' t drive , can ' t read the newspaper , can ' t even order the double chocolate sundae with nuts unless their parents tell them it ' s on the menu . Refusing to eat -- or insisting on the same marginal cuisine , lunch in and lunch out -- is one of their most effective power_plays . It may be scary when a lunch box comes_home untouched , but the child will not starve ; a growing kid ' s hunger will win out long before you have to resort_to soda_pop and potato_chips . If the kid ' s requests are more nutritionally sound than that , though , give_in . I know one boy who embarked_on a white diet in elementary_school . He ate white food -- cottage_cheese , plain noodles , white_bread , milk . Ten years later he ' s a star swimmer , entering the freshman_class at Harvard . So stand your ground , but be prepared to lighten_up . What I mean is this : Lunch-box food does not have to fit the standard 1960s sandwich / juice / piece of fruit or carrot_sticks paradigm . Neither does_it have to reflect recent box-office grosses . Nutritionists periodically step onto the breakfast soapbox and remind us that we don ' t have to eat traditional breakfast_foods at breakfast ; the important thing is to eat a decent meal . The same holds true , with mild constraints on size and perishability , at lunch . Today it ' s much easier to pack a lunch than it used to be , thanks primarily to the housewares companies . They are making hard plastic containers that eliminate squished food , are easy to open and even protect the environment by replacing disposable plastic food bags . The juice boxes , with their own built-in straws , really are leakproof -- and , according to one grateful kindergarten teacher , eliminate the juice geysers you get with containers that must be punctured with a straw . At least one company is also selling a line of containers with larger-than-usual tab closings , big enough for a small hand to grasp and open ( the traditional ones often aren ' t ) . Now lunch doesn ' t have to begin with the frustration of waiting for an adult to help_out . * The only real question is what to serve . Let ' s start with the issue of creative deception . It ' s really OK to practice a little sleight_of_hand in the interest of nutritional balance . The easiest way is to find things your child likes and then fool_around with them . My daughter developed an early affection for pesto -- matched by a dislike of anything else that was green . How to get those dark veggies into her ? I steamed a zucchini and put it in the food_processor with more traditional pesto ingredients -- and then , just to mask the greenery a bit , smoothed the sauce with nonfat ricotta . I might not serve it to purist friends , but Sarah continues to love it . She even loves it when the dread spinach replaces half the basil . I figure by the time she comprehends real pesto , she ' ll have forgotten the particulars of her kindergarten cuisine . It ' s unlikely that most kids would willingly eat a beet , but when blended with a comfort food like mashed potatoes , it ' s almost irresistible . Citrus restaurant owner Michel Richard makes a delicious potato and beet puree . Sure , it ' s best served the moment you ' re done preparing it . But it ' s also fuchsia . Pink potatoes ! The very notion sent Sarah into peals of laughter , and the novelty distracts her from the fact that she ' s eating it at room_temperature . * Which brings us to the best diversion . Let your children participate in the growing or preparing of a food , and they are likelier to gobble it up at lunch time . The first time I made Richard ' s puree I gave Sarah a hand ricer and she went_to work mashing until , as she put it , &quot; all_the white stuff is gone. &quot; By the time she finished she had a proprietary interest in the outcome . She had to eat it . The best sources of kids ' recipes are Alice Waters ' &quot; Fanny at Chez Panisse &quot; ( HarperCollins : 1992 ) and Mollie Katzen ' s &quot; Pretend Soup &quot; ( Tricycle Press : 1994 ) . Waters ' book was , for a long_time , our daughter ' s favorite bedtime book . It ' s full of short_stories about life at the famous Berkeley restaurant , all_of them accompanied by winsome illustrations , all_of them featuring the indefatigable Fanny , the Eloise of the culinary universe . The recipes are easy to make and fun to eat , and the corn bread -- simple for a child to help measure and mix -- is a perfect lunch-box treat either by itself or sliced horizontally to serve as a unique sandwich bread . Katzen ' s book offers illustrated recipes so that even the pre-reader can work_through a recipe with a little assistance . Looking_at the drawings gives a child a real sense of power -- this is a youngster ' s universe , full of funny names and silly decorations -- but the food is substantial enough to satisfy parents . Katzen ' s bright pink fruit dip may_not be the apotheosis of good eating , with its frozen raspberries and cream_cheese -- but there ' s yogurt in it too , and it ' s less sweetened than the bevy of yogurts aimed at kids . And it ' s a portal to fresh fruit . If you ' ve got a little tub of fruit dip in your lunch box , you need something to dip_into it ; Sarah studied the illustration and insisted on banana slices -- which she usually avoids -- simply because they were in the picture . Setting_up a food as mom and dad ' s favorite , which ( for some kids ) makes_it worthy of attention , requires cooperative parents , but it ' s easier than you think . We eat so_much pasta in our house that Sarah grew_up believing it was the one food real people ate . Since she desperately wanted to be a real person , she ate -- and eats -- almost anything if it ' s part of a noodle sauce . Pastina cooked in chicken_broth ( with the carrots mashed through ) , fusilli with corn , chopped tomatoes and olive_oil , penne with tomato-and-turkey-sausage sauce . On the days when I break_down and make her a tuna sandwich , she acts like I ' m neglecting her . * By now working moms are weeping into their Filofaxes , wondering how they ' ll ever do right by their children , but I speak as an overextended parent myself . It ' s not difficult to offer variety . Make a pound of pasta at night even though your family won ' t finish it , and send the leftovers , sprinkled anew with Parmesan or garnished with cherry_tomatoes , as the next day ' s lunch . Roast a chicken on the weekend and add the leftovers , cubed , to rice with a tablespoon of pesto . If you study the convenience_foods , you see them for what they really are -- diminished versions of real foods ( and only a_few of them ) that you can more healthfully , and cheaply , make yourself . Are you really going_to pay more money for something whose shelf_life is longer than the warranty on your car ? * This smooth sauce , milder than traditional pesto , might make wary kids a bit more willing to eat something green .
