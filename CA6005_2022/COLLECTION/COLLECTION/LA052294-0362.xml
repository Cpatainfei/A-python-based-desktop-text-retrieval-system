   <HEADLINE> WAR AND REMEMBRANCE ; FROM LONDON TO NORMANDY TO BERLIN , A DAUGHTER FOLLOWS HER VETERAN FATHER IN SEARCH OF HIS MEMORIES AND THE SOURCE OF HIS GRAND SILENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> WE HAVE RENTED A RENAULT , MY FATHER , MY MOTHER AND I , AND ARE MAKING haste through rain-washed Norman countryside toward Omaha Beach . My infant daughter sleeps_in a car_seat in the back ; my father , uncharacteristically expansive on this blustery morning , is telling about how Allied reconnaissance flights flew up and down over these verdant coastal farmlands 50 years ago . &quot; They knew every square_inch of these beaches , &quot; he says . &quot; They knew some of them were sand , some of them were shingle and some had cliffs , but what they didn ' t know about , and why not I don ' t know , were the hedgerows. &quot; I try to look_at the terrain without running_off the road . The dread hedgerows of June 6 . Centuries-old walls of root and earth , trees , shrubs and vines sprouting out of the top , they border every cultivated field around here ; anyone could see why they made_for so_much trouble during the invasion we have come_to contemplate . Nine thousand British , American and Canadian casualties by the close of business on that first day of Europe ' s liberation . The rain has stopped when we pull into the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach , but a special-effects wind sweeps fiercely up from the Channel . Under sullen , early spring skies , the grounds are of a heartbreaking sweetness and mesure . Little signs urge &quot; Silence and Respect &quot; in English and &quot; Picnicking Forbidden &quot; in French . The only sound is the wind raking the pines . My mother stays in the car with the sleeping baby . Not far from the graves , my father and I come_to a small , tidy house where records are kept of those buried here . A young Frenchwoman helps my father search for his friends from basic training . He finds Joseph Woodbury , from Michigan , and one Willy Preiss of Georgia , who went airborne when my father didn ' t . &quot; Willy Preiss . . . . We used to talk_about politics. &quot; He recalls that they had read some of the same books and shared progressive views . &quot; Then he joined the 101st Airborne , and I didn ' t see him for about a month , &quot; he says . &quot; I finally ran_into him in London . He was_on furlough , on his way to a movie . He said he liked the Airborne . Glad he signed up. &quot; The Frenchwoman invites my father to sign a log of veteran-visitors , and we step back outside and return to the car . We say nothing . FOR 15 YEARS AS A REPORTER , I HAVE MADE A LIVING BY JUST LISTENING TO people : a Red Army general in Kabul , a Senderista in a Peruvian dungeon , earthquake survivors in a broken , flaming metropolis . . . . I am permitted to ask such people more or less what I want . The arresting thing about this work is not how hard it is to get people to open_up , but what a chore it can be to get them to give it a rest . And yet for all_the notebooks filled with anecdotes and confessions , there is one &quot; subject &quot; I haven ' t listened to , haven ' t penciled in_for an hour of Q &amp; A , haven ' t wanted to confront at all . That is my father . He is an intensely quiet man , a journalist ' s nightmare , really , someone who answers questions with a straight-up yes or no and then shuffles off into the substantial acreage of his private preserve of thought . He was an insurance-claims examiner whose dislike of the work he did for 40 years would be hard to overstate ; a dour , card-carrying Grant Wood Calvinist , an elder of the Presbyterian_Church , no less , and one who really means it , to judge from his tithing ; and a tree-farmer who has all his life been most content alone , in an unheated shack in the piney realm of northern Wisconsin , feeding_on sardines , Wonder Bread and a cup of Swiss Miss brought_to a boil on a Coleman stove . My husband likes to say Thomas Edward Williams is wired to an invisible Walkman : &quot; If taciturnity were an Olympic event , your father ' d make_it to the medal round , no question. &quot; &quot; Surely the Serbs will come_around after a whiff of the grape ! &quot; &quot; Could be. &quot; &quot; I bet the Blue_Jays take it in six ! &quot; &quot; we ' ll see. &quot; For years , I have accepted my father ' s grand apartness as just the way things are with him . I never cared -- or is it dared ? -- to look beneath the smoother surfaces . But when he turned 72 recently , the silence began to grow unsettling . I was seized by a sense of something left undone . There are no gut-spillers in my family , but I began to think it far better to address certain yearnings now than pack around regrets later . And I knew that there was only one solvent for any decent conversation with him -- the Second_World_War . On this topic , my father is not just willing to talk , he can turn positively garrulous , even with perfect strangers . I once stood_by in astonishment as he buttonholed a man with an English accent in a Hong Kong bus queue . He was Of a Certain Age , and my father decided to see whether the fellow felt_like discussing what his war had been like . My father is anything but a war-lover , but in the years since his return in 1945 from occupied Germany to Wisconsin , his beloved trees , his desk job and my mother , he has made himself an accomplished amateur scholar of this war , his war . How many other little_girls would bike home from their flute lessons and find their father curled_up with Marshall Zhukov ' s memoirs ? &quot; What did you do_in the war , Daddy ? &quot; I had never bothered to ask . Neither had my brother , or either of my sisters . All of us had other demands on our attention , I suppose -- like &quot; Gilligan ' s Island &quot; -- and enough teen-age foolishness to keep us from wondering what the last generation had seen , and whether it might not hold something for us . In any case , I had only the most notional sense of what my father ' s GI life had been all about -- he had not seen any action , he was a clerk , something to do with Operation Overlord , the planning for D-Day . Now I wanted to know just what it was , and why those times seem to mean so desperately much to him , even five decades later . Could his great , mysterious silence be traced to the war , to some transformative moment of awfulness as he soldiered in 1944 and 1945 from southern England to Normandy , and finally to Berlin ? Suddenly , things seemed to come_together to provide a father and daughter convergence -- half-century observances were pouring_down on the consciousness of all but Europe ' s dead and addlebrained -- and I was moving to Berlin . It was probably impudent to ask the Second_World_War to serve as the backdrop for a big-time , last-chance exchange with my father , but that is what I decided to do . We would retrace his wartime route , and at some point he would begin speaking and I would finally know my father . I gathered my courage and phoned Wisconsin : Could we meet for tea at the Connaught in London and take it from there ? I knew he ' d say yes . And not much more . IT IS RAINING IN LONDON , A GENTLE SPRING SHOWER THAT KNOCKS THE apple blossoms off dripping black boughs . We have loaded the baby stroller into the back of a boxy taxi and are rolling through the streets of Belgravia to a place called Norfolk House . I had not yet found a good baby-sitter in Berlin , so I brought my 10-month-old daughter along . My 2-year-old son stayed behind with his dad . My father is indeed happy to have an excuse to return to Europe . And he has come for our recherche equipped with two copies of an essay on his wartime-London experience , something he ' d written in response to an American historian ' s call_for reminiscences . I had known_nothing about this exercise . From the manuscript I learn much about my father . By the time he was a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin , the Nazi writ extended in Europe from Norway to Crete , from the outskirts of Leningrad to the boot of Italy . He was ready to enlist in the army air corps , until he learned he was colorblind . He tried the Marines but was sent_away as underweight . So he joined the Army , figuring he would be commissioned . The Army had other ideas . It made my father a rifleman and after much to-ing and fro-ing on trains and trucks , he found himself in Halifax ' s harbor aboard the Mauritania , a British Merchant_Marine vessel , which duly weighed_anchor for England . In Liverpool , he learned that he was being sent to London to work for something called COSSAC . More trucks , more trains and , finally , there is my father , all_of 21 , in an office just off Piccadilly Circus , now the keeper of the keys to a filing_cabinet that , he is told , houses the master_plans for the invasion of France . Out of nowhere , certainly without having asked_for_it , he has a secret clearance . It will be his job to copy the Normandy plans as needed and to sleep on a cot next to the files , a carbine beside him , ready to defend the contents against any intruder . The code-name COSSAC would soon change to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force . SHAEF was doing business , for the time being , out of Norfolk House . Very big-deal stuff for a Wisconsin game_warden ' s son who ' d seen little of the world . And what ' s this about the Marines ? I came_of_age at a time when the blood-and-guts Marines were having a nasty go of it in Vietnam , and the news of my father ' s attempt to go the &quot; Full Metal Jacket &quot; route makes no sense , given his demeanor . &quot; Well , the Marines had the reputation of an elite fighting group , &quot; he says . &quot; I thought if I was going_to be a fighting man , I might as well live_up_to my potential. &quot; A fighting man , my quiet father . Wasn ' t he racked with fear and , um , loathing as he boarded the Mauritania ? Again , Vietnam drove my thinking ; I cannot redo his climb_up the gangplank without great shuddering . &quot; No , no . I was glad I was healthy and able to do something . I don ' t think anybody had any idea of what combat was really going_to be like. &quot; &quot; Well , they never do ! &quot; offers my mother . &quot; I think that ' s why we keep having so many wars . One generation can ' t pass its experience with war on to the next. &quot; Indeed . As we roll through the streets of Belgravia , my father calls_out the names of churches , art_galleries and office_blocks , telling which ones had been hit by the Germans , finding the place where he had picked_up the bomb fin he ' d later bring_home for a souvenir . He remembers that the Tube stations would fill_up at night with Londoners too frightened of the Luftwaffe to sleep_in their own beds . And that homeowners spaded up their front_yards and planted wall-to-wall Brussels_sprouts . I crane this way and that , trying to take_hold_of what he must have felt as a youngster . But to me , Belgravia is little more_than a tony district in post-Thatcher London . No craters , no scorched facades , no Brussels_sprouts . But then , maybe my mother has it right : One generation can ' t pass_on its experiences to the next , at least not in a simple morning ' s cab ride through the rain . I think_of my husband , a former Marine turned cameraman in Vietnam . During the 1980s , he taught at Duke University and found that none of his smart , young-and-happening students had ever heard of the Tet Offensive , much less Khe Sanh , Ia Drang Valley , Hill 943 . This was a glum business for him , and now I wonder if my father feels the same way , having flown through seven time_zones at my urging , to tell me how life went_with him long ago , and probably suspecting that I couldn ' t wrap my brains around much of it . His children came_of_age in a time of popular skepticism -- what could they understand of a man for whom the war years were the richest of his life ? Perhaps my father had remained silent out of self-imposed courtesy ; no one seemed interested anyway . We climb out of our taxi at St . James Square , across from a building enveloped in scaffolding . Sing to me , oh Norfolk House , oh SHAEF , oh Ike , oh Dad . We pass under the scaffolding and walk through the doors to encounter an imposing security station in the lobby . My father flashes an ID card from 1944 and says his office used to be_on the third floor , but the otherwise friendly guard is unimpressed . The building was remodeled at the beginning of the 1980s , he says . The owners offered the original fittings -- desks , chairs , sconces -- to the American Embassy , but there were no takers . Now the London branch of AT &amp; T is precisely where PFC Williams cranked_out copies of the Normandy invasion plan . &quot; People don ' t know what an important place this was , &quot; the guard concedes . &quot; They think it ( D-Day ) was all planned in pubs and clubs and places like that. &quot; We are free to go_up for a peek , he says , but my father sees no point . &quot; WHAT WAS BUSHEY PARK ? &quot; MY MOTHER ASKS . &quot; IS IT A VILLAGE ? &quot; We are sitting motionless on an elevated stretch of the Tube line that goes_to the suburb of Richmond , becalmed by a massive power_failure . We are trying to get_to a onetime encampment outside London , a place with a Beatrix Potterish name , where my father was stationed just before D-Day . SHAEF moved there as the bombing of central London intensified . In his essay , my father reports that SHAEF had gotten a captured German map , with a menacing X over Norfolk House . &quot; No , &quot; says my father . &quot; It ' s just a big park . You ' ll see. &quot; &quot; Did you live_in tents ? &quot; my mother asks . &quot; No , wooden huts. &quot; End of conversation . I am impatient with the delay and with my situation : My aging parents have schlepped their suitcases in and out of taxis and across terminals , and here we are in London , with the same old &quot; Could be &quot; and &quot; we ' ll see. &quot; Must life with my father always be a game of 20 Questions ? If it ' s this much work to find_out that he lived_in wooden huts , how will we ever be able to talk_about the personal , about feelings ? But of course I don ' t say this . Instead I ask about buzz-bombs , which I had heard my father mention . Here is what I learn : They were something the Germans dreamed_up in 1943 . Crude precursors of the cruise missile , they were powered by gas motors . The motors were supposed to cut_out over London and the bombs would dive . But , my father says , they sometimes didn ' t dive -- they kept gliding along to come_down somewhere else . &quot; Once I heard one cut_out overhead while I was standing about as far away from a shelter as that roof over there , &quot; he says , pointing at a garden shed . &quot; I dove into the shelter just when it exploded . It made an impressive bang. &quot; All right ! Now we ' re clicking . I fix on the shed . It looks unnervingly far off , even for a 21-year-old who ran the half-mile in high_school . And as I stare at it , I remember an afternoon of my own five years back , when I traveled closer than sound_judgment really dictated to Jalalabad , a besieged provincial_capital in Afghanistan . I heard a MiG coming_in_for a run and dove for a ditch . My escort estimated that the bomb hit 150 yards away . It made an impressive bang . Yes , yes . The Underground jerks to life . Our plan is to meet an old friend of my father , Susan Hibbard , at the Richmond Tube station and continue by car to Bushey Park . She was the secretary to the_British head of planning and operations for SHAEF , and her job was to type the plans for the invasion that my father then duplicated , filed and guarded with the carbine . On the last_day of the war in Europe , she typed the Allied-drafted instrument of surrender , signed at Rheims . Mrs . Hibbard is a charmingly turned_out woman with high English coloring and a rise of white hair , who apologizes that she has been stuck_in traffic . Bushey Park turns_out to be an endless expanse of grass planted with rows of trees -- horse_chestnuts , my father notes -- and a pond with a statue in the middle and a herd of tamed deer . My father leads us over to where he thinks the enlisted huts once stood . We find a small monument , but the inscription commemorates the army air corps , not SHAEF . But Mrs . Hibbard has brought an envelope stuffed with the past , hang the monument makers -- a SHAEF insignia from her uniform , newspaper_clippings , pictures of my father in uniform . I stare at the pictures while they laugh about the good gone days . Mrs . Hibbard mentions that one evening , a_few days into the Normandy campaign , her boss announced that the evening ' s dictation would be of plans for a British retreat . She must have looked horrified , she says , because he told her , &quot; Don ' t worry , we have to have a plan for everything. &quot; &quot; I was 17 years old and I was in the middle of everything , &quot; she laughs . I try to remember what I was doing at that age , but immediately think better of it . ABOARD THE P &amp; O FERRY , plying the Channel to Le Havre on our way to Normandy , we encounter head-winds and rough seas ; the trip takes 7 1 / 2 hours . At least the weather gives us a feeling for the misery of the invaders , making their way across on the hellish evening of June 5 . The ferry ' s evocative pitching makes my father talk_about the hallowed beaches . Many of the Allied soldiers who spent the night crossing the Channel were wrung_out by the time they made their horrific wadings onto shore . &quot; I ' m glad we don ' t have to rappel up a cliff under machine-gun fire at the end of this trip , &quot; he offers . I smooth my daughter ' s hair and try to picture my father making the famous assault at Pointe du Hoc -- a 100-foot cliff , three companies from the 2nd Ranger Battalion scaling a sheer wall of rock to an incantation of German bullets -- but find this difficult to do , since if he had , I probably would n ' t be here . There were 225 Americans at Pointe du Hoc that morning ; only 90 were alive at day ' s end . My mother does her needlepoint and dozes , the baby wants to crawl and doesn ' t understand why she isn ' t permitted to . My father continues to talk quietly . He doesn ' t know , he says , why he was plucked out of the infantry and assigned to the safety of a copying machine . He does know , however , why he didn ' t reach Normandy by parachute . When he first arrived in England , recruiters from the 101st Airborne came and made a pitch . My father was tempted , but something stopped him , something his own father had passed along to his only son . A Wisconsin doughboy , my grandfather saw his share of trench life in France 25 years before . Some of his friends volunteered for a tank unit . Tanks were new on the armaments scene and wretchedly designed for human cargo . Most of my grandfather ' s more adventurous friends were either killed or maimed . My grandfather advised his son to stay clear of the razzmatazz units until all_the bugs had been worked_out . I think_about how my grandfather ' s war stories literally saved my father ' s life . I have no warrant at all to think that my little son , now all flaxen hair and cornflower eyes , will never be hustled aboard a Mauritania of_his_own . And I have no reason to think he ' ll luck_out like my father , and get tagged for a job in which you come_in_for a bit of low cost glory and have an almost-splendid time of it . Perhaps somewhere in the flat delivery that is my father ' s storytelling style , there is a fateful phrase or sentence that will protect my son . I try to listen more closely . THE PROPRIETRESS IN A SMALL restaurant in Paris , on the Boulevard Montparnasse , is so eager for warm , paying bodies that she opens early at the sight of us . My father , who doesn ' t speak French , is eager for me to tell her that he made_it to Paris during the war . This has happened time after time over the course of our travels . My father spots someone who looks as if he or she might be old enough to remember -- or even some who don ' t -- and makes me tell them who he is and that he was there in liberated Paris . Sometimes he pulls from his wallet a 50-year-old two-franc note -- &quot; occupation money , &quot; he calls it -- and shows it off . &quot; Soldat ! &quot; exclaims the owner after suffering through my recitation in cast-iron French . She holds_up her arms as if gripping an assault_rifle and sprays the room with imaginary bullets . Then she asks to hold the baby . In stores , on the street , on the train to Versailles , I see him reaching for his wallet with that worn two-franc note . And usually there is a disappointing , blank-faced reaction . I feel badly for him each time and wish I could understand why he keeps wanting to try . But one day , success ! We stop at a Paris grocery_store for fruit . My father and I go_into our usual routine with the elderly cashier and the bored , teen-age help . My father produces the occupation money . There is moment of incomprehension , and then the woman breaks_into a smile . &quot; Il etait un des anciens soldats , &quot; she tells the kid , &quot; He ' s one of the former soldiers. &quot; My mother whoops , thinking the woman has called my father an &quot; ancient soldier. &quot; But the teen-ager understands and actually seems impressed , interested in studying the worn bill . &quot; Good job ! &quot; says the old_woman , and the teen-ager gives a thumbs-up . I AM NOT THE ONLY DAUGHTER trying to find my father in the commemoration of a war . A new German friend , an East Berliner , is the daughter of a Luftwaffe veteran who flew bombing missions over London when my father was_on the ground with his file_cabinets . After the war , Petra says , her father was so sickened with everything having to do with the Third_Reich that he joined the Communist_Party and became a minor functionary of the German Democratic Republic . When the East_German regime collapsed , Herr Falkenberg slipped into a severe depression . Petra hoped to bring her father around by taking him and her mother on a trip to London . She picked London without thinking_of his Luftwaffe service , and was alarmed to see him spend an afternoon staring at the Thames from Westminster Bridge , brooding . Herr Falkenberg , like my father , is 72 years old . Like my father , he has lived a life of quiet office work since the war , pushing paper for Karl Marx instead of Adam Smith . Like my father , he has delegated most family matters_to a bustling , sturdy wife . Like my father , he has never met a combatant from the other side . Petra and I arrange a lunch in Potsdam . I don ' t know what to expect . But it couldn ' t be easier , it seems , for these two to be chummy across a restaurant table . Herr Falkenberg instantly recognizes my father ' s two-franc note . &quot; Occupation money ! &quot; His eyes are_on the sad side , and yet he laughs , delightedly , at my father ' s accounts of Army screw-ups . After all these years , my father gets the chance to ask a German about that map of London with the big unfriendly X . Did the Luftwaffe know where Eisenhower ' s office was ? There was no particular strategic plan , says Herr Falkenberg , sad again . He and his crew just flew up the Thames estuary and launched the rockets whenever they could and got_out as expeditiously as possible . &quot; When we started_out , there were 15 crews , &quot; he says . &quot; At the end , only two had survived. &quot; A bit of fellow_feeling for the men who bombed London ? How very odd . Yet here in this attractive Potsdam restaurant , a little beer , wine and much translated goodwill carry the day . My father becomes expansive -- more so with this former enemy then he has been with me , but what the hell . The baby is passed from lap to lap . Photographs are exchanged . Herr Falkenberg has brought along a tattered we-regret-to-inform-you letter sent_in error to his parents . &quot; A lot of us are very lucky to have survived , &quot; he says . The old gents make affecting toasts . The daughters trade winks . Children of loving but remote fathers , each has sought some sort of -- well , what ? Let ' s say it ' s a smoothing out of certain family things . In bringing_off this handsome little scene , each of us hopes to take_home something for ourselves about our fathers , about life . And what do we have ? At least a mild sense of completion for me . There has been a seemliness to this meeting , this breaking of bread with a former enemy . Something has fallen_into_place . But damn it all , there ' s some secret handshaking going_on between these lodge brothers of history , a code Petra and I can ' t crack . The daughters are outflanked . IT IS LATE AFTERNOON AND my father , my husband , my son and I are climbing the &quot; hill &quot; behind the Charlottenburg flat we have sublet . It is a strange hill , this one , rising abruptly out of the east_German plain . It is in fact a Trummerberg , a &quot; rubble mountain. &quot; After the war , where to put all_the bomb-blasted bits of urban Germany ? Most large cities targeted by the Allied air command have been left with these burial_mounds . Birch groves cover the slopes of this one ; hobbyists fly stunt kites on the top and there ' s a ski_run down the western side . My son chirps and runs_on ahead . He wants to climb the steepest parts , and he wants grandpa to come_with him . This talkative little boy has attached himself to his quiet grandfather . He isn ' t put_off by four-word answers to questions of exceptional scope and cunning . He is excited to think that grandpa was in the war -- whatever it is a 2-year-old conceives war to be -- and runs_on with toddler-chat . Airplanes ! Helmets ! Guns ! &quot; Yes , grandpa was a soldier , &quot; I tell him . &quot; But grandpa was a lucky soldier . He didn ' t have to fire his gun. &quot; And how lucky , indeed , my father was . He has been allowed the happy satisfaction that , in his own small way , he helped rid Europe of German fascism . Maybe things took_on a dull cast after the return to Wisconsin -- the teeth-gritting work_at the insurance_company , the small-town upbringing of four children . But that was all_right . He ' s had a good time of it , he says , planted 80 # 000 trees by hand -- each of his grandchildren has been treated to a grove . Yes , a good time of it -- that ' s the plain English of my father ' s story , and it is left to me to say so . For his part , I think , he has always understood that to run_on about such good_luck was sort of rude , like eating peas off a knife . So : I &quot; talked &quot; to my father . What have I learned ? Something I should have known all along : Life doesn ' t work_out like Italian opera . No outpourings , no neat conjunctions in the final act . Still , my father ' s glad he made the trip . He says they ' ll be back in the fall , when it ' s too cold in Wisconsin to do much with the trees . Next time , he asks , how about dinner with that nice Luftwaffe fellow ?</TEXT>
