   <HEADLINE> COLOSIO GUARD CHARGED AS ' CO-PARTICIPANT ' ; INQUIRY : SPECIAL PROSECUTOR HEADS FOR TIJUANA AS AUTHORITIES TRY TO QUELL RUMORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a special prosecutor was about to begin trying to unravel the increasingly mysterious case surrounding the assassination of Mexico ' s ruling party presidential candidate , a security_guard was formally charged Tuesday in the capital with being a &quot; co-participant &quot; in the killing . Authorities also seemed to spend much time seeking to dispel the myriad rumors sweeping the nation about the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , the candidate who was gunned_down here a week ago today but had been widely expected to be Mexico ' s next president . Among the developments : * U.S. officials downplayed allegations by Mexican investigators that the chief suspect in the case , Mario Aburto Martinez , had links with gangs or other unspecified groups in Los Angeles . * Mexican authorities insisted that they will run a meticulous , impartial investigation . They sought to refute the widespread suggestion of a conspiracy involving Mexican officials in Colosio ' s killing , which would taint the ability of government investigators to fairly probe the case . * Mexican officials also have insisted that Colosio was slain by two shots -- not three , as some reports suggested -- and that the gun they have in_evidence is , indeed , the weapon used in the assassination . New questions have arisen about the weapon because of its appearance in a widely broadcast , brutal videotape of Colosio ' s wounding at point-blank range . Investigators Tuesday intensified their focus_on the security team assembled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , for Colosio ' s fatal campaign stop here . At least two security_guards in the PRI-arranged force , both former policemen , may have had previous contacts with the accused assassin ; both former officers were at the assassination site in a poor Tijuana barrio , with one reportedly arriving in the neighborhood with Aburto on the day of the killing . Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas -- a guard who authorities say was seen with Aburto in a Tijuana park a week before the killing -- was flown to a high-security prison near Mexico_City and charged as a &quot; co-participant. &quot; Authorities said he may have cleared the crowd to let Aburto near Colosio . Relatives of Sanchez said Tuesday that the former policeman is innocent and never knew Aburto , the accused assassin . &quot; He ' s incapable of doing this , &quot; Maria Ramirez Sanchez said of her husband . The other guard , Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela , was initially arrested in the melee following the shooting but later released . Meanwhile , U.S. officials downplayed a suggestion by the Mexican attorney_general ' s office that Aburto had links with unspecified &quot; groups &quot; and &quot; gangs &quot; in the Los Angeles area , where the suspect had lived_in recent years . &quot; that ' s purely speculation at this time , &quot; said John Hoos , the FBI spokesman in Los Angeles . Mexican officials provided little substantiation for their claim of Aburto ' s Los Angeles links other_than noting that he had a nickname , &quot; Eagle Knight , &quot; after an Aztec warrior symbol , which is a popular emblem of Mexican nationalism . A police gang expert told The Times the symbol has no special significance for Los Angeles gangs . Miguel Montes Garcia , a former Supreme Court justice named as special prosecutor in the case , was scheduled to arrive in Tijuana late Tuesday to oversee the high-profile inquiry . Rotella reported from Tijuana and McDonnell from Los Angeles .</TEXT>
