   <HEADLINE> THE TAIWAN CONNECTION ; A NETWORK SOME AUTHORITIES CALL THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT CRIMINAL THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES SMUGGLES 100 # 000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM CHINA EACH YEAR , COLLECTING BILLIONS TO BANKROLL A DIVERSE CRIMINAL EMPIRE . AS FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS STRUGGLE TO FIGHT IT , ALL ROADS LEAD TO TAIWAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jorge Guzman , a special_agent for the Immigration and Naturalization Service , has a price on his head . It is his reward for snapping_at the heels of one of the biggest , and most profitable , human smuggling operations in the world , a network that in turn fuels criminal enterprises from drug trafficking to credit_card fraud , from prostitution to extortion . A broad man with a broad grin , Guzman wears his moods on his sleeve . Shielding himself behind the mask and monotone so typical of his law- enforcement colleagues is clearly an unnatural act . Nor does he suffer fools easily , on either side of the law -- the grin can disappear in a flash . But Guzman would hardly rate an assassin ' s contract if he didn ' t have an effective sting . As the L.A.-based coordinator of investigations into Asian organized crime , he engineered the only successful undercover operation to date against Chinese migrant smugglers . Operation Dry_Dock arrested 132 illegal Chinese immigrants and yielded a wealth of information on the smuggling masterminds . The man suspected of ordering the hit on Guzman is Taiwanese . Based in Guatemala , his criminal shadow looms largest over Southern California . Federal_officials have asked that I not reveal his name , so let ' s call him Mr. Li . Poker-faced and a bit jowly from too_much banqueting , Li looks_like what he is , a successful Chinese businessman in middle_age . But rather than athletic shoes or dried mushrooms , multiple sources say , Li imports China White , an exceptionally pure form of heroin . Rather than the Rotary or Kiwanis Club , they say , he is affiliated with triads in Asia and street gangs in Los Angeles . And rather than mini-malls , he invests in L.A.-area nightclubs staffed by prostitutes from Shanghai and Fuzhou . But these interests are all peripheral to his main , multimillion-dollar line_of_business : smuggling economic migrants from China into the United States , some by sea and even more by air . Li has had a stake in nearly half of the 20-odd human-cargo boats apprehended in the Pacific since August , 1991 , according to a confidential State_Department memo outlining his career . And those are just the ships of which law_enforcement is aware . &quot; Li doesn ' t have any real competitors on the West Coast , &quot; says a senior INS official . As big as he is , however , Li is only one link in a transnational chain of ethnic Chinese enterprises that are flooding the United States with illegal immigrants and high-potency heroin . They generate tens of billions of dollars each year , much of it used to bribe officials around the world , and have become , in the words of the Washington official , &quot; the single most important criminal threat to the United States. &quot; One cannot but marvel at a network that was able to sneak 100 # 000 people a year through dozens of countries around the globe with hardly anyone paying_attention -- until a migrant-laden tramp_steamer , the Golden Venture , ran_aground near New York City in June , 1993 . Since then , the smuggling of Chinese immigrants has fallen_out of the headlines , but it continues unabated , not only in the United States but all_over the world . The story of Li ' s empire , and the larger empire of which it is a part , gives a glimpse of the reaches of this network , which Guzman and other front-line agents , outmanned and out-financed , are fighting in their two-front battle against Asian organized crime . On one front are Li and his far-flung , highly mobile army , connected in myriad ways to criminal -- and possibly official -- organizations in Taiwan . On the other is a government that has been slow to recognize the scope and reach of highly diversified Chinese criminal groups and whose unfocused policies have made_it frustratingly hard for investigators like Guzman to penetrate the human smuggling rings that turbocharge these groups with cash and manpower . * Li ' s business empire began to burgeon in the 1980s , when Deng Xiaoping opened China to trade . In the boom that followed , Taiwanese were among the first and most aggressive investors , despite the political tension between Beijing and Taipei . They naturally gravitated to their ancestral province of Fujian -- virtually a stone ' s throw from Taiwan -- where they speak the same dialects and often have relatives . There , criminal entrepreneurs found what would become a gold mine . Farmers in Fujian , on the southeastern coast of China , were being squeezed off their land . The country ' s breakneck transition to industry was replacing farms with factories , displacing millions of agricultural workers . The farm jobs that did remain were being filled by desperately poor peasants from China ' s interior , willing to work for next to nothing . The pressure of unemployment and personal debt , combined with abuse from venal officials , made daily life increasingly difficult for growing numbers of Fujianese . From afar , the United States shimmered with wealth and opportunity . And in Fujian , which has a long history of rebellion , secret_societies and sea-based smuggling , a tradition of emigration began to reassert itself . Conflicts arising from the emergence of the Ching dynasty in the 17th Century had led to a massive migration , mainly to Taiwan , Southeast_Asia and later to Latin_America . Now , with help from enterprising investors like Li , another massive exodus would begin . Li and his main competitor , another Taiwanese man now based in Brazil , are the biggest of the many entrepreneurs in the smuggling business . Both men quickly transformed their mom- and-pop smuggling ventures into full-service , global operations . Fleeing a murder rap in Brazil in the mid-1980s , Li moved to El_Salvador and then Guatemala , where he worked his way through the ranks of his new trade . He didn ' t come alone . &quot; Smuggling ( had been ) controlled by a base of Cantonese families , &quot; notes the State_Department memo . But then the &quot; Taiwanese moved_in and established a base of about 150 families. &quot; By 1991 , they had taken_over , and Li was the new boss . In the meantime , by no coincidence , the clientele had changed too , both in number and kind . More_than 90 % of the estimated half-million migrants who have been smuggled from mainland_China into the United States since 1984 are from Fuzhou -- the capital of Fujian province -- and three adjacent counties , an area not much bigger than greater Los Angeles . Seldom has so large a migration been so geographically concentrated at the source , and never has one been so overwhelmingly illegal . The United States is not the only promised land . A Taiwanese man in_league with Fuzhou &quot; snakeheads &quot; -- booking_agents for migrant smugglers -- was recently convicted of alien smuggling in Japan , where Chinese crime syndicates have forged ties with their Japanese counterparts , the Yakuza . More_than 20 ships unload their cargo there annually , according to an INS agent based in Asia . Australian authorities have apprehended four ships in the past eight months . Last fall , the interior minister of Austria announced that police had &quot; uncovered a Europe-wide network of Mafia-like ( Chinese ) organized crime &quot; responsible_for smuggling thousands of migrants into Vienna . Similar reports have come_out of Italy , Germany and the Czech Republic . And these are only the target countries . China ' s Public_Security Bureau estimates that there are half-a-million Chinese nationals in smuggling way-stations around the world -- 50 # 000 in Moscow , 15 # 000 in Ho Chi Minh City , 25 # 000 in Bangkok , 25 # 000 in Africa , 10 # 000 in Brazil , 5 # 000 in other countries including the Dominican_Republic , Mexico , Romania and Bulgaria -- waiting to complete their journeys . Until the ' 80s , says Jim Hayes , Guzman ' s boss and head of anti- smuggling operations for the INS in Los Angeles , &quot; alien smuggling had always been a localized , small-scale affair -- people would find their own way to the other side of the Mexican border and hire a smuggler from there . But as demand increased , organizations began to spring_up around the world . Today it has gotten_to the point where a smuggler can accommodate someone who walks in off the street in Fuzhou or Kiev or Karachi. &quot; * The engine of the people-smuggling network , the heart that makes the blood flow , is Taiwan . The 40 ships identified by U.S. authorities that have tried -- successfully , in most cases -- to deposit their cargo in the United States since 1991 are &quot; overwhelmingly connected in some form or fashion to the island of Taiwan , &quot; notes Assistant U.S. Atty . James Walsh , who heads the Organized Crime Strike Force for Los Angeles . Most are owned , and many were captained and crewed , by Taiwan nationals . The few vessels that were not Taiwan registered disguised their origins with flags of convenience from Belize , Panama or Honduras . But the Taiwan connection goes much deeper than that . &quot; The boats are set_up there , the money is laundered there , &quot; says a senior INS official in Washington who requested anonymity . &quot; The behind-the-scenes people who control some of the gangs that pick_up at airports , control safe houses and collect money are also Taiwanese &quot; -- people like Li and his rival in Sao Paulo . And people are apparently not the only commodity moving through the network . Walsh , who says that Asian crime is by far the &quot; premier consumer &quot; of the strike force ' s resources in Southern California , has also identified &quot; several Asian heroin smuggling and distribution organizations active in the L.A. area &quot; that may be connected to larger smuggling networks . Here , too , links to Taiwan are emerging . Mainland Chinese police have arrested several dozen Taiwanese over the last couple of years for manufacturing , processing and trafficking both heroin and crystal methamphetamine , called ice . &quot; Both Taiwan and China play a major role in drug trafficking to the U.S. , &quot; says a senior Drug Enforcement Administration official in Washington . &quot; Taiwan is a major transit area -- there is no doubt . It has replaced Hong Kong. &quot; The changeover has been startlingly rapid . Throughout the late 1980s , Taiwan police seized about three kilos of heroin a year . Then the numbers began to explode , from 98 kilos in 1991 to 1 # 100 in 1993 . By the end of June this year , seizures totaled 1 # 000 kilos , the most of any country in Asia except China and Thailand . Taiwan denies that it has become the preferred stepping-off point from mainland Asia for heroin and ice smugglers . &quot; Taiwan is not a major transshipment point , &quot; says the country ' s minister of justice , Ying-jeou Ma . &quot; We have our own drug problem. &quot; No doubt true , but U.S. experts still see a discrepancy . &quot; The massive amounts of heroin seized is far in excess of the amount needed to supply the Republic_of_China ' s domestic needs , &quot; noted a 1993 FBI report on the United Bamboo Gang , a huge Taiwan-based criminal organization with a major presence in the United States , especially Southern California . So far there is no smoking gun linking the operations that traffic in drugs and people . Smugglers are too smart to move contraband carrying vastly different penalties -- a_couple_of years for migrants , up_to life in prison for drugs -- in the same shipments . Yet the suspicions remain . &quot; There is evidence , &quot; says San Francisco-based U.S. Atty . Michael Yamaguchi , who helped set_up an Asian organized crime strike force for the West Coast and Hawaii last year , &quot; that heroin and aliens are being smuggled by the same people. &quot; The Taiwan connection to smuggling is so consistent as_to raise troubling questions about official corruption . A 150-foot fishing vessel , the San Tai No . 1 , for example , was purchased in 1991 by the Taiwan government as scrap metal only to turn_up a year later off the coast of California with a boatload of migrants . Of the more_than 10 # 000 Taiwanese passports -- used to smuggle migrants via commercial air carriers -- that find their way into smugglers ' hands every year , hundreds , and perhaps more , are issued by Taiwan consulates around the world , especially in Latin_America . Walsh , who has worked_on several Taiwan-related cases , sees &quot; no reason to believe alien smuggling is connected to the government. &quot; To be sure , Taiwan has given the United States permission to board Taiwan-registered smuggling ships , provides information on Taiwan nationals apprehended on board and usually pays to repatriate mainland Chinese migrants . Once , on request , it even ordered every Taiwan flagship on the high_seas to radio in their positions . But other officials have doubts about Taiwan . &quot; I ' m not sure the government has as much control as it thinks it does , &quot; says Timothy Wirth , Clinton ' s undersecretary of state for global affairs . And John F . Shaw , INS assistant commissioner for investigations , questions Taiwan ' s &quot; will to cooperate &quot; on this issue . Another frustrated federal investigator says that while Taiwan police do forward information about some suspects , they somehow never acknowledge queries about others . &quot; We ' ve requested arrests records for Li and his top people many times , &quot; said one frustrated federal investigator , &quot; and we always draw a blank. &quot; The historical ties between the ruling Kuomintang party and organized crime are a matter of record . From Shanghai ' s Green Gang in the 1940s to the still-thriving United Bamboo Gang , party leaders have frequently used powerful crime syndicates to do their dirty work , even political assassination on U.S. soil . When Henry Liu , a naturalized U.S. citizen from Taiwan , published an unflattering biography of Taiwan ' s then-President Chiang Ching-kuo , Taiwanese intelligence_officers recruited and trained United Bamboo Gang leaders to murder him at his home_in Daly City in 1984 . Only enormous international pressure brought the culprits in Taiwan to justice , and even then they were paroled after a_few years in jail . Well before that , in 1977 , Taiwan had already earned a place on the State_Department ' s &quot; criteria list , &quot; a select category reserved for &quot; foreign governments whose intelligence_activities are hostile to , or of particular concern to , the national security of the United States so that counterintelligence activity is required. &quot; The FBI , which set_up a special Taiwan Counter-Intelligence Unit known as Squad 13 , is equally wary . &quot; Since the government ( on Taiwan ) has lost diplomatic status , &quot; concludes a December , 1993 , FBI report , &quot; it may depend_on the United Bamboo Gang to carry_out assignments that normally would be assigned to its intelligence agencies. &quot; Ma ' s terse response when I asked whether any linkages remained between the government and organized crime : &quot; That was a long_time ago. &quot; * Willard H . Myers III is a bona_fide maverick . As a radical trial_attorney in the early 1970s , he defended domestic terrorists pro bono ; today , the 51-year-old immigration lawyer from Philadelphia is one of law_enforcement ' s best_friends . Working with shards of data gleaned over the course of a decade from his clients -- thousands of illegal immigrants from the Fuzhou region of southern China -- this methodical , soft-spoken ex-professor pieced together a detailed map of smuggling routes and the organizations that maintain them . He identified key players , including Li , and was so alarmed by the scope of criminality he uncovered that he wrote_up his findings in 1991 and sent them to top INS officials in Washington . &quot; My own practice notwithstanding , when I realized the extent to which international organized crime was involved , I felt compelled to act , &quot; says Myers , whose wild gray hair and beard seem at_odds with his button-down lawyer ' s garb . &quot; I was amazed . From entirely different sources we were coming_up with the same names and the same connections. &quot; Hayes , Guzman and INS investigators in other cities were amazed , too . Here was an attorney in private practice who , on_his_own , had penetrated not one , but two highly elaborate smuggling rings . &quot; It was obvious , &quot; concedes one agent , &quot; that he knew more about this stuff to begin with than we did. &quot; Myers is today widely recognized as the leading authority on Chinese alien smuggling , perhaps on Chinese organized crime in_general . Besides having been called to give testimony before the House and Senate , he is regularly consulted by three federal agencies and as_many foreign governments . His annually updated report -- last year ' s edition weighed in at 500 pages -- was the cornerstone of a recent headline-grabbing CIA study about immigrant smuggling . Comments he made during interviews on CNN led to the indictment and dismissal of Said Mouse , minister of immigration in Belize . Myers , who runs a single-engine think_tank called the Center for the Study of Asian Organized Crime , in other words , has done more to sound the alarm about the growing power and influence of Asian organized crime than anyone in the country . &quot; Without doubt , nationals of Taiwan represent the most powerful group in transnational ethnic Chinese organized crime , &quot; Myers told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in April . A few month earlier , he told a House committee much the same , pointing an accusatory finger at unnamed &quot; high-ranking members of ( Taiwan ' s ) National Police Agency. &quot; Myers suspects that rogue members of Taiwan ' s military or intelligence community beyond the reach of civilian law_enforcement are profiting directly from the trade_in human cargo from Fujian . ( Justice Minister Ma , for his part , bristles_at the suggestion of high-level corruption and points to the lack of hard evidence . &quot; We would be happy to have such information , &quot; he adds , &quot; because we are in the process of cracking_down on corruption. &quot; ) After his congressional testimony , recalls Myers , he was contacted by Taiwan ' s diplomatic office in Washington , the Coordination Council for North_America , and invited to lunch . &quot; They wanted to know where I had gotten my information and how much I knew. &quot; Hardly surprising . But then came a call from a man who identified himself as an investigator , based in New York , with Taiwan ' s Ministry of Justice . He , too , wanted information . When Myers checked with his U.S. law_enforcement contacts , however , he was told that the caller was actually a member of Taiwan ' s intelligence bureau . Because the incident involved a nation on the criteria list , a State_Department official advised him to contact the FBI . Since it was about that time that a_couple_of relevant files were stolen from his locked car , Myers did just that . A federal_official later told him that the Taiwan agent , who used the name David Ho , had been expelled from the country . * Whether or not senior Taiwan officials are involved , corruption is undoubtedly what greases the ever-shifting pathways of migrant smuggling , from police_stations in seaside villages near Fuzhou , to INS offices in New York or San Francisco -- and everywhere in between . When gross earnings are in the billions , then millions in bribes becomes an acceptable cost of business . A typical $ 30 # 000 air-smuggling package , for example , begins with the routine purchase of a genuine People ' s Republic_of_China passport : $ 500 plus another $ 250 for the exit permit , payable in cash or kind to one ' s local police . The luxury class of smuggling routes -- direct from China to the United States -- is available to those who can find and afford an &quot; official government business &quot; passport , issued by the foreign ministry rather than the public_security ministry , and seldom challenged by the INS . Add $ 15 # 000 . A recent incident suggests just how deeply the smuggling business has corrupted officials in Fujian . Sometime last year , Hong Kong police were tipped_off about a protection-racket shakedown . They set_up a sting , but wound_up arresting the wrong men . Two of them , by coincidence , were holding drugs -- ice -- so the police conducted a thorough search . They soon discovered that the six men , all from Fuzhou , were snakeheads . And among their possessions , police found a little black_book with the names and home phone_numbers of dozens of senior government and Communist_Party leaders in Fujian . &quot; It ' s frustrating , &quot; says the U.S. federal_agent who told me about the incident . &quot; We know exactly where the bad_guys are -- down to the hotel_room numbers in Fuzhou -- but we can ' t do anything about it. &quot; Nor , it seems , can the central government in Beijing . Mainland China -- the head of the payoff trail -- has just concluded a yearlong anti-corruption campaign , the most virulent in the post-Mao era , resulting in tens of thousands of arrests and hundreds of executions . Every sector has been infected : foreign trade , the military , railways , housing , education , even the family_planning bureaucracy and the media . But the campaign , even by official accounts , has had scant impact , for corruption in China has already become a way_of_life . When a utilities official in Fujian was arrested for accepting bribes and kickbacks , to cite a typical case , another 110 cadres in state-run banks , construction companies and other government_offices were also implicated . And the police , military and judiciary have themselves been deeply affected . Prisoners routinely buy their way_out of jail , naval_units engage in piracy on the high_seas and senior police officials operate big-city prostitution rings , run extortion rackets and relicense thousands of luxury automobiles stolen from Hong Kong and the United States . There is , in addition , ample evidence of a growing link with organized_crime groups , &quot; nearly all_of which have government officials behind them , &quot; conceded a government-run newspaper . A confidential report by the Royal Hong Kong Police ' s Anti-Triad unit documents extensive contacts between Hong Kong ' s most powerful triad leaders and senior Communist officials in Beijing , some of whom have publicly characterized triad members as &quot; patriotic &quot; and invited them to set_up businesses in China . A Chinese-American businessman who was in Fuzhou at_the_same_time as Li tells another revealing story , one that established a connection between Taiwan and mainland_China . Shortly after I had interviewed police officials in Taiwan for this article , a senior Communist official in Fuzhou approached the businessman and handed him a piece_of_paper with my name written in English . &quot; Do you know this person ? &quot; the official asked . The official , it turned_out , had gotten a warning call from someone in Taiwan about my investigation . The anti-corruption campaign has been no more effective in stemming the flow of migrants from Fujian . &quot; It ' s pretty much business as usual , &quot; says the Chinese-American businessman . &quot; I personally know 15 people who left while I was still there and were already in New York when I came_back a month later. &quot; And wherever safe-houses and transit points appear along the smuggling trail , corruption is not far behind . Last fall , Mousa , the minister for immigration in Belize , was sacked for accepting huge bribes from Chinese smugglers . Then , in July , the regional chief of the Mexican immigration service in Tijuana and two of his deputies were dismissed and charged with corruption . Such revelations did not surprise INS investigators , who have long known that Li and other Chinese smugglers had secured the services of officials in Mexico , Central_America and more recently the Caribbean . But the July arrest of one of their colleagues in San Francisco did . INS Deputy Assistant Director William Tait is suspected of having sold green_cards -- primarily to Chinese customers , according to one source -- for more_than a decade , according to the indictment and other court documents . &quot; There is more corruption within the INS than the government cares to admit , &quot; comments Myers . When Myers discovered several INS clerks in the New York City office accepting bribes from ethnic Chinese , he collected evidence -- including tape-recorded conversations -- in cooperation with the Office of the Inspector_General , which monitors corruption in government_agencies . &quot; It ' s been more_than a year now , and the same clerks are still selling employment authorization cards . When I inquired recently , the OIG said the investigation had been moved to another unit. &quot; While acknowledging that &quot; the potential problem of Asian organized crime is much , much larger &quot; on the West Coast than Russian and Jamaican crime syndicates , or even the Mafia , Yamaguchi , the U.S. attorney in San Francisco , insists that law_enforcement is not too far behind the curve . &quot; It has not yet affected our political and financial institutions. &quot; But that may be wishful_thinking . Employees at banks , telephone , utility and insurance_companies in New York produced thousands of fraudulently pre- dated receipts and statements to support false residency claims for Chinese nationals trying to prove they had entered the United States before April , 1990 -- the cutoff for eligibility for permanent residence under an executive order signed by George_Bush . The IRS has also uncovered banking fraud and money-laundering schemes related to immigrant smuggling , according to one investigator , though indictments have yet to be handed_down . Triad figures in Hong Kong and Taiwan have also cultivated friends in high places , including the U.S. Congress . When a known officer of the notorious Sun Yee On triad attempted to circumvent laws forbidding his entry into the United States , he enlisted the help of a congressman , since voted_out of office , to secure a visa with a &quot; waiver of criminal activity. &quot; The congressman lobbied with INS officials on his behalf , though to no avail . &quot; U.S. law_enforcement has set its sights too low , &quot; comments Myers , who recently spoke before the 16th Annual International Asian Organized Crime Conference , a gathering of prosecutors , cops and investigators from around the world . &quot; Chinese criminal syndicates do not begin and end with street gangs and tongs . that ' s just the hired muscle. &quot; But even catching_up_with the lower echelons has not been easy . * Jorge Guzman , the INS investigator , had just returned to Los Angeles after a stint in Washington when his unit received a tip that a Chinese couple wanted to charter a vessel to ferry passengers from another boat to shore . Posing as the captain of a large pleasure_boat called the Corinthian , he arranged to be introduced , meeting the couple_on the boat in the San Pedro harbor . &quot; I drove a hard bargain , &quot; he says , breaking_into a grin . &quot; When they offered $ 30 # 000 , I said , ' It ' s got_to be $ 50 # 000 , and you ' re going to pay me half up front. ' The man said , ' I don ' t have the authority to make that type of decision. ' So he pulled_out a cellular_phone and made calls to the East Coast , Hong Kong and Taiwan. &quot; Finally the deal was struck : $ 42 # 500 , half up front . After the money was delivered , the next phase of the undercover operation unfolded like clockwork . Working with a crew of federal_agents , Guzman steered the Corinthian 300 miles offshore and picked_up 132 Chinese nationals . Once ashore , says Guzman , &quot; we transported them in government undercover vehicles to a parking_lot where they were , in turn , picked_up by other Chinese and taken_to a drop house in Garden Grove . They stayed there for three days . We allowed one group to go_back to New York , where they were supposed to be followed , but there was a miscommunication -- the press was there waiting -- so we had to arrest them. &quot; Despite the glitch , Operation Dry_Dock , carried_out in summer , 1991 , was a stunning success . Besides the arrests , the sting yielded a mother lode of valuable intelligence about the smuggling networks . Though the case was dismissed by the lower courts on a technicality , the government won on appeal and went_back to trial earlier this month . &quot; Dry_Dock was one of the finest undercover operations it has been my pleasure to work with , &quot; says Assistant U.S. Atty . Walsh , who is handling the prosecution . But it was the first and last time Guzman and his team have been allowed to run a sting . Seven times since then the L.A. anti-smuggling unit has submitted requests to do similar operations , and seven times they have been turned_down . The rejections became especially frustrating after President Clinton outlined his strategy for combatting migrant smuggling while announcing the appointment of a new INS commissioner in June , 1993 . Less than two weeks earlier , the Golden Venture had run_aground in New York , causing both concern and embarrassment . &quot; We can ' t afford to lose_control of_our_own borders , &quot; Clinton proclaimed , pounding the lectern . ' Deterring this transport in human cargo and traffic in human misery is a priority for our Administration. &quot; The Clinton plan was threefold . First , introduce legislation that would increase the penalties for alien smuggling from a_couple_of years to at least 10 , allow prosecutors to use the same racketeering statutes that worked so well against the Mafia and make_it easier to repatriate smuggled migrants . The second policy prong : interdict boats on the high_seas . Returning would-be immigrants before they landed would , it was hoped , deter others . The third part of the plan was music to Guzman ' s ears . &quot; We will strengthen law_enforcement efforts in the United States by expanding our investigative efforts , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; We will go_after smugglers and their operations at the source. &quot; That was precisely what Dry_Dock was about . More_than a year later , however , the Clinton plan is in a shambles . His omnibus crime bill finally made_it through Congress , but all_the anti- smuggling legislation he had called_for was dropped , including the provision that Administration officials wanted most : summary exclusion , the power to return illegal immigrants quickly . &quot; We ' re right back where we started , &quot; says Jack Shaw , the assistant INS commissioner for investigations . &quot; The smugglers are carrying_out their activities with impunity. &quot; Why , in the words of assistant district director Hayes , is the INS &quot; less able today to appropriately respond to pressing criminal alien-smuggling incidents than ever before &quot; ? One reason , he says , is the orphaned state of anti- smuggling programs , which seem to have disappeared from INS organizational charts . A lengthy memo outlining a major INS overhaul , in_effect as of July 1 , fails to even mention that category . &quot; The INS is the bastard child of the Justice_Department , &quot; quipped one field agent , &quot; and alien-smuggling is the bastard child of INS. &quot; &quot; Whatever is accomplished here , &quot; says Hayes , &quot; is done through force of will . The bottom_line is that Chinese aliens are still coming and there ' s no apparatus in place nationwide to handle that level of activity . The Chinese are much , much more organized and sophisticated than any other organization we have seen. &quot; Interdiction has proven to be a cumbersome , nightmarish procedure . Each time a boat is seized at_sea , it paralyzes the resources of local INS and Coast Guard units -- sometimes for weeks at a time -- and requires complicated international negotiations with China and the vessel ' s flag country ( usually Taiwan ) . And because the United States does not want to give smuggled migrants access to the asylum procedure by allowing them onto U.S. soil , it strong-arms neighboring countries into serving as a transit depot for processing and repatriation . Mexico took_on those functions last year , but has since refused to do_it again . What ' s more , interdiction has not worked as a deterrent . Fewer ships have been sighted this year , but that only means that smugglers have adapted and gone_back to using air routes , or combinations of commercial flights and small_ships leaving from the Dominican_Republic and the Bahamas . Worst of all , from Guzman ' s perspective , the interdiction policy prevents him from doing his job and prosecuting smugglers to put them out of business . When asked whether that makes his job more difficult , he lets_out a bone-rattling sigh . Long pause . &quot; We do the best we can. &quot; Walsh is less circumspect . &quot; With this policy in place , there is little room -- none , in my judgment -- for the calculated , proactive , intelligence-based work that might lead to uncovering and prosecuting snakeheads. &quot; Nothing illustrates this quandary better than the Jin Yinn 1 , a 168-foot Taiwanese converted fishing trawler first spotted by the Coast Guard 350 miles from Los Angeles on April 9 . The L.A. INS anti-smuggling unit once again proposed an undercover operation , and once again it was rejected . Instead , it was told to intercept the ship and conduct interviews on board . It took a month of pursuit on the high_seas , international negotiations and costly travel , but that is exactly what happened . As the process unfolded , Guzman felt sure that there was enough evidence to bring the captain , possibly the crew , back to the United States for prosecution . Walsh agreed . They had statements from about 20 passengers who had been subjected_to or witnessed beatings with electric stun guns and lead pipes . Moreover , they said , the captain had threatened to kill anyone who cooperated with U.S. authorities . He even boasted to a U.S. interpreter that he had powerful connections to the United Bamboo Gang that would shield him from prosecution . In the end , the migrants were repatriated to China from Guatemala , and Taiwan exercised its right under international_law to prosecute its own citizens . &quot; There was no pressure , &quot; Shaw complains . &quot; When it ' s a case of diplomatic versus law_enforcement priorities , the State_Department develops an endemic condition called weak knees. &quot; For now then , Li is out_of_reach while Guzman tries to stave_off an ulcer , not because he has a price on his head , but because politics , foreign_policy and bureaucratic ineptitude have tied his hands .</TEXT>
