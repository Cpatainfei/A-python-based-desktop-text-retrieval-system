   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; O.C. DEBACLE , INFLATION FEARS SEND STOCKS , DOLLAR LOWER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s bankruptcy filing and inflation warnings from Federal_Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan rattled financial markets Wednesday , sending stocks and the dollar lower and long-term bond yields_up . As on Tuesday , some investors sold stocks and bonds and put their cash into short-term Treasury_bills , considered a safe haven in times of trouble . On Wall_Street , the Dow industrial average lost just 10.43 points to 3 # 735.52 , but that masked a heavy selloff in the broad market . Losers outnumbered winners 15 to 7 on the New York Stock_Exchange and 18 to 10 on the Nasdaq market . The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks tumbled 6.96 points , or almost 1 % , to 734.27. Analysts said Orange County ' s surprise bankruptcy filing late Tuesday cast a negative pall over the stock_market , adding another element of concern to an already jittery market . The dollar also was weakened , experts said , because currency traders fear the Orange County debacle could be a harbinger of troubles faced by much larger investors that made similar , highly leveraged bets_on bonds .

In New York , the dollar closed at 99.94 Japanese yen and 1.568 German marks , down from 100.08 yen and 1.572 marks Tuesday . Investors also weren ' t happy with Greenspan ' s testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress . He said that economic_growth has been stronger than expected and that consumer inflation could start to rise -- speculation that many analysts took_to mean the Fed isn ' t through raising short-term interest_rates to slow the economy . In the bond market , municipal_bonds were down sharply in price nationwide , reflecting investors ' concerns about the health of states , counties and other municipalities in the wake of Orange County ' s shocking bankruptcy filing . The Treasury_bond market was mixed . Yields on longer-term issues rose slightly , reflecting Greenspan ' s inflation warnings , analysts said . But yields on short-term T-bills dove for a second day , as investors sought a safe place to stash cash . The yield on six-month T-bills slid to 6.38 % from 6.52 % on Tuesday . Among other market highlights : * Shares of major securities firms that are creditors to Orange County fell sharply on the bankruptcy news . Merrill Lynch dropped 1 1 / 4 to 35 and Morgan Stanley slumped 1 5 / 8 to 56 7 / 8 .
