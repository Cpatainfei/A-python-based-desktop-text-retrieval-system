   <HEADLINE> CLINTON TO URGE END OF BOSNIA ARMS EMBARGO IF SERBS BALK ; BALKANS : U.S. WILL ASK U.N. TO LIFT CURBS IN OCTOBER , MAY SUPPLY MUSLIMS , UNLESS PEACE PLAN IS ACCEPTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , hoping to head_off a confrontation with Congress , said in a letter made public Thursday that he will urge the U.N. Security_Council to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina if Bosnian Serb forces do not agree to a peace plan by mid-October . In the letter to Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Clinton also indicated that he would end American compliance with the embargo , permitting Washington to send weapons to the Muslim-led government , if the Security_Council fails to act &quot; within a reasonable period_of_time , &quot; presumably sometime in November . The President ' s latest formula for dealing with the bloody ethnic conflict parallels a provision written by House and Senate negotiators into the compromise defense authorization bill . The provision would prohibit the Pentagon from spending_money to enforce the embargo after Nov . 15 if the warring factions have not agreed on a settlement by then . Although Clinton ' s words had the sound of an ultimatum , the President , in_effect , gave the rebel Bosnian Serbs two more months to hold_out against a peace proposal advanced last month by the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany that would give the Serbs 49 % of Bosnia ' s territory , a substantial rollback from the 70 % they now control . &quot; If by Oct . 15 , the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted the proposal , it would be my intention within two weeks to introduce formally and support a resolution in the United Nations Security_Council to terminate the arms embargo &quot; on the Bosnian government , Clinton wrote . &quot; Further . . if the Security_Council for some reason fails to pass such a resolution within a reasonable period_of_time , it would be my intention to consult with the Congress thereafter regarding unilateral termination of the arms embargo. &quot; With Congress firmly on record in favor of ending the embargo , Clinton ' s position would seem to leave him with no alternative other_than to lift the weapons ban unilaterally if the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted a peace settlement by November . Administration officials said Clinton is reluctant to take such an action because &quot; there are considerable downsides diplomatically and politically. &quot; The President ' s pledge to consult with Congress about the_matter sometime in November appears intended to gain a little time and prevent the lawmakers from forcing his hand . When the five big powers submitted their proposed settlement , they warned of &quot; consequences &quot; if all factions did not accept the plan by July 30 . The Muslim-led government and its Bosnian Croat allies accepted but the Bosnian Serbs did not . The five nations postponed a decision on how to punish the recalcitrant party . On Capitol_Hill , Nunn urged advocates of American unilateral action , led by Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , to give Clinton ' s latest policy a chance to work . In his letter to the lawmakers , Clinton said the embargo &quot; has unfairly and unintentionally penalized the victim in this conflict. &quot; But he added that action by the United States to unilaterally end the embargo -- in_effect defying a mandatory resolution of the Security_Council -- &quot; would have serious implications going well beyond the conflict in Bosnia itself. &quot; &quot; Our relations with our Western European allies would be seriously strained and the cohesiveness of ( the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ) threatened , &quot; he wrote . &quot; Our efforts to build a mature and cooperative relationship with Russia would be damaged . It would also greatly increase American responsibility for the outcome of the conflict . The likelihood of greater U.S. military involvement in Bosnia would be increased , not decreased. &quot; In Sarajevo on Thursday , two U.N. relief planes were hit by gunfire , shutting_down the vital airlift of aid to the capital just two days after it had resumed after an 18-day halt , news_agencies reported . Sniper fire increased and convoys of government soldiers were sent to a combat_zone north of the city . The incidents indicated that a 7-month-old break_in the warfare around Sarajevo may be about to end . Maj . Dacre Holloway , a U.N. spokesman , said that bullet_holes were discovered in the planes after they returned safely to bases in Ancona , Italy , and the Croatian port of Split . No one was injured . U.N. peacekeepers also said that as_many as 3 # 000 government troops moved to battlefronts just north of Sarajevo on Tuesday and Wednesday , the Associated Press reported . Buses and trucks loaded with more soldiers flowed in Thursday . The offensive apparently is aimed at breaking the Serbian siege of the city , which has been cut_off from the rest of Bosnia for most of the war .</TEXT>
