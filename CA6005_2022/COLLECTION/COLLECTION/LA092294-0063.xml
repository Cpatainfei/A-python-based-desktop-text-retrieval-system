   <HEADLINE> ANIMALS : CANCELLATION OF FAIR ' S ELEPHANT RIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Education and Action for Animals commends Mayor Steve Napolitano and the City_Council for protecting the safety and welfare of Manhattan Beach residents and fair-goers by canceling the traditional elephant ride at the 1994 Old Home Town fair . For two years , EAA has been lobbying against elephant rides at the fair due_to the danger of having a wild animal involved in capture , training and constant transport . Education and Action for Animals , under no circumstances , sanctions or supports the use of any animals at the fair . In our continuing efforts to educate the public about the cruelty and danger involved with exotic animal novelties , we will staff a booth at this year ' s fair in the free-speech area . KATHY YANDELL Yandell is executive_director of Education and Action for Animals .</TEXT>
