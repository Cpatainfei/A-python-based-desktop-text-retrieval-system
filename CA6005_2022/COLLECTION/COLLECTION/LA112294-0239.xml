   <HEADLINE> NATO JETS ATTACK SERBIAN REBEL GUN POSITIONS , AIR_BASE ; BALKANS : THE LIMITED RAID IS A RESPONSE TO SORTIES BY NATIONALISTS AGAINST THE BOSNIAN CITY OF BIHAC . ACTION IS THE FIRST UNDER A NEW POLICY AUTHORIZING WIDER STRIKES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Western warplanes launched a limited attack on a Serbian nationalist air_base and on missile and antiaircraft artillery sites in south-central Croatia on Monday , destroying the air_defenses and making the runways and taxiways unusable , U.S. and allied officials said . The attack , carried_out by North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization warplanes in retaliation for this month ' s three sorties by Serbian rebels near the Bosnian city of Bihac , marked the most extensive strike that the alliance has launched in its 1 1 / 2-year effort to protect U.N.-sanctioned &quot; safe areas &quot; in Bosnia-Herzegovina . About 40 NATO aircraft -- including 30 combat planes , two-thirds of which were American F-16Cs , F-15Es and F / A-18Ds -- took_part in the attack , launched at 11:30 a.m. ( 2:30 a.m. PST ) from five separate NATO bases in Italy . Officials said that all_the aircraft returned to their bases undamaged . Pentagon officials said that the strikes knocked_out one Serbian-controlled SA-6 surface-to-air_missile battery and some antiaircraft artillery pieces and left five large craters in the airfield runway , blocking the use of the accompanying taxiways as well . As in previous NATO air strikes , the raid was carefully limited to minimize the risk that it would spur either Serbian nationalists or Croats to widen the war . U.S. military experts said that the airfield could be repaired easily . Nevertheless , allied officials said , the strike succeeded in &quot; sending a message &quot; that the United Nations and NATO allies &quot; will not tolerate the use of bases in Croatia for military operations in Bosnia. &quot; President Clinton , in a session with reporters , called the NATO strike &quot; a strong and entirely appropriate response. &quot; &quot; we ' ll just have to see how events develop , &quot; he said . &quot; But I strongly support the NATO action. &quot; And Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher warned that if Serbian nationalists do not stop using their warplanes to bomb Bihac , NATO fighters &quot; will not hesitate &quot; to return with orders to do substantially more damage than they did Monday . It was not immediately clear what impact Monday ' s raid would have_on the Bosnian Serbs . Bosnian government reports said that ground fighting in the Bihac area was continuing , but it seemed likely that the Serbian-controlled bombing would be interrupted at least temporarily . U.S. Adm . Leighton W . Smith , commander of the NATO operation , said that the allied air armada scored &quot; good hits &quot; in the area . But he added : &quot; It ' s fairly easy to fill_up a hole in an airfield , so I don ' t expect this . . . to be out_of_commission for an awfully long time. &quot; The raid was the first under a new U.N.-NATO get-tough policy that extended the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone previously maintained only over Bosnia and authorized NATO warplanes to strike at multiple targets , rather than using &quot; pinprick &quot; raids against a single tank . Monday ' s action came_after Bosnian Serb forces , backed by renegade Muslim troops , attacked Bosnian government soldiers throughout northwestern Bosnia early Monday , defying a U.N. threat to launch the NATO air strikes if the Serbs did not stop . Serbian-controlled warplanes had used the Udbina airfield as a base for launching air strikes on Bihac , an enclave held by the renegade Muslims until its capture in August by Bosnian government forces . On Saturday , the U.N. Security_Council voted to allow NATO to expand the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone , which has prohibited Bosnian Serb warplanes from flying over the country . Under the embargo , any Serbian plane caught violating the restrictions is subject_to being shot down . Despite all_the warnings by U.S. and NATO officials , policy-makers here stressed that the allies were acting gingerly to avoid any spread of the ground fighting into Croatia . &quot; Both the Bosnian government and the Croatian government understand that we do not intend to support any action by them that would widen the war , and we made that point strongly to both Zagreb and Sarajevo , &quot; a U.S. official said later . The official also denied that the raid marked the beginning of any new allied effort to push the Serbs to the peace table by using military_force . &quot; We continue to believe that the war should end by ( adoption of the peace ) agreement ( brokered by the United Nations ) , &quot; he said . Military officials said that Monday ' s raid lasted an hour and 45 minutes . Following standard procedures , allied warplanes first swept in to knock_out Serbian nationalist air-defense positions , paving the way for bombing_runs . The Serbs fired a missile at the planes but apparently missed . U.S. officials said that the NATO aircraft used laser-guided bombs to create craters at the intersections of five key runways and taxiways , rendering the airfield temporarily useless , and fired cluster_bombs and Maverick missiles at the air-defense facilities . But planners said they intentionally did not destroy the 15 to 20 Serbian nationalist fighter planes that were parked on a nearby apron , even though it is precisely this kind of aircraft that the Serbs have been using to bombard Bihac . &quot; As a military proposition , they clearly could have been struck , &quot; one U.S. official said . But he said the raid was sufficient to send the desired message and said that strategists wanted to limit the possible danger to people . U.S. officials also took pains to point_out that the decision to limit the scope of the mission was made jointly by U.N. and NATO strategists . They said it was &quot; clear &quot; that Smith had &quot; agreed with the judgment . . . that this was the appropriate level. &quot; The Administration has been criticized by members of Congress for allowing the United Nations to control too_much of the decision-making for such missions . Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) said Monday that it seems as though NATO is becoming subordinate to the United Nations . Besides the U.S. F-16Cs , F-15Es and F / A-18Ds , the attack force included British Jaguar fighters , French Mirage 2000s and Dutch NF-16Cs . About 10 or 12 support aircraft , including airborne warning and control_system planes , also took_part . Meanwhile , in Sarajevo , heavy gunfire broke_out again late Monday near the Holiday Inn , the temporary headquarters of the U.S. Embassy . U.S. Ambassador Victor Jackovic took refuge for a short time in the hotel ' s basement garage . Wire_services reported that Serbian-fired &quot; Sagger &quot; guided missiles hit the roof of the Bosnian presidency building and near the city government building next door , injuring three people . Sniper fire halted the city ' s tram service . The Bosnian Serbs also shelled government-held Tuzla and several other areas of northern and northwestern Bosnia . Bombing Raid About 40 NATO aircraft participated in bombing Serbian targets in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina early Monday morning . MAIN TARGET : 1 ) Udbina : NATO warplanes bomb an airfield in Serbian-held Croatia used as staging point for recent air_raids on Bihac . SERBIAN REACTION : 2 ) Northwestern Bosnia : Serbian forces , backed by renegade Muslim fighters , attack government troops . 3 ) Sarajevo : Sniper fire intensifies as two missiles strike Bosnian government buildings . 4 ) Tuzia : Bosnian Serb forces conduct hourly shelling of Tuzla in retaliation for bombings .
