   <HEADLINE> THE TIMES POLL ; 62 % WOULD BAR SERVICES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Supported by virtually every segment of the electorate , Proposition 187 -- the ballot initiative denying most government services to illegal immigrants -- would win by an overwhelming margin if the November election were held today , the Los Angeles Times Poll has found . Among likely voters , the sweeping measure is favored by 62 % to 29 % . Among all registered voters , the split is almost identical : 62 % to 28 % . In recent weeks , a coalition of mainstream education , health and law_enforcement organizations have launched a drive to defeat the measure , which includes a provision that proponents acknowledge runs counter to a U.S. Supreme Court decision mandating public education for illegal immigrants . Poll Director John Brennan cautioned that the poll was taken before either side has begun an intensive ad_campaign and noted that many voters remain unaware of the details of the measure . But Brennan said the current across-the-board support , fueled by a strong anti-immigrant tide , presents the opponents with a daunting task . The Times poll showed that Proposition 187 is favored by Democrats as well as Republicans , middle-of-the-roaders and conservatives , and voters of both sexes and all age_groups , income levels and educational backgrounds . Even among the small base of Latino registered voters -- Latinos account_for less than 10 % of the electorate but make_up about 25 % of California ' s population -- the restrictive measure was favored in the poll by 52 % to 42 % . Moreover , the reason most often cited by poll respondents for supporting Proposition 187 was a strong gut feeling rather than any specific provisions in the measure . Among registered voters , 34 % of those who favor it said they would vote for Proposition 187 because &quot; something has to be done &quot; about illegal immigration . The next most frequently cited reason -- given by 18 % of Proposition 187 supporters -- was that the measure would stop immigrants from using public_services . &quot; Much of the pro-187 momentum seems founded on sheer frustration rather than on specifics , &quot; Brennan said . &quot; It ' s as if some people are saying : ' Do something , anything , no matter what it is. ' &quot; A second get-tough measure on the November ballot , the &quot; three strikes &quot; crime initiative that calls_for prison sentences of 25 years to life for third-time felony offenders , also is finding strong support , according to the Times poll . Among likely voters , Proposition 184 , which mirrors state &quot; three strikes &quot; legislation that took_effect earlier this year , is favored by 59 % to 29 % . Despite the high levels of support for both measures , &quot; there ' s still a fairly high level of indecision , &quot; Brennan said . &quot; That leaves room for campaigns to move voters around. &quot; Respondents were asked a pair of questions about each initiative . In the case of Proposition 184 , 46 % of likely voters who read only the ballot label said they had not heard about the measure or did not know how they would vote . Among those who were aware , supporters far outnumbered detractors , 42 % to 12 % . With the measure on illegal immigration , 44 % of likely voters said -- before being read a longer summary -- that they had not heard or read anything about the measure or didn ' t know how they would vote . But those already knowledgeable backed it by a wide margin of 39 % to 17 % . &quot; Proposition 187 already has over twice as_many core supporters as detractors , &quot; Brennan said . &quot; The opponents have their work cut_out for them. &quot; The readings of 59 % to 29 % for Proposition 184 and 62 % to 29 % for Proposition 187 came_after poll_takers summarized the measures . Less than two months before the election , two other major issues -- Proposition 186 , which calls_for a state-run health system , and Proposition 188 , the tobacco industry-backed initiative to establish statewide regulations on smoking restrictions -- have made a weaker impression on voters . About two-thirds of likely voters have not heard enough about the measures to form an opinion . The single-payer health initiative , which could involve $ 75 billion in government funds to administer a statewide health system , trails by a wide margin -- 23 % to 63 % . Those results were obtained after the measure was described . The smoking initiative is a statistical tossup . Among likely voters , 47 % are in favor and 45 % opposed . Those figures were based on a description of ballot language . Respondents were not told that the measure is backed by tobacco giant Philip Morris . Other polls have shown that voters turn against the measure when so informed . The Times Poll conducted telephone_interviews with 1 # 503 adults statewide , including 1 # 165 registered voters and 721 likely voters , from Sept . 8 to Sept . 11 . The margin of sampling error for registered voters is 3 points in either direction ; for likely voters it is 4 points in either direction . The margin of error for certain subgroups of voters may be somewhat higher . The responses to Proposition 187 and related questions make clear that immigration remains a hot_issue in California , trailing crime and the economy and running neck and neck with education as the most frequently mentioned problem facing the state . In a Times poll last September , 92 % of registered voters said illegal immigration into California was a problem . In the new poll , the figure was 90 % . Moreover , 42 % of the state ' s registered voters say in the new poll that they believe that legal immigration into California is a problem . Nonetheless , there is little evidence that Proposition 187 -- or for that matter any of the other ballot measures -- is motivating people to vote . Only 6 % of the voters said that Proposition 187 would particularly motivate them to show_up to cast ballots , compared to 19 % for the governor ' s race between Republican incumbent Pete Wilson and Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown . Only 11 % of Latino registered voters said they would be particularly motivated to vote by Proposition 187 , and the poll showed no indication of a surge in Latino voter registration . Nor did the poll show a bloom of motivation by those describing themselves as political conservatives . Proposition 187 , co-authored by a pair of former federal Immigration and Naturalization Service officials , would bar illegal immigrants from public_schools , non-emergency health_care and social_services . To accomplish its goals , police , school officials and health providers would be required to ask people about their citizenship or immigration status and to report those they suspect of being illegal to the INS . Sponsors acknowledge that the school provision flies in the face of a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision declaring that undocumented children are entitled to a public education . But they say the initiative would trigger a new legal challenge in which the court could reverse itself . Sponsors say the measure would result in the deportation of some illegal immigrants , the &quot; self deportation &quot; of others who no longer qualify for government services and the establishment of an environment that would discourage further illegal immigration . Opponents , including the state School_Boards Assn. , the California Teachers Assn . and PTA , counter that the measure does nothing to strengthen the nation ' s borders , places at risk up_to $ 15 billion annually in federal funding to California and would establish a &quot; police_state &quot; mentality in which all immigrants and people_of_color or with accents would fall_under suspicion . By 75 % to 18 % , voters said they believe it is hard to tell the difference between illegal and legal immigrants in California . Regardless , 61 % of those who said it was difficult to differentiate said they would vote for Proposition 187 anyway . &quot; It ' s certainly a problem , &quot; said one respondent , a Sacramento lawyer , 27 , who is a registered Democrat and a third-generation Latino . &quot; But sometimes people have to bear the brunt . &quot; I hate hearing myself say these things , &quot; she continued . &quot; But I just think something needs to be done. &quot; Poll respondents said the two greatest problems caused by illegal immigration were the use of government services and welfare -- cited by 43 % -- and taking jobs from Americans -- cited by 22 % . Only 7 % of respondents said they believed that illegal immigration causes no problems . Most voters said they have had some contact with illegal immigrants , including 23 % who said they have seen illegal immigrants on the street or in their neighborhood . Among those voters who had seen immigrants on the street , 71 % said they would vote_in favor of Proposition 187 . A total of 41 % of registered voters said they have not come_into contact with illegal immigrants in the last few years . Nonetheless , by 59 % to 28 % , those with no contact said they supported the measure . Those who oppose the measure list reasons including the public_school prohibition , beliefs that the initiative is &quot; poorly written , &quot; &quot; inhumane &quot; or &quot; costs too much. &quot; &quot; I ' d rather spend the money on beefing_up the border , &quot; said one poll respondent , a 64-year-old bookkeeper from Glendale , who is a registered Democrat . &quot; You have a problem , you go_to the source , right ? &quot; How the Poll Was Conducted The Times Poll interviewed 1 # 503 adults statewide , by telephone , Sept . 8-11 . Included in the sample were 1 # 165 registered voters and 721 likely voters . Numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the state . Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers could be contacted . Interviews were in English and Spanish . The sample was weighted slightly to conform more closely with census figures for sex , race , age and education . The margin of sampling error for the total and registered voter samples is plus or minus 3 percentage_points ; for likely voters it is 4 points . For certain subgroups , the error margin may be somewhat higher . Poll results can also be affected by factors such_as the wording of questions and the order in which they are presented . * FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION : Wilson , Brown fight over illegal immigrants .
