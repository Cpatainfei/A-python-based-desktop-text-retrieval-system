   <HEADLINE> COMMAND SENDS VENUS PROBE INTO OBLIVION ; SCIENCE : BEFORE IT DISINTEGRATES IN CRUSHING AIR_PRESSURE , MAGELLAN SHOULD GIVE ITS CREATORS AT JPL NEW INSIGHTS INTO AN ALIEN ATMOSPHERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With an electronic command whispered through a deep_space antenna in Madrid , Douglas G . Griffith at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena sent the Magellan spacecraft circling to its doom Tuesday in the superheated , acid clouds above the highest mountain on Venus . Transmitting data until the last , Magellan is expected to leave its distant creators in Pasadena with new insights into the aerodynamics of an alien atmosphere that may help them design more streamlined and fuel-efficient spacecraft . Since arriving_at Venus in 1990 , Magellan has overcome technical problems and funding cuts_to survey the topography and gravity of the planet in unprecedented detail . Beaming to Earth more_than 1 trillion bytes of digital mapping data , it revolutionized the scientific view of the brightest planet in the sky . By mapping Venus in such detail , the probe has done for the planet what the space agency now is attempting for Earth . Astronauts aboard the space shuttle Endeavour , which landed at Edwards Air_Force Base on Tuesday , spent the past 11 days scanning the home planet with a more advanced version of the synthetic aperture radar aboard Magellan . It penetrated the vegetation and crust of civilization obscuring Earth ' s surface just as Magellan ' s imaging radar peered through the clouds masking Venus . After more_than 15 # 000 orbits around the most hellishly hot planet in the solar_system , the $ 900-million spacecraft Tuesday started to spiral deeper into Venus ' hothouse atmosphere , where late today it is expected to disintegrate as the air_pressure increases to crushing levels found on Earth only in ocean depths . The probe also is gradually losing power because its solar_panels are deteriorating . In five measured rocket bursts Tuesday , the craft slowed and gradually descended to within 90 miles of the planet ' s surface near Mt . Maxwell , a Venusian peak that dwarfs Mt . Everest . Program manager Griffith and his JPL team expect to lose contact with Magellan well before it reaches the planet ' s surface . Sometime late today , &quot; it will slow_down to almost nothing and flutter down to its death , &quot; Griffith said . By studying that process , scientists hope to learn more about aerodynamics that might help them save fuel and extend the life of orbiting spacecraft . If NASA engineers , for example , can make the design of the agency ' s space_station even 10 % more efficient , they might be able to keep it in orbit longer with fewer refuelings from the space shuttle . The men and women at JPL have explored the mysterious canyons and lava fields of Venus from small beige cubicles in the laboratory ' s space operations facility , using Magellan ' s sophisticated sensors to obtain by remote_control detailed views of Venus ' volcanic domes , rills and vast craters . On Tuesday , however , they were forced to rely_on much more primitive instrument readings to monitor the condition of the craft as it descended into the planet ' s thick atmosphere . After each firing of the craft ' s rocket motors Tuesday , the scientists and technicians left their cubicles and anxiously checked the instrument readings on three small black_and_white television monitors in the Magellan operations area . They monitored fuel pressure , signal strength and power for any symptoms of distress , like parents trying to diagnose an infant ' s state_of_mind from its cryptic cries and gestures . &quot; Every time we fire a thruster , we are putting more drag_on the spacecraft , &quot; said mission planner Rob Lock . &quot; Pretty soon , the atmosphere will grab us . Temperatures will rise . . . . This is the exciting part , right when we are_on the edge of the cliff. &quot; At the last mission planning meeting on Tuesday , almost the entire project team assembled in a small conference_room to debate the spacecraft ' s final maneuver . As they reviewed the technical merits of sending the spacecraft even deeper into the atmosphere of Venus , mission director James M . Stewart passed a roll of black crepe and a pair_of_scissors down the table . One by one , the navigation specialists , operations engineers and mission planners cut themselves strips and fashioned makeshift black armbands of mourning . &quot; Sentimental ? Yes , &quot; said Lock . &quot; This has been a fabulous mission. &quot;</TEXT>
