   <HEADLINE> PHARM REPORT : BODY WATCH ; THE SUN AND SOME MEDICINES DON ' T MIX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' re on medication , either prescription or over-the-counter , here ' s what you should know before summer . The Light Problem : Certain medicines increase the skin ' s sensitivity to sunlight , sometimes resulting in a rash , a quicker-than-usual sunburn or both . This occurs because some ingredients in drugs react more intensely with sunlight than other ingredients , explains Theresa Lane , a clinical pharmacist at Northridge Hospital Medical_Center . The list of medicines that increase the skin ' s sensitivity to sunlight is long , says Fred Raleigh , director of pharmacy services for Atascadero State Hospital . The List : Commonly used drugs likely to increase sensitivity to sunlight , Raleigh and Lane say , include : * The antibiotics tetracycline , doxycycline ( Vibramycin ) and minocycline ( Minocin ) . * The anti-infection drug ciprofloxacin ( Cipro ) , prescribed for infection of the eye , urinary_tract and other problems . * Antidepressants such_as amitriptyline ( Elavil ) and imipramine ( Tofranil ) . * Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory_drugs such_as naproxen ( Anaprox , Naprosyn ) and piroxicam ( Feldene ) . Motrin and Advil do not seem to increase sensitivity to sunlight , Lane adds . * Certain diuretics such_as furosemide ( Lasix ) and hydrochlorothiazides . * The acne treatment drug isotretenoin ( Accutane ) . The Clues : Skin redness is usually the first symptom of photosensitivity . But it might not occur immediately . It ' s also possible to take a medication for a long_time and not have sensitivity problems until much later . The Best Rx : If you are taking any medicine known to increase sunlight sensitivity , avoiding the sun is the best thing to do -- both while taking the drug and for a week or so after , because medications can stay in the bloodstream . Sunscreen is a must . Raleigh recommends using one with a sun protection factor ( SPF ) of at least 25 . The Thermostat Problems : Certain medicines can hamper the body ' s built-in temperature-regulating ability , inhibiting sweating and other necessary functions . Among the drugs : antihistamines , decongestants and antidepressants . When the body ' s thermostat doesn ' t work properly , you are at risk for heat stroke , which is serious and life-threatening . Among the first symptoms : weakness , fatigue , faintness and chills . Seek medical help immediately if you suspect heat stroke . Place the victim in a cool , shady place until help arrives . The Temperature Problem : High_temperatures can cause medicine to break_down . Tetracycline is one example . You ' ll know by the very pungent smell .</TEXT>
