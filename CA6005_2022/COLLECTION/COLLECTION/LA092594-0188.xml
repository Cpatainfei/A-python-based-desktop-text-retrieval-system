   <HEADLINE> NEW U.S. CAR LABELING LAW CRITICIZED AS BEING CONFUSING ; AUTOS : CANADA IS COUNTED AS PART OF DOMESTIC MARKET . U.S. AUTO_MAKERS INSIST DISCLOSURE IS FULL AND FAIR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Looking_for a new car and you want to buy American ? Good_luck . Buyers have long been confused about what actually constitutes an &quot; American &quot; car . Is a Pontiac Firebird made in Canada with a U.S.-built engine more American than a Nissan Altima made in Tennessee with an engine from Japan ? Such questions have only gotten harder to answer as the auto industry becomes more global , foreign auto_makers move more production to the United States and trade tensions periodically erupt . And now , the confusion is about to get_even worse . Beginning Saturday , the federal_government will require auto_makers to state the total domestic content -- defined as U.S. and Canadian -- of a vehicle ' s parts and to identify foreign countries that supply significant amounts of those parts . The new law , known as the American Automobile Labeling Act , also requires car_makers to reveal where the transmission and engine parts came from and the vehicle ' s point of final assembly . Sounds simple enough . But critics -- foreign auto_makers , dealers , some suppliers and consumer groups -- say the law is poorly crafted and deliberately skewed to favor Detroit . The content labels appearing on new vehicles this fall will be confusing , misleading and in some cases inaccurate , they say . &quot; It is going_to give a lot of misinformation to consumers , &quot; said Joan Claybrook , president of Public Citizen , a Washington-based consumer group . * For example , Canadian parts are counted the same as U.S. parts , and identical cars made on the same line but badged differently -- such_as General Motors ' Geo Prizm and the Toyota Corolla -- could be credited with widely varying domestic content . The new law takes_effect as trade tensions between Japan and the United States are entering a sensitive phase . The Clinton_Administration has threatened to impose trade sanctions on Japan by Friday0 unless it lowers trade_barriers in key industries , including autos and auto parts . It also comes as Japanese and European auto_makers are moving more production to the United States and stepping_up their purchase of U.S. auto parts . Still , Detroit argues that the vehicles made at so-called transplant factories are foreign , because many of their parts come from abroad . &quot; This is a way to have a bit more truth in advertising , &quot; said Andrew Card , president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn. , the Big Three ' s lobbying group . But Jim Olson , vice_president of Toyota Motor Sales , said the law discriminates against Japanese manufacturers by discounting their U.S. manufacturing operations and U.S. parts-buying efforts . &quot; It ' s a lemon , &quot; he said of the labeling law . &quot; It ought to be recalled. &quot; While that is unlikely , the American International Automobile Dealers Assn . petitioned the government to rewrite the regulation and is threatening to challenge the law in court as &quot; unconstitutionally vague and discriminatory. &quot; The new law means auto_makers must make three different domestic content calculations : one for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to comply with corporate average fuel economy ( CAFE ) standards ; one for the U.S. Customs Service , used to set tariffs under the North_America Free_Trade Agreement , and one for National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) , which oversees the labeling law . &quot; This is government regulation run amok , &quot; said Barbara Nocera , Honda ' s manager of government relations . * The labeling law was born during the Buy American push in 1992 , which began after President Bush and a delegation of the Big Three auto_makers were rudely rebuffed in efforts to gain major trade concessions from Japan . The measure , pushed by the United Auto Workers union and reluctantly supported by the Big Three , passed as part of a highway appropriations_bill without any committee hearings . &quot; We think it gives consumers important information , &quot; said Alan Reuther , UAW legislative director and nephew of the late Walter Reuther , the legendary UAW president . &quot; The Japanese dislike it because it doesn ' t allow them to hide the fact that a large part of their parts still come from abroad. &quot; Japanese auto_makers , however , say the new law does not provide a true picture of the U.S. content of vehicles , and is designed to give the Big Three a competitive leg up by portraying them as having higher domestic content than their foreign competitors . &quot; The very title of the act is a misnomer , &quot; said Philip Hutchinson , president of the Assn . of International Automobile Manufacturers . &quot; You will never know what the American content of a vehicle is from the law. &quot; He points_out that the label lumps parts made in the United States and Canada together . This was done to placate GM , Ford and Chrysler , all_of whom have large parts operations in Canada , Hutchinson said . &quot; Canada is now the 51st state , &quot; he said . Card said that CAFE already treats U.S.-Canadian operations equally and the U.S. and Canadian auto industries have been highly integrated since 1965 , when the two countries forged a trade pact . ( The labeling law preceded the passage of NAFTA , so Mexico -- unlike Canada -- is treated as a foreign country in determining domestic content , though that may change as the Mexican auto and parts market becomes more integrated with the U.S. industry. ) * M ore distressing to the Japa nese is the disparate treatment the labeling law applies to in-house and outside suppliers . Under the law , if a manufacturer purchases a part from a wholly owned supplier , then the exact domestic content of the part counts toward the total domestic content of the vehicle . So if GM acquires a part from its AC Delco subsidiary with 85 % U.S.-Canadian content , it is credited with that amount . * But if the part is purchased from an outside supplier , the domestic content is treated differently . If the content is 70 % or more U.S.-Canadian , then it is considered to be 100 % domestic . If it is less than 70 % , it is given no value . &quot; This is misleading information , &quot; said Nocera of Honda . &quot; We think we should be able to count actual value regardless of who supplies the part. &quot; The government_noted that this so-called &quot; roll-up and roll-down &quot; provision could result in widely varying domestic content for identical vehicles made on the same line . In one hypothetical case , it said the domestic content of vehicles could vary from 53 % to 11 % depending_on the relationship of the manufacturer to the supplier . Toyota officials said that the Corolla will have a lower domestic content than its twin , the GM-made Prizm , even though both are made by the same workers on the same line using the same parts at a joint-venture plant in Fremont , Calif . The AAMA said the reason for the different treatment of suppliers is that it is easier to get accurate information from in-house suppliers . Card said it is much more difficult to trace origin when dealing with outside suppliers , who are often reluctant to share pricing information . Another criticism of the label is that it may_not reflect a vehicle ' s real domestic content , because the law requires the data to be averaged for car lines . The domestic content of a model made in the United States is combined with an imported model , even if the two use different parts sources . As a result , a Honda Accord made in Ohio will display a lower domestic content than it really has , and one imported from Japan will be have a higher content than it actually has . * The government will , however , allow manufacturers to add a footnote at the bottom of the label stating the actual domestic content for U.S.-built vehicles . The label also will carry a note that says : &quot; Parts content does not include final assembly , distribution , or other non-parts costs. &quot; This is in response to Japanese criticism that domestic content improperly excludes the value of assembly labor as well as some key operations done_in final assembly operations . The Japanese said that the exclusion is designed to reduce the domestic content of their vehicles , many of which are assembled at U.S. plants , typically with non-union work_forces . The Big Three counter that the law is designed to identify the origin of parts , not the whole car . &quot; When I buy a can of soup , the label tells me the ingredients that went_into it -- not where the can came from , &quot; Card said . Besides , he said , the label requires the manufacturers to state the city , state and country where the vehicle was assembled . Jack Gillis , spokesman for the Consumer Federation of America , said the labeling law is so complex that is likely to confuse and mislead most car shoppers . &quot; The effort , though laudable , falls_short_of giving consumers the accurate information they need to make informed decisions , &quot; he said . It also may cost consumers a little as auto_makers pass along the costs of administering the program . The government estimates auto_makers will spend about $ 13 million to gather label information in the first year . Although the law was passed in 1992 , the final rules were not published until July . As a result , NHTSA said it will accept &quot; good_faith &quot; estimates of domestic content by the auto_makers on labels until June 1 , 1995 . While Detroit ' s auto_makers have pushed the label law , much of the onus for compliance falls on their suppliers , who must trace the value and origin of parts from a myriad of vendors and sub-assemblers . &quot; There is a lot of consternation among suppliers , &quot; said Richard Fournier , a representative with the Automobile_Industry Action Group , which works with suppliers and manufacturers to reduce regulatory costs . Jim Lounsbery , vice_president of Motor Wheel Corp. , a Lansing , Mich.-based wheel and brake supplier , said his company views the labeling regulations as a cost of doing business . &quot; But my personal opinion is I ' m not sure it helps the consumer , &quot; he said . Dealers also are skeptical , fearing the labels will increase the cynicism of consumers about car sales practices . &quot; This will only add confusion , &quot; said Fred Miller , a Van Nuys car_dealer who sells both Japanese and domestic-brand vehicles . Some industry officials believe the labeling law could backfire on the Big Three , revealing to the public how many of their vehicles are built outside the United States and equipped with foreign parts . &quot; GM is so big and diverse that some of the objections the importers have will affect us the same way , &quot; said one GM official , who asked not to be identified . * In a short article on the labeling law in the September issue of Solidarity magazine , the UAW warned its members that looks can be deceiving in the auto business . The union notes that the Ford Aspire is made in South_Korea by Kia Motors while the Toyota Corolla is built by UAW members in California . It also notes that foreign auto_makers make cars with UAW workers in four U.S. locations , while GM , Ford and Chrysler all import cars . The UAW , however , also notes that , in_general , the domestic content of Big Three vehicles is &quot; significantly greater &quot; than that of transplants . And union officials are hoping that the labeling law will put pressure on the Japanese to increase American buying . &quot; I think the labeling law will force them to buy more U.S. parts , &quot; said Reuther . A number of Japanese auto_makers are doing just that . Recently , for instance , Toyota said it would expand its U.S. production and plans to increase procurement of U.S. parts from $ 4.65 billion in 1993 to $ 6.45 billion in 1996 . Toyota ' s Olson said even without this initiative , his company did not oppose the idea of a labeling law . &quot; We are for these kinds of labels if that is what the market wants , &quot; he said . &quot; But make them fair , honest and direct. &quot; American Automobile Labeling Act On Oct . 1 , the federal_government will require auto_makers to disclose the domestic content -- defined as U.S. and Canadian -- of the parts of vehicles sold in the United States . Here is a sample of how the new label will look and read . Parts Content Information For vehicles in the carline : U.S. / Canadian parts content : 50 % Major source of foreign parts content : Japan 25 % Mexico 15 % For this vehicle : Final assembly point : Detroit , Mich. , U.S.A. Country_of_Origin : Engine : United States Transmission : Japan Note : Parts content does not include final assmebly , distribution , or other non-parts costs . This car line is assembled in the U.S. and Japan . The U.S. / Canadian parts content for the portion of the carline assembled in the United States is 75 % . The U.S. / Canadian parts content for the portion of the carline assembled in Japan is 25 % . * PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION Legislation is supposed to provide information about the domestic content of parts in vehicles . Label is to be displayed on window of vehicle when offered for_sale . * FOR VEHICLES IN THIS CARLINE Carline is defined as models of the same vehicle regardless of where manufactured . Domestic content is averaged for all vehicles is a carline . * U.S. / CANADIAN PARTS CONTENT Includes the percentage of a vehicle ' s parts including all material and labor costs that original in U.S. or Canada . * MAJOR SOURCE OF FOREIGN PARTS CONTENT Lists the top two countries outside the United States and Canada that provide a vehicles parts that exceed 15 % . Must include percentage of content from those countries . * FINAL ASSEMBLY POINT Identifies the city , state and country where a vehicle was assembled . * ENGINE and TRANSMISSION Country_of_origin for the engine and transmission must be disclosed . The United States and Canada are considered separately here . * NOTE Explains that the value of assemble labor , some final assembly operations , sales and marketing operations not included in calculations of domestic content for parts . * VEHICLES ASSEMBLED IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY If a carline is manufactured in more_than one country , the manufacturer has the option of including information at the bottom of the label that discloses U.S. / Canadian parts content for models made in each country . If used , the U.S. / Canadian parts content must be disclosed for models made in every country .
