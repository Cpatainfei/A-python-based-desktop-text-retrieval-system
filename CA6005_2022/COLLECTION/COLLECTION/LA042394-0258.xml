   <HEADLINE> NORTHRIDGE MEN IN STEP FOR FINAL VOLLEYBALL BREAKTHROUGH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> That last step is a real lulu . In each of the past four years , the Cal State Northridge men ' s volleyball team has inched a little closer to a national title . In 1990 , the Matadors earned their first postseason tournament berth . They lost in the first round . In 1991 , they advanced to the semifinals before losing . The following season , they won two matches and fell_in the tournament final . Then , last season , Northridge won the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament and advanced to the NCAA Final Four . All that ' s left now is to win it . But first , there is the fairly daunting task of earning a return trip . Northridge ( 17-9 ) needs three consecutive victories to win the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament title and the probable Final Four bid that comes_with it . The Matadors open tournament play today at 4 p.m. against Pepperdine ( 13-8 ) in Stanford ' s Maples Pavilion . In other first-round action , Brigham Young ( 19-5 ) plays Hawaii ( 14-13 ) at 11 a.m. , USC ( 16-6 ) meets San Diego State ( 17-11 ) at 1:30 p.m. , and top-ranked UCLA ( 25-1 ) faces second-ranked Stanford ( 18-8 ) at 7:30 p.m. The winner of the UCLA-Stanford match is conference champion and earns the MPSF ' s automatic berth in the Final Four . The loser drops_back into the tournament semifinals , which will be played Monday at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. The tournament championship match is Tuesday at 7 p.m. , with the winner likely to receive the only at-large berth in the NCAA Final Four , May 6-7 in Fort Wayne , Ind . Northridge defeated USC , Pepperdine and Cal State Long_Beach in the MPSF tournament last season , then downed Penn State in the NCAA semifinals before being swept by UCLA in the title match . &quot; It will be tough to top last year , but we ' ve improved every year , &quot; Northridge Coach John Price said . &quot; I don ' t know what we ' ll do if we win it . Go_to the Caribbean and retire , I think. &quot; Pepperdine leads the series with Northridge , 19-11 , but the Matadors have won 10 of the last 12 meetings , including the only two matches this season . Northridge swept the Waves at Pepperdine on March 23 and rallied to win April 13 at Northridge .</TEXT>
