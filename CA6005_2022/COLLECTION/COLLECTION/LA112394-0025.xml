   <HEADLINE> A TREATY MUST BE MORE THAN WORDS ; MIDDLE_EAST : JORDANIAN TRUST IN THE ACCORD WITH ISRAEL AWAITS REAL CHANGES ' ON THE GROUND. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a Jordanian American , I watched history being made a_few weeks ago while I was visiting relatives and friends in Amman , Jordan . The peace_treaty , signed by Jordan and Israel on Oct . 26 , witnessed by President Clinton in Wadi-Araba and ratified by both the Israeli Knesset and the Jordanian Parliament , has paved the way for various modes of economic cooperation and trade , the exchange of ambassadors , bridge-crossing openings , tourism and joint projects to build a new , peaceful and prosperous Middle_East after decades of hostility , wars , pain and deep suspicions . But many Jordanians , including a former prime_minister , opposed the treaty ; 23 members of the 80-member Parliament including a powerful bloc of Muslim fundamentalists , voted against the treaty . Jordan , proud to call itself a democracy and a pluralistic society , experienced an intense debate about the merits and shortcomings of the accord with Israel . The forces of moderation and realism won , and immediately King Hussein joyously journeyed to the shores of the Sea of Galilee to exchange the ratification documents with Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin . In Jordan , there was a general acceptance of Israel as a neighbor , but no celebration . Many Jordanians welcomed the peace_treaty in large measure because of their faith and trust in their popular leader , King Hussein . But it was guarded optimism . To suddenly celebrate a peace_treaty after 50 years of animosity , wars , deep-seated suspicions and negative indoctrination was psychologically and emotionally not possible . What was possible , however , was the readiness of the people for peace . Will the peace_treaty endure ? Yes , if certain conditions follow . First , comprehensive peace needs to be achieved . Peace with Jordan is conditional on meaningful full autonomy and self-determination for the Palestinians . Also , it is conditional on peace between Syria and Israel . Currently , Israel is negotiating peace_treaties with each Arab state . But no lasting peace is possible unless a comprehensive peace is accomplished -- soon . Another condition for the peace process to work is speed . Islamic religious radicals are well-organized , well-financed and determined to wreck any reconciliation with the Jewish state . The best way to weaken their power is for the peace_treaty to start paying dividends as soon as possible . Then there is a need for restitution . The Palestinians must be compensated for their losses . This is a monumental task that will involve the United States , the United Nations , Israel and Arab countries . The magnitude of this refugee problem is great ; 457 Palestinian towns and villages have been destroyed by the Israeli authorities to make room for settlements since occupation of the West_Bank in 1967 . Another condition for peace requires determining the fate of Jerusalem . This is possibly the thorniest problem . Because of the great emotional and religious attachment of the Jews and the Arabs to Jerusalem , the fate of this city could determine the fate of one or all_of the peace accords . There is no reason why Jerusalem should not be the capital of both Israel and Palestine . However , it will take the wisdom of many Solomons to resolve it . There is also a need to transform attitude and outlook . Both Arabs and Jews need to dispel their negative mythologies , stereotypes and fears and start seeing each other as human_beings . Arabs need to accept that even though Israel is an outpost of Western civilization , there is much good in that tradition . Israelis must learn that although their neighbors have not yet been fully liberated from centuries of Ottoman and colonial rule , they are the heirs to a great civilization that enriched and illuminated Europe in the Middle and Dark Ages . Finally , there is the responsibility of the Arab and Jewish communities in the United States . The American Jewish community is very powerful politically , financially and socially ; it has been and is still strongly committed to the state of Israel . A symposium of reconciliation and exploration of the possibilities of peace should be sponsored by the American Jewish community in cooperation with the American Arab community . This would be a fitting undertaking to advance the cause of peace by bringing_together the best minds of both peoples for the first time in 50 years . A peace of dynamic active involvement by all would usher_in a golden_age in the biblical lands of milk and honey .</TEXT>
