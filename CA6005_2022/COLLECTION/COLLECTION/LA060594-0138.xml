   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; ROSTY : ON NOT GOING_DOWN FOR THE COUNT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Until recently , I ' ve been complacent about the controversy embroiling Rep . Dan Rostenkowski ( D-Ill. ) . It wasn ' t compelling , it lacked the drama , the flair -- the sweaty snitch es secretly taping illegal back-room transactions -- of other political corruption cases I ' d seen . Even the early allegations about bilking the congressional post_office seemed tepid and dull . Then , on Tuesday , the feds finally revealed their case , and my attitude changed . Let me tell you , I ' ve seen a lot of corruption , and this one is no piker . They ' ve charged Rostenkowski with 17 felony counts , alleging embezzlement , fraud , conspiracy and obstruction of justice . In addition to the post-office machinations , they say he took kickbacks from ghost employees . That he used government money to pay a photographer to shoot family functions . That he took personal ownership of cars , bought with taxpayer funds , from a dealership managed by his campaign chairman ' s brother . That he improperly billed taxpayers for chairs , luggage and china he then distributed as gifts to lobbyists and friends . It goes_on and on . While no fan of Rostenkowski , I now find myself surprisingly moved by his mighty fall and strangely overtaken by territorial impulses . He was , after all , my man in Congress . His house is not far from mine . I once bumped_into him on the street and he clapped me on the back and called me &quot; pal. &quot; From time to time , I ' d see him with his cronies , dining at the kind of steak joints where they pile huge hunks of meat on your plate . Rostenkowski , as I recall , favored ketchup on his steak . I figure , who the heck are these prosecutors in Washington -- these snooty Ivy League yuppies -- to tell me who my congressman can be ? I feel_like one of those Yellow Dog party loyalists , who keeps returning the same old bums , rascals and felons to office . The local papers have been going wild with some of the stranger details of this sordid saga . There was a story about lavish theme parties -- including a Western night , featuring a real chuck_wagon -- that Rostenkowski threw at taxpayers ' expense . They ran a photo of one of the alleged ghost employees -- a haggard-looking , elderly lady named Sophie , her body bent with age , who used to baby-sit for Rostenkowski ' s daughters . She probably doesn ' t know what ' s hit her . Rostenkowski denies all charges -- which doesn ' t surprise me . Most politicians say they never did_it , until after their conviction , when , pleading for leniency , they promise never to do_it again . Either that or they attack their accusers . Huey P . Long , the legendary governor and later U.S. senator from Louisiana , mastered this trick . He headed_off one impeachment movement by accusing his accusers of being henchmen for Big Oil , inciting such passions that debate turned_to fisticuffs and one legislator , standing on a desk to escape the fray , got hit by the blade of a ceiling fan . Personally , I prefer the approach of James Michael Curley , the former mayor of Boston and governor of Massachusetts . During his 50 years in politics , he served two sentences in jail . In each case , his attitude was , &quot; Yeah , I did_it . So what. &quot; He apologized for nothing and even titled his autobiography , &quot; I ' d Do It Again. &quot; Curley defined himself as a &quot; friend to the little man. &quot; I guess he figured most little men would forgive anything -- even corruption -- as long as they got theirs . Other politicians choose to work_through their indictments -- the way great athletes play through pain . So it was with Rep . Daniel J . Flood . Few people today remember Flood , and that ' s a shame . In his time , he was almost as powerful as Rostenkowski . Flood was known as &quot; Dapper Dan &quot; -- a sartorial dandy with a waxed mustache , who represented a blue-collar district in rural Pennsylvania . During the 1960s and ' 70s , Flood chaired the House appropriations subcommittee , which controlled billions of dollars in anti-poverty funds . That meant roads , schools , hospitals , bridges and airports for the folks back home . Widows and orphans , his obituary said , hailed Flood as their hero . Flood spent roughly the last 10 years of his career fending off various charges of corruption , which no one in his home district seemed evenly remotely concerned with . The feds finally indicted him on bribery charges , but one of 12 jurors dissented and the case ended in a mistrial . Prosecutors made_noises about jury tampering , but they couldn ' t prove a thing . Flood must have had a good lawyer to beat that rap . The same can ' t be said about Rostenkowski , who ' s apparently fired his famous , high-profile lawyer , Robert S . Bennett . It seems indicted politicians and their lawyers rarely get_along -- one is usually accusing the other of screwing_up the case . A few years back , we had a Democratic political operative here by the name of Howard Medley . He was a self-made millionaire who came_to Chicago from some small_town in Arkansas and became a consummate back-room wheeler-dealer . One day , he showed me his little black_book containing the home and work phone_numbers of every major politician in town . &quot; I ' m Medley , &quot; he told me . &quot; And Medley ' s the man. &quot; Poor Medley ; he got caught_up in some sleazy bribery scheme . His lawyer ' s strategy was to cast Medley as the unschooled country hick taken_in by city_slickers . Medly wanted none of that . He didn ' t want to admit that there was a man alive smart enough to fool Medley . He replaced the first lawyer with a more pliable chap , wound_up losing his case and serving time . To this day , Medley probably curses both those lawyers . In that regard , he ' s probably a lot like John Gotti , head of New York ' s notorious Gambino crime family , who , it seems , never has a good_word to say about any of his lawyers . He ' s called them &quot; rats &quot; and &quot; imbeciles &quot; and even threatened to throw one out a window . Through it all , they remained loyal . One of them , Michael Coiro , even went_to jail for helping conceal the profits from a heroin deal hatched by a Gambino mobster . After his conviction , while awaiting sentencing , Coiro met with Gotti at the infamous Ravenite Social Club , the gang ' s favorite gathering place , where hidden FBI bugs taped their conversation . &quot; I think ( the judge ' s ) gonna give you 10 years , &quot; Gotti said . &quot; Maybe look_for you to do three or four. &quot; &quot; I ' ll do_it , John. &quot; Coiro replied . Now that ' s loyalty . Can you imagine Bennett serving time for Rostenkowski ? Fat chance . According to the papers , he wanted Rostenkowski to plead guilty to lesser corruption charges , give_up his seat and spend a_few months in jail . You call that a deal ? If I were a lawyer , I ' d be ashamed to bill my client . I say Rostenkowski should hire one of those down-and-dirty lawyers who loves a court-room fight . That lawyer should paint the prosecutors as a bunch of snooty Ivy Leaguers who despise Rostenkowski because he ' s coarse and crude and pours ketchup on his steak . And he should call Sophie to the stand , so she can testify about all_the wonderful things Rostenkowski has done for her and all_the little people of Chicago ' s near northwest side . There would n ' t be a dry eye in the jury . After the acquittal , I ' m sure the lawyer would get invited to join Rostenkowski and his cronies for a celebratory meal . They ' d probably buy him a huge hunk of meat -- with a little ketchup on the side. *</TEXT>
