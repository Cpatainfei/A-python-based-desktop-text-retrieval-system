   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : GENDER POLITICS NEEDS A NAME BEFORE IT GETS , WELL , BORING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Good_morning , and welcome to &quot; Name That Phenomenon , &quot; the column that offers you a unique opportunity to bestow a title on whatever the hell it is that ' s going_on between men and women these days . Today , we look_to the glossier side of the news business -- three national magazines -- for clues_in this mess that used to be called the War Between the Sexes . The Zeitgeist mongers are at it again , and it ' s going_to be a thrilling ride down the rails of gender politics as we ( all together now ) name that phenomenon ! You well-dressed gents -- oh , and ladies , or rather womyn , or whatever -- may already be familiar_with the February GQ ' s &quot; The Way We Are &quot; by Lucy Kaylin . Perhaps you have already slogged past the pages featuring moody dudes in wrinkled duds to get_to this essay , in which the writer christens the current of antipathy coursing between men and women . &quot; These days , the mood between men and women is growing far less libidinous than litigious , &quot; Kaylin writes , &quot; what with the once-collegial workplace becoming a hotbed of abuses and almost as_many categories of rape , suddenly , as Eskimo words for snow . . . . &quot; As more men stay home and women go_to work , we ' re finally learning how the other half_lives and that no one has had it easy -- that we ' ve all been mired in quiet desperation . But the quiet part is finally over. &quot; And what do we call this noisy replacement ? &quot; Call it the New Hostility. &quot; Think on it , readers . Our second entry in Name That Phenomenon comes from Esquire ' s February edition : &quot; The 21st-Century Fox. &quot; This issue is not devoted to a movie studio , if you catch our drift . In fact , we can ' t really delve into a whole_lot of what writer Tad Friend addresses , because our censors -- make that taste mavens -- won ' t allow it . Suffice to say the essay in_question is titled &quot; Yes. &quot; As in , &quot; that ' s the message from a new generation of women thinkers , who are embracing sex ( and men ! ) &quot; &quot; For years , radical feminists such_as Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin have held_sway , declaring sex bad and men worse , but now comes a generation of young_women who have read the theory , thought_about it -- and rejected it . That purposeful hammering spreading across the land , bedroom by bedroom , is the sound of those young_women beating their swords into bustiers. &quot; Picking examples from a not-so-broad , as it were , spectrum , Friend lumps together several young , pro-sex women , such_as writers Naomi ( &quot; I love nubile young soccer players &quot; ) Wolf and Katie ( &quot; No such thing as date_rape &quot; ) Roiphe , and proclaims a new political_movement emphasizing &quot; sexual liberation , sexual equality and the reclamation of men from the scrap heap of theory. &quot; And can you name that movement , Mr. Friend ? &quot; Call it , ' do me ' feminism. &quot; we ' ll know soon enough . Our third entry is the most recently published , and appears in this week ' s issue of Time . In an essay more remarkable for its amiable wit than logic ( if you permit us the small indulgence of saying what we think ) , writer Lance Morrow whines and cajoles and explores &quot; the proposition that . . . men . . . are swine. &quot; As if to preempt discussion , Time ' s cover features a clearly Caucasian pig head ( white head , pink nose -- looks a little like the late Tip O ' Neill , actually ) sprouting from a human male_body . ( Note to Time subscribers : The magazine assures us that the cover subject is no one ' s ex-boyfriend , as it is a composite photograph. ) &quot; Men should think more about their situation and their behavior , &quot; Morrow writes . &quot; Women should as well . Both men and women have been oppressed by the other sex , in different ways . And both have been getting_away with murder. &quot; Thus Morrow wonders : &quot; Are we really as awful as they say we are ? &quot; His replacement for &quot; The War Between the Sexes &quot; ? &quot; The War Against Men. &quot; * So . What ' ll it be , readers ? Ready to name that phenomenon ? Those partial to &quot; The New Hostility , &quot; please raise your hands . &quot; Do-Me Feminism ? &quot; What about &quot; The War Against Men ? &quot; Hmmm , that ' s odd . No one seems to be voting . This is absolutely unprecedented . Readers , please . Signify that you are ready to vote by raising your hands now ! Unbelievable . No one is responding . Perhaps a different question is in_order . A show of hands , please , from those too busy trying to keep marriage , children , relationships and / or career intact to care that A ) relations between the sexes are just as muddled as ever ; B ) a_few feminists are talking dirty and getting publicity for it , and C ) some affluent white_men are complaining that men are as oppressed as women . We thought so . It ' s unanimous .</TEXT>
