   <HEADLINE> ALLIES EXULT AS BOSNIAN SERBS SURRENDER ARMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Frequently over the past months , senior officials at NATO headquarters here have privately exhibited growing frustration at the failure of the United Nations to defend the weapons exclusion zones it declared in Bosnia-Herzegovina . Saturday , that frustration had vanished . Within hours of NATO ' s air strike Friday against Bosnian Serb weaponry operating in the U.N.-declared exclusion zone around the capital , Sarajevo , a Bosnian Serb political_leader promised to give_back heavy_weapons his forces had stolen from a U.N. depot . Then the rebels actually returned them . By late Saturday , the U.N. Protection Force reported that Bosnian Serb forces had handed back a Soviet-built T-55 tank , two armored personnel_carriers and a Praga antiaircraft_gun stolen early the previous day from a Sarajevo containment yard being guarded by a U.N. peacekeeping unit from Ukraine . A fifth weapon , an antiaircraft_gun taken_in a separate raid on a U.N. site , was also returned for U.N. safekeeping , mission spokesman Maj . Rob Annink told reporters in Sarajevo . While deep concern persists over widespread truce violations and the Balkan war ' s potential to spread , the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization air strike requested Friday by the U.N. Protection Force appeared to put Bosnian Serb belligerents on notice that the international community will not tolerate a resumption of the siege of Sarajevo . Even the rebels ' longtime patron , Serbia , has apparently taken a hard line with the insurgents . Rump Yugoslavia , made_up of Serbia and Montenegro , severed all political and economic ties with the Bosnian Serbs on Thursday and closed its border to commercial traffic . On Saturday , Serbian border police turned_back hundreds of trucks , many carrying food , trying to cross into Bosnian Serb territory , Reuters news service reported . To be sure , the allies ' showdown was an isolated victory over the Bosnian Serbs , who continue their flagrant violations of the exclusion zones and already possess a colossal predominance in arms over the Muslim-led government forces . At least six mortar rounds have been fired by the rebels into Sarajevo civilian neighborhoods over the past week -- an ominous reminder of how easily the siege that terrorized the capital for 22 months could be restarted . Sniper fire from Bosnian Serb positions just across the Miljacka River in central Sarajevo has so intensified since the rebels spurned an international peace proposal July 19 that at least a dozen people have been killed or wounded and service on the city ' s tram network , which was restored in March to the cheers and tears of long-deprived Sarajevans , has been suspended more often than not . But U.N. peacekeeping officials in Bosnia seemed eager to take_advantage of the boost in credibility that Friday ' s symbolic air strike provided . The commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , warned the rebels that they could face further air_attacks unless they surrender dozens of other heavy_weapons they are known to have in violation of the Sarajevo exclusion zone . Mission officers also are working_on plans for a house-to-house search for snipers in Sarajevo to wipe_out the greatest and most persistent menace to civilians , a U.N. source at mission headquarters in Zagreb , Croatia , reported . The focus_on keeping what has been a relative peace in the Bosnian capital for the past five months appeared to demonstrate NATO and U.N. resolve to provide genuine protection to at least the most visible of Bosnia ' s six U.N.-designated havens . Friday ' s air strike , which destroyed an antitank gun of little military value , was considered more important for the line it drew after a period of several months in which international resolve to enforce the exclusion zone around Sarajevo had been clearly flagging . &quot; We wanted to send a message , &quot; said the U.N. Protection Force commander , French Gen . Bertrand de Lapresle , suggesting that the rebels must now reckon with similar sanctions if they persist with violations . But the NATO action , which U.N. officials took pains to describe as &quot; a proportionate response &quot; to the Bosnian Serb weapons heists , stirred some fears in Zagreb and Sarajevo that the international community has simply upped the ante for enforcing its own resolutions . There is now little the U.N. mission can do to force the withdrawal of other heavy_weapons violating the exclusion zones , short of bombing some of the more strategic positions to show the rebels that the allies mean business . Violations are even more blatant at the weapons exclusion zone proclaimed by NATO around the embattled eastern enclave of Gorazde , another U.N.-designated &quot; safe area &quot; that the Bosnian Serbs have been attacking with impunity . Friday ' s air action , initiated by Rose , marked one of the few times during the 28-month Serbian rebellion in Bosnia that the U.N. mission and NATO combined to actually follow_through on one of the international community ' s many verbal threats to take action if the rebels continued to ignore their demands . &quot; The system is not perfect , but something had to be done_in the face of such a flagrant violation , &quot; Rose said Saturday . The easing of the siege of Sarajevo was largely a result of NATO ' s threat to bomb heavy_weapons left within striking range of the capital after the withdrawal deadline of Feb . 21 . But Rose has taken personal pride in his association with what was likely the most significant accomplishment of the entire U.N. mission in the Balkans . NATO officials here , pleased both at the chance to defend the exclusion zone and at the strike ' s success , saw the chain of events as a positive development that , in the words of one senior official , &quot; sent the right signal and triggered the proper response. &quot; &quot; I don ' t know if it makes us look good , but it certainly reinforces our credibility , &quot; this official said . &quot; I had my personal doubts that they ' d ask_for air strikes , but they did and they went according to plan . If there are going_to be weapons exclusion zones , they should be enforced. &quot; John Jeffrey , a spokesman at NATO ' s Southern European Command headquarters in Naples , Italy , reported that the skies over Bosnia were_quiet Saturday . &quot; We are flying what we consider to be the appropriate number of missions ( over Bosnia-Herzegovina ) , and there have been no incidents , &quot; he said . Western diplomats based in the Balkans , however , were more skeptical of the sincerity of the rebels ' purported contrition . They pointed to a pattern of escalating Bosnian Serb provocations throughout the course of the war that have pushed a reluctant international community into firmer and more frequent applications of force . &quot; It is safe to say they will continue probing the limits of the West ' s willingness to use air_power , &quot; one diplomat said . &quot; It is less easy to predict how far the allies are prepared to go_in using it. &quot; Marshall reported from Brussels and Williams from Zagreb , Croatia .</TEXT>
