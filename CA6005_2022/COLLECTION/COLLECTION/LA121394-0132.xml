   <HEADLINE> THE MEDIA ; CO-OP ' S VIDEO PHOTOGRAPHERS SHOOT THE WORLD ON A SHOESTRING ; WITHOUT RESOURCES OF MAJOR TV NEWS ORGANIZATIONS , GETTING FOOTAGE FROM HOT SPOTS LIKE BOSNIA IS RISKY BUSINESS FOR FRONTLINE ' S FREE-LANCERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two weeks ago , Vaughan Smith was working as a free-lance television cameraman in Sarajevo when a stray bullet whipped_through the billowing sleeve of his T-shirt . Smith shrugged_off the episode as one of the perils of his business , recalling : &quot; The shot came_through the window of my Bosnian fiance ' s family home_in Sarajevo . We all hit_the_deck . And the family was embarrassed that it happened in their home. &quot; Smith ' s business is a new company of free-lance TV cameramen and camerawomen who pursue front-line footage they sell to television networks worldwide . The enterprise is appropriately named Frontline News Television and is a cooperative of combat-tested TV photographers . &quot; We have about 20 cameramen in our group , &quot; said Smith , taking a break from the Bosnia-Herzegovina story to return to London and his company ' s basement office near Victoria Station . He is co-director of the cooperative and owns 51 % of its stock , taking no salary but sharing_in the commissions earned by Frontline ' s camera operators in the field . Frontline News is &quot; a very lean organization , &quot; Smith said , pointing_out that &quot; we have to do things on the cheap since each cameraman -- or camerawoman , we have three -- pays his or her own expenses . . . . They are not staying in five-star hotels. &quot; They also pay_for their own insurance . &quot; Our people are independent souls , &quot; Smith continued . &quot; They pursue the stories they want to -- in Bosnia , Afghanistan , Somalia , Rwanda , Central Asia , wherever . But we try to keep the focus_on stories that we can sell . &quot; We work_on the cheap -- small , home video , HI-8 cameras instead of the expensive Betacams. &quot; Rather than staying in hotels in Sarajevo , for instance , Frontline personnel might stay_at a private home for bed and breakfast . Frontline ' s TV journalists cannot afford the high cost of armored cars in places like the former Yugoslav federation , as American or British network teams can , and therefore often work_at greater risk . A correspondent for one of the American networks commented : &quot; We sometimes buy from them because it ' s cheaper and everyone is cost-conscious these days . Also they are good for getting back-stop news footage in difficult places. &quot; The company had its genesis in the aftermath of the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War , during which Smith obtained through subterfuge some of the only combat film of the American forces advancing into Iraq with tank guns blazing . A former captain in the elite British Grenadier Guards regiment , Smith , now 31 , left the army and eventually wound_up in Pakistan selling micro-light aircraft . There , he linked up with free-lance television_camera crews moving_in and out of Afghanistan . He volunteered first as a sound technician , later as a photographer and caught_on with a group accompanying John Simpson , foreign affairs editor and roving correspondent of the_British Broadcasting Corp . Smith later covered the Gulf War . Using his ex-army credentials and donning a British officer ' s uniform , he managed to bum rides with a forward American unit and rode into battle with it . &quot; I avoided censorship by getting_back to Dhahran ( Saudi_Arabia ) and then to Bahrain , then flying back to Europe with my stuff , &quot; he said . The BBC ' s Simpson recalls that Smith &quot; obtained the best and most spectacular television pictures of the ground fighting. &quot; With the profit from his exclusive film , which was used by networks around the world , Smith set_up Frontline News TV , among whose founding members were highly regarded free-lance cameramen Nick della Casa and Tim Weaver . But Smith , while skilled in the field , was still an amateur in marketing the film , and he cycled around London delivering the cooperative ' s footage to TV offices for possible use . The first year for Frontline News was difficult , with only about $ 75 # 000 worth of business , which did not turn a profit . Near the end of 1991 , Anna Roberts , a journalist and TV producer , joined the group to sell the footage and developed a list of about 70 customers , mainly TV networks . Two other women , Susannah Nicol , now co-director with Smith , and Jane Birch , joined the group to run the office and organize sales and contracts , boosting business this year to about $ 650 # 000 -- and well in the black . The cooperative ' s office markets the product of the field TV photographers and takes between 20 % and 25 % commission on sales , which constitutes its profit . As with all combat journalists , the work remains dangerous : Founding member Della Casa was slain by a Turkish guide in the Kurdish mountains of Iraq in the rebellion that followed the Gulf War . Rory Peck , another Frontline cameraman known for his Gulf War shots of an air-raid_shelter in Baghdad hit by an American missile , left the cooperative to work_on his own in Moscow -- and was killed during the firefight when Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin withstood the challenge of the Russian Parliament in 1993 . Smith , who has temporarily based himself in the port city of Split on the Dalmatian coast of Croatia , wants to offer customers a variety of material from his field photographers . &quot; We are always on the lookout for big , breaking news_stories , when we tend to offer our pictures to networks right on the spot -- particularly if they have satellite facilities , as in Sarajevo , &quot; Smith said . But he added that the Frontline journalists also package features . &quot; We want to produce the kind of features that hit_home , that appeal_to editors and audiences . A really good piece can be sold in many different countries ' markets . &quot; For instance , we put_together the piece on the corruption among United Nations forces in Bosnia : Ukrainians selling fuel , the_French involved with prostitution . That was a fine exclusive that others picked_up on . &quot; We ' re good at wars , but we ' re moving into other areas , &quot; he said . &quot; We also put a man aboard the trans-Siberian express to film Chinese passengers selling their goods to Russians along the way -- fake name-brand running_shoes , things like that . It made a very watchable feature . . . . For an American network , with their large crews , to do such a trip would have cost too_much for them to take_a_chance on a story. &quot; Often , Frontline News sells film on the spot at a rate of $ 1 # 000 a minute . &quot; If we get a_couple_of minutes , we might make expenses , &quot; Smith said . &quot; But if they really want something , it will run longer , and we will do much better. &quot; With the feature stories that take more time , the television package is put_together by editors in London . The cooperative , with its 20 journalists , operates largely like an individual free-lancer . &quot; Ideally , we ' d like to get contracts and commissions with networks that would guarantee us fees if we produce . . . . And we ' ll go absolutely anywhere we think we can get something to sell. &quot;</TEXT>
