   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : QUARTERFINALS ; SPOTLIGHT ; SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE IN ' 90</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How consuming is soccer in countries where it is king ? Because of the time difference , Italy ' s games have been played_at awkward hours for Italian fans.Two started in prime_time in Rome at 10 p.m. , and the other three , including Saturday ' s quarterfinal against Spain , in early evening when shops are open . Yet in a country of 57 million , each of Italy ' s first four games -- against Ireland , Norway , Mexico and Nigeria -- drew a television audience of between 22.5 million and 25 million viewers . That represents as_many as 85 % of TV_sets in the country turned_on during the games . Impressive , but five prime-time Italian appearances in the Italia 90 Cup drew bigger audiences . The most-watched game in Italian history came that year in the penalty-kick loss to Argentina , which attracted nearly 30 million viewers and 87 % of people watching television . WILLIAM D .
