   <HEADLINE> SPREADING LABOR SHORTAGES SEEN AS SIGNAL OF INFLATION ; ECONOMY : BUSTLING INDIANA COUNTY IS TYPICAL OF MANY AREAS . FED MAY REACT AS MATERIAL COSTS , WAGES HEAD UPWARD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you want to know why the nation ' s central_bank is worried about inflation , just take a short jaunt around this bustling manufacturing center . Take a peek in the unemployment office . The lobby , where jobless applicants come_to collect unemployment checks , is_quiet as a morgue . A bulletin_board lists scores of job openings in local factories , shops and offices . Stop by Coachmen Industries and watch a steady stream of hulking recreational_vehicles roll_off the assembly_line . The company is straining to fill RV and trailer orders from dealers . Drive further down Highway 13 past corn fields in the rolling Amish countryside , where scores of small manufacturing_plants are adorned with &quot; Help Wanted &quot; or &quot; Now Hiring &quot; signs . Throughout Elkhart County , 20 miles east of South Bend and abutting the Michigan border , there is a severe labor shortage . The unemployment_rate is 3.6 % , considered full_employment by many economists . The nation ' s jobless rate is 6.3 % . &quot; In this area , anybody who wants to work is working , &quot; said Dennis Richey , general_manager of Patriot Homes , a builder of mobile and modular homes . &quot; We simply can ' t get enough good help. &quot; Such labor shortages are beginning to appear throughout the Midwest and South . The Federal_Reserve ' s latest regional report on the nation ' s economy found spot job shortages in the Chicago , St . Louis and Atlanta districts . &quot; It ' s moving beyond just spot shortages , &quot; said David Allardice , economist for the Federal_Reserve_Bank in Chicago . &quot; It ' s pretty widespread. &quot; What worries some economists is that labor shortages can be a precursor of inflation . With many factories running near capacity , pressures are building to increase wages even as productivity is dropping . Prices of key materials such_as steel and rubber are up . This means higher production_costs , which ultimately could push_up prices for consumers . &quot; This is exactly what the Fed is worried about , &quot; said Diane Swonk , regional economist for First Chicago Corp . The fear that the Fed might raise interest_rates for the sixth time this year has spooked the stock and bond markets . Many traders expect the Fed to raise short-term interest_rates again soon , perhaps as early as Tuesday when its policy-making board meets . As Californians and others are painfully aware , labor shortages are hardly universal . The East and West coasts are still just recovering from the last recession . California continues to take severe blows from the shrinkage of defense and aerospace , and major layoffs continue nationwide as corporations downsize to become more efficient . Even the Midwest , which is abuzz with manufacturing activity , has urban_centers with stubbornly high unemployment_rates . Moreover , much of the job demand is for low-wage , low-skilled workers , not for laid-off aerospace_engineers . There is little incentive for unemployed people to move hundreds of miles for such jobs , which are likely to be wiped_out in the next downturn . Nowhere is the labor shortage more critical than in Elkhart County , home to about 156 # 000 people and a center of the recreational_vehicle , manufactured housing and van conversion industries . The area ' s economy -- sensitive to swings in interest_rates and consumer confidence -- is considered a bellwether of the national economy . And local economists say Elkhart ' s growth will continue into 1995 , with a 3 % increase in jobs expected . But where those workers will come from is anyone ' s guess . The lack of labor is so severe that last month , the Greater Elkhart Chamber_of_Commerce went looking_for workers , placing help-wanted ads in newspapers in 12 cities nationwide with double-digit unemployment . The ads invited those interested to call a toll-free telephone_number for more information . &quot; Our telephone_lines lit_up like a Christmas_tree , &quot; chamber President David Germain said . The business group sent about 1 # 500 packets of information and said a handful of workers have already been hired . Germain said the goal is to place about 500 workers in area companies this year . Coachmen ' s recreational_vehicle division , located in the Amish village of Middlebury , could use another 100 employees to help turn_out more motor_homes , trailers and campers . That would increase its 1 # 300-member work_force by 8 % . &quot; More people would give us the flexibility to work split_shifts or add more shifts , &quot; said Michael Terlep , executive_vice_president . &quot; We could expand production or add new facilities. &quot; Instead , with the company ' s plants operating at full capacity and employees putting_in 10- to 12-hour days and working Saturdays , Coachmen officials fear that they will begin losing orders to its competitors , such_as Fleetwood Enterprises in California or Winnebago Industries in Iowa . Some Elkhart firms have already lost business . Indiana Wood Products , which makes wooden pallets and boxes , recently had to return order deposits to several customers because the company lacked the labor to do the jobs . &quot; For the first time in our history , we had to turn_away business , &quot; General_Manager Lamar Lantz said . &quot; It cost us about $ 250 # 000. &quot; Businesses like Indiana Wood are particularly vulnerable because they use unskilled workers and pay them just above minimum_wage . With labor in short supply , higher-paying manufacturing companies are luring away the best of these workers , hoping to train them for semi-skilled jobs . The shortage has prompted companies to be creative in their hiring . Some are offering signing bonuses ; some pay finder ' s fees to employees who bring_in recruits who are hired . A few companies have quietly dropped standards , such_as requiring pre-employment drug screenings . Still others are reviewing their pay scales , increasing wages or providing incentive bonuses tied to productivity and quality . Some companies are providing transportation to workers without cars . Middlebury Hardwood Products , which makes cabinets for RVs and mobile_homes , is raising its starting wage and bought a bus to transport workers from nearby towns . It added a second shift and needs 20 more workers to run it . &quot; It ' s been panic time , &quot; said Lee Martin , the company ' s chief financial_officer . &quot; The customers are going nuts . If they have a unit done without doors , it ' s no good to them. &quot; It is not just the manufacturing sector that is hurting . Hardee ' s , a fast-food restaurant , offers a $ 100 signing bonus for new employees who stay_on the job for 100 days . Das Dutchman Essenhaus , an Amish-style tourist stop near Middlebury , has sent 9 # 000 circulars through a six-county area seeking workers . It has developed an incentive bonus plan for longtime workers and signing bonuses for short-term help . The operation , which employs 350 at its gift_shop , hotel and a restaurant that can serve 6 # 000 meals a day , has seen its labor costs rise 3 % in the last_quarter alone . &quot; Our labor costs are up not only because we are paying more , but our training costs are up because the turnover is higher , &quot; Essenhaus owner Bob Miller said . But the wage pressures have been greatest for manufacturers , particularly in the RV and automotive supply businesses , where the average hourly pay is $ 14 an hour . Workplace raids and bidding over prized employees is commonplace . &quot; We have lost some of our better employees to the competition , &quot; said Harry Tallman , vice_president of human resources for Starcraft Automotive Co. , a van conversion firm based in Goshen . &quot; There have been wage wars. &quot; The labor shortage prompted Starcraft to begin a review of its wage and benefit plans with an eye toward becoming more competitive . But instead of raising hourly wages , the company is likely to offer bonuses tied to productivity and quality . &quot; We don ' t want to bid up our wages , &quot; Tallman said . &quot; It ' s dangerous to do so in a cyclical industry. &quot; One result of the shortage has been the hiring of unskilled or unmotivated workers , said Richey of Patriot Homes : &quot; We have some people I would replace in a heartbeat if I could. &quot; Others complain of workers jumping from job to job . But in an industry that tends to suffer peaks and valleys , it is not surprising that workers will jump at the best offer . The RV industry is known for periodic layoffs and for having poor long-term benefit plans . Morton Marcus , economics professor at Indiana University in Bloomington , argues that the situation in Elkhart highlights the failure of U.S. companies to provide workers with the training and financial incentives to increase productivity . What is happening in Elkhart takes_on added importance because the community ' s economy tends to foreshadow where the national economy will be in three or four months . John Peck , economics professor at Indiana University in South Bend , said Elkhart tends to be ahead of the curve entering and leaving recessions because the RV industry -- accounting_for 20 % of Elkhart ' s jobs -- is very sensitive to swings in interest_rates and consumer confidence . &quot; The RV industry serves as a good leading economic indicator , &quot; he said . What Elkhart ' s story says to some economists is that inflation is a real concern . Fred Herschede , economics professor at Indiana University in South Bend , said there are numerous signs of inflation , including labor shortages , falling productivity , higher unit labor costs and increasing demand . Without Fed intervention , he projects inflation hitting 4 % next year . Such pressures are especially evident in the auto industry , which is running its factories at near capacity . Every one of Ford Motor Co. ' s U.S. plants , for example , operated_on overtime this week . The strained capacity is leading to lower productivity because the efficiency gains of recent years are now being offset by higher labor costs , training costs and lower_quality caused by long work_days . &quot; Even though wage gains may be modest , if you couple that with the drop_in productivity , you will get an increase in unit labor costs that will build price pressures , &quot; Herschede said . Meanwhile , export demand is likely to grow as the European and Japanese economies recover . And raw_material prices , notably steel , have been rising . Back in Elkhart , companies continue to scramble to fill orders and hire workers . They worry about what the Fed may do , concerned that too strong a move will slow growth too_much and ultimately bring_on recession . &quot; When things are good in Elkhart , they are very very good , &quot; said Tallman of Starcraft . &quot; When they are bad , they are very , very bad. &quot;</TEXT>
