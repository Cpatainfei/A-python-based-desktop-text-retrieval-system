   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; HEALING BRAZIL ; INFLATION , POVERTY AND CHAOS CONFRONT THE NATION ' S NEXT LEADER . BUT TWO MEN ARE EAGER FOR THE JOB .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In giant Brazil , problems come big . Latin_America ' s largest country suffers the longest-running streak of super-inflation ever known , a decade of annual percentage increases in the hundred- and thousand-fold . In the past 18 months , a president has been toppled and a congressional &quot; budget mafia &quot; has been exposed in back-to-back scandals revealing corruption to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars . Social problems are overwhelming . An estimated 32 million of Brazil ' s 155 million people have incomes so small that they cannot afford proper nourishment . Public education and health systems are in shambles . &quot; Brazil is in a state of abandon , &quot; said economist Salomao Quadros da Silva of the Getulio Vargas Foundation here . &quot; The government is incapacitated. &quot; Twenty-seven million Brazilians live_in two overcrowded and violent metropolitan areas -- Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro -- where powerful criminal gangs steal and kill almost at will and rogue cops are equally dangerous . Despair is pervasive and deep . Joao Ubaldo Ribeiro , one of Brazil ' s leading novelists , wrote recently that the country seems to have become &quot; a Babel that is more and more out of control , where no one is sure of anything , where no one trusts anything and the norms that should regulate our lives change constantly. &quot; But in 1994 , Brazil has an opportunity to try to reverse its fortunes . This is an election year , and Brazilians are looking_for a president who can lead them out of the morass . They could also throw the rascals out of Congress . As the campaign gets under way , the current government is pressing forward with an economic stabilization plan designed to curb inflation now rocketing in the range of 45 % a month , or more_than 8 # 000 % a year . Meanwhile , non-governmental groups are mobilizing to tackle social problems . So , amid the gloom , there are glimmerings of hope , however tentative . This could turn_out to be a year of potentially momentous change , Brazilian political and economic analysts say . &quot; Or disaster , &quot; said one . &quot; You never know which way Brazil is going_to go. &quot; * Go_back to the early 1970s for a glance at Brazil in its &quot; miracle &quot; era . The economy was booming ; there was &quot; order and progress , &quot; as prescribed by the motto on the national_flag . The country ' s can-do optimism knew no bounds . The Brazilian economy became the 10th largest in the world . Today , despite its economic ills , Brazil manufactures more_than 1.3 million motor_vehicles a year , exports turboprop airliners and is_well on its way to launching rockets that can put its own satellites in orbit . Brazil ' s big ambitions were and still are backed by a solid industrial base , the world ' s fifth-largest population and the rich resources of a territory bigger than the United States without Alaska . But somehow , greatness has eluded the country . Go_back to 1985 for a glance at Brazil as it returned to civilian government after 21 years of military rule . The military regime had fizzled_out amid a debt crisis , growing inflation and political unrest . No one any longer believed_in &quot; miracles &quot; of development . Democracy , however , shone with promise . Many Brazilians hoped it could solve the country ' s problems . In the nine years since , under three civilian presidents , that hope has flickered on and off , colored by progressively deeper pessimism . In different ways , civilian Presidents Jose Sarney , Fernando Collor de Mello and Itamar Franco ( whose term ends at the beginning of 1995 ) all have delivered bitter disappointment . Who can fix Brazil ? As the country casts_about for an answer , two names stand_out : Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and Fernando Henrique Cardoso . Lula is a former metalworker and union leader who has no formal education beyond the sixth grade . A moderate socialist , he leads the labor-based Workers ' Party , which includes an important faction of doctrinaire Marxists . As the runner-up candidate in 1989 runoff elections , Lula won 31 million votes to Collor ' s 35 million . Lately , Lula has been trying to broaden his political base . He and other party moderates seek to reassure business people and military_officers that their plans include nothing like the late Chilean President Salvador Allende ' s ill-fated drive toward socialism in the early 1970s . And although Brazil ' s military leadership is conservative , many officers share Lula ' s nationalist tendencies and his fondness for state enterprises . &quot; Lula already has the simpatia -- or at least the tolerance -- of important sectors of the armed forces , &quot; said the magazine Istoe . Cardoso is a former sociology professor who has found a second vocation in politics as a founder and leader of the Brazilian Party of Social_Democracy . He was a popular senator until joining President Franco ' s Cabinet -- first as foreign_minister , then as finance_minister . In his 11 months as finance_minister , Cardoso failed to stop the dizzying flight of inflation , which rose from about 30 % to nearly 45 % a month on his watch . But he won congressional and public support for a plan that economists say has a chance of stabilizing prices , at least temporarily , before the first round of elections Oct . 3 . Analysts say Lula may soon be running scared . At any rate , the 30 % preference rate that he was getting before Cardoso announced should not be interpreted as putting the Workers ' Party on the threshold of presidential power . It could mean that 70 % think someone other_than Lula should be president . Many of those who see Lula as the candidate to beat may also see Cardoso as the one to do_it . Cardoso has the potential to dominate the center and right of the political spectrum , leaving Lula isolated on the left . * That clearly is Cardoso ' s intention . He asked rhetorically the other day whether the Workers ' Party platform was aimed at making Brazil &quot; a big Nicaragua ? A Cuba ? &quot; Lula , fighting to expand his share of the spectrum , accused Cardoso of furthering conservative market policies that are turning Brazil into &quot; an Ethiopia or a Somalia. &quot; If the economic stabilization plan Cardoso left in place as finance_minister succeeds in curtailing inflation before the elections , he may get a bonanza of credit at the polls . But the plan is not foolproof . It includes a very complex and difficult switch from Brazil ' s inflationary currency to a new one . Economist Paulo Robelo de Castro says the switch will be &quot; like changing the turbine of a Boeing while it ' s flying. &quot; If the plan doesn ' t work , whoever is elected Brazil ' s next president will be back to square one on inflation . Economist De Castro warned that if the future president-elect does not inspire the confidence of Brazilians , especially the business_sector , Brazil could face hyper-inflation , a chaotic condition in which prices soar completely out of control and money becomes virtually useless . Former President Sarney ' s term ended in March , 1990 , with inflation exploding at a rate of 80 % a month , close to hyper-inflation . Former President Collor temporarily controlled inflation with a radical stabilization plan , but prices were shooting_up again when Congress impeached and suspended him on corruption charges in 1992 . Franco , who has been criticized widely as an indecisive and ineffectual leader since he replaced Collor , has had no success against inflation so far . As corruption scandals and inflation battered the country during the latter months of 1993 , the press fluttered with rumors that Franco would resign or that a coup was coming . In November , Franco told the Jornal do Brasil that he had received about 20 letters from the public asking him to shut_down the Congress . But he said his democratic principles barred him from a &quot; Fujimorization &quot; -- a reference_to the 1992 shutdown of the Peruvian Congress by President Alberto Fujimori . * The armed forces are in a negative mood , not only because of corruption scandals and economic_crisis but also because they consider their own salaries to be insultingly low . But political analysts say no significant segment of Brazil ' s army or body_politic wants a coup . &quot; There is no danger of Fujimorization in Brazil , &quot; Gen . Zenildo Lucena , Franco ' s army minister , remarked recently . Still , military_leaders have not hidden their concern over the latest corruption scandal in Congress . In January , a special congressional committee recommended that 17 members of the lower chamber and one senator be expelled for participating in a network that manipulated federal budget funds in exchange for bribes and kickbacks . Four of the accused congressmen have resigned , and the rest are to be tried in Congress starting this month . Few Brazilians believe that the 18 on the carpet are the only corrupt members of Congress . And the scandal is only the latest of a series . Another focuses_on corrupt practices in the social_security system . Crooked officials and judges have siphoned_off an estimated $ 1.5 billion a year in fraudulent pensions and other payments , according to an official investigation . Even soccer , the national sport , is not sacred . In this World Cup year when the Brazilians are expected to contend for the championship in Southern California , the game has been tainted . Referees have accused the president of Rio ' s soccer federation of asking them to fix results . Widespread as it is , the problem of corruption is not as painful for most Brazilians as inflation , which saps the purchasing power of the country ' s hard-pressed masses . Last year it reached a rate of 2 # 567 % . Every few years , Brazil has to knock three zeros off its currency to keep calculators from going haywire with all_the digits . Economist De Castro asked a young colleague to calculate compounded inflation since 1970 , and the computer yielded a figure with 14 digits : 27 trillion percent . Brazil ' s corruption and inflation problems have political roots , and the political problems go_deep into the country ' s historical subsoil . Brazil was the last Western country to abolish slavery -- in 1888 -- and the legacy from that relatively recent scourge has strongly and negatively influenced the country ' s economic and social development during the 20th Century . &quot; We waited until the last minute and then we just freed the slaves and told them they were free to survive on_their_own with no education , no resources , no nothing , &quot; said political_scientist Amaury de Souza . * The society remains deeply divided . The dominant elite has give little thought or resources to improving health , education or criminal justice for the poor . Said De Souza : &quot; We still have the mentality of slave owners. &quot; A recent study by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics , a government_agency , drew a tragic map of Brazil ' s misery . It said the average monthly salary is $ 264 . Nearly one-fifth of all workers earn less than the mandatory monthly minimum of $ 64 . On average , black Brazilians earn less than half has much as whites . Contributing to poverty is a public education system that severely limits upward mobility for the uneducated poor . All but 2 % of Brazil ' s pupils repeat at least a year before completing eighth grade . About 66 % drop_out before eighth grade , and 2.6 million children of school age have never enrolled . Crime thrives in ignorance and poverty . Drug-trafficking gangs control most of Rio ' s famous favela slums , often engaging in deadly gun battles for turf or to keep police out . In the worst recent shootout , 12 people were killed in a fight between gangs in the Acari shantytown . Crime breeds more crime , and many of the victims are children and adolescents . The U.S.-based group Human_Rights Watch said in a report this year that 5 # 644 Brazilian children between 5 and 17 years old were slain from 1988 to 1991 . Many of those killed were abandoned children , &quot; street kids , &quot; and many of their killers were police_officers working with death squads . In the past three years , about 200 police_officers have been detained for suspected death squad involvement . Such killings , a brutal reaction to burglary and theft by poor youths , is common in many cities . In early March , an advertising periodical called Hot List in the southern city of Londrina published an ad urging readers to &quot; kill a juvenile delinquent. &quot; The ad was signed &quot; Victimized Merchants. &quot; One saving grace in recent years of government failure is the phenomenal growth of non-governmental organizations that care_for street children , defend the Amazon wilderness , fight AIDS and other diseases , teach literacy and advise poor mothers . At last count , there were more_than 5 # 000 of such groups , double the number of just two years before . An estimated 80 # 000 Brazilians participate in the groups . * Herbert de Souza , a social activist , has received a Nobel Prize nomination for leading a national &quot; Campaign Against Hunger and Misery &quot; to collect money and distribute food to an estimated 32 million Brazilians who cannot afford the nourishment they need . About 3 # 500 citizens committees around the country are participating in the campaign . Historian Jose Murilo de Carvalho , a researcher with the Getulio Vargas Foundation , said Brazil ' s biggest hope for salvation is the gradual perfection of its ill-formed and dysfunctional democratic system , which first opened_up to mass participation only in 1945 . Earlier in the century , only about 5 % of the population voted . So Brazil has had very little time to learn the &quot; ethos of democracy , &quot; a process that took centuries in Europe , he said . &quot; The goal is to gain time , to avoid any breakdown of the institutional rules , to keep learning. &quot; Out of Control Brazilian Price_Index 1980 : 110.3 % 1981 : 95.2 % 1982 : 99.7 % 1983 : 211.0 % 1984 : 223.8 % 1985 : 235.1 % 1986 : 65.0 % 1987 : 415.8 % 1988 : 1 # 037.6 % 1989 : 1 # 782.9 % 1990 : 1 # 476.6 % 1991 : 480.2 % 1992 : 1 # 158.0 % 1993 : 2 # 708.5 % SOURCE : Getulio Vargas Foundation , Rio de Janeiro</TEXT>
