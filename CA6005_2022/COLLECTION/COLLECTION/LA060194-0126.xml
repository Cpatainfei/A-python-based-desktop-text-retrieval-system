   <HEADLINE> THE ECONOMY : HOW STRONG ? ; JOBS-INFLATION LINK BY FED CALLED FLAWED ; POLICY : CRITICS SAY GOVERNMENT , WALL_STREET USE OUTDATED FIGURES TO DETERMINE ' FULL ' EMPLOYMENT THRESHOLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With nearly 14 million Americans out_of_work , marooned in part-time jobs or too disheartened to answer a help-wanted ad , could the United States be approaching &quot; full &quot; employment ? Key Federal_Reserve officials , along with many on Wall_Street , believe that -- as a practical matter -- the answer is yes : that the economy has entered a danger_zone where further jobs growth could set_off an upward spiral of inflation . That belief , which has helped justify four interest_rate hikes this year and may hasten the next one , has sparked a controversy that goes_to the very core of the U.S. economy ' s capabilities in a world of changing technology and global business links . &quot; How would an average person in California respond to the notion that somehow we ' re growing too fast and have to slow the economy down ? &quot; asks Lawrence Mishel , research_director at the Economic Policy Institute , a liberal think_tank . Critics say the Fed is relying_on an outdated world_view that has failed to consider sweeping changes that are likely to keep the lid on inflation as joblessness shrinks further . Moreover , the jobs-versus-prices flap comes at a time when the labor_market , despite significant gains , still has pockets of distress . While the national unemployment_rate in April was pegged at 6.4 % , that is just an average figure . The experience of regions , racial groups and industries differs drastically . In California , almost 1.5 million people are looking_for work , and the unemployment_rate is 9.6 % , according to state data . By contrast , the rate in North Carolina is 3.9 % . Nationally , the rate of unemployment among whites is 5.6 % , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . But the black unemployment_rate is 11.8 % , and the Latino rate is 10.8 % . One in three Americans still believes that jobs are &quot; hard to get , &quot; the Conference Board reported Tuesday , a slight increase from April . Given the disparities of fortune , the question of when to slow the economy through interest_rate hikes takes_on huge personal and political ramifications . &quot; You ' d hate to throw_away 500 # 000 jobs that it might not be necessary to throw_away , &quot; observed Laurence H . Meyer , an economic forecaster in St . Louis . Nonetheless , what Fed officials abhor most is the prospect of inflation , which could unhinge the financial markets and undermine the entire recovery . They have lately become concerned that the economy is running_out of &quot; slack &quot; -- unused factory capacity and available workers . The jobless rate has been_on a downward trend for almost two years , dipping to 6.4 % in April from 6.7 % in January . Factories , meanwhile , have been humming , another sign that the economy continues to push_forward at high speed : Operating rates have churned_up to 83 % , closing_in on the traditional inflation threshold of about 85 % . As the economy runs_out of slack , goes the view , shortages of labor and materials lead to inflation . And inflation erodes the value of bonds . &quot; What ' s important is that the country has removed an awful lot of slack in the economy , &quot; said Robert Parry , president of the Federal_Reserve_Bank of San Francisco , in an interview . Parry doubts that anyone can pinpoint the precise unemployment_rate that triggers inflation , but he suggested it lurks somewhere between 6 % and 6.5 % , and probably &quot; in the higher part of that range. &quot; * Therein lies the dispute . Critics say the Fed is counting too heavily on theories hatched in an entirely different era . Nowadays , they contend in a theory of_their_own , a range of new , anti-inflationary forces have transformed basic economic behavior . &quot; There is no question that this ( unemployment ) is what the Fed has been focusing_on , and there is no question there are faults in their methodology , &quot; said Mickey D . Levy , chief financial economist with NationsBank in New York . Corporate cost cutting , for example , has evolved from a fad to a new business culture , with major implications for keeping the lid on prices . Consider hiring practices : By some estimates , one in five jobs generated during the recovery has been temporary , saving employers much of the expense of permanent staffers who qualify for full benefits . Global forces are also at play . More_than ever , foreign workers and factories are ready to meet the needs of U.S. consumers when America approaches the limits of its own industrial capacity . &quot; They ' re just wrong , &quot; Robert Pollin , an economics professor at UC Riverside , said of the Fed ' s worries that America ' s falling unemployment_rate threatens an inflationary_spiral . &quot; They haven ' t factored in the downward wage pressures from global competition. &quot; The pressures take various forms . Robert M . Solow , a Nobel laureate economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , believes that American workers are &quot; excruciatingly aware &quot; their jobs can be shifted overseas and , therefore , they are reluctant to push for pay hikes than they used to be . These days , if Ford and Chrysler cannot sell cars fast enough to meet demand , prices need not shoot_up -- because Toyota or Nissan is happy to oblige . The same principle may apply to the labor_market in a world flooded with employees ready to offer their services at wages far lower than U.S. levels . &quot; If some of the world ' s best physicists can be hired in Russia for $ 100 per month , why should anyone pay a third-rate American physicist $ 50 # 000 a year ? &quot; MIT economist Lester C . Thurow recently asked_in the New York Times . Once upon a time , a national policy of full_employment meant what it sounded like : The goal was a job for everybody who wanted one . But it soon became clear that stubborn realities block the path to so idyllic a state . Employers ' needs don ' t always dovetail with applicants ' skills . Qualified employees may_not know about job openings , and even if they do , the workplace may be far away . On top of that , a certain number of workers always are quitting or getting fired . * By the 1960s , economists counseled that an unemployment_rate in the 4 % range was the flash_point for inflation . Then came the youthful baby_boomers , largely unsettled in life , inexperienced in the workplace and often lacking job skills . Estimates of the inflationary flash_point floated toward a 7 % unemployment_rate . Fast-forward to 1994 , and the picture has changed once more . Economists believe the danger_zone has gotten lower , partly due_to a more experienced work_force , and peg it in a range between 5 % and 6.5 % . But that range covers a lot of territory : The difference of 1 1 / 2 percentage_points could be the difference of up_to 2 million jobs , said Ross DeVol , an economist with the WEFA Group in suburban Philadelphia . The debate over the correct level &quot; is fundamentally important , &quot; he says . &quot; The Fed is going_to be under increasing political attack if it continues to tighten and there is no sign of inflation . Congress is going_to be livid. &quot; Just last week , Democratic lawmakers assailed the Fed for precisely that . At a Senate hearing , Sen . Paul S . Sarbanes ( D-Md. ) held_up an editorial cartoon depicting Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan with a sign proclaiming , &quot; The economy is picking_up . We are doomed. &quot; The issue could become even touchier in the coming weeks , in light of some new signs that the economy is perking along faster than expected . The Commerce_Department recently surprised analysts by revising upward to 3 % the nation ' s growth_rate for the first three months of the year . In any case , this much is agreed upon : A recovery once dubbed &quot; jobless &quot; is spewing out new jobs by the hundreds of thousands , and it is doing so without sparking wage inflation so far . But the Fed is_on a course of raising interest_rates anyway , a strategy that will reduce jobs growth in the future : &quot; To the average person on the street , I ' d guess this doesn ' t make a lot of sense , &quot; DeVol said .</TEXT>
