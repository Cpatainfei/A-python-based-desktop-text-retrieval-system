   <HEADLINE> THREE DEPLETED FISHING GROUNDS ORDERED CLOSED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three prime fishing grounds off New England were ordered closed by the U.S. Commerce_Department on Wednesday in an effort to rebuild depleted stocks of cod , haddock and flounder . The emergency order , which will take_effect Monday , shuts off about 6 # 600 square_miles of ocean to virtually all commercial fishing until March 12.The order could be extended after that date . The closed areas include waters in southern New England and parts of Georges Bank , traditionally the region ' s most bountiful and important fishing area . The order exempts fishermen whose by-catch , or the fish caught along with their prime catch , includes less than 5 % cod , haddock or flounder . Such vessels , however , are few . The order also bans New England fishermen , except those who catch very little cod , haddock and flounder , from using nets with mesh sizes smaller than six inches in other areas . The larger mesh allows juvenile fish to escape . In New England , fishermen who have been struggling for years to make a living_off depleted stocks reacted with alarm . &quot; We ' re starving now , &quot; said one , Christo Stamopoulos . Another , John Pereira , predicted the order would force desperate fishermen to work illegally in Canadian waters .</TEXT>
