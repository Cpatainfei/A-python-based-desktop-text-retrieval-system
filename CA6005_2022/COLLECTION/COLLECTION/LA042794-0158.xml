   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA , ISRAEL PLAN STRONGER TIES , RABIN SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wrapping_up the first visit to Russia by an Israeli prime_minister , Yitzhak Rabin emerged from talks with Kremlin leaders Tuesday saying he is convinced that Moscow is working constructively toward peace in the Middle_East . Closing the book on more_than 40 years of hostility between the former Soviet_Union and the Jewish state , Rabin said Israel and Russia expect to strengthen their ties_in everything from trade to military cooperation . Plans include a visit to Israel by Russian Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev . Rabin , whose visit was prompted in part by signs that Moscow is seeking a more active Middle_East role , stressed that he has the Kremlin ' s agreement that neither Russia nor the United States should meddle in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks now under way . &quot; The understanding , I believe , on the part of Russia , as well as on the part of the United States , is to leave the negotiations to be done between us and the representatives of the PLO in Cairo , &quot; Rabin told reporters . His trip to Moscow followed a visit last week by Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat -- who , like Rabin , acquainted Russian leaders with his views on the snags in the talks . Russia and the United States co-sponsored the Mideast peace process launched in Madrid in 1991 , but Moscow took a clear back seat to Washington at that point . In recent months , Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev has been pushing to make Moscow ' s foreign_policy more assertive in_general to steal the initiative from rising Russian ultranationalists . As for Israel ' s interest in Russia , Rabin emphasized mainly the possibilities for expanded trade , saying that an agreement on economic ties and free_trade expected to be signed today is the most important of more_than half_a_dozen concluded during his trip . The warming of Israeli-Russian relations came_in striking contrast to Moscow ' s Cold War-era role of supporting the Arab nations against U.S.-backed Israel . The Soviet_Union and Israel established diplomatic relations only in 1991 , after a 24-year break .</TEXT>
