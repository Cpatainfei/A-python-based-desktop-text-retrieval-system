   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; GOING FOR OLYMPIC GOLD IN PIN TRADING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Joyce Griffith and her friends in the Balboa Ski Club are off to Lillehammer , Norway , for the Winter Olympic Games , which begin today . The only competition they will participate in , though , is the pin-trading event . &quot; We have all kinds of Olympic paraphernalia , we ' ll be carrying around American flags and paint our faces red , white , and blue , &quot; said Griffith , a Huntington Beach resident . &quot; We do all_the silly stuff. &quot; They are part of a 13-person group from the Newport Beach-based Balboa Ski Club leaving for Norway for the second week of the games and the closing ceremonies on Feb . 27 . Many in the group attended the games in Albertville , France two years ago and Calgary six years ago and have evolved into Winter_Olympics die-hards . &quot; We booked ( this trip ) two years ago , &quot; Griffith said Friday in an interview in her house , where she wore an Olympic jacket with the colors of the American flag . She went_to Lillehammer last year to scout for the best accommodations . She is proud to have landed some of the hottest tickets available and lodging_in Lillehammer for $ 600 per night . She , her husband , Larry , and the others will see the women ' s figure-skating event featuring Nancy Kerrigan and , maybe , Tonya Harding , the hockey competition and the closing ceremonies . But the real reason they are going is to trade pins . Griffith is embarrassed to say that she plans to take a full suitcase packed with about 1 # 000 Olympic pins produced in the United States . She hopes to add a wide assortment of international pins to her collection , which includes a Jamaican Bobsled pin from 1992 and a Thailand Olympic team pin from 1984 . Her best items are kept_in albums with pin cushions for pages . &quot; They call it ' pin fever. ' It gets_to be an addiction , &quot; she said , adding that collectors will gather under large circus-like tents at the games to trade pins produced by various countries and their corporate sponsors . As she did at the previous two Olympic Games , Griffith will attend events wearing dozens of pins on her neck scarf . This acts_as a beacon to other traders . &quot; They will come_up_to you and look_at your pins , &quot; she said . Because of the mix of people and language_barriers , many pin transactions are silent and quick . &quot; Everybody understands the language of pins , &quot; said Griffith ' s friend , Sandy Olinyk , who is also going_to Norway . &quot; There is really nothing like this , &quot; Griffith said . &quot; I am not much into sports , but I really get_into this. &quot; When she returns from the Olympics , she will begin planning a 1996 trip to Atlanta for the summer games .
