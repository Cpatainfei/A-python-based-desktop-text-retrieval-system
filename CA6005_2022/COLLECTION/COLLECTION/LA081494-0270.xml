   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES : MEXICO LIKELY TO STAY HIGH ON INVESTORS ' LISTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mexicans go_to the polls later this month to decide the fate of the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) . But regardless of the outcome , the country will probably remain a darling among U.S. mutual_funds that invest in emerging foreign stock_markets . Mexico watchers say that ' s because the free-market reforms that have helped transform Mexico from an economic basket case aren ' t likely to be reversed even in the unlikely event that the PRI loses the presidency for the first time in six decades . Although short-term uncertainty would result from an upset and the pace of reform might lag , the direction won ' t change . &quot; Regardless of the outcome , the direction of Mexico ' s economic future is guaranteed , &quot; Jonathan E . Heath , chief economist at Mexico_City think_tank MACRO Asesoria Economica , wrote in a recent report . &quot; Political debate on economic issues has focused_on possible alternative paths within Mexico ' s new development model , with very few arguing for an all-around reversal , &quot; he added . If anything , investors now seem more confident that the PRI and its presidential candidate , Ernesto Zedillo , will fare well later this month , as indicated by rising stock prices in Mexico_City . &quot; We ' re very bullish , &quot; says Erin Spatz , Latin_American analyst for Pioneer Mutual_Funds in Boston . Some even feel that Mexican stocks have become a bit pricey now that they are near historic highs . The market , which rose by a third in late 1993 , sustained sharp losses early this year when an armed rebellion broke_out in the southern state of Chiapas and Luis Donaldo Colosio , Zedillo ' s predecessor as the PRI presidential candidate , was assassinated in Tijuana . Spatz and others believe the PRI is making a concerted effort to ensure that the Aug . 21 vote will be a valid , fraud-free election , thereby removing another source of worry . That should allow investors to focus again on Mexico ' s general economic picture , which has been one of sustained progress under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari : * Mexico ' s inflation_rate has dropped to about 7 % from more_than 150 % in 1987 . * The government has run a budget surplus the last two years . * Foreign investment has doubled since 1990 . * Exports are growing and are much less dependent_on petroleum . * The government has eliminated price_controls , privatized much industry , reduced tariffs and cut tax_rates . Mexico ' s economy grew by only 0.4 % in 1993 , the slowest pace in five years , but much of that can be explained by uncertainty about whether the United States would ratify the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Approval came_in November , and now that business_leaders on both sides of the border can proceed with their plans , Mexico should see higher growth this year , many believe . &quot; The U.S. economy is picking_up , and Mexico is a prime candidate to piggyback on that , &quot; says Caroline Lane , London-based portfolio manager of the Govett Latin_America Fund , which is headquartered in New York . Lane recently raised her fund ' s Mexican exposure to 49 % of total assets from 39 % in mid-July . James Capel &amp; Co. , a London investment_firm , predicts 4 % real annual growth for Mexico over the rest of the decade . But while Mexico ' s long-term growth prospects appear solid , there is disagreement as_to whether this is already reflected in Mexican share prices . Lane believes the bad-news selling of spring has abated , and Spatz is heartened by an expected 22 % to 25 % improvement in Mexican corporate profits next year . But Josephine Jimenez , portfolio manager of the San Francisco-based Montgomery Emerging Markets Fund , believes that the peso remains overvalued against the dollar and that Mexican stock prices are fairly high . This explains why she reduced her fund ' s Mexican exposure to 6 % currently , down from 10 % in December . Similarly , global money manager Charles Brandes of San Diego says he isn ' t finding many values in the Mexican market , with the exception of Telefonos de Mexico , the country ' s dominant stock . If you remove this issue , which is trading at a price-earnings ratio of about 9 , and banking shares , which are also selling at low multiples , &quot; Mexican stocks are not that cheap , &quot; Brandes says . Also troubling to Jimenez is Chiapas . When she visited the region in May , she found an unsettled situation in an economically important state that accounts_for a large portion of Mexico ' s electricity , natural_gas , coffee and corn output . &quot; The conflict in Chiapas has not been resolved , &quot; she says . Although Jimenez has turned more positive on Mexico in recent weeks as interest_rates have dropped and the political risks seem to have abated , Chiapas remains a &quot; wild card &quot; that could set an example of unrest for other Latin_American countries with large Indian populations , she says . But Spatz doesn ' t think the Chiapas turmoil will derail Mexico ' s movement along a free-market path . To the contrary , she says , the people in this region rebelled because they have seen good in the reforms and want to be included . In short , Mexico almost certainly will remain a favorite destination among the more aggressive international mutual_funds . Latin_America and East Asia are the two most dynamic investment regions , and Mexico has the largest stock_market south of the Rio Grande . Mexico also has a unique tie to the world ' s largest economy , the United States . &quot; Long-term investors can expect to see a good amount of growth in Mexico beyond 1995 , &quot; Spatz says . But they will have to live with uncertainty and volatility along the way . * Contributions to individual_retirement_accounts fell again last year , to an estimated $ 10.5 billion , says the IRA Reporter newsletter in Brainerd , Minn . That was down from $ 10.6 billion in 1992 and marked the fourth consecutive yearly decline . Volume peaked in 1986 at $ 38.3 billion , but tax reform that year curtailed the deductibility of IRA contributions . Nearly 33 % of all IRA assets are in mutual_funds , with slightly more_than half of that in_stock portfolios . * The Evergreen Value Timing Fund , which doesn ' t try to time the market , has switched its name to Evergreen Growth &amp; Income . The fund is headquartered in Purchase , N.Y. Also changing names were the three portfolios in the Quantitative Group of Funds of Lincoln , Mass . The Quantitative Numeric Fund is the new nomenclature for the Boston Numeric Series , Quantitative Growth &amp; Income substitutes for Boston Growth &amp; Income , and Quantitative International Equity replaces Boston Foreign Growth &amp; Income . * Men hold about 10 times more seats on the boards of mutual_fund companies than women , says a Boston-based trade newsletter . In a study of the boards at 56 leading fund groups , Mutual Fund Market News found that men hold 5 # 983 director positions , compared to 517 for women . &quot; While these boards may represent funds ' management , it is highly unlikely that they reflect their shareholders , &quot; says the newsletter . Women make_up about 44 % of fund investors . Ways to Play Mexico Anyone who wants to invest in a volatile stock_market such_as Mexico ' s should consider a diversified approach . Depending_on the type of fund , Mexican stocks could be a large or small part of a general strategy . Here are the levels of Mexican exposure offered by funds in selected categories . * Global and International . Lipper Analytical Services of Summit , N.J. , identifies more_than 100 global and 200 international names . Global funds include the United States ; international funds invest everywhere else . These funds generally focus their foreign holdings in the larger markets of Western Europe and Japan , with 6 % to 8 % of their money in Latin_America , of which Mexico is usually the largest part . * Emerging markets . A couple of dozen portfolios key on the developing foreign economies outside Western Europe and Japan . About 40 % of their money is in Latin_America , with Mexico accounting_for nearly half that . * Regional . At midyear , Lipper counted nine distinct Latin_American funds , the biggest run_by Fidelity Investments , G.T. Capital , Merrill Lynch and Scudder . As the largest Latin market , Mexico figures in as much as 50 % of the regional funds ' assets . * Single country . A few closed-end portfolios concentrate_on Mexican stocks . They are the Mexico Fund , the Mexico Equity &amp; Income Fund and the Emerging Mexico Fund .</TEXT>
