   <HEADLINE> VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW : NO RISE EXPECTED IN COTTON GARMENT PRICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even though the price of raw cotton is up sharply this year , George Hagopian , president of Cotton USA , a Moorpark manufacturer of women ' s clothing , doesn ' t expect a corresponding increase in retail costs . &quot; Between the mill and the retail_store , a garment goes_through so many hands that the cost of the cotton isn ' t that important , &quot; he said. &quot; I think supply and demand have much more impact on the final price. &quot; Hagopian won ' t disclose dollar figures , but says his sales have tripled over the past two years . He credits a revamped nationwide marketing operation and wide acceptance of Cotton USA ' s latest leisure_wear . The line , designed by Hagopian and his wife , Lydia , emphasizes lace trim and lots of embroidery . Cotton USA has 200 employees , up from 110 a year ago . The firm ' s garments are made entirely of domestically grown cotton . Those spiraling cotton prices , incidentally , are blamed on a disappointing harvest in China and other parts of Asia .</TEXT>
