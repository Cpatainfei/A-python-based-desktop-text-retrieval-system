Team USA lost its unbeaten record to the Great Hagi ' s gifted Romanians , but still it staggered out of the caldron virtually certain to reach the last 16 of the finals of ' 94 . . . . An overheated , capacity crowd of more_than 93 # 000 kept faith with America ' s new sporting heroes , urging them on to a last 10 minutes of unremitting but unrewarded pressure . By restricting this defeat to a single goal they surely took_out insurance against elimination , even if third-finishing teams in other groups equaled their accumulation of four points .</TEXT>
