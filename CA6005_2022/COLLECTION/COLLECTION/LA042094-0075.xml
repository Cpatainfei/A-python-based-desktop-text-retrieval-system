   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SIMI VALLEY ; COUNCIL DROPS FEE FOR QUAKE VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Simi Valley homeowners seeking loans to repair earthquake damage will not be charged a $ 25 fee by the city to research whether their property is in a flood zone , the council has decided . In a 5-0 vote , the City_Council agreed Monday night to drop the fee the city normally charges to provide a letter to property_owners stating flood-zone status.The exemption , however , applies only to earthquake victims . A notarized letter concerning flood-zone status is required by many banks and lenders , including the Small Business Administration , which is offering low-interest loans to those making earthquake repairs . The city ' s research fee covers the cost of looking_up the property , confirming its status and producing the notarized letter for the resident . After the city ' s flood zone was reduced in size last month , about 1 # 200 residents were dropped from the flood area . A City_Council resolution in January eliminated several other fees for earthquake victims , including those for building permits . MARY F . POLS</TEXT>
