   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; S . AFRICA ' S ELECTORAL COLLEGES ; VOTER-EDUCATION GROUPS ARE TRYING TO HELP MILLIONS OF FIRST-TIMERS LEARN TO MARK A BALLOT OR OVERCOME CONFUSION AND FEAR . THE STAKES ARE HIGH -- ANY TAINT ON THE APRIL ELECTIONS COULD SPELL TROUBLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Democracy clearly is a bit daunting to the workers on the afternoon shift at the giant Impala Platinum Ltd . refinery here . Eighteen men sit in a small sports pavilion , listening patiently as Vincent Ngcobo explains their rights and responsibilities when South_Africa goes_to the polls next month for the first election in which blacks will be able to vote after 340 years of white rule . These men are black . Their questions are to_the_point . Since Ngcobo keeps referring to the national election and the new National Assembly , does that mean they must vote for President Frederik W . de Klerk ' s National Party ? Should they mark an X on the ballot for the party they want -- or against the party they don ' t like ? Does an X , which many illiterate people use for a signature , mean they can be identified later ? &quot; Your vote is secret , &quot; Ngcobo , a trainer for one of scores of non-governmental voter-education groups , assures them in English , Zulu , Xhosa and Sotho . Elphus Mokoena , a 29-year-old machinist , is convinced . He plans to drive four hours to vote_in his home village . &quot; If I don ' t vote , maybe my party will only lose by one vote , &quot; he says later . With the April 26-28 vote fast approaching , a fierce election fever has swept the land . Although headlines focus_on South_Africa ' s continuing violence and on the daily campaigning by De Klerk and his chief rival , African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela , the critical challenge lies behind the scenes in scores of voter-education programs like this one . About 22.5 million South_Africans will be eligible to vote -- up_to 18 million for the first time . And nearly half of those newly enfranchised blacks are functionally_illiterate . But with a long and confusing ballot offering a choice of 26 national and provincial parties , concern is growing that many voters will be too scared to vote or will inadvertently spoil their paper ballots , undermining the legitimacy of this country ' s most momentous day . Mock elections at factories , shopping_malls , sports stadiums , farms and mines around the country suggest that more_than 2 million ballots may be spoiled , most from poor , rural , uneducated blacks who would be expected to back the ANC . &quot; Our mock elections and workshops show 15 % to 20 % spoiled ballots , &quot; warned Jesse Maluleke , election coordinator for COSATU , the nation ' s largest labor federation . &quot; And that ' s frightening. &quot; He added : &quot; We don ' t have much time left . And there hasn ' t been much progress in voter literacy. &quot; The most extensive poll ever done_in South_Africa , based on 8 # 004 interviews , also produced unsettling results . In mock elections , one in 10 blacks accidentally invalidated a ballot . That number rose to 28 % in rural regions . And not all mistakes came from illiterate voters . &quot; Some people simply wrote , ' I don ' t know how to vote ' &quot; on the ballots , said Susan Booysen , who directed the poll for the Matla Trust , the largest of the country ' s scores of voter-education groups . &quot; The confusion level is very , very high. &quot; The survey was conducted before last month ' s decision by the ANC and the government , later ratified by the Parliament , that each voter will get two ballots in_order to pick separate parties for the national and provincial assemblies . The change came_after months of teaching voters to use one ballot . &quot; We can really expect a lot more confusion when people are issued with two ballots , &quot; Booysen predicted . The mock elections , for example , now show that many people think the second ballot is for their second choice . The switch to two ballots also has caused a logistics nightmare . Millions of printed pamphlets , posters , comic_books and other voter-education materials , some printed in the country ' s 11 major languages , were suddenly out of date . A &quot; How to Vote &quot; video , shown on TV , in churches and in union halls , had to be quickly redone . So did sections of a 13-part TV series called &quot; Khululeka , &quot; the Zulu word for freedom , that had been in production for more_than a year . &quot; One of the biggest problems is the uncertainty &quot; of recent political developments , said Barry Gilder , head of the Independent Forum for Electoral Education , an umbrella group of 40 non-governmental organizations running voter programs . &quot; The date , the details of the election , the use of two ballots -- all these are causing problems. &quot; So is overcoming the legacy of the ruthless apartheid-era bureaucracy , which left millions of blacks without proper identification documents . Hundreds of thousands of people have lined_up for voter IDs in recent weeks . Then there ' s the huge national ballot . With 17 parties listed , it will be longer than this newspaper page . Anyone with $ 20 # 000 and a signed application could register , and several newly formed parties had little more_than that . There ' s KISS -- The Keep It Straight and Simple party -- for example , and SOCCER , the Sports Organization for Collective Contributions and Equal Rights . &quot; The list is too long , &quot; complained the Rev . Sam Xontana , a Matla Trust organizer in Klerksdorp in the western Transvaal . &quot; It confuses people. &quot; A lottery selected how the national parties will be listed . Mandela ' s ANC is No . 12 . But it follows , all_in a row , a series of little-known parties with similar sounding names : the Africa Muslim Party , the African Christian Democratic Party , the African Democratic Movement and , until recently , the African Moderate Congress . The ANC formally protested that the previously unheard-of AMC had to change its name to avoid a mix-up . It did change -- to the African Moderate Congress Party , or AMCP . Election specialists warn of other problems . The new South_Africa will have nine provinces instead of the current four . Each province will have its own new capital , legislature and government . &quot; Explaining the difference between regional and national governments is very hard when you have to first tell people how to do an X , &quot; said Michael Goldberg , a program officer with Project Vote , based in Cape_Town . To help them , the ballots will list each party ' s name , initials and symbol as well as a color photo of its standard-bearer . Any mark that shows a voter ' s clear intention -- an X , a check , even a circle_around the picture -- will be counted . Voters who are illiterate , blind or in need of other assistance may ask an election official for help in marking the ballot . &quot; But that ' s a problem too , &quot; Goldberg said . &quot; We ' ve been telling everyone this is a secret ballot. &quot; More ominous are regular reports of deliberate intimidation and disinformation . De Klerk ' s campaign rallies have been disrupted repeatedly by chanting , spitting , stone-throwing mobs of ANC supporters . At least eight ANC offices have been bombed or torched . And millions of black voters remain inaccessible to voter-education groups and campaigners alike , particularly those who live_on farms run_by right-wing whites and in and around the KwaZulu homeland controlled by Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi . Buthelezi ' s Inkatha Freedom Party is boycotting the election , and political violence between his more militant followers and local ANC members has claimed thousands of lives in recent years . They include 15 young ANC election workers who were massacred Feb . 19 in southern Natal province after they had put_up posters for a voter workshop . &quot; The lack of free canvassing will be a factor , and may be a crucial factor , &quot; in any determination of whether the elections are free and fair , warned Judge Johann Kriegler , chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission , which is the official election watchdog and will certify the final results . Kriegler said that access and intimidation worry him far more_than ruined ballots . &quot; The experience in many other countries , such_as Angola , shows the percentage of spoiled ballots is often far lower than many people , particularly Westerners , expect . . . . The fact that someone is illiterate doesn ' t mean someone is stupid , &quot; he said . Still , voting here won ' t be simple . It entails 12 steps , including producing valid identity documents and getting them stamped . Voters will also have their hands marked with ultraviolet-sensitive ink , so no one can vote twice , before they can mark the sacred X on the two ballot papers . No one seems to know how much is being spent for voter education , but estimates reach at least $ 40 million , not including free air time on state-run radio and TV . Most funding comes from governments in the United States , Canada and Western Europe . The U.S. Agency for International Development alone has earmarked $ 35 million for election-related assistance , including $ 20 million for voter education . The bonanza has sparked a feeding frenzy among potential recipients , according to the head of one non-governmental group who asked not to be identified . &quot; It ' s a very avaricious scene , &quot; she said . &quot; Everybody wants a piece of the action. &quot; Not all_the money is_well spent . Many scheduled workshops , street theater performances and other election events , especially in the squalid squatter camps and slum townships where most blacks live , run_into problems . The Matla Trust , for example , recently announced a workshop and mock election in Tswelelang , a rural township with dirt roads and no running water 150 miles southwest of Johannesburg . A popular local minister had promised to publicize the occasion at his Sunday service and to book a local sports stadium . &quot; It ' s a fiasco , &quot; trainer Dolos Luka , 35 , said angrily after arriving with a reporter at the locked church and empty stadium . &quot; The priest did nothing. &quot; He shrugged . &quot; This happens a lot. &quot; Still , the country is awash in TV and radio spots , billboards , newspaper_ads and graffiti promoting the election . Thousands of minivans used as taxis play voter-education tapes ; appliance stores screen voter videos on their TVs , and theater groups perform educational skits . One of the more unusual groups is Prophets of the City , a popular black rap band that has begun free &quot; Rapping for Democracy &quot; performances at township high_schools , where many students are over 18 and thus eligible to vote . About 1 # 300 wide-eyed students at Thomas Mofolo High_School in Soweto giggled , cheered and danced recently in the blazing midday sun when lead singer Dion ( Ready D ) Daniels , in baggy pants and unlaced boots , took the microphone and the music thumped and scratched from giant speakers . &quot; Vote for hope , it ' s no joke , &quot; he sang . &quot; Show you care_for humanity . We can ' t live_in a divided society ! &quot; Don ' t think if you don ' t vote , you ' re protected . Because some sucker will still get elected ! So vote for peace , vote for hope . Yo baby , yo baby , yo baby , YO ! &quot;</TEXT>
