   <TEXT> With President Clinton taking credit for the nation ' s economic revival in a visit to southeast Michigan on Tuesday , a Big Three auto_maker provided solid proof of good times in the heartland . Chrysler Corp . reported earnings of $ 650 million in the three months ended Sept . 30 , compared to the $ 423 million it earned in the third quarter of last year . The nation ' s No . 3 auto_maker said the 54 % jump in earnings -- a record profit for the normally slow third quarter -- reflects continuing strong sales of minivans , small trucks and cars , as well as lower incentives offered to consumers . Sales increased 21 % in the quarter to $ 11.7 billion . &quot; The results were excellent , &quot; said Maryann Keller , an analyst with Furman Selz , a New York brokerage . &quot; It ' s a story of a company managing its costs well and being the beneficiary of a robust truck market. &quot; In the first nine months of 1994 , Chrysler generated sales of $ 38 billion and earned $ 2.55 billion -- more money than it has made during any single year in the past decade . Despite the strong performance , Chrysler ' s stock moved_up just 62.5 cents to $ 46.50 on Tuesday on the New York Stock_Exchange . The stocks of Ford Motor Co . and General Motors Corp. , which also expect to report strong profits later this month , also moved_up . Ford gained $ 1.125 to $ 29.375 , and GM leaped $ 1.625 to $ 47.125. The earnings_report came_on a day Clinton visited the Detroit area to campaign for Rep . Bob Carr ( D-Mich. ) , who is in a tight Senate_race with Republican Spencer Abraham . In a speech to several thousand auto workers at Ford ' s Mustang assembly_plant in Dearborn , the President said his policies had revived an economy &quot; stuck_in reverse. &quot; He later met with Big Three executives and UAW members , praising both for the industry ' s turnaround . Auto sales have been one of the brightest spots of the economy . For the first nine months of the year , car and truck sales are up 9 % over last year , and most analysts predict the boom will continue through 1995 . In the third quarter , Chrysler ' s sales increased 15 % from a year ago . Demand was particularly strong for its minivans , Jeep Grand Cherokee , Dodge Ram pickup and Neon subcompact . The brisk sales allowed the company to improve its profit_margins by dropping consumer incentives . The average discount given buyers was $ 520 in the quarter , down from $ 775 a year ago . &quot; Strong retail demand . . . allowed us to reduce incentives despite increased competition , &quot; Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said . The company ' s production is expected to increase substantially in the fourth quarter . And analysts expect its sales to continue to increase . &quot; They should do even better next year , &quot; said David Cole , director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan . Chrysler , which was in deep financial trouble just five years ago , is using the soaring profits to improve its balance_sheet . The company contributed $ 600 million in the quarter to its unfunded pension liability , bringing_to $ 1.8 billion the amount it has set_aside this year . Company officials said the unfunded liability -- which stood at $ 2.2 billion at the end of last year -- should be eliminated by Dec . 30 .</TEXT>
