   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : THESE ANGELS can ' t DESCEND MUCH LOWER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Of all_the endless summers , poor seasons and very bad years the Angels have had , this one is by far the worst . It began with an earthquake that took_out their scoreboard and sent their &quot; Big A &quot; itself listing like the Poseidon . It continued with the sudden and inexcusable dismissal of their manager , Buck Rodgers , a man who was getting the most out of this ballclub ' s limited talent . It worsened with the Angels ' becoming the worst team in baseball ' s worst division . It hit bottom with the death of the ageless , guileless , peerless Jimmie Reese , king of the fungo , friend and angel guardian to Nolan Ryan and Bo Jackson and Jim Abbott and more . And just when you figured there is no place lower than bottom , the Angels descended again . Jackie Autry said she and her husband Gene , upon the cancellation of the rest of the baseball_season , have had enough . They are expected to sell their beloved Angels , presumably to the highest bidder . Could be the nice mice from Disney . Could be the fat cat Marvin Davis . Could be some new Player , capital P , to be named later . Gene Autry is stepping_out of the saddle . This is no cause for celebration . I don ' t care how poorly the Angels have been run_for the last 30-odd years . Gene Autry was totally and hopelessly devoted to this cause . It meant as much to him as anything he did on film on horseback . He deserved better . He got_worse . Somewhere up in Heaven , Jimmie Reese couldn ' t bear to watch Wednesday . The baseball_players he adored , the ones he rapped grounders and popped pop-ups to all day long , were nowhere to be found . Jimmie was the foreman on Gene Autry ' s ranch . But all_the hired hands had gone_into town . Dark day at the Big A . There was a splendid TV special on Channel 5 a_few weeks ago , assembled meticulously by KTLA sports producer Cathy Karp , in celebration of Angel baseball throughout the years . Each segment was bumpered by images of Gene Autry in his heyday , saying howdy ma ' am and ridin ' off into the sunset and such . Well , Gene really is riding_off into the sunset . Oh , he has broadcast holdings and a fine Western Heritage museum bearing his name and who knows what else in his saddlebags , but by far his most public persona was as owner of the Angels , the losin ' est team in the West . I used to wonder why the Angels never were ridiculed around the country as hopeless losers similar to the Red Sox and Cubs and Indians . After all , what had the Angels ever won ? At least those other clubs had been in a World_Series , once upon a time or twice . And then I realized , there is no sense of life-or-death passion among Angel fans , no sense of emotional need that would leave anyone with a bad case of the summertime blues , should the Angels flop again . Boston , Chicago , Cleveland fans care deeply about their teams , go_into long funks over their failings . Nobody cares that much about the Angels . Nobody but Mr. Autry , who has been their constant companion . His wife , who is now the hands-on boss of the business , said with obvious sorrow Wednesday that it mattered not whether her husband had $ 300 million in the bank or not one penny . They were done with the Angels for good . They had had it . Gene and Jackie evidently are asking $ 130 mil for the whole_shebang . Even so , he cannot completely tear himself away from the team he loves . A proviso will be made that less than one-quarter of ownership profits will change hands while Mr. Autry is still around , which we hope will be forever . Nevertheless , the new owner will call the shots . All this haggling and bickering , all these spiraling costs and deepening pools of red ink , they all got_to be too_much . As Jackie Autry put it , &quot; This has been like a freight_train coming_down the track. &quot; Gene could stop a runaway stagecoach , but not a train . You can ' t rope a train . He made mistakes . He put the wrong guys in_charge . He put too many guys in_charge . He got poor advice . He got good people and then let them get_away -- Abbott , Dante Bichette , Rodgers , Whitey Herzog . He put champagne on ice and watched it go flat . He came so close but remains so far away . In the Gene Autry regime , the Angels knew joy but never fulfillment . They had individuals but never the whole team . They lost strong young_men to gunshots and accidents and watched teammates careen off a turnpike in a capsized bus . They abandoned the team ' s most popular players and brought_in some of the sport ' s most obnoxious . All along , you rooted for two guys . You rooted for Jimmie Reese , and now he ' s gone . And you rooted for Gene Autry , who is parting company . Pardon my sentimentality , because it really hasn ' t been much of a baseball_team . But I offer my sympathy today to Mr. Autry , who stuck_with it through thin and thinner . His only Champion was his horse .</TEXT>
