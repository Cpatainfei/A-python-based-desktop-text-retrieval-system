   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TOP_QUARK PUZZLE ; PHYSICS : TEAM BELIEVES IT HAS FOUND EVIDENCE OF THE ELUSIVE SUBATOMIC PARTICLE THAT IS PART OF ALL MATTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scientists at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory announced Tuesday that they have detected strong evidence of an elusive particle at the heart of all matter in the universe , providing the best proof yet of the hidden structure of the material world . &quot; We aren ' t looking_at the face of God , but we are deciphering his handwriting , &quot; said Thomas Muller , a UCLA physicist who was a member of the team that detected the presence of the top_quark , as the subatomic_particle is known . Ending years of rumor and speculation , the announcement culminated a 17-year search that cost more_than $ 100 million and involved 440 researchers from 49 universities and five national governments -- the United States , Japan , Canada , Taiwan and Italy . Discovery of the top_quark , if confirmed , completes one set of subatomic building_blocks whose existence is predicted by the prevailing theory , called the Standard Model , of the particles and forces that determine the fundamental nature of matter and energy . In the whimsical lexicon of modern physics , the elementary_particles are called quarks , leptons and bosons . Murray Gell-Mann , the Caltech physicist who won a 1969 Nobel Prize for pioneering the theory of the Standard Model , said the news was &quot; splendid. &quot; &quot; Not finding it would have been shocking , &quot; Gell-Mann said . &quot; We theorists would have to fall on our fountain_pens . It would be an inconceivable disaster for theorists if they could not find it. &quot; Ron Ruth , head of the accelerator theory department at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center , said , &quot; It is the final piece of the puzzle . This puts to rest the doubts. &quot; The discovery may be the last hurrah for American high-energy physics , under whose banner three generations of scientists have dominated the search for the fundamental building_blocks of matter . Only one other particle -- called the Higgs boson -- has yet to be tracked_down , and , with the cancellation of the Superconducting Supercollider project last year , no U.S. atom_smasher will be powerful enough to detect it . The finding of the top_quark has an impact similar to filling_in the last blank in the periodic_table of the elements . Many of the elements have little or no direct impact on everyday life , but their existence affirms scientists ' picture of the composition of matter . All matter is composed of atoms , which are made_up of electrons , neutrons and protons . Those in turn contain even more elementary pieces , such_as quarks . Gell-Mann named them after a word he found in a cryptic reference in the novel &quot; Finnegan ' s Wake &quot; by James Joyce . There are six kinds of quarks in all , linked to each other in pairs . The top_quark , the most massive and last to be detected , has puzzled physicists for so_long that they hope finally understanding it will lead to new insights into the origin of matter . The top_quark by itself is as heavy as an entire atom of gold . The so-called bottom_quark , which is linked to the top_quark , was detected by Fermi researchers 17 years ago . But the top_quark was remarkably hard to find because it decays so quickly , existing for less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second before breaking_down into lighter particles . No one has laid eyes on a top_quark or captured its direct image on film . Instead , physicists at Fermi collected evidence of its brief existence by tracking the distinctive trail of byproducts it leaves_behind . The search is particularly difficult because a top_quark can decay in several different ways , producing a number of possible electronic signatures . The Tevatron particle_accelerator at Fermi outside Chicago is the most powerful in_use today , spinning protons and antiprotons at close to the speed_of_light in a giant underground ring four miles in circumference . When the particles collide , they create a tiny fireball of energy as intense as the Big Bang itself when the universe was barely a trillionth of a second old -- its energy safely contained by Tevatron ' s massive magnetic_field . As they smash , particles fly off in all directions . For that hellish instant , the Tevatron contains the hottest spot in the solar_system -- still just barely enough energy to create the conditions for the top_quark to appear . By repeating such collisions millions of times , researchers believe they caught a dozen glimpses of the top_quark on the Tevatron ' s 5 # 000-ton detector . Data from test runs in August , 1992 , and June , 1993 , provided the most persuasive evidence of the top_quark , said Melvyn J . Shochet , a physicist at the University of Chicago who is a spokesman for the Fermi project . The particles detected , Shochet said , were actually the ones into which a top_quark would eventually break_down , &quot; the grandsons and granddaughters , &quot; he said . The top_quark could decay in several different ways , and two of those patterns were spotted . &quot; Our confidence grew when we discovered the second interaction , &quot; Muller said . In one of the apparent paradoxes that abound_in particle physics , researchers had predicted that the top_quark would be heavier than the proton from which it came . From their data , Fermi scientists measured the top_quark ' s mass at about 200 times that of a proton , well within the range predicted by the theory . At a Fermi conference late last year , participating physicists agreed that they should write a journal article analyzing their results , but wrangled over what their videotapes showed . Although they were certain they had highly significant results , they could not agree on whether they had gathered enough data to be absolutely sure they had actually created the missing particle . At a news_conference Tuesday to announce the discovery , William C . Carithers Jr. , a senior staff physicist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory who is a visiting researcher at Fermi , said , &quot; The evidence is too_large to ignore , but too small to cry ' Eureka ! ' &quot; The researchers were anxious to stake their claim to the discovery as soon as practical but equally anxious to avoid the embarrassment of a public error . After all , a European lab had announced the discovery of the top_quark previously and then retracted its claim because of mistakes in interpreting the background of vast numbers of particles . Last week , the team submitted its 150-page manuscript to a peer-reviewed science journal called Physical Review D . A separate team of 420 researchers at Fermi is attempting to independently confirm the findings . Fermi officials said they decided not to wait for the usual outside scientific review and make their announcement at the news_conference . Word of the Fermi data was leaking_out , and the group felt confident enough to declare it had found evidence of the top_quark . Some misgivings still linger . John Peoples Jr. , director of the Fermi Lab , said Tuesday , &quot; I am persuaded that the evidence is very strong. &quot; But , he said , &quot; there are some inconsistencies. &quot; Carithers said that there is only a &quot; 1-in-400 chance &quot; the scientists are wrong . Shochet said he would like to see &quot; two or three times &quot; as much data &quot; fingerprinting &quot; of the top_quark before declaring a definitive discovery , but that &quot; this is the first time you have a serious hint of something. &quot;</TEXT>
