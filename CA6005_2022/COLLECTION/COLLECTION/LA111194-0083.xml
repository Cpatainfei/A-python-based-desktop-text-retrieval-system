   <HEADLINE> $ 2.7-BILLION PLAN DRAFTED TO ENHANCE MILITARY LIFE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping to boost the quality_of_life in the armed forces , the Pentagon announced an ambitious $ 2.7-billion initiative Thursday to modernize and build new military housing , enhance family-support programs and raise military paychecks for those who live_in high-cost areas like Los Angeles . The programs , which officials hope to begin by the next fiscal_year and continue until the end of the decade , underscore a belief by senior defense officials that modern American soldiers are under increasing stress as they are called_on to defuse more and more regional crises around the globe . &quot; We have the highest_quality force in our nation ' s history , &quot; said Defense_Secretary William J . Perry . &quot; But there are stress points that need to be addressed if we want to maintain that quality into the future. &quot; Added Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff : &quot; We cannot jeopardize the backbone of our armed forces , the core of military excellence -- our people . This is not merely a sentiment but it is a conviction. &quot; Pentagon officials said that the initiatives will not require an increase in defense spending . Instead , the money will be shifted from programs for modernization and other technological improvements that had been planned for the years ahead . Perry would not specify which of those programs would be cut but he suggested that keeping troop morale high is more important at this point than investing in new weapons_systems . &quot; To the extent it ' s necessary to trade off between modernization on the one hand and readiness items on the other , I am prepared to do that in favor of readiness , &quot; he said . He also declined to comment on whether the public would support increased defense spending as proposed by some Republicans taking_over key roles in Congress . &quot; I ' m not making any assumptions at this point about increases in the top line of the Pentagon budget , &quot; the secretary said . &quot; We will meet with the new committee chairman and get their views and their programs. &quot; He added that he and other Pentagon officials have worked well with members of both political_parties in Congress . &quot; I don ' t have any basis as I stand here for seeing a discontinuity in decisions or judgments about support for our defense_program , &quot; Perry said . The main elements of the six-year program call_for keeping 10 # 000 on-base homes that otherwise would close for lack of maintenance , making repairs_to another 5 # 000 barracks spaces and establishing &quot; private sector housing ventures &quot; to stimulate new home building projects . Other highlights are paycheck boosts of up_to $ 167 a month for some 30 # 000 enlisted people living_in communities like Los Angeles , San Francisco and New York where housing prices are high , and improved child_care centers , recreation programs and base commissaries . The goal , Perry said , is to make a military career more enjoyable . He noted that as the military reduces its size , &quot; many service members question their long-term commitment and the prospects of a full career. &quot; He said that the turbulence of base closures &quot; has disrupted &quot; many military families . Fighter squadrons in Europe are being moved_around even &quot; before families were settled , &quot; he said , and a &quot; high operational tempo has put an extra strain on selected units. &quot; In the Air_Force alone , he said , the number of service members deployed away from home is four times as high as it was just five years ago . Easing some of these stress levels will go_a_long_way to improving the overall effectiveness of the military , he predicted .</TEXT>
