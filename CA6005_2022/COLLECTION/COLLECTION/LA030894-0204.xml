   <HEADLINE> SOME APARTMENT OWNERS ON SHAKY FINANCIAL GROUND ; FACING STEEP QUAKE REPAIRS IN ADDITION TO HEFTY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS , SOME LANDLORDS COULD BE THREATENED WITH FORECLOSURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jack and Sally Nissenbaum have spent many sleepless nights since the Jan . 17 earthquake jolted the San Fernando Valley , worried about the aftershock if their lender decides to foreclose on the $ 1.3-million mortgage on their 50 apartment units . The apartments , located in five buildings on Alabama Avenue , Valerio Street and Variel Avenue in Canoga Park , were heavily damaged in the quake , causing about three-fourths of the tenants to move . &quot; We have very minimal income from the properties , not enough to pay the mortgage or the utilities , &quot; said Sally Nissenbaum . To make matters worse , the properties were assessed at $ 750 # 000 shortly before the quake -- or $ 550 # 000 less than what the Nissenbaums owe the lender , Home Savings of America . Jack Nissenbaum , who has owned the apartments with his wife since 1979 , blamed the buildings ' depreciation on the weak economy of the past years , which forced landlords to lower rents and reduced the value of apartments . Fortunately , the Nissenbaums received a two-month moratorium from Home Savings on their $ 12 # 000 monthly mortgage payments . But they also face the difficult challenge of repairing the apartments and filling them with tenants again so they will not lose the properties . For now , Home Savings has agreed not to foreclose . But the Nissenbaums will have to start paying_back the mortgage in a_few weeks , before the apartment units can be repaired and rented_out . In addition to unpaid utility bills and mortgage payments , the Nissenbaums also worry about an estimated $ 8 # 700 property_tax bill due next month . &quot; I don ' t know what ' s going_to happen . You can drive yourself crazy thinking about different possibilities , and some of those possibilities are horrendous , &quot; said Jack Nissenbaum . Unlike many homeowners who were given an opportunity by their lenders to delay mortgage payments on their damaged homes for a_few months , not all small apartment owners received similar consideration from their lenders . Some apartment owners are being told to continue making mortgage payments on damaged and vacant buildings . Although the Nissenbaums ' apartments were tagged habitable by building inspectors , they require extensive repairs , including broken windows , separated walls , and a collapsed ceiling in at least one unit . The couple will not know how much the repairs will cost until they get a damage estimate from their insurance_company . Home Savings , knowing of the problems that can arise whenever a property is worth less than what is owed on it , gave the Nissenbaums a moratorium on the mortgage payments until April 1 . The couple , who have earthquake insurance , hope to receive a settlement from their carrier by the end of March and start rebuilding . A few miles away in Reseda , veterinarian Morton La Pittus is not so lucky . He owns 28 apartment units in two buildings located on the 6400 block of Shirley Avenue , about a mile from the epicenter of January ' s quake . La Pittus , who also owns a home_in Rancho Santa Fe in San Diego County , lives in one of the apartment units during the week . The buildings sustained about $ 100 # 000 in damage , La Pittus said , and he asked the lender , First Nationwide Bank in San Francisco , for a three-month moratorium on the $ 5 # 600 monthly mortgage payments so he could use the money for repairs . Unlike the Nissenbaums , La Pittus had no earthquake insurance , and his lender , First Nationwide , did not give him a grace period for paying his mortgage . &quot; I wasn ' t looking_for anything free . I asked_for a three-month moratorium , but I wanted them to tack the three months to the end of the loan , &quot; he said . La Pittus and the Nissenbaums both requested the mortgage moratoriums after seeing Home Savings and First Nationwide ' s newspaper_ads offering deferred_payments to customers to help them recover from the deadly quake . However , most of those programs were intended for residential mortgage holders whose homes were damaged or destroyed in the quake . How much a commercial lender is willing to bend with a borrower may have something to do with the type of mortgage they hold . For instance , under California law , original mortgage loans are typically non-recourse loans , meaning that a lender cannot sue the borrower to make_up the difference if a repossessed property is worth less than the debt on it . But most refinanced mortgages are recourse loans , meaning that if a lender forecloses on a property that is worth less than what is owed on the mortgage , the borrower can be sued to make_up the difference . * The mortgages on both of La Pittus ' apartment complexes are recourse loans because he refinanced in 1985 . He has owned the units since 1977 . By comparison , the Nissenbaums are still paying on the original mortgage loans on their five apartment complexes . La Pittus said he was told by Keith Cousans , First Nationwide vice_president of commercial loans , that the lender cannot offer a moratorium on a refinanced loan . In addition , La Pittus said First Nationwide threatened to put the properties in foreclosure if he stops paying on the $ 800 # 000 mortgage loan . If the bank repossesses the buildings and is forced to sell them for less than the outstanding loan , &quot; they said they ' d turn_around and sue me for the difference , &quot; La Pittus said . Cousans declined to comment . According to La Pittus , even with the damage to the buildings -- which he said suffered mostly cosmetic damage -- the properties are still valued at about $ 1.2 million , more_than enough equity to cover the mortgage held by First Nationwide . Sherry Rosen , of the Apartment Assn . of the San Fernando Valley , said that generally , &quot; banks are being good about extending loans &quot; made to apartment owners . &quot; But the problems are with lenders who sold the ( mortgages ) to other parties , and , in some cases , refinanced loans. &quot; Bruce Indermill , of Hallmark Property Management in Van Nuys , agreed that &quot; most lenders are being cooperative , &quot; but , he said , many lenders are still studying landlords ' requests for moratoriums on loan payments . Hallmark manages 45 residential income properties , all apartments , throughout the Valley and elsewhere throughout Los Angeles County . &quot; We are still assessing what ' s going_on and how the repairs are going_to be paid . We ' re ( Hallmark ) the information conduit for the owners , so they can fill_out the FEMA and SBA applications , &quot; said Indermill , referring to loans sought from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration . &quot; We ' re doing the legwork for them. &quot; The Nissenbaums are counting_on a settlement from their insurance_company to pay_for the damage to their five buildings . La Pittus , who had no earthquake insurance , has applied for an SBA loan to pay_for the $ 100 # 000 damage to his two buildings . In addition , La Pittus also petitioned Los Angeles County officials to waive the $ 3 # 456 property_tax bill due next month . &quot; I ' ve used the $ 14 # 000 extra cash I had in the account to pay_for some repairs , and I ' ve also used the money that was set_aside to pay_for property_taxes , &quot; he said . Sally Nissenbaum , while thankful for the two-month moratorium extended by Home Savings , said getting the extension was a trying experience . &quot; They paper you to death . The bank keeps demanding all kinds of documents already in their files . I don ' t know what we ' re going to do if we don ' t hear from the insurance_company before April 1 , when we have to start making payments again . We ' re scared to death the bank will call the loan , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
