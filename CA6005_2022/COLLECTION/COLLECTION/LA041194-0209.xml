   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES : IN THE LONG_RUN , A STOCK-BOND BALANCE PAYS OFF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The frustrating thing about this year ' s investment slump isn ' t just that stocks have fallen or bonds have dropped , but that they ' ve declined together . During the first_quarter of 1994 , the two categories moved down virtually the same path . Equity funds , including international and sector portfolios , fell an average of 3.2 % , according to Lipper Analytical Services of Summit , N.J. Taxable-bond funds in_general were down 2.2 % . U.S._government bond funds declined 3.2 % , the same amount as stocks . Of course , such close synchronization is to be expected , since rising interest_rates hurt both markets , right ? Well , not exactly . While higher rates clearly harm bond prices , the link isn ' t always so certain with stock investments . Rising rates are usually accompanied by stronger economic activity , and that can be a plus for equities , says C . Frazier Evans , chief economist of the Colonial mutual_fund group in Boston . &quot; Equities can resist rising interest_rates -- it depends_on the level of rates and how fast earnings are growing , &quot; he says . Research on the financial markets from 1926 through 1993 by Ibbotson Associates of Chicago supports this assertion . Long-term government_bonds were down 18 of those 68 years . Blue-chip stocks had 20 down periods . But the two fell together in the same year just five times . Perhaps more telling , there have been only two years , 1931 and 1969 , when large stocks and government_bonds fell by more_than 2 % , as they ' re on pace to do for 1994 based on the first_quarter ' s results . If history offers any guide , then one of the two groups is likely to bounce_back , or at least stabilize , over the rest of the year . The above results stay substantially the same even if you substitute small stocks for blue-chips , or corporate_bonds for governments . Ibbotson ' s numbers track unmanaged portfolios of stocks and bonds , so they aren ' t exact proxies for mutual_funds . Yet the data seems clear enough . &quot; Stocks and bonds tend not to move together , &quot; says Keith R . Getsinger , a senior consultant for Ibbotson . He adds , however , that the two asset groups have been moving a bit more in step since the 1970s , even if the numbers quoted above don ' t show it . Getsinger dates this modest convergence to 1979 , when the Federal_Reserve changed its basic inflation-fighting policy in a way that made the bond market more volatile . What all this means for investors is that it still makes_sense to maintain holdings in_stock and bond portfolios , one lousy quarter notwithstanding . Asset-allocation or flexible funds tend to hold such a combination , often with cash , real_estate , gold or foreign securities thrown_in . These funds were off 3 % during the first_quarter , faring better than stocks but worse than bonds , as might be expected . But another hybrid group , the balanced funds , did worse than both , falling 3.3 % on average . Many balanced portfolios got stung because they had fairly large stakes in utility stocks and brand-name companies , two groups that got banged around , says A . Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical . Longer term , he adds , the funds are likely to continue offering compromise performance , somewhere between those of stocks and bonds . Historically , a stock-bond mix has been a good one . &quot; There ' s a reason why pension_funds tend to run about 60 % stocks , 40 % bonds , &quot; says Evans . Based on Ibbotson ' s numbers , a 60-40 split would have made money in every rolling five-year period since 1937-1941 , he says . Balanced and asset-allocation funds tend to maintain a respectable equity exposure most of the time , and their bond holdings provide_for a smoother ride . Each group had a 52 % weighting in_stocks at last count , according to Morningstar Inc. of Chicago . Simply put , a hybrid fund is a good choice for people who can afford only one . But if you have more cash to invest , you might want to build a balanced portfolio by selecting individual stock and bond funds . Few fund families are superior in both the equity and fixed-income sides of the business , so it might pay to shop around . In addition , you can more finely tune a portfolio of two or more funds to better fit your preferences . For example , with a single balanced or asset-allocation fund , the bonds you get are almost always going_to be taxable government , corporate or foreign issues . Yet if you ' re in a high tax_bracket , you might want to use municipals for the fixed-income portion . Many advisers think tax-free bonds offer compelling values at the moment , especially after taking a dive in the first_quarter . * The latest round of mutual_fund openings , closings and additions includes some prominent names . AIM Aggressive Growth , which enjoys above-average marks from the Morningstar and Value Line rating services , plans to shut its doors to new investors after May 2 . Existing shareholders will be able to keep adding money after that date . The Houston-based stock fund ( ( 800 ) 347-1919 ) now counts more_than $ 330 million in assets , roughly 10 times its size of two years ago . It carries a maximum 5.5 % sales charge . Meanwhile , two big no-load portfolios , Mutual Shares and Mutual Qualified , opened_to new investors on April 6 . Despite their large size -- $ 3.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion , respectively -- the funds are finding buying opportunities thanks to the stock_market ' s correction , says management . These funds ( ( 800 ) 553-3014 ) also enjoy good marks from the two rating services . They ' re part of the Mutual Series group in Short Hills , N.J. And New York-based Neuberger &amp; Berman ( ( 800 ) 877-9700 ) has unveiled a Socially Responsive fund . It will seek_out companies with good environmental and workplace records , while avoiding those that earn revenue from alcohol , tobacco , gambling , nuclear_power or weapons . There is no sales charge .
