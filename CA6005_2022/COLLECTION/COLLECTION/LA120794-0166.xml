   <HEADLINE> THE SPEAKERSHIP BATTLE ; HORCHER ' S GOP CONSTITUENTS OUTRAGED AT HIS VOTE FOR BROWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Benedict Arnold , Judas and Assemblyman Paul V . Horcher . Betrayal was the operative sentiment Tuesday around Horcher ' s 60th District in the East San Gabriel Valley , especially among Republicans . They called it treachery for the man they reelected in November to renounce the party and back longtime Democratic Speaker Willie Brown , a political Antichrist for many voters here . &quot; Horcher is a traitor , &quot; said Joe Edwards , a former supporter who took a break from shopping at The Plaza at West Covina to vent his anger . &quot; I wanted Willie Brown out of there and then he votes for him . I feel very much betrayed. &quot; Timothy J . Vrieling , chairman of the local Republican Central Committee , said he has begun organizing a recall drive against Horcher , who declared himself an independent Monday after casting a decisive vote to block the seating of a Republican Speaker . &quot; It ' s a major slap in the face to Republicans , &quot; Vrieling said . &quot; The Republican_Party is what put him in office. &quot; Horcher , a 43-year-old lawyer , has cast himself as a maverick for several years , but his dramatic switch_on the first day of the Assembly session in Sacramento marked a new role . Despite winning reelection Nov . 8 with 61 % of the vote , his political future in the conservative district -- including the communities of Diamond Bar , Hacienda Heights , West Covina and portions of Pomona and Whittier -- now seems virtually comatose . &quot; Horcher seems to have done_it in a way that definitely burns his bridges with his Republican_Party , &quot; said political_scientist Alan Heslop , a professor at Claremont McKenna College . &quot; And he has no roots in the Democratic Party locally . Mr. Horcher has put an end to any political future that he might have had. &quot; While Horcher cited the rightward tilt of the Assembly Republicans for his jump , his suburban district is comfortable in its conservatism . Voters there sided strongly with Republican Mike Huffington over Sen . Dianne Feinstein last month , and endorsed the reelection of Gov . Pete Wilson . In 1992 the voters bucked the Democratic tide and went_for George_Bush over Bill_Clinton , while showing a strong independent streak -- 20 % cast votes for maverick Ross Perot . Ronald Reagan did_well there . Now , authorities in Horcher ' s hometown of Diamond Bar say they are_on alert after the assemblyman reportedly received death threats at his Sacramento office . &quot; Nothing is trustworthy -- nothing is from the heart in politics anymore , &quot; said Sam Longoria , a West Covina resident who voted for Perot in the last presidential election . &quot; They ' ll tell you one thing one moment and do another the next . Politicians like Horcher aren ' t responsive to the people who elected them. &quot; Bert Kramer , a Republican from West Covina , said he felt the betrayal deeply . &quot; I am depressed and very upset , &quot; he said . &quot; I think he ' s done a very immoral thing and I hope he gets what ' s coming_to him. &quot; Local Democrats were far from unanimous in their reaction to Horcher ' s renunciation of his GOP roots . &quot; I say good for him . I ' m sure he did what he thought was right for his constituents , &quot; said Mary Albeen , a Democrat from Rowland Heights . Yet supporters of Democrat Andrew Ramirez , who ran against Horcher in the Nov . 8 election , said they feel their own betrayal because their candidate was spurned by Brown . Ramirez appealed in vain for financial help from the Assembly ' s Democratic Caucus . &quot; Willie ignored him and paid_attention to Paul ( Horcher ) , &quot; said Rickie Santell , a state Democratic Party board_member . &quot; I ' m sickened by the process that allowed this to happen. &quot; Horcher , a moderate who favors abortion rights and has aligned himself with the traditionally Democratic California Trial_Lawyers Assn. , is a battle-scarred veteran of political infighting in the San Gabriel Valley . He was elected to the City_Council in Diamond Bar in 1989 , the year the city incorporated . Within months , council_members voted to strip Horcher of his largely ceremonial title of mayor pro_tem after he accused a councilman of conflict_of_interest . Horcher spent more_than $ 300 # 000 of_his_own money to win a narrow victory in the 1990 primary over seven Republican rivals for the Assembly seat . Last September he mounted a challenge in a special election for an open seat in the state Senate , running with the aid of Democratic groups . Despite the assistance , Horcher finished a distant third behind Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy of Arcadia and Diamond Bar Councilman Gary G . Miller , a wealthy Republican businessman . During that campaign , Horcher sent_out a mailer that chided the conservative Mountjoy for voting to make Brown the Speaker in 1980 . &quot; Paul Horcher has never voted to make Willie Brown speaker , &quot; the mailer bragged . &quot; He should resign , &quot; Miller said Tuesday . &quot; He misrepresented himself to the people . The man has flat smashed a Republican dream. &quot; Caren Daniels-Meade , spokeswoman for the secretary_of_state , said recall elections aimed at state officeholders have been held only four times in California history and have succeeded only twice . The last recall election was in April , when proponents failed to oust state Sen . David Roberti ( D-Van Nuys ) . Horcher , in a statement read Monday , said his new status as an independent would benefit his district , but local leaders did not all see it that way . &quot; I was fearful this would happen , &quot; said Dr. Forest Tennant , a prominent Republican and former mayor of West Covina . &quot; Paul Horcher will no longer be able to represent his district adequately because any bill he carries or takes a lead_on will be despised by people of both parties . I ' m saddened , because this is not going_to help the San Gabriel Valley. &quot; Holguin is a Times staff writer . Winton is a special correspondent . Horcher ' s Home Base Assemblyman Paul Horcher ' s district in the San Gabriel Valley is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats , but it votes conservatively and independently -- not the kind of place where his support for longtime Speaker Willie Brown will win him friends . The district favored George_Bush over Bill_Clinton in 1992 , but 20 % voted for Ross Perot . 60TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT White : 47 % Latino : 30 % Asian American : 17 % African American : 6 % * NOV . 1994 ELECTION Paul Horcher ( R Inc. ) : 61 % Andrew M .
