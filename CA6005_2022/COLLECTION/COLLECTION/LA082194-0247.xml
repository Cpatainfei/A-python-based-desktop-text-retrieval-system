   <HEADLINE> DISCIPLE OF DISCIPLINE ; COACH BILL FITCH HAS REPUTATION AS A TOUGH REBUILDER , AND THAT MAY BE PUT TO TEST WITH CLIPPERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bill Fitch , the Clippers ' new coach , learned discipline from his father , Doc , a former Marine drill_instructor . &quot; I was 14 years old before I found_out I wasn ' t in the Marine Corps , because I lived like a Marine , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; I had nobody to share that razor strap with . I was an only child . There ' s many_a day I would have loved to have had a brother to blame something on. &quot; Fitch , 60 , has applied the lessons of his youth . A stern disciplinarian who motivates through intimidation , he has become the NBA ' s fifth-winningest coach , having compiled a record of 844-878 in 21 seasons . &quot; A lot of times I ' ve had great players that I didn ' t expect to like me and some of them became great players because they didn ' t like me and I would n ' t let them like me , &quot; Fitch said . Still , he is revered by some of his former players . &quot; Bill Fitch saved my life , &quot; said John Lucas , coach of the Philadelphia 76ers . He credits Fitch with helping him recover from a cocaine_addiction . Fitch cut Lucas from the Houston Rockets in 1984 because of Lucas ' drug problem and re-signed him after Lucas had finished rehab in 1985 . &quot; He would n ' t allow me to continue to play when other people wanted me to continue to play basketball when my drug use was up , &quot; Lucas said . &quot; He said , ' No more , John . I don ' t care what anybody else says , I ' m not going_to let you play anymore. ' &quot; To this day I ' m grateful to him . He taught me more as a coach about life and living life on life ' s terms than anybody I ' ve dealt with before . I had some of my best years with him and I didn ' t do_it with points , I did_it with knowledge of the game. &quot; Although some regard Fitch ' s methods as archaic and maintain that the game has passed him by , he coached the Boston Celtics to the 1981 NBA championship and the Rockets to the 1986 NBA finals . &quot; He ' s a very good teacher , &quot; said Celtic President Red Auerbach , who hired Fitch . &quot; He ' s a disciplinarian . that ' s his big asset. &quot; Atlanta Coach Lenny Wilkens , who played for Fitch in Cleveland , agreed . &quot; I don ' t think anybody is more prepared than Bill Fitch , &quot; Wilkens said . &quot; I ' ve played for a lot of coaches and seen a lot of guys work , but I don ' t know that anyone prepares as much or as diligently as he does. &quot; But has he changed with the times ? &quot; Over the years , I didn ' t see him change his style to really accommodate the change in the players in the league , &quot; said Fitch ' s daughter , Lisa , associate women ' s basketball_coach at Wright State University in Dayton , Ohio . And Fitch , who rejuvenated mediocre NBA teams in Cleveland , Boston , Houston and New Jersey , faces what may be his biggest challenge yet , rebuilding the Clippers , who had the NBA ' s seventh-worst record last season . Fitch will be quite a contrast to easygoing Bob Weiss , who was fired with two years left on a three-year contract . Fitch plans to bar reporters from the first three days of training camp , which may feel_like boot camp -- &quot; Anybody who ' s in shape can go_through my camps , but God help ' em if they ' re not &quot; -- so that the players can concentrate . &quot; Fitch is a bottom-line kind of guy , &quot; Clipper captain Gary Grant said . &quot; We need someone to come_in and say , ' This is the way it ' s going_to be . Period. ' He ' ll do that. &quot; Hired by the Clippers after a 73-day search , Fitch signed a four-year contract last month . &quot; He has the kind of credibility in turning teams around we need here , &quot; General_Manager Elgin Baylor said . &quot; He ' s a hard_worker , a disciplinarian . Someone the players will respect. &quot; The Clippers , who made the playoffs twice under former coach Larry Brown , will be starting over under Fitch , who has twice been named the NBA ' s coach of the year . He has a lot of holes to fill before the season opener Nov . 4 against the Portland Trail Blazers in Yokohama , Japan . All-Star forward Dominique Wilkins , the Clippers ' leading scorer last season , signed an $ 11-million , three-year contract with the Celtics last month and disgruntled guard Mark Jackson was traded to the Indiana Pacers for guard Pooh Richardson , forward Malik Sealy and rookie forward Eric Piatkowski . The Clippers could also lose free-agent guard Ron Harper , their second-leading scorer . They are still hoping to re-sign him , however . But the Clippers ' bleak outlook doesn ' t scare Fitch , the ninth coach the club has had since moving here in 1984 . &quot; This isn ' t scary , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; Scary is being the first outsider coach in Boston . Scary is worrying if you ' ll live_up_to the Celtic family . Scary is being the first coach in Cleveland , losing your first 15 games and wondering if you ' ll ever win. &quot; * Fitch thought he would never coach again after resigning under pressure from the New Jersey Nets after the 1992 season . &quot; I had a good ride , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; But I thought I ' d had enough. &quot; Although Fitch led the woeful Nets to their first playoff berth in five seasons , he openly feuded with management after guard Kenny Anderson was drafted over his objections . Minority owner Joe Taub responded by trying to replace Fitch with Jim Valvano in midseason . And the Net players openly revolted against Fitch . All-Star forward Derrick Coleman and guard Chris Morris refused to play in the final week of the season . Fitch didn ' t fine or suspend them because he needed them in the playoffs . He said , however , that the mutiny didn ' t influence his decision to quit . &quot; You have altercations and problems with players from Day 1 , &quot; he said . &quot; If you take 20 married_couples , there isn ' t one of them that doesn ' t have ( arguments ) , but they don ' t have all their arguments with ( reporters ) sitting there . &quot; The same thing went_on 20 years ago , but none of this used to escape . Now you ' re more approachable ( because of increased media access ) . That didn ' t affect me. &quot; He retired to his lakeside home outside Houston , content to fish and play golf while the Nets paid_off the final two years of his contract . Fitch ' s only link to the NBA was his satellite dish . One of the first coaches to use videotape as a scouting tool , Fitch taped every NBA game and broke_down the tapes as if he were still coaching . &quot; The joke back home is that if you ' re lost at night , just look_to the orange cast in the sky with me switching that satellite dish around and you can get your bearings real quick , &quot; Fitch quipped . Fitch , who rejected several European coaching offers , realized how much he missed the sidelines while coaching a team of college players at an NBA pre-draft tournament in Phoenix last spring . &quot; The thing that you can ' t replace is being with a group of guys in competition , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; You can ' t replace that. &quot; Fitch ' s love of competition began on the playground . Born in Davenport , Iowa , he grew_up in Cedar Rapids , where he is remembered as one of the best athletes the city has produced . &quot; I lived right across the street from an elementary_school , which had a gravel football_field , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; We ' d play football on the gravel . In my neighborhood , even a touch_football game turned_into tackle football. &quot; Fitch excelled in basketball and baseball . An all-state guard , he was recruited by Kansas basketball_Coach Phog Allen , but decided to enlist in the Marines in 1950 , after the outbreak of the Korean_War . &quot; I was underage when I enlisted and my dad had the good_fortune to get me out , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; A couple of the guys I was with , one of them came_back a year later with fragments of shrapnel and the other guy never came back. &quot; Returning home , Fitch went_to tiny Coe College in Cedar Rapids , where he played baseball and basketball . Theron Thomsen , former Coe basketball_coach who later gave Fitch his first coaching_job , sensed early on that Fitch would make a good coach . &quot; He had the makings of a coach right from the start , &quot; Thomsen said . &quot; He was a coach on the floor and he knew the game . He was smart and he was always trying to figure_out a better way to do something. &quot; Drafted by the old St . Louis Hawks , Fitch rejected the Hawks ' meager offer to pursue a major_league baseball career . &quot; The bonus would have been a new suit , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; The money was trivial in those days . Ben Kerner was the owner of St . Louis then and I remember him telling me that Bob Harrison , the starting guard on the Minneapolis Lakers championship team , only made $ 3 # 800. &quot; But a two-year Army hitch stalled Fitch ' s baseball career . After he was discharged in 1956 , Fitch followed Thomsen to Creighton , where he was the baseball_coach and an assistant basketball_coach . Fitch coached Hall_of_Fame pitcher Bob Gibson in both sports at Creighton . &quot; Until ( Larry Bird ) came_along , Gibson was the toughest competitor I ever saw , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; If you were flipping coins two out of three and he lost , he was liable to break your thumb. &quot; Fitch left in 1958 to become the basketball_coach at Coe , where he compiled a 44-40 record in four seasons before he was hired by North_Dakota . There he coached Phil Jackson , who won two NBA titles while playing for the Knicks and coached the Chicago Bulls to three consecutive NBA titles . &quot; Basketball was nothing when I went ( to North_Dakota ) , but they had a field_house that was better than what we had at Creighton , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; But it just sat there . It was a warming stop for the people going_to hockey_games . If there was a basketball_game going_on , they ' d watch it and then go_over to hockey. &quot; Fitch tricked some recruits into coming_to frigid North_Dakota . &quot; I ' d go_through the grades when I was recruiting and if they had a low mark in geography I ' d go_after them , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; I ' d tell them that it was cold , but it was a dry cold. &quot; North_Dakota won a total of 24 games in his first two seasons , then the program took_off . Fitch guided the Fighting Sioux to three consecutive 20-win seasons and two trips to the Division II final four before moving_on to Bowling_Green in 1967 . After coaching Bowling_Green to the 1968 Mid-American Conference title , Fitch was hired by the University of Minnesota . He had to live_in Williams Gym for 10 days during his first season when his three daughters caught chickenpox . &quot; I ' d never had chickenpox and it went from one daughter to the next so I didn ' t go home. &quot; Fitch said . &quot; I set_up a cot in the gym and that ' s where I stayed. &quot; Fitch , who had only two losing seasons in 12 years as a college coach , didn ' t get_off to a good start in the NBA as the first coach of the expansion Cleveland Cavaliers in 1970 . The Cavaliers lost their first 15 games and finished with a 15-67 record . &quot; Bill does not like to lose -- none of us do , &quot; Lenny Wilkens said . &quot; But I ' ve never seen anyone take losing as hard as him . It was an expansion team with a lot of kids who didn ' t know their way around the block and it took time . It just wasn ' t going_to happen overnight. &quot; After enduring five consecutive losing seasons , Fitch was named coach of the year in 1976 , after leading the Cavaliers to the Central Division title with a franchise-record 49 victories . Cleveland advanced to the Eastern Conference finals , losing to the Celtics in six games . Fitch resigned on May 21 , 1979 , after the Cavaliers ' first losing season since 1973-74 . Two days later , he was hired by the Celtics , who had won 27 games the previous season . Fitch , who inherited rookie forward Larry Bird in his first season , guided the Celtics to a 61-21 record , the biggest turnaround in NBA history . Boston won the NBA title in his second season . The Celtics appeared to be_on the verge of a dynasty , but Fitch couldn ' t sustain it and resigned under_fire in 1983 after Boston was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs amid reports that the Celtics had rebelled against his coaching methods . Fitch maintains that he quit because owner Harry Mangurian , who had brought him to Boston , sold the Celtics . &quot; What happened was blown_out of proportion , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; There were stories that M.L. Carr threw a ball at me and we got_into a fight . I can still remember the day he threw the ball . It missed me . I turned_around and threw it by his head. &quot; Mangurian concurred . &quot; I decided I was going_to sell the team and he made_up his mind that he was going_to leave , &quot; Mangurian said . &quot; We got_along real well . We had a nice business_relationship and we had a nice personal relationship. &quot; K.C. Jones , who had been Fitch ' s assistant , succeeded him and led Boston to two NBA titles in his first three seasons , the Celtics thriving under Jones ' easygoing style . Fitch was hired in 1983 to rebuild the Rockets , who had won only 14 games the previous season . After winning 29 games in Fitch ' s first season , Houston drafted center Hakeem Olajuwon and won 48 games the following season . Fitch guided the Rockets to the Midwest Division title and a spot in the 1986 NBA finals , where they lost to the Celtics . But Fitch was fired two years later when the Rockets were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Dallas Mavericks . &quot; I ' m a better builder than I am at maintaining because I get more fun out of building , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; After a while , maintaining gets boring because you ' re looking_for things to do and I ' m not good at looking_for things to do. &quot; Fitch seems perfectly suited for the Clippers ' massive rebuilding project . &quot; To me , this is one of the best moves , ( the Clippers ) have made , &quot; Auerbach said . &quot; They finally woke up. &quot;</TEXT>
