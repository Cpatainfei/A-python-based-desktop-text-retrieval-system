   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS : A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : LITERARY FILE ; ' SHADOWLANDS ' REKINDLES INTEREST IN C . S . LEWIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If &quot; Shadowlands &quot; becomes a box-office success , &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; won ' t be the only dinosaur-centered film to make its mark among recent movies . &quot; Shadowlands &quot; is about the brief , late-in-life marriage of American divorcee Joy Davidman Gresham and English writer C . S . ( Clive Staples ) Lewis . Lewis dubbed himself a &quot; dinosaur &quot; and an &quot; Old Western Man &quot; in reference_to his traditional , Christian and literary perspectives . At first glance , this Englishman who died at age 64 the same day as John F . Kennedy may seem a rather snoozy subject for a film . Many people only know Lewis as a children ' s writer : His seven-volume fantasy series &quot; The Chronicles of Narnia &quot; is a perennial favorite . Actually , the stocky , chain-smoking , Belfast-born Anglican defies easy categorization . Schooled in his teens by a private tutor who predicted no great success for his pupil , Lewis went_on to become a Renaissance and Medieval literature professor at both Oxford and Cambridge . Despite his demanding academic schedule , Lewis carved out time to write more_than 50 books , pamphlets and essays . These include poetry , literary_criticism ( &quot; The Oxford History of English Literature in the 16th Century , &quot; &quot; An Experiment in Criticism &quot; ) , the autobiography &quot; Surprised by Joy , &quot; a science-fiction trilogy , a novel about the Cupid and Psyche myth called &quot; Till We Have Faces &quot; and theological works such_as &quot; Mere Christianity , &quot; &quot; The Problem of Pain &quot; and &quot; The Screwtape Letters. &quot; All of these , plus others , are still in print and sell by the thousands in various translations . Lewis ' marriage to Gresham in 1956 came_after years of confirmed bachelorhood . At first largely a &quot; green-card &quot; arrangement to help Gresham and her two sons ( only one is portrayed in the film ) stay in England while she slowly died of cancer , the four-year union ultimately thawed Lewis ' emotions and launched him into the greatest romance of his life . Still , the relative quickness , secrecy and taint of previous divorce attached_to the wedding in England ' s conservative ' 50s society added_to Lewis ' somewhat quixotic reputation . Thanks to his prodigious book output , the writer has become something of a hero to a wide swath of people who admire his blend of brains , faith , poetic spirit and storytelling finesse . As early as 1947 , he was popular enough to rate a Time magazine cover story describing him as &quot; one of a growing band of heretics among modern intellectuals : an intellectual who believes_in God. &quot; Lewis is not without detractors . In his own lifetime , a number of his university colleagues found his unabashed advocacy of Christianity so distasteful that they voted Cecil Day-Lewis ( Daniel Day-Lewis ' father ) into a coveted poetry professorship at Oxford over Lewis largely out of spite . Still , Lewis , or Jack as he was nicknamed , never lacked for talented and supportive friends such_as J.R.R. Tolkien , Owen Barfield and Charles Williams to appreciate his wit , generosity ( he donated most of his book proceeds to charity ) , sensitivity to beauty and roving imagination . The last decade has seen something of a Lewis renaissance . &quot; Shadowlands &quot; has attracted interest in various incarnations as a British television drama and a Tony Award-winning play before it became a film . John Cleese recorded a biting audiocassette rendition of &quot; The Screwtape Letters , &quot; and the BBC has turned_out television versions of a_few of the Narnia books . Several Lewis biographies and an edition of his diary were recently published . There are thriving C . S . Lewis societies replete with monthly journals and meetings in Los Angeles and New York . And the Redlands-based C . S . Lewis Foundation for Higher Education presents triannual conferences in England about the man and his works . Even 30 years after his death , Lewis fans believe that his words wear well . Below , a smattering of Lewisania : All that is not eternal is eternally out of date . -- &quot; The Four Loves &quot; Flippancy . . . is a_thousand miles away from joy ; it deadens , instead of sharpening , the intellect ; and it excites no affection between those who practice it . -- &quot; The Screwtape Letters &quot; Ambition ! We must be careful what we mean by it . If it means the desire to get_ahead of other people -- which is what I think it does mean -- then it is bad . If it means simply wanting to do a thing well , then it is good . It isn ' t wrong for an actor to want to act his part as well as it can possibly be acted , but the wish to have his name in bigger type than the other actors is a bad one . -- &quot; God in the Dock &quot; It is a serious thing to live_in a society of possible gods and goddesses , to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which , if you say it now , you would be strongly tempted to worship , or else a horror and a corruption such_as you now meet , if at all , only in a nightmare . All day long we are , in some degree , helping each other to one or another of these destinations . -- &quot; The Weight of Glory &quot; Courage is not simply one of the virtues , but the form of every virtue at the testing point , which means , at the point of highest reality . A chastity or honesty or mercy which yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions . Pilate was merciful till it became risky . -- &quot; The Screwtape Letters &quot; In reading great literature I become a_thousand men and yet remain myself . Like the night sky in a Greek poem , I see with a_thousand eyes , but it is still I who see . Here , as in worship , in_love , in moral action , and in knowing , I transcend myself ; and am never more myself than when I do . -- &quot; An Experiment in Criticism. &quot;</TEXT>
