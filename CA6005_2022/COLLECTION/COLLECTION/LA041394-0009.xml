   <HEADLINE> HORMONE FOR COWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * I can ' t help but notice that the apologists for recombinant bovine somatotropin don ' t bother to address the issue of desirability or necessity.There is , after all , no shortage of milk . Those cows are out there giving their all and it ' s plenty . They are already overworked -- and now this ! The primary reason for introducing this new production technique is that Monsanto is looking_for big new profits . The senior_vice_president of Monsanto ( letter , April 4 ) forgot to mention that little detail but it is inescapable . There is no need for the cows of America to be tormented in this way -- and besides , there will be consumer resistance , risk or no risk . F . S . RUSSELL Burbank</TEXT>
