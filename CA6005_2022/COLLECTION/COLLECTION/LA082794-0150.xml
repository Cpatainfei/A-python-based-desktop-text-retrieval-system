   <HEADLINE> QUICK LEARNERS MAKE MOST OF RWANDA TREK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They had brought only a_few boxes of food and bandages , but three South County residents who traveled_to war-torn Rwanda found themselves turned_into medics and international relief agency couriers . When Ron Neely and Gary and Carol Kusunoki , members of Calvary Chapel in Rancho Santa Margarita , left two weeks ago , they knew the supplies they carried weren ' t much . Still , they hoped even the little they could give would help orphans in Rwanda ' s devastated villages . But when several international relief agencies in Kigali heard about their mission , they inundated them with supplies that had sat unused in the capital because there were not enough relief workers willing to make the tough trek into Rwanda ' s rural_areas . The threesome ended_up transporting water purifiers , diapers , fresh produce and 100 blankets , along with their few boxes of supplies , to an orphanage 36 miles from Kigali . &quot; I now know first-hand that we can do something . Every person can get involved , &quot; said Neely , 36 , a Lake Forest resident and the director of Safe_Harbor International , a relief organization run_by Calvary Chapel . &quot; But for each orphan we were able to help , there are 100 more we could not reach. &quot; After briefly lifting the spirits of the 120 undernourished children of the Kayonza orphanage with songs and hugs , the Safe_Harbor members now hope to help the orphanage on a permanent basis . They plan to build additional rooms at the orphanage , send a medical team to treat the children and bring_in bunk_beds , clothing and more food , they said Friday after returning from their five-day trip . Gary Kusunoki , 35 , a Laguna Hills resident who is the Calvary Chapel pastor , said it is hard to forget the sight of corpses beside the road and dozens of flies buzzing about the children ' s faces as they sat inert , too exhausted to swat them away . &quot; If they don ' t get help soon , they will die , &quot; he said of the infants , toddlers and adolescents who broke_into smiles and laughs when the Americans fed and held them . &quot; It ' s a cold , hard fact that when we return , some of them won ' t be there anymore. &quot; * Carol Kusunoki , 34 , said the filth of the restrooms and water_supplies shocked her and made her realize that Safe_Harbor could not end its relief mission with just a five-day trip . Safe_Harbor plans to send a team of volunteer doctors and nurses to Kayonza in October . Although the three travelers were only prepared to treat minor wounds , they ended_up setting broken bones themselves by following telephone instructions from doctors in a distant city . The three said they are happy to be home , where they can eat food other_than cold Army rations , take hot showers , and hug their own children , who stayed home for this trip but say they want to go next time to meet the Rwandan orphans . &quot; The trip has given us a greater appreciation for the blessings we have here , &quot; Gary Kusunoki said . &quot; The most encouraging thing was being able to do so_much for the kids . But the frustrating thing was leaving so_much more undone. &quot;</TEXT>
