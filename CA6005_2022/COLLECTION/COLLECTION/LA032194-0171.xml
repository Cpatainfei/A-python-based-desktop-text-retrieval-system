   <HEADLINE> INTERNAL NATIVE_AMERICAN DISPUTES STALL KOLL PROJECT ; ARCHEOLOGY : DEVELOPERS SAY THEY DID EVERYTHING RIGHT IN PLAN TO BUILD 4 # 286 HOMES NEAR BOLSA CHICA WETLANDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Koll Real_Estate Group thought it had done everything right . Almost from the beginning of its effort to construct 4 # 286 homes near the Bolsa Chica wetlands , the company had followed state recommendations by employing a Native_American to monitor the site in case workers stumbled on an ancient burial_ground or uncovered artifacts . Later , about the time that Native_American bone fragments were discovered , Koll contacted leaders of the two Orange County bands -- the Juanenos and the Gabrielinos -- to make_sure that each group could participate in preserving its heritage by designating separate monitors for the project . And recently company officials organized a gathering of the six people designated by the California Native Heritage Commission as the &quot; most likely descendants &quot; of the individuals whose remains had been found . The purpose : to hear their recommendations regarding the bones ' disposition . Yet , despite its stated good intentions , Koll today is embroiled in a controversy that has stalled the project . So far there have been two Native_American demonstrations protesting the work . And the Huntington Beach City_Council recently voted to ask the Orange County Grand_Jury to investigate whether the handling of the bones was legal . Frustrated , Koll officials are trying to figure_out what went askew . They deny any wrongdoing . Yet they have been caught in the middle of a slew of age-old conflicts among Native_Americans involving territory , tribal status and fierce competition for monitoring jobs that pay $ 200 to $ 300 a day . Central to the dispute is the location of Bolsa Chica , to which two bands of Native_Americans lay claim . To be sure , there are serious questions regarding the handling of the bones . A report compiled by Councilman Ralph Bauer contains , among other things , eyewitness accounts suggesting that human remains may have been found at the site much earlier than Koll has admitted . Further , Bauer has records indicating that the find may_not have been reported to the coroner ' s office quickly enough to satisfy the law . Company officials have steadfastly denied any error . Among those clamoring for the investigation , however , were Native_Americans angry at the developer for a different reason altogether : They said the company had left them out of the loop by dealing with the wrong Native_Americans . &quot; This is war , &quot; said Jim Velasques , chief of a group called the coastal Gabrielinos . &quot; There ' ll be no more messing around. &quot; Said archeologist Patricia Martz of the Bolsa Chica controversy : &quot; It ' s a pretty typical situation. &quot; Martz , an archeologist on the faculty of Cal State Los Angeles and head of the state historical resources commission , said she had seen similar situations up and down the state . &quot; It ' s only human nature , &quot; she said . Native_Americans &quot; are not getting their share of the American_dream and they were the first Americans . It ' s sad , really , &quot; she said . Protecting their heritage &quot; is the only empowerment they have right now. &quot; Velasques put it into economic terms . &quot; Archeology is a gold mine , &quot; he said . &quot; Native_Americans can make money hand_over fist. &quot; It isn ' t the first time such issues have been thrust under the noses of Orange County developers . Five years ago , Velasques himself was being paid $ 35 an hour -- $ 10 of it for a leased pickup_truck and cellular_phone -- to act_as a full time monitor for the Irvine Co . on its Newport Coast construction project . A group calling itself the Native_American Coalition of Southern California threatened to stage a demonstration protesting the alleged mishandling of human remains . One of its major concerns , said the coalition -- whose members included David Belardes , a Juaneno , and Vera Rocha , founder of a separate Gabrielino group -- was the selection of Velasques to represent the Gabrielinos . &quot; I think what we had was a difference_of_opinion among different people who represented themselves as Gabrielinos , &quot; recalls Bernard Maniscalco , who oversaw the project for the Irvine Co . After weeks of negotiations , the company hit on a solution : hire the opposition as well . Members of both the Belardes and Rocha families were given full-time jobs as archeological field assistants on the project , working with Velasques . And almost immediately , the problem disappeared . &quot; It was miscommunication , &quot; Maniscalco says now . &quot; Hiring representatives of both families helped to provide_for better communication all around. &quot; Officials of the Koll company say that they too tried hard to hire the correct representatives of the Native_Americans for Bolsa Chica . Back in 1992 , they say , following the advice of the California Native_American Heritage Commission , the company contacted designated representatives of both the Juaneno and Gabrielino bands to get their recommendations regarding Native_American monitors . Speaking_for the Juanenos was Belardes . Representing the Gabrielinos was Cindi Alvitre , then chairwoman of the Gabrielino / Tongva Tribal Council . What followed was a three-month correspondence between Koll and Alvitre that seemed to start with good intentions , but unraveled altogether in the end . Initially , the subject was monitors ; Alvitre approved the hiring of an interim monitor to serve on a temporary basis until permanent monitors -- including two Gabrielinos -- could be selected . Next , the company asked her to sign an agreement on behalf of her band under which any remains found would be reburied with full Native_American participation at another site near the wetlands . It was during negotiations on this issue that Alvitre made the request that ultimately proved fatal to the discussions : she asked_for $ 4 # 800 from the company to pay_for four Native_American shamans -- religious_leaders -- to visit the site for four days . Koll officials balked , saying that while they were willing to make the site available to the shamans for one day , they were not willing to pay_for the visit . Alvitre wrote back rejecting the offer and negotiations broke_down . &quot; What we have here is a shakedown , &quot; Velasques later said of Alvitre ' s request . Alvitre , who has since resigned from the tribal council and formed a separate group , did not return several calls . During the recent meeting with a Koll official and other Native_Americans to discuss the disposition of the bones , however , she defended her request as both reasonable and necessary . &quot; I didn ' t feel it was inappropriate , &quot; she is quoted as saying in a transcript supplied by the company . &quot; Many of these medicine people I was going_to bring_out . . . are_on fixed incomes . . . . We ' re not being reimbursed or compensated for any of this . . . . It ' s not a financial endeavor . . . not an exploitive type of thing. &quot; Eventually the Koll organization hired three Native_American monitors for the project -- a member of the Luiseno band , a Juaneno and a Gabrielino whose standing later was challenged by Alvitre and others . But while the Bolsa Chica controversy has heated_up in the last couple of years , such tribal challenges and conflicts go_back centuries . Historically , most archeologists agree , the Gabrielinos occupied the territory north of Aliso Creek -- in what is now South Laguna -- while the Juanenos were_on the land to the south , principally around what would become San Juan Capistrano . Juanenos , however , now cite what they describe as a longstanding agreement between the two bands under which , on political matters , they represent Orange County and the Gabrielinos represent Los Angeles County , an assertion the Gabrielinos dispute . And in recent years at least four separate Gabrielino groups have emerged , each claiming to truly represent the band . It is Gabrielino factionalism , in fact , that provides much of the fuel for the present debate . Velasques , chief of a Santa Ana-based group called the Local Coastal Gabrielino Tribal Council , says he represents 500 Native_Americans and is the true spokesman for the Orange County Gabrielinos . Martin Alcala , current chairman of the Gabrielino / -Tongva Tribal Council based in Marina del Rey , claims that his group is the sole legitimate voice of Gabrielinos . And both Alvitre and Rocha have broken_off to form their own separate Gabrielino groups . The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Riverside makes no formal distinctions between the various groups of Gabrielinos , according to tribal operations officer Frances Muncy . Upon request , she said , the bureau will document an individual ' s family heritage and issue a certificate attesting to tribal affiliation and degree of Native_American blood . And in designating the most likely descendants for a particular archeological dig , the California Native_American Heritage Commission plays no favorites , preferring instead to stay out of jurisdictional disputes , said Larry Myers , executive_secretary . &quot; Sometimes it is extremely difficult to determine who represents which group , &quot; Myers said . &quot; I don ' t really want to get caught in an argument over who ' s a real Indian ; we accept ( people ' s claims ) at face value. &quot; As a result , the field is wide open for competition and backbiting among various tribal groups . Just last month , in fact , Velasques stood_up at a Huntington Beach City_Council meeting to publicly blast Native_Americans who accept money to oversee the disinterment of their ancestors ' bones . &quot; If that was my mother ' s bones , &quot; he said , &quot; I promise you that no one would have to grease my palms to be out there watching . If you have to pay them , you own them. &quot; Yet , in addition to serving as full time paid monitor for the Irvine Company from 1988 to 1991 , Velasques last year applied for -- but did not get -- a similar job on a project at Loyola Marymount University in Westchester . And as recently as last November , Koll officials say , he made an offer -- which the company refused -- to provide an archeological &quot; peer_review &quot; of the Bolsa Chica project for a fee of $ 3 # 000 . &quot; He said he would n ' t even have to visit the site , &quot; Susan Hori , a lawyer representing the company , recalled . &quot; He assured me that everything was going fine on site and that if we hired him it would resolve any potential problems with the Gabrielinos. &quot; Velasques confirmed that he had made such an offer , adding that a simple conversation with the archeologist involved in the project would have made a site_visit unnecessary . &quot; I just wanted them to tell me what they were doing , &quot; he said . Had the Koll company been willing to negotiate separate deals with him and with the various other Gabrielino factions , Velasques said , &quot; they could have laid the thing to rest. &quot; All of which leaves Koll officials shaking their heads . &quot; You try to go_through things like the tribal councils and end_up getting caught in a lot of personal battles between individuals , &quot; Hori said . &quot; There seem be a lot of power struggles and you end_up getting caught in the middle. &quot;</TEXT>
