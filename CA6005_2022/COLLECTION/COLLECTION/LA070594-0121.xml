   <HEADLINE> VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW : EXXON TO ELIMINATE 45 JOBS ; UNOCAL MAY SELL OIL , GAS SITES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At least 45 Ventura County oil_industry jobs will be lost and the fate of more_than 200 others is uncertain as a result of actions either planned or under_consideration by two major petroleum firms . The news comes as a blow to the county ' s stagnant oil_industry , which has seen its payrolls reduced by more_than one-third in the past decade . Exxon Co . USA , the domestic arm of Exxon Corp. , will eliminate 45 of the 125 positions at its production control offices in Thousand Oaks by Sept . 1 . The move is part of a consolidation that will eliminate about 430 jobs nationwide . Some of the planners , engineers and others affected by the consolidation will be offered a chance to transfer to Exxon USA headquarters in Houston , company spokesman Les Rogers reports . Others will be offered early retirement , he said , &quot; but ultimately , I ' m afraid , some will have to be laid off. &quot; The move will leave 80 people working in the Exxon USA offices on Hillcrest Drive . The unit mostly administers offshore oil and gas production in the Santa Barbara Channel . In the other development , Unocal Corp. , which was founded in Santa Paula in 1890 , said it has received three unsolicited offers for its oil and gas production properties in Ventura County and throughout California . The company hasn ' t decided whether it will accept the offers and doesn ' t know whether any of its Ventura County employees would be affected , spokeswoman Janet McClintock says . Unocal , now based in Los Angeles , employs 245 people in Ventura County and 136 in Santa Barbara County . &quot; All of the potential buyers would need production personnel in Ventura County , &quot; McClintock said . &quot; We assume it would be in their interest to continue with all or most of the Unocal people who are already there. &quot; In addition to its division office on Knoll Drive_in Ventura , Unocal operates seven offshore platforms in the region and has producing fields in the east county . &quot; Production properties in Ventura County and in California in_general are mostly mature , &quot; McClintock said . &quot; If the properties are sold , we might use the proceeds for exploration and production in southeast_Asia and the Gulf of Mexico. &quot; Oil_industry employment in Ventura County has been lackluster in recent years . It fell from 3 # 300 in 1985 to 2 # 200 in 1990 and 2 # 100 in 1993 , according to the state Employment Development Department . In addition to Exxon , such major producers as Texaco , Chevron , Mobil and Shell have either shut_down or pared their activities in the county since the early 1980s .</TEXT>
