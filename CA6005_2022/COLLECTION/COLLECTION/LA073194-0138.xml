   <HEADLINE> THEATER / COMMENTARY ; WHEN A PLAY TRANSCENDS ETHNICITY ; ' THE SISTERS ROSENSWEIG ' REACHES BEYOND ITS ETHNIC ROOTS . HOW DOES WENDY WASSERSTEIN MAKE IT HAPPEN , AND WHY DOES IT WORK ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In New York there is a saying : Only three kinds of people go_to the theater -- Jews , homosexuals and Jewish homosexuals . Clearly this is not literally true , but it does acknowledge that commercial theater has traditionally catered to a specific audience . These two ( or three ) groups are not only avid theatergoers , but they also write and are the subject of more_than a representative share of commercial hits , from works by Arthur Miller to Herb Gardner to Tony Kushner to Wendy Wasserstein . This raises an interesting question : At what point do playwrights transcend the concerns of their communities , particularly when those communities routinely support the theater ? Many of the so-called AIDS plays , for instance , speak_to audiences largely untouched by the disease . Some do not . For example , David Drake ' s 1992 one-man show about growing_up gay , &quot; The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me &quot; ( brought_to the Tiffany Theatre last year ) , struck this critic as parochial and self-congratulatory . But it attracted an enthusiastic following that needed to hear what it had to say . Far less exclusionary was William Finn ' s &quot; Falsettos &quot; ( 1992 ) , which reached both a gay audience and a straight audience that could , for whatever reason , translate a character ' s death from AIDS into any number of different kinds of losses . There is no doubt that Wendy Wasserstein ' s rueful 1992 comedy &quot; The Sisters Rosensweig , &quot; making its L.A. premiere at the Doolittle Theatre , flatters a Jewish audience that enjoys seeing itself portrayed on the stage . One character , a furrier named Merv , pours himself a large Scotch while speculating on the cliche that Jews don ' t drink . &quot; It ' s a myth , &quot; he muses , &quot; made_up by our mothers to persuade innocent women that Jewish men make superior husbands. &quot; The line has drawn howls from all three audiences with whom I ' ve seen the play ; it ' s the howl of recognition and pleasure that punctuates most of the evening . But Wasserstein ' s play , modeled after the well-made Broadway comedies the author saw as a girl in the late ' 50s and early ' 60s , goes well beyond its own joking attention to Jewish concerns , and beyond many of the popular comedies that inspired it . &quot; The Sisters Rosensweig &quot; may be a polished drawing-room comedy , but it is also a play about loss of identity , Jewish or otherwise , and it is especially rich when it touches_on the painful process of reconnection . The play tells the story of three sisters : Pfeni ( Joan McMurtrey ) , the strangely passive travel writer in_love with Geoffrey ( Richard Frank ) , a theater director whose bisexuality doesn ' t seem to trouble her ; Gorgeous ( Caroline Aaron ) , who favors fake Chanel suits and words like funsy and who is utterly aware of the cliched Jewish housewife people see when they look_at her , and Sara Goode , whose story this really is . Sara ( in a lovely performance by Mariette Hartley ) is a Brooklyn-born Jew who has assimilated seemingly beyond recall ; note her mastery of the_British pronunciation of the word schedule . Twice divorced , she heads an international bank and lives in stylish , if goyish , splendor in London ' s Queen Anne ' s Gate . Aside from the small matter of a husband , Sara appears to have it all . But when her sisters show_up for her 54th birthday , it becomes clear that Sara , the oldest and apparently most stable of the sisters Rosensweig , has forgotten who she is . For one thing , Sara is dating a Nazi named Nick Pym ( Ian Stuart ) . At least , that ' s how Gorgeous sees it . Nick is actually only a former Thatcher MP , with an alarming habit of asking questions like &quot; So many Jewish American men wear those shirts . Why is that ? &quot; Somewhat more left-leaning , Sara ' s daughter Tess ( Debra Eisenstadt ) is threatening to join her boyfriend ( Barry McEvoy ) as a Lithuanian freedom fighter . In the meantime , though , she is studying a recording her mother made as a Radcliffe undergrad with her singing group , the Cliffe Clefs . Tess is captivated by the younger , softer Sara she hears there , a woman who felt free enough to sing in public . But Sara has become , according to Gorgeous , &quot; a hard woman. &quot; And Sara is particularly hard with Gorgeous . With her faux Louis Vuitton bag and penchant for Yiddishisms , Gorgeous is Sara ' s most vivid reminder that she is , in fact , Jewish and she once was something less finished than the brilliant success we see now . On this particular weekend , Sara is besieged by her roots . Gorgeous insists on putting a schmata on her head and reciting the Sabbath prayer . ( Sara forces Pfeni , the youngest sister , to blow_out the ceremonial candles that Gorgeous has just lit. ) But worst of all is the appearance of Geoffrey ' s friend Merv ( Charles Cioffi ) , the furrier who comes_to dinner and will not take no for an answer . To Sara , Merv is declasse and pushy . He brings_up the Holocaust immediately upon entering a dinner_party . His presence puts Nick Pym -- and his Hitlerite mustache -- in stark relief . Sara would be shocked to know what the audience senses immediately -- Merv the furrier is exactly what Sara needs . In their brief courtship , Merv croons along with Sinatra to &quot; Just the Way You Look Tonight. &quot; When it ' s Sara ' s turn , she refuses . &quot; I just can ' t sing for you , Merv , &quot; she says , a little regretfully . But there is hope : She can sleep_with him . Later , Sara listens to the Cliffe Clefs record that fascinates Tess . Riveted by the sound of_her_own 18-year-old voice singing &quot; McNamara ' s Band , &quot; she sinks into a deeply buried memory ( a moment aided immeasurably by Pat Collins ' shadowy lighting ) . Sara refinds a part of herself that is very far away . She begins to sing a Yiddish-ized version of &quot; McNamara ' s Band , &quot; a version she must have learned long before Radcliffe , before she knew to be ashamed . The audience at first laughs_at the strange sounds coming_out of the mouth of Sara Goode . But the laughter turns almost immediately into a kind of awe -- here is the mysterious , essential act of reconnection . * Critics sometimes accuse Wasserstein of being glib , in the way they complain that Neil Simon sacrifices character development for gags . Certainly Wasserstein ' s characters are clever ; often they can ' t resist cracking jokes . This is a comedy , however rueful , and in a comedy it helps to have witty characters . For me , though , the play suffers from self-consciousness in its more serious vein , specifically when it pays tribute to Chekhov . With the three sisters gathered on the sofa ( one of them brings_up a samovar at this point ) , the talk turns_to what they wish for . &quot; That each of us can say at some point that we had a moment of pure , unadulterated happiness ! Do you think that ' s possible , Sara ? &quot; asks Gorgeous , in an uncharacteristically poetical mode . The moment curdles ; it ' s an emotion that should have been conveyed to us and not force-fed . But a little overwriting notwithstanding , &quot; The Sisters Rosensweig , &quot; is a breakthrough play for Wasserstein . Earlier this year I interviewed the playwright for the Paris Review , and we talked_about her youthful tendency , along with other writers developed at Playwrights Horizons in the late ' 70s , to write plays made_up of episodes , ending in blackouts . &quot; I guess you could say we were the first generation who grew_up watching television and going_to the theater , &quot; she said , noting that she , Christopher Durang , William Finn and others were breaking form from the generation before , playwrights like Lanford Wilson and John Guare , who were all breaking form too , from Edward Albee and Arthur Miller . Wasserstein recalled that , while serving on a committee at the Yale School of Drama , she spoke_to a young directing student whose desire was to &quot; explode text. &quot; &quot; I thought_of Miss Julie exploding over the Yale School of Drama saying , ' There goes the Seagull ! ' &quot; Wasserstein said . &quot; And I thought , ' Well , before you explode it you should know how to do it. ' And I thought I would just like to try to do this because in fact playwriting is like making stained glass . If it is becoming a more and more obscure craft , then it would be interesting to know how to master that craft , and I would like to try and do it. &quot; Wasserstein clearly was shooting_for something more ambitious in her 1988 play &quot; The Heidi Chronicles. &quot; But it was the classic structure of &quot; The Sisters Rosensweig &quot; that freed Wasserstein to write her most moving scene yet . * Why is it so powerful to see a character reconnect with a younger self , particularly on the stage ? It currently happens every night at the Universal Amphitheatre when the title character in &quot; The Who ' s Tommy &quot; gazes in a mirror . I am still haunted by a scene at the end of Caryl Churchill ' s 1979 play &quot; Cloud Nine , &quot; in which an older_woman embraces her younger self . That the younger_woman was the ridiculously sheltered wife of a British colonialist and was played by a man made the moment no less moving . There ' s always something disturbing about a Jew who ' s embarrassed by Jewish things , or any comparable denial of the imperfections of the self . That embarrassment signals a disassociation , a jangled note , a tension we all know in one way or another . The embrace of self -- in &quot; Cloud Nine &quot; it was a literal one ; in &quot; The Sisters Rosensweig &quot; it occurs when a woman sitting in a chair sings to herself -- offers relief , release , the admitting of a painful truth . It ' s an archetypal moment , a primal moment , a moment when a person forgives himself for everything he has failed to become . It ' s a transcendent moment . It allows_for possibility . It only happens once in a great while . And it ' s happening right now onstage at the Doolittle Theatre . * &quot; The Sisters Rosensweig , &quot; Doolittle Theatre , 1615 N . Vine St. , Hollywood , ( 213 ) 365-3500 or ( 714 ) 740-2000 ) .
