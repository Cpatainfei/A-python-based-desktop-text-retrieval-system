   <HEADLINE> 15TH ANNUAL LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZES ; WINNER : GEORGE CHAUNCEY ' GAY NEW YORK ' ; OUT OF THE CLOSET , INTO THE CITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> George Chauncey maps a topography that historians and others have long found inaccessible : that of the gay male world from the 1890s to the 1930s . Centered_on New York , his map guides us through restaurants , clubs , bathhouses , parks and streets where gays lived a public life , at times interacting , and on occasion coexisting , with the mainstream &quot; outside &quot; culture . The &quot; public &quot; life of gay New York is in this context public only in certain specific circumstances . Still , from a highly distinctive appearance and behavior in 1900 , gay culture grew -- with expanding confidence and effervescence -- to animate numerous New York scenes . The celebration reached its apex in the gay ' 20s . Gays during Prohibition &quot; acquired unprecedented prominence , &quot; Chauncey observes , and as &quot; the ' pansy craze ' swept_through New York , they became the subject of newspaper_headlines , Broadway dramas , films , and novels . . . The drag balls . . . attracted thousands of spectators and the nightclubs where they performed became the most popular in the city. &quot; The speak-easies blurred legal and moral boundaries for the middle_class , and the gay party bloomed in this expanding demimonde . By 1931 , curious tourists were &quot; advised &quot; by Vanity_Fair and the tabloids to hang_around Times Square and have their picture taken with pansies , while Harlem was attracting domestic tourism from the_like of the Astors and the Vanderbilts together with numerous middle-class gawkers . In the next few years , the party moved to mid-town , and when the Pansy Club opened in Times Square , it featured Karyl Norman , heading &quot; Pansies on Parade. &quot; The advertisement billed the show as &quot; something different. &quot; Chauncey not only splendidly re-creates this little-known chapter of New York history , but also produces an exquisite story , combining extensive original historical research with captivating narrative passages . His material is primarily drawn from court trials , the papers of the Manhattan district_attorney , of the city magistrates ' courts and other governmental regulators , as well as various committees of harassment such_as the records of the anti-prostitution society and the Society for the Suppression of Vice . Given such an ample record of repression , arrests , investigations , and trials for sodomy and prostitution , it no doubt must have been tempting for Chauncey to compose a persecution story . After all , the philosopher Michel Foucault achieved his immense contribution to the history of sexuality by highlighting the discursive network ( penal_codes , institutions , politics and cultural condemnation ) which society constructed in_order to control this and other &quot; deviant &quot; behavior . Before the ' 60s , few outside the medical Establishment and various disciplinary and penal_institutions had written_about sexuality at all . What gives &quot; Gay New York &quot; its excitement and appeal , then , is Chauncey ' s ability to transform these narratives of persecution into an often affirmative tale . In Chauncey ' s interviews , the gay_men who lived through the pre-repression period describe gay New York early in this century as the good old times . Through these interviews , the streets and clubs of Harlem , the Village , Uptown , Broadway and Times Square come_alive as scenes of gay life in a period when the homosexuals supposedly existed only in the closet . The celebration of the drag-queen in the good old days before repression is told in vivid colors , highlighting the pleasure and the playfulness , even when the images depict arrest and harassment . The tone only changes in the last chapter , which briefly describes &quot; the exclusion of homosexuality from the public sphere in the 1930s. &quot; On the page preceding this chapter , a picture ( 1940 , at right ) depicts a glowing drag queen emerging from a police_van , posing for the camera . The juxtaposition -- of the picture and the text , of the celebration and the repression -- is illuminating . Victimization , as Chauncey shows here , can also be subverted into cultural and political resistance . Homosexuals , although persecuted during those years , were able to create a temporary enclave that shielded them and much of their culture from harassment . It is Chauncey ' s celebration of this ambivalent space between victimization and self-affirmation that has great significance for contemporary understanding of culture , as well as for the relationship of different groups , including ethnic and racial minorities , among themselves as well as with the state . How large was the male gay community in New York ? The University of Chicago study of current American sexual practices that was released last month suggests that the &quot; traditional &quot; figure accepted by gays -- 10 % -- may characterize only urban_areas . Reading this story , one gets the impression that this was a &quot; weighted &quot; 10 % : gays had a cultural impact on the city far greater than their numbers . But Chauncey makes an even more compelling claim : The boundaries of homo- and hetero-sexuality are highly culturally specific . Not only was homosexuality being defined during this period -- so too was heterosexuality , which Chauncey believes emerged from a mainstream cultural defense of the male sphere against &quot; the overcivilization and feminization of American men. &quot; The middle-class Angst of masculinity did not invent the fairy , but it did turn the fairy into a &quot; potent cultural figure ( that ) could serve to mark the boundaries of acceptable male behavior. &quot; However counterintuitive , this argument is persuasive when backed by such rich evidence and engaging narrative . Thus Chauncey ' s story reminds us in a powerful way that contemporary prejudices -- notwithstanding their seemingly eternal , natural , or obvious nature -- are anything but permanent .
