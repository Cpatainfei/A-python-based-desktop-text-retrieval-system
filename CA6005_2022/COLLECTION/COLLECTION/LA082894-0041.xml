   <HEADLINE> SEARCHING FOR NGUYEN TAN HUNG ; FOR THE DAUGHTER OF A SOUTH VIETNAMESE ARMY CAPTAIN MISSING IN ACTION , THE HARDEST PART IS NEVER KNOWING . OR IS IT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The military cemetery here in Bien Hoa was once known for the two rows of graceful willows that swayed gently in the breeze . During the Vietnam_War , when this small_town was the headquarters of the South Vietnamese army , sentimental visitors would wax poetic about the willows crying in tribute to the heroic soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the name of democracy . In those days , the graves marched in precise white_lines through carefully tended grass . Flowers and incense sticks decorated the grave sites . A shrine -- an imposing slate monument depicting a tired soldier whose M-16 automatic_rifle rests_on his lap -- greeted visitors at the entrance . In the early ' 70s , my mother came often to this cemetery , a half-hour ' s drive north of Saigon . She walked among the headstones , reading their inscriptions , looking_for the name of her husband , my father -- Nguyen Tan Hung , a captain in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam -- who had been reported missing in action in 1972 in the Central Highlands . She came here just in case the army had made a mistake and somehow buried him without informing her . Once a monument to patriotism and to the fallen heroes who had fought against the Communists of North Vietnam , the Military Cemetery of the Republic of Vietnam is a wasteland today . Most of the willows are gone , the slate shrine destroyed . The endless rows of tombstones are overrun_with wild grass and tangled , thorny shrubs . The gray and white headstones have been defaced , overturned , some urinated upon . Like my mother , I , too , have come here , tracing the rows of graves , trying to find_out what happened to my father . Like her , I find no answers , and the one clue the ruins yield about my father ' s fate is hardly bearable : Here , in the land that he fought for , Father is not simply missing and presumed dead , he is despised , and even worse , forgotten . MY NAME IS NGUYEN TAN BANG PHUONG . I AM THE eldest daughter of Le Xuan Hao and Capt . Hung . But I am also Lily Dizon , adopted daughter of Alejandro Dizon , a former American civil_service employee who married my mom and raised her four children as his own . In April , 1975 , as Saigon fell , my mother , my two brothers and my sister and I were airlifted out of the chaos to a refugee camp in Guam and finally to a new life in Louisiana . We left_behind a crumbling nation , scores of relatives and my mother ' s long , frustrating search for information regarding my father . At the end of that year , she put the past behind her and remarried so that her children could grow_up in a stable family . Nineteen years later , prompted by a reporter ' s curiosity and a daughter ' s duty and fortified with my second father ' s encouragement and my mother ' s blessing , I decided to take_up the search again . I began where my memories ended . I knew my father ' s face from photographs and a little_girl ' s blurry memories . I remembered a man dressed always in fatigues , who was often away from our home_in Qui Nhon , on South Vietnam ' s central coast , off fighting the Communists , the &quot; red_devils &quot; trying to take_over our country . I remembered being carried_on his shoulders ; I remembered the life-sized doll he brought me when he returned from training in America ; I remembered him , not the maid , sweeping the floor -- &quot; No one can sweep it as well as I can , &quot; he would explain to me as he went_about the task . Most vividly , I remembered a seemingly forgettable scene : It was in the evening . Father was carrying me in his arms when he suddenly asked me how old I was . I proudly held_up six fingers . &quot; No , my daughter , &quot; he laughed , mussing my hair . &quot; You ' re 5. &quot; Years later , I asked Mom why this bit of banter would stick_in my mind . It was March 8 , 1972 , she told me , and I had turned 5 that day : &quot; We went_out for dinner to celebrate . Your father left the next day to report to duty , and he never came back. &quot; She didn ' t have to remind me what happened next . The morning he left , Father insisted on taking family photographs . &quot; I want to engrave your faces on my heart and mind , &quot; Mom remembers him saying , &quot; just in case. &quot; He had gone_to combat many times before , she says , but never with such foreboding words . A month later , Father called from Fire Base Tan Canh , near the Laos and Cambodia border , to say that he would be delayed . A bridge had been blown_up and reinforcements were late . He said he ' d be home by April 22 . On the 24th , there were six or seven military Jeeps parked in front of our house when Mom came_home from her job at an American supply base . She rushed into the house , where a number of officers were sitting or pacing . When she didn ' t see Father , she brushed by them . He was playing hide-and-seek , she thought , as he had done so many times before . But an officer asked her to sit_down . The maid ushered me and my siblings into the kitchen and closed the door . I cracked it open and peeked . A lieutenant_colonel began by saying he didn ' t want to be there , but Mom covered her ears , ran to the kitchen door and opened it to face her bewildered children . In the background , the lieutenant_colonel tried again : Enemy forces had overrun Tan Canh and the whereabouts of my father were unknown . &quot; It ' s not just Capt . Hung but the whole division that has been reported mat tich , &quot; he said . &quot; Mat tich , &quot; Mom repeated numbly , puzzled . It was the first time she had ever heard that term -- &quot; missing in action. &quot; &quot; So Hung is not dead ? &quot; We don ' t know , the man repeated . We have no more news . The officers left . My mother began to cry , and so did my 3-year-old brother . My 2-year-old brother tugged at my hand . I bit my lip as Mom clutched my baby sister to her heart . She was 24 the day she lost her husband . He was 31 . Later , Mom abandoned friends who came_to console her and took the four of us to the beach . We walked barefoot on the sand , held hands and closed our eyes as Mom offered_up what must have been the first of thousands of prayers . She appealed_to the_Buddha , to God , to the genies of the land and the spirits of our ancestors to bring Father home safely . MY PLANE LANDS IN THE NEW VIETNAM IN APRIL , 1994 , AND MY OLD HOMETOWN of Saigon ( no one calls it Ho Chi Minh City ) is in the midst of a suffocating tropical spring heat_wave . It is 22 years to the month that my father disappeared ; 19 years , again to the month , that I left this land . I have a one-month visa and boundless hope . Every day for two months , I have been studying military histories and journalistic accounts of the battle at Tan Canh ; I have even interviewed two of its survivors , now living_in San Jose . ( &quot; I didn ' t know your father , &quot; they each tell me , though one of them can hardly stand to disappoint me . In the mess_hall , he tells me , &quot; we must have laughed together at funny American movies , your father and I . I know we must have at least once shared a beer. &quot; ) And I have written letters -- my mother painstakingly translating my queries into Vietnamese , a language I can speak fluently but have difficulty writing -- to a multitude of diplomats and bureaucrats . It is my hope that they will help me in my search , perhaps even open their files and allow me to see what my mother never saw -- ARVN military records , or better yet , the archives relating to the North ' s Vietnamese POWs . After all , the war is long over ; perhaps I can reap some benefit from the long and controversial attempts to finally heal its wounds . In Saigon , Huynh Duong Chinh , a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , tells me he admires me for my sense of filial_duty and my journalistic desire to call attention to Vietnamese MIAs , who have so often been left_out of the MIA debate in the United States . I meet with Chinh for three days , and he sends me on to Hanoi , and foreign affairs press officer Nguyen Duy Linh . My task is sensitive . I must somehow convince the Vietnamese government , via Linh , that all I want to do is find_out what happened to my father so that I can lay his memory to rest . I am not here to write a typical American MIA story . I am here to chronicle a Vietnamese woman ' s search for her father . Linh turns_out to be an arrogant 26-year-old . He is courteously uncooperative from the beginning , telling me not to expect any help from his bosses , who do not want to call attention to the fallen South Vietnamese government . Linh will later bill me $ 600 -- a ransom in a country where an average citizen makes $ 20 a month -- for doing little more_than giving me the runaround for three weeks . After days of listening to his rhetoric , I resort_to a veiled threat . &quot; Obviously , you understand that if this story is told right and I can write_of how helpful the government was in my endeavors , then Vietnam would get good press , especially during these times of diplomatic discussions with the U.S. , &quot; I suggest to Linh , who this afternoon is sitting in my air-conditioned hotel_room , puffing heavy cigarette smoke in my direction . &quot; The way things are going , I will have to write that the government was not cooperative and did not support what I am doing. &quot; Linh , the only son of a high-ranking diplomat , stubs_out his third cigarette on the linoleum floor . &quot; that ' s fine . And it is true , &quot; he smiles benignly . &quot; You must understand -- you ' re not in America . Things are done differently here. &quot; I have been warned about the bureaucracy here many times . Robert J . Destatte , who heads the research section of the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi , prescribed the course of action I was trying to follow : &quot; Be polite , persistent and patient. &quot; I do everything Linh tells me to do . I sit_by the phone when he instructs that I should wait for his calls . He asks , and I provide , outlines of what I plan to write . He demands , and I make , a list of questions I would ask officials . I have meeting after meeting with him . I even beg . Then , six days into my stay in Hanoi , my patience really snaps . In a meeting in my hotel_room , I press Linh once again on when officials will meet with me and if anyone will be able to give me records of my father ' s imprisonment or tell me definitively that no such records exist . If I do not get answers on this trip , would I eventually on the next , or the next ? Linh gazes at me for long seconds through the cigarette haze and says offhandedly : &quot; You know , you ' ve done this all wrong . If you had told me in the first place you want to meet with people who could tell you about your father instead of requesting interviews with officials , I would have devoted my time looking_for people who may have information about your father. &quot; I am sure I have misheard him , or that my Vietnamese is not as fluent as I thought . But when I ask him again , he repeats his rubbish almost verbatim . So , I confront him with copies of every letter , every answered request he and his superiors have demanded from me . &quot; What would have been the most effective was a personal_appeal from you to Defense Minister Doan Khue , &quot; Linh says , ignoring the copies . &quot; I can only do so_much , you know. &quot; That is when I tell him , along with a_few choice words , that the only thing he has done_well is waste my time . And when I hand him a copy of my letter to the defense minister , Linh won ' t even touch it , claiming he never knew of its existence . Perhaps , he continues , I made a mistake when I returned to Vietnam as a reporter . If my task had been less political -- &quot; nothing a reporter writes_about the MIA issue is nonpolitical , &quot; he says -- maybe it would be easier to find_out what happened to my father . &quot; Brother Linh , &quot; I use the appropriate politesse , &quot; you ' re saying that if I had knocked_on your door -- not as a reporter but as a Viet Kieu ( overseas Vietnamese ) -- telling you what I was trying to do , asking_for yours or any other official ' s help , you would say , ' I ' ll see what I can do ' ? &quot; &quot; Of course not , &quot; he replies scornfully , &quot; I would ask you who you thought you were to make that kind of a request. &quot; IN 1972 , SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER TAN CANH FELL , MY mother took a bus to the Central Highlands in search of my father . &quot; I can ' t explain my mind-set at the time , why I even thought I could find him , &quot; she told me recently . &quot; I wanted to find_out the truth . I wanted to be at_peace . I also wanted to make_sure that if he had died , that he would be at_peace . How can a spirit rest if his family doesn ' t know if he lived or died ? &quot; But her bus was stopped in the remote province of Kon Tum in the Central Highlands , about 25 miles south of Tan Canh . Travelers could go no farther because of fighting in the area . She returned home dejected , but that was only to be the first of her many attempts to find_out what happened to Father . Most of her efforts included me . Three months after Father was reported missing in action , we moved south to Saigon . Qui Nhon Regional Area Exchange , the U.S. supply base where she had been working as assistant manager of the cafeteria , was being shut_down , so she was transferred to the base at Tan Son Nhat Airport . In Saigon , our search began again . Every weekend , Mom went_to the military_headquarters in Bien Hoa , where they updated lists of soldiers who had been confirmed dead or who managed to make_it back to the south . Mom showed Father ' s pictures around , asking returning soldiers if they had seen him . No one ever recognized him and his name remained on the MIA list . On the days I had to be at school , Mom ' s trek home was always the same . As I stood outside our house waiting for her , I would see a lonely figure , dressed in black , walking unsteadily down a dirt path . Once she reached me , Mom would crumple at my feet and cry , chanting through her tears , &quot; Mom couldn ' t find your father. &quot; I would get_down on my knees to help her get_up . And we would cling_to each other for a while . In March of 1973 , as a provision of a cease-fire treaty , North and South Vietnam exchanged prisoners_of_war . On the designated day , Mom and I went_to the Ba Chieu district outside Saigon , where a military camp was set_up , and joined throngs of people also waiting for the release of their loved ones . As families tearfully reunited all around us , we felt certain that Father was going_to run toward us at any time . Then , Mom saw faces she knew , officers and soldiers in the same artillery_unit as Father ' s at Tan Canh . There were seven of them and one by one , they all said they didn ' t know what happened to him . The unit commanders , Lt . Col . Trinh Le Trien and Maj . Trinh Thanh Khue , confirmed that Father had been captured with them . However , they told Mom , when they reached their destination , a prison_camp in Hanoi , he was nowhere to be seen . We wandered into a medical tent . There , Mom spotted Father ' s driver , Corp . Nguyen Van Dong . &quot; Ma ' am , the captain died &quot; were his first words . Mom swayed and fell , hitting her head against a wooden chair . &quot; You saw my husband die ? &quot; she weakly asked , as I helped her steady herself . &quot; How did he die ? &quot; &quot; I don ' t know , Ma ' am . I didn ' t see that he died . I just assume so because the last time I saw him , the captain was so weak , &quot; he replied . According to Dong , Father had become ill en route to the camp , and his captors had to drag him by rope part of the way . In the days and months to come , the military grapevine was_full of such tales . Someone said a rocket missile struck Capt . Hung ' s artillery gun during the initial attacks on Tan Canh . Another remembered that as everyone surrendered , only Father continued to fire at the enemy and was finally captured at gunpoint . Even my father ' s older sister said she saw a soldier on television tell a reporter he overheard a &quot; Capt . Hung &quot; challenge his captors on a bridge during the journey to the prison_camp ; the North Vietnamese , the man reported , shot the prisoner . Mom tracked_down the sources of all_the stories . But they never turned_out to be anything but gossip . &quot; Everyone told me he was shot or had died , but they also said they were not certain , &quot; Mom told me . &quot; They made me despair , then they gave me hope . Every once in a while , I would hear stories of men who returned home even after they had been given_up for dead . So I just went_on hoping. &quot; IT IS ANOTHER HOT MORNING IN HANOI , AND I AM SITTING in the office of Vietnam Veterans Association Magazine , trying , once again , to be patient and polite . Since 1991 , this magazine has published supplements listing names and photos of missing Communist troops , Viet Cong guerrillas and grave sites . The idea is to encourage readers who may remember a name , a face or a battle to contact family members or the magazine . To date , the magazine has established the fates of more_than 600 of those reported missing in action in the North ' s cause . The listing is free , assistant editor-in-chief Tran Ngoc tells me , and family members looking_for their husbands , fathers and sons &quot; who died for the country ' s liberation &quot; are never turned_away . &quot; My father was a Vietnamese officer who fought for a cause he believed was right for his country , &quot; I remind him . I offer to pay to have my father ' s name included in the list . Ngoc gazes at me for several seconds , then replies evenly : &quot; We ' re not as opened as that yet . The purpose of our magazine is to find our soldiers first . Once we ' ve accounted_for all our people who are still missing , then perhaps we can begin to look_for others. &quot; Nghiem Xuan Tue , a spokesman with the Ministry of Labour , Invalids and Social_Affairs , is a little less diplomatic when I finally talk to him . His agency mounts searches for Vietnamese MIAs . &quot; The only MIA number we have is 300 # 000 , and they ' re the brave soldiers who fought for the country ' s liberation , &quot; says Nghiem . &quot; The others , they don ' t matter. &quot; It is a shock to hear it said so plainly . The United States lists 2 # 233 Americans missing in Southeast_Asia during the Vietnam_War , including 1 # 642 in Vietnam proper . The search for these casualties is ongoing and the issue has been so influential that it has prevented Capitol_Hill from establishing diplomatic ties with Hanoi . Hanoi itself has begun to look_for answers to the question of what happened to its own 300 # 000 MIAs . These two old enemies have even begun to share battlefield information in search of their missing . But no one is counting my father , no one is sharing information about him , and no one is going_to . Many Vietnamese believe_in so , destiny . Some consider it preordained ; others think that with guidance , they may be able to shape it themselves . I consider myself thoroughly Western in this regard -- my life , I tell myself , is determined by my own actions , my own choices . But now I decide to do as the Vietnamese do . I seek_out a fortuneteller . I have tried this just once before , in Saigon , while I waited for my official invitation to Hanoi . The soothsayer there dispensed wisdom from an alley doorway , flashing a toothy grin and burping as he sipped a cola . Tracing the lines on my right palm , he prophesied that I would be involved in a &quot; big accident &quot; by year ' s end , that I would receive great accolades having to do with my work , that if I wasn ' t careful , I would die drowning . &quot; Your father is still alive , &quot; he told me , and I am embarrassed to admit that my heart skipped a beat . &quot; He may have been kept_from home against his will in the beginning , &quot; the man said , counting the joint lines on his fingers , apparently to determine how Father ' s and my destinies were intertwined through our birth dates . &quot; But for a long_time now , he does not want to return to the people who knew and loved him . He ' s too ashamed . He has lost everything that means everything to a man , his home , his pride , his belief in himself. &quot; I turned_to go , but the fortuneteller would not release my hand . He stared at it a little longer before saying : &quot; Father and daughter will see each other again . He will find you. &quot; Now , in Hanoi , I find myself in another alley , knocking_on another door . The employees at my hotel swear by this woman , Vu Thi Xuan , a 36-year-old Buddhist who reads destinies in cards . I am invited to sit on a straw-mat-covered bed . When I tell her I am looking_for my father , I reveal no details of his disappearance . Three different times , she tells me to shuffle the cards and to turn_over nine of them . &quot; I am trying to be sure , &quot; she says , explaining why she has me shuffle so many times . &quot; Every single time , your cards say your father is still alive . He has been living with a son all these years , a son who is around your age , &quot; Xuan says , fingering the playing cards individually . &quot; Without this son , your father would have no home , no one to care_for him . As it is , he still has nothing . His fate has always been that he would be separated from his family. &quot; He doesn ' t know you are looking_for him , Xuan tells me . But rest assured , &quot; he will read in an advertisement that you ' re looking_for him and he will find you. &quot; I tell Xuan I don ' t believe_in fortunetellers . At her silent , questioning look , I say , &quot; I don ' t know why I ' m here. &quot; Then : &quot; Am I to just take you at your word ? &quot; &quot; You ' ll receive news by November , &quot; she responds quietly . I do not tell her that I have heard such a prediction before , I do not say that every_other avenue of inquiry has come_up dry ; I simply leave . IT IS A WEEK INTO MY STAY in Hanoi before Linh finally gives me some good news : He can take me to Tan Canh , the battlefield where my father was last seen alive . During an eight-hour drive on the narrow highway that cuts_through the heart of the Central Highlands , I quietly soak in the scenes around me . I savor every bump and twisting turn_on the highway , knowing I am_on the same path Father took countless times en route to combat . This was once a jungle , before B-52 raids cleared the land . Now the government has decided it should be cultivated , and we drive through wooded hills and small orchards of rubber , banana , jicama and pear_trees . We pass Pleiku , the province where I was born . We drive through An Khe , a lush , rural hamlet of emerald-green rice_paddies where my maternal great-grandmother lived until she died more_than a decade ago . As a child , I used to climb trees in her orchard and ride the water_buffaloes in her rice field . Everywhere , military graveyards with ornate signs invite visitors to stop and pay their respects_to the liet si , the &quot; heroes who sacrificed their lives for their country. &quot; Even viewed through the window of a moving van , I can tell that these cemeteries -- the final resting place of Vietnam ' s &quot; liberators &quot; : the Viet Cong and the army of the North -- are well-kept and dignified , nothing like the lonely graves at Bien Hoa . To take my mind off depressing thoughts , I casually ask Linh about the country ' s perception of men like my father . I know he studied history at the University of Hanoi , and I pose my question as a journalist seeking background , overview , a sense of the norm . For the first time , Linh speaks sincerely and without condescension . &quot; In the War Against Americans , &quot; he begins , &quot; Vietnamese who took_up arms against their fellow Vietnamese are phan nuoc , traitors. &quot; I am less shocked than battered by the words . In the long silence that follows , I want to tell Linh that he is wrong , that his history is incomplete : My father is Vietnamese just as he is , just as his father and all_the other &quot; liberators &quot; are . His beliefs were different but they were no less noble . He was willing to die for a cause he believed_in and chances are , he did . I want to ask , doesn ' t any of that count ? But I keep my anguish to myself . The road trip blessedly ends when the van has to wait its turn_to cross a bridge . I am certain that this is the Bo Ko Bridge , the same one blown_up by Communist soldiers 22 years ago , ensuring that my father never returned home . I tell the driver to let me out . I walk slowly across the unsteady frame of steel bars and creaking wood planks , staring at the deep , flowing water that was the divide between Father and home so_long ago . On the other side and farther down the road , a huge concrete sign proclaims , &quot; Historical Ruins . . . Victorious Battle. &quot; What used to be Tan Canh firebase is now an empty expanse at the top of a plateau , one of the highest points in the strategic Central Highlands . Geographically belonging_to South Vietnam , this region separated northern Communist Vietnam from the towns and provinces of the south . For most of Father ' s 10 years in the army , he was stationed in the Highlands . He spent the last two years at Tan Canh under the ARVN 22nd Infantry Division . The fight for Tan Canh was a small part of the 1972 Easter Offensive -- a series of strategic attacks the Communists launched across all_of Vietnam in April that year . South Vietnamese who lived through that season , when fires from the battles scorched most of the countryside , call it Mua He Do Lua -- Red Fiery Summer . At Fire Base Tan Canh , 6 # 000 Communist troops crushed the 3 # 500-strong ARVN 22nd . I have already heard the story of the battle from the American point_of_view . &quot; The officers were not trained well , &quot; U.S. Army historian Dale Andrade has told me in a telephone_interview from his Washington , D.C. , office . &quot; They just would n ' t fight . Some of the men just ran pell-mell to Kon Tum . Many deserted the army , just went_home to their family. &quot; But I also have heard another version from Tam Vu and Khoi Ha , the ARVN veterans I visited in San Jose . &quot; For two days , rocket missiles rained and pounded on our bunkers , &quot; Vu , now 54 , told me . &quot; I was scared . We all were . But we still shot back , at what we didn ' t know . The more we fired , the more they came. &quot; Many of those who survived the onslaught surrendered or were captured , according to Vu , an infantry captain who escaped as he was being led to a prison_camp . Some , like Vu ' s friend Khoi Ha , also an infantry captain , did indeed &quot; run. &quot; &quot; For every one like me , &quot; remembered Ha , 58 , &quot; there were 10 , 20 , 30 men who were killed . Maybe I shouldn ' t have run . Maybe I should have stayed and died . But I did run and I lived to fight another battle. &quot; &quot; I will never forget Tan Canh , &quot; Vu said . &quot; I fought for more_than 10 years up until then , and Tan Canh was the first time I knew our side was going_to lose . We didn ' t have enough to win. &quot; It is hard to match Vu ' s horror-filled memories with the sweeping field of dirt that is now Tan Canh . It is scattered with bushes , trees and tumbleweeds . There are pieces of rusted metal here and there , and a_few bomb or bunker craters in the ground , but those are the only visible reminders of the battle . It is also hard to hear Vu ' s voice in my ear as Col . A Minh , president of the local chapter of the Vietnamese Veterans Assn. , gives me a tour . &quot; This was one of our most glorious battles , &quot; Minh tells me . I had hoped that being where my father was last seen would give me a sense of peace , a measure of closure . But the voices of my escorts intrude . They stand_in the shade of a tree watching me . &quot; What does this Vietnamese foreigner expect to find here , &quot; one of them , a local , asks the others loud enough for me to hear . &quot; She goes abroad and she comes_back thinking that anyone would help her find her father , a traitor to his people ? It ' s very funny. &quot; Heading back toward Bo Ko Bridge , I look again at the sign that marks the battlefield . The passing years and scorching sun have faded much of its blue-gray paint , but nothing dims its preamble -- &quot; On the morning of April 24 , 1972 , our forces overran ( Tan Canh ) firebase &quot; -- or its purpose , to celebrate the day I lost my father . BACK IN SAIGON , I WAKE_UP at 4 a.m. on the last_day of my journey . I want ample time to find Dong Ba Pagoda , the temple where Mom had set_up a shrine for Father on the third anniversary of his disappearance , the day before we left the country in 1975 . In most Vietnamese homes , an ornate red-and-gold altar is set_up so that family members can pray to the spirits of the dead . But because my father had never been found , dead or alive , and had no burial place , my great-grandmother advised Mom that a shrine at_home would n ' t do any good ; it would only invite a restless spirit to steal his children to keep him company in the nether world . Believing_in great-grandmother ' s wisdom , Mom had purchased an altar for Father at a temple instead . From there , if he were dead , his spirit would still be able to guide us . If he were alive , the shrine would serve as a permanent prayer for his return . The pagoda turns_out to be an unassuming two-story , wood-and-concrete structure . I arrive before the opening hour , so the gatekeeper and his wife run to awaken the nun in_charge . A gentle smile spreads across her face when I tell her why I am here . She takes me upstairs into a loft , where two large and dusty hardwood tables dominate the room . Propped on them are hundreds of pictures memorializing the dead . I lean across the tables , poring over each image . Here and there are photographs of men in military_uniform . I know that Mom had used a copy of a picture of Father ' s graduation from military school . I have seen it countless times . I would know it in my sleep . But even here -- as in the rest of my journey -- I am unsuccessful . My father ' s picture is nowhere to be found . Downstairs , the nun and I riffle through the temple ' s tattered record books for Father ' s name . Again , nothing . &quot; I didn ' t want you to be disheartened before you looked , so I didn ' t tell you , &quot; the nun says as she bundles the books back together . &quot; Some of the records were lost or burned . We tried to safe-keep all pictures of military_officers , but many were taken and destroyed after liberation. &quot; THE SEARCH FOR MY FATHER would end almost exactly where it began -- in memory and in resolve . When I had first arrived in Saigon , I briefly reunited with my uncle , my father ' s oldest brother , Nguyen Quoc Hung . I couldn ' t know it then , but finding Uncle Hung was the closest I would come_to finding my father in Vietnam . Listening to his comrades in the United States , meeting his adversaries on the battlefield , hearing the old conflicts debated again through the differing stories of Tan Canh -- all_of that taught me about his time , the why and how associated with his disappearance . But it was my uncle ' s recollections , stored now with my own and my mother ' s , that helped make my father come_alive in my heart and mind . From Uncle Hung , I discovered that my father ' s fate might have been completely different but for his stubbornness . When Father was 18 , Uncle Hung told me , he was turned_away from the military because , at 120 pounds , he didn ' t weigh enough . Undaunted , Father bought a long steel rope and wound it snugly around himself . On his second try , he tipped the scale at the minimum required , 135 pounds . His zeal , according to my uncle , came not so_much from wanting to fight as wanting to help rebuild a democratic Vietnam . But first he had to get_through the war . As happy as Uncle Hung was to see me in Saigon , after 19 years of separation , my return also reminded him of the emotional burden he had been carrying . &quot; For several years after 1975 , every time I heard a knock_on the door , my heart would stop and I would run to greet the visitor -- just in case it was your father coming_home , &quot; Uncle Hung told me , staring out the opened_door into the humid night . &quot; I never believed , in the beginning , that he died . So , I kept hoping , and praying to the_Buddha , that he would come_home . After a while , I stopped running to the door when someone knocked . For my peace_of_mind , I gave_up hope . But , as you know , the hardest part is never knowing. &quot; That night , as I began my journey , I agreed with him -- not knowing was the hardest part . But three weeks later , I had learned that there was something harder , something worse than not knowing . &quot; When the living forget the dead , &quot; one of the nuns at the Dong Ba Pagoda had told me , &quot; the dead die once more. &quot; In Vietnam , my father and thousands of heroes like him have been dying -- and disappearing -- again and again for two decades , without memorials , without a tally , with hardly an official ripple . And in the United States , the land of his allies , my father also continues to vanish . My discovery saddens my mother , who is more disappointed for me that I did not find anything concrete . Mom says she came_to terms over Father ' s disappearance a long_time ago . She hopes I can , as well . As for me , I have to admit that I have not yet given_up hope . Even though my intellect tells me otherwise , some small part of me still clings_to the unrealistic hope that he is alive and that the soothsayers ' prophecies will come true . But whatever my hopes , whatever my ambivalence , I keep coming_back to the nun ' s words , and the real discovery at the end of my search : If nothing else , I can find my father in memory . If nothing else , I bring him home alive by never forgetting .</TEXT>
