   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; LONG_BEACH ' SOUTH PACIFIC ' DOWNPLAYS SENTIMENTALITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When it comes_to musicals , everything old is new again . &quot; Carousel , &quot; &quot; Show Boat &quot; and &quot; Damn Yankees &quot; are only three of the many Broadway chestnuts radically rethought , refurbished and remounted in recent seasons . But when it comes_to &quot; South Pacific , &quot; that old Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein coconut keeps bouncing along in revival like a cockeyed optimist . No double-barreled reconsiderations . No major rewrites . Not even significant retouching . You can always count_on some producer to put it up in its more-or-less pristine form , as though a season without World_War_II Seabees and Navy nurses on a Polynesian island would constitute theatrical deprivation . This time the Long_Beach Civic Light_Opera has come_to our aid with an ambitious , full-bodied revival starring Sandy Duncan as Nellie Forbush , a provincial young ensign from Little_Rock , Ark. , who can ' t help falling_in_love with the island ' s wealthy Frenchman , Emile de Becque , a worldly plantation_owner played by Michael Nouri . The production , which opened Wednesday at the Terrace Theatre , relies less on the dramatic pull of their May-December romance than on the nostalgic charms of a romantic score filled with substance as well as feeling . It not only captures a time more innocent than our own but appeals_to our common humanity across the years . Few Broadway musicals can match the songs of &quot; South Pacific &quot; for their beguiling tunes and meaningful lyrics . Whether addressing such varied subjects as love at first sight ( &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot; ) , race prejudice ( &quot; You ' ve Got to Be Carefully Taught &quot; ) or lost possibilities ( &quot; This Nearly Was Mine &quot; ) , they speak a rare yet simple language . * Duncan gives a lively , first-rate performance . She exudes sincerity . Her singing is stylish , her dancing limber and polished . Nouri more_than holds his own . His bearish presence both as an actor and singer makes a warm match for her gamin-like personality . He anchors Duncan with tender strength . Not that director Robert Iscove allows the show to get preachy or wear its melodious heart on its sleeve . At least not too visibly . He goes_for comic energy at every turn , which dissipates the sentimental . He also injects an atmosphere of realism through Douglas D . Smith ' s kaleidoscopic screen projections . They are overlayed like a collage on a see-through scrim or on a solid backdrop and combined with live action to suggest the aura of the ' 40s . For all its innocence , we see a world at war . The show has weak_spots : stilted dialogue , wooden acting in secondary roles , a tendency to sag between musical numbers . But the most glaring flaw is Mitchell Anderson ' s weak performance as Joe Cable , the Princeton-educated lieutenant who falls_in_love with the Tonkinese girl Liat . The pathos of Cable ' s romance ought to lend the show added poignancy . His love for Liat is doomed , after all , because he feels hostage to white racism . While the relationship between Cable and Liat is never easy to bring_off without seeming contrived or patronizing , here it is wholly undeveloped and uninvolving . Pat Suzuki plays the Tonkinese peddler Bloody Mary with animation to spare in a crowd-pleasing role that is , as usual , more caricature than character . Steve Witting offers a serviceable Luther Billis , chief Seabee . Technically , the show has the advantages of a male chorus with a big sound , an imaginative scenic design , rich lighting and a well-conducted orchestra . * &quot; South Pacific , &quot; Terrace Theatre , 300 Ocean Blvd. , Long_Beach .
