   <HEADLINE> TEST PROVES SOME DOGS HAVE OBEDIENCE LICKED ; TRAINING : ONLY THREE OF 28 FAIL PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES BIGGEST CHALLENGE : SITTING QUIETLY ON A HILL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After winning a certificate recognizing him as a well-behaved dog , Luke , a 3-year-old Labrador-beagle mix , smiled broadly , his pink tongue dangling out the side of his panting mouth . For Luke , a veteran of obedience school , Saturday ' s second annual Canine Good Citizenship Test was old hat -- practically . &quot; You never know what he ' ll do next , &quot; said Luke ' s owner , Cindy Campbell of Ojai , shaking her head at the short , blond dog who was sitting peacefully on the lawn at Camino Real Park . &quot; He doesn ' t stay very well , &quot; Campbell said . &quot; He eats the cat_food . He ' s very good at chasing the chickens . . . . ( But ) he really has added another dimension in our family . He ' s really one of us. &quot; Luke was one of 28 dogs who , aside from the occasional slip into bad-dog behavior , demonstrated remarkably good comportment while being led through a series of obedience tests at the daylong event sponsored by the Ventura County Dog Fanciers Assn . Only three dogs failed the test by barking or not listening to their owners ' commands . &quot; It ' s a unique program that helps owners make_good citizens out of their dogs , &quot; said Betty Burnell , an organizer of the event who has taught dog obedience classes through the Ventura Parks and Recreation department for 12 years . Burnell defined a canine good citizen as a dog that &quot; makes its owner happy without making anyone else unhappy. &quot; The good-citizenship test was developed by the American Kennel Club in 1989 to recognize good behavior in both purebreds and mutts , Burnell said . Dogs are judged by how well they can obey commands , such_as walking on a leash , sitting and staying . &quot; It ' s not a formal obedience training , but just to show that a dog can behave , &quot; explained Simi Valley resident Rosalie Anderson , president of the Ventura County Dog Fanciers Assn . and an American Kennel Club judge . In order to receive a good-citizenship certificate , dogs have to welcome being groomed and handled by a stranger , walk on a loose lead around a course of orange traffic cones and , in what appeared to be the most difficult test for some of Saturday ' s competitors , be left alone on a grassy hill while not barking , whining or pacing . Ten-year-old Candice Schlunegger of Ojai was worried her fluffy gray Tibetan_terrier mix , Waggner , would fail this part of the exam . &quot; He always barks at_home , &quot; she said . But Waggner passed , and proudly chomped on his red leash after he and Candice accepted their certificate , ribbon and collar medallion . Candice was one of eight youngsters from the Loma Vista and Miramonte 4-H clubs who escorted their pooches through the test . They were joined by 20 adults , a mixed bag of serious and casual dog owners . &quot; We ' re here for fun and doggie socialization , &quot; said Wendy Schustack of Ventura , who brought two dogs to be tested , a purebred German_shepherd named Von Rollo and a Rhodesian ridgeback-pit bull mix called Guy . Schustack and her Ventura-based dog trainer , Sheila Foutch , hoped to expose Guy to a low-key obedience test that wasn ' t restricted only to purebreds . &quot; We wanted to come here and see what needed to be done , &quot; Foutch said of Guy ' s training . Both women said dog owners need to take the time to train their pets . &quot; All dogs should go_through obedience training , &quot; Schustack said . &quot; They ' re animals and they ' re unpredictable. &quot; Longtime dog-show judges Dolly and Robert Ward brought their purebred Samoyed , Varmi , to the event so she could brush_up on her obedience training . &quot; I thought , if she doesn ' t pass I ' ll be a laughingstock , &quot; 74-year-old Dolly Ward said . Because the Hidden Hills couple travel frequently to judge dog_shows around the world , they make an effort to take Varmi to public events whenever possible . &quot; She likes to do things and I don ' t want her to be alone. &quot; Ventura resident Mary Thue and her sheltie , Topaz , are novices at obedience competitions . &quot; This is his first good citizen and we did_well , &quot; Thue said . &quot; I want to train him to be in competition. &quot; Thue said she intends to frame Topaz ' s certificate . &quot; Why not ? &quot; she asked , petting Topaz on the head . &quot; It ' s proof that he ' s a good dog. &quot;</TEXT>
