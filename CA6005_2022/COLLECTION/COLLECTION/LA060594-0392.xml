   <HEADLINE> HOME WISE : GREEN_THUMB ; LARGEST WATER-USER IN HOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : My wife and I are planning a remodel of our guest bathroom and want to install a water-saving toilet . We want to do our part to conserve water , but we were shocked when a neighbor told us about problems with these toilets . Can you give us some more information on problems with low-flush toilets ? ANSWER : Your neighbor may be suspicious of low-consumption toilets clogging your sewer or drain-field , but studies locally and in other cities concluded that clogging is not an issue . Like all products , some low-consumption toilets perform better than others . Check_out the July , 1990 , issue of Consumer Reports magazine for performance test results on a group of low-consumption toilets . With toilets as the single largest water user in the home , this is a good place to start saving water . A typical pre-1975 toilet uses between 5-7 gallons per flush ( g.p.f. ) . New low-flush toilets use just 1.6 gallons . An average family of four can save about $ 100 a year in water and sewage charges , just by switching from a standard 5 g.p.f. toilet to a new 1.6 g.p.f. low-consumption toilet . Less water per flush also means less sewage to be treated . Obviously this is a savings in the amount of water you use when you flush . Aside from running_out and replacing all your toilets , another way to save water is to flush the toilet less often . Unnecessary flushing to dispose_of items such_as facial_tissues , spiders , food_waste or other items should be discontinued and those items disposed_of in a more appropriate manner . If you ' re not going_to replace the other toilets in your house , there are some things you can do to reduce the amount of water these toilets use . Perhaps the easiest is to displace some of the water in the tank . This can be done using a plastic laundry or dish soap container , or any plastic container with a tight fitting lid . Fill the container with water or sand and carefully place it in the toilet tank . Be careful not to let the bottle interfere with the flush mechanism . Do not use a brick . Bricks may deteriorate over time and result in expensive plumbing problems down the road . You should also check with your local water utility . . . many have free water saving devises to retrofit into toilet .
