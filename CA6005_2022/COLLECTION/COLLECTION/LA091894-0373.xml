   <HEADLINE> NATURAL_GAS VEHICLE PLANT FUELS INDUSTRY ; TRANSPORTATION : OFFICIALS HOPE A NEW EAST L.A. FACILITY WILL ENCOURAGE MORE MOTORISTS TO TANK UP WITH THE CLEANER , CHEAPER FUEL INSTEAD OF GASOLINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Ecotrans takes_off the way Southern California Gas Co . officials hope it will , the gas more motorists seek before long will be all natural . Ecotrans , a natural-gas vehicle production plant on an 11-acre site in East Los Angeles , began full operation last week . It specializes in outfitting new pickup_trucks , vans and other vehicles with natural-gas equipment and converting older vehicles that run_on gasoline . Officials said that so far , the bulk of the vehicles being converted at the plant involve government or large-company vehicles . Still , they said , the widespread switch from gasoline to natural_gas or other alternative fuels in private vehicles is inevitable , especially considering government mandates for a cleaner environment . &quot; The vehicles Ecotrans will put_on the street will produce far fewer pollutants than conventional vehicles , &quot; said Warren Mitchell , president of the gas_company and chairman of the Natural_Gas Vehicle Coalition , which consists_of 250 companies in the natural-gas industry nationwide . Officials said natural_gas lowers emissions of carbon_monoxide by roughly 90 % , compared to gasoline-powered engines , and natural_gas generally costs about 40 cents less per gallon than gasoline . The Ecotrans plant , which employs about 40 workers , mostly displaced aerospace employees , is expected to generate several thousand jobs as conversions become more popular during the next few years , they said . For many motorists , the drawbacks to the natural-gas system include the estimated $ 3 # 000 to $ 4 # 500 conversion cost and the relative scarcity of natural-gas refueling stations in the region -- fewer than 60 . * Ronald H . Smith , general_manager at Ecotrans , said those who make the switch will be given map books that identify the refueling stations . And , he said , conversions can be done so that vehicles maintain the ability to operate_on gasoline , switching automatically if they get low on natural_gas . Smith said that conversion costs are expected to be closer to $ 1 # 500 by the turn_of_the_century because of system improvements and other factors . He forecast about 600 refueling stations in Southern California by that time . Officials said that about 2 # 000 vehicles now operate_on natural_gas in the region , with about 100 of those belonging_to private citizens . An estimated 200 # 000 natural-gas vehicles are expected to be_on the road in the area by the century ' s end . And the East Los Angeles plant hopes to produce at least 9 # 500 natural_gas vehicles by the end of 1996 . &quot; Natural_gas is much cleaner and safer , &quot; Smith said . &quot; The chance to help the environment and to have this project to work_on has been exciting. &quot; A tour of the plant on East Olympic Boulevard near Santa Fe Avenue revealed an assembly_line of white trucks , many of them adorned with blue-and-yellow gas_company decals reading , &quot; Natural_Gas Powered -- For Clean Air-Economy-Performance. &quot; * Elsewhere at the complex , the vehicles at various stages of conversion included a United Parcel Service truck , a U.S._government military_police van , a Marine Corps pickup_truck and several U.S. Postal Service delivery_trucks . Councilman Richard Alatorre , whose 14th District includes the plant site , said a major reason he supports Ecotrans is the potential for job opportunities . Oil_industry representatives who oppose the transition to natural_gas are bound to find_out they are fighting the wave of the future , he said . &quot; They don ' t have a choice , &quot; he said . &quot; The smart ones are doing_it . The dumb ones are going_to fight the inevitable. &quot;</TEXT>
