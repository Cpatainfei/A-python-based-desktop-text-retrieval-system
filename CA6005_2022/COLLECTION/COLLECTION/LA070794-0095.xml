   <TEXT> Most citizens of the former Soviet_Union desperately want democracy , says Sophia Balakrishnan , 55 , a Soviet emigre . Over the past several decades , however , entiregenerations have grown_up in a society that undermined individual accountability by demanding deference to the Communist state . As a result , the principal hurdle for residents of the former Soviet_Union is not economic or political but , rather , psychological , Balakrishnan says . Citizens who formerly relied_on the state to regulate nearly every aspect of their lives , she says , must now learn self-reliance . That state of affairs prompted Balakrishnan , a translator and former tour guide who emigrated to the United States in 1976 , to start the Center for the Psychology of Democracy in Westwood four years ago . The center , run with a staff of one -- Balakrishnan -- is a nonprofit organization of academics that sponsors seminars and workshops throughout the Southland . It seeks to foster civic education and self-reliance among Russian emigres , and deepen American understanding of the problems Russians face . Such learning , Balakrishnan says , is crucial . Without it , Balakrishnan says , residents of Russia will line_up behind totalitarian demagogues promising to restore old-style &quot; law and order. &quot; And many Russian emigres here , clinging_to their old ways , will become a welfare-dependent underclass . Says John D . McNeil , a UCLA professor emeritus in education and a volunteer adviser to the center : The center &quot; provides civic education at its best , both for the Russian emigres and for us to understand them . Balakrishnan brings_in a very unusual and solid perspective on all this. &quot; In Russia , Balakrishnan was an official tour guide for , among others , Nixon Administration officials and the American press corps . She says she found herself increasingly drawn to Americans ' individualism and can-do attitude . After the ouster of former Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and the subsequent restrictions on Soviet contacts with foreigners , she left the tour company , then decided to leave the country . Taking_advantage of a Cold_War thaw in 1976 , Balakrishnan applied for an exit visa , listing fictitious relatives abroad who would sponsor her . After a nail-biting eight-month wait , she was given permission to emigrate . Five years later , she became an American citizen . Even so , fearing the long reach of Soviet authorities , she worked here under an American pseudonym for a time . After receiving a master ' s degree in international affairs from Columbia University , Balakrishnan moved to Santa Monica and began helping fellow emigres . However , she soon found that their problems were more_than a matter of learning a new language and customs . Rather , she found that emigres ' expectations of the world were completely different from those of Americans , resulting in a pervasive &quot; paralysis. &quot; For example , she says , Soviet emigres often do not even know how to begin looking_for a job , let alone how to start their own businesses . In the former Soviet_Union , she explains , a person ' s profession was determined in school in accordance with society ' s needs . The schools , in turn , were linked to professional institutions , and the students &quot; graduated &quot; from school to a job . A future engineer would not look_for a temporary job outside his field just to make money , nor would he think to create his own job . The old order rewarded those who went_along with the bureaucracy , and punished those who took the initiative . So in Russia today , budding entrepreneurs often face hostility from fellow citizens , many of whom regard such activity with suspicion . &quot; Freedom is equated with stealing or cheating , &quot; Balakrishnan said , and individuals thought to be making too_much money often receive death threats . &quot; Shops have been burned , people attacked and abused because they are more enterprising than others. &quot; That rubs_off on emigres , Balakrishnan said . Many renew their dependency on government by going_on welfare . And even those who find jobs remain affected by their life under a totalitarian regime . &quot; Ask American business people who deal with ( Russians ) , &quot; she says . &quot; They will tell you that the ( Russians ) do not look_into your eyes while talking ; instead , they look_away from your face and mumble something . This behavior has become a habit . Because punishment followed so readily from self-expression , they are afraid of showing what they think and feel. &quot; As a result , she said , &quot; most ( Russians ) do only exactly what they have been told to do ; they do not take any initiative to do more , to improve their way of doing the job. &quot; Such questions have been the subject of numerous workshops and seminars conducted by the center . Recommendations arising from those sessions are being put to use . McNeil , for example , says several of his graduate_students now include civics instruction while teaching English to Russian emigres in the Fairfax area . Soon , he said , his students hope to offer such courses to emigres in West Hollywood . The center has also begun a study of the psychology of democracy in association with Pepperdine University and the prestigious Association of Humanistic Psychology . The study will focus_on the adjustment problems faced by current residents of Russia and Russians who have emigrated to the United States . Said Balakrishnan : &quot; We can send the Russians 5 # 000 pairs of shoes . But when the shoes wear_out , they will be in the same place they are today . We must help these people make the transition , both in Russia and here . The consequences , if we do not , can be very dire. &quot;</TEXT>
