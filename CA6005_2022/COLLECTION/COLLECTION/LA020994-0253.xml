   <HEADLINE> CHEVRON DENIED PERMISSION FOR EMERGENCY TANKER SHIPPING ; ENVIRONMENT : A SPOKESMAN FOR THE OIL_COMPANY SAYS SANTA BARBARA COUNTY OFFICIALS WHO MADE THE DECISION ' NEED A REFRESHER CLASS IN ECONOMICS 101. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a blow to Chevron Corp. ' s Point Arguello operations , Santa Barbara County officials on Tuesday denied the oil_company ' s emergency tanker shipping application , forcing the company to scramble to find storage_space or cut production from its vast offshore oil fields . Environmentalists in Ventura County and elsewhere in Southern California hailed the decision , saying that , at least temporarily , the ecologically sensitive Santa Barbara Channel will be spared the risk of an oil spill from a tanker accident . &quot; We believe the decision that the county reached was correct and we are cautiously optimistic that , at least for the short term , the ecologically fragile Santa Barbara Channel will be protected from tankering , &quot; said Linda Krop , an attorney with the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense Center , a public interest law_firm representing several environmental organizations . Echoing Krop was Lisa Weil , policy director for the Santa Monica-based American Oceans Campaign . &quot; We feel that Chevron ' s request is bogus , &quot; Weil said . &quot; This is nothing but a desperate move to play for time and continue tankering. &quot; Tanker shipments began last August after Chevron obtained a three-year permit from the California Coastal Commission , allowing the company to ship oil only to Los Angeles . But the company failed to meet a key condition of the permit : that it have an agreement by Feb . 1 for an overland pipeline to carry the oil when the permit expired in 1996 . Shortly before the Feb . 1 deadline , Chevron applied for emergency permission to continue shipping by tanker up_to 40 # 000 barrels of oil a day to Los Angeles refineries . The company said an emergency permit was warranted because an oil_pipeline it uses to get oil to Los Angeles suffered damage during the Jan . 17 earthquake and was shut_down . In the application , the company contended that because of damage to Four Corners Pipeline No . 1 , a crude-oil supply emergency had arisen -- a claim rejected by Santa Barbara County officials . &quot; We ' ve denied the emergency tankering request because Chevron has not demonstrated that a crude-oil supply emergency actually existed , &quot; John Patton , director of the county ' s resource management division , said in a statement . &quot; We have analyzed the facts , and it ' s clear to us that for February , refineries in L.A. have adequate crude supplies. &quot; But according to G . Michael Marcy , a Chevron spokesman , Tuesday ' s decision by county officials was ill-researched and ill-conceived . He also said Chevron has no other economically feasible way to move the oil . Other Four Corners pipelines to Los Angeles are overcrowded , and sending the crude_oil in other pipelines to other locations was not economically viable , given the depressed oil market . * &quot; Santa Barbara County officials need a refresher class in Economics 101 , &quot; Marcy said . &quot; I think their decision was a product of a cultural bias against our company that we have had to deal with regardless of the concessions , mitigations and environmental protections we have proposed throughout the history of this project . This is nothing but an arbitrary decision. &quot; Currently , Chevron and its Point Arguello Project corporate partners are producing about 80 # 000 barrels of crude_oil a day from their offshore fields northwest of Santa Barbara -- fields that contain an estimated 300 million to 600 million barrels of oil . If necessary , the companies can store about 800 # 000 barrels of crude . If that capacity is reached , Marcy said , the company will reduce oil_production at the facility . In a separate defeat for Chevron on Tuesday , State Lands Commission officials said that even if Santa Barbara County had approved the emergency permit , the oil_company would not have been able to ship oil from the state-owned Gaviota Interim Marine Terminal because it failed to meet the Feb . 1 deadline in the Coastal Commission tankering permit issued last year . Marcy offered several explanations for the company ' s failure to keep the permit it had fought for a decade to obtain . During much of 1993 , the company was working_on such a deal with Huntington Beach-based Cajon Pipeline Co . but broke_off negotiations in December after failing to agree on terms or a route for the line , which is slated to run from the Barstow area to Los Angeles . Chevron instead has chosen to pursue development of the Pacific Pipeline , an oil conduit proposed to run directly south from Kern County to company refineries in the Los Angeles area . * Marcy said Chevron is negotiating with Pacific Pipeline Co . officials on a deal . But the pipeline_company has not yet secured regulatory and construction permits . If it does -- possibly by this summer -- Chevron will reapply for permits to resume tankering , Marcy said . The oil_company ' s 17th and last load of crude_oil , an estimated 250 # 000 barrels , was shipped out of Gaviota Jan . 31 aboard the Chevron tanker Oregon , Marcy said .</TEXT>
