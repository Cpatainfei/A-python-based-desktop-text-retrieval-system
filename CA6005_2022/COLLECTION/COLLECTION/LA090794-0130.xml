   <HEADLINE> SERBIAN GOOD_FAITH ? DON ' T COUNT ON IT ; A RECKLESS LIFTING OF SANCTIONS COULD HAVE DIRE EFFECTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina seceded from a disintegrating Yugoslavia in 1991 , Serbia invaded , using the Bosnian Serb minority as local allies . The undisguised goal of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was to keep as much of the original Yugoslavia as possible under Serb control and to &quot; cleanse &quot; captured territory of non-Serbs . As the war has gone_on , however , the independence of the Bosnian Serbs has grown . Just as Milosevic has easily distinguished his goal of Serb unification and expansion from his support for Bosnian Serb leaders , they , as time went , have returned the favor . For the Bosnian Serbs , union with Serbia in a reconstituted Yugoslavia has remained a goal ; support for Milosevic is another matter . In May , 1992 , Milosevic announced that the official Yugoslav army had withdrawn from Bosnia , though supply_lines remained open and public support by Milosevic for Radovan Karadzic , president of one of the two self-declared Bosnian Serb states , remained high . However , when the Bosnian Serbs rejected a U.N.-sponsored plan for an internal partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina , Milosevic ostentatiously announced that his support for them was at an end . There was never any reason to believe that if the Bosnian Serbs had accepted the U.N. peace plan either they or the Serbian Serbs would have observed its terms : The record of past scorned agreements makes that clear . Nonetheless , the Bosnian Serbs clearly departed from Milosevic ' s script by formally rejecting the peace plan . And the result of that rejection has been that U.N.-imposed sanctions barring trade with Yugoslavia have remained in place and may even be tightened . Milosevic obviously hoped that his well-orchestrated break_with Karadzic would lead to a quick and complete lifting of the sanctions , but it has not had that effect . Should it ? We do not think so . Five major_powers -- Britain , France , the United States , Russia and Germany -- are continuing a meeting in Berlin today to discuss this question . Russia will demand an immediate end to the sanctions . The United States and Germany may well support an easing -- not a complete lifting -- of sanctions if Yugoslavia will permit the stationing of international monitors along its supply_routes to the Bosnian Serbs . Yugoslavia has rejected this option unless the monitors can come from the two nations , Russia and Greece , that blatantly disregarded the sanctions all along . Monitoring by Russians and Greeks may be defended by some as a compromise between no monitoring and no change whatever in the sanctions , but this move should really be seen as a capitulation . A progressive easing of sanctions could be defensible , given strict monitoring and the certainty that any violation would lead to immediate reimposition . But the good_faith of the Yugoslav Serbs is not to be naively presumed . According to widespread reports , supplies have continued to flow_from Yugoslavia to the Bosnian Serbs , who in recent days have returned to large-scale &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; in northeast Bosnia and commenced a shelling of Sarajevo that Tuesday prompted a prudent Pope John Paul II to cancel his scheduled visit . We believe that President Clinton should , even now , lift the U.S. arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina unilaterally . But even those who disagree must recognize , at the very least , that any reckless lifting of the Yugoslav economic sanctions will make the Bosnian arms embargo virtually impossible to maintain .</TEXT>
