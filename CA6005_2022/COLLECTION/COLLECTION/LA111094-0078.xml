   <HEADLINE> D.A. FORCED TO BEEF_UP HIS A-TEAM ; SIMPSON CASE : FACED WITH AN IMPOSING DEFENSE , GARCETTI HAS COMMITTED 11 PEOPLE . LATEST WAS PROSECUTOR IN COWLINGS PROBE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Responding to aggressive defense tactics in the O.J. Simpson murder case , the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office has assembled its largest prosecution team in decades and may continue adding lawyers between now and opening statements early next year , the county ' s top prosecutor said Wednesday . Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , speaking_to reporters at a regular briefing , said he has assigned seven prosecutors and four law clerks to the case , more staff than have tackled any trial during his 26 years with the district_attorney ' s office . The next biggest team , he said , was assembled for the McMartin child molestation case , which involved four prosecutors in a gruelingly long trial that ended in acquittals . The large and growing Simpson prosecution effort , headed by deputy district_attorneys Marcia Clark and William Hodgman , is intended to keep pace with Simpson ' s formidable legal machinery , Garcetti said . Nine different attorneys have appeared for Simpson in court , forcing Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito to install a special table to accommodate the overflow . &quot; They have nine lawyers cranking_out motions , &quot; Garcetti said . The result , he added , is that Clark and Hodgman &quot; have literally been killing themselves . . . . They have been working so hard . They have been sacrificing so much. &quot; Garcetti defended the team ' s most recent addition , Deputy Dist . Atty . Christopher A . Darden , who was added this week after completing his work as the lead prosecutor assigned to investigate Simpson ' s close friend , Al Cowlings . Darden became the first African American to join the prosecution team , and the timing of his appointment , just days after a predominantly black jury was sworn_in , prompted Simpson attorney Johnnie L . Cochran Jr . to suggest that Darden ' s race was a factor_in his transfer . Simpson , who is black , faces charges that he murdered his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ronald L . Goldman , both of whom were white . Simpson has pleaded not_guilty . Garcetti , however , said that Darden had long been tapped to move to the Simpson prosecution once the Cowlings case was over and that it was coincidence that the shift took_place just after a jury was picked . Darden is one of the district_attorney ' s office ' s most respected lawyers , in recent years working as part of its Special Investigations Division , which investigates police_officers and other public employees accused of criminal wrongdoing . &quot; He ' s one of our senior prosecutors on this case , &quot; Garcetti said of Darden , a 13-year veteran of the office who has handled a number of sensitive police_investigations , including a recently concluded probe into the fatal police shooting of a woman on a hospital rooftop . &quot; He ' s going_to take a significant management role . We want to use his talents as a trial lawyer. &quot; In fact , Garcetti said , he believes Darden ' s ethnicity could be as much a drawback as an advantage in front of the predominantly black panel . &quot; It could very easily backfire , &quot; Garcetti said . &quot; There could be a juror who asks himself : ' Are you just bringing him in because he ' s black ? ' &quot; The trial has been delayed several times by the long jury selection process , and Garcetti said the postponements could force another shift in the prosecution team . Deputy Dist . Atty . Lisa Kahn , the prosecution ' s designated DNA expert , is expecting a baby in late December . * If the DNA hearing has not been concluded by the time she departs for maternity leave , Garcetti said that job may have to be turned_over to one of two other DNA experts working with the prosecution , a pair of government lawyers from Alameda and San Diego . Meanwhile , jury selection in the case continued Wednesday , with the day ' s first prospect clearing questioning for bias despite stating that he agreed with the verdicts of the Ventura County jury that acquitted LAPD officers of most charges in the first Rodney G . King beating trial . Cochran questioned that 35-year-old Pico Rivera resident at length , but the man repeatedly insisted that he could be fair and said he would consider it an honor to serve as an alternate juror . He acknowledged hearing something about DNA but added that it was while watching the movie &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; Clark joked that she saw no problem with that exposure because &quot; we ' re not making dinosaurs here. &quot; Once both sides had finished questioning him -- a session that went_on so_long Cochran quipped : &quot; If I stay_up here any longer , I ' ll be in the ' Guinness Book of World_Records ' for longest voir dire of a juror &quot; -- the man became the first alternate accepted for possible service on the panel . That man was allowed to remain on the panel , as was another despite his acknowledgment that he found it difficult to believe that Simpson could have committed the crimes with which he is charged . That man , a 56-year-old electrical_engineer , insisted he could be fair , and Ito pointedly challenged him about that . &quot; I don ' t mean this to be a sexist comment , &quot; Ito said , &quot; but man to man , are you being straight with me on this ? You can give both sides a fair trial ? &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; the man responded . But even though those two men and four other jury candidates made_it through Wednesday ' s questioning , they still could be removed by peremptory challenge when the candidates for alternate juror spots return Dec . 5 . Tuesday ' s questioning of panelists was the first day that prospective alternates were grilled , and it ended with all nine of those questioned being excused . Afterward , a jury consultant for Simpson said she believed that was merely a coincidence and did not reflect an overall problem with the remaining jury candidates . The selection of alternates in this case has taken_on special importance because both sides believe that some of the 12 jurors sworn_in last week will not make_it through the entire trial . The anticipated length of the trial and the extent of publicity surrounding it could result in some jurors falling sick or becoming exposed to media coverage , which would force them to be replaced by alternates . Ito is considering sequestering the jury , but has yet to make_up his mind . Prosecutors strongly support that idea , but Simpson ' s attorneys are adamantly opposed . Many prospective jurors have said they would find it difficult to serve if they were taken from their homes and cut_off from friends and family for months . As the selection of alternates has gotten under way , a number of panelists have been dismissed for harboring strong views about the case . Wednesday , one African American woman gave answers that convinced prosecutors she could not serve fairly . That woman , a 35-year-old Windsor Hills resident , said she had watched Simpson ' s preliminary hearing and developed impressions about a number of witnesses who testified . For instance , she questioned the credibility of two store employees who said they sold Simpson a knife , and she used the word unsure to describe LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman , who testified about finding a key piece of evidence in the case . She also said Detective Philip L . Vannatter , one of the lead investigators , &quot; appeared to be hiding something. &quot; The woman said her impression about Vannatter was based on &quot; his demeanor &quot; but said she did not have an opinion about what specifically she thought he was hiding . She also said that she was aware of allegations that Fuhrman was &quot; prejudiced &quot; and that he had planted a glove at Simpson ' s estate -- although she added that she had no firm opinions on these matters . Defense_attorneys have raised those allegations on several occasions but have produced no evidence to support the notion that Fuhrman or any other officer planted evidence . After Clark finished questioning that prospective juror , she asked Ito for a conference out of earshot of the woman . Ito and the attorneys for both sides conferred for more_than 10 minutes , and then Ito excused the woman . &quot; I thank_you for your candor , &quot; he said , explaining why she was being dismissed . &quot; My concern is you ' ve been poisoned by outside influences , and it ' s not your fault . It ' s the fault of the hysteria surrounding this case. &quot; That is a theme that Ito has struck frequently through the long jury selection process . Wednesday , Ito found a new way to take_aim at the coverage : As the session was about to begin , he proudly displayed to reporters in the courtroom a cartoon from the Orlando Sentinel . The cartoon depicts the media as a horde of jackals . Times staff writer Jim Newton contributed to this story . The Simpson Case : * For a complete package of stories on the O.J.
