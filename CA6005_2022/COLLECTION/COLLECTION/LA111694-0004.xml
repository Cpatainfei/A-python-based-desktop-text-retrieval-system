   <TEXT> Having wasted millions of dollars trying to repeal California ' s tough new anti-smoking law , Philip Morris is now cruising for another public-relations black_eye . The tobacco company is suing the ABC television network over news_reports , based partly on anonymous sources in the tobacco_industry , that cigarette makers artificially raised the nicotine level in their products to keep smokers hooked . The libel suit itself is not surprising , nor is the plaintiff ' s attempt to get ABC reporters to disclose their sources , but there is a troubling wrinkle . Philip Morris has sent subpoenas to hotels , car rental companies , phone_companies and credit_card issuers in an attempt to trace the movements of journalists as they gathered information for the story . This attempt to make an end-run around press shield laws is properly being resisted by ABC , with the support of several other major news organizations in friend-of-the-court briefs in Virginia . They argue that , in this computer-driven Information Age , exposing such records would seriously undermine the ability of reporters to guarantee confidentiality to key sources . Certainly the reporter ' s privilege means very little if it applies only to what goes_into his or her notebook . In part , this situation grows out of excessive use of anonymous sources . Too many news organizations allow aggrieved persons to shoot at enemies from a newsroom duck blind . In very rare cases , reporters even have fabricated stories , using unnamed &quot; sources. &quot; But that is not the issue here . If Philip Morris has a valid claim of libel , it should be able to prove that based on the content of the news_programs , not hotel phone records . Let a jury decide whether it was libelous to say that the tobacco companies manipulated nicotine content and then lied to the federal_government about it . We suspect that part of the Philip Morris offensive is not to win a libel judgment but to intimidate its own employees who would be whistle-blowers . Despite certain abuses , press access to inside sources has proved to be a powerful tool to keep government and business honest , the Watergate scandal that brought_down Richard Nixon being only the most obvious . There are certain facts that cannot be obtained without offering sources ironclad promises of anonymity . The press should not permit sources to make gratuitously pejorative statements from under cover , but the public good requires access to knowledgeable sources without fear of legal_action . The Philip Morris suit serves only to detract attention from the real issue : that the tobacco companies are marketing and promoting a dangerous product , and that they knew they were doing so_long before the public did .</TEXT>
