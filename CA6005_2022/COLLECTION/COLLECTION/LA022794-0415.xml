   <HEADLINE> THE TIMES SHOPPER : WORLDWIDE ; MARKET STRATEGIES ; FROM LONDON ' S PORTOBELLO ROAD TO TIBET ' S BARKHOR BAZAAR , THE WARES AND ENERGY OF THE OUTDOOR MARKETPLACE ARE IRRESISTIBLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A sea of silver stretches down the_hill and around the block . Silver coffee services . Silver bangles . Exquisite , twisted silver iced-tea_spoons , wedged next to tables of old-fashioned cameras , antique toys , old war badges and bric-a-brac . I ' ve rarely bought anything at the weekly Portobello Road market . But if I ' m in London on a Saturday , you can be sure I ' ll stop in . For me , the energy is irresistible . Vendors crow their bargains , their meaning unmistakable even when the language is beyond me . The unadulterated zest for wheeling and dealing stirs my little capitalist soul , and the bargaining that seems so bothersome in a stateside car showroom becomes a gleeful game . The smells waft past : corn on the grill , musty incense , strange pungent spices , the oh-so-airy fragrance of orchids , the less glamorous scents of livestock . And then , of course , there are the items for_sale . The Christmas packages I recently wrapped were_full of them : antique jade dragons and hand-painted perfume bottles from Hong Kong , handcrafted belts from Guatemala , miniature statues from Bolivia , wooden musical_instruments from Thailand , wooden ornaments from Mexico , all marking traditions far different from my own . My apartment overflows -- with weavings crafted by careful hands through countless days , amulets promising good_health and fortune , masks signifying hundreds of years of traditions . My wardrobe is packed with shirts and sweaters purchased on the streets at a fraction of their U.S. cost . . . . But it ' s the people I really go_to see . Markets are living museums , portals to local lifestyles outside the usual tourist experience . Conversation comes easily with eager sellers ; when we don ' t share a language , we simply smile and gesture , depending_upon calculators to indicate price . In Tibet , for instance , a friend and I had long , laughing &quot; chats &quot; with colorfully dressed women who scoffed at the cheap cosmetics we offered to trade them and instead chose samples of expensive , designer perfumes . I often can learn about a country from the way the vendors bargain , bicker and trade goods . Those with little will settle for almost nothing ; those with more will refuse to go too low . In some places it is a laughable game ; in others , business is downright cutthroat . And buying leather sandals as a free-roaming cow looks_on , as I have in India , is about as cultural an experience as I can imagine . ( In the Hindu religion , cows are sacred , left to wander through markets , railway_stations and even homes. ) Many worthwhile markets are unmentioned here . Some -- such_as Otavalo in Ecuador and the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul -- I have yet to see . Maybe it ' s time for another run_out to the market . BANGKOK ' S WEEKEND MARKET That strange reed contraption covered with beads and one-inch , silver-colored balls is not somebody ' s idea of a bizarre holiday decoration . No , that thing on my wall is actually a tribal headdress from northern Thailand . When I first visited Thailand five years ago , I went trekking in this region , staying in the homes of tribeswomen who wore such extraordinary headgear above the odd combination of hand-woven skirts and Nike T-shirts . I was too shy -- or too foolish -- to buy a headdress from these people , but when I spotted them earlier this year at Bangkok ' s Weekend Market for $ 22 , I couldn ' t resist . Ditto the wooden musical flute ( $ 16 ) , the fanciful puppet with a beard made of real hair ( $ 15 ) , the hand-carved Burmese figures dressed in sequined jackets ( $ 4 ) . Bangkok is home to so many markets that there ' s a special map to find your way around them -- Nancy Chandler ' s Map of Bangkok : The Market Map and Much More ( sold at tourist haunts in Bangkok ) . One section specializes in Buddha images , another in cheap clothes . I was disappointed to find that two of my favorites , the orchid market , with its blocks of fresh blooms , and the Thieves Market , filled with furniture and housewares , seemed to be shadows of their old selves . But the Weekend Market , near the northern bus_terminal , was as jam-packed as ever . The place sprawls , as unstoppable as science_fiction ' s &quot; The Thing , &quot; in makeshift stalls and more permanent booths . Anything you can think_of is probably there somewhere : cocktail clothes and T-shirts , fish for the aquarium and fish for dinner , semiprecious beads and stones , antiques and handicrafts . Despite its name , the market is open daily . PIKE PLACE MARKET , SEATTLE As a child I was enthralled by the baskets of polished vegetables and the overall-covered folks who sold them at the local farmers ' market . I ' m still fascinated . . . all_the more so when a market includes sea creatures and fresh eats . Apparently , I ' m not alone . One of the last authentic farmers ' markets in America , Pike Place Market draws 9 million visitors a year , making_it one of Seattle ' s top tourist attractions . Piles of tomatoes , apples , lettuce , cherries , beets , beans , radishes and eggplant line the unheated halls of this 1907 structure , brought by the farmers who have grown them . But the big draw is seafood . Massive king_salmon , as big as 50 pounds , and giant geoduck clams sit upon mounds of ice . Dungeness crabs , the local specialty , are artfully arranged ; hand-drawn signs advertise them at $ 3.49 per pound , cooked . The salesmen often put_on a show , calling to each other and flinging their catch over the heads of watching visitors . There are trendy restaurants there , but though the day was cold we opted for a little outdoor stand called Jack ' s Fish and Chip Spot . The shrimp and crab were_well worth the chill , which gave my sweetheart and me a chance to snuggle a little , anyway . MACAU FISH MARKET In theory , the fish market in Macau might sound a bit like Pike Place . It is not . For one thing , there are no tourist shops or restaurants , no chic coffees . What ' s more , many of the offerings are still alive . Macau , near Hong Kong , is a colonial outpost ( Portugal will turn it over to the Chinese at century ' s end ) turned gambling town , and most tourists head straight for the casinos and European-style historic sites . My friend , Stetson , and I followed a resident and ended_up in the market , an entirely Chinese place filled exclusively with locals . And what fun ! As the only tourists -- and the only Westerners -- in_sight , we were a great curiosity . The fishmongers joked for our cameras , hoisting frogs the size of a head of lettuce , squirming eels and wiggling fish and pretending to toss them in our direction . Grouper the size of a family dog leered at us from beds of ice . Creatures unlike anything found in American waters crawled through plastic bins gurgling with water . Some looked quite scary , and even if I ' d been visiting for practical reasons instead of for ambience , I would n ' t have bought any of these very strange things . Of course , it ' s better to eat than to be eaten . PORTOBELLO ROAD , LONDON England is a stolid place , where the rule_of_thumb has long been &quot; older is better. &quot; No place is this more evident than on London ' s Portobello Road , where vendors set_up each Saturday to display the revered remains of days gone_by . The area is_best known for its silver , often tucked_in indoor mazes of tiny stalls . There are few bargains , however ; my mother and I found lower prices on old silver in the Cotswolds , last spring . In London , the market at Camden Passage on Saturdays , Wednesdays and Thursdays also specializes in collectibles and is preferred by some to Portobello Road . Visitors will find few goods that are new , though a_few vendors sell casual clothes made in India . That -- along with turbaned vendors and Middle Eastern accents -- remind one of England ' s colonial past and the fact that even England changes , after all . Still , some things are immutable . And when the feet grow weary , a proper cuppa English tea is only a step away . HONG KONG ' S JADE MARKET One splendid exception to Hong Kong ' s high-price shopping is the daily Jade Market , tucked beneath a freeway under a canopy of tents in Kowloon . Here , beads , discs , rings and amulets are tossed into baskets or piled high upon the floor . They are priced about $ 1.50 each , though one must bargain and bargain hard , and not be persuaded by those silvery words , &quot; Special price for you , lady. &quot; Earrings and necklaces in malachite , lapis_lazuli and other semiprecious stones sell for about $ 10 , and freshwater pearls are abundant . Some of the most fascinating pieces are the old bits of jade -- aged , imperfect beads ; carvings of monkeys , Buddhas and mythical_creatures ; smoking pipes -- which may run to $ 50 or more . CHICHICASTENANGO , GUATEMALA Intriguing religious_ceremonies that mix Mayan traditions with Catholicism are one reason to visit Chichicastenango in Guatemala . The other is the market that is said to have been meeting regularly for 1 # 000 years . Thankfully , the two can coincide . Ceremonies take_place on Saturday evening , about sundown , and early Sunday morning . The market is Sunday and Thursday . We bought rough-hewn , hand-carved statues of saints , wooden masks , splendid weavings , hand-tooled belts , leather hair bands , whimsical jewelry , bright woven purses , pot holders , aprons and children ' s outfits . Most items cost less than $ 10 , though a very fine antique mask and an exquisite weaving were closer to $ 100 . As the day grows older , the twisting little rows become so packed with shoppers that forward_motion is impossible . We are gone_by noon -- our car full , our pockets empty . BOLIVIAN WITCHES ' MARKET The idea of offering a dried llama fetus to the Pachamama may seem both bizarre and gruesome to microchip sensibilities , but in La Paz , Bolivia , it seems neither . Not bizarre , because making a present to the Mother Earth seems an oddly fitting thing to do_in one of the Earth ' s highest cities ( 11 # 000 to 13 # 000 feet above sea_level ) . Not gruesome , because it turns_out that llamas self-abort when they become pregnant with more babies than they can carry_to_term , and because once dried , these fetuses look_like a mere twist and tangle of sticks . If the idea appeals_to you -- or if you are simply curious , as my friend and I were -- you can check_out these and other offerings to the Pachamama , along with amulets and medicinal herbs , along Linares Street , also known as the Witches ' Market . I expected some impressive gathering of herbalists and was disappointed ; the stalls that hawk these mystical herbs are simple stands set_up occasionally along several blocks between shops touting more &quot; regular &quot; souvenirs : leather jackets , alpaca sweaters , weavings , leather purses , traditional musical_instruments called charangas . But a closer look_at the herb stands -- and some explanation about their use -- reveals a little of the fascinating mysticism that thrives on Bolivia ' s Altiplano . Certain amulets improve your chances for love ; others are used to bring trials to your enemies . If your lungs are weak , try baked garlic ; if your head_aches , eat cooked corn . If you opt_for the more traditional crafts shops in this area , remember that vicuna and several species of armadillo ( used to make the fancier charangas ) are endangered and may_not be brought into the United States . TIBET ' S BARKHOR BAZAAR The Barkhor Bazaar is more_than just a shopping area ; it ' s a religious experience . Literally . The bazaar encircles the Jokhang , the holiest of all Lamaist temples in Tibet , located in central Lhasa . Pilgrims flock to the Jokhang from across Tibet to prostrate themselves , light candles and chant . And to circumambulate -- which is a fancy way of saying that they walk_around the temple chanting their prayers , counting their prayer beads and spinning their prayer_wheels . As tourists , my friend and I did far more shopping than praying . We spent countless hours joyously sifting through elaborate teapots carved from yak bone , curly-toed boots made from yak hide , old brass bits of bowls and locks , hand-painted religious paintings called thangkas ( prices vary ) , prayer beads , tapestries , coral jewelry , brocade hats lined with fur . Though small items cost only a_few dollars , the elaborately carved teapot and fine jewelry cost closer to $ 75 . We bought plenty -- truthfully , too_much . But what we hold most dear are memories of the people we met there : country women in colorful garb who danced each afternoon , young city women with turquoise woven into their hair who tried to sell us their jewelry , a poor but proud pilgrim who sold us his prayer beads to raise enough money to get_back home . Where can you wear yak boots , anyway ?</TEXT>
