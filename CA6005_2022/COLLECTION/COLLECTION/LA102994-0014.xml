   <HEADLINE> DON ' T REWARD A TERRORIST STATE ; SYRIA MUST END ITS CONNECTION TO ATROCITIES BEFORE WASHINGTON GRANTS ANY CONCESSIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Given the chance to condemn terrorism publicly during his joint news_conference with President Clinton in Damascus this week , Syria ' s President Hafez Assad chose instead to maintain an aloof silence . Asked about his own country ' s role in sponsoring and harboring terrorists , he could do no better than lamely assert that no one can prove Syria ' s guilt in these matters . These are not encouraging responses from the leader of a country that , this year as in years past , occupies a lead place on the State_Department ' s list of countries involved in terrorism . That Syria is officially and rightly condemned for state terrorism means that Clinton assumed certain political risks when he decided to honor Assad by visiting him in his capital . Assad , while clearly relishing the honor , did nothing , however , to help_out his visitor . Assad even denied that the subject of Syria ' s terrorism came_up in his three or four hours of talks with Clinton . Clinton himself indicated the issue did too come_up , but he does not seem to have pressed it forcefully . No doubt his rationale was that in the limited time available he wanted to focus_on what Syria could do to move its peace negotiations with Israel along . Still , it ' s obvious Clinton missed a rare opportunity to make clear in plain and vigorous language that so_long as Syria continues to play the terrorism game its relations with the United States will suffer . It has been left to others to make that point , most immediately to Sens . Patrick J . Leahy ( D-Vt. ) , a member of the Foreign Relations Committee , and Dennis DeConcini ( D-Ariz. ) , who is_on the Intelligence Committee . Both men accompanied Clinton to Damascus . Both also indicated after the Clinton-Assad meeting that they will oppose better relations with Syria until Assad acts to shut_down the terrorist groups whose headquarters he permits in Damascus and Hezbollah , which operates out of Syrian-controlled southern Lebanon and which still receives a steady flow of Syrian arms and explosives . Assad has always been shrewd in keeping his options open . Presumably he continues to regard Syria ' s association with terrorism -- something that burnishes his own credentials among Arabs as a radical activist -- as one more card to play in the long poker_game of Middle_East politics . If he ever gives it up it will be in exchange for something of high value . In fact he has things backward . What Washington should make emphatically clear is that first Syria must end its involvement with terrorism , then it will be possible to consider a closer bilateral relationship . It ' s regrettable that in this , the second face-to-face meeting he has had with Assad since becoming President , Clinton didn ' t seize the chance to deliver that message unambiguously .</TEXT>
