   <HEADLINE> SERBIAN GUNMEN POISED TO OVERRUN BESIEGED ENCLAVE ; BOSNIA : MUSLIM GOVERNMENT DENOUNCES U.N. ' S UNWILLINGNESS TO USE FORCE AGAINST GORAZDE ' S ATTACKERS . PEACEKEEPING MISSION IN CRISIS AFTER OFFICER IS KILLED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Serb forces crushed government defense lines around Gorazde in a massive attack Friday that killed a British special forces officer and plunged the U.N. mission into a crisis over whether to abandon the proclaimed safe area on the verge of collapse . The Bosnian government accused the United Nations of signing Gorazde ' s death_warrant and betraying the very people whom the peacekeeping mission was sent to protect . &quot; They are scared to death of the thugs in the mountains . We are not , &quot; Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic angrily pronounced after Yasushi Akashi , the civilian chief of the U.N. Protection Force , made_it clear that he was not prepared to use force against the Serbian gunmen poised to overrun Gorazde . Silajdzic said he had been reliably informed that the U.N. commander for Bosnia , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , had appealed for further NATO bombings after two British officers deployed as forward air commanders were wounded by the Serbian onslaught around 5 p.m. But Akashi was in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale at the time and chose to pursue Serbian promises of a cease-fire instead , according to both Silajdzic and U.N. spokesman Dacre Holloway . At one point , Rose ordered the evacuation of all U.N. military and relief workers from the besieged enclave . He then reversed course and told crews of two helicopters dispatched to Gorazde to bring_out only one of the two wounded British officers . The evacuated soldier was later pronounced dead . Holloway said the nine remaining U.N. troops were being left in Gorazde &quot; for the moment &quot; because the city was still in government hands . The initial pullout order suggested that the U.N. mission was willing to risk a Serbian conquest of Gorazde rather than rile Bosnian Serb gunmen who have taken more_than 200 U.N. troops captive in retaliation for air strikes by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . Gorazde , a refugee-packed town of 65 # 000 , is one of six U.N.-designated safe zones for the victims of the 2-year-old Serbian nationalist siege . &quot; The Serbs are_on the edge of town . The situation is very serious . It ' s possible the Serbs will take the town in the very near future , &quot; Holloway said . The reports from U.N. and Bosnian officials indicated that an internal conflict has erupted within the peacekeeping mission , which earlier this week called_in NATO air strikes against Serbian ground forces for the first time in the conflict . At a volatile midnight news_conference that Rose called_off after less than five minutes , Akashi praised the Serbs who had mortally wounded the_British soldier for facilitating his evacuation . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic assured Akashi that his gunmen would hold their fire while the United Nations pulled its soldiers and aid workers out , the mission chief reported . But Lt . Romain Kuntz , the_French helicopter pilot who flew the evacuation mission , said his Puma aircraft was fired on as it lifted_off from Gorazde . He told reporters at the hospital helipad here that he had seen heavy fighting , mortar and artillery_fire across a wide arc near the enclave . Akashi , who has the final word on the military plans drafted by Rose , denied reports that he had rejected air strikes . He declined to answer when asked if the U.N. mission has become reluctant to resort_to force again because the Serbian gunmen ringing Sarajevo might retaliate against U.N. troops taken captive over the last three days . Since NATO jets destroyed two Serbian tank positions Sunday and Monday , Karadzic and his hard-line military chief , Gen . Ratko Mladic , have condemned the U.N. mission as an aggressor and announced that they are severing contacts with the peacekeeping force . The detentions and booby_traps set_up around U.N. facilities have provided the nationalist commanders with a human shield they apparently are counting_on to deter further air strikes . Maj . Rob Annink , chief spokesman for the 13 # 000-strong U.N. contingent in Bosnia , had acknowledged earlier Friday that the Serbs had likely nabbed U.N. personnel for their own protection . &quot; We feel they want to have some sort of deterrence against another use of air_force by NATO , &quot; he said . Even after a French NATO jet was hit by ground_fire while flying a reconnaissance mission over Gorazde and the two British officers were wounded by the Serbs , U.N. officials said the mission commander continued to prefer negotiations over force . NATO ' s Southern European Command headquarters in Naples , Italy , reported that a French reconnaissance aircraft was hit in the tail by antiaircraft_fire but returned safely to the aircraft_carrier Clemenceau in the Adriatic . U.N. aid workers in Gorazde reported unrelenting shelling of the town , contradicting U.N. reports from the public affairs office in Sarajevo claiming that hostilities had died_down . Bosnian radio claimed that Serbs were moving heavy artillery back into the 12-mile exclusion zone declared around Sarajevo after a NATO ultimatum in February forced the rebels to pull_back the weapons with which they had bombarded the capital for two years . U.N. spokesmen said they had no corroborating reports of such redeployments but confirmed a marked increase in small-arms and sniper fire . After four civilians were felled by snipers firing on the city ' s recently reactivated central tram line , that transportation service was shut_down again in a telling admission of defeat . Akashi had spent several hours in Pale in an attempt to resurrect peace negotiations that had dragged_on for nearly two years and were ruptured by the Serbs in anger at being targeted for air strikes . Serbian media had been reporting an imminent breakthrough on a cease-fire that the rebels had proposed in hopes of freezing the territorial status_quo , which would leave them with more_than 70 % of Bosnian territory . But after word of the intensified Gorazde offensive reached Sarajevo , the optimistic tone of mission officials evaporated . Akashi issued another appeal_to the Serbs &quot; to cease hostilities in and around Gorazde , &quot; but another U.N. civilian lamented that a peace settlement &quot; has never seemed so far away. &quot; Another U.N. source noted that the continued presence of U.N. forces in the battle zone gave the mission a stronger incentive to protect the enclave and that forward air controllers would be vital in the event further air strikes are called_for . The U.N. Security_Council issued a non-binding statement Friday night , condemning the violence around Gorazde . But the world body did not mention punitive action or identify the Serbs as attackers . In Washington , Clinton_Administration officials said that NATO stands ready to launch air strikes if the United Nations asks_for them . &quot; We ' ve made_it clear that we stand_by our commitment &quot; to launch air strikes on request , State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said . &quot; We have not had any request from Gen . Rose. &quot; Meantime , U.S. officials sent strong warnings to the Serbs -- through the United Nations and Russia -- to call_off their offensive or face retaliation . &quot; There has been extensive diplomacy aimed at getting the Serbs to stop , &quot; he said . McCurry refused to say what the United States might do if the Serbs took Gorazde . Several officials said no major NATO military_action was imminent . Nor did Clinton convene any meetings with top advisers . But a senior official said Clinton ' s foreign_policy team began to discuss what to do next in a series of conference_calls Friday . Through most of the day , Clinton and other U.S. officials sought to downplay the prospect that Gorazde might fall or that the fighting might escalate . &quot; The United States has no interest in having NATO become involved in this war and trying to gain advantage for one side over the other , &quot; Clinton said at the White_House . &quot; So I ' d say our position is to be firm but not provocative , and not trying to change the military balance . We need to get the negotiations back on track. &quot; Times staff writer Doyle McManus in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
