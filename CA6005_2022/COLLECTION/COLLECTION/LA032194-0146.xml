   <HEADLINE> SPIRIT AWARDS -- A HOLLYWOOD MAVERICK GETS TAMED ; MOVIES : NINTH ANNUAL AWARD CEREMONIES FOR INDIE FILMS HAS SUBDUED ATMOSPHERE , MOST WINNERS MISSING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They held the Spirit Awards on Saturday for movies produced independent of Hollywood ' s mainstream film companies . But for the first time in its nine years , the spirit and spunk of the annual alternative to the Academy Awards seemed to be missing . What had been the maverick of awards shows has been tamed by the demands of the media , security and the sheer size of the crowd -- 1 # 200 Saturday at the Hollywood Paladium . Writer-actor Buck Henry ' s acerbic commentaries about Hollywood were absent too . Like actor-comedian Billy Crystal of the Oscar show , Henry , the Spirit Awards host for many years , bowed_out this year , Robert Townsend stepped_in . Missing too were many of the winners . Director Robert Altman ' s comic and biting &quot; Short Cuts &quot; was named best independently made American feature_film of 1993 , and producer Cary Brokaw accepted the award . Director Jane Campion ' s Gothic_romance , &quot; The Piano , &quot; picked_up the prize for best independent film made in another nation and producer Jan Chapman accepted the award . Altman and Campion are nominees for best director at tonight ' s Academy Awards , but on Saturday Altman was in France making his latest film &quot; Pret a Porter &quot; and Campion was in her native New Zealand . Absent also from Saturday ' s ceremonies , sponsored by the Independent Features Project West , was best actress winner Ashley Judd for her role in &quot; Ruby in Paradise. &quot; Lili Taylor , who appeared in &quot; Household Saints , &quot; and Christopher Lloyd , in &quot; Twenty Bucks , &quot; were named as best supporting actress and actor , but neither was present . A poignant factor that contributed to the subdued atmosphere this year was the recent death of young actor River Phoenix , who won the Spirit Award for best actor in 1992 ' s &quot; My Own Private Idaho. &quot; Phoenix was remembered in remarks by director Richard Benjamin . Still the Spirit Awards is the kind of event where Sean Penn and Sandra Bernhard made presentations . It drew Oscar nominees for best actress , Angela Bassett and Holly Hunter , directors Kenneth Branagh , Oliver Stone and keynote speaker Jim Sheridan ( &quot; My Left Foot &quot; and best picture Oscar nominee &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; ) . And director Jim Jarmusch received the Independent Features Project ' s John Cassavetes Award from actor John Turturro . It was an enthusiastic Jeff Bridges who took_the_stage to claim his best actor award , for his role as an ex-con in the film &quot; American Heart. &quot; &quot; Because it was an independent film , we didn ' t have to compromise our vision . We made the film that we set_out to make , &quot; Bridges said . &quot; Another reason this was such a gratifying experience for me was it was a chance to shed some light on a part of our society that doesn ' t get the light shed on it too often . . . that ' s the part of us who live below the poverty line. &quot; * Among other winners was the screenplay for &quot; Short Cuts , &quot; by Altman and Frank Barhydt , based on the stories by Raymond Carver . That gave &quot; Short Cuts , &quot; released by Fine Line Pictures , three awards , making_it the only multiple winner in this year ' s competition . The cinematography by Lisa Rinzler for &quot; Menace II Society &quot; was a winner too . Director Robert Rodriguez , whose videotape movie shot for $ 7 # 000 , &quot; El Mariachi , &quot; was picked_up for distribution by Columbia Pictures last year , summed_up the financial problems common to independent filmmakers , as he accepted the award for best first feature_film . He said when he learned that Columbia wanted to distribute the film just the way it was , rather than re-shoot it , he told executives : &quot; Look , if I had known people were going_to see it I would have done so many things differently. &quot; Then to much laughter , he added , &quot; . . . just give me $ 2 # 000 and I ' ll re-shoot half of it. &quot; In the end , Rodriguez told the audience : &quot; It really isn ' t the wallet that makes the movie . It ' s your creativity , your passion , your hard work. &quot;</TEXT>
