   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; CASHING IN ON THIGH ANXIETY ; AN L.A. DOCTOR AND ENTREPRENEUR HELPS TURN AN OBSCURE OINTMENT INTO A FLAB-REDUCTION INDUSTRY . BUT OUTSIDE RESEARCHERS DON ' T KNOW HOW -- OR EVEN IF -- THE STUFF WORKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Any time now it is coming -- a lotion that can painlessly , effectively melt flab from your stomach or your rump or your , well , you name it , without dieting or exercise . Sound incredible ? Not to Dr. Bruce M . Frome . Appearing on national TV last winter , the Los Angeles physician declared that he had developed just such a silver bullet of an ointment -- one that can , as he put it , remove &quot; as much weight as you want from anywhere you want to lose it. &quot; Frome assured celebrity interviewer Larry King that the product would hit the market within five years . But why was King discussing flab with a certified pain specialist and anesthesiologist ? Because Frome is the hurricane force behind thigh cream , an asthma medication-laced ointment touted as the cellulite cure-all women have been waiting for . Thigh creams didn ' t exist a year ago -- and they still have not been proven to work . The federal Food and Drug Administration , concerned that not enough is known about the product ' s effects , is monitoring thigh cream closely . But thanks in large part to Frome ' s energetic legwork , Skinny_Dip , Slim-Thigh and dozens of other brands , some based on the asthma drug and some not , have taken cosmetic counters by storm . Christian Dior has Svelte , a cellulite-buster for people with money to spend . Charlene Tilton , the chunky star of the old soap_opera &quot; Dallas , &quot; is pitching her own cream in an infomercial . The creams are so popular that &quot; they are no longer a fad , &quot; insists Howard Kay , an executive at a Los Angeles company called An-Kar that was among the first to jump into the business . Although not an expert on fat , Frome is a veteran entrepreneur . Over the last 20 years , he has tried his luck with photo-developing stores , a correspondence_school , an unconventional AIDS treatment and beachfront property -- with decidedly mixed success . He has been bankrupt twice and a millionaire several times over . But it is with thigh cream that Frome is making his biggest splash . With a series of whirlwind interviews and a trio of licensing deals , Frome has transformed the obscure ointment into an annual $ 150-million industry dedicated to sleeker thighs . He has made the rounds of national TV , appearing not just on King ' s show but also on &quot; Hard Copy &quot; and &quot; Good_Morning America. &quot; He has touted the cream in dozens of publications , ranging from Vogue to the National Enquirer . The weight-loss business has always been long on promises ; even so , Frome ' s pronouncements stand_out . Some women using the cream report larger breasts , Frome told the Enquirer . &quot; The fat , &quot; he said , &quot; has to go somewhere. &quot; The Canadian-born physician acquired rights to thigh cream from its two inventors two years ago and in turn licensed the formula to three companies : Herbalife , Nutra / Systems ' parent Heico Corp . and a Newport Beach start-up business called Right Solution . Together , the three companies account_for more_than 30 % of thigh cream sales , according to Frome . The creams have become the hottest addition to a cabinet full of cellulite &quot; cures , &quot; from plastic_surgery to thigh massage to other special ointments . All are part of the more_than $ 30 billion that weight-conscious Americans spend to look thinner each year . Frome says thigh cream hasn ' t put him in Fat City . In an interview three months ago , he declined to reveal how much he has made on the cream , but said : &quot; No one is getting rich. &quot; Between them , its inventors say they ' ve made just $ 5 # 000 in royalties , though millions of tubes have been sold . And what are women buying for $ 12 to $ 45 a jar ? Its developers contend that the cream can shed an inch of fat from thighs -- &quot; not enough to make you look twice , &quot; admits co-developer Dr. Frank L . Greenway , a Marina del Rey endocrinologist . Thighs return to their former size once you stop using the cream , he says . And there is a ferocious debate among researchers over whether thigh creams do even that much . Scientists have known for a decade that , under the right conditions , the asthma medication in the cream -- and substances like it -- can reduce the size of fat_cells in the laboratory . But no one knows what they do inside the body . Thigh cream ' s developers -- Greenway and Dr. George Bray , director of Louisiana State University ' s Pennington Biomedical Research Institute -- measured thigh circumference in one study , but did not look_at what happened to fat_cells inside the body . When testing their concoction on women volunteers , the doctors did not measure changes in body fat . Nor did they try to find_out whether the cream reaches fat_cells . Greenway said he and Bray did not do the tests because they are expensive . ( He said the pair funded the experiments themselves ) . In any event , they are clearly irritated with doubters . &quot; It is my hypothesis that it works , &quot; Bray says . &quot; I can ' t prove it , but I believe it does. &quot; Other scientists say that without additional testing , the thigh cream phenomenon is based on incomplete research . &quot; I ' ve said to myself , ' Why didn ' t they at least do a pinch test -- something ? ' &quot; said Gilbert Kaats , a researcher who is trying to duplicate the results at his San Antonio laboratory . &quot; It ' s hard to understand. &quot; Patrick O ' Neil , a weight-loss expert at the Medical University of South Carolina , is among those who speculate that the cream reduces water in the body , not fat . Aminophylline , the asthma drug in thigh cream , is a diuretic . Dr. Jules Hirsch , an obesity expert at Rockefeller University in New York , sees no proof that the cream does anything . &quot; I ' m not for it or against it , but I ' d like to see some evidence , &quot; he says . &quot; What I ' ve seen so far is a lot of hand waving. &quot; Frome straddles the scientific debate , contending that the cream breaks_up water or fat , depending_on the strength of the formula . He says 2 % -aminophylline formulas melt fat , while less powerful formulas drain water . But no matter how they work , Frome says , the result is the same . The creams reduce the appearance of cellulite , &quot; smoothing the_hills and valleys , &quot; he says . &quot; I can ' t tell by looking if someone has reduced their girth , &quot; Frome says . &quot; But I can tell if their skin is nice and smooth or dimpled and cottage cheese-looking. &quot; Some women seem to believe the creams do something . &quot; Thank_you for a real product that works ! &quot; a Texas woman said in her letter to a Chicago company . Crowed another writer : &quot; I believe the cream has made a difference . . . . As soon as I get more , I ' m going_to give some to my mother so she can try it. &quot; Thigh cream first received attention a year ago when Greenway and Bray presented their work_at an obesity conference in Milwaukee . The doctors ' one-page abstract -- widely reported in the media -- said that 11 of 12 women using their cream for five weeks shed an inch from their thighs . Greenway credits Frome with funding the effort to find a suitable cream to mix with aminophylline . The original formula was greasy , Greenway says , and women in the test complained that it &quot; messed_up their sheets and bedclothes. &quot; Thigh cream companies cannot claim the products reduce fat or cellulite without running_into problems with the FDA . The agency says any product that claims to make changes below the skin must be approved as a drug -- a process that may take_up to 12 years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars . Consequently , thigh cream makers stress its superficial , cosmetic effects . The label on Herbalife ' s cream , for example , says the product &quot; promotes a feeling of silky suppleness , &quot; giving the skin &quot; a sleek , youthful appearance. &quot; However , in response to questions about the cream , two Herbalife salespeople provided copies of a National Enquirer story with the headline : &quot; Amazing cream slims thighs in just 5 weeks ! &quot; Frome has gone_to court to prevent unlicensed companies from citing research on the cream as a marketing hook . Earlier this year , he obtained an order in Los Angeles federal_court barring Neways , the Utah firm that sells Skinny_Dip , from citing the Bray and Greenway study in its advertising . Neways President Tom Mower has denied additional allegations about misleading advertising and unfair competition . A lawsuit is ongoing . * Just who is the man behind the svelte promises ? Frome received his medical degree from the University of Manitoba in 1962 and came_to Los Angeles to complete his training at what is now County-USC Medical_Center . He eventually joined the staff of Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey , serving as its chief of anesthesiology in 1987-88 . Besides medicine , Frome pursued his avocation -- deal-making . In the 1970s , he headed a clinic that served the poor under a pilot Medi-Cal program . When it failed , Frome helped to establish the University of Beverly Hills , an unaccredited correspondence_school . It was sold at_a_loss . Then he founded Fromex , a chain of one-hour photo-processing stores that expanded to 56 outlets from New York and Florida to Hawaii before filing for bankruptcy liquidation in 1983 . When creditors demanded that Frome make_good on personal guarantees for Fromex ' s debt , he sought personal bankruptcy protection . He eventually agreed to pay $ 60 # 000 to satisfy $ 3 million in claims . Recovering from that disaster , Frome started a medical clinic in Marina del Rey that specialized in workers ' compensation cases . He aggressively built the business , sending a van as far as Bakersfield to pick_up patients . He sold the clinic in 1990 , but stayed_on to run it as the new owner ' s vice_president of medical affairs . He received a $ 6-million severance payment when Premier Anesthesia of Atlanta acquired the clinic ' s parent company in 1992 . Frome now runs a pain clinic in Beverly Hills where he has explored biofeedback therapy and offered some unorthodox treatments . Last year , he administered electric_shocks to AIDS patients to relieve their symptoms . Experts questioned the value of the therapy , which Frome has abandoned . He also recently patented the concept of using a specific geranium oil as a topical_anesthetic . In his patent_application , Frome said he had tried the oil on 200 patients with success . Dr. Stephen August , a Los Angeles physician who has known him for years , says Frome is a consummate salesman , whether pitching thigh cream , photo stores or condo deals . &quot; He has a very outstanding ability to figure_out what people want and what to tell them . . . , &quot; said August , who lost about $ 50 # 000 investing in Fromex . &quot; He disarms you . He ' s very convincing. &quot; Frome ' s business career has not been without controversy . In a lawsuit over unpaid wages , an acupuncturist from the Marina del Rey clinic charged that Frome &quot; converted funds to his own use and ( his ) medical corporation to solve cash-flow needs and problems. &quot; Frome denied the allegations ; the woman said she accepted half the $ 70 # 000 she sought to settle the case . In December , 1992 , the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office raided Frome ' s Marina del Rey clinic as part of an investigation of workers ' compensation fraud . No charges have been filed as a result of that probe , which is continuing . Through his attorney , the once-accessible Frome declined to discuss his business history after freely talking_about thigh cream in an earlier interview . He recently retained the prominent Santa Monica criminal_law firm of Chaleff , English &amp; Catalano . Attorney Audrey Winograde said Frome hired the firm because of its expertise in administrative matters . Frome has loyal defenders . Retired surgeon Dr. Theodore Haller , a longtime friend who lost money investing in the University of Beverly Hills , said Frome is a victim of people who are envious of his success . &quot; Bruce is a front-runner , &quot; said Haller . &quot; When you ' re out_in front , the people behind attack you. &quot; * It won ' t be easy for Frome to stay out_in front in his latest endeavor . His licensees say they are losing sales as competing thigh creams become more available in traditional retail outlets . Mark Guest , director of operations for Right Solution , said sales are down 40 % from eight months ago and that the company has lost much of its sales force . Right Solution is a multilevel marketing company that , like Amway and similar firms , sells to customers through a network of sales people . Meanwhile , Heico executive Vince Diraddo said a flood of new brands has forced his company to take two price_cuts . A four-ounce tube that sold for $ 39.95 in January goes_for $ 19.95. Heico sells its thigh cream through Nutra / Systems and several dozen beauty supply stores . The third licensee , Herbalife , also a multilevel marketer , declined comment on thigh cream sales . Meanwhile , cracks are developing in Frome ' s alliance with the thigh cream ' s developers . Greenway says he is displeased with how the cream is being marketed , although he says his deal with Frome does not allow him to interfere . He said Herbalife ' s product contains rose hips , magnolia blossoms , horsetail and other herbs not in the original formula . And Right Solution ' s formula contains four times more aminophylline than Heico ' s cream . Greenway said that in tests he and Bray conducted , one of 12 women using the cream developed a rash with the stronger solution . &quot; It seems to me that if we found a formula that was safe and effective , people would n ' t want to go screwing around with it , &quot; Greenway said . Guest referred inquiries to Right Solution ' s public relations representative or its president , neither of whom returned calls . Another lingering question about thigh cream is the result of long-term use . Bray and Greenway ' s study spanned five weeks , not long enough to assess the effect of daily use , government regulators and obesity experts say . The FDA is concerned about the possibility that frequent users may develop an allergy to aminophylline . While most people could stop using the cream , an asthmatic who developed an allergy no longer would be able to take aminophylline to relieve attacks , said John Bailey , director of the FDA ' s office of cosmetics and colors . In addition , he said , the agency is unhappy that the cream contains a prescription_drug that never has been used as a cosmetic -- an action without precedent in the cosmetic business . Bailey said the agency is monitoring the cream closely , reviewing claims made by manufacturers and checking reports of adverse reactions . So far , he said , there have been only temporary skin_rashes . The FDA cannot recall a cosmetic unless there is evidence it is harmful . Dr. Hirsch , the Rockefeller University expert , argues that even if -- a big if , he says -- the thigh creams work , fat_cells will eventually adjust to daily does of aminophylline . At some point , he says , the cream would become ineffective . Would that change the looks of the thigh cream business ? It ' s hard to say . The creams are marketed as cosmetics , Frome notes , not as miracle drugs . And by definition , he says , &quot; cosmetics aren ' t supposed to work. &quot; The Frome File Los Angeles anesthesiologist Dr. Bruce M . Frome has been an aggressive entrepreneur , both in medicine and unrelated fields . Some key points in his business career : 1971 : Heads group that forms Marvin Medical , a practice catering to Medi-Cal patients . Financial problems cause it to seek bankruptcy protection in 1975 . ( Frome sought personal bankruptcy protection in 1974. ) 1978 : University of Beverly Hills , an unaccredited correspondence_school , opens with Frome as investor . 1980 : Forms Fromex one-hour photo stores . After expanding to more_than 50 stores , the company is forced to seek bankruptcy protection in 1983 . Frome again files for personal bankruptcy . 1987 : Frome opens pain clinic with two other doctors in Marina del Rey . He buys_out his partners in 1990 and later that year sells the assets to National Pain Institute , staying_on as an NPI vice_president . 1992 : The Los Angeles County District Atty. ' s office raids the Marina del Rey clinic as part of criminal investigation into workers ' compensation fraud . Frome later receives an estimated $ 6 million when NPI is acquired by Premier Anesthesia of Atlanta . 1994 : Thigh creams hit the market , with Frome leading publicity wave . Frome owns_rights to the &quot; original &quot; cream , which he has licensed to three other companies .</TEXT>
