   <HEADLINE> ART NOTES : SAN DIEGO ENTERS THE DIGITAL AGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The San Diego Museum of Art will join the digital age on Wednesday with a public unveiling of its Interactive Multimedia Art_Gallery Explorer ( IMAGE ) Gallery . Visitors to the new first-floor installation will find a series of information_systems equipped with Macintosh Power PCs that offer easy access to 300 works in the museum ' s collection . As is typical of interactive programs that are moving_into art museums all across the nation , from the Minneapolis Institute of Arts to the Seattle Art Museum , no computer expertise is required to use IMAGE Gallery . By merely touching the screen , visitors can conduct research on artists , see magnified details of artworks , determine the size of a work compared to a human figure , hear foreign names pronounced , create personal tours of the museum and print maps of their routes . &quot; If all people know about art is that they like flowers , they can call_up that subject and learn something about 17th-Century Dutch still-life painting , &quot; says Holly Witchy , SDMA ' s associate curator of European art and supervisor of the project . &quot; This offers people an opportunity to learn about things that they themselves choose. &quot; To allay curators ' fears that visitors will be so fascinated with the computers , they will ignore the actual art , IMAGE Gallery &quot; is completely driven by making you want to go upstairs to look_at the art , &quot; she says . Two-hundred artworks in the program were selected by curators . The remaining 100 were chosen for their educational value and popularity . Other pieces will be added in the future , Witchy says . IMAGE Gallery was conceived when museum trustee Maurice C . Kaplan saw Micro Gallery at London ' s National Gallery of Art and offered to help finance a similar interactive computer guide at the San Diego museum . The Getty Grant Program awarded $ 100 # 000 to the project , through a program that aims to enhance the role of art museums in public education . The software was developed by Cognitive Applications Ltd. , creator of London ' s Micro Gallery and a similar system that ' s in the works_at the National Gallery of Art in Washington . VITAL SIGNS : As Bergamot Station continues to attract crowds to the sprawling new art complex in Santa Monica , gallery life goes_on in West Hollywood . Among this week ' s happenings , dealer Louis Stern -- who closed his Beverly Hills gallery last spring -- is hosting his first show in a space he now shares with the Jan Abrams Gallery . The exhibition , opening Wednesday , features surrealistic paintings by Richard Baker . Stern is also planning an exhibition of drawings , &quot; The Classical Line , &quot; to be curated by Josine Ianco Starrels . Maintaining two galleries under one roof , Stern and Abrams will present separate exhibitions on an alternating schedule , but may collaborate in the future . Three other galleries have openings scheduled in the neighborhood on Saturday : &quot; Michael Goldberg Paintings : 1951-1961 &quot; at the Manny Silverman Gallery , &quot; Tim Burton : The Museum of Unnatural History &quot; at Thomas Solomon ' s Garage , and &quot; Jay DeFeo : Drawings and Photo Collages From the 1970s &quot; and &quot; George Herms : Project X &quot; at the Kohn Turner Gallery . Kohn Turner will also show a sampling of artists ' books from Lapis Press , a Venice-based book publishing_company owned by artist Sam Francis and directed by Robert Shapazian . The press recently won New York Art_Directors awards for art direction and book design -- the latest of 20 major design awards claimed by Lapis . Meanwhile , Louis Stern ' s brother , a specialist in American art from 1890 through World_War_II , is moving his gallery from Encino to West Hollywood . George Stern is planning to launch his new space , at 8920 Melrose Ave. , around the first of November with a show of early California Impressionism . His second exhibition , slated to open Dec . 3 , will feature contemporary paintings by Santa Barbara artist John Comer . RARE ADDITION : A bound album of drawings by French neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David ( 1748-1825 ) is the latest acquisition of the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities . Purchased at an undisclosed price , the rare work -- one of 12 similar albums , only five of which remain intact -- contains 98 drawings made in Italy and pasted into a bound volume . Subjects include antique sculptures and reliefs in Roman collections , studies of Old_Master artworks , Italian landscapes and views of Rome . David made most of the drawings during his first sojourn in Italy , in 1775-81 as a recipient of the Prix de Rome . MANNA FROM THE IMS : Five Southern California art museums have received grants for general operating expenses from the Institute of Museum Services , an independent branch of the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities . The Armory Center for the Arts and the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena , the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana and the University Art Museum at UC Santa Barbara were awarded $ 112 # 500 each , while the Santa Monica Museum of Art received $ 65 # 000 . In another round of IMS grants , designated for conservation projects , UCLA ' s Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts won $ 5 # 275 to treat 13 prints by Henri Matisse . NORTON CURATORS : The Peter Norton Foundation has awarded its 1994 Curator ' s Grants to Amada Cruz of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington and Susan Krane of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta . The Los Angeles-based foundation presents the $ 50 # 000 grants annually to be used for the acquisition of contemporary art by the institutions that employ the winning curators . Cruz , a 1983 graduate of New York University , has been associate curator at the Hirshhorn since 1989 . She co-organized the traveling exhibition &quot; Felix Gonzalez-Torres , &quot; which appeared at Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art last spring . Krane , who received a master ' s degree in art from Columbia University in 1978 , has organized a variety of exhibitions , including &quot; Equal Rights and Justice &quot; ( 1994 ) , &quot; Max Weber : The Cubist Decade , 1910-1920 &quot; ( 1992 ) and &quot; Lynda Benglis : Dual Natures &quot; ( 1991 ) . *</TEXT>
