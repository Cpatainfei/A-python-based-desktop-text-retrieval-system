   <HEADLINE> WALTER MOSLEY ' S SECRET STORIES ; A RIDE WITH A MYSTERY WRITER WHO EVOKES THE UNCLICHED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Midafternoon , and we are sailing . The wide span of Century Boulevard seems vast in its possibilities , a seductive expanse with room to roam or expand . At quick glimpse , it is sparkling , but a brief pause at a light reveals something quite different -- a poorly patched facade , a wall of chain link encircling nothing , rubble from some long-lost decade left to rot or rust . &quot; Look_at these giant streets ! &quot; Walter Mosley rides jump_seat , taking_in L.A. the way many Angelenos do , at 45-miles-per , the window raised , studying the blur of color and shapes skidding outside the windshield . We make a left onto Central Avenue , slowing enough to see features on figures sitting in Will Rogers Park . Picnics . A ballgame . Families , black and brown , taking_advantage of the sun , the air carrying a cool mist that , with imagination , could conjure the nearby ocean . &quot; These houses are nice -- they ' re little , tiny , &quot; he says . &quot; A lot of people come here and say : ' When are we gonna get_to the bad community ? ' &quot; The answer comes_in a voice colored the softest shade of irony : &quot; You ' re in it , brother. &quot; At the tip of 76th Place and Central slumps the shell of a broken and singed mini-mall threatening complete collapse . The All-American Liquor Junior Market ' s marquee still advertises &quot; Hot dogs $ 2.50 , &quot; as if the building is only momentarily darkened , the owner under the weather or off on a brief vacation . And there are survivors -- fish markets , a shoeshine parlor-cum-barbershop , a senior_citizen center , the Universal Missionary Baptist_Church , all grouped around empty lots strewn with trash and weeds . Mosley grew_up here , and he ' s been mining these broad streets , and their smaller side arteries , for stories for nearly half_a_dozen years . But at first , he doesn ' t seem to register the damaged terrain . Or doesn ' t speak about it . He ' s busier reconstructing the past , letting the vacant_lots spark a fragment of a memory , reading the symbols in piles of wood and iron . &quot; When I was a kid along ( this stretch of Central ) , there was a White Front , a hardware_store , a liquor_store , little markets and bars , a shoe_store , television repair_shops , a whole economic community , &quot; he recalls , his voice moving with a bit of a rhythmic lilt . In moments , he erects filling stations in empty lots , replaces the nuclear-age post_office with the old Goodyear plant and a parking_lot full of gleaming tail_fins . Mosley ' s measure of fame comes from the detective_stories he ' s astutely woven from that vanished place . His mysteries are period works , spanning 1948-1961 on these streets -- Denker and Slauson and hot-lit Central Avenue -- where dreams and hard work intersect . And Ezekiel ( Easy ) Rawlins , his reluctant private_eye , navigates the hurdles of this world -- the Police_Department , the subtleties of discrimination , unabashed racism -- with both feet planted firmly on the sidewalks banking these wide boulevards . A protagonist acutely sensitive to the mercurial nature of his world , Easy ' s not quite a social commentator , nor an island of a private_eye like Philip Marlowe . Instead , he ' s at the center , struggling , hoping to make_it through one day into the next . Easy Rawlins is about to appear on film , played by Denzel Washington , as Carl Franklin ( &quot; One False Move &quot; ) directs &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress. &quot; &quot; Devil &quot; ( 1990 ) and Mosley ' s third book , &quot; White Butterfly &quot; ( 1992 ) , were nominated for Edgar awards ; &quot; Butterfly &quot; and his second , &quot; A Red Death &quot; ( 1991 ) , were nominated for Golden Dagger awards ( &quot; Butterfly &quot; won ) . President Bill_Clinton has proclaimed Mosley his favorite mystery writer , and his works -- which sell well but have not hit the bestseller charts -- pop_up on college reading lists with increasing frequency , surrounded by the works of Chester Himes , Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison , his most frequently cited literary forebears . The latest Rawlins installment , &quot; Black Betty , &quot; set at the dawn of the ' 60s , four years before Watts blew , is_due next month . L.A. itself , you could say , comes_to Mosley in a dream . He lives_in Greenwich_Village in New York , estranged from this city for more_than a decade -- L.A. was a claustrophobic web of the too-familiar and the unattainable , and he had to escape -- but he ' s never stopped feeling the pull of the city ' s possibilities . It ' s a somewhat idealized L.A. that Mosley creates in his books , patterned after the close , culturally diverse South Los Angeles community of his youth , not the alienating vastness he felt navigating through the rest of the city . He re-creates that early community , those connections , those voices , with memory , history and the grand stories of his late father , Leroy Mosley . The vision of Los Angeles that persists_in his writing is a clever variation on the one he remembers but is worlds apart from the one he confronts on brief visits . Though the city inhabits his heart and head , &quot; I don ' t get_it from L.A. , &quot; he says . &quot; I get_it from how I stand_in relation_to L.A. &quot; Writing_about Easy , he says , &quot; is in a way reclaiming experience. &quot; And in recasting the past , Mosley also lends a sense of clarity to the present -- and possibly the future . IT IS QUINTESSENTIAL RAYMOND CHANDLER : &quot; I WENT_ON OUT AND AMOS had the Caddy there waiting , &quot; Chandler ' s detective Philip Marlowe observes in &quot; The Long Goodbye. &quot; &quot; He drove me back to Hollywood . I offered him a buck but he would n ' t take it . I offered to buy him the poems of T.S. Eliot . He said he already had them. &quot; Amos , Chandler ' s &quot; middle-aged colored chauffeur , &quot; is a shadow figure whom Walter Mosley would eagerly give flesh and form . With lyric grace , Mosley has evoked many of those who passed_through in silence , subtly sketching faces and histories for figures that have appeared as ghosts in this genre . It ' s 1948 when Easy Rawlins , in Mosley ' s first installment , is laid_off from his aerospace job in Santa Monica . World_War_II had created a humming assembly_line of defense-industry jobs that helped fuel a mass migration west to fill them . But when an exhausted Easy refuses to put_in a little overtime after a particularly hard shift , his high-strung boss fires him , leaving Easy in a spot , unsure of how he ' ll raise his $ 64 mortgage payment . As he mulls it over in a neighborhood bar owned by an ex-boxer named Joppy , his answer sidles_up to him : DeWitt Albright , a white_man in a flashing white suit glaringly out_of_place in these environs , who knows a little too_much about Easy ' s private affairs but offers him fast money to a find a white_woman who &quot; has a predilection for the company of Negroes. &quot; It ' s Easy ' s chance out . &quot; Working for Joppy ' s friend was the only way I saw to keep my house . But there was something wrong , I could feel it in my fingertips . DeWitt Albright made me uneasy . . . . I was unhappy about going_to meet Mr. Albright because I wasn ' t used to going_into white communities like Santa Monica to conduct business , &quot; says Easy , &quot; . . . but the idea that I ' d give him the information he wanted , and that he ' d give me enough money to pay the next month ' s mortgage , made me happy . I was dreaming about the day I ' d be able to buy more houses , maybe even a duplex. &quot; Easy is the tangible , full-coverage insurance , the safety net , for his clients , Mosley explains . &quot; The idea about Easy is , who will be there for you when you really need it ? And this is not whether you need $ 10 , this is like when you come running and somebody ' s after you . Easy is not the kind of guy who figures , ' Well if I do this , I ' ll get killed. ' He says : ' I ' ll do this , and I might get killed but I ' m going_to do_it anyway , because this is where you have to stand up. ' &quot; When Mosley speaks_of Easy , it ' s as if he ' s relating the escapades of an irascible cousin or the brother with the gold tooth who always gets the barber_chair with the best light -- a figure he knows inside and out . In the stories , Easy emerges as the sort of black male figure that so_much of popular culture has collectively erased from public consciousness or has yet to find a place for at the dinner_table . There is a familiarity about him , a human softness that despite the unrelenting violence of his life allows him to be sickened by the sight of a corpse or to open his heart and arms to children , whom he takes_in like strays . There are friends to answer to , comeuppance to be paid . He , unlike Chandler ' s Marlowe , is irrevocably tied to his world , his community , the landscape . &quot; He has a lot of commitments in the world . These people are people he knows and he ' s responsible_for . I don ' t understand how somebody like Marlowe could live , &quot; says Mosley . &quot; He had no friends , no lovers really . No children , no parents , no job . I mean nothing. &quot; Easy ' s universality , his human side , appealed_to Jesse Beaton , who is producing the film version of &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress &quot; with Gary Goetzman ; Jonathan Demme and Ed Saxon are executive producers . Browsing at a West Hollywood bookstore , Beaton , who was eager to find another project to tackle after &quot; One False Move , &quot; pulled the book from the mystery shelves a_few years back . She was taken by it for a_couple_of reasons . &quot; There ' s so little documentation of that period in L.A. We know a lot about Harlem , what a rich , lively , vital world it was . Unfortunately , so_much of that ( L.A. ) world is physically lost . Burned in fires , riots , rezoned , crashed down , empty lots . Very little of Central Avenue remains . The Dunbar ( Hotel ) is there , but what was surrounding it is not. &quot; On a personal level , she emphasizes , &quot; I was about to lose my house . I thought , in this world we live_in , people who feel that they would never have anything in common with someone like Easy Rawlins do . We all are trying to hold_on to that bit of the American_dream . I felt that whoever you were , you would understand this . I lost my house , &quot; she says with a chuckle , &quot; but Easy kept his. &quot; Easy Rawlins has friends to spare , in more_than one city . &quot; He sort of represents that mass movement out of the South and into L.A. during the war , &quot; says David Fine , editor of the anthology &quot; Los Angeles in Fiction &quot; and professor of English at Cal State Long_Beach . &quot; Watts is filled with displaced Southerners . There is this sense in his novels of people living_on the edge , being uprooted and displaced . I don ' t know anybody who writes_about South-Central that way . He ' s got a real sense of life lived exposed , raw , right on the edge of existence. &quot; What makes Mosley ' s work sound authentic to many black readers ' ears is that he never uses the shorthand &quot; South-Central &quot; in his writings . He steers clear of sweeping generalizations , working to create an image so clear one can see its pores or recognize the voice in the dark . Many a behatted church lady will be happy to tell you that before the ' 70s , &quot; L.A. Negroes &quot; lived_on the east_side or the west_side of a city efficiently divided by Central Avenue . &quot; It was wonderful , &quot; says Mosley ' s childhood friend Kirsten Childs , &quot; to see ( in Mosley ' s books ) this place that ' s not a caricature and not smaller than life . Not meaner , not nicer . People live here , grow_up and die here . It was like this whole world was created as I remembered it. &quot; Some , like Richard Yarborough , associate_professor of English and Afro-American studies at UCLA , compare Mosley ' s simple yet vivid landscapes to those of filmmaker Charles Burnett , who directed &quot; To Sleep With Anger &quot; and &quot; Killer of Sheep , &quot; both about black life in Los Angeles . Their manner of revealing the uncliched complexities of life in black L.A. is often elegant , even in its grittiness . Yarborough sees the most striking similarities in the way Burnett ' s and Mosley ' s work shows big-city life in the postwar decades merging with the superstitions and pace of the South . And Mosley , he says , &quot; captures the oral tradition right in the movement from the one site where it grew_up to the other where it is changing . Easy can speak quote-unquote , conventional English , or he can speak black_English . In ' A Red Death , ' he is reading about Roman history , yet he has Army experience and is part of the street. &quot; Easy finds his surest footing as a black everyman -- someone ' s father , brother , cousin , lover -- with bills to pay , marital problems , feuding friends and an insatiable lust for a life that is seldom anything less than hard . He ' s not a formal detective with a license , he ' s a &quot; utility_man &quot; who does favors ; in his part of town , he knows where to go , what to ask and how to ask it . &quot; I felt a secret glee when I went_into a bar and ordered a beer with money someone else had paid me , &quot; Easy confides in &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress. &quot; &quot; I ' d ask the bartender his name and talk_about anything , but really , behind my friendly talk , I was working to find something . Nobody knew what I was up_to , and that made me sort of invisible ; people thought that they saw me but what they really saw was an illusion of me , something that wasn ' t real. &quot; THERE ARE MANY WHO MIGHT LAY_CLAIM TO BEING MOSLEY ' S PARADIGM for Easy . Neighborhood cronies . Back-room prophets . It ' s Mosley ' s father who ' s most often cited . But , says Mosley ' s friend Childs , &quot; I know that Easy is based on a lot of different people , but there is a part of Easy that is definitely Walter . This major vulnerability . There were certain things that were letting you see part of Walter ' s soul , part of Walter ' s mind. &quot; On one level , a pretty air-tight argument can be made that Easy ' s progenitor , a man whose favorite color is gray , is just as elliptical as the character he so impeccably created . Even though he would furiously argue the point , he , too , could meld with the shadows -- if his eyes didn ' t skitter about so_much . &quot; Easy isn ' t a shadow , &quot; Mosley maintains , and so begins the dance , the teasing smile in his voice . &quot; You know what he ' s thinking , doing . . . . &quot; &quot; But the people in his life don ' t. &quot; &quot; True. &quot; &quot; So would n ' t that make him a shadow ? &quot; &quot; Well . . . not exactly. &quot; The debate is interspersed with a running commentary as we drive through vaguely familiar haunts , but if the conversation veers too close to the territory Mosley chooses not to discuss , he deflects questions with veils of jokes and riddles and anecdotes or turns inquiries inside out . The entire production is performed always with the most elated version of his smile , fully revealing a generous gap separating his front_teeth . Shifting characters , maybe slipping into the voice of Easy ' s best_friend Mouse , or giving voice to an anonymous man standing on the corner , Mosley ' s a mimic at_the_ready with quick , and many times acerbic , remarks . &quot; In the ' 40s , there was a time of great hope in Los Angeles , &quot; he says , his eyes lit with the momentum of a story . &quot; It was a big place , it was a countrified place . It was a place where if there was a job , the job was digging ditches , it wasn ' t somebody saying : ' We ' re looking_for colored people or Japanese people ( to dig ) ditches. ' It was , ' We ' re looking_for people to dig ditches. ' So no matter what color you were , you were working there . And if you were a white_man and said : ' I ' m not working next to that niggah , ' they ' d say , ' Well , get outta here , because I got 20 niggahs working here and I need to dig my ditches. ' There was hope and opportunity . And as L.A. began to redefine that hope , that possibility , the dream lost a lot of its glitter . Even though a lot of the dream came true -- a lot of us who came_through that time became lawyers and doctors -- still , a lot of us are down in the boarded-up ' hood. &quot; At once warm and veiled , there is the public Mosley : the raconteur , the debater , the banterer , the charmer , the wild and wide-eyed 8-year-old ; there is a more contained Mosley : the thinker , the analyst , the inquisitor . He ' s as obsessed with the intricacies of &quot; Married With Children &quot; as by the stories of his orphan father ' s vagabond youth in Louisiana and Texas . He ' s a conundrum who pulls from Louis Armstrong and folk_singer Mary McCaslin with equal fervor and fascination . &quot; There is kind of an elusiveness to his soul , &quot; says Frederic Tuten , who was Mosley ' s writing instructor and is now his best_friend . &quot; I can ' t presume_to say that I know Walter. &quot; This understanding seems only to deepen their connection . &quot; We both have this kind of strange part of us that didn ' t grow_up , so the world is always full of surprises . It ' s as if the two of us have been condemned to solitary confinement , and when we ' re let_out , we are sort of amazed by what we see. &quot; What passes in Mosley ' s view this particular afternoon is not the often-resurrected image of a bombed-out war zone , although these communities and their collections of wide boulevards and tree-lined streets are struggling with their wounds . &quot; It ' s just a community of scarring , &quot; says Mosley . &quot; It started in ' 65 and ( then ) just got more and more. &quot; We roll along , verbally sifting the remains , wondering about the cause of the damage : urban unrest of ' 65 or ' 92 ? Maybe a neighborhood fire or the earthquake or just plain old garden-variety urban blight ? &quot; There ' s great wealth in the city , but there is a kind of disintegration going_on , &quot; he says , still watching , recording the image , possibly filing it away . He readjusts himself in the seat . &quot; You have to understand the character of these people from the inside , not from the outside . I don ' t know who this fellow is , &quot; he says , gesturing toward a stout man in a three-piece suit , glasses , Bible in_hand , his black hair powdered with patches of silver . &quot; He ' s not walking like he ' s nervous , you know what I mean ? &quot; Mosley believes , as do many African-American educators and pundits , that what rests at the core of this community ' s unraveling has less to do with absence of monetary riches than it does with historical amnesia . &quot; An identity has been misplaced , and that ' s one of the things that I ' m a very small part of . Everything that happens to black people in America is not talked_about . So we lose_it . It ' s not written down. &quot; Countering this loss within popular fiction , Mosley suggests , is like chasing a remedy with that proverbial spoonful of sugar . &quot; It ' s an adventure , &quot; he says with a coy laugh , &quot; because most of the things that Easy does are kinda fun. &quot; On this stretch of road , the juxtapositions are jarring -- the crumbling detritus of some once-fetching 1940 storefront squats next to a circa-1980 convenience structure of glass and concrete . The ragtag collection plays tricks with time and place . These darkened doorways inspire brighter memories . &quot; Even though most of those stores were owned by white people , at least there were stores in the community where people could go shopping , where people could get jobs . There was a relationship developing with the community , and that ' s really what ' s gone . And that , I think , is analogous to a physical reflection , in a negative sense , ( to ) the hope that is also gone from the community. &quot; His voice goes soft , loses speed . &quot; But a lot of the people are the same . They ' re still here. &quot; And 76th Place itself pulses on . For 10 years , the Mosleys lived here , near Central , in a white wood-frame house edged_in green , with a small front_porch that provided a perfect stage for stories . Today , it ' s a street of single-family dwellings , pastel duplexes , rose bushes , birds_of_paradise exploding askew . A woman , on her knees , polishes the knob of her iron screen_door while children , mostly Latino , command the center of the street with balls and bikes . Near the corner , a large wood-frame court of bungalows painted crisp white , its property_line marked_off by a tall iron fence , sparks something . Mosley leans forward in his seat to frame the picture better . &quot; Right here is the court -- Poinsettia Court -- they ' re all_over L.A. , &quot; he says , finger jabbing at the glass . &quot; that ' s where I imagined Easy living. &quot; It all comes_back in a flood . An easy smile moves across his sand-colored face and large , sad eyes . &quot; My father raised me in this neighborhood and he had high hopes for me . It wasn ' t : ' Walter can get a job at the garage , maybe , if he ' s lucky. ' He was saying , ' My son is going_to make_it , ' cause I ' m going_to make something out of my son , ' which he did. &quot; What might be absent physically is made_up for by what has failed to dissipate spiritually , Mosley notes . &quot; This community is still really kind of wonderful because when you really look directly at people , people are kind of smiling a lot and telling each other stories . ( But ) it ' s kind of a funny ( feeling ) . It ' s not like what I remember physically , but then again , it is what I remember physically. &quot; The unfolding scene plays tricks with one ' s memory . With the notion of memory itself . Vaguely familiar backdrops , partly familiar players . This lively tree-banked street next to Central Avenue , where life persists despite its new ghost-town feel . Beauty_parlors specializing in a &quot; Texas press and curl &quot; and soul food cafes now coexist with discotecas and mariscos and taco stands . And behind it all , lending a somewhat surreal backdrop , the downtown skyline hovers like Oz . Down the block a little farther , Mosley points_out a house stripped , he says , of its former character . His full lips return to a gentle pout . &quot; that ' s my house right there , but it ' s not the same anymore. &quot; This little strip of small homes , duplexes and bungalow courts was , Mosley believes , much more of a neighborhood than could be found elsewhere in the basin . He remembers a community that often disregarded color , religion and ethnicity , possibly important for a child whose father was black and whose mother was white and also Jewish . He grew_up relating the struggles of his black forebears to those of his mother ' s Eastern European lineage . He speaks_of fleeting crushes on the Mexican girls who lived nearby and was fascinated by them because they were &quot; so Catholic. &quot; This community that &quot; got_along &quot; was perhaps a built-in comfort zone for Mosley . &quot; Everybody knew one another . People are still living there who lived there when I was a little kid , and that ' s not the way you think_of L.A. The real Los Angeles , the Los Angeles I lived_in , there was no Hollywood . One thing , &quot; says Mosley , his voice drifting like a whisper , &quot; even though you couldn ' t find a way_out , there was a great sense of possibility. &quot; ELLA MOSLEY ADMITS SHE KEPT a sentinel ' s watch on her only child . She and her husband met at a local school ( she was an elementary_school clerk , he was a plant manager ) , and Walter Ellis Mosley was born in 1952 . &quot; I always worried about him , and you don ' t want to be that way , but you can ' t help it , &quot; she says . &quot; Walter wanted to walk down the street one time to the store , he was 6 maybe , he had never done that before . There was nothing that could have happened to him , so we let him , but I ' m walking on the other side , trying to keep_out of sight. &quot; About the time Walter was ready for junior_high , the family moved across town to a comfortable four-plex just off the western stretch of Pico , a new retreat that Leroy Mosley , who collected property as others do stamps , made a hideaway by planting an exotic array of vegetables , fruits and flowers . Drifting back to his adolescent years , Mosley recalls most clearly the ache at the_pit of his lungs from the air that so often smudged the skies ocher . He remembers feeling trapped within the flat , hot vastness . He read voraciously . &quot; I ' m not sure that it was traveling through books . I love to read . I was reading Dickens , Hesse , that kinda brooding youth stuff . I was reading whatever I got introduced to in school that I liked , and stuff my parents had just read . My first favorite book was ' Treasure Island. ' &quot; His intake later increased to include a steady diet of comic_books and paperback sci-fi . Mysteries didn ' t enter into the picture until his 20s , and the only writing he was flirting_with at the time didn ' t venture further than poetry . &quot; I was very unhappy , &quot; he says . &quot; It seems to me like I wanted something , but the something was intangible ; I didn ' t know how to get_it . In L.A. , that big middle portion of L.A. , people don ' t walk on the streets , people don ' t come from the same background or the same area , so your connection with people is very tenuous at best. &quot; Once out of his little neighborhood , the connection was gone . He cut it completely when he decided to attend Goddard , a &quot; radical &quot; arts college in Vermont . &quot; I thought I really had to go someplace where people will be like me . Things that I will say , they will understand. &quot; But upon his arrival , Mosley wasn ' t sure he understood them . &quot; They had a large black population . . . and they were all living in the same dorm , except me . It wasn ' t that the school wanted them to live there , it was the decision on their part . I thought , ' I ' m going_to search out a ghetto to live_in ? Nuh uh. ' &quot; He drifted from one campus to another and from one set of adventures to still others without a goal , with not even the essence of direction . &quot; I think I was informed by like the Kerouac and Ginsberg sensibility , and also by L.A. and the hippie movement , &quot; he explains . And what was he studying ? Mosley pauses , then lets_out an explosion that doubles as a laugh -- &quot; Who knows ? &quot; Writing came a little later , like a storm out of nowhere . After receiving a BA in political_science from Vermont ' s Johnson State College in 1977 , he met Joy Kellman , a dancer-choreographer , while he was working_on a Ph.D at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst . They married in 1988 . He ' d shown talent as a potter and painter and some aptitude for computers . &quot; I was sitting in a room , and I was working as a consultant programmer . It was a Saturday , and nobody else was there . I was writing programs . I got tired_of it , so I started typing on the computer , &quot; he says . &quot; I typed : ' On hot sticky days in southern Louisiana , the fire_ants swarmed . . . . ' I said -- ' Hey , this is cool . This means I could be a writer. ' So I start writing. &quot; In a_few months , a manuscript , &quot; Gone Fishin ' , &quot; under his belt , he enrolled in a graduate creative writing program at City College of New York . It was 1986 . &quot; He was writing these wonderful , beautiful stories , &quot; says Mosley ' s onetime instructor Tuten , author of &quot; Tallien : A Brief Romance. &quot; &quot; The vividness of the characterizations , the very simple , elegant beauty of the prose . And there is a lyricism there that you don ' t find in much American writing today. &quot; After Mosley had completed his instruction with Tuten and won CCNY ' s De Jur Award , he asked Tuten to critique a new manuscript . Excited by the power of the work , Tuten took it to his agent , who promised to sell the book -- and did , six weeks later . &quot; He didn ' t give it to me with that kind of anticipation , &quot; Tuten says . Since then Mosley has weathered the blizzard of events , Tuten believes , with ego safely in check . &quot; He ' s had plenty of occasions to play a big_shot . He ' s never done_it with anybody . I can ' t say that he ' s humble . He knows the value of this work , but he didn ' t become a writer to become famous . He didn ' t become a writer to become a celebrity . That happened , and I ' ve never seen anyone else handle it so well as he. &quot; Walter happy at last ? Well , happy would seem a stretch . Contented but busy seems to sum_up his demeanor , which at moments makes him appear as if he is leaning_on a gilded railing of some grand balcony , watching it all unfold . Lately , his thoughts center more on the final tinkerings on his blues novel , &quot; RL ' s Dream &quot; ( due next year ) and testing his chops with a screenplay , his own take_on the relatively nascent ' hood-film genre that he ' s been banging_out on his laptop in his Santa Monica hotel_room . With all_the clamor surrounding him of late , Mosley seems to fly from vague disinterest to a quiet merriment when talk_of his success rises in conversation . &quot; He ' s very controlled , &quot; his mother confides later . &quot; But being too controlled is not good . I always thought that his head would get too big , but he is just as easygoing . ( He ) never lets_on that everything is great. &quot; AT ITS DOWNTOWN source , Pico Boulevard , crowded with life , noisy with enterprise , serves as the vivid bridge , the wide road to the Westside . It ' s the bridge from Central Avenue to Mosley ' s teen years , the period in which he planned his grand escape . &quot; This is so L.A. , these palm_trees standing here , big wide streets and all these completely innocuous cinder-block buildings . It seems like this place where nothing real is going_on , which is why you can really write crime fiction about L.A. -- because really behind all these things , there is all this weird stuff , and strange people who come from all_over the place . . . and you don ' t know where they went_after they left here . &quot; When you see something like this , &quot; he gestures toward the boulevard , &quot; this isn ' t as real as what ' s in your head . In your head , you have the details , &quot; says Mosley . His gestures are careful , understated . His hands are reserved only for the most dramatic moment in the action , a crescendo . &quot; When I was a kid , and this was before cable , black people got_together and told stories . And storytelling is its own fuel . All you have to do is evoke a feeling . Sometimes it ' s just a word . A sentence. &quot; However , unlike Easy , who has cast his lot with Los Angeles ( &quot; He ' s going_to live_in his neighborhood . And either he is going_to get killed in that neighborhood or he ' s going_to survive in that neighborhood &quot; ) , Mosley hasn ' t . &quot; I would n ' t live_in Los Angeles , &quot; he says . &quot; The center of Los Angeles , though I am moved by it aesthetically , living_in it , I remember being very kind of , I ( didn ' t ) know how to get_out . There were no walls , but there was great distance. &quot; He ' s tiring of questions or maybe of just coming_up with serious answers to them . The 8-year-old peeks from behind the hedge , the trickster upsetting the balance , toppling the status_quo . With a part-dreamy , part-devilish expression inhabiting his eyes , he takes_a_breather . Roaming around his hotel-room carpet on stocking feet , he finally pauses to install himself in the love_seat , to take_advantage of its view of the very edge -- the lazy Pacific as it curls and stretches eight stories below . He sits , legs pulled beneath him , dressed entirely , once again , in black : socks , jet shirt tucked into charcoal trousers . His calf-length cashmere coat , which he wears_on the dust_jacket of &quot; White Butterfly , &quot; and his Kangol hat ( one of a pair he and his father purchased in London ) are draped across the foot of the bed , suggesting that the pause is only temporary . Over the course of the week , he ' s been busy with a varying collection of duties and diversions : lunch with his mother , a visit to his father ' s grave ( he died of lung_cancer late last year ) , a meeting with &quot; the movie people , &quot; interviews , more pages filed_away on the screenplay and , of course , some time set_aside to catch_up_with his favorite TV family , the Bundys on &quot; Married With Children. &quot; The room is cluttered with tools of his spare_time : a Hilma Wolitzer novel , a copy of Ray Bradbury ' s &quot; Fahrenheit 451 &quot; ( for an essay he ' s working_on ) , a flute and sheet_music . His laptop , folded away , rests_on the room ' s only table . His morning writing ritual is a constant . With the jet-lag , it begins at 3:30 ; he quits at about 10 . &quot; A novel , it seems to me , has to be larger than the mind of the writer , &quot; he says . The largeness of L.A. , though daunting and &quot; stultifying &quot; to a younger Mosley , is now the precise dimension he seeks to replicate in his work . &quot; The novel is based on a plot , and the best way to describe a plot to me is the structure of revelation . If you can hold it all within a small space , a space small enough for you to see and perceive , then you don ' t have the feeling of revelation , because it ' s too controlling . What you want is something big , where things surprise you , where things become. &quot; He would like to avoid narrow pigeonholes or empty spokesman roles , despite the expectations of those of any hue . &quot; Expectations ? &quot; &quot; Well , you know if you ' re black and you make_it , you should want to be helping other black people in ways that most people don ' t even help their family . And I think a lot of black people feel that responsibility . I know I do , &quot; he admits . &quot; But at_the_same_time , it can interfere with your work . People come_up_to you and say , ' Well , you have to write in African tones , my brother. ' &quot; ' Well , you know , I ' m writing the way I write. ' &quot; ' But you see , your mind has been brainwashed by The Man , and you have to return to our true identity. ' &quot; He tends to be more populist and universal in his thinking . &quot; A good novel comes_out into the world and grows as people read it . Other people , they see things , learn things , they get a little inkling of something that may make its way into something else ( or in the ) actions that they take_in their own lives . I want black people to have a good time . I mean , I want black people to read the book and say , ' that ' s my language , that ' s my life . that ' s my history . But I want white people to say , ' Boy , you know , I feel just like that ! ' &quot; Human struggle , failure , and the occasional reward of good_fortune serve as the dramatic and emotional engines for much of Mosley ' s work . &quot; I ' m not really happy , &quot; he says , &quot; with political writing as political writing . That kind of sociopolitical writing they do about black life -- ' The Black_Man , blah , blah , blah , and the Black_Woman , blah , blah , blah. ' And then the white this and Jim Crow and all this other stuff . I mean I like mentioning it , because I think it ' s a part . But it ' s such a small part of black life. &quot; &quot; Politics ? &quot; I coax him toward elaboration . &quot; Well , politics is a big part of our life , and so is racism . But most black people are living lives , making_love , raising children , listening to music , working hard , saving money , learning new skills in_order to survive , watching television , telling jokes , telling stories -- so_much of life is that . And black life in America is really kind of a celebration . Even when people are really sad , &quot; says Mosley , eyes wide , hands painting vast landscapes , portraits , busy triptychs . &quot; And when they ' re sad , how do they celebrate it ? &quot; The answer is sly , trademark-simple : &quot; that ' s the blues. &quot;</TEXT>
