   <HEADLINE> LAND OF IMMIGRANTS MAY SHUT OPEN_DOOR ; JULY 4 : PRIDEFUL INDEPENDENCE_DAY ORATORY ASIDE , IMMIGRATION ISSUE DIVIDES COUNTRY AS FALL ELECTIONS APPROACH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Declaration_of_Independence , in its inventory of reasons for overthrowing a tyrannical government , lists one grievance that seems today almost quaint . The king , wrote Thomas_Jefferson , &quot; has endeavored to prevent the population of these states , obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners and refusing to . . . encourage their migrations hither. &quot; Immigration policy , especially as the fall elections approach , has become as prickly an issue now as then . But the attitude of many Americans has shifted into reverse . Foreigners today are migrating hither at a pace not seen since the beginning of this century , about a_million a year . One recent poll found that 49 % of Americans want to slow_down that pace and 27 % want to stop the flow altogether . &quot; We need a breather , &quot; said Sen . Alan K . Simpson ( R-Wyo. ) . Eight years ago , Simpson wrote the law that extended amnesty from deportation to more_than 3 million illegal immigrants . Now he wants a five-year cutback on all immigration . If America won ' t slam the Golden Door , other lawmakers demand that it at least close the Tortilla Curtain , a sneering epithet for the Mexican border . According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service , only about three in 10 newcomers are &quot; undocumented aliens , &quot; a category unknown in Jefferson ' s day . Even so , immigration experts say they are the main source of a rising national hostility toward all immigrants , legal and illegal . The Mexican border is their path_of_least_resistance , the route of about half the 3.85 million illegals the INS says are in the country . To many immigration critics , the 1 # 950-mile border is less a flimsy curtain than a tainted spring oozing a sort of social pollution . &quot; We ' re never going_to seal_off this border , not 100 % , not ever , &quot; said Silvestre Reyes . &quot; It ' s unrealistic to think we can. &quot; Reyes is chief of the Border_Patrol in the El Paso sector and knows the border as well as anyone . He is a product of its distinct culture , a culture unlike that in any other large section of the United States . Like most border residents , Reyes has relatives on both sides . His grandfather crossed over in 1913 . The El Paso sector is second in size and activity only to San Diego . Across the Rio Grande from El Paso , population 511 # 000 , is Juarez , Mexico , with 1.5 million restless and for the most part desperately poor people . From their hovels in the Third_World they gaze across a narrow stream at the First World . Since Reyes ' arrival a year ago , he has reduced illegal entry dramatically . Instead of chasing down illegals after they cross , his tactic is to discourage them from trying . He stations_agents like cavalry pickets , within view of one another , day and night , along a 9-mile fence on the north bank of the river . About 9 # 000 aliens used to cross here daily . Now only about 600 make_it . The other 8 # 400 likely will make_it , too , eventually . Reports show that they have simply spread from El Paso to other crossing places in Texas , New Mexico , Arizona . Their northward flow is persistent and unceasing , like water around a rock . To demonstrate that a blockade can work both ways , Mexicans in Juarez responded with a two-day boycott . El Paso merchants grumbled that business fell_off by half . Others on the U.S. side , locals who rely_on paying less than minimum_wages for lawn mowing , dishwashing , gas_pumping and the_like , have also let Reyes know what they think_of his new policy . Not much . &quot; I could forsee that , &quot; Reyes said . &quot; They wanted me to keep_out the prostitutes and panhandlers and leave the rest alone . I told them they can ' t have it both ways . &quot; I also knew that illegals who used to commute daily now would have to stay for weeks at a time . Or else move_on and stay even longer . Why work here for $ 10 a day when they can go_to Dallas or Denver and make $ 6 an hour ? So the border remains , as always , less a barrier than an inconvenience , more so at some places than at others . At the other 14 twin cities that straddle the boundary , and at points between , the Border_Patrol operates in its traditional way . Agents catch as_many illegals as they can on U.S. soil and haul them back to Mexico . They often catch the same ones three and four times a day ; agents and aliens soon get_to know one another . Illegal entry is often little more_than a game . All the way downstream , where the Rio Grand empties into the Gulf_of_Mexico , Eufemia Lopez has a small sign nailed to her home on the outskirts of Brownsville , Tex. : &quot; Se Atienen Partos . &quot; In the local idiom , &quot; Birthing Done Here. &quot; Lopez is a partera , a midwife . About half her customers are Mexican nationals . They slip across the border in their final days of pregnancy to deliver the gift of life and receive in return a gift provided by the U.S. Constitution . When Lopez registers a birth at the courthouse , the newborn is an American citizen . In large U.S. cities , mothers too poor to pay -- including undocumented ones -- have their babies in hospitals at public expense . All children in America , citizens or not , may attend public_schools . In every town on the Mexican border , without exception , the schools are woefully overcrowded . A research group in Washington , the Center for Immigration Studies , says illegal aliens cost the nation about $ 7 billion a year in medical , educational and other services . This is the main complaint of the various groups formed to curb immigration . &quot; We ' re just giving_away America , &quot; said Glenn Spencer , a spokesman for one such California group called Act Now . &quot; We have too soft a heart. &quot; Florida claims to spend $ 1.5 billion a year on social_services for about 373 # 000 illegal immigrants . Its governor argues that this is a federal problem and has sued the government to collect . Texas , with 405 # 000 , and California , with 1.6 million , have filed similar lawsuits . ( Any count of illegal aliens is obviously a guess ; they do not come_forward to be counted . So figures vary , usually according to the leanings of the counters . The INS estimates strive to be neutral. ) California , a trend-setting state whose population is 28 % Hispanic , is out front in anti-immigration activism . California Republican Gov . Pete Wilson , campaigning for reelection , would amend the Constitution to deny citizenship to native-born children of undocumented mothers . He also favors an initiative on the November ballot that would deny a public education and all but emergency health_care to illegal immigrants . Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) wants to call_out the National_Guard to seal the Mexican border . Her Democratic colleague , Sen . Dianne Feinstein , who as mayor of San Francisco was a champion of immigrants , now wants to buy tougher border control with a $ 1 toll on every person who crosses . About 56 million a year cross legally at San Diego , the world ' s busiest port_of_entry . Illegal crossers , of course , do not stop at toll booths . Congress has already approved $ 45 million to hire up_to 600 more Border_Patrol agents , which would raise their strength to an unprecedented 4 # 000 . &quot; Agents make_good salaries for this area , &quot; said Anthony Zavaleta , dean of the liberal arts college at the University of Texas in Brownsville . &quot; We want as_many agents as we can get , to help our economy . Will they make a dent in illegal entry ? No way. &quot; The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act aimed to stop or at least curtail illegal entry . It hasn ' t , at least not so anyone can notice . The reason , immigration authorities agree , has been failure to enforce sanctions against those who hire illegals . Now the U.S. attorney_general has urged a crackdown on such employers as well as an effort to devise documents for legal workers that can ' t be forged . One of the law ' s spinoffs has been a cottage industry in counterfeiting all along the border . Competition has produced not only quality work but specialization : green_cards , Social_Security cards , driver ' s licenses , birth_certificates , name it . &quot; Employers welcome this , &quot; Zavaleta said . &quot; It gives them the excuse that the phony documents looked perfectly good to them . &quot; But all that is beside the point . The people who sneak across are desperate . Their families are hungry . All they want is to work . If they make a long , hard journey from the Mexican interior , they will persist and will get_across . They will stay longer and send money home . Whole villages in southern Mexico depend_on American dollars . &quot; If they could make a decent living in their homeland -- by their standards , not ours -- they would not leave. &quot; Zavaleta , who was reared on a ranch in Mexico , also disagrees_with the claim of Texas officials that illegal aliens cost the state more_than double what they contribute . &quot; I ' ve never bought that as an argument against immigration , legal or illegal . The illegal ones take unfilled jobs nobody else wants . The economy needs them . They buy gas , go shopping , pay taxes , start businesses . How can you measure their future contributions ? &quot; Such_as , perhaps , that of a college dean . New York ' s illegal-immigrant population is second only to California ' s , 510 # 000 from many nations . But New York ' s Gov . Mario Cuomo appears to share the dean ' s view -- as well as take_to_heart the Statue_of_Liberty ' s summons to the world ' s huddled masses . Cuomo , also up for reelection , decided against joining the lawsuit with the other three immigrant-heavy states . &quot; It sends_out the wrong message , &quot; he told the New York Times . &quot; I love immigrants . Legal , illegal , they ' re not to be despised. &quot; Many New Yorkers , he said , &quot; know well that their own forebears arrived without papers. &quot; Roberto Martinez said this : &quot; Talk_about immigration in terms of economics is a smoke_screen . It is about nativism , about race , and it is ugly. &quot; Martinez was born in 1937 and reared in the barrios of San Diego . His people came from Texas . He knows all about cafe signs that said : &quot; Dogs and Mexicans not allowed , &quot; knows first-hand what it is like to be rounded up and arrested for no other reason than he looks unmistakably Hispanic . But he is a fifth-generation American . He had to re-learn Spanish , which his family had long since lost , so he could lay aside his engineering degree , quit his white-collar job and go_to work for the American Friends Service Committee on behalf of his distant countrymen . He also knows personally other native-born Americans who were among the 1.1 million Hispanics rounded_up in California ' s &quot; Operation Wetback &quot; in 1954 and forcibly deported to Mexico -- and lured back whenever growers needed low-wage pickers . He has tried to help many of them prove their American citizenship , but with little success . &quot; We Americans , &quot; said Martinez , &quot; have always been suspicious of people of different colors , different languages , always treated them badly . Economics plays a part , but it goes deeper. &quot; Sociologists say it takes at least three generations , down to the immigrant ' s children ' s children , to complete the immigration process fully . Today the foreign-born number about 8 % of the population . In 1910 the figure was 15 % of a much smaller population . Today hostility is directed mainly toward Hispanics and to a lesser extent Asians . But whatever an American ' s name -- Eisenhower , Goldwater , Toscanini , Brandeis , O ' Neill , Rockne , DiMaggio , Clemente , Schwarzkopf -- the certainty is that his or her forebears once suffered stinging discrimination . But &quot; a nation of immigrants &quot; is not just a rhetorical flourish loosed at ethnic picnics . It is an apt description of a sovereign country founded and shaped by people who came from somewhere else . With one exception : The Mexican border . That border was established by conquest . And that fact perhaps goes_far to explain its ineffectiveness as a boundary . The treaty that ended U.S. occupation of Mexico_City in 1848 turned the northern two-fifths of Mexico into what is now one-fourth of the United States , completing America ' s dream of Manifest_Destiny . The Gadsden Purchase of 1853 , as an afterthought , added another chunk of Mexican soil for a railroad to speed the occupation . The Mexican president who succumbed to the purchase , Santa Anna , was exiled . A marker in Mexico_City calls him &quot; patriot and traitor , &quot; Mexico ' s Benedict Arnold . In short , when America took its Southwest -- California , Arizona , New Mexico and Texas -- it took land , harbors , gold , silver , oil and the homes and labor of 80 # 000 people whose families had lived there for many generations before America even became a republic . Overnight the conquered became foreigners in their own land with little inclination to declare allegiance to the conquerors . Neither , necessarily , do their descendants along the border . &quot; There ' s a lingering feeling all along the border that this land was stolen and by rights theirs , &quot; said Martinez . &quot; In Mexico they still call the boundary river by its ancient name , Rio Bravo . And they certainly don ' t regard it ( as ) a criminal act to cross it to find work. &quot; Just so . The most popular radio_station in Mexico is the powerful one in Chihuahua that beams personal messages from home to illegal family members across America . A Different Perspective The Southwest , about one-fourth of the United States , does not quite fit the definition &quot; a nation of immigrants. &quot; That portion was taken by conquest from a_people unwilling to lose_it . A lingering resentment remains along the Mexican border . * Texas novelist Larry McMurtry captured it in this excerpt from his &quot; Streets of Laredo : &quot; &quot; Texas or Mexico , what ' s the difference ? &quot; Joey asked . . . . &quot; One is Texas and the gringos own it , &quot; Maria said . &quot; This is Mexico . We own it . that ' s a difference. &quot; &quot; It ' s two names for the same place , &quot; Joey said . &quot; We should own it all . It was ours once , and we didn ' t have to smile at gringos when we crossed the river. &quot; &quot; I don ' t smile at gringos , but Texas was never mine , &quot; Maria said . * In Hidalgo , Tex. , a bronze statue of a man in heroic pose , erected in 1976 , stands_in a park near the school . An inscription identifies him : &quot; Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla , padre de nuestra patria. &quot; The eponymous Hidalgo , the Texas schoolchildren read , was &quot; father of our country. &quot; * In San Diego , a poster in &quot; Chicano Park , &quot; a grassy lot where Latinos gather , shows a scowling Aztec pointing like Uncle_Sam and asking , &quot; Who ' s the illegal immigrant , pilgrim ? &quot; * In Brownsville , Tex. , and other border cities , Cinco de Mayo , a date commemorating a victory by a relatively small Mexican force over the invading French army , is celebrated with as much enthusiasm as the Fourth_of_July . Wandering mariachi bands sing their laments , called corridos , which tell of workers who cross the border , get caught , and have to try again . * One Mexican chambermaid in a McAllen , Tex. , motel was asked what would happen if she got caught . &quot; I would be late for work , &quot; she said .
