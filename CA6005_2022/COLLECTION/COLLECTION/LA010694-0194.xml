   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; A LOTTERY WITH VERY HIGH STAKES ; TWO FRIENDS UNITED BY MS ARE AMONG PATIENTS SEEKING A SCARCE BUT PROMISING NEW DRUG . SHARON DREW NO . 319 , ALISON 59 # 814 . SUCH INEQUITIES FRUSTRATE BOTH THE LUCKY ONES AND THOSE WHO CAN ONLY WAIT AND HOPE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They are sisters in spirit , Sharon Fuhrman and Alison Caldow . They guard one another ' s fears and secrets , finish one another ' s sentences . They giggle at quirky British television_shows , grow melancholy at poignant ballads and share a zest for what Sharon calls &quot; artsy , intellectual kind of stuff. &quot; But common likes and dislikes are not what brought these women together . Sadly , their friendship is rooted in a crippling disease -- multiple_sclerosis -- that is slowly stripping them of control over their bodies and minds . Already , MS has pushed Sharon into a wheelchair . It takes all_of Alison ' s strength just to walk . Now , fate binds them in another way : the lottery . This was no ordinary lottery , nothing as simple as spinning the Fantasy Five or as serendipitous as a quick pick from the computer at 7-Eleven . No , this was a gamble with much higher stakes , a drawing for a brand-new drug -- the first new treatment for multiple_sclerosis in a quarter-century , and the first ever to attack the disease itself , rather than simply easing its symptoms . The drug is called Betaseron . It is not a miracle_worker . It won ' t cure multiple_sclerosis . It won ' t reverse damage already done . But it does seem to keep MS patients from getting_worse -- something no other medicine has done . But Betaseron is expensive -- $ 10 # 000 a year -- and the government-funded Medicare program , as well as some private health_insurance plans , won ' t cover it . More critically at the moment , there is not enough of it to go_around . Thus , the lottery , run_by Berlex Laboratories , a Richmond , Calif.-based company that created Betaseron . The rules were simple : The first 12 # 000 would get the drug right away , and another 55 # 000 would wait until more supplies become available . The results came_back a_couple_of months ago , and the close friends could not have been further apart . Sharon ' s number is 319 . She started taking Betaseron the week before Christmas . Alison drew 59 # 814 ; she must wait at least until mid-1995 . Kismet had dealt these women a bittersweet hand , and the lucky one found herself grieving . &quot; I felt so bad for her , &quot; Sharon says . &quot; I know how much it means to her to stop this thing while she can still walk . Every time she gets a new twinge , I hurt for her . I remember when I went from her stage to this stage , and I hate to see that happen to her . I almost at one point thought maybe it would be better if she got_it . But I can ' t fix that. &quot; If Alison is jealous or disappointed , she refuses to show it . &quot; Just because I have a high number I am not going_to give_up my positive attitude , &quot; she insists . &quot; Life goes_on . It went_on before Betaseron . It will go_on after it . . . . I just feel_for the person who has a higher number than I do , and who needs it more. &quot; * The story of these women , who befriended one another through a support group in the Southern California high desert town of Hesperia , illustrates the plight of thousands of multiple_sclerosis patients across America who are pinning their dreams on a drug that , either because of high cost or limited supply , is tantalizingly beyond their grasp . One angry father organized a massive letter-writing campaign when his 16-year-old son drew a number above 50 # 000 ; he is threatening to sue Berlex if the teen-ager doesn ' t get the drug by April . Says one tearful , frustrated patient : &quot; They have produced this wonderful drug and are hanging it out_in front of our noses , like a carrot in front of a donkey. &quot; This is also the story of high-tech medicine , and how a pharmaceutical company poured 10 years into developing a drug that it now must price high enough for shareholders to see a return . Without dramatic advances in genetic_engineering and the willingness of investors to risk hundreds of millions of dollars , Betaseron would never have been possible . Now , Berlex officials say , it is time to pay these people back . &quot; This is not an unreasonable mechanism for funding research , &quot; says Dr. Jeffrey Latts , the company ' s vice_president for clinical research . &quot; that ' s how it works. &quot; And finally , it ' s the story of the nation ' s quirky , patchwork health_care system -- a system fraught with loopholes . Berlex is offering financial_aid to low-income people who entered the lottery but lack insurance , and in some cases is even giving_away Betaseron . But that doesn ' t help people who are insured but whose carriers won ' t cover the drug . ( Sharon ' s does. ) Medicaid , the federal insurance program for the poor , pays_for Betaseron . Medicare , which provides coverage for an estimated 50 # 000 elderly and disabled MS patients -- including Alison -- does not . The reason ? Betaseron is taken by self-administered injection , in much the way diabetics give themselves insulin . That makes_it an outpatient drug , and Medicare does not cover outpatient prescriptions . But if a doctor gave the shots , they would be covered . &quot; In truth , our big problem is the terrible , outrageous , abominable state of health_insurance in this country , &quot; says Martha Keys , chief spokeswoman for the National Multiple_Sclerosis Society . &quot; This is why we so desperately need comprehensive health reform. &quot; As a former congresswoman from Kansas , Keys once had a hand in shaping health policy . Now , she is_on the other side of the fence , lobbying her former colleagues to make an exception to the Medicare rule about Betaseron . &quot; Just think_about trying to get $ 10 # 000 out of your income next year , &quot; she says . &quot; We have people who have called_in and said , ' Look , I ' ve increased the mortgage on my house so I can get Betaseron for a year , but what am I going_to do after that ? ' &quot; * Betaseron means so_much to people with multiple_sclerosis because it is their greatest hope yet in battling an illness that strikes quietly , often slowly , but ultimately with devastation . An estimated 350 # 000 Americans are afflicted with MS . It most often hits between the ages of 20 and 40 , and strikes twice as_many women as men . Sharon , who just turned 50 , has had MS since she was 33 . Alison , 36 , received the diagnosis seven years ago . The disease is not considered fatal , but it is insidious , wearing the body down over time . Its symptoms are debilitating -- blindness , paralysis , bladder dysfunction , fatigue , loss of memory , slurred speech , muscle spasms -- and they vary greatly from patient to patient . MS is like a thief . It has a ruthless way of robbing people of what they cherish most . Sharon once had a beautiful singing_voice ; as recently as three years ago , she had a job delivering singing telegrams . Now she speaks in a computer-like monotone , the words trickling out at an achingly slow pace . She is fond of baking , but following recipes is difficult ; her mind can ' t accumulate information . She loved to write , especially letters , but she can ' t string sentences together quite the way she used to . She misses being able to plan . She is a widow whose children are grown , and she had designs on moving north , to Washington , where the air is finer and the scenery prettier . Then reality hit . &quot; I don ' t know what I ' m going_to be like in a year , &quot; she says . &quot; If I can ' t take_care of myself , what am I going_to do way up there among strangers ? You don ' t want to think the worst , but it would be nice to know what ' s in_store . that ' s the trouble with this stupid disease . You can ' t plan. &quot; At a glance , Alison looks healthier than Sharon . But appearances deceive . Her gait is unsteady ; she must hold onto walls and furniture when she does not use her cane . Her hand quivers when she writes a check . She wears a size six shoe , but her sneakers are sevens ; she buys them big so she can slip them on without having to fiddle_with the laces . Her shirt is a pullover ; like most people with MS , her fingers lack the dexterity for buttons . Alison ' s passion was riding_horseback , but multiple_sclerosis forced her to give it up . She couldn ' t get_up on her horse anymore , and she didn ' t have the energy to groom her . Recently , she sold the animal , a Morgan Arabian named Sable , to a rancher who planned to offer rides to disabled children . Thinking_about it makes her cry . But her real regret is that she and her fiance will never have children ; she says having a mother with MS would be too big a burden on a child . &quot; I grieve an awful lot , &quot; she says , wiping her eyes , &quot; for things I have no control over. &quot; Why she and Sharon are ill is a mystery . Nobody knows what causes multiple_sclerosis . Along with rheumatoid_arthritis and lupus , MS is one of a series of &quot; autoimmune disorders &quot; in which the immune_system runs amok , mistakenly attacking the body . In MS , the central_nervous_system -- the brain and spinal_cord -- is the target . The disease destroys myelin , the protective sheath surrounding nerve_fibers that transmit messages to the body . Myelin works like insulation on an electrical wire . Without myelin , nerves short-circuit . Their messages get scrambled , and the brain can ' t tell the body what to do . MS wreaks its havoc in sudden flare-ups , or &quot; exacerbations &quot; -- episodes in which the symptoms become excruciatingly severe . These attacks have no pattern ; they may happen every three months or every three years . Alison had her last one in September . She woke_up choking , unable to control her ability to swallow . With each flare-up , patients lose a little more ground . They often talk wistfully about &quot; coming_back &quot; from an attack , as though they have gone_on a voyage and left a part of themselves behind . &quot; When I come_back , &quot; Alison says , &quot; there is always something different wrong with me . Prior to this one , predominantly my left side was affected . Now it is both the left and the right. &quot; There are drugs on the market that ease the symptoms of MS , and most patients can rattle_off their tongue-twister names : Baclofin for muscle tightness and spasms . Amantadine for fatigue . Pro-Banthine for bladder control . Carbamazepine for the burning , shooting pain that comes_with MS . Methylprednesilone and other steroid treatments to make walking easier and relieve double vision . But there has never been a drug that attacked MS directly , one that actually prevents exacerbations from occurring . Until Betaseron . * &quot; This is the first drug ever that has changed the natural_history of this disease , &quot; declares Dr. Kenneth Johnson , a University of Maryland neurologist who participated in the clinical trials of Betaseron . &quot; This is very promising. &quot; But the discovery did not happen overnight . The drug is a genetically-engineered form of beta interferon , a naturally occurring protein that the immune_system uses to fend_off viruses . Because of its immune properties , scientists had high hopes for Betaseron . But they fumbled around for a decade before they figured_out a good use for it . Berlex tried the drug on just about everything -- on cancer of the kidney , colon , lung and brain , on hepatitis and on viral infections , as well as on multiple_sclerosis . There have been 75 clinical studies of the drug . All flopped except two -- the ones involving MS patients . &quot; There were a lot of people who were very frustrated by the process , &quot; says Latts , the company ' s director of clinical research . &quot; These products don ' t come_out of the laboratory with a sign_on them saying , ' This is good for multiple sclerosis. ' &quot; In 1988 , after a small pilot study , Berlex began testing Betaseron on 372 MS patients in the United States and Canada . All were still walking , and all suffered from &quot; relapsing remitting &quot; as opposed to &quot; chronic progressive MS , &quot; an extremely disabling , late stage of the disease . The results were impressive but not overwhelming . Patients who got the drug had 35 % fewer attacks than those who got a placebo and half as_many serious exacerbations . But what Johnson and other neurologists found particularly compelling were the magnetic_resonance images of the subjects ' brains . MRI scans of placebo patients showed a 20 % increase in damaged myelin . Patients who got Betaseron showed no new damage at all . &quot; That is the promise of this drug , &quot; Johnson says , &quot; that it is going_to make a difference in the accumulating neurological damage , in the need for canes and wheelchairs. &quot; There were some troubling findings as well . The drug causes flu-like side_effects and produces reactions , such_as welts and swelling , where it is injected . Moreover , one person who got Betaseron committed suicide , and three more attempted to kill themselves . Experts say there is no way to assess whether Betaseron played a role ; MS often makes patients depressed , yet there were no suicide attempts in the control group . The positives about Betaseron clearly outweighed the negatives in the eyes of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , which approved Betaseron for multiple_sclerosis in July . The approval , which Johnson and other experts believe was influenced heavily by the MRI test results , was unusually quick ; FDA officials normally take_up to three years to review new drug applications , but Betaseron was approved in just one year . That was the good news . The bad news was that Berlex wasn ' t ready . The company Berlex contracted to manufacture Betaseron , Chiron Corp . in Emeryville , Calif. , had been making the drug in tiny quantities , just enough for experimental use . Now there was a huge demand , and Chiron -- which had planned to build new manufacturing facilities while the FDA took its time pondering Betaseron ' s approval -- couldn ' t meet it . Berlex was in a quandary . Simply putting the drug out on the market and letting people scramble for it would do no good ; Betaseron must be taken every_other day , and patients needed to be assured a continuous supply . Nor , Latts says , did company officials want to put themselves in the position of picking people who might benefit the most from Betaseron ; that seemed a little too_much like playing God , and in any event there is not enough research to support such a determination . So they settled_on the lottery -- a term the company dislikes , for it implies there are losers . The deadline for what Berlex has termed the &quot; open registration &quot; for Betaseron was Sept . 15 . Across America , nearly 67 # 000 people whose doctors believed they were good candidates for Betaseron registered with Berlex for the computerized drawing . And then the waiting began . * In Hesperia , a fast-growing town on_the_road to Las Vegas , where Joshua_trees and fast-food restaurants dot the landscape , the High Desert MS Support Group was watching closely . The group meets every_other week for comfort and laughter . There is Clint , a retired peace_officer and the only Republican of the clan , who takes endless grief for being a Rush Limbaugh devotee . There is Deborah , a former athlete , and Michele , the group ' s founder . There is David , the &quot; baby &quot; of the group at age 25 , who sometimes brings his mom to meetings . And Don , who arrived a year ago with a chip on his shoulder and now pointedly tells a visitor : &quot; If you ' re looking_for a bunch of people wallowing in self-pity , you ' ve come_to the wrong place. &quot; And , of course , Sharon and Alison . They are the bookends , the lowest and highest lottery numbers in the group . They have come_to grips with this disparity quite neatly , in a way that spares their friendship any pain . Sharon , they have decided , is &quot; the guinea pig. &quot; All will be watching to see what this drug does for -- or to -- her . After just three weeks of therapy , it is too soon to tell . While the friends are optimistic , they are realists as well . Years have passed with no new treatments for MS . During that time , they have watched themselves and the people they love deteriorate . In the back of their minds is a nagging fear that Betaseron might not live_up_to its promise . In the way that they have of finishing one another ' s sentences , they offer this summation : &quot; We all started_out . . . &quot; Sharon says , until Alison interjects : &quot; A little more hopeful than we are right now. &quot; Making Progress A new genetically-engineered drug , Betaseron , has been shown to slow the crippling effects of multiple_sclerosis , a progressive disorder in which the immune_system mistakenly attacks the body . Betaseron , expensive and in limited supply , is being distributed through a lottery system . The disease Multiple_sclerosis targets the central_nervous_system -- the brain and spinal_cord . The disease destroys the myelin_sheath , the protective cover that surrounds the nerve_fibers that send messages to the body . Without myelin , nerve_fibers cannot send messages properly . Thus the brain of an MS patient cannot tell the body what to do , leaving MS patients with a host of debilitating symptoms , among them blindness , paralysis , memory_loss , bladder dysfunction and slurred speech . Betaseron Betaseron apparently slows the destruction of the myelin_sheath , although scientists are not sure why . Some think myelin is destroyed when the body makes an excess of gamma interferon , a naturally occurring protein that may prompt the immune_system to attack the myelin_sheath . Another kind of interferon -- beta interferon -- stifles gamma interferon . Betaseron , a genetically engineered form of beta interferon , is thought to suppress the immune_system attacks . The drug does not reverse damage already done_by the disease but appears to keep MS patients from getting_worse .</TEXT>
