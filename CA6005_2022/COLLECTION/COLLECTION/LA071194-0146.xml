   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; BULGARIANS MAKE CASE THAT IMAGE ISN ' T EVERYTHING ; SOCCER : FIRST-TIME SEMIFINALISTS NO LONGER CONSIDERED THE LITTLE GUYS WHO can ' t .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bulgaria , as this World Cup opened , was a categorizer ' s spectacle . Location : Nowhere . Soccer : No name . World Cup prospects : No How . Not fair , of course , or even accurate as it turns_out , but soccer writers cultivate a certain sardonic edge , and Eastern Europe has limited fame in this arena . Then on Sunday , in a historic display of Balkan bravura , Bulgaria vaulted into the semifinals of the world ' s favorite sporting event . That came_to everybody ' s astonishment . Bulgaria is a longshot , representing a poor country and a long way from home . Its American odyssey is an adventure in improbability . &quot; The Germans were very good . But still , God is Bulgarian , &quot; joked Hristo Stoitchkov , who scored Bulgaria ' s first goal . With a lifetime World Cup record of 0-10-6 in five appearances , Bulgaria qualified against the odds for this year ' s tournament . It took come-from-behind finishes to squeak past Israel and France . Once qualified , the players rebelled , demanding bonuses unimaginable for an agricultural nation of 8.7 million wrestling with the aftermath of failed communism . Peace was made with the players , 13 of whom play in rich western Europe leagues , but then the American Embassy in the Bulgarian_capital of Sofia put_out the unwelcome mat . &quot; The embassy rejected about 90 % of visa requests from Bulgarian journalists . They saw everybody as a potential illegal immigrant , &quot; said Vasell Kolev of the sports newspaper Meridian Match . &quot; Only after newspapers protested did they relent. &quot; Bulgaria opened badly against Nigeria , losing , 3-0 , but shut_out hapless Greece and a Maradona-less Argentina to qualify for the second round . Still , Bulgaria appeared to escape to the quarterfinals less on its own merit than because of Mexico ' s collapse in second-round penalty kicks . About 30 Bulgarian print reporters in the Meadowlands press_box Sunday -- dutifully possessing visas and anachronistically without computers -- seemed more awed by Bulgaria ' s very presence in a quarterfinal than at its prospects against defending champion Germany . Merely advancing to the quarterfinals triggered bigger street celebrations in Bulgaria than the collapse of communism . But everybody in Sofia understood that West Germany and its united successor had played 17 consecutive World Cup games without a loss . When Germany took a 1-0 lead minutes after halftime , it seemed as if Bulgaria had gone as far as it would go : Germany was 9-1 in quarterfinal games and hadn ' t lost one since 1962 . &quot; We are not Italy . We are Bulgaria , a small country , not a giant . We never expected to reach this far , &quot; apologized Kolev , a student of Bulgarian philology at the University of Sofia . But the Bulgarian coolly hammered home one second-half goal , then another , silencing a pro-German stadium and striking Kolev and his friends first speechless , then teary . &quot; We made two serious mistakes and they punished us for them . They deserved to win , &quot; German Coach Berti Vogts said . Said Bulgarian Coach Dimitar Penev : &quot; The pressure is great when playing a great team like Germany , but most of our players were not scared . As we go_to the semifinal , perhaps people will look_at us in a different way. &quot; No one had confidence enough to have ordered champagne , but euphoria flowed as freely as disbelief among the victorious players . &quot; The facts are clear . This is Bulgaria ' s finest victory , its finest moment , &quot; said Yordan Letchkov , who scored the winning goal . Amid dressing room jubilation , phones rang . The president of Bulgaria called to say he ' s flying in_for Wednesday ' s semifinal against Italy . The prime_minister called . Letchkov ' s agent called to report a postgame overture from a team in the Italian League . &quot; This is the greatest success of my career and the greatest moment of my life , right up there with the birth of my two children , &quot; goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov said . Bulgaria will go_into the game with Italy as the pronounced underdog , but in a real sense the underdogs are already winners in this World Cup . &quot; Perhaps the world will realize that we have classy soccer players in Bulgaria , &quot; said Stoitchkov , on a day of national athletic pride that will long echo across the Balkans .</TEXT>
