   <HEADLINE> EUROPE ; KOHL MAY BE PUSHING BOULDER UPHILL IN TOUGH ELECTION YEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Germany ' s marathon election year begins Sunday with a state Parliament vote_in Lower_Saxony that Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s Christian Democratic Union is virtually certain to lose . Yet Kohl has been barnstorming the northern state , trying to stave_off a snowball effect from the first of 19 votes that will culminate in a general_election on Oct . 16 . The chancellor , an underdog in his own reelection bid , is reading the polls that give his center-right party 38 % of the vote_in Lower_Saxony and define victory as anything exceeding 35 % . &quot; Kohl is concentrating_on the October election and putting aside everything that might disturb the picture , &quot; said Martin Sueskind , Bonn bureau chief of the Munich daily Suddeutsche Zeitung . But he added , &quot; The feeling of the people is that the CDU is_on a downhill course and ( that ) the bandwagon will be against them when they are defeated in Lower Saxony. &quot; The Christian Democrats governed Lower_Saxony for 14 years before losing to a coalition of the left-of-center Social Democratic Party and the Greens ecologists in 1990 . The state ' s Social Democratic minister president , Gerhard Schroeder , is a popular figure who just might lead his party to an absolute_majority on Sunday . An outright victory in Lower_Saxony would boost the chances of the Social Democratic candidate for chancellor , Rudolf Scharping , who now leads Kohl in opinion polls . Political observers are watching Lower_Saxony also to see if extreme rightist parties or new independent parties of the center right attract the discontented . The main issue in the state and federal campaigns is the economy , and on that score the Christian Democrats are in bad shape . Germany is in the throes of the worst recession since its postwar economic miracle took_off . The German welfare_state is shrinking , and reunification has turned_out to be far more costly than Kohl had promised . Unemployment is running 10.5 % nationwide and 17.1 % in the former East_Germany . Kohl fought for reunification and won reelection in 1990 with the help of eastern voters . But now , eastern disaffection could tip the scales against him . In the eastern Brandenburg local elections in December , his party came_in third behind the former Communists . But Kohl is a wily , combative politician with a knack for comebacks , and few political observers are willing to write him off after 12 years in office . At his party ' s congress in Hamburg last month , Kohl quashed talk_of an internal coup , telling his rivals to fight then and there or not at all . Kohl is appealing_to rightists with issues such_as patriotism and family values and emphasizing his foreign_policy experience over the economy . He is counting_on voters to act conservatively in troubled times . &quot; Lower_Saxony is one part of the puzzle , but you don ' t know what the whole picture looks_like , &quot; said an official close to Kohl . He added that Germans feel freer to protest in a local election than in a federal ballot . The Christian Democrats rule nationally in a coalition with the smaller Free Democratic Party . Some in Kohl ' s camp fear that if the Social Democrats do not win Lower_Saxony outright , they could seek a coalition with the Free Democrats and set , one aide said , an &quot; uncalled-for example &quot; for the national election . There has been talk in political circles that the national election results could be so divided that the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats would be forced into a &quot; grand coalition &quot; or co-government . Both Kohl and Scharping are trying to avoid that . Scharping is attempting to persuade the electorate that his party is centrist , united and capable of governing -- not a perennial , bickering bridesmaid . He is buoyed by the polls that say Germans want change . In one poll published Thursday by the Hamburg weekly Die Zeit , 60 % of more_than 1 # 000 Germans surveyed nationally said they want a change in the federal_government in October . Discontent was clearly higher in the east , with 73 % saying they want change compared with 57 % in the west .</TEXT>
