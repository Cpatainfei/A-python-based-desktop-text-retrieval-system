   <HEADLINE> NIGERIAN CAMPAIGNS FOR A PRESIDENCY HE ALREADY WON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chief Moshood Abiola , wearing his finely pressed white robes , raced around this teeming city in an armed convoy the other night , kissing the bride at a wedding_reception , pressing the flesh at cocktail_parties and chatting privately with the_British ambassador . After an hour ' s sleep , the chief was up for Muslim prayers , and by midmorning he was leading 2 # 000 Christians in Bible songs . A politician on the hustings ? Not exactly . The bearish , 56-year-old multimillionaire businessman won a democratic election for president of Nigeria -- seven months ago . And the army is still in_charge . As Abiola ' s campaign for the office he has already won suggests , Nigeria ' s experiment with democracy has left Africa ' s most populous nation reeling . Since Nigerians elected Abiola in a free and fair election last June , the country has endured one puppet civilian government and two military governments . Now , eight long years after military rulers promised a return to civilian rule_in Nigeria , the hopes for democracy treasured by so many here seem as distant as ever . And the nation , though still producing 2 million barrels of oil a day , has been virtually bankrupted by unchecked corruption and dictatorial mismanagement . &quot; It ' s so unfortunate how things have turned_out , &quot; said Beko Ransome-Kuti , 53 , a chain-smoking physician who heads the Campaign for Democracy , the country ' s leading liberal coalition . The new Nigerian head_of_state is Gen . Sani Abacha , who seized power about nine weeks ago amid angry street protests that many feared had brought Nigeria to the brink of civil_war . In the time-honored tradition of Nigerian dictators , Abacha has promised to oversee a new transition to democracy , beginning with a national conference to write a new constitution . Now , as the trek toward civilian rule begins anew , the country is mired in its deepest economic depression since the free-spending oil boom of the 1970s . Despite its still-substantial oil reserves , unemployment stands at 50 % , inflation is running at 65 % a year , the country owes $ 33 billion to foreign lenders , and the middle_class that once thrived here has disappeared , leaving only the very rich and the very poor . &quot; We are hoping to be surprised by this regime , &quot; Ransome-Kuti said . &quot; But I have my doubts . In Nigeria , it is always the man who has eaten who tells the hungry man to be patient. &quot; The patience of Nigerians has been tested since June 12 , when 15 million voters went_to the polls for the election long promised by the military ruler , Gen . Ibrahim Babangida . The general had done his best to stage-manage the process . He created two political_parties , one slightly right of center and one slightly left . He wrote their platforms . He even selected their candidates . But it seems clear now that he never really intended to hand_over power . Abiola was elected with a solid national majority that successfully bridged the traditional differences among Nigeria ' s 250 ethnic_groups . And Babangida promptly annulled the results . Pro-democracy riots broke_out in July , leaving 168 Nigerians dead . And when Babangida finally agreed to leave in August , he handed power to a feeble , unelected interim government headed by Ernest Shonekan and backed by Abacha , Babangida ' s longtime deputy . Shonekan ' s efforts to heal the deep economic wounds , without benefit of a democratic mandate , only hastened the country ' s slide . When he removed the government subsidy on gasoline , sending prices at the pump rising from the equivalent of 6 U.S. cents a gallon to 45 cents , he was confronted with strikes and demonstrations in the streets . When Abacha informed Shonekan that junior military_officers planned a coup , the relieved leader promptly submitted his resignation , calling his interim government &quot; a child of circumstance. &quot; Abacha took_over Nov . 17 . He banned &quot; processions , political meetings and associations of any kind , &quot; which defused the immediate civil crisis . He dissolved the National Assembly , dismissed the elected state governors and abolished the two political_parties . In private chats with foreign envoys , he promised to stage a constitutional conference to lay a &quot; solid foundation &quot; for democracy ; he even sought their advice on the way forward . In the streets of Lagos , a city of 8 million people , and across the country of 95 million , there was more relief and resignation than anger . &quot; It doesn ' t mean we like this Abacha regime , &quot; said Samuel Madu , 32 , who works for a car service company in Lagos . &quot; We are fed up with these military regimes . But people were afraid of war. &quot; In his brief tenure , Abacha already has managed to divide his political opposition . His most surprising accomplishment was to co-opt several key opponents of military rule into his Cabinet . Olu Onagoruwa , a respected civil_rights lawyer , accepted a job as Abacha ' s attorney_general . He now argues that the general ' s promise of a constitutional conference was what the pro-democracy forces had been seeking all along . Abiola ' s vice president-elect took a job as the new foreign_minister , and the publisher of a newspaper critical of the government also accepted a portfolio , as internal affairs minister . In a bid to distance himself from the past , Abacha &quot; retired &quot; 17 military_officers closely associated with Babangida ' s discredited regime . &quot; This administration has shown that it is action-oriented , &quot; said Jerry Gana , Abacha ' s information minister . &quot; Nigerians admire that. &quot; The central question now is whether Abacha is serious about democracy or , as his detractors contend , merely using his own promises of democracy to stay in power as long as possible . No one knows for_sure , but it is a question that has divided Abacha ' s opponents and left Abiola suspended between an election he won and an inauguration he demands . After more_than a month of silence , Abiola announced in December that he would cling_to the results of the June 12 election and hope that Abacha will have &quot; the wisdom , &quot; as he puts it , to hand_over power peacefully . &quot; They want to kill my mandate , but they are wasting their time , &quot; Abiola said in an interview . &quot; All the man ( Abacha ) wants is to be president and stay there . I can assure you , my mandate is alive and well and will never die. &quot; Perhaps . But other pro-democracy leaders say Abiola ' s chance has come and gone . They contend that the popular leader lacked the nerve to form his own government and fight the military rulers last summer . &quot; Abiola is finished , &quot; said Olisas Agbakoba , a lawyer and chairman of the Civil Liberties Organization in Lagos . Gani Fawehinmi , a widely respected civil_rights campaigner in Lagos , added : &quot; He went_to_sleep with the mandate . People were prepared to die for him , and he didn ' t show enough courage. &quot; Abiola ' s answer : &quot; I ' m a politician , not a guerrilla leader. &quot; Some Nigerians were also worried by Abiola ' s meetings with Abacha , shown on state-run television in the days after the coup . Wole Soyinka , the Nigerian author and human_rights campaigner , said he found it &quot; shocking and disappointing. &quot; Soyinka , the 1986 winner of the Nobel Prize for literature , has called_on foreign governments to &quot; not say or do anything to give hope to this regime. &quot; &quot; They thought I had sold_out , &quot; said Abiola , who acknowledges meeting four times with Abacha . &quot; But I didn ' t sell_out . To kiss somebody , you have to get near them . But to bite them , you have to get near him too. &quot; Indeed , Abiola ' s grass-roots support still appears strong . Being a Muslim but also a Yoruba , he bridges the historic gulf between the Muslims of the north and the Yoruba and mostly Christian ethnic_groups in the south . His substantial wealth , amassed in private enterprise , is respected . He owns a publishing_house , a large farm and an oil_company ; he has international connections , having spent 16 years as a vice_president of the U.S. corporation ITT . Many here believe that those personal riches would make him immune to any temptation to steal from the treasury . Nearly every major Western government has demanded that Nigeria recognize Abiola ' s victory , and many Nigerians would also like to see him given a chance to run the country . At the recent church_service in Lagos , Abiola was greeted by a standing_ovation . The pastor , the Rev . Chris Okotie , a former pop_music star in Nigeria , said Abiola &quot; has come_to symbolize the principles of democracy in our land. &quot; On the clogged streets of Lagos , Abiola ' s motorcade , complete with his own private security service , is frequently stopped by cheering , waving crowds of supporters . Still , Abacha has shown no inclination to give the keys to Abiola . &quot; June 12 was a watershed for democracy , &quot; said Gana , Abacha ' s information minister . &quot; We have learned many lessons . But we are not likely to go back. &quot; While some pro-democracy leaders are heartened by Abacha ' s promise of a constitutional conference , others are not impressed . &quot; We can ill-afford another journey to no destination , &quot; said Fawehinmi , who has been jailed 18 times by military regimes . &quot; It ' s not necessary . It is a buying-time strategy by the military. &quot; But Onagoruwa , the new attorney_general and Fawehinmi ' s good friend , thinks Abacha is sincere . &quot; We are not fools , &quot; he said . &quot; If the government does not show any seriousness in the constitutional talks , I will get out. &quot; It is still not clear how much power Abacha will be willing to surrender to constitutional negotiators , some of whom will be elected and others appointed . The government has already suggested that certain topics , such_as whether Nigeria should remain a unified country , will be off limits . Gana promises that decisions &quot; will be deeply respected and implemented. &quot; But he characterizes the decisions as &quot; recommendations , &quot; suggesting that Abacha will still have the final say . Although foreign governments denounced Abacha ' s coup , most diplomats in Nigeria now have decided to wait and see what the general does . &quot; Their moves so far have been positive , &quot; one Western ambassador said . &quot; But power sometimes becomes a heady thing. &quot; President Clinton recently announced that the U.S._government will deny visas to members of Nigeria ' s military government , a decision that may be painful this year for rich government officials who want to follow their national soccer team to the World Cup in the United States . But no more biting sanctions are in the offing for Nigeria , which exports $ 5 billion a year in oil to the United States . Abacha himself remains an enigma . Some opponents contend that he is more cunning than Babangida , the close friend he helped bring_to power in 1985 . But Abiola , who has known both men for years , said Abacha &quot; isn ' t 1 % as bright as Babangida. &quot; Trained in the United States and Britain , Abacha has , like most men in uniform in Nigeria , become wealthy . Among his holdings is a charter airline , which flew between Lagos and New York until August , when the U.S._government banned direct flights because of lax security at the Lagos airport . Abacha has called_for &quot; a new era of discipline &quot; to end corruption in the government as well as private industry . But his spokesman said , &quot; We won ' t waste our time &quot; with probes into the past , investigations that would likely target him . Optimists in Nigeria believe that Abacha just wants a comfortable retirement . Soldiers have ruled Nigeria for 22 of the last 26 years , but the pressure for democratic change now sweeping Africa , evident in last June ' s elections in Nigeria , has never been greater . &quot; Nigeria realizes it has to pay decent regard for the opinions of the world now , &quot; said a Western diplomat with more_than three decades ' experience in Nigeria . &quot; They can ' t just go their own way any longer. &quot;</TEXT>
