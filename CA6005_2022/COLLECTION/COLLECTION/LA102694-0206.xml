   <HEADLINE> INDIA PLAGUE EPIDEMIC CALLED ' LIMITED OUTBREAK '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The epidemic of plague that terrified Indians , generated scary headlines and stampeded some nations into weaving a cordon sanitaire around this country last month was , in fact , a &quot; limited outbreak , &quot; U.S. and Russian public health experts reported Tuesday . After a 10-day investigation , members of the two-nation fact-finding group said they couldn ' t cite a single case of transmission of the dread disease from its epicenter in western India to New Delhi , Bombay , Calcutta , Madras or any of India ' s other major cities , which they said can be considered &quot; plague-free. &quot; Armed with the conclusions of the specialists sent here by World_Health_Organization Director General Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima , the U.N. health agency called_for an end to air and sea travel and trade restrictions against India that are still being enforced by some countries . &quot; We are telling the world the same thing we are telling you : that plague has been controlled in India and it is safe to travel here , &quot; a New Delhi-based WHO executive said at a news_conference . The experts , stressing that their conclusions are tentative because of the brevity of their inquiry , depicted a public health situation in the wretched , crowded , working-class areas of the city of Surat that was potentially catastrophic but was brought under_control rather fast . &quot; Our feelings were , the ( pneumonic_plague ) outbreak was probably fairly limited , with most cases occurring in the first week to 10 days , and most of what was seen after that time was indeed not plague but some of the other diseases that occur there : tuberculosis , malaria , dengue_fever , typhoid , enteric_fever , &quot; said Dr. David Dennis of the Centers_for_Disease_Control laboratory in Fort Collins , Colo . The conclusions of the WHO-sponsored team will be welcome news in India , where Prakash H . Mathani , acting president of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations , has claimed that losses in foreign sales of textiles , foodstuffs and other products because of embargoes and canceled orders linked to the plague will top $ 1.2 billion . Indian media and some politicians have blasted local and national authorities for not doing enough to stem the spread of disease through the slums of Surat . Panicked at the plague outbreak in the diamond-cutting and artificial-silk-weaving center near the Arabian_Sea , an estimated 300 # 000 to 400 # 000 fled the city . Dennis said that , in_general , the actions of authorities , including widespread distribution of antibiotics that are effective against plague , prevented an &quot; explosive situation &quot; from turning_into disaster . &quot; If it hadn ' t been identified and if the public health machinery hadn ' t moved_into place as rapidly as it did , there could have been many_more fatalities , &quot; Dennis said . Within three days of the identification of the culprit virus , Yersinia pestis , among some of Surat ' s residents , 95 % of those remaining in the city were taking the antibiotic tetracycline , Dennis said . The four Americans and two Russians , assisted by WHO personnel , examined blood samples and tissue specimens , scanned hospital records and autopsy reports and interrogated people who had experienced plague-like symptoms . Dr. Viktor V . Maleev , deputy director of the Central Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology in Moscow and a clinical specialist in the effects of plague on the human organism , said &quot; as few as 15 , 20 people in Surat may have died of plague &quot; rather than the officially reported 52 . &quot; I know it from the documents that Indian doctors gave me , &quot; Maleev explained . &quot; For example , I have a paper here where the cause of death is recorded as ' suspected plague , ' and the diagnosis is marked ' not available. ' Or they died on the way to the hospital , and no one conducted an autopsy . Can you say they died of plague ? that ' s hard to say. &quot; As recently as two weeks ago , Indian authorities spoke_of more_than 2 # 700 suspected cases , but Dennis said many of them proved not to be plague carriers . Only one person stricken with the disease reached a major city , New Delhi , the American official said . But as far as could be determined he gave no one else the disease . Dennis ' remarks meant that the exodus from the city of more_than 2 million had not spread the disease throughout the country , as had been feared . The exact cause of what Maleev termed &quot; one of the largest outbreaks in recent years of primary pneumonic_plague &quot; remained a mystery . The team was only able to find a &quot; circumstantial link &quot; between the happenings in Surat in Gujarat state and a resurgence in August of another form of plague , the bubonic , in the Beed district of neighboring Maharashtra state 240 miles to the southeast . Dennis cautioned that because of the methods he and his colleagues used and the short time they were at_work , their conclusions &quot; may_not be set_in stone. &quot; He said follow-up studies are necessary , which could take months .</TEXT>
