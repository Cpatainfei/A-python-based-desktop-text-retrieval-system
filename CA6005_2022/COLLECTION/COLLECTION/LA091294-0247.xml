   <HEADLINE> THE 46TH ANNUAL EMMY AWARDS ; THE LOOK : WHAT THEY WORE ; SCATTERSHOT GLAMOUR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dressing for the Emmy Awards is no easy feat . For one thing , the Pasadena event lands on a seasonal cusp -- not quite fall but no longer summer . And there ' s the gnawing awareness that , hey , it ' s only the Emmys . But somewhere between the down-home style of the Rotary_Club banquet and the glitzy heights of the Oscars lies the right look . The winners of Sunday night ' s best dressed awards left their opera gloves at_home and the beauty contest hair , well , to beauty contestants . In her short black suit , her perfectly cut hair glistening , Emmy winner Leigh Taylor-Young made her younger peers look positively vulgar . Other exquisite minimalists included Armani-clad Helen Hunt , Marlo Thomas in Vera Wang , and Michelle Pfeiffer , sparkling on husband David E . Kelley ' s arm , also in Armani . By far , the evening ' s most striking style moment occurred when the sisters from &quot; Sisters &quot; took_the_stage -- Swoosie Kurtz , Patricia Kalember and Julianne Phillips ( the good girls ) , all_in white , bad-girl Sela Ward dressed in black . ( Ward later waltzed off with an Emmy , so we guess nice girls do finish last. ) Speaking of bad girls , Roseanne continued to show the world her , uh , shapely legs , this time in an itty-bitty skating dress . Her soft and subtle hair and makeup were improvements , though , over the Liz-Taylor-on-a-bad-day look she wore for last week ' s MTV Awards . There were other gals who seemed in search of a style , any style . The show ' s co-hosts , Patricia Richardson and Ellen DeGeneres , started off the evening_dressed like a_couple_of housewives headed for a rare night on the town . Housewives dripping in diamonds , that is . Each fared better after a change -- DeGeneres switching to a velvet Anne Klein smoking_jacket and sneakers , Richardson into a flattering cranberry off-the-shoulder gown . This neckline does wonders for the post-40 set . Meredith Baxter , for example , looked stunning in it . Men , of course , have it so_much easier . But whose bright idea was it to ignore hundreds of years of perfectly good tradition and wear a black shirt underneath his tuxedo ? Garry Shandling , Dennis Franz , Tom Skerritt and Tim Allen did the black shirt look . But at least they were shirts . &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; hunk David Caruso couldn ' t even bother to button_up , slapping on a T-shirt instead . And , guys , could we go_back to the old black_tie ? When Jerry Van Dyke shows_up tieless , you know the look has lost its edge .</TEXT>
