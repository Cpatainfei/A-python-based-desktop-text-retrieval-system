   <HEADLINE> DOUBLE DOSE OF RODGERS &amp; HAMMERSTEIN ; VIDEO : FOX OFFERS SIX MUSICALS AT LOWER PRICES AND WITH BONUS SOUNDTRACK AUDIOCASSETTES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Free audiotapes ! that ' s what FoxVideo ' s promotion of vintage musicals amounts to . Videotapes of six Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musicals will now be packaged with an audiotape of its soundtrack . The packages , due out Tuesday , are &quot; The Sound of Music , &quot; &quot; Oklahoma ! , &quot; &quot; The King and I , &quot; &quot; Carousel , &quot; &quot; South Pacific &quot; and &quot; State Fair. &quot; For consumers , the biggest plus is the price . Rather than the cost increasing because of the addition of an audiotape , it ' s actually going_down . The videos are $ 20 , except for the two-cassette &quot; Sound of Music , &quot; which will sell for $ 24 . Until now , five of the videotapes cost $ 24 each , with &quot; Sound of Music &quot; ' at $ 30 . &quot; It ' s a way of remarketing a product that had stopped showing any sales return , &quot; FoxVideo marketing director Deborah Mitchell explained . &quot; These soundtracks are available in_stores , but I ' m sure the sales rate is small. &quot; FoxVideo also has added trailers and newsreel footage to the videos . And &quot; State Fair &quot; also includes previously unreleased outtakes . Hardly anything has been added_to the audiotapes , except some songs on the &quot; The Sound of Music &quot; soundtrack . FoxVideo successfully inaugurated this video / soundtrack promotion last year with &quot; The Last of the Mohicans , &quot; with the package selling for $ 25 . Mitchell declined to reveal figures but said that the package did double the expected business . With movie soundtracks being so popular , from &quot; The Lion King &quot; to &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; to &quot; Above the Rim , &quot; don ' t be surprised if other video companies start using this dual-package plan , particularly to rekindle interest in titles that are a_few years old . Multimedia The Muppets always seemed like a natural for the interactive market . They ' ll finally make their debut next year , on games and CD-ROMs . . . . Clint Eastwood debuts on CD-ROM next year on a disc devoted to his life and times . He ' s helping with the project , even doing an exclusive interview . It will be fan-oriented as well as providing substantive information geared to scholars . . . . Laserdisc distributor Image Entertainment plans to enter the CD-ROM market in October , with titles mainly in the action / adventure genre , such_as &quot; The Terminator &quot; and &quot; RoboCop , &quot; priced in the $ 10- $ 20 range . Special_Interest For fans of old TV Westerns , the two-hour documentary &quot; TV ' s Western Heroes &quot; is a must . It ' s a collection of clips about series such_as &quot; Maverick , &quot; &quot; Yancy Derringer &quot; and &quot; The Rifleman , &quot; featuring the introductory segments , ads and trailers as well as footage from the shows . Host Will Hutchins , who starred in the ' Sugarfoot &quot; series , dispenses information geared to nostalgia buffs . From GoodTimes at $ 20 .

Featuring Nastassja Kinski and Otto Sander , this one is also about angels on Earth . Interesting because of offbeat subject_matter and existential textures , but not as_good_as the original . Still , for foreign-film buffs , definitely worth a look . On Wednesday , Kino is releasing Japanese director Akira Kurosawa ' s famed &quot; Dersu Uzala , &quot; about a Mongolian adventurer . Made_for a Russian studio , it won the 1975 Oscar for best foreign-language film . . . . The French drama &quot; Dr. Petiot , &quot; about a French doctor who killed Jews during World_War_II , is_due on Aug . 24 from World Artists . What ' s New on Video : &quot; Beethoven ' s 2nd &quot; ( MCA / Universal ) . Kids in particular should appreciate this cozy sequel to the 1992 hit comedy about the Newton family and its Saint Bernard named Beethoven . In the sequel , the dog ' s mate has pups and then is snatched by a vengeful dognaper ( Debi Mazur ) . The stressed-out dad ( Charles Grodin ) must cope_with both dog problems and the romantic traumas of his teen daughter ( Nicholle Tom ) . Amiable , entertaining fluff . &quot; Intersection &quot; ( Paramount ) . If you rent this movie figuring that a drama starring charismatic stars Richard Gere and Sharon Stone can ' t be all that bad , you ' ll most likely be sorry . During an auto accident , the messy life of an architect ( Gere ) flashes before his eyes . He ' s torn between a cold wife ( Stone ) and a bubbly mistress ( Lolita Davidovitch ) . Convoluted , confusing and unsatisfying . &quot; My Girl 2 &quot; ( Columbia TriStar ) . The further adventures of bright , imaginative Vada , played by Anna Chlumsky . In the early ' 70s , the 13-year-old heroine spends her spring vacation in L.A. , visiting her uncle ( Richard Mazur ) and trying to find_out more about her mother , who died when she was an infant . Meanwhile , she finds a mate ( Austin O ' Brien ) , the son of her uncle ' s girlfriend . Generally likable , largely because of the interesting lead character and another charming performance by Chlumsky -- but it turns very maudlin in the second_half . &quot; The Ref &quot; ( Touchstone ) . A surly burglar ( Denis Leary ) holds a warring married_couple ( Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey ) captive in their home_in the New England suburbs . Many critics dismissed this as shrill , crude and loaded with overkill humor . Those who savor oddball , nasty black comedies might find it quite savory . &quot; Chasers &quot; ( Warner ) . An action comedy that ' s similar in theme to the 1973 Jack Nicholson movie , &quot; The Last Detail. &quot; It ' s the screwball adventures of two Navy cops ( Tom Berenger and William McNamara ) escorting a rebellious female prisoner ( Erika Eleniak ) through the South to a military base . Directed by Dennis Hopper , it ' s lightweight , noisy , predictable , feel-good entertainment that ' s low on laughs .</TEXT>
