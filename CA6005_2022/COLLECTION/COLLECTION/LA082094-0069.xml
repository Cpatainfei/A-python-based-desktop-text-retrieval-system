   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN SERBS TRAIN BIG GUNS ON RELIEF PLANES OVER SARAJEVO , U.N. SAYS ; BALKANS : AIRLIFT IS SUSPENDED . ATTACKS ON PEACEKEEPERS CONTINUE , WITH FRENCH SOLDIER SLAIN BY A SNIPER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The weapons exclusion zone decreed around this city in February is so routinely violated now that Bosnian Serbs have been observed training antiaircraft_guns on humanitarian relief planes from inside a U.N. artillery impoundment site , a U.N. spokesman conceded Friday . The airlift of food and medicine to the Bosnian capital was suspended late Thursday after a 120-millimeter mortar round fired from another location within the exclusion zone landed on the tarmac of the U.N.-controlled airport . In a further sign that the relative peace of the past six months has deteriorated , a French peacekeeper was shot to death Friday morning while on patrol in central Sarajevo -- the first sniping casualty since last weekend ' s agreement by the warring factions to cease targeting people in the streets . The latest admissions that rebel forces have heavy_weapons in offensive positions and virtual free run of U.N. weapons containment sites have made a mockery of the cease-fire proclaimed here in February . It was backed by NATO threats to launch air strikes against offending forces . U.N. military observers reported in a confidential cable to mission headquarters that they witnessed Bosnian Serb gunmen on Wednesday manning three 40-millimeter antiaircraft_guns &quot; being trained on aircraft approaching and departing Sarajevo airport. &quot; They described the weapons as &quot; set_up and prepared for action , &quot; in clear violation of the weapons exclusion zone . No U.N. soldiers were in_sight of the depot in Bosnian Serb-held Ilidza , and monitors were unable to gain entrance or make contact with rebel commanders . It was at the same weapons depot , supposedly under the watch of Ukrainian peacekeepers , that Bosnian Serb gunmen seized a tank , two armored personnel_carriers and an antiaircraft_gun two weeks ago . That event prompted an air strike by North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization forces that destroyed a World_War II-era mounted gun the rebels had also deployed into the exclusion zone . But from within another of the 10 U.N.-monitored weapons sites , in the suburb of Bare , Bosnian Serb rebels fired on Bosnian government troops last week , confirming that many of the tanks and guns that were supposed to have been rendered inoperable in detention are combat-ready and within the rebels ' easy reach . &quot; The total situation is not very satisfactory , &quot; U.N. spokesman Maj . Rob Annink said of the latest cease-fire and exclusion zone violations . The U.N. mission wants the number of containment sites reduced and the heavy_weapons consolidated for more effective monitoring , Annink said . &quot; But this has to be negotiated , &quot; he added , conceding that the Bosnian Serbs have refused to allow any change that would hamper access to their impounded guns . All heavy_weapons within a 12-mile radius of Sarajevo were to have been surrendered or withdrawn by Feb . 21 , according to the NATO ultimatum . But in an attempt to avoid firing on Bosnian Serb positions and compromising the neutrality of the U.N. peacekeeping force , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia , declared more_than 100 tanks , guns and other heavy_weapons still inside the cordon to be under the &quot; effective control &quot; of his monitoring forces . The NATO ultimatum was then further diluted by the U.N. mission here to allow Bosnian Serb rebels to &quot; repair and maintain &quot; weapons they were said to have surrendered but in many cases simply allowed U.N. troops to observe from nearby . That concession has allowed the rebels to gradually take_over control of the weapons and restore them to working order . A European officer at the mission command_post here also conceded that a U.N.-mediated agreement aimed at tracking_down and punishing snipers has not yet been put into force because Bosnian Serb gunmen refuse to grant U.N. patrols access to the high-rise apartment_buildings of the Grbavica neighborhood from which the rebels are known to shelter snipers . A 22-year-old French soldier patrolling the front_line between Grbavica and downtown Sarajevo died of his wounds a_few hours after being &quot; deliberately targeted , &quot; said another mission spokesman , Maj . Dacre Holloway . He said the location and identity of the sniper could not be determined . More_than 100 U.N. troops have been killed on_duty since the mission deployed to Croatia in early 1992 . It has since expanded its involvement to include Bosnia and Macedonia . More_than 1 # 000 soldiers have been wounded . The mounting toll and the increasing frustration with the lack of progress in negotiating an end to the conflict have stepped_up pressure in European_countries with troops in the Balkans to withdraw their forces and lift an arms embargo shackling the Bosnian government , effectively leaving the conflict to be resolved on the battlefield . Meantime , Fikret Abdic , the embattled rebel Muslim leader , surrendered Friday to forces loyal to the Bosnian government in the northwest enclave of Bihac , the United Nations ' Holloway said . Abdic , a former member of the Bosnian presidency , split with Sarajevo last year over his willingness to deal with nearby Serbs . He proclaimed the land he controlled the autonomous province of Western Bosnia . But Abdic had seen two-thirds of his fighting brigades knocked_out by government troops . Earlier this week , he rejected Sarajevo ' s ultimatum to surrender within a week .</TEXT>
