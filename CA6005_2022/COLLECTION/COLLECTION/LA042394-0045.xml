   <HEADLINE> SUPPORT FOUND FOR U.S. ROLE IN POPULATION_CONTROL EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Americans generally view world population growth as a problem and support U.S. efforts to slow the increasing numbers of Earth ' s inhabitants , according to a poll released Wednesday . But Roman_Catholics and Protestants who attend church regularly are less likely to support specific policies such_as legal abortion and family_planning programs than other sectors of the electorate , the poll shows . The poll , released during a briefing at the United Nations , was commissioned by the Pew Global Stewardship Initiative . The briefing occurred in the final days of the Preparatory Committee_meeting for September ' s International Conference on Population and Development , to be held_in Cairo . The findings could provide moral and political support for the Clinton_Administration ' s aggressive involvement in the population and development debate -- an involvement that has turned the U.S. policy of the last 12 years on its head , reversing the government ' s stance at the last international population conference in Mexico_City 10 years ago . That stance has set the United States at_odds with the Vatican and a handful of mostly Central_American_nations such_as Honduras and Nicaragua , where the governments have close ties to a conservative Catholic hierarchy that fiercely opposes much of the draft plan_of_action being prepared_for the Cairo meeting . The key to U.S. attitudes on population appears to be freedom of choice , with vast majorities of Americans apparently agreeing that all men and women in the world who want birth_control should be able to get_it and that people should feel free to have as_many children as they can properly raise . According to the Pew poll , in a random_sample survey of 2 # 080 individuals who reported voting in the 1992 presidential election , nearly half -- 48 % -- rated population growth as a &quot; very serious &quot; problem . That ranks the issue on a par with the spread of nuclear_weapons and above threats to the world ' s environment but somewhat below disease and hunger in other countries . In the poll , 52 % said they believed population growth will have a negative impact on_their_own quality_of_life while 55 % said population growth may harm international economic development . Asked whether they agree with those who say nature will take_care of balancing the Earth ' s population or with those who say there is a need for human intervention , 64 % said they agree with the interventionists , while 29 % agreed that nature will balance the scales . A majority -- 55 % -- said they favor U.S. sponsorship of programs overseas to help other countries slow population growth , with 19 % &quot; very much &quot; in favor and 36 % &quot; somewhat &quot; in favor . Among the 42 % opposed , 23 % said they were somewhat opposed and 19 % said they were very opposed . The poll results released April 20 also broke_down the respondents by whether they were Protestant or Roman_Catholic and whether they frequently attended worship services . Generally , Protestants and Roman_Catholics are typical of the U.S. population , said Vince Breglio , a Republican pollster and one of three pollsters that conducted the survey . On a scale of 1 to 10 , with 10 designating a &quot; very serious &quot; problem , Protestants gave rapid population growth a 7.0 rating , while Catholics gave it a 7.2 rating . Frequent churchgoers -- both Roman_Catholic and Protestant -- rated rapid population growth somewhat lower , giving it a 6.9 rating . The general population rated the population growth issue at 7.1. Catholics and Protestants generally favored U.S. involvement in population programs , but that support diminished with the frequency of church attendance . Asked if they favor U.S. sponsorship of voluntary family_planning programs in developing countries , 57 % of Protestants and 58 % of Catholics said yes . But 52 % of those describing themselves as frequent churchgoers said yes . Overall , 59 % of those polled said they favor such programs . On the volatile issue of abortion , the survey asked participants how well their feelings were described by the statement , &quot; I believe all women should have the right to choose abortion. &quot; Among Protestants , 51 % answered &quot; very well , &quot; 16 % said &quot; somewhat , &quot; while 7 % said &quot; not well &quot; and 25 % responded &quot; not at all. &quot; Among Catholics , responses were 53 % &quot; very well , &quot; 17 % &quot; somewhat , &quot; 9 % &quot; not well &quot; and 19 % &quot; not at all. &quot; Frequent churchgoers answered 37 % &quot; very well , &quot; 17 % &quot; somewhat , &quot; 9 % &quot; not well &quot; and 35 % &quot; not at all. &quot;</TEXT>
