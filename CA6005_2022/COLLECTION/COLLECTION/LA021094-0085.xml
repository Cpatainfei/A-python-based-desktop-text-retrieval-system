   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; RISK TO CHILDREN FEARED IN LACK OF SEISMIC LAWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 200 # 000 children in licensed day_care in Los Angeles County are potentially among the most vulnerable in an earthquake because no regulations exist requiring safety_glass , bolted bookcases , extra supplies of food and water or even working flashlights in child-care centers , experts say . Structural seismic safety regulations that apply to public_schools do not apply to day-care centers , some of which are in former public_school buildings that do not meet state requirements , said Joel McRonald , chief of special programs in the state architect ' s office . Public_school buildings are required to have more reinforcement than other structures , such_as extra bracing in walls and extra strong connections between foundations , walls , and ceilings . Although buildings that do not have such extra reinforcement still may be structurally sound , McRonald said it is a pet peeve of his that regulations are less stringent for day-care centers than for public_schools . &quot; If we ' re mandating ( that ) K-12 can ' t be in the buildings , &quot; he said , &quot; why are we allowing preschoolers ? &quot; Many parents were relieved not to be separated from their children during the earthquake . And in the wake of the disaster , many are shocked when they hear that there are virtually no regulations requiring earthquake preparedness in licensed family day-care homes beyond maintaining a list of emergency contact numbers . Requirements at school-type day-care centers are only slightly stricter . Such facilities must hold semiannual disaster drills and assign staff to handle specific functions , but child-care workers say there is sometimes little real preparedness even though the plans exist on paper . The quake was a wake-up call_for many parents and child-care providers that they are not as prepared as they should be . Looking_at the wreckage of day-care centers or homes of day-care providers , parents realize that tragedy may have been averted only because of the early hour of the temblor . For many Angelenos , day_care is as essential as water or transportation . With many day-care centers and homes closed because of earthquake damage , some parents cannot go_to work to earn income they need to put their lives back together , and some people have lost their jobs because they have had to stay home and care_for children . According to estimates by the nonprofit Childcare Resource Center , about 10 % to 15 % of licensed child-care providers in the San Fernando Valley were shut_down for up_to three weeks after the earthquake . Although virtually all school-type day-care centers have reopened , dozens of family day-care homes serving hundreds of children remain closed due_to earthquake damage . Day-care centers in private homes are inspected once every three years , and inspectors are not required to check for earthquake preparedness . Because such centers are in homes , they often contain ordinary hazards such_as china_cabinets and unsecured bookshelves and television_sets . Moreover , the ratio of children to adults is higher in the family centers than in most homes . A single adult at a licensed family day-care facility may legally be responsible_for up_to four infants , or three infants and three preschoolers -- more_than could be carried to safety by one person at a time . In unlicensed homes , where hundreds of thousands of Los Angeles children are cared_for , the situation may be even worse , experts say , because many_more children may be supervised by a single adult and the houses are not inspected . One licensed family-care provider in Canoga Park shuddered at the thought of an earthquake occurring when she was alone with the six children in her care . As it was , when the earthquake occurred at 4:31 a.m. , she and her husband had only tiny flashlights , so they lit candles -- which she now knows could have caused a gas explosion . In addition , a large unbolted wall_unit stands_in the room where the children play . She pointed_out that she has a week ' s supply of food on_hand , but then realized that most of it is in a freezer and would quickly spoil if the electricity failed . &quot; Among family day-care homes , a lot don ' t have any idea about earthquake preparedness . Zero . None , &quot; said Michael Bailey , owner of a Northridge child-care referral agency . However , many family day-care providers had taken precautions . Diane Wilson , who cares_for several children in her Granada Hills home , had her husband bolt bookcases to the walls , and she keeps water , food , tools , tents and other emergency supplies in the garage . Still , when the earthquake hit , the house was such a wreck that family members suffered minor injuries trying to get outside . After their house was yellow-tagged , allowing only limited entry , the Wilsons baby-sat children in a tent in their yard . Because of the light regulation of day-care providers and their wide variations in safety preparations , it is up_to parents to ensure that their children ' s day-care environments are safe , experts agree . Day-care centers are not covered under the Field Act -- the law requiring extra safe school structures -- because at the time the law was passed in the early 1930s few centers existed . The act covers only public_schools , not private institutions such_as day_schools or child-care centers . Tom Tobin , executive_director of the state Seismic Safety Commission , expressed concern for the safety of children . He recalled that after the Whittier Narrows quake in 1989 , he was dismayed to see that a heavy cornice had fallen_off a masonry church , plunged through a roof and landed on a crib in the church ' s day-care center . Fortunately , no children were there at the time , he said . But he said the commission has not studied the issue of regulating day-care centers for earthquake safety . He said it would examine damage reports to see what new initiatives might be appropriate . But many child-care advocates are wary of increasing regulations , which they say could raise the cost of care_for already-strapped parents , or force day-care providers out of business . Regardless of regulations , many operators say the quake has prompted them to beef_up their earthquake preparations . &quot; It ' s actually been a very good learning experience , &quot; said Donna Halsey , who had to shut_down temporarily all three of the centers she owns in the West Valley . Halsey says she will do a better job of securing furniture to walls , and make_sure that flashlights are where they are supposed to be . She said she will stock more water and put the television inside a latched cupboard instead of on top of it , unbolted . One model for earthquake preparedness is the Caltech / JPL Child Educational Center , where seismologists Lucile Jones and Egill Hauksson have their children . At this center , where the Sierra Madre fault is visible from the parking_lot , the 90-member staff seems as well-trained as a National_Guard unit . In addition to monthly drills , the 200-child center holds half-day earthquake exercises every six months , deploying triage tents , walkie-talkies , extra water and food and staffers trained in search-and-rescue techniques . Babies are popped into cribs with heavy-duty wagon_wheels , and preschoolers put_on emergency backpacks as they file_out onto a field . Assigned teams of staffers set_up everything from a communications center to a morgue . Bobbie Edwards , who is in_charge of the center ' s earthquake preparations , emphasizes the need for parental involvement . On the school ' s regularly scheduled &quot; parent work_days , &quot; parents helped bolt_down fans and bookshelves , saving the school labor costs . The center also asks parents to contribute a $ 5 annual earthquake preparedness fee and provide the earthquake backpacks . Teaching children about earthquakes will help calm them when disaster strikes , Edwards says . Jones periodically brings_in a seismograph for show-and-tell sessions , and uses a block of Jell-O with a piece of wood on it to show how buildings wobble , depending_on how close they are to the epicenter . At this center , children as young as 18 months know how to duck and cover their heads . Elyssa Nelson , director of the center , is proud_of the aplomb with which 3-year-old Jenna Muirhead handled the earthquake : &quot; That one was really good practice , &quot; she told her mother . Dealing with the psychological aftermath of the quake is perhaps the biggest task for most day-care providers now . Although many preschoolers appear to be unaffected by the jolts , others are suffering sleep problems , bed-wetting and even vomiting because of the stress . Gayle Tolbert-Myles , who runs a family day-care home near La Brea Avenue and Washington Boulevard , says she is struggling to deal with her own trauma while reassuring the children . She moved_into her present house after fleeing a neighborhood that went_up in flames during the riots , and says the stress is cumulative for adults and children . &quot; One little_girl was playing_on the ( toy ) phone . She says , ' We need help , this house is shaking and cracking , ' &quot; Tolbert-Myles said . Several of the children in her care were left homeless by the earthquake . Tolbert-Myles has asked parents to bring family photos to soothe the children if they must be separated from their parents . &quot; I can ' t prevent an earthquake . But I can be prepared , &quot; she said . &quot; The rest is in the Lord ' s hands. &quot; Caring_for Children Parents need to work with day-care providers to make_sure that their children ' s environment is safe and that their post-disaster emotional needs are met , experts say .
