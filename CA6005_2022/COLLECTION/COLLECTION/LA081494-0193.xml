   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / SUNDANCE UPDATE : WHATEVER HAPPENED TO FEST FAVES ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Come August , anyone who ' d been caught_up in the excitement of January ' s Sundance Film Festival begins to wonder , &quot; What happened to all those promising movies ? &quot; Ever since Steven Soderbergh ' s surprise hit , &quot; sex , lies and videotape , &quot; made its debut at the Park City , Utah , festival in 1989 , Sundance has become the place for Hollywood to find young talent . For the two weeks of the festival , struggling directors and writers can bask in comparisons to Soderbergh , Quentin Tarantino ( &quot; Reservoir Dogs &quot; ) or Richard Linklater ( &quot; Slacker &quot; ) as agents sniff around them like eager bloodhounds . And then suddenly the party ' s over and reality sets_in . Months go_by , and the films are temporarily forgotten . Of the more widely discussed debuts at this year ' s festival , only in the past month or so have a_few of these works by first- or second-time filmmakers been released , including Rose Troche ' s lesbian romantic comedy &quot; Go_Fish &quot; ; David O . Russell ' s &quot; Spanking the Monkey , &quot; the tale of one young_man ' s worst summer vacation , and the out-of-competition &quot; Mi Vida Loca , &quot; a saga of Echo Park Latinas directed by Allison Anders . But where are the other standout items : Tom Noonan ' s Grand_Jury Prize_winner &quot; What Happened Was . . . , &quot; the ultimate date-night drama ; the two Filmmakers ' Trophy winners , &quot; Clerks , &quot; Kevin Smith ' s comedy about employees in a convenience_store , and Boaz Yakin ' s inner-city thriller &quot; Fresh , &quot; and the acclaimed documentaries &quot; Hoop Dreams , &quot; about two teens with basketball fever , and &quot; Martha and Ethel , &quot; a tale of two nannies ? Most are actually due this fall and winter . The long lag time between festival and release , says Liz Manne , senior_vice_president of marketing at Fine Line Pictures , distributors of &quot; Spanking the Monkey &quot; and &quot; Hoop Dreams , &quot; is_due to the big difference between the warm collegiality of a film festival and the cold realities of the marketplace . With each of these releases , it ' s a matter of &quot; doing the work to take the excitement and hype of the festival-goers and extend it to the population as_a_whole , &quot; she says . This requires a great_deal of intensive labor and often , cosmetic_surgery , which can take four to six months at least -- including everything from blowing_up the film to 35-millimeter , to slapping_on a new soundtrack , and even editing . Then the film has to be screened for its target audience , a marketing campaign must be developed and just the right release date selected . How is all this accomplished without losing the head of steam the film picked_up at Sundance ? Deftly , say independent film distributors . One misstep and the film can disappear without a trace and a potentially promising career can be pushed_back to square one . Reviews help . But &quot; artistic integrity doesn ' t always translate into commerciality , &quot; says Goldwyn ' s vice_president of distribution , Eamonn Bowles , who plans to roll_out &quot; What Happened Was . . . &quot; very slowly this fall , when it goes head-to-head with sophisticated fare from the major studios . Fall is popular because by the time all_the work is done preparing these Sundance films , it ' s too late for a spring release . During summer , independent film companies release films at their own risk ; the blockbuster season should be the worst time to launch a specialized low-budget film . Yet that ' s exactly when Bowles reasoned that Goldwyn should go_with &quot; Go_Fish , &quot; hooking its release onto the celebrations surrounding June ' s 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots , a gay liberation cornerstone . &quot; Stonewall helped put the film on the map , &quot; says Bowles . And the payoff on the $ 100 # 000-budgeted comedy has been $ 2 million to date . Summer has also proved a charm for &quot; Spanking the Monkey , &quot; says Manne , as counterprogramming against the studio blockbusters . The youth-oriented comedy has done_well in limited release , with reviews even stronger than those from Sundance . Which is another reason to give some breathing room between the festival and a film ' s release . At Sundance critics sometimes overdose on films ; a bit of distance and subsequent festival exposure at Cannes , Toronto and New York can give a clearer picture of a film ' s relative strengths and weaknesses . Miramax is launching the fall with &quot; Fresh , &quot; a clear-eyed look_at a tough inner-city New York kid , on Aug . 31 . After a summer of action and comedy , &quot; audiences are starved for this kind of film , &quot; says David Dinerstein , vice_president of marketing at Miramax . Miramax is also planning on &quot; Clerks , &quot; Smith ' s $ 27 # 000 first feature , for this fall , but much polishing -- and a much-publicized appeal for its NC-17 rating -- still lies ahead . Between now and its Oct . 21 release date , when the film ' s core college audience will be settled in school , Miramax will screen &quot; Clerks &quot; outside on a screen at this weekend ' s Woodstock reunion -- a captive audience if there ever was one -- and at university and college towns around the country . The preparation for Fine Line ' s &quot; Hoop Dreams &quot; will be trickier . Though it won the Sundance audience documentary prize , nonfiction films are always a tough sell . As with &quot; Spanking , &quot; says Manne , picking the right release date for Steve James ' seven-years-in-the-making film is crucial . Fine Line will launch &quot; Hoop Dreams &quot; roughly at the start of the NBA basketball_season . Jyll Johnstone ' s &quot; Martha and Ethel &quot; is a documentary with a less-obvious hook . The history of two nannies is a definite adult , art-house subject like &quot; What Happened Was . . . . &quot; In fact , by the time &quot; Martha and Ethel &quot; finally opens early next year , the 17th annual Sundance Film Festival will be in_progress . And the distributors will have to start all_over again. *</TEXT>
