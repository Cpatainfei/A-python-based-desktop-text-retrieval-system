   <HEADLINE> U.S. PUBLICLY ASSAILS U.N. ' S BOSNIA ENVOY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Escalating a battle over U.N. actions in Bosnia-Herzegovina , the United States issued an unusual public slap at U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi on Friday , saying he was too lenient when he let Bosnian Serbs move tanks through the weapons-exclusion zone around Sarajevo . State_Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the United States strongly objected to the violation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-enforced zone and said : &quot; We would like to see ( Akashi ) do a better job. &quot; The public complaint was the latest salvo in a feud between the Clinton_Administration and U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ' s man in Bosnia . Last month , Akashi publicly derided U.S. policy in Bosnia as &quot; somewhat reticent , somewhat afraid , timid and tentative. &quot; Diplomats said the Administration ' s public complaint came_close to a demand that Boutros-Ghali either fire Akashi or publicly discipline him , but the U.N. chief has shown no inclination to do so . Boutros-Ghali said in Geneva that Akashi &quot; continues to have my full confidence . There ' s no question of any kind of replacement. &quot; The immediate issue was a decision by Akashi to let Bosnian Serbs move tanks across the 12-mile exclusion zone around Sarajevo . NATO ordered the Bosnian Serbs to move all tanks and other heavy_weapons out of the zone in February and enforced the decision with air_power . &quot; We certainly did not support a decision of this type , &quot; Shelly said . &quot; We do not concur in decisions that acquiesce in actions that violate the exclusion zone. &quot; Asked whether the United States had confidence in Akashi , she read from a prepared response : &quot; We do not support calls_for his resignation . We would like to see him do a better job. &quot; The Muslim-led Bosnian government has said it no longer will deal with Akashi and demanded his resignation . A Bosnian Serb spokesman , on the other hand , praised the Japanese diplomat as &quot; neutral. &quot; Behind that argument lay a broader , more important dispute : Akashi has often compromised with the Bosnian Serbs to protect U.N. peacekeeping forces from attack -- even though that has sometimes meant softening the impact of U.N. or NATO decisions . The Administration , struggling to convey a sense of Western power and resolve after two years of impotent diplomacy , has seen Akashi ' s attempts at conciliation as conflicting with that goal . Last month , the Administration was upset when Akashi refused to approve air strikes against Serbian forces firing on the Muslim town of Gorazde in violation of a NATO ultimatum . Akashi responded by calling the United States &quot; timid &quot; for refusing to put ground troops of its own into Bosnia -- drawing a complaint to Boutros-Ghali from Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations . A few weeks later , senior U.N. officials serving under Akashi told reporters in Sarajevo that they considered the United States partly to blame for the continuing war in Bosnia -- drawing another protest from Albright . Albright telephoned Boutros-Ghali again this week to complain about Akashi ' s decision to allow the Bosnian Serb tanks to move near Sarajevo . U.N. spokesman Joe Sills said Akashi &quot; reluctantly agreed &quot; to the Bosnian Serb request for an exception to the NATO order . In return , the Bosnian Serbs allowed the United Nations to send 16 observers to Brcko , in northern Bosnia , and ended a blockade of a convoy of 170 British troops . Gen . George Joulwan , NATO ' s supreme commander in Europe , reacted sharply , complaining that Akashi ' s compromise diminished the alliance ' s ability to enforce its own ultimatum . Akashi gave the Serbs permission to move seven tanks on flatbed trucks across the Sarajevo exclusion zone , but only five T-34 tanks had moved through by Friday . After the United States complained , Akashi called Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to tell him that the &quot; agreement was off , &quot; a U.N. spokesman told the Associated Press in Sarajevo . On Friday afternoon , the Serbs moved two more tanks into the exclusion zone , but U.N. forces intercepted them and took them to weapons collection depots , the AP reported .
