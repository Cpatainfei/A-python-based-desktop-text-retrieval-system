   <HEADLINE> THE CHANGING FACE OF AVIATION ; FLYING IN FORMATION ; U.S. , FOREIGN AIRLINES GLIDE INTO NEW MARKETS BY PAIRING UP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; What airline are you flying ? &quot; is becoming a more complicated question for international travelers as U.S. and foreign carriers rush to forge global alliances . British Airways passengers from Phoenix to London begin their journey aboard a USAir jet . After buying a Northwest Airlines ticket between Amsterdam and Detroit , passengers end_up with a seat on KLM Royal Dutch Airlines . American Airlines sells round_trips between New York and Johannesburg -- but a South_African Airways jet does the flying . Sharing international passengers and routes represents a dramatic new direction for many major U.S. airlines that previously had expanded overseas by flying solo . Saddled with a slow-growing , money-losing domestic market , many U.S. carriers have decided that it is cheaper , faster and less risky to move_into rapidly expanding international markets by teaming_up with foreign partners . &quot; You don ' t have to invest in new airplanes . You don ' t have to hire new pilots and flight_attendants . You can piggy back_off somebody else , &quot; said Daniel Kasper , vice_chairman of the transportation industry program for Coopers &amp; Lybrand . &quot; As a practical matter , ( this is ) the only realistic economic opportunity in the short and near term. &quot; Indeed , the government may soon give such pairings a big boost . Last year , a federal aviation commission proposed that Congress relax regulations limiting foreign ownership and control of U.S. airlines . The alliances of foreign carriers now being woven together are considered by many analysts a phase_in the evolution of world aviation . From a highly regulated industry of protected government carriers in most of the world , the business is becoming a galaxy of freely competing , privately-owned airlines . Currently , global airline partnerships take many shapes and forms , ranging from simple joint advertising agreements to outright ownership by one airline of a stake in another . The most sought after and far reaching pacts include so-called code-share agreements on international connecting flights . Code-sharing allows both British Airways and USAir , for instance , to easily promote and sell tickets on their connecting Phoenix to London trip via Philadelphia . Such arrangements long have been used by major U.S. airlines to offer connecting service with smaller commuter carriers . On a global scale , the agreements allow two carriers to jointly market and sell fully connecting international service between their two countries and other countries as well . In addition , code-shared flights are among the first listed in computerized airline reservation systems , so they attract the notice of travel_agents -- and result in more ticket sales for the allied carriers . Despite their promise , however , global alliances have not produced automatic success or profits . In fact , many of the partnerships remain costly money pits that have sucked_in hundreds of millions of dollars in investment while producing little return . The alliances are also highly vulnerable to turbulence in international and domestic aviation . Last month , aviation treaty disputes threatened to ground separate cooperation deals between USAir and British Airways , and between United Airlines and Lufthansa German Airlines . Further , although the deals offer consumers the allure of &quot; seamless travel &quot; on a single ticket , automatic transfer of baggage and access to new frequent flyer programs , the notion of dividing overseas travel between two carriers still makes many travelers wary . &quot; The reality is , customers don ' t like it , &quot; travel_agent Thomas Nulty said . &quot; Most travelers would rather fly with one carrier. &quot; Still , despite the drawbacks , both large and small airlines have sought global partners to tap into the rapid_growth and fat profits promised by the explosion of international travel . Contrasted with the stagnant U.S. domestic market , international passenger traffic is projected to grow 38 % between 1992 and 1997 , according to the International Air Transport Assn . &quot; Theoretically , both carriers benefit , &quot; explained David Hoppin , an airline consultant at MergeGlobal in Arlington , Va . &quot; In an environment of weak traffic and overcapacity , U.S. airline executives might ask themselves , ' Do we really need to have another seven flights to the Stockholm market or do we sign a deal ? ' &quot; The strategy is a marked departure from that of the 1980s and early 1990s , when the largest U.S. carriers -- American , Delta and United -- expanded overseas primarily on_their_own , spending hundreds of millions of dollars to buy routes to Asia , Europe and South_America . The shift began in_earnest last year as several major carriers announced worldwide partnerships , including USAir and British Airways , Continental Airlines and Air Canada , and United and Lufthansa . Even tiny commuter carrier AirL.A. joined forces with Mexico ' s largest carrier , Aeromexico , to offer joint Los Angeles-Tijuana service . And the trend has continued into 1994 . On a single day earlier this month , Delta Air Lines agreed to expand an existing partnership with Varig Airlines of Brazil and announced the start of a new relationship with Vietnam Airlines . &quot; It gives us an immediate presence in a place we have not been before , &quot; said Clay McConnell , a spokesman for Delta . &quot; It ' s very important for us. &quot; One of the most intimate global alliances knits Minneapolis-based Northwest together with KLM . Code-sharing lets Northwest offer its customers service to more_than 30 European cities . In return , KLM , which owns 49 % of Northwest , can sell tickets to nearly 40 cities served by its U.S. partner . Northwest flies from San Diego to Geneva via Detroit and Amsterdam -- at least in airline-reservation computers . In the real_world , however , Northwest flies from San Diego to Detroit , where the passenger climbs aboard a KLM flight to Amsterdam and then changes to another KLM plane to Geneva . The carriers have gone_further , recently announcing the launch of new business class cabins and service on international routes . A single , worldwide advertising_campaign will promote the service , and the business class cabins on KLM and Northwest jets will include the same seating , decor and amenities . &quot; What we want to do is to make_sure that the customer doesn ' t know which airline he is flying , &quot; said Barry A . Kotar , Northwest general sales manager . &quot; The customer will know us as a single product. &quot; But code-sharing -- domestic and international -- is not without its critics . U.S. consumer groups in the early 1980s grew concerned about domestic code-sharing as misleading passengers into believing they were flying a single carrier instead of two . In response , the government required airlines to reveal the nature of code-share flights on domestic and international trips . David Stempler , executive_director of Washington-based International Airline Passengers Assn. , says his group has received few complaints about international code-share flights . But that could change as the alliances grow and U.S. passengers find themselves being handed off from a familiar domestic carrier to an unknown foreign airline , he said . &quot; that ' s where some of the shock comes_in , &quot; Stempler said . &quot; We haven ' t got_into international code-sharing problems -- yet . I think it ' s still too new. &quot; Even some airlines involved in code-sharing recognize the potential for customer confusion . &quot; Philosophically , code-sharing in and of itself is a bit potentially confusing and misleading , &quot; said Tim Smith , an American Airlines spokesman . &quot; The reality of the marketplace is that it ' s there and it ' s done . To be competitive , it is the way to go. &quot; The growth of airline alliances and code-sharing has sparked international disputes and opposition from several foreign countries -- ranging from the Czech Republic to Germany -- and their carriers . Many suspiciously view code-sharing as a loophole U.S. carriers are flying through to enter their once-closed markets , some international airline and legal observers say . &quot; Those countries with airlines that are less efficient , less competitive than U.S. carriers , all_of a sudden have a problem with this code share , &quot; said Thomas McLain , who heads the international_law practice at Perkins Coie in Century City . &quot; It has never been a problem before . Now , this is a threat. &quot; Some U.S. airlines also feel threatened by the code-sharing alliance of British Airways and USAir . American and Delta in particular have lashed_out at the partnership as giving British Airways unfair access to the United States even as U.S. carriers continue to face severe restrictions in Britain and at London ' s Heathrow Airport -- the crossroads of international aviation . Earlier this month , the lack of progress in U.S.-British aviation talks almost led the U.S. Department_of_Transportation to revoke its approval of the USAir-British Air code-share plan . Instead , the department granted the two carriers a one-year extension on the agreement . Various airline partners have suffered financial problems as well : * British Airways , which bought a 24 % stake in USAir for $ 400 million last year , has frozen plans for further investment until its financially troubled partner can restore profits . The two airlines carried only about 6 # 500 passengers on their code-share service during the last seven months of last year . * KLM wrote_off its $ 400-million investment in Northwest last year as the U.S. carrier narrowly avoided bankruptcy . * Continental Airlines and Scandinavian Airline Systems continue to code share even though SAS lost a large investment in Continental when the Houston-based carrier reorganized under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . &quot; It doesn ' t hurt anything , &quot; aviation consultant Michael Boyd said of global partnerships . &quot; But in terms of contributing a lot to the bottom_line , there is not much there to contribute. &quot; Any substantial payoffs from the airline alliances will not start flowing for several years , say industry_analysts . By then alliances will be in a good position to take_advantage of movement in Canada , Europe and Japan to deregulate air_travel . In fact , the deregulation of worldwide aviation might lead to the break_down of some airline alliances and code-sharing , because carriers would be free to fly wherever they chose . Until then , aviation observers say that partnerships and code-sharing will play a growing role , despite their drawbacks . &quot; Right now their only choice -- and it might not be a real choice -- is to code share , &quot; Kasper said . Global Linkage More and more American and foreign airlines are sharing passengers , revenues and flights through &quot; code share &quot; agreements . These deals allow carriers to expand their service without adding planes by sharing airline flight numbers and codes in computer reservation systems . For example , Northwest Flight 196 from San Diego to Minneapolis also appears as KLM flight 196 in reservation computers . So a European passenger traveling within the United States can enjoy the familiarity -- if not the reality -- of booking a European carrier . United Airlines ( based in Chicago ) Has code-share agreements in place or under development with airlines in Asia , the Caribbean , Europe , and South_America . United , the largest U.S. airline , soon will begin extensive code share with Lufthansa German Airlines , the largest carrier within Europe . United ' s international partners include : * Lufthansa German Airlines ( based in Cologne ) * Thai Airways International ( Bangkok ) * Transbrasil , ( Brasilia ) * British Midland ( Derby , United Kingdom ) * Sunaire Express Airlines ( Caribbean ) * ALM Antillean Airlines ( Caribbean ) American Airlines ( Dallas ) International partnerships are fewer and smaller in scope than its U.S competitors ' . The carrier is looking_for other foreign partners , particularly in Asia . American ' s international partners : * British Midland ( Derby , United Kingdom ) * Gulf Air Co . ( Bahrain ) * Quantas Airways , Sydney ( Australia ) * South_African Airways ( Johanesburg , South_Africa ) Delta Air Lines ( Atlanta ) Has numerous code-share agreements , but most involve service to only a_few cities . Delta , Swissair and Singapore Airlines own 5 % of each other ' s stock . Delta ' s international partners include : * Singapore Airlines ( Singapore ) * Swissair ( Zurich ) * Sabena Belgian World Airlines ( Brussels ) * Malev Hungarian Airlines ( Budapest ) * Varig Brazilian Airlines ( Rio de Janeiro ) * Vietnam Airlines ( Hanoi ) * Aeroflot ( Moscow ) Northwest Airlines ( Minneapolis ) Northwest and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines have one of the world ' s most extensive airline alliances . KLM owns 49 % of Northwest ; their code sharing involves nearly 40 cities in the United States and more_than 30 in Europe . Northwest ' s international partner : * KLM Royal Dutch Airlines ( Amsterdam ) Continental Airlines ( Houston ) Has a longstanding code-share relationship with Scandinavian Airline Systems ( SAS ) ; the airlines share terminal operations at Newark International Airport . Air Canada owns 20.5 % of Continental , but those don ' t yet code share . Has linked its frequent flyer program with Air France under a marketing agreement . Continental ' s international partners include : * SAS ( Stockholm ) * Air Canada ( Montreal ) * Air France ( Paris ) USAir ( Arlington , Va ) U.S._government recently renewed the code share relationship between USAir and British Airways , which has the world ' s largest network of international_flights . British Airways owns 24 % of USAir . USAir ' s international partners include : * British Airways ( London ) * Alitalia Airlines ( Rome ) * All Nippon Airways ( Tokyo ) Carried Away The world ' s airlines expect steady , dramatic growth in international passenger traffic . Number of International Passengers ( in millions ) 1997 : 413.9 * * Estimate Source : International Air Transport Assn</TEXT>
