   <HEADLINE> LATIN_AMERICA ; PERU ' S CANTUTA CASE DEFINES NATION ' S JUDICIAL FRONT_LINE ; MEMBERS OF THE ARMY HAVE BEEN ACCUSED IN THE DEATHS OF 10 . THE HIGH_COURT MUST CHOOSE EITHER CIVILIAN OR MILITARY HEARINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A civilian prosecutor ' s charges against eight soldiers accused in the disappearance and deaths of nine students and a university lecturer are testing this nation ' s Supreme Court , which must rule whether the military_men will face civil or military hearings . The controversial case -- known as La Cantuta after the name of the teachers training university just east of Lima -- has come_to symbolize the willingness of President Alberto Fujimori ' s administration to prosecute army_officers accused of human_rights violations . Such crimes by the military have gone largely unpunished in the past . Clumsy attempts over the last year to cover_up military involvement have only pushed the Cantuta case further into the limelight and undermined the president ' s promises to clean_up Peru ' s tarnished human_rights record . Until recently , Peru was mired in a deadly war against the Maoist Sendero Luminoso ( Shining Path ) insurgency . More_than 27 # 000 Peruvians have died on both sides since 1980 , and the counterinsurgency resulted in one of the world ' s worst records of human_rights abuses . But since Fujimori came_to office in 1990 , disappearances have dropped from a high of 440 in 1989 to 80 or so last year . He has called the Cantuta case an &quot; isolated occurrence. &quot; Victor Cubas , a civilian prosecutor , filed charges in mid-December against four officers and four enlisted men linked to the disappearances , including Gen . Juan Rivera , who heads the army ' s intelligence service . A military_court , which is conducting a separate investigation , then asked the Supreme Court to rule whether army or civilian hearings should be conducted . &quot; For me , it is a given that it will end_up in the military_court , &quot; said Jose Ugaz , a human_rights lawyer . He noted that in 1985 , a navy officer implicated in the massacre of civilians in an Andean village staged his own kidnaping after the Supreme Court ruled that he appear before civilian judges . The naval_officer , who is believed to have fled to the United States , has not been seen since . The Cantuta case places Fujimori in a vulnerable position vis-a-vis the armed forces , which backed his &quot; self-coup &quot; in April , 1992 , when he shut_down the Congress and judiciary and suspended the constitution . Bowing to international pressure , Fujimori called elections for a new Congress , which drafted Peru ' s new charter , approved by referendum last October . Critics of Fujimori ' s administration say the judges , many appointed after the 1992 coup , have yet to show their independence , and the Cantuta case offers a real test of their neutrality . Unlike in the United States , justices in Peru are not confirmed by the Congress . Meanwhile , analysts say military support for the coup gave the armed forces , who saw themselves as the country ' s saviors , carte_blanche to combat the Sendero Luminoso . Fujimori has often said that one reason behind his coup was to pacify Peru . He justifies the move by highlighting the successes he has scored in the war against the insurgents . * But , Ugaz said , Fujimori ' s promises to prosecute officers accused of wrongdoing have lost him military support . As Ugaz put it , Fujimori &quot; leaned_on the bayonets so heavily that now they ' re pricking him. &quot; The students and lecturer disappeared in July , 1992 , two days after a Sendero Luminoso car_bomb exploded in Lima ' s Miraflores district ; it was part of a Lima spree that killed more_than 20 people and injured scores of others . Some of those who vanished from La Cantuta , a former Sendero Luminoso stronghold , have been linked to the insurgency . The university was under army control at the time . Violence has abated since the September , 1992 , capture of Sendero Luminoso founder Abimael Guzman , who is serving a life sentence at a navy prison near Lima .</TEXT>
