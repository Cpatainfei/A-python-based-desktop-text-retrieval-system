   <TEXT> Defying conventional wisdom , parting_with their fellow critics ' groups and perhaps changing the complexion of the Oscar race , the New York Film Critics Circle Thursday selected &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; Robert Redford ' s character-based examination of the ' 50s television scandals , as the best picture of 1994 . &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; which many had expected to win the top prize , took two awards : best director and best screenplay , both for Quentin Tarantino . The Critics Circle , voting for the 60th time since its inception in 1935 , chose Paul Newman as best actor for his performance in Robert Benton ' s &quot; Nobody ' s Fool. &quot; It was a close vote between Newman and Samuel L . Jackson , picked for his highly regarded work in &quot; Pulp Fiction. &quot; Linda Fiorentino , the femme_fatale with the heart of ice in John Dahl ' s &quot; The Last Seduction , &quot; was chosen best actress , over some healthy support for Jennifer Jason-Leigh ( &quot; Hudsucker Proxy &quot; and &quot; Mrs . Parker and the Vicious_Circle &quot; ) and newcomer Crissy Rock of Ken Loach ' s &quot; Ladybird , Ladybird. &quot; Martin Landau was chosen best supporting actor for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi in &quot; Ed Wood &quot; on the first vote . Dianne Weist , the centerpiece of Woody Allen ' s &quot; Bullets Over Broadway , &quot; was selected best supporting actress . Krzysztof Kieslowski ' s &quot; Red , &quot; a strong contender for best picture honors , won instead for best foreign film . Likewise , &quot; Hoop Dreams , &quot; which took best documentary . When the awards are handed_out at the Circle ' s annual dinner Jan . 22 , a special award will be bestowed on French director Jean-Luc Godard for his &quot; influence on world cinema. &quot; At the other end of the career spectrum , newcomer Darnell Martin will be feted as best first-time filmmaker -- an award given only on a year-by-year basis -- for her exuberant &quot; I Like It Like That. &quot; Although the New York and Los Angeles critics differed on the best picture and best actor awards -- John Travolta ( &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; ) and Jessica Lange ( &quot; Blue_Skies ) , who won the L.A. awards Saturday , got virtually no support in New York -- they agreed more_than they didn ' t : Landau , Weist , &quot; Red , &quot; &quot; Hoop Dreams &quot; and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky ( &quot; Ed Wood &quot; ) have all been honored by both groups , as was Tarantino for best director .</TEXT>
