   <HEADLINE> BRITAIN , IRELAND PRESS IRA TO END VIOLENCE IN ULSTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Ministers John Major of Britain and Albert Reynolds of Ireland on Thursday intensified their pressure on the_Irish Republican Army to give_up its campaign of violence in Northern_Ireland . Speaking on the steps of No . 10 Downing Street after a meeting Thursday night , they warned Sinn Fein , the IRA ' s political arm , that they will not &quot; wait around &quot; for the party to respond to their peace overtures . The two leaders , who last December signed the Downing Street Declaration offering Sinn Fein a place at Northern_Ireland peace talks if the IRA would stop its attacks , said they would continue negotiations with politicians in Northern_Ireland and the_Irish Republic . &quot; A great_deal of progress has been made , &quot; Major said . &quot; There ' s more to be done , but it is not awaiting an answer from Sinn Fein. &quot; Earlier , Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams raised peace hopes by declaring to the_British Broadcasting Corp . that his group would make an official response to the Downing Street peace proposal -- but not until after European Parliament elections June 9 . &quot; I am quite convinced that what is going_to come_out of this peace process is a peace settlement , &quot; Adams said . But Major dashed cold water on the statement . &quot; I see nothing new in what he had to say this morning , &quot; the prime_minister said . &quot; What was quite striking was what he didn ' t say . He made no indication that he was going_to give_up violence. &quot;</TEXT>
