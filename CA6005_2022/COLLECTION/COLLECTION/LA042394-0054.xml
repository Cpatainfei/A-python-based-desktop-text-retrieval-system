   <HEADLINE> SCIENCE WATCH ; ARE YOU THERE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A long_time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . The odds are that somewhere in a universe containing stars beyond counting -- think here in terms of hundreds of billions -- there are planets besides our own and our solar_system ' s other eight.Also , the odds are that , given the advance of science and human ingenuity , someone would start to find them . For the first time , astronomers think they have done so . A team led by Alexander Wolszczan of Pennsylvania State University says it has &quot; irrefutable evidence &quot; that at least two planets and maybe a third are orbiting a star in the constellation Virgo , 1 # 200 light-years ( 7 # 000 trillion miles ) away . The objects are too distant and too small to be seen by optical_telescopes . Their existence is inferred from the radio_signals emanating from the pulsar , the rapidly spinning residue of a dead star , around which they orbit . Could there be life on these objects ? Almost certainly not , given the inhospitable neighborhood . But now that the Wolszczan team says it has proven our solar_system isn ' t unique there ' s even more reason to assume that on planets elsewhere , yet to be detected , life does exist . That life could conceivably make our own state of evolution seem primitive . It ' s something to ponder , the possibility that some place in this vast and still expanding universe -- maybe even in many places -- civilizations exist that can boast their own or even better Shakespeares , Mozarts , Einsteins , Roseanne Arnolds . It would be nice to get_in_touch sometime . Hello , out there .</TEXT>
