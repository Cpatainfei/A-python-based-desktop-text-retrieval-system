   <HEADLINE> TIME RUNNING_OUT AS JAPAN TRADE TALKS DEADLINE LOOMS ; COMMERCE : TEN DAYS REMAIN BEFORE U.S.- THREATENED SANCTIONS . NO NEW TALKS HAVE BEEN SET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the deadline for threatened U.S. sanctions looming , Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown said Wednesday that he still hopes for trade progress with Japan . Just when is the question . Tokyo has only 10 days left to open its public procurement market or risk U.S. sanctions proceedings -- a threat that has helped keep world financial markets on edge and raised political hackles in Tokyo . &quot; We reserve the right to call_off talks under the economic framework pact &quot; if sanctions are imposed , one government official said Wednesday in Tokyo . But few here detect signs of an imminent breakthrough , raising the specter of renewed trans-Pacific friction at a time of extreme fragility in world currency markets . One Japanese official said Tokyo may pull_out of the talks should Washington pounce , but that &quot; would require a major political decision . We would have to consider the overall situation , including currency markets . It ' s not that easy. &quot; Asked if there is any hope of averting sanctions , Brown responded , &quot; It ' s a very difficult situation to read. &quot; He said repeated political turmoil in Tokyo has hampered the trade talks , but he added , &quot; We remain hopeful that we can make some progress. &quot; The first hurdle is July 31 , the U.S. deadline for progress in opening_up Japan ' s public telecommunications and medical technology markets . Thus far , insufficient progress has been made despite months of intense negotiations and an extra month ' s leeway for Tokyo to help it ride_out its political disruption . With time now tight , a senior Administration official said the United States is open_to talk more but conceded that nothing has been scheduled . &quot; The Japanese government has shown a willingness and interest in continuing discussions , and we welcome that , &quot; he told a group of reporters , speaking on condition of anonymity . He added that there has been no date set for new negotiations . The aide refused to discuss the likelihood of U.S. action in the_matter , but senior officials have said there is no deal yet and are downplaying prospects for progress this month . &quot; Obviously we understand the so-called deadline is July 31 . We ' re fully prepared to make a decision prior to that time . We have already had discussions in the Administration , &quot; the senior official said . Indeed there have been changes in attitude this past year , according to one well-placed source , who said the hawks have won the battle for now as &quot; utter frustration &quot; has set_in about lack of progress in cutting Japan ' s $ 131-billion surplus .</TEXT>
