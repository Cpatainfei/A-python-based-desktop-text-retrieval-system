   <HEADLINE> RICHARD EDER : FAITH IN A METAPHOR ; KNOWLEDGE OF ANGELS , BY JILL PATON WALSH ( HOUGHTON MIFFLIN : $ 21.95 ; 268 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Except that he comes from an imaginary realm , Palinor ' s waterlogged arrival on the imaginary Mediterranean island of Grandinsula could be one of the Englishman Gulliver ' s travels_to a contrary reality . Palinor is a prince in a land ruled by the dawning Enlightenment -- a tolerant , civic , scientific society that works to the principles of empirical reason . Grandinsula is a medieval Catholic state ruled by a conscientious and benevolent cardinal-prince and working to the principles of Scholastic theology . &quot; Knowledge of Angels &quot; is several different kinds of novel that come_together astonishingly well . It is a philosophical argument in a line that stretches from Swift to C . S . Lewis ' &quot; The Screwtape Letters. &quot; Its disputation about the respective claims of scientific and religious thought , conducted three ways among Palinor , Cardinal Severo and Beneditx , a sweetly unworldly Thomist theologian , is agile and diverting . The argument takes_place not in a vacuum , but among three cultivated figures who come_to respect and love one another , and thereby confront a tragedy . On the outcome hinges the question of whether Severo will be obliged to hand_over Palinor to the Inquisition for burning as a heretic . It is a Plato ' s Symposium in which real food -- savory and fragrant -- is served , and where there will be a real bill to pay . But Jill Paton Walsh , an English writer known mainly for children ' s books , has placed her discourse and drama in a special framework . It is as if she had set the text down on parchment and illuminated it . As a medieval courtly or biblical manuscript displayed trees , rabbits , hilltop villages , swooping angels , knightly processions and peasants reaping or making_love , &quot; Knowledge of Angels &quot; -- by means of writing alone -- is a series of brilliant illuminations . They do not outshine the text so_much as place it in a more spacious human context . As we argue and expound and narrate , the seasons pass , harvests come and go , and two pairs of legs protrude entwined from under a hawthorn bush . Walsh makes several different uses of angels -- in this intricately but elegantly constructed book each character and emblem reappears in shifting guises -- but she starts off with an aerial view of Grandinsula . It is an angel ' s view , and also a reader ' s . The two have in common their ability to see everything in an eternal present , and simultaneously . Hamlet moves through time and dies , but to the reader he is always moving and always dying . The island , somewhat resembling a 15th-Century Majorca , has mountains , plains , villages on each hilltop , a church in each village , little ports and a capital city . Everything is compressed and foreshortened -- again , as in an illumination -- so that an inch or two is a long journey . When Beneditx is summoned from his monastery to the nearby capital , the monks come_out to say_farewell as though he were off to China . The book ' s different stories move and turn simultaneously , united by the reader ' s angelic vantage_point . On the mountain , shepherds and ice harvesters -- they stamp_down the snow , pack it in straw and sell it in the city -- capture a feral girl who has been raised by wolves . In the capital , Severo , austere and industrious , disposes of mountains of paperwork . By the seashore , fishermen rescue Palinor who has fallen from his ship passing at night , miles offshore . Up in the Galilea monastery , Beneditx , whose learning attracts scholars from all_over Europe , is working_on his book about the knowledge of angels . He holds to the old Scholastic view that , by the unnumbered billions , they make everything happen . In relay , they speed a javelin ' s flight and give it a delicate curve ; each snowflake has an angel disposing its fall . The stories converge . A shepherd comes_to Severo to ask permission for the wolf-girl , who will only eat raw_meat and is starving , to be baptized . A local prefect throws Palinor into a dungeon when , offered the choice of declaring himself Christian , pagan , Saracen or agnostic , he insists that he is an atheist . Lordly in manner and assured in intellect -- his princely rank at_home comes not from lineage but from his skill as an engineer -- he insists on being heard by the cardinal-prince . Severo is charmed and fascinated , and searches for a way to spare him . Summoning Beneditx , his old friend , the two devise a double plan . Palinor comes from a country where atheism is as acceptable as faith . If he has never believed_in God , therefore , he can be tolerated just as agnostics and Jews are tolerated because of &quot; invincible ignorance. &quot; Beneditx objects that knowledge of God may be innate though there is no firm doctrine on the_matter . The wolf-child will be used to find_out . Severo orders her to be taken_to a convent , taught to speak and then questioned as_to whether she has ever thought of God . The nuns are cautioned never to mention God to her . It is a scientific control -- one of the book ' s many inquisitive ironies , since it is Palinor ' s scientific culture that Beneditx objects to and that Severo finds troublesome though alluring . The more wholehearted and clear-minded abbess , like some present-day ethicist objecting to gene transplants , finds the experiment unkind . Meanwhile , Beneditx and Palinor retreat to a pleasant hillside palace where the former goes_through his array of learned arguments to persuade the latter that God has got_to exist . Before long , curious and tired_of the niggling detail of governance , Severo joins them . The three have a splendid time , eating , drinking , talking and bathing in the fountain that Palinor builds_in his spare_time . It is a wonderfully companionable sequence but soon Beneditx begins to droop . His beautifully elaborated 13th-Century arguments -- Walsh suggests their ornamented aesthetic appeal -- are of no use against Palinor ' s 17th-Century reasoning . ( The book is conveniently set halfway between , in an imaginary 15th Century , with Severo as a transitional figure. ) The cardinal-prince reflects that he has pitted a golden mind against tempered steel ; before long , Beneditx is in despair . Severo urges him to hold_on through faith -- for this man_of_action , a failure to prove God ' s existence is no more troubling than a failure to prove that the sun will rise tomorrow -- but Beneditx ' s faith is built_on argument and it has crumbled . Beneditx ' s crisis will be followed by Palinor ' s . With the arrival of a deathly agent of the Inquisition and the collapse of the wolf-girl experiment , Severo finds himself torn between delivering up Palinor and desperately maneuvering to save him . The book advances to a brilliant and relentless conclusion . It would be relentless , that is , if it did not consist_of its illuminations as well as its argument . The island and its people are vividly and beautifully portrayed . The wolf-girl , who remains mysterious to the end , and the nuns who care_for her are drawn with fine nuance and an imperceptibly gathering power . The stranger , cardinal and theologian are three eras of history -- the early Enlightenment , the Renaissance and the Middle_Ages -- meeting to test their ideas , their hearts , the different sense of sky , skyline and the world ' s panorama that greets their eyes each morning , and the even more different sense of what it means to act_as a human_being . All on an island that Walsh ' s illuminated and illuminating book has set_down in the weight of reality and the lightness of possibility .</TEXT>
