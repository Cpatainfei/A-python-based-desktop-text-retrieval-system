   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL ; THE PESO -- PROFIT AND PAIN ; CONSUMER IMPACT : U.S. IS THE WINNER , MEXICO THE LOSER -- AT LEAST FOR NOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Winners and losers in Mexico ' s fiscal crisis strolled through the light rain in this border city Thursday , trying to balance their personal ledgers and reassess their Christmas plans . Tijuana car salesman Fabrizio Maldonado , for example , said the devaluation of the Mexican_peso means he might have to forgo that $ 900 Christmas necklace he was planning to buy_in San Diego for his girlfriend . And his used-car business is hurting : Fewer Tijuanans will be able to afford the cars he buys for dollars in the United States and transports back for_sale in Tijuana . On the other hand , Bonnie Rodriguez of Marina del Rey planned to make a special stop in Tijuana to load_up on leather goods and blankets . And Laura Cruz , an immigrant living in Santa Monica who sent $ 300 to her mother in Mexico to buy Christmas_presents , was , in_effect , sending her significantly more_than that . &quot; At least this money can help a little more , &quot; she said . Then there is Dick Harris of San Diego , who makes twice-weekly forays to wager at Tijuana ' s off-track betting parlors . He said the devaluation didn ' t rattle him : &quot; I ' ll keep coming . I place my bets in dollars. &quot; One way or the other , the peso devaluation ordered by the new government of President Ernesto Zedillo is already having a striking and direct impact on the millions of Americans and Mexicans whose lives and jobs are tied to the border , though the effects are as varied as the many facets of the border economy . Those profiting are U.S. consumers buying goods in Mexico with dollars that have gained about a third in purchasing power over the last three days . Conversely , Mexican shoppers who are in the habit of buying goods and services in the United States have lost that much and more . Some money exchange houses in San Ysidro were demanding 5.1 pesos per dollar Thursday -- up about 45 % from a week earlier . More unsettling for many Mexicans now living_in the United States was the message of turmoil and instability in their homeland . At One Stop Immigration in Los Angeles , a community-based organization that provides legal and education services for immigrants , the office has been flooded with worried immigrants over the last few days who are concerned about losing real_estate , bank_accounts and other possessions in Mexico . &quot; What ( people ) are concerned about is that they know this political instability is bad , &quot; Executive_Director Jose Gutierrez said . &quot; . . . They ' re worried that all_the promises of the Mexican government will go_up in smoke. &quot; The devaluation was partly aimed at persuading Mexican consumers to buy more goods in Mexico instead of the United States , to ease the growing trade surplus the United States has enjoyed with Mexico since passage of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . By making U.S. goods and supplies more expensive for Mexican consumers and factories , the devaluation should eventually stimulate the Mexican economy , said John Williamson , fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington . &quot; This makes Mexican goods more competitive , and that ' s one of the purposes , &quot; Williamson said . But paying the price are U.S. retailers and service providers accustomed to selling to Mexicans . &quot; Our local economy is based on Mexico , and suddenly it will take more pesos to come and buy our goods and services , &quot; said Eliud Garcia , executive_vice_president of International Bank of Commerce in Laredo , Tex . &quot; So there is going_to be a decline in sales here if the devaluation holds_up at this level. &quot; Roger Stolley , general_manager of the 116-store La Plaza shopping_mall in McAllen , Tex. , where 35 % of customers are Mexican , said he expects any negative impact to be short-lived . The loss in spending power that Mexicans suffered in past devaluations was soon regained in wage increases , Stolley said . &quot; Historically , devaluations may have hurt us for a_couple_of weeks , but then they get more pesos and they come_back and buy . The fact is , we still have products that might sell for 30 % , 40 % or 50 % less than over there , &quot; Stolley said . But until those kinds of market adjustments are made , Mexican shoppers can look_forward to confusion and leaner times -- despite a government-ordered freeze on wages and prices for 60 days . Veronica Estrada , spokeswoman for the Tijuana Tourism and Convention Bureau , said stores in the city ' s bustling Avenida Revolucion shopping district were already raising prices Thursday to reflect the more powerful dollar -- a double blow to Tijuanans shopping for Christmas_presents . &quot; Everything is out of control . This is very sad for Tijuanans who have been saving money all year to buy presents . Only people who have a lot of money are not affected by this , &quot; Estrada said . But many Tijuanans crossing into San Diego on Thursday said the devaluation would n ' t stop them from shopping in the United States , where they say the prices and quality of many items are still superior to those in Mexico . The devaluation is expected to make many Mexican food staples whose prices are controlled by the government dramatically cheaper for dollar shoppers . In fact , past devaluations have led to hoarding of some Mexican supermarket items by U.S. shoppers . But Lloyd Butler , a disabled veteran who is one of thousands of expatriate Americans living_in the Tijuana area , doesn ' t expect those costs to stay down for long . ' They ' ll jack the prices up in a week or two , just like they did the last time they had one of these. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) The Peso ' s Plunge The Mexican_peso lost more_than 20 % of its value Thursday , the largest drop against the dollar in a decade .
