   <HEADLINE> SCOUT LEADER KILLED IN DOING_GOOD DEED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Boy_Scout leader died while doing a good deed when a piece of sheet_metal blowing in the wind knocked him off a roof . Richard Nevius , 54 , was helping secure loose metal sheeting on a nearby building Monday so it would n ' t fly off and hurt someone . A gust picked_up a large sheet , knocking him off the roof . Building owner Don Hinds said he and two other men narrowly escaped the same fate . &quot; If the rest of us had been close to the end , it would have dumped all_of us off , &quot; Hinds said . Nevius fell about 15 feet , striking his head . He underwent surgery to remove a blood_clot from his brain but never regained consciousness and died Wednesday . Nevius was assistant scout master of Troop 104 in Fremont .</TEXT>
