   <HEADLINE> MAKING BABIES ; THE BOOM IN THE INFERTILITY BUSINESS IS RAISING HOPES , AND INCREASING CRITICISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In his spotless embryology lab at the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Century City Hospital , David Hill is peering into the viewer of a formidable-looking microscope , trying to make a baby . On a monitor next to the scope is the vastly magnified image of a woman ' s egg -- smaller , in reality , than a tiny speck of dust -- and of the microscopic suction rod holding it in place . Right now , Hill ' s attention is_on the semen sample next to the egg . With his right_hand , he ' s manipulating controls that send a needle far finer than a hair chasing_after what looks_to be a batch of teeny , wriggling long-tailed polliwogs . &quot; The best sperm tend to go_off to the edge and go_around and around the drop like little race_cars , &quot; Hill says as he hunts_down a pack of them . &quot; It ' s very fortuitous for embryologists. &quot; When he ' s zeroed_in on the sperm he wants , Hill draws them up into the needle by sucking on a rubber mouthpiece that ' s connected to a slender hose and clenched between his teeth -- an oddly low-tech note in this whole sophisticated operation . After he ' s drawn some 50 sperm into the needle , he moves it over to the egg and presses_down against its translucent outer shell ( the zona pellucida ) . Under the pressure of the needle , the egg squashes in on itself alarmingly , like a beach_ball poked with a stick . But as soon as Hill punctures the zona pellucida , deposits a fraction of the sperm and retracts the needle , the egg springs back into shape . Beneath its cloudy shell , the sperm buzz madly about like trapped insects . The procedure he ' s just completed is a subzonal insertion , usually known by its friendly acronym , SUZI . Eggs and sperm that Hill manipulate in this way can ' t , for one reason or another , achieve fertilization on_their_own . So he ' s helping them bypass the arduous trek to conception . The sperm-injected eggs ( usually a total of seven or eight for each couple ) go_into an incubator and are maintained at body_temperature for 14 to 18 hours . Depending_on the number that make the leap to embryo status , about four of the best quality will be loaded into a catheter and inserted into the woman ' s womb . &quot; I can ' t wait to come_into the lab , open_up the incubator and see whether any of our efforts have resulted in decent embryos , &quot; says Hill . &quot; It ' s just like opening a little Christmas_present . I never get tired_of it. &quot; In Hill ' s sterilized lab , surrounded by the tools of his trade , it ' s easy to lose sight of what ' s actually happening . For couples who come_to Century City , as_to a fast-growing number of similar clinics around the country , these procedures represent a last chance to achieve a desire as old as human history : that of giving_birth to a child . On behalf of these couples , Hill is waging a daily battle of technology against nature . And despite a swelling arsenal of controversial new techniques and procedures , nature usually wins . THREE YEARS AGO , JOHN TAYLOR ( this name and those of the other patients have been changed ) got the call from his doctor , just before a weekend business trip to New Orleans . After months of trying unsuccessfully to conceive , John and his wife , Leslie , had sought medical help . Now they were awaiting results of his sperm test . The voice at the other end of the line had bad news . &quot; The doctor told me I had absolutely no sperm , &quot; recalls Taylor , 36 , a television lighting designer . &quot; The two of us stood_in the kitchen and bawled our eyes out . I was destroyed . I felt emasculated . I come from a large family , and the fact that I ' d never be able to have my own children -- never , there wasn ' t a hope in hell -- was devastating. &quot; At the end of his weekend trip , in a bizarre twist of events , Taylor returned to hear that there had been a mix-up at the lab , and he did have a sperm_count . But it was low , the doctor warned him ; pregnancy would still be problematic . &quot; If the guy had been standing there , I ' d have decked him for putting me through all that , &quot; he says . &quot; But I was also pleased . At least he ' d given us back some hope. &quot; Today , $ 20 # 000 poorer and their insurance coverage for infertility exhausted , the Taylors wonder whether there was much point in those hopes being raised . Both partners have undergone surgery to correct reproductive-tract problems ; each has tried fertility_drugs . They ' ve tried timed insemination , with John ' s sperm inserted directly into Leslie ' s uterus when ultrasound scanning showed she was ovulating . Twice they ' ve attempted , and failed at , &quot; test_tube &quot; conception at Century City . To cut costs on the pricey medication a woman takes during such attempts , they ' ve journeyed to Tijuana to purchase their drugs at cut-rate prices . Running the gantlet of these treatments has &quot; put an incredible strain on our marriage , &quot; says Taylor . &quot; Frankly , I ' m surprised we ' re still together . In many aspects , our lives have been_on hold with this thing for three years. &quot; In a_few months , the Taylors will return to Century City to try a new procedure developed in Belgium that Hill has recently begun working_on . The ultimate refinement of existing sperm-injection methods , it involves shooting a single sperm directly into the heart of an egg and seems to produce higher fertilization rates than multiple-sperm procedures such_as SUZI ; the Belgian clinic that first used it is now claiming pregnancy rates of more_than 30 % . This could be the Taylors ' winning ticket in the baby lottery . But Leslie , 38 , a small , jeans-clad TV director who sits curled on the sofa in their North Hollywood home , is tiring of the demands of the pregnancy chase . &quot; I only want to try direct injection once , &quot; says Leslie . &quot; John wants to try it twice . I ' m emotionally and physically beyond it . I ' ve been_on hormone injections for three solid months ; I feel fat and bloated and like I could cry at the drop of a hat . Why is it that we cannot conceive a child ? Why ? &quot; &quot; It can make you feel guilty , &quot; says John . &quot; You look_back over your life , you say : ' I ' ve always tried to be a decent person . Did I do something wrong ? Is God trying to punish me ? Was it my lifestyle ? ' &quot; He ' s not willing to give_up , however , and his determination is carrying both of them . &quot; All through this , we ' ve had a willingness to fight , not to take the first defeat and say , ' OK , it ' s over , ' &quot; he says . &quot; When you start something like this , you ' ve got_to finish . Otherwise you spend the rest of your life wondering ' What if ? ' I ' m still not convinced we ' re finished. &quot; To Leslie , he adds , &quot; I won ' t ask_for more_than two tries . But you go_in every time thinking , this is the time it ' s going_to work. &quot; More often than not , however , you ' ll be wrong . INSIDE THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES AT THE CENTURY CITY REPRODUCIVE clinic , which occupies part of a floor in this small private hospital , are homey touches : stuffed animals nesting on file_cabinets , a sign that reads &quot; Never give_up ! &quot; On the outer walls hang photos of children conceived as a result of treatment here and letters from their grateful parents . There is praise for the &quot; incredible staff &quot; at Century City , and the word miracle shows_up often . Each year , more_than 300 couples come here seeking children . For many , it ' s a court of last appeal , after months or years of lower-tech efforts such_as drugs or surgery have failed . In general , those who choose high-tech conception follow a similar regimen . A woman begins with daily injections of powerful hormone-regulating drugs to stimulate her ovaries to mature more eggs than the single one that normally matures each month . If the therapy succeeds , the crop of eggs -- about 10 on average but in some cases more_than 30 -- is &quot; harvested. &quot; While a patient is under local or general_anesthesia , a doctor inserts a needle either vaginally or through an incision in the stomach to suck the eggs from her ovaries . In regular in-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , eggs are then combined in a petri_dish with the sperm sample , fresh or frozen , that a man has dutifully provided . In gamete intra-Fallopian transfer ( GIFT ) , developed as a slightly more &quot; natural &quot; alternative to IVF -- eggs and sperm don ' t unite in glassware , but are inserted together into the Fallopian tubes . The resulting embryos are transferred into the uterus , the Fallopian tubes or , sometimes , both . At many IVF centers , extra embryos now can be frozen , meaning a woman doesn ' t have to go_through the stressful process of an egg retrieval at each attempt . Louise Brown , the first baby conceived through IVF , was born in Britain in 1978 . Three years later , the first American high-tech baby was born at a Norfolk , Va. , clinic . Since then , the infertility business in the United States has mushroomed into a $ 2-billion-a-year enterprise , much of its expansion spurred by the development of assisted reproductive technologies , including IVF and the many different methods it has spawned for manipulating eggs and sperm outside the body . It is , at best , an imperfect science -- expensive , unregulated and relatively untested , especially in the area of long-term effects . But the market for reproductive technologies is sizable . According to the National Center for Health Statistics , about 2.3 million married American couples are infertile ( meaning they haven ' t been able to conceive after a year or more of trying ) . For up_to 15 % of them , according to the American Fertility Society , high-tech approaches are considered the only hope . With the U.S._government disinclined to allocate research dollars to a politically touchy area such_as reproductive technology , this country has lagged behind Australia and parts of Europe -- but not too far . There are now about 350 U.S. infertility clinics , including at least two multi-state chains ; at least 45 reproductive clinics that perform IVF and other assisted technologies are crowded into California alone . More_than 33 # 000 assisted-reproductive-technology procedures were initiated in 1991 , the last year for which figures are available , up 30 % from 1990 . Originally used only to treat blocked tubes , assisted reproductive technologies are now applied to a range of female infertility problems , including endometriosis , ovulatory disorders and the catch-all condition of &quot; unexplained infertility. &quot; More recently , researchers have zeroed_in on male infertility . Women had long been accorded the lion ' s share of the blame when a marriage was barren , but when reproductive specialists peered closely into their petri_dishes , they discovered that the man was wholly or partly responsible_for a couple ' s problem 40 % to 60 % of the time . For some men , approaches that range from eschewing hot tubs to undergoing corrective surgery will do the trick . But others have sperm that are so few in number , sluggish , malformed or otherwise defective that doctors could do nothing but point them toward the nearest sperm_bank -- until recently . In the late 1980s , embryologists found it was possible to aid recalcitrant sperm in fertilization by opening the egg ' s outer shell to give the sperm easier access . This type of &quot; micromanipulation , &quot; known as partial zona dissection , was followed by SUZI . Then , in 1992 , came the Belgians ' encouraging announcement of intracytoplasmic sperm injection , or ICSI ( pronounced ICK-see by those in the field ) , the no-nonsense technique in which a single sperm is propelled to the egg ' s center . &quot; It ' s actually somewhat surprising the technique works , &quot; admits Jacques Cohen , scientific director of assisted reproduction at New York City ' s Cornell Medical_Center and a pioneer in the development of micromanipulation . &quot; We used to think there was a certain sequence of processes that was absolutely necessary before the sperm was able to fertilize the egg . Now we know that ' s not true ; those processes can be completely surpassed. &quot; As these dazzling technologies establish themselves as the wave of the future , troubling issues surround their use . Most conspicuous are the ethical dilemmas that seem to grab headlines weekly . There is much outrage at the idea of 60-year-old women becoming mothers and apprehension that scientists might soon start using eggs from aborted fetuses to produce babies -- meaning that a child could have a biological mother who was never born . And last fall , two U.S. scientists &quot; cloned &quot; a human embryo , making an exact genetic copy of the origi-nal and raising the specter of an assembly-line baby-manufacturing industry . But at the moment , these issues don ' t apply in clinical practice -- or apply to only a tiny handful of those who visit programs . ( Realistically , not many 60-year-old women crave new motherhood. ) For most infertile couples , the considerations are more mundane : In 1991 , only 15 % of individual attempts at test-tube conception produced what ' s known in the field as a &quot; take-home baby &quot; -- with figures higher or lower depending_on the procedure and the patient involved . If success rates are low , however , prices are not . A completed attempt ( some women drop_out early because they don ' t respond to initial hormone therapy ) ranges from $ 8 # 000 to $ 13 # 000 or more . Lumped into the category of &quot; luxury &quot; treatments such_as tummy-tucks or orthodontia , assisted reproductive technologies in many cases are not covered , or only minimally covered , by insurance . And there ' s no money-back guarantee . In worst-case scenarios , patients run_up huge tabs in repeated futile efforts to have a baby . &quot; The door never , ever completely closes on an infertile couple , &quot; acknowledges Hill . &quot; There ' s always the latest snazzy technique to rekindle hope . They can end_up at the end of the line childless and financially depleted. &quot; Contemplating this scenario , a small but vocal number of critics , several of them on Capitol_Hill , have raised their voices in a growing chorus of complaint . Too often , they say , the assisted-reproductive-technology field is battening on emotional desperation . &quot; The technology doesn ' t work , &quot; says Ann Pappert , who ' s working_on a book to be titled &quot; Cruel Promises : Inside the Reproductive Industry , &quot; and one of a group of experts who attended a 1990 World_Health_Organization policy conference on IVF . &quot; A lot of couples go_into it thinking : ' All right , I know the reality but I ' m going_to be the exception. ' I ' ve heard that over and over and over again . The whole technology is presented in a manner that encourages them to think that way . A lot of clinics , the way they talk to the patients sort of pumps them up_to keep going_back . It ' s a business , and like any business , you have to keep your clients coming . &quot; How many people would go_to an IVF clinic if they read that 85 % of couples go_home without a baby ? &quot; she asks . &quot; It ' s not that I think clinics should only emphasize the negative , but there isn ' t a balanced picture presented . If you go_to your OB-GYN , does he have a wall of baby pictures ? It ' s a form of emotional manipulation. &quot; Advocates of reproductive technology see things differently . Diane Aronson , executive_director of the Somerville , Mass.-based national infertility consumer group RESOLVE , came_to the organization years ago with her own problems . &quot; These couples may be in a vulnerable position , but that doesn ' t mean they ' re not thinking , rational folks , &quot; she says . &quot; Plenty of people decide , ' IVF is not for me. ' that ' s their option . But everyone should have the right to become informed about IVF , to assess the risk and evaluate it for themselves. &quot; The question , though , is whether couples have a chance to make a truly informed decision . Does the data exist to help them weigh whether the short- and long-term risks are worth the potential benefit ? Many in the field admit that the answer is no . IN 1989 , THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT ASSEMBLED A ROYAL COMMISSION to come_up with guidelines and funding recommendations for the country ' s use of reproductive technology . The commissioners reviewed hundreds of studies from international research on the use of reproductive technologies for infertility problems . Last year , the they concluded that only one procedure -- standard IVF for treatment of blocked tubes -- had been proven in studies to give women a better chance of birth -- about 10 % per attempt -- than no treatment at all . It recommended that no other form of the procedure get health-care coverage . The commission didn ' t say whether IVF works for other types of infertility , or that procedures such_as GIFT or micromanipulation are not effective . But , says Dr. Patricia Baird of the University of British_Columbia in Vancouver , the pediatrician and geneticist who headed the inquiry , &quot; we were really rather disturbed by the quality of the studies out there . Many of them have methodological weaknesses or small sample sizes . There ' s a real hodgepodge of women being treated , so you can ' t judge what the success rate is for different categories of diagnosis . There may be categories for which it ' s really not doing any good , and we need to sort that out , because IVF is invasive and expensive , and there are risks involved. &quot; She adds : &quot; It seems to us that everything except IVF for blocked tubes should be offered in the context of research trials , in which women are told these aren ' t proven treatments . They shouldn ' t have to pay , and they should have full information and informed consent. &quot; The World_Health_Organization also has criticized the profit-driven proliferation of reproductive technology in countries around the globe and called_for more clinical trials . Ask Dr. Maria Bustillo , current president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology , if the United States should begin offering these in the context of clinical trials , and she laughs . &quot; I ' d love it , &quot; says Bustillo , who is the director of reproductive endocrinology at Mt . Sinai Medical_Center in New York . &quot; I ' d love to be able to go_back and do some really basic studies . It would be wonderful if people didn ' t have to pay these high costs , when we don ' t yet have the data to give them answers . But we can ' t even get money for doing basic research on endometriosis . Where would we get the dollars to do this ? &quot; A lot of things in medicine related to women ' s health get started and adopted without sufficient study ; the purse_strings have not been controlled by women. &quot; But without the data that clinical trials would provide , reproductive centers are operating in a questionably gray area . For example , programs typically tell couples that their odds of giving_birth stay the same for each IVF attempt , up through the fourth try ( after which birth_rates are known to dip precipitously ) . That may , in fact , not be so . A 1992 study by a Yale_University professor , frustrated at his own and his wife ' s failure with multiple attempts , suggests that the chance of pregnancy drops even before the fourth try . Of 571 women who started treatment at Yale , 13 % got pregnant on the first attempt , 10.7 % succeeded on the second go-round , 6.9 % on the third and 4.3 % on the fourth . Edward H . Kaplan , professor of management sciences and of medicine at Yale , who authored the study , is cautious about applying his results to other clinics , but he believes that &quot; you could end_up spending a whole_lot of money trying to get pregnant , when the chance is really very small. &quot; Roberta Geist , 43 and a real_estate_agent , has spent a whole_lot of money -- more_than $ 30 # 000 -- trying to get pregnant . She ' s tried GIFT once and IVF once . At the moment , she ' s lying_in a Century City recovery_room after her third egg retrieval ; she ' s preparing to try IVF again . Geist ' s chances of pregnancy , she ' s been told , are 10 % to 14 % . &quot; While you have your period , you can still have a child , &quot; she says hopefully . &quot; This should work. &quot; Married at 38 , Geist discovered after a year of trying to conceive that her tubes were blocked , her hormonal levels not optimal . &quot; My husband won ' t let me adopt , &quot; Geist says . But she very much wants a baby . &quot; I have that maternal instinct now , &quot; she says . &quot; I want to be a mother . I ' d love for this to work . If it doesn ' t , I don ' t know , I ' ll deal with it , but . . . . &quot; A nurse standing nearby gives Geist a hug . &quot; This is going_to work , &quot; she says . It doesn ' t . In fact , a month later , after her fourth failed attempt , Geist gave_up on the idea of genetic motherhood and was going_to try again with a donor egg . Further complicating the picture for patients confronting the assisted-reproductive-technology labyrinth is the dramatic fluctuation in take-home baby rates from clinic to clinic . Rates can vary from less than 5 % at some programs to a high of more_than 30 % at others , according to Dr. David Meldrum , director of the Center for Advanced Reproductive Care at South Bay Hospital in Redondo Beach . &quot; These are very complex procedures , with many different variables , &quot; Meldrum says . &quot; The research hasn ' t been done yet that will show you , you must do this particular thing at this particular time to get_the_best results . Without that knowledge , each program varies in the small details that make the difference between success and lack of it. &quot; He adds : &quot; I ' ve visited programs having great difficulty . They have individuals trying extremely hard to have a good outcome , they ' re very well trained , they ' re in agony , and yet it ' s difficult to put your finger on exactly where the problem is. &quot; Couples can improve their odds by using groups like RESOLVE or the resources of the American Fertility Society to get success rate data on clinics that register with the society ( most do ) . But checking on a particular clinic ' s rates in that manner still won ' t reveal how many of those who signed_on at the clinic actually took a baby home , because the group presents such rates in terms of how many births a program has had , per egg retrieval , rather than in terms of births per started attempt . &quot; About 15 % of women don ' t get_to egg retrieval , but those failures are discounted as if they never happened , &quot; notes Michael Katz , a supervisory investigative specialist with the Division of Service_Industry Practices at the Federal Trade Commission . &quot; The ( American Fertility Society ) position is that the whole process doesn ' t start until the egg is recovered . Our position is that the process starts when the consumer begins kicking over dollars ; those drugs cost quite a bit of money. &quot; In recent years , the FTC , virtually the only agency to watchdog these clinics , has chastised several for representing their success rates in a misleading way , exacting promises from each to practice truth-in-advertising . But that ' s virtually as much outside regulation as the industry has been subject_to . Although a voluntary lab accreditation program was recently initiated by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology , nothing currently mandates that IVF labs be licensed or prove their competency in any way . That could change . In 1992 , Congress approved a bill scheduled to go_into effect at the end of this year that gives each state the option to require that its IVF programs be licensed according to a national standard . It also demands that such clinics annually report success rates -- including numbers of started attempts as well as of egg retrievals -- to the government . Still , Rep . Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) , who sponsored the initial bill , refers to it as &quot; baby steps , &quot; and some complain that because clinic licensing won ' t be federally administered , the law has no teeth in it . Such minimal scrutiny , combined with a technology evolving at warp speed , and stiff competition ( billboards , radio spots , ads in upscale magazines designed to win business ) to attract the minority of infertile couples who can afford assisted reproductive techniques , leaves a margin for abuse . The new ICSI procedure could be a case_in_point . In Britain , embryologists who want to use it must prove their competence , then apply for a treatment license . In the United States , any lab that wants to offer the technique can do so . Last fall , the procedure won its 15 minutes of fame here , touted in headlines and on &quot; Donahue &quot; and &quot; Eye to Eye With Connie Chung , &quot; as the panacea for male infertility . &quot; In big urban_centers , people will call around to clinics asking , ' Do you offer it ? ' &quot; notes Barry Behr , director of the human embryology and andrology lab at Stanford_University . &quot; If you say no , they ' ll call elsewhere . It ' s a rat_race ; you almost have to stay one-up on the program down the road to get business. &quot; As the hype flew , embryologists from around the country took_off to Brussels to do a workshop at the clinic where ICSI had been developed . They returned to the United States with certificates to hang_on their walls , stating that they ' d taken the course . Yet , says micromanipulation pioneer Jacques Cohen of Cornell , &quot; I ' m afraid it is going_to be used quite wrongly by most programs . It ' s one of the most difficult technologies I ' ve ever been involved with . A lot of people think you can just take a needle , put a sperm in it and stick it in the egg . But you need the expertise to apply the procedure correctly. &quot; Century City ' s David Hill , who spent several days studying the procedure at Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta , where the first U.S. ICSI baby was born last fall , readily admits that he ' s still straddling a learning curve . The fertilization rates he ' s getting aren ' t better yet than those with SUZI . &quot; It is more challenging than other micro-manipulation procedures , &quot; says Hill , &quot; but we won ' t charge extra for it until I ' ve gotten three pregnancies . As I feel more comfortable with it , we may slowly , slowly start using it in lieu of SUZI. &quot; Not all clinics may be that circumspect . Behr also fears that some programs will move straight to prescribing this more high-tech , and pricey , treatment for infertile couples when lower-tech solutions might do instead . That sort of practice , he adds , is relatively common . &quot; It ' s one of the big controversies in the field today : At what point do you resort_to these aggressive , invasive procedures ? &quot; he asks . &quot; Some labs claim success using these aggressive treatments , while others can have success without them . In my mind , it ' s when you don ' t have to resort_to pulling_out every stop that you ' re doing a good job. &quot; TODAY IS A GOOD_DAY AT Century City ; there have been two positive pregnancy tests . Although the chance of a miscarriage during assisted-reproductive-technology pregnancies is 25 % ( slightly higher than the percentage in the general population ) , positive tests are still cause for rejoicing . &quot; I have a whistle I blow when someone gets pregnant , &quot; embryologist David Hill says . &quot; I used to take Polaroids of myself doing handstands , but I stopped because of my back. &quot; Hill ' s concern for the patients he works with is evident . &quot; Why aren ' t they getting pregnant ? &quot; he says of the Taylors . &quot; I wish I knew . If I could bleed a pint of my own blood to get them pregnant , I would do_it . In this business , that ' s not an infrequent feeling. &quot; Now sitting behind his desk , Hill is contemplating another troubling subject . Early last year , a collaborative study by epidemiologists from around the country suggested that the hormones used to stimulate women ' s ovaries to release extra eggs might raise their risk for ovarian cancer . &quot; Let ' s assume for the sake of argument that there is an inherent risk , &quot; says Hill . &quot; Now , I happen not to believe it . I think no study yet clearly shows that association . But let ' s say there was an association . This may still be something patients are willing to undertake , as long as they have a realistic estimate of the ratio of risk to benefit. &quot; The problem is , the information doesn ' t exist to help patients make that assessment . Moreover , Robert Spirtas , chief of the contraceptive and reproductive evaluation branch at the National Institutes of Health , disagrees that this particular study should be discounted . He admits that the research had methodological flaws because the author had limited data . Still , he says , &quot; the study raises an issue that we had really better look_at &quot; and notes that the institute plans to fund its own study on ovarian cancer and fertility_drugs , which millions of American women have now taken . To date , the potential risks of reproductive technologies have gone virtually unexplored . In 1990 , the World_Health_Organization sharply criticized the infertility community for doing more research on &quot; new and expanded uses for the technology &quot; than its effects on women using it , or on their children . &quot; This is one vast clinical trial , and no one is monitoring it , &quot; says author Ann Pappert . &quot; No one has a clue about what the long-term effects of these technologies will be_on the babies or on women , and nobody ' s doing much to try to find_out . The whole history of reproductive medicine is filled with these breakthroughs that , 10 or 20 years down the road , fill hospitals with patients having breast_implants or IUDs removed , or DES problems ( related to the drug given to pregnant women in the ' 50s that caused cancer in some of their daughters ) . The truth is that instead of waking_up after the fact , we should stop now and see if we ' re creating another problem. &quot; With 23 # 000 high-tech babies born in this country , the American Fertility Society puts the birth-defect rate in these children at less than 3 % , a figure equivalent_to that in the general population . Preliminary data from Australia , however , suggests that the rate of certain defects may be elevated in high-tech babies . Moreover , about one in three assisted-reproductive-technology babies is a multiple birth -- twins , triplets or , rarely , a higher number -- a result of transferring several embryos at once into a woman ' s reproductive tract . Children of multiple births are significantly likelier to suffer a range of health and developmental problems that can be a consequence , as pediatrician and geneticist Patricia Baird puts it , &quot; of being born too soon and too small. &quot; And the advent of micromanipulation has raised an entirely new series of concerns . For some years , scientists have subscribed_to a theory of natural_selection to explain why 200 million or more sperm are in the average ejaculation when only one is needed to fertilize the egg . The thinking has been that it ' s the hardiest sperm that helps create a human_being . But when an embryologist assumes godlike stature by arbitrarily selecting that single sperm from a marginal batch , it stands the concept of natural_selection on its head . Critics fear that the children of ICSI could be the products of a conception not &quot; meant &quot; to occur . IVF practitioners disagree . &quot; Natural_selection is baloney , &quot; scoffs Michael Tucker , scientific director of Reproductive Biology Associates . &quot; The female reproductive tract is not an assault course , OK ? It ' s not simply that Sparky Sperm , the biggest , meanest , toughest one , runs the marathon and gets_to the top of the egg first . Other_than the simple fact that sperm move toward the egg , the fertility event is close to being random. &quot; Still , Tucker concedes it would have been preferable if direct injection could have been tested in animals before being used in people . Earlier forms of micromanipulation were evaluated on non-human subjects , but ICSI is tricky to perform with animal sperm and eggs . In Belgium , where efforts are under way to track ICSI babies into young adulthood , rates of genetic defects seem to be no higher than in the general population . And for the most part , geneticists agree that a sperm can be malformed or sluggish without those attributes affecting its chromosomal content . Still , they point_out that the generation of male_children produced by micromanipulation is likely to endure its own infertility problems . Patricia Olds-Clark , a Temple University medical_school geneticist who is studying a mouse model of infertility , says : &quot; Their sperm are carrying genes that won ' t allow the sperm of their sons to fertilize in a normal way . And what ' s true in mice is going_to be true in humans. &quot; Moreover , Cornell ' s Jacques Cohen admits that there may be &quot; problem groups &quot; for whom micromanipulation is riskier . &quot; Patients with unexplained fertilization failure who come_to micromanipulation because regular IVF didn ' t work may have an increased incidence of congenital malformations , &quot; he notes . &quot; But those patients are rare , and they are counseled accordingly. &quot; At least , they are at Cornell . Whether other clinics tell similar patients_of this risk is not clear . THE SOCIETY FOR ASSISTED Reproductive Technology ' s Maria Bustillo has heard it all before . She knows that when the negative side of the assisted-reproductive-technology balance_sheet is totaled up , it smacks of a conspiracy being perpetrated by avaricious doctors on hapless couples . But she doesn ' t buy that point_of_view . &quot; We make a mistake if we just blame the providers of this technology , &quot; she insists . &quot; A lot of this is patient-driven . You have a couple in front of you , she ' s 43 with a borderline FSH level ( a hormonal measure ) and you tell her till your face is blue that her chances of having a baby are less than 2 % with IVF . And she goes_through with it and gets an embryo or two , then wants to do_it all again . Do I withhold that , as a doctor ? If I do , they may go and get_worse treatment somewhere else. &quot; In fact , infertile couples themselves remain among the most ardent defenders of their right to persevere in the face of slender odds or possible risks . Between 1990 and 1992 , Maria DiPaulo , 40 , of Queens , N.Y. , and her husband , Stan , 41 , tried IVF seven times , thanks to insurance that paid all but $ 4 # 000 of their $ 70 # 000 in medical_bills . The two knew their chances would plummet after attempt No . 4 . But , says Maria , &quot; I would n ' t have cared if it was just a 1 % chance. &quot; She was also aware , since she repeatedly mainlined hormones , that &quot; there could be repercussions in the years to come from all_the drugs I took . But I guess I think_about today ; I don ' t worry about that far down the road . You get so set_on doing whatever you can to make this pregnancy happen that risk isn ' t an obvious factor anymore. &quot; The DiPaulos , who recently adopted a little_girl , say that as frustrating as their experience was , it was ultimately a positive one . &quot; I think we never could have adopted if we hadn ' t gone_through all this , &quot; Stan says . &quot; It meant a lot to say we did everything we could. &quot; Then there ' s Terry Matthews ( her real name ) , 33 , a New Hampshire travel_agent who was born with only one ovary and lost the other to a cyst at age 24 . Matthews , who tried to adopt but couldn ' t find an available birth mother , was told that , using a donor egg , she had a 30 % to 35 % likelihood of success -- a decent gamble . But she says slimmer odds would n ' t have deterred her . &quot; When you make these decisions , they ' re not based on facts and figures ; it ' s pure emotion , &quot; she says . &quot; I don ' t know how low they would have had to have gone_for me to say forget it -- 10 % , 5 % ? I don ' t know . This was the only chance I had to have a child. &quot; In November , 1992 , on a second IVF attempt , she gave_birth to a boy , from her sister ' s donor egg . Ultimately , not even the sternest critics believe the IVF industry should grind to a halt . &quot; I ' m not calling_for a moratorium , &quot; says author Pappert . &quot; I just think there needs to be a hell of a lot more work done on determining the safety margin and on deciding who really needs it . And there needs to be more supervision. &quot; As for the Taylors , their determination to try ICSI hasn ' t wavered , but their focus is shifting slightly . As they prepare to return to Century City , they ' re also beginning the paperwork for adoption proceedings . &quot; You grow_up , as a woman , envisioning yourself going_through the process of giving_birth to a child that is biologically yours and your husband ' s , &quot; says Leslie . &quot; I think that physical void will probably always exist , but from what I understand , when they put a baby in your arms , it ' s yours. &quot; Adds John : &quot; It ' s difficult . We ' re definitely going_to give it another shot . But time keeps passing . We want an end to this . And I think this year we ' ll see that . One way or another . I think by the end of the year , we ' ll have a child. &quot;</TEXT>
