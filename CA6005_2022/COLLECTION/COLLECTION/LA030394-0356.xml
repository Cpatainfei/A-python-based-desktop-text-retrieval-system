   <HEADLINE> GUARD SHOOTS INMATE DURING BRAWL AT LANCASTER PRISON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A guard shot and wounded an inmate at the state_prison here Wednesday , the third such incident in the past month and the fourth since the prison opened in February , 1993 . The 1 p.m. shooting occurred after an unknown number of maximum security inmates began fighting with &quot; manufactured weapons &quot; and refused orders by guards to stop , said prison spokesman Kenn I . Hicks . Three inmates were injured in the fight , although only the gunshot victim was taken_to a hospital , Hicks said . The other two were treated by prison medical staff for superficial wounds . The names of the three inmates were not released pending notification of relatives . The shooting occurred about the same time that the prison ' s new interim warden , John Ratelle , took_control of the facility after the ouster last week of Warden Otis Thurman . Thurman , who had been in_charge of the prison since it opened 13 months ago , was told to retire or to accept a demotion and transfer after four escapes , including two by maximum security inmates , according to sources in the state_Department of Corrections . A group of maximum security inmates , Hicks said , were_on their way from their housing unit to the prison yard when an unknown number of them began fighting , using improvised knives . After orders to halt were ignored , Hicks said , a control-booth officer fired a single shot from a 9-millimeter carbine , hitting one inmate in the left shoulder . A similar incident occurred Feb . 9 , when a guard shot one of two inmates who were fighting and ignored orders to stop . On Feb . 15 , a maximum security inmate was shot after taking &quot; an aggressive stance &quot; and refusing to leave his cell when ordered to do so .</TEXT>
