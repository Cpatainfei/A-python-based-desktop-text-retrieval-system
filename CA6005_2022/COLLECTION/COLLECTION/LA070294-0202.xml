   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / ROUND OF 16 ; THE GOAL-DUST TWINS ; WITH ROMARIO AND BEBETO AT FORWARD , BRAZIL POSES A BIG PROBLEM , BUT AS MANY WILL ATTEST , IT ' S NOT ALWAYS FOR THE OTHER TEAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The forward is poised in front of a Brazilian flag , set to strike a ball that appears as if it will explode through the page of the magazine . The words with the advertisement read : &quot; The mood of a country usually swings with the economy . The mood of Brazil swings with Bebeto ' s right foot. &quot; But before you rush_out in pursuit of the advertiser ' s product , consider this scene : In the path leading from the field to the dressing rooms at Stanford Stadium , a stage has been constructed from which players and coaches can deliver words of wisdom to the world ' s soccer media . That is what Bebeto is doing , articulately explaining the finer points of Brazil ' s 2-0 victory over Russia in the World Cup ' s first round , when his partner at forward , Romario , saunters past . Suddenly , Bebeto is alone as dozens of Brazilian reporters turn and follow Romario up the stairs and to the door of the team bus , where he finally bestows on them two sentences before disappearing inside . Is there any question about who is the man among the boys from Brazil ? As Brazilians say , each team needs a singing rooster , and on the team that will meet the United States at Stanford Stadium in the second round Monday , it is Romario de Souza Faria who sings . In interviews , which have been few and far between at the team ' s heavily secured Villa Felice headquarters here , he has admitted that he is an egotist and selfish . But as the player most relied_on by his teammates to score , he says -- almost apologetically -- he must assume those characteristics to be effective . If it is a role , it is one he relishes . He seeks attention with the same intensity he seeks a seam in the defense -- getting_married in 1988 to his 17-year-old girlfriend while standing on a local stadium ' s penalty spot in a ceremony that was televised live , calling living legend Pele senile and &quot; a museum piece &quot; and convening a news_conference to announce his refusal to sit in his assigned seat next to Bebeto on the team plane . Besides , he said , he wanted a window_seat . Although Romario often offers unsolicited advice to his coaches about who should and should not be playing , he acknowledges that Bebeto belongs alongside him in Brazil ' s lineup . That does not mean Romario has to like him . They are unrelenting rivals in Spain ' s first division , where Romario , 28 , plays for traditional power FC Barcelona , and Bebeto , 30 , for upstart Deportivo de La Coruna . But the rivalry began more_than a decade ago , when they were correctly identified as two of Brazil ' s rising stars , and , according to team officials , stemmed from a personality clash . For evidence of that , look no further than their lifestyles in Spain . Bebeto is a devoted family_man who brought his housekeeper from Brazil to Spain so that the lives of his wife and children would not be so greatly disrupted when he moved there to play . Romario also is married and has two children , but he and his best_friend , Barcelona teammate Hristo Stoichkov of Bulgaria , are vigorous participants in the city ' s midnight-to-dawn nightclub scene . Even in recent kidnap incidents in Brazil involving the families of both players , Romario ' s was more dramatic . Reputed mobsters tried to kidnap Bebeto ' s wife and brother , but five others actually did abduct Romario ' s 62-year-old father , Edevair Souza de Faria . Demanding $ 7-million ransom , they held him for six days before they were caught by police . Not only did they not harm him , they provided him with a mattress , cold beer and a television so he could watch his son play a game in Spain . But although it is convenient for the media to paint contrasting pictures of the two strikers , they are not so different as it appears on the surface . Romario flaunts his impoverished childhood , speaking often of the Rio de Janeiro favela -- shantytown -- where he grew_up and the coins he earned by washing car windshields at stop lights . Jose ( Bebeto ) Roberto Gama de Oliveira does not talk as much about it , but he also grew_up poor in the provincial city of Salvador de Bahia . Both also are secure enough in their talents to speak out against their coaches . After leading Brazil to the silver medal in the 1988 Summer Olympics , they protested bitterly when Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni used them for a combined total of only 72 minutes during the 1990 World Cup . Bebeto was so put_off by Lazaroni ' s successor as the national coach , Paulo Roberto Falcao , that he quit until a new coach , Carlos Alberto Parreira , was hired . The injured party then was Romario , whose complaints when left_out of the lineup for an exhibition_game against Germany were so divisive that Parreira suspended him for nine months . Brought back to the team for the final World Cup qualifying game against Uruguay , Romario scored both goals in a 2-0 victory . The ability to score is something else Bebeto and Romario have in common . After Bebeto led Spain ' s first division in 1992-93 with 29 goals , Romario led last season with 30 . In the first round of this World Cup , Romario had three of Brazil ' s six goals and precipitated another when he was fouled in the penalty area . Bebeto has one goal and one assist , but at least one opponent thinks he is a more valuable player than Romario . &quot; Bebeto can do more , &quot; Cameroon defender Samuel Ekeme Ndiba said after a 3-0 loss to Brazil . &quot; He can create things with his dribbling and crossing passes . He ' s more athletic . He is more_than just a goal getter. &quot; Bebeto , 5 feet 10 and 145 pounds , is quick , agile and so adept with the ball that Pele has suggested he should be the play-making midfielder . If he has a weakness , it is that defenders can knock him off the ball -- if they can catch him . When they do , he often whines to the referee . Romario stuck him with the nickname &quot; Chorao &quot; -- Crybaby . Romario , in contrast , stands only 5-6 , but he weighs 154 pounds and cannot be pushed_around . His weakness is that he seldom will go searching for the ball , but when it comes_to him he can be devastating . &quot; I stand there , &quot; he says , &quot; pretending I am dead. &quot; Parreira calls him &quot; the king of the penalty area. &quot; Hardly contrite after his suspension , Romario still advises Parreira on the lineup . When Pele recently said that Romario should let the coach coach , Romario responded by calling Pele &quot; mentally retarded. &quot; But Parreira has learned to let Romario be Romario . The forward , who says that practicing is a waste of calories , was excused from the team ' s final training camp before leaving for the United States because he wanted to play volleyball on the beach with friends . Asked recently if Romario is a problem , Parreira said , &quot; Yes , he ' s a big problem -- for the other team. &quot; Romario has tried hard to become a team player for the World Cup . &quot; I know I am a difficult guy , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s because I ' m authentic . I say what I think to your face . But the other players like me because they know that if Romario does_well , the team will get results . I ' ve been telling everybody that I ' m ready to give my blood for this Cup. &quot; So far , he has fit_in well with his teammates , playing drums for their improvisational samba band . As long as he continues scoring , it does not matter if he marches to a different conga . Times staff writer Mike Penner contributed to this story .</TEXT>
