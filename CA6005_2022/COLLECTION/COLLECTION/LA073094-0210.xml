   <HEADLINE> AN ' INGENIUS ' IDEA WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED ; CABLE : A FREE ON-LINE NEWS SERVICE HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 1986 , BUT FEW PEOPLE USE IT . THE ANTELOPE VALLEY CAN COUNT NINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Antelope Valley residents received a flyer in the mail recently for a national service that sends up-to-the-minute news , financial and sports data direct to their home or office computers via cable TV lines , two conclusions would have been natural . First , that the service , known as Ingenius , must be the latest breakthrough on the information superhighway , as the cable industry tries to move beyond carrying just pictures . And second , that it is probably costly to use , like some_other on-line computer information providers . But they ' d have been wrong on both counts . Ingenius is not new . It has been carried nationally since 1986 and locally on Jones Intercable systems in the Antelope Valley and Oxnard-Port Hueneme areas since 1989 , although it remains virtually unknown and unused by consumers . As for cost , the service is actually free on most cable_systems that carry it , including Jones , after subscribers pay a $ 150 one-time equipment fee . &quot; It ' s an incredibly rich thing . I use it every day and have for almost 10 years , &quot; said analyst Larry Gerbrandt of the media research firm Paul Kagan Associates Inc. in Carmel . &quot; As far as I ' m concerned , it ' s probably the biggest bargain in the on-line business. &quot; Ingenius , which functions as a personalized news service , offers general news , stock quotes , sports , entertainment and even state-by-state weather reports . Yet Gerbrandt is the exception . In the Antelope Valley , only nine people out of 63 # 000 cable households subscribe_to Ingenius . The number is similarly small in Oxnard and Port Hueneme . Nationally , the service -- founded by Tele-Communications Inc. , the nation ' s largest cable operator -- has fewer than 100 # 000 adult users , despite being available to nearly 30 million households . &quot; The primary use at_home is by news junkies . God , they love us . But there aren ' t enough of those guys , &quot; said Jerry Bennington , chief_executive of the Denver-based service . Analyst Gerbrandt said Ingenius ' tiny customer base is a testament to the cable industry ' s failure so far to effectively promote non-video services or to appeal_to small , specialized audiences . However , company officials and others in the cable industry say Ingenius has suffered in part because it arrived in the mid-1980s , before the explosive growth in the home computer market , and because of marketing kinks and consumer unfamiliarity with the cable-computer combination . Formerly known as X-Press Information Services Ltd. , the company was founded in 1985 by a partnership of TCI , McGraw-Hill Inc. and a third firm . At first , it relied_on TCI systems as its clients . Ingenius ' current owner is Liberty Media Corp. , a TCI offshoot based in nearby Englewood , Colo. , that TCI has proposed to reacquire . Liberty Media , a publicly held cable_systems concern , does not report separate results for Ingenius . But after long losing money , the information service today is self-supporting , Bennington said , without offering details . For the $ 150 start-up price , users buy from the company a small converter box , computer software and connectors . The data feed arrives over the same cable lines that carry television signals . It goes_through the converter box and a serial cable into PC-compatible or Macintosh computers . There , only the categories of information selected by the user ( down to levels such_as Washington news and college football ) appear on the computer , where they are available for viewing and printing . But there are disadvantages that Bennington and others say have contributed to Ingenius ' relative obscurity . Although the information feed is continuous , consumers can capture it only when their computers are left on , which some people are reluctant to do . Also , the service is not interactive , meaning users can tap into and save the data that arrives but cannot ask the system to provide specific information . And unlike the on-line services such_as Prodigy and America Online , Ingenius has no electronic_mail or discussion group capabilities . Marketing has also been a problem . Bennington said cable_systems have not pitched the service to their customers . Because it is often included in the basic cable package , companies get no extra revenue from it . Cable operators , on the other hand , say Ingenius has done little to help them market it . While Ingenius says it has fewer than 100 # 000 non-school users , one industry estimate put the number at 60 # 000 . The two biggest dial-up services , CompuServe and Prodigy , have about 2 million and 1.3 million subscribers , respectively , according to Information &amp; Interactive Services Report .</TEXT>
