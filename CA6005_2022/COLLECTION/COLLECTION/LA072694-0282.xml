   <HEADLINE> PUMPING UP THE VOLUME ; DTS NEARS SETTLEMENT WITH RIVAL IN DIGITAL MOVIE SOUND , BUT NOW FACES CHALLENGE FROM SONY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Digital Theater Systems is close to resolving its legal dispute with French rival L.C. Concept , thus freeing the company to turn its attention to Sony Corp. , its latest major rival in the competitive digital soundtrack movie_theater wars . DTS , which is based in Westlake Village , will purchase worldwide rights to the digital sound patent of L.C. Concept of Paris , through an agreement expected to be signed within a week . Sources place the settlement in the $ 2.6-million range . But Bill Neighbors , DTS vice_president and general_manager , said the figure was off target . L.C. attorney David Makous would n ' t comment . Under the tentative agreement , DTS , and its part-owner Universal Studios , will agree to drop several lawsuits they filed against L.C. in recent months . Digital movie sound quality is similar to compact_discs used in home stereo_systems . Through computer_technology , it offers crystal-clear tones , free_of the hisses and pops that sometimes plague traditional movie soundtracks . DTS ' hardware is now in more_than 2 # 000 theaters worldwide , giving it a leg up in a race for sound_systems with Dolby Laboratories of San Francisco . But after several delays , Sony Corp . will introduce its Sony Dynamic Digital Sound_system in 150 of its 900 Sony Theatres ( formerly Loews Theatres ) by the end of the year , said Jim Fiedler , SDDS president . Fiedler said the company has firm commitments from other exhibitors , but he would n ' t disclose which ones . Sony has had &quot; lengthy discussions &quot; with all_of the major motion_picture studios , said spokeswoman Gemma Richardson . The company expects to see its sound format on non-Sony Pictures Entertainment movies soon , Richardson said . Meanwhile at DTS , Neighbors said the company isn ' t fazed by Sony ' s entry . &quot; We ' re just selling units and making movies , &quot; Neighbors said . But he added , &quot; I take them ( Sony ) very seriously. &quot; Sony is arriving late in a business that received its first big push last summer with Universal ' s release of Steven Spielberg ' s &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; in DTS . Spielberg , along with Universal , is an investor in DTS . DTS is used in several key summer films , such_as Universal ' s and Spielberg ' s &quot; The Flintstones , &quot; MGM ' s &quot; Blown Away &quot; and New Line Cinema ' s &quot; The Mask , &quot; which opens July 29 . But the studios are splitting their bets_on digital sound formats . Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox are releasing some key summer films in both DTS and Dolby digital sound formats . Fox ' s &quot; Speed &quot; and the Arnold Schwarzenegger hit &quot; True Lies &quot; carry both formats , as does Paramount ' s &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; with Tom Hanks , and the upcoming &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger , &quot; the third film based on Tom Clancy ' s novels . That way , the movies can play in digital sound on whatever system an exhibitor has . Meanwhile , Disney ' s blockbuster &quot; The Lion King &quot; is a top box_office draw featuring the Dolby digital sound format . Despite Sony ' s delay in getting its system to market , most acknowledge that Sony , with its vast resources , will be a significant force . The company ' s pitch to exhibitors is that its system offers better sound quality and durability than its rivals . It ' s also the only system to offer a digital track backup , should the principal digital track fail . &quot; Sony is the 800-pound gorilla in this thing , &quot; said Bill Mead , vice_president of film marketing at Dolby in San Francisco . * All motion_pictures from Sony Pictures Entertainment -- Columbia Pictures , TriStar , Sony Pictures Classics and Triumph Releasing -- will feature SDDS . Columbia ' s &quot; The Next Karate Kid , &quot; the latest installment in the popular series starring Pat Morita , will be the first film in major release featuring SDDS . It opens Aug . 5 . For the past year , Sony has been testing SDDS on Sony pictures in a handful of theaters , including General Cinema ' s Galaxy in Hollywood , AMC ' s multiplex in Century City and the United Artists theater in Westwood . &quot; We ' ve made this equipment foolproof , &quot; said Fiedler . Sony officials say they ' re not concerned about the competition . &quot; Sony is one of the fathers of digital sound , &quot; said Fiedler . At $ 13 # 800 per theater , Sony ' s hardware is the most expensive of the three alternatives for theater operators . DTS ' hardware has a list_price of $ 5 # 950 per screen ; Dolby ' s cost one-half to one-third more_than DTS ' rate , but that doesn ' t include the extra costs of buying the DTS sound discs , which go_for $ 100 a set for each film print . Exhibitors have been reluctant to commit to one format over another , convinced that eventually the industry will embrace one standard . They prefer not to buy multiple pieces of equipment . But at the moment , some cinemas are investing in more_than one digital sound_system . For example , the independent Edwards Theatre Circuit Inc. , based in Newport Beach , has installed both DTS and Dolby equipment in 65 to 70 of the chain ' s 410 total screens . &quot; I feel both systems will coexist , &quot; said chairman James Edwards . There ' s no doubt the public is sold on digital movie sound , said Tim Warner , president of the National Assn . of Theater Owners trade association of California and Nevada . But with the absence of a clear standard , exhibitors are investing in multiple formats , Warner said . DTS has an exclusive deal with Universal that all_of that studios ' films will be_on DTS . In addition , DTS has an exclusive deal with Spielberg ' s production firm Amblin Entertainment and with MGM / UA Distribution Co . The DTS format has also been used on films from several other studios . So far , DTS has been_on 39 movies ; 2 # 368 theaters worldwide are equipped with DTS hardware . Dolby reports that Dolby Stereo Digital Sound has been_on 50 to 60 movies . Its hardware is installed at 700 to 850 theaters worldwide . As for DTS ' s likely settlement with small French rival L.C. Concept , the firm ' s head , Elisabeth Lochen , may become a consultant at DTS , said DTS President Terry Beard . Lochen ' s involvement with DTS isn ' t part of the agreement , however . * With the purchase of L.C. ' s patent , DTS has eliminated one competitor , albeit a tiny one . L.C. wasn ' t successful in Hollywood , but its digital sound format had been used in an estimated 30 pictures in France , Belgium and Switzerland since 1991 . With the L.C. dispute behind it , DTS will renew its push in Europe . It ' s setting_up a European headquarters in Brussels and it has put DTS recording equipment installations in five major European sound studios in four countries , said DTS ' Neighbors .</TEXT>
