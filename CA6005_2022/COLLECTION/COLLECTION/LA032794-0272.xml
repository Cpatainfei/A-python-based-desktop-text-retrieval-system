   <HEADLINE> STAKES HIGH IN POST-COMMUNIST UKRAINE ELECTION ; POLITICS : IN TODAY ' S VOTE , WIDESPREAD APATHY COMPETES WITH FRUSTRATION TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT ' S INABILITY TO STOP THE ECONOMIC HEMORRHAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a historic but wildly confusing exercise in democracy , Ukrainians head for the polls today to try to elect their first post-Communist Parliament . The contest could bring an end to the chronic political chaos that has plagued and impoverished this new nation of 52 million . Or it could doom a still-nuclear country the size of France to more infighting , corruption and political paralysis , deeper regional rifts , and even disintegration . The stakes have not been higher -- nor the political terrain more bewildering -- since Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet_Union in August , 1991 . A staggering 5 # 833 candidates from 29 parties are competing for 450 seats . But the election law is so Byzantine that the contest may_not produce a quorum of 301 lawmakers even after a runoff election scheduled for April 10 . If this occurs , the entire election might have to be repeated , prolonging the political turmoil . President Leonid Kravchuk has said that under such a scenario , he would ask the old Parliament to approve a draft constitution ; seek expanded presidential powers , and postpone the presidential and regional elections now scheduled for June . If the elections do manage to produce a new Parliament , it is not clear whether it will be any more progressive or competent than the old one . &quot; It ' s hard to be optimistic in_view of the recent elections in Lithuania , Poland and Russia , &quot; in which Communists and nationalists scored big gains , one Western diplomat here said . &quot; Unfortunately , much of the population identifies change and reform with what ' s already happened , and they ' re not very impressed with it. &quot; Widespread political apathy competes with profound frustration with the government ' s inability to stop Ukraine ' s economic hemorrhage . &quot; Communists who repainted themselves as democrats and fathers of the Ukrainian rebirth promised us meat and fat , and then for two years they did nothing but loot Ukraine and take planeloads of hard currency , &quot; Sergei I . Shuvainikov , chairman of the Russian Party of Crimea , said in summing_up the views of many Ukrainians . A recent poll found that 84 % fault the government ' s disastrous handling of the Ukrainian economy . Production in the state sector shrank by 25 % last year , and inflation went_into orbit at 6 # 000 % to 10 # 000 % , according to various estimates . Not surprisingly , most Ukrainians want to throw the incumbents out . Although 52 % had not decided whom to vote for , 62 % vowed to vote against the incumbent lawmakers . About 150 of the 450 members_of_Parliament are standing_for reelection , and many are in deep trouble . If voters bother to turn_out , some of Ukraine ' s biggest political names could find themselves unemployed . But to choose a better bunch of representatives , the inexperienced electorate will have to grapple with issues far more complex than those faced by voters in most Western democracies : * What is the path to economic salvation ? Many wonder whether Ukraine can launch long-delayed free-market reform without inviting &quot; shock therapy. &quot; * How can the nationalist , Ukrainian-speaking Western region , which mistrusts Russia and seeks economic and military integration with Europe , be reconciled with industrial , Russified eastern Ukraine , which seeks closer economic ties with Russia ? * Should Ukraine continue to implement the nuclear disarmament agreement Kravchuk signed with the American and Russian presidents in January , despite concern about rising Russian nationalism and separatist movements in the Crimea and the eastern region of Donetsk ? &quot; America is doing everything possible to weaken Ukraine , &quot; said Viktor Melnick , a leader of the Ukrainian National Assembly , which favors keeping Ukraine a nuclear_power . The hard-line nationalist group has candidates running in 70 districts , sympathizers in 80 more , and its own paramilitary_organization . &quot; As soon as the last warhead is taken_out of Ukraine , then armed conflict will begin , &quot; Melnick said . &quot; It will create major instability in the heart of Europe. &quot; Nationwide , support for such dire views is slim . Moreover , the election system , which consists_of 450 individual races and requires that at least 25 % of all registered voters in each district vote for the winning candidate , prevents the emergence of a national extremist leader like Russia ' s Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky . But a strong showing by nationalists in the west , Socialists and Communists in the east or separatists in Crimea could accelerate dangerous forces . Local officials in the Donetsk region called a referendum on making Russian as well as Ukrainian an official state language , making Ukraine into a federation of its regions , and becoming a full member of the economic union of the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States . Crimean residents will also be asked to vote to give their strategic peninsula more autonomy , a move some see as a precursor to secession from Ukraine and reunification with Russia . After legal squabbles with Kiev , both referendums were downgraded to legally non-binding plebiscites . Although the proposals outrage Ukrainian nationalists , they are expected to pass . Fighting for the mainstream vote are two new coalitions that each claim the reformist mantle . The voice of the east is ousted Prime_Minister Leonid Kuchma , now leading the Interregional Bloc for Reform . Kuchma argues that the West doesn ' t care about Ukraine , so partnership with Moscow is essential . &quot; They think that if they re-establish ties with Russia , everything will be fine , &quot; said Kravchuk adviser Mikola I . Mihalchenko , who argues that Russia has enough industrial white_elephants of its own to have designs on the obsolete metals plants and inefficient coal mines of eastern Ukraine . &quot; It cannot be , because neither Ukraine nor Russia are what they were before. &quot; The voice of the west is nationalist Vyacheslav Chornovil , head of the Rukh movement and a veteran of the Ukrainian independence drive . Chornovil and his Ukrayina Democratic Coalition have fielded 342 candidates and hope to claim a fifth of the seats in Parliament . It won ' t be easy for voters to even figure_out who ' s who . Three-quarters of the 5 # 833 candidates are running as independents , even though they may have party ties . The average ballot will list 13 names , and voters will have to cross_off every candidate they don ' t want in_order to elect the one they do . Despite all_the obstacles , &quot; this is the first election where the Communist_Party does not control all_the levers of power as it did before , &quot; said former U.S. diplomat Myron Wasylyk . That is no guarantee that the new Parliament will be a paragon of civic-minded reform , but Wasylyk believes it will be better than the last legislature , in which Communists held 239 of the 450 seats , Democrats and centrists believed &quot; compromise &quot; meant &quot; sellout , &quot; and none could cooperate with Kravchuk , a former Communist . &quot; It can ' t be worse , &quot; Wasylyk said . &quot; It just can ' t be worse. &quot; Reports of election law violations , petty and less so , have poured into Kiev . In Dnepropetrovsk , candidates were warned to mind their campaign-trail manners after some promised voters free funerals -- an attractive offer fo impoverished pensioners . In the Poltava region , gasoline prices dropped abruptly after the chairman of the State Commission on Oil and Gas announced his candidacy there , according to Elections 94 , a Kiev-based watchdog group . On election eve , a candidate from the Ukrayina coalition was accosted in the eastern region of Dnepropetrovsk by four attackers who stomped on his Ukrainian flag and shouted anti-Ukrainian slurs . Two of his supporters were hospitalized and two attackers jailed , authorities said . But there were also signs of a real attempt to make the election fair . A young Rukh activist who in past elections had voted for himself and for his parents went_to cast an absentee_ballot on the outskirts of Kiev on Friday . Election officials handed him a huge list with 25 candidates to choose from , but they would only give him one ballot .</TEXT>
