   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : IT ' S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU SICK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For purely food-related reasons , I have recently come_to regret the end of the Cold_War . Nothing personal against the fall of communism , but life was so_much less complicated when all we had to worry about was the destruction of the Earth by a misplaced finger on a nuclear trigger . Sure , there was the occasional 15-part New Yorker series on the dangers of living under high-power lines , but who had time to read those things ? Cancer clusters ? Ebola virus ? Sorry , too busy worrying about a nuclear holocaust to think_about them . Now , thanks to the absence of an external bogey man -- bogey person , I should say -- upon which to fixate , we have to face all kinds of unpleasant new threats , all coming from within our borders , all invisible to the naked eye , all having to do with our food and water_supply . Scientifically speaking , icky things that can make you sick have replaced communism as the biggest threat to the American way_of_life . * Last week we were treated to a number of news_stories coinciding with the first anniversary of the Minneapolis cryptosporidium outbreak . The bacterium invaded that city ' s water_supply around this time last year , causing severe gastrointestinal illness and more_than 100 deaths . It must have been awful . Imagine former President George_Bush at a Japanese banquet . Imagine half a city acting like that . Imagine having to clean it up . Then , during an hour devoted to pesticides in the food supply , last week ' s &quot; 48 Hours &quot; featured a segment on four Midwestern families . The families shopped_at their regular markets for produce , then handed_over their apples and lettuce and broccoli to the producers , who sent the stuff off to chemists for analysis . Most of the samples tested positive for pesticides , leading one of the moms to weep on camera . The bad news just gets_worse : Washing fruits and vegetables doesn ' t necessarily make them clean because pesticides are not water soluble . And waxing -- a common practice among purveyors of produce -- not only keeps fruit and vegetables fresh , but may keep them coated with pesticides too . The show featured the obligatory back and forth between the experts : One said even a little pesticide residue is too_much , the other said allowable levels are too small to worry about . You would dearly love to believe the second guy , but as one of the stricken moms so rightly pointed_out : They used to say smoking was OK too . As I watched , all I could picture were great big gobs of greasy grimy pesticide residues on the juicy strawberries my child has been inhaling by the pint . How do we know that children who ingest a cornucopia of pesticide today will not sprout horns tomorrow ? The only solution seems to be to buy organic produce . Thankfully , Birkenstocks remain optional . * Early this year , the Times ' Food section ran a frightening and clear-eyed story about the myriad dangers in our presumably safe food supply . Hot dogs , chicken , eggs , oysters , fish , milk , cantaloupe , soft cheeses -- you name it . Potential bacterial bombs , just waiting to explode in your child ' s delicate intestines . What stood_out for me -- and haunts me to this day -- was a passage about hamburger meat : &quot; Other nations , with wildly different degrees of sanitation , are also playing a greater role in the American food supply . . . . Even today , for instance , a single hamburger patty may contain meat from hundreds of animals raised in different countries under varying degrees of regulation. &quot; And even as the government and some food producers are unable to uphold stringent hygiene standards , Food and Drug Administration officials announced last week that they had approved for_sale a genetically engineered tomato . The tomato , &quot; designed &quot; by Calgene Inc. of Davis , Calif. , will be marketed under the MacGregor label and might be in_stores as early as next week . Its altered genetic structure will enable the tomato to ripen on the vine and stay fresher longer . The idea of a tomato whose genes have been tampered with ( besides the temptation to make lousy sexist jokes ) does indeed have a certain allure . I almost had decided to give one a try until I heard what FDA Commissioner David Kessler had to say about it : &quot; Foods produced by genetic_engineering are as safe as food in our grocery_stores today. &quot; And to think I was so worried about nuclear destruction .</TEXT>
