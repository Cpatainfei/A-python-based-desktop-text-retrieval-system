   <HEADLINE> WILSON ACTS TO ENFORCE PARTS OF PROP . 187 ; 8 LAWSUITS FILED ; IMMIGRATION : THE GOVERNOR ORDERS PRENATAL CARE HALTED WHILE A SAN FRANCISCO JUDGE BARS EXPULSIONS FROM SCHOOL . RELIGIOUS_LEADERS AND RIORDAN URGE CALM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The battle over Proposition 187 shifted quickly from the ballot_box to courtrooms , to government chambers and the streets Wednesday as Californians , in a resounding Election_Day mandate , ushered_in a new era of stern restrictions against illegal immigrants . Acting immediately to put the measure he vigorously campaigned for into effect , newly reelected Gov . Pete Wilson issued a toughly worded executive order directing health_care_providers to discontinue prenatal services and new admissions to nursing_homes for illegal immigrants . &quot; The people of California have passed Proposition 187 , now we must enforce it , &quot; said Wilson at a morning press_conference . But Wilson was already encountering resistance in the form of lawsuits . At least eight were filed_in various state and federal_courts . By midafternoon , a San Francisco Superior_Court judge , acting_on a lawsuit filed on behalf of the Los Angeles and San Francisco Unified School districts and the California School_Boards Assn. , temporarily barred enforcement of the proposition ' s requirement that illegal immigrants be expelled from California public_schools . In a separate order , the judge extended the order to public colleges and universities . Meanwhile , in Los Angeles , a federal_district judge presiding over a legal challenge brought by civil_rights groups ordered that he be notified of any &quot; substantive &quot; enforcement of the initiative prior to a court hearing he scheduled for Wednesday . But spokesmen for Wilson and Atty Gen . Dan Lungren said they will proceed in implementing the non-education portions of the initiative because the judge did not directly order them to halt such actions . Among the rapid-fire developments Wednesday after the measure ' s overwhelming passage by a 59 % -41 % margin : * The Los Angeles City_Council voted 10 to 3 to direct city employees not to follow any provisions of the measure , except its crackdown on the sale and possession of fake identity documents , until legal challenges have been completed . The council also voted to pursue any and all legal_action to overturn the initiative , which bans illegal immigrants from government funded non-emergency services and requires local officials to report those suspected of being illegal immigrants to state and federal authorities . * Clinton_Administration officials said they will take no &quot; precipitous &quot; action to cut_off federal funding to California for health , education and social_welfare programs , saying they prefer to wait for the results of litigation aimed at thwarting the measure . Analysts have said that as much as $ 15 billion in annual federal funding is at risk because the initiative ' s requirement on reporting suspects runs counter to federal confidentiality requirements . * Religious_leaders and city leaders urged the community to remain calm and called_on parents to continue sending their children to school without fear . &quot; I urge all Angelenos to ignore rumors and to continue to express their opinions regarding this law in a peaceful manner , &quot; said Mayor Richard Riordan . Several small anti-187 rallies took_place , including a gathering of 200 demonstrators outside the Downtown Reagan State Building , but they remained peaceful . * Seeking to dispel fears that the initiative could lead to a public health crisis , Wilson announced that he would &quot; take whatever steps are necessary &quot; to continue to provide immunizations or any other measures needed to prevent communicable_disease . As dawn broke over California on Wednesday , there was little evidence of panic or immediate service cut-offs among the affected population . In communities from San Francisco to South-Central Los Angeles , it was business as usual , as illegal immigrants who work as day_laborers , kitchen employees and at other jobs went_about their daily routines . &quot; We can ' t be afraid , we have to confront this issue , &quot; said Juan Carlos , 30 , the father of three , as he waited for work outside a Homebase store in Ladera Heights . &quot; It is either this or starve. &quot; Carlos and fellow laborers said they did not believe sheriff ' s deputies who patrol the area would enforce the proposition . Under the measure , law_enforcement officers can only question those already arrested for other offenses . In the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s South Bureau , where there has been nearly a murder a day this year , overworked detectives said they cannot even keep_up with the growing roll of homicides , let alone ask arrestees for green_cards . &quot; I don ' t have enough detectives to check on my murders . So how am I going_to keep track of that administrative lunacy ? &quot; asked Lt . Sergio Robleto , commander of the bureau ' s homicide detail . A wave of depression and introspection swept_over public_school campuses Wednesday morning , where just a week before student protests hit their peak with more_than 10 # 000 young people walking_out_of class in Los Angeles alone . On Wednesday , there were only a handful of small protests involving fewer than 500 students and school administrators grappled with ways to help students cope_with disappointment . &quot; I ' m just too stunned to do anything , &quot; said Luz Castillo , a 17-year-old Reseda High_School student who just two weeks ago organized an anti-187 walkout and forum . There were sporadic reports of students staying home from school for fear of deportation or of getting injured in post-election violence . But Los Angeles Unified School District administrators said that a spot check of attendance showed it was near normal . The school district ' s efforts to blunt the impact of the law ' s passage included establishing an information hot_line , sending letters home to parents promising that their children will not be asked_for immigration documents , and encouraging principals to hold on-campus forums about the law . Even two of the larger walkouts staged Wednesday in Los Angeles attracted small crowds and ended without incident . Students from Hamilton High_School embarked_on a five-hour , eight-mile odyssey that took them to four rally sites on the Westside . At Olive Vista Middle_School in Sylmar , about 50 students walked_out in the morning , but were returned to school and suspended as part of a new district policy , announced Monday , to treat marchers like any other truants . Even at Leuzinger High_School , where a Proposition 187 protest sparked a racial brawl Friday , early morning rumors of violence remained just that : rumors . Instead , by afternoon , leaders from sparring African American and Latino groups ran a victory lap around the campus , some arm in arm , celebrating a truce hammered_out during meetings with district mediators . At one end of the spectrum , Long_Beach Unified School District has vowed to uphold the new law , but asked the State Board_of_Education to postpone its initial implementation from January to next September , to coincide with the academic calendar . Meanwhile , at a news_conference shortly after classes began for the day , Los Angeles school_board President Mark Slavkin , joined by representatives of the California School_Boards Assn. , announced they were lodging an immediate legal challenge to the initiative in the courtroom of San Francisco Superior_Court Judge Stuart R . Pollak . By late Monday morning , Pollak was also considering two lawsuits filed by students whose illegal status jeopardizes their ability to continue to attend public_schools and universities . Sponsors and opponents of Proposition 187 have agreed that a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision that granted illegal immigrants the right to a free public education would have to be reconsidered before the initiative ' s education ban could take_effect . Pollak , in_handing down his temporary restraining order early in the afternoon , cited that decision , Plyler vs . Doe . &quot; There are serious legal questions here , to say the least , that need to be resolved , &quot; said Pollak , noting that the Supreme Court ruling &quot; seems to prohibit and invalidate at least portions of this measure. &quot; California Deputy Atty . Gen . Stephanie Wald , representing Wilson , opposed the order and argued that it was unnecessary because Proposition 187 ' s education provision would not take_effect until January . But attorneys for the plaintiffs pointed to provisions that appeared to take_effect immediately and warned that some schools might try to prevent illegal immigrants from continuing in their classrooms . They also told Pollak that Atty . Gen . Lungren had issued a memorandum informing school districts to implement the proposition immediately . Pollak set a court date for Nov . 28 for arguments on whether to issue a preliminary injunction . He said he expects to postpone the eventual hearing until Feb . 8 if all parties agree at the next court date . In Los Angeles , U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne Jr . stopped short of formally and immediately barring implementation of the law , as a coalition of civil_rights groups had sought . But he strongly indicated that he wanted enforcement of the entire measure held_in abeyance until both sides have time to present legal arguments . &quot; I want the court to be notified of any firm -- not rumor -- indication of enforcement of ( the measure ) in this time , &quot; Byrne said , extending the order to attorneys for both the state and four groups of organizations and individuals challenging the measure . &quot; It is the impact on individuals that I ' m concerned about , &quot; Byrne told Deputy Atty . Gen . Jon M . Ichinaga , who was representing state health agencies and Wilson ' s office . He ordered all parties to advise him in writing &quot; of any substantive &quot; action to enforce the measure . In the interim , Byrne said state officials may proceed with &quot; in-house &quot; preparations for enforcement of the measure without &quot; violating the spirit of what I ' m attempting to do. &quot; The lawsuit by the civil_rights groups charges that the voter-approved initiative unlawfully intrudes on federal jurisdiction over immigration and denies various constitutional rights partly by encouraging discrimination against persons who appear or sound foreign . &quot; What we have in_effect is no implementation , no enforcement of Proposition 187 , &quot; Antonia Hernandez , president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , told reporters after Byrne ' s ruling . &quot; The judge made_it very clear the spirit of his concern was it not be applied to individuals. &quot; Attorney Mark Rosenbaum , a director of the American Civil Liberties Union , said the spirit of the judge ' s order applies to all agencies with any potential enforcement responsibilities under the measure . &quot; If there is any denial ( of services ) we will bring it to his attention , &quot; Rosenbaum said . But Ichinaga interpreted the judge ' s words differently . He said Byrne clearly implied &quot; he would raise a concern &quot; if the measure was enforced in the next week . But Ichinaga added that Byrne &quot; did not issue an injunction against the state . It seems to me he basically wants to know if it is implemented , but he didn ' t make any express ruling that it shouldn ' t be. &quot; At this point , Byrne ' s ruling &quot; doesn ' t affect what we ' re doing , &quot; said Sean Walsh , Wilson ' s press secretary , late Wednesday afternoon . &quot; Our understanding is the drafting of emergency regulations at the departments will go forward. &quot; Walsh said it was not clear how long it will take departments and agencies in state_government to develop the regulations necessary to begin implementing the measure and whether any would be completed before Byrne ' s hearing next week . Because Proposition 187 contains a severability clause , some sections could conceivably take_effect while others were still being debated in court cases . But legal_experts say suits could tie_up portions of the measure for anywhere from two to five years . At his dramatic morning press_conference , Wilson made clear that he will do all he can to implement as much of the measure as he can -- as quickly as he can . &quot; Starting today , we insist that California be a state that can set its own priorities , &quot; said the governor , who used the illegal immigration issue as a cornerstone of his reelection campaign . In his executive order , Wilson declared that prenatal services for illegal immigrants &quot; be discontinued as soon as legally possible &quot; and that further admissions to long-term care programs be granted only to legal residents . Later , a spokeswoman for the governor explained that the state is required to give a 60-day notice before ending benefits under the Medi-Cal program . The governor added that the funds saved by terminating prenatal care be spent for such care_for legal residents of California . He estimated that about 1 # 000 working poor women a month could take_advantage of the money , which would amount to about $ 84 million a year . Long-term health_care services for illegal immigrants cost the state about $ 6 million a year for the limited number of patients usually in care . Although the ballot measure stated that illegal immigrants could no longer be served by publicly funded hospitals and health clinics , Wilson said he has the duty , as governor , to protect the health of the public . Therefore , he said , he will order all precautions be taken &quot; to deal with any threat of communicable_disease , whether through immunization or quarantine or other measures. &quot; Wilson also took pains to say that his Administration would not tolerate bigotry in the enforcement of the initiative . He ordered state agencies to prepare emergency regulations that ensure &quot; the rights of all legal residents are protected and the provisions of Proposition 187 are implemented in a manner that avoids discrimination on the basis of national origin. &quot; Finally , Wilson sent a letter to President Clinton , with whom he has repeatedly clashed over federal payments for immigration costs , asking_for his &quot; full cooperation and assistance &quot; in implementing the initiative . &quot; I trust that you will agree that the people of California , having exercised their right as voters to enact Proposition 187 , should not as a result suffer any loss of federal funds , &quot; Wilson said . Clinton made no direct comments on Proposition 187 , having been asked no questions on the topic at his post-election news_conference . Clinton_Administration officials , following a plan agreed on before Tuesday ' s vote , said they would make no immediate decision on how to act . &quot; The federal_government relationship with states will remain the same for now , &quot; an Administration official said .</TEXT>
