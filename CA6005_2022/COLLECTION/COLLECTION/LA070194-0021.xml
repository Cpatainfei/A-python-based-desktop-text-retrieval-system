   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; EDIFYING , ENTERTAINING DEATH_PENALTY DEBATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Firing Line , &quot; William F . Buckley ' s PBS podium for many years , has always taken different guises for different issues . When it tackles the knottiest issues , it takes_on the most alluring guise of all -- the group debate , when Buckley must share the podium with others . The latest of these , cheerfully titled &quot; Resolved : The Death_Penalty Is a Good Thing , &quot; shows that on TV there ' s rhetoric , and then there ' s rhetoric . Most TV-style rhetoric is pontificating . The rhetoric in this debate ' s two hours is -- or attempts to be -- rhetoric ' s original role as reasoned argument . It ' s the difference on the right , for example , between Buckley and Rush Limbaugh . But reason alone never persuaded anyone on a TV debate to change his or her mind , and that doesn ' t happen on the Bard College stage , where moderator Michael Kinsley guides the clash between teams for and against capital_punishment . Joining Buckley are Georgia Assistant Atty . Gen . Susan Boleyn , constitutional law scholar Walter Berns and former New York Mayor Ed Koch ; on the other side are ACLU Executive_Director Ira Glasser , Bard President Leon Botstein and death row prisoner defense_attorneys Bryan Stevenson and Stephen Bright . The arguments come fast and furious , almost enough to hide the fact that both sides grant key points early on . While the pro-penalty group virtually concedes that capital_punishment isn ' t a proven deterrent to crime , the anti-penalty side barely tries to dispute the moral case that society has an interest in meting out grave punishment for grave crime . Stevenson and Bright , having observed some questionable Georgia murder trials , both argue that the death_penalty disproportionately falls on black murderers of white victims more_than any other type of case . They argue -- though it doesn ' t really follow -- that until punishment is color-blind , ban the death_penalty . Berns quietly brushes this aside , saying that if racism is the problem , then clean_up the procedures , since bad procedures don ' t negate the underlying values on which punishment is based . Unfortunately for non-Georgia viewers , Bright , Stevenson and the comically stern-faced Boleyn tussle too long over Georgia cases , though Boleyn is overwhelmed by Bright ' s claims of that state ' s pattern of racism in court . More entertaining are Glasser ( sharp and suave ) , Koch ( surprisingly effective ) and Buckley ( taking a while to get his juices going ) , who aim at general ideas more_than specific cases . Everyone indulges too_much in a dizzying flurry of statistics , studies and scholarly babble , but they all finally raise the stakes of this profound social issue . * &quot; Firing Line Debate -- Resolved : The Death_Penalty Is a Good Thing &quot; airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 ; 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24 ; 1 p.m. Saturday on KPBS-TV Channel 15 .</TEXT>
