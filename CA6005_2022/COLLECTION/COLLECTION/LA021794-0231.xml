   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; HE ' S WELL ; HECKMAN HAS HEALTHY OUTLOOK AFTER SURGERY FOR LUNG TUMOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At 19 , Ryan Heckman is a changed young Olympian . No more winning-is-the-only-thing for him . &quot; I think I have a much more lighthearted respect for the Olympic Games now , &quot; he said the other day . &quot; I think it ' s easy as a young adult to get caught_up in the performance syndrome . You know , people are really nice to you when you do_well and sometimes they ' re not nice when you do poorly . Having gone_through some setbacks and almost hit rock_bottom a couple times , I ' m just here to have fun . I think that ' s the most important part of athletics. &quot; A big scare can do that to you . And Heckman had a big scare , a lung tumor &quot; the size of a sweet potato. &quot; It was discovered late in August , just as Heckman , of Steamboat Springs , Colo. , was about to start the most intensive part of his training regimen for Nordic combined , which includes both ski_jumping and cross-country_skiing . &quot; It was between my lung and my spine , &quot; Heckman said of the tumor . &quot; that ' s why we had to move so swiftly on it. &quot; The tumor turned_out to be benign , but nobody knew that until several days after he ' d had a painful biopsy . And in the meantime , Heckman , who as a 17-year-old wunderkind was known at the 1992 Albertville Games as &quot; the Speck , &quot; thought his life as an athlete might be over . In fact , he thought his life might be over . &quot; I thought the worst , &quot; he said . &quot; I thought I had cancer . I thought , ' Wow , I ' ve had such a good life until now and this is why it ' s been so good , ' cause it ' s going_to end right now. ' &quot; Heckman was stunned to learn that there was something seriously wrong . &quot; I couldn ' t get_out of bed in the morning , &quot; he said . &quot; I was having a hard_time just doing anything . Since ( the tumor ) was so close to my spine , I was putting it out_of_place and I couldn ' t move my back and it hurt to put pressure on my right side . &quot; I still trained and just took a lot of ( painkiller ) . With rigorous training you ' re always in some pain , so I didn ' t really think anything of it . I went_to a chiropractor and he adjusted me and it was way better , but then an hour later it was bad again. &quot; Then one morning he couldn ' t get_out of bed at all and finally agreed to see a doctor , who recommended a CAT scan . &quot; The doctors , when they saw it on the CAT scan , kind of took my parents aside and told them they thought it was malignant , &quot; he said . &quot; I had a biopsy done that afternoon. &quot; And after that , surgery to remove the mass . The biopsy was worse than the surgery , Heckman said . &quot; Normally you ' d be ( anesthetized ) , but I had specific breathing instructions so we would n ' t puncture the lung . So , I had to be in a CAT-scan machine and I had to breathe_in when they had to go_in with this thing . It was terrible. &quot; The removal surgery was no picnic , either . &quot; They did thorascopic surgery , &quot; he said . &quot; They go_in like they would ( for ) a knee surgery with arthroscopic instruments and they cut it out and get_it so it ' s free moving . Then they open you up , four to six inches , and actually just pull it out . But in_order to get inside your pleural_cavity , they have to break ribs and it ' s not very comfortable. &quot; So , suddenly , Heckman was trying to come_back from a serious operation , as well as an off year . &quot; After ' 92 ( in Albertville ) , we switched to the V-style ( of jumping ) and I had problems with that , &quot; he said . &quot; I always jumped with my skis out_in front of me . Making the change was tough because my skis under me were my security blanket. &quot; In his eagerness not to fall_behind , Heckman said , he ran four days after the surgery . &quot; It was a mistake , &quot; he added . &quot; It was a big setback . I wasn ' t able to train for a month after that. &quot; And during that month , Heckman took_a_look at his life . &quot; People were constantly badgering me about when my return was going_to be , ' When is the old Speck going_to be back ? ' and it all kind of caught_up to me , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s hard to grow_up in athletics , I think . You ' ll notice that in ' 92 , Toni Nieminen ( then a 16-year-old from Finland ) was absolutely the ( ski-jumping ) star , without question , and he ' s not here . Martin Hoellwarth , the Austrian ski_jumper , another star at 17 in ' 92 , he ' s not here . &quot; For a young adult to grow_up in the Olympics is a real fun way of growing_up . On the other hand , it ' s a warped sense of reality . I think that begins to catch_up to you . I think I let it catch_up_with me . But the important thing is that I didn ' t just let it happen . I took some time away from it to get_back to normal. &quot; All of which doesn ' t mean Heckman isn ' t going_to do his best here . He is , after all , having his best World Cup season . He ' s just planning to enjoy the Olympics a little more this time around .</TEXT>
