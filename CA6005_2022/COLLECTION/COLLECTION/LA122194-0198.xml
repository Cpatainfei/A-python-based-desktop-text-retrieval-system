   <HEADLINE> PUC TO UNVEIL PHONE DEREGULATION PLANS ; TELECOM : REGULATORS WILL TRY TO ESTABLISH GROUND_RULES FOR THE ENTRY OF NEW PLAYERS IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Opening local telephone markets to competition might sound good to consumers , but what if it means that you can ' t keep your phone_number ? Or that you can ' t get your number listed in a phone_book ? A year has passed since the California Public_Utilities Commission proposed allowing unbridled competition in the state ' s telephone markets by 1997 . Yet basic issues such_as number portability and phone_book listings have yet to be decided . Today , the PUC is expected to unveil the first details of how deregulation of the state ' s phone industry should be accomplished . The commissioners will try to establish ground_rules for the entry of new rivals -- cable and long-distance companies , for example -- into local telecommunications markets , traditionally the province of monopolies such_as Pacific Bell and General Telephone of California . The commissioners will also suggest a timetable for dealing with issues such_as how to redefine basic telephone_service , how to continue to fund service for low-income and elderly customers and how to ensure that phone-company competitors have the interconnections they will need to make their offerings attractive . At best , many industry observers noted Tuesday , companies and consumers face a rocky , confusing transition . But the payoff could be enormous -- and California lags far behind other states in modernizing its local-telephone rules . &quot; We think that the course the PUC charts over the next two years is really going_to determine the future of telecommunications for Californians , &quot; said Regina Costa , telecommunications analyst with Toward Utility Rate Normalization , a consumer watchdog group in San Francisco . &quot; They can create a situation where people really do have a lot of choices and better services , or they can create a situation where people will be subjected_to the worst kind of abuse and be forced to pay_for services they don ' t really want. &quot; A chief goal of deregulation , the PUC said last December , is to spur private-sector development of new telecommunications services , with the presumption that innovative products will stimulate demand and create thousands of jobs . In theory , customers would benefit not only from those services , but also from price_competition . ( Similarly , after Jan . 1 , consumers will be able to choose among various service providers on local toll_calls , a market recently opened_to competition after having been a local-phone-company monopoly. ) The PUC ' s proposal last year drew a mostly enthusiastic response from local telephone_companies , long-distance providers , cable operators and consumer watchdogs . But many observers noted at the time that the five-person agency would have to take_on the role of determined traffic_cop and gatekeeper to ensure that service providers stay in_line . Since then , concerns have mounted among would-be rivals and consumer groups that the PUC might not take a firm enough stance in_forcing the existing local phone monopolies to hew to a schedule and be fair to competitors . Commissioner Norman D . Shumway has proposed that , on some key issues such_as pricing and number portability , Pacific Bell and GTE should spearhead an effort to involve all interested parties in a settlement . That suits Pacific Bell just fine . &quot; Why not put us all_in a room and let us negotiate ? &quot; said John A . Gueldner , the company ' s vice_president of regulatory affairs . &quot; We feel a settlement approach would get_it done even sooner ( than 1997 ) . &quot;</TEXT>
