   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; KILLINGS BRING PRESSURE ON MEXICO ' S POLITICAL SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The second major political assassination in six months raised questions Thursday about the continuing effectiveness of the system that has kept this nation stable for six decades . At the least , the virtual one-party system -- which Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa has called &quot; a perfect dictatorship &quot; -- seemed less so as federal police investigated the killing of yet another prominent figure . The weapon used to murder Francisco Ruiz Massieu -- the second-ranking official in the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , which has ruled this country for 65 years -- has been traced to a community in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas , law_enforcement sources said Thursday . With the help of U.S. authorities , investigators have determined that the Intratec 9-millimeter handgun , a model known as a &quot; Tec 9 , &quot; was purchased in the unnamed border city , sources said . But it not immediately clear who made the purchase and when . As the investigation continued , Mexicans mourned and confronted doubts about their political_system , public safety and the seeming impunity of drug dealers as they conducted funeral services for Ruiz Massieu . Coming just six months after the assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , Ruiz Massieu ' s murder heightens worries that Mexico could be returning to the days of political violence that this nation endured in the 1920s , which led to the formation of the PRI as a peaceful way to broker power struggles . Ruiz Massieu was fatally shot Wednesday morning in front of a downtown hotel as he left a breakfast for his party ' s recently elected federal deputies . His body lay_in state at party headquarters Wednesday evening , later being moved to a funeral_home in the south of the capital , where a small group of mourners gathered Thursday morning , until he was taken_to the Spanish Cemetery for cremation . Citizens paying tribute to the politician got_into a shouting match as they reviewed the events that have shaken their country this year . &quot; The person who pulled the trigger did not do this on_his_own ; there was somebody behind him , &quot; said Maria Concepcion Moguel , 60 , a retired government employee . Juan Manuel Zavala Sanchez , 50 , an engineer , answered sharply , &quot; You do not know that. &quot; &quot; that ' s my opinion , &quot; she snapped back . &quot; And what about Colosio ? &quot; shouted another voice from the crowd , weaving an elaborate conspiracy theory . &quot; Do you know when this is going_to be solved ? &quot; &quot; Never , &quot; responded Moguel . &quot; It ' s the PRI , the system itself . They are killing each other. &quot; &quot; They are trying to blame it on drug dealers , &quot; said one man , who would not give his name . &quot; Who is going_to believe that ? &quot; But U.S. law_enforcement sources said they find plausible the scenario that drug_traffickers had killed Ruiz Massieu to send a message to his brother , Deputy Atty . Gen . Mario Ruiz Massieu . &quot; It ' s a good theory , &quot; a U.S. official said . &quot; But that ' s all it is -- a theory . Mario Ruiz has been_active in directing ( anti-drug ) operations and providing manpower to go_after the cartels. &quot; Any of Mexico ' s top drug cartels could have been involved in the murder , the official said . Mario Ruiz Massieu also had visibly stepped_up efforts to capture Benjamin , Javier and Ramon Arellano , the drug lords believed to have masterminded a Guadalajara airport shootout last year . Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo was killed in that incident . The Arellano brothers have recently been identified as suspects in the murder earlier this year of Tijuana Police_Chief Jose Federico Benitez . Last week , a special team of more_than 150 federal police agents swooped into Baja California to press the hunt for the fugitive Arellanos , leaders of the Tijuana cartel . The raids resulted in 15 arrests , including a cartel lieutenant and a former chief homicide detective of the Baja state police ; the detective is accused of helping Ramon Arellano escape a March shootout between corrupt state officers and federal_agents . The Arellanos are considered particularly violence-prone and are influential enough to have eluded capture with the help of a protective network of corrupt officials . The simultaneously brazen and bumbling style of the Ruiz Massieu assassination , in which the gunman ' s weapon -- capable of either fully automatic or semiautomatic fire -- jammed after firing a single bullet , resembles previous incidents involving Arellano hit_men . But U.S. law_enforcement officials familiar_with Mexican cartels were reluctant to speculate whether the Arellanos or other kingpins would choose to strike back at law_enforcement by killing a political figure . The possible involvement of drug dealers , though , gives renewed credence to concerns about an alliance between narcotics cartels and some political factions . Eduardo Valle , a former high-ranking official in the attorney_general ' s office , has asserted that those groups have teamed_up to turn Mexico into a &quot; narco-democracy. &quot; Mexico ' s beleaguered police seem unable to prevent the violence or to solve high-profile crimes , such_as the Colosio and Posadas Ocampo assassinations or a rash of kidnapings of wealthy businessmen . Concern about violence was an important issue in last month ' s presidential election , which Colosio ' s successor , Ernesto Zedillo , won on a campaign that emphasized peace and stability . Reform of the judicial_system , from police to the courts , was an important plank in his platform . Lack of public confidence in law_enforcement ' s ability to solve crimes was evidenced by the fact that once again questions are being raised , hours after his arrest at the scene , about the identity of the person accused of the murder . On Thursday , two local newspaper reports cast doubt that the suspect held by police in Ruiz Massieu ' s murder is Hector or Joel Resendiz from the victim ' s hometown of Acapulco . The government-owned El Nacional quoted Federal Judicial Police sources as identifying the man in custody as Daniel Aguilar Trevino from the northern state of Tamaulipas , where authorities on Wednesday conducted sweeps against the &quot; Gulf &quot; drug cartel . He allegedly told authorities that two men paid him the equivalent of $ 17 # 000 to commit the murder . In Acapulco , neighbors of the Resendiz Gutierrez family told the newspaper Reforma that the man photographed at the crime scene is not the man they know as Hector or Joel Resendiz . Officials in the attorney_general ' s office said they will not comment on the stories until late Thursday or release the suspect ' s second last_name , which is often crucial to establishing identity . The confusion is reminiscent_of the controversy that arose after Colosio ' s assassination in Tijuana on March 23 . &quot; The seed of instability has been planted in the country , &quot; Moguel said . &quot; Now besides the hunger we have in this country , there is also fear. &quot; Darling reported from Mexico_City and Rotella from San Diego .
