   <TEXT> Why are so many teen-agers having_sex ? The question seems to come_up time and time again . &quot; It ' s mainly peer pressure , &quot; said Fullerton High_School sophomore Brandon Jette . The cases of sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancies among teens in the county have been increasing . In 1992 , there were 4 # 781 births to teen mothers and nearly 1 # 200 cases of STDs recorded among those 10 to 19 , according to the County of Orange Health_Care Agency . Statistics give only part of the answer . There is confusion among teen-agers in making decisions about sex . So what should a teen do ? Although there is no definitive answer , Jette offered this assessment : &quot; Stop necessitating the need to do_it just to be accepted. &quot; Many psychologists say the growth in the number of sexually transmitted diseases might deter the practice of multiple partners . Also entering the debate is whether sex education should be taught at_home or in school . Fullerton High senior William Ovando said , &quot; It ' s got_to begin at_home , because it ' s more personal , and who knows you better than your parents ? &quot; However , another senior said , &quot; It should start at school because many parents don ' t know much about sex and are uncomfortable talking_about it with their children. &quot; Despite the differences_of_opinion , most say sex education is important because of the sexual_activity and its risks . One of the biggest risks is teen-age pregnancy . A Fullerton High_School graduate who became pregnant while still in school said : &quot; I was really scared and confused , and I didn ' t know what to do . My life changed dramatically , and my dreams were broken . It was the worst experience of my life. &quot; If they found themselves pregnant , a majority of Fullerton High_School female students interviewed said that they would have an abortion . &quot; I would have an abortion because I would n ' t give_birth to a child I couldn ' t take_care of , &quot; said a senior . Most male students said they didn ' t know what they would do . &quot; I would face_up to the consequences of my actions and do everything in my capacity to help raise the child , &quot; a male junior said . Practicing abstinence is one method to prevent pregnancy and avoid sexually transmitted disease . However , a recent survey of 276 Fullerton High students showed that 63 % felt it was acceptable to have_sex before marriage . Although birth_control_pills are very effective as a contraceptive , they cannot protect someone from contracting an STD . &quot; A latex condom , only if it is used properly , is one of the best ways to do so , &quot; said a UCI medical_student who recently presented a program on AIDS at Fullerton High_School . Because of this , many suggest that condoms should be distributed in schools . &quot; Condoms should be available in schools because teen-agers are going_to ( have_sex ) anyway , and a lot of teens aren ' t responsible enough to go_out and buy protection for themselves , mostly because they ' re embarrassed , &quot; he said . Fullerton High counselor Tammy Messineo said , &quot; Both people need to be responsible and willing to accept the consequences for their behavior . Safe_sex is important. &quot;</TEXT>
