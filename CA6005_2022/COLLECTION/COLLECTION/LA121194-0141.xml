   <HEADLINE> CAN U.N. BE GIVEN TEETH SHARP ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE ? ; AS STATES DISINTEGRATE , WASHINGTON MIGHT FIND ITSELF WITH FEWER PROBLEMS IF IT SUPPORTED AN INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION FORCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard Falk of Princeton calls them the &quot; black_holes of geopolitics. &quot; To others they are simply failed states , countries whose governments have become powerless or ceased to exist , countries collapsing in on themselves as ethnic , religious or tribal hatreds and fears surge over the tenuous structure of multiethnic community life . These are states experiencing or threatened with a reversion to barbarism that mocks the dream of a world where the rule_of_law prevails . Somalia , Rwanda and Bosnia , victims of frightful and even genocidal civil strife , are the most prominent examples of failed states . Haiti provides a different kind of textbook case . There , for the better part of two centuries , an indigenous rapacious political class has thwarted progress while using terror to condemn the mass of people to chronic economic misery . ETHNIC FRICTION IS BUT ONE BREEDER OF VIOLENCE But there are other potential members of this tragic club . By one estimate fully 40 % of the world ' s countries count five or more sizable ethnic minorities among their populations . Most of these are states whose boundaries were drawn_in the latter half of the 19th Century by expanding colonial powers or those carved out of the carcasses of defeated empires in the first part of this century , without reference_to the interests or the historical grievances of their inhabitants . Heterogeneity does not , of course , make civil strife inevitable , any more_than homogeneity -- witness Haiti -- assures domestic tranquillity . But it is a major component . Add economic_crisis , selective and unforgiving historical memories and active political demagoguery -- all_of which exist in abundance in crucial parts of the world -- and the stage is set for unrestrained conflict . States whose disparate populations are unable to reconcile their differences can , of course , separate politically and territorially without collapsing . British India divided at independence into mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan , though not without suffering a terrible toll during the accompanying mass population transfers . More recently Czechoslovakia , one of a number of states to emerge out of the dissolved Austro-Hungarian monarchy in the aftermath of World_War I , chose to split peacefully into two independent republics . But Czechoslovakia represents more of an anomaly than a model . It is hard to conceive_of the feuding and sometimes closely intermixed populations of the states of the former Soviet_Union or of sub-Saharan Africa , those in that &quot; zone of conflict &quot; where internal strife is most likely to occur , agreeing to peacefully put aside their suspicions and hatreds or suppress their often-ancient cultural differences . The ugly fact confronting the world now is that the end of the Cold_War has allowed the re-emergence of a narrow , exclusionary nationalism that demagogues in much of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet_Union have been eagerly encouraging . Simultaneously it is all too clear that longstanding ethnic , tribal or religious rivalries in much of Africa could explode in horrifying conflict at any time . The terrible suffering and political instability that are characteristic of collapsing states are not going_to disappear . What , if anything , can international efforts do to prevent other states from collapsing or , absent that , to alleviate the brutal and tragic human consequences of their failure ? GRIM FAILURES IN SOMALIA , BOSNIA AND RWANDA Experience so far is anything but encouraging . Somalia , despite a $ 1.5-billion humanitarian rescue operation , appears even with 15 # 000 U.N. troops still in the country to have reverted to predatory clan warfare . Limited military &quot; peacekeeping &quot; operations in Bosnia under U.N. auspices have failed to stop the killing or deter Serbian territorial expansionism . In Rwanda quick and probably low-risk outside intervention mobilized by the United Nations or even undertaken multilaterally without official U.N. blessing almost surely could have prevented much of the slaughter of the Tutsi minority , which continued for months . But there was little stomach either in Africa or elsewhere for interposing a military shield between the Tutsis and their Hutu tormentors , so there was no organized lifesaving effort of sufficient scale . Sir Brian Urquhart , former undersecretary general for special political affairs at the United Nations , likens dilatory U.N. actions when life-consuming crises erupt to a policeman getting_to the scene of a crime weeks after it was committed . In these circumstances , he asks , how can the institution retain any public credibility ? The Bosnia debacle gives added point to the question . A fundamental part of the problem is of course institutional . The United Nations can act only when the Security_Council authorizes it to do so , meaning only when there is a consensus among its five permanent , veto-empowered members . But even then the Security_Council can only authorize ; individual members must respond by voluntarily providing the actual military_forces for intervening . Right now there are about 70 # 000 U.N. peacekeepers in the field . They have no trouble keeping the peace where the parties they stand between want the peace kept , as on Cyprus or the Golan Heights . But they cannot keep the peace where one or another belligerent would rather fight , as in Bosnia , nor can they make_peace when -- again as in Bosnia -- the mandate under which they operate requires an impartiality that renders them all but impotent . Urquhart ' s proposed way around at least part of this problem is for the United Nations to have its own troops , a small , all-volunteer standing force with the ability to move quickly to deal with low-level political violence . Such a rapid deployment force ( RDF ) would constitute only an initial presence , a fire_brigade that would serve as an earnest of international intentions . By its ability to intervene fast , it would eliminate that &quot; sickening pause &quot; that typically occurs between the time the Security_Council authorizes military intervention and the actual arrival of troops in the area of conflict . Yale historian Paul Kennedy supports a U.N. RDF , noting among other reasons that in the absence of such a mechanism for intervening &quot; everyone will ( continue to ) look_to the United States for leadership , &quot; laying a moral and political responsibility on this country that in fact must be shared by the international community . Political scientist Richard Falk agrees , observing that a U.N. RDF &quot; would actually help reduce U.S. involvement in regional crises while also responding to the ' CNN factor ' -- the tendency of the public to agitate for action after viewing televised human disaster. &quot; PROBLEM OF ' IMPARTIAL ' ARMED INTERVENTION The notion , though , has its cogent critics . Michael Mandelbaum , professor of foreign_policy at Johns Hopkins , notes that the conduct of military operations is strictly the business of sovereign states , and &quot; sovereignty can ' t be transferred by fiat to an international organization. &quot; Richard K . Betts of Columbia , writing in Foreign Affairs , argues forcefully that U.N. military operations -- whether as currently conducted or employing a RDF -- will fail to arrest conflicts so_long as their mandate is to remain evenhanded and not take sides to help shape the outcome . Impartiality works only when two sides are ready to stop fighting . Otherwise it only helps the stronger and more aggressive party . In Bosnia , &quot; the West ' s attempt at limited but impartial involvement abetted slow-motion savagery. &quot; The fear -- indeed , the high probability -- of more savagery yet to come_in volatile parts of the world demands hard thinking about what can be done to prevent or mitigate such calamities . Yale ' s Paul Kennedy fears that Nigeria , Africa ' s most populous country , could fall_apart within the next six months . He further points to Algeria , where success of the Islamic fundamentalist rebellion could jeopardize the more secularized middle-class Muslim population . Worldwide , 50 million people have been displaced by the internal conflicts of recent years . Millions more may soon be threatened . THE MOST BASIC QUESTION : JUST WHO WOULD DECIDE ? There are manifold practical problems with the notion of developing a standing U.N. interventionary force : How large would it be and how would its members be recruited ? Where would it be based , what transport and logistics provisions would be made_for it ? How would it be paid_for , who would give it orders , what would happen if it needed reinforcing ? Perhaps trickiest of all is the most basic challenge : How would it be decided where a U.N. force could be used most effectively ? Plainly the number of possible crises in the world at any given moment that might call_for intervention could exceed the capabilities of a U.N. rapid deployment force to intervene . How then would the hard choice of where to put possibly lifesaving resources be made ? And by whom ? These are difficult questions that have to be carefully addressed before a U.N. force could become a reality . The world continues to look_to the United States for leadership . Washington therefore should take the lead at the United Nations in directing thinking toward experimenting with an international RDF -- and in offering logistics support for its missions . That such a force will not lack for future employment seems sadly , grimly all too certain . Next week : Market forces changing the world order .</TEXT>
