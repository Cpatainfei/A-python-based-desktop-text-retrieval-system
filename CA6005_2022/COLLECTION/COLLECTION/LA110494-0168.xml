   <HEADLINE> U.S. SENATE ; HUFFINGTON AD CITES PARTS OF NEWS_STORY IN ASSAILING FOE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A full-page ad placed in today ' s editions of the Los Angeles Times by Republican Mike Huffington ' s Senate_campaign quotes passages and cites information from a Times story about Sen . Dianne Feinstein ' s handling of potential conflicts related to her personal and political finances . The political advertisement quotes or makes reference_to several paragraphs of the nearly 3 # 000-word Times story that ran Oct . 28 . But some of the quotes and references in the ad are incomplete , and , in one case , it does not cite other facts in the story indicating that Feinstein ' s actions did not violate any rules . Citing the story , the ad points_out that two longtime clients and friends of Feinstein ' s husband , merchant banker Richard C . Blum , have connections to a San Francisco firm , Catellus Corp . The ad says Feinstein ' s original Desert Protection Act would have given Catellus special allowances to swap its 366 # 000 acres of desert land for other government surplus property . What the ad does not say is that after Republicans objected to the Catellus provision , the Senate Natural_Resources committee pulled it from the bill . The measure , without the Catellus provision , was later signed into law . Huffington ' s campaign has already cited the Catellus matter in television commercials as an example of Feinstein ' s going_to bat for special_interests . Feinstein said she took the provision directly from the House of Representatives ' version of the legislation and did not support it , although the provision stayed in the bill through more_than 50 revisions she made . The ad also quotes The Times ' passage that on May 25 , &quot; in a speech delivered on the Senate floor , Feinstein urges Clinton to increase favorable trade relations with China at_the_same_time Blum is planning to invest up_to $ 150 million there . . . . &quot; The ad does not include the five words at the end of the sentence , &quot; on behalf of several clients. &quot; Blum has said he would put $ 2 million to $ 5 million of_his_own money into the investment . Similarly , the ad quotes the story as saying &quot; ( Feinstein ) voted for appropriations_bills that provided more_than $ 100 million a year in federal funds to three companies in which her husband is a substantial investor. &quot; The story also noted that under Senate rules , Feinstein may vote on bills that affect her husband ' s finances so_long as the legislation is not designed to specifically benefit Blum or his investments . The ad did not mention that in some cases Feinstein has taken actions that adversely affected her husband ' s myriad investments in everything from cable_television and an airline to container products . Feinstein has released the couple ' s tax_returns back to their 1980 marriage , and has challenged Huffington to do the same . Blum released his client list in 1990 but has declined to release his corporate returns until Huffington makes his tax records available .</TEXT>
