   <TEXT> Compulsive , narcissistic , brilliant and episodically mad , Nikola Tesla arrived in New York in 1884 at the age of 28 , ready to electrify the world . Certainly a great inventor , Tesla , like many of his contemporaries , was psychologically enmeshed in the mystique of electricity . Having figured_out that alternating current ( AC ) is more efficient than the direct_current ( DC ) Thomas Alva Edison favored , Tesla convinced George Westinghouse of the advantages of his approach . Westinghouse went AC when he built the first major hydroelectric plant at Niagara Falls . Tesla continued to dream of and patent things electric . He was an impresario of electricity , as his high-frequency &quot; Tesla_Coil &quot; ( made famous by the Frankenstein films ) attests . Tesla ' s family included his father , a member of the clergy , and a brilliant brother six years his senior , who died in an accident at the age of 11 . That tragedy , says Tad Wise , author of the fictional biography &quot; Tesla , &quot; shaped Tesla ' s life . Blaming himself for his brother ' s death , Tesla eventually left home for the university , left his church for home-brewed mysticism , and left Serbia for the United States . His American career spanned six decades , mostly spent in New York . Wise ' s descriptions of that city , especially in the gilded age , are the best parts of this very uneven book . Soon after his arrival , Tesla managed to meet , and briefly work for , Edison . He went_on to have business_deals with Westinghouse and J.P. Morgan , and to befriend Samuel Clemens ( a.k.a. Mark Twain ) . Tesla prospered , at first in the economic free-for-all at the end of the 19th Century . During his roller-coaster career he was a victim of both chance and his stubborn , idiosyncratic and enigmatic character . He made and lost fortunes , lived and dined_in hotels from the Waldorf Astoria to nameless flea traps , all_the while retaining a clique of devoted and wealthy friends . He also collected enemies . His list begins with Edison and includes Guglielmo Marconi , who thought he could send messages through the air without wires and , of course , succeeded . Wise blames these foes , as well as society , for refusing to credit Tesla for the invention of , among other things , the science of robotics and X-rays . What Tesla did not actually invent , according to Wise , he predicted . His prophesies include sonar , anti-missile systems , television and CNN . These were excellent forecasts , but not unique to Tesla . Another prophet at the time was H.G. Wells . Tesla was a giant , literally -- he loomed well_over six feet -- and figuratively -- he dreamed of domesticating the electrical_power of the universe . In his private life he remained celibate , loathe to so_much as touch another human_being . He had no love life , although he liked to have beautiful women around him . This much is fact . Wise , however , decided to tell Tesla ' s story as fiction , gaining a free hand to embroider the only non-technical part of Tesla ' s life of any interest -- his eccentricities and hallucinations . Wise provides psychological explanations for some and a paranormal gloss for others . The lines between what is documented and what are from Wise ' s imagination are hard to draw . that ' s the trouble with fictionalized biography . Wise the novelist never stands_back from his against-the-wall defense of his strange hero . Although Tesla ' s manic genius left no room for self-doubt , Wise the novelist could have been more critical . For the record , Tesla did not discover X-rays . Like others who were experimenting with electricity , he accidentally took an X-ray_picture , but was unaware of what he had done . As for the Nobel Prize of 1915 , which was said to have originally been destined to be split between Edison and Tesla but went instead to William H . and William L . Bragg , there is nothing mysterious about it . Rumors are common in Nobel-land . Had Wise wanted to find_out whether the Nobel Prize Committee had ever considered the American inventors , he simply could have consulted the minutes of those meetings . What Wise has failed to do , as biographer or novelist , is explain how Nikola Tesla reflected the spirit of his age . His genius for electrical inventions , for instance , was a perfect fit for a continent in the throes of urbanization . And Tesla ' s approach , bizarre to_the_point of demented , could be tolerated in the age of rampant individualism . In the book ' s epilogue , Wise lists materials that have become available to researchers ; he recuses himself from exploring them , however , on the grounds that this is not the novelist ' s job . Instead , he berates &quot; scientists and historians &quot; for having shirked their duty . Frankly , this fictional biography would have been a fine venue for a survey of those new materials . Without it , Wise adds only a weak &quot; gee whiz &quot; to what is already known about this strange and brilliant figure .</TEXT>
