   <HEADLINE> COMMERCE , NOT ART , THE GAME AT SUNDANCE ; BUT DESPITE ALL THE SALES TALK , IT ' S STILL THE TOP U.S. FILM FEST FOR INDEPENDENTS , SHORTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steven Soderberg , whose &quot; sex , lies , &amp; videotape &quot; was the toast of the 1989 Sundance Film Festival , is sitting in a corner of a typically overpacked party , grumbling about the &quot; encroachment of commerce &quot; eclipsing art at this important annual showcase for independent movies . After flying in from his home_in Virginia to help promote &quot; Suture , &quot; which he executive-produced , at this year ' s festival , Soderberg takes a sip of beer and observes , at the risk of sounding arrogant : &quot; Since 1989 , it ' s never been the same. &quot; At that time , when he emerged as one of the hottest young filmmakers around , Sundance &quot; wasn ' t overrun by agents -- it hadn ' t become a deal market , a sales place , &quot; Soderberg says . The shift , he says , came_in 1990 when &quot; suddenly this festival became this feeding frenzy , and it was no longer about art. &quot; &quot; Sex , lies , &quot; made on a budget of $ 1.2 million , was the first breakout hit discovered at Sundance , grossing $ 25 million . &quot; that ' s when everyone started taking this festival so seriously , &quot; agrees Fine Line Pictures President Ira Deutchman over lunch at one of Hollywood ' s favorite ski hangouts , the posh Stein Eriksen Lodge_in neighboring Deer Valley . &quot; The next year it was inundated with agents and studio executives. &quot; Deal makers traditionally descend on this picturesque mountain town during the second_half of the 10-day January festival , their cellular_phones popping_up like mushrooms in the night . Competition for talent and films is so fierce that many contracts are signed weeks , even months , before Sundance begins . Business and schmoozing spill onto the streets , the ski slopes and into restaurants . Not everyone is dismayed by that . Many filmmakers covet the attention they receive from Hollywood , foreign buyers and the national press , because it increases the likelihood of landing an agreement to get their movie into the marketplace . Just about anyone you ask here says the festival , run_by Robert Redford ' s Sundance Institute , is still the premier American film festival for independent features , documentaries and shorts . Beth Swofford of the William Morris Agency , who signed two young filmmakers -- Matty Rich ( &quot; Straight Out of Brooklyn &quot; ) and Richard Linklater ( &quot; Slackers &quot; ) -- out of the festival three years ago , says agents track projects far in_advance of Sundance and often sign talent at the script stage . One agent left 2 1 / 2 days early this year &quot; because 90 % -95 % of the people that made movies here were already signed . . . . If you haven ' t seen the films before the festival , I ' d say the ship has sailed by the time you get there. &quot; The same holds for distributors looking_for new movies to release . &quot; It ' s much more competitive for those few films that distributors recognize have the right elements like the right marketing hook , &quot; says Howard Cohen , head of acquisitions for the Samuel Goldwyn Co. , which picked_up the popular , edgy lesbian movie &quot; Go_Fish &quot; early in the festival . * For all_the intense deal making and schmoozing , however , Sundance also remains a haven for its original following of Hollywood wanna-bes , art-house intellectuals and plain old moviegoers -- more_than 6 # 000 of them this year . It ' s not unusual during the festival to overhear participants dissecting dolly shots , decrying commercialization of art or sharing production financing headaches inside Z Place , the perpetually buzzing festival headquarters . The conversations persist inside shuttle_buses , where one driver had to break_up a violent argument between two passengers over the merits of film violence . Routine conversation is difficult at festival parties , which are so crowded that people can barely breathe or move , let alone speak . Even though the parties -- largely hosted by film companies and agents and often held_in exclusive condominiums -- are by invitation , gate crashing is common . Get-togethers take_on a frat party-like atmosphere , as lines of young people stream up from restaurants and screenings to mingle into the morning hours . One of this year ' s hot tickets was the Disney Channel ' s Tuesday-night bash for &quot; The Who ' s ' Tommy ' : The Amazing Journey , &quot; a documentary on the history of the rock opera . The party , held_in a small condo , became so crowded that some people left early , fearing the wooden outdoor deck would collapse . The next night , the two places to be were Deer Valley parties hosted by the Samuel Goldwyn Co . and the William Morris Agency / 20th Century Fox . A caravan of Ford Explorers -- the rental car of choice here -- steadily made their way up_to the mountainside bashes in the face of a heavy snowfall . Miramax Films , which is distributing &quot; Sirens , &quot; hosted a classy sit-down dinner at one of the festival ' s most popular restaurants , the Riverhorse Cafe , where journalists hobnobbed with &quot; Sirens &quot; stars Hugh Grant and Elle MacPherson and director-screenwriter John Duigan . A Sony Classics / HBO-sponsored party with live music by Los Lobos evolved into a mob scene so intense that even an unhappy Danny DeVito reportedly couldn ' t get_in . Publicity stunts are rare at Sundance . But one creative exception was a trail ride orchestrated by Clein + White to promote Arthur Elgort ' s &quot; Colorado Cowboy : The Bruce Ford Story , &quot; about a renowned rodeo champion . ( On Saturday night , the film won the festival ' s award for best cinematography for a documentary. ) Reporters followed Ford on horseback down a snowy and muddy trail through the scenic countryside outside Park City . Director Elgort , a former fashion photographer , revealed that he had never been_on a horse , but said , &quot; I don ' t play the violin either , but someday I ' d like to make a documentary about violinists. &quot; While people at Sundance are supposed to be above star-gazing , there was still plenty of buzz about which actors were spotted on crowded Main_Street . Heavily clothed , but still-recognizable celebrities included Winona Ryder , Joan Chen , Tim Robbins , Eric Stoltz , Ethan Hawke , Fred Ward , Rob Morrow , Julie Delpy , MacPherson , Jeanne Tripplehorn , Mary Stuart Masterson , Matthew Modine ( who has a short here and is_on the jury ) , Andie MacDowell and Gena Rowlands , who was honored for her work in independent films . Despite the frenzied nature of many events , there was little complaining . &quot; It ' s a chance to hobnob with my fellow film wizards . I get much more done here than at the office , &quot; says Paul Colichman , president of IRS Media . Added David Guc of the Gersh Agency ' s New York office : &quot; Here , you ' re introduced to people on a much more informal basis . You can make a deal with someone just because he likes your skiing . It ' s a ski-schmooze-a-thon. &quot; Some movie executives , such_as Triton Pictures ' owner Jonathan Dana , here on vacation , choose to come simply to get_away from the grind of everyday Hollywood life . This year , Sundance was a particularly idyllic retreat for the earthquake-traumatized attendees from Los Angeles . As the festival drew to an end during the weekend , more_than one Angeleno could be overheard saying wistfully , &quot; I don ' t want to go home. &quot;</TEXT>
