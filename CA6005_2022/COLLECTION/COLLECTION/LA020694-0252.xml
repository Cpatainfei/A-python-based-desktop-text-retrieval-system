   <HEADLINE> HISTORY IN THE MAKING ; BASQUE COMPILES HIS CULTURE ' S CONTRIBUTIONS TO SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Visitors to San Juan Capistrano a century ago could be forgiven for thinking they had somehow been transported to Mediterranean Europe : Here was the identical seaside climate , the same fragrant , hilly landscape . That dust spiraling above the center of town was from hundreds of sheep being herded down Camino Capistrano , then a dirt road . And tending the sheep , looking as if they were straight out of the West Pyrenees , were Basques . A people of obscure origin who inhabit the mountainous border region of western France and Spain , Basques were prominent among the early settlers of San Juan Capistrano , having been lured by opportunities to invest their money and ancient skills in ranching and farming . Today , their descendants are among the oldest residents of the city . San Juan , as Orange County cities go , has a rich history , and at least one local Basque , Jean Lacouague , fears that his culture ' s contributions have been lost in the shuffle of historical attention that tends to revolve_around the Mission , the Aghachamem Indians and white land barons . Since October , Lacouague , 70 , has been compiling narrative histories of a dozen or so Basque families who lived and worked in San Juan and the immediate area . He plans to donate the completed project to the San Juan Capistrano Historical Society . &quot; The Basques were a significant bunch of landowners and provided work and contributions to the economy , &quot; said Lacouague , on a break from an equipment repair project on his five-acre farm near San Juan Creek . &quot; I got_to thinking , hell , the Forsters have their history plastered all_over town ; the Indians have their history recorded , but there ' s nothing written_about the Basques . Nobody knows a damn thing about it. &quot; Many of the Basque immigrants , Lacouague says , were sent_for in Europe by successful Basques already living here . Lacouague ' s father , Pierre , immigrated to San Juan from Ainhoa , France , in 1910 , to work as a farmhand . Others came_by way of Latin_America , Nevada or California ' s Central Valley . Many learned English while working as shepherds , citrus farmers and hotel maids . Basque ranchers and farmers at one time were the largest seasonal employers in San Juan Capistrano , according to historian Pamela Hallan-Gibson . After the Civil War , the sheep industry boomed because of a shortage of wool , and the Orange County climate proved perfect for raising sheep . &quot; The most prominent Basques were the Oyharzabal family , &quot; Hallan-Gibson said . &quot; They came early , in 1878 , were big property_owners , and ( their descendants ) still live_in downtown San Juan. &quot; In the 1890s , Domingo Oyharzabal , from the Basses-Pyrenees , France , owned 4 # 000 acres and , along with fellow Basques Cornelio Echenique and Jean Daguerre , employed Basque sheepherders on property that is now Leisure World Laguna Hills . &quot; The major sheep area was where Marco F . Forster Junior_High is now , &quot; Hallan-Gibson said . &quot; The business was so big the local guys couldn ' t handle it , and Basques from the Temecula and Pala area would come_in on a seasonal basis . They would run the sheep right through San Juan Capistrano , down Del Obispo . . . to the sheep shearing grounds beyond Del Avion. &quot; In 1880 , Oyharzabal began to accumulate real_estate with another Basque , Juan Salaberri , in and around downtown San Juan Capistrano . They bought the 1840s-era Miguel Garcia and Domingo Yorba adobes , which still stand side_by_side on Camino Capistrano and are_on the National Register of Historic Places . The two-story Garcia adobe served as the_French Hotel until 1903 and as a general_store until 1918 , according to Oyharzabal family documents . Eugenie Oyharzabal , the widow of Domingo ' s nephew Esteban , has lived_in the Yorba adobe since arriving as a bride from St . Jean Le Vieux , Spain , in 1924 . Eugenie , 103 , spends much of her days knitting and reading her French-language prayer_book , according to her daughter Carmen , 67 . The Oyharzabals , who speak Basque , Spanish , French or English to each other , still own the adobes and collect rent from the merchants in the Garcia adobe . Although Carmen appreciates the controlled-growth development policies of the city , she fondly recalls the days before the early 1970s when there were just 1 # 400 families in San Juan Capistrano . &quot; We knew practically everybody then , and now there are 25 # 000 people , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve always lived_in this house , &quot; she said . &quot; When I was growing_up , we used to sit on the porch and watch the traffic on Camino Capistrano , which was the main route then &quot; between Los Angeles and San Diego . Changes in the Basque community have been subtle but absolute . There is , of course , far less ranching and farming , and fewer young people are learning to speak the Basque language . For decades , Carmen Oyharzabal and her friends played a Basque card_game called mus every Saturday night . But the longstanding games stopped three years ago because her mother no longer cared to be the fourth player , Carmen says , and the younger-generation Basques showed no interest in learning the game . * &quot; The Oyharzabals were the biggest single employer in San Juan at one time , &quot; said Lacouague , who is using the Oyharzabals ' old payroll lists of ranch , hotel and store employees to pin_down names and dates for his history project . &quot; They ran a boarding house , had a water district and supplied water to the town initially , ( then ) hooked_up different houses. &quot; With his wife , Marie , who is also Basque , and two of his children , Lacouague lives on the same property where he was born . Letter_carriers have little excuse for misdirected mail : The Lacouagues live_on Camino Lacouague . The Lacouague Ranch is believed by some historians to be the site of both an Aghachamem village and the Franciscan mission before it was moved to its permanent site downtown . The property is part of an orange and walnut farm bought by Pierre Lacouague from his employer , Cornelio Echenique , who along with Frank and John Forster was one of the largest landowners in the early 1900s . The Echenique home was_on land that is now Four Oaks Park . Like the Oyharzabals , the Lacouagues have left an imprint on the city they ' ve called home for most of the 20th Century . A senior_citizens ' recreation building in San Juan Capistrano is named for Jean Lacouague , and he served as chief of the city ' s volunteer fire_department until 1982 , when his son , Dan , took_over the job for 10 years . Jean Lacouague ' s project will be a &quot; wonderful and significant addition &quot; to the San Juan Capistrano Historical Society museum , said director Gwen Vermeulen , adding that the society ' s board of directors will decide how to publish and present the work . Lacouague , who has not set a completion date for his project , has been enlisting the help of friends and acquaintances for his family narratives . &quot; I ' m 70 years old and know a lot firsthand , and there are still a_few people my age who are helping me , &quot; he says . &quot; But I ' m also talking to grandchildren of Basques , finding_out the dates their people came here , the towns they came from , who they worked for . I want to get everything accurate. &quot;</TEXT>
