   <HEADLINE> OPINION POLL ON ANIMAL RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * In response to &quot; Creatures Great and -- Equal ? , &quot; Dec 25 : There is a paradox at the heart of the animal rights movement , which so far has not received the attention it deserves . Animals may indeed have consciousness and feelings , but only human_beings are capable of abandoning their own interests in the name of an abstract idea . Ask a spider if a fly has equal rights , or a cat if it is willing to stop chasing mice out of altruism . Squeamish lions , sharks and polar_bears are hardly likely to abandon their position at the top of the food_chain in_order to become vegetarians . Only people make such essentially irrational decisions as these . By the very act of asserting that animals are our equals , animal rights activists are demonstrating that capacity for moral reasoning and self-transcendence that human_beings alone possess . On the other hand , those who see other species only as food or raw_material can justifiably be accused of abandoning their human capacity for empathy and behaving like animals . ROBIN WALLACE Ontario * The moronic statements of persons such_as Ingrid Newkirk ( chairwoman of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) should not go unchallenged . She is quoted as saying that animals &quot; are not cheap burglar_alarms or living toys. &quot; The partnership between humans and dogs is many thousands of years old and has benefited both . The abduction of Polly Klaas , for example , would never have happened had there been a family dog of some size and a protective temperament in the house with those children . BONNIE DILLER Venice * On Nov . 26 I was_on Rodeo Drive when a group of demonstrating animal activists attacked me with a venom : unprintable four-letter_words , etc . What was I guilty of ? A black leather skirt , a black leather Western jacket with fringe , beads and some bird feathers . We American women have to look_at the agenda of these lunatics . They obviously plan to eliminate all animal use . Where is my freedom to choose what to wear and what to eat ? KINGA RYMSKY Maywood</TEXT>
