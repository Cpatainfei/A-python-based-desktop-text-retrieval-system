   <HEADLINE> ' FOUR WEDDINGS ' : NO BRIDESMAID AT THE BOX_OFFICE ; MOVIES : THE COMBINATION OF GOOD TIMING AND AGGRESSIVE MARKETING HAVE WORKED IN FAVOR OF THE INDEPENDENT FILM , WHICH WAS NO . 1 FOR THE WEEKEND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral &quot; opened last month , many people who follow independent movies expected it to be this year ' s &quot; Enchanted April. &quot; That film , also a British comedy directed by Mike Newell , was one of the art-house successes of 1992 , grossing more_than $ 13.2 million in this country and Canada . But in just six weeks , the well-received &quot; Four Weddings , &quot; variously described as &quot; fluff with an edge &quot; and &quot; a multitiered confection , &quot; has already taken_in more_than $ 14 million and is expected to soar way beyond that figure . In doing so , the movie has overcome its distributor ' s fears that , as producer Duncan Kenworthy put it , &quot; no American male will go see a film that has wedding in the title. &quot; It has also earned a footnote in the annals of movie history by becoming last weekend ' s box-office leader -- probably the first independent dramatic film to reach that benchmark , according to A.D. Murphy , box-office analyst for the Hollywood Reporter . ( This is not an uncommon achievement for the type of low-budget independent product known in the industry as genre films , such_as New Line Pictures ' &quot; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III , &quot; which last March captured the top box-office spot two weeks in a row. ) &quot; Four Weddings , &quot; which takes_place at a series of formal occasions , as spelled_out in its title , tells the story of Charles ( Hugh Grant ) , a young_man who is often a best_man but never a groom , and his infatuation with Carrie ( Andie MacDowell ) , an uninhibited but somewhat mysterious American he meets at -- where else ? -- a wedding . The film , made_for $ 5 million , one-sixth the cost of the average Hollywood movie , was shot in a compressed 36 days . The film ' s strong showing is attributed to several factors , including enthusiastic word_of_mouth , unusually aggressive marketing for a low-budget film , and , as is so often the case in the film_industry , good timing . Russell Schwartz , president of Gramercy Pictures , the film ' s distributor , said the company first suspected &quot; Four Weddings &quot; might be a sleeper when it performed well at several movie_theaters in Salt_Lake_City on the opening_night of the Sundance Film Festival . The audience was mainly ordinary moviegoers , not festival participants . &quot; It was sort of a middle-America situation , and ( the film ) played wonderfully , &quot; Schwartz said . When further screenings also yielded raves , Gramercy , a fledgling joint_venture between MCA ( the parent company of Universal Pictures ) and Polygram Filmed Entertainment , decided to take the risk of spending heavily on television advertising . Schwartz acknowledged that marketing_costs have far exceeded production_costs , but he declined to provide a specific figure . Schwartz said he also moved_up the film ' s opening date_from April to March to capitalize on a vacuum in the marketplace . &quot; We saw there was a hole in terms of similarly themed movies , and we took_advantage of it , &quot; he said . &quot; If there was another strong romantic comedy playing_at the same time , we might not be doing ( the business ) we ' re doing right now. &quot; The film opened in limited release , jumping to 240 theaters after Easter -- the beginning of a traditionally slow season for movies -- and expanding to 721 screens last weekend . The movie is expected to be in 900 theaters this weekend , Schwartz said . Opening the film in March also meant that Grant , who previously appeared in the James Ivory movies &quot; Maurice &quot; ( 1987 ) and last year ' s &quot; The Remains of the Day , &quot; would be starring in three new films at once -- Roman Polanski ' s &quot; Bitter Moon &quot; and John Duigan ' s &quot; Sirens , &quot; as well as &quot; Four Weddings. &quot; &quot; It might have helped initially , &quot; Schwartz conceded , &quot; but now the movie is taking_on its own life. &quot; Grant ' s success in &quot; Four Weddings &quot; has apparently not been lost on Miramax , distributor of &quot; Sirens. &quot; Grant is now being featured in print ads for &quot; Sirens , &quot; along with co-star Elle MacPherson , although the two are not paired_off in the movie . ( A Miramax spokeswoman said any resemblance between the ads for &quot; Four Weddings &quot; and &quot; Sirens &quot; is a coincidence. ) Producer Kenworthy , in a telephone_interview from London , cited Grant ' s appeal as a major reason the movie works . &quot; He has a sort of playfulness which makes you think he means more_than he seems to be saying , and when he furrows his brow and looks worried , you credit him with enormous intelligence , &quot; Kenworthy said . &quot; People want to mother him or befriend him . He ' s got a sort of boyish quality , that English charm. &quot; Tim Bevan , co-executive producer of the film , said the key to the film ' s success stemmed from the collaboration between screenwriter Richard Curtis ( &quot; The Tall Guy &quot; ) and Newell . &quot; Richard is a great , great comedic writer , but I think that Mike Newell , coming from a very strong dramatic background , went_for the truth of every scene rather than the punch_line , &quot; he said . From the outside , there seems to be a simpler explanation for why &quot; Four Weddings &quot; -- much like last summer ' s &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; -- is catching_on . &quot; There is a hunger for sophisticated , witty romantic comedy in the tradition of some of the Hollywood movies of the ' 30s and ' 40s , &quot; said film historian Stephen Farber . &quot; There ' s an audience that ' s starved for literate escapist entertainment. &quot;</TEXT>
