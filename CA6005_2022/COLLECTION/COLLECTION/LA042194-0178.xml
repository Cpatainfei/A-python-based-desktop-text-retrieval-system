   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; PARTY ' S ALMOST OVER FOR JAPAN ' S FORMER RULERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It looked_for a while as if the Liberal Democratic Party , whose 38-year grasp on political power here was broken last summer , might be staging a comeback : Its opponents -- the ruling eight-party coalition -- were sabotaging political reforms and forcing Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to compromise with LDP demands that turned a new election system to their favor . One quarrel after another erupted within the coalition . One announcement after another that Hosokawa made was soon rescinded . Finally , the mass media that had built Hosokawa ' s popularity ratings to record highs suddenly began questioning the inability of the telegenic , aristocratic former governor to explain a $ 950 # 000 loan he received from a gangster-linked parcel delivery firm 14 years ago . Seizing the opportunity , the LDP asserted that the loan was , in fact , an illegal political donation ; the party launched a boycott of parliamentary deliberations on the budget , already delayed by political reform , to demand answers . &quot; No matter what mistakes he ( Hosokawa ) made , the public still liked him , &quot; one LDP member complained . &quot; We concluded that if we couldn ' t get_rid_of him , we would n ' t have a chance to regain power in the next election. &quot; On April 8 , the LDP got its wish : Hosokawa announced that he would resign to break the budget logjam and accept moral responsibility for still undisclosed financial dealings that he said might involve violations of law . Now , however , Hosokawa ' s badly split coalition stands but one step away from naming a new prime_minister . And the Liberal Democrats have seized defeat from the jaws of victory . While the old rulers might yet patch together an LDP-led coalition with expectations of going_back to &quot; business as usual , &quot; the party ' s chances to regain control by itself appear more remote than ever . Divisions within its ranks have become at least as serious as those within the ruling coalition . On Tuesday , the LDP avoided what , according to political commentator Minoru Morita , would have been &quot; a fatal blow &quot; as former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe completed a humiliating about-face by announcing that he would neither leave the LDP nor form a new party to join the coalition , as he had declared he would a day earlier . But his threatened rebellion exposed Watanabe , leader of the party ' s third-largest faction , as a turncoat-in-waiting . It also revealed that the thirst for power was gravitating away from the LDP . Even without Watanabe , 12 lawmakers bolted the LDP in the 12 days of furor since Hosokawa resigned , shaving its holdings in the lower house to 207 , or 49 shy of a majority . As a result , the ruling coalition ' s de_facto choice for its next leader , Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata , may win election for prime_minister in the lower house by a wider margin than the seven-vote majority Hosokawa got last Aug . 6 . So serious were the threats of more defections that the LDP appeared to be in the process of dissolution . &quot; The important thing is to make_sure you get_out before you find yourself the last leader left in the LDP , &quot; one senior party leader said -- only half-jokingly . ( The last leader would assume the burden of the party ' s debts and the problem of disposing_of its large staff -- in_effect , take_charge of bankruptcy. ) Still blessed with an ample supply of candidates , the LDP -- unlike any of the coalition parties by themselves -- is expected to find no trouble running candidates in all_of the 300 single-seat districts in the next election , which is expected next year . But continuing defections would seriously reduce the number of LDP winners , just as defections last summer did_in the July election that deprived the party of its majority . The LDP was also unable to use the turmoil it sparked to build a new image . Although emotionally divided , the coalition is still seen by the public as the vehicle for change ; the LDP is seen as a party of money politics and back-room deals . Despite driving_out Hosokawa , LDP President Yohei Kono made no attempt to form an LDP-led coalition -- this even though help from any one of three opposition parties would have done the trick . Nor did he offer any new vision for what an LDP coalition could do to solve a host of problems Japan faces , including its worst post-World War II recession . Both pro- and anti-reform party leaders criticized Kono for deficient leadership . In response , he promised -- without specifying when -- to name new party executives and reform decision-making to dilute the influence of elders and bosses of factions . A Yomiuri newspaper poll released Wednesday showed 37 % of voters picked Hata as their No . 1 preference for the next prime_minister ; a mere 4 % named Kono . Most dangerous to the LDP ' s future is a growing conviction among Japan ' s power-oriented interest_groups that the LDP will not again be &quot; the administration party. &quot; In the past , nationwide relationships -- extending down to the ward and county level -- had lured voters in search of favors to the party . Education Minister Ryoko Akamatsu said the coalition had ended the power of LDP lobbyist-experts to influence the bureaucracy . Koji Kakizawa , a former parliamentary vice foreign_minister , was reported to have walked_out_of the party because he wants to run_for governor of Tokyo and is sure that no LDP member can win that post . And one formerly influential LDP urban lawmaker was reported to be despondent because , since last summer , he has found himself with nothing to do . Small shopkeepers who had come_to him for help with taxes or favors they needed from the bureaucracy have stopped visiting .</TEXT>
