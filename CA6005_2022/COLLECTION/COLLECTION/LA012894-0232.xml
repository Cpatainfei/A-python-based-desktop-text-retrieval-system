   <HEADLINE> APPLE SOFTWARE TO BE LICENSED TO SOME RIVALS ; COMPUTERS : ACCESS TO MACINTOSH LINE WILL BE CONDITIONAL ON USING NEW POWERPC MICROPROCESSOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Apple Computer Inc. , in an important philosophical shift , plans to stop hoarding its popular Macintosh software and license it to competing computer makers . But there ' s a catch : Apple , the computing pioneer based in Cupertino , Calif. , said it will make the user-friendly software available only to makers of machines that use the coming PowerPC microprocessor , jointly developed by Apple , IBM Corp . and Motorola Inc. It will not offer the software to makers of personal_computers that use Intel chips , which dominate the market , particularly in offices . Chief_Executive Michael Spindler told shareholders at Apple ' s annual meeting Wednesday that the company is &quot; actively exploring &quot; licensing options . Spindler had hinted at such a Macintosh strategy in recent months , and Apple took a step away from its isolation philosophy last year , when it licensed the technology for its new Newton hand-held computing and communications device . One analyst said it is significant that Apple has publicly committed itself to a strategy for challenging Intel ' s dominance of the market and boosting its own flagging fortunes . &quot; If Apple doesn ' t get its software licensed , it will be doomed to single-digit market share for the foreseeable future , &quot; said Rich Bader , an industry_analyst in Beaverton , Ore . Machines that use Intel chips as their &quot; brains &quot; and Microsoft Corp. ' s Windows operating software hold overwhelming leads in the corporate and home-use markets . Dataquest Inc. , a San Jose research firm , projects that U.S. sales of machines based on Intel ' s Pentium family of chips and its clones will soar to 21 million by 1997 , three times more_than projections for PowerPC machines . Intel ' s dominance is encountering fierce challenges , however . In a blow to the giant Wednesday , Compaq Computer Corp . pledged to buy some microprocessors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , a key Intel rival . Of machines already in_use , 39 million use Intel chips and 6.8 million are Macintoshes containing Motorola chips . Apple has billed the PowerPC as offering &quot; twice the performance of Pentium for half the price , &quot; but Intel has recently taken aggressive steps to reduce its prices . Opinion is divided as_to how much licensing would help Apple , which has been troubled by management turnover , blistering price_competition and a sour reception for the Newton . Apple ' s stock has tumbled from a high of $ 62 a share last January . In trading on the Nasdaq Stock_Market , Apple shares rose 62.5 cents Thursday , to close at $ 34.125 a share . * Apple is expected to release its first Macintosh machines based on the PowerPC in March . Other manufacturers are likely to sit_back for a time until they see how the PowerPC fares against Intel ' s new Pentium chip . Bruce Lupatkin , an analyst with the Hambrecht &amp; Quist investment_firm in San Francisco , said there is no guarantee that other computer companies will want the Macintosh operating software . And he questioned Apple ' s motives . &quot; The issue is whether there are new opportunities in emerging markets , &quot; he said . &quot; If Apple is trying to position itself against Windows in the corporate world , it doesn ' t make sense. &quot;</TEXT>
