   <TEXT> Japan ' s Seiko Corp . and Seiko Epson Corp . have big plans for your wristwatch , car stereo , clocks , home_appliances and cellular_phone : They want to turn them into receivers for FM radio_signals . The companies recently announced plans to deploy a high-speed wireless communications network through a newly formed subsidiary , Seiko Communications . Called Active , the network system will transmit information such_as personal paging messages , emergency notification broadcasts , news updates and local traffic reports worldwide . The Active system is compatible with all national and international standards for FM frequencies and uses the existing infrastructure of radio_stations . Seiko is already negotiating with potential partners in countries throughout the world . In addition , the company has developed a small , low-cost receiver with low power consumption that it believes is ideal for building into mass-market products . Seiko has been testing an FM system in the Pacific Northwest over the past two years that allows residents to receive a wide variety of information , from weather_forecasts and local sports scores to winning lottery numbers and ski condition reports . The information is displayed on the system ' s first consumer product -- the Seiko MessageWatch . Hold Still : Like small children , proteins are constantly in motion , twisting and turning , changing their shape and linking up with their neighbors . Thus , while scientists have been able to take snapshots of proteins , they have not been able to observe their motions directly . Direct observation is important because the movements of proteins -- the essential building_blocks of life -- are critical to understanding how they work . But in the Sept . 9 issue of the journal Science , a team of scientists at the University of California , Santa Barbara reported it was able to watch while the enzyme lysozyme -- part of the body ' s immune defenses -- attacked and disabled another molecule . Instead of probing proteins with light or electron beams , researchers used an instrument called an atomic force microscope . The microscope works like the arm of a record_player , physically tracking the contours of a specimen with a tiny , highly_sensitive needle . As the needle , whose tip measures only 20 billionths of a meter across , moves_over a protein , its movements can be translated into real-time images . My Aching Wrists : Carpal_tunnel_syndrome , a potentially debilitating injury involving the tendons that pass_through a circular bone in the wrist , has received a lot of attention of late and is often associated with people who spend long hours working_on computer_keyboards . Now researchers at Pennsylvania State University have developed a computer model to predict other occupations that carry high risks for carpal_tunnel_syndrome , which can cause severe pain and swelling in the wrists and arms . So far , the model has pinpointed poultry processing , meatpacking , cookie baking , carpet making , metal manufacturing and plastics molding . Whereas research on carpal_tunnel_syndrome traditionally focused_on personal and job attributes that may increase the likelihood of injury , the computer model zeroes_in on the actual way in which the injury occurs . Pitting tendon strength against the stress applied to it , the model can predict both when the tendon will fail and the number of incidences of carpal_tunnel_syndrome for a given job . The model has led to some interesting findings . Wrist extension was shown to be more dangerous than wrist flexion . And women were between two and 10 times more likely than men to suffer from carpal_tunnel_syndrome . Some of that difference may be_due to the fact that repetitive jobs are more likely to go_to women than men , the researchers said . But the model showed that a woman ' s smaller wrist size resulted in greater stress on the tendon that passes_through the carpal tunnel , or wrist canal . The model is especially useful for industry because it requires only two relatively simple measurements -- grip force and wrist angle -- that can easily be collected at the job site . Sooty Signatures : Everybody talks_about air_pollution , but nobody actually knows what all_the sources are . Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are zeroing_in on one cause of pollution : soot . They are working_on identifying the sources of soot based on its microscopic structure . It seems this structure is a function of the particle ' s oxidation and thermal history . That means the soot particles from a diesel_engine look different under the microscope than those from a factory smokestack . By showing the relationship of soot microstructures to combustion conditions and fuel types , the scientists hope to put_together a library of soot structures that can be used to show not only the sources of these carbon pollutants in the air , but also to identify specific types of fuel and conditions that lead to such emissions . This , in turn , would help engineers find ways to control the pollutants at their source .</TEXT>
