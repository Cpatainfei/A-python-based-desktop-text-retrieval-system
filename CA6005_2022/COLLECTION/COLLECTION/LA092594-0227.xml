   <HEADLINE> HOW CONGRESS SHOULD OPERATE ON HEALTH_CARE SYSTEM ; WE SHOULD ONLY FIX WHAT IS WRONG WITH HEALTH_CARE , NOT RESTRUCTURE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM , AS THE ADMINISTRATION IS ATTEMPTING TO DO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We should fix what ' s wrong with health_care and leave the rest alone . President Clinton deserves credit for raising the need to examine problems in health_care . However , we do not need and should not want a government-imposed , government-run system . Instead , we need to focus_on the specific problem areas of most concern to most people : * Catastrophic coverage -- Most Americans are rightly afraid that a sudden illness or injury will bankrupt them or cost them their home . To avoid this , we should standardize catastrophic coverages in private health_insurance . * Portability of benefits -- People should not have to fear losing their coverage if they lose their job . We should expand the present labor laws to provide_for coverage . * Deductibility of health_care premiums -- Small business and individuals should have the same right as large corporations to deduct health_care premiums from taxes . * Pre-existing conditions -- There should be some restrictions on insurance_companies ' ability to exclude pre-existing conditions from coverage . However , we should not subsidize unhealthy health habits or throw suburban residents in with the inner_city . * Legal reform -- Conspicuously absent from the Administration ' s proposals is any suggestion of reform of the legal_system . Coincidentally , trial_lawyers were the single largest donors to Bill_Clinton ' s campaign -- and to Anthony Beilenson ' s . As state planning director , I personally wrote comprehensive proposals for legal reform , and I will do the same in the Congress . * The Hippocratic Oath states , &quot; First , do no harm. &quot; Unfortunately , much of what has been proposed would only make our health_care system worse . It is an unwarranted leap of logic to suggest that these specific problems or others justify wholesale restructuring of a system with which 80 % of Americans say they are satisfied . In one sense it is hardly surprising that medical costs are increasing . As a society grows richer , people want to live longer and healthier lives . So they spend more on health_care . We should maintain this patient choice and provider freedom and strengthen the doctor-patient relationship instead of inserting bureaucrats 3 # 000 miles away into personal decisions . Government-run ( or government-imposed ) health_care will do what every_other government social program has done : waste money , support bureaucrats , soak the middle_class to subsidize the poor and reduce the level of choice and quality for everyone . First , I challenge the notion that there should necessarily be a &quot; national health_care system &quot; beyond the specialized systems we have already set_up for the needy ( Medicaid , Medi-Cal ) and retired ( Medicare ) . We live_in a free society and a private-sector economy , and most decisions are and should be made by individuals , not the government . Second , the employer mandate proposed by the Administration is simply a disguised tax increase . It will come_in the form of higher prices for goods and services , and lost jobs ( especially entry-level jobs , the kind we most need to pull people out of poverty ) . Third , proposals for a government-run health_care system will inevitably hurt seniors , who have the greatest need . All government systems ration care , not by price but in two other ways : first , by making people wait for many procedures ; and , second , by making other procedures not available at all . Fourth , the Administration ' s price-control proposals will not work . You cannot repeal the laws of supply and demand by setting_up a federal bureaucracy . Indeed , everything proposed in the current Washington debate has been tried , implemented and found wanting somewhere else . Unfortunately , the health_care debate has degenerated into a partisan political battle where the original aim of sound policy has been lost . Partisan Democrats are simply looking_for a political victory for the President , regardless of whether it ' s a good result . Partisan Republicans are simply looking_for a defeat . Both sides are misusing policy arguments for political goals . For example , only about 3 % of the U.S. population ( not &quot; 37 million people &quot; ) , most of whom are young or temporarily between jobs , are the hard-core medically uninsured . These are the people we need to reach , and we are already doing so through programs like Medi-Cal and Medicaid and emergency_rooms of hospitals . These systems may be improved , but that is how the debate ought to be framed . Although he is now trying to hide the fact by sending_out taxpayer-paid campaign mail that he favors a &quot; go-slow &quot; approach , my opponent Mr. Beilenson is one of the co-sponsors of HR 1200 , the legislation that would impose a full-blown , government-run &quot; single payer &quot; system like that in Canada . He says it works . Evidently he hasn ' t spoken_to many Canadians . His sponsorship of what is essentially socialized medicine will punish the middle-class people of this district , just like his support for tax_hikes and slashes in defense jobs , and his refusal to get_tough on crime or pay more_than lip_service to illegal immigration . The kind of &quot; health_care reform &quot; the Administration wants appears to be dead , at least for this year . that ' s a good thing . Members of Congress ought to read 1 # 400-page bills before voting on them . The even more radical &quot; single payer &quot; system proposed by Mr. Beilenson is also dead . Next year , I will be a voice in the Congress for sensible , cautious , incremental change that addresses real problems and otherwise leaves people alone .</TEXT>
