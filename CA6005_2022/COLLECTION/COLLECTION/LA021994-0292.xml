   <TEXT> Pope John Paul II may return to the United States this year , on a lightning East Coast visit . Vatican sources said Friday the 73-year-old pontiff hopes to address the United Nations in New York as it observes its 50th anniversary . Planning is incomplete , but the late October stop in New York could be followed by short pastoral visits to Newark , N.J. , and Baltimore , the sources said . Neither city has been among the Pope ' s stops on three previous U.S. visits , the last to Denver in August to mark his church ' s World Youth Day . John Paul last addressed the General_Assembly in 1979 on his first U.S. visit the year after he was elected .</TEXT>
