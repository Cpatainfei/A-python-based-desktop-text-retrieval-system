   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : FIRST_AMENDMENT TO ANSWER CALL OF TELECOM OVERSIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Well , it seems S.1822 turned_out to be a wrong number after all . But now that pernicious parochialism has finally disconnected congressional efforts to upgrade America ' s ancient telecommunications laws , what rules will govern tomorrow ' s information highways ? Will the essential document still be the Communications Act of -- can you believe it ? -- 1934 ? The perennial Judge Harold Greene and the antitrust consent decree that dismembered Ma Bell ? The tenderly technocratic &quot; rule-makings &quot; of the Federal Communications Commission ? The precociously anachronistic Cable Reform Act of 1992 ? None of the above : The &quot; regulation &quot; that will have by far the biggest impact on tomorrow ' s new-media services and the movie studios , cable operators and telephone_companies that provide them will be the First_Amendment of the Constitution of the United States . Consider it &quot; freedom_of_the_press &quot; with a multimedia twist . &quot; If the existing telecommunications bills had not collapsed , there would have been serious First_Amendment problems with many of their provisions , &quot; asserts Harvard law professor Laurence H . Tribe . &quot; The new telecommunications landscape can ' t be planned or planted without the very fundamental considerations of the First_Amendment taken into account. &quot; Tribe , one of America ' s most brilliant constitutional scholars , has taken the same First_Amendment rights that citizens comfortably associate with publishers of the printed page and cleverly mapped them onto the proprietors of telephone networks . Representing Bell Atlantic in its efforts to wriggle out of a regulatory straitjacket forbidding it from offering video programming over its own phone_lines , Tribe successfully argued that the First_Amendment offers the same free speech opportunities and protections to regulated telecommunications giants as small-town newspapers . When a Baby Bell was a telephone_company , moving other people ' s voices and data over its lines , it was a heavily regulated &quot; common_carrier &quot; obliged to give equal access to all at government-approved rates . But with this ruling , don ' t think_of a Baby Bell as a telephone_company anymore : Think_of it as a newspaper_publisher -- or a movie studio -- that happens to have wires running_into every local home and business . &quot; The reason I originally conceptualized the complaint on behalf of Bell Atlantic was that First_Amendment considerations hadn ' t been playing an adequate role in the discussion , &quot; says Tribe . &quot; The First_Amendment definitely lowers barriers of entry to video programming for Bell Atlantic. &quot; Comparable rulings have recently given Bell South and US West similar freedoms . These rulings are , of course , expected to be appealed all_the way up_to the Supreme Court . Should they be affirmed , the First_Amendment -- not antitrust_laws or FCC rulings -- will be the preeminent industrial policy of the Information Age . Now , cynics might argue that Tribe ' s Bell Atlantic argument recalls press critic A.J. Leibling ' s caustic gibe that &quot; freedom_of_the_press extends only to those who own one , &quot; but this precedent is extraordinary in its implications . Presumably , a power utility that wants to send information down its networks would enjoy the same First_Amendment rights as a Baby Bell . If a Baby Bell has a First_Amendment right to simultaneously distribute video , voice and text over its network , doesn ' t that , in_effect , make obsolete cross-ownership-of-media provisions that forbid a single company from owning TV_stations , newspapers and radio_stations in the same town ? What about the local cable company that wants to publish a newspaper ? First_Amendment challenges to media cross-ownership rules have been rejected by the Supreme Court in the past , but the court ' s rationale -- based in part on the inherent scarcity of TV and radio broadcasting frequencies -- is quickly becoming obsolete . People ordinarily think_of the First_Amendment and the media in the context of such issues as the right of an individual to get a fair trial as opposed to the public ' s right to follow news about that trial , but that perception is now laughably limited . In the absence of coherently crafted telecommunications legislation , the First_Amendment will continue to assume policy primacy over outmoded antitrust and cross-ownership rules and increasingly artificial distinctions between content and conduits . Consequently , in the eyes of today ' s courts , the First_Amendment is enjoying a robust renaissance as an instrument of deregulation and economic competition . &quot; I think the First_Amendment could and will and should be used for the removal of restrictions that separate industries from each other , &quot; agrees Eli Noam , who served on New York ' s Public_Utility Commission and now directs Columbia University ' s Institute of Tele-Information . &quot; The tradition of telecommunications regulation was ' content-neutral , ' but the technological metamorphosis of the phone_service to a mass medium has raised issues that give First_Amendment issues priority over traditional utility law. &quot; For example , the consent decree blocks the Baby Bells from offering long-distance telephone_service . Does that mean Bell Atlantic can ' t sell its video programming beyond its region ? that ' s like saying you shouldn ' t be able to buy the Los Angeles Times in New York . The point is simple : The preeminence of the First_Amendment will ride_roughshod over these irksome legal technicalities . To be sure , there are a host of troublesome questions a First Amendment-driven telecommunications policy leaves inadequately addressed : What of non-discriminatory access to the networks ? What does universal service mean in this context ? But it ' s clearly time for policy-makers to worry less about trying to draw distinctions between cable operators and phone_companies , content and conduits and worry more about what fairness and equity mean in a new-media world where the First_Amendment comes first .</TEXT>
