   <TEXT> The question being tested here under the volcano is whether , beginning with one world-important and summer-scorched weekend in July , it is possible to hew order from the chaos called Naples . Will President Clinton , who arrives Friday , find a historic and beautiful city that is belatedly recovering its health and pride ? Or will he and leaders from the six other richest nations see hastily applied makeup caking an urban corpse as the setting for their Group of Seven meeting this weekend ? Reform Naples ! O sole mio . What a giggle . Easier to stay the tide . But don ' t laugh too hard . Overdue change is afoot in Italy ' s messiest metropolis . Reforms are being launched , and some serious people are taking them seriously : &quot; I have begun to stop for red_lights , &quot; said Tullio Pironti , the city ' s last remaining book publisher . &quot; I used to feel stupid if I stopped , because nobody else did. &quot; Whether this sudden modernization will outlast a limelit international gathering is the real question . Though the Italian government , the Secret_Service and Neapolitans themselves will make_sure Clinton sees no trace of it , there is an everlasting seamy side of Naples : When I exclaimed at a white-bearded body in blue_jeans lying_in the gutter , my cab driver scarcely braked , explaining , &quot; No , he ' s not dead , that ' s Alfonso , who ' s quite comfortable there . He ' s a habitue . Alfonso drinks and drinks . I think he drinks to forget. &quot; Oblivion and disorder , thy name is Napoli . Little moves under the broiling sun except hands jammed on horns . Motorbikes weave on sidewalks around pedestrians , pickpockets , con_men , preteen apprentice hoods called scugnizzi . Vendors hawk African gewgaws , Miami Dolphin hats , smuggled cigarettes and pirated copies of X-rated movies . Naples ' throbbing streets are home to a nasty branch of organized_crime called the Camorra , and support some of Europe ' s highest official unemployment and worst civic services . Naples is a noisy , noxious , insufferable and dangerous city that often seems more of the Third_World than the First . And yet . . . Neapolitans agree that their city is ungovernable and unlivable , but 78 % tell pollsters they ' d never leave . Naples is a madhouse in which nothing ever works ; a stress-and- Angst factory in which suicide is almost unknown . It is a slums ' n ' squalor , palaces ' n ' princes southern port , with world-class architecture and museums . That kid on the corner may steal your watch while your park_bench neighbor is reading Pliny the Elder in Latin . And how can anybody stay angry at a city in which one sips cappuccino while watching clouds play atop the Vesuvius volcano on the far side of a fairy-tale bay ? Naples may even seem quite magical from Bill_Clinton ' s sanitized view of it in the ( Enrico ) Caruso Suite of the Hotel Vesuvio at the heart of a newly coiffed city core , where the G-7 participants will live and meet for three days beginning Friday . Christened the &quot; red zone &quot; and closed to traffic , it will perhaps be the most protected place on Earth until Sunday night . Even residents on foot need a special pass to get_into the area . The security and the fresh paint are symptomatic : What a difference a year can make ! Last summer , Naples touched bottom , befouled and overwhelmed by corruption and decay . Uncollected garbage festered , few traffic_lights worked , potholes swallowed roads , the water was brown , the city government wasn ' t paying its bills . The crisis marked the local climax of a national scandal in which political_parties , organized crime and big business were belatedly caught conspiring to get rich at public expense . Lire flowed into Naples by the billions : Special funds for a 1974 cholera epidemic , a 1980 earthquake and the 1990 World Cup came_in a torrent . Many repairs and projects were started : a sports palace , schools , a new Justice Ministry building . Hardly anything was finished . &quot; It was like the pyramids . The question was not when a project would be finished but how long it could be kept alive to eat money , &quot; newspaperman Vito Faenza said . Change began Aug . 6 , when Prefect Umberto Improta , the Italian government ' s senior representative in Naples , dissolved the feuding , corrupt and inept city government to remedy what he deemed a lack of public order . Improta , formerly police_chief in Milan and Rome , does not take_kindly_to civic malfeasance . Over the past two years , he has dissolved 16 local_governments in the region around Naples for having links to the Camorra and 40 others for administrative paralysis . In Naples , Improta named administrators to run the bankrupt city until elections could be held_in November . Before that , though , then-Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi , himself an interim technocrat , amazingly asked Improta if Naples could possibly host the annual meeting of the world ' s seven largest economic powers plus their newfound Russian ally . &quot; I said yes , if certain things were done first , &quot; Improta , 61 , said in an interview . The central and regional governments dutifully anted_up about $ 35 million for infrastructure preparations . When the mayoral elections came , Naples , like most other large Italian cities , turned_to the left in protest against corrupt Establishment parties . Antonio Bassolino , 47 , a longtime apparatchik of the former Italian Communist_Party who now leads its social democratic successor , defeated right-winger Alessandra Mussolini , granddaughter of the former dictator . Naples ' new mayor cut his political teeth on fierce partisan politics . But Bassolino has proved an unabashed Naples booster , reaching across party_lines in search of renewal . &quot; I ' ve been critical of him , but as mayor , Bassolino has certainly overcome his combative past . He has appointed a good team of people , and he understands that restoration cannot be done_by government alone , &quot; said Cesare De Seta , a Neapolitan author and history of architecture professor . Together , Improta , the crusty ex-cop turned administrator , and Bassolino , the rookie reformer-mayor , are proving an effective odd couple . They have begun stitching the southern metropolis of 1.2 million people back together : Public works contracts are now let_on a fixed-price basis in a blind draw of competing companies -- a revolution in the Italian context . &quot; Work is being finished in record time and at great savings -- 55 % to 60 % cheaper than in the past , &quot; Bassolino said in an interview . &quot; Everybody is interested in making the city look good . For G-7 , Naples wants to prove itself to the world. &quot; Repaving of the main bay-side road , a civic priority for decades , is finished . The Piazza del Plebiscito and the Via San Carlo have been redone and antiqued to restore them to the way they looked in the early 19th Century , when Naples , home of a ruling Spanish king , stood with Paris and London in the front rank of European capitals . The 17th-Century Royal Palace , where the G-7 leaders will meet in the tapestry-draped Hercules room , has had its face_lifted along with a number of major thoroughfares and buildings including City_Hall . &quot; The city is recovering . There ' s a new spirit of collaboration . We must show that the government keeps its promises . To combat decay , antipathy and indifference is the best way to fight crime , &quot; Improta said . Cops are giving traffic tickets ; trucks are towing illegally parked cars . Bassolino has reopened half_a_dozen parks . Improta has overseen the refurbishing of 280 schools . This month , Naples Police_Chief Ciro Lomastro astonished and outraged 160 phantom city workers who collect pay_for jobs they never go_to -- a hallowed Naples scam . He had them arrested . Naples patriot Jean Noel Schifano , director of the_French Institute that teaches French language and culture , sees marked improvement in the life of a city he loves and has written_about extensively . There is poverty aplenty , but some appearances are misleading : Swiss patients come for eye operations at one Naples clinic , Schifano says . Tens of thousands of nominally unemployed , in fact work hard in businesses and industries that do not officially exist -- and therefore pay no taxes . &quot; Things are getting better . You can take a Sunday morning walk by the sea and smell the sea . Ten years ago , people were afraid to go_out at night . Now there is night life again . We are going_in the right direction . This is how Naples used to be , &quot; Schifano said . Wrong , says 78-year-old philosopher and social commentator Luigi Campagnone , a lifelong Naples resident : &quot; I never go_out anymore because I cannot bear to see Naples . It ' s unlivable . &quot; People go_into raptures about the music , sky , sun , sea , sand . Lies , all lies . I define Naples as a collective infection . Two weeks after G-7 it will be exactly the same mess as before , &quot; said Campagnone over coffee at his home recently . &quot; I was here during the Naples uprising in the war , when kids leaped bravely on German tanks and some got killed . Three days later , the Americans came , and these same kids were selling their sisters and mothers to new soldiers . It ' s a stupid , diabolical city. &quot; In context , says Neapolitan sociologist Domenico De Masi , Naples is no stranger to big international gatherings -- or the fact that little lasting good usually survives them . The Roman emperor Tiberius held ancient-world versions of G-7s on the island of Capri off the Naples coast , he says . &quot; Greeks , Romans , Renaissance princes , 16th- and 17th-Century kings have always met here -- it ' s an excuse for a party , &quot; De Masi said . Others are less skeptical . Surveying clean streets blessedly free_of cars one morning this week , Fulvio Milone , a longtime newspaper correspondent based in Naples , says nobody expects the G-7 overhaul to be the opening salvo in a social revolution . &quot; Rather , &quot; he said , &quot; it could be a trampoline toward renewal. &quot; Bassolino and Improta recognize that they are sailing against the wind of both history and expectation , but they are not discouraged . &quot; We will change the cultural and civic image of the city , &quot; Bassolino promises . Improta , whose security_forces have been nearly doubled to about 11 # 000 for G-7 , says crime_rates have fallen dramatically in the past two years , 50 % in some cases . One works project that is finished is the big , new Secondigliano prison in the northern reaches of the city . Its denizens include not only former political grandees snared by corruption investigations , but also Camorra bosses corralled by better police work and more vigorous judicial prosecution . &quot; We still have a long way to go , but I think we have turned the corner , &quot; said Improta . From their different perspectives , Bassolino and Improta both point to what appears to be a changing perception about the role of government in Naples : Some grudging respect appears to be growing among a_people who have historically mocked and undermined authority . &quot; I think Bassolino is trying to say that Neapolitans have their dignity and can take_on formal commitments , &quot; sociologist De Masi said . &quot; There are those magic moments in which a group of people becomes open_to change . . . . Bassolino seems to offer some hope -- a little brake in a fatal descent. &quot; Neapolitan jewels long obscured by urban blight are beginning to reassert themselves . On Sunday now , cars are banned on some seaside roads , and Neapolitans gather along them to promenade . A private volunteer group arranged to open about 200 often-closed churches , museums , monuments and archeological sites one weekend this spring . They drew nearly 1 million people . Recently , inspecting the city ' s often-shut archeological museum -- one of the world ' s best -- Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi noted that he himself had never been there before . Naples will never be Florence . But it will always be Naples , a vibrant and gritty port whose people long ago learned that survival , tolerance and hospitality are three of life ' s great virtues . Fingers crossed , the reforming mayor of a reawakening city quietly tells visitors that , in recent months , Italian and foreign tourists have begun to return to Naples for the first time in many years .
