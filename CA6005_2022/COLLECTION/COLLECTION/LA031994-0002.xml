   <HEADLINE> MUSLIMS , CROATS SIGN ACCORDS FOR NEW FEDERATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Muslims and Croats signed agreements Friday creating a new federation of their long-warring parties and stirring hope for a comprehensive settlement . But their accords raised concern among American policy-makers here about the peacekeeping role U.S. troops may eventually have to play in shattered Bosnia-Herzegovina . In a ceremony here , hailed by President Clinton as a &quot; moment of hope , &quot; leaders of the two groups formally agreed to a new constitution and signed a statement of principles linking their commonly held areas to Croatia . The pacts are designed to increase pressure on the Bosnian Serbs , who control 70 % of Bosnia and have shown little inclination to surrender land or make other concessions . Even acknowledging the obstacles that remain , Clinton said the agreements &quot; offer one of the first clear signals that parties to this conflict are willing to end the violence and begin a process of reconstruction. &quot; And Russia ' s chief strategist on the Balkan conflict , Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S . Churkin , predicted that Bosnian Serbs will soon agree to a countrywide political settlement . But amid the signs of momentum toward peace , senior Administration officials acknowledged their concern that the public and Congress do not support plans to send U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia if a three-way peace agreement is signed . Many lawmakers and analysts said they believe that the peacekeeping contingent -- pledged more_than a year ago in hopes of advancing the cause of peace -- would be difficult to sell to the public and could threaten Clinton ' s domestic agenda should Americans be harmed . David Gergen , presidential counselor , said that -- if a settlement is worked_out -- the Administration will need to launch a &quot; major educational effort &quot; to persuade a public that has not yet focused_on the issue . And the White_House faces an &quot; uphill battle , &quot; he said , in persuading skittish members of Congress to support such a move . &quot; that ' s going_to be a tough one for us , &quot; Gergen said . But he acknowledged that the nation ' s support is essential for such a venture . &quot; First you commit the troops , then you commit the country , &quot; he said . Administration officials have estimated that as_many as 25 # 000 U.S. troops could be part of a peacekeeping force . The troops would be sent only if the peace agreement was clearly workable and if there were a clear strategy for withdrawal , officials have said . The contingent would remain only for a limited period -- perhaps one to two years , officials said . The Administration ' s strategy for selling the plan has been coming_into sharper focus . If a peace pact is signed , officials would argue that the accord has marked a clear diplomatic victory for the United States but that the victory -- and peace -- would evaporate , if U.S. troops were not sent . French and British officials have said their countries ' troops would not participate without U.S. involvement . And Bosnian Muslims have been explicit about their insistence on U.S. participation in any comprehensive settlement . &quot; I don ' t think in the last analysis Congress would want responsibility for choosing war over peace , &quot; one senior Administration official said . As the chances for a settlement seemed to brighten , prominent lawmakers from both parties urged the White_House to move quickly and aggressively to make its case for such a force . Sen . Richard G . Lugar ( R-Ind. ) , ranking minority member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said Clinton has no time to lose , considering that President George_Bush needed four months to sell Operation Desert Shield . &quot; Even then , it was a struggle , &quot; Lugar said . He said the Administration needs to begin by spelling out intentions that have been muddied by some officials ' insistence that the United States would never send ground troops to Bosnia . &quot; It ' s not really clear in my mind what the President intends to do , &quot; he said . Rep . Lee H . Hamilton ( D-Ind. ) , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , said that Clinton &quot; carries the burden of persuasion with Congress -- no doubt about it. &quot; Clinton may seek a congressional resolution explicitly spelling_out lawmakers ' support , he said . But if a vote were to occur now , &quot; he ' d probably lose , &quot; Hamilton said . Polls on the public ' s willingness to send U.S. peacekeeping troops show a sharp split . But the results become far more negative when the wording raises a possibility that troops might be hurt . An NBC News survey from last October , for example , found only 23 % of those polled favored sending a contingent , while 67 % opposed it when it was suggested that the ground troops &quot; could be subject_to hostile action. &quot; In Bosnia , &quot; there will be some risks , &quot; Hamilton declared . &quot; You have renegade commanders here and there , and there will be people taking some potshots. &quot; Greg Schneiders , a Democratic pollster , said that winning support for a peacekeeping contingent would be difficult for Clinton . And if the units began to suffer casualties , the move could hurt Clinton and threaten his domestic agenda , he said . The public still expects Clinton to be the domestic affairs President for whom they thought they had voted , Schneiders said . &quot; For him to get too wrapped_up in foreign affairs would be bait-and-switch , &quot; he said . Polls have already shown Clinton ' s vulnerability to such public concerns . Last October , after U.S. Army Rangers were killed in an attack in Mogadishu , Somalia , Clinton ' s approval rating tumbled 10 percentage_points , Gallup Organization polls showed . Analysts noted that sending ground troops to Bosnia would be more difficult than sending them to Somalia , where the mission originally was a limited famine-relief effort , or to Kuwait , where there was clearly Iraqi aggression . Bosnia , where national interests are not directly threatened , &quot; is really a case without precedent for us , &quot; said Helmut Sonnenfeldt , a former U.S. foreign_policy official now at the Brookings Institution think_tank here . The Administration ' s hesitancy to risk troops anywhere in the inflamed atmosphere of the former Yugoslav federation was apparent Friday , as officials discussed the new Muslim-Croat agreements . As part of those agreements , U.S. officials promised rewards for the country , starting with the opening , perhaps within weeks , of a new embassy in Sarajevo . One senior Administration official said the United States also would give Croatia permission to open consulates in New York , Pittsburgh , Cleveland and Los Angeles .</TEXT>
