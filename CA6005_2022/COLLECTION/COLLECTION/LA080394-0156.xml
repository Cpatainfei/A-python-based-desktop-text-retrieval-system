   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : MISSION VIEJO ; CITY MIGHT REGULATE ADULT NEWS RACKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Distributors of adult-oriented news rack publications would be required to apply for a permit from City_Hall under an ordinance backed by the Planning_Commission this week . City planners said the ordinance , which must receive final approval from the City_Council , will help keep track of news racks that feature sexually explicit materials . The news rack ordinance also would enable the city to regulate where the stands are located . In addition , the proposed law requires that no sexually suggestive words or pictures be visible from outside the vending machine . &quot; What we ' re trying to do is get news racks registered and make_sure to put them where they belong , &quot; Commissioner Sherri Butterfield said . &quot; This way , if we have a problem with the material or if a newsstand gets knocked_over or needs repair , we can contact the owner directly. &quot; The ordinance would not require a permit fee . Also , only one permit is required for any number of news racks . Butterfield said there is no count of the number of news racks featuring adult materials in Mission Viejo , and &quot; one of the purposes for instituting a permit process is to take an inventory. &quot; Planners had agreed on the need for a news rack ordinance in June , but delayed their approval in_order to insert the permit requirement and further define descriptions of adult materials . The news rack law would allow removal of any stands that allow the display of sexually explicit words or pictures . News racks that are placed near schools or impede the public right_of_way could also be relocated under the proposed ordinance . News rack distributors also would have to install blinders that cover at least two-thirds of the publication . The proposed ordinance is the city ' s latest attempt to regulate adult-oriented businesses or materials in Mission Viejo . Last year , the City_Council passed an adult business ordinance that restricted establishments such_as cabaret shows and massage parlors to certain areas of Mission Viejo to keep them away from churches , schools and residential_areas . Nobody appeared before the commission , which met Monday , to oppose the ordinance . FRANK MESSINA</TEXT>
