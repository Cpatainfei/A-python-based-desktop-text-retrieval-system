   <TEXT> Student-style travelers visiting France this year can find lodging and tourist information from several helpful sources . If you drop into the tourist information office at 127 avenue des Champs-Elysees , a short walk south of the Arc de Triomphe , you can pick_up a free copy of &quot; Youth in Paris. &quot; It ' s a 31-page booklet detailing what to see in the city and how to do_it , and includes a subway map plus emergency telephone_numbers . Another source for assistance is the Accueil des Jeunes ( AJF ) , an accommodation booking service that can reserve beds in Paris or other areas of France , in youth centers and budget hotels , for a fee of $ 1.60. Although the AJF is geared to travelers under 26 , there is no age limit for using its accommodation booking service . The AJF has 8 # 000 beds available in Paris in the winter and 11 # 000 in the summer . The AJF also operates its own hostel near the Bastille , as well as three restored townhouses . Rates for beds in Paris start at $ 16 a night and rise depending_on the facility and how many people share a room . AJF offices are at 16 rue du Pont Louis-Philippe , tel . ( from the U.S. ) 011-33-1-42-78-04-82 ; 119 rue St . Martin , tel . 011-33-1-42-77-87-80 ; 139 boulevard St.-Michel , tel . 011- 33-1-43-54-95-86 ( open March to October ) , and Gare du Nord rail station , tel . 011-33-1-42-85-86-19 ( open June to October ) . One of the centers into which the AJF can book guests is FIAP Jean Monet , a 550-bed , 25-year-old youth hotel that was renovated two years ago . Individuals are charged $ 40 for a single room , $ 26 per person in a double room , about $ 25 in a four-bed room and $ 20 in an eight-bed room . The popular student travel guide &quot; Let ' s Go : Europe &quot; ( St . Martin ' s Press ) , which lists more_than 50 budget accommodation facilities in Paris , says FIAP Jean Monet rooms are &quot; well-furnished , &quot; &quot; all with toilet and shower . . . impeccably maintained. &quot; It also warns that it ' s full in summer with tour groups , has a three-night maximum stay and reservations are essential . FIAP Jean Monet is at 30 rue Canabis , tel . 011-33-1-45-89-89-15 or fax 011-33-145-81-63-91 . The AJF offices in Paris can also help you prearrange accommodations in other areas of France . This year , for example , much attention will focus_on the Normandy area for D-Day anniversary events . The AJF can book accommodations into a youth center in that area , in the city of Caen . On June 6 , 50 years after the landings by the Allied nations , seven heads_of_state and 30 # 000 veterans , dignitaries and representatives will gather at the Caen Memorial to commemorate the 50th anniversary of D-Day . The special events are not limited to that date , however . Activities are scheduled from April until October . For example , on May 14-15 , 1940 vintage cars will rally on the invasion beaches ; approximately 200 of the vehicles are expected to parade through the town center , gathering at the Caen Memorial . According to a recent French government survey , travelers between the ages of 15 and 25 represented 10 % of the visitors to France . To help service this segment of the market , 54 private and nonprofit businesses banded_together to form an organization called Le Club Francais du Tourisme de Jeunes . CFTJ members , which include accommodation services , holiday centers , language study programs , holiday activity programs , theme parks and museums , publish a brochure called &quot; France , Youth , Travel &quot; that describes their services . A new_edition is scheduled for publication later this year . For more information , contact the_French Government Tourist Office , 9454 Wilshire Blvd. , Suite 715 , Beverly Hills 90212-2967 ; tel . ( 900 ) 990-0040 ( calls cost 50 per minute ) .</TEXT>
