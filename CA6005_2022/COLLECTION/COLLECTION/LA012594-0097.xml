   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK ; SOME INSURANCE_FIRMS STRADDLING FAULT_LINE ; LIABILITY : UNPRECEDENTED SERIES OF DISASTERS HAS LED SOME EXPERTS TO PREDICT THAT CERTAIN SMALL COMPANIES MAY FAIL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some insurance experts think the Northridge earthquake could sink a_few smaller insurance_companies , especially ones heavily focused_on commercial coverage in California . The quake has also revived questions about the industry ' s overall soundness , given the unprecedented string of catastrophes stretching back to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake . A.M. Best Co. , one of the leading insurance rating firms , based in Oldwick , N.J. , has begun an &quot; informal review &quot; of about 20 carriers whose business is concentrated in California , John H . Snyder , vice_president for property-casualty insurance , said Monday . He declined to name the companies . &quot; Do I expect 20 companies to become insolvent ? &quot; Snyder said . &quot; No , but there might be a_few , especially companies that are quite small and commercially oriented. &quot; Weiss Research , a consumer-oriented rating firm based in West Palm Beach , Fla. , issued a dire report -- coincidentally released the day after the earthquake -- saying that &quot; major property and casualty insurers may_not have enough capital to pay the claims that could result from . . . an unexpectedly large natural disaster. &quot; Weiss did not mean to imply that the Northridge quake was the sort of disaster that could precipitate that kind of an industry crisis , Weiss analyst Ted Brownstein said . Insurance payouts from the Northridge quake are not expected to come_close to the $ 18 billion in insured losses from Hurricane Andrew , because much of the damage was done to uninsured public_property such_as freeway overpasses and because earthquake policies carry high deductibles -- usually 10 % of coverage limits . The trade publication Business Insurance on Monday quoted catastrophe underwriters at Lloyd ' s of London as estimating the insured losses from the quake to be up_to $ 2.5 billion . Insurers have yet to estimate their individual dollar losses from the quake , saying it is too early to be accurate . State Farm , California ' s largest writer of homeowners and earthquake coverage , said it had received 50 # 000 loss reports as of Monday and expected the total to reach 115 # 000 claims . That compares with 31 # 000 claims for State Farm in the Loma Prieta quake . Brownstein said Weiss ' concerns stem from insurers ' tendency to &quot; fight the last war &quot; -- acting_as though the worst disaster losses in the past indicate likely losses in the future , and setting their reserves accordingly . But he says that disaster losses may be spiraling upward and that an $ 18-billion loss like that of Hurricane Andrew may be exceeded by another disaster . Weiss gave weak safety ratings of &quot; D + &quot; to Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co . and &quot; D &quot; to Reliance Insurance Co. , large national carriers that write extensive earthquake insurance in California . The Weiss firm tends to be conservative . Aetna ' s rating from A.M. Best is &quot; A &quot; ( excellent ) . Best ' s Snyder said he doubts that the Northridge earthquake will result in premium increases soon . Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi has softened his stance against rate increases , however . On Jan . 12 , he quietly approved a 6 % increase in homeowners rates for Allstate Insurance Co. , California ' s second-largest carrier . The rate hike , which will average $ 24 a year per policyholder , was approved without a hearing . It was the first hike in homeowners ' rates for any large carrier since Garamendi took_office in 1991 . William Ahern , deputy commissioner , said one factor_in granting the increase was that Allstate has paid rebates to policyholders under the Proposition 103 insurance rollback initiative . * SBA TO THE RESCUE : Jane Applegate has tips from the Master of Disaster .
