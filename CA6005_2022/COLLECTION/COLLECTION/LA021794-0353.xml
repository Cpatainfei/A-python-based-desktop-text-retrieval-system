   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE / LAWRENCE J . MAGID : TOSHIBA SUB-NOTEBOOK LINE HITS MARK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For several years , Toshiba America led the portable personal_computer industry with the lightest , most rugged and most powerful PCs on the market . But in recent years , the company has fallen_behind Apple , Compaq and IBM . Toshiba never stopped building well-made notebook and laptop systems , but the machines were unimaginative , a little on the heavy side and had come_to be a bit out of date . Not anymore . Toshiba is back on track with its new Portege sub-notebook computers . I ' ve been using the $ 2 # 599 T3400 monochrome version for a_couple_of weeks , and I ' m quite impressed . It ' s about $ 100 more and half a pound heavier than IBM ' s ThinkPad 500 , but I prefer its design . IBM doesn ' t even offer a color sub-notebook . Toshiba ' s active matrix color Portege ( model T3400CT ) costs $ 3 # 999 . Both new Toshibas come_with DOS 6.0 , Windows 3.1 and CommWorks for Windows , which lets you transfer files between computers by cable and also serves as telecommunications and fax software . From a design standpoint , the Portege offers the best of both Apple and IBM . Like the Apple PowerBooks , the Portege ' s keyboard is recessed behind a platform where you can rest the heels of your hands . Aside from being more comfortable , it makes the machine easier to use if you don ' t have a desk or tray table to rest it on . Like all IBM ThinkPad models , the Portege has a pencil-eraser-shaped pointing device ( in lieu of a mouse or track ball ) that sticks_up between G , H and B keys , letting you control the cursor with a single finger . The mouse buttons , located on the palm rest , are large and easy to press . I found myself adapting very quickly to this method of pointing and clicking , while I ' ve never been comfortable with the track balls built into most notebook PCs . I ' m especially unhappy with Compaq ' s track balls , which , on most models , are in the upper right corner of the screen . Toshiba didn ' t just take the best of two worlds . It added some features of its own , including a high-capacity lithium ion battery that , according to the company , will run a monochrome unit for between four and eight hours and a color model from three to six hours . I carried the monochrome version on a recent cross-country flight and did_well for the five hours between San Francisco and Baltimore , although I did turn it off during dinner . The unit can be configured to go_into a &quot; sleep &quot; or standby mode when you turn it off or close the cover . Turn it back on and everything comes_back as you left it . I left mine in this state for several days without fully depleting the battery . The monochrome version weighs 4.1 pounds ; the color model is 4.4 pounds . It ' s 9.9 inches wide , 7.9 deep and 1.8 high . The term sub-notebook generally refers to machines that weigh four pounds or less , so they ' re stretching it a bit . Notebook PCs usually weigh in at between 6 and 8 pounds , while laptops , which are no longer in great demand , weigh between 8 and 12 . There are lots of terms to describe heavier portable machines . My favorite is &quot; luggable. &quot; To reduce the size of the machine , Toshiba reduced the space between each key , resulting in a keyboard that ' s about 10 % smaller than a standard PC keyboard . I ' m a pretty fast touch typist and I did find myself having to slow_down a little to use this keyboard , but it wasn ' t bad . Nevertheless , I ' d like to see an ever-so-slightly larger version with normal spacing between the keys . * The machine has a 486SX microprocessor chip running at 33 megahertz . It comes_with four megabytes of random_access_memory , expandable to 20 . It has a 120-megabyte hard_disk and an external 3.5-inch floppy drive . There are the usual expansion ports , including a slot for a credit-card-size PCMCIA expansion card . PCMCIA cards can be used to add a modem , network adapter and other devices . A &quot; port replicator &quot; socket allows users to plug_in an optional ( $ 239 ) connector that provides access to various external devices , such_as an SVGA monitor and an external keyboard and mouse . The T3400 monochrome model has a passive 8.4-inch ( diagonal ) screen that ' s surprisingly easy to read . Unlike some passive_matrix_displays , it ' s able to keep_up with rapid movements of the cursor . The Porteges are more expensive than the competition , but they ' re well designed , rugged and have a very nice feel to them -- factors that can be important when considering a portable PC .</TEXT>
