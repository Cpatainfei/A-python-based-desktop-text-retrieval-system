   <HEADLINE> IBM , OTHER U.S. GIANTS SLASH OFFICE SPACE ; ECONOMY : IN THE PAST THREE YEARS , INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES HAS VACATED NEARLY HALF ITS U.S. OFFICE SPACE -- 21 MILLION SQUARE_FEET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lee Dayton was anxious . It was early 1993 , and IBM was bleeding red ink . Dayton , IBM ' s manager of real_estate , ordered his staff to slash expenses for office space . They quickly responded , moving four employees into one wastefully big office . His . &quot; I told my team that we ' d better make an example of ourselves , &quot; the manager recalled , grinning . &quot; They came_up with a plan which required me to evict myself. &quot; Dayton ' s transfer to a smaller office in Stamford , Conn. , was symptomatic_of a change that is reshaping IBM and other parts of corporate America . In the past three years , International Business Machines Corp . has vacated nearly half its U.S. office space -- 21 million square_feet . The shrinkage reflects IBM ' s sharp decline in the highly competitive , DOS-eat-DOS era of personal_computers . IBM has shed a third of its U.S. employees in the past three years . The computer maker is not alone . Companies that have downsized their staffs are looking_to do the same to their office_buildings . For example , Dayton ' s group , in addition to pruning IBM ' s space , has done consulting work to help American Express Co . and KPMG Peat Marwick reduce office space . A number of corporate giants , from AT &amp; T to Aetna , have embarked_on space-reduction programs . In a recent Arthur Andersen &amp; Co . survey , nearly two-thirds of 700 corporate_executives said they had recently shrunk their office space , or planned to . &quot; Over the last three years , they ( companies ) have been shedding workers like crazy . That has caused them to reassess how much space they need , &quot; said William Wheaton , director of the center for real_estate studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Some firms have gone so far as_to &quot; re-engineer the work space so they need less space per worker , &quot; Wheaton said . Analysts say a further decline for commercial real_estate in the United States is unlikely , since smaller , growing businesses are moving_into the empty space . But some cities have been hit badly . In White Plains , 25 miles north of New York City , IBM has vacated five buildings . A thriving corporate center in the mid-1980s , it ' s now dotted with glass-and-concrete shells . More_than 25 % of its office space is empty , one of the highest rates in the nation , said ONCOR International , a real-estate services_firm . IBM ' s case is striking because of the amount of space it is cutting and its attempt to do more_than simply dispose_of unused offices . It ' s trying to squeeze every penny out of its real_estate , in what Dayton calls &quot; a fundamental change in thinking. &quot; &quot; You have to very matter-of-factly explain that having a private office or a given office size is not an entitlement , &quot; he said . At IBM , rank used to have its privileges . Ask Linda Bodden . In the old days , the 34-year-old branch manager would have had a personal branch manager ' s secretary and a branch manager ' s desk , which was bigger than a marketing manager ' s desk. &quot; &quot; To be a branch manager in the old days was to get the big corner office , &quot; she said . &quot; That was a big deal. &quot; These days , Bodden works_out of clients ' offices , assisted by a car phone , beeper and a laptop_computer . When she checks_into the Cranford , N.J. , IBM office every two weeks , she shares a small cubicle in an open space . It was , she said , a &quot; cultural change. &quot; Five thousand of IBM ' s 125 # 000 U.S. employees have similarly been forced to become mobile in the past few years , and IBM plans to double that number . Many share secretaries and take turns using a sort of communal desk .</TEXT>
