   <HEADLINE> IN NOD TO JORDAN , U.S. MOVES TO END BLOCKADE OF RED_SEA ; MIDEAST : ALLIES ENFORCING EMBARGO AGAINST IRAQ WILL ALLOW SHIPS TO BE INSPECTED IN PORT BY PRIVATE FIRM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a political gesture to Jordan , the Clinton_Administration took the first_steps Tuesday toward ending the allied naval_blockade of the Red_Sea that has been used to enforce the U.N. embargo against Iraq . In a terse announcement , the Pentagon said the Navy will temporarily suspend its inspection of merchant vessels outside the Jordanian port of Aqaba and instead allow agents of Lloyd ' s Register , a London-based firm , to verify contents of vessels after they dock . The move , requested formally by King Hussein , came_in the wake of Jordan ' s peace accord with Israel last month and rapidly improving diplomatic and economic relations between the two countries . If the onshore inspections prove satisfactory in a monthlong test , the United States and its U.N. allies will end their naval_blockade in the Red_Sea area and turn the operation over to Lloyd ' s , officials said . U.S. and allied warships will continue to enforce their 4-year-old naval_blockade against Iraq in the Persian_Gulf , which , like the Red_Sea , serves as a major sea_lane for cargo_ships carrying goods to Iraq . The embargo , imposed just before the Persian_Gulf_War , was initially designed to persuade Iraq to leave after it invaded Kuwait in August , 1990 . It was continued after the war to ensure that Iraq did not rebuild its arsenal . The allies began intercepting ships outside Aqaba after U.S. intelligence agencies suggested Jordan may have been helping Iraq get_around the embargo . Hussein was critical of the allied offensive against Iraq , calling it a war against all Arabs . Ending the interdiction of ships bound to and from Aqaba has long been a goal of Jordan , which has regarded the operation as an encroachment on its sovereignty and a slap in the face politically . Washington ' s relations with Jordan have warmed considerably since Hussein made_peace with Israel , and President Clinton is now asking Congress to write_off Amman ' s almost $ 700-million debt and sell Jordan more military spare_parts . The Defense_Department said the United States and the 13 other allied countries participating in the naval embargo have intercepted 21 # 392 vessels in the Red_Sea and Persian_Gulf and have boarded 9 # 710 of them since the blockade was imposed Aug . 18 , 1990 . Of the vessels boarded , about 500 have been diverted , mostly because their manifest papers were not in_order or because their cargo holds were inaccessible , the Pentagon said . Most were cleared after closer inspection . Pentagon officials said U.S. naval vessels will continue to conduct routine patrols in the Red_Sea area , as they have for years , even if the job of enforcing the embargo against Iraq is moved ashore . The area serves as a strategic naval hub for the entire region . Israel and Jordan are negotiating bilateral agreements on issues ranging from providing_for joint management of the Dead_Sea to setting_up more border crossings for tourists . U.S. participation in the Red_Sea and Persian_Gulf enforcement operation has involved 84 Navy and Coast Guard vessels , mostly frigates , destroyers and amphibious_assault ships , the Pentagon said .</TEXT>
