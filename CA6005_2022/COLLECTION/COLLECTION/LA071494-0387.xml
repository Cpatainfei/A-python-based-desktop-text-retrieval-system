   <HEADLINE> FROM PLAIN POOCHES TO TOP_DOGS ; THINK THESE SHOWSTOPPERS WAKE_UP LOOKIN ' GOOD ? NOPE . THINK TIME AND CASH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> King , black and big-chested , tugs at the bib around his neck . His nose is dripping , and the runoff threatens to ruin his coat before he re-enters the show ring . The 110-pound bouvier suddenly sits_up , looks daggers at a stranger , snorts and flops back_down on his grooming table . Meanwhile , in the surrounding shady park , Irish_setters in do-rags , Afghans in snoods and chows that take_after Don King sit patiently in chin_straps for their final touch-ups . These beauties and dozens more are being shampooed , cream-rinsed , blow-dried , hair-sprayed and powdered into world-class creatures for the Kennel Club of Pasadena ' s recent California Classics show . Some dogs will go_through just about anything , even wear hair extensions , to get the judges to notice . Of course , only a small percentage of the 52.5 million dogs in America would put_up with such a routine . Fussing over almost every_last one was a professional handler -- a dog jockey who makes a living creating winners . Rich backers often foot the bills -- it can cost $ 100 # 000 a year or more to campaign a dog on the show circuit -- in return for the trophies , fame and possible future stud fees . &quot; It ' s an ego thing , &quot; says exhibitor-groomer Andrew V . Castro of Claremont . &quot; It ' s a contest about my dog ' s prettier than yours. &quot; Those unfamiliar_with the workings of the thousands of AKC all-breed and specialty shows held each year can ' t imagine the spraying , peroxiding and powdering that goes_on . &quot; You don ' t want to stand too close to the collie people , &quot; one exhibitor cautions . &quot; You ' ll cough from all_the chalk ( used to whiten their coats ) . &quot; But even dogs without perfect pedigrees , and their owners , can benefit from the beauty secrets of champions . Before you know it , a hang-dog doggy can be transformed into a mutt that looks_like a_million . Because the beauty of the show dog circuit is skin deep -- &quot; Yes , &quot; judges say , &quot; even corgis are beautiful &quot; -- there ' s probably no better place to start the metamorphosis than with a shampoo and a trim . &quot; I go_to dog_shows every weekend to see what ' s out there , the trends , &quot; says Castro , who just returned from the prestigious Poodle Nationals in Pennsylvania . &quot; In the ' 50s and ' 60s , poodles had tremendous coats . Now , the cuts are shorter and tighter , to show more leg. &quot; Castro -- the owner of a boxer , seven Maltese and eight poodles -- says a good haircut can help camouflage imperfections . &quot; Grooming is an optical_illusion , &quot; he says . The right hair-care regimen can also do wonders for a dog ' s dimensions . Penny Krebs , who shows her Labrador_retrievers -- Tugs , Gus and Jet -- says some Lab owners trim around the toes and throat to give their short-haired pooches more definition . &quot; My youngest is too leggy and scrawny , &quot; she says , adding that judges like Labs to look_like Rottweilers . &quot; I ' m always trying to figure_out ways to build_up his coat so he looks beefier. &quot; Krebs relies_on texturizing shampoos , sprays and blow-drying to add bulk to her dog . An Alaskan malamute breeder from Arizona whose dogs always show_up in enviably thick coats had everyone wondering her secret . &quot; Turns_out they are house dogs , and she sets the air conditioning at 50 degrees , &quot; Krebs says . &quot; Her electric_bills are huge. &quot; * If time were money , the keepers of cocker_spaniels might be spending even more . Blow-drying alone takes about three hours , says Stephanie Archuleta , a Lancaster breeder and handler . &quot; If you go_to any dog_show , you can automatically pick_out a total novice by how they groom their dogs , &quot; she says . &quot; I feel real bad for them because judges don ' t look twice . How could they ? Here ' s a dog all crinkled and wrinkled versus full and fluffy. &quot; To achieve the latter , she starts with sopping wet spaniels . &quot; It ' s all hand brushing , &quot; she says , &quot; from the tip of their nose to the tip of their tail. &quot; Archuleta also brushes and combs her darlings every day , not only to stimulate hair growth but also to establish a meaningful relationship . &quot; Some people will say , ' My dog hates to be brushed , ' &quot; she says . &quot; I ' ll ask , ' How often do you do_it ? ' And they say , ' When I see a tangle. ' Well , I ' d hate it too. &quot; Louise McCann , handler and owner of three coarse-haired bouvier des Flandres , mists their coats with water daily and uses a lanolin conditioner on the dogs ' faces , stomachs and legs twice a week to maintain their coats , which can ' t get enough moisture , moisture , moisture . Troublesome , too , are the long , silky Afghan coats . El Cajon residents Rosemary and Bruce Sutton , who have been breeding and showing champions for 25 years , designed a line of products for hairy hounds . Sutton warns against using human shampoo on critters . &quot; A dog ' s pH balance and a human ' s are totally different , so it ' s better to use a good dog shampoo , &quot; she says , adding that she once worked as a hairdresser with Vidal Sassoon . &quot; So that ' s where my hair knowledge -- and probably fetish -- came from. &quot; Although Afghans are known as the &quot; dumb blondes &quot; of the dog world ( the recent book &quot; The Intelligence of Dogs &quot; rated them dead last ) , Sutton defends the breed . &quot; They are keen hunters and there ' s nothing froufrou about them . They just happen to be beautiful. &quot; That said , Sutton touts the snood as a fashion accessory for the glamorous creatures . It keeps hair out of dog_food and helps prevent hair breakage . She also recommends using hair clips to keep the full belly hair off the ground , and wrapping deli paper , secured with rubber_bands , around the ears to keep them clean . Hot oil treatments , cream rinse , corn starch ( for blotting oily hair ) , Avon Skin So Soft ( for fleas and ticks ) and a meaty diet ( &quot; what feeds hair is blood , &quot; she says ) make_for a shiny coat . * To stay in shape , Afghans and other breeds work_out on the Jog-a-Dog , the canine kingdom ' s answer to a StairMaster . Archuleta ' s pampered spaniels , on the other hand , are definitely not Susan Powter types . The only insanity they want stopped is their 3 a.m. wake-up call_for dog_shows . They demand their beauty_sleep . &quot; Twenty minutes in the back yard and they look_at me as if to ask , ' Mom , can we go ? ' &quot; Archuleta says . The use of stage makeup also varies from breed to breed . Castro recommends using clown makeup for pink-faced poodles : first a cream , then a powder . And then , maybe , a little eyeliner . &quot; It makes the cutest little China doll face . You just have to make_sure most of it is rubbed_off because when the judge goes_over ( touches ) the animal , he ' d better not get any on his hands . You can be disqualified for that. &quot; Indeed , there ' s a fine line between accepting a dog for what it is and tampering with Mother Nature . But no one seems to agree on exactly where the line should be drawn . Despite the objections of animal rights activists , for example , the AKC allows ear cropping and tail docking . Yet it forbids the use of hair_spray . Anthony Shipp , a Beverly Hills veterinarian who specializes in animal dentistry ( yes , some dogs wear braces ) declines to do cosmetic_dentistry . Any reputable vet would , he says . &quot; One guy wanted four gold fangs put_on his Dobie ( Doberman_pinscher ) , just because he wanted his dog to look different . I said , ' No . We won ' t do_it just for show. ' &quot; One of the world ' s 27 board-certified veterinary dentists , Shipp says a dog ' s teeth should be brushed daily . &quot; Nice sparkling teeth , &quot; he says , &quot; is a good beauty secret. &quot; As an AKC judge for 28 years , Harry Smith of Durham , N.C. , has seen and heard just about everything : dogs with implants , dogs with hair extensions , dogs with nose tattoos to fill_in blotches . &quot; Most of it is illegal , &quot; he says . Still , he doesn ' t think a little hair_spray and corn starch are all that bad . &quot; I don ' t diligently search it out . I treat ( the issue ) like makeup and hair_spray on a lady . I would hate to see a woman ' s hair drooping down around her shoulders and her makeup bad -- so some of it , if it ' s not done to extremes , is not reasonable. &quot; That doesn ' t mean he won ' t disqualify a phony . &quot; I usually search for implants on dogs whose ears are tipped to make_sure they aren ' t weighted down with lead , &quot; he says . On some dogs , such_as collies , the top of the ear should naturally tip forward . &quot; But I haven ' t found any yet. &quot; Speaking of implants , it seems another judge came_across an odd case involving a dog with three testicles . Turned_out the animal had only one , so his owner paid_for cosmetic_surgery . Then , the dog ' s missing testicle dropped . &quot; Now that , &quot; Smith says , &quot; is something I would catch. &quot;</TEXT>
