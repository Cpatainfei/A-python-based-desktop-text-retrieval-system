   <HEADLINE> RISK ESTIMATE RAISED FOR THOSE IN BREAST_CANCER STUDY ; MEDICINE : MOVE REVIVES CONTROVERSY OVER GOVERNMENT-FUNDED TRIAL OF PREVENTIVE USE OF TAMOXIFEN . BUT DOCTORS INVOLVED IN WORK SAY REVISIONS ARE MINOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Leaders of a highly anticipated study examining the drug tamoxifen ' s ability to prevent breast_cancer say they are changing the consent form provided to the 16 # 000 women enrolled in the trial because of new data that confirms the drug may cause other cancers . Although the revisions are considered minor by most doctors involved , the move revives a longstanding controversy over the $ 68-million , government-funded study , called the Breast_Cancer Prevention Trial . The study is one of the first to examine whether it is beneficial to give healthy people a potentially toxic drug to prevent disease . Outside of the study , tamoxifen is only given to women who have had breast_cancer to thwart a recurrence . The new data on risks is collected from studies on breast_cancer patients that began in 1981 . In the prevention study , which began two years ago , healthy women at high risk for breast_cancer are randomly assigned to take either a daily 20-milligram dose of tamoxifen or a placebo for at least five years . Study leaders have always acknowledged that the drug may increase a woman ' s risk of developing uterine or liver cancer and blood_clots but they do not know whether the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks . The revised consent form nudges estimates of those risks up a notch . The revisions are based on data from a long-term , nationwide study of breast_cancer patients taking tamoxifen , said Dr. Bernard Fisher , a University of Pittsburgh surgeon who collected the data . Fisher , who is also a principal_investigator in the prevention trial , said the new data will be published in full later this year in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute . But the data have already translated into a change in the consent form given to women in the prevention trial . According to Fisher , the risk of developing uterine cancer is similar to what was originally predicted : about two cases per 1 # 000 -- a rate that , while small , is still three times higher than that faced by women in the general population . Moreover , study leaders say that data on the breast_cancer patients already taking the drug shows there have been a_few deaths from uterine cancer . Participants in the preventive study were previously told that the cases of uterine cancer that have occurred were caught at an early stage and were thought to be curable . The risk of developing thrombosis or phlebitis , both of which can produce life-threatening blood_clots , has been adjusted slightly from 1.3 % to 1.5 % . ( Similar-aged women not taking tamoxifen have a 0.4 % chance of developing blood_clotting disorders. ) The risk of developing liver cancer has also been changed . Previously , study leaders said liver cancer had been reported in rats receiving tamoxifen but not in humans . Now , researchers say two women in a Swedish study of tamoxifen have developed liver cancer . But , Fisher said : &quot; I think this ( potential risk ) has been blown_out of proportion . . . . In the thousands of women we ' ve given tamoxifen , we have never seen liver cancer. &quot; Overall , Fisher said , he believes the risks are still considered to be worth the potential benefits . About 180 # 000 American women are found to have breast_cancer each year and about 46 # 000 die of the disease , according to the American Cancer Society . The consent form revisions , Fisher said , &quot; are part of an educational update to keep our investigators and patients informed . This is not a situation where we suddenly found something that frightened us. &quot; Although study participants will be told of the changes , the revisions are not significant , said Dr. Patricia Ganz , who is conducting part of the study with a group of women at UCLA . But critics of the study say that the changes reflect a deep uncertainty about the risks and benefits of the drug . &quot; This is definitely a shift in the risk-benefit ratio , way into this study , &quot; said Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota . &quot; It gets_at the general question of , ' Is this thing too risky to do ? ' &quot; And in a paper published in September , Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Trudy Bush predicted nearly twice the risk of uterine and liver cancer as that predicted by the study organizers . Tamoxifen is also known to sometimes cause less severe side_effects , such_as hot_flashes , menstrual irregularities and nausea . In the new consent form , women are also informed that the drug may cause ovarian_cysts and hair thinning . Moreover , the revised form contains a more detailed warning to women of child-bearing age to use effective contraceptives during the trial due_to the risk of fetal damage if the drug is taken during pregnancy .</TEXT>
