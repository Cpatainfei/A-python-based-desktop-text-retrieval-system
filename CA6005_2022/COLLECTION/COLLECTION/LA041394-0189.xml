   <HEADLINE> THE BENEFITS OF THE PART-TIMER ; THEY ARE FEW , WHICH UNIONS SAY THREATENS FULL-TIME JOBS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For 17 1 / 2 years , Morley Cohen thrived in his full-time job as a liquor salesman , enjoying his San Fernando Valley route and living comfortably on an annual income of about $ 45 # 000 . But late last year , it all fell part . Cohen ' s employer shut_down , and he was forced to scramble to come_up with part-time sales work . His income shriveled , and he lost his company-paid health_care benefits . &quot; It ' s a shocker after that many years to leave with nothing , &quot; said Cohen , 63 . &quot; Any way I can make a dollar , I ' ll make a dollar. &quot; In an era of heightened job insecurity , the image of such a fall from a well-paying , full-time position to a marginal part-time job haunts many workers . And the fact that adding part-time jobs often threatens the wages , benefits and economic security of full-time workers has spurred many unions to fight companies moving_in that direction . In fact , one of the key triggers that sparked the nationwide strike launched by the Teamsters Union last week against 22 trucking_companies was the employers ' proposal to start using lower-paid , part-time dock_workers . In some industries , labor_leaders regard part-timers as union busters . In a strike , part-timers can sometimes step into the jobs of those on the picket_line . Full-timers &quot; fear that they ' re training their own replacements , &quot; said Dale Belman , a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute . Even apart from strikes , Belman added , the lower wages and benefits often paid to part-timers provide &quot; a very strong dynamic for firms to reduce the number of full-time workers and replace them with part-timers. &quot; Part-timers are hard to organize , and , especially if they hope to move_up to full-time positions , they are likely to be far more reluctant to challenge management . Yet the vision of legions of employers demoting workers from full time to part time , or laying_off full-time workers to make room for lower-paid part-timers , masks a more complicated pattern in the U.S. economy . To be sure , part-timers generally receive substantially fewer benefits and often lower hourly pay than their full-time counterparts . In addition , the number of &quot; involuntary &quot; part-timers -- people who hold part-time jobs because they can ' t find full-time work -- has climbed over the years , although they still account_for less than a third of all part-time workers . Moreover , there has been a boom in a related type of worker -- temporary employees -- who also have less than a full-time stake in the companies employing them . But over the last two decades , Labor_Department figures show there has been no surge of part-timers pushing full-time workers out of their jobs . The number of part-timers shot_up over that period , but the ranks of people working 35 hours or more a week rose almost as quickly . From 1973 to 1993 , the percentage of working people holding part-time jobs rose only slightly , from 16.6 % to 18.8 % , with involuntary part-timers accounting_for the increase . The key issue , according to Georgetown University labor economist Stanley D . Nollen , is not that part-timers are replacing full-time workers but that &quot; part-time people aren ' t being treated equitably. &quot; While government statistics show that part-timers earn much less than full-timers , part of the reason is that part-time jobs are more prevalent in low-paying industries such_as restaurants and retailing . Still , even when efforts are made to compare part-time and full-time workers in similar jobs , a big gap remains . For instance , according to the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute , women working part-time in administrative support and clerical jobs earn 16.5 % less per hour than their full-time counterparts . And 25.6 % of women who work part time and head households receive health_care benefits , compared to 74 % of similar women working full time . Not everyone , of course , sees working part time as a hardship . Part-time jobs can be a boon to students putting themselves through college , parents trying to balance the demands of work and family , and moonlighters looking_for extra income . Periodically over the years , employers and unions have clashed over proposals to add part-time workers . Supermarket and transportation businesses have led the way , largely because they have distinct busy and slack work periods . &quot; In any industry you pick where there isn ' t a_level work flow , you ' re going to get those pressures from management , &quot; said Daniel J.B. Mitchell , a UCLA labor economist . But Mitchell noted that one factor that could reverse the trend is health_care reform . He explained that if employers are required to provide health_insurance for all workers , full and part time , that could provide more of an economic incentive to rely more on full-timers . At the same time , part-time jobs can be a boon to companies and their employees , enabling firms to stay in business by holding_down labor costs and using their work_force more efficiently . Since the trucking_industry was deregulated in the 1980s , non-union truckers have enjoyed that kind of flexibility , taking business from union carriers , said Charles P . O ' Connor , general counsel for Trucking Management Inc. , the organization representing the companies struck by the Teamsters . &quot; We need to reduce costs , &quot; O ' Connor said . He later added : &quot; We ' re trying to protect Teamster jobs too . . . . We ' re their last , best hope to maintain a presence in the trucking industry. &quot; But for union leaders , bringing_in part-time workers carries symbolic as well as economic importance . Teamsters President Ron Carey , championing his union ' s cause , has argued that &quot; Americans are_sick and tired_of seeing corporations slashing good jobs and replacing them with low-paying , part-time jobs. &quot; Thomas Geoghegan , an author and labor lawyer who has represented the Teamsters , said that when part-timers make inroads in traditionally high-paying and highly unionized industries such_as trucking and airlines , it is particularly significant . &quot; It ' s a warning sign of a deteriorating standard_of_living , &quot; he said . Working Part Time Although most people who work part time do so out of personal preference , for many people it can be a bad deal . Hourly pay and benefits are substantially lower for part time workers . INVOLUNTARILY PART TIME People working part time not because they could not find full-time jobs ( non-agricultural employment , in millions ) : 1973 : 2.34 1974 : 2.75 1975 : 3.54 1976 : 3.33 1977 : 3.37 1978 : 3.30 1979 : 3.37 1980 : 4.06 1981 : 4.50 1982 : 5.85 1983 : 6.00 1984 : 5.51 1985 : 5.33 1986 : 5.35 1987 : 5.12 1988 : 4.97 1989 : 4.66 1990 : 4.86 1991 : 5.77 1992 : 6.12 1993 : 6.11 PAY Median hourly wage for part time workers is lower ( figures are for 1993 ) All workers : $ 7.92 Full time workers : $ 8.89 Part time workers : $ 5.55 BENEFITS Percent of employees participating in selected benefit plans in 1990-91 03 # 33 , 11 # 11 Benefit Full Time Part Time Paid holidays 85 % 35 % Paid vacations 88 37 Sickness and accident insurance 33 13 Long-term disability_insurance 29 2 Medical_care 79 17 Dental care 48 10 Source : Labor_Department</TEXT>
