   <HEADLINE> VALLEY COMMENTARY ; ILLEGALS VS . LEGALS : CLOSED DOORS , OPEN ARMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reps . Anthony Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) and Howard Berman ( D-Panorama City ) , whose congressional_districts include most of the San Fernando Valley , discussed illegal immigration on March 30 at a luncheon_meeting sponsored by the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn . What follows is adapted from their remarks . BEILENSON We are a very liberal and generous country when it comes_to legal immigration . We are currently allowing almost a_million people legally into this country each year , more people than all_of the rest of the countries of the world combined . I continue to believe very strongly in legal immigration . When it comes_to illegal immigration , the question at the outset is : Do we believe_in our immigration laws or not ? If we do , we should allow the 850 # 000 to 1 million people in legally each year but not the others who are coming illegally . There are lots of reasons to be worried about illegal immigration . I have predicted for years that if we did not get control over illegal immigration there would be a backlash against legal immigration , and I think unfortunately that ' s occurring . I think it ' s also obvious to any thinking man or woman that there ' s a limit to the number of people whom we can take_in and provide_for . But there is no end to the number of people who want to come_to the United States and other industrialized nations . The populations of Central_America and Mexico have virtually quadrupled in the last 40 years . Mexico had 26 million people at the end of World_War_II . Now there are 92 million . There will be close to a quarter of a_billion Mexicans sometime late next century . These folks obviously don ' t have enough jobs down there , and many of them come here , looking_for a better life . In 24 hours there will be 260 # 000 net new people in the world , more_than 95 % of them in developing countries that cannot provide adequate jobs , services , health_care or education for their people . * I believe that many of our services -- our social_services , our educational services , our health_care services , our welfare services -- are being overwhelmed . I spend virtually all_of my time when I ' m home going_around talking to teachers , welfare_workers , nurses who dispense these services . Their plea to me always is , Congressman , please try to do something about illegal immigration . We don ' t have the physical or the human resources to take_care of the citizens whom we ' re supposed to take_care of . The net costs of illegal immigration are rising quickly . Some of these costs : * At least $ 2 billion a year in California to educate children who are here illegally . * At least $ 400 million a year in California to incarcerate prisoners here illegally . * At least $ 300 million a year to provide emergency health services to people who are here illegally . * At least $ 250 million in Los Angeles County alone for Aid to Families With Dependent Children for children of illegals . I think 25 % of all_the kids on AFDC in Los Angeles County are children of illegals . The county says that by the end of the decade it ' s going_to cost $ 1 billion a year . If you ' re serious about this and you ' re a politician , you ' ve got_to propose solutions . I think there are only three serious ones , and a fourth that is more long-range and has to do with helping slow population growth around the world by making contraceptive services available to people if they want them . * One , you ' ve got_to control the border better , and the very least we can do , and it will have an effect , is put a good many_more human_beings and equipment down at the Border_Patrol . It ' s always been the stepchild of our law_enforcement system . Two , the single most important thing we should do is to have a counterfeit-resistant and tamper-proof Social_Security card that has to be presented before you get employed in this country . There is no other way of enforcing our existing law , which makes_it illegal to knowingly hire someone who is here illegally , or of ending discrimination against people who aren ' t here illegally but have darker skins and don ' t speak perfect English . Three , and I know it offends some people , I do believe that we have to change the Constitution . We have to change the 14th Amendment and no longer give automatic citizenship to children of people who knowingly violated our laws and came_across our borders , often not to get jobs but to have their babies here . More and more people are coming_to have their babies here . There are 30 # 000 babies illegally born in Los Angeles County each year who automatically are U.S. citizens . We ' re giving a benefit , an incentive to do_it . There was a specific reason for that provision of the 14th Amendment . It was ratified three years after the end of the Civil War for the specific purpose of trying to ensure that the newly freed black slaves would have all_of the privileges and benefits of citizenship . That was the sole reason for it . * We had no immigration law at the time . Nobody ever thought_about it . And if we had had the problem then , nobody would have put that in the Constitution . To automatically grant citizenship to anybody born here , even children of travelers who happen to have a baby while they ' re traveling around the United States -- that ' s nonsense . Only three or four other countries in the world do_it . We will not be a less-free , less-democratic , less-wonderful , less-generous country if we repeal that particular part of the Constitution . We still have the Bill of Rights , free speech , everything else . There is nothing special about automatic citizenship because you happen to be born in this country . BERMAN I agree with Tony on his first and second solutions . If we do them , his third isn ' t necessary . By amending the Constitution we would create a clouded citizenship status for thousands of people and raise a_thousand specific questions that I haven ' t seen anyone address : When a mother shows_up at the maternity ward , are we going_to have an INS official there ? What documentation would we demand ? If we develop an effective border strategy and effective national identification , citizenship at birth will no longer be a serious issue . I want to put some of this in the context of what is going_on in society today . There are some very serious problems in this country . At such times we tend to look_for scapegoats . Immigration is a tremendously tempting scapegoat because it is true that we have lost_control of our borders . We have every right to try to control those borders , and I do not accept the premise that it is impossible to do so . I think the most serious problem in this country today is the existence of a growing underclass in our society . This is not just an immigrant underclass . It ' s an underclass of people who essentially have very little in common with the mainstream of American society , who do not accept the values and the fundamental responsibilities of citizenship in this country . This underclass is not caused by immigration . It ' s the result of many complicated social problems , including a well-intentioned welfare system that created a cycle of dependency , that have resulted in a breakdown of the family and a loss of individual responsibility . * We have a terrible problem with crime . And contrary to the current political rhetoric , this is not a problem that ' s primarily a result of immigration . I ' d suggest that the crime_rate in Los Angeles is more a product of the fact that we have by far the most understaffed Police_Department of any major urban_area in the United States . We have a serious economic problem in Southern California , caused by many factors , ranging from defense cuts_to a depressed real_estate industry . Added_to this , we have suffered a number of natural disasters that have contributed to the decline in living standards in our community . But I don ' t want to take_away from the fact that illegal immigration is wrong . It ' s unfair . It has consequences that we cannot anticipate and which produce burdens on our institutions , and we have to try to stop it . I think we can do this with the focus_on the border-crossing problem and a national , effective , forge-proof identification system which includes tough laws to make_sure that the privacy of individuals is not invaded . We cannot institute an identification system that is required to walk the streets or to pursue any of the privileges of participation in our society . It must be very carefully limited and circumscribed to cover everyone ' s eligibility for employment and certain public programs . But we can do_it . Once this is implemented , we ' ll have an instrument with which immigration laws can be enforced . * I would also like to know why with all_the great attention on illegal immigration , no one has taken a systematic look_at the several industries in our state that live_on their efforts to recruit , transport and exploit workers from across the border . Agriculture in this state survives on a large pool of undocumented immigrants ' displacing the earlier generation of undocumented workers who have legalized and who are , therefore , asking_for more money and better conditions and are moving_into urban_areas . A great strength of Southern California is its legal immigrant population . Look_at the vibrant industries in our area , industries that are growing , small and middle-sized entrepreneurs . Many of them are immigrant owned and staffed . Many of them bring skills and technologies and a work ethic unparalleled in our own society . They ' re going to add_to the strength of America .</TEXT>
