   <HEADLINE> HOME COOK : TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Home cooking is becoming an endangered skill . Every day fewer people take a_couple_of basic ingredients and make them into a nice meal . Is it because so many adults are working outside the house and come_home too tired to fix meals from scratch ? Step by step , we have accepted cooking shortcuts -- canned_foods , box mixes , frozen foods , microwave_ovens , take-out -- to make dinner easier . But in the process , much of what Americans eat has become impersonal , mass-produced food . For the end result of all this time-saving has not been more time with our families but the opposite , the end of the communal table . Today , for many people the dinner hour is 15 minutes of eating alone -- standing , walking or driving . This is the great loss , far more important than not having a home-cooked meal . We have lost our greatest opportunity for daily communal life , the vital element of being nourished and civilized at a shared table . The best hope we have to cure this loss is to teach our children to cook simple , real food . I emphasize real food . Don ' t entertain them by sculpting animals out of cookie dough ; in teaching many children ' s cooking classes , I have found they are naturally fascinated with cooking . The transformation of raw ingredients is magic . One egg can do amazing things . * The following recipes can easily be done_by children aged 7 through 11 -- and older , of course . Watch and advise the child in the beginning because of the danger of cuts and burns . Of course , children don ' t like pain any more_than adults , but they quickly learn to be careful . And their own home-crafted food will be genuinely appreciated by the other members of the household . This is the best way to bring the family together once again . * This recipe can easily be doubled or tripled , but it is purposely done_in a small amount as a beginning lesson . The best knife for beginners is a serrated paring_knife with deep grooves that grip the vegetable for slicing . SIMPLE VEGETABLE_SOUP 2 tablespoons butter 1 small onion , cut_in half lengthwise and chopped into small pieces 1 small carrot , peeled , cut_into slices 1 rib of celery , rinsed and sliced Salt 2 cups chicken_broth 1 small tomato , stem end cut_out and chopped 1 small zucchini , stem ends cut_away and sliced Pepper Melt butter in 1 1 / 2-quart saucepan . Swirl pan around so butter covers bottom . Add onion , carrot and celery . Season to taste with salt . Cook over medium heat , stirring often , about 5 minutes . Add broth and tomato . Simmer over low heat 10 minutes , stirring often . Add zucchini . Cook 3 minutes . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Serve soup hot . Makes 6 servings . Each serving contains about : 66 calories ; 360 mg sodium ; 11 mg cholesterol ; 4 grams fat ; 5 grams carbohydrates ; 2 grams protein ; 0.49 gram fiber . * It ' s important to not only rinse lettuce leaves but to dry them before dressing ; if you don ' t , the dressing won ' t coat the leaves . Always use a large salad_bowl so there is plenty of room to toss the leaves with the dressing . Serve the salad right away after tossing ; salads kept with dressing on lose their crispness . BASIC LETTUCE SALAD Lettuce leaves , about 8 cups Basic Oil and Vinegar Dressing Salt , pepper , optional Rinse lettuce and dry with paper_towels . Put into large salad_bowl . Cover with damp paper_towel . Cover bowl and refrigerate . Just before serving salad , sprinkle about 1 / 2 of Basic Oil and Vinegar Dressing all around top of lettuce . Toss well using 2 large spoons . Add more Dressing , if desired . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Makes 4 servings . Each serving contains about : 120 calories ; 148 mg sodium ; trace cholesterol ; 14 grams fat ; trace carbohydrates ; trace protein ; trace fiber . Basic Oil and Vinegar Dressing 2 teaspoons lemon_juice 2 teaspoons cider_vinegar 1 / 4 teaspoon salt 1 / 4 cup olive_oil 2 tablespoons water Put lemon_juice and cider_vinegar into 1-cup jar with lid . Add salt . Let mixture stand 1 minute . Then put lid on jar and shake well . Remove lid , add olive_oil and water . Put lid back on and shake jar to mix dressing . BAKED VANILLA CUSTARD Butter 2 egg yolks 3 eggs 1 / 2 cup sugar 1 / 8 teaspoon salt 3 cups very hot milk 2 teaspoons vanilla Butter 1-quart baking dish or 8 custard cups . Set shallow pan large enough to hold baking dish or custard cups in 325-degree oven and add 1 inch hot water . Put egg_yolks and eggs in bowl . Beat with fork until completely blended . Add sugar and salt . Stir until mixed in . Add hot milk , little at time , stirring with spoon until all milk is blended into egg mixture . Add vanilla and stir . Strain custard mixture into 1 quart or larger measuring cup or pitcher . Pour custard mixture into baking dish or custard cups . Take pan of hot water from oven , put cups or baking dish carefully into it , put pan back in oven and bake until custard is set , about 45 minutes . Custard is done when knife inserted in center comes_out almost clean . Remove from oven . Serve warm . Or let custard cool , then cover and refrigerate until serving . Makes 8 servings .
