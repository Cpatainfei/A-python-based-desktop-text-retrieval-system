   <TEXT> His new blue suit pressed , his lone suitcase perched hopefully nearby , the man who called himself Kanda Koso patiently awaited his fate . After trying to get_through immigration at the sprawling Schiphol Airport with a false Zairian passport , the self-described 26-year-old shoemaker promptly declared that he wanted political asylum . Now he sat in a corner of the empty immigration area as Dutch authorities discussed his fate and tried to determine if he really was from Zaire . &quot; I like it here , &quot; he said in barely audible French . &quot; I want to stay. &quot; Although he had traveled far and gambled much to reach the threshold of a new , glittering world , it seemed unlikely that Koso would taste more of it than the airport -- and the sandwich and soda that the airport police brought him a_few hours into his wait . Koso was about to run_into a hard new truth that confronts the would-be migrants who continue to stream into Western Europe from the former Soviet Bloc and developing nations : Rules governing both routine immigration and political asylum have tightened drastically . And , increasingly , the stories that once were enough to spirit them into a land of affluence and opportunity do not work anymore . As Europe ' s rich social_democracies close their doors , one of the primary destinations of global migration and one of its oldest political sanctuaries is being choked_off . And as Western Europe ' s border police_forces grow , a murky industry now works to spirit foreigners around them . A worrisome subculture has sprouted that by definition exists outside the law , forcing illegal immigrants to survive on black_market income or crime . &quot; All ( West European ) countries are restricting asylum procedures and the right_of_entry , &quot; said Petra Catz , who deals with refugee questions at Amnesty International ' s office here . The tightening mainly grows out of political pressure from a public frightened that the influx of outsiders threatens prosperity as well as social cohesion . Recession and high unemployment have only strengthened these feelings . More_than ever , residents of Europe ' s rich countries believe the German right-wing anti-immigrant slogan , &quot; The Boat Is Full. &quot; Reacting to this mood , the German government last year ended its once-cherished policy of open asylum and began turning_away -- for the first time since the Weimar era -- foreigners claiming to be victims of political persecution . Interior Minister Charles Pasqua has created a new police_force to patrol France ' s borders and lead a crackdown on illegal immigrants . Sweden has tightened its visa requirements and its definition of a political refugee . When developments in these countries shifted pressure to smaller nations , such_as Belgium and the_Netherlands , they too acted . Social_scientists here claim that this regional clampdown carries with it two serious dangers . First , accelerated measures for dealing with asylum-seekers are effectively limiting access to one of the oldest and most important havens from political persecution . &quot; To put it bluntly , the rights of refugees are being undermined , &quot; Swedish Parliament member Hans Goeran Franck told the Council of Europe ' s parliamentary assembly last month in Strasbourg , France . &quot; There is an urgent need for action. &quot; The fact that the crackdown in Europe comes as anti-immigration sentiments gather force in North_America has only magnified its impact . Said Amnesty International ' s Catz , &quot; We ' re worried that people are being sent_back to persecution. &quot; Second , social_scientists argue , the crackdown carries the seeds of a major social problem for Europe itself . They are convinced that new government measures will not stop migration but merely force it underground . That development , they say , is bound to create a spawning ground for crime , drugs and other illegal activities . &quot; We ' ve argued against closing the door , because you just replace one problem with another that ' s even worse , &quot; said Dennis Dejong , a specialist on immigration policy at the European Commission in Brussels . &quot; What ' s not understood is that this whole issue can undermine the fabric of society. &quot; Many argue that this is already happening . While there are no reliable figures on the number of illegal immigrants in Western Europe , there is little dispute that it is rising . In the_Netherlands , few were even aware of the problem until an El Al jumbo jet crashed into an Amsterdam apartment_house in October , 1992 , and many victims on the ground turned_out to be illegal residents . Much as illegal immigrants do_in the United States , Western Europe ' s &quot; non-people &quot; find low-paying , black_market jobs , often as restaurant kitchen help or farm laborers , or they are forced into petty crime . &quot; In many parts of Europe , the agricultural sector can no longer function without cheap illegals , &quot; Dejong said . Human_rights advocates argue that the new tightening of legal entry will further alter the region ' s demographics . Frits Florin , a senior policy adviser to the Dutch Refugee Council here , talks_of an invisible line that now runs_through Western Europe . It separates a group of mainly Mediterranean countries , which have given_up trying to regulate access and simply slammed the door even on most forms of legal immigration , from nations farther north that still struggle to sort legal from illegal migrants . Portugal , Greece , Spain and Italy are already behind this line , Florin claims . &quot; In Lisbon , the slums are_full of illegals from Angola and Mozambique , many of them de_facto war refugees in need of protection , but they don ' t ask_for asylum because they know they won ' t get_it , &quot; Florin said . Portugal , a country of 10.5 million people , has registered about 2 # 600 requests for political asylum since 1991 . In Italy , requests have dropped from more_than 26 # 000 in 1991 to fewer than 2 # 000 last year . What is happening , Florin argues , is that the line is moving north . Under pressure from a sullen public and a right-wing extremist backlash , Germany ' s mainstream political_parties last July agreed to scrap the right to unconditional political asylum granted under the post-World War II constitution . In tandem with this move , Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s government beefed_up its border police and hastily negotiated arrangements with neighboring Poland and the Czech Republic to take_back rejected asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants who try to enter Germany through those countries . Virtually overnight , Germany , the main destination of those seeking asylum in Western Europe , removed its welcome_mat . The results of the change have been abrupt and dramatic . The number of applicants registered by Germany ' s Interior Ministry during the first three months of this year fell by more_than 70 % from the same period last year . Some argue that in an election year , Kohl ' s government is content to ignore any rise in illegal entry and to point instead to its success in reducing asylum-seekers . In France , Pasqua has won public applause for tough measures aimed at controlling the influx of foreigners , including the formation of a police_force , the Directorate for the Control of Immigration and the Struggle Against Illegal Employment . The job of this new police_force will include tightening border checks and tracking_down illegal residents when it begins operating this spring . The new force is part of a broader crackdown that includes mandatory police interviews before any marriage involving a foreigner . This change prompted last summer ' s celebrated case involving Fabienne Bricet , 24 , who duly went_to the police with her Algerian fiance , only to see him expelled six days later because his residence permit had expired . The case burst into the headlines after he was barred from re-entering the country and the_French consulates in Algeria refused to marry them because they were not both French . It was resolved only when the government intervened to allow the marriage . Figures gathered by the European Council for Refugees and Exiles show that across the region , these and similar measures in other countries are having an impact . The number of asylum-seekers in 16 West European_countries dropped significantly last year from a 1992 high of 672 # 000 to 544 # 000 . These numbers are likely to drop further as other openings are gradually closed . In January , the_Netherlands , renowned as one of Europe ' s most tolerant societies , became the latest West European_nation to tighten its frontiers . The moves came_in an election year . New Dutch regulations to deal with asylum-seekers make_it possible to telescope a review procedure that once took years down to seven months for difficult cases and to just six weeks or even less if authorities are sure that the applicant ' s case is &quot; manifestly unfounded. &quot; Further , those migrants suspected to be clearly economic rather than political refugees are sent immediately to a detention house in Amsterdam , where they wait until their case is heard . With Justice Ministry officials now stationed at the airport , non-asylum-seekers suspected of trying to enter for illegal , longer-term stays can be expelled immediately . &quot; On simple visa requests , we can now turn them around on the same day , &quot; said Hilbrand Nawijn , director of the Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Service . &quot; They don ' t even leave the airport. &quot; New measures to control the country ' s land borders with Belgium and Germany -- borders where the march to a unified Europe has led to the removal of routine immigration and customs checks -- reflect the sense of desperation . This month , Nawijn has started deploying a series of flying squads a_few miles behind the frontier to swoop in on suspected illegal immigrants as they are picked_out by spotters stationed at the border crossings . Where possible , the plan calls_for those suspected of entering illegally to be photographed as they cross the frontier . The photos , Dutch authorities say , would prove where the would-be immigrants came from and , therefore , show which country must take them back . Human_rights advocates are appalled . &quot; What this all means is that if the police see a car full of blacks cross into the country , they send_out the flying squads , &quot; Florin said . &quot; This isn ' t what modern Europe is about . We ' re going backward. &quot; Increasingly , those dealing with the problem are convinced that only a coordinated effort among all_the region ' s countries can contain the problem . Dejong , the immigration specialist , talks_about harmonizing procedures among the 12 European Union states , sharing information and even coordinating foreign_aid to help stem the flow at its source . But he acknowledged there is a long way still to go . &quot; By definition , it ' s a slow process , &quot; he said . &quot; Civil servants are trained to defend their nation ' s sovereignty. &quot; Welcome Mat Revoked As West European_countries toughen their rules , the number of those seeking asylum has dropped . NUMBER OF ASYLUM REQUESTS 04 # 13 , 09 # 09 , 09 1991 1992 1993 Belgium 15 # 173 17 # 647 26 # 892 Britain 44 # 840 24 # 600 22 # 370 Denmark 4 # 609 13 # 876 14 # 347 Finland 2 # 137 3 # 634 2 # 023 France 46 # 545 28 # 873 27 # 564 Germany 256 # 112 438 # 191 322 # 842 Greece 2 # 572 1 # 972 789 Ireland 31 39 91 Italy 26 # 472 2 # 600 1 # 646 Luxembourg 238 120 225 Netherlands 21 # 615 20 # 346 35 # 399 Norway 4 # 569 5 # 238 12 # 876 Portugal 233 688 1 # 659 Spain 8 # 138 11 # 708 12 # 615 Sweden 26 # 500 84 # 018 37 # 581 Switzerland 35 # 000 17 # 960 24 # 739 Total 494 # 784 671 # 510 543 # 658 Source : European Council for Refugees and Exiles</TEXT>
