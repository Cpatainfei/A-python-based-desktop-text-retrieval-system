   <HEADLINE> CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE ; UNIVERSITIES HIDE SCOPE OF VIOLENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A sexual-harassment lawsuit filed against a UC San Francisco psychology professor last month epitomizes the popular perception of gender relations on campus . Sex , academics and power mingled until the woman publicly condemned her alleged harasser -- also her dissertation supervisor and former lover -- potentially destroying both their careers . Sexual harassment naturally evokes controversy on campuses , the frontiers of &quot; political correctness &quot; and sexual politics . Unfortunately , what is lost in the power-charged debates over offensive speech and &quot; Oleanna &quot; -like he-said , she-said recriminations is the true scope of gender crimes on U.S. campuses . At UCLA , four sexual-harassment lawsuits settled in secret came_to_light when the Daily Bruin , the campus student newspaper , sued for and won their release under the California Public Records Act . The university edited_out all names , but the seriousness of the alleged incidents -- repeated rapes and forced masturbation -- were evident . Nearly $ 1 million of public money was spent to settle the cases . If UCLA is representative , college administrations may be covering_up large settlements made to alleged victims of sexual_harassment to avoid costly , high-profile lawsuits . The often violent nature of the crimes is obscured by confusing and contradictory university harassment policies that leave victims little recourse but to settle quietly . Trying to hide the dark side of campus life goes hand-in-hand with sexual_harassment , because of the fear and shame the victim and harasser share . Frequently , confidentiality must be assured if a resolution can be found . It should be noted that the Daily Bruin sued for access to documents detailing sexual-harassment claims settled for sums in excess of $ 100 # 000 during the past four years at UCLA . In other words , there may have been many such settlements involving less money at the university . Private universities are not obliged to reveal anything they want kept secret . And in the case of public universities , which can be sued under public records statutes , the process of disclosing sexual_harassment can be difficult . For example , the campus paper for Nassau Community_College sued twice for documents detailing sexual_harassment charges against a professor , but did not win enough documents to learn much . No simple solution exists . Public_knowledge of each and every case would be overwhelming and would probably cause more problems than it solves . But students and taxpayers have a right to know how their tuition money is spent , how victims and alleged harassers are treated , how the process works and whether the results are just . To this end , universities could make available -- in redacted form -- the case backgrounds and how they were settled . Light would then be shed on the subject , while protecting those involved . Secrecy protects the innocent and the guilty . By preventing us from knowing the extent of the sexual_harassment problem on campus , it also keeps us in the dark about how we should combat it .</TEXT>
