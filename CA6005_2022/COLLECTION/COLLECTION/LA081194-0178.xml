   <HEADLINE> WANNA DANCE ? : KOKOMO ' S SKIN CONTEST SEEMS MODELED ON REEL LIFE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After wasting an hour watching Fox ' s newest Wednesday night fluff series , &quot; Models , Inc. , &quot; head to Kokomo ' s in Irvine for a dose of the real_thing . It ' s less glamorous and twice as silly . It is , after all , real_life . In two short segments at the club ' s once-a-week installation of Hump Night , promoted by Unity Productions , a dozen young_ladies try to be models or just look_like one . They teeter in heels , first in sexy dresses and then in bikinis , motivated by the dream of winning the illustrious 1994 Venus Model Search . What ' s that , you ask ? Organizers and the literature that comes_in a shiny black folder say it ' s an &quot; upscale , professionally run , international model search. &quot; Videos run continuously on monitors , showing last year ' s winners hamming it up in Venus swimsuits at a fashion shoot rivaled only by those shown on &quot; Star Search. &quot; Their mugs end_up on the pages of the official Venus swimsuit catalogue , allegedly coming_to a mailbox near you . Sure , super models can find fame at a nightclub . Claudia Schiffer was discovered at a Dusseldorf hot spot . But she was just hanging_out there -- and not in a bikini . And it ' s doubtful that she or any of the other women gracing the pages of Vogue and Harper ' s had to put_up with an MC in a tuxedo shirt with the sleeves cut_off , spewing expletives to whip_up the crowd . It ' s also safe to say designer Karl Lagerfeld never primed the audience at a Chanel show with : &quot; Hey , would you like to see these girls butt naked ? &quot; Upscale never looked or sounded so gutter level . The judges are volunteers ; three of the five are picked from the audience . The winning contestant gets $ 50 and a chance to compete in the venue finals Aug . 24 , before heading_off to the national finals , an event which looked_like a beauty pageant on the video . Well , a gal can dream , can ' t she ? So can the guys hootin ' and slobbering around the stage during the event . A few fall_over each other trying to get a closer look . Others exchange high-fives . As amusing a display of testosterone good times as it is , it could make any woman there uneasy . All that aside , this Unity-promoted night cranks with enough energy among the 500 to 600 young patrons who attend_to power all_the lights in Irvine -- long before the skin contest even gets going . The hand stamps glowing under the black lights reveal that many of the fresh faces present are 18 to 20 years old ( those 21 and over get a black stamp ) ; the bulk of the crowd looks_to be under 24 . Dress is casual -- right down to the plastic thong sandals and bikini top and shorts ensembles permitted . Not allowed is anything that could be construed as gang-related : hats , flannel or plaid anything , hooded shirts , calf-length shorts , baggy clothes or sports logos . Deejay Tommy T . keeps the dance_floors ( a long narrow space flanked by two smaller , elevated squares ) jampacked throughout the night with dance_music blocks that range from Naughty by Nature to Frankie Goes_to Hollywood . The new_wave generates a bit less excitement than the newer hip-hop , but doesn ' t lose enough to scare the deejay out_of_playing it . And this diverse crowd gets as crazed over Snoop Doggy Dog as it does over the Offspring , the O.C.-based punk band that MTV and KROQ can ' t get enough of . Those who can ' t stand the sweaty main room anymore head to an enclosed patio . It ' s accessible by an entrance near the bar and faces the front_entrance , making_it a perfect lookout point for late-coming friends . Until closing , the Grill ( located to the left of the bar ) serves fare fit for a teen belly and budget : appetizers such_as fried mushrooms or zucchini ( $ 3 ) and chicken strips , potato_skins and wings ( $ 4 ) . Dinner is a deal at $ 3.50 for spaghetti and salad or a cheeseburger and fries . Oh , but they ' re not total junkies . They get a grip on bottled water ( $ 1.50 ) more_than sodas ( $ 1.50 ) . Legal drinkers indulge in the specials : domestic draft for $ 1 and wells at $ 2 until 10 p.m. Regular drink prices : domestic beers , $ 3.25 ; imports ( such_as Henry Reinhart , Corona and Heineken ) , $ 3.75 ; a glass of wine , $ 4 ; cocktails , $ 3.25 to $ 4 . MORE CLUBS : Empire Ballroom , 640 17th St. , Costa Mesa . ( 714 ) 722-6100 . Open Wednesday , Friday and Saturday only , 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Cover : $ 5 Wednesday , $ 5 or $ 8 Friday , $ 10 Saturday . This is unquestionably one of the more attractive nightclubs in the region . But as a club choice among the county ' s hot spots , it ' s a moldy one . Its designed slickness , combined with its even slicker crowd , makes an evening here like a return to the tawdry ' 80s : pumps , perms and pecs everywhere . Il ' s House at Metropolis , 4255 Campus Drive , Irvine . ( 714 ) 725-0300 . Wednesdays only , 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. Cover : $ 10 .
