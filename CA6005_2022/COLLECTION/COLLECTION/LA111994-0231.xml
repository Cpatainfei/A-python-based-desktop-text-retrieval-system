   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : POST-QUAKE DANGER SEEN IN HEATERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just when you thought you had already dealt with all_the problems in your house caused by the earthquake , the Gas Co . advises that with the onset of colder temperatures , Valley residents should examine the condition of their heaters to ensure that the quake didn ' t cause vent connections to shake loose or soot to fall inside the vent . Before you reach to turn the heat_up another notch , Gas Co . officials say , check the color of your pilot_light . &quot; Normally , pilot_lights are a dark_blue cone_shape , &quot; said company spokeswoman Michelle Bagley . &quot; If a flame has turned orange , it is indicating that there is dust nearby and the vents should be cleaned before the heater is used. &quot; If the flame has turned yellow and flickers high and erratically , she continued , a qualified heating inspector should be called to check on the condition of the heater . A yellow flame , Bagley said , indicates incomplete combustion , which means enough dust has entered the vent to prevent the natural_gas from burning completely , thus releasing poisonous carbon_monoxide into the air . According to a recent study conducted by the Gas Co. , an average of 20 people die each year from carbon_monoxide emanating from their gas appliances . Recently , a 7-month-old baby in San Fernando was treated for symptoms of carbon_monoxide_poisoning caused by a heater with a vent crack believed to be caused by the quake . The baby was not seriously injured , Bagley said , &quot; but this occurrence is an example of the types of problems we ' re concerned about. &quot; Because carbon_monoxide is odorless , it ' s difficult to detect . Symptoms of carbon_monoxide_poisoning are very similar to those of the flu . &quot; If , after you turn_on your heater , you start to experience nausea , dizziness and headaches and there is no reason to suspect the flu , &quot; Bagley warns , &quot; you should not use your heater until it is inspected by a professional. &quot; Other good practices encouraged by the Gas Co . include regularly cleaning_out the filter in a forced air_unit , making_sure all heating vents are properly ventilated , refraining_from misusing a gas appliance not intended for indoor use and making_sure only a qualified worker does any needed inspections or repairs . Bagley suggested that people suspecting their heaters might be dangerous call a heating or plumbing contractor instead of relying_on the gas_company for an inspection . &quot; Because of the earthquake , we ' ve received a lot of calls from people needing work_on their appliances , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re swamped and would n ' t be able to come_out for a_couple_of days . This is a matter that needs immediate attention. &quot; ANTONIO OLIVO</TEXT>
