   <HEADLINE> U.S. , RUSSIAN OFFICIALS SIGN 4 AGREEMENTS ; AIRCRAFT : COMMERCE_SECRETARY WINS LIFTING OF NEW AEROSPACE TARIFF , SO SALE OF BOEING 757 JETLINERS CAN GO THROUGH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown signed four U.S.-Russian trade agreements here Wednesday and announced that he had rescued a deal to sell American aircraft to Russia . The sale of two Boeing 757 jets to Transaero , one of the private airlines created with the breakup of the Soviet state airline , Aeroflot , was derailed March 15 when the Russian government imposed a 50 % tariff on all aerospace imports . Brown , who is leading 28 American chief_executives on a six-day trade development trip to Moscow , said Russian officials promised to waive the retroactive tariff , clearing the way for the planes to be delivered in early April . Brown also said that Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin has agreed to review other recently imposed taxes and tariffs that have dismayed American investors and outraged the fledgling Russian business_community . Especially affected are Western oil_companies , which have sunk millions of dollars into joint_ventures with Russia only to face oil export surcharges of $ 4 or $ 5 a barrel . &quot; What this tax has done is make deals , arrangements that were formerly economically viable , no longer economically viable , &quot; Brown said . &quot; It ' s the kind of action that really has a chilling effect on investment and on trade . There has to be some kind of predictability in the tax system. &quot; Brown also said he had told Russian officials frankly that they will have to compete with other countries for the American investment dollar . &quot; The challenge for the Russian government is to make_it attractive for foreign investment here , because oil_companies can go elsewhere , &quot; said Ray R . Irani , the Los Angeles-based president and CEO of Occidental Oil &amp; Gas Corp. , which has invested about $ 140 million in two exploration and pumping projects . &quot; Some ministries are more understanding of our problems than others , &quot; Irani said . He added that Chernomyrdin , a former Soviet oil executive , seemed to be interested in more foreign involvement , especially by American companies . Russian policy-makers appear torn between the need to raise revenue fast to comply with International Monetary Fund demands that they curb inflation and bring state spending under_control , and the need to keep taxes low enough to stimulate investment in what everyone concedes is a high-risk country . After a 45-minute meeting Wednesday with Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , Brown said he was &quot; optimistic &quot; about prospects that the $ 1 billion that American companies have invested in Russia can turn_into $ 50 billion if the Yeltsin government fosters the proper business climate . Brown tried to boost that &quot; comfort level &quot; by saying that Yeltsin -- whose health has been the subject of endless speculation , rumor and intrigue -- appeared rested , healthy and in good_spirits . &quot; I ' m not a physician , but he sure looked good to me , &quot; the secretary said . The four trade agreements signed Wednesday include a joint statement on market access and two agreements on setting_up business centers in six locations in Russia to offer advice , communications , translation and other help to American businesses that want to set_up shop here . Also approved was a pact that will make_it easier for pharmaceutical companies to sell Russian drugs without a lengthy regulatory process , provided the products have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . Brown said that some of the American business_executives traveling with him had closed deals previously &quot; stuck_in the pipeline. &quot; They range from a joint_venture to produce Samsonite and American Tourister luggage at a Russian factory to a Westinghouse Electric contract to modernize Russian nuclear_power plants .</TEXT>
