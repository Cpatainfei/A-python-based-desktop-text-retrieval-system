   <HEADLINE> JOHN O ' GROATS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I read your Sept . 22 article by Jonathan Gold in praise of the outstanding Westside restaurant John O ' Groats with great interest , having enjoyed many of its excellent vegetarian dishes myself . Therefore , it was most surprising to find a typical Sikh diner so inaccurately described as a &quot; hamburger-ordering Sikh. &quot; The American Sikh community is highly visible and recognizable , because we usually dress in white , and both men and women wear turbans . For more_than 25 years many of us in Los Angeles have frequented Westside restaurants , and it is generally known and respected that we are vegetarians . Paul Tyler , whose family owns John O ' Groats and who himself spends much of his time there , told me he had never seen a Sikh order a hamburger and that he too was surprised at Gold ' s use of the words hamburger-ordering to describe a Sikh . ( Veggie-burger , maybe , but hamburger ? I don ' t think so ! ) -- SAT BACHAN KAUR KHALSA Sikh Dharma Los Angeles</TEXT>
