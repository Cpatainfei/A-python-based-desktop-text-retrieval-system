   <HEADLINE> SOME SEATTLE HOMELESS GO JOY RIDING_ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY ; COMPUTERS : THE DOWNTOWN LIBRARY ALLOWS THE PUBLIC FREE HOOKUP ON INTERNET , AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING BUT TIME SPEND HOURS TINKERING ON THE WORLDWIDE NETWORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By night , 25-year-old Rodney Lindsey retires to his room in a homeless shelter at the old Pacific Hotel . By day , he explores the outer reaches of Russia , China , Germany , Switzerland -- wherever the power of Internet takes him . As 9 a.m. approaches each day , Lindsey and a cadre of other homeless people can be found outside the downtown Seattle Public_Library , waiting for first crack at one of about 35 terminals that will allow them free hookup to the global matrix of worldwide computer_networks known as Internet . For many , short on money , long on_time , down on luck , the Internet has become a safety net . It beats the streets . &quot; It ' s my high , &quot; Lindsey said , peeling himself away from the computer terminal one recent morning to talk with a reporter . &quot; I don ' t do any drugs . I don ' t drink . I ' ve got_to have some high. &quot; Ever since Seattle became the first major public_library to provide public access to the Internet in July , 1993 , some of the most avid users have been a group of homeless people who have come_to be known simply as The Internetters . They don ' t have physical addresses but can be reached in cyberspace . Their numbers range from a dozen to two . Some spend an hour or two on the terminal , others the whole day . Lindsey , a self-professed Internet junkie , boasts of once having spent 72 hours straight on the net : When the downtown library closed at 9 p.m. , he resumed his internetting at the University of Washington ' s computer_science lab a_few miles away . &quot; Well , I did use the bathroom , but that was it , &quot; Lindsey said . &quot; But I didn ' t sleep , I didn ' t eat . I just internetted. &quot; The Seattle Public_Library offers direct Internet hookups to only about 10 &quot; gateways , &quot; such_as the Library of Congress and White_House News . But the Netters have figured_out ways to hop_out of the library ' s menu system and &quot; telnet , &quot; or connect onto just about any other public terminal on the worldwide Internet . From there , they ' ve discovered bulletin_boards , databases , games , chat lines , MUDs ( multi-user dimensions , a kind of computer-simulated environment ) , and e-mail . They can play &quot; Star Wars &quot; with someone in Brazil , then drop_a_line to President Clinton . Some have gotten so adept that other Internet users often come_to them for help . &quot; If you have all day to explore you can become pretty expert , and that ' s why some of them are able to teach our staff or other patrons , &quot; said Jim Taylor , the library ' s coordinator for automated services . Lindsey found himself on the streets after being booted_out of the Navy in January , 1993 , for reasons he would n ' t disclose . He uses Internet to explore . &quot; I see it as a bank_vault , with no guards , trying to get_in , &quot; he said . &quot; I am able to go anywhere and everywhere and mess with anybody . I can get_into Russia , Japan , China , Switzerland , Germany , England , anywhere in the United States , Canada , Mexico . I ' m unlimited. &quot; Jon Cooper , 41 , uses the Internet to research witchcraft and to correspond with a Maryland woman he &quot; met &quot; through a bulletin_board . The electronic conversations , he said , have been encouraging and uplifting . &quot; She gives me more of a positive attitude , &quot; Cooper said . &quot; A lot of that rubs_off on me through the computer. &quot; Cooper graduated from college in North_Dakota with a degree in business administration . He worked for the Forest Service for 13 years and was a welder ' s assistant at a nuclear_power plant in California . When he lost both job and wife , he found himself homeless in Seattle in February . He ' s waiting for a hire call from Boeing Co . Meantime , he sleeps most nights on a cot in the basement of a church . About the Internet system , he said , &quot; I don ' t know about anybody else , but I need a little space that I can draw into . Otherwise , I ' m going_to go crazy . It ' s to keep my sanity more or less , to have someplace where I can feel comfortable and just learn. &quot; Frank , an eloquent 25-year-old who left home at age 14 , hooks_up to interactive games on the net to kill time while looking_for work . &quot; What are you going_to do ? Are you going_to sit on the curb and get a ticket ? &quot; he asked . &quot; It ' s good to have a release , being able to escape and to get_rid_of that time that you really don ' t know what to do with , and then to come_back and maybe use the knowledge that you ' ve learned. &quot; And on the net , Frank said , &quot; nobody can see I ' m black. &quot; That sense of safety and anonymity may be what ' s attracting some homeless people to the net , says Nancy Amidei , a lecturer at the University of Washington ' s School of Social_Work and coordinator of a homeless youth program . &quot; If you ' re living on the streets or if you don ' t have a stable living situation , it ' s sometimes hard to connect with people in usual ways , &quot; Amidei says . &quot; Anybody who ' s gotten themselves on e-mail or on the Internet knows once you get hooked in you find yourself with more friends than you can possibly imagine . &quot; Nor can your correspondent see how you ' re dressed or where you are . It ' s classless . It ' s genderless . It ' s raceless. &quot; And it ' s free . One of the public_library ' s missions is to provide everyone equal access to information , be it printed or electronic , said Craig Butold , deputy city librarian . Homeless people , he said , &quot; are clearly a group that would not have access otherwise. &quot; Less than 3 % of the more_than 9 # 000 public_libraries in the United States offer public access to the Internet , according to a June report from the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information_Science . Libraries from across the world have contacted Seattle for advice on setting_up Internet access . Butold tells them to expect the unexpected . Some patrons complain that some of the homeless people are hogging the terminals and making too_much noise . The library staff and the Internetters met to discuss the problems , and both sides amiably agreed to some time-use guidelines . The library also set_aside some terminals for patrons who just wanted to search the library ' s catalogue . Since then , things have been running smoothly . Lindsey has spent so_much time on the net that he says he should be hired to teach others how to do_it . &quot; I ' m learning too_much , &quot; he said . &quot; Someone ' s bound to say , ' Hey , you know too_much . I want you. ' &quot;</TEXT>
