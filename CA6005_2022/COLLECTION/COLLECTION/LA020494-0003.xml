   <HEADLINE> HUMANE AND NECESSARY BORDER CONTROL ; NEW PLAN WILL HELP -- BUT THERE ' S SO_MUCH MORE TO BE DONE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration ' s plan for a two-year &quot; border initiative &quot; to slow illegal immigration -- and attack a variety of problems associated with it -- is encouraging , even if it doesn ' t go as far as it could in dealing with a complex phenomenon that has been with us a long_time and is not going_to fade_away in two years . The new proposal is encouraging in that it shows President Clinton and Atty . Gen . Janet Reno are now trying to do something about immigration problems , moving to both calm hysteria and address the real challenge . Although immigration problems are not as severe as some restrictionists claim , this initiative is important because it shows the Administration is aware that U.S. immigration controls indeed are in need of rapid modernization . The $ 540-million-plus initiative , outlined Thursday by Reno and Doris Meissner , commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service , will assign 400 more Border_Patrol agents to the busiest sector of the U.S.-Mexico border , south of San Diego . It also includes funds to identify illegal immigrants held_in state_prisons and to deport them . These law_enforcement measures will be applauded by those who fear the country is under siege by illegal border-crossers . So will more money for the INS to enforce the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act , which banned the employment of illegal immigrants . Jobs are what lure most illegal immigrants to this country , and anything that makes_it harder for non-citizens to find work helps diminish the flow . Unfortunately , the most effective tool to enforce that law , a counterfeit-proof Social_Security card , still is lacking . As important as added manpower is to the INS , the agency also must put more money into getting the equipment it needs to enforce immigration laws more efficiently . That means not just border lights and new vehicles but computers . The INS has lagged woefully behind other federal agencies , including other border agencies like the Customs Service , in the use of electronic data . It is noteworthy that Meissner has included $ 83 million in this funding proposal to computerize INS databases . While only a start , that can help prepare the INS_for what surely will be an even bigger workload in the 21st Century . It is also encouraging that this border initiative balances its law_enforcement components with $ 54 million to speed_up the asylum procedure for legitimate refugees by more rapidly screening_out fraudulent claims , and $ 30 million to ease the naturalization process for 8 million legal immigrants who are eligible to become citizens . To use computer terminology , the INS must make naturalization more &quot; user-friendly. &quot; For its part , Congress -- which must approve some of the funds to be used under the plan -- must see this border initiative as_a_whole and not pick it apart by trying , for example , to hire more Border_Patrol agents instead of buying the necessary computers . To simply spend money on law_enforcement without dealing with other facets of the immigration phenomenon would repeat the mistakes of the past -- not just 1986 but as far back as the 1920s , when Congress created the Border_Patrol . Throwing money at problems along the border won ' t make them go_away . It has to be &quot; spent smart , &quot; to use Meissner ' s apt phrase . This new infusion of border-control money will be spent smart if it is spent not just on current immigration problems but in streamlining the INS so it is a more effective agency for the proper , humane and necessary control of immigration .</TEXT>
