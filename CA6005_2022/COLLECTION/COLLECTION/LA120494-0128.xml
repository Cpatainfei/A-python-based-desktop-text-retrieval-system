   <HEADLINE> SPACECRAFT FINDS SUN HAS UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD , NOT MAGNETIC POLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Ulysses spacecraft has found the sun to have a uniform magnetic_field rather than magnetic_poles , according to NASA ' s Jet_Propulsion Laboratory . The spacecraft ' s finding differs greatly from the way the sun ' s magnetic_field appears in Earth-based observations , which indicate the sun has magnetic poles.Ulysses did not detect any magnetic_poles , JPL said . Ulysses , the first spacecraft to study the sun ' s high latitudes , completed its pass_over the sun ' s southern pole on Nov . 5 . The sun ' s polar regions are considered to begin at about 70 degrees north and south of the sun ' s equator . Ulysses was released from the space shuttle Discovery and launched in 1990 on a $ 750-million mission . The mission is jointly managed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the European Space Agency . Ulysses is now heading toward the sun ' s equator in a huge orbit far above the star . On March 12 , 1995 , Ulysses will be at the closest point of its solar exploration , 120 million miles above the sun .</TEXT>
