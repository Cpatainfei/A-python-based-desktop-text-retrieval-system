   <HEADLINE> COMET COLLISION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> William Pfaff ( Commentary , Aug . 8 ) belittles an effort afoot in Congress to initiate a watch for comets with potential for collision with the Earth . After trotting_out silly arguments about how unlikely this event is -- and Jupiter ' s recent unpleasantness shows it isn ' t all that unlikely -- he then quotes the usual theological cop-out about &quot; God in his inscrutable wisdom &quot; deciding that it ' s time to destroy mankind and so we shouldn ' t attempt to &quot; thwart &quot; him. ( Somehow , that argument doesn ' t ring true for me . If it were valid , why would we take antibiotics when we get sick ? ) An encounter with even a relatively small comet or asteroid would probably terminate human life -- and quite possibly all life -- on this planet . Somehow , I think that it would be sadly ironic if mankind managed to avoid nuclear annihilation , only to fall victim to some bad cosmic joke like a cometary collision . To me , it makes_sense to do whatever we can to save ourselves . ROBERT S . HELFMAN Los Angeles</TEXT>
