   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : UNIVERSAL CITY ; COMPROMISE OFFERED ON MCA COMPLEX SUBWAY STOP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> City transit officials have proposed a compromise for the Universal City Metro Rail station that would preserve the planned Lankershim Boulevard site but better serve the MCA entertainment complex , potentially satisfying key demands by the multimedia company and county transportation planners . MCA has pushed hard to move the subway_station to the doorstep of its Universal Studios and CityWalk complex -- a proposal resisted by county transportation planners as being too costly and time-consuming . But city analysts say in a report that the new Red_Line station could remain on Lankershim but should include an entrance on the Universal Studios lot up the_hill , with shuttle service between the gates and the station . Access to the entertainment_center would therefore be improved without the added delays and costs of moving the station directly onto the Universal Studios lot , as MCA has lobbied for . Both MCA executives and officials of the county Metropolitan Transportation Authority said Wednesday that the proposal appears workable , fueling hope that the long-running disagreement between MCA and the transit agency over station location could be near an end .</TEXT>
