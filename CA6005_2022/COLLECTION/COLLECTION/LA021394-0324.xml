   <HEADLINE> COYOTE POPULACE PUTS PET OWNERS ON THE DEFENSIVE ; WILDLIFE : RESIDENTS OF ORANGE HILLS FEEL UNDER SIEGE . COUNTY AND STATE OFFICIALS SAY IT ' S A PROBLEM WITH HUMANS , WHO MUST LEARN TO COEXIST WITH THE WILY CREATURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Humorist Mark Twain once referred to them as &quot; the most friendless of God ' s creatures. &quot; But as far as Lori Klunder and her neighbors in the_hills of east Orange are concerned , the predators which have devoured scores of household pets over the last six months have friends in very high places . When Klunder recently asked_for help in ridding her neighborhood of coyotes , county animal control officials sent a pamphlet instead , telling her how to co-exist with the beast . &quot; It ' s not a coyote problem , &quot; said Marie Hulett-Curtner , a public education officer with Orange County Animal Control . &quot; It ' s a lack-of-human-awareness problem. &quot; Klunder got virtually the same response from the state_Department of Fish and Game , which refuses to trap the animals , which kill about a dozen pets every night in Orange County . &quot; I lost a cat to an automobile once , &quot; said Bob Schlichting , a Fish and Game spokesman . &quot; But I don ' t think there should be a ban on automobiles. &quot; Though wildlife officials don ' t know exactly how many coyotes live here , they say there is a &quot; substantial &quot; population that has adapted well to the urban environment . Their numbers have become increasingly visible lately , animal control officers say , because last year ' s fires cleared thousands of acres of underbrush , forcing the animals to seek new hunting_grounds . The coyote , a relative of the fox and wolf , is the size of a medium-sized shepherd_dog and weighs about 25 pounds . Largely nocturnal , it rarely hunts in groups . Coyotes have long preyed upon pets in Orange County , though they seem especially active near foothills and adjacent to open spaces , wildlife experts say . In the past two years , Tustin , Villa Park and San Clemente have all been hot spots for coyote problems . Klunder ' s community is now the latest victim . In the past four months , coyotes killed two of her cats , Bugsy and Bianca , and the telephone_poles around the neighborhood are cluttered with signs from people desperately seeking information about their missing pets . &quot; I was so heartbroken , &quot; Klunder said . &quot; I don ' t want someone else to go_through what I went_through . And the problem is , it ' s getting worse. &quot; After Bugsy and Bianca were killed , neighbor Denise Harrison stopped letting D.D. , her shaggy little Maltese , run_around her fenced back yard . Harrison said she would feel safer if county animal control would &quot; remove the coyotes to a place where they could live like they are supposed to live. &quot; Harrison , whose townhouse complex abuts the foothills , said , &quot; I ' ve been hearing more and more coyotes lately . It ' s really terrifying and it ' s so close. &quot; The best government_agencies can offer , however , is simple and direct advice -- keep your pets indoors at all times . Other measures such_as capture and relocation are usually prohibited by state law to protect the ecosystem . Animal control officials say cats are especially vulnerable to coyotes because cats often regard the predator as a dog and try to repel the attack by merely swatting the coyote across the face . &quot; If a cat tries that with a coyote , &quot; said Hulett-Curtner , &quot; the coyote doesn ' t care and in the next instance it has the cat by the neck and that ' s the end of the story. &quot; As coyotes become bolder about intruding_into neighborhoods and back yards , Klunder fears a coyote might harm a human , particularly a small child playing alone outside . Though officials warn parents not to leave children unattended in areas where coyotes have been spotted , less than a handful of people are injured every year by coyote attacks . Dogs are considered a much greater threat to people . To get_rid_of coyotes , their food supply must be cut_off . Officials say that pets should be kept and fed indoors . Trash_cans must be securely locked so coyotes cannot get_into them . &quot; Coyotes will leave an area if there is no food , &quot; said Hulett-Curtner . &quot; It ' s common sense. &quot; While Klunder and her neighbors say they will follow all_the precautions , Klunder wants her her community to hire a professional trapper . But wildlife officials advise against it . Coyotes are very difficult to catch , and those that are trapped are usually old , young or stupid , leaving_behind the strongest and craftiest animals . Said Hulett-Curtner : &quot; You actually alter the gene pool to help create a super-coyote. &quot;</TEXT>
