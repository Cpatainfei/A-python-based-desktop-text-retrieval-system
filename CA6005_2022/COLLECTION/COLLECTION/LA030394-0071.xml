   <HEADLINE> PLUGS FOR PUBLIC-SAFETY HOLES ; QUAKE-CAUSED LEAKS IN OIL_PIPELINE RAISE A WARNING FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> According to the standards set by the California Government Code , the underground pipeline that carries crude_oil from Kern County fields to the Los Angeles Refinery in Carson was not a high-risk pipeline . Still , the Four Corners Line No . 1 leaked at eight locations after the Northridge earthquake . The worst of those breaks was not the largest : Crude that seeped to the surface on Wolfskill Street in Mission Hills somehow ignited , injuring a man and charring 17 cars and a house . Discovery that the pipeline is one of the state ' s oldest , built_in 1925 with old-fashioned acetylene welds , generated even more concern among officials . First , the Los Angeles City_Council slapped a moratorium on new pipeline franchise agreements . The San Fernando City_Council followed by ordering the operator to forgo pumping until the city received a report on the incident . But these local initiatives , in part , exceeded municipal powers . By state and federal statute , responsibility for petroleum pipeline safety rests with the state fire_marshal ' s office . Fortunately , that office appears to be assessing not only the Wolfskill spill but the warning it has raised for oil_pipelines throughout the state . There are 8 # 000 miles of underground petroleum pipeline in California , enough to run from Los Angeles to New York City and back , with 2 # 000 miles to spare . Those with acetylene welds should be checked for the kinds of problems that led to the Wolfskill spill . The fire_marshal ' s office says that the Four Corners line will not reopen until it has been tested exhaustively . Findings should be shared with local officials . In addition , there is another issue that local officials will have to look_at . The state fire_marshal says that the pipeline ' s owner , Arco , agrees that it should be taken_out of service and replaced with a pipeline that avoids residential_areas . The task of choosing a new route is sure to be difficult , not to mention politically unpopular . But county and city officials cannot avoid this responsibility , so the sooner they begin discussions with state officials and Arco the better .</TEXT>
