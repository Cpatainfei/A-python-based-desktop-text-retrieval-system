   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : GATT REALITY CHECK IS DRAWN ON STRONG RESERVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s now likely that Congress will approve U.S. participation in an expanded General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade this week , backing developments in international_law and commercial practice that the United States has fought long and hard to achieve . By their actions , the House and Senate will boost international trade_in services -- law , finance , engineering , education -- in which the United States leads the world . The trade vote also will protect intellectual property -- computer software , copyrights on films , videos and music -- in which , again , the United States leads the world . And by its vote , Congress will ensure a widening and growing world economy and give a boost to the U.S. economy too . Yet from all_the misleading opposition to GATT by politicians and commentators , you ' d think Congress was voting for bubonic_plague . Critics have depicted America in GATT as Gulliver among the Lilliputians , a pitiful helpless giant stung by darts from pygmies . Far from prospering , GATT opponents have said , Americans would be impoverished and turned_into minions of a menacing world state . It is a defeatist , sour vision of the world stemming either from lack of confidence in U.S. economic vitality or a misguided but historic feeling that Americans do better without foreign entanglements . So it ' s time for a reality check . In fact , the United States now depends_on international transactions for 25 % of its annual economic activity , including $ 750 billion worth of exports of goods and services and income from overseas investments . Trade is not a zero-sum game but a giant swap meet in which jobs at ports and airlines , stock_exchanges , movie lots and Disneyland depend_on America ' s interactions with other nations . The country cannot do without foreign entanglements . But that ' s a fact to be celebrated , not feared . This is the world America has made_over the 48 years since World_War_II , as its soldiers stood_guard over countries trying to rebuild their economies and confronted states hostile to the world trading system . It has been a time of historic growth in international commerce , with merchandise trade multiplying tenfold to more_than $ 7 trillion . That doesn ' t include trillions more in undercounted services and the products of modern entertainment , TV_programs and movies . The GATT , which began in 1947 with 23 nations pledging not to raise tariffs or keep_out each other ' s goods , has been a foundation of that growth . Average tariffs have come_down from 40 % to 5 % as the agreement itself has expanded to 123 nations . * It hasn ' t always been smooth sailing . Disputes in the GATT have been frequent -- nations used to fight wars over trade , after all -- with the United States complaining most often that poorer countries were taking_advantage of Uncle_Sam ' s big market but not opening_up to U.S. goods . So U.S. administrations for more_than a decade have demanded a tough judicial body like the World Trade Organization that ' s created in the new GATT agreement . Ironically , critics have falsely charged WTO with undermining U.S. sovereignty , rousing constitutional scholar Robert Bork to restate publicly that &quot; no international agreement &quot; can override U.S. laws and causing the Clinton_Administration to create a panel of U.S. judges to monitor WTO decisions . Still , why are Americans so uneasy ? Partly it ' s that the world is shifting . The most dynamic market today is in East Asia , not America ( although the two fastest growing economies , Brazil and Peru , are in Latin_America ) . The East Asian economies ( Japan , China , Taiwan , South and North_Korea , Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , the Philippines and Vietnam ) now account_for 25 % of the world ' s total economic output -- on a par with the United States -- and by the year 2000 , Asia will account_for one-third . U.S. merchandise trade across the Pacific , at $ 361 billion , is 50 % larger than its transatlantic trade . For Europe , business with Asia is now larger than trade with America . And trade among the Asian_nations themselves counts for more_than trade with the United States . * But that ' s a dawn of opportunity , not grounds for regret . Just consider the prospects in China , a nation that needs almost everything . Zhou Wenzhong , the new , 49-year old Chinese consul general in Los Angeles , cites some figures : &quot; The World_Bank will lend China $ 15 billion in the next five years for investments in infrastructure projects , in energy and communications , &quot; says Zhou . &quot; And China ' s government will invest 500 billion renminbi ( U.S. $ 57 billion ) in infrastructure between now and the end of the century. &quot; China won ' t develop without bumps along the way , but it ' s on_the_move . Modernization of agriculture has sent 60 million people -- more_than the whole population of Britain or Italy -- off the land and into the cities looking_for work . Even if it grows 7 % a year -- as opposed to more_than 10 % today -- China ' s economy by 2010 will be 82 % the size of the U.S. economy , which will itself continue growing in the meantime . The challenge for the United States and other countries will be to bring China into the GATT next year so that its potential to export surges of low-priced goods can be controlled and its enormous market will remain open , explains S . Linn Williams , a former U.S. trade representative who is now general counsel to Mission Energy , a subsidiary of Southern California Edison that builds and operates power_plants in Asia . Americans have a big stake in China ' s development . U.S. firms will build many of its power_plants and large parts of the communications and transportation_systems , with every dollar of work over there creating several dollars worth of work back in the United States . Trade often defies expectations . The U.S. telecommunications industry , for example , grew and prospered because the U.S._government broke_up the telephone_company and , in a move unlike that of any other country , opened the market to global suppliers . The resulting competition produced an industry that employs more people than ever and exports the latest in communications know-how all_over the world -- notably to China . * Can the United States turn its back on the world ? It did before , in 1930 when Congress raised tariffs and crop supports to protect U.S. farmers from cheap foreign crops . But the Smoot-Hawley tariff and foreign retaliation destroyed export markets for U.S. farmers while high prices hurt home markets and helped bring_on the Great Depression . We can be thankful that probably won ' t happen again this week .</TEXT>
