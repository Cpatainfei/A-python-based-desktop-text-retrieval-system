   <HEADLINE> LOSS ESTIMATES FOR QUAKE MAY BE $ 1 BILLION LOW ; INSURANCE : S &amp; P RATING AGENCY SAYS TOTAL COULD BE CLOSER TO $ 3.5 BILLION AND THAT SEVERAL SMALL COMPANIES FACE FAILURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A major insurance rating agency said Wednesday that the industry ' s official loss estimate for the Northridge earthquake -- $ 2.5 billion -- may be $ 1 billion too low . Standard &amp; Poor ' s Insurance Rating Service also said a number of smaller insurers -- particularly those heavily concentrated in California property insurance -- are vulnerable to failure , if not from the Jan . 17 earthquake , then from catastrophes to come . Also Wednesday , Farmers Insurance Group , California ' s third-largest homeowners insurer , said it expects its quake-related claims to reach $ 600 million . Steven Dreyer , who prepared the Standard &amp; Poor ' s analysis , said S &amp; P has loss estimates totaling $ 2.4 billion from 29 companies representing 62 % of the California property insurance market , including earthquake , homeowners , auto and commercial coverage . If the remaining 38 % of the market suffered proportional losses , he said , &quot; we ' re looking_at a total closer to $ 3.5 billion. &quot; That would far exceed the $ 2.5-billion estimate released Feb . 7 by the Property Claims Services division of the American Insurance Services Group , a trade group that polls insurers to compile official catastrophe loss estimates . These estimates concern only losses that will be covered by insurance . The total losses are far higher because much of the damage was to uninsured public infrastructure such_as sewers and highway overpasses and because individual earthquake policies have high deductibles and only about one-third of Los Angeles homeowners buy them . The S &amp; P report said the bulk of earthquake claims will be paid by large , multistate carriers such_as State Farm and Allstate , whose diversification and huge capital bases will make their losses &quot; taxing but not devastating. &quot; On the other hand , the agency also listed a number of smaller insurers with what it called &quot; high potential catastrophe exposure. &quot; The companies have such high concentrations of California property insurance business relative to their surplus -- an insurer ' s financial cushion against claims -- that they are &quot; susceptible to financial stress &quot; from the quake and future disasters . At the top of the list are two Santa Monica-based sister companies , Western Mutual Insurance Co . and Residence Mutual Insurance Co. , which together wrote $ 40 million in California property insurance_premiums in 1992 , representing 435 % of their combined surplus . That was by far the highest premiums-to-surplus ratio among the 66 insurers that S &amp; P surveyed . But mere exposure to potential losses does not necessarily translate into financial shakiness , Paul Rubincam , senior_vice_president of Western Mutual , said in a telephone_interview Wednesday . Rubincam said the two companies , which serve about 110 # 000 California policyholders , expect earthquake claims of $ 5 million to $ 6 million . However , the bulk of that will be covered by reinsurance -- policies that insurers buy to protect themselves against such catastrophes . The net cost to the two insurers is likely to be only about $ 1.5 million , or a bit less than one-fifth of their surplus , he said . It ' s a painful blow but not life-threatening , Rubincam said . * The company S &amp; P listed as having the next-highest catastrophe exposure is American Sterling Insurance Co . of El Toro , with a California premiums-to-surplus ratio of 183 % . American Sterling President Michael Thompson said the figure is misleading because the company writes virtually no earthquake insurance and expects only a single fire-related loss claim from the Northridge quake . No other carrier had a ratio of more_than 100 % . Regarding its projected $ 600 million in quake claims , Farmers said a &quot; substantial &quot; but undetermined portion will be covered by reinsurance . The exact amount will not be known until the end of the year because the company ' s reinsurance level is based on a formula comparing the total annual revenue with its total annual losses . Wednesday ' s report puts Farmers in a tie with State Farm for the highest quake damage estimate . Next comes Allstate , with an estimated $ 350 million in claims .</TEXT>
