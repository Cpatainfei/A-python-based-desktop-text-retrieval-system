   <HEADLINE> SALE OF ESZTERHAS SCRIPT SCORES A SCREENWRITERS ' BREAKTHROUGH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Joe Eszterhas , already the highest-paid screenwriter in movie history since the record $ 3-million sale of &quot; Basic Instinct &quot; in 1990 , made another precedent-setting deal Wednesday that further underscores the rising power of top screenwriters in Hollywood . The 49-year-old Eszterhas , in a breakthrough for what has been the least powerful talent in the film_industry , becomes the first screenwriter in_line to earn &quot; first-dollar gross , &quot; or a percentage of all revenue collected from a movie by its distributor . Historically , only top-drawer directors such_as Steven Spielberg and Sydney Pollack and stars such_as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Costner have received first-dollar grosses from their movies . Eszterhas won the deal from independent Savoy Pictures , the 2-year-old producer and distributor that outbid Columbia Pictures and Morgan Creek Productions for the writer ' s latest script , &quot; Foreplay , &quot; a rock ' n ' roll mystery about serial killings set_in St . Petersburg , Fla . Sources familiar_with the deal say the groundbreaking arrangement guarantees the writer $ 1 million up front and another $ 3 million to $ 4 million ( depending_on budget size ) as of the day principal photography begins , and 2.5 % of every dollar Savoy takes_in from all domestic revenue sources , from box_office to video store . U.S. distributors such_as Savoy typically split a film ' s box_office gross with theater owners . Eszterhas could also make money from foreign distribution of the film , but he won ' t get a share of the gross . A source indicated that only a &quot; small portion &quot; of the purchase_price of the script will be applied against the potential gross earnings . And , in another apparent first , Eszterhas will also participate financially in soundtrack sales from his movie . He will collect a minimum of 1 % on each unit sold . None of the negotiating parties -- including Eszterhas ; his agent at ICM , Guy McElwaine ; his attorney , Sam Fischer , or Savoy -- would discuss financial aspects of the deal . Writers ' agents affirmed Wednesday that it is unheard of for a screenwriter to get a share of &quot; first-dollar &quot; gross in Hollywood . &quot; It shows how the power of the screenwriter has really increased , &quot; said Jeremy Zimmer , an agent at United Talent Agency . The deal is not without risk to Eszterhas , however . Instead of his usual enormous flat fee up front , he agreed to accept just $ 1 million in exchange for the chance to earn much more if the movie is a smash hit . But Frank Price , the former Columbia Pictures chief who will share producer credit with Eszterhas , and Savoy officials insisted that the script is_on the fast track for production as soon as a director and cast are ready to go . &quot; If they don ' t make the movie , the script rights revert back to me after 30 months , &quot; said Eszterhas , whose earlier successes include &quot; Jagged Edge &quot; and &quot; Flashdance. &quot; New York-based Savoy was founded in 1992 by veteran movie executives Victor A . Kaufman and Lewis J . Korman , who serve as chairman and president , respectively . Among the company ' s releases are &quot; Shadowlands , &quot; &quot; A Bronx Tale &quot; and the recent &quot; Serial Mom &quot; and &quot; No Escape. &quot; While Eszterhas will receive less advance money for &quot; Foreplay &quot; than he did for &quot; Basic Instinct &quot; and some of his previous scripts , McElwaine estimates that his client could earn as much as $ 10 million if the movie is a hit on the order of &quot; Basic Instinct. &quot; That film , starring Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas , grossed $ 350 million worldwide at the box_office . &quot; The reason for gambling the up-front money is to get the back-end money , because we know they are going_to make_it , &quot; McElwaine said , adding , &quot; Many aspects of this deal are unprecedented in modern motion_picture history. &quot; McElwaine said he recalls some time ago that Neil Simon received first-dollar gross on the underlying sale of one of his plays when he adapted it to the screen , but &quot; my understanding is that was part of the purchase_price of the play &quot; and thus differs from the &quot; Foreplay &quot; deal . &quot; I ' ve always felt the writer of a piece deserves to be compensated as well as directors and actors , &quot; Eszterhas said . &quot; In the case of an original screenplay , it is the writer ' s vision up_on the screen . This deal says to me , it ' s possible that if screenwriters stick_to their work and their guns , they ' ll be compensated that way. &quot; Eszterhas ' screenwriting credits also include &quot; Music_Box , &quot; &quot; Flashdance &quot; and , most recently , &quot; Sliver &quot; ( a flop domestically ) . In the age of the computer , he writes exclusively on an Olivetti manual typewriter , but he is hardly risking impoverishment in taking a flyer on &quot; Foreplay. &quot; In the last two years , he has made a $ 3.4-million deal with producer Jon Peters and Columbia to adapt a book about Mafia kingpin John Gotti . That script is not yet written . Last year , he sold an idea for a rock musical , called &quot; Showgirls , &quot; to producer Charles Evans for more_than $ 1.5 million , then later auctioned the script to Carolco Pictures for $ 2.2 million . The picture was never made because director Paul Verhoeven chose to do &quot; Crusade , &quot; with Arnold Schwarzenegger , for Carolco . ( Verhoeven may be back as the director of &quot; Showgirls , &quot; because the movie company is having budget problems with &quot; Crusade. &quot; ) Eszterhas also sold a four-page outline of a courtroom thriller , &quot; Jade , &quot; to Paramount for $ 2.5 million . William Friedkin is expected to direct that picture this fall . Eszterhas says &quot; Foreplay &quot; is not a &quot; straight-ahead thriller &quot; like &quot; Jagged Edge &quot; or &quot; Basic Instinct , &quot; but more of a &quot; mystery that ' s spooky -- not quite a comedy , but very funny. &quot; The story centers_on the relationship between Trish , a 20-year-old rock singer , and Vince , a burned-out , thirtysomething bass player-turned-cop who , along with his 60-year-old partner , Carl , investigates several murders involving young_men and women .</TEXT>
