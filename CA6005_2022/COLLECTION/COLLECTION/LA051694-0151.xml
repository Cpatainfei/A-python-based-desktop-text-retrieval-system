   <HEADLINE> A BUDDING INDUSTRY MAY TAKE_ROOT IN CANADA : HEMP ; AGRICULTURE : OFFICIALS CONSIDER LEGALIZING MARIJUANA CROP FOR PROCESSING INTO PAPER , ROPE , BUILDING_MATERIALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Joe Strobel dreams marijuana dreams . Wait , it ' s not what you think . In Strobel ' s dream , the tobacco fields sloping up from the north shore of Lake Erie -- his fields and those of his neighbors -- are patched with dense stands of Cannabis_sativa ruffling in the wind . And it ' s all legal . The Canadian government is poised to make Strobel ' s dream come true , perhaps as early as this summer . For Strobel ' s marijuana -- or hemp , as he prefers to call it -- would be so low in THC ( tetrahydrocannabinol ) , the active ingredient in pot , that no one could get high smoking it . Instead , Strobel and the 11 other Ontario farmers in his consortium plan to sell their hemp fiber for processing into paper , rope , building materials and maybe even shirts and caps . These would-be hemp growers , and others like them from the Great Lakes to the Canadian Rockies , are beneficiaries of a surging international movement on behalf of low-THC hemp , powered by an unlikely coalition of environmentalists , entrepreneurs , farmers and , yes , advocates of legalized pot . Canadian officials are listening . The ruling Liberal_Party is sponsoring legislation that would license hemp growing throughout Canada . &quot; Farmers in Canada are very interested in it . It ' s an excellent commercial and industrial type of crop . It ' s high in fiber , it ' s an excellent alternative to ( growing ) tobacco . . . . It has a great_deal of potential , &quot; Health Minister Diane Marleau said in an interview . She said the bill , which would closely regulate hemp growers , could get final approval in the House of Commons this year and then would go_to the Canadian Senate . Canada would follow a number of European and Asian_countries , most recently Britain , in legalizing cultivation of low-THC hemp . Advocates of the plant , often sporting &quot; Hemp Can Save the Planet &quot; buttons , get rapturous about its attributes . Not only is it the environmentally correct alternative to lumber and wood_pulp , they say , but you can cook with hemp oil , fabricate it into particle_board , combine it with old plastic milk containers and mold it into two-by-fours , burn it as fuel , feed the seeds to your pet and even make_it into , ahem , cigarette_paper . &quot; This will grow anywhere , all_the way from Canada down to most of the U.S. , if not all_of the U.S. This is the finest thing we could be growing to replace forest , &quot; enthused George Tyson , general_manager of Xymax 2001 , a Montrose , Kan. , company that has contracted with Strobel ' s farmers to convert hemp fiber into building_material . &quot; It ' s the environmental answer , and it ' s the agriculture answer. &quot; Those on the business end of the budding hemp industry are more circumspect . While acknowledging the attractions of low-THC hemp , they say the economics of growing and processing it on a large scale in North_America today remain unproven . The leading hemp processor in Britain still sells it mainly to stables as horse bedding . But there is no shortage of interest among Canada ' s recession-pummeled farmers . Fiona Briody , director of an Alberta crop development association that has a hemp license request pending , has been astonished by the number of growers in Western Canada seemingly ready to try it . Among the backers of legalizing hemp here are the Sierra Club of Eastern Canada , other environmental organizations , a handful of enthusiastic grass-roots organizations and a_few adventuresome business people . But Strobel , a lively , 65-year-old retired physical_education teacher , has become the hemp movement ' s top salesman . He brings_to the crusade the kind of bouncy enthusiasm that once led him to develop a fitness program called the Health Hustle , which has been adopted by schools throughout Canada and in parts of the United States . &quot; Let ' s face it , we farmers have an economic problem , and this might be an out , so people are pretty receptive , &quot; he said , sitting in the dining_room of the spacious Tillsonburg , Ontario , home that serves as Hemp Headquarters , Canada . &quot; We know it can be grown here because it ' s been grown here before , ( and ) . . . the potential is about unlimited . Somewhere it will pay off. &quot; Strobel retired from teaching seven years ago and began devoting all his time to the family tobacco farm , about 85 miles southwest of Toronto . Tobacco remains profitable , he said , but needs to be grown in rotation with other crops . Strobel and his wife , Judith , tried a variety of alternatives , but &quot; nothing really paid_off . It pays the taxes and nothing else , so we were looking_for something. &quot; Last year , that something turned_out to be hemp . Since then , Strobel ' s quest has taken him around Canada and into the United States . He has rummaged through abandoned warehouses in Kentucky where hemp was grown legally in the 1940s as a wartime measure , compiled back issues of High_Times magazine , collected hemp paper with marijuana leaf watermarks and picked through records and photos of early 20th-Century Canadian hemp cultivation . Now he speaks with confidence about potential crop yields , prices per acre and transit costs . Because the bill before Parliament will not pass in time for planting season this year , Strobel ' s consortium , using existing law , has asked_for an experimental license to grow 18 acres of hemp in scattered locations near Tillsonburg . They hope to harvest 80 tons and have reached agreement with processors in Canada and the United States for production of a variety of products . Other , similar proposals are pending from elsewhere in Canada , including Alberta . They await final approval by the Bureau of Dangerous Drugs of Health Canada , which grants a handful of licenses annually , mainly for academic and law_enforcement research . While Strobel acknowledged the debt he owes to the pro-pot crowd , who turned him on to the potential of hemp in the first place , he stressed that the kind of cannabis that he wants to grow should not be confused with what he calls &quot; the happy stuff. &quot; Although it is of the same species , cannabis grown for hemp has been specially developed in Europe through selective breeding . The main difference is the low-THC factor of commercial stocks . The pending law in Canada would call_for testing seeds and plants to ensure a THC content no higher than 0.3 % . THC concentrations in marijuana generally range from about 3 % to more_than 5 % , according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug_Abuse . Nonetheless , Stuart Carpenter , director of Hemcore Ltd . in Essex , England , Britain ' s major processor , said hemp farmers there have occasional problems with night raiders snipping cuttings from low-THC plants and presumably peddling them as marijuana seedlings . Those who want to legalize the drug say they back the hemp movement out of environmental concerns and the assumption that acceptance of legalized , low-THC hemp eventually will erode the ban on the high-THC variety . The law that would authorize growth of low-THC hemp would also toughen penalties for marijuana use . Participation of the pro-pot crowd has caused some political obstacles and awkward moments . Ken Masse , 44 , who farms 1 # 800 acres of peas , wheat , barley and oats in central Alberta , and is applying for a license to grow an experimental hemp plot , said , &quot; What we really need is a name change , because as soon as you say hemp , people think_of marijuana and half the population gets_up in arms. &quot; Hemp originated_in Asia and is known to have grown in China as early as 2800 BC . For most of history it mainly has been used as a source for rope , twine and canvas ; a 1943 U.S._government film , now gleefully exhibited by marijuana advocates , notes that the rope , sails and rigging of &quot; our beloved Old Ironsides &quot; were made from hemp . The crop was legally grown in the United States and Canada until the 1930s , when it was banned in both countries as an illicit drug . Hemp was briefly grown under license in the United States during World_War_II when the Japanese overran most hemp-growing countries , interrupting the U.S. supply . Canadian environmentalists were first attracted to hemp as an alternative to lumbering , a considerable lure in a country that still permits clear cutting of old-growth forest . But the Establishment patina of agriculture and business have lent invaluable credibility to a movement that still carries a lingering whiff of counterculture . Larry Duprey , president of a 23-year-old Montreal-based fashion accessory distribution firm , is importing hemp fabric and making caps , shirts and other clothing . Carpenter , the_British hemp processor , began contracting with English growers mainly for horse bedding , but his company is moving_into hemp paper and textiles . He noted that &quot; it ' s an extremely difficult crop to process . We ' ve had to develop our own specialty machinery. &quot; Briody , the Alberta farm official , said that after studying the crop in the_Netherlands , Romania and Russia , &quot; the yields definitely aren ' t what some people say. &quot; But Briody said farmers in the association are undeterred . As Gar Knutson , a Liberal member_of_Parliament from Ontario who supports legalization and licensing of low-THC hemp , put it : &quot; Agriculture has been so bad anyway , what do we have to lose by trying_out hemp for a while ? &quot;</TEXT>
