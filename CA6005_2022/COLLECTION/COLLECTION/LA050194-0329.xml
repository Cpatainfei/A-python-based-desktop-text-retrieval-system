   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : MID-CITY : KOREATOWN ; KBLA ' S ' VOICES ' TRIES TO CUT THE STATIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For two hours on Sunday nights , the city ' s dissonant chorus of multiethnic voices can tune_in to a radio talk_show designed to put everyone on the same wavelength . &quot; Hi , everyone . This is Clara Young and welcome once again to ' Voices of Los Angeles. ' &quot; With that introduction , Young , the host and producer , launches into the topic of the week . Sometimes it ' s heavy -- domestic violence , teen pregnancy , gangs , interracial relationships -- and sometimes it covers lighter fare like sports or ethnic comedians . She began the show about seven months ago to &quot; help each of us understand each other and to encourage people to come_forth and talk_about problems as well as their pride in their cultures. &quot; For Young , a 33-year-old bilingual journalist who has worked for KCOP-TV Channel 13 , the Korea Times , KSCI-TV Channel 18 and as a production manager for NBC Sports ' 1988 Summer Olympics coverage , &quot; Voices of Los Angeles &quot; is a labor_of_love for which she receives minimal remuneration . &quot; I call it my hobby , &quot; she said . Broadcast from 9-11 p.m. in English on KBLA-AM 1580 , Young ' s show has attracted an audience eager to hear minorities on the air or curious about perspectives different from their own . KBLA leases most of its airtime to Radio Korea for Korean-language programming , but Young has carved out an English-language niche with her Sunday night show and her &quot; Korean-American Hour , &quot; which airs at 6 a.m. Saturdays and Sundays . The latter show provides a forum for young Korean Americans -- cultural hybrids shaped by often competing influences and pressures -- to talk_about problems and experiences their parents may have trouble comprehending . Young , who was born in Seoul , Korea , moved to the United States with her family when she was 9 . She casts a wider net Sundays , in search of topics , guests and callers spanning the city ' s spectrum . &quot; I think people want more information because they are really wondering what other ethnic_groups are like , &quot; Young said . &quot; We make jokes about the stereotypes that always come_up . &quot; I want to get the average person ' s perspective because most people say that so-called community leaders don ' t speak_for them. &quot; Listeners tell Young that the show often reveals similarities between people of different backgrounds . &quot; People will be listening to someone talk and they ' ll go , ' Huh . that ' s interesting . I didn ' t know that about Koreans or African Americans. ' And maybe next time they ' ll be more open-minded , &quot; she said . JAKE DOHERTY</TEXT>
