   <HEADLINE> U.S. TRIES TO KEEP KIDNAPING FROM DERAILING PEACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , in a long day of meetings with top leaders of Israel and Syria , tried Thursday to prevent the kidnaping of an Israeli soldier from demolishing the fragile Middle_East peace process . In late-night comments to reporters after meetings in Damascus with Syrian President Hafez Assad and in Tel Aviv with Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , Christopher said the talks are &quot; probably the most substantive and serious discussions I ' ve had with both of them since the process began. &quot; Still , the militant Islamic group Hamas threatened to roll back more_than a year of progress toward Palestinian self-government in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip by seizing and threatening to kill Nachshon Waxman , a 19-year-old Israeli soldier . The capture of Waxman , who holds both Israeli and U.S. citizenship , dominated Christopher ' s meeting with Rabin , forcing them to truncate other topics . Rabin broke_off talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization over Palestinian self-rule after the kidnaping . But he said Israel will continue its negotiations with Jordan , Syria and Lebanon . Talking to reporters after the meeting , Christopher endorsed Israel ' s claim that the PLO and its chairman , Yasser Arafat , &quot; bear a heavy responsibility &quot; for obtaining Waxman ' s release , even though he is being held by Hamas , a rival for the allegiance of Palestinians in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . But Christopher also noted that only Rabin can decide if the crime will be allowed to wreck the peace process . Christopher accused Hamas of waging &quot; a desperate rear guard action &quot; to stop Palestinian self-government , which would bolster the PLO ' s claim to represent the Palestinian population . &quot; Hamas is recognizing the progress that ' s being made , recognizing the transformation of the landscape , and is taking these actions out of desperation , &quot; he said . &quot; Hamas will not be permitted . . . to kill the prospects for peace. &quot; But when a reporter asked if Hamas had not already succeeded in disrupting the peace , Christopher replied : &quot; That will really be up_to the ( Israeli ) prime minister. &quot; He said Rabin can resume the peace talks at any time . Later , in Damascus , Christopher said he urged Assad to use his influence to obtain Waxman ' s release . He said terrorism should accelerate , rather than slow , the peace process because &quot; only the enemies of peace benefit from delay. &quot; The kidnaping overshadowed a week of shuttle diplomacy by Christopher focusing_on Israel-Syria negotiations . He was uncharacteristically optimistic after a stop in Damascus on Tuesday . But he seemed more reserved after visiting both countries Thursday . Nevertheless , Itamar Rabinovich , Israel ' s ambassador to the United States , told Israeli reporters before Thursday ' s Christopher-Rabin meeting that &quot; there is a new creative Syrian thinking that is designed to advance the negotiations. &quot; Rabin was far more restrained , saying Syria has made some new proposals but most failed to touch_on the dispute ' s core issues . &quot; There are things which may sound more accommodating , but the gaps remain large and it would take a great amount_of_time and effort on the part of the secretary_of_state to have those gaps bridged , &quot; he said . On the most promising track of the complex peace process , Rabin said he hopes to be able to sign a formal peace_treaty with Jordan this year . Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres made an unannounced trip to Amman on Wednesday to meet King Hussein and other Jordanian officials . Israeli news_reports said the treaty will be signed_in mid-November in the United States .</TEXT>
