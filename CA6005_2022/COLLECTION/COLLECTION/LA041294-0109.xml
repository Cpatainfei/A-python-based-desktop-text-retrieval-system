   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENT ; WHO CAN BRITONS TRUST WITH THEIR NATIONAL TREASURES ? ; CRITICS SAY TOO MANY VISITORS SPOIL THE SITES AND FOSTER COMMERCIALISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Britain is a treasure_house of historical buildings , monuments and archeological sites , and the National Trust , which celebrates its centenary next year , holds the key to many of them . But the National Trust and other organizations in the &quot; heritage industry &quot; face a problem that also confronts the U.S. national_park system : Where to draw_the_line between visitor access and preservation . Easier access means ever more tourists and the need to accommodate them with an infrastructure of services that often intrude_on the beauty of the attraction . Some critics , such_as architectural expert Colin Amery , grumble that too many of Britain ' s treasures have been unnecessarily &quot; tarted up &quot; to please a public that is more interested in the on-site tearooms and shops than in the attraction itself . &quot; We ' re in danger of turning our heritage into one vast theme park , &quot; says Amery , who writes for the Financial Times . &quot; But I suppose that ' s because the heritage industry is one of our few growth_industries . We don ' t make anything anymore in Britain . We just show visitors our past. &quot; And Peter Jackson , a member of the National Trust ' s ruling council , complains that some of the visitors ' facilities &quot; cost a fortune , &quot; which might be_better spent buying or maintaining historic properties . &quot; If I had it to do over again , &quot; Jackson adds , &quot; I think I would oppose some of the more elaborate facilities. &quot; Other critics suggest that some of the National Trust ' s most popular properties are beginning to resemble Alton Towers , a well-known amusement_park , in terms of their operations . The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty -- National Trust , for short -- is Britain ' s largest charitable institution , and now has more_than 2 million members who support it . It is the largest landowner in Britain with 573 # 000 acres -- hill , dale , lake , forest , inland waterways , seacoast , nature reserves , even villages -- Lacock in Wiltshire and West Wycombe in Buckinghamshire -- belonging_to the Trust in perpetuity and open_to the public . The Trust also owns an estimated 40 # 000 archeological sites including prehistoric and Roman antiquities . Among its properties is part of Roman Emperor Hadrian ' s Wall across northern Britain . Most visible are its more_than 200 historic buildings , open_to visitors , including castles and abbeys , barns , mills and stately homes . To administer and care_for the properties , the Trust employs about 3 # 000 salaried staff_members and relies_on 25 # 000 volunteers as wardens , accountants , surveyors , gamekeepers and guides . And catering to visitors , the National Trust provides parking_lots , information centers , more_than 200 shops , restaurants , 128 tea rooms , lavatories and other facilities , including 200 holiday cottages . * Therein lies the problem . Is more money devoted to the ancillary facilities than to the main attraction . Or as a close observer of the operations put it : &quot; Some believe the Trust has become too_large , too unwieldy and too commercial. &quot; There is , in fact , an organization called National Trust Enterprises which is responsible_for commercial operations . Its main activities are retailing in shops_at the properties and in independent town shops ; serving in restaurants , tearooms and refreshment kiosks and the letting of holiday cottages . These activities provide operating capital for the fund ' s more traditional obligations , officials say . Less than half of its annual budget comes from subscriptions , gifts and legacies ; National Trust Enterprises comes_up with the rest , more_than $ 10 million last year . But local residents complain when the Trust sets_up tourist centers in towns near historic attractions , such_as the plan to build one near Snowshill Manor , in the heart of the Cotswolds . Another criticism is that the Trust has overexpanded , acquiring more sites than it can afford to maintain properly . &quot; I can see why people would be upset about Britain being turned_into a theme park , &quot; says Rodney Legg , a member of the Trust Council and chairman of the Open Spaces Society . &quot; It will have a negative effect on Trust-giving . The Trust is becoming over-stretched . I wish we hadn ' t gone as far as we have with acquiring properties which need high revenue to keep them intact. &quot; Yet there ' s a compelling urge to preserve as much as possible of the historical symbols of this country with a passion for its past . Ten years ago , for instance , the Trust acquired Fountains Abbey in North_Yorkshire , the site of the largest monastic ruin in Britain , which , together with its extensive gardens of Studley Royal , was subsequently designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO . A number of National Trust houses , many of the grand country manors , have associations with famous people -- for instance , Wimpole Hall , Cambridgeshire ( Rudyard Kipling ) , Ayot St . Lawrence , Hertfordshire ( George Bernard Shaw ) , Chartwell , Kent ( Sir Winston Churchill ) , Washington Old Hall , Tyne and Wear County ( the family of George_Washington ) and Cliveden ( American-born Lady Nancy Astor ) . * In all , about 12 million people have visited National Trust properties , and countless more have enjoyed free access to the countryside and coastal areas owned by the Trust . The Trust was founded in 1895 and given a mandate by Parliament in 1907 &quot; to promote the permanent preservation for the benefit of the nation land and buildings of beauty or historic interest. &quot; Its properties can never be sold or mortgaged , nor acquired by public authorities , without the special consent of Parliament . Another conservation organization , English Heritage , also acquires historic properties , particularly monuments , ancient and modern , as well as buildings of historic interest in and around London . English Heritage owns , among other sites , that heavily visited ancient structure of Stonehenge . English Heritage is a quasi-governmental body , supported primarily by public funds voted annually by Parliament , whereas the National Trust is a charity primarily dependent_on membership subscriptions and donations . In the United States , the National Trust maintains a branch called the Royal Oak Foundation , with 16 # 000 members who have contributed more_than $ 1 million for the restoration of Trust properties . Some critics suggest that the National Trust should follow the lead of English Heritage , which -- under the chairmanship of the abrasive , dynamic , former publisher Jocelyn Stevens -- has begun to divest itself of some properties , turning them over to local_government authorities . Critics liken English Heritage ' s divestiture policy to selling_off the family silver , and the policy is also controversial because the local authorities , like a London borough , often do not have the resources -- or desire -- to supervise and protect local monuments or listed houses . Listed houses and buildings are those built between 1700 and 1940 that are considered of &quot; exceptional &quot; or &quot; particular &quot; national importance . The National Trust itself often leases its lands and properties to others to manage , ranging from agricultural plots to the famous Cliveden house , leased to a hotel corporation to run as hostelry for the paying public -- with 37 double rooms at about $ 350 a night . Sometimes leasing can run_afoul of public_opinion , as in the case where farmers permit fox or deer hunting on leased Trust lands . Peter Jackson , the National Trust council_member , argues : &quot; I think conducting blood sports on Trust land is a great mistake and is causing a lot of offense among our members. &quot; * As for commercialization , Colin Amery , the architectural expert , complains that some visitors prefer the shops to the attraction itself . &quot; The National Trust is getting like Marks &amp; Spencer ( department_store ) with everything the same quality. &quot; But a spokeswoman for the National Trust points_out that visitors like and expect tearooms and restaurants . &quot; We operate 128 tearooms and they are profitable , as are the souvenir shops , &quot; she says . &quot; We are aware that there are ghastly souvenirs sold in this country , but we monitor what is sold under the National Trust logo very carefully . We think they are in_good_taste . &quot; The basic problem is money : Once we received funds from generous donors and from rental of agricultural lands . But donations , rents and government grants are down , and costs are up. &quot; National Trust official Caroline Audemars sums_up : &quot; We are trying to protect the Trust land and properties . We are trying to serve the public . We are trying to strike a proper balance between access and conservation . It ' s a huge responsibility. &quot;</TEXT>
