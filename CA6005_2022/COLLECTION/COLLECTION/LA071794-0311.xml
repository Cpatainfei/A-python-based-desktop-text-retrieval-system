   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : THE FINALS ; IT MIGHT BE THE GAME THAT KEEPS_ON GIVING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Proclamation by Edward_II , King_of_England , 1314 : &quot; Forasmuch as there is a great noise in the City caused by a hustling over large balls , from which many evils may arise , which , God forbid , we command and forbid , on behalf of the King , on pain of imprisonment , such game to be used in the City in future. &quot; Good_afternoon , and welcome to World Cup Sunday . You are looking live at the beautiful Rose Bowl on a warm and pleasantly earthquake-free day here in Pasadena , where , in a_few moments , Brazil and Italy will play before a crowd of , well , Brazil and Italy . This will be the final game of the World Cup ' 94 finals , finally , after an outstanding tournament that included 23 outstanding teams , plus Greece . We would like to take this moment to remind everyone that World Cup ' 98 qualifying matches will begin immediately following today ' s World Cup ' 94 championship matches , with England hoping to advance past the always pesky Falkland Islands . And here come the Brazilians ! Hand in_hand , as always , led into the stadium by their great stars , Bebeto , Pinocchio , Romario and Julietto . Just look_at these brave young_men , so handsome in their bright_blue shirts . And now the Italians ! Marching_out in formation led by , as always , their great stars , Roberto Baggio , Dino Baggio , Gianluca Baggio , Giuseppe Baggio and their fine coach , Arrigo Baggio . Just look_at these brave young_men , so handsome in their . . . uh , wait a minute , their bright_blue shirts ? Someone has obviously made a serious wardrobe error here today and we hope to correct this problem quickly , please stand_by . Ah , now the Brazilians peel_off their blue shirts to reveal their yellow shirts underneath , and they offer their blue shirts to the Italians as a gesture of true and splendid sportsmanship . Well done ! And now the Italians look just a little confused , possibly because none of them has remembered to bring any gifts for the Brazilians in return . I can see the Brazil players down there now , tapping their feet impatiently , as if to say : &quot; Where are our gifts , you cheap Europeans , you ? &quot; Ah , now Roberto Baggio is leafing through a little black_book and handing each Brazilian player a slip_of_paper with the private home telephone_number of Madonna . Well done ! Our national_anthems today will be performed by Mr. Placido Domingo , still somewhat upset , we understand , over last night ' s controversial concert in which the great tenor Luciano Pavarotti shocked a sellout crowd with his renditions of Elvis Presley ' s &quot; Blue Hawaii &quot; and &quot; Jailhouse Rock. &quot; I believe Mr. Domingo was outraged over this decision to sing popular_music , particularly with no voice whatsoever in choosing the Presley compositions over Mr. Domingo ' s personal preferences for Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson . And the game begins ! Baggio over to Baggio , now back to Baggio , who heads it over to Baggio . Italy is playing cautiously at this moment , obviously saving its strength for the next 89 minutes and 50 seconds . And a yellow card goes_to Leonardo of Brazil , who complains angrily that he is not even in the game . that ' s another bit of bad_luck for Leonardo , who is one more yellow card away from another red card , which would make him ineligible to play soccer again until the Paraguay Bob Hope Pro-Am in late 1999 . Dunga steals the ball and finds Rai , who kicks it over to Bebeto , who runs_down the field looking_for Romario , who is taking a nap near that flag where they do the corner_kicks . Bebeto kicks Romario and yells , &quot; Wake_up ! &quot; Romario waves Bebeto away and says , &quot; Call me in the 80th minute if we need a goal. &quot; Romario rolls_over and goes_back to sleep . Uh-oh . There goes Giuseppe Signori , one of the rare non-Baggio players on the Italian team , past the Snickers sign , past the Fuji sign , past the Gillette sign , slowing_down now near the Budweiser sign , delayed for two hours by the American Airlines sign , now gaining new strength at the Energizer sign and sprinting alongside the Sprint sign . Signori shoots ! And scores ! The ball goes_past a very surprised Claudio Taffarel , the Brazil goalkeeper , who was leaning_against a post eating a sandwich , not expecting anyone to shoot the ball in his direction , momentarily forgetting that he was not playing Sweden . Goooooooooool ! Brazil ' s coach , Carlos Alberto Parreira , is hopping mad . Just look_at that man hop . By reading his lips , I can see that Parreira is instructing his players : &quot; Please , please , please , please , please score some goals so that when I go_home everybody will like me ! &quot; Well done . Bebeto shoots . Goooooooooool ! Romario shoots . Goooooooooool ! Dunga shoots . Goooooooooool ! Mazinho shoots . Goooooooooool ! Well , that little talk by Parreira certainly did seem to help . Brazil seems well on its way to another World Cup championship , so_much so that Romario has gone_back into his corner for another short nap . Don ' t forget , though , should Italy come_back to tie the score in the second_half , there will be a 30-minute overtime_period to decide the winner , followed by penalty kicks , followed by a coin toss , followed by picking a number from one to 10 , followed by the traditional ceremony in which the Italian men go_up into the stands and kiss all_the women .</TEXT>
