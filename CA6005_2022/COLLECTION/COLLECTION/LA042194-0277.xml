   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : TUSTIN ; BOYS , GIRLS TO WATCH SEX VIDEOS SEPARATELY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Boys and girls in sixth and seventh grades in Tustin Unified School District will no longer watch sex education videos together , after complaints from parents who said the practice is inappropriate . School district trustees adopted the same-sex viewing policy after Monday ' s town_hall meeting in which some parents demanded that they see the videos first before they are shown to their children . One parent , Mike McClay , suggested that the videos not be shown at all until a panel of parents could determine if the materials are appropriate for 12- and 13-year-olds . The school district began showing the videos that contain information on AIDS , HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases to sixth- and seventh-grade students this year as part of the health curriculum . Peggy Lynch , the assistant superintendent for instructional services , said that the videos are shown during science classes , which both boys and girls attend . But Lynch said that boys and girls do not discuss the contents of the videos together . Under the new plan approved Monday , boys and girls will watch and discuss the videos separately . About 50 parents attended the town_hall meeting and several expressed outrage at the showing of the videos , which they said used slang language to describe sexual situations and body_parts . In addition , the videos , particularly the one featuring former basketball star Earvin ( Magic ) Johnson , do not stress abstinence strongly enough . &quot; We don ' t think Magic is a good role_model , &quot; said Bart Hansen , a parent . &quot; His advice of safe_sex gives kids a false sense of security. &quot; In the video called &quot; Magic Johnson : A Conversation With Magic , &quot; the former Lakers star says that postponing sex until marriage is the best attitude . But he urges those who are having_sex to use a condom . Parents also objected to the video &quot; Who Am I Now ? , &quot; which is intended for sixth-graders , and &quot; Kids to Kids , &quot; which is shown to seventh-grade students . Some contain slang terminology , &quot; said Sandy Kenny , who prohibited his son , a seventh-grader at A.G. Currie Middle_School , from watching &quot; Kids to Kids. &quot; Two videos , produced by a company that manufactures sanitary_napkins , also contain scenes on how to use sanitary_napkins , which are embarrassing to girls , Kenny said . But Lynch said that the videos , which are also used in other school districts , were approved last year by the school_board after a review by a panel of teachers and administrators . Lynch said students can watch the videos only after getting a written consent from their parents . Last year , the videos were made available to the public for comment , but no one opposed them , she said . &quot; I guess we provided the opportunities before , &quot; Lynch said . &quot; But we respect ( parents ' ) viewpoint. &quot; District Supt . David Andrews said that changes in the way the videos are presented are being made in the interest of the students . &quot; we ' ll continue to assess what we are doing , &quot; Andrews said . &quot; We have to listen to what the community is saying. &quot; BERT ELJERA</TEXT>
