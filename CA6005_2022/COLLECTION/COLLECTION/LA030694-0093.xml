   <HEADLINE> TWO VIEWS ON SEX ABSTINENCE WEEK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Abstinence week ? Puleez ! Costa Mesa Mayor Sandra L . Genis ' declaration is not anti-gay . It is anti-reality and anti-compassion , and about as aware as Marie Antoinette ' s declaration , &quot; Let them eat cake , &quot; in response to the starving French peasants who had no bread . The mayor of Costa Mesa appears to be_on a roll , missing the boat yet again with her flagrant misapprehension of the AIDS epidemic . Attacking the red ribbon , which symbolizes awareness of this health crisis and solidarity with those suffering from AIDS , and washing_out the &quot; blood &quot; by substituting a white ribbon is a perfect example of how many of our so-called leaders have put their heads in the sand and allowed the death toll to mount unabated . Mayor Genis , if you don ' t know how to respond to this overwhelming world crisis , just say so . Ignorance is not a crime , but acting_out of ignorance , especially in public office , can have disastrous consequences . There are several AIDS services organizations in Orange County that would provide you with valuable information , or you could attend the seventh annual &quot; HIV / AIDS on the Front_Line Conference &quot; to be held this month in your fair city . I hope you will not choose to abstain_from information yourself . MADELYNN RIGOPOULOS Huntington Beach * I write in response to your article ( &quot; Abstinence Statement Criticized as Anti-Gay , &quot; March 2 ) reporting Costa Mesa City_Council ' s declaration of Abstinence Week . I , too , support the belief that sexual_activity be delayed until marriage . The only &quot; safe_sex &quot; is within the confines of a monogamous relationship . I applaud Mayor Genis and her City_Council ' s willingness to stand on the truth . KERI COMER Irvine</TEXT>
