   <HEADLINE> CAIRO CONFEREES LINKING GROWTH , ENVIRONMENT ; POPULATION : ' WE SIMPLY CANNOT HAVE A REPLICATION OF THE AMERICAN LIFESTYLE AROUND THE WORLD , ' A DELEGATE SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jacqueline Hamilton , trying to explain the links between population and the environment , has frequently drawn_on her childhood in Southern California as an illustration . She remembers the small housing_development she grew_up in , surrounded by orange groves and avocado_trees as recently as 1972 . Friends coming_to visit had to be directed by describing natural landmarks and curves in the road . Now , she says , there ' s a Wal-Mart less than a mile from her mother ' s house , and a freeway connector passes a quarter of a mile away . The old creek has been lined with concrete . The groves are gone . It is an image familiar to many Southern Californians but vividly illustrative in this Egyptian metropolis , where a U.N. conference on global population is trying_for the first time to draw clear links between population growth and the environment . &quot; One of the great values of this process is that it finally makes the specific link between people , how they live and their consumption patterns , and how many of us there are , &quot; Hamilton , an official with the Natural_Resources Defense Council , said Sunday . As draftees at the International Conference on Population and Development recessed Sunday amid a deadlock on more controversial reproductive issues , environmental organizations said the conference has already produced important gains that go beyond a 1992 environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro , which did not address the issue of population . An environmental action program agreed on at the Cairo conference_calls for population issues to be considered in all new development projects ; special strategies to eradicate poverty and promote employment for the rural poor , and modification of consumption patterns that are eating_away at the environment . &quot; The broad , central core of our objectives was to make_sure that we achieved broad , international understanding of what ' carrying capacity ' really means and what it means for public policy , &quot; said James Hayes , director of the original 1970 Earth Day , president of a Washington-based environmental foundation and a member of the U.S. delegation to the conference . &quot; Carrying capacity is ordinarily thought of as the number of any species that a biological system can support in perpetuity . But the crucial dimension that ' s often ignored is that it ' s not just numbers , but numbers times their impact . With the American lifestyle , the world ' s carrying capacity is only about 2 billion people . We simply cannot have a replication of the American lifestyle around the world , &quot; Hayes said . &quot; This conference has recognized that , both implicitly and explicitly , and that ' s the first time that has happened at a United Nations conference . It is an extraordinary achievement. &quot; It is generally accepted that present levels of population growth cannot be sustained without great damage to the environment . But the plan under_consideration in Cairo this week also goes_far to recognize that consumption patterns play an equally important role . Although the United States has only 5 % of the world ' s people , for example , it consumes 25 % of the world ' s commercial energy , 27 % of its aluminum and more_than 20 % of its tin , copper and lead . Natural_Resources Defense Council officials say that the 55 million people born in industrialized nations during the 1990s will pollute the world more_than the 895 million born in the developing world . Environmental groups had pushed for specific policies in the conference ' s final document that would seek to lower consumption among rich nations and improve conditions among poorer ones . They had sought statements encouraging nations to adopt energy-efficient standards for new construction and equipment ; water cleanup programs ; policies making manufacturers responsible_for the wastes they generate and for wasteful packaging , and strategies to make_sure the price of goods reflects their full environmental cost . Martin Brauen , a member of the_Swiss delegation , called the policies adopted &quot; a very weak , useless formulation. &quot; He said the delegates were too consumed by a controversy over abortion policies to focus_on environmental issues . &quot; All we talk_about is abortion , and finally when we wanted to discuss the responsibility of the North , the chairman said we must hurry up . There is something wrong about that. &quot; But U.S. officials said the conference adopted each one of the American environmental team ' s goals . &quot; Rio specifically promised a future consideration of population and the environment . This is the fulfillment of the Rio promise , &quot; said Sen . John Kerry ( D-Mass. ) , an observer at both international conferences . Environmental groups sought to secure financing to carry_out the conference ' s stated objectives , estimated to cost about $ 17 billion a year . &quot; Our top priority was to ensure that there was adequate funding language in the document to make the Cairo document actionable , &quot; said Ray Pingle , a Sierra Club volunteer from Irvine . He said it is not enough for countries to merely say they will increase their funding as much as they can . &quot; We think incrementalism isn ' t going_to work anymore . Just donating more money than they did last year isn ' t going_to do_it . This is a critical time , and if we don ' t come_up with enough funds to control population growth immediately , the population is going_to triple , and the world just can ' t sustain that , &quot; Pingle said . &quot; This is an important issue for us , because we really believe that virtually all_the other battles that we fight to save the environment will be lost in the long term if we don ' t stabilize the world population. &quot;</TEXT>
