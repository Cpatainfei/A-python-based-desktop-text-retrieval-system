   <HEADLINE> CURBS ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * In response to &quot; DMV Check of Immigration Touches Off Anger and Praise , &quot; March 2 : As a former prosecutor for the Immigration and Naturalization Service , the lesson of this new law is when a state ( DMV ) agency tries to interpret a federal ( immigration ) law , what you get is a mess . Bluntly put , the DMV ' s newly published pamphlet , &quot; All You Need to Know About Birth Verification and Legal Presence Requirements , &quot; is a joke . It indicates that the DMV will issue a driver ' s license to anyone with a Canadian passport or a Mexican Border Crossing Card . Since when does the possession of foreign documents prove &quot; legal presence &quot; in California ? On the other hand , the DMV won ' t issue a license to a foreign-born student , professional or investor who the INS certifies is lawfully residing in California ! You be the judge : Should the taxpayers send California ' s DMV director to Washington to study the intricacies of federal immigration law , or should we let_INS ' Border_Patrol , rather than the clerks at the DMV , enforce the immigration laws ? Does anyone seriously expect illegal aliens to stop coming_to California because they can ' t get a driver ' s licenses ? The only predictable effects of the new law will be less people driving with licenses and auto insurance , more high-speed auto chases and more profits for those who make their living manufacturing phony green_cards . CARL SHUSTERMAN Los Angeles * Regarding the disinformation piece in the Opinion section ( &quot; Refine Immigration Policy to Reflect History and the Moment We Live In , &quot; Opinion , Feb . 27 ) , I feel that Ruben Martinez and other Reconquistas should be more honest and open about their true predilections associated with advocacy of that movement , i.e. , recover California ( for Mexico ) by the time-honored non-militant tactic of overwhelming the &quot; enemy &quot; and its resources with massive population inundation , leading to political control ( note that already he wants to give illegals the right_to_vote ) , the redistribution of wealth ( expanded entitlements eligibility ) , and ultimately realignment with the madre patria . Understanding an author ' s motivation would help readers in evaluating the stated ( often unsupported and self-serving ) conclusions such_as are replete in this column . B . F . KUNNECKE Huntington Beach * Regarding immigration , one has to question a system that makes_it far easier to enter this country illegally than legally . What sense does_it make ? I suggest we put_up along all borders turnstile gates that are accessed by simply pressing fingerprints onto a recording screen , which activates an instant photo ID-Social Security card along with a multilingual note that informs our guests , &quot; While you ' re here , you will pay taxes. &quot; The current system drives people and potential tax_revenues underground . I am going_through the system now , legally , and I ' m paying the price -- in the only non-expendable commodity : time . But , don ' t look_to the INS . It doesn ' t make the laws . Actually , my experience with the INS has been quite good . The logjams are at the U.S. consulates . It has to do with an overall self-image by our government that its mission is to control and regulate . What a wonderful world it will be when our adolescent government discovers the joy and productivity outlined by the framers in their &quot; of , by and for the people &quot; foundation for a government in_service of its populace . DAVY HOFFMAN Santa Monica * While there is a pressing need to formulate a comprehensive and effective immigration policy , organizations such_as Proponents for Responsible Immigration Debate and Education ( PRIDE ) obfuscate the real crux of the issue ( Feb 20 ) . PRIDE carries the torch for the rights of illegal immigrants , but what about the rights of the taxpaying citizens ? Can we justify spending millions of tax dollars for public_services to illegal immigrants when the state cannot afford to provide a decent education for children or provide affordable health_care to our elderly population ? Groups such_as PRIDE must realize that California can no longer afford the financial burden of illegal immigration . Claims that reform proposals are nothing more_than racist immigrant-bashing are downright false . The U.S. is the only country in the world that cannot control its own borders . Instead of hiring thousands more Border_Patrol agents , why not use the U.S. military to help enforce our immigration policies ? FRANK HILL State Senate , R-Whittier * I live most of the year every year in Portugal . I don ' t expect the Portuguese government to provide_for me in any way nor does the government encourage me or anyone else to think it . My children had to spend a semester in intensified tutoring in the language before they were permitted to attend school . It was incumbent_on them to learn the language , not for the school to provide them with instruction in English . I don ' t understand why anyone arriving here should expect the American taxpayer to provide anything . RICHARD PERKINS Palos Verdes</TEXT>
