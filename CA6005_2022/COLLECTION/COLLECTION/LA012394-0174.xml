   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : LOOK TO 480 BC IF YOU THINK L.A. ' S FUTURE IS OVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is it only wishful_thinking to hope that the earthquake will mark a turning point for the troubled Southern California economy ? Maybe not . History can be reassuring . San Francisco , destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire , was built anew by 1909 despite an outbreak of bubonic_plague in 1907 . It had determination in those days and proclaimed that by holding the Portola Festival in 1906 to symbolize the recovery of the city . &quot; Overcoming obstacles produces improvisation and vitality in economic life , &quot; says Jane Jacobs , author of &quot; Cities and the Wealth of Nations &quot; and other noted works_on urban societies . But history also can be demanding ; cities are renewed by human energy . San Francisco has not recovered with the same vigor from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake . It has shown a hesitation to take bold action , a slowness to try new methods . &quot; It can ' t decide whether it wants to be Carmel or Calcutta , &quot; quips historian Kevin Starr , a former San Francisco resident who now teaches at USC and lives in Los Angeles . For Los Angeles ' recovery , determination and imagination will be more important than money . The money will be there . City officials believe that ultimately more_than $ 5 billion in federal aid will flow to reconstruction of highways and buildings and other forms of disaster relief . In Washington , White_House plans are for a $ 2-billion economic recovery package immediately . Make no mistake , there will be losses . The cost of lives lost and the effect of homes destroyed is incalculable , of course . The measurable economic costs are forbidding : Gov . Pete Wilson estimates the quake ' s total costs at $ 30 billion . Industry estimates so far say that only $ 2 billion of damaged property was insured . So business people will be faced with tough decisions about investment and rebuilding in a troubled economy ; one has to make a profit to repay even low-interest government loans . Even then , don ' t forget all_the federal , state and private money that rebuilds damaged highways and structures only brings the economy back to the line_of_scrimmage . And other costs continue , such_as the economic penalty for having sections of the Santa Monica , Golden State and other freeways unusable for more_than a year . Still , rebuilding will create thousands of construction jobs , revitalizing a major industry that has been in recession for four years . Also the economy could get an immediate boost from consumers buying home repair supplies and making purchases postponed during the crisis . But the real payoffs -- and the factors that could determine Los Angeles ' future -- will come_in new thinking , in the ingenuity and dedication city officials and business people show in turning obstacles into opportunities . &quot; With 150 school buildings closed indefinitely , possibilities open_up for the school district to think_of new ways to instruct children , to try new methods , &quot; says Francine Rabinovitz , of Hamilton , Rabinovitz &amp; Alschuler , a Los Angeles public policy consulting_firm that has worked with New York ' s school district . &quot; There are opportunities to change the way the city has operated for decades , &quot; says William Ouchi , a UCLA economist who works in the administration of Mayor Richard Riordan . Specifically , says Ouchi , City_Hall officials are thinking_of unused rail tracks that parallel the Santa Monica Freeway . &quot; With federal help , we could clean_up those rails and put transit on them , &quot; he says . * Serious thought and planning has begun for many transit and commuting innovations to be tried over the coming year , Ouchi reports . Use of telecommuting and flexible hours will continue after the crisis . Shared jitney cabs , an enlargement of the city ' s wide-ranging , entrepreneurial airport shuttle services , is an idea receiving a lot of attention . &quot; The spread of the Los Angeles area militates against fixed transit routes , but shuttles which can deliver passengers to their door or street could be valuable , &quot; says Paul Curcio , head of the Urban Innovations Group at UCLA . Greater insurance would be needed for the shuttle entrepreneurs , but the city could help with that . However , there is one hesitation : &quot; Regulations would have to be changed before shuttles could serve as mass public_transit vehicles , &quot; Curcio says . And that ' s the kind of test Los Angeles will have to pass if it is to prosper : Will it adapt regulations to meet new circumstances , to build and work anew , or will it be timid and hidebound ? It ' s a critical question . Cities do not fail from disasters . After the great fire of 1666 , London rebuilt with the inspiration of architect Christopher Wren , who built St . Paul ' s Cathedral and many other structures . Chicago had 6 # 000 temporary shelters thrown_up within a week of its great fire in October 1871 , and went_on to build much more strongly than before . But cities do fail from within . Ancient Rome died in the century AD 300 to 400 , not from defeat in war , but from stagnation as taxes supported a growing mercenary soldiery and civil_service , and people moved away to a simpler life on farms . The Visigoths sacked Rome in AD 410 . &quot; We do have a danger of business people moving_out . The earthquake could be one more straw on top of over-regulation and bureaucracy , &quot; says a local business_leader . But in the quake ' s immediate aftermath , defeat was not the trend . With few exceptions , government_agencies and private utilities worked efficiently . The region ' s economy was rising before the earthquake , and business people broadly are prepared to invest anew -- especially if reconstruction is carried_on with vigor . Sociologist Jane Jacobs , who is now 77 and lives in Toronto , agrees . She would be surprised if Los Angeles , which she calls one of the great world cities , faded . Cities fail , she says , &quot; when they keep_on doing the same thing . Don ' t try to restore things as they were ; that lacks imagination and leads to stagnation. &quot; * Los Angeles and Southern California have always come_up with innovations for their own needs that are then sent_out to others , notes Jacobs . &quot; You ' re a semi-desert yet you became a great port ; you made products for the movies , and for builders and aircraft . You have skills that didn ' t drop from the sky , &quot; she says . Put another way , it ' s no accident that Southern California leads the nation and the world in environmental_science and technology . &quot; Solving problems is very good for economies , &quot; says Jacobs . &quot; Never fear , if you come_up with useful solutions , they ' ll be useful for others , too. &quot; Determination and imagination , not wishful_thinking , built this metropolis -- and can rebuild it again . History is reassuring . &quot; The Persians sacked Athens in 480 BC , &quot; says Kevin Starr , &quot; and after that the Athenians built the Acropolis , the Parthenon and the port city of Piraeus. &quot; Los Angeles has work to do .</TEXT>
