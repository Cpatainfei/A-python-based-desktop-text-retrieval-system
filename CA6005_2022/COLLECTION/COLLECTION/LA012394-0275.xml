   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; LESSONS FROM THE PAST HOLD_UP WELL ; CALTRANS GETS CONFIRMATION OF ITS QUAKE-PROOFING REMEDIES AS MOST RETROFITTED OVERPASSES WITHSTAND 6.6 JOLT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Engineers combing through collapsed freeways in the wake of Monday ' s Northridge earthquake say they knew how to prevent the destruction but simply ran_out of time before disaster struck . Although the last three major quakes -- Sylmar , Whittier Narrows and Loma Prieta -- all revealed significant deficiencies in freeway overpass construction , they also taught Caltrans and industrial engineers important lessons about quake-proofing vital arteries , and those lessons seem to have been learned well , experts said this week . All of the 122 Southern California overpasses that had been retrofitted survived the magnitude 6.6 temblor and , with one exception , the 11 that collapsed were_on the list for future retrofitting . The exception was the Mission / Gothic interchange on the Simi Valley Freeway ( California 118 ) , close to the quake ' s epicenter . &quot; If Caltrans had known it was sitting on an active fault , it would have been_on the list too , &quot; USC engineer James Moore said . The overpass collapses were traced to well-known mechanisms and &quot; the retrofit remedies that have been and are being installed could almost certainly have saved all_of these bridges , &quot; said structural engineer Nigel Priestly of UC San Diego . All the bridges in Los Angeles were scheduled to have been retrofitted by the end of next year . Nearly all_of the bridge failures in Monday ' s temblor could be traced to fracturing of the shorter columns supporting the roadbeds . Studies of collapses in previous quakes have shown that the rigidity and brittleness of the shortest columns limited their ability to flex like the taller pillars on the same spans . That appears to be the cause of the failures in Monday ' s quake as well . Scientists say that fracturing can be prevented by jacketing the columns in steel . This has been the major thrust of retrofitting in the last five years . The retrofitting now being done is based on knowledge gained during the three previous large quakes . The 1971 magnitude 6.4 Sylmar quake showed engineers that bridge spans could slide off their supporting columns if the spans were not physically joined together . Since the temblor Caltrans has installed hinge_joints -- a series of steel cables that hold the spans together -- on all bridges in the state , a task that was completed in 1989 . Those have worked successfully . In the 5.9 Whittier Narrows quake in 1987 , engineers were stunned when the supporting_column on a ramp connecting Interstate 5 and Interstate 605 burst under compression from the quake . That triggered research on so-called single-column bridges , most of them on- and off-ramps , in which each span is supported by a single column in the center . That research led to the technique of jacketing the columns in steel and concrete for extra strength . Close on the heels of Whittier Narrows , the magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta temblor in 1989 put the spotlight on overpasses with supporting_columns of different lengths . The relationship between the two types of columns is roughly similar to that of the reed and the oak_tree , Priestly said . In a windstorm , the reed escapes damage by bending with the wind . It can be bent nearly parallel to the ground without being damaged because of its flexibility , thereby riding_out the fiercest storms . But the oak_tree resists bending , and thus absorbs the full force of the wind , eventually shattering . A similar situation occurs on freeway overpasses . Tall pillars bend with the sideways movement caused by a quake , but shorter , more brittle ones resist bending . Because all_the pillars are linked by the bridge , however , the bending of the tall pillars causes most of the force to be transferred to the short pillars , which are not designed to absorb such forces . Therefore , they shatter , losing their load-bearing ability and causing the overpasses to fall . That seems to have happened at nearly every overpass that failed in Monday ' s temblor , Priestly said , including the interchange of Interstate 5 and the Antelope Valley Freeway ( California 14 ) in Sylmar . Some geologists have speculated that unusual vertical acceleration of the ground at that interchange caused the pillars to punch through the overpass , &quot; but that is not our reading of what happened there , &quot; Priestly said . &quot; The short column adjacent to the south abutment attracted a very high shear force . It had little transverse ( sideways ) reinforcement , so it failed , lost its load-bearing capacity and dragged the rest of the structure down. &quot; The solution to the problem is simple , experts say , and is virtually the same solution as that for single-column bridges . After the 1987 Whittier quake , engineers began jacketing the columns in steel-reinforced concrete to bolster them against cracking . By preventing large chunks from shearing off , the jacketing renders the short columns more flexible , allowing them to bend as much as five inches , compared to a maximum of about one inch before retrofitting . After Loma Prieta , Caltrans identified 860 freeway and highway bridges in the state that required retrofitting of the short columns ; 456 of them are in the Los Angeles area , according to James Roberts , the agency ' s chief bridge engineer . Of those 456 , 122 bridges have been retrofitted -- including all single-column bridges -- and work is in_progress on another 43 , he said . Contracts for the remainder will be let this year , he said , and &quot; by the end of 1995 they should all be finished. &quot; It costs an average of $ 500 # 000 to retrofit each bridge and requires about a year of work , he said . Caltrans has received high marks from academic engineers for its methodical approach to retrofitting the bridges . At the beginning of the process , Caltrans assessed each bridge ' s age , design , traffic load and proximity to faults . Those with the highest ratings received first priority . The overpasses on the Santa Monica Freeway were of intermediate priority and , in fact , contracts for their retrofitting were scheduled to be issued in the next couple of months . The others that collapsed had lower priorities . &quot; Caltrans has acted very responsibly within the constraints of available resources , &quot; said USC ' s Moore , one of the state ' s few structural engineers who does not receive funding from the agency . About the only criticism that has been directed against the agency involves the collapsed ramp at the Interstate 5 / California 14 interchange . The interchange was under construction at the time of the Sylmar quake , when a different ramp collapsed and was subsequently rebuilt . The ramp that collapsed Monday was completed under the old quake guidelines in_force when construction began in 1971 . Some critics , such_as Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) , charged this week that Caltrans should have held_off on construction of the interchange until new guidelines were issued . But they were not developed until the end of 1973 , Roberts said , and there would have been howls of outrage if the freeway had been delayed that long . Roberts said retrofitting of the collapsed interchange could have been completed before Monday ' s quake had it not been held_up for more_than a year to obtain special equipment to deal with geological irregularities under the interchange . &quot; There are some pretty terrible geologic formations down there ( under the footings ) , &quot; he said . FREEWAY FAILURES If there is a reassuring element to the roadway failures , it is that there were no surprises . Engineers suspected certain elements of the L.A. freeway system were at risk , and it was those elements that indeed failed . And retrofitting techniques can eliminate many of the potential trouble spots . Short Columns the Main Culprits Engineers believe most failures can be traced to less flexible short supports . * In a quake , long columns survive because they sway slightly . * Short columns , unable to bend , absorb horizontal energy produced by longer columns and blow_out . The Solution Jacketing short columns actually makes them more flexible , allowing them to bend up_to five times as much . It reduces the force they must absorb and makes them less likely to break . REPLACING THE I-10 Parts of the Southland ' s busiest road -- the Santa Monica Freeway -- will have to be replaced from the ground up . A look_at what has to be done : 1 . Damaged freeway demolished and removed . 2 . Columns poured , reinforced with steel 3 . Girders go_up by crane , providing a skeleton for roadway 4 . Plywood fitted over girders as forms for roadway ' s lower slab 5 . Concrete poured ; plywood removed 6 . Plywood forms placed over lower slab ; concrete for road_surface is poured Quick_Fix Officials are considering erecting temporary bridges on the Santa Monica and Simi Valley freeways . The temporary structures would allow a partial flow of traffic on one side of the roadway while workers construct the permanent ones . Bolstering the Bridge By wrapping older columns in steel casings , engineers can stop older columns from splitting during a quake . Among the other methods used to make older bridges more resilient in a quake : Original Concrete Column Steel Rebar Polystyrene Wrap 3 / 8 &quot; Steel Casing Pressure Grouted to Existing Column Hinges : Allow slight shifting Buffers : Function as shock_absorbers Cable : Straps keep joints from coming_apart Footings : Bases enlarged and piling driven deeper ( Tie-Down Rods Drilled 65 Feet Into ground ) KEY FEATURE IN NEW BRIDGES When the I-10 is rebuilt , its new columns will feature spiral steel rods to hug the components together . Old Method : Before 1971 , steel support bars had no side-to-side support New Method : Columns are now made with steel rod wrapped around vertical steel supports</TEXT>
