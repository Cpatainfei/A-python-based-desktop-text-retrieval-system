   <HEADLINE> HIGH_COURT RULING FAVORS OUSTED CHEERLEADER ; LAW : BUT STATE JUSTICES WON ' T PUBLISH THEIR FINDING , MEANING IT WILL AFFECT ONLY IRVINE SCHOOLS . OTHER DISTRICTS MAY MAINTAIN DUAL ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS FOR ACTIVITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A ruling by the state Supreme Court Thursday involving a former Irvine cheerleader will allow most public_schools to continue setting higher grade standards for cheerleaders than athletes . The Irvine Unified School District , however , will probably have to change its rules . The case involved the Irvine district ' s dropping a cheerleader from the pep squad after she failed a class , a requirement that didn ' t apply to athletes . The appellate_court found in the teen-ager ' s favor , a ruling that would have prohibited public_schools statewide from setting a double_standard . The state Supreme Court on Thursday voted 4 to 3 to deny review of that case , meaning that the appellate_court ' s order stands_for Irvine . But the Supreme Court justices unanimously withdrew the appellate ruling as a precedent that would have been binding on_trial courts statewide . Following its usual practice , the court gave no explanation for its decision , an action that leaves the legal issue unsettled . The former cheerleader , Melissa Fontes , and her attorney said they were dismayed at the court ' s decision to keep the ruling off the books . &quot; It doesn ' t make_sense to me , &quot; said Fontes , now 21 and a college_student in Oregon . Fontes was barred as a cheerleader at Woodbridge High_School in Irvine several years ago after she failed chemistry and her grade average for the semester fell below 2.5. &quot; If they ' re saying , ' Yes , what happened in this Irvine district is wrong , ' why would n ' t they apply that to all districts ? It seems very arbitrary . Either it shouldn ' t happen anywhere or they should reverse the ( appellate_court ) decision. &quot; Fontes ' attorney , Bonnie Lawley of Hacienda Heights , said the court ' s action was a disservice to other young people throughout the state who may find themselves in Fontes ' position and be forced to sue to protect their rights . &quot; I think it ' s extremely unfortunate , because the only thing the publication of the decision does is to force school districts to comply with the equal protection clause of our Constitution , &quot; she said . An attorney for the Irvine district , Mark Bresee , said the high_court ' s decision to let the appellate_court ' s ruling stand was a disappointment . The action cannot , however , &quot; be construed as supporting &quot; the appellate_court , he said . &quot; In my opinion . . . the fact that they took it off the books either means they were neutral on it or they disagreed_with it , &quot; he said . Bresee said the decision was a &quot; clear victory &quot; for California school districts as_a_whole . The California School_Boards Assn . had submitted letters urging the court to depublish the decision because it was wrong , he said . The Irvine school_board has not determined what effect the court ' s action will have_on its policies , Bresee said . &quot; It ' s a question that hasn ' t been addressed yet by the district , because ( the case ) was still making its way through the courts. &quot; But one school_board member , Margie Wakeham , said Thursday night that the district apparently will have to adopt the same standards for cheerleaders as athletes . Wakeham said she thought the Supreme Court decided not to hear the case because justices thought it was &quot; ridiculous. &quot; &quot; I thought it was ridiculous , too . At least they depublished it. &quot; Currently , the district ' s policy is to require cheerleaders to maintain a 2.5 average each semester , on a scale of 4.0 , and to disqualify them for failing an class . Athletes are judged by minimum standards of the California Interscholastic Federation , requiring a grade average of 2.0 for their high_school career . They could fail one class in a semester and remain eligible . Many other school districts in the state have differential grade requirements , lawyers for the Irvine district said . After unsuccessfully appealing_to the school and the district board , Fontes sued . The district defended its policy , saying cheerleaders , unlike athletes , performed year-round and served as ambassadors of goodwill for the district , and therefore could be held to higher standards . Robert Gardner , a retired appeals court justice assigned to Orange County Superior_Court , ruled_in the district ' s favor . But he was overruled in May by the 4th District Court of Appeal , which found no rational justification for the policy . &quot; Interscholastic sports and cheerleading are both non-academic extracurricular_activities , &quot; said Presiding Justice David Sills in the 3-0 ruling . &quot; There is nothing about cheerleading that makes_it qualitatively any more or less scholarly than football , baseball or some_other sport. &quot; It ' s not a case of sex discrimination , Sills wrote -- boys and girls take_part in both activities -- but of arbitrary discrimination between athletes and cheerleaders . He said constitutional standards of equal protection require a single eligibility standard . &quot; Cheerleaders are not mere passive supporters of football and basketball_teams , but , like athletes in spectator sports , ( are ) entertainers in their own_right , &quot; Sills said . He said athletes represent their school no less than cheerleaders , and spend more out-of-class time on their activity , counting practice time . The school district can decide to lower one standard or raise the other , and might be able to justify higher eligibility requirements for extracurricular_activities with a greater academic connection , Sills said . In seeking state Supreme Court review , the district ' s lawyers said courts should leave such matters_to schools and their elected governing boards . &quot; The Court of Appeal manufactured a distinction between ' academic ' and ' non-academic ' extracurricular_activities &quot; and failed to define it , said district lawyer Pamela Depsey in court papers . She called the ruling an &quot; impermissible intrusion into functions reserved to local governmental agencies. &quot; The Associated Press contributed to this report .</TEXT>
