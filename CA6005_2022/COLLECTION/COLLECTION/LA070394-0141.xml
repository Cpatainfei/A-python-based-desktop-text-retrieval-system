   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / JONATHAN FREEDMAN : CIVIL RIGHTS -- THE GRAYING OF A ' 60S DREAM ; AFFIRMATIVE_ACTION HAS FOUNDERED ON RACIAL AND ECONOMIC DIVISIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thirty years after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , a young black_man is more likely to be arrested than hired . The thrust of affirmative_action , to help minorities get jobs , has given_way to repressive measures to put them in prison . And racism and tribalism , rising among minorities as well as whites , have supplanted the ideal of a colorblind society . Somewhere along the road to equality , the underlying faith in law to liberate people from oppression was lost in the rancorous conflict over racial quotas . Now America has embraced a new-found faith in punitive laws , like California ' s &quot; three strikes , &quot; that make_it easier for young minorities to spend life in prison rather than in the workplace . Affirmative_action did not cause this backlash , but the hopes it raised -- and dashed -- played a part . In the 1960s , idealistic Americans believed that whites should pay_for the oppression of the past by giving minorities a leg up . But by the 1980s , complaints over so-called reverse discrimination spawned a Bakke-to-bigotry counter-revolution against affirmative_action . In the economic decline of the 1990s , blue-collar whites feel_like an endangered species and sullenly resent concessions for minorities and women . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a good law that gave entitlements a bad name . Title II , barring segregation in public facilities , was enormously successful in smashing Jim Crow laws separating the races in the South . Title VII , setting hiring goals and timetables , helped integrate many government_agencies and private_corporations . But Title VI , barring discrimination in programs that receive federal funding , failed utterly to fulfill its promise . The most controversial civil-rights provision , affirmative_action , recruits minorities for jobs in traditional white bastions , such_as fire_stations . But resistance against it was skillfully manipulated to recruit disgruntled whites into a conservative coalition that undermined integration and shoved minorities deeper into poverty . As a result , the minority unemployment_rate is higher now than in 1964 , and has stubbornly remained twice as high as white unemployment for 30 years . Socially , affirmative_action provided a vehicle for advancement -- the black middle_class doubled in size -- but with the hidden stigma of entitlement . Economically , it favored those who received higher education and pursued professional careers over those who dropped_out of school and took menial jobs . Affirmative_action helped a minority of blacks and Latinos to move_up while leaving the rest further behind . Ironically for working stiffs , affirmative_action opened_up jobs in smokestack industries doomed to extinction by the post-industrial revolution . They entered the door only to find the factory was being shut_down and the job shipped overseas . Unskilled black and Latino workers were the hardest hit by the shift from a society that made real_things -- and paid living wages -- to one geared to virtual production . Many gave_up looking_for jobs and fell_into the anti-social behaviors characteristic of unemployed people , targeting them for harsh punishment by police , courts and prisons . Today ' s backlash against civil_rights eerily echoes the post-Civil War period . The 1860s , like the 1960s , were a time of progressive change when slavery was abolished and blacks were given equal protection under the law . But Southern whites increasingly disregarded the newly won rights of black Americans , and by the 1880s , de_jure discrimination had returned . In 1883 , the Supreme Court forbade Congress from outlawing racial discrimination practiced by individuals ; in 1896 , in Plessy vs . Ferguson , the court permitted &quot; separate but equal &quot; accommodations for blacks . A century later , white America is turning its back on integration , and even circumspect blacks are favoring separatism . Our sagging commitment to civil_rights is embodied by figures in prison denims . For every complaint of discrimination filed with the Commission on Civil Rights , a_hundred criminal charges are filed against minorities . Progress has been arrested literally in the persons of youths rounded_up because police suspect their color . Individuals may be guilty of unlawful acts , but a whole generation is being scapegoated for America ' s failure to live_up_to the 1960s ' hope of affirmative_action . A civil-rights law alone cannot free_people from discrimination if the spirit of the public is bitter and hate-filled -- or simply indifferent . As lawmakers inflated with demagoguery enshrine the ugly mood of fear and resentment into repressive laws , the only consolation is that the spirit of civil_rights will endure and flourish once again -- if today ' s backlash doesn ' t totally condemn the next generation .</TEXT>
