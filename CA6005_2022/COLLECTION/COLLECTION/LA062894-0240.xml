   <HEADLINE> BODY WATCH ; DON ' T GET MAD -- GET SMART ; WOMEN SHOULDN ' T SUFFER SILENTLY OR EXPLODE WHEN THEY ' RE ANGERED , NEW RESEARCH SHOWS . RATHER , THEY SHOULD DEAL WITH IT -- THEIR HEALTH MAY DEPEND ON IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Doctors have been warning men for years that exploding with anger over trivial events -- such_as some jerk cutting you off on the San Bernardino -- is not good for your health . This classic , Type_A behavior tends to land men in the cardiac-care ward . But what about women ? Is going ballistic bad for their health ? Or is it healthier to be a polite lady and keep your anger to yourself ? Neither , say the authors of intriguing new research on women and anger . Repressing anger is just as bad as becoming bleeping mad . Women , it seems , also have to learn to deal with anger constructively , says Sandra P . Thomas , editor of &quot; Women and Anger , &quot; ( Springer Publishing Co. , 1993 ) . &quot; Anger is a problem for women when it is too frequent , too intense , too prolonged , &quot; Thomas says . But , &quot; neither ' stuffing it ' nor ' shouting it ' is recommended. &quot; The key is determining whether your anger is poisonous or constructive . &quot; Despite its bad press , anger is not entirely unhealthy , &quot; Thomas says . &quot; Anger can be a signal that our rights or values are being compromised , that others are doing too_much or too_little for us , that something is wrong and should be corrected . Unless the anger is expressed , the offending party has no opportunity to make needed changes in behavior. &quot; Because of women ' s second-class status in society , they have plenty to be angry about , Thomas and her colleagues say . They found anger is a key risk factor_in obesity , smoking and substance_abuse . * Until recently , not much has been known about anger and women ' s health . Most of the research , such_as the Type_A studies , were done using male subjects . Those studies have shown that men with short fuses have a higher risk of heart_attack , and cardiologists repeatedly warn men to learn to handle stress without cranking_up their blood_pressure . But the messages for women have been less clear . &quot; ( Women ) are very bewildered about expressing anger , &quot; says Thomas , a nursing professor at the University of Tennessee , Knoxville . &quot; There is a message that holding anger in is bad for you . There is an equally vocal message that letting anger out is bad for you . And then there is the suggestion : Just don ' t get angry . To me , that ' s about as effective as Nancy Reagan saying ' Just say no ' to drugs. &quot; There is a societal taboo surrounding women and anger that deterred researchers , Thomas says . Women traditionally hide their anger because it ' s contrary to the ideal of the perfect mother and nurturer . &quot; Our images of angry women are not very attractive , &quot; she says , adding that these images are usually described as &quot; shrews , bitches and nags. &quot; Thomas ' study -- the first large-scale , comprehensive look_at women ' s anger -- showed that how anger is expressed has important implications for women ' s health . The all-female research group interviewed 535 women ages 25 to 66 about what makes them angry , how they act when they ' re angry and whether there were health consequences linked to their actions . The study confirmed what several other studies have shown about Type_A personalities in men : Hollering , screaming , slamming doors and throwing frying pans are not good for your health . But harboring anger can be just as dangerous . Thomas found that women who obsessed or ruminated about an incident were more likely to have depression , stress and other physical health_problems . In another study , female heart patients who suppressed anger were found to be more likely to suffer a second heart_attack . Researcher Lynda H . Powell of Rush-Presbyterian-St . Luke ' s Medical_Center in Chicago also found that employed , divorced women who lacked a college degree had a higher risk for a relapse . These women , many of whom were married in the 1940s and ' 50s , Powell suggested , might be more prone to heart_attacks because of the anger , loneliness and resentment arising from a life that had turned_out far differently than they had anticipated . &quot; For women with coronary disease , this combination of ( emotions ) may be lethal. &quot; * But women who confront the source of their anger are using the emotion in a healthy way , experts say . For example , one study showed that women who openly expressed anger about having cancer lived longer . And , Thomas says , angry women may get_better medical attention than women who are passive . &quot; Anger can serve as a useful warning_signal that stressors are exceeding our resources , &quot; she says . &quot; Anger is an entirely natural , legitimate response in many situations. &quot; While Thomas found that the healthiest response to anger is to discuss the incident with the person who provoked the anger , only 9 % of the women she surveyed said they did that . Instead , many said they coped by crying , taking a walk or exercising and thinking_about or analyzing the incident . Exercise also appears to be a healthy outlet . Thomas found that women who worked_out were less likely to have stress-related symptoms , such_as a headache or stomachache . One of the most heartening findings in the study , she notes , was that women rarely blew_up over little things . They said they were most likely to get angry over issues of power , justice and responsibility . &quot; Our women said almost nothing about trivial things , like someone getting_ahead of them in traffic -- things cited more by men , &quot; Thomas says . In another study , researchers found that women who were angry about their marriages spent more days ill than their happily married counterparts . The way people manage their anger is rarely considered by doctors as a factor_in illness , Thomas notes . But that should change as more research like the University of Tennessee study emerges .</TEXT>
