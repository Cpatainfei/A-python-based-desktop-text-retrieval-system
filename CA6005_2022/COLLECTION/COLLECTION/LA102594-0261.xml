   <TEXT> Every day the index of misery grows . In Russia , a diphtheria outbreak has reached epidemic proportions . In Rwanda , the drug-resistant cholera that blazed through refugee camps this summer remains a killer . In the United States , once-vanquished diseases such_as tuberculosis and measles have returned like avenging conquerors to ravage poor , urban_areas . And the latest entry from the &quot; killer germ &quot; front is a sobering reminder of ancient times : a plague outbreak in Western India that has killed dozens of people and caused hundreds of thousands to flee the area . &quot; We are in a new historical phase , &quot; says Laurie Garrett , author of the soon-to-be published , &quot; The Coming Plague : Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance &quot; ( Farrar , Straus &amp; Giroux ) . &quot; Our relationship with microbes is different than ever before , &quot; she says . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s Fantasy X , apocalyptic thinking. &quot; Garrett ' s book is an exhaustively researched , often-gripping tome -- covering everything from African viruses to toxic shock syndrome and AIDS . At 730 pages , the book is a collection of &quot; disease detective &quot; stories as well as an ambitious history of mutant viruses and bacteria over the course of this century . Newsweek magazine calls it a &quot; brilliant downer ( that ) is must reading. &quot; Adding_to the book ' s impact is its timeliness . Recent cover stories by Newsweek and Time magazines have sounded the alarm on the failure of antibiotics to defeat new generations of bacteria and the overall virulence of killer bugs . &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; -- a book about the 1989 outbreak of Ebola virus in Virginia -- is_on the bestseller list , and a movie about a deadly virus gone awry -- set to star Dustin Hoffman -- is also in the works . Likewise , last June ' s appearance of the so-called flesh-eating bacteria -- reports of which were endlessly replayed on TV news -- remains fresh on many people ' s minds . Garrett ' s interest in infection , however , is the product of a much longer gestation . A former science correspondent for National Public Radio and fellow at the Harvard Public_School of Health , Garrett wrote &quot; The Coming Plague &quot; in 17 months after several years of observing phenomena in sub-Saharan Africa , Central_America and the Middle_East , which challenged her assumptions that the defeat of disease by science was at_hand . &quot; As I traveled more and more in developing countries , I found diseases that I had grown_up with and thought were quite common were killers , and that diseases I had never heard of were killing tens of thousands of people and taking millions of lives every year , &quot; recalls Garrett , a health and science writer at New York Newsday . Still , the overall picture didn ' t come_into focus for her until a 1987 gathering of scientists and researchers in Washington , D.C. There , for the first time , Garrett says , she heard experts voice grave concerns about medicine ' s inability to cope_with the burgeoning number of virulent contagions that had suddenly manifested -- fears that , in_essence , validated her anecdotal experiences . That started her hunt , she says , &quot; and by the time I had 12 file boxes ( of research ) , I said , ' It ' s time for a book contract. ' &quot; In &quot; The Coming Plague , &quot; the litany of blame for the new onslaught of global infection is a long and complex one . Indeed , Garrett , who has an advanced degree in immunology , points_out that few of the often-lethal contagions facing the world -- such_as hantavirus and Legionnaires ' disease -- are new . Many have existed either in less virulent states or in local environments for years , perhaps centuries . But in the past 20 years or so , social and environmental factors have intruded to amplify the quality and quantity of their destructiveness . Ironically , in the case of bacteria-induced diseases , Garrett says , it has been the very antibiotics that successfully treated scourges such_as gonorrhea , tuberculosis and malaria that provided the mechanism for their hardier strains to evolve . Because modern medicine was unable to completely rid the world of such diseases , the surviving bacteria either mutated or transformed themselves into antibiotic-resistant strains , even as scientists blithely declared the battle over and moved_on . &quot; We called the game but the microbes didn ' t stop playing , &quot; Garrett says . Likewise , in the case of viruses , Garrett says , similar amplifications of old contagions , along with man-made factors , created the new and deadly specimens that have seemingly appeared from nowhere . For example , by testing old blood supplies , scientists have found the presence of the human_immunodeficiency_virus in samples dating to the 1970s , at which point the virus was spreading very slowly in Central_Africa and the United States . Yet it was in 1975 , say researchers , that &quot; something happened &quot; and HIV exploded in both areas of the world , an event that would not be detected until years later . Garrett and other researchers now theorize that factors such_as rising intravenous drug use and the increase in gay sex in North_America , and war , refugee migration and famine in Africa likely spurred the beginnings of the epidemic . &quot; You can ' t divorce our social problems from diseases of population , &quot; says Dr. Richard Wenzel , an infectious_disease specialist and epidemiologist at the University of Iowa . &quot; For an epidemic to get rolling , it has to have susceptible people. &quot; Given this , the immediate outlook is not a hopeful one , says Garrett , adding that estimates show that by the next century , there will be an increasing number of megacities -- those with populations of more_than 10 million -- in developing , economically disadvantaged countries . The new megacities , which will likely be filled with former rural dwellers living with below-standard levels of sanitation and nutrition , may become veritable caldrons of new plagues -- with the host nations unable to pay_for the costs of disease prevention or containment . Even today , faced with epidemics of malaria or AIDS , some impoverished countries can afford to spend only $ 2 to $ 3 yearly per person for medical_care . Garrett , who coincidentally was in India during the recent pneumonic_plague outbreak , says that despite the deaths and widespread panic , the scenario could have been much worse . &quot; If this had been an airborne virus , it would have spread globally , &quot; she says . &quot; The masses were_on the move. &quot; But residents of most industrialized nations , which provide the most research on disease and the best medical_care , have little cause for comfort . Not only is vaccine development &quot; in a state of crisis &quot; and &quot; every aspect of public health . . . in a state of chaos , &quot; Garrett says , but in light of the ever-increasing mobility of the world ' s population , new viruses and diseases can travel with unprecedented rapidity and impunity . One incident recounted in &quot; The Coming Plague &quot; tells of an undetected microbe that , thanks to the convenience of jet travel , spread through four continents and infected hundreds of people within a week ' s time in 1989 before officials were even aware of its existence . Fortunately , the virus -- known as the Ebola Reston and found in monkeys -- didn ' t prove harmful to humans , unlike its more destructive African Ebola counterparts . Still , the message the virus left in its wake is harrowing , and depending_upon people ' s response -- or lack of it -- a potentially lethal one . Garrett is mindful that as long as social , economic and environmental_conditions deteriorate worldwide , and as populations continue to grow , the microbes will have the upper_hand . &quot; The time it takes_for humans to evolve is_on the scale of centuries , &quot; she says . &quot; But the time it takes_for a bacteria or virus to evolve is_on the scale of minutes . that ' s their advantage. &quot;</TEXT>
