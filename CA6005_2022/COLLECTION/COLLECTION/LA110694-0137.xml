   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / JOEL D . ROBERTS : WHY IS THE NIGHT STALKER STILL ALIVE ? ; IT ' S LUNACY TO KEEP A MAN ALIVE SO YOU CAN GIVE HIM THE DEATH_PENALTY FOR THE 20TH TIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No one who lived through it will ever forget the summer of 1985 . Humid days , muggy nights and the air fetid more with terror than smog . This was the season of the Night Stalker and where Richard Ramirez roamed , he reigned . Now , nine years and 19 death sentences later , the Stalker is still likely more_than a decade from death . We , the people of California , keep him alive . We house and feed him , clothe and entertain him , minister to his medical needs and facilitate his contact with fans . The fact that he has fans is appalling beyond comment , yet , as we all know , demons fascinate , and for some that fascination leads to love . But those are the perversities of the fringe ; what concerns me here is the perversity of the system . In fact , perverse may be too weak a word for it . Because whether Ramirez is insane -- which has long been debated -- the travesty that ' s about to occur surely is . Already on San Quentin ' s Death Row , the Night Stalker now awaits trial in San Francisco on one final count of murder . The best possible outcome , from the state ' s point_of_view , would be a first-degree conviction with &quot; special circumstances , &quot; resulting in yet a 20th death sentence . This lunatic redundancy will not come cheaply . The Los Angeles trial cost nearly $ 2 million ( which was_after the millions spent on the manhunt ) and there ' s no reason to assume the new trial will cost less . Acutely aware of this utter folly , the presiding judge has registered her disgust . Moreover , the victim ' s family , whose need for closure might justify the trial , has publicly stated they want no part of it . But the San Francisco district_attorney needs to look tough on crime , so here we go_with another round . Well , extravagant as this charade may be , the expense is the least of the problem . The new trial is not only pointless , it ' s dangerous . By alleging special circumstances , prosecutors have to show multiple murders , which means the Southern California survivors will again have to testify . They ' ll be forced to resurrect old terrors and , as they struggle with dimming memories the likely discrepancies between current and prior testimony will be fuel on the eager fire of the Los Angeles appeal . In short , what looms here is no mere redundancy , but the very real risk of a reversal . And remember , even if a death sentence is pronounced in San Francisco , another automatic appeal will begin , with its inevitable cycle of further delays . As much as , if not more_than , any monster before him , the Night Stalker draws_out in stark relief the fallacies of the anti-death penalty polemic . Typically , abolitionists assert three major points : that capital_punishment is legalized murder ; that death sentences are disproportionately meted_out to minorities , and that an innocent person could be executed in error . In the case of Ramirez , not a single one of these arguments persuades . First of all , executing murderers is no more the equivalent of murder than incarcerating kidnapers is the equivalent of kidnap . Yes , in the first case , both people die , just as , in the second case , both lose their freedom . Yet can anyone really fail to see the distinctions ? Second , when it comes_to mass murderers ( most of whom are white ) no one has claimed that race is a factor . And finally , as an admitted serial_killer , whether Ramirez murdered is not in_dispute . The only real question remains &quot; how many ? &quot; Speaking of questions , I have a_few of my own , which I direct in particular to liberal judges and those criminal lawyers who seem to delight in perverse pyrotechnics : How many lives does a man have to take before we deem him undeserving_of life ? How much of our money does he have to consume before we resolve he ' ll consume no more ? How God-awful does a human_being have to be before the American Civil Liberties Union will pronounce him beyond the pale ? How many death sentences must a murderer receive before the first is carried_out ? The answers to these questions are far from imminent . They , like the Night Stalker , will linger at length . Meanwhile , the Satanist who gouged_out the eyes of one of his victims -- was she alive or dead at the time ? -- watches TV , piles_up pentagrams and attends_to his correspondence with fans . He ' s apparently happy , his health is robust , and we ' re told he needs no medication to sleep .</TEXT>
