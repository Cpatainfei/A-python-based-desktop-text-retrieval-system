   <HEADLINE> JIM MURRAY : HE GETS TO MAKE THE CALL OF FAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Listen ! Did you ever look over at a guy and think to yourself , &quot; Boy ! I wish I had his job &quot; ? Maybe he was an emcee at a beauty pageant . Maybe he ran golf tours to Hawaii . Maybe he was President . Secretary_of_State . Ballroom dancer . Donald Trump . Social director on the Love Boat . Not me . I always envied Jack Lang ' s job . It has been called &quot; the happiest job in America. &quot; Jack Lang calls people up_to tell them they ' re in the Hall_of_Fame . Now , that ' s the next best thing to being Santa Claus . Jack is the secretary-treasurer of the Baseball Writers Assn . of America , the organization that is the real umpire of the game , the conscience -- and the judge and the jury -- of the grand old game in this century . Of the 20 # 000 or more players who played in the big_leagues , only a handful have made the game ' s Valhalla -- a little over 200 , including umpires , managers , commissioners and executives . It ' s easier for the proverbial camel to go_through the eye of a needle than for an athlete to get_into this kingdom . The baseball writers are the toughest judges in the country . Their Hall_of_Fame is a more exclusive fraternity than the House of Lords . You indeed have to be baseball royalty to get_in . First of all , you need 75 % of the vote . If the Electoral College had that provision , we ' d never get a President . Would you believe Joe DiMaggio -- Joe DiMaggio ! -- didn ' t make_it his first year of eligibility ? He came_up 14 votes short of admission . Would you believe 11 voters didn ' t think Babe_Ruth belonged in the Hall_of_Fame ? Would you believe 43 didn ' t believe Mickey Mantle did ? Henry Aaron , no less , finished_up nine votes short of unanimous . At that , he got the highest percentage of anyone but Ty Cobb and Tom Seaver . Ballplayers are used to calls from the President of the United States , the governor of the state , Bob Hope , or other famous athletes at the high moments of their careers . But the call they wait for most of the rest of their lives is from Jack Lang . Jack Lang is a sunny , cheerful , optimistic man who never ceased to be a baseball fan . Sometimes , years in a press_box can dim the glamour for a man who is hired in part to keep a jaundiced eye on the flaws in the grand old pastime . For Jack Lang , it never did . His love of baseball always shone through the cynicism of press row . One result is , his BBWAA , of all journalistic trade associations , is the most respected -- and the most powerful . So , it falls to him to notify our athletic heroes that they have had their careers validated by inclusion in the most prestigious shrine of them all . They have joined history . Their careers had meaning . His call has become one of the most eagerly awaited events in the lives of many of them . Some have wept when the Lang call came_in . Others have muttered prayers of thanks . None have shrugged or growled . The most hard-bitten of cases have been softened by inclusion . They have won the Oscar . &quot; It has been my good_fortune since 1967 to call every winner of every award the BBWAA hands_out , &quot; Lang recalls . &quot; The Hall_of_Fame calls were highlights. &quot; The first Cooperstown call he made was to the great Yankee pitcher , Red Ruffing , who was in his last year of eligibility ( a player becomes eligible five years after his career is over and for 15 years thereafter ) . &quot; He was so nervous , he was out driving_around Cleveland in his car . He was afraid to know , &quot; Lang recalls . In 1968 , Lang put_through one of his most poignant calls . &quot; When I was a kid back in Brooklyn in 1935 , I remember hanging over a fence one day begging a player named Joe ( Ducky ) Medwick for an autograph . Now , Joe was a kind of surly sort in those days , but he grudgingly gave me the autograph . Thirty-three years later , I call him up_to tell him he made the Hall_of_Fame ! &quot; &quot; I never call losers , &quot; Lang admits . &quot; I only bring good news. &quot; He broke this rule only once , he says . The late Roy Campanella , in his first year of eligibility , had come_up a_few ballots short of inclusion . He had asked Lang to phone him in any event . &quot; I don ' t call losers , I hate to disappoint , &quot; Lang told him . &quot; Call me anyway , &quot; Campy instructed . &quot; I did , &quot; Lang recalls , &quot; the only loser I ever called . Campy said , ' that ' s OK , Jack . The good Lord will take_care of me next year. &quot; Adds Jack : &quot; He did. &quot; When Mickey Mantle was called_in 1974 , his first thought was , &quot; Did Slick make_it ? &quot; Slick was his nickname for his Yankee colleague Whitey Ford . &quot; Yep . You ' re an entry , &quot; Lang told him . Mantle and Ford set the Bloody Mary record the morning of the press_conference , Lang recalls . He almost didn ' t get Ralph Kiner in Ralph ' s final year for inclusion . &quot; His mother-in-law kept his phone tied_up for hours . He almost missed the call. &quot; Willie Mays , believe it or not , missed unanimous selection by 23 votes , Lang recalls . ( No one has ever gotten_in unanimously. ) But , when Willie arrived , he got_even . At the press_conference , he was asked who was the greatest player he ever saw . &quot; Me , &quot; Willie responded . Lang was occasionally robbed of the pleasure of personal notification . When he tried to reach Luis Aparicio in 1984 , the old White Sox shortstop was broadcasting a game in his native Venezuela . &quot; They put me through , not to Luis , but to the public-address announcer . He promptly got_on the P.A. to announce it not only to Luis but the entire ballpark. &quot; On Wednesday , Jack was hoping to make a call to San Francisco . Like a lot of us , he was hoping Orlando Cepeda would get_in . &quot; I ' ve voted for him for eight years , &quot; Lang admitted . &quot; But he missed by seven votes . Since there were 455 votes cast , it means 120 people didn ' t vote for him . But , Nellie Fox missed by only two votes_in his last year and Jim Bunning missed by eight in 1980. &quot; So , Cepeda became the second-closest call_in Hall history . The voters did give pitcher Steve Carlton 95.5 % of the votes ( 436 ) . &quot; Steve was in Durango , Colorado , waiting to get_on a flight to Denver and then New York if he made_it . Ten minutes before the flight , he phoned up . ' Shall I come ? ' he asks . ' Get here ! ' we tell him . ' You ' re in ! ' &quot; While the disappointment for Cepeda was great , Lang defends the Hall ' s standards . &quot; I ' ve never seen a ballot with more good players on it ( than this year ) , &quot; he admits . &quot; But you have to remember , the Hall is for great players , not good players. &quot; And when you ' re great , Lang will be the first to tell you .</TEXT>
