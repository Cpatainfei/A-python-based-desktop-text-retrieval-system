   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; CRACKDOWN BY COLOR IN FRANCE ; THE GOVERNMENT IS TARGETING DARK-SKINNED PEOPLE IN A HUNT FOR ISLAMIC TERRORISTS . BUT CRITICS ALSO LINK THE SWEEPS TO BIAS AGAINST AN IMMIGRANT GROUP THAT REFUSES TO GIVE_UP ITS CULTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Guy Andre Javitary , a 32-year-old construction worker , left his apartment at 2 p.m. one recent day to look_for jobs . By the time he returned early that evening , he had been stopped six times on the streets and strip-searched once by police . Why did authorities single_out this law-abiding French citizen for scrutiny ? There ' s only one reason : Javitary has dark skin . And these days in France , people with dark skin are suspected of being Islamic fundamentalists and , hence , possible terrorists . In a massive crackdown , the conservative government has for a month been sweeping the streets , stopping as_many as 3 # 000 motorists and pedestrians a day to interrogate them , demand their identity papers and , in some cases , search them . With no apologies , the police are focusing_on dark-skinned people . And the random checks , sharply criticized by human_rights groups , reflect a deeper French antipathy toward Muslims who insist on maintaining their cultural and theological traditions rather than assimilating French values and culture . &quot; When the police see me , they just see a dark-skinned man , not a Frenchman , &quot; said Javitary , who was born in Martinique and who has been &quot; controlled , &quot; as the police call it , dozens of times in recent weeks . To protect himself these days , Javitary carries his passport , birth_certificate , social_security card and citizenship papers . But those documents didn ' t stop one police patrol from strip-searching him and then breaking_apart the bead bracelets he was wearing . &quot; I am trying to learn to tolerate it , but I will never understand it , &quot; Javitary said . &quot; I don ' t know anything about politics or Islam . I ' m a Catholic. &quot; Interior Minister Charles Pasqua has strongly defended the hard line , citing la securite of France , a nation that has suffered many terrorist attacks . At his urging , the government last year adopted laws to legalize stop-and-search campaigns and random identity checks to verify the papers of anyone whom police suspect of being a foreign national . Now police carry a laminated card , listing all_the conditions under which they may &quot; control &quot; someone . The stricter measures were used sparingly until August , when five French citizens were killed in Algeria by the Armed Islamic Group , which has claimed responsibility for the deaths of 17 French and 42 other foreigners there in the last year . If a_few innocent people are harassed or arrested in France , Pasqua says , that is the price his country must pay to protect itself . &quot; If you want to catch fish , you have to go fishing , &quot; he has said . Public_opinion_polls suggest that most of France supports Pasqua . The 67-year-old conservative ' s anti-Islamic crusade , and the capture of the fugitive known as Carlos the Jackal , has Pasqua being mentioned as a possible 1995 presidential candidate . The main targets of his crackdown are what government officials call the &quot; Islamic menace , &quot; radical Islamic fundamentalists trying to undermine French support for Algeria ' s military government . French law still prohibits racial or religious discrimination . But in this case , the police are checking everyone they suspect of being a North African Muslim , and most of them have dark skin . So far , France has expelled more_than 20 Algerian-born Islamic fundamentalists to Burkina Faso , one of France ' s closest allies in West Africa . Others are being held for expulsion , which has long been legal in France without a hearing , if the government deems it &quot; an imperious necessity for state security and public safety. &quot; One of the great ironies of France is that , as a matter of public policy , it has granted citizenship to so many immigrants over the years and at_the_same_time insisted that the newcomers abandon their traditions and assimilate into French society . &quot; We in France refuse to recognize ' communities , ' &quot; Culture Minister Jacques Toubon said in a recent interview . &quot; Unlike in the United States , France integrates individuals , not minority groups. &quot; Nevertheless , those communities have taken_root , especially in the poorer , working-class suburbs of North Africans that ring Paris , Marseilles , Lyon and other large cities . An attempt was made in the mid-1980s to culturally integrate those communities , but it failed . And yet , the battle continues . In recent days , Education Minister Francois Bayrou ordered school_principals to prohibit pupils wearing Islamic scarves from attending classes . Bayrou says the wearing of such scarves is a religious statement , which is considered disruptive to orderly school life . The government has not said whether wearing a cross , as_many people in this mostly Catholic country do , would also be considered disruptive to school life . In French society , being different is not considered a redeeming quality . Denis Lacorne , a political analyst in Paris , says the conservative government , which took power in an overwhelming election victory 18 months ago , &quot; is trying to redefine the_French identity . They say Islam is a tradition and culture not compatible with French culture. &quot; About 3 million Muslims , 500 # 000 of them French citizens , live_in France , and most of them are immigrants or the sons and daughters of immigrants from former French colonies in North Africa . When they melded conveniently into French society , they were tolerated and even welcomed . But no longer . And new laws enacted last year make_it more difficult for the French-born children of immigrants to obtain French citizenship . These days , many Muslims are afraid to go_to mosques out of fear of police harassment . And shops in predominantly Muslim areas close early to avoid conflict with the authorities . The crackdown has driven some moderate French Muslims into the radical camp . And Islamic religious_leaders worry that the_French are beginning to view every Muslim as a potential terrorist . An official at a large Paris mosque has said he fears that it may already be too late to restore the &quot; fragile consensus &quot; that had begun to form between North African immigrants and French society . That was clear enough for Ahmed Zitouni , an Algerian-born grocer arrested as a suspected Islamic terrorist a_few weeks ago in northern France . Zitouni is hardly_a radical Muslim . Married to a Frenchwoman for 25 years and a resident for three decades , he has three children and a thriving shop . Not only that , but he chain-smokes , drinks beer and happily cuts pork for his customers . Authorities eventually released Zitouni but rearrested him later -- on an old drunk driving charge . He was convicted of the charge and sentenced to six months in prison . But authorities also plan to expel him as a suspected terrorist . His lawyer believes that Zitouni ' s drinking problem is his best defense against expulsion . &quot; It ' s totally unjust , &quot; complains Zitouni ' s wife , Martine . &quot; Everyone around here knows very well that he is not political . But the police just don ' t want to admit they made a mistake . Now they ' re trying to shut him up. &quot; For its part , the government contends that the Islamic threat warrants extraordinary measures . Pasqua has vowed to expel militants &quot; by the planeload , if necessary , &quot; to prevent terrorist attacks on French soil . &quot; Do I have to wait until bombs blow_up in our country and kill French_people ? &quot; Pasqua asked recently . &quot; Or should I intervene ahead of time in_order to dismantle the networks ? &quot; The answer seems obvious enough to most here . In recent polls , 57 % agree that repeated identity checks are &quot; efficient and dissuasive. &quot; Pasqua quickly sent the police to search for Islamic militants who he said were using French soil to plot further attacks . France also closed its three consulates in Algeria , making_it nearly impossible for Algerians to emigrate to France . A centralized visa service was set_up in western France , and the government declared that only &quot; recommended &quot; Algerians would be allowed to enter . More_than two_dozen men , including Zitouni , were detained for two weeks 60 miles northeast of Paris . Most were sympathizers , if not members , of the Islamic Salvation Front , or FIS , which opposes the Algerian military government but is considered less radical than the Armed Islamic Group . None of those detained were directly linked to any terrorist activity in Algeria , however , and the government decided against returning them to Algeria , where they would have faced certain prison_terms . All but four were eventually expelled to Burkina Faso , where the_French government reportedly is paying_for their hotel_rooms . Then , a_few weeks ago , eight North Africans were arrested in four French cities and charged with ties to the terrorist organization responsible_for killing two Spanish tourists in Morocco on Aug . 24 . The government has braced for terrorist reprisals on French soil , but so far nothing has happened . Yet many in France well remember that the war of independence in Algeria , a former French colony , was fought for eight years in the streets of French cities as well as in North Africa before it ended in 1962 . The politics in Algeria are even more complex these days . About 6 # 000 people have been killed in violence there since January , 1992 , when the military government scrapped elections as the Islamic Salvation Front was emerging as the winner . The FIS and several other banned Islamic groups recently entered into talks with the military government after two leading radical figures were released from jail . ( They remain under house arrest. ) But the Armed Islamic Group has refused to take_part . The attacks on French_people in Algeria reopened a cultural rift in France between immigrants who cling_to Islamic traditions and the_French , who fear that their culture is being undermined by everyone from Muslim holy_men to Hollywood pitchmen . With an unemployment_rate of 12.6 % in France , many see foreigners as a threat to their livelihood as well as their safety . And Islam , especially its fundamentalists , with their philosophy of obedience to theology over loyalty to secular laws , is a ready-made target for French politicians seeking favor with the unhappy populace . Caught in the middle are dark-skinned French men and women , from North Africa , West Africa and the Caribbean . The police have only arrested a_few dozen militants but have detained hundreds more immigrants for other irregularities . The police checks , on the street and in the subways , have become a fact of life for people such_as Javitary , a former sailor in the_French marines and a son , grandson and great-grandson of French citizens . He has lived_in France for 14 years . The French desire to protect their culture strikes Javitary as odd . In Martinique , now officially a French &quot; department , &quot; Javitary said , &quot; we have already lost all our culture , everything is lost , because we live today like the_French . Going_to Martinique is like going_to France . The same shops . The same products . The same fruits and vegetables . &quot; We used to have much in common with Africans , &quot; he added . &quot; But the_French have taken_away our own culture . Yes , Martinique now is a little France. &quot; Rather than preventing trouble in France , he said , the police clampdown is creating a deep animosity among dark-skinned French . &quot; I think there is going_to be an explosion , &quot; he said , &quot; and it ' s going_to be like dynamite. &quot;</TEXT>
