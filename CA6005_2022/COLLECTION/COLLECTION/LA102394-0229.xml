   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : HOME COMPUTERS ARE IN SAME SPOT AS MODEL T IN 1919</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The home computer , centerpiece of an emerging industry with enormous possibilities , is right now where the automobile was in 1919 -- on the verge of a takeoff that will make_it a familiar product in 80 % of American homes within five years and a necessity of life within a decade . That takeoff will accelerate this Christmas shopping season as an estimated 7 million consumers plunk_down $ 2 # 000 apiece to take_home a computer for work and play . It ' s no fad . By one count , sales of home computers will surpass sales of office computers this year . Already the home market is driving major business events , such_as the negotiations between one-time rivals IBM and Apple Computer toward an agreement in which IBM would invest in Apple in return for rights to use the Macintosh software operating system . Also , Microsoft agreed last week to pay $ 1.5 billion for Intuit Co. , developer of the personal finance program Quicken , with an eye to the growing millions who keep track of investments on home computers . The new mass market is coming fast . According to Dataquest , a San Jose research firm , 6.9 million computers will be sold for home use this year , compared to 10 million for &quot; professional &quot; use . Other research firms -- Computer Intelligence Infocorp and Link Resources -- count separately computers used for work_at home and conclude that &quot; home &quot; and office computers are now neck and neck . And the growth , 30 % a year , is in the home ; from 32 million U.S. homes with computers today to more_than 80 million in 1998 . * The business is going_to be enormous and the biggest companies are struggling to get_it right . IBM brought_out a new_line of home computers this year , called Aptiva , but underestimated demand for them and so won ' t have enough in the stores this Christmas season . Longer term , though , IBM could recover some of its lost glory in the home market . Negotiations with Apple are discussing just how much IBM will pay_for rights to Macintosh -- reports say $ 1 billion . &quot; A linkup would have advantages for both companies , &quot; says computer consultant Bob Djurdjevic , head of Annex Research in Phoenix . Gaining the easy-to-use Macintosh operating system would help IBM in consumer markets , while IBM ' s backing would lend market power to Apple , which after all_the years still has only 10 % of the personal_computer market . Apple ' s position in the home is ironic . From its start in 1977 , Apple produced the most consumer-friendly computers . But for over a decade its energies have been spent fighting IBM , Compaq , Dell and AST Research -- all_of which have had their own problems -- in business markets . Now Apple has another chance . &quot; The home market should be Apple ' s , &quot; says Ian Gilson , computer analyst at Van Kasper &amp; Co. , a Los Angeles investment_firm . &quot; If it misses it , then worries about the company ' s future could be_well founded. &quot; Meanwhile , home computing ' s greatest success thus far is Packard Bell , a smallish Westlake Village company -- $ 2.3 billion in revenue this year -- that took_on an old television brand name when it started business in 1986 . From the beginning , Packard Bell operated_on two key insights : It sold computers through Wal-Mart , Sam ' s , Price / Costco , Sears and other mass retailers . And it produced the most powerful computers possible , because founder Beny Alagem understood that home users needed more computer power than office tasks demand . Home customers use computers for games , personal finance , education for the kids and lately to communicate through the Internet or services such_as Prodigy , America Online and Compuserve . They want processing speed , powerful modems and the ability to create three dimensional effects in games and educational_programs . Thus , home customers have provided the big market for Intel ' s powerful Pentium microprocessor . And their demands will push development of more powerful processors , Intel ' s P6 due in 1996 and PowerPC ' s 620 version on which Motorola and IBM plan production next year . &quot; As capability increases , so must the sophistication of our programs , &quot; says Robert Davidson , president of Davidson &amp; Associates , producer of &quot; Math Blaster , &quot; &quot; Kid Phonics &quot; and other educational software . The Davidson company , founded by former schoolteacher Janice Davidson , also reflects a deeper trend : With entry to the home , computer_technology loses its ivory_tower image and instead becomes increasingly democratic . Educational programs are created not by scientists but by former schoolteachers like Davidson and Ann McCormick , founder of The Learning Co. , who now is starting_up another company_named Media 3 . People do their own thinking and talking on the Internet ; they don ' t sit listening to government or experts tell them what to think . And further possibilities of the home computer are only dimly perceived as yet . To begin with , comparisons to television are imprecise ; the computer is more_than an entertainment appliance . Rather , like the refrigerator , it will be left on all_the time and will control lighting , heating and air conditioning in the home . Electric utilities as well as telephone_companies will have a greater connection to the home computer than is recognized today . * Steven P . Jobs , the founder of Apple Computer , saw the implications years ago . &quot; As the bicycle extends muscle power , allowing human_beings to go_farther and faster , &quot; Jobs used to say in Apple ' s early days , &quot; so the computer extends the mind , allowing us to learn more , know more. &quot; It took Henry_Ford , who built the Model T in 1908 , a decade to sell 1 million of them . But after that , ten million were sold within five years and then more and more as Americans seized_on the automobile , as Ford himself put it , &quot; to get_out of the shells in which they had been living. &quot; There may_not yet be a computer equivalent of the Model T , but one is just around the corner . And so is the enormous industry and social revolution that goes_with it .</TEXT>
