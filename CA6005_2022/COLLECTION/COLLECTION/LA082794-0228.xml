   <HEADLINE> RELIGION / JOHN DART ; RABBI CONSIDERS WHY A GOOD GOD WOULD TOLERATE EVIL ; JUDAISM : BOOK WRITTEN BY HAROLD SCHULWEIS OF VALLEY BETH SHALOM POSITS A DIETY WITH A SPLIT_PERSONALITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A dutiful synagogue member afflicted with cancer once wrote her rabbi in Encino that she dreaded Yom Kippur because a major prayer recited throughout that solemn Jewish holiday asks , &quot; Who shall live and who shall die . . . who shall be at_ease and who shall be afflicted ? &quot; The prayer concludes that &quot; repentance , prayer and righteousness &quot; can avert a severe divine judgment . But the anguished woman protested to the rabbi that she couldn ' t believe God had given her cancer for &quot; some terrible unknown transgression. &quot; For his congregant , and for tens of thousands of religiously skeptical Jews , Rabbi Harold M . Schulweis of Encino ' s Valley Beth Shalom is publishing a book in which he offers a new solution to an ancient philosophical problem : Why would a good God tolerate evil happenings ? Schulweis posits a God with a split_personality , a divinity with two different sides -- the God of nature who shrugs and says , &quot; It happens , &quot; and the God of human relations who says , &quot; Do the right thing &quot; and &quot; God helps those who help themselves. &quot; And , rejecting centuries of Judeo-Christian belief in an all-powerful God , Schulweis contends that even if worshipers are dealing with the God of human relations , there are problems beyond his power to ameliorate ; nature must be allowed to take its course . Although praised by some Jewish thinkers for his practical theology , the nationally known rabbi who has headed the San Fernando Valley ' s largest synagogue for 24 years may shock believers by portraying God as weak and ineffective by traditional expectations . But people like his cancer-afflicted congregant may welcome Schulweis ' claim that there is no capricious figure in the heavens bringing occasional misfortune to &quot; test &quot; the faith of moral individuals . In Schulweis ' view , one aspect of the divinity is Elohim , the source of blindly implacable nature whose sunshine and rain , earthquakes and cancer happen whether you ' ve been bad or good . The other is Adonai , a transforming force that summons a human response to suffering and opportunities . &quot; Elohim is the source of the powers of nature ; Adonai is the ground of moral goodness , &quot; Schulweis writes in &quot; For Those Who can ' t Believe , Overcoming the Obstacles to Faith &quot; ( HarperCollins ) . Of the many Hebrew names of God in the Bible , the one that appears most frequently is Yahweh , which became replaced in Jewish worship by Adonai ( &quot; my Lord &quot; ) because of the sanctity of the divine name . Elohim ( &quot; God &quot; ) is the name used in the opening chapter of Genesis before the creation of man . Once Adam is created , the name Adonai is introduced in the Bible . But as Schulweis notes in his book , only when Adam receives the breath of life and interacts with nature , tilling the rain-soaked soil in the Garden_of_Eden , are the names Elohim and Adonai joined , usually translated into English as &quot; the Lord God &quot; ( Genesis 2:4-7 ) . The two names are commonly found side-by-side in Jewish prayer_books -- &quot; Blessed art Thou O Lord our God. &quot; Schulweis said he believes that sickness is neither a divine punishment nor an exercise by God to somehow test the undeserving believer . Thus , when the woman with cancer recites on Yom Kippur the line that &quot; repentance , prayer and righteousness overcome the evil decree , &quot; the rabbi wrote , &quot; she prays for the transformative powers of Adonai that help her mold the givenness of nature into ideal ends. &quot; That could mean that she would teach her children by example how to cope_with life ' s challenges , he said , citing a Rabbinic legend that concludes : &quot; The righteous are informed of the day of their death so that they may hand the crown to their children. &quot; Schulweis ' book , to be published Sept . 14 , the eve of Yom Kippur this year , was called the &quot; best book of its kind &quot; by Harold S . Kushner , author of &quot; When Bad Things Happen to Good People &quot; and , like Schulweis , a rabbi in the centrist Conservative branch of Judaism , and as &quot; a masterwork &quot; by Rabbi Alexander M . Schindler , president of the more liberal Reform_Judaism ' s Union of American Hebrew Congregations . Rabbi Elliot Dorff , professor of philosophy at the University of Judaism , said in an interview that some intellectual problems may exist in the relationship between Schulweis ' two aspects of divinity . &quot; But the theology is really good in pragmatic applications , &quot; Dorff said . &quot; The nice thing about Schulweis ' approach is that he is not pretending life is a bowl of cherries and yet he is not acquiescing to the terrible things that happen to people , &quot; Dorff said . Some rabbinical traditions have distinguished between Elohim as reflecting God ' s attribute of justice and Adonai as reflecting the divine quality of mercy . While Schulweis notes that tradition to show that a dual-faceted God is not foreign to Judaism , he disagrees . &quot; I want to introduce Elohim as the god of all that is , one that is morally neutral , &quot; he said . &quot; I am doing theology here , presenting an alternate way of looking_at divinity , but this is very much a Jewish practice through the centuries. &quot; The workings of Elohim could be seen in the natural forces that caused the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake , although the temblor was not a purposeful &quot; act_of_God , &quot; Schulweis wrote . On the other hand , &quot; Adonai was evident in the earthquake through the response of firemen , policemen , doctors and neighbors who helped restore lives , calm the frightened and rebuild the shattered lives of those around them , &quot; he said . &quot; In their individual and collective behavior the community testifies to the reality of Adonai without denying the reality of Elohim . &quot; On the wrenching topic of the World_War II-era Holocaust , an unprecedented massacre that has sorely tested Jewish faith to this day , Schulweis wrote that Elohim was reflected in the Auschwitz death camp simply because nature includes the aberrant economic , political and military factors that coincided to create the Nazi state . But Schulweis also pointed to &quot; the power and mystique of Adonai &quot; at_work in the Holocaust , based on his experience as founding chairman of the Jewish Foundation for Christian Rescuers , an international body that identifies and offers grants to non-Jews who helped victims of Nazism . &quot; In addition to the record of Jewish self-sacrificing heroism on behalf of endangered fellow Jews , there were tens of thousands of non-Jews , Christians , believers and nonbelievers , young and old , who came from every walk_of_life to risk their lives and those of their children to save Jews pursued and persecuted by the Nazis and their collaborators , &quot; he wrote . &quot; The evil that men and women do must never be allowed to eclipse the goodness that men and women do , &quot; he said . Schulweis said that in a predominantly secular society such_as the United States many people are blind to signs of godliness ( in Hebrew , &quot; elohut &quot; ) , a term that the rabbi thought might best describe the often unnoticed , sometimes surprising functions of Adonai . The current rapprochement of Israel and Jordan is an example , he said . &quot; We see this as something secular , but that ' s because we ' ve replaced the idea of godliness at_work in the world. &quot; The deity posited by Schulweis is neither all-powerful nor all-knowing . And the Bible stories indicate that he changes , he said . &quot; The mutability of God is profoundly Jewish and I would hope Christian too , &quot; Schulweis said in an interview . &quot; It ' s certainly a more interesting God. &quot; Schulweis , 69 , said that his working title for the book was &quot; When You ' re Older You ' ll Understand , &quot; because he said the big questions about religion asked by young people are too often postponed and usually never answered adequately . The rabbi said that so many people tend to think_of prayer falsely as a magical means for change . To do so leads to disillusionment , he said . Prayer &quot; must respect the world that God has created , &quot; he wrote . &quot; We may_not pray magically for a result that defies the laws_of_nature or that contradicts the laws of logic. &quot; Schulweis sees prayer functioning best within the Jewish understanding of a covenant with God that places responsibility on individuals as &quot; an active partner with the Divine Other , &quot; not a passive recipient of commandments or favors . Drawing from both mystical and rationalistic Judaic sources , as well as from centuries of rabbinical commentaries , Schulweis said a strong tradition exists against taking biblical accounts of miracles literally . To insist the miracles actually happened and explore the story no further loses the symbolic meaning of the stories , he said . When that happens , the human craving for miracles weakens the human obligation to do_good , he said . &quot; The Bible is holy not because it is the final word but because it is the first word of an unending tradition , &quot; he writes . Repeating a classic rabbinical story , Schulweis said that Rabbi Akiba some 1 # 900 years ago was challenged by a pagan with the question , &quot; Whose deeds are greater , those of God or man ? &quot; Akiba replied , &quot; Greater are the deeds of man. &quot; To the pagan surprised by the answer , Rabbi Akiba brought_forth sheaves of wheat and loaves_of_bread and asked , &quot; Which are superior ? &quot; the raw ingredient or the usable finished product . Schulweis said that there is a &quot; cooperative relationship between God and man &quot; that skeptics and nominal believers tend to overlook . Similarly , he said , a Jewish prayer known as a kiddush benediction is not made_over grapes but over the wine that is produced by human intelligence . &quot; Wine , not grapes , represents the fullest expression of the holy , the transaction between the godly human and non-human nature. &quot;</TEXT>
