   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; A SITCOM ' S BEST-KEPT SECRET ; WILL SERIES NO . 13 BE LIZ TORRES ' LUCKY NUMBER ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even Liz Torres , a co-star on &quot; The John Larroquette Show , &quot; looks surprised when she ' s reminded that the NBC sitcom is her 13th series . &quot; Oh , my God , &quot; she says laughing . &quot; Has it really been that many ? &quot; Torres certainly hopes &quot; The John Larroquette Show &quot; will be a lucky No . 13 . She bursts into her distinctive , deep , throaty laugh . &quot; Jesus_Christ , &quot; swears the woman who was raised Catholic . &quot; And I ' m almost a semi-name ! Almost ! &quot; The actress was nominated for an Emmy this year in the category of best suporting actress in a comedy series , but lost to repeat winner Laurie Metcalf ( &quot; Roseanne &quot; ) . Before the Emmy nod , she was a series regular on &quot; All in The Family , &quot; &quot; Phyllis , &quot; &quot; Mama ' s Family , &quot; &quot; The Famous Teddy Z , &quot; &quot; The New Odd Couple &quot; and &quot; The Ben Vereen Show. &quot; On &quot; Larroquette &quot; -- which has another tough slot against ABC ' s &quot; Grace Under Fire &quot; following last year ' s no-win placement against &quot; Roseanne &quot; -- Torres plays the feisty , streetwise , sarcastic Mahalia Sanchez . Mahalia assists Larroquette ' s alcoholic-turned-bus-manager John Hemingway at the Crossroads Bus_Terminal , an urban stop in St . Louis where most of the regulars are at a crossroads in their own lives . Although Torres ' resume includes numerous television guest spots , work in film , theater and nightclubs as well as a stint as a recording artist , she still says , &quot; I never thought I had a career . I think Meryl Streep has a career . I have jobs that I am lucky to get. &quot; &quot; I have an impressive bio , &quot; she acknowledges . &quot; But it ' s not money in the bank . I ' ve never had a hit record , never been in a film that ' s been nominated for an Oscar , and I ' ve never gotten an Emmy . I ' ve never had financial success . I ' m just somebody who works. &quot; Then the good-humored Torres says , with a conspiratorial wink , &quot; I ' m like an industry secret. &quot; &quot; I ' m one of those actresses who never turns_down a part , no matter how small , &quot; she says . &quot; I don ' t have the luxury of picking and choosing . I take everything. &quot; Those who recognize Torres from her roles &quot; as the maid to nearly everyone in Hollywood , &quot; as she puts it , may be surprised to find that the Latina actress doesn ' t have a trace of an accent . Even more surprising is that the New York native says she couldn ' t really speak English until she was in her teens . &quot; Everyone around me spoke Spanish , &quot; says Torres , who is half-Puerto Rican and a quarter each Moroccan and Venezuelan . &quot; We had a rule_in the house -- only Spanish. &quot; Which is why , she points_out , it ' s strange to play Latina women who speak so_much -- albeit heavily accented -- English . &quot; There are a lot of things they would be saying in Spanish. &quot; Even Mahalia would habla mas espanol . Torres was certain she would n ' t get the role of Mahalia . &quot; The producers were seeing thousands of actors for that part . Every Hispanic actress , it seemed , was up for it . They did casting calls_in New York , Miami and L.A. They even flew someone in from Spain . I didn ' t think I had a hope in hell . I lusted for it in my heart , though. &quot; When Torres first read the script , she says Mahalia &quot; jumped_out of the page at me . She ' s intriguing . I ' ve never played anyone like her before . She stands_up for herself and no-nonsense . She ' s really becoming a hero to me in some ways. &quot; Torres loves Mahalia and has been pleasantly surprised by the way the character handles situations . She cites the show where Mahalia demands a raise equivalent_to Hemingway ' s . &quot; It was so unlike me , &quot; she says . &quot; Whatever that aggressive gene is , I don ' t have it . I ' m kind of floored by her , how certain she is. &quot; The actress draws Mahalia from the many Latina women she encountered growing_up . &quot; I laugh_at myself -- where I find things for Mahalia . Women like Mahalia do exist , &quot; she points_out and adds , laughing , &quot; Yes , there is stereotyping and I am she ! &quot; Switching to a more serious tone , she adds , &quot; There ' s always that possibility of stereotyping . But I ' m never afraid of work . I ' m only afraid of not working . &quot; I ' ve grown gracefully into this role , &quot; she says of her move from bombshell to character actress . &quot; I look_at this , &quot; she says , pointing at a photo from her nightclub days , &quot; and I see Marie Dressler . I don ' t see myself as pretty or sexy . And when people say that about me , it ' s always so shocking . I ' m so_much happier now. &quot; Torres believes that Latins are slowly making their mark on television . &quot; I see all these Hispanic faces on TV and I remember when I was the only one . That makes me feel real hopeful. &quot; She ' s also got high hopes for &quot; The John Larroquette Show. &quot; &quot; The cast ' s a very interesting group of people . I thought that midway , when the honeymoon was over , the actors would show their colors . But there aren ' t any flaws , aren ' t any flies . We have such a ball . I can ' t believe how I wake_up and the first thing I do is thank God . I ' m not religious , but I thank him anyway for giving me a job that I love. &quot; The show , which now precedes the very strong &quot; Frasier , &quot; may get an audience boost from its impressive four Emmy nominations . Could this 13th series be the charm for Torres ? She ' s sure got her fingers crossed . &quot; The John Larroquette Show &quot; airs Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m. on NBC .</TEXT>
