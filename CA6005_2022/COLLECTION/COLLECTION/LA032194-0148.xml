   <HEADLINE> CALENDAR GOES TO THE OSCARS ; A LIFETIME OF ACHIEVEMENTS BUT ONLY A TINY PENSION ; MOVIES : FILM EDITOR GENE RUGGIERO ' S MONTHLY CHECK IS $ 242.71. BUT HE CLAIMS HE DESERVES ABOUT $ 1 # 250 A MONTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All the happy talk that surrounds Oscar season is met with some bitterness at Gene Ruggiero ' s temporary home . On the mantle is his tarnished statuette earned in 1956 for co-editing &quot; Around the World in 80 Days &quot; -- now a mottled color more copper than gold . In his glory era that also included an Oscar nomination for &quot; Oklahoma ! , &quot; he sent it out_to be cleaned , and it came_back instead stripped of its thin electroplated veneer . In the years he could afford to have it replated , he didn ' t . And today , at 83 and nearly destitute , it ' ll never happen . But sell it at auction to raise needed cash ? Never . &quot; My best work . My favorite film -- still , &quot; he said , nestling it in the crook of his arm as he moves_over to the couch to sit for a photograph . In the Motion_Picture Guide , Ruggiero recounts how he and &quot; 80 Days &quot; co-editor Paul Weatherwax were handed countless reels of film by producer Mike Todd : &quot; I told ( Todd ) to go_away for two weeks and leave us alone . And then we cut the monster down to something that made sense. &quot; * All these decades later , missing nearly all his front_teeth and suffering from shingles , Ruggiero is in a strange place . He has just collected another trophy , the American Cinema Editors ' Career Achievement Award , which was given_out a week ago Saturday by Martin Scorsese -- yet his monthly check from the Motion_Picture Industry Pension_Plan is a mere $ 242.71. After his lifetime of working in the film business , he believes he is owed a higher amount . &quot; This is no ordinary business . . . it ' s a crazy business , &quot; he said , lucid but flummoxed when asked to fully explain his situation . After all , he has worked and survived nearly everyone he ' s known since he moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s at the express wishes of Loews Inc. President Nicholas Schenck , worked_at MGM for 31 years , owned and sold production companies , owned screenplay properties and story rights , worked well into his 70s -- and still is broke . Several failed marriages ( he ' d rather not discuss the exact number ) may have had something to do with it . ( One ex-wife , Eva , has kindly taken him back in. ) Some would say it is an oft-told tale , the flip side to the glittery life in and around the star factories . Usually , it ' s the higher-profile actors and actresses whose checkered careers are written_about -- rarely the fate of below-the-line technicians . Ruggiero , however , believes his story is more_than just a recap of fanciful tales about the rich , famous and infamous . Given a rare moment ' s pause in the conversation , he will go_on about his regular morning round_of_golf at Hillcrest Country_Club with Louis B . Mayer ( Ruggiero , a scratch golfer , toyed once with turning pro ) , or how he bested Douglas Fairbanks Sr . in a tournament , or how Mario Lanza would n ' t make a picture unless he , Ruggiero , cut it . He ' ll even tell ( off the record ) a_few salacious tidbits about Bugsy Siegal ' s mistress , Virginia Hill , and the real facts of Siegal ' s gory ambush in his Beverly Hills living room -- and it ' s not the Warren Beatty version seen in &quot; Bugsy. &quot; John Ford was a &quot; cheapskate &quot; in the salary department , he says , as well as a creative gift-giver . Ford ' s idea of mollifying Ruggiero on &quot; The Wings of Eagles &quot; came_in the offer of a new putter . What ' s really on Ruggiero ' s mind , though , is getting the MPIPP to pay him some heed . And helping him are two screenwriter-producers , Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman , who met Ruggiero three years ago when he helped them negotiate rights on a spec script . &quot; You always read about old Hollywood , and he was old Hollywood , &quot; said Solomon . &quot; He helped us out , and we thought helping him out was the right thing to do. &quot; Ruggiero believes he banked enough hours as an editor to earn a pension equal_to that which 30-year editors get , about $ 1 # 250 a month . He says that he could prove it but that the documents that could do so have long since been lost or thrown_out . He claims moving to Rome in the ' 60s to work for offshore production companies interrupted payments into the fund . Upon his return to Hollywood , he worked_on such pictures as &quot; Cast a Giant Shadow &quot; and &quot; Moonshine Country Express &quot; while running his own company , Post Production Inc. , where he believes his employees were awarded hours he was not . What he needs is for his former employers -- the Hollywood studios and production companies -- to provide documentation for the number of hours he worked for them . Problems arise when those same employers , some of them independent , are either out of business or never were signatory to the editors guild , Local 776 . MPIPP Administrative Director Harley B . Blakenship said the inch-thick file on Ruggiero shows that the editor has initiated two prior inquiries &quot; represented by legal counsel . . . neither of which would show a basis for additional pension entitlement. &quot; Ruggiero , he says , could try again . Meanwhile , Ruggiero is sitting on a number of story rights he ' s entertaining offers to sell . One is about the Big Bopper , the ' 50s novelty hit-maker J . P . Richardson , whom the late John Candy had expressed interest in portraying not so_long ago .</TEXT>
