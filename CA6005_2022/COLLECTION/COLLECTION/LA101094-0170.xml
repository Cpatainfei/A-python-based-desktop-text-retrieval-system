   <HEADLINE> WASHINGTON OUTLOOK : ' 94 CANDIDATES AGREE ON 1 GOAL : CURBING JUVENILE CRIME ; BUT ANY CRACKDOWN COULD BE JUST A WARM-UP TO AN EVEN TOUGHER CLASH WHEN WELFARE REFORM IS TACKLED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Call it tough love , common standards or fear and loathing , but one of the most powerful trends in campaign 1994 is the rising demand for a crackdown on juvenile criminals . With juvenile violence rising more rapidly than adult violence , promises of boot camps , longer sentences , adult trials and curfews for teen-agers are ringing through campaigns around the country , especially gubernatorial races . This is an agenda with an angry edge -- filled with denunciations of punks and thugs and hoodlums . But even so , it may be only the warm-up for a more polarizing conflict next year , when the likelihood is that anxiety over youth crime will become intertwined with the racially charged effort to reform the welfare system . The first stage of this process -- stiffening sanctions against violent juveniles -- amounts to a tidal_wave . At least 20 states this year moved to prosecute more violent juveniles as adults , thereby allowing courts to impose longer sentences . In Texas , George W . Bush , the Republican gubernatorial nominee , calls juvenile violence the most important problem in the state ; he wants to lower to 14 the age at which juveniles can be tried as adults . California Gov . Pete Wilson has already signed such a bill into law . In Colorado , Democratic Gov . Roy Romer led a special_session last fall that created a new system of longer sentences and secure incarceration for juveniles . Overall , this may represent nothing less than a rejection of the juvenile justice system erected at the turn_of_the_century to protect and reform wayward young people charged with delinquency or petty theft . In the era of killers not yet old enough to shave , the stern new guiding principle appears to be that , whatever the defendant ' s age , &quot; every criminal act of an offender must translate into a definite consequence , &quot; as Peter Ramirez of the New York City family court puts it . Stiffer sanctions against violent juveniles , however , constitute only the first ( and relatively less incendiary ) step_in a broader reassessment . A growing number of candidates in both parties , but especially Republicans , are linking the rise in juvenile violence with the growth in out-of-wedlock births and welfare dependency . Jeb Bush , the GOP gubernatorial nominee in Florida , puts it flatly : &quot; The pathology of the welfare_state is , I think , the primary reason why we have . . . juvenile crime. &quot; In fact , research doesn ' t support such a blanket statement . An exhaustive Justice_Department review of sociological studies recently concluded that children from single-parent families are more likely to engage in delinquent and criminal behavior , and that crime_rates are higher in neighborhoods with high proportions of mother-only families . But millions of children grow_up in single-parent households without becoming delinquents or criminals . The high rates of crime in neighborhoods with lots of single mothers could also reflect other factors , like racial_segregation or poverty , researchers note . And other forms of dysfunction in &quot; intact &quot; families can also predict criminal behavior : child_abuse , criminal activity by parents and marital discord . &quot; Not all children follow the same path to delinquency , &quot; the review concluded . Still , the relationship between father absence and crime appears strong enough -- especially in isolated inner-city neighborhoods -- to force the issue of broken families into the juvenile crime debate . And that , in turn , is increasing discussion of what Princeton_University criminologist John J . DiIulio terms the &quot; most radical of radical social program proposals &quot; : an increased effort by government to guide the upbringing of children raised fatherless and poor . Put another way , what we are hearing is the opening notes of a movement to bring_back the orphanage . This call is coming from two directions . Social conservatives like William J . Bennett and Charles Murray see orphanages as a way to care_for children who could otherwise be left destitute by their proposals to cut_off all welfare benefits for single mothers , in the hope of discouraging illegitimacy . More intriguingly , criminologists like DiIulio are pushing the idea of orphanage-like institutions as a means of removing children from surroundings that raise their risk of involvement in crime . The leader in this modest movement has been UCLA management professor James Q . Wilson . In an article last month in Commentary , Wilson renewed his call_for &quot; group homes &quot; with strict rules and supervision , where single , teen-age parents and their children could live_in &quot; the kind of structured , consistent and nurturant environment that children need. &quot; In looking_to modernize and adapt the orphanage , these writers are championing an institution long out of favor . For years , the clear preference of social_welfare agencies has been to keep children in families , even those that only loosely deserve the name ; the Census_Bureau now counts fewer than 25 # 000 children living_in long-term care facilities like orphanages . Those numbers reflect the modern image of the orphanage as a close cousin to the prison . But that judgment is too sweeping . A study in the Atlantic Monthly of contemporary orphanages like the Children ' s Village in New York found many cheerful and effective : &quot; An institution may be the first home some children have ever known , &quot; concluded Mary-Lou Weisman . Even at this early stage , orphanage advocates are dividing into two camps : hard and soft . The hard side leans toward separating children from their parents , either by legal fiat or by eliminating the public assistance that parents need to keep their family together . That seems like a dead_end : It is difficult to imagine Americans accepting a policy that coerces women in significant numbers to give_up their children . But the approach of soft-siders could offer more grounds for experiment and consensus . UCLA ' s Wilson says that , except in the extreme cases that require removal , the goal should be to keep young single mothers with their children -- but to relocate both to a safer and more structured environment operated by private institutions like churches , with government financial_support . The left ' s initial reaction may be to recoil from such an idea as coercive itself ; but liberals should think_twice . While demanding more responsibility from young mothers ( curfews , progress toward high_school graduation ) , such institutions could also offer them more comprehensive services ( health_care , parenting classes , immunizations ) than they now receive . The rub is the cost . Mary Jo Bane , an assistant secretary at the Health and Human Services_Department , says successful orphanages now spend from $ 30 # 000 to $ 50 # 000 annually per child -- &quot; as much as it costs to run a prison or nursing home. &quot; Even converting welfare grants into vouchers that could be used to buy such services for children , as Sen . Joseph I . Lieberman ( D-Conn. ) and conservative House Republicans are suggesting , would n ' t cover even a fraction of that bill , she notes . Could institutions be designed that would provide comparable services at less cost ? No one knows . that ' s one reason to proceed cautiously . But at a time when states are minting dollars to punish violent juveniles , it makes_sense to at least experiment with new means of helping young people stay out of trouble in the first place . The Washington Outlook column appears here every_other Monday . The Rise in Arrests For most violent crimes , arrest rates for juveniles have been rising faster than the arrest rates for adults -- fueling the nationwide turn toward toughening sentences for youthful criminals . In 1992 , children younger than 18 committed more_than twice as_many murders as in 1983 , and almost twice as_many aggravated assaults . INCREASE IN ARREST RATES , 1983 to 1992 , JUVENILE VS . ADULT 03 # 39 , 10 # 14 Under 18 18 and older Murder and non-negligent manslaughter 128 % 9 % Forcible rape 25 % 14 % Aggravated assault 95 % 69 % Car theft 120 % 45 % Violent crime overall 57 % 50 % Source : FBI</TEXT>
