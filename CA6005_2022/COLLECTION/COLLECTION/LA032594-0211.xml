   <HEADLINE> 30 WOUNDED IN PROTEST OF HEBRON SIEGE ; MIDEAST : PALESTINIANS RIOT OVER ISRAELI USE OF FIREPOWER AGAINST MILITANTS IN DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fierce clashes spread through the Israeli-occupied territories Thursday as soldiers shot and wounded at least 30 Palestinians protesting the Israeli military ' s fiery two-day siege in the West_Bank town of Hebron . Israel Radio announced that two Israeli soldiers and three civilians were slightly wounded in the rioting and street fights that left more_than two_dozen Palestinians hospitalized throughout the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . The latest round of violence was triggered by a massive Israeli military operation in which 1 # 500 soldiers fired more_than 100 antitank missiles and thousands of rounds of ammunition into a house in Hebron , where four men the army called leaders of an armed Palestinian fundamentalist faction were holed_up . The 22-hour siege , in which a pregnant Palestinian woman was killed in the cross-fire , ended Wednesday evening . Israel ' s military censors had blocked news of the battle until Chief_of_Staff Gen . Ehud Barak announced it at a hearing of the government commission investigating last month ' s massacre of about 30 Palestinians in a mosque by an Israeli settler . Barak said all four militants were killed . The residential neighborhood of Hebron where the fighting took_place , less than a mile from the site of the mosque where the Feb . 25 massacre occurred , was still sealed_off by Israeli soldiers Thursday . A bulldozer finished leveling the three-story building where the Palestinians were thought to have been sheltered . Crews began sifting the rubble for bodies . Angered Palestinians and some Israelis criticized the military for using so_much firepower in a densely settled neighborhood . Military_leaders , however , continued to hail the Hebron operation as a key victory over armed Palestinian groups that publicly have vowed revenge for the massacre at Hebron ' s Cave of the Patriarchs , which Jews and Muslims believe is the burial_site of the prophet Abraham . Maj . Gen . Danny Yatom , the military commander of the West_Bank , said the army was justified in_using &quot; all our powers to ensure ( terrorist ) cells are wiped out. &quot; Most of the criticism focused_on timing . The army launched the operation just as delegates from Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization were convening in Cairo to try to restart talks that could finalize a long-delayed agreement for limited Palestinian autonomy in the West_Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip . The PLO had suspended those negotiations when Brooklyn-born physician Baruch Goldstein , a Jewish settler who lived near Hebron , opened_fire in the mosque at praying Arabs . In an interview with Israel Radio , the government ' s left-leaning Communications Minister Shulamit Aloni roundly condemned the siege . &quot; I think it was a mistake , &quot; she said . &quot; Even if they got four terrorists , is this how the best army in the Middle_East does catch four terrorists ? . . . If Israel wants to push the peace process forward , we have to get_it into our heads once and for all that , in our relations with the Palestinians , we are not the victims . We are the rulers . We are the occupiers. &quot; There was little optimism for the Cairo talks here after the siege . &quot; At this stage , we have not reached an agreement on any of the subjects , &quot; Israel ' s chief negotiator , Maj . Gen . Amnon Shahak , told Israel Radio in an afternoon interview . At the top of the list are PLO demands for an armed international observer force and a contingent of Palestinian police in Hebron , where more_than 120 # 000 Arabs have been under military curfew for almost a month to protect 415 Jewish settlers from retaliation .</TEXT>
