   <HEADLINE> ' CATHOLIC DIFFERENCES ' ARE MISSTATED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The table labeled &quot; Catholic Differences &quot; ( &quot; Tiny St . Matthew Rattles the Roman_Catholic Diocese , &quot; Nov . 28 ) contained inaccurate statements about the official teachings of the Roman_Catholic_Church . The source of the table was cited as &quot; St . Matthew Old_Catholic_Church , &quot; with no mention of input from the Roman_Catholic_Church . While it is true that the Roman_Church does not approve the ordination of women , it is not clear from the article that the &quot; Old_Catholic_Church &quot; ordains female priests either . The statement that &quot; women ' s involvement in ministry encouraged &quot; applies to the Old_Catholic_Church and not to the Roman_Church is untrue . Short of the ordained priesthood , women have always been encouraged to play an active role in_service within the Church . Especially since Vatican Council II , the Church has actively encouraged women to aspire to positions of leadership within the Church and has opened new opportunities of ministry to women . Also , the statement that in the Roman_Church &quot; Bishop , priests , deacons have elevated status &quot; in contrast to the Old_Catholic movement where &quot; laity plays prominent role in Church &quot; is ludicrous . Virtually all religions apply some sort of &quot; elevated status &quot; or respect_to their clergy , and I am sure that the Old_Catholic_Church is no exception . The Roman_Catholic_Church teaches that the role of the laity is essential to the life of the Church . This has been particularly emphasized by our current Pope , John Paul II . The major difference between the two churches is the disagreement over papal authority . LIZ GABAY Huntington Beach</TEXT>
