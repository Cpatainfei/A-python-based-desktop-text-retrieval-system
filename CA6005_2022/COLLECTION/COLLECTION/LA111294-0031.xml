   <HEADLINE> ELECTION CLOUDS OUTLOOK FOR WORLD TRADE PACT ; COMMERCE : CONGRESS ' VOTE THIS MONTH ON GATT ACCORD COULD INDICATE HOW CLINTON ' S INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AGENDA WILL FARE IN NEW POLITICAL CLIMATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Bill_Clinton made trade_policy a centerpiece of his economic program two years ago , he cited its broad bipartisan and economic appeal . Expanded trade , he declared , would protect American workers from unfair competition while opening foreign markets to the products of the nation ' s fields and factories . But the upheaval unleashed by Tuesday ' s elections threatens to throw cold water on President Clinton ' s efforts to win congressional approval of a new_world trade agreement . While most Clinton aides say that they expect the trade legislation to pass when a lame-duck Congress takes it up later this month , one senior Administration official said he fears that it could be in &quot; deep trouble. &quot; That outlook is a minority view , but other officials expressed concern that this week ' s electoral shake-up could threaten the Administration ' s goal of expanding the domestic economy by forging new ties to the global marketplace . The vote on the trade plan , scheduled for late this month , could provide an early signal of how Clinton ' s international economic agenda will fare in the new post-election political environment . Since many of the current members of Congress will be returning , the vote could also presage whether the new Republican majority and the Democratic minority will be able to find common_ground on politically sensitive issues , particularly those involving foreign_policy . &quot; Six months ago , no one was paying a lot of attention &quot; to the trade plan , said Lyn Nofziger , a Republican with long years of Washington experience . &quot; Now , a lot of people will be paying attention. &quot; Clinton on Thursday equated the vote with such historic congressional decisions as those on the League of Nations after World_War I and the Marshall Plan after World_War_II , and said that a delay in implementing the trade plan &quot; will jeopardize our leadership and our prosperity. &quot; &quot; It is the key link to free_trade , more open societies and economic_growth all around this world , &quot; he said in a speech at Georgetown University . But recognizing the concerns about the impact of low-wage foreign competition on U.S. jobs , Clinton said : &quot; For too many of our people , trade still appears to be a gale-force wind , just another threat ready to blow away the prospects of a stable job at a good wage , just another problem adding_to the already unstable , uncertain condition of their lives. &quot; Peter Sutherland , director general of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , warned , meanwhile , that the United States ' failure to ratify the trade pact by the end of the year would deal a &quot; mortal blow &quot; to the world trade system . The General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is the organization that has overseen global trade throughout the post-World War II era . Supporters of the trade agreement , which would redraw the rules of international commerce , worry that key Republican leaders will retreat from their promise to support legislation implementing the new pact . The Republicans pledged their support in October , just before a final vote was to take_place , on condition that Congress postpone the vote until after the election . The agreement ' s opponents are already working to put_off the once-delayed vote until the new Congress takes_office . But the election result could well reach beyond the immediate trade vote . In the longer_run , the so-called hawks , who are fighting expansion of free_trade , see the possibility of a powerful alliance raising serious obstacles . Conservative Republicans , suspicious of a growing international bureaucracy that would regulate global trade , might team_up with the pro-labor wing of the Democratic Party , led by House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt of Missouri , that has long been skeptical of free_trade , and other opponents of free_trade led in the Senate by Ernest F . Hollings ( D-S.C. ) . Such a political union , if joined by enough members of the House and Senate , could thwart Clinton ' s program in the next two years . The possibility of such an alliance worries those who see trade as the ticket to economic expansion . It would mark the crumbling of traditional Republican support for free_trade and a shift toward greater concern that the international trade authority was threatening U.S. independence and costing it money . &quot; All of a sudden you have a huge voter tidal_wave against big government , and government doing too_much , &quot; Nofziger said . &quot; I wonder if some Republicans are not going_to have to say to themselves : ' Will it be hurtful to me to be out there pushing another huge , international government program ? ' &quot; There is an additional trade problem , likely to surface after the vote . Most recent trade agreements have been negotiated under &quot; fast-track &quot; authority from Congress . This procedure prohibits Congress from amending a pact after it is completed -- a course that assures trading partners that a meticulously written agreement will not be torn_apart by the House and Senate . But the current authority expires at the end of this year and the President is expected to ask_for a renewal . To get that , said former Rep . William Frenzel , a Republican from Minnesota with long experience in the political world of trade issues , Clinton will &quot; have to go_to Congress hat in_hand , and that is a costly process for a President with a Congress that is not his pal. &quot; &quot; He is the economic President , &quot; Frenzel said . &quot; The best way for him to make 1996 look good is to have a thriving economy . He could , I suppose , cut taxes by a nickel or two , and increase spending by a nickel or two . None of these would have anywhere near the effect of a simple trade agreement . There ' s so_much punch_in a trade agreement , he can ' t ignore it. &quot; Take , for instance , the financial impact that the global trade plan is expected to have_on the economy . It would boost the strength of the U.S. economy by billions of dollars -- $ 100 billion to $ 200 billion , according to the Administration . Even less sanguine estimates -- in the vicinity of $ 65 billion -- predict an impressive boost to the economy . To a large degree this would result from cutting tariffs by an average of 40 % , eliminating them in such important sectors of the economy as steel , pharmaceuticals , paper and medical equipment . Services , which account_for about 60 % of the U.S. economy , would be brought under the rules of the international trading community and made more open , contributing to a likely expansion of international operations in accounting , engineering , advertising and health_care . The agreement would open agricultural trade , bring high-tech industries into the trading regime and -- proponents argued -- by expanding foreign sales of U.S. goods , it would create 500 # 000 jobs in this country . But critics said that , in agreeing to changed rules for international trade , the United States would leave itself open_to the demands of an international bureaucracy running the new_World Trade Organization , which would replace the 47-year-old General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . They also said that it would leave certain industries , among them textile and garment manufacturers , open_to unprotected competition with companies paying much lower wages in poor nations . The agreement ' s supporters have begun to worry because Sen . Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , the likely Senate majority_leader in January , has begun raising questions about it . Since Sunday , Dole has emphasized that he is getting more mail from Kansas raising doubts about the trade plan than he got a year ago over the controversial North_American Free_Trade Agreement that linked Canada , the United States and Mexico in a new tariff-free trade zone . &quot; It causes me some concern , &quot; he said at a news_conference Wednesday . Administration officials and others took such comments as nearly certain indications that Dole is having second_thoughts about supporting the plan and may act_on his proposal , made in September , that a vote be delayed until the new Congress is installed . He called_on Clinton to &quot; get_out front and tell people across the country &quot; what the trade plan would do and , in particular , just what the World Trade Organization would be . A senior White_House official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that the Administration had no more_than about 10 days to pin_down votes for the trade plan . He said that Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , White_House Chief_of_Staff Leon E . Panetta , Panetta ' s predecessor , Thomas ( Mack ) McLarty , and Robert E . Rubin , the President ' s chief economic adviser , are pressing business_executives to pressure their Republican allies in the House and Senate to support the plan . But , the official said , the real fear is that the Republicans will try to put_off a vote until next year , despite assurances by Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) , the likely Speaker of the House , that he will support the measure in the lame-duck session . Neither Republicans nor Democrats who favor the plan would gain by a delay , said Kenneth M . Duberstein , a Republican adviser who was former President Ronald Reagan ' s last White_House chief_of_staff . &quot; It doesn ' t help the Republicans to block it or to delay it and it doesn ' t help Clinton to say ' OK , let ' s wait , ' &quot; he said .</TEXT>
