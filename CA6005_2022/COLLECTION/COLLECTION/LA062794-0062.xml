   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : MORE PESSIMISTS ARE BEARING_DOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After last week ' s stock_market carnage -- and the potential for much more this week -- the ranks of confirmed Wall_Street bears are growing . The feeling that stocks have just been in a &quot; correction &quot; this year , after a three-year bull_market run , is giving_way to resignation that a genuine grizzly is bearing_down -- one that could slash 20 % or more from the average stock , measured from this year ' s peak prices . &quot; We think we have moved_into a bear_market , &quot; said Andy Engel , senior research analyst at the Leuthold Group , a Minneapolis investment advisory firm . &quot; We probably are in a bear_market , &quot; conceded Jim Crabbe , a veteran money manager at mutual_fund firm Crabbe Huson Group in Portland , Ore . On Friday , the Dow Jones industrials tumbled 62.15 points to 3 # 636.94 , the biggest one-day decline since March 30 -- when the market was in the midst of its first major downdraft related to the sinking dollar and surging bond yields . Even as the dollar recovered and bond yields eased earlier this month , the Dow failed to rebound within easy striking distance of its record high of 3 # 978.36 reached on Jan . 31 . From the spring low of 3 # 593.35 on April 4 , the Dow crested at 3 # 814.83 on June 14 -- before breaking_down again , as the dollar ' s slide resumed and bond yields jumped . In this latest stock decline , the broad market has fared much worse than the blue-chip Dow . The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks closed at a 12-month low of 693.79 on Friday , down 4.9 % for the week . That extended the drop from its all-time high to 13.7 % so far . Bearish analysts say Wall_Street ' s slow downward grind could accelerate this week , as the deteriorating market and political backdrops converge with normal end-of-quarter pressures to drive more gloomy investors out_of_stocks . Among the problems the market faces this week : * The dollar ' s dive below 100 Japanese yen early today in the Far East may herald a battle_royal between currency speculators and the world ' s central_banks , most of which attempted to support the dollar Friday , with only mixed results . Every decline in the dollar raises the odds that foreign owners of U.S. stocks and bonds will dump more of their U.S. holdings , because the dollar ' s weakness automatically devalues their portfolios . * Growing expectations of another hike in short-term interest_rates by the Federal_Reserve_Board -- to defend the dollar -- could spark heavy selling of stocks by investors who had believed the Fed was finished tightening credit at least until fall . The Fed ' s policy-making committee will meet July 5 , immediately after the three-day weekend for the Independence_Day holiday . Thus , investors who are unwilling to carry stocks over the long weekend , fearing a Fed rate boost , may feel compelled to sell this week . * A slew of political setbacks worldwide in recent days has raised new questions about global leadership -- or the lack thereof -- as the world economy attempts to escape the last vestiges of the early- ' 90s recession . In Japan , the fledgling government of Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata resigned on Saturday rather than face a no-confidence vote . In the United States , the dollar ' s slump has sparked fresh criticism of President Bill_Clinton ' s policies . In Europe , the European Union was unable to reach agreement over the weekend on a successor to outgoing European Commission President Jacques Delors . And in Mexico , Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo , who is responsible_for overseeing the presidential election on Aug . 21 , abruptly resigned on Friday , only to rescind his decision on Sunday . * Finally , the second quarter ' s end on Thursday means some portfolio managers will as usual be eager to do some &quot; window dressing &quot; this week , cleaning dogs out of their portfolios and perhaps raising cash levels ( and lowering their overall exposure to stocks ) to show clients a more cautious approach on second-quarter statements . Of course , with so_much working against the market , some Wall Streeters believe that the smarter approach today isn ' t to bet with the bears , but to take a contrarian view -- the idea being that the market will always do its best to confound the majority ' s outlook . Michael Burke , whose New Rochelle , N.Y.-based Investors Intelligence service tracks bull and bear sentiment weekly among 135 market newsletter writers , admits that the percentage of bullish newsletters , now 27.2 % , is near its lowest reading since 1988 . But Burke believes the gloom has become so overdone that &quot; we ' re getting close to a bottom in the market. &quot; While the bears point to sinking indexes like the Dow and the Nasdaq composite , Burke notes that &quot; a lot of stocks are holding well above their April lows , &quot; which he views_as a sign of a market getting ready to turn . But many pros warn that contrarianism , when applied to the broad market , can become a trap during a true bear phase . The fact that most people are bearish doesn ' t necessarily mean that all or most of them have yet sold any stock , after the long bull_market . It ' s the gradual capitulation of those &quot; fully invested bears &quot; that can drive the market painfully lower as bad news take its toll on investor psychology . If the bear is here , exactly what kind of bear will it be ? Here ' s how some experts see it : * Jeffrey Applegate , strategist at brokerage CS First Boston in New York , views this as an interest-rate-induced bear_market that doesn ' t reflect anything fundamentally wrong with the economy or with corporate profits . The market , Applegate says , is merely learning to live with higher interest_rates and a stronger economy , but that ' s enough of a shock ( after five years of falling rates ) to cause a bear phase , he says . He sees the bottom for the Dow industrials at around 3 # 400 , which would be about a 15 % decline -- traditionally , the minimum drop required to be called a bear_market . Given the relatively mild further losses that he expects , Applegate questions whether many investors should bother to sell_out of stocks on the expectation of buying back later , at lower prices . The reality , he says , is that many investors will find it extremely difficult to nail the timing on this one . * Crabbe , of Crabbe Huson , expects a market so volatile that &quot; it ' s going_to be hard to recognize it ( as a bear ) day to day. &quot; He believes the Dow could even rebound to its 1994 peak later this year , but that &quot; we ' d still be in a bear market. &quot; Ultimately , he expects the average stock to lose 25 % of its value , from peak levels , before this decline runs its course . That means a Dow of about 3 # 000 at the bottom . But because of the volatility he foresees , Crabbe believes this market will be ideal for stock pickers who know how to trade . He likens it to the late-1970s -- a terrible period for buy-and-hold investors , but a great time for nimble opportunists , he says . Two depressed stocks he has been buying : Apple Computer ( $ 25.61 on Nasdaq ) , and spinal-implant maker Sofamor / Danek ( $ 12.25 on NYSE ) . * Andrew Addison , who writes the Addison Report market newsletter from Franklin , Mass. , surmises that the bear_market is already about eight months old , and expects this to be a &quot; traditional &quot; one -- meaning it could last 12 to 18 months in all , he says . He sees the Dow eventually bottoming at 3 # 200 to 3 # 400 . &quot; It ' ll be painful , but typical , &quot; he says , and not the horrific meltdown that some mega-bears predict . Investors who aren ' t willing to try and time the market may just want to consider buying some hedges to help their portfolio , Addison says . He thinks gold stocks and energy-service stocks , for example , will gain even as the broad market sinks . Tax Issues If You Sell a Fund Bear-market-fearing mutual_fund investors who decide to sell part or all_of their fund holdings should think in_advance about tax ramifications . The Internal Revenue Service requires that you pick one of four accounting methods to calculate gains or losses on fund shares you sell , and each method can result in different tax consequences . Moreover , once you select an accounting method for a particular fund , you must use that method for all subsequent sales of that fund . The four methods : * First in , first out ( FIFO ) . This method assumes you sell shares_in the order they were purchased , thus recording gains or losses based on specific prices you paid_for each share . Obviously , this can be cumbersome ( especially if you ' re reinvesting dividends regularly in new shares ) . But if you don ' t specify another accounting method when you sell , the IRS will assume you ' re using this one . * Specific identification . If you ' re selling only part of your fund holdings , you can specify ( to the fund company ) exactly which shares you want sold , thereby managing the size of the gain or loss realized . But like FIFO , this method requires diligent record-keeping on your part . * Average_cost , single category . The easiest accounting method , and one that some fund companies will figure for you . Under this method , the total purchase cost of all shares_in your account is divided by the number of shares held , giving you a single average_cost basis per share , which you then use to figure the gain or loss on shares sold . The holding period ( short-term or long-term ) for each share sold is based on FIFO . * Average_cost , double category . Same as above , except you figure two average per-share costs : One for shares held long-term ( longer than one year ) and one for shares held short-term ( one year or less ) . This is useful if you have been an active buyer over the past year , and want to separate long-term gains or losses from short-term ones , for tax purposes . ( Remember , long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains. )</TEXT>
