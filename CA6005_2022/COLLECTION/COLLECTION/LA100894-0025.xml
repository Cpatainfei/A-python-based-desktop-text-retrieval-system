   <HEADLINE> IRAQ BACK TO SQUARE 1 ON SANCTIONS ; MIDEAST : BUILDUP OF TROOPS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO EFFORTS TO GET U.N. TO LIFT CURBS THAT HAVE CRIPPLED THE NATION ' S ECONOMY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By sending some of his best troops south toward the border with Kuwait , Iraqi President Saddam Hussein seems to have shattered his country ' s hope of having the United Nations lift the sanctions that have devastated its economy . Word of the troop movements came Friday as Iraq ' s top diplomat , Deputy Prime_Minister Tarik Aziz , was appealing_to the United Nations to lift the sanctions , which he said are responsible_for growing malnutrition , inadequate medical_care and widespread suffering . In a speech to the U.N. General_Assembly devoted almost entirely to the issue of sanctions , Aziz claimed that Baghdad has fully implemented many of the conditions imposed by the U.N. Security_Council after Iraq ' s defeat in the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War and is entitled to at least partial relief from the sanctions . But he said the United States has prevented the council from relaxing the embargo . From Iraq ' s standpoint , the most troublesome sanction prohibits Baghdad from selling its oil on world markets except under a tight U.N. supervision in which all_of the revenue would be devoted to humanitarian relief within Iraq and to payment of war reparations to Kuwait . Iraq denounced the restrictions as a violation of its sovereignty and refused to sell its oil under those conditions . Iraq offered no explanation for advancing its forces toward Kuwait . A Defense Ministry statement said only that Iraqi troop movements on Iraqi territory were no one else ' s business . But coupled with Aziz ' s speech in New York , the action seemed a particularly heavy-handed -- and almost certainly self-defeating -- attempt to intimidate the world community . &quot; If it is a serious deployment , then it runs counter to any interest in lifting the embargo , &quot; said William B . Quandt , a former National Security_Council Middle_East expert . &quot; If they are trying to get countries to ease_up on the embargo , it seems counterproductive , because one requirement for lifting the embargo is for them to respect the Kuwait border , &quot; said Quandt , now a professor at the University of Virginia . The sanctions originally were imposed after Iraq ' s invasion of Kuwait in August , 1990 . After Iraq ' s defeat the following year in the Persian_Gulf_War , the Security_Council ruled that the sanctions would remain in place until Iraq destroyed its nuclear and chemical weapons programs , ended persecution of Kurds and other Iraqi minority groups , recognized the sovereignty of Kuwait and accepted a U.N.-imposed settlement of a border dispute with Kuwait . Before the latest troop movements , Iraq seemed to be making some headway in its effort to win the right to unrestricted sale of its oil . Earlier this year , U.N. inspectors reported that Iraq was in substantial compliance with the provisions requiring destruction of its nuclear_weapons potential . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said recently that his country -- like the United States a permanent member of the Security_Council -- believes that it is time to allow Iraq to resume oil sales , at least for a trial period . But the United States continues to insist that the sanctions be kept_in place , saying the Iraqis have not complied with all aspects of the resolution . Iraq has not yet officially recognized Kuwait or accepted the border demarcation . In his speech to the General_Assembly , Aziz bitterly attacked the U.S. position . &quot; The United States of America is persistently obstructing any steps toward the direct legal application of the resolutions of the ( Security ) Council , particularly those provisions relating to lifting sanctions from Iraq , and is conducting itself on the basis of biased political motives which bear no relation_to either the resolutions of the Council or the ( U.N. ) charter , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
