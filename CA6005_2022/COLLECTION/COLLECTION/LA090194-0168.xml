   <TEXT> SHEDDING STRIPES : Friends of Gen . Ronald R . Fogleman are predicting that one of his first changes as new Air_Force chief_of_staff later this year will be to scuttle the controversial officers uniform launched by his predecessor , Gen . Merrill A . McPeak , in 1991 . The design , which combines an airline-style jacket and trousers with naval_officers ' stripes on the sleeves , was intended to bring American Air_Force uniforms closer to those of Britons and other NATO allies . But it bombed here at_home , where Air_Force veterans derided it as &quot; looking_like a bunch of Delta Air Lines pilots who are working for the Navy. &quot; . . . As a result , career officers have been slow to make the transition . Williamson Murray , an Ohio State University military history professor who has known Fogleman for years , says the new boss is likely to drop the uniform -- which officers must buy themselves -- early in his term . &quot; He ' s very conscious of tradition , &quot; Murray says , &quot; and the fact is that the Air_Force emanated from the Army , not from the civilian airlines. &quot; * THE DI-FI FLY : No single piece of legislation has meant so_much to Sen . Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) as the crime bill , which includes a ban on 19 types of assault-style weapons that stands as her greatest legislative achievement . So it was no wonder her face went blank and she left an interview in mid-sentence to fly FloJo-like back into the Senate chamber last Thursday night when told she , of all people , had failed to vote . . . . In fact , Feinstein already had proudly cast her &quot; aye &quot; vote loudly enough for everyone to hear -- everyone , apparently , except the recording clerk who was taking roll . Panting , she set the record straight , averting what would have been a final paradox in the bill ' s tortuous path to approval . * STANDING ALONE : Benjamin F . Chavis Jr. , formerly the executive_director of the NAACP , now must realize how fickle fame can be , especially if there ' s a whiff of scandal in the air . A day after he was fired as the leader of the nation ' s oldest civil_rights group , Chavis hosted a 2 1 / 2-day summit of African American leaders in Baltimore . . . . Usually such an event would attract many of the nation ' s best-known , traditional civil_rights leaders . Not this time . The only big name attendee was Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan , and he skipped out after just one day . Chavis was fired after revelations that , without NAACP board knowledge , he disbursed $ 64 # 000 of the organization ' s money -- and promised to spend up_to $ 332 # 000 -- to settle a threatened sex discrimination and wrongful discharge lawsuit brought by a former aide . . . . Chavis is suing his former bosses to regain his job . Abbey Hairston , Chavis ' attorney , has argued that the firing damaged Chavis ' reputation among civil_rights leaders . The absentee list at his summit might be Exhibit A . * CANDIDATE ORSON : Remember Orson Swindle , the memorably named Vietnam_war hero who managed Ross Perot ' s second campaign for the presidency in 1992 ? He ' s back in politics , running_for Congress as a Republican from his home state of Hawaii . . . . His first order_of_business , it seems , is trying to overcome a moniker some might regard_as a handicap . His solution : play_down Swindle and trumpet Orson . His campaign stationery , bumper sticker and even his business_card depict his first_name in large bold letters , with &quot; Swindle &quot; in very small print underneath . In a letter accompanying a folder of campaign material and in his official biography , he is consistently referred to as &quot; Orson. &quot;</TEXT>
