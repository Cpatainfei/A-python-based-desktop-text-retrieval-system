   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; GRANDDADDY OF AN OPENER AT ROSE BOWL ; SHOWCASE : ROMANIA-COLOMBIA MATCHUP FIRST OF EIGHT WORLD CUP GAMES AT PASADENA VENUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By Gheorghe , are you ready for some futbol ? Today at 4:30 p.m. at the Rose Bowl , two of the finest athletic teams on the planet meet in a game that figures to produce 36 fewer points than Wisconsin and UCLA managed on the same field 5 1 / 2 months ago . Wisconsin won that game , 21-16 . Colombia should win this one , 1-0 . Or it could be Romania , 1-0 . One or the other . Today , the World Cup arrives in Pasadena , bringing with it the world ' s grandest sporting spectacle , the quadrennial monthlong soccer festival that , in terms of global import , will dwarf every_other event ever held_in the Arroyo Seco , from the Rose Bowl to the Super Bowl to the 1984 Summer Olympic soccer tournament . What possibly could be bigger than the Granddaddy of Them All ? How about the Gran Abuelo of Them All -- the great-grandfather of all athletic competitions , guaranteed to captivate the undivided attention of 23 countries worldwide -- the United States is also entered -- with a projected cumulative television audience of 32 billion ? Archie Griffin swept right end here . So did Ernie Nevers . Ron VanderKelen , Frankie Albert and Jim Plunkett once filled the sky above with spirals . Some of the greatest names in the history of college football have staked their claim inside this arena , but this afternoon , the marquee gives_way to stars of a different inflection . The big names at the Rose Bowl today : Romania ' s Gheorghe Hagi , &quot; the Maradona of the Carpathians. &quot; And Colombia ' s Carlos Valderrama , &quot; the Mad Hairdo of Santa Marta. &quot; The Romania-Colombia match is the first of eight World Cup games scheduled for the Rose Bowl , leading to the July 17 final . Sunday , Sweden and Cameroon will play , followed by the United States ' last two matches in Group_A competition -- against Colombia on Wednesday and Romania on June 26 . Those games should determine whether the United States advances to the second round for the first time since the inaugural World Cup in 1930 . That will largely determine whether Americans finally catch soccer fever in 1994 -- or , as in the sport itself , refuse to touch it with their hands . Advance and Miracle On Bermuda will transfix the nation . Go three-and-out , however , and Alan Rothenberg ' s Great American Soccer Campaign ( &quot; Everybody Plays . . . Will Somebody Please Watch ? &quot; ) will be belly up before July 1 . Thus , the Rose Bowl stands ready to witness either the greatest breakthrough in U.S. soccer or its greatest heartbreak . After group play is finished , the Rose Bowl will be the site of four games in the single-elimination &quot; knockout &quot; -- one game in the round of 16 , one semifinal , the third-place game and the final . The final , expected to draw a television audience of 2 billion , is the glittering prize of any World Cup , and Pasadena won it primarily on its track record . The Rose Bowl ' s large playing surface , wider than in most multipurpose stadiums , and its mammoth seating_capacity make_it the preeminent soccer facility in the country , with the turnstile figures to prove it . In 1984 , the Rose Bowl held the largest Stateside soccer crowd ever -- 101 # 799 for the Olympic final between France and Brazil -- and this month , 91 # 123 watched the United States beat Mexico , 1-0 , in a World Cup tuneup . Although the audience was overwhelmingly pro-Mexico -- for one day , it was the Verde , Blanco y Rojo Bowl -- the crowd was the largest to watch a U.S. national soccer team play inside the United States . For the World Cup , the Rose Bowl will seat roughly 92 # 000 , with about 4 # 000 seats removed in the corners to allow_for a wider field . Given the reputation of international soccer fans , the stadium has been accordingly refortified , giving the place the distinct feel of a military compound festooned in brightly colored banners . An extra 10-foot-tall chain-link fence now traverses the stadium ' s original fence , creating an extra security wall . Temporary barriers have been installed just outside the press_box elevator entrance . New tunnels have been constructed to ease evacuation in the case of an emergency . Security has also been stepped_up , with an intensive on-site force drawing from the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department , the Los Angeles Police_Department , the FBI and 40 other local , state and federal agencies . Spectators have been advised that pat-down searches and bag inspections will be conducted at all perimeter gates . All that is missing are signs reading , &quot; Enter at Your Own Frisk. &quot; Aesthetically , this will not rank as the Rose Bowl ' s finest moment , not with the blockades and the barbed-wire coils . But such is the price one pays when it is permitted to punch the World Cup ' s ticket . By the time it arrives Wednesday , the U.S. team will wish it were half so well-defended . Today ' s Game WHAT : Colombia plays Romania in a World Cup Group_A game . WHERE : Rose Bowl . WHEN : 4:30 p.m. TV : ESPN , Univision .</TEXT>
