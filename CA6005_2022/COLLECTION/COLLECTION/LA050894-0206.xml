   <HEADLINE> THE LAW IS ROOT OF IMMIGRATION DEBATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Regarding the debate over children born to immigrants , as a former Russian lawyer , I suggest a curious comparison . If a child is born to Russian parents in America , he is a citizen of the United States . This is American law . If a child is born to American parents in Russia , he is not a citizen of Russia . Why ? Because according to American law , he is still a citizen of the United States . This is Russian law . Isn ' t it a reason why a lot of Russians live_in the United States , and no Americans in Russia ? VLADAMIR BOGORAD Van Nuys</TEXT>
