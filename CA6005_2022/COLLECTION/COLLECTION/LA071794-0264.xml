   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : AN EDUCATED RITA RETURNS ; BRITISH ACTRESS JULIE WALTERS CAPTURED AN OSCAR NOMINATION , THEN PUT HER CAREER ON HOLD TO CARE FOR A SICK DAUGHTER . BUT SHE ' S BACK IN TWO NEW FILMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s 10 years ago now since Julie Walters first entered the consciousness of American filmgoers in &quot; Educating Rita , &quot; playing a young working-class housewife who wants to improve herself by studying literature . She was hugely endearing in the role , which won her an Oscar nomination , and Walters charmed America in_person with her refreshingly down-to-earth and comic honesty . &quot; I went_on the Johnny Carson show , and he invited me back while we were still on air , &quot; says Walters , now 44 . &quot; I did a huge tour of the States , I was driven_around in limos that were bigger than my flat in London . It was great fun. &quot; It looked_like a terrific film career as a comic actress might be budding , but instead Walters returned to England and stuck_to stage work and TV . As a collaborator of comedian , singer-songwriter and playwright Victoria Wood , Walters has become one of British TV ' s best-known faces . that ' s one reason she seems to have been out of the public_eye , to Americans at least . But there is another : Almost four years ago Walters ' daughter , Maisie , then 2 1 / 2 years old , was diagnosed as suffering from leukemia . The actress immediately stopped work for six months to care_for her daughter , and worked only sporadically for the next two years . Only now is Walters starting to emerge from the trauma that enveloped her daughter , herself and Maisie ' s father , Grant Roffey . Her film &quot; The Summer_House &quot; with Jeanne Moreau was well-received when it opened in Stateside theaters last Christmas ; this summer she stars in two new movies , both of which open Friday . The first is &quot; Just Like a Woman , &quot; in which Walters plays a divorced London housewife who takes_in a lodger , an American merchant banker called Gerald ( Adrian Pasdar ) . They embark upon an affair , but then it transpires that Gerald is a transvestite . The other is &quot; The Wedding_Gift , &quot; a BBC TV film based on a true story . Walters plays Diana Longden , a middle-aged woman almost immobilized by a mysterious disease that doctors cannot diagnose . She relies_on the moral support of her compulsively wisecracking husband , Derick ( Jim Broadbent ) , but , sensing her own mortality , encourages him to fall_in_love with a blind female novelist . The two films were actually shot a year apart , but their simultaneous release confirms that Walters is back to work in_earnest . &quot; Maisie ' s great , &quot; says Walters with a broad grin . She has arranged this interview at a restaurant and hotel near her home_in the Sussex countryside , some 40 miles south of London . It ' s typical of her unpretentious manner that she starts the conversation by apologizing for her hair being wet ; it ' s 10 a.m. , and she has only just jumped_out of the shower . She is a dream to interview -- friendly , talkative , totally without affectation and fond of digressing with anecdotes for which she lapses into a variety of accents . A trim , bouncy woman with sharp features and an alert , almost bird-like manner , she laughs loud and often . Walters explains that her daughter has just completed her last appointment for blood_tests at the Royal Marsden Hospital , a center for cancer patients . &quot; She ' s 6 years old now , and she ' s really well . She couldn ' t have more energy . The doctors say the chance of this recurring are about the same as her having a road accident . Leukemia ' s a cancer that responds to long-term chemotherapy , and she ' s been_on it for three years . Every weekend she would be tired and washed_out because of it , but Grant and I were still happy , because it was_better than her having leukemia. &quot; There was one setback -- Maisie had a relapse when she was 4 . &quot; We thought , that ' s it , we have to face her death , &quot; Walters says . &quot; It was a terrible time for us all. &quot; Predictably the_British tabloid press played the story to the hilt , and Walters and Roffey became accustomed to reporters and photographers camped_out on their lawn . &quot; They ' d take pictures of Maisie ' s empty swing , they fabricated stories without talking to us , it was incredible , &quot; she says . Eventually Walters decided to go public about Maisie ' s illness and auctioned an exclusive interview for which a London newspaper paid 20 # 000 ( $ 30 # 000 ) ; the fee went straight to the Royal Marsden ' s children ' s unit . Walters was already one of Britain ' s best-loved personalities , but when the story about Maisie broke , the outpouring of sympathy was extraordinary : &quot; We got so many letters from people , many of whom had been in the same boat . There was this huge wave of warmth . It was lovely . Around this time I met Princess Diana , and even she said : ' How is she ? ' &quot; Walters admits her tribulations may have helped in her portrayal in &quot; The Wedding Gift. &quot; &quot; I ' d been through that experience , except I was playing the victim of an illness , &quot; she says . &quot; But I know that feeling of getting_through each day , and of that being a victory . &quot; It certainly puts another dimension on your feelings , but I ' m frightened of tapping the Maisie area in my sense memory . I worry that once I unleash it , the feelings would just never stop . It ' s plumbing the depths of feelings , and I feel in a way it ' s not right to. &quot; She is enthusiastic about &quot; The Wedding_Gift , &quot; which was known in Britain as &quot; Wide Eyed and Legless &quot; -- the title of a pop song by British group Amen Corner that Derick and Diana used to sing rowdily . &quot; I think ' The Wedding_Gift ' is a strange title , &quot; says Walters , &quot; but I suppose ' Wide Eyed and Legless ' ( British slang meaning drunk ) doesn ' t mean much in the States . It would make people think_of amputees or something . &quot; But I ' m pleased with that work , doubly so because it was so lovely to do . I was sent the script while I was making ' Just Like a Woman , ' and I found it so touching and funny it made me cry -- which scripts rarely do . On set I thought all_of us did our absolute best. &quot; Walters has less to say about &quot; Just Like a Woman , &quot; which opened in Britain in 1992 to lukewarm reviews and did indifferent business : &quot; I ' m glad I did_it . I thought it was good to do a middle-of-the-road film about a subject like that , because they ' re usually art house , &quot; she pauses slyly for effect . &quot; Of course , not many people saw it anyhow , so it might as well have been art house . I liked my character . Her responses to Gerald were good and honorable and right . But the film didn ' t tell me anything more about transvestitism , which is a fascinating subject. &quot; Despite winning an Oscar nomination for her first major film role , Walters never saw herself as an actress with a movie career based in America . &quot; When I went_to Los Angeles for the Oscars , I was taken around for meetings . And I was offered a Burt Reynolds picture called ' Stick. ' But I thought , no . I was taken along by Columbia Pictures to CAA and they got me an agent . Everyone was shocked I didn ' t want to do_it . &quot; They said , come_on , it ' s a big American picture , don ' t you want to ? And I said no , it ' s crap . I can ' t understand why they ' re offering me this part . . . . &quot; They offered me a_couple_of other things , but I could sense they didn ' t really know what to do with me . I could tell that the things that really interested me , the really good scripts , were going_to come from England . &quot; I could have stayed in L.A. and tried to make something happen . But what was the point ? No one was going_to say , look , you can play a lead role opposite Jack Nicholson . Why would they ? There are enough American actresses to do that . &quot; I had great fun , but I was visiting , so I was free to say what I liked and go_home . But I couldn ' t take the glitz and lip gloss and shoulder_pads , and the fact that people felt they have to look gorgeous all_the time . I ' d hate to be an actress in L.A. I couldn ' t stand the pressure. &quot; Walters was born and raised in Smethwick , an unlovely suburb of Birmingham , England . ( When she discovers this writer lived within a mile of her around the same time , she becomes genuinely gleeful , and the interview is suspended for serious reminiscing about the area and mutual friends from school. ) Her mother was an Irish housewife , her father a builder and decorator . Neither parent encouraged an acting career , so she entered nursing instead , then took the plunge and enrolled for a drama course at a college in Manchester : &quot; My mother said , acting ? No good_will come of it , she ' ll be in the gutter before she ' s 20 . Which on occasions turned_out to be true. &quot; She went_on to join the company at Liverpool Everyman Theatre , which brought her into contact with playwrights like Willy Russell ( &quot; Educating Rita &quot; ) and Alan Bleasdale ( &quot; GBH , &quot; the_British miniseries in which she was seen last year. ) Respected actors like Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Sher were also at the Everyman ; she sees her period there as a career turning point . Though comic acting seems to be her forte , she has tackled serious stage roles too : She won rave reviews as Serafina , the ranting Sicilian widow in Tennessee Williams ' &quot; The Rose Tattoo , &quot; wearing an enormous latex overlay beneath her clothes to fill_out her trim figure . This was_after a six-month break from work to tend to Maisie , and the strain of returning to such a physically demanding role caused a bout of labyrinthitis , an inflammation of the inner_ear that left her dizzy , nauseous , fatigued and unsure of her balance . Still , the worst seems to be over for Walters and her family . She is filming a comic play by Victoria Wood called &quot; Pat and Margaret. &quot; Walters plays a British actress who becomes a star on an American TV soap and returns to Britain to find skeletons in her family ' s closet . Then she will start work_on a miniseries by Bleasdale , &quot; Jake ' s Progress , &quot; in which she is the mother of a hyperactive child with behavioral disorders . Things are looking_up , then ? &quot; Yes , &quot; she says cheerfully . &quot; Everything ' s a lot better than it was . When we look_back and realize how stressed out we were over Maisie , it ' s incredible . We were just exhausted and that became the norm , really . It ' s only now we ' re through the worst that we realize how bad things were. &quot;</TEXT>
