   <HEADLINE> $ 7 MILLION FOR WORLD CUP BOSS ; SOCCER : ROTHENBERG AWARDED BIG BONUS WHEN THE EVENT MAKES A $ 60-MILLION PROFIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alan Rothenberg will receive $ 7 million in compensation for serving as the World Cup Organizing Committee ' s chairman and chief_executive_officer , the Times learned Tuesday . The World Cup Board of Directors released the event ' s preliminary financial accounting , and projected the monthlong soccer tournament ' s net at $ 60 million , about three times earlier estimates . The board announced that Rothenberg would receive a $ 3-million bonus . However , two board_members said the board also voted Rothenberg an additional $ 4 million as part of a deferred-compensation package for &quot; back pay due , &quot; calculated at $ 800 # 000 a year , running from August of 1990 through next year . In addition , Rothenberg ' s extensive expenses the last four years had previously been reimbursed by the committee . Rothenberg could not be reached for comment . In 1992 , Rothenberg declined a salary of $ 350 # 000 a year that was offered by the board , saying he would accept compensation only if a surplus was produced . Rothenberg said many times later that he was not receiving a salary . Board_member Peter V . Ueberroth , who chaired the Compensation Committee , said Tuesday that an outside consulting group had given a range of figures for the executive bonuses and that the board had made the final determinations . The board also voted Scott LeTellier , WCOC chief operating officer , a $ 500 # 000 bonus ; Executive_Vice_President Marla Messing a $ 350 # 000 bonus , and Chief Administrative Officer Eli Primrose-Smith a $ 250 # 000 bonus , a board_member said . In an era of declining sports marketing dollars and increasing costs of mounting international sporting events , the surplus is considered by some to be remarkable . Early projections called_for a $ 20-million profit . &quot; I think the figures are exceptional , &quot; said Ueberroth , who organized the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles that netted $ 225 million . &quot; In this country , we like to kick ourselves around . We are often embarrassed by our success in America . It ' s a good omen for Atlanta ( site of the 1996 Olympic Games ) . &quot; The board announced that it expected to turn_over $ 40 million to the U.S. Soccer Federation Foundation , a nonprofit organization established to promote and support soccer in the United States . The issue of bonuses had been controversial among soccer insiders . Before the World Cup , even officials within the U.S. Soccer Federation , of which Rothenberg is the president , called_for a closer accounting of what they characterized as the big spending habits of World Cup officials . The board , which met last Wednesday , wasn ' t in complete agreement on the issue of Rothenberg ' s compensation . There was a nay vote and two abstentions on the question of awarding Rothenberg $ 4 million in back pay . &quot; I ' m against paying a guy for a volunteer job , &quot; said one board_member , asking not to be identified . Other bonuses voted by the board : deferred salary continuation for 418 full-time employees , which amounted to $ 7.7 million , and a bonus pool of $ 1 million to be shared by about 60 employees .</TEXT>
