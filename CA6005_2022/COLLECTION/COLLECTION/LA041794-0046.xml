   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : A VISION OF VENICE PAVILION AS AN ARTS CENTER FOR CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Te ' amir Sweeney is a talkative , gregarious boy who lives_in Oakwood , a Venice neighborhood where mothers are said to put their babies to bed in bathtubs to protect them from drive-by bullets . I don ' t know if Te ' amir , 7 1 / 2 and a passionate gymnast , spends much time thinking_about street violence and gang intrigue , but he needs to be protected from it . And , like all_the children in this violence-plagued city , he needs a safe haven to play . Last summer , his mother enrolled him in a photography workshop sponsored by Venice Arts Mecca , a nonprofit neighborhood group founded by actor Bingwa Thomas after the riots . The idea was to offer_up the arts as an alternative to the streets . Thomas spoke_to residents of Oakwood to learn what their pressing needs were ; he discovered that child_care ranked first , followed by activities for children , teens and young adults . &quot; There are always sports available , but as far as teaching a love for the arts and creativity , these people can really offer something , &quot; said Ramona Sweeney , Te ' amir ' s mother . This spring , Venice Arts Mecca has offered video , photography and painting workshops ; a jazz ensemble , and a theater group . Venues vary ; the organization could offer a whole_lot more if it had a permanent space . I propose to take_over a controversial and underused building -- the Venice Pavilion -- and turn it into a community arts center , with a day-care facility for children and job training for teen-agers . Lynn Warshafsky , president of the board of Venice Arts Mecca , estimates that 100 jobs -- not all_of them permanent -- would be created by the renovation . The group has several potential corporate donors lined_up -- including Southern California Gas Co . and L.A. Gear -- and figures an initial investment of $ 1.6 million will suffice for renovation and operating expenses in the first year . All it wants from the city is a long-term lease . * The Pavilion sits on the sands of Venice Beach like a moribund whale . It commands singular views of the bay -- better than those of the swanky beach clubs up the way in Santa Monica , better than those of the ritzy homes along the Marina Peninsula to the south . Decaying , graffiti-scared , ignored and smelling of urine , it is , in many ways , a symbol of the way this city treats its youth . Built_in 1961 on more_than five acres , the Pavilion contains a large indoor theater ; an outdoor_stage ; a wind-sheltered , palm-dotted picnic_area with 60 picnic tables ; a police substation ; kitchen facilities for a seaside cafe ; shuffleboard and boccie_ball courts . In 1985 , when the financial going got rough , the city gave_up on the place . Today , the theater is closed and in_disrepair , the kitchens are not used , and the picnic_area is a fierce-looking graffiti pit . The only viable operation in the place these days is the police substation . In Venice public meetings , discussion of the Pavilion ' s fate is guaranteed to raise a ruckus . A plan to renovate the Boardwalk is being formulated , and because the city has had neither the will , apparently , nor the imagination to recapture an invaluable asset , the Pavilion ' s days may be numbered . Councilwoman Ruth Galanter , who has supported Venice Arts Mecca ' s programs , said she has taken no position on whether the Pavilion should be renovated or removed . &quot; Its future needs to be addressed , &quot; she said , &quot; along with the whole future of the beachfront area. &quot; Many people want the thing gone -- too ugly , too hard to make_it work . Too attractive to drug dealers and the homeless . Others , with a little more vision , see an unparalleled resource for a community virtually under siege by gangs -- last weekend alone , four people were shot in Venice drive-bys . They are asking the city to give the Pavilion , and the children of Venice , another chance . You could argue , if you were so inclined , that the spirit of the law requires it . * In November , 1992 , L.A. County voters passed Proposition A , aimed at improving the county ' s parks and open spaces with the express intent of providing &quot; safe places for children to play and alternatives to gangs. &quot; The law also gives high priority &quot; to help prevent gangs by using funds from this act to employ youth to work_on restoration or rehabilitation projects . . . in their communities. &quot; Venice Beach has been allocated a modest $ 10 million to carry_out the mandates of Proposition A , which include repair of the pier , restoration of beach facilities , improvements to the median of Venice Boulevard and to Ballona Lagoon . Much of the discussion at rancorous public meetings has centered_on whether the boardwalk should be repaved with brick or asphalt , how much to spend on trash_cans and restrooms , and how best to restore the historic picnic pagodas . On Wednesday , the Board of Recreation and Park_Commissioners will consider whether to ask nonprofit groups for Pavilion restoration ideas . This could be good news for the Venice Arts Mecca . But it could be even better news for the children .</TEXT>
