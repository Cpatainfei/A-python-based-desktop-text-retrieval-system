   <HEADLINE> SMOG LEVELS , FIRE RISK RISE WITH THE HEAT ; WEATHER : RESIDENTS HIT BEACHES AND POOLS , OR JUST SEEK_OUT SHADE , TO ESCAPE SIZZLING TEMPERATURES , WHICH ARE FORECAST TO CONTINUE THROUGH SUNDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Air_pollution advisories were issued from Simi Valley to Santa Paula on Friday as sweltering temperatures and a lack of ocean breezes drove air_pollution to unhealthful levels . Smog levels were expected to remain high today in Simi Valley , Moorpark , Fillmore , Piru and Santa Paula , as a muggy heat_wave hovers over coastal Southern California through the weekend . Fire officials , meanwhile , cautioned that the sizzling temperatures and dry brush could make_for an explosive mix_in the Ventura County backcountry . Such was the case on Friday when a small grass fire on Pine Mountain rekindled after being extinguished a week ago with 10 # 000 gallons of water . The ridge-top flare-up , already surrounded by fire lines , was doused within an hour . &quot; It ' s extremely rare that we have a rekindle like that , &quot; said Mike Preasmeyer , with the U . S . Forest Service ' s Ojai Ranger District . &quot; That tells you how dry conditions are , especially in the pine litter. &quot; Preasmeyer added that forest rangers plan to step_up patrols this weekend because today marks the opening of deer hunting_season for much of the Ojai backcountry . Rangers will give verbal warnings to hunters for hazards such_as illegal campfires . &quot; Even particles from an exhaust on a poorly maintained vehicle could cause a fire , &quot; Preasmeyer said . Forecasters from the National Weather Service said the unusually warm weather stems from a high-pressure system hovering over Arizona and is expected to last through Sunday . &quot; When you get a pattern like that , it will usually prohibit a sea_breeze from coming_in , &quot; said forecaster David Gomberg . &quot; And that ' s what we count_on every day to keep us cool. &quot; The same high-pressure system on Friday unleashed powerful thunderstorms over the San Jacinto Mountains and prompted officials to issue a flash_flood watch for Palm Springs . Ventura County , however , is not expected to see rain in the next few days . Temperatures on Friday topped 100 in Simi Valley , Thousand Oaks , Fillmore and Ojai . In Oxnard and Ventura , highs ranged from the high 70s to the mid-80s . &quot; I think everyone ' s staying inside and sipping iced_tea , &quot; said Ventura County Fire Capt . R . Bosman , who works_at the Tapo Canyon station , where the temperature peaked at 105 degrees at 2:45 p.m. &quot; I ' ve been here for 10 years , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t recall it ever being hotter than 105. &quot; Dispatchers with the county Fire_Department reported no heat-related rescue calls . And officials with hospitals in Thousand Oaks and Santa Paula said they had treated no patients suffering heat_exhaustion . Still , residents in most of eastern Ventura County , particularly those with respiratory problems , were warned Friday to avoid strenuous exercise because of high smog levels . In Simi Valley , the Pollutant Standard Index was 136 on a scale that considers anything above 100 unhealthy . Gary Arcemore , a meteorologist with the Ventura County Air_Pollution Control District , said possible effects of exercising on a smoggy day include difficulty breathing , burning eyes , headache and a runny nose . Earlier Friday , residents were less concerned about health risks and more interested in finding some shade . Mike Hart climbed_down from the metal roof of the Thousand Oaks Library around 3 p.m. after working under the scorching sun for eight hours . &quot; It was so hot_up there if you touched the metal for too long you would burn your hands , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s pretty much nothing we can do but sweat a lot and hope for a breeze , &quot; said Hart , who is supervising roof repairs that began two weeks ago . &quot; We just have to grin and bear it. &quot; The heat brought_out kindness in some , such_as the resident who greeted mail_carrier Linda Morelock with a glass of iced_tea midway through her postal route . &quot; That was really nice because we don ' t have air conditioning in these trucks , &quot; Morelock said . Although beaches in Ventura were slightly more crowded than usual by the afternoon , Thousand Oaks ' city parks and streets were nearly deserted . &quot; I think everyone except me is inside in their air-conditioned homes , &quot; said Thousand Oaks resident Cheryl DeWick , who was forced outdoors for three hours while exterminators fumigated her home . &quot; This is awful , &quot; she said , trying to find shade under a small tree at Conejo Creek Park . &quot; There ' s no escaping it. &quot; Times staff writer Mack Reed and correspondent Matthew Mosk contributed to this article .</TEXT>
