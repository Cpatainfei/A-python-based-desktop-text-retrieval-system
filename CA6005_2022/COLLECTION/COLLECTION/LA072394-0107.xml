   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : WOODLAND HILLS ; HOSTING PARTIES MORE LUCRATIVE FOR SCHOOLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Party planners may soon have a new venue to consider : public_schools . A shift in Los Angeles Unified School District policy to allow campuses to keep most of the revenues collected by renting_out their facilities is giving public_schools an incentive to polish their party-hosting skills . At least one already has . The West Valley Occupational Center in Woodland Hills is marketing its four-acre landscaped garden as a serene , park-like setting ideal for a wedding_reception . In the past , funds collected from renting school sites for parties , conferences and other functions went directly to the district and were earmarked to be used for class-size reduction . When the budget crisis worsened several years ago , the money -- about $ 500 # 000 a year -- went directly into the general fund . Now , in response to recommendations from an Arthur Andersen &amp; Co . audit of the district last year , the district will allow schools to keep about 70 % of their revenues and use the money however they see fit . &quot; We ' re excited , &quot; said Bob Niccum , director of the district ' s real_estate division . &quot; This gives schools money that goes_over and above what they would normally get. &quot; The goal is to let every school keep all it makes , but given the current budget crisis , Niccum said , that is not yet possible . But because of its unique park , the West Valley Occupational Center negotiated a deal with the district to keep 100 % of its income . &quot; It ' s just a win-win situation , &quot; West Valley Principal Harlan Barbanell said . &quot; It ' s putting money back into our program. &quot; Niccum said the district is trying to identify other schools with special features that would be eligible for such an arrangement . One campus is already under_consideration for a cellular antenna and another for use of its parking structure , he said . The occupational center will put the $ 50 an hour it earns by renting its mini-park directly back into the landscape_architecture program that maintains it . &quot; This is just a good break for an occupational program because it allows us to teach entrepreneurial skills , &quot; Barbanell said . &quot; This gives students the skills of running a little business. &quot; Barbanell said renting the park could be just the beginning of business ventures on campus . He said he hopes to one day host a wedding_reception with cosmetology students fixing the bride ' s coiffure , bakery students making the cake , photography students shooting the video and automotive students driving the limousine .
