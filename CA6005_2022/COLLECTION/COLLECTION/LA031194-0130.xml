   <HEADLINE> WHEN LASSIE COMES HOME ; WHEN NEW MOVIE VERSION OF THE POOCH HITS THEATERS THIS SUMMER , DEMAND FOR COLLIE LOOK-ALIKES IS EXPECTED TO SOAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the newest &quot; Lassie &quot; movie reaches theaters this summer , Paramount Pictures won ' t be the only one with a chance to profit from the courageous hound . Pet stores and dog breeders can expect a surge in customers who simply must have a collie of_their_own . It ' s a common phenomenon . Beer commercials featuring Spuds MacKenzie made the American bull_terrier popular overnight , industry experts say . After the 1990 film &quot; Beethoven , &quot; St . Bernards became the rage . &quot; If they have seen it in a commercial or a movie , everybody wants one , &quot; said Todd Wick , manager of Pups N ' Pets in North Hollywood . &quot; It ' s like a fad. &quot; This is not a story about the average family visiting their local animal shelter in search of a lovable pet . This is about people who desire an exact replica of what they ' ve seen on screen . When the dog in_question is a mixed breed -- a mutt like &quot; Benji , &quot; for example -- finding a look-alike can be tricky . Not so with purebreds . Perhaps the best example of the &quot; hot dog &quot; syndrome involves the 1985 re-release of Disney ' s animated classic &quot; 101 Dalmatians. &quot; The black-and-white dog quickly shot into the Top 10 of the American Kennel Club ' s list of popular breeds , where it remains . But a lot of people smitten with spots didn ' t realize that Dalmatians are highly energetic and prone to deafness , both of which can make them difficult to raise . At the same time , experts say , the demand for Dalmatians encouraged new breeders to leap into business , which increased risks of genetic defects the arise from over-breeding . A similar scenario could unfold when &quot; Lassie &quot; makes her big-screen comeback in August . So , potential owners blinded by a case of puppy_love may find themselves yearning for a dog that might not be suited for them . And even the forewarned shopper risks purchasing a poorly bred animal . &quot; People have to be careful , &quot; said Jim Whitman , an executive_vice_president at Petland Inc. , which operates a Northridge shop as well as 136 others nationwide . &quot; It ' s buyer beware when a breed gets very popular. &quot; * Stardom and dogs share a long history . Rin Tin Tin was the first canine movie idol . A Lana Turner-figure in doggy film lore , he was discovered in a deserted German army outpost after World_War I and went_on to star in dozens of films . The Alsatian produced such big box_office numbers that he was dubbed &quot; the mortgage-lifter &quot; for saving his studio from financial ruin . In the years since , movies such_as &quot; The Shaggy Dog , &quot; &quot; Old Yeller &quot; and &quot; Benji &quot; have garnered similar success , lending credence to the acting axiom : Never share the spotlight with a child or an animal because you ' re likely to be upstaged . Other types of animals have grabbed the limelight , including Cheetah the chimp , Francis the Talking Mule and Flipper the dolphin . But , according to the Film Encyclopedia , Hollywood favors dogs because they are easy to train . And , this being the Chinese Year of the Dog , the movie_industry will return this summer to a proven formula : * &quot; The Goofy Movie &quot; brings Disney ' s rubbery hound to a full-length feature . * &quot; The Yellow Dog &quot; stars Bruce Davison and Mimi Rogers in the adventure of a teen-age boy who lands in the rugged wilderness of the Pacific Northwest and befriends a trusted dog . * &quot; The Myth of the White_Wolf &quot; continues the adventures of the half-dog , half-wolf named White Fang . * It is not beyond the realm of possibility , industry experts say , that pet stores will soon receive inquiries about wolf_pups . When it comes_to dogs and movies , they say , practical considerations fly out the window . The results can be disastrous . &quot; Usually it goes something like this : You get an animal you thought you wanted and you get_it home and it bites your kid or kills your cat . Maybe it barks all night . Or it jumps the fence , &quot; said Lt . Richard Felosky of the Los Angeles Animal Regulation Department . &quot; The breed has a lot to do with it . You need to know what to expect from a certain breed of dog and ask yourself if you ' re willing to spend time training the dog away from bad habits. &quot; Behavior is merely one consideration . Collies , for example , require twice-a-week brushings because of their long hair . &quot; Not a lazy man ' s dog , &quot; Wick explained . And although some pet store workers insist that dogs can adapt to any environment , those adorable Labrador_retriever puppies inevitably grow too_large for an apartment . &quot; There are some times when you look_at the couple and the dog and think , ' This is a match made in heaven , ' &quot; said Marlyn Diamond-Gray , manager of Peggy Wood ' s Pet Emporium in Burbank . &quot; Other times you think , ' Maybe not. ' &quot; Caution was especially warranted during the Shar-Pei craze a_few years back . Whitman says a fad arose when Neiman Marcus featured the wrinkly Chinese breed on the cover of its Christmas catalogue . &quot; We had people come_in and say , ' I ' ve got_to have one , I ' ve got_to have one , ' &quot; he recalled . &quot; We told them , point-blank , that the breed has significant skin_problems that have to be managed . There are special needs with their eyes because of all_the skin folds. &quot; Petland stores made customers sign a letter of acknowledgment before selling them a Shar-Pei . &quot; We spent as much time talking people out of the dog as we did selling them the dog , &quot; Whitman said . &quot; We sent them home with a rabbit. &quot; Some pet stores undoubtedly prefer to make a sale . With the release of its annual rankings , the AKC warns that pet shoppers should take_care to &quot; choose a breed of dog that is appropriate for their needs and not because they think it is fashionable. &quot; Similarly , Felosky insists that consumers bear the ultimate responsibility . * &quot; It ' s like shopping for shoes , &quot; the shelter official said . &quot; When you buy a pair of shoes , you look_at color and size , is it made of a comfortable material ? &quot; The variables increase with living , breathing creatures . Felosky suggests spending an hour in a public_library before beginning the search for a pet . &quot; There are some excellent books that will tell you what you need to know about each breed , &quot; he said . Potential owners should ask themselves a number of questions . Do they have enough space for the size of dog they want ? If they have children , is the breed gentle with kids ? Do they want the pet to be a watchdog ? If so , do they want a large dog that will scare intruders or merely a barker to sound the alarm ? Few of these issues are addressed on the silver_screen . As for the dog ' s breeding , laymen can know only so_much . Industry experts suggest that veteran breeders are more reliable . And a breeder who keeps the dogs in a clean and spacious environment is less likely to over-breed . When buying from a pet store , consumers risk getting a dog from what the industry calls &quot; puppy mills &quot; or &quot; back-yard breeders &quot; who recklessly breed father to daughter or mother to son to produce as_many puppies as possible . This can result in dogs that suffer health_problems or are nervous and hyperactive . Consumers should ask their pet_shop plenty of questions about the breeder . &quot; We do our best , &quot; Diamond-Gray said . &quot; Our general_manager and the vice_president of our corporation tour all_the kennels . They ' ve met the people , had dinner in their homes . They ' ve seen how the animals are kept. &quot; Likewise , experts say , dog owners who do a little research first are the ones who tend to be happiest with the animal they choose . that ' s vital because many breeds live from 15 to 20 years . * For some people , a collie might fill those years with companionship . Others might find themselves happier with another breed . &quot; The bottom_line is , don ' t pick a dog because it is what ' s cool and what ' s pretty and what ' s prestigious , &quot; Whitman said . &quot; It ' s like meeting someone in Las Vegas and getting_married . You wake_up the next morning and say , ' Uh-oh. ' &quot; Top_Dogs The American Kennel Club last week announced its most popular breeds of 1993 . These are the purebred dogs that , among the 136 recognized by the AKC , accounted_for the most new registrations last year : 1 . Labrador_retriever 2 . Rottweiler 3 . German_shepherd 4 . Cocker_spaniel 5 . Golden retriever 6 . Poodle 7 . Beagle 8 . Dachshund 9 . Dalmatian 10 . Shetland sheep_dog When Picking a Pooch . . . Five questions to ask : 1 . Do we have enough time to exercise and care_for this dog ? 2 . Do we have enough room ? 3 . Can we afford to feed this animal ? 4 . Will it get_along_with our kids ? 5 . Should we get a male ( generally aggressive ) or female ( gentler ) ?</TEXT>
