   <HEADLINE> RUSSIANS FALL VICTIM TO THE BOOMERANG LOGIC OF BOSNIA ; BALKANS : SERBIAN LEADERS INSISTED MOSCOW SEND PEACEKEEPERS . NOW THE POLICEMEN ARE BEING TARGETED BY REBEL GUNMEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Vladimir Krapivin ' s meaty hands form a bowl under his collection of shell fragments , proffered as evidence of the harassment he and other Russian policemen endure as they wait to play their part in a stalled U.N. airlift for northern Bosnia ' s war victims . &quot; They shoot at us all_the time , &quot; says the exasperated Russian , deployed to the U.N.-controlled airport here to inspect aid cargo for contraband . &quot; They get drunk , and they shoot at anything that moves. &quot; Krapivin is not grousing about Bosnian government forces , who object to the assignment of Russian civilian policemen to the airlift for fear they will work_on behalf of their Slavic Christian brothers , the rebel Serbs . It was Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic who insisted on the deployment of 80 Russian police monitors as a condition for consenting to the humanitarian relief flights that will mostly benefit Muslim refugees . Instead , in the boomerang logic of Balkan politics , it is the Serbs who are shooting at the Russians , just as they target other U.N. soldiers and policemen . The artillery shells and mortars are random expressions of wrath at the U.N. Protection Force , which last month halted a deadly Serbian offensive against the eastern city of Gorazde . While some of the 400 Russian troops deployed to Serb-held areas around the capital of Sarajevo say they believe that the globally condemned Serbian nationalists have been getting an unfair rap , the first four policemen assigned to Tuzla ' s airport have taken pains to appear impartial . &quot; We are not here as Russians but as members of UNPROFOR , &quot; insists Yevgeny Cherenkov , jutting his chin toward the sky-blue U.N. emblem stitched to his sleeve . That internationalist pose has riled the Serbian gunmen , who have the airport in their sights from less than five miles away . The three-week Serbian offensive against Gorazde that captured nearly half of the U.N.-designated safe area and killed hundreds of Muslim civilians discredited the rebels in the eyes of the outside world , including their traditional allies in Russia . Russia ' s deputy foreign_minister and special Balkans envoy , Vitaly S . Churkin , complained after shuttling among Serbian leaders in a failed attempt to head_off the Gorazde debacle that he had never been lied to so_much in his life . Russian troops guarding impounded Serbian weapons in the Sarajevo suburb of Hreso were taken captive by angry rebels after token North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization air strikes against Serbs attacking Gorazde , and a Ukrainian soldier was shot to death in Serb-held territory there last week . Whatever sympathies the Slavic peacekeepers might have had for the Serbs seem to be waning as they are exposed to indiscriminate acts of retaliation . But the isolation the Serbian nationalists have brought_on themselves since Gorazde may be dawning on them , because signs have emerged in the last few days that they want to repair relations with the U.N. mission . Bosnia-Herzegovina ' s Muslim-led government had refused to resume negotiations on an ethnic partitioning plan proposed by the United States , Russia and Western Europe , complaining that the Serbs were blatantly violating a NATO ultimatum to withdraw from a 1.9-mile radius around Gorazde . U.N. officers in Gorazde have confirmed that at least 150 Serbian soldiers remained deployed inside the exclusion zone after an April 21 deadline , having switched from army camouflage to blue jumpsuits to masquerade as civilian policemen . A senior Serbian military official , rebel Chief_of_Staff Manojlo Milovanovic , promised U.N. officials that all armed Serbian forces would be withdrawn from the Gorazde safe area by 6 p.m. Sunday . The pledge raised hopes among U.N. officials that the rebels want to restart peace talks . U.N. monitors reported no signs of an impending withdrawal by the Serbs on Sunday afternoon , U.N. spokesman Maj . Rob Annink said . But he noted that communications with the region were poor and that compliance could be achieved swiftly if the rebels are sincere .</TEXT>
