   <HEADLINE> ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH : KEEPING_UP ON THINGS WHEREVER YOU ARE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In today ' s work world , timely information is an essential commodity for doing business . But getting information on_the_road can be tricky . As a business_traveler , you may be cut_off from your routine sources of information -- the publications you usually read or the electronic_databases to which you usually have access . But information purveyors are figuring_out new ways to deliver information while you ' re on_the_road . Here are some of the options available to business_travelers hungry for news , especially about the place they are visiting or developments back home . Newspapers Most major hotels , of course , offer guests complimentary morning newspapers delivered to their doors . In most cases , it is the local paper for the city in which the hotel is located . Other hotel chains will deliver a national paper , such_as USA Today or the Wall_Street Journal . In addition , many hotels subscribe_to several papers , which they place in the lobby for the use of guests . Many business_travelers take the opportunity to read local papers when they ' re traveling as a way to learn about events that might not make the papers at_home . When traveling internationally , ask the hotel concierge about international papers , such_as the Financial Times , the International Herald Tribune or , if you ' re traveling through the Pacific Rim , the Asian Wall_Street Journal . Hotels can usually obtain these papers for you . Faxes For people who either can ' t get or can ' t wait for the paper , a growing number of news organizations are offering condensed versions of the next day ' s paper by fax the night before . This month , for example , CPC Communications Inc. , a subsidiary of New York-based CPC Printing , which is one of the largest printers of financial documents in the world , is launching a 10-page fax newspaper geared to business users both on_the_road and at_home . The paper , called Info-Wire , comes_out at 2 p.m. PST and is designed to reach business_travelers through airlines , resorts , hotels and cruise_ships , as well as in local corporate offices . For example , a hotel or airline would receive the faxed version daily , then copy it and distribute it to travelers . CPC is negotiating with a chain of Caribbean resorts , as well as with numerous hotel companies and the major airlines , Publisher Paul Schaye said . &quot; We ' re aimed at the person who is off-line , &quot; Schaye said . &quot; The person in a hotel is not in their standard flow of information , and they ' re really starved for their flow of information. &quot; Info-Wire , which is compiled from staff reports and wire_services , contains mostly business news and stock_market information , but it also includes a page of world news and a page of sports . Info-Wire may be the latest , but it is not the first to put faxed information into the hands of travelers . In November , 1990 , New York Times Co . started a six-page fax for people who don ' t have ready access to the newspaper . The fax is a condensed version of the newspaper , with a cross-section of news , features and sports -- even the crossword_puzzle . The fax , which goes_out at 8 p.m. PST in_advance of the next day ' s paper , has about 150 # 000 readers , more_than 75 % of them Americans who are traveling , Publisher Patricia Ecke said . Most travelers read copies of the fax paper distributed by their hotels or cruise_ships . Dow Jones &amp; Co. , publishers of the Wall_Street Journal , has also begun distributing a two-page fax of financial news from the Journal . Journal Fax comes_out at 2 p.m. PST and contains highlights from the next day ' s Wall_Street Journal , said Pat McParland , product manager for Dow Jones ' personal publishing division . Currently , there is just one version , which goes_to hotels and individual subscribers . However , the company is working_on a customized version that would allow individuals to receive selected stock quotes for their portfolios in addition to the news , she said . In addition , the Los Angeles Times Syndicate has been offering Financial Fax since 1992 . The one-page executive summary of stock information has been customized for each subscriber ' s portfolio . Each report contains business news notes and commentary . Travelers can have Financial Fax forwarded to any fax number they choose so their reports can reach them when they ' re on_the_road . And the London-based Financial Times is looking_into providing faxed information , according to spokesman Keith Jackson . Although faxed information offers some advantages to people in remote locations , or to those who need information sooner than they can get_it in the regular paper , fax is really a transitional technology , Ecke said . &quot; It ' s a bridge between print and the new electronic distribution of news , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s an in-between mode. &quot; Interactive Technology For travelers who can take their computers with them , or who know they will have access to a computer at their destination , there are several on-line news services . Subscribers with a laptop , modem and a phone_line can get access to news sources ranging from wire_services , such_as Associated Press or Reuters , to newspapers , such_as the Washington Post or the Financial Times . The three largest on-line services are CompuServe , Prodigy and America Online . In September , the Los Angeles Times will introduce its own on-line news service that will be distributed through Prodigy . In addition , the Financial Times is available on FT Profile , as is information from BBC World Broadcasts , the Economist and Business Week . Some of the on-line services , including CompuServe , also offer electronic clipping services that will search out articles on topics of interest to the subscriber and put them in a special file .</TEXT>
