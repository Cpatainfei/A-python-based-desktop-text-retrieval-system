   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; ACTIVIST HAS 2-PART PLAN TO HELP NATIVE AMERICANS ON RESERVATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Delbert E . ( Black_Fox ) Pomani is asking_for help in collecting gifts , clothes and food for orphans on Native_American reservations throughout the country . He plans to drive to the reservations with other Native_Americans to hand_out the goods just before Christmas . The drivers will rent trucks to make the deliveries . Pomani ' s goal is part of a vision he had when he was 13 , growing_up on a reservation in North_Dakota . The other part is to compile all treaties signed by the U.S._government and Native_Americans in an effort to unite tribes throughout the nation and urge that the treaties be honored . Many of the treaties of the late 1800s call_for free health-care services , education and housing for all Native_Americans living_on reservations in exchange for an end to fighting . The fighting stopped , but many reservations are so poor that there is no running water , electricity , schools or hospitals , said Pomani , a full-blooded Hunkpapa Sioux . Pomani , 34 , lives in a Fullerton apartment , where he has headquartered All Nations Gathering of Treaties , a new nonprofit organization . Once Pomani and other Native_Americans from tribes all_over the country have collected the treaties , the group plans to hold a conference and later present the treaties to the United Nations and President Clinton to demand better living conditions on the reservations . &quot; It is our overdue right , &quot; Pomani said . Other Native_Americans agree . Matthew ( Haump-Ha-Nazhee ) Cleveland , Bear clan chief of the Hochunk Nation on the Winnebago reservation in Wisconsin , said the main purpose of the treaty gathering is to promote unity . &quot; What we are fighting for so dearly is to get our treaty rights so we can retain our Indian traditions , values , principles and languages , &quot; said Cleveland , who is coordinating the treaty gathering conference , which will take_place some time in the summer . &quot; It would be the most beautiful thing if all_the nations could come_together as one , &quot; said Frank Graywolf , supportive services coordinator for the Southern California Indian Center . &quot; We are all one . We all have the same things in our heart and if we could just come_together to look_after each other and take_care of each other , than everything around us would be OK. &quot; Officials at the U.S. Department_of_the_Interior ' s Bureau of Indian Affairs said that California treaties were never ratified and , therefore , are not valid . Other treaties may be challenged in court , said Silas Ortley , a tribal operations specialist . &quot; But I ' m not sure if there ' s still time to file suit , &quot; he said . &quot; As far as ( unsatisfactory ) services , they need to bring it to the attention of Congress , who may_not be aware &quot; of poor living conditions . Pomani and Cleveland said they will notify Congress . &quot; There ' s a lot that needs to be done for the Native_Americans , &quot; said Amye Williams , secretary of the treaty gathering group . &quot; It ' s time that somebody made people aware of the way Indians live_in their own land . What Delbert is doing is really good. &quot; MIMI KO</TEXT>
