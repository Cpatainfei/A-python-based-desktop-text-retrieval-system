   <HEADLINE> ATHLETIC OFFICIALS AT CSUN PLEDGE NOT TO GIVE_UP ; FINANCES : HIEGERT VOWS TO BRING THE FUNDING REFERENDUM , WHICH FAILED BY 87 VOTES , TO THE BALLOT_BOX AGAIN NEXT FALL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Athletic administrators at Cal State Northridge have altered an age-old rallying_cry in the wake of a failed attempt to secure additional funding for the school ' s sports programs . &quot; Wait till next year &quot; has become instead , &quot; Wait till next semester. &quot; A proposed fee increase for athletics was narrowly rejected in a vote by Northridge students this week , but Athletic Director Bob Hiegert pledged Thursday that similar legislation will be_on the ballot again next fall . If a fee increase is not passed , the school faces the loss of its football program , Hiegert said . &quot; We ' re going to come_back with another referendum and we ' re going to get_it passed , &quot; Hiegert said . The measure failed , 993-906 , although it passed , 892-875 , among students polled at Northridge . Swinging the vote were results tabulated from the school ' s satellite campus in Ventura , where the proposal lost by a 118-14 count . &quot; Next time we need to send our team to that campus , &quot; said women ' s volleyball Coach Lian Kang Lu , who had his players canvassing Northridge polling areas . &quot; I ' ll drive them in my car. &quot; The proposal called_for fee increases of $ 6 per semester beginning in the fall and growing to $ 40 by the fall of 1998 . Also failing , and by a far more lopsided margin , was a proposal to change the Northridge nickname . Only 392 votes were cast for a switch from Matadors to Quakes , a name that proponents argued would help the school capitalize on the Jan . 17 earthquake from a marketing standpoint . Voting to retain the nickname were 1 # 334 students , and 172 voted to change to another , unspecified nickname . Athletic officials had anticipated a close vote on the fee increase proposal . Last month , Judith Brame , Northridge ' s associate athletic director , challenged Northridge coaches to &quot; play this one like it ' s a championship game &quot; at a meeting during which the proposal was unveiled . Several coaches took the advice to heart . Softball and football_players were required to vote before they were allowed to practice . As a result , the start of Northridge ' s first spring football workout was delayed more_than an hour . The future of football at Northridge hangs precariously in the balance as athletic officials begin to review their strategy for a second attempt . Gender-equity requirements that call_for schools in the Cal State system to reach funding and participation parity in men ' s and women ' s sports by the 1998-99 school_year have left Northridge officials playing catch-up in a lopsided numbers game . With additional funding , Northridge planned to add soccer and at least one other sport to its list of offerings for women . Without more money , Hiegert said , the school might be forced to slash its largest and most expensive men ' s program -- football -- to reach compliance . Under terms of an agreement reached in October between the CSU system and the California chapter of the National Organization for Women , the 19 CSU campuses with NCAA athletic programs must : * Provide athletic opportunities for women proportional to the number of NCAA-eligible female undergraduates on each campus , within 5 % . * Provide scholarships for women ' s sports in_proportion_to the number of eligible female undergraduates on each campus , within 5 % . * Fund men ' s and women ' s sports programs within 10 % of each other . Currently , about 65 % of Northridge athletes are men , and male sports teams account_for roughly 60 % of the athletic program ' s budget_for salaries , operations and scholarships . Under the school ' s 1992-93 athletic budget , the elimination of football would have placed Northridge within the agreed funding guidelines and almost qualifying in terms of participation . &quot; It doesn ' t take a rocket scientist to figure it out , &quot; Hiegert said . &quot; Your resources wind_up dictating your participation numbers . If you don ' t have the resources , you end_up taking people off the field. &quot; Similar dilemmas have forced the demise of football programs at Cal State Long_Beach , Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Hayward . Hayward announced the elimination of its football program earlier this year after students rejected a proposed fee increase similar to the one at Northridge . Students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo , San Francisco State and Chico State have passed fee increases for athletics in recent years . However , none of those campuses faced a series of economic blows comparable_to those absorbed by Northridge in the past year . &quot; The last five years in the state system have been ugly , &quot; said Gary Torgeson , the softball coach , &quot; and here it ' s been worse because the earthquake left a lot of students around here out_of_work . Now is not exactly the best time to be asking_for more money. &quot; However , at least one factor -- a small voter_turnout -- seemed to favor athletics . &quot; As a department , we were relying_on apathy , &quot; one coach said . &quot; If you put ballots in people ' s hands ( the proposal ) goes_down in flames . It ' s not even close. &quot; Men ' s volleyball Coach John Price said the key for a second successful attempt will be voter education . &quot; If you get a referendum on the ballot that says , ' Do you want your fees increased ? ' you ' re going to get a lot of no votes , &quot; he said . &quot; We need to get people out explaining the issue so the students can make an informed choice . If they understand it , they ' ll vote for it. &quot; Lu , who came_to Northridge from UC Santa Barbara , advised school administrators to be persistent in their push for a fee increase . An athletics fee at Santa Barbara was rejected four times before it passed last year . &quot; If you have good organization , you will win , &quot; Lu said . &quot; ' Failure is the foundation for success . When you fail , you learn. &quot;</TEXT>
