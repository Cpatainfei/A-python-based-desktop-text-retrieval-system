   <TEXT> In anticipation of the Jewish New Year 5755 , which begins at sundown Monday , the Washington-based Israel Policy Forum has mailed a booklet , &quot; For the Sake of Peace : A Resource Guide for the High_Holidays , &quot; to rabbis in the United States . Compiled by Los Angeles rabbinical student Mona Alfi , the 48-page guide is accompanied by a letter from Israeli Prime_Minister Itzhak Rabin urging the 4 # 000 Orthodox , Conservative , Reform and Reconstructionist members of the rabbinate to use it in preparing sermons that strongly support his government ' s peace initiative . A similar letter from 11 rabbis who participated in the booklet ' s preparation -- including Harvey Fields of Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles and Arnold Rachlis of University Synagogue in Irvine -- was included . None of the letter ' s signers represents the Orthodox movement , which accounts_for about 7 % of the Jewish population in the United States . Rabbinical sermons reach their largest audiences during the Days of Awe , a 10-day period of self-reflection , reconciliation and renewal , during which many of Los Angeles ' nearly 500 # 000 Jews will go_to synagogues to hear the ritual blasts of the ram ' s horn , said Alfi , a second-year rabbinical student at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles . She said she did not know how many rabbis would be using the guide , but said that most rabbis customarily devote at least one sermon to Israel during this period . The topic will be even more prominent in rabbinate minds this year , Alfi said , because the first anniversary of the historic handshake between Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and their signing of the Declaration of Principles of Peace falls during the holiday period , which culminates after sundown on Yom Kippur ( Day_of_Atonement ) on Sept . 15 . Jonathan Jacoby , executive_vice_president of the policy institute and a Los Angeles native , said : &quot; The guide is based on prayer , Torah and other religious sources . We ' ve even included the original Hebrew texts , so that rabbis who have a problem with the translations can use their own. &quot; In addition to excerpts from the Bible , quotes from sermons and articles promoting peace and addresses of Jewish organizations , the guide includes opinion polls conducted among Jews in Israel and the United States showing that about three-fourths of their populations support the peace process . Rachlis , who was placing the finishing touches_on his own sermons , noted that &quot; although the vast majority of American Jews and Israelis support Rabin and the peace process , many American Jewish organizations have remained silent and overly cautious , creating a vacuum for anti-peace factions to fill. &quot; &quot; The purpose of preparing the booklet , &quot; he said , &quot; was to help rabbis inspire their congregations to not only bask in the pleasure of peace but also to work proactively through Jewish organizations , synagogues and charities to make_sure that the fledgling peace is sustained and built upon. &quot; He noted that the past year brought not only a peace agreement but also &quot; a number of terrorist incidents that can sometimes dishearten even those most optimistic about an eventual peace. &quot; But , he hastened to add , &quot; Prime_Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister ( Shimon ) Peres have both said that . . . we dare not let the terrorists win by giving_up the peace process in the face of these tragedies. &quot; Alfi , who was a policy analyst for the America Israel Public Affairs Committee before deciding on a career change , said : &quot; Many of us who work for peace are acting not from humanist beliefs , but directly from our religious tradition , which enjoins us to seek peace . Jews may disagree on the particulars , &quot; she added , &quot; but love for Israel is universal throughout our community. &quot; CELEBRATION St .
