   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / GROUP D PREVIEW ; TURMOIL ' S TEAM ; ARGENTINA HAS KNACK FOR TURNING BAD FORTUNE AND BAD FEELINGS INTO GOOD RESULTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Something will happen . Some collapse or crisis or catastrophe will present itself and the national soccer team of Argentina will be delirious with joy . Infighting , attacks from without , injuries and feuds : At last , the proper ambience in which to conduct a World Cup campaign . that ' s not to discount the importance of the disasters that already have befallen Argentina , as seen from the_Argentines ' point_of_view : the ill-advised selection of an inappropriate coach , the unfairly harsh multiple-month suspensions of their two best players for cocaine use , and cruel opponents with dirty tactics during World Cup qualifying . Those were the helpful items . Now come the daily , almost hourly updates of outrage from the team ' s fading and portly star , whose threats to quit the team are as frequent as his trips to the snack_bar . What to expect of Argentina , a team historically possessed of players of singular brilliance and verve and often equally bad manners ? Expect the team to concoct something , some obstacle that will elevate its mental sharpness to the level of its physical skill . This was the team that has found a kind of perverse buoyancy in moments of deepest despair . Witness the team ' s rebound in the 1990 World Cup after losing its starting goalkeeper to a broken leg 12 minutes into the second game . The backup , Sergio Goycochea , emerged as the King of the Shootout because of his uncanny knack for saving penalty kicks . Nothing needed to be manufactured to motivate the_Argentine team or fans during the prolonged World Cup qualifying . Argentina lurched through its South_American qualifying group with the sort of hubris that describes much of the team ' s approach to opponents , no matter how impressive . Argentina expects to win , usually without much effort but with a great show of style . Mowing_down the teams in its group and qualifying for the World Cup_finals was such a given that few Argentines discussed much more_than to which city their team might be assigned in the draw . Thus , the team ' s skin-of-the-teeth qualification campaign came , at first , as a shock to Argentina ' s fans . A familiar wave of fickleness overcame them , and throughout Argentina fans began to allow as how anyone could have seen this coming_with Coach Alfio Basile and that broken-down wreck of a team . Lost among the wreckage was that Argentina went_into qualifying with a 33-game international winning_streak , having won back-to-back South_American championships . All was forgotten when Colombia beat Argentina , 2-1 , in Barranquilla . Worse , Argentina played to a scoreless draw against Paraguay two games later , then finished with a 5-0 loss to Colombia in Buenos Aires . Argentina had the back-against-the-wall environment in which it thrives , so it should be no surprise that everything worked . First , Paraguay could manage only a tie with Peru on the same day that Argentina was being trounced by Colombia . That left Argentina tied for second with Paraguay in its qualifying group , but with the advantage in tiebreakers . That sent Argentina into a home-and-home playoff with a representative from the Oceania group , Australia , for the last place in the tournament . Basile knew the direness of the situation and he acted accordingly . He called_up Diego Maradona . The 33-year-old legend had been in recent years reduced to a role of team mascot , but Basile knew the boost Maradona would provide . The coach knew best and Maradona -- thanks to a crash diet and yet another stab at serious training -- did make a difference . The start wasn ' t encouraging : The teams played to a 1-1 draw_in Sydney . On Nov . 17 , 1993 , the final game of the two years of World Cup qualifying was played . Argentina had one more advantage -- playing_at home , in massive River Plate Stadium in Buenos Aires . Argentina outplayed Australia , but neither team could score . Another tie was too disastrous to contemplate . But disaster chose Australia . One of its defenders inadvertently knocked the ball into his own net , and Argentina won in a most unlikely manner : 1-0 , on an own goal . Argentina made_it , slinking in through the World Cup ' s back_door . In the relief of the victory , fans adopted an I-knew-it-all-along attitude , but Basile and the team remembered every slight . &quot; Argentina will be among the top four ( in the World Cup ) , and that will shut our critics ' mouths , &quot; Basile said . &quot; In this country , talk is cheap. &quot; So Argentina is in , drawn into Group D with Nigeria , Bulgaria and Greece with its base in Boston . The Argentines should have little trouble advancing from their group , except for an expected strong performance from Nigeria . In fact , despite its record in qualifying , Argentina is considered among the tournament ' s favorites . That might be because of Argentina ' s special relationship with the World Cup . Looking_at the country ' s international record , some would conclude the team was merely respectable . But Argentine players know when to be tourists and when to pay_attention . Their World Cup record proves it -- champions in 1978 and 1986 and runners-up in 1930 and 1990 . Argentina ' s play in the 1990 tournament in Italy did its reputation little good . Soccer experts are fond of referring to certain styles of play as &quot; cynical , &quot; by which they mean that teams abandon conventional tactics in favor of ruthless tackling and defensive protectionism . The championship game against West Germany was universally panned . Paul Gardner , in his book &quot; The Simplest Game , &quot; called it a &quot; truly awful , totally forgettable final. &quot; Four Argentine players were suspended for the final , including potent forward Claudio Caniggia . Maradona was barely fit because of a severely swollen ankle . Carlos Monzon became the first player in Cup history to be ejected from the final , and Argentina played_on with only 10 men . Another was lost to ejection soon after . When Germany scored on a penalty kick five minutes from the end , Argentina became the only team to fail to score in a final . The shards of that team remain . Maradona is back and his meaning to the team cannot be underestimated . The soap_opera that is Maradona has had him threatening to quit the team on many occasions , most recently when the mother of another player charged that Maradona had too_much influence on roster decisions . Caniggia , a quick and dangerous forward , has just come_off a 13-month suspension for cocaine use and appears to be back in form . Lest his return be trumpeted too loudly , however , Caniggia launched this preemptive strike : &quot; Don ' t start billing me as a savior. &quot; There are other question_marks . Veteran defender Oscar Ruggeri , who has played_on two World Cup teams , might have seen better days . Forward Gabriel Batistuta might have lost something when his Italian team , Fiorentina , was demoted to the second division . Goycochea , yesterday ' s hero , has lost his starting job with his Argentine club , River Plate . The midfield , long Argentina ' s strength , has had trouble communicating . Fernando Redondo and Diego Simeone have sent mixed signals , as have the forwards , Abel Balbo and Caniggia . They are all privately critical of the coach . In short , everything is perfect for Argentina . It should do_well .</TEXT>
