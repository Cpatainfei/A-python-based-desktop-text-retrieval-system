   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; AT RISK ; RANKED AS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH BY DISEASE , DIABETES STRIKES PEOPLE OF COLOR AT AN ALARMINGLY HIGH RATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> IT STARTED AS JUST A SMALL SORE ON HIS HEEL , nothing to worry too_much about . Twelve days later , the sore had worsened into a gangrene-infected ulcer . And soon after , diabetic Adan Monterrosa lay_in a hospital_bed , his left ankle and foot amputated . &quot; I had the thought that nothing would happen because it didn ' t bother me , &quot; Monterrosa , 46 , of South-Central , said as he sat in his hospital_bed on a recent afternoon at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in Downey . The loss of a limb is always horrible , but what makes Monterrosa ' s tale -- and the stories of uncounted thousands of other diabetics like him -- even more tragic is that it possibly could have been avoided . In Central Los Angeles , minimal access to medical_care and lack of awareness of the potentially serious consequences of unchecked diabetes is taking its toll on segments of the population already genetically predisposed to the disease . With regular checkups , doctors can often catch early symptoms of diabetes that patients may overlook and can inform them of how to curb its progression . But because many do not have the means to get preventive care or wait too long before they do , diabetes among people_of_color is often more devastating than it needs to be . Diabetes ranks high among illnesses affecting those in minority communities . Ranked as the third leading cause of death by disease , diabetes strikes people_of_color at an alarmingly high rate . Genetic makeup and environmental factors contribute to the extreme consequences of the disease among minorities , but poor diet , stress and sedentary lifestyles -- all correctable , to some degree -- exacerbate the problem . &quot; Historically , diabetes has been recognized as being in the majority population , with the insulin-dependent and kids , &quot; said Dr. Don Garcia of the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles ' Bell office and a member of a statewide steering_committee on treating diabetes at the local level . &quot; But there has been a rude awakening that diabetes has changed . It is no longer just among Europeans and juveniles , but it is an ethnic disease that has besieged communities of color. &quot; More_than 14 million people nationwide have diabetes , half of whom are undiagnosed and most of whom are minorities , according to the American Diabetes Assn . The federal Centers_for_Disease_Control estimates that Native_Americans have diabetes at a rate five times greater than whites . The rate among Latinos and Asian Americans is three times greater than whites , and African Americans have a rate twice as high as whites . In Los Angeles County , more_than 700 # 000 people are afflicted with diabetes , according to the diabetes association . Latinos suffer the highest incidence rate , with one in seven having diabetes . One in 10 Asian Americans , one in 13 African Americans and one in 19 whites have the disease . &quot; Diabetes is a dangerous disease because initially there are no symptoms . It ' s just something that creeps_up on you slowly , &quot; said Dr. Luz Medina of the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles . Diabetes prevents the body from making insulin , a hormone that converts the sugar in food into energy . Instead , the sugar collects in the blood and urine , stalls body functions and hardens arteries . Diabetes also contributes to increased health_problems among people afflicted with other illnesses , leading to a change of lifestyle or -- at the other extreme -- kidney or heart_failure , blindness , amputation and death . People_of_color , especially Latinos , are increasingly being found to have diabetes in their late 30s and 40s , an especially young age , health officials say . &quot; With Latinos being diagnosed with diabetes earlier , that means they ' re walking around with the disease longer and that puts them more at risk of suffering the complications of diabetes ) , &quot; said Marta Miyar of the American Diabetes Assn. ' s Los Angeles chapter . Monterrosa was diagnosed with diabetes 19 years ago at age 27 in his native El_Salvador . As far as Monterrosa knows , he is the only one in his family with diabetes . He never knew anyone else who had the disease until he came_to the United States 12 years ago . Although he carefully watched his diet and took his insulin daily , Monterrosa made only sporadic visits to his doctor and waited until he had severe problems before he sought treatment . By then , it was too late to save his leg . Most people wait until they have noticeable infections or feel too sick to go_to work before they see doctors , Medina said . If a person then ends_up with a diagnosis of diabetes , &quot; it ' s so far gone they have problems with their vision or have to have an amputation , &quot; she said . Though diabetes is a common disease , most people do not know very much about it . Some shrug_off the disease as a nuisance rather than a serious condition , and others equate it with an early demise . In reality , many diabetics live with the disease for years without severe complications . There are two types of diabetes : Type 1 , which requires insulin , and Type 2 , which is non-insulin-dependent . Health officials say research on diabetes has shown that 90 % of diabetics are non-insulin-dependent . Another 4 % develop gestational diabetes , which affects pregnant women . Though gestational diabetes goes_away when a baby is born , it is a warning signal that there could be a diagnosis of diabetes in the future . One result in gestational diabetes is giving_birth to an infant weighing about 10 pounds or with a deformed nervous_system or limbs , Medina said . Type 1 diabetes almost exclusively affects whites , who make_up about 5 % of all diabetics , and has a greater link to environmental_conditions -- such_as lifestyle -- than to genetics , said Dr. Francis Rhie , a specialist in Orange County . However , a significant number of people_of_color , primarily Latinos , are also afflicted with Type 1 diabetes , said Dr. Adira Zeidler of the Los Angeles County-USC Medical_Center . People can be diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes without any prior history of the disease in their family , said Zeidler , who is conducting a study among Latino diabetics to determine if Type 1 diabetes , which is insulin-dependent , can be prevented . Most Type 2 , non-insulin-dependent diabetics have a history of diabetes in their family , Zeidler said . Most minorities with diabetes are non-insulin-dependent and control the disease with a strict diet and glucose pills to help their bodies produce more insulin . &quot; A genetic susceptibility puts you at risk , &quot; said Dr. James Gavin , president of the American Diabetes Assn . &quot; But there are some strong environmental influences to give_rise to diabetes in urban_areas : obesity , diets high in simple sugar and fat , cigarette smoking , stress , low social economic status and a sedentary lifestyle. &quot; There is no clear understanding of why ethnic and racial groups are more predisposed to diabetes than whites , researchers say . Immigrants are being diagnosed much more frequently with diabetes as they assimilate to sedentary lifestyles and high-fat diets common in the United States . Latinos have high levels of diabetes because of their shared ancestry with Native_Americans , Gavin said . Korean Americans , Southeast Asian immigrants and Japanese Americans have the greatest prevalence of diabetes among Asian Americans -- about whom there is little statistical information on diabetes ' effects , said Julie Masumoto , a consultant who has done studies on diabetes . Diabetes is the eighth leading cause of death among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders , she said . For a number of Asian Americans and Latinos , cultural myths aggravate the problems and consequences of diabetes . Many believe diabetes can be cured with home remedies such_as herbal_teas , special potions or vitamins , or by eating cactus plants . And then there are those who believe that if there ' s no pain , there ' s no problem . African Americans and Korean Americans are prone to hypertension , and -- in addition to diabetes -- they are at risk of getting kidney_disease or diabetic retinopathy , which can lead to blindness . Diabetes is the leading cause of new blindness in the nation and is responsible_for 8 % of legal blindness , Gavin said . The combination of obesity and diabetes is a major problem among African Americans and Latinos . Women in these communities are especially susceptible , suffering from the highest death rates from diabetes related to obesity , health officials said . &quot; The more overweight you are the greater the likelihood of getting diabetes , especially if you ' re older , &quot; said Miyar . James Martin of the Community Health Foundation explained that treating diabetes in overweight people is hard because insulin cannot always affect their bodies properly because of the extra fat . Amputations are common among diabetics because the disease accelerates hardening of arteries and causes poor circulation , frequently affecting the feet , said Dr. Richard Chambers , an orthopedist and co-chief of the diabetic-amputation ward at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital . Eight years ago , Refugia Ostoich , 52 , went_to a doctor about a foot problem . She left his office diagnosed with diabetes . &quot; I didn ' t know much about diabetes . I had a sister and brother who had it , but didn ' t really know what it would do to me , &quot; said Ostoich , a retired nursing attendant who lives_in Mid-Wilshire . What it did was lead to the eventual amputation of three toes three years ago and a piece of bone in her foot last month . &quot; It started so small I didn ' t think anything of it at first . But in no time it just got_worse , &quot; said Ostoich . &quot; Luckily , I only lost a_few toes. &quot; Chambers and his colleague , Dr. Vikram Kamdar , said diabetics often lose feeling in their feet so they are more apt to ignore pain or think a problem such_as a sore or an infection will disappear . &quot; All of a sudden , patients will say they ' re really tired , are drinking and urinating a lot and don ' t know why , &quot; added Medina , of Community Health Foundation . &quot; Or else they ' ll come_in with some kind of an infection -- athlete ' s foot , jock_itch , recurring yeast infection . When we do tests , we find that a lot of these people are diabetic. &quot; Except for some extreme complications that require hospitalization , diabetics can monitor their sugar levels with special machines and can give themselves insulin . Seated at her desk in the accounting office of Yes Clothing Inc. on Washington Boulevard early one morning , Margarita Santinilla spread open her bright purple medicine pack complete with needles , insulin vials , alcohol pads and a pocket calculator-sized machine to test her blood_glucose level for her daily insulin injection . With a quick prick to a finger and a drop of blood on a small strip of paper , she tested her glucose level : 193 , a little high because of a late dinner the night before . Blood_sugar levels should be held at about 70 to 120 milligrams per cubic_centimeter of blood . Some diabetics on first diagnosis have had levels over 300 , which could result in diabetic coma . &quot; Whoa , well I ' ll need to watch it a little today , &quot; Santinilla , 42 , said as she lifted her blouse , grabbed a fleshy part of her stomach and injected herself with the insulin . &quot; It ' s a really tiny needle and it doesn ' t really hurt , &quot; she said matter-of-factly . &quot; If I ' m in a restaurant , I ' ll just do_it right there at the table , &quot; Santinilla said , describing her twice-daily insulin injections . Living with diabetes has not been a barrier , said Santinilla , who teaches bilingual courses on dealing with diabetes . Nor has it stopped Rita Bramasco , 38 , of South-Central from caring for her six children and volunteering at her church . Bramasco takes four Glucotrol pills a day and watches her diet to control her diabetes . Santinilla , who has a combination of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes , takes small amounts of insulin and is hoping to start taking pills instead of the injections . &quot; What ' s important is controlling your diet and staying_away_from fatty foods , &quot; said Santinilla . Judy Hancock , a registered dietitian and diabetes educator at the USC Ambulatory Health_Care Center , said diabetics should cut_down on the portions of food they eat or make other substitutions . For example , Asian Americans who are susceptible to diabetes should cut_down on the amount of rice they eat or increase the amount of insulin they take . &quot; This is a disease that is controlled , not curable , &quot; Hancock pointed_out . &quot; But if it ' s controlled correctly , you can live a very , very long life. &quot; Diabetes at a Glance Little is known in ethnic communities about a condition that is the third-largest cause of death by disease in the country and is responsible_for thousands of deaths among minorities . * What Is Diabetes ? The term diabetes encompasses two diseases : Type 1 , in which the body does not produce insulin , and Type 2 , in which the body has a normal or even above-normal production of insulin but does not respond to it efficiently . Insulin , a hormone produced by the pancreas , enables the body to use and store glucose , which is a term that applies to a wide range of natural sugars occurring in blood , honey , fruits and other parts of plants . It is the principal source of energy for humans and other organisms . * How the Pancreas Works Tiny cell clusters called islets of Langerhans secrete insulin . Islets comprise four types of cells . The most common , beta cells , are the insulin factories . The other cells secrete hormones that regulate the body ' s insulin use . * Cause of Diabetes The cause is unknown . Researchers suspect that certain people inherit a tendency for developing Type 2 diabetes . Other factors such_as obesity or stress may come_into play . In Type 1 diabetes , some researchers believe that hereditary traits can trigger the body ' s immune_system during illness to mistakenly attack insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas . * Symptoms A major symptom is excessive urination . Some other indications are chronic thirst , loss of appetite and strength , nausea and vomiting . If left untreated , the disease can cause blindness , kidney_failure , strokes , heart_failure , coma and death . * Treatments Carefully maintained diets are essential . Type 1 diabetics must have daily doses of insulin by injection . When the effect of insulin is so great that the level of blood_sugar drops sharply , insulin_shock occurs . A diabetic having this reaction may become weak or even unconscious . Many diabetics carry foods rich_in sugar just in case . Primary treatment for Type 2 diabetes is a diet low in calories , but sometimes it is necessary to take insulin or oral drugs that reduce the level of blood_glucose . * Who Is at Risk The disease is common in some families , but many diabetics have no known family history of the disease . Some minorities are at extremely high risk . One in 10 Latinos are affected . Among African Americans , the risk is 1 in 14 . In the general population , the risk is 1 in 20 . Latinos develop diabetes at a younger age . The disease in African Americans is more prevalent among older_women , the elderly , people living alone and in families with low income . African Americans have a higher tendency toward obesity , a strong risk factor_in Type 2 diabetes . * Ethnic Groups and Diabetes In Los Angeles County , nearly three-quarters of a_million people have diabetes . The following is a breakdown among ethnic_groups : 04 # 18 , 12 # 14 , 09 * NUMBER ETHNIC GROUP POPULATION WITH DISEASE PERCENT Native American 29 # 159 3 # 674 12.6 % Latino 3 # 351 , 242 361 # 934 10.8 % Asian 907 # 810 98 # 043 10.8 % African American 934 # 776 65 # 434 7 % Anglo 3 # 618 , 850 188 # 180 5.2 % Other 21 # 327 1 # 109 5.2 % TOTAL 8 # 863 , 164 718 # 374 8.1 % * People with Type 1 diabetes account_for 10 % of this figure SOURCE : American Diabetes Assn . Information based on adjusted 1990 census figures . On the Cover Adan Monterossa , 46 , in his hospital_room at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in Downey . Monterossa , a diabetic , had his left foot and ankle amputated after a small sore on his heel deteriorated into a gangrene-infected ulcer . Many diabetics such_as Monterossa wait to seek treatment until it is too late to save them from severe consequences . But with early diagnosis and proper care , the disease is manageable .</TEXT>
