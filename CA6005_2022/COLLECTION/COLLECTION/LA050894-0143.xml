   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : GLOBAL TRADERS REMIND U.S. WHERE THE BUCK STOPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Led by the United States , a global phalanx of 16 nations from Japan to Portugal intervened in currency markets last week to uphold the value of the dollar against speculation by foreign_exchange traders . Right away you know there ' s a crisis when Portugal , 10 million people and an economy one-tenth the size of the U.S. gross_domestic_product , is brought_in to defend the dollar . There was reason for concern . The dollar ' s value , which had been declining since January against the Japanese yen and German mark , threatened to accelerate downward ; foreign investors were reducing their purchases of U.S. bonds and stocks ; U.S. long-term interest_rates had taken a worrisome turn upward again , imperiling housing and the economy ' s expansion . And those were only fever symptoms of the underlying illness , which was worldwide fear that the United States would withdraw from its economic responsibilities to other nations . Signs were there . The Clinton_Administration has been talking_down the dollar to benefit U.S. exports and hurt Japanese imports since the day it took_office . As the dollar has moved from being worth 124 yen to worth about 100 , Japanese manufacturers of cars and copying machines have seen costs on products for the U.S. market go_up by 19.3 % . That means a Toyota Camry that could be sold profitably for $ 16 # 000 more_than a year ago would now carry a $ 19 # 000 price_tag -- which gives an advantage to the Ford Taurus , unless Ford also hikes prices to increase its profits , which it has been doing . Foreign investors also noted White_House and congressional resistance to the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s raising of interest_rates to stem incipient inflation . And they concluded that Clinton would tolerate inflation if it made_for more employment and wage hikes in the U.S. economy . Finally , foreigners were alarmed by statements in Congress that the United States might not even live_up_to its commitment to the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . So foreign investors put less money into Treasury_bonds and other U.S. investments -- even though the strong economy argued for more investment . And as there was less demand for U.S. dollars , the value of the greenback declined against other currencies . Simply put , the foreigners sent a message to Washington that if the United States tries to act alone in the world , it will pay a price . Foreign investment is needed to finance the U.S. current_account deficit , which will run about $ 100 billion this year , says Washington economist John Mueller . that ' s the sum of the U.S. trade_deficit in merchandise , its trade surplus in_services , and investment flows into and out of U.S. and foreign pension and mutual_funds . If foreign money doesn ' t come_in , scarce U.S. savings must finance the economy ' s expansion , which in_effect would mean slower growth or that some borrowers , mainly small business , would be starved for capital . It ' s an interdependent world today , one in which $ 800 billion worth of currencies are traded daily on markets from New York to Tokyo to London . Governments are ruled by this trading , notes Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution , who has a book coming_out , &quot; Transformation of the World Economy , 1980-1993. &quot; In 1980 , international markets dumped the_French franc and forced France ' s new president , Francois Mitterrand , to change his socialist policies . Now those markets are sending messages to Clinton , and the issue is critical because of the dollar ' s central role in economic activities worldwide . We benefit from the dollar ' s status . The United States can run trade and budget_deficits and no International Monetary Fund interferes or lectures . But markets always have something to say . The current system of floating exchange_rates began in 1971 when the U.S. attempt to finance the Vietnam_War and a consumer economy at_home strained the fixed exchange_rate system . President Richard Nixon abandoned fixed rates , and since then currency values have been guided by global trading . That hasn ' t freed us from the concerns of foreigners . In 1978 , President Jimmy_Carter was forced to issue U.S. bonds denominated in yen because Japanese lenders feared U.S. inflation , notes Kenneth McCarthy , head of Economic Intelligence Co. , a New York consulting firm . In 1987 , a dispute with Germany over the dollar and interest_rates set_off a global stock_market crash . Will markets crash this time ? Probably not , even though Friday ' s decline in U.S. stocks was scary . The U.S. economy is stronger than it has been in decades ; fears of inflation are somewhat overblown . But some business people see signs . John Rutledge , an investment_banker and director of several companies , reports that land and building values in Denver have risen 30 % in the last year and that land prices are rising in the Southeast and Texas . Foreigners see such signs too , and they worry when Clinton_Administration officials call_for easy_money policies . &quot; They fear losing money in U.S. bonds , &quot; says Albert M . Wojnilower , senior economist of CS First Boston . &quot; It ' s their pension_fund you ' re playing with too. &quot; The result is a crisis , staved_off temporarily by 16 countries madly swapping billions in dollars , marks and yen . &quot; There will be more crises ; the dollar will be weak through the summer , &quot; predicts Carl Weinberg , an economist at New York University . If that sounds to you like a wasteful way to conduct the world ' s economic affairs , many experts agree . The latest debacle will increase calls_for a more stable exchange system . Economist Judy Shelton , author of a new book , &quot; Money Meltdown , &quot; suggests that the United States call a new international monetary conference , comparable_to the Bretton Woods talks at the end of World_War_II . Shelton suggests backing the dollar with gold ; Rutledge and others suggest backing with U.S. real_estate -- the $ 9.5-trillion net worth of all U.S. land , houses , buildings and factories . But more important than technicalities is that &quot; the U.S. must take the lead , &quot; says Shelton , of Stanford_University ' s Hoover Institution . She hits the nail on the head . Because the real message the currency markets sent to Washington last week was a cry_for U.S. leadership . Surely if Portugal rushing to defend the dollar proves anything it ' s that the world is interdependent and sees the United States as its leader . &quot; We must all hang_together or assuredly we shall hang separately , &quot; Benjamin Franklin said in 1776 . True then of his young nation , true today of the world .</TEXT>
