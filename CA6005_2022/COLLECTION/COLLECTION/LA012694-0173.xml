   <HEADLINE> THE STATE OF THE UNION ; CLINTON TEXT : THERE ' S MUCH WORK AHEAD , HE SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here is the text of President Clinton ' s State of the Union address Tuesday night : Mr. Speaker , Mr. President , members of the 103rd Congress , my fellow Americans . I am not sure what speech is in the TelePrompTer tonight , but I hope we can talk_about the state of the Union . I ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over this chamber with such force and grace . Tip O ' Neill liked to call himself &quot; A Man of the House , &quot; and he surely was that . But even more , he was a man of the people , a bricklayer ' s son who helped to build the great American middle_class . Tip O ' Neill never forgot who he was , where he came from or who sent him here . Tonight , he ' s smiling down on us for the first time from the Lord ' s gallery . But in his honor , may we too also remember who we are , where we come from and who sent us here . If we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if we simply give ordinary people equal_opportunity , quality education and a fair shot at the American_Dream , they will do extraordinary things . We gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all nations are tested . Our American heritage has always been to master such change , to use it to expand opportunity at_home and our leadership abroad . But for too long and in too many ways , that heritage was abandoned , and our country drifted . Dream Slipping Away For 30 years family life in America has been breaking_down . For 20 years the wages of working people have been stagnant or declining . For the 12 years of trickle-down economics , we built a false prosperity on a hollow base as our national_debt quadrupled . From 1989 to 1992 , we experienced the slowest growth in a half-century . For too many families , even when both parents were working , the American_Dream has been slipping_away . In 1992 the American people demanded that we change . One year ago , I asked all_of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our country . Well , we did . We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform . And I want to thank every one of you here who heard the American people , who broke gridlock , who gave them the most successful teamwork between a President and a Congress in 30 years . This Congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a_trillion dollars , cut spending and raised income_taxes on only the wealthiest Americans . This Congress produced tax relief for millions of low-income workers to reward work over welfare . It produced NAFTA . It produced the Brady bill , now the Brady law . And thank_you , Jim Brady , for being here , and God bless you , Sarah . This Congress produced tax cuts_to reduce the taxes of nine out of 10 small businesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs . It produced more research and treatment for AIDS , more childhood immunizations , more support for women ' s health research , more affordable college loans for the middle_class , a new national service_program for those who want to give something back to their country and their communities for higher education , a dramatic increase in high-tech investments to move us from a defense to a domestic high-tech economy . This Congress produced a new law -- the motor voter bill -- to help millions of people register to vote . It produced family and medical leave -- all passed , all signed into law , with not one single veto . These accomplishments were all commitments I made when I sought this office , and in fairness , they all had to be passed_by you in this Congress . But I am persuaded that the real credit belongs_to the people who sent us here , who pay our salaries , who hold our feet to the fire . But what we do here is really beginning to change lives . Let me just give you one example . I will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just one father I met early one Sunday morning in the White_House . It was unusual to see a family there touring early Sunday morning , but he had his wife and his three children there , one of them in a wheelchair . And I came_up , and after we had our picture taken and had a little visit , I was walking_off , and that man grabbed me by the arm and he said : &quot; Mr. President , let me tell you something . My little_girl here is desperately ill . She ' s probably not going_to make_it . &quot; But because of the family leave law , I was able to take_time_off to spend with her , the most important time I ever spent in my life , without losing my job and hurting the rest of my family . It means more to me than I will ever be able to say . Don ' t you people up here ever think what you do doesn ' t make a difference . It does. &quot; Work Has Just Begun Though we are making a difference , our work has just begun . Many Americans still haven ' t felt the impact of what we ' ve done . The recovery still hasn ' t touched every community or created enough jobs . Incomes are still stagnant . There ' s still too_much violence and not enough hope in too many places . Abroad , the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very difficult times and look_to us for leadership . And so tonight , let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal , to create more and better jobs , to guarantee health security for all , to reward welfare -- work over welfare -- to promote democracy abroad and to begin to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs to renew our own American community . Last year , we began to put our house in_order by tackling the budget_deficit that was driving us toward bankruptcy . We cut $ 255 billion in spending , including entitlements , in over 340 separate budget items . We froze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers . Led by the vice_president , we ' ve launched a campaign to reinvent government . We ' ve cut staff , cut perks , even trimmed the fleet of federal limousines . After years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but whose actions expanded it , we will actually reduce it by 252 # 000 people over the next five years . By the time we have finished , the federal bureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years . Because the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax cuts_in the 1980s , we did ask the wealthiest Americans to pay more to reduce the deficit . So on April 15 , the American people will discover the truth about what we did last year on taxes . Only the top one -- yes , listen -- the top 1.2 % of Americans , as I said all along , will face higher income_tax rates . Let me repeat , only the wealthiest 1.2 % of Americans will face higher income_tax rates and no one else will , and that is the truth . Of course , there were , as there always are in politics , naysayers who said this plan would n ' t work , but they were wrong . When I became President , the experts predicted that next year ' s deficit would be $ 300 billion , but because we acted , those same people now say the deficit ' s going_to be under $ 180 billion , 40 % lower than was previously predicted . Our economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation_rate and the lowest interest_rates in 20 years , and because those interest_rates are down , business investment and equipment is growing at seven times the rate of the previous four years . Auto sales are way up , home sales at a record high . Millions of Americans have refinanced their homes and our economy has produced 1.6 million private-sector jobs in 1993 , more_than were created in the previous four years combined . The people who supported this economic plan should be proud_of its early results -- proud . But everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge that there is more to do . Next month I will send you one of the toughest budgets ever presented to Congress . It will cut spending in more_than 300 programs , eliminate 100 domestic programs , and reform the way in which government buys goods and services . This year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard spending ceilings we have set . We must do_it . We have proved we can bring the deficit down without choking_off recovery , without punishing seniors or the middle_class , and without putting our national security at risk . If you will stick_with this plan , we will post three consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since Harry Truman lived_in the White_House . And once again , the buck stops here . Our economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around the world . Once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our competitive edge , the world echoed with the sound of falling trade_barriers . In one year , with NAFTA , with GATT , with our efforts in Asia and the national export strategy , we did more to open world markets to American products than at any time in the last two generations . That means more jobs and rising living standards for the American people , low deficits , low inflation , low interest_rates , low trade_barriers and high investments . These are the building_blocks of our recovery . But if we want to take full advantage of the opportunities before us in the global economy , you all know we must do more . As we reduce defense spending , I ask Congress to invest more in the technologies of tomorrow . Defense conversion will keep us strong militarily and create jobs for our people here at_home . As we protect our environment , we must invest in the environmental technologies of the future which will create jobs . This year we will fight for a revitalized Clean Water Act and a Safe Drinking Water Act and a reformed Superfund program . And the vice_president is right : We must also work with the private sector to connect every classroom , every clinic , every library , every hospital in America into a national information superhighway by the year 2000 . Think_of it . Instant access to information will increase productivity . It will help to educate our children . It will provide better medical_care . It will create jobs . And I call_on the Congress to pass legislation to establish that information superhighway this year . As we expand opportunity and create jobs , no one can be left_out . We must continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil_rights laws , because America will never be complete in its renewal until everyone shares_in its bounty . But we all know , too , we can do all these things -- put our economic house in_order , expand world trade , target the jobs of the future , guarantee equal_opportunity . But if we ' re honest , we ' ll all admit that this strategy still cannot work unless we also give our people the education , training and skills they need to seize the opportunities of tomorrow . We must set tough , world-class academic and occupational standards for all our children and give our teachers and students the tools they need to meet them . Our Goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to experiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run_by private_corporations or having more public_school choice , to do whatever they wish to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard : Are our children learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy ? Goals 2000 links world-class standards to grass-roots reforms , and I hope Congress will pass it without delay . Our school-to-work initiative will for the first time link school to the world of work , providing at least one year of apprenticeship beyond high_school . After all , most of the people we ' re counting_on to build our economic future won ' t graduate from college . It ' s time to stop ignoring them and start empowering them . We must literally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new re-employment system . The old unemployment system just sort of kept you going while you waited for your old job to come_back . We ' ve got_to have a new system to move people into new and better jobs because most of those old jobs just don ' t come_back . And we know that the only way to have real job security in the future , to get a good job with a growing income , is to have real skills and the ability to learn new ones . So we ' ve got_to streamline today ' s patchwork of training_programs and make them a source of new skill for our people who lose their jobs . Re-employment , not unemployment , must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal . I urge you to pass it in this session of Congress . And just as we must transform our unemployment system , so must we also revolutionize our welfare system . It doesn ' t work ; it defies our values as a nation . If we value work , we can ' t justify a system that makes welfare more attractive than work if people are worried about losing their health_care . If we value responsibility , we can ' t ignore the $ 34 billion in child_support absent parents ought to be paying to millions of parents who are taking_care of their children . If we value strong families , we can ' t perpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay_together . Can you believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the government for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a grandparent ? that ' s not just bad policy , it ' s wrong and we ought to change it . I worked_on this problem for years before I became President , with other governors and with members of Congress in both parties and with the previous Administration of another party . I worked_on it with people who were_on welfare , lots of them . And I want to say something to everybody here who cares about this issue : The people who most want to change this system are the people who are dependent_on it . They want to get_off welfare ; they want to go_back to work ; they want to do right by their kids . I once had a hearing when I was a governor and I brought_in people on welfare from all_over America who had found their way to work , and a woman from my state who testified was asked this question : What ' s the best thing about being off welfare and in a job ? And without blinking an eye , she looked_at 40 governors and she said : &quot; When my boy goes_to school and they say , ' What does your mother do for a living ? ' he can give an answer. &quot; These people want a better system and we ought to give it to them . Last year , we began this . We gave the states more power to innovate because we know that a lot of great ideas come from outside Washington and many states are already using it . Then this Congress took a dramatic step . Instead of taxing people with modest incomes into poverty , we helped them to work their way_out of poverty by dramatically increasing the earned income_tax credit . It will lift 15 million working families out of poverty , rewarding work over welfare , making_it possible for people to be successful workers and successful parents . Now that ' s real welfare reform . But there is more to be done . This spring I will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that builds_on the Family Support Act of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and responsibility . We will say to teen-agers : If you have a child out of wedlock , we ' ll no longer give you a check to set_up a separate household , we want families to stay_together . Say to absent parents who aren ' t paying their child_support : If you ' re not providing_for your children , we ' ll garnish your wages , suspend your license , track you across state_lines and , if necessary , make some of you work off what you owe . People who bring children into this world cannot and must_not walk away from them . But to all those who depend_on welfare , we should offer ultimately a simple compact . We will provide the support , the job training , the child_care you need for up_to two years , but after that anyone who can work , must , in the private sector wherever possible , in community service if necessary . that ' s the only way we ' ll ever make welfare what it ought to be : a second chance , not a way_of_life . I know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at_the_same_time we tackle health_care . But let me point_out , I think it is inevitable and imperative . It is estimated that 1 million people are_on welfare today because it ' s the only way they can get health_care coverage for their children . Those who choose to leave welfare for jobs without health benefits , and many entry-level jobs don ' t have health benefits , find themselves in the incredible position of paying taxes that help to pay_for health_care coverage for those who made the other choice , to stay_on welfare . No wonder people leave work and go_back to welfare -- to get health_care coverage . We ' ve got_to solve the health_care problem to have real welfare reform . So this year we will make history by reforming the health_care system . And I would say to you , all_of you , my fellow public_servants , this is another issue where the people are way ahead of the politicians . That may_not be popular_with either party , but it happens to be the truth . You know , the First_Lady has received now almost a_million letters from people all across America and from all walks_of_life . I ' d like to share just one of them with you . Health Cost Burden Richard Anderson of Reno , Nev. , lost his job and , with it , his health_insurance . Two weeks later , his wife , Judy , suffered a cerebral_aneurysm . He rushed her to the hospital , where she stayed in intensive care_for 21 days . The Andersons ' bills were over $ 120 # 000 . Although Judy recovered and Richard went_back to work_at $ 8 an hour , the bills were too_much for them and they were literally forced into bankruptcy . &quot; Mrs . Clinton , &quot; he wrote to Hillary , &quot; no one in the United States of America should have to lose everything they ' ve worked for all their lives because they were unfortunate enough to become ill. &quot; It was to help the Richard and Judy Andersons of America that the First_Lady and so many others have worked so hard and so_long on this health_care reform issue . We owe them our thanks and our action . I know there are people here who say there ' s no health_care crisis . Tell it to Richard and Judy Anderson . Tell it to the 58 million Americans who have no coverage at all for some time each year . Tell it to the 81 million Americans with those pre-existing conditions ; those folks are paying more or they can ' t get insurance at all or they can ' t ever change their jobs because they or someone in their family has one of those pre-existing conditions . Tell it to the small businesses burdened by skyrocketing costs of insurance . Most small businesses cover their employers , and they pay on average 35 % more in premiums than big businesses or government . Or tell it to the 76 % of insured Americans , three out of four whose policies have lifetime limits , and that means they can find themselves without any coverage at all just when they need it the most . So , if any of you believe there ' s no crisis , you tell it to those people , because I can ' t . There are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on people ' s lives , but all you have to do is go_out and listen to them . Just go talk to them anywhere , in any congressional_district in this country . They ' re Republicans and Democrats and independents . It doesn ' t have a lick to do with party . They think we don ' t get_it , and it ' s time we show that we do get_it . From the day we began , our health_care initiative has been designed to strengthen what is good about our health_care system -- the world ' s best health_care professionals , cutting edge research , and wonderful research institutions , Medicare for older Americans . None of this -- none of it should be put at risk . But we ' re paying more and more money for less and less care . Every year , fewer and fewer Americans even get_to choose their doctors . Every year , doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork and less time with patients because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system has become . This system is riddled with inefficiency , with abuse , with fraud , and everybody knows it . In today ' s health_care system , insurance_companies call the shots . They pick whom they cover and how they cover them . They can cut_off your benefits when you need your coverage the most . They are in_charge . What does_it mean ? It means every night millions of well-insured Americans go_to_bed just an illness , an accident or a pink_slip away from having no coverage or financial ruin . It means every morning millions of Americans go_to work without any health_insurance at all -- something the workers in no other advanced country in the world do . It means that every year more and more hard-working people are told to pick a new doctor because their boss has had to pick a new plan . And countless others turn_down better jobs because they know , if they take the better job , they ' ll lose their health_insurance . can ' t Let System Drift If we just let the health_care system continue to drift , our country will have people with less care , fewer choices and higher bills . Now , our approach protects the quality of care and people ' s choices . It builds_on what works today in the private sector , to expand employer-based coverage , to guarantee private insurance for every American . And I might say , employer-based private insurance for every American was proposed 20 years ago by President Richard Nixon to the United States Congress . It was a good idea then , and it ' s a better idea today . Why do we want guaranteed private insurance ? Because right now , nine out of 10 people who have insurance get_it through their employers -- and that should continue . And if your employer is providing good benefits at reasonable prices , that should continue too . And that ought to make the Congress and the President feel better . Our goal is health_insurance everybody can depend_on -- comprehensive benefits that cover preventive care and prescription_drugs , health premiums that don ' t just explode when you get sick or you get older , the power -- no matter how small your business is -- to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rates that governments and big business get today , one simple form for people who are_sick and , most of all , the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor . Our approach protects older Americans . Every plan before the Congress proposes to slow the growth of Medicare . The difference is this . We believe those savings should be used to improve health_care for senior_citizens . Medicare must be protected , and it should cover prescription_drugs , and we should take the first_steps in covering long-term care . To those who would cut Medicare without protecting seniors , I say the solution to today ' s squeeze on middle-class working people ' s health_care is not to put the squeeze on middle-class retired people ' s health_care . We can do_better than that . When it ' s all said and done , it ' s pretty simple to me . Insurance ought to mean what it used to mean : You pay a fair price for security , and when you get sick , health_care is always there -- no matter what . Along with the guarantee of health security , we all have to admit , too , there must be more responsibility on the part of all_of us in how we use this system . People have to take their kids to get immunized . We should all take_advantage of preventive care . We must all work together to stop the violence that explodes our emergency_rooms . We have to practice better health habits , and we can ' t abuse the system . Everybody Can Contribute And those who don ' t have insurance under our approach will get coverage , but they will have to pay something for it too . The minority of businesses that provide no insurance at all , and in so doing shift the cost of the care of their employees to others , should contribute something . People who smoke should pay more for a pack of cigarettes . Everybody can contribute something if we want to solve the health_care crisis . There can ' t be anymore something for nothing . It will not be easy , but it can be done . Now , in the coming months I hope very much to work with both Democrats and Republicans to reform a health_care system by using the market to bring_down costs and to achieve lasting health security . But if you look_at history , we see that for 60 years this country has tried to reform health_care . President Roosevelt tried , President Truman tried , President Nixon tried , President Carter tried . Every time the special_interests were powerful enough to defeat them , but not this time . I know that facing_up to these interests will require courage . It will raise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how lobbyists yield their influence . The work of change , frankly , will never get any easier until we limit the influence of well-financed interests who profit from this current system . So I also must now call_on you to finish the job both houses began last year , by passing tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year . You know , my fellow Americans , this is really a test for all_of us . The American people provide those of us in government service with terrific health_care benefits at reasonable costs . We have health_care that ' s always there . I think we need to give every hard-working , taxpaying American the same health_care security they have already given to us . I want to make this very clear : I am open , as I have said repeatedly , to the best ideas of concerned members of both parties . I have no special brief for any specific approach , even in our own bill , except this : If you send me legislation that does not guarantee every American private health_insurance that can never be taken_away , you will force me to take this pen , veto the legislation , and we ' ll come right back here and start all_over again . But I don ' t think that ' s going_to happen . I think we ' re ready to act now . I believe that you ' re ready to act now . And if you ' re ready to guarantee every American the same health_care that you have , health_care that can never be taken_away -- now -- not next year or the year after . Now is the time to stand with the people who sent us here . Now . As we take these steps together to renew our strength at_home , we cannot turn_away from our obligations to renew our leadership abroad . This is a promising moment . Because of the agreements we have reached this year , last year , Russia ' s strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at the United States . Nor will we point ours at them . Instead of building weapons in space , Russian scientists will help us to build the international space_station . And , of course , there are still dangers in the world : rampant arms proliferation , bitter regional conflicts , ethnic and nationalist tensions in many new democracies , severe environmental degradation the world over and fanatics who seek to cripple the world ' s cities with terror . As the world ' s greatest_power , we must therefore maintain our defenses and our responsibilities . This year we secured indictments against terrorists and sanctions against those who harbor them . We worked to promote environmentally sustainable economic_growth . We achieved agreements with Ukraine , with Belarus , with Kazakhstan , to eliminate completely their nuclear arsenals . We are working to achieve a Korean_Peninsula free_of nuclear_weapons . We will seek early ratification of the treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide . And earlier today we joined with over 30 nations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear testing . But nothing -- nothing -- is more important to our security than our nation ' s armed forces . We honor their contributions , including those who are carrying_out the longest humanitarian airlift in history in Bosnia -- those who will complete their mission in Somalia this year and their brave comrades who gave their lives there . Our forces are the finest military our nation has ever had , and I have pledged that as long as I am President they will remain the best-equipped , the best-trained and the best-prepared fighting force on the face of the Earth . Last year , I proposed a defense plan that maintains our post-Cold War security at a lower cost . This year , many people urged me to cut our defense spending further to pay_for other government programs . I said no . The budget I send to Congress draws_the_line against further defense cuts . It protects the readiness and quality of our forces . Ultimately , the best strategy is to do that . We must_not cut defense further . I hope the Congress without regard_to party will support that position . Ultimately , the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere . Democracies don ' t attack each other . They make better trading partners and partners in diplomacy . That is why we have supported , you and I , the democratic reformers in Russia and in the other states of the former Soviet Bloc . I applaud the bipartisan support this Congress provided last year for our initiatives to help Russia , Ukraine and the other states through their epic transformations . Our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for our fundamental interest and values . We will continue to urge Russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms , and we will seek to cooperate with Russia to solve regional problems while insisting that , if Russian troops operate in neighboring states , they do so only when those states agree to their presence and in strict accord with international standards . But we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures , and they must chart their own futures , how much more secure and more prosperous our own people will be if democratic and market reform succeed all across the former Communist Bloc . Our policy has been to support that move , and that has been the policy of the Congress . We should continue it . That is why I went_to Europe earlier this month , to work with our European partners to help to integrate all_the former Communist countries into a Europe that has the possibility of becoming unified for the first time in its entire history , its entire history , based on the simple commitments of all nations in Europe to democracy , to free markets , and to respect for existing borders . Partnership For Peace With our allies , we have created a partnership for peace that invites states from the former Soviet Bloc and other non-NATO members to work with NATO in military cooperation . When I met with Central Europe ' s leaders , including Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel , men who put their lives on the line for freedom , I told them that the security of their region is important to our country ' s security . This year , we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human_rights and sustainable development all around the world . We will ask Congress to ratify the new GATT accord , we will continue standing by South_Africa as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult transition to democracy . We will convene a summit of the Western_Hemisphere ' s democratic leaders from Canada to the tip of South_America . And we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in Haiti . And as we build a more constructive relationship with China , we must continue to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nation ' s human_rights record . We will also work for new progress toward the Middle_East peace . Last year the world watched Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat at the White_House when they had their historic handshake of reconciliation . But there is a long , hard road ahead . And on that road , I am determined that I and our Administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for all_the peoples of the region . Now , there are some in our country who argue that with the Cold_War , America should turn its back on the rest of the world . Many around the world were afraid we would do just that . But I took this office on a pledge that had no partisan tinge to keep our nation secure by remaining engaged in the rest of the world . And this year , because of our work together , enacting NAFTA , keeping our military strong and prepared , supporting democracy abroad , we have reaffirmed America ' s leadership , America ' s engagement , and as a result , the American people are more secure than they were before . But while Americans are more secure from threats abroad , I think we all know that in many ways we are less secure from threats here at_home . Everyday the national peace is shattered by crime . In Petaluma , Calif. , an innocent slumber_party gives_way to agonizing tragedy for the family of Polly Klaas . An ordinary train ride_on Long_Island ends in a hail of nine-millimeter rounds . A tourist in Florida is nearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black . Right here in our nation ' s capital , a brave young_man named Jason White , a policeman , the son and grandson of policemen , is ruthlessly gunned_down . Violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society , limiting personal freedom and fraying the ties that bind us . The crime bill before Congress gives you a chance to do something about it , a chance to be tough and smart . What does that mean ? Let me begin by saying I care a lot about this issue . Many years ago , when I started_out in public life , I was the attorney_general of my state . I served as a governor for a dozen years . I know what it ' s like to sign laws increasing penalties , to build more prison_cells , to carry_out the death_penalty . I understand this issue and it is not a simple thing . First , we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a small percentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when they are_on parole . Now , those who commit crimes should be punished , and those who commit repeated violent crimes should be told , when you commit a third violent crime , you will be put_away and put_away for good -- three strikes and you are out . Second , we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime , beginning with more police_officers and more community policing . We know right now that police who work the streets , know the folks , have the respect of the neighborhood kids , focus_on high-crime areas , we know that they are more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminals . Look_at the experience of Houston , where the crime_rate dropped 17 % in one year when that approach was taken . Here tonight is one of those community policemen , a brave , young detective , Kevin Jett , whose beat is eight square_blocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in New York . Every day he restores some sanity and safety , and a sense of_values and connection to the people whose lives he protects . I ' d like to ask him to stand_up and be recognized tonight . You will be given a chance to give the children of this country , the law-abiding working people of this country , and don ' t forget , in the toughest neighborhoods in this country , in the highest crime neighborhoods in this country , the vast majority of people get_up every day and obey the law , pay their taxes , do their best to raise their kids . They deserve people like Kevin Jett , and you ' re going to be given the chance to give the American people another 100 # 000 of them , well trained , and I urge you to do_it . You have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps to encourage young people to get an education and pay it off by serving as police_officers , which encourages retiring military_personnel to move_into police_forces -- and enormous resources for our country , one which has safe-schools provisions which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging bullets . These are important things . The third thing we have to do is to build_on the Brady bill -- the Brady law to take further steps -- to take further steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals . Now , I want to say something about this issue . Hunters must always be free to hunt , law-abiding adults should always be free to own guns and protect their homes . I respect that part of our culture . I grew_up in it . But I want to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to join us in this campaign to reduce gun violence . I say to you , I know you didn ' t create this problem , but we need your help to solve it . There is no sporting purpose on Earth that should stop the United States Congress from banishing assault weapons that outgun police and cut_down children . Fourth , we must remember that drugs are a factor_in an enormous percentage of crimes . Recent studies indicate , sadly , that drug use is_on the rise again among our young people . The crime bill contains -- all_the crime bills contain -- more money for drug treatment , for criminal addicts , and boot camps for youthful offenders that include incentives to get_off drugs and to stay off drugs . Our Administration ' s budget , with all its cuts , contains a large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education . You must pass them both . We need them desperately . My fellow Americans , the problem of violence is an un-American problem . It has no partisan or philosophical element . Therefore , I urge you find ways as quickly as possible to set_aside partisan differences and pass a strong , smart , tough crime bill . But further , I urge you to consider this : As you demand tougher penalties for those who choose violence , let us also remember how we came_to this sad point . In our toughest neighborhoods , on our meanest streets , in our poorest rural_areas , we have seen a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community , family and work , the heart and soul of civilized society . This has created a vast vacuum which has been filled by violence and drugs and gangs . So I ask you to remember that even as we say no to crime , we must give people , especially our young people , something to say yes to . Many of our initiatives , from job training to welfare reform to health_care to national service will help to rebuild distressed communities , to strengthen families , to provide work , but more needs to be done . that ' s what our community empowerment agenda is all about -- challenging businesses to provide more investment through empowerment zones , ensuring banks will make loans in the same communities their deposits come from , passing legislation to unleash the power of capital through community development banks to create jobs , opportunity and hope where they ' re needed most . But I think you know that to really solve this problem , we ' ll all have to put our heads together , leave our ideological armor aside , and find some new ideas to do even more . And let ' s be honest , we all know something else too . Our problems go way beyond the reach of government . They ' re rooted in the loss of_values and the disappearance of work and the breakdown of our families and our communities . My fellow Americans , we can cut the deficit , create jobs , promote democracy around the world , pass welfare reform and health_care , pass the toughest crime bill in history and still leave too many of our people behind . The American people have got_to want to change from within if we ' re going to bring_back work and family and community . We cannot renew our country when , within a decade , more_than half of the children will be born into families where there has been no marriage . We cannot renew this country when 13-year-old boys get semiautomatic weapons to shoot 9-year-olds for kicks . We can ' t renew our country when children are having children and the fathers walk away as if the kids don ' t amount to anything . We can ' t renew the country when our businesses eagerly look_for new investments and new customers abroad but ignore those people right here at_home who ' d give anything to have their jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had the money to do_it . We can ' t renew our country unless more of us -- I mean all_of us -- are willing to join the churches and the other good citizens , people like all_the black ministers I ' ve worked with over the years or the priests and the nuns I met at Our Lady of Help in East Los Angeles or my good friend Tony Campolo in Philadelphia , unless we ' re willing to work with people like that , people who are saving kids , adopting schools , making streets safer . All of us can do that . We can ' t renew our country until we realize that governments don ' t raise children ; parents do . Parents who know their children ' s teachers and turn_off the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right from wrong -- those kind of parents can make all_the difference . I know . I had one . And I ' m telling you we have got_to stop pointing our fingers at these kids who have no future and reach our hands_out to them . Our country needs it . We need it . And they deserve it . And so I say to you tonight , let ' s give our children a future . Let us take_away their guns and give them books . Let us overcome their despair and replace it with hope . Let us , by our example , teach them to obey the law , respect our neighbors , and cherish our values . Let us weave these sturdy threads into a new American community that once more stands strong against the forces of despair and evil , because everybody has a chance to walk into a better tomorrow . Oh , there will be naysayers who fear that we won ' t be equal_to the challenges of this time , but they misread our history , our heritage , even today ' s headlines . All those things tell us we can and we will overcome any challenge . When the earth shook and fires raged in California ; when I saw the Mississippi deluge the farmlands of the Midwest in a 500-year flood ; when the century ' s bitterest cold swept from North_Dakota to Newport News , it seemed as though the world itself was coming_apart at the seams . But the American people , they just came_together . They rose to the occasion , neighbor helping neighbor , strangers risking life and limb to save total strangers , showing the better angels of our nature . Let us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters , leaving our deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting . Let us instead be true_to our spirit , facing facts , coming_together , bringing hope and moving forward . Tonight , my fellow Americans , we are summoned to answer a question as old as the Republic itself -- what is the state of our union ? It is growing stronger , but it must be stronger still . With your help and God ' s help , it will be . Thank_you , and God bless America .</TEXT>
