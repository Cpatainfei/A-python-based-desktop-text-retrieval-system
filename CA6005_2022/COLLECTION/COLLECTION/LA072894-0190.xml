   <HEADLINE> STATE TO REVOKE MEDICAL LICENSE OF ' DR . DEATH ' ; EUTHANASIA : JACK KEVORKIAN GAINED WORLDWIDE NOTE FOR HELPING 20 PEOPLE , INCLUDING COSTA MESA MAN , END LIVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The California medical license of Jack Kevorkian , who acquired an international reputation and the moniker &quot; Dr. Death &quot; for assisting in 20 suicides , including that of a Costa Mesa man , will be permanently revoked as of midnight Friday , the state_attorney general ' s office said Wednesday . The Medical Board of California , which suspended Kevorkian ' s license in April , 1993 , issued its decision June 29 , effective a month later . Details of the ruling were not made public until Wednesday . After Friday , Kevorkian has only &quot; a tiny window of opportunity &quot; to reclaim his license , said Deputy Atty . Gen . Thomas Lazar . If he wishes to appeal , he has 30 days to file suit in Superior_Court , but isn ' t expected to do so , and even if he does , his chances for reinstatement are poor , Lazar said . &quot; He ' s finished . The effect of the medical board ' s decision was essentially to kick Kevorkian out of the world of medicine , &quot; said the San Diego-based prosecutor who has argued the state ' s case at several hearings before an administrative_law judge . Kevorkian , whose medical license was suspended in his home state of Michigan in 1991 , is appealing a ruling by a Michigan court that seeks to have the 65-year-old former pathologist tried_on murder_charges . California was the only other state where he held a medical license . Having obtained his California license in 1957 , Kevorkian worked_at two hospitals in Long_Beach from 1979 to 1982 . He lives_in Troy , Mich. , near where each of the assisted suicides has taken_place . Kevorkian could not be reached for comment Wednesday , and his Michigan-based attorney , Geoffrey Fieger , declined to comment . But last year , after California suspended Kevorkian ' s license , Fieger said Kevorkian had no intention of appealing . At the time , Fieger said that Kevorkian &quot; couldn ' t care less &quot; about losing his California license and &quot; will go_on assisting people commit suicide . He dares ( California ) to come catch him. &quot; Kevorkian is accused of playing a role in five additional suicides since then . Last year , state officials presented evidence showing that Kevorkian had assisted in the suicides of a San Diego County woman suffering from terminal cancer and a Costa Mesa man , whose best_friend argued that he was merely depressed over the death of his mother and not seriously ill . Jonathon Grenz of Costa Mesa incurred cancer in 1992 , causing doctors to remove his voice_box and tongue . But at the time he committed suicide with Kevorkian ' s help , he had recovered from the cancer and was grieving over the loss of his mother , according to the court testimony of Newport Beach real_estate_agent Linda Healy . Grenz , 44 , was &quot; depressed from his surgery , overwhelmed with grief over the loss of his mother and was never given the opportunity to grieve over his losses , &quot; testified Healy , who had worked with Grenz at an Orange County real_estate firm . Martha Ruwart , 40 , of Cardiff by the Sea , whose duodenal cancer had invaded her small_intestine and ovaries with numerous tumors , died in a Waterford , Mich. , home_in 1993 with Kevorkian by her side . It was Ruwart ' s death that prompted the Michigan Legislature to pass a law banning assisted suicide . But despite what Lazar called the &quot; compelling &quot; nature of the two cases involving California residents , the state ' s strongest evidence in revoking the license involved five suicides that had no connection to California and which the board found to be particularly egregious breaches of medical ethics , Lazar said . &quot; We don ' t care if they happened on the moon , &quot; he added . &quot; We merely used them to show that he was unfit to practice medicine in California and won ' t ever again. &quot; While a chapter may have closed_in California , Kevorkian ' s troubles in Michigan may eventually place him behind bars . In May , the Michigan Court of Appeals overturned the state law designed to stop Kevorkian ' s practice of assisted suicide but ordered murder_charges reinstated against him . Since Kevorkian was licensed to practice medicine in only two states , he is &quot; no longer Dr. Kevorkian , &quot; Lazar said . &quot; He ' s Mr. Kevorkian . He ' s no different from an auto mechanic who can offer carbon-monoxide death by inhalation . &quot; After Friday , you won ' t have to worry about Jack Kevorkian in California ever again . What Michigan does is up_to Michigan , but speaking only for California , he ' s done here . . . finished . . . forever. &quot;</TEXT>
