   <HEADLINE> BID TO RAISE CIGARETTE TAX TO TREAT PROSTATE CANCER DEFEATED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A bill increasing the state cigarette tax by two cents a pack to raise $ 37 million annually for prostrate cancer research and treatment was rejected Monday by the Assembly . The bill was defeated on a 49-26 vote , five short of the two-thirds majority of 54 votes needed for passage . Its sponsor , Assemblyman Stan Statham ( R-Oak Run ) , said he will seek reconsideration at a later date . There was no debate . The Legislature last year approved , and Gov . Pete Wilson signed into law , a bill increasing the cigarette tax by two cents a package to raise funds for breast_cancer research and treatment . But 1994 is an election year and lower house Republican lawmakers appeared reluctant to approve a tax increase . Forty-five Democrats and five Republicans voted for the bill . All votes against it were lodged by Republicans . Under Statham ' s bill , the state cigarette tax would have climbed to 39 cents a pack . A pack of cigarettes sells for about $ 2.00. Half of the tax_hike would have gone_for prostate cancer research and half for treatment . This year , the state is to receive $ 51 million from the federal_government for prostate cancer research . In his opening remarks , Statham told his colleagues : &quot; Gentlemen , you have a chance to save your own life . Women live_in fear of breast_cancer . Men should live_in fear of prostate cancer. &quot; He added that there is growing medical evidence showing a possible link between smoking and prostate cancer . Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in California , and is the second-highest killer of men in the state behind lung_cancer , Statham said . The disease increased 58.9 % in California during the three-year period between 1988-1991 , according to the American Cancer Society . In 1991 , it exceeded breast_cancer for the first time as the most frequent type of cancer in California .</TEXT>
