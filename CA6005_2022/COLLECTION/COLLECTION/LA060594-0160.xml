   <HEADLINE> SMOKING FOUND TO ESCALATE RISK OF BREAST_CANCER DEATH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Smoking escalates a woman ' s risk of dying from breast_cancer by at least 25 % , according to a study that also says women can eliminate that increase by quitting . Smokers were 25 % more likely than nonsmokers and ex-smokers to die of breast_cancer , according to a recent American Cancer Society survey of 604 # 412 women who were initially free_of cancer.After six years , 880 had died of the disease , which strikes one in eight U.S. women . The risk grew with the number of cigarettes a woman smoked , culminating in a 75 % greater risk among women who smoked two packs a day or more . Quitting would return a former smoker ' s risk to that of a lifelong nonsmoker , researchers said . An estimated 46 # 000 women will die this year of breast_cancer , the second-most common cancer killer among women . Eugenia Calle , an epidemiologist who directed the American Cancer Society research , said the study does not suggest that smoking causes breast_cancer . Instead , she said the increased risk may result from &quot; poorer survival or delayed diagnosis. &quot; &quot; For example , smokers may have impaired immune_systems , they may_not obtain routine ( mammograms ) , or smoking may cause a direct deleterious effect on survival , &quot; Calle said .</TEXT>
