   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; COLISEUM STAYS IN THE GAME ; OFFICIALS TURN A CATASTROPHE INTO A CATALYST , USING FEMA QUAKE FUNDS TO KEEP THE RAIDERS OUT OF THE STADIUM SHOPPING DERBY -- AT LEAST FOR A YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After January ' s earthquake caused extensive damage to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , the first challenge was to save the historic structure , to shore_up its ivy-covered walls before an aftershock collapsed the stadium . But a second challenge for Coliseum officials was no less formidable -- to keep the Raiders . To do that they would have to survive another round in the Stadium Game , the frenzied competition among cities to lure sports teams -- while the teams maneuver to get_the_best deals . Even before the quake , the Raiders had been threatening to move , frustrated by years of unfulfilled promises to upgrade the 71-year-old Coliseum and add luxury suites , the feature essential to peak profitability in pro football today . After the quake , &quot; I didn ' t have to be clairvoyant to expect other cities to be talking to the Raiders , &quot; said Don C . Webb , the man hired to oversee the repairs . &quot; If there ever was an ideal opportunity to take the money and cut and run , it would have been this year. &quot; In the end , however , it was the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission that turned catastrophe into opportunity and kept the Raiders in the fold -- at least for another season . The team and its &quot; Just Win , Baby &quot; owner , Al Davis , will take_the_field Sunday in a substantially improved stadium , thanks to commitments of $ 60 million in federal and state quake funds . Seven months of round-the-clock construction produced new electrical_systems and concession stands and modern restrooms . And , perhaps most significant , quietly included in the project were foundations for the suites long sought by the Raiders . &quot; If we don ' t build the boxes , &quot; said Coliseum Commissioner Sheldon Sloan , &quot; that stadium will die. &quot; The problem was , the commission had never been able to finance such a project , and the Federal Emergency Management Agency , which would pay_for earthquake repairs , prohibits betterment of a facility with taxpayers ' funds -- much as a homeowner is not supposed to use a disaster grant to add a new deck to a house . &quot; It was a political dilemma , &quot; said former Commissioner Steve Silberman . &quot; No politician wants to be credited with giving the store away to a for-profit , privately held organization ( like ) a football , baseball or basketball_team . At the same time , they don ' t want that finger pointed at them as having driven the team away. &quot; The answer ? Take a first_step by incorporating the foundations for the suites almost invisibly within the earthquake repair project , itself billed as nothing less than a symbol of renewal for a battered Los Angeles . So when imposing concrete-and-steel beams were erected around the Coliseum to brace it against future temblors , some were built even stronger to create &quot; one hellacious frame , &quot; in the words of the prime contractor -- just right to support &quot; future construction. &quot; Or as sports investment analyst Paul Much put it : &quot; The earthquake was devastating to Southern California , but it may be a blessing in disguise for Al Davis . The silver_lining in the cloud is that he ' s going_to get his sky boxes. &quot; ' A Sports Soap_Opera ' You don ' t have to go_far to get a front row seat for the Stadium Game . In Southern California , it embroils virtually every professional sports team and venue : The Rams are set to leave Anaheim Stadium , and the Angels are grousing about the place too . The Clippers are toying_with leaving the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena , while the Lakers and Kings are looking_at rebuilding on the site of the Forum in Inglewood -- or moving as well . Meanwhile , the Pond in Anaheim is trying to lure a second team to join the Mighty Ducks , while San Diego considers a new arena to woo a basketball_team , having lost two in the past . Although the game is intense now , the history of the Coliseum is a reminder that communities have long debated the use of tax dollars on sports facilities -- and teams have long shopped for the best deal . In 1920 , voters rejected a $ 900 # 000 bond measure for a sports complex in Exposition Park , forcing city_fathers to arrange financing from 14 banks . To further reassure taxpayers , the Coliseum was required to be self-supporting , managed by a commission of nine state , city and county appointees . The stadium quickly became a hub of sports glory . Crowds of 100 # 000 watched the 1932 Olympics and marveled at the landmark peristyle , which evoked ancient arenas . For football , it hosted not only neighboring USC but also -- for 52 years -- rival UCLA . When big-league pro sports moved West , the Coliseum was a prime beneficiary : The Rams came from Cleveland in 1946 , and the Dodgers used it as a temporary home after leaving Brooklyn in 1958 . But the Dodgers finished their own stadium in 1962 and the Rams packed up in 1980 , complaining of outdated seats and other problems . The Rams headed to Orange County for what was then a state-of-the-art Anaheim Stadium . In May , the Rams paid $ 2 million to exercise an escape clause in their lease , complaining that that stadium is now outdated . &quot; You can take the most beautiful structure in the world ( and ) new innovations make_it obsolete , &quot; said Jerry Buss , the Lakers ' majority owner . &quot; The new ones of today are the old ones of tomorrow. &quot; Buss sees this in his own Forum . Touted in 1967 as &quot; one of the fine buildings erected during the 20th Century , &quot; it is considered small and lacking ( no suites ) . At the same time , proposals for $ 200-million arenas are sprouting all_over , four for Downtown alone , as their backers scramble to sign_up the Lakers , Kings and Clippers . It ' s &quot; kind of a sports soap_opera , &quot; Buss said . &quot; I love it. &quot; Of course , Buss is a world-class poker player , adept at games where &quot; you have a_few chips and use them to your advantage. &quot; And occasionally , &quot; you try to bluff. &quot; But few believe that the Rams are bluffing as they weigh offers from Baltimore and St . Louis . Although the team has had four losing seasons in a row , these suitors seem to view any National Football_League franchise as vital to their civic identity , proof of first-rank status . Baltimore , which lost the Colts to Indianapolis in 1984 , is offering to build a $ 160-million stadium with lottery-backed bonds . St . Louis , which lost the Cardinals to Phoenix in 1988 , proposes a $ 260-million domed beauty . The Rams also have a wish list that includes payment of $ 30 million they owe for Anaheim Stadium improvements and a lease giving them all stadium revenue , including concessions and advertising . At Anaheim Stadium , by contrast , they pay_up to $ 400 # 000 rent each year and split concessions revenue with the city . &quot; I told ( the Rams ) that we were prepared_for them to ask_for the moon , &quot; St . Louis County Executive George ( Buzz ) Westfall said . Still , how do you compete with the moon ? It is nearly impossible for Anaheim Stadium , and it has 113 &quot; sky boxes , &quot; albeit old ones . The Coliseum has none of the glassed-in suites that cater to the corporate set , each offering a dozen seats , kitchenette-bars , private bathrooms and waiters on call . The Coliseum , in fact , is one of two NFL stadiums without them . The other , RFK Stadium , is in the process of losing its team , the Washington Redskins . In football in particular , &quot; suites are sweet , &quot; as the saying goes . The reason is the economic structure of the NFL . The largest source of income -- the league ' s $ 1.58-billion Fox television contract -- is divided equally among the 28 teams . So is the take from licensing team names for T-shirts and other paraphernalia . Although Raiders ' gear is much more popular than other teams ' , Davis does not get a penny more_than anyone else . The only way to get an economic edge on other teams is to maximize the &quot; revenue streams &quot; that vary from site to site , such_as parking and concessions -- and the suites that lease for $ 100 # 000 a year or more , all_of which generally goes_to the team . Thus when Webb evaluated what the Coliseum had to offer , his sobering estimate was that &quot; the Raiders start off with a $ 10- or $ 15-million disadvantage. &quot; He did not expect Davis , of all people , to endure that for long . Davis had fought the NFL to win greater mobility for teams and move his from Oakland to larger Los Angeles in 1982 . He flirted_with Irwindale and came_away with $ 10 million when the tiny city could not turn a gravel pit into a stadium . He tried returning to Oakland when he could not get suites in Los Angeles , then received new promises at the Coliseum -- but little more . Then the quake shook everything up . Again . Reacting to the Quake Webb was the logical first_person to call early Jan . 17 when a workman discovered that ripples from the Northridge earthquake had packed a punch 20 miles away . A straight-arrow former college miler trained in environmental engineering , he had come_to Los Angeles with Spectacor Corp. , which took_over management of the Coliseum and in 1991 proposed a $ 175-million reconstruction , including 282 suites , but was unable to pull it off . Webb , 43 , stayed_on when the commission hired him to supervise the much smaller project that did go_through : a $ 15-million lowering of the field and reconfiguring of seats to create a more intimate football setting . That job was being finished when the quake snapped columns four feet in diameter , buckled walkways , turned the peristyle into a latticework of cracks and left the Olympic torch teetering . Webb called construction executive Ron Tutor . His giant Tutor-Saliba Corp . was handling the $ 15-million renovation and had been poised for a decade to put_in suites , if money ever came_through . Tutor , an avid USC alumnus , also had a passion for the Coliseum . Without a guarantee of repayment , Tutor moved_in construction crews and heavy equipment to support the walls . &quot; I was genuinely afraid ( that ) major portions could come_down , &quot; he said . Soon after , the commission rewarded him with a no-bid contract to carry_out the full repairs , limiting overhead and profit to 3.5 % of the total . Tutor vowed to have the place ready for USC ' s Sept . 3 opener or , &quot; I ' m leaving town. &quot; Also keeping an eye out for USC was the commission ' s vice_president , Los Angeles City_Council President John Ferraro , a former All-American there . He quipped that Tutor would wind_up buried in the Coliseum ' s concrete &quot; if he doesn ' t get_it done. &quot; To Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke , the pressing issue was the impact on economically depressed South-Central Los Angeles . &quot; The Coliseum became symbolic , as did the 10 Freeway , that this was not just a Valley earthquake , &quot; said Burke , the commission ' s president . Time and again , she would speak_of the 8 # 000 jobs provided by the Coliseum complex , even if virtually all were part time -- in the parking_lots or hot dog stands -- and the potential for minority hiring in any reconstruction project . Such considerations also could sell a project in the political_arena . James Lee Witt , national director of FEMA , received a 1991 study estimating $ 100 million in economic benefits from the Coliseum through a &quot; multiplier effect &quot; that calculated every conceivable dollar spent in restaurants , motels and the_like -- even players ' salaries . Equally important was White_House aide John Emerson , who had run President Clinton ' s California campaign and was coordinating Administration response to the quake . Emerson said : &quot; The President of the United States cares about getting Los Angeles on its feet , &quot; and although damaged hospitals and schools had priority , &quot; a lot of people see the Coliseum as a symbol of Los Angeles. &quot; Federal authorities quickly approved use of FEMA funds to pay 90 % ( the state would pay the rest ) of a Coliseum repair project initially estimated at $ 33 million . But through the rah-rahing for USC and high rhetoric about symbols of renewal , others had their eye on the nitty-gritty question that , in their view , would determine the Coliseum ' s long-term fate : Would the Raiders stay ? They believed the stadium would never be viable with only college football , even adding an occasional rock_concert , motocross event or religious rally . Yet the Raiders were operating_on year-to-year agreements . Now , with the Coliseum ' s status uncertain , the team had no choice but to scout alternatives for the fall -- an ominous fact to some . Said Silberman , who recently left the commission for the city Board of Pension Commissioners : &quot; Many of us believed if you lose them for a season , you lose them. &quot; Misery and Profit Oakland ' s letter to Al Davis was in the mail -- the fax machine , actually -- Feb . 2 . &quot; We don ' t want to profit from someone ' s misery , &quot; insisted Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata . But , well , you know , the Oakland Coliseum was available . One of the quirks of the Stadium Game is how communities that once lost teams fight the hardest , later on , to get a new one -- or their old team back . Like some spurned lovers , they ' re willing to kiss and make_up . And fork out . In the eyes of Oakland officials , scarred veterans of the game , Los Angeles was primed to lose the Raiders because it had so many attractions -- beaches , theaters , other teams -- that it did not have the same emotional stake as smaller burgs in meeting Davis ' price . They recalled Councilman Nate Holden once saying : &quot; Let him go . L.A. ' s the place , and if he doesn ' t want to be here , get out. &quot; &quot; You got_to remember , almost every owner has a pretty big ego , &quot; said George Vukasin , chairman of Oakland ' s Coliseum Commission . &quot; I know Al , and ( after the quake ) I said : ' Al , can we help you ? ' &quot; By the time this round in the Stadium Game was over , Raiders ' attorney Amy Trask would also thank Baltimore , Memphis , Orlando and Hartford &quot; for the magnificent alternatives they afforded us. &quot; Behind the Scenes For someone who has owned several teams , Harry Ornest keeps a low public profile . But the 71-year-old former boss of hockey ' s St . Louis Blues and the Canadian Football_League ' s Toronto Argonauts remains a behind-the-scenes player in finance and sports as vice_chairman of Hollywood Park , where racing czar R.D. Hubbard has been expanding like mad . They have added a huge card &quot; casino &quot; beside the horse track and plan a music_hall on the sprawling Inglewood property . So it was not surprising that Ornest hinted at new possibilities when he ran_into Ferraro earlier this year . As an avid free-enterpriser , Ornest was enraged that the government was spending nearly $ 50 million -- the figure had risen by then -- to fix the Coliseum . He liked to quote Times ' columnist Jim Murray , who called it &quot; that rotting pile of urine-stenched old stones. &quot; Ornest said Ferraro told him : &quot; We need a place to play. &quot; &quot; I said : ' Can you picture a new stadium that would house USC , UCLA and the Raiders all_in one ? ' &quot; Ornest was hinting at a stadium on Hollywood Park grounds , just floating an idea . But Ferraro shrugged , he said . &quot; ( He ) said : ' Harry , we couldn ' t have gotten that $ 45 million if it wasn ' t for the earthquake. ' &quot; Getting the Job Done &quot; The Coliseum Commission has not always delivered , &quot; acknowledged Burke , its president . &quot; ( The Raiders ) wanted to see something in terms of good_faith . . . some sign. &quot; The most basic sign was showing that the job could be done_in time . But that would take a near-miracle , even with 800 workers and a 24-hour schedule . For the bureaucratic hurdles were daunting : FEMA rules , fire_codes , city building_codes and -- because the Coliseum is a national historic landmark -- preservationist concerns . After San Francisco City_Hall was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake , federal aid was held_up more_than four years amid squabbling over such matters . Four months could lose the Raiders . Yet the project threatened to be stalled when preservation groups could not agree on what should be saved at the Coliseum . Was a press_box installed in the 1950s part of its historic fabric ? Ivy on the walls ? How about the long trough urinals in the men ' s rooms ? Those eager to inch the stadium closer to state-of-the-art believed it essential to overhaul the bathrooms and set_aside more for women -- reflecting the modern reality of who goes_to games . But some hard-line preservationists insisted that the troughs stay . &quot; I ' m boggled by it , &quot; said Linda Dishman , executive_director of the Los Angeles Conservancy , which did not insist on the troughs . One Sacramento-based preservationist called his Los Angeles counterparts &quot; sellouts. &quot; A Los Angeles leader became suspicious , in turn , that &quot; looney tune &quot; Northern Californians wanted to obstruct the project because they were &quot; ticked_off that L.A. is getting all this FEMA money. &quot; In the end , they compromised : The troughs could go . The ivy too . But thousands of cracks would be repaired -- using space-age epoxy -- so the concrete looked little different than when it was poured decades ago . Lighting in the pedestrian tunnels would use modern fixtures that looked vintage . Improvements such_as those had FEMA ' s approval . With major projects , the agency requires that the structure be brought_up to modern standards . Whether funds go_to repair apartments or a public facility such_as the Coliseum , &quot; the more we can do to build safer and better , &quot; director Witt noted , &quot; . . . will save federal , state and local tax dollars in the future. &quot; Because the Coliseum power_system did not meet current codes , it got a new one -- with 247 miles of electrical lines . The damaged video board that shows instant replays ? Why not ask_for the latest &quot; Diamond Vision &quot; version , which could be billed as &quot; the largest stadium screen in the nation ? &quot; FEMA said OK . And speaking_of big , how about those &quot; seismic reinforcing beams &quot; and piles to protect the entire structure against quakes ; 56 beams would ring the stadium and the piles would be buried as deep as 92 feet into the ground . They were a major reason project officials calculated that they used enough concrete to fill 13 feet above the football_field , and 7.6 million pounds of steel rebar . And so it was that one sports executive gestured up at the imposing supports one day and asked : &quot; would n ' t it be amazing , simply amazing , if some of those were being built with a little extra concrete , and right in the spots they would be needed to support &quot; -- a wink -- &quot; oh , say , luxury suites ? &quot; Who Will Pay ? Virtually everyone in the Coliseum project agrees that it made no sense to build the frame differently : to put_in only what was needed for earthquake support , then have to tear much of it up for more bracing -- perhaps this winter -- after a deal goes_through to add heavy rows of suites . &quot; Not to do_it now would be extremely illogical and foolish , &quot; Tutor said . &quot; It ' s upfront . . . . This design has a certain number of larger piles and foundations . . . . I can only say the obvious : . . . ( It ) does allow_for sky boxes. &quot; The minutes of commission meetings since the earthquake , however , contain no mention of the_matter , or what officials agree became the main issue : Who would pay_for the extra work ? But it was discussed at executive_sessions and less formal gatherings . &quot; I don ' t think anyone said , ' You sneaky little devils , you , you ' re trying to sneak stuff in , ' &quot; recalled Dishman . &quot; ( But ) the way it was left in our meetings , it was unclear how much ( FEMA ) would pay for. &quot; Robert Mackensen , director of the state Historical Building Safety Board , said he was led to believe that FEMA would only pay_for &quot; what is needed to support the Coliseum , &quot; not extra work to facilitate suites . &quot; If it was you or me , they ' d say : ' What are you up_to , pal ? ' &quot; Indeed , FEMA ' s regional coordinator , Frank Kishton , agreed that there were some improvements &quot; that the commission and everyone knows were not eligible . . . the enlarged caissons , for example. &quot; But Kishton also recalled the pressure from Washington on down to get the job done -- and said he was uncertain how the money question finally was resolved . &quot; It ' s always conceivable , &quot; he noted , &quot; that an auditor down the road . . . says , ' Geez FEMA , you made a mistake with that. ' &quot; In fact , according to a variety of project officials , all work to date has been declared &quot; FEMA eligible , &quot; meaning it will be funded . They walk a rhetorical tightrope in explaining why . Webb said : &quot; We have to be careful because we ' re using public funds . . . . But we don ' t want to paint ourselves into a corner -- so that framing restoration and repair and strengthening we ' re doing now isn ' t done_in such a way that keeps a future suite program from happening , for instance . &quot; I want to be careful how I characterize this because to the extent that we ' re bettering something that didn ' t need to be done , the commission stands the possibility of paying_for that. &quot; &quot; I just want to be clear , &quot; he concluded . &quot; It ' s a betterment that ' s necessitated by the earthquake. &quot; Commissioner Sloan similarly said it was &quot; coincidental &quot; that the seismic upgrading may &quot; ultimately lower the cost of the boxes. &quot; How much could be saved ? &quot; They now have an opportunity to cut $ 25 million off the price , &quot; one sports official said at last week ' s ceremony reopening the Coliseum . &quot; It will enable them to do_it for maybe $ 25 ( to $ 30 ) million , and get the suites without missing a season . Isn ' t that what the Raiders have been looking_for all along ? &quot; Raiders Get a Deal The Raiders would not say what convinced them to stay_put for now . Not unusual in the secretive realm of Al Davis , team officials declined comment . On June 22 , they signed an agreement to play the 1994 season at a Coliseum that Webb promised would be &quot; safe for everybody but the opposing teams. &quot; Whereas the Raiders had been paying about $ 800 # 000 rent , they will play rent-free this year -- unless a long-term agreement is negotiated including construction of boxes and other renovation of Exposition Park . The rent then could be paid retroactively to help secure bonds or a loan to complete the work before the 1995 season . In July , Burke and Webb traveled_to Washington to inform federal authorities that repair costs at the Coliseum could approach $ 60 million . Go_ahead , they were told . Today , even as life -- and football -- return to the Coliseum , there are many issues unresolved . The seating and the bowl shape still mean long walks to concessions . Parking remains inadequate by NFL standards and revenue from it still goes mostly to the state -- not the team , as elsewhere . And , of course , the project will not stop others from wooing Davis . &quot; They can do anything they want to and at a whim he can take that team away , &quot; said Dan Visnich , a preservationist on the staff of state Sen . Nicholas C . Petris , a Democrat from . . . Oakland . &quot; All they want to do is please Al Davis , and I ' m not certain he ' s a person who can be pleased. &quot; What ' s more , he ' s not the only tenant that the commission must worry about . With three years left on their lease , the Clippers are weighing alternatives to the Sports Arena . Too small . No suites . The executive_vice_president of that team , Andy Roeser , noted with amazement that the quake left the Clippers ' home with relatively trivial damage . Of course , he wasn ' t sure that was a good thing in this crazy Stadium Game . &quot; As you can see from the extensive work going_on at the Coliseum , &quot; Roeser said , &quot; it perhaps would have been a blessing . . . had the earthquake struck 200 yards east &quot; -- meaning under his team ' s Sports Arena . Playing the Want_Ad Game Team executives , entrepreneurs and government officials are playing &quot; Let ' s Make a Deal &quot; all around the country , but nowhere more feverishly than in Southern California . What are the area ' s sports teams after ? Who is trying to lure them away ? This hypothetical classified section offers a look . TEAMS LOOKING TO UPGRADE L.A.
