   <HEADLINE> CLINTON FOCUS ON INFLATION SQUEEZES MIDDLE_CLASS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hey , remember the presidential race of 1992 ? Remember the put-upon middle_class ? Remember the folks whose pain candidate Bill_Clinton felt and whose plight he wanted to remedy ? You know , the ones he promised a tax cut and a faster-growing economy with more jobs and fewer entitlement programs ? So what happened to those people once candidate Clinton became President Clinton ? Forgotten and put-upon , once again . First , they watched the middle-class tax cut disappear , then they endured an economic recovery that turned_out to be limp and jobless , then they heard new entitlement programs proposed -- more government spending for health-care reform and welfare reform . Now , they are being squeezed_by the great interest-rate run-up , or , actually , creep-up . The Federal_Reserve has nudged up rates three times -- with another bump-up expected this week . This sort of creepy-creep unsettles the markets -- particularly the long-bond market , where interest_rates have shot_up from a tad more_than 6 % to 7.6 % . But the Clinton_Administration hasn ' t complained . Nope , its economists have begun to talk_about the inflation menace . Indeed , the Administration has gotten angry at the bond market for responding , appropriately , to the Fed ' s actions , not at the Fed for trying to dampen what little economic_growth there is . Not that there aren ' t good reasons to inch up interest_rates : There are certain signs , however faint , that the rate_of_inflation is accelerating . Commodity prices are_on the way up . After three years of being_on the flat side , food prices have begun to rise ; gold prices are smartly off their lows of last September , while prices for other precious_metals and some industrial metals , such_as copper , have jumped . There are other anxieties as well . Some economists find high capacity-utilization rates and lower unemployment_rates worrisome ; others are bothered that the Fed ' s monetary policy has been too loose for the past two years , while others fret the Fed waited too long to tighten . But some inflationary augurs are a self-created political problem . And herein lies a great puzzle . It is widely believed that Clinton won the election with the simple focus of &quot; It ' s the economy , stupid. &quot; Yet , Clinton ' s actions in office indicate a great ignorance . Indeed , coming_after a decade of hard-won and welcome disinflation , his policies almost suggest a wish to re-inflate the economy . Take the Clinton_Administration ' s policy on the dollar : the weaker the better . After two years of talking the dollar down to promote exports -- the Administration suddenly decided the dollar was &quot; too weak. &quot; A weak dollar promotes inflation in two ways : Consumers must pay more for imports , and those higher prices provide a shield for domestic manufacturers to raise their prices . Hence , two weeks ago , the Administration reversed itself and led an effort to boost the value of the dollar by intervening in currency markets and inviting speculation that the Fed would again push_up interest_rates . Also adding_to the dollar ' s weakness , and thus to the threat of inflation , has been the Administration ' s foreign_policy , or lack of a coherent one , which has unsettled investor confidence worldwide . Specifically , the Administration ' s trade threats against Japan have fostered global nervousness . And the potential impact of money and sex scandals on the effectiveness of presidential leadership has not helped world confidence in the dollar , either . Finally , the Administration hasn ' t helped the anti-inflationary case by appointing two inflation doves to the Federal_Reserve to fill positions opened when two inflation hawks retired . But are these inflationary prickles strong enough to heed ? Probably yes . Accelerating rates_of_inflation are always serious . Price volatility that accompanies inflation is a drag_on economic_growth through the uncertainty it generates . Worse , once inflation becomes embedded in people ' s expectations , it not only aggravates the initial problem but is hard to reverse -- without a nasty recession . But why fight inflation by raising interest_rates and therefore running_up mortgage rates , interest_rates on car loans and credit_cards ? Why slow an already sluggish economy ? For cynics , the answer lies_with the political-economic cycle . This view holds that the Administration wants an economic boom in 1996 , a presidential election year , so it is trying to slow growth now . If this is true , Clinton owes the working middle_class a better deal . The Administration has other options for fighting inflation . After all , an economy growing at 2 % to 3 % a year is not exactly gangbusters . Especially now that the rate_of_growth in productivity seems to be , finally , recovering from a two-decade slump . Rather , the Administration should concentrate its efforts on accelerating productivity growth . For starters , a review of business-tax policy would be in_order . It is business investment and technological breakthrough that drive productivity gains , and tax law ought to encourage such activity . Instead , the Administration raised some corporate tax_rates in its 1992 budget and is hoping to hit business with another tax -- to pay_for health-care reform . In addition , the tax_rate on capital_gains ought to be lowered to encourage the entrepreneurial effort that is a main engine of technological breakthrough . The Administration could also improve the general climate for economic activity by crafting and maintaining a stable and dependable policy environment . Long-term investors don ' t like surprises . They don ' t like going_to_bed under one regime and waking_up to find government has changed the rules with another &quot; initiative &quot; that requires intervention in the economy . The less government activity in the economy , the more room there is for business and private investment activity . Simply put , the Clinton_Administration is doing plenty to promote inflationary expectations and its response to those expectations -- cheering the rise of interest_rates to slow growth -- will hammer those who can least sustain a hit in the head . A faster growing economy is what Clinton promised the middle-class and he should match his policies to his promises . As long as he is about it , how about that middle-class tax cut ? *</TEXT>
