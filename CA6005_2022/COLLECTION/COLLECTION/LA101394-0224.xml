   <HEADLINE> BY DESIGN ; THE FACES OF SUCCESS ; OATS . APPLE_JUICE . POWDERED MILK . USING RAW INGREDIENTS LIKE THESE , THREE L.A. SKIN_CARE CHEFS HAVE COOKED_UP PRODUCTS THAT ARE WINNING FANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the beauty business , a woman ' s place is in the kitchen ( that being just another word for lab ) . In the first_half of this century , the grande_dames of cosmetics -- Helena Rubinstein , Elizabeth Arden and Estee Lauder -- started_out behind the stove , cooking_up batches of face_cream from scratch . The results -- Creme Valaze , Venetian Cream and Super Rich All Purpose Creme , respectively -- launched cosmetic empires . That tradition continues , with a new generation of skin-care chefs concocting what they hope will be the ubiquitous creams of tomorrow . Using such ingredients from the larder as oats , cucumbers , apple_juice and nonfat_dry_milk , these local entrepreneurs have more in common with their famous forebears than do such cosmetics upstarts as Donna Karan , who introduced a skin-care line this year with the help of a dermatologist -- and a reported $ 4-million advertising budget . The only form of promotion these Los Angeles women can afford is word_of_mouth . Here are three who are making people talk . * Call it the Eastern European connection . Helena Rubinstein , who was born in Poland , admitted to a biographer that &quot; lots of Romanians and Hungarians -- clever with skin -- taught me masses. &quot; A native of Romania , Mariana Chicet studied cosmetic chemistry and skin_care for two years at a Bucharest college , then immigrated to Los Angeles in 1979 at age 27 . Tucked among her belongings was a 100-year-old formula for what would become Bone_Marrow Cream , an &quot; anti-wrinkle &quot; emollient that is now her bestseller . Chicet started her career here by giving facials and invested those earnings into electric_mixers , she says . &quot; One gallon , then five gallon , then 10. &quot; Her signature product_line was born . Today , the bottles line the window of her small eponymous store on West 3rd Street in Los Angeles , where three full-time aestheticians perform 85 facials a week . Chicet is too busy doing skin consultations and visiting her lab near Cal State L.A. to do much hands-on work these days . Chicet is candid about her &quot; secret &quot; ingredients . A local meat packer supplies the beef bones ( &quot; they have to be fresh &quot; ) from which workers extract the oil for Bone_Marrow Cream . The seaweed in her Fresh Sea Plant Mask is imported from Japan and crushed gently in a special mixer . Moisturizers such_as collagen , elastin and hyaluronic_acid come from a Swiss pharmaceuticals firm . Prices range from $ 7.50 for Emollient Cleanser to $ 25.50 for Day and Night Revitalizing Concentrate . Every couple of months , Chicet and her husband , who oversees the lab , order small production runs -- 350 jars of Bone_Marrow Cream , 600 bottles of Nutrient Milk Cleanser -- to fill demand . Although they could expand the business through outside investors and boost their $ 200 # 000 in annual sales , &quot; investors cut corners , &quot; Chicet says . &quot; They would say , ' Why do you use so_much collagen , 33 % , in your Day and Night Concentrate ? ' &quot; So she does_it her way . With a celebrity clientele that includes Linda Evangelista , Kyle MacLachlan , Laura Dern , Diane Ladd , Nicole Kidman , Judy Davis , Stephanie Zimbalist and Lara Flynn Boyle , she must be doing something right . Mariana Chicet / Natural European Skin_Care Products and Treatments ; ( 213 ) 651-0979 or ( 213 ) 651-0291 . * Just as Estee Lauder ' s Hungarian uncle provided her with the original formula for Super Rich All Purpose Creme , Arcona Devan ' s Scandinavian grandmother handed_down the recipes that would form the backbone of her company . Born in what was East_Germany , Arcona , who goes_by her first_name only , studied premed and worked as a medical technician in Munich before moving to Los Angeles 20 years ago . She found a job at a hospital in the Valley but had less success finding the right night cream . &quot; I ' ve always had the most problematic skin , &quot; she says , &quot; because it ' s sensitive , thin and oily -- the most difficult skin to treat . Especially in Southern California , with the smog and the heat . Then I remembered my grandmother . Once a week she ' d make a very powerful sugar solution and put it on her face . Sometimes she ' d use white_wine . Of course , both are natural acids . She had the most beautiful skin. &quot; Grandma also left a legacy of cornmeal scrubs , yogurt packs , egg_yolk ( or egg_white ) facials and vinegar- or lemon-juice-based toners . Arcona began giving &quot; holistic &quot; facials out of her house in 1986 using her homemade products , then hooked_up_with a chemist who added &quot; scientific substances &quot; to the formulas . The Arcona Skin and Beauty Therapy line was launched in 1989 and is produced today in a local lab , with names that evoke an earlier era : Golden Grain Gommage ( an exfoliator containing lemon_peel , oats and cornmeal ) , Toner Tea Bar ( green_tea extract ) , Desert Mist ( with mucin ) and Magic Green Ice ( the mystery ingredient is shark cartilage ) . Prices range from $ 25 for Glissando Body Lotion to $ 45 for the Solution , featuring glycolic_acid . Tucked into an anonymous , ivy-covered commercial building in North Hollywood , the Arcona Studio is kept humming from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day except Sunday . Since Arcona trained three full-time facialists in her technique -- the Non-Surgical Face_Lift and Facial Contouring with Essential_Oils -- she ' s been trying to cut_back her hours in the treatment room . New clients who insist on her magic fingers face a long waiting_list . Although she says the business is &quot; only a boutique operation , &quot; Arcona and her husband / partner sold $ 250 # 000 in products and treatments last year . Many clients come from the nearby studios ( Universal , Disney , Warner Bros. , NBC ) . Forget about prying their names out of Arcona . &quot; They trust me not to tell , &quot; she says , admitting that a_few are accompanied by bodyguards , who wait in her tiny reception area . The only big name Arcona can drop is actress Linda Gray of &quot; Models Inc. , &quot; because &quot; Linda is my friend , &quot; Arcona says . &quot; She has been coming_to me , once a week , for 4 1 / 2 years -- unless she ' s away on location . She ' s committed to the facials , and that ' s why they work for her. &quot; The Arcona Studio / Holistic Beauty Therapy for Face and Body ; ( 818 ) 583-0129 or ( 818 ) 506-5192 . * Beauty mavens move to where the market is . Helena Rubinstein launched her cream by applying it to the sun-scorched , wind-burned faces of Australian women . And Lisha Coleman arrived in 1988 to help save us from the California sun . She came bearing gifts from Baltimore , where she created Feed Your Face Cosmetics -- a line of homemade , refrigerated skin-care products distributed through health-food stores . Although Coleman had trained under skin-care aesthetician Von Lee and holistic healer Marcia Brown , she calls her mom -- Ella Maria Otaigbe , a licensed cosmetologist -- her mentor . &quot; My mother worked in Nigeria for eight years , &quot; Coleman explains , &quot; setting_up and supervising a manufacturing_plant for hair products. &quot; The botanicals she brought_back -- African shea butter , sage rosemary and hemp -- inspired Coleman ' s skin-care line . At the same time , she began doing hair and makeup for celebrities such_as Ben Vereen and Philip Michael Thomas on the set of &quot; Miami Vice. &quot; Armed with contacts and expertise , Coleman moved to Los Angeles . Today , the 34-year-old lives in the Hollywood Hills , where a back-yard guest house serves as a test kitchen for Lisha Coleman ' s Collection , an improved version of the Feed Your Face line . &quot; I ' m self-made , &quot; she says . &quot; You can call me a chemist or a witch_doctor , either one , but I ' m most at_home in a lab. &quot; She employs a cosmetic chemist with whom &quot; I fistfight constantly because I ' m such a stickler for natural ingredients , &quot; Coleman says . &quot; My chemist wants to save money by using synthetics. &quot; The products are mass-produced at a Huntington Beach lab , using natural ingredients from suppliers in Africa , Switzerland and Germany . She calls her company modest and estimates sales at $ 30 # 000 a month . that ' s a lot of Cucumber Facial Bath , Collagen Creme Concentrate , Honey and Almond_Oil Scrub , 911 Gel / Emergency Oil Control ( for blemishes ) , and Orange and Sesame Moisture Lotion ( her bestseller ) . Prices range from $ 10 for Aloe Vera Wash to $ 22 for Moisturizing Collagen Masque . Like colleagues Chicet and Arcona , Coleman conducts skin-care consultations by phone and ships the prescribed products nationwide . To administer facials and hair extensions , another Coleman specialty , she makes house calls or rents space at local salons . Among her rich and famous clients : Shari Belafonte plus three soap_opera stars and four models who shall go nameless because &quot; they would scratch my eyes out if I told you , &quot; Coleman says . Her male customers , on the other hand , aren ' t secretive . Eddie Murphy , Al Jarreau , Stevie Wonder and Larry Holmes have all ordered products . &quot; Men are some of by best clients , &quot; Coleman says . &quot; If I tell them to use the cleanser , toner moisturizer and scrub twice a day , they follow my instructions to the letter . They will not mix and match brands. &quot; Unlike her fellow skin-care chefs , Coleman is_on the lookout for investors . Just remember , she ' s the boss . Lisha Coleman ' s Natural Skin_Care Products for Men &amp; Women ; ( 213 ) 850-1087 .</TEXT>
