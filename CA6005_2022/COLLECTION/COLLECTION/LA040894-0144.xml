   <HEADLINE> MUSLIMS BALK AT_PEACE TALK WITH SERBS ; BOSNIA : GOVERNMENT IS ANGERED BY WESTERN INDIFFERENCE AS EASTERN ENCLAVE OF GORAZDE IS POUNDED BY ENEMY ARTILLERY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Angered by Western indifference to the biggest Serb rebel offensive in months , the Muslim-led government refused Thursday to discuss a proposed U.N. cease-fire with its enemies while they continued attacking the threatened eastern enclave of Gorazde . But the Bosnian government did announce a 24-hour unilateral cease-fire as a &quot; goodwill gesture , &quot; according to local media . U.N. sources cautioned that a lasting truce would only come_out of negotiations between the two sides ' military_leaders . On Thursday , Lt . Gen . Michael Rose of Britain , the U.N. commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina , shuttled between government army headquarters here and a Serb rebel base just outside Sarajevo to press his plan for bringing a halt to the fighting . But as Rose encountered resistance on both sides to the latest attempt to restore peace through diplomacy , Serb gunmen encircling Gorazde fired heavy artillery shells into the town center , and Bosnian Serb war lord Radovan Karadzic warned that he might order an all-out offensive against the enclave . &quot; If the Muslims do not immediately stop their offensive along all confrontation lines , we will order an all-out counteroffensive and then let the Security_Council help them , &quot; Karadzic was quoted by state-run Belgrade radio as saying . Karadzic has insisted in his talks with U.N. officials that his forces ' attack on Gorazde has been in response to an assault by government troops inside the enclave who are surrounded and outgunned . U.N. sources say Karadzic ' s claim of a Muslim offensive out of Gorazde is patently untrue , although some government maneuvers have been reported elsewhere in Bosnia . Aid workers for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees in Gorazde reported regular shelling , said Kris Janowski , the agency ' s Sarajevo spokesman . Almost 400 people have been killed or wounded in the offensive against Gorazde , the U.N. refugee agency reported . In his talks with Rose , Bosnian army commander Gen . Rasim Delic insisted that Serb forces withdraw from the territory recently seized around Gorazde before he would agree to meet with the Serbs to discuss a general cease-fire . But the Bosnian Serb commander , Gen . Ratko Mladic , refused to consider such a concession , according to U.N. sources . &quot; I am disappointed that the war will go_on as long as we continue to debate on this level , &quot; Rose told reporters . The government had been hoping that Rose would insist on going_to Gorazde , expecting that a first-hand view of the beleaguered conditions in the refugee-packed city of 65 # 000 would prod the United Nations to protect the town that was proclaimed a U.N.-protected &quot; safe haven &quot; nearly a year ago . French Gen . Philippe Morillon , one of Rose ' s predecessors as Bosnian U.N. commander , last year marshaled a fierce defense of another eastern enclave , Srebrenica , when it was_on the verge of being overrun by the Serbs . Rose was turned_back by Serb gunmen when he tried to visit Gorazde on Wednesday . He said he would make another attempt Saturday , but has since suggested that the cease-fire talks should take priority . The 10-day-old Serb assault on Gorazde , at a time when foreign mediators were claiming significant progress toward peace , reflects uncertainty among Serb rebel commanders about their precarious position in negotiations , now that Bosnia ' s Muslims and Croats have reconciled . U.S. officials brokered the March 1 truce and pushed the two communities to create a new Bosnian federation that has been promised at least 51 % of this former Yugoslav republic ' s territory . But the Croats and Muslims now hold less than 30 % , making the federation ' s success contingent_on the Serbs ' withdrawal from much of the land they have conquered . Serbs so far have shown no interest in joining the peace talks mediated by U.S. and Russian officials , fearing that they would be pressured into ceding territory . Instead , they have stepped_up a terror campaign against the few remaining Croats and Muslims in northwestern Bosnia and launched the offensive that has moved the rebels deep into the Gorazde enclave . Rose has sought to play_down the severity of the Serb attack on Gorazde , saying it appeared to be a strategic move to strengthen the rebels ' position in future peace talks . After blocking Rose from going_to Gorazde , Serb leaders asked him to call a meeting between the two sides ' military commanders to consider a Bosnia-wide truce . Government officials here contend that the Serbs ' appeal for new talks is simply a delaying tactic to allow them to press their assault on Gorazde without U.N. interference -- a claim given some credibility by the failure of Mladic , the Bosnian Serb commander , to show_up for the airport meeting that Karadzic insisted Rose arrange . Rose sought to put the best face on his failure to bring either side to discuss a cease-fire . His staff issued a statement saying Rose had presented both sides with a draft cease-fire plan and was giving them a &quot; brief period for reflection. &quot; But the statement made clear that both government and Serb military commanders still refuse to meet face-to-face , casting doubt on the prospects for an imminent breakthrough .</TEXT>
