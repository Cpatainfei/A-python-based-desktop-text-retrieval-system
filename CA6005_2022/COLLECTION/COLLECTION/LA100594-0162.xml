   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO LIFT BAN ON SATELLITE TECH SALES TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration agreed Tuesday to lift year-old sanctions restricting the sale of U.S. satellite technology to China after obtaining a renewed , more explicit commitment from Beijing to stop exporting dangerous missiles . The agreement , announced at the end of a visit to Washington by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen , clears the way for U.S. companies , including Hughes Aircraft Co. , to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in satellites and related technology to China . If it is carried_out , the agreement will also settle what has been , over the past six years , one of the most contentious issues between Washington and Beijing : China ' s efforts to export to Middle Eastern countries its advanced , solid-fuel M-9 and M-11 missiles , which are more accurate and more mobile than the Scuds used by Iraq in the Persian_Gulf_War . Clinton_Administration officials were exultant . &quot; This is a global and verifiable ban ( on export of M-11 missiles ) , &quot; said one senior Administration official . Administration officials pointed_out that the prohibition China signed for the M-11 missiles goes beyond the requirements of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) -- the international accord that severely restricts the export of missiles but permits some limited exceptions . In some respects , however , the new agreement also represents a retreat from the position the Clinton_Administration took a year ago . Senior U.S. officials said then they would not lift the sanctions on satellite exports to China until Beijing agreed to adhere to the MTCR -- including all its rules , updates and revisions , which cover a wide variety of technology beyond the M-11 missile exports . Yet in the end , the Administration , which recently won Russia ' s agreement to adhere to the missile accord , failed to win a similar pledge from China on the broader treaty . Instead , the two nations agreed Tuesday to hold &quot; in-depth discussions &quot; on having China adhere to the overall missile accord . &quot; The lifting of the sanctions is a welcome development , &quot; Hughes Aircraft Co . Chairman C . Michael Armstrong said in a written statement Tuesday night . &quot; It will enable Hughes and American industry to do more business with China . This is a positive step as we revise our export policies to enhance trade. &quot; Administration officials contended that the new agreement was not motivated by a desire to help U.S. companies . &quot; This is not an economic decision , &quot; said one senior Administration official . &quot; This is a non-proliferation decision. &quot; America ' s efforts to stop the sale of Chinese M-9 and M-11 missiles dates to 1988 , when it was reported that Beijing had concluded deals to sell the systems to Iran , Iraq , Syria and Libya . Then-Defense Secretary Frank C . Carlucci won some vague assurances from China about limiting sales of the missiles on a trip to Beijing in 1988 , and in return agreed to clear the way for the sale of American satellite technology to China . In 1989 , then-National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft won new promises not to sell missiles in the Middle_East . But China ' s efforts to export apparently continued and it began moving to sell M-11 missiles to Pakistan . In November , 1991 , the George_Bush Administration finally won what it felt was a solid commitment by China to abide_by the MTCR and to refrain_from selling the missiles to Pakistan . This pledge , hastily worked_out at the end of a testy visit to Beijing by Secretary_of_State James A . Baker III , took the form of an oral pledge and a subsequent letter . The MTCR applies only to missiles with a range of 300 kilometers ( about 180 miles ) and a payload , or weight , of 500 kilograms ( 1100 pounds ) . U.S. officials subsequently discovered that , despite its assurances to the Bush_Administration , China was selling components of the M-11 missiles to Pakistan . Chinese officials maintained that this missile was not covered by the MTCR , because its range and payload were below the requirements of the accord . U.S. officials insisted the missile had greater capabilities than China maintained . The accord that Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher signed with Qian on Tuesday contains new language apparently closing this loophole . Any missile is covered so_long as it has enough energy to travel the required 180-mile distance or deliver the 1 # 100-pound payload , even if China claimed it had been advertised or tested at lower standards . Administration officials also said China ' s new promise was better than the ones obtained by previous Administrations because it took the form of a signed , written agreement rather than an oral pledge or letter . Qian agreed . Asked at a news_conference how China ' s new promise differs from earlier ones , Qian replied : &quot; This is the first time China and the United States have recorded and issued a written understanding . . . . This is a new form ( of agreement ) . &quot; The Clinton_Administration had imposed the satellite sanctions on China in August , 1993 . At the time , U.S. officials estimated that they would block the sale of about $ 400 million to $ 500 million a year in American exports to China over the two-year period of the sanctions . The sanctions blocked the pending sale of at least seven satellites to China , including two by Los Angeles-based Hughes . Those sanctions outraged some executives of U.S. high-tech industries , including Armstrong , who said in one speech : &quot; It escapes me what effect our laying_off 4 # 000 to 5 # 000 more people in California and shifting the export business to Europe has_on the Chinese. &quot; Last winter , the Administration eased the impact of the sanctions by deciding that some satellites could be sold to China if they do not include sensitive military technology . The two Hughes systems were then approved for_sale , along with several other items of satellite technology . State_Department officials said the new agreement opens the way again for American companies to sell new systems to China by reapplying to the State_Department for permission . Clinton_Administration officials also announced that China had agreed to some new discussions and exchanges with the United States in the field of human_rights . Chinese officials agreed to broader exchanges of lawyers and other legal personnel , Administration officials said . China also agreed to resume talks that were suspended earlier this year on its jamming of Voice of America broadcasts and on permitting the International Committee of the Red_Cross to gain access to Chinese prisons .</TEXT>
