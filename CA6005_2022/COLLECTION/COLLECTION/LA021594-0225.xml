   <HEADLINE> GUNMAN AT TORRANCE HOTEL KILLS 2 POLICEMEN ; VIOLENCE : VICTIMS WERE VETERANS OF THE PALOS VERDES ESTATES DEPARTMENT . THEIR ASSAILANT DIES IN THE INCIDENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Brandishing two handguns and yelling , &quot; This is a robbery ! &quot; a masked gunman opened_fire on a police motivational seminar at a Holiday Inn in Torrance on Monday , killing two suburban policemen before he was subdued and later pronounced dead , authorities said . Two veterans of the Palos Verdes Estates Police_Department -- Capt . Mike Tracy , 50 , of Redondo Beach , and Sgt . Tom Vanderpool , 57 , of Torrance -- were shot to death in the 3:50 p.m. attack , police said . The 32-year-old assailant , whose name was not released pending notification of his family was taken_to Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance , were he was pronounced dead , police said . Officials said there were some similarities between the gunman , a young Asian , and a suspect in the shooting of a Manhattan Beach officer two months ago . Witnesses said the shootings occurred as 13 police and city officials from the upscale South Bay community of Palos Verdes Estates were wrapping_up an all-day meeting in the hotel ' s 12th-floor meeting room . The deaths were the first fatalities in the history of the tight-knit , 35-member department . The seminar , which was to have lasted two days , was sponsored by the city , and attended by the top brass of the Police_Department and City_Hall , said City_Manager Jim Hendrickson , who was among those seated around the square conference_table . Officials said it was unclear whether the attacker knew he was shooting at law_enforcement officers . All the police at the seminar were in plainclothes . And the session was identified at the hotel only as a Palos Verdes Estates meeting , without specifying police involvement . In the midst of the seminar , Torrance Police Sgt . Dave Smith said , the door burst open and a man stepped into the room , his face obscured by a fencing_mask and hooded sweat shirt , his chest thickened by the bulk of a bulletproof_vest . When he announced that he planned to rob the group , Smith said , one officer stood and was immediately shot . Then , when the second officer stood to come_to the aid of the wounded man , the attacker fired on him . Hendrickson , who was sitting with his back to the door , said events unfolded so quickly that at first he believed the gunman was joking , and so did most of the officers . Vanderpool , a 13-year veteran of the department , stood and said &quot; in earthy language , ' I ' m not going_to take this , ' &quot; Hendrickson said . The gunman fired two or three times , hitting Vanderpool in the chest , Hendrickson said . &quot; None of us comprehended that this was real , &quot; he said . &quot; The sounds went pop-pop-pop. &quot; Then as Tracy rushed to the sergeant ' s aid , the gunman fired again , hitting Tracy in the chest , as three or four other police_officers leaped across the table and pinned the gunman to a wall , Hendrickson said . Smith , whose department is investigating the incident , would not say how the gunman died . Hospital officials , saying they were acting at the behest of Torrance police , refused to divulge the cause of the gunman ' s death . Palos Verdes Estates Police_Chief Gary Johansen , who was at the meeting , said he did not know how the man died , but he did not hear him being shot . &quot; Nobody had a chance to get their guns , &quot; Johansen said , adding that &quot; the assailant was fighting something fierce . I don ' t know if he was beaten -- he still had a gun in his hand. &quot; Officials said they do not know why the gunman chose that meeting room . &quot; It was a regular business meeting . They were wearing regular attire and that ' s the key , &quot; Smith said . &quot; We don ' t know at this point if ( the gunman ) knew who they were or not. &quot; Both Smith and detectives at the Manhattan Police_Department said they are investigating the possibility that the shooting may be linked to the fatal attack two months ago on another South Bay police_officer , Martin Ganz of the Manhattan Beach Police_Department . Ganz , 29 , was shot to death Dec . 27 during a seemingly routine traffic stop . Assigned to a holiday drunk-driving abatement patrol , investigators said , he had used his patrol_car loudspeaker to pull over a Daihatsu Charade in front of a Manhattan Beach mall about 11 p.m. , and was shot when he got_out of the car . A witness to the shooting -- the officer ' s 13-year-old nephew who happened to be with him on a department sponsored ride-along -- said the gunman was a heavyset Asian in his 30s , a description that fits the killer in Monday ' s attack . The incident was a stunning blow to the placid seaside community of Palos Verdes Estates . Vanderpool and Tracy were well-known veterans of the department , with 13 and 25 years , respectively , on the force . Vanderpool was the oldest member of the department and Tracy at one point was a contender for the job of police_chief , officials said . Each leaves_behind three grown children . Tracy was a grandfather , friends said . Monday was Vanderpool ' s wedding_anniversary . One grief-stricken colleague described them as &quot; everybody ' s friends. &quot; Johansen lauded the heroism of the two men . The gunman , Johansen said , &quot; probably did not know the room was_full of cops , but we are sure that when he found_out , he would have killed everyone in the room if given a chance . Capt . Mike Tracy and Sgt . Tom Vanderpool didn ' t give him that chance . Their unselfish valor saved every_other officer in that room. &quot; Times staff writers Nieson Himmel , Eric Malnic and Ted Johnson and correspondent Charles Hillinger contributed to this report .</TEXT>
