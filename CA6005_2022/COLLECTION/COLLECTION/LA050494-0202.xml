   <HEADLINE> SENNA ' S DEATH MIGHT BE TREATED AS A HOMICIDE ; AUTO RACING : SAFETY OF IMOLA TRACK IN ITALY CALLED INTO QUESTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While Ayrton Senna ' s technical crew studied the information in the &quot; black_box &quot; data-logging system from the Formula One car in which the former world champion was killed Sunday at Imola , Italy , Italian authorities said Tuesday that the death might be treated as a possible homicide . Federico Bendinelli , managing director of the company that owns the Imola track , was told by police that he was being investigated , based on the possibility that the notoriously fast Imola track played a role in the crashes during the weekend of the Grand Prix of San Marino . Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger also died in a crash during Saturday ' s qualifying . Race organizers said they could not comment while the investigation continued , and officials of the FIA , the sport ' s international governing body , said the track passed a safety check last week . The English Williams-Renault team for which Senna drove was trying to find an answer in the black_box , hoping the computerized data it contained would provide a clue as_to why Senna failed to turn left at the Tamburello curve and instead went head-on into a concrete barrier at about 180 m.p.h. &quot; The team wishes to point_out that any theories from any source as_to the cause of Ayrton Senna ' s accident are pure speculation , &quot; Williams said in a statement . &quot; A thorough investigation is being undertaken utilizing the available data. &quot; Williams , however , was still unable to examine the wreckage from the car , which has been impounded by Italian authorities . The Simtek Ford team also was examining data in the black_box from Ratzenberger ' s car , although television replays indicated a mechanical problem had caused his crash . Williams and Simtek will present their findings to FIA , which has scheduled a meeting in Paris today to review the events . At the Bologna airport , Italian police lined the pathway and presented arms as Senna ' s coffin was loaded onto a plane for the trip to his hometown of Sao Paulo , Brazil . Earlier , about 500 mourners had stood silently outside the city morgue as an autopsy was performed . Traffic was blocked , and some people fainted . Medical officials made no statement after the autopsy , although the Italian news_agency , ANSA , reported that doctors had ruled_out sudden illness before the crash . Meanwhile , the tributes continued . Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro , in a telegram to Brazilian President Itamar Franco , mourned the driver ' s death , expressing disapproval that the race was not stopped after the crash . Luca di Montezemolo , president of Ferrari , wrote in an Italian newspaper , &quot; Senna was the greatest for all_of us , one of the greatest of all time. &quot; In Sao Paulo , Franco decreed three days of national mourning and ordered flags flown at half staff . He also decreed that Senna posthumously receive the Grand Cross of Merit , one of Brazil ' s highest awards . Senna ' s body is expected to arrive in Sao Paulo today . A fire_truck will carry his coffin from the airport to the state legislature building , where the body will lie_in state until burial Thursday . Police hope huge crowds of fans will not jam the airport and the 25-mile route to the legislature .</TEXT>
