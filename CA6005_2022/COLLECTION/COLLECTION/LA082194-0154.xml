   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / ROBERT H . SULNICK : CONSTITUTION FACES A TRIPLE THREAT ; UNDER THE GUISE OF FISCAL LIMITS , A MOVEMENT IS ATTEMPTING TO PERVERT OUR RIGHTS , THREATENING OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is a movement growing in our nation ' s capital that all citizens should be aware of . The insiders call it the &quot; triple threat. &quot; It is a well-funded , highly organized movement supported by the radical right , developers , the petrochemical industry , private-property extremists and state and local_governments opposed to federal mandates . This movement is about fundamentally changing constitutional democracy as we know it . The backdoor techniques being used include a redefinition of a &quot; taking &quot; under the Fifth_Amendment and attacks on the equal-protection clause of the 14th Amendment through the concepts of unfunded mandates and cost-benefit and comparative risk analysis . The Fifth_Amendment provides that the government may_not &quot; take &quot; private_property for public use -- to build highways , dams , airports , etc . -- without just compensation . When there is a dispute regarding the price , the parties resolve their differences in court . A &quot; takings &quot; amendment is now being attached_to environmental , health , civil_rights , labor and education bills pending before Congress . The amendment would distort this time-honored provision so that pollution prevention laws would become defined as a &quot; taking , &quot; thereby allowing such scenarios : * Factory owners could pollute unless paid by the federal_government to halt their actions . * Local zoning ordinances changed to comply with federal health and safety laws that require industrial development to be separate from residential neighborhoods would be considered a &quot; taking. &quot; This would result either in invalidation of zoning laws or residential property_owners ' being compensated by the government for the commercial value of their real_estate . * The insurance industry and doctors could claim that lost profits related to health-care legislation are a &quot; taking , &quot; and therefore warrant reimbursement by the federal_government . Unfunded-mandate amendments , like &quot; takings &quot; amendments , are an attempt to exaggerate the Constitution to_the_point of perversion . This attack is against the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment . Fundamental to our form_of_government is the principle that all citizens , irrespective of where they live , are entitled to equal protection under the law . The unfunded-mandates concept would inhibit any uniform federal application of law to states , unless the federal_government pays_for the full price of implementing the law . This could yield the following results : * If Congress passes health-care reform that includes an employer mandate to provide insurance , state and local_governments would not need to comply unless Washington paid its share of the employees ' coverage . * If Congress passes a safe drinking-water act requiring all states to upgrade their tap-water standards , states could be exempt unless the federal_government paid_for upgrading their water_systems . * If the federal_government increases the minimum_wage , the increase could not go_into effect for employees working for state and local_governments unless Washington paid_for the increase . Another attempt to erode constitutional rights is being made through cost-benefit and comparative-risk analysis . This is an economic technique that attempts to put a dollar value on every potential benefit derived from a federal law . For example , in a recent EPA analysis on water-pollution rules , the risk of children developing learning disabilities from exposure to lead was weighed against the cost of removing the lead from the environment . In so doing , EPA attributed a cost of $ 4 # 588 per lowered IQ point to children suffering lead-related learning disabilities , compared with the tangible hard costs of removing lead from the environment . How can anyone place a dollar value on a child ' s health ? Any standards enacted on this basis would be arbitrary and excessive and stand to deprive people of their right to equal protection under the law . This concept , if enacted into law , would produce a &quot; paralysis by analysis &quot; in federal_government . It would require an analysis and estimate of the prospective impact of all federal legislation and regulations on the private sector and on government . Even though these amendments are being justified in terms of economic hardship during recessionary times , they are simply a surreptitious attempt remove the federal_government from its role as protector of equal rights for all citizens . We must clearly communicate to our elected officials our disapproval of this threat before they are tyrannized into destroying constitutional rights in the name of &quot; fiscal responsibility. &quot;</TEXT>
