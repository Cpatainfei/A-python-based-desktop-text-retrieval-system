   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE ; CAN A BAD BOOK_REVIEW RUIN A WRITING CAREER ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Aug . 18 , 1989 , William Morrow &amp; Co . published my fourth book , &quot; Interference : How Organized Crime Influences Professional Football. &quot; It contained well-documented charges of the Mafia ' s penetration into the multibillion-dollar world of professional_football , including new information on illegal gambling and fixed games . Anticipating a public-relations problem , the National Football_League had attacked me seven months before the book ' s release . Yet , no libel suits were either threatened or filed against &quot; Interference. &quot; No source quoted in the book denied the accuracy of his or her quote . But as I wrote in my book ' s prologue , the NFL , upon publication , &quot; will remain aloof from the charges , deny them from afar , and then send its front_line of defense , the loyal sportswriters , to attack the messenger. &quot; On Sept . 3 , 1989 , the week before the NFL season began , Gerald Eskenazi , a New York Times sportswriter who has covered the NFL for three decades , reviewed my book for the newspaper ' s Book_Review . In his article , Eskenazi grossly misrepresented the facts in my book , concluding that it contained &quot; sloppy journalism , &quot; a charge that , if true , could end a nonfiction author ' s career . The reviewer , however , based his opinion on a series of provably false assertions -- i.e. , he made statements of fact that were simply not true . Eskenazi claimed I stated facts that I never did , or that I omitted other facts that were clearly in my book . For example , as New York magazine observed : &quot; ( Eskenazi charges that ) : ' ( Moldea ) revives the discredited notion that Carroll Rosenbloom . . . met foul_play when he drowned in Florida 10 years ago. ' In fact , Moldea interviewed witnesses who were at the scene , obtained the autopsy photos and concluded on Page 360 of ' Interference ' : ' Rosenbloom died in a tragic accident and was not murdered. ' &quot; Writing for the Columbia Journalism Review , Christopher Hanson stated : &quot; Moldea has reason to be upset . . . ( A ) fter comparing what the book says with what the review says it says , one might conclude that Eskenazi was some distance from Pulitzer territory. &quot; After reading Eskenazi ' s review , I wrote to him and asked_for a retraction , citing his errors . He did not reply . I retained an attorney who called the Times ' chief in-house counsel and asked_for a correction . The Times refused . It is worth noting that two years earlier , in April , 1987 , the Times had been forced to print a correction regarding a previous review of my work . In an effort to defend myself , I wrote to the editor of the Book_Review , who never responded . I then tried to get my side of the story out through another publication , but no one gave me the opportunity . To this day , not one reporter has done a story that simply compares what the book says vs . what the Times said it says . Unfortunately , a lawsuit became my only means of self-defense . In August , 1990 , after countless publishers , agents and colleagues , among others , continued to throw this false review in my face , I retained attorney Roger C . Simmons , who took my case on a contingency-fee basis . After notifying the Times that we were about to sue and still receiving no response , a suit was filed with the U.S. District Court in Washington . We charged that publication of the review had destroyed my career . Our case piggybacked the June , 1990 , U.S. Supreme Court decision , Milkovich vs . Lorain Journal , which stated , in part , that published opinions may be libelous if they are based on provably false facts . The Times immediately engaged our suit , filing a motion for summary_judgment , proclaiming that this litigation jeopardized the &quot; robust exchange of views in the marketplace of ideas. &quot; Certainly , the Times ' refusal to publish my letter to the editor , which would have completely averted the suit , denied me the opportunity to participate in this &quot; exchange of views. &quot; Since the suit was filed , editorials and Op-Ed columns have relentlessly portrayed me as a thin-skinned author with &quot; a wounded ego &quot; who simply received a bad review and , thus , retained a top-legal gun to challenge the right of all reviewers and opinion writers to state their opinions freely and fully . This is not true . As a longtime writers ' rights activist , I resent being forced to deny such a charge . In January , 1992 , U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn -- in a narrow view of Milkovich -- granted the Times ' motion and dismissed our case . Then , on Feb . 18 , 1994 , after six months of study and debate , the federal appellate_court overturned Penn ' s ruling . The result was an avalanche of editorials and Op-Ed columns fiercely condemning and misrepresenting the ruling . Completely ignored in all these articles was the key passage of the appellate opinion : &quot; We certainly do not mean to suggest that all bad reviews are actionable . We do hold , however , that assertions that would otherwise be actionable in defamation are not transmogrified into non-actionable statements when they appear in the context of a book review. &quot; Essentially , the appellate_court stated that opinion writers should be held to the same standard of accuracy and honesty as news reporters . Then on May 3 , the appellate_court inexplicably reversed itself . Without the benefit of any new evidence , legal precedent or oral argument -- but following the firestorm of editorial and Op-Ed criticism of their first decision -- the same judges wrote : &quot; Indeed , some bad reviews may be written with an aim to damage a writer ' s reputation . There is nothing that we can do about this , at least without unacceptably interfering with free speech. &quot; In effect , the appellate_court , in its virtually unprecedented act , created an exemption from libel for opinion writers when they engage in &quot; mischievous intent , &quot; as the court now calls it . News reporters and nonfiction authors have no such exemption and continue to be held to a &quot; malice &quot; standard . Under this double_standard of journalism , readers will never be sure whether a published opinion is based on real facts -- because opinion writers have no responsibility to be accountable for what they write . Essentially , the court of appeals -- in a decision that will surely be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court -- has done nothing less than declare an open season for unchecked criticism on authors and their published works . In a May 7 editorial , the New York Times self-righteously concluded that the appellate_court ' s second opinion safeguarded &quot; spirited argument , &quot; adding : &quot; The whole society , freer to speak and argue about matters of public concern , is the winner. &quot; Again , the Times ' failure to publish my letter to the editor in response to a false and misleading review of &quot; Interference &quot; -- as well as my reply to its May 7 editorial -- have denied me the opportunity to participate in &quot; spirited argument. &quot; This is not journalism ; this is corporate tyranny. *</TEXT>
