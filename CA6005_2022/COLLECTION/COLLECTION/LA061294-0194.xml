   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; REELING IN THE PAST ; PRESERVATION : THOUSANDS OF OLD FILMS MAY BE GONE WITH THE WINDS OF TIME BECAUSE OF CHEMICAL DETERIORATION . BUT UCLA ' S ARCHIVE IS TRYING TO SAVE THE BEST OF THEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hunting through a Warner Brothers film vault three years ago , Bob Gitt , chief preservationist of the UCLA film and television archive , came_across what looked_like a gem . there , amid piles of corroded film canisters and dusty shelving , sat a 12-reel original print of &quot; The Divine Lady. &quot; A long-lost , Academy Award-winning work of 1929 , the film featured one of the period ' s great beauties , Corinne Griffith . It portrayed the romance between Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton , all spliced between sea battles ( off Catalina Island ) . With great excitement , Gitt ripped open each can -- only to find a sticky brown powder , the residue of deteriorated nitrate film stock . Of the 12 reels , only two could be salvaged . Such disappointment is familiar to movie historians and archivists . Experts say that of the 21 # 000 Hollywood-produced shorts and feature_films made before 1950 on nitrate stock , the primary material of the period , about half have been lost forever , including 90 % of all silent_movies . Perhaps the problem is most evident at UCLA ' s film and television archive , the world ' s largest repository of feature_films next to the Library of Congress . In the archive ' s cinema department , an underfunded team of three specialists has had to resort_to an unnerving triage to decide which of the thousands of films are most in need of preservation for future generations . &quot; Many of our films are under siege , and as the years go_by the process is accelerating , &quot; Gitt said . &quot; We ' re doing the best we can and preserving the most important rare films . But we can ' t always predict what people will think is important in 30 years. &quot; The effort is considered crucial , particularly given the growing historical importance of visual media . Some experts suggest that , one day , historians will rely_on moving images as much as on the printed word to understand 20th-Century culture . &quot; The UCLA archive is truly staggering in terms of its cultural significance , but is still viewed_as a nonessential specialty , &quot; said Michael Friend , director of the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences Film Archive . &quot; Film resources are as integral as books but are not recognized as the art_form of our times. &quot; UCLA ' s Film and Television Archive holds about 40 # 000 short films and feature titles in the old Technicolor plant , now called the Television Center Building , on the corner of Romaine and Cahuenga avenues in Hollywood . In addition , the archive houses about 27 million feet of Hearst Metrotone newsreel footage and more_than 40 # 000 television_programs and titles . The archive ' s feature_film department was founded in 1972 after Paramount donated a large_number of its old nitrate-film prints to UCLA . Prints from Twentieth Century Fox , Warner Brothers , Republic and RKO Pictures soon followed . The archive began a television collection in 1965 in association with the Academy of Television Arts and Science . The feature-film collection includes camp classics ; movies considered important for artistic , historical or technological reasons , and &quot; orphan films &quot; -- features discarded by studios or original prints donated by a director ' s widow , for example . The archive also receives prints from independent and retired producers , celebrities and private collectors , and it borrows films from archives all_over the world . Staffers also hunt for obscure movies in forgotten studio vaults and warehouses and act_on tips from movie aficionados . In the archive ' s cool , dark corridors , roughly 10 # 000 nitrate films are stored in 60 double-door vaults on three floors . A separate section of the building houses about 30 # 000 acetate-based films , a stock widely used after 1950 . Many of the acetate-based films are in need of preservation , but that stock is slightly more durable than the older nitrate-based films , which have spawned the preservationists ' caveat : &quot; Nitrate won ' t wait. &quot; In all , Gitt says , about 400 feature_films , 5 # 000 hours of newsreels and about 300 videotaped television titles are in urgent need of preservation at UCLA . The archive is concentrating most of its limited resources on its huge -- and aging -- feature_film collection , mindful that an increasing number of titles will require attention every year . Features on the center ' s critical list include Gene Autry ' s 1946 film &quot; Sioux_City Sue &quot; ; &quot; Shantytown , &quot; a 1943 movie_starring John Archer and Marjorie Lord ; a late ' 20s short titled &quot; A Day With Jack Dempsey , &quot; and the complete 12-film Sherlock_Holmes series made by Universal Pictures from 1942 to 1946 . Gitt says one movie in the series , &quot; Sherlock_Holmes and the Spider Woman , &quot; has suffered significant nitrate deterioration on three of its seven reels . The projects are among many cinematic rescue efforts under way at the archive . The center ' s three feature_film technicians manage to preserve or restore only about 25 shorts and 15 longer features per year -- a pace , they admit , that does not match the deterioration rate of movie footage . &quot; When I first started working here , I felt awful , &quot; said Jere Guldin , the archive ' s vault manager . &quot; There are certain things you just can ' t save. &quot; Preservation means lengthening the life of a film , often by transferring a movie from nitrate stock to longer-lasting acetate or polyester film . Restoration involves the enhancement of an inferior or incomplete original print so a copy can be made . Many old films require both types of this work , which is arduous and expensive . Gitt estimates that the cost of preserving and restoring a 90-minute black_and_white film is about $ 20 # 000 and can exceed $ 60 # 000 for a color feature . The archive ' s vinyl-gloved technicians must remove all dirt and grit on the film with razor blades and cut_out scratched portions with scissors . Film sprockets often need replacing and ripped splices re-gluing . New images must be edited in -- sometimes after being culled from other archives . Gitt eventually restored &quot; The Divine Lady &quot; after the Czech Film Archives found two separate prints of the film , though these were slightly damaged and speckled with Czech titles . Often sound must be enhanced and synchronized with the original track . And , throughout , extreme care must be taken with nitrate film , which is extremely flammable . &quot; You have to be passionately meticulous and sometimes it ' s difficult to just relax and enjoy the art of these films because the clock is always ticking , &quot; said Eric Aijala , a UCLA archive preservationist . &quot; I try to make_sure I get the space I need to be creative and do the detail . Otherwise , I would n ' t sleep at night. &quot; Adding_to the pressure is the difficulty of prioritizing restoration projects . Even if there ' s a consensus now on which movies merit immediate attention , there ' s also the concern that future generations may disagree . Film buffs cite film noir , a genre from the ' 50s expressing urban anxiety and paranoia , as an example of a discarded style that decades later became popular . Ironically , the UCLA archive ' s struggles come amid a surge in film restoration work by the major studios . Over the decades , as films evolved from silent to sound to color , many Hollywood studios shunted their old pictures off to warehouses . But yesterday ' s film dust has turned_into today ' s nitrate gold with the proliferation of video , pay-per-view , cable and satellite transmissions -- and the prospect of fiber-optic distribution . Programmers are now scrambling to feed the entertainment maw , hunting for -- among other things -- old films . &quot; Twenty years ago , you couldn ' t get money for film preservation , &quot; said Ralph Sargent , president of Film Technology Inc. , a Hollywood-based restoration lab . &quot; The studios now realize preserving their old films is a form of asset protection. &quot; Ted Turner ' s purchase of the MGM film library in 1986 for $ 1.3 billion was once viewed_as a gross overpayment . With the &quot; information superhighway &quot; on the nation ' s horizon , the move is now recognized to have been extremely shrewd . Turner Entertainment has already preserved and restored 20 of 115 classic MGM Technicolor films from the 1938-1953 era -- including &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; and &quot; Gone With the Wind &quot; -- at a cost of about $ 70 # 000 each , says Dick May , vice_president of Turner Entertainment , which owns the film libraries of MGM , RKO Pictures and parts of Warner Brothers . The company spends about $ 1.4 million a year on restoration and preservation , May said . &quot; Our policy is to preserve everything . We are making protection masters of our 3 # 300 feature_films , &quot; May said . &quot; Eventually we ' ll have high-definition television , and the public is becoming more knowledgeable_about a quality image . They want beautiful pictures and they deserve to be seen that way. &quot; Some studios are experimenting with advanced restoration techniques that involve transferring old film images to a digital medium , electronically enhancing them and then transferring the pictures back to 35-millimeter film . &quot; The high-end electronic technology can make images pristine , get_rid_of the scratches and blemishes . But it can be so expensive , &quot; said Phil Murphy , an archivist for Paramount Pictures . &quot; Completing 10 minutes of film can cost $ 250 # 000. &quot; Murphy said that in the past six years , Paramount has made two sets of negatives of all 900 of its studios ' films , storing each print in separate , refrigerated and humidity-controlled vaults , one on each coast . The UCLA archive , however , has far fewer resources for restoration than the studios do , so expensive , high-tech film rescue projects must be chosen carefully . Archivists say that until the costs of technology come_down , which could take years , their technicians are stuck_with the time-consuming dirty work of manual repair . UCLA ' s preservation efforts receive thousands of dollars a year from such sources as Martin Scorcese , the David and Lucille Packard Foundation , Sony Pictures Entertainment , the Mary Pickford Foundation and Hugh Hefner . Sometimes the studios sponsor a joint project with the archive . Other funding comes from the university and from government grants . But with an annual budget of only $ 350 # 000 for feature_film preservation , the archive ' s resources pale in comparison to the task . Bob Rosen , director of the UCLA Film Archive , says it would cost $ 50 million to save all_the archive ' s endangered features . &quot; The cost of two big-budget movies or a B-1 bomber would cover it , &quot; he said . With thousands of titles needing prompt attention , he added , time could run_out . Said Rosen : &quot; Five hundred years from now , people will look_back on this century , the century that discovered film , and ask , ' Why didn ' t they take better care ? ' &quot;</TEXT>
