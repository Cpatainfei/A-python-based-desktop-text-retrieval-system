   <HEADLINE> WHILE OTHERS SPUTTER , NISSAN RACES FORWARD ; AUTOS : THE POPULAR ALTIMA HELPED THE FIRM ' S U.S. UNIT SHOW AN 18 % SALES SURGE IN 1993 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While import auto_makers are licking their wounds as 1994 begins , there is one Japanese company whose U.S. arm is flourishing in the face of stiff competition from the Big Three . Nissan Motor Corp . U.S.A. reported an 18 % increase in sales last year -- far better than those reported by resurgent Ford Motor Co . and General Motors Corp . Only Chrysler Corp. , with a 20 % sales improvement , did better . Nissan is the only Japanese auto_maker to increase its share of the U.S. market last year , reaching 4.9 % from 4.5 % in 1992 . Its popular Altima mid-size sedan was the top-selling new model in 1993 , besting Chrysler ' s highly touted LH series . Not counting the separate luxury models , Nissan even supplanted Honda as the second-highest import seller , behind Toyota . &quot; We are back in the game in the consumer ' s mind , &quot; said Bob Thomas , president and chief_executive of Nissan ' s U.S. subsidiary . These accomplishments were achieved despite the serious financial problems afflicting Nissan ' s Tokyo-based parent . It also came_in spite of adverse currency fluctuations . Those problems have taken their toll . The company laid_off nearly 400 white-collar workers nationwide last year and dismissed its top U.S. official at its headquarters in Torrance , replacing him with a more compliant Thomas . Nissan has tried to counteract the rise of the yen -- which increases the cost of_importing cars and parts -- by increasing production at its assembly_plant in Smyrna , Tenn. , and buying more parts from American suppliers . While this has helped , the real seeds of Nissan ' s rebound were sown in the mid-1980s , when the company was as a niche player best known for its sporty cars . To survive , Nissan decided to change its image by moving_into mainstream sedans , sport utility vehicles and minivans . It had some success in 1989 with its restyled near-luxury Maxima sedan . Nissan also gained some attention with its upscale Pathfinder sport utility vehicle . Then , in 1992 , the company introduced the sleek Altima sedan and stylish Quest minivan . &quot; The key to Nissan ' s success has been the Altima , &quot; said Susan Jacobs , an automotive consultant for Jacobs &amp; Associates in New Jersey . &quot; It was_well launched and well executed. &quot; Most important , the Altima was priced attractively . While smaller than the Toyota Camry and Ford Taurus , it is also priced below them . The base-price Altima is still about $ 14 # 000 . Nissan sold nearly 134 # 000 Altimas in 1993 . By comparison , it sold only 73 # 000 Stanzas -- the car the Altima replaced -- in 1991 , the last year of full production . Earl Hesterberg , general_manager of the Nissan division , said the Altima has helped generate new traffic in showrooms . No longer are sports_car enthusiasts the only ones interested in Nissan . He notes that nearly half of first-time Nissan buyers are now women . That broadened appeal also helped boost Pathfinder and Quest sales . Even though the design of the Pathfinder is aging and it is expensive for a utility vehicle , the company enjoyed a 33 % increase in sales last year . The company sold nearly as_many Quests , a minivan built_in Avon Lake , Ohio , alongside Mercury-Lincoln ' s Villager . In 1993 , Nissan sold 44 # 600 Quests and 48 # 700 Pathfinders . At the same time , the company enjoyed improved sales of the upscale Maxima and compact Sentra . A new Maxima will be introduced in May , with a new Sentra likely to follow next year . &quot; Nissan was there with the right products at the right time , &quot; said George Magliano , analyst with WEFA Group in New York . &quot; They were able to move with the economic recovery when other imports couldn ' t. &quot; The question is whether Nissan can maintain the momentum . But with the strong yen and Nissan ' s troubles in Japan , it may be difficult to hold_the_line on prices . Nissan has already raised prices twice since introducing 1994 models in September . On average , the company has hiked prices $ 1 # 144 , or 7.2 % , in the last four months . And , with Nissan ' s parent company in the throes of a painful restructuring , the pressure to do more with less is likely to grow . The Tokyo-based company is expected to lose up_to $ 370 million in the fiscal_year ending March 31 . &quot; We feel more pressure than ever to contribute more profit to the company worldwide , &quot; Hesterberg said . Company officials say it will be difficult to repeat last year ' s performance , but they hope to see sales increase at least 5 % in 1994 . Chris Cedergren , an analyst with AutoPacific Group in Santa Ana , believes Nissan will continue to thrive in the U.S. market . He said the yen is likely to weaken slightly and that leasing programs can mitigate price increases . &quot; They have strong products and more coming_in the next 2 1 / 2 years , &quot; Cedergren said . &quot; The future looks bright for Nissan. &quot; Nissan ' s Year U.S. SALES JUMP... Nissan ' s U.S. car and truck sales increased 18 % in 1993 , compared to an industry-wide jump of 8.5 % . Only Chrysler reported a higher percentage sales increase . 1984 : 689 # 022 1993 : 680 # 357 ...LED BY ALTIMA GAINS Strong sales of the Altima helped Nissan capture a 5.2 % market share of the mid-size sedan segment , up from 3.3 % in 1992 . 03 # 12 , 11 # 11 Model ' 93 sales ' 92 sales Altima 133 # 879 30 # 615 Maxima 86 # 794 84 # 583 Sentra 165 # 618 158 # 909 Stanza 787 50 # 993 NX 7 # 528 8 # 557 240SX 22 # 879 25 # 787 300ZX 9 # 124 9 # 628 Truck 110 # 001 120 # 184 Pathfinder 48 # 770 36 # 704 Quest 44 # 602 8 # 497 J30 21 # 494 13 # 774 Q45 12 # 255 12 # 215 G20 16 # 475 14 # 548 M30 * 157 3 # 764 * Discontinued in 1993 Source : Nissan Motor Corp .
