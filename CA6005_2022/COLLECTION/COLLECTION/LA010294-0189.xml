   <HEADLINE> ZHIRINOVSKY THREATENING TO DESTROY GERMANY , PAPER SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , angry that he was denied a German visa , threatened the destruction of Germany through World_War III should he come_to power , a German newspaper said Saturday . A Foreign Ministry spokesman would not confirm details of the Welt am Sonntag report , but he said that Zhirinovsky , through his reaction at the airport in Sofia , Bulgaria , on Wednesday , had further disqualified himself &quot; as a discussion partner. &quot; The ministry said Zhirinovsky criticized Germany at Sofia ' s airport after Bonn barred him from entering the country on the grounds that his presence could harm German state interests . Welt am Sonntag , quoting a confidential report by Bonn ' s embassy in Sofia , said Zhirinovsky also threatened to return 300 # 000 Russian troops to eastern Germany and demand stifling war reparations from Bonn should he get the opportunity . The ministry spokesman , reading a statement , said , &quot; At this occasion , he expressed himself negatively about Germany , made threats and insulted an official of the German Embassy personally. &quot; He added : &quot; Germany emphatically rejects these attacks . In addition to his earlier statements , Zhirinovsky through these remarks further disqualifies himself as a discussion partner. &quot; Zhirinovsky originally planned to fly from Sofia to Berlin but had to change his plans after Bonn blocked his entry . He was left fuming in the Sofia airport ' s VIP lounge after the Moscow flight was canceled because of an unofficial pilots ' strike . Zhirinovsky , whose Liberal Democratic Party polled strongly in last month ' s first post-Soviet elections , has dismayed Russian reformists and Western governments alike with wild calls_for restoration of the Russian empire and aggressive comments about neighboring states . Two years ago he threatened to drop nuclear bombs on Germany if it interfered in Russian affairs . Welt am Sonntag , without providing full quotes , said the diplomatic report and a tape_recording showed that Zhirinovsky threatened Germany with &quot; World_War III &quot; and its &quot; complete destruction. &quot; The article , released ahead of publication today , said the ultranationalist would not complete the Russian pullout from former Communist East_Germany should he come_to power . About 60 # 000 Russian military_personnel and family members are still stationed in eastern Germany . Moscow , which once had 380 # 000 troops stationed in East_Germany as the spearhead of the Warsaw Pact , will withdraw all its soldiers by August as part of international agreements accompanying German unification in 1990 . Zhirinovsky said he would return 300 # 000 troops to eastern Germany to back_up additional reparation claims from World_War_II that would make Germany &quot; a poor country , &quot; the article said .</TEXT>
