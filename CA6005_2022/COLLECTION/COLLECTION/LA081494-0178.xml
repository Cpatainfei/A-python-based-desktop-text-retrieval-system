   <TEXT> Looking_like a vampire desperate for a feed , Richard Grant recoils from Kim Basinger as if she were a gilt crucifix . But it ' s even worse : She ' s an airhead TV fashion reporter , closing_in for her own version of blood-sucking , the sound_bite . Decadently resplendent in fire-engine red lipstick , scarlet velvet suit , black velvet cutaway topcoat , heart-shaped blue spectacles , Grant portrays a new romantic fashion_designer loosely modeled after the provocative British designer Vivienne Westwood . His character supposedly never deigns to read fashion magazines , much less join the gawking masses at shows by the competition . But here he is in a converted Paris subway_station trying to hide in the crowd gathered for the collection premiere by an underground designer played by Forest Whitaker . ( &quot; Where else would an underground designer have a show but under ground ? &quot; chirps Basinger. ) As Grant shields his face with a velvet fedora roomy enough to plant a Christmas_tree , the brassy reporter descends , pertly badgering him on what he thinks_of Whitaker ' s &quot; recouped , deconstructed look. &quot; &quot; You cannot deconstruct a look before you construct one , &quot; Grant hisses venomously . &quot; Learn how to draw first before you start farting around with finger-paints . It ' s exactly what Schiaparelli said about Chanel : ' The damn bitch has been selling the same frock for the last 35 years. ' You can ' t go_forward backward ; you have to go_back to go forward. &quot; &quot; But . . . &quot; Basinger starts to protest futilely . &quot; I have one more thing to say to the press in_general and to you in particular , &quot; the designer spits back . &quot; How many g ' s are there in bugger_off ? &quot; Grant ' s blanched pancake makeup fairly steams and the inverted question_mark of a black forelock artfully plastered to his forehead droops slightly , as if in sympathy with his fit of frustration and disgust . &quot; My , what an artistic temperament , &quot; the reporter drawls ironically as she slinks away . &quot; Where I come from , we call it an asshole. &quot; &quot; Cut ! &quot; yells Robert Altman , his face breaking_into a grudging , crooked grin . &quot; Good , very good , tres bien . &quot; But the two cameras continue to roll , catching actors and extras unawares . It ' s a tried-and-true Altman trick . Since the actors always wear microphones , they ' re constantly &quot; on , &quot; in character -- even , perhaps especially , when the director fakes a cut . &quot; The crew picks_up all these soundtracks and how Bob will use them , we don ' t know , &quot; muses Lauren Bacall . The technique is tailor-made for this &quot; documentary feature &quot; on fashion where Basinger and Grant , Bacall , Julia Roberts , Tim Robbins , Sophia Loren , Marcello Mastroianni , Lyle Lovett , Tracey Ullman , Sally Kellerman and Danny Aiello , among others on the epic , eclectic cast , were peppered through actual shows of the Paris fall collections . A fter skewering Hollywood in &quot; The Player &quot; and turning a jaundiced eye on the exploded nuclear_family in &quot; Short Cuts , &quot; Altman is crafting a farcical portrait of yet another realm of poseurs , profiteers and genuine visionaries . &quot; Pret-a-Porter &quot; ( French for ready- to-wear ) , due for release at the end of the year , far and away his most ambitious undertaking . For 11 weeks this spring in Paris , Altman conducted his controlled_experiment in chaos theory through opera_house , airport , museum , hotel , restaurant , subway_station , chateau , designer atelier , street , bridge and , of course , fashion show runway , both real and fabricated . Altman ' s rolling revue encamped at Dior , Miyake , Gaultier , Lacroix and Rykiel . Under the high-vaulted ceiling of the Roman baths at Cluny museum , he staged a broad spoof of a show that could have been titled &quot; The Emperor ' s New Clothes. &quot; As unclothed models made their beatific glide down the runway , Altman strained to make his voice heard after the 500 actors and clamoring extras thundered into wild applause . More models , clothed this time , flocked into an opulent Parisian restaurant hosting a Bulgari jewelry opening as Altman maneuvered his actors through the party , snatching their improvised dialogue and that of guests , journalists and designers mingling about . The film , at first effusively embraced by the fashion_industry , was capriciously snubbed by a handful of influential designers and editors -- Karl Lagerfeld , Valentino , Vogue Editor Anna Wintour and Women ' s Wear Daily Publisher John Fairchild among them . &quot; These people are just paranoid , &quot; snorts Altman . &quot; They don ' t have any idea what the film is about and would never listen . They ' re all stupid , self-important people , basically . And they ' re guilty . Any time anybody says , ' I don ' t want you talking_about me , ' that means they ' ve got something to hide . Basically we don ' t care about them. &quot; The 66-year-old director is sitting behind his desk in the production office off the Champs-Elysees , looking more_than a little haggard after weeks of 14-hour days ' and nights ' shooting . Trying to make a free-form film in a country ruled by linear Cartesian thinking and rigid bureaucracy has taken its toll . &quot; I ' ve made four films here and I ' ve said each time , it ' s the last , &quot; Altman grumbles . &quot; I guess I forget all these problems. &quot; A_few days earlier , he suffered a run-in with an obnoxiously drunken government inspector and tried to throw him off the set . No Hercule Poirot , the inspector spied Tracey Ullman ' s pre-teen daughter , who was visiting the set , and leaped to the illogical deduction that the filmmaker was violating child labor laws . &quot; We had to show this inspector and his buddies the dailies to prove she was not in the film . They just harassed us terribly. &quot; There is also the maddening exasperation of communicating with the_French crew . &quot; It ' s hard enough to express abstract ideas and humor and subtleties in your own language , &quot; says the director . &quot; Having to explain in French just makes my job more difficult because I have to be so specific , and I ' m looking_for non-specific things to occur . &quot; We ' re setting_up events , then documenting them , rather than dictating what happens , like ' Nashville ' or ' MASH. ' It is written literally as it ' s being made. &quot; The actors themselves are writing and improvising a great_deal of the dialogue . &quot; If I see behavior I thought_up , I ' d get bored pretty quickly , &quot; says the director . &quot; Whatever happens one day changes the direction for what is going_to happen the next day and 20 days after that . It has a life of its own ; it ' s a living sculpture . The French crews don ' t understand that . They ' re used to doing things in a more literal way , where everything is storyboarded and laid_out . This kind of film isn ' t done that way . I do films that way , and I can almost promise you the next one is going_to be that way . This one is creating too_much anxiety. &quot; Altman first concocted his idea to do a film on fashion one rainy Paris day 10 years ago when his wife , Kathryn , dragged him to a Sonia Rykiel show . At first feigning sickness and a bit hung over , the director nonetheless shook_off his boredom . &quot; I was completely electrified , &quot; he recalls . &quot; When the music started_up , the lights went_on and the models hit the runway , I said to myself that this is fantastic theater. &quot; But deciding to do the film didn ' t mean financing was immediately forthcoming . &quot; People would ask me what ' s the movie about , what ' s the script , and I ' d say , ' It ' s about this phenomenon. ' These guys who sell this product really want simplistic things they can sell to an audience and get their money back. &quot; But the surprise success of &quot; The Player , &quot; followed by &quot; Short Cuts , &quot; which won last year ' s top prize at the Venice Film Festival , intervened ; suddenly Altman , erstwhile Hollywood pariah , was bankable again . After a series of negotiations with a number of independent producers -- and the emergence of a script and several key actors -- Miramax took_on the $ 20-million film . ' P ret-a-Porter &quot; tracks a mur der-mystery through the Paris fashion season , with as_many detours as the capital on Bastille Day . Mastroianni is eluding the cops ; Lovett is chasing models ; Rupert Everett is secretly selling_out his mother ' s fashion house ; Roberts is forced to share a hotel_room with sportswriter Robbins ; Bacall is exposing it all . And , bien sur , just about everyone is cheating_on everyone else . When asked about the movie ' s themes , Altman tries to look patient . &quot; This is not a heavy film , &quot; he replies . &quot; It ' s more related_to French farce than to French fashion . &quot; I can dress in a certain way right this minute and go_to a restaurant down the street and they ' ll let me in . . . . All I can do is turn a mirror back on them and say this is what I see. &quot; Such_as the abrasive Danny Aiello character ' s falling_asleep during a real Issey Miyake opening , then abruptly shattering the silence with a standing_ovation . &quot; All these Asian people were so polite , &quot; says Aiello , wincing at the recollection , &quot; but the_French , Germans and Americans were recoiling , saying who is this idiot ? It ' s convincing , but it ' s embarrassing as hell. &quot; Aiello , who plays a fashion buyer , charges through the film like a bargain-hunter in Macy ' s basement , repelling everyone he meets . At the Miyake show , he loudly grouses that the models &quot; are wearing lampshades on their ( expletive ) heads. &quot; At another show , he spots Harry Belafonte and shouts across the hall : &quot; Hey , Harry ! Remember me ? The West Indies ? The straw_hat ? The Shirley Temple ? Day-o , Day-y-y-o. &quot; When Altman first called to offer Aiello the role , the burly actor -- known for his portrayals as the muddled suitor in &quot; Moonstruck &quot; and the pizza-making mediator of &quot; Do the Right Thing &quot; -- had his doubts , and not only because the character was such a schmuck : He ' s also a cross-dresser . &quot; Danny was scared to death it was going_to be a whole sexual thing , &quot; Altman says , grinning . &quot; But these scenes are not what people expect them to be . The restaurant where all_the cross-dressers gather is very bourgeois and boring . We ' re not talking_about prostitutes . We ' re talking_about law-abiding , heterosexual married_men who just feel more comfortable disguised as women . At least one night a week , they let their real personality come_out and they go and have fun with it . &quot; At the first production meeting , Aiello had a foretaste of Altman ' s free-wheeling style . &quot; There we were , 30 actors , egos running rampant , and Bob is controlling this monstrosity . First thing he says is , ' I want to start off by telling you all I don ' t know what the ( expletive ) I ' m doing. ' What does that do but relax you ? Of course it ' s not true . He never makes himself seem smarter than you , but my feeling is also that he is smarter than everybody. &quot; Back on the set at Ledoyen , a Belle Epoque restaurant across the Champs-Elysees from the presidential palace , Altman is constructing a master shot of mind-boggling complexity . As the Bulgari party swirls about them , Marcello Mastroianni is grasping Sophia Loren by the elbow , urgently pleading in Italian for something that is obviously upsetting her . Her famous cleavage , tanned to a deep mahogany , heaves inside her low-cut black dress . Agitation , amusement and longing flush her face , burning away her glacial calm . Around a display_case , Sally Kellerman , playing an editor of Harper ' s Bazaar , thrusts her assistant in pursuit of blackmail snapshots photographer Stephen Rea has taken of her and other fashion editors . Meanwhile Linda Hunt , the editor of American Elle , is sidestepping questions from Lili Taylor , a New York Times investigative reporter . In one corner of the salon ballroom , the director hunches down before monitors of the two principal cameras , fixedly observing the rehearsal . He halts it in mid-stream and stalks stiff-legged over to rearrange his main players and rechoreograph their movement . &quot; Let ' s get some people through here , &quot; he shouts . &quot; And please don ' t look_at Sophia or any of the actors . Do whatever else you want , I don ' t care . It ' s a party. &quot; On occasion , Altman will rehearse a scene one way , then during the filming , will throw it a curve , knocking an already improvised situation even further off balance . Backstage after Whitaker ' s show , for example , he decided to have Aiello pick a fight with Rea ' s assistant as the horrified models and well-wishers scattered , spilling Champagne and swearing . Except for Altman and the two principal actors , no one else knew of the scene in_advance . Seated back at the monitors , Altman squirms a bit , then calls_out somewhat testily : &quot; This dialogue has got_to flow. &quot; Looking_like a Day-Glo Madame Butterfly , Rossy de Palma swans by the screen in iridescent scarlet dress with a blue butterfly vying for space amid the gold bows and baubles in her coiffure . With her magnificent Dora Maar nose , the star of &quot; Kika , &quot; &quot; Women on the Verge of a Nervous_Breakdown &quot; and other Almodovar films , is a serene vision of the surreal . Altman ' s scowl dissolves into a broad smile . He ambles over to Kellerman . &quot; Why don ' t you duck behind this case , like this , &quot; he says , demonstrating , &quot; then pop_up again . You have to hide , but you can ' t resist peeking either. &quot; Later , Kellerman , an Altman veteran since &quot; MASH , &quot; demystifies a bit of the director ' s technique . &quot; Bob will set_up a huge master ( shot ) that very few people in the world could do , squeezing everyone into one scene and getting them all heard and seen . Then he says : ' Well , this probably isn ' t going_to work anyway , so just go_ahead and do what you do . But stay in character even though you probably won ' t be_on camera. ' So you say , ' OK , I might as well go_ahead and have a good time. ' &quot; The first stage in Altman ' s ge nius lies_in persuading a smor gasbord of manifestly talented actors to sign_on , generally taking substantial salary cuts for the privilege . He casts celebrities not only to attract a wider public , but also so that audiences have an easier time keeping the characters straight . &quot; When you see Kim Basinger or Tim Robbins , you remember instantly who they ' re supposed to be , &quot; the director explains . Famously candid , Altman hooked Rea by telling him : &quot; Look , this Irish photographer is a real ( expletive ) and I haven ' t seen you play ( expletive ) really. &quot; Rea accepted instantly . In preparing_for his role , Rea borrowed his affectation of hiding behind sunglasses from fashion photographer Steven Meisel , but modeled his behavior more on U2 ' s Bono . &quot; I tried to think_of the cool guys in Ireland , &quot; Rea explains in a liquid Belfast brogue , &quot; so ( expletive ) laid-back , you know ? There ' s something amusing about that kind of vanity. &quot; Following her scene with the Times reporter , Hunt is positively buoyant as she enters the Ledoyen bar away from the filming . &quot; At last I had something scripted , &quot; she exults triumphantly . Improvising dialogue has been pure torture . &quot; My character comes_across as rather vacant . And she got that way because for the first five weeks I never had a clue of what to say . I got very good at laughing . People would talk to me and I ' d respond meaningfully : ' Ha-ah-ha-ah-ha , yes-s-s-s , ' &quot; she cackles , her shrill voice trailing dementedly . The Altman style , Hunt observes , is minimalist , to say the least . &quot; He gives you so little . He just trusts. &quot; Just before the runway scene of nude models , Altman sidles over to Whitaker to offer the barest advice . &quot; Your designer probably acts like you approve of this stuff ; it ' s more toward the way you think_about fashion. &quot; To another actor , he suggests , very simply , that he look_away bored when he ' s stuck_in one conversation . Whitaker ' s designer is based on Parisian anti-fashion outsider Xuly Bet , whose patchwork recycled clothes and headpieces tufted with blue plastic garbage bags make his giraffe-like models look as if they had dived head first into washing_machines . Wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Che Guevara stretched across his ample frame , Whitaker ' s character embodies the spy in the house of fashion , an agitator who believes clothes should be inexpensive and make people feel comfortable , not inadequate . Like his character , Whitaker lambastes most fashion as a form of brainwashing . But success brings its own pressures . &quot; It ' s difficult to be anti-fashion when you start to become part of the Establishment , &quot; he says . &quot; You start feeling the breath of the dragon. &quot; Dragon breath fairly well describes Basinger ' s fiery attack on the Emperor ' s New Clothes send-up . As the applauding crowds press forward , the Basinger commentator , dressed in a scarlet velvet flared pantsuit , seeks refuge behind ancient Roman columns and indignantly struggles for a comment . &quot; It ' s new , it ' s old , it ' s the bare look , for every man , woman and child . Is this fashion ? I don ' t think so . It ' s just a bunch of naked people . What the hell am I doing ? I have had it . You want yourself a career ? &quot; she explodes , tossing the microphone to her assistant , Chiara Mastroianni , daughter of Marcello . Watching in the wings , Altman halts the action then crosses over to Chiara . &quot; You ' re shocked , you ' re saying , ' What the hell am I supposed to do ? ' Then you take the mike. &quot; He backs_off , Basinger repeats her tirade , Chiara catches the mike as her boss storms off . &quot; We have seen tonight a statement of fashion in the profoundest sense of the word , &quot; she drones . As anyone who recalls Peter Finch ' s futile jeremiad in &quot; Network &quot; might have predicted , the enticing circle of glamour and deceit continues unbroken . If Altman is right , however , the public may soon be catching_on . &quot; The film could not have happened at a better time in history , &quot; he later argues . &quot; Because of the vast communication of CNN and so forth , fashion is being overexposed -- and exposed -- in the best sense . They can ' t fool people so_much any more . You can ' t force people to wear long skirts or short skirts . They ' ll do anything they want . &quot; The film business is worse than any of them . We make ourselves feel self-important about this great movie and this great actor and blah-blah-blah . You go_in and see these silly little stories that are just stupid . These companies are all going_to have to turn_back to the artist because this stuff they ' re doing is silly and people just aren ' t going_to see it. &quot; Altman stands_up to go . With bemused world-weariness , the director gives a philosophic shrug of the shoulders . &quot; Things constantly change , &quot; he says , waving his hand in an airy oblique gesture . &quot; We ' re all turned_into carbon in that respect. &quot; Fashion , film , and other ephemera -- these too shall pass -- but &quot; Pret-a-Porter &quot; seems likely to stamp its own whimsical mark on all these inimitable follies. *</TEXT>
