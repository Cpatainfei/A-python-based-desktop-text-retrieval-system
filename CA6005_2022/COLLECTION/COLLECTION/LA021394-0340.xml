   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE ROAD TO RECOVERY ; ANXIETY LINGERS FOR VICTIMS OF RUPTURED PIPELINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ever since the Northridge quake , Rachel Hayes has tried to convince her 3-year-old daughter Rosanna that it is safe to leave her aunt ' s house in Lake Elsinore and return to her home on Wolfskill Street in Mission Hills . But the subject only brings_back terrifying memories for the child . &quot; She still cries on the phone when we talk to her , &quot; Hayes said . &quot; She says ' Mommy , clean_up the house , but move it away. ' &quot; Like many residents on this quiet street , Rosanna ' s quake anxieties were aggravated by memories of the nightmarish explosions and fires caused by a quake-ruptured oil_pipeline under Wolfskill Street . Now added_to that anxiety are the less emotional concerns of some about the headaches of reaching damage settlements with the pipeline owners . After igniting , the crude_oil fueled two massive walls of flame that raced down the street and put some in mind of an earthly hell . The blaze injured one man , destroyed a house , damaged three other homes and burned 17 vehicles and dozens of trees . &quot; The earthquake , that ' s no problem , &quot; said Hayes , a discount_store employee . &quot; But that and the street being_on fire . . . it was too much. &quot; For several of Hayes ' neighbors , the fears will persist as long as the 1920-era pipeline owned by the Atlantic Richfield Co . continues to operate beneath Wolfskill Street and near adjacent O ' Melveny Elementary School . &quot; We are scared that another quake is going_to come_along and burn the house , &quot; said Luz Becerra , who watched a car catch_fire and explode in front of her home on the corner of Wolfskill Street and Rincon Avenue . In the hope of preventing future disasters , officials from Los Angeles and the neighboring city of San Fernando are trying to get the pipeline moved_out of the neighborhood and away from the school . &quot; Anybody who witnessed the fire that I witnessed a half hour after the quake would ( question ) why we have pipelines in residential_areas , &quot; said Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon , whose district includes the Wolfskill Street neighborhood . Angered by the rupture , Alarcon on Friday called_for a moratorium on new city agreements to operate such underground pipelines in the city until an investigation into the Wolfskill Street rupture is completed . Already , life on the street is slowly returning to normal . The ruptured pipeline was patched_up , the scarred street has been partially paved over and the city has rebuilt the charred and oil-stained gutters and sidewalks . Arco officials said they plan to reopen the line by late March . While many residents have settled their damage claims with Arco , others criticize the petroleum firm for trying to rush them into accepting an offer that they say may_not adequately cover their damages . For example , the roof of the single-story , stucco home that Alejandro Castillo and his family share on the corner of Wolfskill Street and Amboy Avenue was charred in the fire and is now covered with a plastic sheet to keep_out the elements . Castillo said contractors have estimated the damage at about $ 60 # 000 , but he said Arco has only offered $ 13 # 000 . Furthermore , he said his family has been asked to sign a waiver , freeing Arco of responsibility for future health_problems caused by the rupture . He said he is reticent to do so because he and his six family members have suffered headaches in the week after the quake . &quot; They say they were going_to compensate everyone for their damages , &quot; he said . &quot; But the catch is you have to sign a release. &quot; Martha Duran , who lives a_few doors away from Castillo , said she has not yet settled with Arco either -- for the smoke damage and oil_stains in her house -- because she did not want to waive her rights to claim future health_problems . She said she and her family , including her 74-year-old mother , suffered rashes and coughs in the week after the rupture . &quot; They just wanted us to sign_off right there , &quot; Duran said in an exasperated tone . Arco spokesman Scott Loll denies that his firm has asked residents to give_up their rights , saying the residents who settle property damages do not necessarily waive the right to file future health claims . &quot; We ' ve asked our adjusters to work with the people in the community , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s our intention to look_at each claim individually. &quot; Arco does have deadlines for offering the settlements , he said , but is willing to work with people who need more time to settle the claims . Loll said Arco is willing to consider moving the pipeline , if city officials help the company acquire new rights-of-way . But Alarcon said he is reluctant to simply move the line to another residential_area . The break was one of eight ruptures on a 35-mile span of the pipeline , which carries crude_oil from Kern County oil fields to Los Angeles refineries . Another rupture killed hundreds of fish and other wildlife in the Santa Clara River in Valencia . State and local fire investigators attribute the breaks to the pipe ' s age -- it was installed in 1925 -- and to the use of welds made with acetylene torches , which are not as strong as modern arc welds . Although the crude_oil in the line was not being pumped through the pipeline at the time of the quake , witnesses say it only took a_few minutes for oil to fill the gutters on two sides of the street . Fire investigators remain unsure how the oil became ignited , but some neighbors say the fire started with a spark or backfire from the exhaust_pipe of a car seen speeding through the oil . &quot; We were out on the street and we saw the oil come_down the street , &quot; said Sylvia Esperanza , Becerra ' s sister . &quot; Then we saw the car go_by and the fire start. &quot; The scene that ensued was described by witnesses as resembling a vision of hell . Flames that reached as high as the telephone_wires raced down the street for three blocks . Cars and trucks parked along the street &quot; popped like popcorn , &quot; said one resident . The most serious injuries were to Arturo Rodriguez , 21 , who was burned over 25 % of his body after he tried to ride his motorcycle through the oil . He was released Friday from Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center . &quot; It was really ugly , &quot; said Anastasio Gallegos , a retired carpenter who fought the flames with a garden_hose from the roof of his house . &quot; I thought it was the end of the world. &quot; The heat from the blaze was so intense that it singed trees and plants in Gallegos ' garden and melted the bumpers and brake_lights on two of his cars_parked in his driveway . While his damage was relatively minor , Gallegos said he is worried about whether the pipeline that runs a_few feet in front of his house can fuel a new disaster in the future . &quot; The danger is not with the earthquakes ; it ' s down here , &quot; he said , pointing toward Wolfskill Street .</TEXT>
