   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; CORRUPTING POWER OF LIFE ON THE STREETS ; TONY BOGARD WAS HAILED FOR LEADING A GANG TRUCE , BUT HIS TRANSFORMATION FROM EX-CON TO HERO MAY HAVE BEEN A MYTH . HIS LEGACY IS CLOUDED BY WHETHER HE WAS MORE TROUBLEMAKER THAN PEACEMAKER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tony Bogard was the King of Imperial Courts . When he was killed Jan . 13 in a shootout at the Watts housing project , the gangbanger-turned-peacemaker was mourned as a martyr akin to Malcolm X . Nationally renowned for championing the 1992 truce between Crips and Bloods , he had become a symbol of redemption in South-Central Los Angeles , luring celebrities and government dollars to a community that rarely reaps such rewards . But Bogard ' s heroic transformation was a myth -- and a cautionary tale about the corrupting pull of the streets . Even as he condemned the violence that he had wreaked for more_than half his life , Bogard allegedly siphoned thousands of dollars from his gang ' s drug sales , dice games and robberies , authorities say . The FBI had been investigating him for months , and a federal prosecutor took the unusual step of attending his autopsy just to confirm that the star suspect had been lost . Whether cruising in his ' 64 low-rider Impala or appearing on &quot; The Oprah Winfrey Show , &quot; the 30-year-old ex-con preached the gospel of self-empowerment , urging economic development to ease the ills of riot-torn Los Angeles . Yet it was the treacherous economy of the underworld -- long the source of his livelihood -- that ultimately sank Bogard ' s dreams of tapping the American mainstream . As he made his rounds that windy night in Imperial Courts , Bogard confronted a fellow member of the PJ Watts Crips in a parking_lot on 114th Street . When the shooting stopped , 25 casings lay scattered on the ground , along with Bogard , caught without his customary bulletproof_vest . His supporters say that Bogard was standing_up to a dope dealer , demanding that he donate a share of his illicit profits to compensate for poisoning their community . Critics argue it was little more_than a shakedown , a common practice whenever Bogard ' s homeboys failed to &quot; pay tribute &quot; with a cut of their spoils . The alleged assailant , awaiting trial for murder in Compton Superior_Court , claims he fired in self-defense -- a contention supported by gunshot residue on Bogard ' s hand . &quot; Tony ' s a perfect example of the shades of gray -- the good and bad -- that ' s combined in a lot of guys struggling to make_it out there , &quot; said former NFL star Jim Brown , founder of a recovery program for ex-gang members . &quot; He was instrumental in the peace , that ' s true . But when it comes_to the reality of survival , people go_back to what they knew best . The ' hood always tries to reclaim you. &quot; Peacemaker and warlord , defender and enforcer , victim and victimizer -- Bogard seemed to be continuously crossing that line . It may be because he operated in a Darwinian world where the line frequently shifts , where the distinction between right and wrong is blurred by the battle to stay afloat . Or it may be because the source of his power -- the very thing that gave him the credibility to take_control of the Watts truce -- always was rooted in his fearsome reputation . To his benefactors , such_as rapper Ice-T , former Laker star Byron Scott and county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke , Bogard ' s conversion was what made him such a commanding figure -- a spokesman for the regenerative potential of urban youth . Others viewed Bogard as a fraud who embraced the truce only to camouflage his criminal schemes -- &quot; a black Al Capone , &quot; charged the mother of one of his homeboys . But in Watts , a community hungry for role_models , many residents still were willing to take_a_chance . To some , it mattered less that Bogard may have ruled by nefarious means than that he had the strength to rule at all . &quot; In that world , any male who can control his environment is seen as a hero , &quot; said Constance L . Rice , a top NAACP lawyer . &quot; I ' m not excusing behavior that hurts other people , but deprivation creates a very different context . It ' s not hard to understand why Tony had a hell of a lot to offer. &quot; Two years after Bloods and Crips emerged from the ashes with their red and blue bandannas tied_in unity , the truce continues to hold_in the Watts projects where it was born . Gang killings remain virtually nonexistent in the community ' s three largest housing_developments , a remarkable accomplishment after two decades of warfare . Yet even after burying their rivalries , not all those gang members laid_down their arms . Alienated and defiant , some redirected their energy into more profitable ventures , exchanging the risks of a drive-by for the financial rewards of a stickup . As Los Angeles struggles to heal after America ' s worst civil unrest this century , those who have been a part of the problem insist they must have a stake in the solution . Some believe the city ' s future depends_on creating economic bonds to connect the interests of the law-abiding majority with those of the dispossessed . Bogard , packing a pistol as he called_for peace , was a testament to the difficulty of bridging that gap . Badges of a Warrior When coroner ' s officials examined Bogard ' s 5-foot-10 , 167-pound frame , they found him riddled with six gunshot wounds -- in the chest , stomach , back , arm , knee and hand . All but one of the bullets -- a 9-millimeter slug lodged_in the triceps of his right arm -- had pierced the flesh and disappeared out the other side . Scar tissue and skin_grafts covered his limbs , the result of a near-fatal attack four years earlier in which he was shot eight times with an AK-47 assault_rifle . The coroner also found evidence of several other shootings , recovering bullet fragments from Bogard ' s arm , leg and thigh . His body was marked by at least a dozen tattoos , some in memory of fallen comrades and others of a hatted man smoking what looked_to be Bogard ' s trademark vice , a joint . On the back of his neck was the designation &quot; O / G , &quot; for Original Gangster , and below that &quot; PJ Watts. &quot; They were the badges of a warrior . &quot; You just seen strength in him , &quot; said Rebecca Hammonds , 28 , Bogard ' s girlfriend of 14 years . &quot; It was like , damn , you just seen something different. &quot; By most middle-class standards , Bogard would not have rated so favorable an impression . A 10th-grade dropout from Jordan High , he was functionally_illiterate , often signing his name in awkward block_letters . He had no job prospects . He never obtained a driver ' s license . His first arrest -- for grand theft auto -- came at 13 . He eventually assembled a hefty rap sheet with nearly three dozen arrests , according to court records that show he was busted almost once a year beginning in the late 1970s . Bogard , whose legal name was Tyrone Tony Thomas , relied_on more_than a dozen aliases . When he was 16 , he spent two years behind bars for armed robbery . When he was 20 , he did a year in jail for dealing PCP . When he was 26 , he was convicted on drug charges after an informant told police he had seen several pounds of marijuana stashed at Bogard ' s house . The informant , court records show , also reported that gang rivals were plotting to kill Bogard , who was &quot; loaded for bear &quot; with a cache of more_than a dozen AK-47s , MAC 10s and Uzis . Bogard was &quot; a live_wire &quot; who had been &quot; seriously shaped to a large degree by the lifestyle and activities of gangs , &quot; a Los Angeles County probation_officer told the court a_few years later . In the housing projects of Watts , as in most of the city ' s impoverished communities , such credentials can command respect as readily as they draw contempt . Justly or not , many of the young_men who struggle for recognition in that world see a gang as their only avenue to power , even if it means terrorizing the neighborhood they purport to defend . It is a perspective that holds special allure in a place such_as Imperial Courts , where Bogard spent his childhood before inheriting a house on 64th Street from his mother , who raised him and his six siblings on_her_own . According to the 1990 census , more_than half of the project ' s households are headed by single women , 64 % of adults never finished high_school and the per capita income of $ 3 # 931 is less than one-fourth of the county average . &quot; When I was young , you know , I mean , I seen my big homies selling dope or robbing somebody . I mean , it was , that was the thing to do , &quot; Bogard said on national TV last year . &quot; I mean , if you wasn ' t strong or you wasn ' t doing something like that , you ain ' t going_to survive. &quot; On Jan . 17 , 1990 , as Bogard told it , his concept of survival changed . As he stood_in the doorway of his stucco bungalow , framed by a striped awning and a neatly trimmed cylindrical hedge , someone with a high-powered military-style rifle pumped him full of lead . Clinging_to life-support machines , Bogard felt an unfamiliar tinge of repentance tug at his heart . For the first time , he later explained , he fathomed the terrible price of being a Crip , of ravaging a community he claimed to love . Then he made a deal with God : If he lived , he would do right by the people of Watts as surely as he had done them wrong . &quot; It was sort of like a deathbed epiphany , &quot; said Barbara Cottman Becnel , a writer who is featuring Bogard in an upcoming history of the Crips and Bloods . &quot; He didn ' t want to spend the rest of his life being hurt or hurting others. &quot; But after nearly a dozen operations and skin_grafts , followed by months of physical_therapy , Bogard again crossed the line . One May afternoon in 1991 , he walked to the turf of the Grape Street Crips , which had been engaged in a long and bloody feud with the PJs . Taking_aim at a rival ' s sister , he opened_fire with a 9-millimeter pistol , barely missing her and three others . By the time the witnesses were called to testify , three had disappeared and a fourth had changed her story . It may have had something to do with the nightly barrage of gunfire that had forced their families to sleep on the floor . &quot; The victims ' . . . reluctance and relocation suggest a high level of fear generated by this defendant , &quot; court documents alleged . In an effort to salvage their unraveling case , prosecutors agreed to make a deal , reducing four counts of attempted murder to one charge of assault with a deadly weapon . Instead of going_to prison for the shooting , Bogard received a suspended sentence . He walked free in May , 1992 -- just in time to grab the truce ' s reins . Truce in the Projects The truce , which was hammered_out months earlier during a series of meetings at a Watts mosque , was formally declared on April 26 , three days before Los Angeles erupted in fiery rioting . For weeks , Bloods and Crips held rollicking , beer-soaked parties at the Watts projects -- Imperial Courts , Jordan Downs and Nickerson Gardens -- tearfully toasting an end to their savage rivalry . Although the projects are sometimes troubled places , they were also fertile ground for the truce . The complexes , seemingly worlds unto themselves , offer a sense of history and cohesiveness rarely found in the sprawl of neighborhoods claimed by the county ' s 300 other Crip and Blood factions . &quot; Watts is showing all_the other communities that we can get_together , that we ' re all one , &quot; Bogard told The Times , sporting his trademark Georgetown cap and toting a cellular_phone . As one of the oldest gangsters in the neighborhood , Bogard had the credibility , or &quot; juice , &quot; to call the shots . He saw the truce not just as a party , but also as an opportunity to take a step closer to the resources of the legitimate world . On the Fourth_of_July weekend that year , he unveiled an imaginative new venture -- Hands Across Watts , a nonprofit corporation designed to create lawful business_deals for reformed Crips and Bloods . Its logo featured two clasped hands , one red and the other blue . Its board of directors included pro athletes , the Grammy-winning engineer of Natalie Cole ' s &quot; Unforgettable &quot; album and Bogard ' s defense_attorney . &quot; I think Tony just saw that a lot of things he had been involved in as a younger_man weren ' t worth anything , &quot; said the lawyer , Stanley Granville . &quot; He was somebody who really transcended his background. &quot; Lean , with a shorn scalp and narrow mustache , Bogard was not physically imposing , still hobbled by a limp from the 1990 ambush . But he was forceful and charismatic , speaking in a raw , visceral voice that captured the attention of a national media focused_on post-riot Los Angeles . &quot; We don ' t make the AK , we don ' t bring kilos of cocaine over here , we don ' t go_for none of that , &quot; he said on &quot; Oprah &quot; last year . &quot; They drop it off in our community for us to grab it like rats . And they see how we act and they make money off it till they lock us up. &quot; At times , the exposure seemed to be a substitute for the sense of identity that gangbanging had once provided . In an ornate commendation , the County Board of Supervisors applauded Bogard for his &quot; deep commitment to the community. &quot; The Wall_Street Journal featured his entrepreneurial plans on its sober front page . A production manager for Castle Rock Entertainment had him over for dinner -- the first time Bogard had eaten_at a white_person ' s house . Last year , he was invited to a Pan-African conference in Uganda . &quot; When I first met him , he thought he would be lucky to be 30 , &quot; said Pat Mulligan , an international golf_course designer , whom Bogard picked as the first Hands Across Watts executive_director . &quot; By last year , he thought he was going_to make_it to 40. &quot; The attention translated into money for a community that was long ago abandoned by investment . In all , Hands Across Watts reports taking_in about $ 125 # 000 in contributions , including $ 5 # 000 from Mayor Richard Riordan ' s private_foundation and the proceeds from an Ice-T video filmed outside the Imperial Courts gym . Last fall , the group also received a $ 200 # 000 federal job-training grant , steered its way by Supervisor Burke . With that , Bogard was able to dole_out paychecks to 150 young adults for maintenance work in the projects . The rest of the money paid_for community barbecues and dances , as well as a youth program that took hundreds of youngsters to Dodger games , Knott ' s Berry Farm and the beach . Although it all amounted to more legitimate funds than Bogard ever could have hoped to control , he was disappointed that the donations came_to less than half of what had been budgeted . Many corporations that routinely give to charity seemed reluctant to invest in someone with such a recent criminal past . Bogard , who was to receive a $ 40 # 000 salary , had to settle for small stipends whenever there was available cash . &quot; I always tried to convince him that if we could make as much money doing right as we did doing wrong , we ' d be rich , &quot; said Hammonds , Bogard ' s girlfriend . Instead , she said , &quot; we took a cut_in pay . It was a slap in the face. &quot; From the beginning , however , others viewed Bogard as an opportunist , including some of_his_own homeboys . One of them , Dewayne ( Sniper ) Holmes , who was the first Imperial Courts gang member to reach_out to the rival projects , recalls that Bogard spent months objecting to such overtures . &quot; The Tony I knew was out for himself , &quot; said Holmes , 26 , who is serving a seven-year prison sentence for a robbery he insists he did not commit . Speaking in starched denims at a state_prison near Bakersfield , Holmes described how an uneasy cease-fire in early 1992 evolved into a string of Sunday meetings -- only one of which , he said , Bogard attended . It was only after Holmes ended_up in custody , a week after peace was announced , that he learned Bogard was suddenly taking credit for the truce . &quot; that ' s what led me to believe that maybe his motives were somewhat unpure , &quot; Holmes said . &quot; He just took the opportunity to exploit this for his own gain . . . to get what he could out of it while it was on. &quot; Mujahid Abdul-Karim , whose mosque , Masjid Al-Rasul , served as the neutral site for the negotiations , also was skeptical . On several occasions , Abdul-Karim confronted Bogard , urging him not to jeopardize their fragile accomplishments . &quot; He would say he just wanted to make money , that ' s all he was concerned about , &quot; said the minister , a quiet man who wears a simple white robe . &quot; There wasn ' t anything spiritual ; it was just material. &quot; Other proponents of the truce , such_as Daude Sherrills , a former rival from Jordan Downs , had no objections to making money . But Sherrills , who co-founded Hands Across Watts and says he coined the name , worried that Bogard was more interested in constructing his own empire than rebuilding their community . Almost immediately after forming Hands Across Watts , Sherrills decided he could not work with Bogard and quit as president . Bogard took his spot . &quot; He was trying his best , but that brother was just conditioned from birth to think with negativity , &quot; Sherrills said . &quot; Tony believed_in controlling -- he wanted the power and the money . But ( the truce ) wasn ' t about us . It was about the development of our neighborhood. &quot; The neighborhood , unfortunately , is no safer today than it was before the truce . Although police concede that the cycle of gang killings appears to have halted , they say the Watts gangs continue to be just as criminally active , even if their mayhem is no longer based on traditional Crip and Blood rivalries . In 1991 , within the 1 1 / 2-square-mile area that houses the three projects , there were 2 # 152 serious crimes reported , including 18 murders , 293 robberies and 845 assaults . Last year , there were 2 # 150 serious crimes , including 17 murders , 424 robberies and 768 assaults . Los Angeles police are convinced that Bogard remained part of that crime_wave . Neither they nor the FBI would disclose details of their investigations , but law_enforcement sources say they have been investigating reports that Bogard was a gang kingpin , enriching himself by taxing the illegal rackets of his underlings . &quot; Hey , the truce is a good thing and , to the extent that Tony Bogard facilitated the truce , I put one in the plus column for Tony , &quot; said LAPD Lt . Dennis Shirey , commander of the South Bureau ' s anti-gang CRASH unit . &quot; But I don ' t think the truce made Tony a new man . I don ' t think he woke_up one day and said : ' I ' m now on the side of law and order. ' And I don ' t think that , in net , he had a positive effect on that community. &quot; The Final Shootout The morning after Bogard was gunned_down , he was hailed as a visionary in a world not ready to open its eyes . Wiping tears from behind their sunglasses , dozens of former gang rivals and community activists gathered at the Kedren Community_Center in Watts , where they exchanged hugs and vowed to make Bogard ' s dream real . One of his most grief-stricken colleagues , 30-year-old Malik Spellman , said Bogard had been in Imperial Courts the previous night only because he needed to raise money for a Hands Across Watts phone_bill . If the city ' s business and political Establishment had been more supportive of the group ' s efforts , he contended , Bogard would not have been forced to look_for funds on the neighborhood ' s mean streets . &quot; You all guilty of a crime , &quot; Spellman charged , sobbing into a sea of TV cameras . &quot; You all killed Tony . Not us. &quot; Several weeks after Bogard ' s death , the Rev . Carl Washington , a deputy to Supervisor Burke , acknowledged having heard rumors that Bogard was still trafficking in drugs . But Washington said he dismissed such talk as jealous backbiting . Having known Bogard since his own childhood in Imperial Courts , Washington is convinced that the truce leader died trying to keep a pusher ' s profits from being sucked out of the neighborhood . &quot; We talked a lot about recycling black dollars , &quot; said Washington , who serves , with Burke , on the Hands Across Watts board . &quot; It was like , if you ' re not putting any money back into the community , you can ' t work here , you can ' t deal here , you can ' t come_around here anymore. &quot; At a preliminary hearing in Municipal Court last month , Bogard ' s method of soliciting contributions was described in less-than-neighborly terms . Before the shooting , word had circulated that Bogard was irate with the defendant , Rodney Compton . Some said it was because Compton , 21 , had failed to share his earnings from a major cocaine rip-off . Others said it was because the victims of the rip-off had taken their beef to Bogard , who felt Compton ' s scam had jeopardized the Imperial Courts gang . When they finally met , according to Compton ' s testimony , Bogard demanded he hand_over &quot; $ 25 # 000 and some dope. &quot; &quot; I don ' t have it , &quot; Compton said he told Bogard . &quot; I don ' t know what you talking about. &quot; Bogard accused Compton of being a &quot; mark &quot; and a &quot; buster , &quot; meaning he was weak and unwilling to defend the gang ' s interests . &quot; He told me . . . I got_to break_bread with the projects , &quot; said Compton , who is being held_on $ 1-million bail . In a scene worthy of an Old West gun duel , the men then squared_off . Bogard , according to Compton , drew a large-caliber handgun and fired two rounds . Compton , wounded in the right arm , said he pulled_out his pistol and took 12 shots at Bogard . At least one other shooter , whom police have yet to identify , also opened_fire . &quot; If Rodney Compton had not acted , he would be dead today , &quot; said his attorney , Edi M . O . Faal , whose defense work in the Reginald O . Denny beating trial earned him the accolades of many South-Central Los Angeles residents . &quot; With due respect_to Tony Bogard . . . his actions were inconsistent with the role of a peacemaker. &quot; Even prosecutors have conceded this probably is not a case of first-degree murder . What it boils_down to , said Deputy Dist . Atty . Scott G . Carbaugh , &quot; is who pulled the gun first , who was first or quickest on the draw. &quot; That point may be difficult to prove . Homicide investigators have found only one witness -- and not a particularly reliable one -- who saw Compton kill Bogard . No one else , not even the homeboys who rushed their dying chieftain to the hospital , has come_forward . A Meager Kingdom In the end , it was a sad and meager kingdom that Tony Bogard ruled . He owned a two-bedroom 1920s-era house that contained only one concession to opulence , a giant color_TV set by the living room window . But its four-foot screen was punctured by a gunshot , accidentally fired by a friend showing_off his new Uzi . Bogard was buried in a humble , city-operated cemetery in San Bernardino , his body placed above that of his sister , Yvonne . She was killed last year at age 33 , when assailants fired through her kitchen window in what police believe was a drug-related attack . A eulogy , etched into Bogard ' s headstone , asks his loved ones to remember the good times they shared and disregard those who would speak ill : Let the rumors be Don ' t worry about what ' s said about me Everybody had something to say about TB</TEXT>
