   <TEXT> Rippling curtains of rain . Sudden shafts of sharpening air . We ' re on holiday in London -- me , my wife and two daughters . Gogo , my 9-year-old , seems oblivious to the theatrical British weather . Absorbed in a fragile trance , she studies a brown beetle crawling up her hand . &quot; This bug ' s head is so small ! &quot; she says . &quot; I bet its brain can only hold one idea. &quot; Gogo , who plots our summer and winter vacations with the world_view of Alexander the Great , lives in her own ether . She has Pre-Raphaelite features , wide brown eyes that seem to be off on a secret , faraway trip and a quirky private smile . Her mind is a pinball_machine : She has a gift for making associations that even James Joyce might admire . Which is what I like about traveling with my kids . I ' m enchanted not so_much by their innocence as their skewed perceptions , their undiscriminating appetite for scraps of knowledge . Because everything in their experience is equally weighted , they see things whole , untainted , in clear air . A few years back we took a family outing_to Philadelphia ' s science_museum , the Franklin Institute . We spent an instructive afternoon among exhibits that elucidated the physical laws_of_nature . On our way_out , I bought Gogo a soft_pretzel . She took a bite , dropped the wax_paper into a trash_can and began to giggle . &quot; What ' s so funny ? &quot; I said . &quot; Gravity , &quot; she replied . Lately , our vacations have followed Gogo ' s pretzel logic . Wherever her imagination wanders , we follow . She so loved &quot; The Diary of Anne Frank &quot; that we went_to Amsterdam for a closer reading . She wanted to walk up the hidden staircase , she said , tiptoe around the attic and peek into the water_closet to check_out Anne ' s chain toilet . And happily , Gogo did . Still , the secret annex perplexed her . &quot; There ' s something I can ' t figure_out , &quot; she said plaintively . &quot; How did Anne Frank keep so quiet in wooden shoes ? &quot; Gogo was more contemplative than confused on our odyssey to Greece two winters ago . The Rock of the Sibyl at Delphi delighted her . The Palace of Minos in Knossos enthralled her . The Acropolis Museum ' s statue of Cerberus , the multi-headed mutt that watched_over the realm of the dead , left her rapturously agog . Yet when we got_to the sacred spot she most wanted to visit -- the Cave of Hades in Eleusis -- she shuffled along silently , head down , shoes scraping the ancient stones . &quot; Are you OK , Gogo ? &quot; I asked . &quot; Sure , &quot; she said without lifting her eyes . &quot; I ' m having fun just kicking the Gods ' dust. &quot; It was a Greek connection -- sort of -- that piqued Gogo ' s interest in England last summer . &quot; You ' ll like it there , &quot; said Maggie , her mother . &quot; Londoners travel_by underground. &quot; &quot; That sounds cool , &quot; Gogo said . &quot; But are you allowed to pet Cerberus ? &quot; If our tour of Great Britain has a theme , it ' s mystery . We begin at 221B Baker St. , home to the new Sherlock_Holmes Museum . All spring I ' d been reading his adventures aloud to Gogo and her 6-year-old sister , Daisy . But they weren ' t really hooked until they saw Jeremy Brett ' s sublimely over-the-top Holmes on PBS . Days after watching an episode , they ' d still be reciting lines of dialogue : &quot; Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention ? &quot; To the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime. &quot; &quot; The dog_did nothing in the nighttime. &quot; &quot; That was the curious incident. &quot; At the front_door , a private bobby monitors the queue . &quot; Will I get_to see the blue carbuncle ? &quot; Gogo asks him . &quot; Sherlock_Holmes said he ' s put it in his museum. &quot; &quot; I ' m afraid we couldn ' t actually get the blue carbuncle , &quot; says the bobby . &quot; But if you look_around , I ' m sure you ' ll find the five orange pips. &quot; Curiously , 221B falls between 237 , a real_estate office , and 241 , a chartered_accountant firm . We climb the 17 steps to the sitting room , which is crammed with enough Victorian nostalgia to make the master exclaim in his high , somewhat strident tones : &quot; Entirely meretricious ! &quot; Gogo inspects every alleged artifact : the severed digit from &quot; The Adventure of the Engineer ' s Thumb , &quot; the stuffed swamp adder from &quot; The Adventure of the Speckled Band , &quot; the locket of hair from &quot; The Adventure of the Copper Beeches. &quot; &quot; Whoever cut this hair didn ' t use scissors , &quot; she deduces . &quot; It must have been done with a dull knife. &quot; &quot; Maybe it was chewed off , &quot; offers Daisy . Gogo rolls her eyes heavenward . Propped above a mantle is the hair-trigger revolver Holmes fired one dull day into the sitting room wall , describing the initials &quot; VR &quot; -- Victoria Regina . &quot; What does VR spell ? &quot; yells Daisy . Gogo raises a finger to her lips , shushing her little_sister . &quot; Very rude , &quot; she whispers . The maids clear_out the chambers for an eminent Sherlockian who has come all_the way from Japan . He wears a deerstalker and Inverness cape , and holds aloft an out-sized magnifying_glass . Striding purposefully across the room , he parts the drapes , looks_up and down Baker Street , does an abrupt about-face and shouts , &quot; Aha ! &quot; Then he leaves . Gogo studies the impostor dispassionately . Daisy raises a slightly heretical question : &quot; Was there a real Sherlock_Holmes , or was he just paper ? &quot; Gogo pulls on the brims of_her_own deerstalker and draws deeply on her plastic calabash . &quot; That , &quot; she says at last , &quot; is a three-pipe problem. &quot; We repair_to the Sherlock_Holmes Hotel to puzzle this out over bowls of Great British pudding ( &quot; cook ' s homemade pudding with lashings of custard &quot; ) . &quot; Sherlock_Holmes was alive and paper , &quot; Gogo says between lashings . &quot; It ' s like Bloody Mary : She was a queen and a drink. &quot; * Appropriately enough , our next stop is Buckingham Palace . The joint is open_to paying tourists for the first time , and , as Gogo says , &quot; I always wanted to see the Queen ' s place. &quot; Gogo asks how to act if she should chance_upon Her Majesty having a spot of tea in the Throne Room . Maggie says , &quot; Just pretend she ' s not wearing a crown. &quot; I add helpfully , &quot; And don ' t offer her a stick of bubble gum. &quot; We are funneled through 18 exceedingly formal rooms redolent_of majesty . William IV called the place &quot; hideous. &quot; Edward_VIII complained of its &quot; curious musty odor. &quot; A TV pundit compares it to a tandoori curry house . Gogo offers her own detailed critique . &quot; The red_carpets are really ugly , &quot; she says of the newly laid Axminster . &quot; They ' re the same ones at the Holiday Inn. &quot; &quot; They are not ! &quot; protests Daisy . &quot; Holiday Inn carpets aren ' t this fuzzy . These are more like the Sheraton ' s. &quot; &quot; Oh , yeah ? So where ' s the big S in the middle ? &quot; They dash_off through the Green , Blue and White drawing rooms . We lose sight of them in the crimson Throne Room , where they pause briefly to check_out the squat monogrammed chairs . Gogo eventually resurfaces in the Picture_Gallery . &quot; Where ' s Daisy ? &quot; I ask . &quot; Who ? &quot; &quot; Your sister ? &quot; &quot; Oh , her . I don ' t know , where ? &quot; We alert a warden , who alerts other wardens . Pretty soon there ' s an all-points palace bulletin for a &quot; 3-foot-10-inch American in a Betty Boop T-shirt. &quot; Gogo finds her in the royal loo . Daisy is chastened , Gogo chagrined. &quot; Here ' s a real mystery , &quot; Gogo announces . &quot; Why does the queen have such rough toilet_paper ? &quot; * Our final conundrum unravels in Portmeirion , a tiny , Italianate dream-town boldly planted amid the slatey cliffs and wide , sandy estuaries of North Wales . Planned and built by Welsh eccentric Sir Clough Williams-Ellis in the 1920s and ' 30s , this architectural fantasia of columns , cornices and campaniles was the setting for the ' 60s TV series &quot; The Prisoner. &quot; The show told the story of a British secret_agent who , after resigning his post , was abducted and held captive by powers unknown in a timeless hamlet called &quot; the village. &quot; Everyone is under surveillance ; no one has a name , only a number ; and there is no knowing who is a friend and who is a spy . It ' s been more_than a quarter of a century since the series first aired . But &quot; Prisoner &quot; hajjis still pilgrimage to Portmeirion for an annual two-day synod . They cavort as villagers , re-enact scenes from the show and paw over its ambiguities . Everything is accomplished with scrupulous and impeccable seriousness . Gogo and Daisy are big fans themselves . They ' ve watched all 17 episodes and have memorized the mantra of Number 6 , the show ' s hero . &quot; I will not be pushed , filed , stamped , indexed , briefed , debriefed or numbered ! &quot; they chant over and over during the five-hour drive from London . &quot; My life is my own. &quot; The sun is going_down when we finally check_into the Portmeirion Hotel . &quot; I ' ll need some information , &quot; says the desk_clerk . &quot; You won ' t get_it ! &quot; snaps Gogo . &quot; Ha ! So you ' re here for the Prisoner convention. &quot; Daisy , who ' s still not sure if Sherlock_Holmes was or wasn ' t , is even more nonplussed by this diabolical Disneyland . The BBC film crew on_hand to document the event only reinforces her impression that we ' re part of an ongoing television_show . When we get_to our room , she looks behind the paintings and mirrors for hidden cameras and microphones . There ' s a knock at the door . &quot; May I turn_down your bed ? &quot; asks a voice . Daisy crouches timidly behind Gogo , who sputters , &quot; What ' s wrong ? Is it too loud ? &quot; The next morning we pad past pillared porticoes , splashing fountains and numerous pastel-colored villas to Number 6 ' s house , now a shop that sells &quot; Prisoner &quot; maps and bumper stickers as if they were souvenirs from Lourdes . We ramble up a cobblestone path to the green Florentine dome , where the arch-interrogator , Number 2 , once plotted to break Number 6 ' s will . We ramble down to the pink gloriette , the speaker ' s platform , where Number 6 once tried to rouse the villagers to rebellion . We amble around the green , with its fanciful statuary and colonnades , where scores of middle-age &quot; Prisoner &quot; wanna-bes mill_about in striped blazers , straw boaters and flowing capes . They ' re restaging the human chess_game from Episode 11 . Instead of name_tags , these conventioneers sport badges bearing their numbers . None of which matters much to Gogo and Daisy , who search in vain for Patrick McGoohan , the actor who played Number 6 . McGoohan has never appeared at one of these confabs . He seems to regard the whole exercise with something approaching disdain . He ' s forever besieged by &quot; Prisoner &quot; cultists seeking answers to the show ' s riddles . &quot; I ' ve become a prisoner of ' The Prisoner , ' &quot; he once lamented . In the 18th-Century Town_Hall , we watch a short film McGoohan apparently made to appease the &quot; Prisoner &quot; faithful . Strolling under a pier in Santa Monica , he pauses to fish a coat_hanger out of the surf . He keeps sketching hangers in the sand , only to have them rubbed_out by the sea . &quot; Prisoner &quot; cineastes call this bit of whimsy &quot; The L.A. Tape. &quot; After the screening , Gogo stumbles into a discussion group near the piazza . A bunch of earnest villagers are mulling the tape ' s meaning . &quot; The hanger stands_for the Great Pyramid of Cheops , &quot; insists a woman whose badge identifies her as 52 . &quot; To me , &quot; says someone numbered 39 , &quot; it looks_like a question_mark on a pedestal . McGoohan wants us to keep questioning our beliefs. &quot; It ' s Gogo ' s turn . &quot; Young_lady , &quot; says 43 solemnly . &quot; What do you think McGoohan means ? &quot; &quot; I think he means it ' s time to hang it up. &quot;</TEXT>
