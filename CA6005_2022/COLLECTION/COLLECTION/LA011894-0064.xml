   <HEADLINE> U.S. FILMS NOT SO POPULAR AT PALM SPRINGS FESTIVAL ; MOVIES : FOREIGN , INDEPENDENT ENTRIES GRAB VIEWERS , POSSIBLY BECAUSE AMERICAN FILMS CAN BE SEEN ELSEWHERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was a surprisingly sparse crowd gathered for &quot; Blink , &quot; the Michael Apted thriller starring Madeleine Stowe at the Palm Springs International Film Festival . After all , the film generated good_word of mouth and as the &quot; major studio release &quot; chosen to kick_off Saturday ' s closing night festivities , one might expect the Coachella Valley to come_out in_force . In fact , none of the majors packed them in at the festival . It was at foreign films such_as &quot; La Scorta &quot; and &quot; Fiorile &quot; ( Italy ) , &quot; Harmony Cats &quot; and &quot; La Florida &quot; ( Canada ) , &quot; Justiz &quot; ( Germany ) and &quot; Belle Epoque ' ( Spain ) -- and American independent films such_as &quot; Lookin ' Italian , &quot; &quot; The Last Seduction &quot; and &quot; My Life ' s in Turnaround &quot; -- that seats were scarce , unless one arrived half an hour early . Of the half-dozen films scheduled for third screenings due_to popularity , none was a big-budget American film . At the Palm Springs Mall gala after &quot; Blink ' s &quot; screening , local festival devotee Kate Foster expressed the opinion that &quot; people here are more interested in experimenting . They know there ' s a good chance of seeing most of the American films down the road , but this is probably the only chance they ' ll get_to see some of the foreign or small American films . . . most of which ' ll probably never even make_it to video. &quot; Arranging the lineup for this year ' s festival was artistic director Mark Diamond . Hired late and given only three months to slate 100 films ( including shorts ) , the onetime director of the Boston International Film Festival not only managed a popular slate of foreign offerings , but also put_together a tribute to Sophia Loren , organized the first major retrospective of Federico Fellini ' s work since the director ' s death last year , and , by creating the American Independent Showcase , became a hero to a number of young American filmmakers . &quot; Most of these independents have a very , very small chance of ever finding distribution on_their_own , &quot; said Diamond . &quot; At least by showcasing some of the better ones , there ' s a good chance of generating some interest . I also think it ' s very important for some of these younger filmmakers to have the experience of coming_to a festival . This was the first one for the ' Rhinoskin ' kids. &quot; * Dina Marie Chapman co-wrote , produced and directed &quot; Rhinoskin : The Making of a Movie_Star , &quot; a documentary-style comedy about making_it in Hollywood , with its star , Tod De Pre . Chapman , a 23-year-old USC graduate , said the festival has been an eye_opener . &quot; I thought it was going_to be cutthroat , but everyone ' s been really helpful . They ' re like , ' I love your film , give me a tape and I ' ll get_it to my distributor. ' &quot; Director Jamie Bruce , who co-produced the gritty chase thriller , &quot; Dirty Money &quot; with the film ' s star and screenwriter Federick Deane , had three solid offers for foreign distribution but by midweek was still hoping for a solid domestic offer . &quot; It ' s harder to get domestic distribution because there just aren ' t that many venues for independents . Whereas , there are a lot more possibilities abroad , especially if the film deals in some way with American culture. &quot; Yet , for all_the practical and altruistic reasons for showcasing American independents , one of the best is just to experience the refreshing enthusiasm of artists who like to tell their stories on films . At screenings of movies like the hilarious and sophisticated &quot; My Life ' s in Turnaround , &quot; James Merendino ' s darkly funny and disturbing &quot; The Upstairs , &quot; Guy Magar ' s popular &quot; Lookin ' Italian &quot; or Bruce and Deane ' s homage a noir , one heard tales about labors_of_love , maxing out credit_cards and directors putting themselves in cameos to save 50 bucks . Final attendance figures could not be determined at press time , but executive_director Craig Prater admitted to a local paper that attendance and grosses were going_to fall below last year ' s marks . Considering the number of overflow audiences at some films , it was hard to see how . * Of course , not all aspects of the festival were wildly popular_with everyone . A Canadian director who asked not to be identified , said he found the behavior of the audiences to be the most ill-mannered of recent experience . &quot; I think a lot of these people think they ' re home watching a video . When the lights go_down , out comes the picnic and the crinkling of paper continues for a half hour . Then , between scenes , they discuss what just happened , what will happen and what might be nice to pick_up for dinner. &quot; Even if Palm Springs is the rube among international film festivals , it has a number of unique attractions . Although the festival trades upon its now somewhat tattered reputation as pastureland for former stars , there is a charming Anyburb , U.S.A. , feel about the place . At the closing night gala , the party was more akin to a rousing Kiwanis affair than anything connected to Celluloid City . And while some may think the gala ' s locale was slightly tacky , its lack of pretension was its most endearing quality . &quot; Why not a mall ? &quot; asked Kate Foster . &quot; It ' s perfect ; 85 % of American life takes_place inside them. &quot;</TEXT>
