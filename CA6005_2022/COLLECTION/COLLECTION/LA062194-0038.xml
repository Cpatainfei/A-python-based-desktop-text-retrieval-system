   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; BRAZIL ' S VICTORY NEEDS NO EXPLANATION ; GROUP_B : FAVORITES IMPRESSIVE IN OPENING 2-0 VICTORY OVER RUSSIA , AND ARE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After his team ' s World Cup opener against Brazil , Russian Coach Pavel Sadyrin had little analysis to offer . The loss , he said , was &quot; more or less explainable. &quot; He did not elaborate . Nor was it necessary . The less of it was that the Russians were so overmatched that they were fortunate to leave Stanford Stadium while the scoreboard still showed only 2-0 in favor of the Brazilians . End of story ? Not quite . Whereas the Russians no doubt were eager to start looking ahead to their next first-round game , against Sweden , the Brazilians wanted to savor their victory as long as possible . Of all_the teams in the 24-team World Cup tournament , perhaps none is under more pressure than Brazil . Not only do Brazilian fans expect their team to win the World Cup , they demand it . They are so demanding that , even though Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has put_together a team that most experts contend is the favorite , he was booed in Monday ' s pregame introductions . And the overwhelming majority of the crowd of 81 # 061 was Brazilian . So Parreira was glad to be able to calm them for at least one afternoon . &quot; In spite of ( a score of ) just two-nil , Brazil ' s advantage was very big , &quot; Parreira said . &quot; Not at any time did I feel Brazil was threatened. &quot; He also had some ominous words for his team ' s next opponent , Cameroon . &quot; So far , Brazil is the only team in the competition that had the ability to hold the ball throughout the game , &quot; he said . &quot; Certainly , Brazil is going_to raise its level further in the games to come. &quot; No one could argue on this day that Parreira had not made all_the right moves , but then a lot of coaches would look_like geniuses with his players . After his exquisite forward , Romario , placed a shot into the right corner of the net after a corner_kick in the 26th minute to give Brazil a 1-0 lead , Russian goalkeeper Dmitri Kharine could only shake his head in admiration . &quot; Unfortunately , Romario is a Brazilian , and he plays extraordinary , &quot; Kharine said later . &quot; A European player would have tried to score in a different corner . So he used a different approach. &quot; With Romario and Bebeto , Brazil has_the_best forward combination in the tournament . Sadyrin tried to neutralize them with three defenders , but the Russians did not have the quickness necessary and decided early that they would have to resort_to thuggery . Such tactics sometimes distract Romario and Bebeto , but that was not the case Monday . The referee , An Yan Lim Kee Chong of Mauritius , was often overmatched , but he eventually caught_on and dispensed three second-half yellow cards to the Russians . He also granted the first penalty kick of the four-day-old tournament , calling defender Vladislav Ternavsky for tackling Romario from behind in the penalty area in the 53rd minute . Ternavsky earlier got_away with wrestling Romario down in the penalty area , but not this time . Midfielder Rai did the honors and easily beat Kharine to the right corner . Poor Ternavsky . This is the third time this year that he has been called_upon to mark Romario . The first two times , he was playing for Spartak Moscow against Romario ' s FC Barcelona team , and although this might have been Ternavsky ' s best game against him , it will not be one he will want to recall in his memoirs . As a final indignity , he was called_upon afterward to submit to drug testing . But Romario and Bebeto can make even the best of defenders look flat-footed . Brazil ' s fans were concerned about the midfield , where Rai , the captain , has been little better than sufficient , and the defense , where injuries have struck . No less an expert than Pele said recently that Brazil had much individual talent but little organization . That was not the case Monday . Rai found space in the midfield with the same creativity that he used in 1992 , when he was considered among the world ' s best playmakers , and the defense was superb . To compensate for the lost defenders , Parreira substituted players who could handle the ball like midfielders . Not only did they easily parry Russia ' s few well-conceived counterattacks , they often initiated attacks of_their_own . As a result , there was a flow to Brazil ' s game that was not present during the 1990 World Cup in Italy , where the former coach , Sebastiao Lazaroni , insisted that his team establish its defensive credentials . Parreira said last week that his team will protect its end of the field , but will not betray its followers throughout the world who expect Brazil to play its traditional jogo bonito , beautiful game . So far , he is a man of his word .</TEXT>
