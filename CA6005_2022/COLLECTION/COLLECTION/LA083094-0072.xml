   <HEADLINE> GLOBAL AGRICULTURE ; BIG BUSINESS ; GROWING CROPS BY COMPUTER IN AMERICA ; ON HIS MINNESOTA MEGA-FARM , PATRICK BENEDICT CULTIVATES THOUSANDS OF ACRES WITH JUST SEVEN EMPLOYEES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1900 , Edwin Benedict left Wisconsin to farm on the wind-whipped prairie here . By the time his grandson Patrick joined the enterprise in 1951 , the Depression had shrunk the spread substantially , to fewer than 400 acres , but it still took as_many as 70 hired men to harvest the onions and sugar_beets by hand . Now , as the century closes , Benedict Farms Inc. , with annual sales of $ 2 million , sprawls over 6 # 800 acres . Patrick Benedict , 60 and silver-haired , and his family own about 2 # 300 acres outright , each valued at about $ 1 # 000 , and lease the rest . He cultivates the land with seven employees , more_than $ 1 million worth of equipment and , perhaps most important , two computers . In two generations , the American farm , while still very much a family_business , has blasted into the corporate era . Over two decades , the number of U.S. farms decreased by more_than half , while the average size grew by 1 1 / 2 times . Those who could manipulate the high-tech tools of the trade bought or rented the property of those who could not , or would not , change their ways . Paterfamilias and company president , in traditional blue_jeans and plaid shirt , Pat Benedict sits at his keyboard for several hours each day . The changing figures and charts on his monitor show him the weather , current market_prices and the cost-efficiency of every field -- how much seed went_in , how much fertilizer went_on , how much crop came_out of the ground . His wife and secretary-treasurer , Fran , calculates the payroll in the gray frame house where his grandmother once cooked huge meals on a wood stove to feed the threshing crews . Daughter Lisa Mann helps keep the books . Sons Blaine , Kurt and David hold shares and work the soil . Their product_line : wheat , sugar_beets , corn , barley and irrigated alfalfa . Net worth , according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet : $ 539 # 390 . &quot; I think there ' s a good future in it , &quot; Benedict said . But like any number of executives in any number of industries , he counsels diversification to avoid the fate of those who have been forced_out . It is the same advice he would offer to potential agri-magnates and economy-builders in emerging nations . To get_through lean times -- like last year , when Benedict Farms , he says , almost broke_even but didn ' t quite -- he has invested in other parts of what he calls &quot; the food chain. &quot; He has served as chairman_of_the_board of a local bank , learning the whys and wherefores of credit . He organized 1 # 200 growers to buy_out the American Crystal Sugar Co . plant , which mills sugar_beets . He and nine others built a grain elevator , which stores harvested crops and sells to distributors when the price is right . The elevator operation includes a fertilizer and chemical dealership . In both cases , he not only wrested profits away from processor-middlemen but gained control over when he could sell the fruits of_his_own operation -- no small consideration when prices fluctuate from day to day and week to week . He is president of another group planning to start a corn_syrup factory from scratch . He talks_of someday manufacturing bread or cake_mix nearby . &quot; As we move from a domestic economy to a global economy , &quot; he said , he is going_to need that support more and more . &quot; I ' m suggesting , &quot; he added , breaking_into a smile , &quot; that GATT and NAFTA are not going_to be the savior of the American farm . We won ' t have access to the markets where the people are prosperous . They want to be self-sufficient in food . we ' ll be trying to sell food to people who don ' t have any money. &quot; He has traveled through Europe , viewing sugar co-ops in the_Netherlands and forging an alliance with a Danish seed company . And in 1991 , he represented agriculture in a U.S. delegation to the former the Soviet_Union . At a collective where a farm the size of his Minnesota spread supported 1 # 200 members , Benedict realized : &quot; They know how to grow crops . They know how to raise livestock. &quot; He asked the manager what he would change if he could , and the answer came quickly : &quot; Get_rid_of two-thirds of the people. &quot; On the collective , herders still kept track of cattle when fences would do , and the people had to be sheltered , fed and paid . Mechanizing would only be part of the solution to rationalizing a Soviet collective , Benedict says . And he suspects the most pressing needs are the same in other sections of the globe . &quot; What they ' re missing is transportation , infrastructure to get their products to the markets . They need political stability. &quot; The U.S._government , he believes , should not provide either one for other countries : &quot; No . No . They ' re going to have to do that themselves . We can show them the way , but we should not try to be involved. &quot; He preaches for them what he ' s been practicing here . &quot; Try to involve producers in the value-added process from the beginning , &quot; he said . &quot; That is the shortcut. &quot; His hypothetical formula for change : 10 farmers in an African or Latin_American country getting_together to roast coffee and also to truck it to market , by themselves , by hiring others to do_it or by participating in a joint_venture . &quot; They ' ll be minding two or maybe even three stores , and they ' ll have to put some of those resources in , &quot; Benedict said , &quot; but they ' ll acquire capital much more quickly. &quot; And sooner rather than later , &quot; they will become consumers &quot; of manufactured items . He can see the dangers in agribusiness any time he goes_out to inspect his own fields . His farm ' s steady growth came , as he said , &quot; as opportunities presented themselves. &quot; The translation : as other farms failed . Benedict doesn ' t like to talk much about specific profits_and_losses . But it ' s clear that he counts among his proudest accomplishments the fact that he has been able to remain on the land . He loves the life . His grandfather ' s house , now much-renovated , stands north of Clay County Road 75 just west of the spot where the pavement ends and the gravel surface begins . Two rows of Scotch_pines flank the drive , and the twin cities of Moorhead , Minn. , and Fargo , N.D. , seem very distant , though they can be reached in 20 minutes or less . Buck , his brown Chesapeake Bay retriever , matches his stride as he heads for a pickup_truck and pulls a photo from the dash . The Benedicts used it for their Christmas_card last year ; it shows the whole clan gathered around a combine . Two Benedict sons have not joined Benedict Farms . One , Michael , is an engineer at the sugar-beet plant that his father helped take_over . The youngest , Luke , is a senior in high_school , with plans for college but not beyond . Once he graduates , Luke said , &quot; it ' s still open &quot; what career path he will follow . What does Pat want him to do ? &quot; What I want is for the kids to get the education so they have a choice , &quot; Benedict said . &quot; Sales , management . They need the tools &quot; -- even , especially , if they want to stay_on the Clay County soil that is nurturing its fourth generation of Benedicts along with the wheat , corn and beets . What It Takes_to Grow an Acre of Wheat For a typical Kansas wheat farm Rain : 15-20 inches Materials : 20 lbs . phosphate ; 40 lbs . nitrogen ; 45-60 lbs . seed ; pest / weed control Production_costs : Materials : $ 30 ; Harvesting : $ 18 ; Fuel , maintenance : $ 16 ; Labor : $ 10.80 ; Interest , depreciation , taxes : $ 44.70 ; TOTAL COST PER ACRE : $ 119.50. Return per acre : $ 135.50 * 35 bushels of wheat equals 2 # 450 loaves_of_bread . * Recent average price Source : Kansas Farm Bureau BENEDICT FARMS INC . Location : Sabin , Minn .
