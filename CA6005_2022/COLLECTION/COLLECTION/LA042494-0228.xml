   <TEXT> &quot; Reality Bites &quot; executive producer Stacey Sher couldn ' t have been happier . There she was , buying CDs at Tower Records , and the tousled-haired clerk bagging cassettes behind the counter -- the hippest guy in the room -- was proudly wearing a &quot; Reality Bites &quot; button on his shirt . When Sher mentioned she ' d been involved with the movie , the Tower clerk exclaimed : &quot; Oh my God , that ' s so cool ! I ' ve listened to the soundtrack about 4 # 000 times. &quot; Then one of his co-workers jumped in . &quot; Hey , &quot; she said , &quot; you haven ' t even seen the movie ! &quot; The clerk shrugged . &quot; Come on , I work_at Tower Records . I can ' t afford to go_to movies. &quot; Whatever the reason , the Tower clerk , like many of his Generation X brethren , don ' t seem to be going_to the movies the way they used to -- at least not to movies about themselves . Beginning in 1989 with the release of &quot; Heathers &quot; and &quot; sex lies , and videotape , &quot; a wide array of young filmmakers have surfaced , making a series of quirky films aimed at the scruffy core of the twentysomething marketplace . Focused largely on brooding , disillusioned youths absorbed in edgy relationships and turbulent romances , the films have been alternately praised and reviled by critics . Some , like &quot; Kalifornia , &quot; were instant bombs . A few lower-budget entries , like &quot; Benny &amp; Joon , &quot; turned a modest profit . One classic alienated outsider tale , &quot; Edward Scissorhands , &quot; was a major hit . But none have captured the elusive spirit of a generational moment , as &quot; The Graduate &quot; did for disaffected youth of the late ' 60s , &quot; Saturday Night Fever &quot; for the self-discovery of the disco era or &quot; Fast Times at Ridgemont High &quot; for the teen anxieties of the early- ' 80s mall culture . Buoyed by strong word-of-mouth and what seemed like a picture-perfect marketing campaign , Universal Pictures ' &quot; Reality Bites &quot; had the heady scent of a generational impact film when it hit theaters in mid-February . Its star , Generation X goddess Winona Ryder , graced the cover of Rolling Stone . Details gave its cover to co-star Ethan Hawke . Director and co-star Ben Stiller was everywhere on late-night TV . GQ , Sassy and Vanity_Fair did celeb-struck profiles of the film ' s stars . Time , Newsweek , Entertainment Weekly and The Los Angeles Times weighed in with rave reviews . MTV did a &quot; Big Picture &quot; special edition devoted to the film . Its soundtrack rocketed into the Billboard Top 10 . Even more importantly , &quot; Reality Bites &quot; seemed to catch a pop-culture wave : Newspapers debated its Generation X merits in Op-Ed page stories . Local deejays started obsessively playing &quot; My Sharona , &quot; the 1979 teen anthem revived on its soundtrack . Even the New Republic ' s Michael Kinsley used the movie ' s portrayal of out-of-work slackers as a hook for a column about the federal_deficit . But despite the hoopla , the $ 11-million film never caught_fire . It is inching toward a gross of $ 20 million , meaning its modest profits will come from its home-video release . &quot; It ' s a little depressing , &quot; says Sher . &quot; My crackpot theory is that we made a really good movie for people who can ' t afford to see it. &quot; * Coined by Douglas Coupland in his 1991 novel , &quot; Generation X &quot; is a classic sound-bite catch phrase . Beloved by the media , it is loathed by everyone forced to wear the tag , even if it ' s no more bogus than previous media convenience labels , including such whoppers as the Beat_Generation , the Flower_Power Generation and the Me Generation . According to media and marketing mavens , Generation X-ers are post-baby boomers , a generation born roughly between the Cuban missile crisis and Watergate . They ' ve been depicted -- and often depict themselves -- as overeducated and underemployed . Cynical and disillusioned . Media savvy and equally media suspicious . You ' ve seen the snapshot : White middle-class kids raised on junk sitcoms and trashy rock_bands who hang_out in coffee_bars , wear thrift-store threads , smoke Marlboro Lights and save_up for Lollapalooza tour tickets . In reality , this generation is far more culturally diverse , just as likely to harbor a preppy neo-conservative as a grungy slacker . But , like the media , Hollywood goes_for the stereotype . For decades , it has viewed rebellious youth as lucrative box-office fodder , supplying a new icon for each generation , from James Dean and Jack Nicholson to John Travolta and Tom Cruise . As teens in the mid- ' 80s , Generation X-ers were ardent film consumers , making hits out of such adolescent fantasies as &quot; Ferris Bueller ' s Day Off , &quot; &quot; Risky Business , &quot; &quot; Pretty in Pink &quot; and &quot; The Breakfast Club. &quot; But today something seems amiss -- both economically and culturally . In an era where every_other youth culture trapping is booming -- be it MTV , alternative rock , Fox TV , Reebok or the Gap -- Hollywood ' s Generation X movies are , with rare exceptions , underperforming at the box_office . Despite the presence of such appealing young actors as Ryder , Johnny Depp , Christian Slater , Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis , the films often have trouble connecting with their core audience , much less crossing over to older or more mainstream moviegoers . Even the most high-profile films , most notably &quot; Reality Bites &quot; and &quot; Singles , &quot; hit the wall short of a $ 20-million box-office gross . Of equal concern is the nagging sense that many Generation X-ers -- loyal moviegoers all through their teens -- are dropping_out of the box-office equation as they reach their 20s , preferring to buy CDs or stay home and rent videos . It ' s hard to say whether they are turned_off by movies in_general or just movies about themselves . Either way , they seem deeply skeptical of Hollywood ' s attempts to market nonconformity -- and suspicious of the way their age_group is portrayed on screen . When it comes_to pop icons , they prefer Pearl Jam and Soul Asylum to Ethan Hawke or Christian Slater . * Whatever is happening , it is beginning to worry top film executives . &quot; We are going_to be in big trouble if we can ' t find a way to reach this audience , &quot; says Caravan Pictures chief Joe Roth . &quot; As a generation , they don ' t feel a part of the tribal rite of going_to the movies . The habit just isn ' t there , which doesn ' t bode well for the future of movies. &quot; Roth believes Generation X-ers are going_to see big hits like &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; or &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; but not movies about themselves . &quot; It ' s troublesome , because a big part of filmgoing has always been using movies as a way of identifying with your personal experience -- of wanting to see movies that speak directly to you , &quot; he says . &quot; But that ' s not true for today ' s young audience . If it was , ' Reality Bites ' would have had the kind of impact of ' American Graffiti. ' &quot; Why does Pearl Jam , MTV ' s &quot; The Real_World &quot; and even &quot; Melrose Place &quot; seem to connect with a generational sensibility that has so far eluded Hollywood ' s cinematic reach ? Are today ' s filmmakers out of touch with their own generation ? Or are young moviegoers wary of any generational portraits , regardless of how grungy or gloomy the sketch ? To find some answers -- or at least hear some intriguing theories -- we sought_out a variety of Generation X commentators ( and a_few token baby_boomers ) from the cutting edges of popular culture . They volunteered some savvy -- and startling -- opinions about their generation ' s disquieting sense of malaise about moviegoing . Too_Much Reality &quot; Why on Earth would you want to sit in a movie_theater in your checkered shirt and Army boots and watch movie characters sitting around complaining in their checkered shirts and Army boots ? , &quot; says Toby Hood , 26 , national manager of college radio promotion at MCA Records . &quot; Why not just walk_out the door , go_down the street and see it for yourself ? &quot; &quot; I have close friends who really resemble that Ethan Hawke character , &quot; says Kalle Matso , 26-year-old film critic for the weekly Manhattan Beach newspaper the Beach Reporter . &quot; But if they have time to catch a flick , they ' d go see ' Belle Epoque ' or ' Die Hard 3. ' The last thing they ' d want to see is Hollywood ' s take_on Generation X. &quot; &quot; At 25 , I ' ve got_to deal with a delinquent American Express card , car payments -- I ' m living beyond my means , &quot; says Damon Lee , an assistant to the producer on John Singleton ' s &quot; Higher Learning. &quot; &quot; Johnny Depp ' s a great actor , but when I go_to a movie , I don ' t want to see someone with more problems than me. &quot; The Video Alternative &quot; I never go_to movies -- there ' s too_much emotional intensity in seeing things on the big screen , &quot; says Shann Nix , 27 , a San Francisco-based novelist and talk-show host . &quot; We ' re VCR babies . We ' re very fragile . We like to hold things at a distance . With video , the impact of movies isn ' t so overwhelming . You can be in control . You can stop , start , fast-forward . You can ' t do that in a movie theater. &quot; &quot; This is the first generation that grew_up without having to go_to a theater to see a movie , &quot; says Andy Fleming , 31 , director of the new Generation X film &quot; Threesome. &quot; &quot; When I was growing_up , if you didn ' t see a movie right away , it disappeared . Now you can find it anywhere -- on cable , on home video . There ' s no urgency to seeing it in a theater. &quot; &quot; I was in a theater the other night when a trailer came_on for a film that ' s probably going_to be the No . 2 summer movie at a major Hollywood studio , &quot; recalls Joe Roth . &quot; And when it was over , some guy in the back of the theater yelled out , ' Video ! ' And half the theater applauded . I got a chill down my spine , because I was thinking -- that could ' ve been one of my films. &quot; X Economics &quot; Everything about the economics of our core-audience demographic points to our movie being a smash on home video , &quot; says &quot; Reality Bites &quot; producer Michael Shamberg . &quot; Maybe we can ' t get them to pay $ 7 to see a movie in a theater . But I bet they ' ll pay $ 2 to see it on video. &quot; &quot; I only go see movies if I don ' t think they ' re ever going_to show_up on home video , &quot; says Jim Barber , 31 , an Atlanta-based A &amp; R executive at Geffen Records . &quot; Some of it ' s just economics . If I buy a CD , I have it forever . A movie ' s a one-time thing . Sometimes you remember it the next day and sometimes you don ' t. &quot; &quot; When we analyze material , &quot; says Michael De Luca , 28 , president of production at New Line Cinema , &quot; the first thing we ask is , ' Why would someone pay $ 7.50 to see this ? ' &quot; The X Brand &quot; Our generation doesn ' t exist -- that ' s why no one ' s going_to see these movies , &quot; says Nix . &quot; Today ' s kids have rap and Thrasher magazine and the jeans-hanging-down-to-your-knees street stuff . that ' s a genuine subculture that horrifies adults . We were just cute and confused . We never had an aesthetic of our own. &quot; &quot; It ' s pretty dubious who Generation X really is , &quot; says Nina Jacobson , 28 , vice_president of production at Universal Pictures . &quot; Just because we have a name for it doesn ' t mean it actually exists . Mostly , I think it exists in the mind of the media. &quot; &quot; It was a cultural phenomenon that was labeled before it actually happened , &quot; contends Fleming . &quot; Remember what Nietzsche said : ' If you name something , you kill it. ' &quot; &quot; We never refer to our audience as Generation X-ers , &quot; says Doug Herzog , MTV ' s senior_vice_president of programming . &quot; They don ' t want to be categorized . They really resent it . If they feel overanalyzed by the media , they rebel against it. &quot; &quot; We cringed when we saw all_the advance articles talking_about our movie as a Generation X statement , &quot; says Bruce Feldman , senior_vice_president of marketing and promotion at Universal . &quot; We were aiming for a much broader audience . But once the press labeled it that way , it became a picture only for the X Generation. &quot; Too Hip &quot; Movies like ' Kalifornia ' and ' True Romance ' were too hip for their own good , &quot; says De Luca . &quot; The kids in movies like ' Reality Bites ' are white , upscale and a little whiny . I don ' t see the young Axl Roses out there in Indiana feeling that they can share_in that experience. &quot; &quot; The Ethan Hawke character in ' Reality Bites ' was a total phony , &quot; says Stan Evans , 30 , a producer of E ! ' s &quot; Talk Soup. &quot; &quot; It turned me off . It was as if the only way to be cool was to be totally detached -- you know , the nobility of sitting on a couch , full of deep , pretentious phrases. &quot; &quot; Maybe the ' slacker ' character is a little off-putting , &quot; says producer Shamberg . &quot; In retrospect , if the Ethan Hawke character had been conceived_of as more of an everyman , it might have struck_a_chord with a broader male audience. &quot; Immediacy &quot; The soundtracks to ' Singles ' and ' Reality Bites ' speak_to what the movies are about much better than the movies do , &quot; says Barber . &quot; Music is more immediate . No matter how personal his movie is , Ben Stiller needs hundreds of people and $ 10 million or $ 20 million to make_it . Our hottest record right now , ' Loser ' by Beck , was done_in one night on an eight-track machine in the guy ' s house. &quot; &quot; When a band makes a record , they don ' t have four executives show_up in the studio and say , ' So , what are the marketing possibilities ? ' &quot; says Hood . &quot; When too many people have too_much input in the creative process , it loses what makes_it personal and intuitive. &quot; &quot; People connect a lot more with the Wednesday-night TV_shows -- ' Melrose Place ' and ' Beverly Hills , 90210 , ' &quot; says Mark Lewman , 26 , editor of Dirt magazine . &quot; They just seem more timely , more in touch with people our age . The next day it ' s all we talk_about -- everyone has a morbid fascination with them. &quot; Don ' t Believe the Hype &quot; Having a movie made about us automatically gets our back_up , &quot; says Nix . &quot; We ' re like jeans -- we come pre-faded and pre-jaded . We hate being labeled . So by definition , anything designed specifically for us is offensive. &quot; &quot; If your movie looks anything like a Hollywood movie , the Gen X audience will be a hard_sell , &quot; says De Luca . &quot; The marketing on ' Reality Bites ' just smelled of Hollywood trying to be hip . I liked the movie . But did you see its poster -- with the graffiti on the wall saying , ' movie poster ' ? It said : Look how hip we are . It made me immediately not want to see the movie. &quot; &quot; The way Hollywood handled ' True Romance ' was typical , &quot; says Hood . &quot; They would n ' t let Quentin Tarantino direct it . Instead , they took a movie that was aimed at a generation that totally loathes commercials and hired a guy to direct it ( Tony Scott ) who makes millions doing what -- making commercials. &quot; &quot; To me , ' Reality Bites ' was so ersatz -- it ' s a TV version of my reality , &quot; says Barber . &quot; It was like a Hollywood attempt to take my life , package it and sell it back to me. &quot; Baby-Boomer Anxiety &quot; There ' s as much a wall between Generation X and the baby_boomers as there was between the boomers and their parents , &quot; says Shamberg . &quot; It ' s almost like the boomers ' motto is : Don ' t Trust Anyone Under 30. &quot; &quot; A lot of these movies scare_off older audiences , &quot; says Herzog . &quot; They look_at the characters and say , ' Who are these people ? ' &quot; &quot; It was really interesting to see how totally irritated Siskel and Ebert were that Winona Ryder went_off with Ethan Hawke instead of Ben Stiller , &quot; says De Luca . &quot; They kept saying -- he lies on the couch all day , he ' s a slob , he doesn ' t have a job . Why didn ' t she go_off with the responsible guy ? They didn ' t see the movie as critics . They saw it as parents. &quot; Prognostications &quot; The Gen X movie that will probably go_over the top won ' t be one that ' s authentic and has all these brooding guys in goatees , &quot; says Matso . &quot; It ' ll probably be like ' Jurassic X Park. ' A movie with X-ers , but with special_effects by ILM. &quot; &quot; It ' s sort of nerdly to go_to a Hollywood film these days , &quot; says Nix . &quot; When you think_of Hollywood , you think_of Exxon and Coca-Cola . It ' s much more cool to stay home and watch a black- and-white ' 50s movie on video. &quot; &quot; It all depends_on how you define the movie , &quot; says Jacobson . &quot; ' Indecent Proposal ' was about the economic struggles of a young married_couple . ' The Firm ' was totally about being twenty-something in the ' 90s . They were both big hits . I don ' t think our batting_average is different from any other generation. &quot; &quot; You make movies about people , not about generations , &quot; says Fleming . &quot; It was probably a lot easier before it occurred to people that there was a generation between being in high_school and getting married. &quot; &quot; Ben Stiller and Ethan Hawke are going_to go_on to make lots of movies that ' ll be big successes , &quot; says Shamberg . &quot; It may be that there ' s a box-office ceiling on this generation ' s subject_matter . But I don ' t think there ' s a ceiling on their sensibility. &quot; Benchmarks , Dude ? The iconography of Generation X , as defined by some of the sights and sounds of the ' 70s depicted in &quot; Reality Bites &quot; : Rerun of &quot; The Brady Bunch &quot; Rerun of &quot; Star Trek : The Next Generation &quot; &quot; Charlie ' s Angels &quot; lunch box Poster of &quot; Saturday Night Fever &quot; Poster of John Travolta Ceramic statuette of Dr. Zaius from &quot; Planet of the Apes &quot; Rerun of &quot; One Day at a Time &quot; The Knack ' s &quot; My Sharona &quot; Peter Frampton ' s &quot; Baby , I Love Your Way &quot; Rerun of &quot; Good Times &quot; Dialogue reference : Gary Coleman Poster of Sean Cassidy Rated Gen X A look_at how Generation X films have fared at the box_office : 04 # 31 , 16 # 12 , 10 Film ( Distributor ) Release Date Gross Screens * ( Millions ) Heathers ( New World ) March 31 , 1989 $ 1.1 54 sex , lies , and videotape ( Miramax ) July 28 , 1989 24.6 534 Edward Scissorhands ( Fox ) Dec . 7 , 1990 54.2 1 # 372 Slacker ( Orion Classics ) July 5 , 1991 1.1 50 Singles ( Warner Bros. ) Sept . 18 , 1992 18.5 1 # 330 Untamed Heart ( MGM ) Feb . 12 , 1993 18.8 783 Bodies , Rest and Motion ( Fine Line ) April 9 , 1993 0.7 49 Benny &amp; Joon ( MGM ) April 16 , 1993 23.1 1 # 314 Three of Hearts ( New Line ) April 30 , 1993 5.5 792 Poetic Justice ( Columbia ) July 23 , 1993 27.5 1 # 285 Kalifornia ( Gramercy ) Sept . 3 , 1993 2.4 359 True Romance ( Warner Bros. ) Sept . 10 , 1993 12.3 1 # 254 Dazed and Confused ( Gramercy ) Sept . 24 , 1993 8.0 282 What ' s Eating Gilbert Grape ?
