   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; A CULTURAL DIFFERENCE WITH BOTTOM-LINE EFFECTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1970 , more_than 90 # 000 people were working in high-tech jobs inside Boston ' s Route 128 . In California ' s Silicon_Valley , 60 # 000 were so employed . Twenty years later , Silicon_Valley ' s employment exploded to 265 # 000 , while Route 128 grew to just 150 # 000 . Furthermore , in 1990 , 39 of the 100 fastest-growing electronics firms in the country called Silicon_Valley home ; only four were headquartered in Route 128 . 1992 total sales of Silicon_Valley ' s largest public companies rose to a record $ 77 billion , an increase of more_than 15 % . Route 128 ' s major computer firms -- Digital Equipment Corp. , Wang , Prime and Data General -- experienced spectacular failures and retrenchment . Why the gap in achievement ? In her new book , &quot; Regional Advantage : Culture and Competition in Silicon_Valley and Route 128 , &quot; Berkeley professor AnnaLee Saxenian explains that the Silicon_Valley greatly benefited from the state ' s open , entrepreneurial yet highly collaborative business culture . Saxenian ' s findings are important because they highlight the fundamental organizational practices behind California ' s economic successes in several key sectors , a reality dangerously ignored by many of the state ' s political and business_leaders . None of the industrial-development proposals currently emanating from state and federal_governments -- R &amp; D subsidies , consortia , &quot; conversion &quot; grants , training schemes , access to technology , capital and major research universities , or encouraging &quot; clusters &quot; of firms in related industries -- explains why Silicon_Valley boomed and Route 128 didn ' t . Both regions enjoyed similar resources . But unlike the inflexible , cradle-to-grave employment typical of Massachusetts , Silicon_Valley ' s culture encouraged talented engineers to leave their companies and join or open new ones . As a result , cutting-edge managerial and technical knowledge was spread around and informal , but crucial business links created . Route 128 companies tended to be vertically integrated , doing most phases of a product ' s design and manufacturing in-house ; Silicon_Valley ' s perfected a system of collaborative subcontracting in which companies specialized in one or two design or manufacturing tasks , then combined their expertise with other highly specialized suppliers to produce a continually improving array of new , advanced products . In head-to-head competition , California ' s approach , which Saxenian calls a &quot; network &quot; economy , repeatedly outperformed Route 128 in adjusting to new market trends . Silicon_Valley became so good at this game that it not only displaced its Massachusetts competitors , it also beat_back a challenge from the prototype network economy , Japan . This history offers important economic-development lessons . More_than technology , capital and infrastructure are needed to compete successfully in the global economy . Most important is the ability to stimulate and sustain a culture of openness , opportunity , collaboration and entreprenuerialism . Regions able to organize their economies along these lines spawn industries that constantly learn , develop new products and adapt to a world in which even the most sophisticated breakthrough can be copied virtually overnight by cheaper producers from somewhere else . The good news is that California is unquestionably one of the world ' s most hospitable places for network economies . Indeed , the core of the state ' s industrial base is organized much like Silicon_Valley ' s , resulting in such thriving sectors as entertainment , computers , agriculture , business services , medical equipment and fashion . This advantage allowed California to perform better during the last recession than many other areas that , on the surface , seemed healthier . From peak to trough , California lost 4.8 % of its non-farm employment . New York and New Jersey each lost more_than 7 % , and Massachusetts , a staggering 11.5 % . If heavily defense-dependent Los Angeles County is excluded from the figures , the remaining parts of the state lost just 1.8 % of their non-farm jobs from an employment base larger than New York or Texas -- a better record than such supposedly &quot; lucky &quot; states as Illinois , Ohio or North Carolina . The bad news is that much of California ' s business and political elite is not only unaware of this economic reality , their policies often work against expanding the industrial culture Saxenian describes . Particularly misguided , for example , is the language of withdrawal , closure and insularity that has infected the politics of regulatory reform , trade and immigration . Neither the notion of ruggedly individualistic &quot; cowboy &quot; firms -- which either want to be left alone or they ' ll ride_away to greener pastures -- nor the idea of an economy protected from international trade and purged of its burgeoning Latino and Asian participants -- which have rates of learning achievement and income increases several times higher than the statewide average -- is consistent with building and maintaining the collaborative relationships state industries need to survive . Route 128 ' s decline illustrates the danger of ignoring industrial fundamentals . For years , the Massachusetts High_Technology Council lobbied for lower taxes to improve a &quot; bad &quot; business climate . At the same time , however , no one was paying_attention to Route 128 ' s real competitive challenge -- building more flexible technology- and product-development relationships . Massachusetts eventually enacted pro-business tax reforms , only to see its treasured high-tech industrial base decline even more rapidly . Equally troublesome are the big-science , retraining and R &amp; D programs relentlessly pushed by state and federal_officials to &quot; save &quot; California . Such programs inevitably end_up subsidizing and protecting politically savvy but industrially dysfunctional groups at the expense of network economies . Ironically , many of the organizations favored by such policies exhibit cultures that crippled Route 128 . No party or individual is now putting forth a political message consistent with the network economies that Saxenian describes . The essential starting_point for such a strategy would be to adopt the networks ' core values of openness , opportunity and regional responsibility as baseline political principles guiding public policy . Government efforts would then be reoriented to support activities consistent with network creation . States such_as Pennsylvania have shaped their economic_policies according to this strategy , insisting that regulatory , tax , financial and other business incentives be coupled with explicit commitments by private-sector recipients to foster regional relationships . The widespread diffusion of Silicon_Valley practices enabled California to generate jobs and assimilate a diverse population on an unprecedented scale . Perhaps one day the state will create a political_system worthy of its remarkable industrial achievements. *</TEXT>
