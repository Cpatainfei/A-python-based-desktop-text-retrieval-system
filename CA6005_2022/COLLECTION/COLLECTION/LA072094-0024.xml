   <TEXT> Romare Bearden is certainly the most renowned African American artist of his generation and that ' s wrong . Wrong because there are not more of them , worse because no artist ' s gifts should be confined or promoted within a category of race . Bearden was one of the best artists of his generation , period . Further evidence of this comes_with the L.A. County Museum of Art ' s newly opened exhibition , &quot; A Graphic Odyssey : Romare Bearden as Printmaker. &quot; Consisting of more_than 100 lithographs , monoprints , collagraphs , screenprints and etchings , it is the most comprehensive show of his graphic work to date . It was organized and circulated by the Council for Creative Projects , New York , and coordinated here by LACMA curator Bruce Davis . The show proves the artist a graphic innovator possessed of a thoughtful , cultivated humanistic sensibility . He studied at Boston University , Columbia and the Sorbonne . He started in math , went_on to cartooning and got hooked on modernism in Paris , where he met Brancusi and Braque , among others . One of his influential teachers was the satirical German Expressionist master George Grosz . Bearden shared his realism but not his bile . His work makes him look_like a contemporary of such artists as Ben Shahn and Stuart Davis , combining the social conscience of the one with the jazzy modernism of the other . Davis was a friend and mentor who , rather paradoxically , furthered Bearden ' s love of jazz by urging him to listen to &quot; the silences between the notes , &quot; a poetic concept that nudged Bearden further along toward an interest in Zen . Actually Bearden was younger , outliving both of them by nearly two decades . He was 76 when he died in 1988 . Closer in age to the Abstract Expressionists , Bearden first exhibited alongside Robert Motherwell and Adolph Gottlieb . He admired their work but was determined to make art that mirrored the experience of black Americans . That put him out of mainstream fashion and slowed his recognition . Significantly , during the lean years he made ends meet as a social_worker . His trademark images came_to be collages of unsettling expressive power . Photographic heads and other details give meaning to shapes in cut and torn paper that would appear purely decorative and abstract out of context . If anything his prints improve on this technique by unifying the inevitable scrappiness of pure paste-up . His range was remarkable . Many of these images are based on childhood memories of his birthplace in North Carolina , where black people then lived_in cabins by the railroad_tracks . Trains haunt his work with poignant implications . They symbolize the power to take a man away from his home or bring him to a promised land . The pain of separation resonates in a scene of lovers parting at dawn in &quot; Before the First Whistle. &quot; Bearden ' s tendency to rumination reflects in &quot; The Trains. &quot; Some 10 color variations on heads of women in front of a locomotive confirm his power as master of moody orchestration of hue . His reverie is haunted by women dressed in long colorful skirts and heads tied_in bandannas . Bravery is bespoken by the contrast between ramshackle surroundings and cheerful dress . The &quot; Girl in the Garden &quot; wears watermelon-pink gingham . &quot; Pepper Jelly Lady &quot; contrasts its own sonorous palette with a beautiful monochrome hand-drawn frame . A monumental female figure takes_back some of the power of indigenous African art appropriated by Picasso . Like the great Catalan , Bearden extended his range to classic myth . He made Odysseus a black hero and equated his wanderings with the Diaspora of Africans taken by the slave_trade . He was good at this , but his thoughts ever came_home to Manhattan where he mainly lived . He participated in the pan-artistic Harlem Renaissance . The superiority of_his_own poetry and prose put him at_ease with writers . His understanding of abstract orchestration opened friendships with great jazz_musicians like Duke Ellington and Earl ( Fatha ) Hines . His jazz-inspired imagery , unlike Davis ' terse abstraction , never lost sight of the guys playing the music . Occasionally he ' d do a witty stylization like the Cuboid &quot; Alto Saxophone , &quot; but usually he stayed funky . In &quot; Jazz II &quot; a pianist leers merrily at the crowd with a big cigarette stuck_in the corner of his smile . Reminds you of Stuart Davis ' story about jazz clubs so tough they had to put barbed wire around the piano . Bearden was never barbed . His art knew the pain of the blues , but , he said , &quot; Even though you go_through these terrible experiences , you come_out feeling good . that ' s what the blues say and that ' s what I believe -- life will prevail. &quot; * Los Angeles County Museum of Art , 5905 Wilshire Blvd. , through Sept . 11 . Closed Mondays and Tuesdays . Information : ( 213 ) 857-6000 .</TEXT>
