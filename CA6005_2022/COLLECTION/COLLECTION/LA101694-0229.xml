   <HEADLINE> GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO ; DESTINATION : SAN FRANCISCO ; TASTE OF TRAVEL : SAN FRANCISCO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that I no longer live_in Northern California , I seem to be sending an inordinate number of friends off to San Francisco for a_few days . I enjoy pulling_out a map of the city and marking it up with all my old haunts -- coffeehouses , bookstores , eccentric shops , flea_markets , farmers markets , picnic spots , long walks . Then comes the pleasurable business of deciding where to send them to eat . I can easily get carried_away . If they ' ve got three nights , I ' ve got 10 restaurants . ( Well , it is hard to get_into some of them on short notice. ) I do , however , custom-tailor the list to budget , personality and circumstance . And this fall , due_to a rash of recent restaurant openings , I ' ve added a_few new names . Still at the head of the class is Chez Panisse -- upstairs or down . ( If you don ' t reserve well ahead for Jean-Pierre Moulles extraordinary cooking in the more formal downstairs restaurant , you will definitely be eating_in the upstairs cafe. ) But not everybody is ambitious enough to make the trek across the bay to Berkeley , even though by L.A. standards this commute is a piece_of_cake . When I mull_over the restaurants in San Francisco I love , though , it turns_out most of them are French . French restaurants have been a presence since the city ' s early years . These days , it ' s not the formal French cooking of Masa ' s or Fleur de Lys that intrigues me , but the earthier bistros and cafes . The fact that I don ' t have a single Italian restaurant on my list says a great_deal about the difference between San Francisco and Los Angeles . ( If I weren ' t restricting this list to San Francisco , Oliveto in Oakland , where former Chez Panisse chef Paul Bertolli is now cooking Tuscan country fare , would be enthusiastically included. ) Or maybe it ' s that in Los Angeles I miss a certain kind of sensual French cooking . And when I do make a brief foray back to San Francisco , these are a_few of the places I look_forward to visiting . * Zuni Cafe . After Chez Panisse , I think first of 15-year-old Zuni Cafe on Market Street . Everyone I ' ve ever sent to this eccentric , beloved place has fallen_in_love with Zuni ' s mix of old and new San Francisco ( society meets artsy South-of-Market ) and earthy French-Mediterranean cooking . The kitchen is ruled by Judy Rodgers , whose fate was decided when she spent a year as a high_school exchange student living with the family of the late three-star chef Jean Troisgros in Burgundy . Here , there is a required menu : First , a glass of Veuve Clicquot brut and an iced platter of raw shellfish from the little stand perched on the sidewalk outside , just like in Paris . Oysters , clams and periwinkles are served with crusty sourdough loaves from Acme ( the Bay Area equivalent of La Brea Bakery ) . Then you have to have the house-cured anchovies with slivers of celery and Parmesan , a comforting bowl of porridge-like polenta with a dollop of mascarpone , feathery light ricotta and spinach gnocchi , perhaps some kind of fish braised in the wood-burning brick oven . But always , always the crisp-skinned roast chicken for two with a Tuscan bread salad doused with Champagne vinaigrette . Travelers take_note : Zuni is open virtually all day -- even for lunch on Saturday . * Restaurant LuLu and LuLu Bis . Restaurant LuLu , in the burgeoning South-of-Market area not far from the new Yerba Buena Gardens Center for the Arts , has been a runaway hit since the day it opened nearly two years ago . Inspired by Zuni , LuLu is a much bigger place , one notch down in price , with a wood-burning pizza oven and wood-fired rotisserie as focal_points . Chef / owner Reed Hearon , who worked with Mark Miller at the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe , turns_out rustic family-style dishes from the_French and Italian Riviera . I ' ve had some very appealing dishes here , mostly first courses like the plump , juicy iron skillet-roasted mussels , fried artichokes with Parmesan , wood oven-roasted Portobello mushroom with fresh corn-studded polenta . Zero_in on the grilled spot prawns with romesco sauce too . Side_dishes such_as olive_oil mashed potatoes and Romano beans with lemon and olive_oil are good , but I haven ' t been all that impressed with the main_courses . The very rotisserie items that look so enticing -- the squab wrapped in pancetta and served with brilliant green fava_beans and crinkly morel mushrooms , the rosemary chicken or the pork_loin with fennel , garlic and olive_oil -- just don ' t have that much flavor . For dessert , there ' s sometimes a refreshing trompe l ' oeil wedge of melon ice . LuLu is actually two restaurants ( three , if you count the adjoining cafe where you can get breakfast , take-out items , antipasti and a quick dinner ) . Next door is the much smaller LuLu Bis , where Hearon offers a three- or four-course prix_fixe meal with several choices at $ 21 or $ 27 . You eat family style at long communal tables , much the way you did at San Francisco ' s traditional Basque restaurants . * Fringale . Slang for &quot; the urge to eat , &quot; Fringale ( pronounced frin-GAL ) is a highly appropriate name for this companionable South-of-Market bistro . It is a tiny slip of a place , always crowded , very French , with a terrific price-quality ratio and utterly delicious French bistro food . It is also tremendously popular , so it ' s difficult to get a table on short notice . ( You can , however , eat_at the bar. ) The chef is Gerald Hirigoyen from Biarritz , France ; the waiters are French , a little brusque , but very authentic , non ? The smart little wine list has some gems like Fonsalette , the Cotes du Rhone from Chateau Rayas . Start with a classic frisee salad with warm bacon dressing or the immensely satisfying platter of duck confit , smoked duck breast and a slab of unctuous pink foie_gras . Next comes a heap of fragrant steamed mussels garnished with fried garlic and parsley , a truly wonderful confit of duck leg almost hidden beneath a hillock of tiny French lentils or slow-braised veal short ribs , tender and gelatinous , with thick strips of parsnip . I dream about Hirigoyen ' s marinated roast rack_of_lamb ; it ' s that flavorful . Don ' t forget a side of green_beans or comforting gratin of potatoes and cream . And for dessert : almondy ga teau basque and a divine cherry clafoutis . * Bizou . A few doors down from Fringale is a moderately priced corner bistro with the affectionate word &quot; Bizou &quot; ( little kiss ) , spelled_out in tall old-fashioned French block_letters . A profusion of sweet-smelling herbs and lavenders spill from the window_boxes . Inside , the high-ceiling space has been painted a glorious shade of goldenrod . A small bar , a_couple_of old paintings , a vase of lilies set high on a shelf , faux bamboo chairs with irises stenciled onto the wooden seats complete the endearing picture of a modest bistro in some far-flung corner of Paris . Chef / owner Loretta Keller ' s heartfelt cooking evokes the tastes and smells of Provence . Her wonderful little salads and first courses interest me more_than the main_courses . I ' m certainly not going_to pass_up the dreamy house-cured salt_cod layered with potatoes and onions and cream or the plate of violet Provencal-style octopus and the pasta called orzo scented with winter_savory for mere grilled duck breast or tuna . One night the small , appealing menu included warm fava_bean and artichoke salad strewn with nasturtium petals and shaved pecorino , a velvety terrine of rabbit and duck livers and a soup of pureed grilled vegetables loaded with what looked_like baby clams , but were actually . . . cockles ! And I do love the beef cheek &quot; Sainte-Menehoulde &quot; ( yes , indeed ) , marinated in red_wine , braised slowly and then finished_off with a crisp coating of mustard and bread crumbs -- perfect with a Gigondas or Chateauneuf-du-Pape rouge . Follow it with summer bread pudding stained blood red with berries -- not really French , but then Keller is refreshingly undogmatic . * Bistro M . Ebullient entrepreneur / author / chef Michel Richard , who jets around the country opening offshoots of his celebrated Los Angeles restaurant Citrus , has moved_in_on San Francisco . This summer he opened his latest place , Bistro M , in the stylish new Hotel Milano next door to Nordstrom downtown . It ' s a long skinny space with a striking painted mural overhead running the entire length of the restaurant . The operative word here is bistro ; don ' t expect a menu as ambitious as his L.A. restaurant Citrus . While at this point it doesn ' t seem the food will set the town on_fire , Richard and chef Anthony Pels are doing some very nice things . I could happily lunch on the &quot; charcuterie tower , &quot; three tiers of salami , ruddy prosciutto and country-style duck_pate served with rough-textured , crusty bread . The two are to be commended for offering a real cheese course , your choice of four or six cheeses , including a good Roquefort and tete de moins , a hard cheese served in ruffled shavings . The bistro ' s menu is strong on straightforward French comfort food such_as a lovely platter of steamed vegetables with a little crock of aioli or boudin parmentier : crumbled homemade blood_sausage topped with buttery potato puree . At lunch , Bistro M offers a three-course menu for just $ 15 ( green_salad , duck confit , mirabelle plums with vanilla-bean ice_cream , par example ) . Desserts from this master patissier are worth every calorie . * Alain Rondelli . Another favorite of mine , Alain Rondelli is a savvy neighborhood French restaurant in the Richmond district , between Golden Gate Park and the Marina . Since he left Ernie ' s to open his own place last year , the Paris-born chef , who worked six years as second-in-command to Marc Meneau at his three-star restaurant in Burgundy , has been putting_in long hours behind the stove at this 48-seat restaurant . I know I ' ll find things such_as mussels in an orange-and-saffron-scented broth , perfect slabs of foie_gras sandwiched between slices of tender brioche , tripe simmered all night long in red_wine and rich , concentrated pot au feu made with lamb , instead of beef . When he first opened , the space was a bit stark ; it ' s much more comfortable now . And a good thing , too , since Rondelli is now offering a 20-course ( yes , that ' s 20 ) Menu Ambroisie that takes about five or six hours to eat . He prepares this Gargantuan meal only on Wednesdays , Thursdays or Sundays by reservation three weeks ahead . Initially , he would prepare it for a minimum of four ; now it ' s just two . The price for this grande bouffe is $ 150 per person . * Rubicon . When New York restaurateur Drew Nieporent of Manhattan ' s celebrated le Montrachet comes_to town to open a restaurant with celebrity investors such_as Robert de Niro , Robin Williams and Francis Ford Coppola in tow , it creates quite a stir . Rubicon , in fact , takes its name from director and winery owner Coppola ' s flagship Napa Valley Cabernet . The chef is Traci Des Jardins , who cooked at Joachim Splichal ' s Patina in Los Angeles and most recently at Elka in San Francisco . The wine director is Larry Stone from Charlie Trotter in Chicago , one of the top sommeliers in the country . Rubicon ' s two-story space in the heart of the financial district looks_like a buttoned-down banker ' s restaurant , reminiscent_of San Francisco ' s historic Jack ' s or Sam ' s Grill -- but without the patina . I ' ll brave the austere decor for the wines : It ' s thrilling to see so many hard-to-find wines all on one intelligently conceived list . Des Jardins ' Splichal-influenced menu -- is less adventurous . Dishes such_as scallops with truffled mashed potatoes in a buttery , rich sauce or filet of beef with big slices of grilled Portobello are clearly designed with wine in mind . And to finish_off that bottle of Pinot_noir , there ' s a respectable cheese plate with warm walnut raisin_bread . * The Heights . Charles Solomon , who cooked at Bouley in New York , was chef at a wonderful little restaurant called Geordy ' s in an alley off Union Square . That closed last year ; now he ' s back as chef / owner ( with partner David Wartell ) at a new place , The Heights , set_in a romantic Moorish-inspired house in Presidio Heights . Its three intimate dining_rooms are furnished with candlelit tables and comfortable chairs slipcovered in a black-and-white vegetable print . The waiters wear elegant waistcoats to match . This is a restaurant for grown-ups , quiet enough to converse over a leisurely dinner . The guy can cook . One night ' s ameuse geule was gutsy , warm fresh sardines in balsamic vinegar jolted with lime and grapefruit . Then we had a belon oyster_stew with fingerling potatoes , leeks and cream and a stunning warm lobster salad with bitter braised endive and a feisty horseradish cream . He served skate in a beautifully modulated tomato-caper sauce and superb baby lamb cooked three ways . Desserts are equally well crafted ; he even makes his own dainty chocolates . * Hayes Street Grill . For a quintessential San Francisco experience , I fancy the Hayes Street Grill at lunch when light streams in the skylights . It is a wonderful restaurant for pristinely fresh_fish prepared with skill and respect . Since reinventing the San Francisco grill in 1979 , along with more creative fare , Hayes Street has offered a selection of plain grilled fish with a choice of classic sauces . A recent summer lunch stands_out in my mind : a marvelously delicate fritto misto ( mixed fry ) of tiny fried calamari , pale yellow wax_beans and deep green_beans and an assortment of squash accompanied by a gloriously garlicky aioli ; Tuscan-style sand_sole with lemon and rosemary , thumb-sized artichokes and knobbly fingerling potatoes ; sweet , custardy sand_dabs meuniere , cooked on the bone and served with a pile of brassy gold fries . And then a blackberry ice so intense , three baskets of berries must have gone_into one serving . * Postrio . Wolfgang Puck ' s sole San Francisco restaurant Postrio has been a hot reservation ever since it opened in 1989 . When you call_for a dinner reservation , a recorded voice advises callers that one of the &quot; reservationists &quot; will be with you shortly . Since we ' ve got ample chance to sample Puck ' s cooking in Los Angeles , bypass all that bother and go instead to breakfast at Postrio -- that ' s a Puck meal you can ' t get_in L.A. No reservations ; just waltz right in and right down that grand staircase . You get the same swell service , a large table to spread_out the juicy bits of the Chronicle and all_the time in the world to tuck_in a splendid breakfast : homemade duck sausages , heavenly soft-scrambled eggs loaded with lobster and mascarpone , hand-chopped corned_beef hash topped with perfect poached eggs . . . . And this ideal restaurant experience sets you back just a fraction of the price of dinner . GUIDEBOOK / San Francisco Eats Alain Rondelli , 126 Clement St . Closed Monday , Tuesday and lunch .
