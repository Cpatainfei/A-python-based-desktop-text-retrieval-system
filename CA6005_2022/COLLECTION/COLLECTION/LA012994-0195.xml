   <HEADLINE> TICKETMASTER , SONY AND OTHERS PLAN MTV RIVAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A consortium of major entertainment companies composed of Time Warner , Sony Corp. , Thorn EMI , PolyGram and Ticketmaster are expected to announce Monday plans to launch a global video music channel to compete against MTV , industry sources said . The new music video channel is conceived as a high-tech version of MTV where viewers would also be able to shop for concert and sports tickets , CDs and other music and entertainment_industry merchandise , according to people familiar_with the plan . The four entertainment companies -- among the world ' s biggest producers and distributors of recorded music -- would be able to supply the new channel with a steady flow of music videos and other entertainment programming . But a key element of the plan is the inclusion of Ticketmaster , the national ticketing service , which was taken_over by Seattle investor Paul Allen last year . Allen is a shareholder and co-founder of computer software giant Microsoft . Sources said Allen wants to use Ticketmaster as a launch_pad into the coming age of interactive television and has been having talks with several of the cable industry ' s biggest players , including Liberty Media Corp. , the programming arm of Tele-Communications Inc. The consortium is not expected to launch its music channel until 1995 and will concentrate initially on fast-growing overseas markets that are just beginning to receive cable TV . The promise of mixing MTV ' s lucrative child and young adult audience with home shopping has also spurred MTV to begin testing the sale of CDs and other music industry merchandise later this year , with the possibility of launching a new MTV-oriented home shopping channel . Although Time Warner is the country ' s second-largest cable TV operator and would be able to support a domestic launch , most cable_systems nonetheless do not have the space to add more channels . Additional channel_capacity on U.S. cable is not expected for several years . Moreover , challenging MTV domestically will not be easy . The pioneer video music channel is in almost every cable TV home , and its sister service , VH-1 , reaches 47 million . MTV claims that worldwide it is available in 251 million homes . In the mid-1980s , cable mogul Ted Turner tried to launch a competitor to MTV , but it failed after a_few months .</TEXT>
