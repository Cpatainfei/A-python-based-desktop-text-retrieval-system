   <HEADLINE> TELLURIDE TAKES JOYRIDE ON INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY ; COLORADO : THE OLD MINING TOWN MAY BE 130 MILES FROM THE NEAREST INTERSTATE HIGHWAY , SPONSORS SAY , BUT IT ' S ON THE ROAD TO PROGRESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Jake Burns ' friends leave town he keeps_in touch by e-mail , and when he needs to do a school report on what ' s left of war-torn Yugoslavia , he contacts people there over the Internet computer_network . The high_school junior can do_it all without calling long-distance because Telluride has &quot; InfoZone. &quot; &quot; I e-mail other friends to see if I can find any cheap stockbrokers for friends here , &quot; said Burns , 17 , who has had his own computer &quot; since first or second grade &quot; and has given_up his supermarket job to run Telluride Ski Co. ' s computer_system on weekends . The nonprofit Telluride Institute oversees the 6-month-old &quot; InfoZone &quot; project linking computer users with Internet without having to call long-distance . A sparsely populated resort town 130 miles from the nearest interstate highway , Telluride is an unlikely stop on the information superhighway . It is an old mining town with 1 # 500 year-round residents , surrounded by 13 # 000-foot peaks in the San Juan Mountains and 275 miles southwest of Denver . &quot; We want to be a special little place , a society that matches the scenery , &quot; said Richard Lowenberg , the InfoZone chief at the Telluride Institute . Besides having access to Internet , computer buffs soon will be testing a wireless_telephone system using newly deregulated communications frequencies to tap into information_systems . It will help alleviate the shortage of telephone_lines created by the town ' s growing faster than expected . In addition , by the end of the year the local cable_television system will be set_up for interactive television , offering services ranging from entertainment choices to communications via cable lines . InfoZone sponsors say few places are_better suited to test new ideas -- 70 % of the population have college degrees . The town has so many scientific conferences and art and music festivals that one weekend is devoted to a &quot; Nothing Festival. &quot; Last year , an &quot; Ideas Festival &quot; was held . Gov . Roy Romer was pushing for high-tech development on Colorado ' s Front Range corridor when Lowenberg and others persuaded him to consider Western Slope areas also . A $ 20 # 000 state grant paid_for establishment of a &quot; node &quot; on the Internet system last summer . The state is leasing a data line for residents so they can bypass commercial access systems that require long-distance_calls and can cost $ 15 an hour or more . Apple Computers Inc. donated computers that are stationed around the town in the library , museum , clinic and schools . It ' s not a scheme for subsidizing the local nest of &quot; Lone Eagles , &quot; telecommuters who took their jobs with them to the rural West . There are an estimated 10 million scattered throughout the nation ' s resorts , countryside and small communities , according to Denver ' s Center for the New West . They communicate with their home_offices in the city by fax , personal_computer and telephone . Former Mayor Peter Spencer , a computer_programmer by profession , said people have been making a living here by modem and fax for a decade and do not need outside help . Lowenberg , a former artist and planner who worked in California ' s Silicon_Valley , said the project ' s goal is to empower this rural_area by making information readily available . Some see that as a key in a community whose rapid_growth has led some to call_for a six-month moratorium on new construction . Along the same line , Greg Law , who is_on the InfoZone board , has created an audio-text service that allows callers to get information on town affairs . That can include the upcoming town council agenda , faxed for free simply by phoning into an automated answering service . Lowenberg , who said the institute will monitor use of the new information_system , said that ultimately multidimensional drawings of projects , such_as the proposed expansion of Telluride ski area , could be delivered to residents ' homes . Allen Rowath , a New York expert on network systems , said the Telluride project is &quot; exciting because it means getting better participation in the community. &quot; Rowath helped set_up the InfoZone after being drawn to Telluride by a conversation with Mary-Chapin Carpenter after a folk-music concert . &quot; It also opens the door for more interactive government . I don ' t know if everyone in government wants this or not because it arms people with more information , &quot; Rowath said . &quot; Here in Syracuse , &quot; he said , &quot; you can learn who died in a car wreck , but not how your senators voted. &quot;</TEXT>
