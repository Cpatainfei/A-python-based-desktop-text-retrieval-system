   <HEADLINE> QUESTIONS ON REINFORCING OF FREEWAYS RAISED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With sobering force , Monday ' s earthquake devastated much of Southern California ' s massive roadway system , causing officials to begin reassessing a $ 1.5-billion reinforcement program designed to prevent the state ' s highways from buckling_under seismic stress . The magnitude 6.6 quake caught state_highway engineers in the midst of a costly program to reinforce or retrofit key freeway bridges and interchanges that were considered vulnerable to large temblors . Despite that program , portions of six freeways were closed because of structural damage . The hardest hit were two of the region ' s busiest routes : the Santa Monica Freeway near La Cienega Boulevard , where an elevated portion of roadway buckled onto the street below , and the Golden State Freeway , which was closed by the collapse of an Antelope Valley Freeway overpass . The collapses caused sections of all three freeways to be shut_down . Parts of the Santa Monica Freeway are expected to remain out_of_service for a year to 18 months . &quot; We had what you would call a catastrophic collapse &quot; of those highways , said Jim Drago of the California Department_of_Transportation in Sacramento . &quot; This was a surprise . Obviously the structures did not have sufficient strength to ride_out the forces they were hit with today. &quot; Drago noted that most portions of the roadway system that were reinforced came_through intact , underscoring the importance of the retrofitting program launched after the 1971 Sylmar quake , which toppled freeway overpasses . But the widespread destruction of freeway bridges and overcrossings Monday was a source of consternation among state leaders who thought that the most vulnerable roadways had already been shored_up . Caltrans Director Jim Van Loben Sels said the segments of the Santa Monica Freeway that collapsed at La Cienega Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue were to have been retrofitted this spring . &quot; We had our bridges rated by risk and we had completed our high-risk ones , and we were just moving_on to medium risk , &quot; he said . &quot; In some sense , our program performed well , but not well enough . We didn ' t get them all. &quot; The failure of vital traffic arteries will spark a renewed effort by Caltrans to evaluate highways that may be in need of reinforcement , using data from Monday ' s quake to refine their seismic safety engineering , officials said . Gov . Pete Wilson , asked whether a special inquiry into the retrofitting effort might be warranted , said : &quot; I don ' t think it would be appropriate . I think what we are more interested in doing now is repairing damage , making people safe . &quot; But if an inquiry is in_order . . . let it proceed. &quot; Sen . Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) said she hoped the state would look_into the progress of the retrofitting program on the theory that all freeways should be able to withstand a moderate-size quake similar to Monday ' s . A key question facing highway officials was why some of the crippled roadways , such_as the Santa Monica and Golden State freeways were considered a relatively low priority , since they failed under far less force than might have been expected if the Big One had struck . Recalling the collapse of Oakland ' s Nimitz Freeway in 1989 , Feinstein noted that highway officials are still learning about the inexact science of determining how roadways will respond to shaking and bending in an earthquake . &quot; We need to really upgrade our state-of-the-art preparedness and construction in earthquake zones , particularly freeway construction , &quot; she said . &quot; that ' s where you have the largest loss of life. &quot; Monday ' s quake caused no fatalities on the Santa Monica Freeway , the nation ' s busiest . But three different overpasses on the route partially buckled , causing enormous concrete slabs to move and crumble . Observers described its undulations as a horrific pre-dawn spectacle . &quot; When I came outside , the freeway was dancing up and down , &quot; said Lacy Loeb , who lives a block from the freeway . &quot; The whole structure mushroomed one second and then dropped the next. &quot; Overpasses at Fairfax Avenue and at Venice and La Cienega boulevards suffered severe damage . At Fairfax , the freeway shifted so that a four-foot wall of concrete rose_up in the middle of the traffic_lanes . At Venice , the support structures underneath the freeway were crushed by the falling concrete , exposing twisted steel supports . Caltrans workers at the scene estimated that the overpasses would have to be torn_down and rebuilt . In a 1982 assessment by the state Division of Mines and Geology , the ground near the point of the collapse was identified as being prone to liquefaction -- the breakdown of water-saturated soil when subjected_to shaking . But that section of the Santa Monica Freeway was given a lower priority for retrofitting than other projects because the freeway overpasses already had multiple support_columns , said Caltech professor Wilfred Iwan , head of the California Seismic Safety Commission . The damaged stretch of the freeway happened to be one of the next in_line for being shored_up , according to Jim Roberts , chief of Caltrans ' retrofitting program . The $ 3.7-million job was to have gone_to bid next month , and was scheduled to take about a year , he said . Steel jackets that would have been installed around the concrete supports most likely would have prevented the collapse , Roberts said . &quot; From the pictures , it looks_like the columns just shattered , &quot; he said . Transportation officials said some ramps adjacent to the collapsed roadway withstood the quake because they already had been retrofitted . Near Santa Clarita , where the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways merge in a towering concrete maze , cars were scattered Monday at two places where the road abruptly ended . One big-rig truck had jackknifed just before a precipice that was formed when the quake split the road in two . The huge highways were scarred with cracks , and chunks of concrete from upper levels of the interchange had collapsed and crashed to the roads below . That freeway junction was also scheduled for retrofitting , but the work had not yet been done , Caltrans officials said . &quot; We didn ' t consider ( the overpasses ) quite this vulnerable , &quot; Roberts said . &quot; We thought we had time. &quot; Caltrans officials acknowledged that they erred in a decision not to retrofit bridges along the Simi Valley Freeway ( California 118 ) in the San Fernando Valley . Those bridges also collapsed . An evaluation of the bridges , constructed five years after the 1971 Sylmar temblor , convinced engineers that they were strong enough to withstand a severe quake , officials said . Monday ' s quake was apparently centered_on an unmapped fault in the San Fernando Valley , said Roberts , who said the discovery will add_to the work of highway_engineers . &quot; Now we ' ll have to re-evaluate a whole_lot of bridges close to this new fault , &quot; he said . &quot; That means we have to go_back and rescreen several hundred bridges that are within a certain distance of this new fault line. &quot; In addition to that work , Caltrans engineers will be examining all freeway bridges and overpasses within a 50-mile radius of the quake ' s epicenter for any sign of damage , officials said . An investigative team of engineers and seismic experts will conduct a detailed analysis to determine what happened to each of the damaged bridges . Retrofitting has been the state ' s way of bolstering existing freeways -- especially those built before the 1971 Sylmar quake -- to withstand the sharp movements of California ' s fragmented crust . The program took_on increased urgency after the Whittier Narrows quake in October , 1987 . That magnitude 5.9 temblor threatened to bring_down a major interchange connecting the San Gabriel River Freeway and the Santa Ana Freeway between Santa Fe Springs and Downey . Subsequently , Caltrans began accelerating its efforts to reinforce freeway bridges , but the task is daunting . There are about 12 # 000 freeway bridges in the state , and engineers had to evaluate the soundness of those bridges before establishing a priority list . The 1989 Loma Prieta quake near Santa Cruz gave further impetus to the program because of the 43 lives lost in the collapses of the double-decked Nimitz Freeway in Oakland and a portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge . Since then , two-thirds of the retrofitting work has been done_in the Los Angeles Basin . &quot; I always felt that the next one would come_in L.A. , &quot; Roberts said . Before Monday ' s quake , most major interchanges in the Los Angeles area had been reinforced or were in the process of being retrofitted , Caltrans officials said . Often , that bolstering involves wrapping the concrete columns that support freeway bridges with steel jackets . Or in some cases , the base of the columns and the edge of longer bridge spans are enlarged to provide additional support . Roberts cited the critical interchange of the San Diego and Santa Monica freeways as one that may have been spared by retrofitting from serious damage or collapse . &quot; This earthquake shows that what we ' ve been doing_works , &quot; he said . Iwan of Caltech said , &quot; There ' s always a question ( whether ) we could do things faster . Basically , if we had more money we could progress at a lot faster pace , but there are a lot of things that compete for the same dollars . We have social problems and a lot of other problems that society wants taken_care of. &quot; George W . Housner , a worldwide authority on earthquake engineering , said he suspected that every building , road or bridge that failed Monday either was not constructed in accordance with seismic codes or had not been retrofitted after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake . &quot; My guess is that when all_the information comes_in , we ' ll say , ' Yes , they should have come_down , ' &quot; said Housner , who chaired a state panel that investigated and made recommendations following the Northern California quake .</TEXT>
