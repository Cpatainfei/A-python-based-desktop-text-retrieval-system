   <HEADLINE> U.S. AID TO RUSSIA FARMERS FAILS TO MAKE IT TO THE SILO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Viktor S . Kuzmin , one of Russia ' s pioneering private farmers , had a brave new idea : Break the state grain monopoly . American officials approved , and in September , Kuzmin and 12 other farmers in the southern Russian region of Saratov were given a no-interest loan to build grain storage and milling facilities that would allow them to market their own products . But what happened next bears_out some U.S. policy-makers ' suspicions about the fate of American aid to Russia : The Russian bureaucracy -- and its new commercial partners -- keeps most of the aid from reaching the new private sector it is meant to nourish . &quot; We got snookered , &quot; said Brian M . Foster , an Iowa dairy_farmer who heads the Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance ( VOCA ) agricultural program in Russia . &quot; that ' s the bottom line. &quot; Bureaucratic and banking delays at the Russian Humanitarian Commission , which administers foreign_aid , kept Kuzmin from receiving his money for five months , while inflation shrunk its ruble value from the equivalent of $ 336 # 000 in September to $ 219 # 000 . The Humanitarian Commission instructed Kuzmin to open an account at Megapolis Bank , a private commercial_bank with branches in Moscow and Saratov . He said Megapolis also required him to close his accounts at another Saratov bank and transfer the money to Megapolis . Finally , Kuzmin said , the Megapolis branch in Saratov told him that before he could draw_on the money , he would have to purchase -- through Megapolis -- insurance for the equipment he intended to buy with the American loan . The insurance_premium would cost more_than 10 % of the loan , Kuzmin said . &quot; This is corruption ! &quot; Kuzmin said . &quot; This is blackmail ! &quot; fumed Foster , whose agency supported Kuzmin ' s project . Anatoly I . Shvedov , chairman of the Megapolis board of directors in Moscow , denied any wrongdoing . The Humanitarian Commission imposed conditions on the loan to prevent misuse of the money , he said . But Shvedov had not heard of the 10 % demand . &quot; What insurance ? &quot; Shvedov asked . &quot; Why 10 % ? If there are any complaints about our bank in this respect we will sort it out. &quot; The United States spent about $ 1 billion on agricultural aid to Russia in 1993 . A team from the U.S. Inspector_General ' s Office is expected to arrive in Moscow today for a six-week audit of where the food and the money went . The audit follows allegations of profiteering on U.S. agricultural aid by the Russian bureaucracy . The complaints began reaching Washington as early as last spring , even as American farm commodities were still being loaded onto ships bound for Russia . Of the $ 1 billion in aid , about $ 700 million was used to buy U.S. commodities and about $ 300 million was spent to ship them to Russia . As the food arrives in Russia , the Humanitarian Commission sells it at auction and gives part of the proceeds to the Russian treasury . The commission is supposed to give the rest of the money in grants to social_services , health_care and agricultural projects , such_as Kuzmin ' s , that are meant to develop private farming and food processing . The money for such grants should total an estimated $ 29.5 million once money from auctions held_in December arrives , said the commission ' s executive_director , Georgy K . Maltsyn . But since the first auction in August , the Humanitarian Commission has distributed $ 8.5 million , its records show . Of this , $ 882 # 000 has been spent on agricultural projects . Neither U.S. nor Russian officials could specify how much of the proceeds from the original $ 700 million in commodities was supposed to go_to the treasury , how much was to be distributed by the Humanitarian Commission and why the share given to grants appears to be so small . &quot; Who knows where it all went ? &quot; Foster asked . &quot; But it did not support the development of market structures. &quot; U.S. Congress members have also questioned the program . &quot; I believe the current Russian Humanitarian Commission is another public relations disaster waiting to happen , &quot; wrote Timothy J . Penny ( D-Minn. ) , chairman of the House subcommittee on foreign agriculture and hunger , in September . &quot; If the U.S._government does not diligently monitor the distribution of commodities and funds , it will be impossible to maintain congressional support for additional assistance. &quot; The Saratov story is not encouraging . It suggests that the very Establishment that Kuzmin is trying to circumvent -- the state grain monopoly , Roskhlebprodukt , and its allies -- is working closely with the Russian agencies assigned to administer the American aid . Kathy Farley , a VOCA staffer who attended a number of the auctions in Saratov , said the sales were poorly advertised and most of the bidders were regional branches of Roskhlebprodukt . Russia does have a handful of private grain traders , but they were apparently not invited to some of the auctions . The commodities sold at rock-bottom prices . &quot; There was definitely collusion , &quot; Farley charged . At a poultry auction in December , Farley said , only three buyers showed_up . The chicken sold for one-third the Russian market_price , she said . U.S. officials knew the commodities would not be sold at world prices , but why were they sold at below Russian market rates ? Needy Russians did not benefit -- the agencies that serve them receive some of the auctions ' proceeds , so lower profits reduce their share . Saratov ' s 13 # 129 private farmers didn ' t benefit either , as the cheap sales only depressed prices for their products . So who benefited ? The same commercial companies with ties to the Humanitarian Commission appear to have made money from the sale of the American commodities and from the distribution of the proceeds . According to Farley , the Humanitarian Commission had an agent in Saratov that arranged the grain auctions . The company , Povolzhye-S , received a 5 % commission , she said . Povolzhye-S is also a shareholder of Megapolis Bank . Povolzhye-S &quot; is a firm we have been in cooperation with from the beginning , &quot; Megapolis Chairman Shvedov said . He said distribution of Kuzmin ' s money has been delayed because the farmer has been unwilling to comply with terms aimed at preventing misuse of the funds . In an interview , the commission ' s Maltsyn called the farmer &quot; a criminal &quot; and a manipulator who hoped to use the American loan as collateral for bigger financial schemes . Asked to explain the accusation , Maltsyn said the farmer had put a non-functional telephone_number and a wrong address on his grant application . Kuzmin said he moved his offices , and getting a phone took some time . Both Maltsyn and Shvedov remarked bitterly in interviews that Kuzmin had complained about them to his American patrons . Business in Moscow -- even the aid business -- is dangerous these days . Maltsyn ' s well-tailored Italian-style suit hides the gun he wears to work each day , and an aide strolled the Humanitarian Commission office with a holstered gun strapped over a sweat shirt . Maltsyn explained that part of his job is to certify humanitarian aid shipments arriving_at Russian customs . He told of an incident in which he suffered &quot; a certain unpleasantness &quot; after he refused to certify as humanitarian aid a shipment that clearly wasn ' t . For similar reasons , Kuzmin wanted to pick_up his aid grant from a Moscow bank instead of getting_it in small-town Saratov . Bank_accounts are not very secret in Russia , and Kuzmin feared that when a big deposit arrived in Saratov , local extortionists might come calling . As of last week , Kuzmin said he had access to only a quarter of the money approved for his project via the Megapolis branch in Saratov . The rest will be doled_out as Kuzmin shows that he is spending it for the grain-storage equipment and materials approved in his grant application , Shvedov said . The farmer will not receive interest on the money -- though he could have earned a 170 % annual interest_rate during the five months since his grant was approved . Instead , while his money sits waiting to be spent , it will continue to depreciate by the rate_of_inflation , which hit 900 % last year . However , Kuzmin ' s money probably isn ' t sitting idle . Russian commercial_banks are lending money at 200 % per year and more . The longer it takes Kuzmin to get his money , the more his bankers earn -- and it is the bankers who will judge whether Kuzmin is using his loan appropriately . &quot; What kills me is the interest on the money , &quot; Farley said . &quot; You have no evidence , but it ' s obvious to anyone who has lived here that they ' re lending the money out_in between at commercial rates. &quot; Kuzmin worries that if the delays continue , he will have to scale_down the size of the grain storage facility planned by the 13-farmer Golden Grain cooperative . In Soviet days , the state collected all_the grain at harvest_time and shipped it off to huge central storage facilities . Now collective_farms are being privatized , but they are still forced to sell to Roskhlebprodukt at artificially low prices . If not , their grain will rot before they find a buyer . Kuzmin argues that if reform is to succeed in Russia , it must begin with a free market for affordable food . Kuzmin sees little progress : &quot; Nothing is happening . Reforms are still being obstructed. &quot; Sergei Loiko in The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
