   <HEADLINE> ONCE IS DEFINITELY NOT ENOUGH ; N . KOREA ' S OK ON A SINGLE NUCLEAR INSPECTION IS WELCOME BUT INADEQUATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With its abrupt agreement to open seven of its nuclear sites to international inspection North_Korea has forestalled a looming crisis , while leaving unresolved the basic international security problems posed by its secret effort to acquire nuclear_weapons . After delaying for a year in meeting its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty , the Pyongyang regime , facing probable U.N. Security Council-ordered economic sanctions within a_few weeks , has taken a minimum step to satisfy the International Atomic Energy Agency . But apparently IAEA inspectors will be granted only one visit . Moreover , and fundamentally , they won ' t be able to see two suspected dumps where wastes from weapons-grade plutonium may be stored . Examination of those sites could reveal the extent of Pyongyang ' s weapons program . U.S. officials believe that the north may already have material for one or two nuclear devices . Recent remarks by Defense_Secretary William J . Perry and Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher suggest that Washington ' s aim now is not to force North_Korea to give_up that material but only to prevent it from acquiring more . One or two crude devices may_not a nuclear_power make , but one or two such devices , flaunted or not , can give implicit heft to a program of political blackmail against neighboring countries , South_Korea especially . The threat of sanctions was the stick used to force North_Korea to live_up_to the Non-proliferation Treaty ' s inspection requirements . The carrot was a U.S. offer to upgrade political and economic relations with Kim Il Sung ' s tottering Stalinist regime , in exchange for Pyongyang ' s agreement to end its nuclear program . Verification , by inspections , must be a part of this agreement . Is North_Korea , diplomatically isolated and with its economy stagnating under four years of negative growth , finally ready for such a deal ? Given its track record , the odds have to be seen as less than even . Pyongyang has acted to avoid international censure . But it still has to show that it ' s ready for international respectability .</TEXT>
