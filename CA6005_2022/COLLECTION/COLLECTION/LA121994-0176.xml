   <HEADLINE> CARTER BRINGS PEACE MISSION TO BOSNIAN CAPITAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former President Jimmy_Carter arrived in this besieged capital Sunday on a controversial peace mission being conducted against a backdrop of skepticism and distrust -- but also faint hope . A U.N. jet carrying Carter landed amid tight security at the bombed-out airport as the afternoon sun slipped behind the rugged mountains ringing Sarajevo , where 10 # 000 people have been killed in the 32-month civil_war . &quot; I have a limited role , &quot; Carter said on a tarmac lined with sandbag fortifications . &quot; What I would like to do , obviously , is to understand the situation and contribute to the alleviation of tension. &quot; Sarajevo ' s shattered residents harbor hope that the latest in a string of frustrated peace missions might bring an end to the most horrific European war in half a century . More_than 250 # 000 people have died or are missing in the war , which began when Bosnian Serb separatists rebelled against Bosnia-Herzegovina ' s 1992 secession from the former Yugoslav federation . But the capital showed few signs of the tranquillity and relative normalcy promised by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic when he invited the former President last week . It was only the second day in nearly a month that the rebels had granted security guarantees for U.N. aircraft to land . Shortly before Carter reached Sarajevo , an explosive believed to be a rocket-propelled grenade pounded the Holiday Inn , home to many journalists and official visitors , destroying three unoccupied rooms . On the city ' s streets , sniper fire injured a 73-year-old woman , while an exploding rifle_grenade wounded a French U.N. peacekeeper and a woman . Throughout the evening , the clatter of gunfire and the pounding of explosives served as constant reminders that Karadzic ' s pledge of a cease-fire in the area had not been honored . U.N. Protection Force officials also reported that convoys of food and fuel were blocked by Bosnian Serbs , in violation of another Karadzic promise , while access to the airport continued to be restricted . &quot; A lot of the same problems remain , &quot; one U.N. official said . Carter , who had said he would not become involved in the peace process unless Karadzic honored his pledges , was apprised of the Bosnian Serb actions in meetings in Zagreb , Croatia , and Sarajevo on Sunday . But he decided to go_forward with his mission anyway . &quot; I think that I have received enough assurance to go_to Pale , &quot; said Carter , referring to the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb capital near Sarajevo where he is scheduled to meet Karadzic and other Bosnian Serb leaders this morning . After arriving here Sunday , Carter held talks with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic . In a brief news_conference following the meeting , Carter said he supports the so-called Contact Group peace plan , which would divide Bosnia roughly in half between the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led Bosnian government . Critics of Carter ' s peace effort say Karadzic hopes to manipulate the mission to undo the Contact Group plan , which has been accepted by all parties except the Bosnian Serbs . The Bosnian government and the five-nation Contact Group , including the United States , have insisted that any mediation effort by Carter start only after Karadzic agrees to the existing plan . Carter , however , would not directly answer questions about whether the plan itself might be negotiable , saying only that &quot; there is no other basis for future negotiations &quot; and that &quot; whatever is done within the Contact Group plan must be mutually decided &quot; by the Bosnian government and the Bosnian Serbs . Izetbegovic was less equivocating . He ruled_out any changes to the plan and said Carter had assured him that the mission is aimed at securing Karadzic ' s acceptance of an unaltered document , which would require the Bosnian Serbs to give_up about one-third of the territory they now control . Karadzic turned_down the plan in the summer , a decision that was endorsed by a Bosnian Serb referendum . But the Bosnian president said Carter indicated &quot; that there is a readiness &quot; on Karadzic ' s part to accept the plan , although Carter would not comment on this issue . &quot; I have very clearly pointed out that . . . the plan of the Contact Group would be the starting_point for further negotiations , and Mr. Carter has very clearly confirmed that and said if he were in our shoes he would ask the same , &quot; Izetbegovic said . Carter appeared to be keeping his options open . &quot; I told the president ( Izetbegovic ) that I will come_back here to report to him and that I hope my visit will be fruitful , &quot; he said . &quot; It is too early for me to give any definitive answers. &quot; Carter began his current trip in Frankfurt , Germany , where he met with U.N. and U.S. officials before flying to Zagreb . In the Croatian capital , he held talks with Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic , Croatian President Franjo Tudjman , U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi and Peter Galbraith , the U.S. ambassador to Croatia . Following their meeting , Akashi expressed confidence in Carter ' s effort , saying that the former President &quot; is too intelligent to be manipulated by anybody. &quot; Silajdzic expressed fears that the Bosnian Serbs will use Carter ' s visit to divert attention from heavy fighting in northwest Bosnia , where Bosnian Serbs are trying to overrun the U.N.-declared &quot; safe area &quot; of Bihac . In Sarajevo , Izetbegovic echoed the concerns . &quot; Since we have been speaking about the visit of Mr. Carter , the fighting in Bihac has intensified , &quot; Izetbegovic said . &quot; So we are fearing that this might just be a curtain ( so ) that this job in the Bihac region ( can ) be completed militarily. &quot; In Pale , a Bosnian Serb spokesman said Karadzic had no sinister motives in calling_for Carter ' s participation in the peace process and that the Bosnian Serb leader hoped only to &quot; break the deadlock in the peace process. &quot; U.N. officials said Carter would spend Sunday night at the U.N. residence of Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the U.N. commander for Bosnia , who was in Italy for military meetings . Carter , joined by his wife , Rosalynn , and two aides , will tour Sarajevo this morning before traveling_to Pale , the officials said .</TEXT>
