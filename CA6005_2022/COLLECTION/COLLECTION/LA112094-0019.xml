   <TEXT> OFF THE ROAD : A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim ' s Route Into Spain by Jack Hitt ( Simon &amp; Schuster ; $ 22 ; 255 pp. ) Pilgrim . There ' s a hum to it , a mantra , a must . &quot; The more I tried on this awkward word , the more I liked its ill fit , &quot; writes Jack Hitt . Whatever possessed Hitt -- Viking-sized , 35 , American Episcopalian -- to toss up a comfortable life and trek across northern Spain , Basque country , to westernmost Santiago de Compostela , the reader is the richer . Whether or not the apostle James is buried there ( the ancient story owes its origins to a typo ) , Dante himself proclaimed the journey the One True Pilgrimage : There is no earthly reason to go_to Santiago , but to go . Hitt went , and recounts his hajj in luminous prose . At times Chaucerian in tone and scope , at times reflective , even magical , Hitt ' s chronicle resounds with wit , wonder and curiosity satisfied . Side trips of speculation lead to a consideration of stylites and dendrites and Benedictines , Crusaders ( &quot; vulgar mercenaries &quot; ) and Knights_Templar ( &quot; a splendid drama of political jostling , gems , gold , forts , popes , kings and divine mysteries &quot; ) , of the Song of Roland , the ecclesiastical origin of Friday the 13th , religious relics ( a dispute over two heads of John_the_Baptist was resolved when it was declared that one was the head of John as a youth , the other as an adult ) . Closer to earth are Canterbury tales of wacky fellow_travelers , of &quot; rugged , ugly plains &quot; and the &quot; primal soup &quot; of lanes well traveled_by cows , of minor miracles and a village , where pilgrims used to wash in the river , called Lavacola ( wash tail ) . And finally , the revelation that &quot; the road takes_up residence within us and becomes a way to something else. &quot;</TEXT>
