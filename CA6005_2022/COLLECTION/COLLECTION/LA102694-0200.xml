   <HEADLINE> DEMOCRATS SPOT RAYS OF ELECTORAL HOPE ; CAMPAIGNS : RECENT ECONOMIC , FOREIGN_POLICY GAINS BY CLINTON BRIGHTEN A DISMAL ELECTION OUTLOOK . BUT THE PARTY ' S NEGATIVES REMAIN FORMIDABLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Suddenly , Democrats can see a_few glimmers of hope on the otherwise bleak horizon of the 1994 midterm elections . For perhaps the first time , the Clinton presidency -- which until now has been one of the governing party ' s biggest burdens -- is providing at least the opportunity for Democrats to gain political ground . These are some of the developments : * On the economic front , comprising the bundle of issues which more_than any other helped Bill_Clinton defeat George_Bush , the President this week was able to announce favorable news about deficit reduction while a new poll showed that an increasing number of Americans believe the nation ' s economy is_on the upswing . * In foreign affairs , which until recently had been regarded_as Clinton ' s weakest suit , Clinton ' s success in dealing with crises in the Persian_Gulf and Haiti has already boosted his stock in the polls . More political rewards are anticipated from this week ' s trip to the Middle_East , where the President is to witness the signing of the peace agreement between Israel and Jordan . * The stunning decision by New York City Republican Mayor Rudolph W . Giuliani to endorse hard-pressed New York Democratic Gov . Mario M . Cuomo in his bid for reelection transforms into an asset what had been another political handicap -- the party ' s longtime commitment to the nation ' s cities . That is true not only in Cuomo ' s own campaign against Republican George E . Pataki , but also , according to Democrats , in other states trying to contend with the problems of huge urban_centers . Assuming the role of chief Administration political spokesman while Clinton is overseas , Vice_President Al Gore sought Tuesday to make the most of the improved political environment . In a luncheon speech to the Center for National Policy , a Democratic think_tank , he noted that the previous conventional wisdom that Clinton is &quot; somehow wanting &quot; in foreign affairs is no longer operative . And Gore cited the President ' s trip to the Middle_East at the invitation of Israel and Jordan as evidence that &quot; America is_on the rise again . America is strong again . America is respected again. &quot; After reviewing Clinton ' s accomplishments on the economic front , which he said had been made despite intense partisan opposition from the GOP in Congress , Gore declared : &quot; I believe the tide is turning -- that in these next two weeks voters will increasingly decide to reject those who put party first. &quot; But most independent analysts viewed that judgment as premature , contending that it would take far more to reverse the fundamental negative factors working against the Democrats -- the traditional tendency of the party in power to lose ground in off-year elections , the greater number of House and Senate seats and governorships that Democrats have at stake compared to the opposition party and the continuing relatively low approval rating for the President -- despite a recent upswing . &quot; Clinton has had a_couple_of good weeks and that ' s better than for him to have two weeks of utter disasters , &quot; said Merle Black , a political analyst at Emory University in Atlanta . But Black said that he doubts Democratic candidates will change their strategy , which for the most part involves keeping their distance from the President and stressing local concerns and their own individual records . Nor does he expect recent developments to cause Republican candidates to relent in their attacks on Clinton ' s performance . &quot; They are still going_to tell voters he is a liberal , that he wants to expand government , that he ' s going_to make you pay too_much for stuff you didn ' t want in the first place , &quot; Black said . Still , Black conceded that in states where Clinton ran strongly in 1992 , the progress on the economic front and the success abroad could be used as talking points by Democratic candidates . &quot; And at the least , it will make the President less of a drag &quot; for his party ' s candidates , Black said . As for Republicans , they wasted little time in trying to minimize Clinton ' s accomplishments and pressed their latest attack -- focusing_on a recently disclosed memorandum by Alice Rivlin , director of the White_House Office of Management and Budget . The document discusses possible cuts_in entitlement benefits and increases in taxes to help cut the budget_deficit . Noting that the White_House had ruled_out most of the entitlement cuts mentioned in the memo , GOP strategist William Kristol , in a memorandum distributed to party leaders , said : &quot; What is striking is the failure of the President to rule_out any of the tax increases. &quot; &quot; This Administration has already raised taxes once , &quot; Kristol said . &quot; Our suspicions that they would like to do so again are confirmed by the Rivlin memo. &quot; But for the moment , Democrats preferred to accentuate other , positive news from the White_House . Robert Healy , a Washington lobbyist and fund-raiser for Democratic congressional candidates , cited a new Washington Post-ABC News poll which showed approval of Clinton ' s job performance climbing to 49 % with 48 % disapproving , compared to 44 % approval and 51 % disapproval last month . &quot; This has to be a boost for Democratic candidates if only because the last two or three months have been so damn dismal , &quot; he said . &quot; So when you get a boost , it takes_on an extra dimension. &quot; * RELATED STORY : A35</TEXT>
