   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; SPOTLIGHT ON THE PHILIPPINES ; THE PHILIPPINE ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although still recovering from the political instability of the 1980s and hurt more recently by natural disasters and the closing of U.S. military bases , the country has seen investment and growth increase slowly . The primary limit on the economy is a lack of adequate electricity . After infrastructure improvements , sustained growth is more likely in the next few years . Strong natural and human resources give the nation a head_start . Resources : Coal and hydroelectricity have reduced the nation ' s dependence on imported oil from 95 % of energy supply in 1979 to 60 % in 1990 . Fishing , which accounts_for 5 % of exports , has boomed with sales of shrimp to Japan . Extensive cutting has depleted forests , but mining remains important , with gold , silver , copper , nickel , iron , lead and chromium in rich deposits . The Philippines is the world ' s eighth-largest gold producer . Power : The shortage of power-generating capacity is estimated to have cost the economy about $ 1.3 billion in lost output in 1993 . It also has secondary effects on employment and consumer spending . Because of the long brownouts in the Manila area , many firms have reduced work hours and unemployment has reached 25 % . But new power_plants are starting to come_on line . Exports : The Philippines is the world ' s leading exporter of coconut products , but their relative importance has declined and now they make_up about 10 % of exports . Increasingly important now are electronics ( 19 % of exports in 1990 ) and textiles ( 16 % ) . Bananas and handicrafts have also become growth_industries . Overall , agriculture provides about a third of export revenue and employs about 40 % of the labor_force . Potential : An English-speaking labor_force , extensive natural_resources and a large domestic market put the Philippines in a strong position as it faces competition from China , Vietnam and Indonesia . Top priority now is to address structural defects that have held the nation back , such_as insufficient revenue , large corporate monopolies and unequal distribution of wealth . Working Abroad : Despite the international recession , the number of Filipinos working abroad , especially in Asia and the Middle_East , has steadily increased . Without the $ 2.2 billion in remittances from these workers in 1992 , the GNP would not have grown . Sources : Bank of America , Europa Publications , CIA and ABC-Clio</TEXT>
