   <HEADLINE> PIT BULLS IN DRUG DEALERS ' FIERCE CANINE CORPS ; CRIME : FEROCIOUS DOGS ARE BEING USED IN HIGH- STAKES AND ILLEGAL DOGFIGHTS AT THE SAME TIME AS THEY SERVE AS THE WEAPONS OF CHOICE , ' FOUR-LEGGED GUNS. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sherry DeGenova cringes each time she sees a snarling pit bull being paraded down the street , a common sight in inner_cities across the country . &quot; It ' s terrible what ' s being done to these dogs , &quot; said DeGenova , kennel manager at the Hartford Animal Control Shelter . More and more , she said , the dogs are being used against other pit bulls in illegal , high-stakes dogfights . Then , when they have been defeated and maimed , the injured animals are abandoned and left to roam the streets . Warring drug dealers also train the dogs to be killers and then use them as &quot; four-legged guns. &quot; &quot; We ' re seeing a disturbing new trend , a nationwide trend . Members of street gangs are using pit bulls as status symbols and as weapons , &quot; said Rachel Lamb , a spokeswoman for the Humane Society of the U.S. , based in Washington , D.C. &quot; It ' s a huge problem in Washington. &quot; In the nation ' s capital , the Humane Society ' s dog_pound destroys as_many as 10 to 15 pit bulls each month , said Rosemary Vozobule , director of humane law_enforcement . &quot; These are dogs we ' ve found running_down the street or left abandoned in boarded-up houses , &quot; she said . &quot; In some areas of the city there are dogfights every single night. &quot; In Hartford , the dog_pound recently had to destroy six pit bulls confiscated at an impromptu dogfight in the inner_city . &quot; In the cases of many of these dogs , it ' s doing them a favor to put them to sleep , considering how they ' ve been treated during their lives , &quot; DeGenova said . Illegal &quot; back-yard breeders &quot; beat their dogs and bind their legs to make them more vicious , she said . They wrap heavy chains around the puppies to build_up their chests , and sometimes even pen their pit bulls with smaller dogs and encourage the_pit bulls to tear_apart the weaker dogs . Dog wardens say most of the abandoned pit bulls are either too maimed or too vicious to be eligible for adoption . In Bridgeport , Connecticut ' s largest city , the situation is totally out of control , said Ralph Corson , the city ' s chief animal control officer . &quot; We have pit bulls in our shelters that are absolutely wild , &quot; Corson said . &quot; Pit bulls are the dog of choice among the gangs now . They use them like four-legged guns , &quot; he said , adding that the gangs have begun breaking_into the pound and stealing pit bulls that have been picked_up on the streets . In one recent month , eight pit bulls were stolen from the Bridgeport animal shelter and from other shelters around the state , said Richard Johnson , president of the Connecticut Humane Society . Johnson said some of the dogs were used as bait to help train other pit bulls for high-stakes fights that are held_in housing project courtyards and back_streets . &quot; We are talking_about thousands of dollars that can change hands in one of these contests , &quot; he said . &quot; That would certainly convince someone to break_into a shelter and steal a dog. &quot; The problem is not confined to the East Coast . In California , macho dope dealers frequently use pit bulls for protection and prestige , said Glenn Howell , animal control director for the city of Oakland . &quot; There ' s a lot of pit-bull fighting in East Oakland , and last year a police_officer was shot to death when he tried to confiscate a dog that had bitten someone , &quot; he said . Hartford canine control officer Jerry Cloutier , who recently arrested two teen-agers after coming_upon a dogfight , said staged dogfights have become a popular form of entertainment among drug dealers and gang members . He said a pit bull can be one of several types of fighting dogs , including the American Staffordshire terrier and the bull_terrier . The dogs , which have massive chests , large heads and powerful jaws , are extremely combative and often will fight to the death . Pit bulls have been banned in Miami , Fla. , where it has been a crime to own one for the past five years . But the Humane Society of the United States said the problem isn ' t so_much the dogs themselves as the irresponsible breeders and owners who encourage them to become vicious and train them to kill other animals . Rachel Lamb said the Humane Society has worked for years to wipe_out organized dog fighting , which is illegal throughout the country and a felony in most states . &quot; We ' ve had a great_deal of success against organized dog fighting , which usually occurs in the South , &quot; Lamb said . &quot; In some Southern states there are dog-fighting clubs that actually put_out newsletters. &quot; &quot; But , &quot; she added , &quot; it ' s almost impossible to get a handle on these impromptu dogfights that are proliferating among the urban gangs ; it ' s very frustrating. &quot; In Coventry , a small_town east of Hartford , abandoned pit bulls have found a friend in Sharon Veci . She has taken it upon herself to try to find homes for some of the abandoned dogs . &quot; Most of these dogs , when they ' re finally rescued , have to be put_down , &quot; Veci said . &quot; They ' ll attack any dog they get close to , and you just can ' t trust them . But if you get them young enough , or if they haven ' t been mistreated and taught to fight , they can make wonderful , gentle pets . They ' re incredibly loyal. &quot; Veci became an advocate for the breed after adopting two pit bulls from the Hartford pound several years ago . She named them Rita and Ely . &quot; I tell potential adopters that while they ' re great family dogs they ' re also independent , sort of like big_cats , &quot; she said . &quot; And they ' re not fantastic with strangers . My husband and I haven ' t done a lot of entertaining since Rita and Ely came_to live with us. &quot;</TEXT>
