   <HEADLINE> PARTNERS FOR LIFE ; GAYS IN O.C. ARE INCREASINGLY CONFIRMING THEIR UNIONS BEFORE FAMILY AND FRIENDS . BUT CLERGY REMAINS SPLIT ON THE CEREMONIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Preparations for the beach wedding had already begun when Kay Wiker and Daniel Holmes got the bad news from the County of Orange : Weddings aren ' t permitted on county beaches . Wiker , 33 , had known what elements he wanted at his wedding even before he fully realized , at the age of 18 , that he is gay . He wanted a ceremony on the sand , and under a full_moon . His fiance , Holmes , 27 , was determined that the orchid-covered bamboo wedding arch , illuminated by 100 tiki torches and candles held by each of the 150 guests , would be part of the ceremony at Laguna ' s West Street beach . Then , in a twist that was both sweet and bitter to the participants , the county allowed the ceremony to go_on as planned . The event , it seems , would be just a party in the eyes of county officials , not a wedding , since the state doesn ' t recognize gay unions as legal marriages . So on June 4 , 1993 , Wiker and Holmes , in matching tailed tuxedos , exchanged rings while their seven attendants stood_by on the sand . Amid live cello and flute music , two ministers read prayers and watched as the San Juan Capistrano couple recited their vows . It was a ceremony that Wiker , aware of the apparent incongruity of the term , described as &quot; old-fashioned. &quot; &quot; It was what I ' ve always wanted to do . I wanted to show Daniel how much I ' m willing to make a commitment to him , and do_it in front of our friends , &quot; he said . &quot; My straight friends are impressed that we did_it so openly . But there shouldn ' t be anything unusual in it . When two gay people want to show their commitment , they should be able to do so. &quot; Lesbians and gays increasingly are choosing to announce and confirm their relationships before friends , families and co-workers . Variously called same-sex covenants , relationship rituals or holy unions , the declarations of commitment are_on the rise nationally , gay rights advocates say . The ceremonies , advocates say , reflect the sheer number of flourishing same-sex partnerships . They also underscore the burgeoning political presence of gays and are fueling litigation efforts to gain state recognition of same-sex unions . Because gay unions are not recognized as marriages by any state , they lack legal protections and privileges automatically granted to heterosexual couples . Although gay partners often have lawyers draft contracts and agreements that attempt to duplicate these benefits , it ' s estimated that such agreements can address only 60 % of what is covered in a heterosexual marriage . For example , the agreements cannot guarantee the same protections in areas such_as child-custody , pension_plans , health coverage and Social_Security benefits . While states do not recognize the unions , some cities have chosen to do so . Laguna Beach is one of five in California -- the others being West Hollywood , Berkeley , Santa Cruz and San Francisco -- that offer varying degrees of recognition of same-sex unions . On a separate front , some private companies are choosing to extend spousal benefits to partners of their gay and lesbian employees . Some gay commitment ceremonies announce the start of a relationship ; most affirm partnerships that began years or even decades earlier . The ceremonies can also be political statements , as when more_than 1 # 000 same-sex couples were simultaneously wed during last summer ' s March_on Washington . The majority , however , are private parties held_in homes , hotels and churches . At Congregation Kol Ami in West Hollywood , Rabbi Denise L . Eger has performed hundreds of commitment ceremonies since 1988 . She says the rituals , performed in the temple , homes or parks , often serve as a welcome vehicle for hesitant parents to show their support of their gay children ' s relationships . Because no official records are kept , the national total of gay unions is unknown . &quot; We ' re talking_about a community that does its best to remain hidden because of fear of losing jobs and getting their children taken_away , &quot; said one gay-rights activist . However , the American Bar Assn. ' s Family Law Conference has estimated that 10 million children are being raised in 3 million same-sex households nationwide . Nearly all states permit adoption for same-sex couples . The notion of gay unions remains discomforting to many people -- even to some who don ' t consider themselves anti-homosexual . The Los Angeles Diocese of the Episcopal Church , probably the most progressive mainline Christian denomination , debated at its recent convention whether the blessing of same-sex relationships should be sanctioned . After six hours of discussion , delegates failed to reach definitive agreement . &quot; The idea of two women or two men marrying is one that I don ' t see myself theologically able to endorse or accommodate , &quot; said the Rev . David Anderson of St . James ' Episcopal Church in Newport Beach , whose delegation opposed the same-sex resolution . &quot; The term marriage has referred to unique bond between a man and a woman , and the old medieval idea of marriage had to do with the production of children. &quot; Episcopal priests who had previously blessed same-sex covenants , such_as the Rev . George Regas at All Saints in Pasadena , continue to do so , and backers of the proposal say they will press the issue at the church ' s general convention this summer . Carl Tuttle , pastor of Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Anaheim , says he sees homosexuality as a sin but dislikes being lumped together with &quot; angry , hateful and militant &quot; opponents of gay rights . &quot; We don ' t condemn gays that way , &quot; Tuttle said . &quot; But I would n ' t have the faith to ( perform ) a gay marriage , because I do believe it ' s not within God ' s will . We see it as a sin , and they don ' t . We don ' t condone homosexuality for the same reason we don ' t condone drunkenness , theft or encourage divorce . I don ' t embrace their lifestyle or value system. &quot; But liberal clerics such_as Regas believe gays should have a welcome home_in the Christian_church . &quot; The love of God revealed in the Jewish and Christian Scriptures is an inclusive love . that ' s the predominant theme of biblical literature , &quot; Regas said . Most Christian commitment ceremonies for same-sex couples are performed by the Metropolitan Community Church , founded in 1968 for gays who feel uncomfortable in other churches . The church has more_than 300 congregations worldwide . The Rev . Jane Carl , co-pastor of Ocean of Life MCC in Costa Mesa , has performed about 50 same-sex ceremonies . Like heterosexual candidates for marriage , gay partners meet at least three times with Carl before the ceremony to discuss the emotional , spiritual and legal aspects of their union . Carl requires couples to have lived together for at least one year before the ceremony , and they must also attend her church at least three times if they don ' t go_to church elsewhere . &quot; If they want the support of this church , they need to know what it is that ' s supporting them , &quot; Carl said . &quot; If it ' s just God ' s support they want , they can do ( the ceremony ) under a tree , and God will recognize their vows no matter where they do them. &quot; The specter of AIDS , Carl says , has played a role in encouraging long-term gay unions , especially among men . &quot; Gay_men are becoming much more monogamous in the face of AIDS , &quot; she said . &quot; You see a lot of commitment to not fooling around. &quot; Of the ceremonies Carl has conducted , 70 % have been between women . At Congregation Kol Ami gay_men take vows just as often as lesbians , which is a change from the late 1980s , Rabbi Eger said . She attributes the change to a renewal of the values of commitment in the gay male community , prompted by the AIDS epidemic . Carl estimates that nationally , three of every five gay commitment ceremonies are non-religious . &quot; The reason , I think , is that the church has done so_much damage to gay and lesbian people spiritually that many are totally convinced that God will have no part of them . So they say , why do the ceremony in a church ? &quot; Chris and Micki Clark of Orange County are among the lesbian couples who chose to include Christian passages in their wedding . The two met through a gay dating service last March and held a commitment ceremony just two months later . &quot; It was love at first sight , &quot; said Chris , 31 , who is a state employee . &quot; We believe_in God , and I wanted to have my lifelong partner marry me because it ' s more of a commitment , more bonding . It ' s not only a religious but a social bond when you ' re out there in front of your friends and family. &quot; The wedding , performed by the Rev . Rosalind Russell of Laguna Beach , was held_in the recreation_room of the Clarks ' apartment complex and was followed by a party that lasted nearly eight hours . The guest list -- which grew from 20 to 42 as more friends and co-workers began to show interest in attending -- included &quot; gay , straight , old and young , &quot; said Micki , 27 , an administrative assistant for a rehabilitation firm . Micki ' s sister served as bridesmaid , Chris ' nephew was the ring-bearer , and Chris ' former brother-in-law gave_away the bride to Chris , who dressed in a tux and tails . Micki , who legally changed her last_name to match Chris ' , plans to have a baby through alternative insemination . The couple ' s parents , however , didn ' t attend the ceremony . Micki ' s parents , she said , &quot; would rather see us married to males , but that ' s their opinion . Gay people have the right to be married too . We ' re in love. &quot; Russell , who has performed 40 same-sex unions at various venues since 1991 , offers to intercede and speak_to parents who balk at their children ' s decision . &quot; Parents often support the couples , but not always , &quot; Russell said . &quot; Some parents live_out of state , so the ( children ) don ' t push ( for them to come ) . The couples that do have families involved have a much stronger basis for their marriage , as with any relationship. &quot; Of the gay couples who are wed at Kol Ami , about one-fifth have parents who boycott the ceremony on principle . Another 25 % of the parents , Eger says , are hesitant but find that the ceremony is a way to heal their relationship with their children . &quot; Say the parents are not dealing well with their child ' s sexual orientation , &quot; Eger says . &quot; Then they get a call from the child announcing the ceremony . The parents resist at first but know they have to do the right thing and show_up . And it has a positive effect . A wedding is a wedding . There ' s music and loving words said. &quot; Lawsuits challenging states ' policies of withholding marriage_licenses from gays have become a priority among gay-rights lawyers . In 1993 , the policy in California was unsuccessfully challenged by two West Hollywood men who sued after the Los Angeles county clerk denied their application for a marriage_license . In Hawaii , where the state ' s constitution specifically addresses the issue of discrimination based on sex , a pending suit may fare better , said J Craig Fong of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund , which has brought the suit . New Mexico and New Jersey may also soon be targeted for marriage_license suits because those states ' constitutions and case_laws show potential for being challenged , Fong said . While the courts are deciding whether the definitions of marriage should be expanded , some private companies have rewritten their policies to include more non-traditional couples . Some began by offering health and other benefits to the unmarried partners of heterosexual employees and then extended the benefit to the partners of gay and lesbian employees . When former Apple Computer Chairman John Sculley initiated a benefits program for domestic partners last year , his rationale was as American as apple_pie , said company spokesman Frank O ' Mahony . &quot; He was concerned that we could have a potential disadvantage recruiting the best talent if gay people knew they couldn ' t get adequate health benefits , &quot; O ' Mahony said . Sculley ' s competitive pragmatism , the spokesman added , was accompanied by a personal belief that denying benefits to committed gay couples is simply unfair . Other companies offering domestic partnership benefits include Levi Strauss , Ben &amp; Jerry ' s Ice_Cream and Stanford_University . Some film studios and recording companies are also reportedly considering the policy . Such benefits , however , may_not be as lucrative as they seem , according to the Partners Task_Force for Gay and Lesbian Couples , an advocacy group based in Seattle . The Internal Revenue Service calculates the dollar value of domestic partnership benefits , then adds that on to the working partner ' s income , according to the task_force . Gay-rights advocates say the very fact that gay unions are not state-recognized is proof that the ceremonies are reflections of love rather than arrangements of convenience . &quot; We ' re doing this in spite of the fact that there ' s no legal or economic benefit , &quot; said Eger , who has been wed nine years to her lesbian partner . &quot; Even though we ' re discriminated against by the state from building stable , normative lives , I have people who have been together 18 , 20 , 24 years . I find it ironic that the radical right wants to paint the gay community as promiscuous , evil-doing and predatory when the reality is gay and lesbian commitment ceremonies are really about celebrating gay and lesbian stability. &quot; Eger concedes , however , that divorces among gay partners occur nearly as frequently as they do_in heterosexual marriages . In such cases , she encourages her gay couples as well as her straight couples to undergo what she calls &quot; a sacred ceremony of dissolutionment. &quot; &quot; I do create ceremonies of closure and separation , &quot; Eger says . &quot; In ( prenuptial ) counseling we talk_of what happens when the relationship doesn ' t work. &quot; According to Daniel Holmes , who was wed on the moonlit beach , his relationship has become stronger since the ceremony . &quot; The ceremony strengthened it . We ' d both had previous long-term relationships , and in this one , there ' s not that thought that one of us could walk_out the door . This is the most settled and loving time I ' ve had in my life. &quot;</TEXT>
