   <HEADLINE> NEW CHARGES ON WHITEWATER TOLD IN HOUSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rep . Jim Leach of Iowa , President Clinton ' s leading Republican critic in the Whitewater controversy , charged Thursday that the Arkansas real_estate venture ultimately was used &quot; to skim , directly or indirectly , federally insured deposits &quot; from a Little_Rock savings and loan . Presenting what he called the findings of a months-long investigation by Republicans in Congress , Leach released more_than 100 pages of documents that he said prove Clinton and his associates guilty of benefiting financially and politically from Whitewater , stonewalling on the subsequent investigations and interfering with federal regulators . &quot; Whitewater may have begun as a legitimate real_estate venture , &quot; Leach said on the House floor , but eventually &quot; it came_to be used to skim , directly or indirectly , federally insured deposits &quot; from both Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan and Capital Management Services Inc. , a Small Business Administration-backed fund that made government-subsidized loans to what were supposed to be economically disadvantaged borrowers . The documents Leach released , many of them internal memoranda and notes written by federal regulators and investigators working for the Resolution Trust Corp. , provided no evidence directly linking Clinton or his wife to that scheme or other apparent wrong-doing . Included in the documents was a memorandum in which a senior federal investigator of the Whitewater controversy concluded that the real_estate investment shared by Clinton , First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and two friends cost the federally insured Little_Rock thrift more_than $ 100 # 000 . This is the first government estimate of the financial impact of Whitewater on Madison Guaranty , which eventually folded at a cost to taxpayers of more_than $ 47 million . The material Leach released provided new details about many aspects of the controversial case , including a conclusion by investigators that Clinton ' s Whitewater partners had used Madison and its subsidiary in a giant check-kiting scheme . This conclusion was contained in a memo written earlier this year by L . Jean Lewis , the senior criminal investigator in the Kansas City office of the RTC , who had been handling the RTC ' s investigation of Madison Guaranty . Madison , which the RTC shut_down in 1989 , was owned and operated by James B . McDougal , the Clintons ' partner in Whitewater Development Corp . Lewis said in the memo , which described a discussion she had with a senior attorney for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . last month , that she doubted any of McDougal ' s business partners could have been unaware they were benefiting from McDougal ' s use of Madison funds . &quot; If you know that your mortgages are being paid , but you aren ' t putting money into the venture , and you also know the venture isn ' t cash flowing , would n ' t you question the source of the funds being used to benefit . . ? &quot; Lewis asked . &quot; would n ' t you wonder even more if you knew that your business partner ' s main source of income , an S &amp; L , was in serious financial difficulty , which by 1985 was fairly common knowledge ? &quot; The Clintons have said that they invested about $ 70 # 000 of borrowed money in Whitewater and received no return on their investment , except for some interest payments on loans that were covered by Whitewater and McDougal . But McDougal has said that they never invested more_than about $ 13 # 000 in the deal . Lewis said in her memo that the FDIC lawyer , April Breslaw , who had come_to Kansas City to discuss Madison Guaranty , told her that &quot; people at the top &quot; of the government hoped the RTC would conclude that no money from the defunct savings and loan went_into Whitewater Development . To the contrary , Lewis ' notes said she told Breslaw , there was ample evidence that Whitewater received money from Madison as part of McDougal ' s larger check-kiting scheme . In just one six-month period examined by the RTC , she said , investigators found that $ 70 # 000 had been shifted from Madison to Whitewater . Judging from that evidence , she said , &quot; it was my belief that the losses to Madison from the Whitewater account alone would easily exceed $ 100 # 000. &quot; Included in the $ 70 # 000 of thrift funds that went_to Whitewater was a $ 30 # 000 check approved by the Madison board of directors as a bonus for McDougal . According to Lewis , the bonus money was immediately moved_into the Whitewater account at a time when it was overdrawn by $ 28 # 000 . Lewis said there was no doubt in her mind that Whitewater was an integral part of McDougal ' s complex financial scheme , and that Whitewater-related losses helped to bring the federally insured institution down . &quot; There is a clear-cut loss , &quot; she wrote , recalling her conversation with Breslaw . &quot; I also stated that any attempt to extract Whitewater as one entity from the rest of the McDougal-controlled entities involved in the alleged check kite will distort the entire picture . . . . &quot; I stated that if she wanted me to tell her , unequivocally , that Whitewater didn ' t cause a loss , I could not do that. &quot; Lewis indicated that her judgments were at the heart of the so-called &quot; criminal referral &quot; that the RTC forwarded to the Justice_Department last year , asking_for a criminal investigation of Madison and the related real_estate investment once partly owned by the President . The substance of that referral , which kindled the Whitewater controversy , had never previously been made public . But neither Lewis ' memo on her conversation with Breslaw nor the other documents released by Leach showed direct involvement in Madison ' s activities on the part of Clinton . The President has consistently maintained -- and did so again in his press_conference Thursday night -- that he had no knowledge of McDougal ' s Madison activities . Led by Leach , the ranking minority member of the House Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs Committee , House Republicans have been investigating Whitewater and Madison with the hope of making their findings known at a committee hearing on the RTC . But committee Chairman Henry B . Gonzalez ( D-Tex. ) abruptly canceled that hearing , which had been scheduled for Thursday morning , after Leach served notice that he planned to call a number of Whitewater-related witnesses . While Democratic leaders later agreed to negotiate with Republicans about the possibility of conducting Whitewater hearings , no dates were set -- prompting a clearly disappointed Leach to go_to the floor on the last_day before Congress ' spring recess to outline what he said are the results of his months-long inquiry . Among Leach ' s key assertions : * The Clintons , far from losing nearly $ 69 # 000 on their ill-starred investment as they have claimed , &quot; received value from Whitewater in excess of the resources ( they ) invested. &quot; He apparently was counting political and other benefits , as well as possible financial_gain . * Funds from Madison Guaranty may have been improperly used to help pay_off a personal_loan of $ 50 # 000 that Clinton took_out to help finance his 1984 gubernatorial campaign . * Federal regulators in Washington , hoping to stifle the political fallout , interfered with the Madison investigation being conducted by the Kansas City office of the RTC , the agency charged with overseeing clean-up of the nation ' s multibillion-dollar S &amp; L failures . He cited the meeting between Breslaw and Lewis as evidence of high-level pressure on the investigation , though Lewis ' notes said that Breslaw indicated her superiors in Washington were hoping for -- but not insisting on -- a finding that Whitewater did not benefit from Madison funds . Leach himself acknowledged indirectly that his evidence does not directly tie Clinton to wrong-doing , saying that &quot; on the landscape of political scandals &quot; Whitewater may end_up being only &quot; a bump. &quot; But he also asserted that deception and greed inherent in Whitewater &quot; speaks mountains about the Me-Generation ethics &quot; of the 1980s and in some ways should be condemned more_than the so-called Keating Five scandal , to which he said it bore disturbing similarities . Five senators were investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for allegedly helping Charles H . Keating , owner of failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan , in return for campaign contributions . &quot; In a nutshell , &quot; Leach added , &quot; Whitewater is about the arrogance of power. &quot; Leach said that one of the Kansas City investigators whom he did not identify by name -- but who was understood from information provided by other sources to be Lewis -- later was &quot; removed from the case &quot; for refusing to abide_by the &quot; gag order &quot; imposed on her by her superiors in Washington . She and several other investigators from the Kansas City office &quot; courageously &quot; resisted the attempts to deflect their Madison inquiry and &quot; have sought whistle-blower protection rather than comply with the Washington . . . gag order , &quot; Leach said . On Leach ' s charge that Lewis , the RTC lead investigator on Madison Guaranty , was removed from the case , his documents included an E-mail computer message last Nov . 10 from Lewis to four other FTC officials . &quot; Hey you ! &quot; the message opens . &quot; Just a heads_up to let you know that Mike Caron , Senior Criminal Investigator , is now the lead investigator on Madison . . . so any more faxes you send should come_to Mike ' s attention , and any further communications about Madison should go_to him , too . &quot; The Powers That Be have decided that I ' m better_off out of the line_of_fire ( and I ain ' t arguing ) , but please let me assure you , that we are leaving you in very capable hands ! &quot; Three days later , on Nov . 15 , 1993 , Lewis was still sufficiently involved in the case to send a computer message to Lee O . Ausen , another RTC investigations official , urging that she be allowed to attend an upcoming meeting with a Justice_Department attorney appointed to head the investigation . &quot; ( Justice_Department lawyer Donald ) McKay is not coming here to look_at records , &quot; she wrote . &quot; Cut_to the bottom_line . He is coming here because he wants to be convinced that there either IS or IS NOT a very good case behind those referrals . . . . He ' s coming here to evaluate us , our work , and to try and decide just how good this case is , and how he can best deal with a very sensitive political situation . . . &quot; If this meeting is going_to turn_into a turkey shoot , then you are going_to need every loaded gun you ' ve got_to assist you in convincing this special prosecutor that the case is as_good_as it looks_on the surface . And yes , we have strong documentation to support the allegations . But what ' s beneath the surface , including where we looked and why , who ' s tied to who , who ' s in business with who , who got paid_for what and where all_the internal and external ties are , isn ' t in writing . It ' s in my head. &quot; Times staff writer Ronald J . Ostow contributed to this story .</TEXT>
