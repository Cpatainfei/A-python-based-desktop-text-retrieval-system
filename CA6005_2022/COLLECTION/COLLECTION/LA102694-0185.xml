   <HEADLINE> UCI WINS STATUS AS DESIGNATED CANCER CENTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> UC Irvine has been named a cancer center by the National Cancer Institute , a prestigious designation -- shared by only a handful of other institutions in California -- that is specifically intended to bring the fruits of basic research to patients ' bedsides . The designation , which UCI has been working toward for five years , was the only one given by NCI this fiscal_year and a coup for the relatively young university , which is bucking to become a top-level research institution . It comes_with a three-year grant of about $ 3 million and is the first_step in obtaining even more coveted status as a &quot; comprehensive cancer center &quot; such_as UCLA or USC . &quot; It ' s probably the most important thing to happen for the cancer program in the last 15 years , &quot; said UCI Cancer Center Director Frank L . Meyskens Jr. , of UCI ' s new status . &quot; On a national level , it ' s of enormous importance. &quot; The designation &quot; is a validation of the excellent cancer-related research and treatment-related activities that take_place at UCI ( and ) it puts us in the major_leagues along with other university-based cancer centers around the nation , &quot; said cancer virologist Hung Fan , co-director of the center . Fifty-four institutions in the United States are NCI-designated cancer centers , seven in California . UCI is the first in Orange County . The designation is important not so_much for grant money as for how it brings_together a variety of disciplines and researchers in a common effort against a complex disease , said NCI and UCI officials . Much of the money will be spent on shared resources -- such_as a biostatistics , molecular_biology and tissue-storage facilities -- that individual research grants often do not cover . Institutions that receive the NCI designation already receive the majority of their funding from other sources in the National Institutes of Health , for example , or from the American Cancer Society . UCI ' s center already had a base of more_than $ 18 million in ongoing grants and contracts , said spokeswoman Fran Tardiff . At UCI , more_than 100 faculty_members and seven research programs will be involved in the center ' s projects -- from the basic research program looking_at how cancer_cells grow to the clinical oncology program , which conducts patient studies . The NCI award is &quot; sort of the glue that holds a . . . much larger research base together , &quot; said Margaret Holmes , chief of NCI ' s Cancer Centers Branch . It is &quot; a support grant allowing ( researchers ) to coalesce into a synergistic group &quot; that NCI hopes will provide new insights into cancer and new applications in the clinical setting , she said . For patients in this region , that may mean inclusion in studies offering access to new medications and innovative treatments not widely available previously in Orange County . Next year , for example , UCI will embark_on a bone_marrow transplantation program and stem-cell therapy , which involves a new way of harvesting marrow . UCI ' s cancer center already enters more_than 150 people annually in clinical trials . Patients also will benefit from the multidisciplinary approach to management of cancer and the fact that UCI is becoming more active in a national network of prominent research institutions , Meyskens said . It is not , however , always a short hop from basic research to clinical applications , researchers said . &quot; Some of the applications are right around the corner , but other applications may take years before we can bring them to treatment of patients , &quot; Fan said . Nevertheless , the very act of preparing_for the NCI designation has helped to close the traditional gap between basic scientists and clinical researchers , and has already stimulated an important dialogue , he said . Ten years ago , he said , the two sets of researchers tended to be &quot; a little bit parochial &quot; in their approaches , &quot; interested in their own problems. &quot; The division was reinforced by geography : Basic science researchers , by and large , were based at the main UCI campus in Irvine , whereas the clinical group was headquartered at the medical_center in Orange . &quot; Before we could even think_about starting this application ( for the NCI designation ) , all_of the cancer researchers . . . had to get_together and understand the entire cancer picture at UCI , &quot; Fan said . Meyskens , known for his laboratory and clinical research on melanoma and chemical prevention of cancer , was the &quot; driving force &quot; bringing the two sides closer together , said Fan , a basic researcher who studies mouse leukemia . Meyskens was recruited five years ago from the University of Arizona specifically to create an NCI-class cancer center . The NCI designation brings greater visibility to a cancer center already known for its clinical accomplishments in gynecological oncology , melanoma , urological cancers and head and neck cancers , Meyskens said . UCI also is known for cancer prevention research and basic research into the origins of cancer_cells , growth factors , virology and molecular_biology . In general , NCI ' S Holmes said , the increased visibility can be expected to attract more high-quality investigators and a greater level of interest and investment from inside and outside a center . Meyskens said it will strengthen UCI ' s cancer services across the board and provide an overall boost to the institution . &quot; UCI always was known for its basic research , &quot; he said . &quot; Where we were behind was in the clinical research areas. &quot; Cancer Center Components Laboratory and clinical research conducted at UCI Cancer Center contributed to its receiving a cancer center designation from the National Cancer Institute . Here are the 12 units of the UCI Cancer Center and their activities : AT UCI MEDICAL_CENTER , ORANGE * Cancer Center : Offers patient diagnosis and treatment , clinical research * Human Tumor Tissue Shared Resource : Collects and characterizes tumor specimens * Clinical Investigations Shared Resource : Coordinates , monitors patient trials AT UCI CAMPUS , IRVINE * Biostatistics Shared Resource : Studies design , statistical analysis of clinical research * Molecular Biology Shared Resource : Synthesis , purification and analysis of substances for basic and clinical research * Optical Biology Shared Resource : Video and laser imaging and manipulation * UCI Medical Plaza : Cancer treatment on outpatient basis * Beckman Laser Institute : Studies light and its interaction with cells and tissues * Cancer Surveillance Program : Measures cancer incidence , conducts cancer control research * Developmental Biology Center : Studies structure and function of macromolecules * Research Unit in Animal Virology : Develops viral vaccines by researching cancer in animals * Research Unit for Health Policy and Research : Fosters research related to medical_care access and illness prevention and death among minorities , children and the elderly CALIFORNIA CENTERS Of the 54 cancer centers in the United States designated by the National Cancer Institute , UCI becomes the seventh in California . The other six are : * Kenneth Norris Jr . Comprehensive Cancer Center at USC * Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at UCLA * La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation * UC San Diego Cancer Center * City of Hope Beckman Research Institute , Duarte * Armand Hammer Center for Cancer Biology at the Salk Institute , La Jolla Source : UCI Cancer Center</TEXT>
