   <HEADLINE> KOREAN AMERICANS STILL PONDER FATE OF EDWARD CHO ; CULTURE : SOME FEEL O.C. DEVELOPER , WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE AFTER CHILD-MOLESTATION CONVICTION , WAS A VICTIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The two-hour home video could have been a chronicle of any happy , suburban family over a 10-year period , a house full of proud parents and growing children on a number of joyous occasions . They celebrate birthdays . They take family trips to American landmarks . In one culturally distinctive ceremony for this affluent Korean American family , the children come_forward one by one and bow to their father , touching their foreheads to the floor in a gesture of obeisance and respect . There is no hint of what was to ensue . The father , Kyung Mook ( Edward ) Cho , 54 , a multimillionaire Orange County real_estate developer , was accused of molesting four of his children . His eldest daughter and her boyfriend committed suicide soon afterward , another daughter denounced him in court as &quot; possessed by Satan , &quot; and a year ago this month he was convicted of 25 counts of sexual abuse and child molestation . Cho ' s 84-year prison sentence on Dec . 17 , followed by his shocking Christmas_Day suicide in the Orange County Jail , drew headlines throughout Southern California . But it was in the region ' s Korean American community -- where Cho was already something of a controversial figure -- that the tragic saga provoked the most soul-searching and continues to puzzle many . While the judge in the case called his behavior &quot; despicable &quot; and his children were devastated by what happened , Cho continued to assert his innocence in the days after his conviction . In half_a_dozen open_letters to Korean American newspapers , Cho suggested that he was the victim of scheming children and that an all-white Orange County jury didn ' t understand authoritarian -- but not abusive -- Korean family practices . The case was extensively covered in the Korean American press ; Cho ' s letters prompted much debate within the community , and his suicide added_to it . Did he kill himself , overwhelmed by guilt , in the face of a long prison sentence ? Or was his suicide a final declaration of innocence not to be ignored ? &quot; People are confused because Mr. Cho killed himself , &quot; said Dr. Injong Hong , executive_director of the L.A. Korean Family Counseling and Legal Advice Center . &quot; Some people believe he killed himself to prove he was innocent. &quot; Months after the suicide , Hong said recently , some Korean Americans are &quot; still struggling with what happened. &quot; * To this day , there are many in the Korean American community who believe that Edward Cho was the victim of vindictive children who rebelled against his strict , traditional parenting by inventing unthinkable charges against their father , accusations believed by the jurors . &quot; Culture killed him , &quot; said Chris Nam , vice_president of the Korean Assn . of Orange County , who emigrated from the same Korean village as his friend Cho . Cho strongly asserted the same point . In a letter to his minister -- written from the Orange County Jail and later published in two Korean-language newspapers -- Cho contended that &quot; Orange County ' s all-white jurors ' biases and their inability to understand other cultures brought_about &quot; his conviction . Perhaps because child sexual abuse is virtually unheard of in the Korean American community , the case generated more_than 50 articles in the Korean press , including the open_letters from Cho . &quot; Many Koreans , more_than half , don ' t want to believe it , &quot; said Brian Min , a reporter for the Korea Times ' Los Angeles Edition , who covered the case . During a custody_case and a criminal trial , and in documents filed for a civil lawsuit over Cho ' s estate , Cho ' s children argued that Cho ' s behavior grew from his feudal notion that they were his property . Cho ' s son claimed at the criminal trial that his father sexually abused him because Cho appeared to believe that &quot; he owned me or something . I was his property. &quot; Cho lost custody of the boy and his sister , who were still living at_home , in a Juvenile_Court proceeding , but jurors in the criminal trial acquitted Cho of charges of fondling his son . &quot; Sometimes Korean fathers exert unreasonable discipline or exercise an authoritarian way of rearing children , which creates tremendous emotional turmoil in their children , &quot; agreed Moon Ju Kim , education minister at Bethel Korean Church in Irvine . &quot; I am a Korean American female , &quot; said Erica M . Kim , one of Edward Cho ' s civil attorneys , &quot; and I know the pressures . Korean parents feel that if there is no pressure , kids will go_out and do what they want. &quot; The revelations that have poured_out in the three court proceedings stand_in stark contrast to the idyllic image of a successful , suburban American household that the Cho family offered to the world outside . After immigrating to the U.S. in 1971 , Cho prospered in Orange County , concentrating his real_estate business in Garden Grove and amassing holdings that at one time were estimated at nearly $ 3.5 million . He lived_in a large house in Fountain Valley and worked his way to prominence in the Korean American business_community . But even before allegations of sexual abuse were made against him in 1992 , Edward Cho was a controversial figure . &quot; Some people in the Korean community didn ' t like him because they thought he was like Scrooge , &quot; said Myong Hwan ( David ) Son , one of Cho ' s best and oldest friends . Cho was well-known for his reluctance to pick_up a meal check , and he argued over bets at weekly , penny-ante poker_games , he said . At the same time , however , Cho made large donations to a variety of civic and cultural organizations , said Son , a frequent visitor to Cho ' s home . In 1986 , just a_few years after moving to the area from Northern California , Cho was elected president of the Korean Assn . of Orange County , largely because he was the only candidate that year willing to put_up the $ 10 # 000 required to serve , according to Tom Kim , who was then the association ' s vice_president . Cho ' s tenure lasted only a_few months and ended in acrimony when he changed his mind about serving and demanded his money back , Kim said . He filed suit against several of the association ' s former presidents . All of those who knew Cho -- family members , business associates , attorneys and even his minister -- agreed that he was a strict disciplinarian , an authoritarian father who inflicted corporal_punishment when necessary . He tried to exert almost total control over his children ' s lives , dictating everything from whom they could befriend to what colleges they would attend and what professions they would pursue , friends and family said . &quot; In the Korean household , the father is the dominant figure , &quot; said Erica Kim , Cho ' s civil attorney . &quot; Everyone obeys everything that Dad says . &quot; Mr. Cho was an extreme example of that , &quot; she added . &quot; He was extremely stingy , very shrewd , very bright , very aggressive. &quot; * The fourth of eight children born to poor , uneducated parents in a rural Korean village , Edward Cho worked his way through a church college in Seoul . Upon his arrival in the United States , he worked as a Seventh-day Adventist minister in the Northern California community of San Lorenzo for eight years . After a short-lived marriage that produced two children , Cho remarried and had two more children . Cho had increasing success in Northern California as a restaurateur and real_estate developer . But his life as a conventional family_man was interrupted in 1983 , when he moved to Los Angeles and sent to Korea for two more of his daughters from a previous relationship , Young Sun Cho and her younger sister . What happened between 1983 and 1992 , in various residences in Los Angeles and Orange counties , is documented in police reports , in testimony at Cho ' s eight-day criminal trial and in documents filed_in connection with the civil suit brought by four of Edward Cho ' s children . Despite Cho ' s death , that suit will be tried against Cho ' s estate and his widow . Further documentation comes from a juvenile custody hearing during which the two youngest Cho children were removed from the home . Normally confidential , testimony and rulings from that hearing were printed in documents filed for the civil trial and in an appeals court decision upholding the removal of the children . Shortly after her father brought her from Korea , Young Sun Cho later told authorities , her father began forcing her to have_sex with him . She was 14 at the time . &quot; He just comes_in , and I will be laying there , &quot; Young Sun Cho testified at the preliminary hearing , &quot; and he . . . will just have_sex with me . . . . &quot; By acquiescing to her father , Young Sun Cho testified , &quot; I always thought I was protecting my sister . . . from him having_sex with her . . . him abusing her. &quot; But , the younger sister testified , Edward Cho also began to abuse her sexually at the age of 9 and continued to do so for nine years . Both daughters said they were unaware the other was being victimized . &quot; Afterwards he said , ' Well , I ' ll buy you a Rolls-Royce ' . . . I felt really cheap , &quot; the younger daughter testified . Young Sun Cho said in the preliminary hearing that her father had twice impregnated her and forced her to undergo abortions , a claim Edward Cho denied . The children testified at Cho ' s trial that their father also regularly kicked and beat them and his wife , sometimes with a stick and a tennis_racquet . He threw bowls and furniture at them , they said . Cho ' s widow acknowledged that her husband physically disciplined the children , but denied that he was brutal . In early 1992 , Young Sun Cho , then 23 , moved_out of the house . Several months later , on April 23 , she contacted the Orange County Department of Social_Services Child_Abuse Registry , records show . On May 6 , Young Sun Cho and her younger sister repeated their charges to Fountain Valley police . On May 11 , the Department of Social_Services removed the two younger children from the home . The younger children also testified later about inappropriate touching by their father . Edward Cho was arrested several days later . Five months after bringing the sex abuse charges , Young Sun Cho and her boyfriend , who had encouraged her to come_forward , killed themselves in their Los Angeles apartment . &quot; There is no doubt in my mind that Young Sun killed herself due_to the abuse , &quot; Detective Kim Brown of the Fountain Valley Police_Department wrote in a report . &quot; In talking with her , she was very disturbed about the sexual abuse and the methods of fear used by their father to make her submit . The torment he caused fueled her decision to take her own life. &quot; Edward Cho ' s younger daughter testified in his subsequent criminal trial on rape and sexual molestation charges , and the testimony of Young Sun Cho at an earlier hearing was read to the jury . Both said that their father told them that such sexual_activity was permitted by the Bible , and that they should pretend he was a movie_star during sex . During the custody proceedings , Edward Cho vigorously denied the abuse charges , and at his criminal trial said he had not forced his daughter to have the abortions . On the witness_stand , he called the charges &quot; unthinkable , &quot; the accusations &quot; gross , heinous things. &quot; Edward Cho steadfastly maintained that the crimes never occurred . Speaking through an interpreter , he said at his sentencing that sending him to prison would be &quot; a sad miscarriage of justice. &quot; His younger daughter , Edward Cho said , was &quot; imagining these things . . . . She wants to get_back at me , to get her revenge . . . . I have tried to be a good father. &quot; Edward Cho ' s attorney , John Barnett , invoked the Salem witch trials , telling the jury at Cho ' s criminal trial that Cho ' s older daughters were &quot; sophisticated , and they ( were ) cunning , and they knew what they wanted . And what they wanted was not vindication . . . hat they wanted was money . . . . There was not any sex . . . that didn ' t happen. &quot; When he was out on bail awaiting trial , Edward Cho had assembled the two-hour home video of happy family occasions spanning a decade . He put it together &quot; because he thought if the jury had an opportunity to see it , it would basically convince everybody that they had a happy family life and everything was normal , &quot; said Erica Kim , his civil attorney . But Barnett said he did not attempt to introduce the tape at the criminal trial because he felt the sequences showing the Cho children bowing to him -- in one case in exchange for money -- might be misinterpreted by jurors and damage Cho ' s case . On May 5 , 1993 , a jury found Cho guilty of 25 counts of sexual abuse against three of his children . He was acquitted of molesting his son . * The civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of four of Cho ' s six children : the two minors , who are now in foster care , a daughter who is in college and Young Sun Cho , who committed suicide after the lawsuit was filed . The lawsuit asks_for $ 13 million or whatever remains of Edward Cho ' s real_estate holdings . The children also sued Edward Cho ' s wife for allegedly allowing the molestation to occur . Depositions in the case are now being taken . Attorneys for the Cho estate and his widow have responded by blaming his two older daughters for a plot to acquire his wealth -- a charge they deny . But money -- even a great_deal of money -- would not have been enough temptation for the Cho children to expose themselves to the shame that is experienced by victims of incest and sexual abuse , experts say . &quot; Dragging your family in , bringing such a suit is a big disgrace , &quot; said Dr. Eun Mee Kim , associate_professor of sociology at USC . &quot; No amount_of_money can restore their name. &quot; Yet , to the day he was found hanging_in his jail_cell from a noose of braided , torn bedsheets , Edward Cho maintained that what happened to him could happen to any stern Korean parent . &quot; If I were to go_to jail as a criminal , &quot; he wrote in a letter to the Orange County United Korea Student Assn. , &quot; then our 30 million Koreans should all go_to prison. &quot;</TEXT>
