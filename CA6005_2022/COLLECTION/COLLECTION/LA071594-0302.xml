   <TEXT> I saw Elvis on the Internet , and I have the printouts to prove it . Scoff if you like . I now know the exact street_corner in Toronto where velvet Elvis paintings are sold , that a CD-ROM tour of Graceland is soon to be released and that there are 126 books about Elvis ' life currently in print , including &quot; The Elvis Presley Encyclopedia , &quot; &quot; The Official FBI File on Elvis &quot; and &quot; God ' s Work Through Elvis. &quot; I stumbled across this information -- and I do mean stumbled -- in the course of learning about the legendary research capabilities of the Internet , the international network that combines the forces of thousands of computers accessible by millions of users . To those skilled in the use of the Internet for research , there are vast amounts of information available in the form of text , photographs , artworks , sounds and even videos that can be downloaded to the home computer . But the Internet is decidedly not , in its purer forms , user friendly . Full access -- whether gained through a university ( many offer free use of the Internet to students and staff_members ) , an employer or a paid service -- requires patience and one of the many thick guides you can find in your bookstore ' s computer section ( good_luck -- I have not looked_at all_of them , but I have yet to find one that gives easily understood how-to instructions ) . Navigating around the full Internet still requires a bit of knowledge of the UNIX computer_language that was the standard long before Macintosh and Windows icons made desktop_computers practical for the masses . My access to the Internet is through the heavily advertised , relatively easy-to-use Delphi service that is owned by Rupert Murdoch ( maybe he uses it to track killer_bee invasions ) and based in Boston . Delphi charges by the hour , but gives new users the first five hours free . You ' ll spend most , if not all_of that time tearing at your hair in frustration and calling Delphi ' s 800 number to plead for assistance . But eventually , even a techno-klutz like me can learn to use at least some of the Internet ' s research tools , such_as FTP , Gopher , Newsgroups and , my favorites , Archie and Veronica . Armed with a dangerously small amount of knowledge , I went_in search of Elvis . First stop was Newsgroups , the hundreds of on-line interest_groups that can be found covering topics ranging from computer_languages to exotic sex rituals . Using the book &quot; Net Guide &quot; ( Random House , 1994 ) that lists Newsgroups by topics , I found one called alt.elvis.king. There were currently 26 messages listed in that area ( as messages get old , they are erased ) , which is a tiny number for a Newsgroup . Some get thousands of messages each week . But the faithful of alt.elvis.king had left heartfelt messages about favorite songs and new products , such_as the upcoming Graceland CD-ROM . One knowledgeable user posted the disappointing news that the CD-ROM tour would not include the upstairs of the mansion . &quot; It is off limits , just like at the real Graceland , &quot; posted a user who calls himself Clayface . Velvet paintings were a hot topic , with exact directions given to those in search of textured images of the king of rock ' n ' roll . One user offered for_sale a velvet painting of Elvis depicted as a bullfighter . I was tempted . But it was off to Veronica , Archie and other search tools used to track_down computer_file titles containing the word &quot; Elvis. &quot; Even as a novice researcher I got_well over 100 hits . Many led to highly technical computer applications named in honor of Elvis . But there was also the White_House photograph of Elvis meeting President Nixon that could be downloaded into my computer . And a bibliographic guide to Elvis ' recordings , movies and TV appearances ran to 267 pages of text . One user , in a text-file on the parallels between the lives of Elvis and Jesus , pointed_out : &quot; Fact : Jesus was resurrected. &quot; &quot; Fact : Elvis had his comeback special in ' 68. &quot; In several files , lyrics to Elvis song hits were listed . And one enterprising user had translated Elvis ' songs into the Swedish-inflected talk_of the Muppets character , the Swedish Chef . &quot; Yuoo een ' t nutheen ' boot a huoond dug , &quot; Cryeen ' ell zee teeme-a. &quot; He used a program created by a computer whiz to translate any normal English into Muppet Swedish Chef talk . Shall we notify the Nobel Committee ? Maybe next year . Finally and best of all , I downloaded a little sound_bite heard at the end of an actual Elvis concert . Using one of the many sound manager programs available , I made_it part of my computer shutdown sequence . Now , every time I turn_off my Macintosh it says , &quot; Elvis has left the building. &quot; * David Colker ' s Internet address is CYBURBIA.delphi.com .</TEXT>
