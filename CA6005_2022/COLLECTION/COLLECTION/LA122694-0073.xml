   <HEADLINE> WEARY PONTIFF LAMENTS RASH OF HOSTILITIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A weary Pope John Paul II tempered the Roman_Catholic_Church ' s joy at Christmas on Sunday with a mournful litany of conflicts that have bloodied much of the world . John Paul opened his traditional &quot; Urbi et Orbi &quot; message -- Latin for &quot; to the city ( of Rome ) and the world &quot; -- with a tribute to families as the church nears the end of its Year of the Family . Then , as has been his custom throughout his 16-year papacy , he turned the end of his message from the balcony of St . Peter ' s Basilica into a lament for places without peace . &quot; As I look_at families in the light of Christmas , I cannot but turn my thoughts to the greater human family , unfortunately torn by persistent forms of selfishness and violence , &quot; the Pope said . &quot; What are we to say of the Sudan with its ' forgotten ' war and of Algeria , where murderous violence holds the whole people hostage ? And the very land where Jesus was born , does_it not continue to be a theater of conflicts and a place of division ? &quot; the pontiff asked . John Paul ' s speech was prepared in_advance , but violent events of the day seemed to make his words ring louder . Near the main entrance to Jerusalem , an Islamic militant blew himself up , wounding 12 people . In Algiers , passengers on a French jetliner were hostages of Muslim militants , who killed at least three people . The Pope also mentioned the fighting in the former Yugoslavia , &quot; tearing_apart the Balkans , &quot; as well as civil_war or tensions in southern Russia , Angola , Rwanda and Burundi . He also singled_out &quot; new centers of tension , &quot; including the Caucasus Mountains . Grozny , the capital of the Russian Caucasus region of Chechnya , was in ruins Sunday after nearly a week of Russian aerial attacks . The 74-year-old pontiff appeared tired Sunday after midnight Mass in the basilica , a private Mass at dawn in his chapel , and a public_service in the basilica late Sunday morning . John Paul shuffled down the main aisle of the basilica , which is about the length of a football_field . He has had problems walking since surgery to repair a broken thigh bone earlier this year . As he left the basilica , the Pope stopped to shake hands with_children along the aisle and waved with his right_hand , its pinkie bandaged . He injured the finger when it was caught in a car_door last month . At the late morning Mass , the Pope invoked the baby Jesus to &quot; move men to lay_down their arms and to draw_close in a universal embrace of peace. &quot; A prayer for peace was offered in Tamil , a language of Sri Lanka , an island nation torn by civil strife that the Pope will visit in January . To the 40 # 000 or so people gathered_in St . Peter ' s Square , the Pope offered Christmas wishes in 54 languages .</TEXT>
