   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; DEMOCRACY POISED TO WIN IN MEXICO ; A REFORMED CONGRESS WILL LIKELY CLIP THE WINGS OF ANY PRESIDENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Almost unnoticed in the final blitz of rallies , opinion polls and punditry surrounding Mexico ' s most hotly contested presidential elections in six decades was this prediction by author Carlos Fuentes : &quot; Mexico will have a bad president , with a good government . . . . He will be a little crippled , because of the way in which he will be elected , a bit one-armed , because of the composition of the Congress ( that will be elected the same day ) , and therefore he will only be able to govern by negotiation. &quot; That , in fact , is among the few shared truths in what promises to be Mexico ' s least predictable and yet most democratic national elections of this century . Sunday ' s electoral showdown is an experiment in pluralism , pegged at a cost of $ 2 billion by outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , that politicians and analysts agree almost certainly will chart a more democratic course for this nation of 92 million as it navigates through endemic poverty , elitist wealth , massive unemployment and potential social unrest . Unprecedented in the uncertainty of its outcome after 65 consecutive years of rule by a single , monolithic political force , the heated and costly campaign for the presidency , Congress and two state governorships already has built several key pillars for fundamental democractic change . Eight independent political_parties -- the largest_number ever -- are competing for power with the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) . The PRI-ruled government has spent $ 730 million on a state-of-art , computerized voter-registration and identification system that has been embraced by all but one of those parties . The government also will permit international observers and a U.N. team of experts to monitor the vote independently for the first time . And each of the three leading presidential candidates has , as a campaign centerpiece , shared commitments to a major overhaul of Mexico ' s often-corrupt and traditionally authoritarian political_system . The most prominent of those promised reforms are the candidates ' vows of power-sharing in the omnipotent executive_branch . The ruling party ' s candidate , 42-year-old Ernesto Zedillo , who has posted a commanding lead in opinion polls commissioned largely by international banks and other institutions that prefer the PRI , has vowed to consider members of the opposition for his Cabinet if he wins . His leading challenger , 53-year-old Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the center-right National Action Party ( PAN ) , has made a similar public pledge . Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , who many believe was cheated out of the presidency through fraud in the 1988 elections , has made no such public vow , but supporters of his center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) said they expect some level of power-sharing if Cardenas surges from his third-place position in the polls to win . But there are several less obvious but potentially more far-reaching reforms put_in place by Salinas that will kick_in with almost immediate effect after the elections . And , of those , the most dramatic are changes in the size and composition of the Congress . It is these changes that Fuentes and other respected Mexican analysts have concluded -- barring civil_war or massive Election_Day fraud -- inevitably will propel Mexico into a new era of lively , although potentially turbulent , democracy . In short , those analysts say , no matter which of the three leading presidential contenders is elected to lead the nation into the 21st Century this Sunday , this experiment in pluralist democracy is almost certain to transform the internal balance_of_power here . And it will do so , they say , by shattering the traditional role of Mexico ' s Chamber of Deputies and its Senate , both historically rubber-stamp bastions of a president handpicked by the ruling PRI . Overnight , the 500-seat Chamber of Deputies , which will be elected under a new proportional_representation system that precludes a two-thirds majority for any party , will become a far more autonomous political force , according to independent and ruling party analysts . The Senate will double in size to 128 seats , many of which will go_to the opposition . And both houses are expected to become far more free-wheeling marketplaces of power , in which the PRI will be unable to alter the nation ' s constitution as it has with abandon in the past . Under the constitution , the Congress does have extensive powers of checks and balances . It just never has chosen to exercise them . And under the new rules of the game , the opposition and ruling party alike agree that Mexico ' s political landscape is bound to resemble more the U.S.-style balance_of_power between the legislative and executive_branches . &quot; The effect is that the executive in power cannot pass all_the laws he wants , &quot; said Carlos Castillo , PAN ' s president and chief strategist , who predicted that his party will win at least 140 seats in the new Chamber of Deputies . &quot; It ' s a more balanced system of power , and it is the same if Zedillo or Diego will win. &quot; Other analysts , particularly those associated with Cardenas and the PRD , are not as confident that the changes will come so swiftly -- or even directly -- through the next Congress . Jorge Castaneda , a respected analyst and professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico , said the PRI still could create an effective two-thirds majority by forming alliances with smaller parties , as it did after the 1988 presidential elections . But Castaneda , who is among the founding members of a center-left collective of intellectuals known as the San Angel Group , said that fundamental power-sharing is at_hand . &quot; The whole San Angel premise is that no one will win with more_than 40 % of the vote , &quot; he said . The legislature will be fractious , the nation polarized and civil unrest a threat , Castaneda said . Under such conditions , he added , &quot; the premise is that Mexico is ungovernable with a PRI president . You will need a coalition government -- a real coalition that includes everyone . You have to share power -- really share power -- and you have to get a deal on a common program. &quot; Predictably , the PRI ' s Zedillo and his party ' s once-unbeatable political_machine scoff at such a scenario . Using the final , though yet unproven , poll results released by pro-PRI institutions last Friday ( most showed Zedillo with more_than 40 % support to 20 % for Diego and 10 % for Cardenas ) , they are striving to set the stage for a major PRI victory . The ruling party quickly points_out , however , that even if he wins big , Zedillo has publicly committed himself to significant power-sharing and to the new , independent role of Congress . In an Aug . 4 speech that shocked members of the PRI ' s old_guard , who have come_to be known as &quot; dinosaurs , &quot; Zedillo promised a series of radical reforms , both within the party and in its relations with the executive_branch . &quot; The premise of the relationship between the executive power and the legislature is that it strictly respects the legislature ' s autonomy , &quot; Zedillo declared . &quot; The pluralist composition of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate represents a fundamental factor for independent politics . &quot; The executive must_not only obey the decisions of the legislature , it must also work respectfully and concertedly with Congress . . . ( to ) ensure a balance and a counterbalance between the powers. &quot; Hardly radical to a U.S. audience , such commitments from the PRI ' s presidential hopeful are borderline surreal when viewed through the prism of Mexican Congresses past . Here ' s a glimpse through that prism : When the Mexican legislature adjourned for Christmas last December , Sergio Aguayo declared in a front-page commentary in the highly regarded daily La Jornada , &quot; The Mexican Congress closed the year with another brilliant demonstration of irrelevance and insensitivity . &quot; With few exceptions , the Mexican legislature behaved according to the absolutely predictable rules : One party , the PRI , dominated the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate ; the members of this party always obeyed the orders of the president of the republic , and the result was : Congress approved everything -- absolutely everything -- that the executive sent. &quot; Among the illustrations of that irrelevance culled from the files of the last Congress : the days-long debate about Madonna last October . For seemingly endless hours , the deputies wrangled over a resolution to ban a scheduled Madonna concert . &quot; Why Madonna ' No ' and Michael Jackson ' Yes ? ' &quot; PRD legislator Cristobal Arias asked PRI legislator Fernando Lerdo , who had objected to the singer ' s performance on the grounds of cultural sovereignty . His arguments against the concert included : &quot; It denigrates us ; it ' s part of the garbage that other countries reject , and it promotes the most odious of sins , like homosexuality , lesbianism , sodomy. &quot; Such have been the legislative realities that they have created a collective frustration among the opposition , which was embodied in one PRD legislator who came_to be known as &quot; the egg lady. &quot; She had tried -- and failed -- to bring baskets of eggs into the legislature to throw at the ruling party . On one occasion , however , she managed to play a tape of John Lennon ' s &quot; Imagine &quot; to underscore a vitriolic attack on the absence of democracy in the legislature . Despite the PRI power , there nevertheless have been illustrations of the popular demand among most Mexicans to reform the Congress into a truly democratic body . During a particularly heated debate on a landlord-tenant bill that Salinas was pushing_through Congress , a furious mob representing more_than 20 civic organizations stormed the Chamber of Deputies . They smashed windows , wounded a security_guard and spent seven hours protesting , trying to pressure the ruling party into backing_away from the bill . But a month later , with the Chamber of Deputies under heavy guard , the bill skated through . It is this kind of lopsided vote that opposition strategists such_as PAN ' s Castillo expects to end when the new legislature is seated . It is not as if he expects his party to take_control of Congress . In fact , he said , he expects the PRI to maintain its majority in the legislature -- even if Fernandez wins the presidency . But Castillo , confirming what several ruling party officials have indicated privately , said an ultimate irony would take_shape if Zedillo wins and tries to force reforms on a legislature dominated by old-guard PRI deputies . &quot; I think Zedillo will have more problems than Diego in working with Congress , &quot; he said , &quot; because Zedillo is not very well-appreciated among many within the PRI. &quot; Powerful History Mexico ' s Institutional Revolutionary Party has claimed up_to 75 % of the Chamber of Deputies in recent years . But new laws preclude any party from occupying so many seats . Elections for the body are held every three years . % of Chamber of Deputies seats PRI : Institutional Revolutionary Party PAN : National Action Party 1991 PRI : 65 % PAN : 18 % Other Parties : 18 % * 1988 PRI : 53 % PAN : 20 % Other Parties : 27 % * 1985 PRI : 72 % PAN : 10 % Other Parties : 18 % * 1982 PRI : 75 % PAN : 13 % Other Parties : 12 % NOTE : Figures may_not add_up to 100 % due_to rounding .
