   <HEADLINE> SUSPECT LABELS MEXICO SLAYING FIRST OF A PLOT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The assassination of the second-ranking official in the ruling party was the first in a plot to kill reform-minded politicians , according to a suspect ' s declaration announced Sunday by police . Francisco Ruiz Massieu , the slain general secretary of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , which has ruled Mexico for 65 years , was just one name on a list of planned victims , suspect Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez told police . In his statement , Rodriguez Gonzalez outlined a complicated murder plot with strong hints of a liaison between politicians and drug lords . He said that his brother Fernando , a top aide to an important congressman from Tamaulipas , had told him : &quot; There is a list of important people in Mexico who have to die because they support a series of reforms for the political modernization of that country. &quot; The slaying would also politically weaken the victim ' s brother , Mario , who is the assistant attorney_general in_charge of anti-narcotics enforcement , Rodriguez Gonzalez said his brother told him . Police had questioned and released the congressman , Manuel Munoz Rocha , on Friday , after the alleged triggerman , Daniel Aguilar Trevino , said Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez was the person who had shown him Ruiz Massieu ' s photo and identified him as the target of the assassination they were planning . The attorney_general has asked the legislature to revoke Munoz Rocha ' s congressional immunity , thus permitting him to be arrested . Prosecutors also added criminal association to the charges against Aguilar Trevino . Mexicans had immediately suspected political infighting in connection with the assassination of Ruiz Massieu , who was slated to be majority_leader in the next Congress . Nevertheless , the news provoked shock and indignation . &quot; This is shameful for the nation , &quot; said Patricia Ruiz , deputy for the leftist opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party . &quot; Congress should be the best the nation has to offer , not a den of criminals. &quot; As the investigation continued into the second major political assassination in just over six months , the judge in the trial of Mario Aburto Martinez -- accused of the March 23 murder of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio -- considered a prosecution motion to convict Aburto and sentence him to 50 years in prison . Mexico has no death_penalty . Many Mexicans suspect there was a plot to kill Colosio , and three men are in jail awaiting trial as accomplices . But two successive special prosecutors have yet to turn_up the kind of testimony Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez has provided in the latest case . Also , unlike the Colosio killing , in which the history of the gun used remains a mystery , the attorney_general ' s office Sunday said it had found the source of the weapon in the Ruiz Massieu case . A police_officer in Tamaulipas , Jose Pascual Alvarez , admitted having sold the handgun used in the slaying to Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez . At the same time , Rodriguez Gonzalez told police , he also bought an AK-47 . Civilians are prohibited from owning such high-powered weapons in Mexico . The purchase of the gun , according to Rodriguez Gonzalez , was part of a carefully planned plot that included obtaining detailed information about Ruiz Massieu ' s habits . He said that Munoz Rocha contacted his old friend , Abraham Rubio Canales , for that information . Rubio Canales is in prison in Acapulco after being convicted of land fraud while he was tourism secretary under Ruiz Massieu , a former governor of Guerrero . Police have questioned Rubio Canales but released no information . Rubio Canales is also the father-in-law of Raul Valladares , recently arrested by Mario Ruiz Massieu on cocaine trafficking charges . Valladares is believed to be the lieutenant of Juan Garcia Abrego , accused of heading the powerful Gulf cartel . The cartel is widely believed to run Tamaulipas . Rodriguez Gonzalez said his brother told him in early September to hire two bodyguards and bring them to Mexico_City . He offered the jobs to Aguilar Trevino and Carlos Angel Cantu . Only after they arrived in the capital were they told that they had been contracted to commit murder . Jesus Sanchez -- Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez ' s chauffeur -- told police he was to drive his boss to a place near the scene of the killing and to wait for the triggerman . But when he saw police_cars gathering , he said , he panicked and drove to Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez ' s home . There , he was told to meet his boss ' s brother at a city park . From the park , they drove to a restaurant , where Sanchez said he was promised an apartment and an unspecified sum_of_money in return for his part in the slaying . Meanwhile , a bank security_guard had tackled Aguilar Trevino and turned him over to police . Aguilar Trevino told police that Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez and Cantu had offered to pay him about $ 17 # 000 to kill Ruiz Massieu . Cantu turned himself in to authorities in the border town of Matamoros late Saturday and was being questioned . Aguilar Trevino told police that Cantu went_with him to the scene of the slaying . Cantu told reporters he believed they were going_to buy tamales .</TEXT>
