   <HEADLINE> EUROPE : FIVE YEARS LATER ; SARAJEVO , BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA ; A WORST-CASE SCENARIO OF RAPID CHANGE ; ONCE COMMUNISM ' S SUCCESS STORY , THE FORMER YUGOSLAV FEDERATION HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY WAR AND ETHNIC DIVISION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The glass-and-steel Unis office towers loom over the city like charred skeletons , their mirrored windows blasted out by artillery shells , the metal frames blackened by fire . In what were once modern apartment_houses hugging the rocky banks of the Miljacka River , artists and professional people pass their days debating politics in salons adorned with pianos and oil_paintings but deprived of heat , water and light . Sarajevo airport , given a face_lift for the 1984 Winter_Olympics , is now a sandbagged no-man ' s-land , straddling a deadly front_line between the forces of the Bosnian government and rebel Serb nationalists . The few civilians leaving this besieged city must grope through a secret tunnel dug under the runway . In the most bitter of post-Communist ironies afflicting Eastern Europe , the people of the former Yugoslav federation who enjoyed the region ' s most prosperous lifestyle have been lured in this vaunted age of reform and freedom into the bloodiest conflict to disrupt Europe since World_War_II . For the brutalized people of Bosnia-Herzegovina , a comfortable and cultured life has been destroyed and replaced with a daily battle for survival . Five years after the anti-Communist revolutions that were supposed to have ushered_in a new_world order , Bosnia -- especially this shattered capital -- has become a monument to madness and a reminder that even sophisticated societies are not immune to the virus of nationalism . The violent breakup of Yugoslavia has also shaken the widely held belief that people with food on the table , work to perform and faith in the future can learn to overcome past sufferings and injustice . Under the stern , paternalistic rule of the late Josip Broz , known throughout his 35-year presidency by his wartime code name of Marshal Tito , the myriad peoples of the Balkan federation came_to see themselves as Yugoslavs and to overlook individual national groups ' earlier trespasses against each other . But even after four decades of peace and prosperity , skillful manipulation by a handful of political zealots persuaded the descendants of those who suffered atrocities during World_War_II that they should neither forgive nor forget . &quot; We all had a very good life before this war . There was no reason for it to have happened , except that some backward people who live_in the mountains decided they had to avenge history , &quot; says a Sarajevo elementary_school principal , Narcis Polimac . His praise of the Yugoslavia that has been systematically destroyed over the last four years echoes the words of almost every victim of the conflict , with the blame for it subject_to ethnic variation . Many here and in the former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia , Macedonia and Croatia -- also now independent states -- lay the blame on Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic , who began more_than seven years ago to whip_up a nationalist psychosis to enhance his own power . Others , especially Serbs , accuse Croatian extremists of confusing independence with ethnic supremacy and undermining the national reconciliation achieved by Tito . For Bosnians , caught in the cross-fire of the resurgent Serb-Croat conflict , the horror and devastation visited on their fledgling state is a cruel twist of history that might have been avoided if Tito had lived another decade . Portraits of the late Yugoslav strongman , who died in 1980 , still adorn homes and offices in Bosnia , where the most beleaguered victims of the 2 1 / 2-year-old war believe that they might have been spared if the partisan hero had survived to pilot his people into the post-Cold War world . Instead , a decade-long power struggle ensued , with unscrupulous politicians emerging to seize the reins of authority and drive the Yugoslav peoples into war and ruin . Attacks spurred retaliation . Suffering nurtured resentment . Atrocities sated a thirst for revenge . Now , after 30 months on the treadmill of violence , both the Serbian nationalists holding the high ground and the hapless civilians trapped in inaptly named &quot; U.N. safe havens &quot; below nurse festering grudges against each other for a war that has dropped their living standard nearly into the Stone_Age . Many blame Western powers as much as they blame nationalists for allowing their country to be overrun while mouthing platitudes about the sanctity of property and borders . &quot; Our only mistake was believing the outside world would help us when we were attacked , &quot; says Polimac , the principal . &quot; Now we see that we are_on our own . We don ' t want revenge , but neither will we let those who left us at the Serbs ' mercy give_away our land and homes. &quot; Vows to press_on with the fighting that has already claimed 200 # 000 lives in Bosnia and 10 # 000 more in an earlier clash in Croatia raise the specter of an endless and expanding war . The aggression committed in Bosnia and Croatia could also inspire nationalist zealots elsewhere in the ethnic patchwork of Eastern Europe to resort_to brute force , taking the land and power they covet and facing little resistance in a passive world . &quot; There will be other Bosnias , &quot; Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic predicts with resignation . &quot; Unfortunately , this tragedy will happen again and again until the leaders of the world realize they must take risks when the principles of democracy are threatened. &quot; That the worst-case scenario of rapid historical change unfolded in placid Bosnia took the diplomatic world by surprise , but only because no one was watching . Yugoslavia , with its open borders , was communism ' s success story , if the ideology had one . Tito , who broke_with Moscow in 1948 and charted a unique course of development in Yugoslavia , followed his ideological cohorts in the quest_for economic progress through rapid industrialization , throwing_up power_plants , steelworks and munitions factories in the 1950s and 1960s . While many of the heavy industries were no more successful here than in other command economies , opportunities for family-run businesses and freedom to travel opened_up horizons that were unique in the Communist world . Tourists flowed in_for bargain beach vacations along the stunning Adriatic seacoast , often wandering up Bosnia ' s majestic Neretva River valley to take_in its succession of scenic jewels from medieval Orthodox monasteries to the Ottoman-era marble bridge at Mostar , all since destroyed . More important , Yugoslavs could go abroad themselves , and millions did . Young_men keen on building_up the family homestead worked for hard-currency wages in Western Europe , sending their earnings back home where they were to be plowed into sprawling houses or used to start hotels and restaurants . The remissions maintained a prosperity that enhanced Tito ' s drive to stamp_out the virulent nationalism that separated Yugoslav peoples during World_War_II . But in his advancing years , the flagging industrial output that afflicted much of the Communist world in the 1970s prompted Tito to borrow heavily from banks and governments in the West , mortgaging the economic future of the federation . By the time of his death in 1980 , Yugoslavia was already suffering the ravages of inflation . As the years progressed and no successor emerged who was as committed as Tito to a strong federation , the complex leadership formula he had devised to keep each ethnic_group ' s power in check began to unravel at the hands of self-interested nationalists . Milosevic rose to become head of the Serbian republic ' s Communist_Party in 1987 on a campaign to reassert Serbian supremacy over the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo province . He then maneuvered nationalist allies into positions in the federal structure until he reached the point where he could dismantle it from within . As the Serbian nationalists who controlled the collective purse_strings funneled up_to 70 % of the federal budget to preparations for war , secessionist movements took_hold in Slovenia , where the most affluent Yugoslavs feared economic disaster , and in Croatia , where nationalist sentiments flared to meet the Serbian challenge from Belgrade . The war in Bosnia has been a battle for territorial superiority between small groups of aggressive Serbs and Croats in the rival countries that flank this republic . But that the blame for their suffering probably lies elsewhere is no comfort for the victims of the most dramatic historical change in the last_half a century .</TEXT>
