   <HEADLINE> COUNTERPUNCH : IF FILM ' S WORTH SEEING -- we ' ll COME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So the executives in Hollywood are now blaming the moviegoing public for their poor performances at the box_office ( &quot; A Squeeze_Play Tags the Summer Box_Office , &quot; Calendar , Aug . 2 ) . I just won ' t accept that excuse . Paramount chairman Sherry Lansing says : &quot; There was only room for the home_runs this summer . Audiences rejected everything else. &quot; Producer Jerry Bruckheimer says : &quot; Viewers seem to be returning time and again to their favorite films and have no interest in other releases. &quot; Do they believe that a viewer would rather see &quot; Lion King &quot; three times than view the Disney film once and then take_in two smaller films ? If you make a good film , we will come . ( However , good doesn ' t necessarily mean expensive . We will stay_away_from big films too . Remember &quot; Days of Thunder &quot; ? ) As a screenwriter , I have learned that a good film has two characteristics necessary for broad-based appeal : empathy for the main characters and plausibility for the particular circumstances they are in . If these two criteria were adhered to more closely , there would n ' t be as_many flops . Rob Reiner has his first flop with &quot; North. &quot; Why ? Obviously few moviegoers in middle America had the desire to get a new set of parents , as Reiner ' s main character did . It wasn ' t plausible . The result ? Poor box_office . As for the other busts of summer : Paramount ' s &quot; Beverly Hills Cop III &quot; failed because no one wanted to see Eddie Murphy and Bronson Pinchot in that same old shtick a third time . &quot; Baby ' s Day Out &quot; is a rehash of a tried_and_true John Hughes formula that is totally implausible and plain worn_out . Disney tried to get us with &quot; I Love Trouble , &quot; a love_story about two reporters . Do you love trouble ? I could not empathize with these two characters . No one else did either . &quot; Renaissance_Man &quot; had a business_executive coming_to the aid of the Army . I just don ' t believe it . &quot; City_Slickers II &quot; : While the original film had a very good premise concerning a man in a midlife crisis , the second has this same guy , who now has a cow for a friend , and he ' s going_off to discover a lost gold mine . Maybe I ' ll see it on video . Wasn ' t &quot; The Cowboy Way &quot; originally titled &quot; McCloud &quot; ? By any name , it just would n ' t happen . &quot; Little Big League &quot; and &quot; Angels in the Outfield &quot; are formulaic baseball fantasy films , forcing us to relate to unempathetic spoiled kids . I can remember back before &quot; Bull Durham &quot; when Hollywood execs said you can ' t make a successful baseball movie . Now we know you can , if you have the right story to tell . &quot; Wyatt Earp &quot; has only grossed about $ 24 million to date . Why ? Because moviegoers have already seen the story -- in &quot; Tombstone. &quot; How much has &quot; Tombstone &quot; made ? I think you need to combine the box_office of these two films to get an accurate take_on their popularity . As for the winners ? They all had fresh , original plots with empathetic characters and enough plausibility to make them intriguing . Other films from other seasons bear_out the &quot; magic &quot; of this formula . The reason Steven Spielberg has been so successful is his radical divergence from the tried and true . &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; was the first dinosaur movie in 20 years . Even a film with as dark a subject_matter as &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; scored big , not because of its budget or director but because of its empathy and plausibility . &quot; Indecent Proposal &quot; proved that it doesn ' t matter when a picture is released as long as the story is good . And so on . If Hollywood seriously thinks that mid-range pictures can ' t possibly compete with big-budget films , I wonder why Disney would spend so_much to acquire a company like Miramax Films , which has only been known for its success with smaller pictures . Quality product , fresh ideas and believable stories -- not somebody ' s track record -- are what make_good films . If there were 10 good smaller-budget pictures out this summer , as opposed to one &quot; True Lies &quot; mega-budget film , I would bet the returns at the box_office would be comparable . What audiences won ' t sit still for is an industry that keeps raising ticket prices and then expects people to sit through banal films that have the exact same plot as half_a_dozen other movies . Barry Reardon , Warner Bros. ' distribution chief , says there will be a lot of pictures this summer that will lose money . If the studios refuse to concentrate_on quality product and go_on giving green_lights to pet producers with ridiculous projects , just for the sake of making them happy , then yes , there will continue to be a lot of losers . But then , that ' s Hollywood !</TEXT>
