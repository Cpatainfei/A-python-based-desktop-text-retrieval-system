   <HEADLINE> GOVERNOR REJECTS TAX_BREAK BILL FOR EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Governor Pete Wilson on Friday vetoed a bill that would have provided an additional tax_break to victims of the Northridge earthquake . The bill would have allowed taxpayers to deduct all uninsured quake losses of more_than $ 100 from state taxable income . Supporters of the bill said this would have provided as much as a 22 % state tax cut for some quake victims . Currently , such deductions are limited to the amount over 10 % of the taxpayer ' s adjusted gross income . &quot; The state has already provided tax relief to earthquake victims in the amount of $ 300 million in income_tax relief and a substantial amount in property_tax relief , &quot; Wilson said in his veto message . &quot; While I am sympathetic to the financial hardship incurred by victims of the earthquake , this bill would offer only illusory relief . &quot; At a minimum , this bill is premature , and would excite false expectations. &quot; Wilson earlier this year signed legislation that would allow quake victims to deduct losses from their income on tax_returns spread_out over the next five years . The governor also issued executive orders allowing property_taxes to be assessed on the lower , post-earthquake value of damaged property . But the bill vetoed Friday , sponsored by state_senator Herschel Rosenthal ( D-Los Angeles ) , would have eliminated limits on the amount of losses that could be deducted . &quot; Wilson ' s action is a terrible blow to taxpayers in the San Fernando Valley and other areas that have suffered losses as a result of this quake , &quot; said Rosenthal in a news release issued after the veto . The state_senator said the veto could affect a vote on a similar federal bill now pending . &quot; His veto has essentially made_it impossible for the federal companion bill to pass , &quot; Rosenthal said in the release . &quot; Why would a congressman from Minnesota care about California when California ' s own governor doesn ' t think that this tax_break is important ? &quot; Dan Flynn , an aide to Rosenthal , said the legislator would reintroduce the bill next year .</TEXT>
