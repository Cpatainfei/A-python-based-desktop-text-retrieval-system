   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; HAITIAN AMERICAN TROOPS PART OF EVOLVING POLITICAL THRUST ; OCCUPATION : CREATION OF SPECIAL TEAM IS ONE EXAMPLE OF A NEW APPROACH TO WIN CIVILIANS ' HEARTS AND MINDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As part of a small U.S. Army patrol outside the airport here , Marine Sgt . Roland J . Daniel talked and laughed with the throng of Haitians staring Wednesday at the huge military buildup across the street . But a shock rippled through the crowd whenever Daniel spoke , for as the Haitians observed , here was a Haitian American who had come_home . Daniel carefully translated the Haitians ' comments from Creole into English for Sgt . Charles Crouch of the Army ' s 10th Mountain Division . Crouch was leading a special unit to gauge the mood of the Haitian people , and he listened quietly as Daniel described the reaction to American occupation . &quot; It makes a big difference to have a translator with us out here , &quot; Crouch said , as the crowd closed_in around Daniel , who was flown in from Okinawa to help the Army as it struggles to figure_out what is going_on in this capital ' s streets . Watching as people mobbed Daniel , Crouch whispered : &quot; Hearts and minds , hearts and minds. &quot; After Tuesday ' s violence between Haitian police and demonstrators -- conflict witnessed by U.S. troops , who did not intervene -- Crouch ' s mission to make friendly contact with ordinary Haitians gained new urgency . Virtually all U.S. troops here were kept isolated Wednesday from Haitians . But for American personnel here -- even enlisted men -- it is growing clearer that the U.S. operation in Haiti has quickly become more political and humanitarian than military . And for many U.S. soldiers here , that kind of mission -- including the possibility of intractable civil strife -- brought_back troubled images of Somalia . But officers here and back home insist that American forces this time are_better prepared than ever before for the political and social aspects of a U.S. involvement in a troubled land . They stress that in planning for the Haiti mission , they studied the Somalia intervention and hope to avoid the mistakes they believe U.S. forces made there . Above all , the Americans said they want to avoid another situation where the initial enthusiasm for a U.S. force turns_to bitterness , antagonism and violence . &quot; I think , in this instance , we have come_closest to welding governmental power from all branches of the government , the military , the State_Department . . . , &quot; said one Army planner . &quot; This is the first time I ' ve seen us do_it as a team , rather than have the military go_off and do its thing and the State_Department go_off on its own. &quot; The creation of a team of Creole-speaking , Haitian American soldiers -- recruited from across the U.S. military -- is just one example of the new approach . Senior officers here said the Pentagon combed personnel files and selected hundreds of active-duty military_personnel of Haitian ancestry to be translators and mediators and to tackle other assignments all across Haiti . &quot; Our duties are not really defined . We were just attached_to the unit , &quot; said Army Lt . Rodrique Alexandre , a Haitian native who came_to the United States 13 years ago and was brought_in from Germany to work with the Army ' s 519th Military Intelligence Unit . &quot; Our motto with this operation is Semper Gumby -- always flexible , &quot; stressed one officer . Besides the special corps of Haitian Americans , the Pentagon also will soon dispatch a force of civil affairs specialists , largely reservists . Army officials said they hope to deploy 159 such personnel to help minimize civilian interference with U.S. military operations and to keep key roads open_to U.S. troops . U.S. troops will not set_up feeding programs for the Haitians , but the civil affairs experts will coordinate such international aid efforts with private groups . Ultimately , these experts will help in &quot; nation-building &quot; -- a vital task that many Army_officers feel was neglected in Somalia . The civil affairs experts will fan_out across Haiti , officials said , to determine the condition of government services ; assess and repair roads and utilities , and work_on other parts of rebuilding this shattered country . Still , even as they tackle this difficult job , the Americans will limit their activity so they can avoid creating excessive expectations among Haitians , hopes that cannot be fulfilled after the much-promised , speedy withdrawal of U.S. forces , Army officials said . As for the Haitian American soldiers who have been recruited to work here , they said there is almost a surreal quality to their return . They said they strongly support the American intervention and believe that , while the return of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will not solve Haiti ' s problems , it will be an improvement over the military dictatorship . &quot; The people I talk to are scared , and they want to know how long we are going_to stay to help them , &quot; Daniel said . But for Haitian American soldiers , personal concerns weigh almost as heavily on their minds as the larger political issues . And those concerns tell much about conditions here . Daniel , for instance , said he won ' t contact relatives , some of whom live just a_few miles from the U.S. base at the airport ; he fears that if other Haitians know of their connection to him , his relatives may face retribution after U.S. troops leave . &quot; You know , &quot; Daniel observed , looking past the concertina wire surrounding the airport at the crowd of Haitians , &quot; I was in Saudi_Arabia and I was in Somalia to help people . So I figured , ' Why not help_out here too ? ' But even though this used to be my home , I always remember that I ' m on one side of the wire and they are_on the other , and that wire is there for the security of me and my people wearing green. &quot;</TEXT>
