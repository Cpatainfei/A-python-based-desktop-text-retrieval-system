   <HEADLINE> HAITI REFUGEE SURGE STRAINS U.S. FACILITIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Encouraged by reports of more lenient treatment by U.S. immigration officers , nearly 3 # 000 Haitian refugees have set sail in recent days for the United States , swamping the ship-borne processing arrangement that the Clinton_Administration set_up to handle a much smaller number . In response , President Clinton ordered the reopening of a refugee center at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba to cope_with the unexpected surge of Haitians . The Coast Guard said it picked_up 1 # 486 Haitians on the high_seas Monday , the highest one-day total yet recorded , and 786 over the weekend . Coast Guard crews intercepted at least 20 more refugee boats Tuesday and picked_up at least 612 more emigrants -- &quot; but we ' re still counting , &quot; spokesman Jack O ' Dell said . The four-day total of at least 2 # 884 was more_than the number of Haitian refugees intercepted in all_of 1993 . The increase in refugees took U.S. officials by surprise and prompted President Clinton to convene an emergency meeting to find ways to handle the problem . The President , as he has done on many previous occasions , appealed_to Haitians to remain in their country while applying for asylum . &quot; I would note that the safest and best thing . . . to do is to apply at the in-country processing center , &quot; he said . &quot; There has been a significant increase in refugees , perhaps as a result of political repression in Haiti and perhaps ( because of ) anxiety over tougher sanctions. &quot; But other officials said a more immediate cause appeared to be reports sweeping Haiti that U.S. officials are under orders to grant political asylum to more refugees than before . Officials confirmed that the Immigration and Naturalization Service has been granting formal refugee status to a much higher percentage of Haitians than before Clinton revised his policies last month . But they said the change was not deliberate . A month ago , Clinton revamped his Haitian refugee policy -- changing its focus from returning Haitians forcibly to their homeland to setting_up three shipboard processing centers in Jamaica . But if the new policy has the unintended result of encouraging an even larger exodus than before , Clinton will suffer yet another embarrassment . State_Department spokesman Michael McCurry said that the proportion of Haitian applicants granted refugee status has soared as high as 40 % in recent weeks , compared with 5 % earlier this year . McCurry said part of the change probably is attributable to increased work by private human_rights groups that help Haitians apply for refugee status , which requires that an applicant prove &quot; a well-founded fear of persecution. &quot; Another factor , he said , is that the INS has focused_on processing &quot; those who have got_the_best case &quot; for refugee status , a practice that may inflate the percentage admitted . Richard L . Kenney , an INS spokesman , said the agency also may be approving more Haitian applications because of &quot; better training and better information about conditions on Haiti. &quot; Previously , human_rights groups had accused the INS of turning_down too many Haitians who had good cases for refugee status . But Kenney insisted there has been no general order to the INS to approve more Haitian applications . &quot; There has been no direction like that , &quot; he said . &quot; There are a lot of variables that go_into these numbers . . . . Asylum isn ' t a mathematical_process . It ' s a one-on-one process . Those percentages don ' t have anything to do with anyone ' s chances of being approved. &quot; Not all emigrants who are approved as refugees are admitted to the United States , he noted . The Administration has been seeking help from other countries in settling certified refugees . And the Coast Guard is still returning hundreds of Haitians to their homeland each week -- those who fail to convince INS officials that they are fleeing political persecution . Nevertheless , officials said , reports of the increased percentage approved for refugee status already have circulated around Haiti and appeared to be encouraging more people to flee . U.S. reporters in Haiti say emigrants are increasingly heading to sea in boats as small as 30 feet -- suggesting that they are not aiming to make the 700-mile voyage to Florida but merely are trying to get far enough for the Coast Guard to pick them up . The Coast Guard has 15 cutters and patrol_boats ferrying refugees to a U.S. Navy hospital_ship and two leased Ukrainian passenger liners anchored off Kingston , Jamaica . There , the refugees are interviewed by INS and U.N. officials . Jean-Bertrand Aristide , Haiti ' s exiled president , said he cannot ask his countrymen to stop fleeing while a military dictatorship rules . &quot; Given the escalating violence and repression , it would be immoral to ask people whose very lives are at risk to stay in Haiti , &quot; he said . Aristide , who has given conflicting statements in recent weeks over whether he would support U.S. military intervention to topple the military regime , refused to give a clear answer to the question Tuesday in a session at the National Press Club . &quot; Democracy must be restored , not through military intervention , but through the implementation of the ( 1992 ) Governor ' s Island agreement , &quot; under which the military agreed to step_down , he said . Asked about reports from Haiti that Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the military strongman , may retire from his post in October , opening the way for a possible compromise solution to the impasse , Aristide rejected the idea as &quot; a . . . maneuver to waste time. &quot; State_Department spokesman McCurry also dismissed rumors of Cedras ' retirement as &quot; singularly unimpressive. &quot; Clinton ' s special ambassador for the Haitian issue , former Rep . William H . Gray III , told a Senate subcommittee that the Administration believes stepped-up economic sanctions have had some effect in shaking the military regime . &quot; We are seeing signs of progress in the last four weeks , &quot; Gray told a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . &quot; There are clear signs of dissatisfaction in the military . There are clear signs among supporters of the coup ; some have even called_for the coup leadership to step_down . That has never happened before until we started tightening the sanctions. &quot; Gray said the Administration would continue tightening sanctions and indicated that the next step would be to cancel all non-immigrant U.S. visas now held by Haitian citizens . But if the sanctions fail , he warned , the Administration might turn_to military_action . &quot; Is the military option on the table ? Yes , it is , &quot; he said . &quot; Is there an imminent action about to be taken ? No , it is not . But that option is there on the table and we will assess the effect of sanctions each day , each week , to see if there is a change in the Haitian situation. &quot; Meanwhile , at the United Nations , U.S. diplomats introduced a resolution that called_for an expansion of the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Haiti &quot; after the departure of the senior Haitian military leadership. &quot; The resolution , discussed by the Security_Council in closed-door consultations , would ask Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to propose plans by July 15 for a force large enough to help &quot; assure order , &quot; provide security for democratic government officials and organize legislative elections . After the meeting , an ambassador said that some of his colleagues on the council were uneasy with the resolution because they did not know if the United States was , in_effect , asking them to authorize a U.N. follow-up operation to a possible U.S. invasion of Haiti . Times staff writer Stanley Meisler at the United Nations contributed to this report .</TEXT>
