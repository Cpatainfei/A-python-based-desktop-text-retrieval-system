   <HEADLINE> HERNANDEZ ASSOCIATE FACES JAIL ; COURTS : MORTGAGE BROKER SHAWN G . CASSIDY PLEADS GUILTY TO INCOME_TAX EVASION ARISING FROM PHONY COMMISSION SCHEME WITH SOCIALITE , WHO NOW IS SERVING 71-MONTH PRISON_TERM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Convicted socialite Danny Hernandez ' s criminal dealings have claimed a fresh victim : Shawn G . Cassidy , his mortgage broker . Cassidy and Hernandez struck a deal : Cassidy would lie to the Internal Revenue Service and say he paid Hernandez $ 257 # 000 in_commissions , so that Cassidy could deduct that amount from his taxable income and Hernandez could claim it as income . A former aide to Orange County supervisors Harriett M . Wieder and Roger R . Stanton , Cassidy pleaded guilty Monday in U.S. District Court to two counts of income_tax evasion and faces_up to 10 years in a federal prison and $ 500 # 000 in fines . In April , Hernandez received a 71-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to mail_fraud and money_laundering in connection with the theft of nearly $ 8 million from the Santa Fe Springs precious_metals company where he worked . His wife was sentenced to 16 months for her role in the scheme after pleading guilty to income_tax evasion . Both are still in prison . Cassidy , 35 , who was mortgage broker for the purchase of Hernandez ' s $ 1-million , 12-room house in Mission Viejo and for a second house Hernandez ' s parents bought_in Trabuco Canyon -- admitted in court Monday to income_tax evasion . He was not involved in the precious-metals theft . In tax_returns both men filed for 1990 and 1991 , Cassidy claimed he paid Hernandez the $ 257 # 000 in_commissions . It gave Hernandez a way to legitimize some of the exorbitant income he was making from the theft at his workplace . According to court papers , after meeting Hernandez and agreeing to list the phony commissions with the IRS , Cassidy reported his 1990 income as $ 80 # 389 and paid taxes of $ 26 # 239 . However , his real income was $ 157 # 442 and he owed taxes of $ 51 # 666 . His income in 1991 was reported as $ 52 # 934 and he paid taxes of $ 19 # 873 but he really made $ 246 # 838 and owed $ 78 # 922 in taxes . IRS investigators say he cheated the government out of nearly $ 85 # 000 in taxes , which he has since paid by filing amended tax_returns . In their investigation of Danny and Susie Hernandez , which began in 1991 , federal authorities scrutinizing the Hernandez family ' s tax_returns discovered the phony commissions . When they questioned Cassidy , he first said he had paid commissions to Hernandez for referring mortgage business to him . &quot; Then IRS agents said , ' Fine , then you must have the canceled checks for the commissions you paid him , ' and he said , ' You got me , ' &quot; said Assistant U.S. Atty . Stephen Wolfe . &quot; In all_of Danny ' s bank_accounts , we saw no trace of payments to Danny by Shawn Cassidy ' s company. &quot; Wolfe said that although Cassidy was confronted in November , 1992 , three months before the Hernandezes were arrested , his case is just now coming_to an end because Cassidy had agreed to cooperate in the government ' s case against Hernandez . * Cassidy , who lives_in Encinitas , is scheduled for sentencing on Oct . 31 . Wolfe said he is recommending probation because of Cassidy ' s ready admission that he committed the crimes and because he helped with the Hernandez investigation . Cassidy is vice_president and regional manager for TCS Mortgage in Mission Viejo . The company is based in San Diego . He has also worked for Bayshore Financial Corp . in Huntington Beach , where he was executive_vice_president and chief lending officer . His conviction means Cassidy will have to surrender his real_estate license , which is necessary to work as a mortgage broker . It is believed that he has not yet informed his employer of the crimes . Between July , 1981 , and April , 1984 , he worked as an executive aide for Wieder and Stanton before going_to work for World Savings &amp; Loan Assn . &quot; This is a simple case of Mr. Cassidy underreporting on his taxes , &quot; said Vincent J . La Barbera , Cassidy ' s attorney . &quot; He has paid his income taxes. &quot; Cassidy did not return a call_for comment . &quot; I think Mr. Cassidy is a decent guy who was tempted by Danny Hernandez , &quot; Wolfe said . &quot; This helped Hernandez try and cover his crime . The temptation he offered was greed , and Mr. Cassidy accepted . I think that ' s a shame. &quot;</TEXT>
