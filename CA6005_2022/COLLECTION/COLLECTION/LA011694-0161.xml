   <HEADLINE> DEATH_PENALTY REMAINS ALIVE AROUND WORLD , AROUSING STRONG PASSIONS ; PUNISHMENT : IN 1992 , 1 # 708 PRISONERS WERE EXECUTED IN 35 COUNTRIES , FOUR-FIFTHS OF THEM IN CHINA AND IRAN , ACCORDING TO AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China executed 1 # 079 prisoners in January last year , 62 of them in one day . In the first 4 1 / 2 months of 1993 , 40 prisoners , half of them convicted drug dealers , were publicly beheaded in Saudi_Arabia . A number of death sentences are carried_out in the United States every year . It is the only NATO nation besides Turkey that routinely executes criminals . The death_penalty remains very much alive around the world , arousing strong passions among both proponents and opponents . In 1992 , 1 # 708 prisoners were executed in 35 countries , four-fifths of them in China and Iran , according to Amnesty International , a London-based prisoners ' rights organization . The toll rose even higher in 1993 . &quot; And these are just the cases we know about , &quot; said Curt Goering , acting executive_director of Amnesty International U.S.A. &quot; The true extent is surely much greater. &quot; At the same time , however , six countries in the last three years have joined the growing list of those that have abolished or limited capital_punishment -- either in law or in practice -- bringing the total to 87 . That leaves 103 countries that use the death_penalty . The most recent executions are but the latest chapter in the age-old story of crimes and punishments . The Greeks killed messengers who brought bad news , and the Babylonians put_to_death persons who sold adulterated beer . Accidentally sitting on the king ' s throne was cause for execution in ancient Persia . Witchcraft , perjury , idolatry , adultery and man-stealing were among the offenses punished by death in the Massachusetts Bay Colony of the 1600s . Britain listed 350 capital crimes in 1780 . Iraq reportedly executed dozens of merchants in 1992 for price-gouging . For a long_time , executions were routinely carried_out in public . Transfixed onlookers watched prisoners impaled , stoned , burned at the stake , garroted and beheaded . Today the condemned generally are put_to_death with less fanfare . The most common methods of execution are firing squad , used in 86 countries , and hanging , in 76 . Seven countries still behead criminals , and seven stone them to death . Three supposedly more humane forms of killing prisoners -- electrocution , the gas_chamber and lethal injection -- have been introduced in the United States . The most notorious execution tool was the guillotine , which appeared during the_French Revolution as a replacement for the ax and sword . It was both less brutal and more democratic . Before its arrival , beheading was only for nobles ; commoners were hanged . The guillotine itself got the ax in 1981 , as France joined its Western European neighbors in ending or restricting the death_penalty . The first move_in that direction had occurred in 1863 , when Venezuela abolished capital_punishment . Venezuela was joined by about 15 other countries in the next century . The abolitionist movement has gained momentum in the last three decades . Robert Badinter , a former French minister of justice and a leader in the campaign against capital_punishment in his country , has observed : &quot; Paint in red the countries where the death_penalty is used and in white the countries that are liberated from it , and almost country by country you will see that the map of freedom and the map of abolition fit exactly together -- with a_few exceptions. &quot; The most notable exception is the United States , where 36 states have the death_penalty . Watt Espy , an Alabamian who has compiled a history of the death_penalty in the United States , said that he has documented 18 # 555 legal executions since the first one in Plymouth Colony in 1608 . He said the actual number may be as high as 25 # 000 . According to the Washington-based Death_Penalty Information Center , the peak period was the 1930s , when an average of 167 American executions were carried_out each year , with a record 199 in 1935 . Both the number of executions in the United States and public support for them started to decline after World_War_II . Court challenges led to a moratorium on executions , beginning in 1967 . In 1972 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges and juries had imposed death_penalties arbitrarily , in violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition on &quot; cruel and unusual punishment. &quot; Four years later the high_court clarified its guidelines , opening the way for executions to resume , and it subsequently overturned a number of legal obstacles once used to delay or block executions . Since then , 215 executions have taken_place in the United States , 186 of them in the South , according to the information center . If one of the more_than 2 # 700 inmates on U.S. Death Rows were executed every day between now and the end of the century , there would still be a backlog . Public_opinion in the United States has shifted during the last quarter-century . Recent surveys indicate that about 80 % of Americans favor the death sentence for murderers . The number drops substantially when alternatives , such_as life in prison without parole , are offered . Opposition appears to be stronger outside the United States . The European Parliament , the legislative_assembly of the European Community , has called_for action against capital_punishment . The newly organized , Italy-based international League for the Abolition of the Death_Penalty is working to end executions worldwide by 2000 . Once , the chief argument in favor of capital_punishment was deterrence . But studies of the deterrent effect have proved inconclusive , so the battleground has shifted to retribution . &quot; Some crimes are so utterly detestable that the death_penalty is the only means of providing victims and the public with the sense that justice has been fulfilled , &quot; said Carlos Zelaya of the Washington Legal Foundation , which supports capital_punishment . Amnesty International counters : &quot; Just as criminal codes do not sanction the raping of rapists or the burning of arsonists ' homes , still less is the deliberate taking of a life by the state an appropriate punishment for murder. &quot; In the case of capital_punishment , the jury is still out .</TEXT>
