   <HEADLINE> JIM MURRAY : LEGALIZED MAYHEM ON FIELD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since time_immemorial , sports fans and entrepreneurs have been a bloodthirsty lot . Witness the Christians and the lions . Nero was the promoter of that Super Bowl . Did you know that the earliest boxing matches were to the death ? Even as late as the turn_of_the_century , they fought till one man was knocked_out . No la-dee-dah split_decisions for those fisticuff sporting types . A round ended only when one guy was knocked_down . You never stopped a fight for something as wimpy as a cut eye or a three-knockdown rule . No doctor at ringside , just the coroner . Today , the sport of choice is pro football . Lots of blood and guts . Stretchers and ambulances on the ready . Only auto racing and ice_hockey approach it in mayhem . Basketball is getting rougher and rougher . Baseball is losing favor because nobody is losing_consciousness . The late Sam Goldwyn used to say , &quot; Anyone who goes_to a psychiatrist needs to have his head examined. &quot; Well , anybody who plays quarterback in the NFL today does too . Sam might say , &quot; Anybody who plays quarterback has a hole in his head. &quot; Or soon will . Take last Sunday : Reports show that Troy Aikman , Vinny Testaverde and Chris Miller all had to leave their games because of concussions . Now , &quot; concussion &quot; has a nice , euphemistic ring to it . &quot; Getting your bell rung , &quot; is a nice alternate description for it . The facts of the_matter are , any damage to the brain is no laughing matter . Brain_cells are irreplaceable . You can ' t put a splint on the brain . A nosebleed might not be serious . A brain bleed is . Perhaps you will recall Roger Staubach ' s retirement was hastened by repeated concussive blows to the head . And that Chicago Bear running back Merrill Hoge took early retirement last week after his doctor told him one more blow to the head could be fatal . A concussion is serious enough that the victim temporarily ( or hopefully temporarily ) has no clear idea who he is or where he ' s at . that ' s not a very encouraging indication . You will remember in the film , &quot; Requiem for a Heavyweight , &quot; the manager ( Jackie Gleason ) asks his fighter , Mountain Rivera , where he thinks he is and the fighter answers &quot; I ' m in Pittsburgh and it ' s raining. &quot; Fresco Thompson used to ask prospects , torn between a career in football or baseball , &quot; What do you want , kid ? A career -- or a limp ? &quot; Well , even a limp might be preferable to a permanent ringing in the ears . The problem is , football is a game of intimidation . And has to be taught as such . You may remember , many years ago , the league found one team had kind of an office pool where the money collected went_to the player who &quot; got &quot; the quarterback , i.e. , made him limp off or ride_off the field . It ' s interesting that Aikman left the field Sunday probably thinking he was in Pittsburgh and it was raining after a linebacker , Wilber Marshall , slammed him in the face and mouth with his helmet . Helmets today are plastic head_coverings that , like the iron hats of medieval knights , are designed to spare the brain . But they are also weapons . They were used for a tactic known as &quot; spearing &quot; in which the defensive player would launch his helmet , which was about the tensile_strength of a cannonball , into any vulnerable position of the guy with the ball . Coaching staffs didn ' t exactly teach it . Neither did they discourage it . But the league made_it illegal . They didn ' t want to bring body_bags into the game . The league has always defended itself from charges it was sponsoring legalized mayhem by pointing_out that the object in football was not to hurt but to score . In boxing the object is to hurt , maybe , unfortunately , to kill . In football , the idea was to score a touchdown . But sometimes , on the way to a touchdown , you had to destroy someone in your path . And to get a touchdown , first you had to get the ball . You did this by hitting the quarterback so hard you made him too fearful to be effective . It ' s interesting that the coach of the team that made Aikman , so to speak , forget himself is Buddy Ryan . Now , Ryan is probably the game ' s most enthusiastic advocate of what has come_to be known as &quot; smash-mouth football. &quot; I mean , Nero would have loved him . Ryan doesn ' t want you to die for dear old Siwash , he wants you to kill for dear old Siwash . Like General Patton , he believes_in letting the other poor slob die for his side . &quot; Motivation &quot; can sometimes be confused with what they call_in boxing , &quot; the killer instinct. &quot; The helmet is so lethal it should probably have a spike on top of it like the Kaiser ' s . What ' s to be done about it ? No one seems to know . They beefed_up scoring by shortening kickoffs and penalizing field_goals , but their real problem may be not to get more touchdowns but to get fewer concussions . Quarterbacks may be as defenseless as the Christians . Football_players , like dinosaurs and finned Cadillacs , may be getting too big for the environment . Getting smashed into by 300-pound , 6-foot-7 linemen is something less than humane , but the official party_line was voiced by linebacker Jack Lambert some years ago when protection for quarterbacks was first broached . &quot; Let ' em wear skirts , &quot; sneered Lambert . As if protecting the body ' s computer , the brain , was somehow unmanly . How many concussions is a Super Bowl worth ? Aikman has had three concussions and two Super Bowls . The price is not right . Sam Goldwyn was right . He needs to have his head examined .</TEXT>
