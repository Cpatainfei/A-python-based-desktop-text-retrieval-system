   <HEADLINE> IMPACT OF THE WEAK DOLLAR / THE TRAVELERS ' VIEW ; DOLLAR DESERTS TOURISTS ; AMERICANS ABROAD FEEL THE PINCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Saddled with dollars worth less than when they started their trips abroad , American tourists around the globe grumbled and tightened their belts -- but also expressed hope that their money would soon recover its lost value . Some tourists in Europe and Japan said they were giving_up fancy meals for McDonald ' s , cabs for subways and guided tours for guidebooks . A few were canceling side trips_out of the capitals . The shock was greatest in Japan , where the dollar hit a post-World War II low of 99.5 Japanese yen on Tuesday and recovered only slightly Wednesday . Generally , financial markets worldwide settled_down following their tumble earlier in the week . &quot; It ' s dramatically expensive . . . breathtaking , &quot; said Lynmar Brock Jr. , 60 , a tourist in Tokyo from Newtown Square , Pa . &quot; Horrendous , &quot; added his wife , Claudie . &quot; For breakfast this morning we spent $ 30 . And that only buys toast and juice. &quot; Economists had been predicting a strong dollar for this summer , based on expected growth in the U.S. and European economies . The economies indeed grew , but other factors intervened , such_as inflation fears in the United States , the U.S. trade conflict with Japan and concern that Germany would halt its slow drop_in interest_rates . So the dollar fell . Tourism industry leaders said Wednesday that it was too soon to tell whether the depreciation of the dollar will have a dramatic impact on Americans ' travel . Most long-distance vacations are planned and paid_for far in_advance , and a spot check of hotels in Paris and Rome showed no trend toward cancellations by Americans . Travel_agents in Southern California agreed . &quot; People haven ' t shown any concern about it , &quot; said Nina DeCampos , manager of the Carlson Travel Network office in Woodland Hills . In fact , she said , two couples walked into the office Wednesday afternoon to make final_payments on their European vacations . &quot; I think the client has become accustomed to the dollar not being real strong , &quot; said Ada Brown , who owns Seaside Travel in Long_Beach . Economic conditions -- not the value of the dollar -- play a greater role in consumers ' travel_plans , she said . Prepaid tours and low air fares have also taken some of the sting out of the declining dollar , travel_agent Kathy Traynor said . Round-trip tickets to Europe , for example , are less than $ 600 through airline ticket wholesalers , and hotels are still offering discounts . &quot; You can do Europe almost more cheaply than you can do a United States tour package , &quot; said Traynor , who manages the Associated Travel office in Monrovia . Indeed , many American travelers already overseas have taken the dollar ' s dive in stride . If you ' re shelling_out a_couple_of grand for a European trip , what ' s a_couple_of hundred more , they reason . that ' s what vacations -- and credit_cards -- are for . In London , where the dollar has dropped only about 3 % against the pound in the past week , Lewis and Dorothy Ross of Tampa , Fla. , paused outside Harrods department_store in the chic Knightsbridge shopping district . &quot; I wish the dollar would rise and not sink , &quot; Lewis said , &quot; but . . . we ' ll think_about the cost when we get home. &quot; But Christie Rothenberger and her friend Kelly Thomas , younger tourists from Texas , were holding_back on spending . &quot; We wanted to go_to English pubs and eat traditional English food , which is expensive enough in London anyway , but with the exchange_rate being so bad we ' ve had to stick_to fast food , &quot; Rothenberger said . Workers at some European money exchange houses were matter-of-fact . &quot; We ' ve had these oscillations before , &quot; said a Rome money_changer . &quot; It simply means the dollar will stay down , probably for the rest of the week , then recuperate . This is not a big slump but a minor drop. &quot; Still , Americans who managed to change money before the dollar fell felt_like winners . Outside a cafe near Paris ' Madeleine church , Rancho Santa Fe liquor importer Sidney Frank said he and his wife had just paid $ 35 for two coffees , a pair of croissants and an Evian water . But the 74-year-old was sitting pretty in his plaid jacket and bow_tie . &quot; Luckily , I bought enough D-marks to last for 18 months a_few months ago , &quot; Frank said . &quot; If I bought them today , it would have cost me at least $ 1.5 million more. &quot; He had also laid_in a year ' s supply of French brandy . A weak dollar helps American exports and makes imports more expensive . Foreigners find it cheaper to buy dollars , so travel_to the United States is less expensive for them . The rising value of the German mark was good news , for example , to Hans Becker , a German tourist amid the World Cup hubbub in Pasadena who was planning to exchange currency Thursday morning . &quot; This trip was expensive , &quot; he said . &quot; I will take any help I can get. &quot; In Europe , one of those celebrating the dollar ' s decline was Gerd Lindenau , director of the German branch of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration . &quot; Thank heavens , &quot; Lindenau said with a laugh . &quot; I guess I ' m the only positive thing around . But a weak dollar spurs tourism to the United States . The trend in tourism out of Germany to the U.S. has been double-digit growth for the last five years , and we see a much greater potential in the future. &quot; The exchange_rate changes , however , cut against Lindenau ' s personal interests as an American who earns dollars and lives in Germany . &quot; Ah , personally I ' m a poor_man , but we take it on the chin , &quot; he said . &quot; The fluctuation is almost daily , and in three months or a year it will be a different story . I can remember a 4.20-mark dollar in the early ' 60s and a 1.42-mark dollar 22 months ago. &quot; On Wednesday , the dollar bought 1.605 marks in Germany , up from 1.594 marks a day earlier . In Tokyo , however , many Americans could not afford to take the news so well . After paying $ 20 for a ham and cheese sandwich , 30-year-old NASA engineer Doug Govan of Cocoa Beach , Fla. , decided against a trip_out of Tokyo to Kyoto . &quot; I was caught a little off_guard . I was expecting 110 yen for the dollar or better . When I got_off at the airport , it was 98 yen , &quot; Govan said . At his hotel , he was able to get 100 yen per dollar for traveler ' s checks . &quot; It ' s a learning experience , &quot; Govan said . UCLA biochemistry student Khoi Le , who arrived in Japan last April for a semester-abroad program at Meiji Gakuin in Yokohama , said he is eating more often at McDonald ' s to save money . But even burgers are twice as expensive as in the United States . &quot; We try to stay_on the high-carbohydrate ( diet ) , &quot; he said . &quot; More bang for the buck. &quot; * Miller reported from Bonn .
