   <HEADLINE> POLITICAL FORECAST ; WILL HAITI ' S MILITARY RULER STILL BE IN THE COUNTRY ON OCTOBER 15 ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Will Haiti ' s Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , who has ruled his country for three years , leave by the Oct . 15 deadline established in the Carter agreement ? The Times asked eight experts on Haiti . Robert E . White , President of the Center for International Policy Cedras will leave at noon , Oct . 14 . It ' s almost impossible for the Parliament to gather , debate and pass a far-ranging amnesty . I doubt we will be pushing to get the Parliament to act when it suits our interests that Cedras leave , and the surest way to get him to leave is to make_sure that he is subject_to arrest Oct . 15 . * Mark Falcoff , Resident scholar and Latin_American specialist , American Enterprise Institute . I don ' t believe Cedras will leave . It ' s no accident that the agreement does not require his departure . He would have never signed it ( otherwise ) . I would guess that he will stay and not be arrested . There ' s not much possibility he ' ll have a major political career , but he ' ll be around to make life unpleasant . * Ernest H . Preeg , Former U.S. ambassador to Haiti during the Reagan_Administration . It ' s unclear , but I don ' t think it will make much difference . Legally , Cedras doesn ' t have to go , but will he fear for his safety ? I presume he will . The Administration has turned_back from a Carter-oriented approach of reconciliation . The way it has been going_in the field , the pro-Aristide people are the good_guys and the anti-Aristide are the bad_guys . I don ' t want to overplay the importance of ( Cedras ) . The real question is : Will the army and police disintegrate in Port-au-Prince as they have in Cap Haitien . * Jean Jean-Pierre , Commentator , Radio for Peace International , and consultant on Haiti Cedras will leave Haiti if there is political amnesty instead of the general amnesty that was promised by Jimmy_Carter . If the Parliament approves an amnesty that goes beyond the political , which is authorized by the constitution , this will be a recipe for disaster , because all_the people who were raped or whose families were tortured will not have any recourse except their own justice . * Marian E . Douglas , Former member of the Organization of American States-United Nations human- rights mission in Haiti It could happen within the next few weeks , because of the pressure applied from inside Haiti and from the international community , the United States , particularly . * Robert W . Gaskin , Vice-president for policy , Business_Executives for National Security , and former military strategist Why would he leave ? He ' s going_to be granted amnesty . The Parliament is more prone to side with Cedras than ( Jean-Bertrand ) Aristide . They have a bad taste in their mouth from Aristide ; that ' s what started the coup * Ian Martin , Senior associate , Carnegie Endowment for International Peace I think its quite possible that Cedras will leave before the 15th of October . That can happen in one of two ways : 1 ) within the Carter agreement , if Parliament passes some kind of amnesty law , but not one satisfactory to Cedras ; 2 ) the United States could find it necessary that constitutional authority needs to be rapidly restored ( and bring Aristide back ) before the 15th . In either of these situations , it will be necessary for Cedras to leave , because the situation is simply not viable for him . A great majority of the population holds him responsible_for human-rights violations since the coup . * Dessima M . Williams , Professor of sociology , Brandeis University , and former Grenadian ambassador to the Organization of American_States The more important issue is whether Cedras is willing to play a role in reducing military_control over Haitian life , whether or not the Haitian state is able to hold him accountable and what kind of process of accountability and reconciliation Haitian society wants to pursue : trials , amnesty or a truth commission that would assess human-rights abuses . Whether Cedras will be in Haiti to be held accountable will depend_on what ( type of amnesty ) Parliament can agree on .</TEXT>
