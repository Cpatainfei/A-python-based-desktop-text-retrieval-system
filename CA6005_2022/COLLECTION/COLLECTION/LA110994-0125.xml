   <TEXT> Ever since Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming stumbled on penicillin in 1929 , drug development has been more serendipity than science . Researchers at_large pharmaceutical companies screen thousands of compounds in trial-and-error &quot; grind and find &quot; tests before finally hitting on a promising drug -- typically spending $ 400 million and 12 years in the process . Biotechnology was supposed to change all that with breakthrough techniques such_as genetic_engineering . But while a_few early pioneers such_as Genentech and Amgen have struck it rich by &quot; picking the low cherries on the tree , &quot; in the words of one scientist , broader progress has been slow : Though there are about 520 biotech companies in the United States , only 26 biotech drugs are in commercial use . Now many researchers and biotech industry watchers are pinning their hopes on a new set of drug development techniques that exploit cutting-edge computer methods and advanced robotics technology . By combining the ability of computers to analyze and model reams of data with robots ' precision handling and cutting abilities , these methods could radically reduce the amount_of_time and money it takes_to develop new drugs -- to the benefit of the sick and biotech investors alike . &quot; You can often make breakthroughs by marrying two separate technologies , &quot; says Ken Lee , national director of the life_sciences practice at accounting_firm Ernst &amp; Young and co-author of an annual report on biotechnology . &quot; that ' s what ' s happening with high-powered computing and biotech . Something great is going_to happen. &quot; There are no guarantees , of course : None of these technology-savvy companies have approved drugs to validate their approach , and some analysts say they lack the broad expertise in pharmaceuticals needed to produce effective drugs . But the techno-drug companies have been producing an impressive number of drug candidates for human clinical trials , often in record time . The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center will soon begin the trial of an anti-cancer drug that BioNumerik Pharmaceutical of San Antonio developed in just 18 months using supercomputers . Agouron , a San Diego drug_company , is now testing two anti-cancer drugs and a possible treatment for AIDS . Arris Pharmaceuticals , a South San Francisco-based company , is testing a drug for asthma . And even if the current purveyors of the new approach to drug making don ' t survive , few question that the technology they are developing will become part of the mainstream , accelerating drug development in companies large and small and transforming a stream of new discoveries about man ' s genetic makeup into useful drugs . * &quot; A hundred years in the future , everybody will be ' genotyped ' and you will design drugs on demand fitted to that person ' s target protein , &quot; says David Galas , vice_president for research at Darwin Molecular Sciences , a start-up company backed by Microsoft Corp . Chairman Bill Gates . The firm plans to combine advanced robotics with high-speed computers to sequence genes and find new ways to tackle such treatment-resistant diseases as cancer , AIDS and multiple_sclerosis . While there are many different approaches to computer-driven drug development , the broad goal is typically the same . First , the objective is to find a protein , or &quot; receptor , &quot; that plays a key role in a disease . Once a receptor is found , the task is then to find a compound that will attach itself to the receptor and either disable the receptor if it has harmful functions or activate it if it has a positive role . Think_of the receptor as the lock that must be opened or closed for treatment and the drug as the key that must be found . But though their goals are similar , the various companies are tackling the problem in radically different ways . Agouron ' s method , called rational drug design , is to create new compounds &quot; atom by atom. &quot; When Agouron set_out to find a compound to disable the HIV protease , a piece of the AIDS virus that ' s involved in replication , it began by cloning the protein and turning it into a crystal structure . By bombarding the crystal with X-rays and recording the way in which the rays are deflected -- a process called protein X-ray crystallography -- company researchers created a three-dimensional image of the HIV protease . The image was then used to design on computer a new compound that would fit neatly into the protein , like a plug into a socket . &quot; We designed a molecule you couldn ' t come_upon in any other way , &quot; says Peter Johnson , Agouron ' s chief_executive_officer . &quot; These are things that don ' t occur in nature. &quot; A frequent criticism of rational drug design is its failure to recognize that compounds and their targets change_shape under different conditions , which means the computer model sometimes bears little resemblance to reality . And X-ray crystallography doesn ' t work_on the many proteins that cannot easily be converted to a crystal structure . * Arris has tackled the problem by using pattern recognition , an approach to sorting visual information first developed by the military to help guide missiles to their targets . Arris uses the technology to find common patterns among the thousands of compounds known to make effective drugs . For example , the system might suggest that compounds with a tower sticking_up on the right , a certain electrical charge on the side and a flat , greasy surface on top will link with a particular receptor , says Michael Ross , chief technology officer . The new drugs are then designed , tested for effectiveness against computer models and further refined in continuing cycles . &quot; It offers completely new insights , &quot; Ross says . &quot; It is the breakthrough knowledge that is the most important. &quot; Critics say rational drug design has limited applications because it requires a huge amount of information about the molecule being studied . Such information isn ' t available for most drug targets . So another group of companies has taken an opposite tack , sometimes referred to as &quot; irrational drug design. &quot; They use databases of thousands or even millions of different compounds -- plants , animals and synthetically produced materials -- in conjunction with a range of computer techniques to separate_out those compounds that have_the_best chance of attaching themselves to the target receptor . Affymax Research Institute , a Palo Alto company , for example , has borrowed from semiconductor production methods to speed_up the old grind-and-find approach . The company builds_up layers of molecules on glass slides and covers them with a protective surface . Photolithography -- a mainstay of semiconductor making -- is then used to cut_away areas , each cut exposing a layer of molecules to which new compounds can be selectively added . * In this way , a tiny chip is created that has_on its surface 65 # 000 identifiably different but related compounds . The compounds can be tested simultaneously with a_few drops of fluid containing the target receptor . Those that bind give_off a fluorescent flash , which is picked_up by a laser and recorded by a computer as promising compounds . The results are offered to large corporate partners for further development . BioNumerik of San Antonio has built computer models based on fundamental tenets of pharmacology , chemistry and biology to try to predict how molecules of a given structure are likely to react . To process its lengthy equations , which are based on quantum mechanics , the company uses supercomputers and is working with computer makers to custom design computers dedicated for the purpose . &quot; The computers are strategic for us , &quot; says Frederick Hausheer , BioNumerik ' s founder and CEO . &quot; We don ' t have to do much testing in the lab. &quot; Yet another group of biotech companies are taking_advantage of research coming_out of the 15-year , $ 3-billion Human Genome Project but to tackle a different part of the equation . Instead of focusing their efforts on finding new compounds , they are looking_for new drug targets . &quot; Over the next five to 10 years , almost all new drugs will be used against targets not yet discovered , &quot; says Galas of Darwin , a molecular biologist who helped oversee the Human Genome Project while at the Department_of_Energy . Darwin plans to develop a high-speed robotic production_line that will analyze gene fragments at rates 100 to 1 # 000 times faster than is possible using current methods . The process yields the sequence , or code , for each fragment , and the code is then fed into a computer and matched against thousands of known proteins . If the gene ' s code is similar to that of a protein known to be related to a disease , it may be a potential drug target . The approach of genome companies like Darwin is to find new doors to a disease that might be easier to unlock . Developing Drugs With Computers In the past , drugs were developed using lengthy trial-and-error methods sometimes known as &quot; grind and find. &quot; Now computer_technology is making new techniques available to speed the process . 1 . Identify new drug targets : Laboratory robots prepare and sequence fragments of genes believed to be responsible_for a medical condition . Scientists then search databases for proteins -- called receptors -- that are similar to the genes . The hope is to find drugs that will latch_on to a receptor and either disable it if its activity hurts the body or activate it if it helps . 2 . Find compounds with drug potential : High-powered computers , in combination with traditional chemistry techniques , are used to sift through thousands of compounds to winnow out those that can best attach themselves to the receptor . 3 . Custom-design drug candidates : a ) Artificial intelligence is used to find common characteristics of compounds that bind to the receptor . These characteristics are combined in a single compound to develop a drug candidate better able to bind to the receptor . b ) A clone of the receptor is crystallized and bombarded with X-rays to collect information about its structure . The information is fed into a computer to generate a model of the receptor . The model is used to design a molecule that can lock onto the receptor and activate or disable it . 4 . Computer modeling is used to determine how to change the molecular structure of the new drug candidate to increase potency and reduce side_effects .
