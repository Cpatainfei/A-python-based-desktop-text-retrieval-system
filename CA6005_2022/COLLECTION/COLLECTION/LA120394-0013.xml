   <HEADLINE> MIDDLE_EAST ; LEBANON ' S PALESTINIAN UNREST MIRRORS INFIGHTING IN GAZA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When clashes broke_out last month between Islamic militants and Palestinian police in the turbulent Gaza Strip , many feared the seeds of anarchy and -- most feared of all -- the outbreak of Palestinian civil_war . Yasser Arafat , chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization , moved quickly to quell the violence and establish a shaky cease-fire with the Islamic Resistance Movement , or Hamas . But days later , Palestinian fighting erupted in this southern Lebanese port city , home to Lebanon ' s largest and most turbulent Palestinian refugee camp , Ein al Hilwa . It had disturbing echoes of the violence in Gaza and a message for those who believed that Arafat ' s self-rule authority would bring peace to the Palestinians . It has not . The 60 # 000 Palestinians who call Ein al Hilwa ' s narrow streets and cramped housing home have little stake in the Palestinian Authority miles away in Gaza and the West_Bank town of Jericho . Most have no hope of returning to their Palestinian villages in Israel and the territories . Yet their factions closely mirror the Palestinian groups now struggling for supremacy in Gaza . And the recent violence that broke_out in Lebanon against Arafat ' s Fatah loyalists and Islamic rebels opposed to the peace with Israel was a clear sign that Syria is prepared to exercise its muscle among Palestinians in Lebanon to score points in the peace process , many analysts say . Syria , whose 40 # 000 troops in Lebanon make_it the only real power_broker in the small , war-ravaged nation , seemed to be sending a signal of its own when anti-Arafat rebels in Ein al Hilwa ordered Arafat ' s Fatah loyalists out of the area once and for all , diplomatic sources said . Although Syria has no troops in southern Lebanon , it is Damascus that calls the shots with the Lebanese army forces that surrounded Ein al Hilwa ; it is Damascus that hosts the bulk of the Palestinian opposition to Arafat . &quot; This fighting had one very prominent signature : Hafez al Assad ( the Syrian president ) , &quot; said one Middle Eastern diplomat in Egypt . &quot; He is a very smart man , and he demonstrated to everyone that he still holds the Palestinian card. &quot; The intra-Palestinian fighting in Lebanon coincided with a concerted media attack against Israel in Damascus this week as public despair over Syrian-Israeli peace talks heated_up on the eve of an expected visit to the region by Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . &quot; It goes without saying that the current Israeli position will never help the secretary_of_state to achieve anything that might mend the flaw that has afflicted the peace process or to scatter the climate of frustration that shrouds the process , &quot; Al-Thawra , the Syrian government-run daily , said Thursday . Ein al Hilwa has been the unhappy scene of intra-Palestinian fighting for years , most notably between pro-Arafat Fatah loyalists and the dissident , violent Abu Nidal faction . But serious trouble started brewing after the September , 1993 , signing of the peace accord between Israel and the PLO . Mounir Makdah , Arafat ' s erstwhile Fatah forces commander in Lebanon , then broke_away -- in opposition to the accord -- and formed his own opposition force . He has allied himself with the Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah , and his political outlook closely mirrors that of Hamas in Gaza . Thus , there was a sense of deja_vu to the clashes in Ein al Hilwa , which pitted Fatah loyalists against dissidents led by Makdah . Muslim fundamentalists from Islamic Jihad , Hamas and other Syrian-backed dissidents sided with Makdah in the fighting , which left 10 dead and at least 25 others wounded . Makdah , in an interview , said it is no wonder that Palestinians in Lebanon are disillusioned with the peace agreement Arafat signed with Israel . &quot; There are 4 million Palestinians outside Palestine . Arafat ' s signing left most of them without a solution , &quot; he said . Loyalty to Arafat persists , despite opposition to the peace_treaty , he said , because of the $ 450 # 000 a month in aid the PLO dispatches to Ein al Hilwa . &quot; Their stomachs support Arafat , &quot; Makdah said of Fatah loyalists . Times special correspondent Raschka was recently on assignment in Sidon , and staff writer Murphy reported from Cairo .</TEXT>
