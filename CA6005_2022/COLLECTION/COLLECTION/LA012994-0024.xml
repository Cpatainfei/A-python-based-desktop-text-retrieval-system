   <HEADLINE> RICK DU BROW : THE BEST PLAY OF FOOTBALL_SEASON IS FOX ' S ; TELEVISION : ITS BREATHTAKING $ 1.58-BILLION , FOUR-YEAR BID SEEMS CERTAIN TO HAVE A WIDE IMPACT BEYOND SPORTS . FOX HAS AN IMPORTANT NEW IDENTITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the television industry , the real Super Bowl this season isn ' t Sunday ' s Dallas-Buffalo confrontation . The real Super Bowl is already over -- at least for network programmers . It took_place when Fox Broadcasting swiped the weekly National Football Conference games from CBS with a breathtaking $ 1.58- billion , four-year bid -- a move that seems certain to have a wide impact on network and local TV competition , far beyond merely the sports arena . Among other things , CBS , in blowing its 38-year football trademark , lost some valuable weeks of lead-in protection for its prized prime-time asset -- the Sunday night tandem of &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; and &quot; Murder , She Wrote , &quot; the cornerstones of the network in ratings competition . On those weeks -- last Sunday , for instance -- the CBS football lead-in has given both shows an extra needed edge , a key factor at a time when ABC is suddenly challenging the No . 1 network for the top rung . If &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; and &quot; Murder , She Wrote &quot; continue to retain all or most of their audience after Fox begins its NFC football broadcasts , effective this fall , their reputations as two of the most awesomely successful series in TV history will only be enhanced -- and CBS will escape cheaply enough in the Sunday competition . * But Sunday prime_time often is the battleground for the biggest network audiences of the week , and Fox , with football , now has a lethal new weapon to help its own high-profile lineup , which includes &quot; Married . . . With Children &quot; and &quot; Martin. &quot; &quot; Obviously , football broadcasts on Sunday afternoon will provide us with a promotional platform and lead-in , the_likes_of which we ' ve never previously enjoyed , &quot; says Sandy Grushow , president of the Fox Entertainment Group . But Peter Tortorici , executive_vice_president of CBS Entertainment , counters that while he ' s &quot; not happy &quot; his network lost football , &quot; I would have been less happy at keeping it at the loss of $ 600 million . &quot; I won ' t try to say there ' s no impact . There are minor consequences . Everybody assumes that football is a lead-in to ' 60 Minutes ' every week , and it ' s not . And , after 25 years , the American public knows when and where to find ' 60 Minutes. ' On the perception level , people are saying this is big trouble . But on the reality level , it is what it is. &quot; The irony of Fox ' s coup , which includes the signing of announcers John Madden , Pat Summerall and Terry Bradshaw , is that the network borrowed a similar ploy that CBS used in the recent past to try to improve its future -- vastly overpaying for a sports franchise as a loss-leader in hopes it will profit the company in many other ways . When CBS paid more_than $ 1 billion for major_league baseball rights a_few years back , the move was -- and still is -- attacked as corporate stupidity . It became a much-ridiculed burden that put CBS in a deep financial hole . But , most important , it was a statement by a troubled network to its employees , advertisers and the TV industry that it intended to stay in business . In retrospect , it may well have been a major turning point in reversing the fortunes of CBS . For within a short time , the new sense of commitment helped lift CBS out of the ratings basement to the No . 1 network position it now is trying to claim for the third consecutive season . Fox ' s move_in buying_into pro football is surely less desperate than was CBS ' investment in baseball . The young Fox organization has done quite well and now has expanded to seven nights a week of prime_time , but it has highly visible shortcomings in key areas when matched against the Big Three networks . Among these are late-night programming -- where it has failed from Joan Rivers to Chevy Chase -- as well as the lack of a full-scale news operation and , of course , sports . * Now , with pro football , the sports area is immensely shored_up . In addition , it gives Fox an important new identity in the expanding world of TV channels -- where brand names and trademarks are crucial to make a network stand_out . What ' s more , Fox ' s owned and affiliated stations now have a highly visible and salable product -- pro football -- that can only strengthen them and make them more important in their markets . There is nothing more important that a network can give its stations to ensure loyalty . The Fox purchase of football thus was smart -- but also because of key problems at the network that were emerging . The Chevy Chase failure was a nightmare and an embarrassment . Fox programming , determinedly different under former boss Barry Diller , seemed more mainstream . ( Diller once looked_at ABC ' s &quot; Twin Peaks &quot; and said that it should have been_on Fox. ) Fox was , and is , often tasteless , but it thrived on walking a tightrope and , above all , being talked_about -- from &quot; The Simpsons &quot; to &quot; Married . . . With Children &quot; to &quot; In Living Color &quot; to &quot; Beverly Hills , 90210 &quot; to &quot; Cops &quot; to the old &quot; Tracey Ullman Show. &quot; It badly needed some new pizazz to push all_the big and small problems into the background . Football has given Fox that pizazz , although the network now suddenly is beginning to shed its old individuality -- for football is ultimate mainstream television . And Fox has been saying since last year that it now wants to appeal_to a slightly older audience in addition to its core of 18-to-34-year-old viewers . Fox is beginning to look more and more like a Big Three wanna-be -- the way the fledgling ABC network in the 1950s upset apple carts left and right until it became successful enough to measure_up to CBS and NBC . No wonder that ABC founder Leonard Goldenson saw parallels in the birth of that network and Fox . For viewers , the important thing is what Fox will do with football . It is foolish to think that it won ' t alter the presentation to cater to its younger audience . Madden , at least , symbolizes a certain sense of tradition . At the same time , he comes_on like a guy shot out of a cannon -- which may suit him perfectly for Fox . He is a genuine free-swinging , pop-off kind of guy , a TV natural . It ' s surprising someone didn ' t cast him in a sitcom remake of &quot; The Life of Riley &quot; years ago . He could play Homer Simpson . It would not be too shocking to see Madden in other programming besides football on Fox . In the end , the game ' s still the thing in football . But when Fox is bad , it plunges to depths unmatched at the Big Three . And the question is whether Fox , which also swiped the Emmy Awards show in 1987 and almost destroyed it , will try to jazz_up its football presentation to_the_point of alienating a loyal audience . Will we be longing for the quiet musings of Howard Cosell ? CBS , now on top , clearly had the willies about risking another financial debacle . So Fox has the ball . It will also have the Super Bowl in 1997 . We will know a lot about Fox ' s game_plan by then .</TEXT>
