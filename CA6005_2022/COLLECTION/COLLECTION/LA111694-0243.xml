   <HEADLINE> FORD IN TALKS TO SELL FRAMES FOR ELECTRIC_CAR PRODUCTION ; AUTOS : PLAN WITH CALIFORNIA FIRM COULD HELP THE COMPANY MEET THE STATE ' S 1998 NO-EMISSIONS DEADLINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the first such move among big auto_makers , Ford Motor Co . disclosed Tuesday that it is in talks to sell car frames without the engines to U.S. Electricar , a Santa Rosa , Calif.-based company that converts gasoline autos to electric_power . If adopted , the plan could help Ford , the nation ' s No . 2 auto_maker , meet all or part of California ' s 1998 deadline for electric_cars . A key attraction is that it could give Ford credit toward meeting the tough California mandate without having to invest heavily in an assembly_line to build its own electric_cars . At the same time , it would allow U.S. Electricar to sell cars at lower prices , because it would avoid the labor and other costs of removing conventional engines and drive trains before adding the electric_power . U.S. Electricar could also widen its market by selling cars that have the Ford name and warranty . &quot; Converters are very good at low-volume products that they can do quickly and maybe more efficiently than Ford can do , &quot; said Beth Ardisana , an alternative-fuels planning specialist at Ford . The collaboration would also allow Ford to better understand the market for electric_cars , she said . &quot; Other ( auto ) companies are looking_at this as an alternative , &quot; said Ted Morgan , chairman and chief_executive of U.S. Electricar . Morgan hopes that eventually a deal with Ford will drop his converted-car price from double that of gasoline models to just 30 % above standard price . While the cars may be cheaper for consumers , however , they would also have a more limited performance than the so-called ground-up vehicles , which are designed only to be electric . The agreement announced Tuesday calls_for Ford and U.S. Electricar to develop standards for electric_car conversions , quality-control methods , customer service agreements and warranties . The companies could adopt a final sales agreement by next summer , a Ford spokesman said . For the past 18 months , Ford has had a similar agreement with companies that convert Ford trucks to natural_gas . These F-series pickups are now on sale in Texas . As part of the larger state plan to curtail air_pollution submitted Tuesday to federal authorities , California has mandated that the seven auto_makers selling the most cars in California must make 2 % of their 1998 California cars free_of all air emissions -- almost certainly electric_cars -- with that increasing to 10 % by the year 2003 . Though U.S. Electricar would guarantee the electric components , the car would be sold under the Ford brand name , potentially expanding its market . Consumers would be more comfortable with the Ford brand name , while current federal and state rules prevent government fleets from buying cars not certified by such original manufacturers , Morgan noted . Ford ' s electric-vehicle program has so far focused_on the Ecostar , an adaptation of a small European delivery vehicle that has been plagued with development problems . Ford maintains that Ecostar development will continue . But one auto industry executive said that rather than invest further in the near term in another ground-up car , Ford ' s proposed plan could make financial sense at this point . &quot; For Ford , it might be the way to lose the least money initially , &quot; said the official , who declined to be named . &quot; The industry is searching around for the cheapest way to meet the mandate in the first few years , and the way to do_it is to not build ground-up vehicles , &quot; said Daniel Sperling , director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California , Davis . Indeed , Sperling now expects that the only ground-up electric_car offering the high performance of some current prototypes will be the GM Impact , a sporty two-seat car now being tested in Southern California . GM has not yet committed itself to meeting the mandate by selling the Impact , however , and a spokesman said Tuesday that the company is still &quot; looking_at every option. &quot; Chrysler Corp . does not plan to sell the engineless frames -- called gliders in the industry -- but expects to market an electric variation of its best-selling minivan .</TEXT>
