   <TEXT> Principal Stephen Martinez tiptoed into the Farragut Elementary School kindergarten classroom in Culver City , trying not to be noticed . It didn ' t work . Hearing him , the students -- whites , Latinos , African Americans and Asian Americans -- jumped up , faced Martinez , bowed deeply , and greeted him in a singsong chorus with &quot; Ohayo Gozaimasu Martinez Sensei . &quot; Martinez grinned , bowed , and replied &quot; Ohayo Gozaimasu. &quot; The formalities over , the children sat_back on the floor , cross-legged in rows marked by strips of colored tape on the rug . Red and blue construction_paper folded into shapes of birds and elephants , called origami , were pinned to a corkboard . On a wall nearby was a clock with Japanese Kanji characters instead of Arabic_numerals , and a photo of Japan ' s royal_family . Martinez sat_down to observe , and teacher Naomi Kawano resumed her lesson , reading aloud to her students in Japanese a tale about a dog and cat who become friends . The children sat in rapt attention , appearing to understand her every word . Farragut is one of about 150 elementary_schools nationwide that &quot; immerses &quot; children in foreign languages ranging from Spanish and French to Japanese and Korean . The idea , say educators , is to start teaching second languages to kids when they are eager 5-year-olds , not when they ' re 16 -- and less willing to learn . And rather than taking a single language class that meets for an hour a day , students in immersion programs actually do course work -- history , social studies , math -- in a second language . Such learning has taken_root on the Westside , which is served by three of the 45 school districts statewide that have language immersion programs . Culver City Unified launched the country ' s first Spanish immersion program in 1971 . Now the district has a K-5 Spanish immersion curriculum and a newly launched kindergarten through second-grade Japanese immersion program , which serve 300 students . Los Angeles Unified has three Korean and four Spanish immersion programs in elementary_schools , with one of the Spanish programs at Grand View Elementary in Mar Vista serving 146 students . Santa Monica / Malibu Unified offers K-8 Spanish immersion courses and next fall plans to add ninth-grade Spanish-language courses in physical_science , humanities and algebra to its foreign immersion track , which now serves 405 students . The rationale offered for such programs is that Americans must learn to communicate in other tongues in an era of growing economic and cultural interdependence . &quot; We ' re deficient in our collective knowledge of other languages and other cultures , &quot; said Russell Campbell , a professor of linguistics at UCLA who helped design Culver City ' s program 23 years ago . Language immersion , he says , produces &quot; kids who can use other languages in the real_world , and who can be a benefit to society. &quot; Immersion usually begins in kindergarten . In the early grades students are taught almost exclusively in a second language so that by second and third grade they are reading and writing in it . In the Culver City and Santa Monica programs only 20 minutes a day is spent on English instruction in kindergarten , but that amount increases as students progress_to higher grades . Fourth- and fifth-graders at El Rincon Elementary in Culver City and Edison Elementary in Santa Monica spend half their school_day learning in Spanish and half in English . Culver City students who make_it through the K-5 Spanish immersion curriculum can go_on to take a Spanish language arts course in middle_school and an advanced Spanish language course at Culver City High . Young children , though generally less inhibited than older students when learning a second language , still face hurdles in mastering another tongue . Learning to write the complicated Kanji alphabet -- one of three Japanese alphabets -- poses a special challenge . &quot; ( It ' s ) a meticulous process , &quot; said Kawano . &quot; Their motor skills are not as developed yet , so they go_through a process of repetition. &quot; But immersion veterans say their intensive early instruction made learning in another language far easier in higher grades . Ayanna Bledsoe , an eighth-grader at John Adams Middle_School in Santa Monica , says one of her toughest assignments recently was &quot; no big deal , &quot; thanks to the earlier immersion courses she took as a youngster . &quot; We had to read ' Don Quixote , ' in Spanish , &quot; said Bledsoe , 13 , a native English speaker . &quot; Then we had to do a book report in Spanish. &quot; She helps her younger sister , a fifth-grader at Edison Elementary , with her Spanish homework . And the pair use their new language for some extracurricular communicating at_home . Nothing , Bledsoe says , beats dishing some chisme ( gossip ) in Spanish within earshot of their mother , who speaks only English . Teachers in the Culver City and Santa Monica school districts say many immersion students approach foreign language programs as Bledsoe does -- a challenge that is fun at_the_same_time . Initially , however , some parents worry that immersion classes might put their children at a disadvantage when it comes time to do English-language schoolwork . For Diana Bulgatz , that concern proved short-lived . Bulgatz acknowledges she had some qualms when she enrolled her daughter , Heidi , in Culver City ' s Spanish immersion program in 1974 . &quot; My friends asked , ' Aren ' t you worried that its going_to ruin her English ? ' &quot; recalled Bulgatz . But she decided to try the program anyway . Heidi Bulgatz graduated Phi Beta Kappa from UC Santa Barbara two years ago with a degree in cultural_anthropology and a minor in French . She developed fluency in Spanish in the Culver City schools , and went_on to learn French and study one year at the University of Bordeaux in France . Heidi Bulgatz is now an international marketing consultant for a company that manufactures and sells inflatable kayaks and rafts . &quot; It ' s a great program , &quot; her mother said . &quot; I wish we had more in the schools. &quot; Campbell of UCLA says research has shown that immersion students do as well or better on standardized performance and achievement tests as other students . But immersion programs have not come problem-free . Elementary school textbooks in Spanish and Japanese are hard to find in the United States , so school districts have to buy them from publishers in Spain , Mexico and Japan . It ' s particularly hard finding Japanese texts , said Vera Jashni , a deputy superintendent with the Culver City schools . Another problem is the popularity of the immersion programs . In the Culver City and Santa Monica school_systems , officials say , some students have been put_on waiting lists because there has been no room in the classes . Finding qualified teachers has also been a challenge . Both Santa Monica and Culver City have hired teachers from Spain . But despite such problems , the successes of immersion classes have prompted a diverse group of families to choose the schooling for their children . When Edison Elementary ' s immersion program was in its early stages five years ago , 88 % of the student body was Latino , says Principal Ruth Odell . Since then , the school has drawn students from communities including Inglewood , Pacific Palisades and Baldwin Hills . Largely because of the immersion classes , Odell says , enrollment now is 59 % Latino , 30 % white , 9 % African American and 2 % Asian . &quot; People think we ' re crazy , &quot; said Debbie Leathers , the white parent of a first-grader in Farragut ' s Japanese immersion program . Leathers admits she was worried about her son Phillip getting little English instruction until the second grade . But she says she thought a knowledge of Japanese might open_doors for him . &quot; This program seemed like a way to provide a challenge , enrichment and offer him opportunities for the future , &quot; she said . So far , she adds , she ' s happy with the results . Leathers said her son is learning such math concepts as more_than and less than in Japanese . And referring to the three Japanese alphabets , she said : &quot; Last year , they learned Hiragana . Now , they almost know all_of Katakana , and they ' re tackling Kanji . He has no problems writing the letters. &quot; A large_number of students in Westside immersion programs are of Japanese or Latino descent . In some cases , parents want their children exposed to the family ' s cultural heritage . In others , families who do not speak English at_home see the immersion program as a way to ease their children into the language . Experts say native Spanish speakers enrolled in immersion programs do as well or better in school than Spanish speakers who are not -- partly because they encounter English more gradually -- and , thus , more confidently . Consuelo Perez is from Jalisco , Mexico , and has a daughter , Brisa , in John Adams Middle_School ' s Spanish immersion program . When she enrolled Brisa in kindergarten at Edison eight years ago , the child knew no English . Now 14 , Brisa is an A student , reads and writes in Spanish and English and plans to attend Loyola Marymount University . &quot; The program is good because since they can speak Spanish and English , and feel comfortable learning , their self-esteem is very strong , &quot; said Perez , who received only a sixth-grade education . &quot; She will have more opportunities here and in Latin America. &quot; Westside school officials say immersion programs are likely to expand . The expansion , in fact , is already under way . After Santa Monica Unified adds its new ninth-grade immersion courses this fall , it plans to offer Spanish immersion humanities , math and science courses next year , said Peggy Harris , the district ' s language coordinator . &quot; We ' re even talking_about a preschool Spanish immersion program , &quot; Harris said . Ultimately , she said , the district hopes to help Santa Monica College establish an immersion program for its students . &quot; The possibilities are endless , &quot; Harris said .</TEXT>
