   <HEADLINE> REFLECTIONS ON THE BODENSEE ; PART GERMAN , PART SWISS AND RIMMED WITH MEDIEVAL TOWNS , ANTIQUE HOTELS AND BUCOLIC COUNTRYSIDE , THE BODENSEE IS A VAST INLAND ' SEA ' VIRTUALLY UNDISCOVERED BY AMERICANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Bodensee , also known as Lake Constance , has been described as Europe ' s inland sea , and this impression is particularly strong at night when a gusting southeast wind from the Alps churns_up the waters and a heavy mist obscures the opposite shore . Forty-six miles long and an hour northeast of Zurich , the Bodensee is an immense , moody lake with a checkered past and a placid , prosperous present . All around its perimeter are undulating landscapes of orchards , vineyards , forest and marshland , punctuated by imposing castles , monasteries and ancient towns . Every few miles the coastline changes character , both physically and politically . The southern shore belongs_to Switzerland , the northern shore to Germany and a tiny segment of the eastern shore to Austria . Circling the lake on the impeccably maintained roads involves passing_through customs checkpoints at least three times . A friend and I made the circuit in a gleaming , claret-colored Mercedes 190 , picked_up at Zurich ' s Kloten airport . We had reserved a full-size Renault 25 before we left the States and gotten a special rate for cars reserved ahead of time -- about $ 550 for the week , with unlimited mileage , a fee that would have more_than doubled if we had waited to rent the car in Zurich . At the rental counter , the genial young agent said that a Mercedes 190 , a car above our category and expectations , had been returned early , and asked if we would prefer that to our Renault , for the same price . Within 20 minutes , ensconced in our Mercedes , we were cruising up Highway N1 , heading for Gottlieben , Switzerland , our first stop , and a week of exploring the banks of the Bodensee . These days there is no problem waltzing across the borders from one country to the next , but during World_War_II all_the borders were closed , and this small , intimate , cohesive region was like a house divided . Families were separated , courtships and friendships interrupted . The waters themselves became the only conduit for escape , and there are many stories of German refugees swimming across the lake , ducking Nazi patrol_boats to attain safe haven , however briefly , in Switzerland . The bleak war years are a haunting memory half a century old now , and the lake district has long since resumed its role as a popular , centrally located European resort . Although this area was once an international crossroads on the north-south and east-west trade_routes of the Holy_Roman_Empire -- and later enjoyed a brief flowering of French tourism when Queen Hortense and her son , Napoleon III , resided here in the mid-19th Century -- today ' s visitors are 95 % German-speaking . For Americans , as well as for most of the non-Alemannic world , the Bodensee , with its rich lode of baroque churches , medieval towns and antique hotels , remains virtually unknown . The lakeside region where Hortense de Beauharnais Bonaparte settled in 1820 , on the far western portion of the_Swiss coast , is one of the culturally richest and most scenic areas of the Bodensee , and would make a fine starting point for anyone visiting the area for the first time . Here the lake is squeezed into a smaller pocket of water called the Untersee , or Lower Lake , by a large peninsula of German land , which also creates a second pocket of water called the Uberlingenerzee -- Uberlingen Lake -- to the north . The Untersee , stretching west , becomes narrower and narrower until it becomes the Rhine_river , once again . ( The Bodensee is actually a huge basin of Rhine water , filled by the river from an inlet at the east end of the lake , between the Austrian town of Bregenz and the_Swiss town of Rheineck , and emptying through the Untersee. ) Hortense , the wife of Napoleon ' s brother Louis , who became the King of Holland , was captivated by the beauty and calm of a run-down chateau called the Schloss Arenenberg , high on a hill and surrounded by vineyards above the village of Ermatingen . The chateau is today the Napoleon Museum , the perfectly preserved and impeccably maintained home of Napoleon III , who lived there first with his mother and later with his wife , the Empress Eugenie , who redecorated some of the interior . Ermatingen is one of several pretty lakeside towns on the banks of the Untersee , each a cluster of antique gabled houses with lavishly frescoed facades . The most striking of this medieval string of hamlets is the picture-book Swiss town of Stein am Rhein , which looks_like the setting of a fairy-tale . Elaborate frescoes portraying battles , legends and love_affairs cover the facades of many houses , some of whose foundations actually descend into the Rhine . The houses are further distinguished by oriel_windows -- intricately carved , loggia-style extensions of the facades capped with their own tiny roofs . Many cafes ring the town ' s Rathausplatz , or Town_Hall Square , where you can sit and absorb the amazing architectural artistry of this quaint town dating_back almost a_thousand years . The lake ends and the Rhine begins just east of Stein am Rhein , but if you visit this old bourg just before lunch or late in the afternoon , and you fancy a meal that is both superb and pricey , consider heading just a_few more miles west afterward to Schaffhausen and an extraordinary restaurant called the Fischerzunft . Owned by Swiss chef Andre Jaeger and his Chinese wife , Doreen , the Fischerzunft is a handsomely restored former fisherman ' s guild house built_on the banks of the Rhine in the 14th Century . Jaeger ' s unique dishes , a sophisticated blend of Asian and nouvelle French cuisine , are hardly representative of regional cooking , but they are an exquisite aberration not to be missed if you are anywhere in the vicinity . For a more modest and traditional meal , a pleasant choice is the Seehotel Schiff in the town of Mannenbach , between Ermatingen and Stein am Rhein . Modern and pristine , the Schiff , owned by the Union Bank of Switzerland and operated as an extension of its posh management training center in the nearby Castle Wolfsberg , serves breakfast , lunch and dinner in a blond-wood dining_room with water views . The menu offers fresh_fish from the lake -- perch and whitefish -- crisply sauteed , wiener_schnitzel and homemade noodles , crisp mixed-greens salads and freshly baked pastries . The Schiff has 18 businesslike , paneled hotel_rooms , but a more memorable choice for an overnight would be one of the area ' s small , antique hostelries . Among these is the old Hotel Krone in the tiny hamlet of Gottlieben , a community full of pretty houses , two other antique hotels -- the Drachenburg and the Waaghus -- and virtually no commercial center . The Krone is set just steps from the water . Built at the end of the 17th Century and renovated over the last six years by owners George and Ingeborg Schraner-Michaeli , the 24 cheerful rooms have pastel-hued floral bedspreads and curtains , airy down duvets and modern tiled bathrooms equipped with deep porcelain tubs and powerful hair_dryers . In warm weather , lunch and dinner are served outside on the waterside terrace , brightened by tubs of red geraniums . From the Krone you can explore all_the towns to the Untersee and the Rhine , moving west , as well as the handsome city of Konstanz , a German enclave almost entirely within Switzerland , to the east ( and the town which gave the Bodensee its alternative , English name ) . Because of its remarkable location , niched next to the_Swiss shoreline , Konstanz was spared the devastating Allied bombing that leveled parts of many other German cities at the end of the war . The Old Town of Konstanz is a time_capsule of 14th- and 15th-Century houses and buildings dominated by a beautifully frescoed Rathaus , or Town_Hall , once the guild house of linen weavers and remodeled in the Florentine Renaissance style at the end of the 16th Century . In good_weather , save time for a stroll over the Rheinbrucke , the Rhine Bridge , and along the broad , mansion-lined Promenade following the curve of the Seestrasse . Set_off on its own small island , just before the Rhine Bridge , is the dramatic , luxurious Steigenberger Inselhotel , a large , resort-style establishment that was once a Dominican monastery , founded in 1235 . The magnificent central cloisters are worth a visit in themselves . The Insel , with its private swimming club , gracious cocktail terrace and refined Old_World rooms is a choice place to stay when you are primed for a &quot; grand hotel &quot; experience . * To the west of Konstanz , in the center of the Untersee , is the small German island of Reichenau , which , during the Middle_Ages was one of Europe ' s most important spiritual centers . Accessible by excursion boat ( many departures from Konstanz harbor ) , the island ' s main attractions are three of the oldest churches in Germany , including a Romanesque basilica in the village of Niederzell . Attached_to Konstanz on its eastern flank like a Siamese_twin is the smaller and less appealing Swiss city of Kreuzlingen . Like Konstanz , Kreuzlingen ( named for a piece of the cross brought_back to the region from the Crusades in the 10th Century ) is a point of embarkation for the lake and river steamers that cruise the waters of the Bodensee and the Rhine . As a destination in itself , Kreuzlingen offers little apart from St . Ulrich ' s , an impressive baroque basilica . Most of the Bodensee ' s Swiss coast , in fact , is somewhat of a disappointment after the cultural depth and physical appeal of Konstanz and the shores of the Untersee . The best plan is to drive southeast along the lake , past the towns of Romanshorn and Arbon , and head directly for historic St . Gallen , about 10 miles inland from the lake but worth the detour . If the hour is appropriate , stop for a light lunch at the Hotel Bad Horn_in the little fishing village of Horn , just after Arbon , then head to Rorschach where you will see signs indicating turns for St . Gallen . Fifteen minutes later you will enter one of the least-known , formerly great old cities of Europe . St . Gallen was founded in 612 by Gallus , an itinerant Irish monk who tripped into a briar patch near where the city now stands and took it as a sign from God to stay . By the 10th Century St . Gallen ' s monastery rivaled Reichenau as one of Europe ' s most important intellectual and spiritual centers . St . Gallen was also known , from the Middle_Ages on , for its textiles -- first for the linens woven in the monastery workrooms , which were prized throughout Europe , and later , in the 18th and 19th centuries for its embroidered cottons and lace . St . Gallen is still one of the most important -- some say the most important -- embroidery centers in the world . If one has only one sight to see in St . Gallen , however , it must be the remarkable Stiftsbibliotek , or Abbey Library , in the center of the Old Town . A baroque masterwork , the Abbey Library was completed in 1767 within the enclave of the former monastery . The inlaid wood shelves of walnut and cherry , buttressed by gleaming wood columns with gilded capitals hold 130 # 000 rare antiquarian volumes . Visitors to the library must don huge felt slippers over their shoes before they are allowed to traverse the room ' s precious wood parquet_floors , inlaid with tall , stylized starbursts . To give St . Gallen its due , a full day is really necessary . If you want to stay overnight , the best hotel in town is the Einstein , a contemporary , first_class establishment lodged_in a former embroidery factory . A number of small restaurants offer traditional Swiss fare in the antique buildings of the Old Town . An alternative for a festive , but not inexpensive meal is a 15-minute drive_out of town in the village of Lommerswill at Thuri ' s Blumenau , newly opened in a pretty , old village house . Continuing on around the lake ( from St . Gallen follow signs for St . Margrethen ) , the road leads to the Austrian border , through the town of Bregenz and then almost immediately to the German border . Soon after leaving Bregenz , and Austria , which you can finesse in about 25 minutes , the lake drive leads directly to the German shore and lovely Lindau , an ancient walled city self-contained on a small island just offshore and accessible by two bridges . Once a rich , imperial town in the Middle_Ages , Lindau today is a wealthy resort area with lingering Gothic and baroque character . Here you could settle in_for two or three stressless days at the finest place in town , the esteemed Hotel Bad Schachen . An elegant dowager that has been freshened and refurbished without losing its Old_World class , the Bad Schachen is a beautifully equipped , castle-like complex on the shore opposite the town of Lindau proper , with 130 rooms and suites , most with balconies overlooking the lake . The Bad Schachen ' s swimming pavilion , built_in 1929 for bathing in the lake , was enhanced with a large outdoor swimming_pool in 1964 . The terrace breakfast buffet at the Bad Schachen is sumptuous . The long buffet table is laid with yogurts , fresh berries , cereals , butters , homemade jams , trays of assorted cold meats , cheeses , baskets of pastries and rolls , cutting boards holding fresh loaves of multi-grain country breads , and a chicken-shaped straw basket within which nestle a brood of warm hard-boiled_eggs . After this fulfilling breakfast , you can arrange at the front desk to rent a speed boat with a driver , who may look more like Gabby Hayes than Don Johnson but who knows the lake intimately . * Beyond Lindau , moving west along the German coast , is the industrial town of Friedrichshafen , where Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin had his giant airships built_in harborside hangars . Meersburg , about half an hour further on , is yet another remarkable , skillfully restored and maintained medieval town perched high above the lake and surrounded by vineyards almost as old as the town . Parts of the town itself are believed to date_back to the 7th-Century Merovingian king , Dagobert . Despite an influx of bus tourists from time to time in the summer months , and the inevitable , ugly souvenir shops that bloom in their wake , Meersburg deserves a 24-hour visit , particularly since the opening , in the spring of 1991 , of a tiny , beguiling hotel called the Drei Stuben , created from a restored 17th-Century townhouse by Brigitte Drewing , the wife of a wealthy local businessman . Every detail at the Drei Stuben is top_of_the_line , from the Rosenthal China in the dining_room to a state-of-the-art Sony &quot; Dream Machine &quot; clock_radio at each bedside . The hotel ' s restaurant has been leased to a brilliant 27-year-old chef named Stefan Marquard , a representative of the German culinary avant-garde , and a gastronomic luminary in the making . For an entirely different sort of dining experience , this one in an atmospheric old tavern that serves_up high-quality regional fare , reserve a table at chef Michael Benz ' s Winzerstube Zum Becher , set_in one of Meersburg ' s oldest houses , built_in 1605 . A car ferry runs from Meersburg to Konstanz , which is one way to complete a circuit of the Bodensee . The alternative is to press_on around the northwestern tip of the lake , where the water narrows into the Uberlingensee . If you opt_for the drive , stop for a look_at Salem , Germany ' s most elite boarding_school where Prince Philip was educated . Then it ' s on through the towns of Uberlingen , Sipplingen , Bodman ( whose harbor hosts a splendid regatta of antique sailboats every four years ) , Dingelsdorf and finally , just before Konstanz , to the bridge that leads onto Germany ' s highly touted floral paradise , the island of Mainau . Mainau , with 110 acres of cultivated gardens and a cream-colored 18th-Century palace , is the home of 85-year-old Count Lennart Bernadotte , his 50-year-old second wife , Countess Sonja , and their five young children . In 1932 the Swedish-born Count Bernadotte , the uncle of Sweden ' s King Carl-Gustav , inherited what was then an overgrown , run-down island from his grandmother , Victoria , the daughter of the Grand-Duke Friederich I of Baden who later became the Queen of Sweden . A former student of forestry and agriculture , the Count slowly transformed the tangled , unkept acres into a world-renowned botanical wonder open year-round to the public . And public it is . From morning to evening the place is choked with tourists , particularly in July and August , more_than 3 million a year . Ranks of tour buses jam the parking_lot and 2 # 000 to 3 # 000 people a day wait hungrily for tables at one of the island ' s four restaurants . This is not necessarily a reason to avoid this unique operation , only a caveat to arrive as soon after the 7 a.m. opening hour as possible . Mainau , with its crowds and its enterprising publicity office , is an anomaly on the Bodensee . For the most part , the lake is a region that time , politics and progress have left_behind . &quot; From the perspectives of Berne , Bonn and Vienna , the capitals of the three countries bordering the lake , &quot; says Ernst Muhlemann , a member of the_Swiss Parliament and director of the Union Bank of Switzerland ' s Management Center in Castle Wolfsberg , &quot; the Bodensee district is considered the end of the world. &quot; But this he says with a smile , since he knows how nice the end of the world can be .
