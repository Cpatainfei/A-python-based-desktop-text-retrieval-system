   <HEADLINE> WHY U.S. SHOULD LIFT BOSNIAN EMBARGO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The time has come for a unilateral U.S. lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina . The Clinton_Administration has preserved the Serbs ' arms advantage for two years , deferring to the wishes of the_British and French and ignoring the stated preference of Congress . The result has been a sorry disappointment . When the Bosnian Serbs defied a July 20 ultimatum for the acceptance of a peace plan , the five powers that had issued the ultimatum responded with only a minor tightening of economic sanctions on Serbia proper . Several other threats the five had made turned_out to be empty . Even leaky sanctions ( Russia has ignored them ) hurt in the long_run , however , and Serbia has sought an end to the sanctions by suddenly stopping traffic with Serbian Bosnia and denouncing its recalcitrance . But in the Stalinist manner of old , President Slobodan Milosevic controls both policy and media . Yesterday ' s dogma is today ' s heresy and may be dogma again tomorrow . The Serbian action that matters is the action being taken_in Bosnia . Momcilo Krajisnik , speaker of the Bosnian Serb assembly , has declared that the Serbs will not settle for less than 64 % of Bosnian territory -- as against the 49 % assigned them in the five-power plan . Consistent with this view , the Bosnian Serbs are continuing their notorious ethnic cleansing . Within the past few days , according to reports confirmed by the Red_Cross , the Serbs have sent 100 Muslim men to a labor camp in the Bosnian northeast and expelled more_than 300 Muslim women and children from a town in the area . In the NATO heavy-weapons exclusion zones around Sarajevo and Gorazde , the Serbs , undeterred by a pinprick NATO air_attack , have escalated their attacks with virtual impunity . The U.N. commander , British Lt . Gen . Sir Michael Rose , declined to call_for NATO retaliation in Gorazde on Monday even after Serb forces fired anti-aircraft rounds in the exclusion zone and repeatedly attacked his forces there . Sarajevo is the soul and the symbol of ethnically mixed Bosnia . The lifting of the arms embargo should not mean an end to the NATO exclusion zone there . That zone should be enforced by vigorous retaliation against , among other targets , the Bosnian Serb capital , Pale . But given Rose ' s refusal to enforce the zone , his call_for a broader demilitarization of Sarajevo rings hollow . Elsewhere in the country , in any event , only the Bosnians themselves can deter further aggression ; and they can only do so if they bring their forces into parity with those of the Serbs . The lifting of the arms embargo will take months to have any effect and can be reimposed if needed , but the moment for the change is now . Given the isolation of the Bosnian Serbs , the risk to the U.N. troops will never be smaller . And even that risk cannot be overwhelming in_view of the reluctance of the United Nations to avail itself even of the NATO protection already available .</TEXT>
