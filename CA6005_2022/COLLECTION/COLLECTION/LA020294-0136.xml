   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; AID POURS INTO VALLEY , MORE STRUCTURES ARE TAGGED UNSAFE ; RECOVERY : REQUESTS FOR INSPECTIONS MOUNT AMID HEADACHES OVER HUGE TRAFFIC TIE-UPS . BUT OFFICIALS BELIEVE MOST OF THE DAMAGED BUILDINGS CAN BE REPAIRED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Infusions of assistance , public and private , poured in_for San Fernando Valley quake victims Tuesday , but more damage from aftershocks caused enormous traffic tie-ups and some high_school students had to eat_in wind-whipped tents after_part of their cafeteria was condemned . While hundreds of frightened residents continued to live outdoors in tents at Red_Cross shelters throughout the Valley , building inspectors said Tuesday that for the most part , the aftershocks have not done a great_deal of additional damage . &quot; We are receiving ( requests ) continually , &quot; said David R . Keim , principal building inspector for the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety . &quot; ( But ) mainly the damage from the aftershocks has been architectural or superficial. &quot; Figures released Tuesday by the city ' s Department of Building and Safety show that 1 # 862 buildings have been deemed unsafe , affecting 13 # 860 housing units . Another 7 # 000 buildings have been posted with yellow_flags that limit entry . Nonetheless , Keim said building officials believe most of the unsafe buildings can be repaired . &quot; We expect very few demolitions on these red-tagged buildings , &quot; he said . In other developments Tuesday : * President Bill_Clinton added $ 2 billion to his federal aid package for Los Angeles , bringing the total White_House request to $ 9.5 billion . * Elizabeth Dole , president of the American Red_Cross , announced in Northridge that the agency is seeking to raise $ 50 million for disaster relief , including efforts in Southern California . The Red_Cross has spent about $ 30 million providing shelter , clothing and serving meals for more_than 7 # 000 people since the Jan . 17 quake . * The &quot; Earthquake Express , &quot; a caravan of nine 40-foot tractor-trailers filled with food , beverages , diapers and other earthquake supplies donated by Teamster union_members around the state , arrived_at a Red_Cross warehouse at the Van Nuys Airport . The goods_will be distributed to earthquake victims at shelters . * Mayor Richard Riordan visited two fire_stations near the quake ' s epicenter , including one that has been condemned because of earthquake damage . At the confluence of the Hollywood and Ventura freeways in North Hollywood , cracks and exposed steel in concrete columns after Saturday ' s 5.0 magnitude aftershock added_to the traffic woes of thousands of San Fernando Valley motorists already coping_with earlier quake damage to freeways . Transportation workers have begun shoring_up the damaged pillars , but the process forced them to shut_down key transition lanes , leaving commuters bottle-necked during most of the day Tuesday . &quot; It was an entire surprise , but then again , it ' s been an entire surprise since they opened the freeways , &quot; said Tim Cochran , 25 , whose half-hour commute from North Hollywood to his job at Warner Center Flowers &amp; Gifts stretched into a 90-minute ordeal Tuesday . The right lane of the two-lane transition road from the westbound Ventura Freeway-134 onto the westbound Ventura Freeway-101 has been closed , jamming traffic for miles during rush_hour . Even in the early afternoon , the half-mile drive from Cahuenga Boulevard through the freeway split took more_than 10 minutes . Caltrans also has cordoned off one of two lanes in the junction leading from the northbound Hollywood Freeway-101 to the Hollywood Freeway-170 . Both transitions are off-limits to trucks , which &quot; tend to cause bouncing on the connectors , &quot; Caltrans spokesman Russell Snyder said . The lane closures should last at least through Thursday as transportation crews reinforce the damaged columns with steel beams . The shoring work will cost Caltrans about $ 300 # 000 , Snyder said . By the end of 1995 , the damaged interchange is scheduled to be seismologically retrofitted with steel casings for the columns and long anchoring rods . But &quot; we ' re focusing_on the emergencies for now , so we don ' t have a ( precise ) timetable for that , &quot; Snyder said . Meanwhile , at the Van Nuys Courthouse , employees and jurors were faced with a new problem Tuesday morning after the 2 # 000-space parking structure serving the two Van Nuys courthouses was declared unsafe . The closure of the parking facility took workers and jurors by surprise -- mainly because they had been parking in it for more_than a week , since it passed inspection two days after the Northridge earthquake . Superior_Court judges were allowed to park in a makeshift lot next to their courthouse . But Municipal Court judges , attorneys working for the district_attorney and public_defender , and hundreds of jurors were forced to fight for limited parking in private lots and on surrounding streets . The parking mess grew throughout the morning , growing worse when several nearby streets were closed because a gas leak forced the evacuation of the nearby Los Angeles Police_Station in the Van Nuys Government Center . Officials have developed contingency plans to provide parking to jurors and some court employees , but 200 jurors summoned for a death_penalty murder trial set to begin today have been asked to report next week . &quot; Every minute , it ' s a new crisis , &quot; said Richard D . Johnson , chief of the Valley Division of the Los Angeles Municipal Court . At Cleveland High_School in Reseda , one of the dozens of Valley schools damaged during the quake , students were forced to eat lunches outside for a second consecutive day because of a quake-damaged cafeteria . But Tuesday , strong winds added another insult , depositing dust on students ' hamburgers and fried potatoes . &quot; There is so_much dust . . . in the air still settling , &quot; said senior Samantha Manchen , 17 , who instead ate lunch at a Denny ' s . Samantha said she will continue to eat_out until she feels it ' s safe to eat lunch at the new outdoor cafeteria . Even though city inspectors declared the cafeteria and the dining hall structurally safe after the initial jolt more_than two weeks ago , some parts of the covered walkway that wraps around the building -- situated at the center of the campus -- were deemed unsafe , cutting_off access to the cafeteria , Principal Ida Mae Windham said . So when the school reopened Monday , administrators hurriedly brought_in a blue-and-white striped circus_tent , which they set_up near the back of the cafeteria . On Tuesday , strong winds bent one of the metal support bars , preventing workers from re-erecting the tent and forcing cafeteria staff_members to serve lunches in the open . Food service workers wheeled out carts filled with cold sandwiches , hamburgers and chocolate_milk , but because of the long lines involved , his chicken patty was cold , senior Mike Knispel said . But some did commend the school for trying its best to feed the students against all odds . &quot; For some students , this is probably the only hot meal they will have all day , &quot; said Gohar Tokuzyan , a 12th-grader . Mayor Riordan looked over one fire_station condemned because of quake damage near the quake ' s epicenter and at another he praised city firefighters who fought dozens of blazes and rescued several people trapped in buildings the morning of the quake . &quot; Thank you very much . You guys are heroes , &quot; Riordan told firefighters from Station 73 on Reseda Boulevard . The station ' s firefighters dealt with the collapse of the Northridge Meadows Apartments where 16 people died . Firefighters told Riordan their biggest problem after the quake was battling the numerous gas-fueled fires that erupted after the temblor broke underground gas_lines and residents were unable to turn_off their gas_lines because shut-off valves were either located underground or could be controlled only by a special key used by gas_company employees . &quot; From a hill , within 15 to 20 minutes you could see a bunch of fires that -- if not started by broken natural_gas lines -- were certainly aided by them , &quot; Battalion Chief Richard Jioras said . &quot; It was by far the most difficult thing we had to deal with. &quot; Responding , Riordan said , &quot; Yeah , we really have to think_of some ordinances &quot; to correct the problem . Earlier in the morning , the mayor viewed Station 70 in Northridge -- about five miles north on Reseda Boulevard from the Reseda station . The 15-year-old building , which has been condemned , has not been used since the quake sent tiles and bricks raining_down and caused deep cracks in the station ' s walls and doorways . Firefighters and equipment have been reassigned to other stations and a Fire_Department spokesman said the building -- which may have incurred $ 1 million in damage -- might have to be rebuilt .
