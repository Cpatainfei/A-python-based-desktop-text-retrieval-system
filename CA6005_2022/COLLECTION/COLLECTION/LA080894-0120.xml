   <HEADLINE> RENO MAY REQUEST INDEPENDENT COUNSEL FOR ESPY INVESTIGATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Atty . Gen . Janet Reno could ask as soon as this week for the appointment of an independent counsel to complete the stalemated investigation into whether Agriculture_Secretary Mike Espy improperly accepted gifts from a prominent Arkansas poultry producer , Justice_Department sources said Sunday . Justice_Department investigators concluded weeks ago that Espy ' s acceptance of travel , lodging and professional_football tickets from Don Tyson , the head of Tyson Foods Inc. , the nation ' s largest chicken producer , constituted a technical violation of the Meat Inspection Act of 1907 . That law prohibits meat regulators from accepting gifts and carries a one-year prison_term . Critics have alleged that those gifts may also be related to the Agriculture_Department ' s decision to delay tougher inspection procedures for the poultry industry . However , Justice_Department officials said appointment of an independent counsel would not suggest that new and more damaging facts about Espy had come_to_light . Rather , it would provide a means of resolving a dispute between law_enforcement authorities concerning the Espy case . High-level Justice_Department officials pressed to close the case this spring , saying investigators had found insufficient evidence that Espy ' s actions violated the law . But FBI officials said they believed that they had not yet exhausted all avenues of inquiry in the investigation . After Congress in June renewed the law creating the office of independent counsel , Justice_Department officials concluded that they effectively had no choice but to seek the appointment of a counsel as a referee . Interviewed on ABC-TV ' s &quot; This Week With David Brinkley , &quot; White_House Counsel Lloyd N . Cutler said the law &quot; requires the appointment of an independent counsel for someone like Mr. Espy if further investigation is warranted. &quot; Last week , Espy hired former federal prosecutor Reid Weingarten to represent him in the case . Before entering private practice , Weingarten had spent several years in the Justice_Department ' s public integrity section , which has been supervising the Espy case . Weingarten and a spokeswoman for Espy did not return calls to their homes Sunday . The key to the case may hinge_on whether Espy accepted favors at_the_same_time he was delaying the imposition of Agriculture_Department standards governing inspections at chicken-processing plants , including 66 plants operated by Tyson Foods . The federal_government eventually toughened the regulations , but only after the proposals were first scrapped on order of Espy ' s chief_of_staff .</TEXT>
