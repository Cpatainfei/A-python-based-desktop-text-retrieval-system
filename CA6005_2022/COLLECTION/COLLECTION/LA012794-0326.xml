   <HEADLINE> PRESCHOOL AIDE DIAGNOSED WITH CONTAGIOUS TB ; HEALTH : COUNTY ASKS PARENTS TO ALLOW THE 60 CHILDREN AT CUDDLE CARE CENTER TO BE TESTED FOR DISEASE THAT POSES WORST THREAT TO VERY YOUNG . IT IS THIRD RECENT OUTBREAK IN SCHOOLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A teacher ' s aide at a Fullerton preschool has been diagnosed with a contagious form of tuberculosis requiring the testing of children and staff_members at the school , Orange County health officials said Wednesday . * County officials learned of the infection when the 28-year-old teacher ' s aide at the Cuddle Care Center was diagnosed Monday at Martin_Luther Hospital in Anaheim . Hospital officials then reported to the county that she had active , contagious tuberculosis , said Orange County Health Officer Hugh Stallworth . Parents of the 60 children at the school were to be notified by mail Wednesday that their children might have been exposed to TB . The letters from the county also asked permission for public health nurses to administer TB skin_tests to the children at school on Monday . In addition , Stallworth said , eight current staff_members and two former teachers at the school should be tested . It is the third time in recent months that TB screenings have been ordered in Orange County schools . County health officials say this demonstrates the increasing threat of the disease , which was once believed to be virtually eradicated in the United States . The two previous alerts were at high_schools in La Habra and Garden Grove . Tuberculosis poses its greatest danger to children under age 5 because their immune_systems often are not strong enough to ward_off the lung disease . Children at Cuddle Care Center , county officials said , range_in age between 15 months and 5 years . In addition , Stallworth said , young children and the elderly are more likely to contract an active form of TB and can suffer more complications . &quot; It could hit them harder , &quot; he said . Tuberculosis , a bacterial infection of the lungs , can be successfully treated with antibiotics . Roberta Maxwell , the county ' s program manager for pulmonary disease services , said operators of Cuddle Care Center told officials the teacher ' s aide had tested negative for the disease before she began working_at the center last September . Gail Ritchie , who runs the child_care center , declined to comment on the situation , referring all questions to the county . Under state laws governing the licensing of preschool facilities , preschool staff_members must be tested for tuberculosis before employment and all new students must have TB skin_tests . * County health officials said they will hold a meeting at Cuddle Care Center at 7 tonight to counsel parents and staff_members about the disease . Tuberculosis germs are spread through the air when a contagious person sneezes or coughs . The disease typically infects those who have been in close contact over a long period_of_time with someone who has the disease . The recent increase in tuberculosis cases in the county , Stallworth said , is associated with an influx of immigrants from regions such_as the Far East where there is a high rate of tuberculosis . People infected with HIV or who are malnourished , drug_users or alcoholics also are &quot; at risk &quot; for the disease , Stallworth said . In September , the county tested all 1 # 034 students and 189 staff_members at La Quinta High_School in Garden Grove after seven students were found to have active TB infections . Another 189 students tested positive for the bacterium but were in the earliest stage of the disease , when it has done no harm and is not contagious . They were put_on medication to prevent their infection from becoming active in the future . In early January , 225 students and 81 staff_members were tested at La Habra High_School after a senior girl was hospitalized with contagious tuberculosis . Skin_tests found that 35 of her classmates tested positive for the bacterium . La Habra High students with positive skin_tests subsequently received chest X-rays to determine whether they had the active disease . Rick Greenwood , the county ' s deputy director of public health , said Wednesday that the X-ray results indicate that one more student may have active tuberculosis . People who take skin_tests and register positive may_not have active , contagious cases because their immune_systems are holding the disease at_bay . &quot; There are a lot of people who skin_test positive who are out there in the community , &quot; Stallworth said . &quot; At what point they will change to an active case , I don ' t know , but the potential is there for there to be a serious problem. &quot; Greenwood said the county will make school skin testing mandatory next fall_for all new admissions to public_schools and start students who test positive on preventive therapy . &quot; This approach will prevent TB outbreaks in schools from occurring in the future , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
