   <HEADLINE> GYORGY CZIFFRA ; RENOWNED PERFORMER OF LISZT ' S WORKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hungarian-born pianist Gyorgy Cziffra , best known for his brilliant performances of Franz Liszt ' s rhapsodies , has died , relatives said Sunday . He was 72 . Cziffra died Saturday of a heart_attack at a Paris hospital . Living_in exile since the 1956 Soviet-led invasion of Hungary , Cziffra had a home_in Senlis , northeast of Paris , where he ran a foundation for young musicians and artists . Born of Gypsy descent in 1921 in Budapest , Cziffra started performing at an early age and rapidly gained international fame with his renditions of the works of Liszt , the 19th-Century Hungarian pianist and composer . Cziffra made two major visits to Los Angeles -- performing at the Hollywood Bowl in 1957 and Pasadena ' s Ambassador Auditorium in 1984 . The pianist , Times writer Daniel Cariaga noted after the 1984 performance , &quot; commands a technique of superlative digital and sound resources ; plays the piano in an old-fashioned , improvisatory , irresistible manner and makes music almost offhandedly. &quot; A prisoner of the Red Army during World_War_II , Cziffra was sentenced to three years forced labor in the 1950s for trying to escape_from Communist Hungary . He took his family into exile in 1956 and became a French citizen in 1968 , adopting the_French first_name Georges . The pianist recounted his life in a book , &quot; Guns and Flowers. &quot; A spokeswoman for Cziffra ' s foundation , the Saint-Frambourg Royal Chapel , said he set it up in 1973 &quot; to spare young artists the misery he lived through. &quot; Cziffra also founded an annual music festival at the medieval abbey of La Chaise Dieu , in central France .</TEXT>
