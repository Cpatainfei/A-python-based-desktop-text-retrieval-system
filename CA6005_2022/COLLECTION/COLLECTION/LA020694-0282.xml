   <HEADLINE> MASS TRANSIT , NOW MORE THAN EVER ; THE QUAKE WAS A LESSON , BUT BETTER OPTIONS ARE NEEDED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not even the worst earthquake in modern Los Angeles history was enough to break_up the romance of solitary Southern California drivers and their automobiles . That was the finding , at least , of a recent Times poll in which 86 % of respondents in the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys said they do not plan to switch to mass transit or organize car or van pools . The percentage of San Fernando Valley workers who had been using public transportation , for example , was quite small before the quake , ranging from a high of just 7.5 % in the Mission Hills-Panorama City-North Hills area to a low of 1.3 % in Granada Hills . This is unfortunate because success in coping_with the Northridge quake depends_on the use of more efficient transportation options . U.S. Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena said as much when he emphasized that the long-term plan to rebuild the Los Angeles area ' s transportation network must include efforts to persuade as_many commuters as possible to park their cars and use mass transit . To make such options more convenient , Pena was arranging to have more locomotives and trains added_to Metrolink . He was also securing federal waivers to allow an increase in the average speed of Metrolink trains running between Palmdale and Los Angeles . As we have said before , if this disaster gets enough people out of their cars and riding to work by bus or rail , the quake may help put Los Angeles on its way to a more efficient and far less vulnerable 21st Century transit system . We have repeatedly applauded , for example , the safety_valve of the new rail options . Transportation officials , with the help of Navy Seabee crews , have done an admirable job of pressing new stations and alternatives into service in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys . Ridership , however , must resume its climb to alleviate the strain on congested roadways and broken highways . True , Metrolink ridership on some lines increased more_than tenfold , but that says more about how few people were using the trains in the first place . And ridership took a disappointing dip last week -- by 40 % in the Santa Clarita Valley -- which we hope represents only temporary testing of resumed commuting by car . As more and more stations are rushed into service , we must also remind Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials and local_governments that parking cannot be forgotten . It hardly helps to spark interest in the rails if drivers cannot find a parking spot . In this regard , the San Fernando Valley Bus Restructuring Study takes_on a heightened importance . Residents are unhappy with their bus options and the study was designed to take a comprehensive approach to the problem . Perhaps it will conclude that Valley residents would be_better served by a point-to-point system in which the routes would connect major activity and employment centers , rather than the current grid system , which involves north-south and east-west routes and too many transfers . Lastly , we are pleased to hear that MTA officials and Caltrans were working_on adding high-occupancy vehicle or car-pool lanes to several freeways that serve the Valley before the quake . What better way to stress the advantages of ride sharing than the sight of car-pool traffic speeding past commuters during rush_hour ?</TEXT>
