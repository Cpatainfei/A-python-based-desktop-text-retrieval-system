The holiday caught_on with many people in the United States-where it is sometimes confused with Mexican Independence_Day , which falls on Sept . 16-and is celebrated more vigorously herethan in many areas in Mexico . Its popularity grew in part because the holiday was embraced by Chicano activists during the 1960s as a symbol of their civil_rights struggle .
