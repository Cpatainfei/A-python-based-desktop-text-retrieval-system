   <TEXT> David Kiley awoke in pain . Stabbing , gripping , tormenting pain . What Kiley did next changed his life as the world ' s greatest wheelchair basketball_player . He took a red , spiral-shaped painkiller and hoped that the burning in his legs would stop . Now , he regrets taking anything that morning , 50 hours before the United States won the gold medal at the 1992 Paralympic Games in Barcelona . He regrets it because shortly after the U.S. victory , Kiley tested positive for a banned drug . He was accused of cheating and the Americans were stripped of their medal . Eleven teammates who worked so hard for that golden moment had it taken_away because of David Kiley ' s pain . And that has hurt most of all . * For the past two years , Kiley , a former Orange County basketball star living_in San Dimas , has waged a one-man crusade to get the medals back for his teammates -- an effort that has entangled him in the multilayered bureaucracy of the disabled sports world and placed him at the middle of the controversy over whether disabled athletes should be subjected_to the same drug-testing rules that govern their able-bodied peers . Kiley ' s campaign has come_to a head at a time when disabled sports has outgrown its back-yard recreation mentality to boast an air of professionalism with sponsorship , financial_backing and fan interest . In the multimillion-dollar game of international sport , the disabled are seeking their share of the fortune . Disabled athletes and officials have long sought more respect and recognition , saying they are in most ways equal_to the able-bodied . In an effort to prove their point , officials began limited drug testing at the 1988 Paralympics , a quadrennial event that showcases six categories of disabled athletes in competitions from wheelchair basketball to track_and_field . They adopted the International Olympic Committee ' s list of banned substances , an array of drugs from anabolic_steroids to over-the-counter nasal sprays . As a result , they were confronted with the two sides of drug testing : catching those who take performance-enhancing drugs such_as anabolic_steroids and amphetamines but penalizing unsuspecting athletes who take cold preparations , asthma medications and mild painkillers . The able-bodied athletic world has wrestled with this issue since drug testing was introduced at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal . For disabled athletes such_as Kiley , the issue has added complications because their physical conditions might require medications that the able-bodied could function without . &quot; We ' re still handicapped . We need our own set of drug rules , &quot; said Anardo Valdez , Kiley ' s teammate on the 1992 U.S. Paralympic basketball_team . Perhaps the most poignant symbols of the battle are the gold medals -- being held by the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation in Sheffield , England , until the dispute is settled . Initially , the American players had refused to turn_over their medals because they were so angry -- at first with Kiley and their coach , then at the system . They had done nothing wrong , so why were they being punished ? they asked . Only after international officials threatened to bar members of the team from the 1996 Paralympics in Atlanta were the gold medals returned . All except one . Valdez , a former Marine from New York who played for two decades , refused . &quot; I don ' t think that medal should leave America , &quot; Valdez said . &quot; We won it. &quot; He was banned for life by the U.S. Wheelchair Basketball Assn . * When drug testing was started in 1988 , it was modeled after the International Olympic Committee ' s program . Significantly , the disabled leaders left no avenue to appeal decisions -- an accepted procedure in other international sports . Still , in March , 1993 , Kiley and the U.S. disabled sports team were granted a hearing before the now defunct International Coordination Committee of World Sports Organizations for the Disabled , the group that ran the Barcelona Games . The ICC upheld the decision to disqualify the Americans . That ended the saga until the wheelchair basketball community got a copy of the minutes from the ICC ' s meeting . They learned that ICC officials voted to uphold the decision before the U.S. delegation was heard . The reason Kiley took the drug did not matter_to them , said Bob Steadward of Edmonton , Canada , president of the International Paralympic Committee that has replaced the defunct ICC . As an ICC official , Steadward introduced the proposal to uphold the U.S. disqualification before the hearing and has emerged as a hard-liner in Kiley ' s case . &quot; He was tested . It was positive . It was_on the banned list , &quot; Steadward said . &quot; Every athlete could come_up with all sorts of reasons ( for using the drug ) . &quot; In fact , others did . Another disabled athlete caught at Barcelona was Leon Labuschagne , a discus thrower from South_Africa . Labuschagne was allowed to keep his gold medal because he tested positive for a banned substance that was taken_over a long period to treat hypertension . If nothing else , Kiley , 41 , believes his reasons for taking the painkiller deserved consideration when meting out punishment . Unlike some athletes , he never contested the drug test ' s results : &quot; I should have known what I was taking . There is no excuse for it , and I won ' t make any , &quot; he said at his office at Casa Colina Rehabilitation Center in Pomona , where he is director of wheelchair sports . But then the punishment was handed_down -- a two-year suspension for Kiley and disqualification for his team . &quot; Ben Johnson ( Canadian sprinter ) got a two-year suspension for steroids , and this little trace of ( a painkiller ) cost the team a gold medal , &quot; Kiley said . &quot; There was no intent whatsoever for anything other_than to take my person out of pain . It served no purpose in that gold medal game . &quot; The fact that my teammates lost their gold medals is totally unacceptable , &quot; he said , adding that he is prepared to give_up his medal for the sake of the others . It appears that he is finally making_headway . The IPC executive committee agreed last month to appear before the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne , Switzerland . The court , created by the International Olympic Committee , is expected to hear the case early next year . The International Olympic Committee , perhaps the world ' s most influential amateur sports organization , persuaded the IPC to agree to arbitration after IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch was petitioned by the U.S. Olympic Committee on Kiley ' s behalf . For disabled athletics to gain a foothold in the established sporting world , they need IOC support -- and money . That gave Samaranch leverage to force the IPC to resolve Kiley ' s case . Yet , resistance lingers . &quot; I ' m really surprised ( the Americans ) made a decision to continue to pursue a situation that had already been duly adjudicated , &quot; Steadward said . &quot; We ' ve forgotten about it and gone_on to more important matters. &quot; If they thought Kiley would simply forget about it , they did not know him . Not only has Kiley been an outstanding basketball_player and skier , he has scaled Guadalupe Peak , Texas ' highest mountain at 8 # 751 feet . At times , he crawled across rocks while dragging a wheelchair and gear by a rope clenched in his teeth . He brought the same determination to the dispute . When he returned from Barcelona , his sponsors were not sure whether to promote him as a gold medal_winner or ignore him as a cheater . A wheelchair manufacturer sponsor left him off its poster of American gold medalists . &quot; That just killed me , &quot; Kiley said . &quot; The first year and a half I ' d come_to tears a_few times a week . It could be a conversation , it could be a thought , something I was reading. &quot; During the first three months after the drug test , Kiley spent most of his day trying to find a way to get his case heard . He spent so_much time on it he ignored his job and his wife , Sandy , and their children , Justin , 14 , and Danielle , 10 . &quot; It made things much more tense in our household , &quot; Kiley said . &quot; I was consumed by it. &quot; An ill-tempered competitor likened to tennis great John McEnroe , Kiley often incensed officials by not mincing words . More_than a year ago , he called officials &quot; a bunch of able-bodied demigods who don ' t have a closeness to the sport. &quot; Kiley amassed thick files of paperwork on his case that he has sent to all_of his ' 92 teammates . Next year Kiley plans to run_for commissioner of the U.S. National Wheelchair Basketball Assn . against Stan Labanowich , the commissioner who suspended him but who also is trying to help win an appeal . Kiley realized that the only way to change the system was to become involved in the process . Kiley said if he loses the arbitration , and the election , he will try to compete in his sixth Paralympics at Atlanta . He was a member of two gold medal winning wheelchair basketball_teams before 1992 and also won medals in skiing competitions in the Winter Paralympics . He had planned to retire after Barcelona , but the loss of the medal has fueled his competitive drive . &quot; It doesn ' t go_away , &quot; he said . * Kiley , a sandy-haired man with a baritone_voice , is a 14-time All-American who became one of the greatest symbols of the disabled leading active lives . A basketball star at Mater Dei High_School in Santa Ana , Kiley damaged his spinal_cord in 1973 when riding down the snow on an inner_tube that slammed , back-first , into a tree in the San Bernardino Mountains . The accident left him partially paralyzed from the waist down . Throughout his endeavors , Kiley suffered excruciating pain in his back and legs because his spinal_cord is only partially severed . He often took mild painkillers to deaden the pain . In Barcelona , the pain was so bad one day that Kiley ' s coach , Harry Vines , gave him a Darvocet , a prescription painkiller containing the banned narcotic Darvon . Kiley did not take the medication immediately because he had a game the next day . Painkillers can slow the reflexes and affect play . But two days before the United States played its gold-medal game against the_Netherlands , Kiley awoke at 2:30 a.m. with the intense pain in his legs . He took the pill , as he had done hundreds of times before . Although pharmacologists say Darvon is not performance-enhancing and its analgesic effect lasts only six hours , a trace amount was found in Kiley ' s system about 50 hours later . Playing his worst game of the Paralympics , Kiley scored five points as the United States defeated the_Netherlands for the gold medal , 39-36 . Afterward , Kiley was selected for testing . Of the 3 # 600 athletes at the ' 92 Paralympics , 225 were required to provide urine samples for drug tests . Only the gold medal_winners were tested , said Phil Craven , president of the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation . Kiley said the athletes had little information about the selection process . Kiley said he thought banned drugs meant anabolic_steroids or other performance-enhancing substances . It did not occur to him , he said , that other families of drugs such_as painkillers also were banned . American athletes were sent literature , given lectures and shown a film about drug testing , U.S. officials said . But the film was shown on the team charter to Barcelona . The wheelchair basketball_team was not on the plane . Not even Craven , IWBF president , understood the drug-testing regulations in Barcelona . &quot; The rules were so scant , &quot; said Craven , who has become a strong critic of the current drug program . After what happened to Kiley , Craven adopted the drug-testing policies of the international governing body for basketball . The program has a standard appeals process and sanctioning policy . Drug testing has brought a sophistication to disabled sports . But the competitions really began as a method of rehabilitation . The Paralympics have been held since 1960 , usually around the time of the Summer and Winter Games , though not always in the same city or country . But in 1988 , the event was held a month after the Summer Olympics in Seoul , South_Korea , ushering a new era of disabled athletics . The disabled used many of the facilities built for the Seoul Games , and for the first time felt_like part of the international sports community . Limited drug testing was introduced although Kiley , who helped the United States win a gold medal , said he did not know of any basketball_players who were tested . The Barcelona Games were held_on an even larger scale four years later and the Atlanta Paralympics is expected to be the biggest yet , with about 4 # 000 athletes representing 100 countries in 16 sports . The IPC has a $ 50-million budget to produce the games in conjunction with Atlanta Committee to Organize the Games , the local organizing committee for the ' 96 Summer Olympics . For the first time the marketing of a Paralympics will be coordinated with the Olympics . The Paralympics , which is different from the participation-oriented Special_Olympics , bring_together competitors from six international_organizations , including those representing blind players and the wheelchair-bound . As the Paralympics grew it became evident that disabled athletes needed some drug regulations of_their_own . &quot; Just because we ' re disabled athletes doesn ' t make us morally pure , &quot; said David Efferson of Castro Valley , Calif. , a member of the ' 92 U.S. team . Officials hoped that by implementing drug testing in Barcelona they could deter use of banned substances . When Kiley tested positive , they had caught one of the Games ' superstars . &quot; They wanted to make a strong statement but they set their feet on the wrong example , &quot; said Paul DePace , chairman of the National Wheelchair Athletic Assn. , the governing body for U.S. wheelchair sports . Still , wheelchair basketball officials felt handcuffed by Kiley ' s situation . Labanowich , who has called_for revisions of the IPC ' s drug testing program , said Kiley ' s actions forced the group to suspend him shortly after he tested positive . When Kiley was asked before the test whether he ingested any substances , he failed to mention the Darvocet . &quot; That put us in a real bind in trying to defend David , &quot; Labanowich said . &quot; We couldn ' t close our eyes to the wrongdoing. &quot; Kiley said he was asked if he had taken anything within 48 hours of the Sunday final . Counting days , not hours , he figured taking a pill on Friday night was outside the time frame . ( He actually took it early Saturday. ) &quot; I was thinking , ' This is a hassle , I want to get_back to the guys and celebrate , ' &quot; Kiley said . &quot; So , I wasn ' t as clear with the question as I should have been. &quot; But if Kiley made mistakes , so did the drug testers , according to some in the wheelchair basketball community . They claim that the drug testing program violated Kiley ' s confidentiality by openly discussing his result , and did not allow him to witness the analysis of his test , standard protocol in other international sports . The community has supported Kiley ' s efforts to have a fair appeal after becoming aware of the discrepancies . The Netherlands , Germany and France , the teams that finished second through fourth in Barcelona , last summer urged the IPC to give the United States due_process . They want a resolution so the medals , now held_in a safe-deposit_box in the Sheffield bank , finally can be distributed . Some officials are concerned that any standards short of those imposed by the International Olympic Committee would create a credibility problem for disabled athletes striving to be recognized as equals . &quot; We can ' t fall_into that naive trap , &quot; Steadward said . &quot; Years ago , people with disabilities used to be_on all sorts of drugs for all sorts of reasons . We found as our sport grew more from a rehabilitation mentality to a sporting environment . . . there was less need to take a lot of drugs. &quot; Whereas Kiley and his supporters want a list of banned drugs that differs from the roster used by the able-bodied , they want the same standards of punishment and protocol . During last summer ' s World Cup soccer championships in the United States , Kiley watched with interest as the sport ' s most famous player , Diego Maradona , was withdrawn by Argentina after testing positive for stimulants . Argentina was allowed to continue playing , however . Maradona , who was once suspended for using cocaine , received a 15-month ban . &quot; My own country gave me a two-year suspension and gave my coach a four-year suspension , &quot; Kiley said . &quot; You can ' t just take any guilt and hand_down a punishment of the highest level of which there is no precedent in able-bodied or disabled ( sport ) . &quot; That punishment has caused Kiley 2 1 / 2 years of pain , but until the medals are returned it will not end . &quot; The heaviest price is the nightmare of it all , &quot; Kiley said . The nightmare of awaking in pain.DRUG TESTS</TEXT>
