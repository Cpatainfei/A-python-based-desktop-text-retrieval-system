   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; STUNNING EU PARLIAMENT OUTCOME REVERBERATES THROUGH A CONTINENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Direct elections to the European Parliament are barely 15 years old and have been of only marginal importance . But results of Sunday ' s voting for the 567-seat house have sent political shock_waves rumbling through the Continent ' s Western half . In part , the election had greater significance because the stakes are higher : Not only is Europe in the midst of its greatest transition since it was first divided by the Cold_War more_than four decades ago , but the European Parliament has also begun to assume some genuine power . For many , however , the importance was not only that moderate , mainstream parties managed to keep control of the remote Strasbourg , France-based Parliament , which serves as the European Union ' s legislature , at a time when Western Europe has again begun flirting_with political extremes . It also quickly became clear that the effect of Sunday ' s election results on the national political landscapes of the 12 member countries was considerable . Although he wasn ' t even a candidate for the Parliament , the biggest single winner may have been German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , now in the midst of a tough Bundestag reelection campaign . Surveys in recent weeks had indicated that Kohl ' s Christian Democrats were gaining_ground on the front-running opposition Social Democrats . But the extent of his party ' s strength in winning almost half of Germany ' s 99 seats in the European Parliament was largely unexpected . The chancellor , who a_few short months ago hardly seemed to have a chance at reelection , suddenly faced the problem Monday of dampening the euphoria of excited supporters . &quot; Yesterday ' s victory doesn ' t mean we can relax , &quot; Kohl said . &quot; We have to fight for every vote. &quot; Only the abysmal showing of Kohl ' s junior coalition partner , the Free Democrats , provided cause for worry . The Free Democrats -- the party of Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his predecessor , Hans-Dietrich Genscher -- won fewer votes than the retooled East_German Communist_Party and failed to get the 5 % necessary under German law to win any seats . The result was a shock for a party that has been in every Bonn government since 1969 ; it left the chancellor ' s supporters concerned , because without the Free Democrats , Kohl ' s own party would find it extremely difficult to build a majority coalition in October . * The reasons for Kohl ' s turnaround seem twofold and have little to do with his party ' s European policies : * Germany ' s gradual emergence from its deepest recession since the Wirtschaftswunder -- Germany ' s miraculous postwar ascension to economic power -- has revived confidence in his leadership . * A series of campaign blunders by the Social Democrats . These include a damaging internal feud in the party ' s platform-drafting committee last April and comments by party leader Rudolf Scharping that made him appear a poor loser after last month ' s presidential elections . Another definite winner in Monday ' s election was Italy ' s new premier , Silvo Berlusconi , and his Forza Italia ( Go Italy ) , a party that is less than a year old but already the bulwark of the government and a magnet for discontented voters . With Berlusconi heading the ticket , Forza Italia won 30.6 % of the European Parliament votes , an increase of almost 50 % over its winning general_election performance in March . His controversial coalition allies , the federal Northern League ( 6.6 % ) and the neo-fascist National Alliance ( 12.5 % ) , both lost ground compared with their showings in March . The Italian vote gave a powerful endorsement to Berlusconi ' s search for free-market change and government efficiency . It also reaffirmed the Democratic Party of the Left , the former Communist_Party , as the strongest opposition force with 19.1 % . Achille Occhetto had led the Democratic Party of the Left to a new name and a new image but proved unable to overcome its also-ran status . On Monday , he quit , acknowledging that the party needs new leadership to remain a viable alternative to conservative rule . But if Kohl and Berlusconi were winners , the biggest losers in Sunday ' s election were easily British Prime_Minister John Major and his Spanish counterpart , Felipe Gonzalez . In an admittedly low turnout , Major ' s Conservative_Party managed to gather only 28 % of the vote , the worst Tory showing in nationwide polling since 1945 . The results left Labor as the largest single national party represented in the Strasbourg Parliament , with 62 of Britain ' s 87 seats . The Conservatives will have 18 seats . &quot; The fact is , &quot; said acting Labor_Party leader Margaret Beckett , &quot; that last night ' s results showed the mantle of trust has passed firmly to Labor. &quot; Spain ' s Gonzalez had limped to a new term in elections a year ago by outpointing Popular Party conservatives headed by Jose Maria Aznar . On Sunday , voters sent Gonzalez -- who has been in power for a dozen years -- an unmistakable message , sending Conservatives to Strasbourg by a 4-3 margin . Observers in Madrid say the conservative victory could force early elections in Spain , either this fall or next spring . * Marshall reported from Brussels and Montalbano reported from Rome . Times staff writers Marjorie Miller in Bonn and William Tuohy in London and Isabelle Maelcamp of The Times ' Brussels bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
