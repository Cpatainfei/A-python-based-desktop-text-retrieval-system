   <HEADLINE> DOING BUSINESS ALONG A HIGH-ALTITUDE HIGHWAY ; COMMERCE : ABOUT 2.8 BILLION POUNDS OF CARGO MOVES THROUGH LAX EACH YEAR , FROM APPAREL TO EQUIPMENT TO ANIMALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> David Hasenauer is in a hurry . He has to get_to Los Angeles International Airport to meet a flying horse . Actually , Hasenauer is meeting five flying horses , all_of them inbound to LAX from Auckland , New Zealand , aboard an Emery Worldwide Airlines DC-8 cargo plane . Their owners have paid something in the neighborhood of $ 5 # 000 each to have them shipped to the United States by air , instead of saving money by putting them on a ship for a two-week transpacific voyage . It ' s Hasenauer ' s job to pick them up at the airport . So Hasenauer , president of an animal air-shipping company called Jet Pets Inc. , hops in his pickup_truck and heads for a dilapidated former Nike missile site in a remote corner of LAX . The DC-8 lands and then taxis onto the apron , and with Hasenauer carefully eyeing the cargo , handlers start unloading -- first some pallets piled high with bulk cargo and then the horses , which are in large open-topped wooden shipping boxes , three in one box , two in the other . They ' re accompanied by a New Zealander groom , Bernie Hackett . Hackett says the horses did just fine . Top shape . No problems . They didn ' t even get airsick , although he admits it ' s a little hard to tell if a horse is airsick , considering that horses can ' t throw_up . &quot; We handle about 700 or 800 horses a year , &quot; Hasenauer said . &quot; A lot of horses get sent to Japan or Australia for races or shows . They ' re flying all_the time . Some of them have more flying miles behind them than most people do. &quot; Meanwhile , thousands more horses pass_through LAX on domestic_flights every year . So do sheep , goats , fish , cattle , parrots , chickens -- well , just about everything that walks , crawls or flies . They are all air cargo . And that ' s just the living , breathing part of the LAX air cargo world . Although most people think_of LAX as a place that moves people , it also moves an astonishing array and volume of freight -- about 2.8 billion pounds of cargo every year -- everything from horses to textiles and soup to nuts , a little more_than half of it packed in the bellies of commercial airliners along with your luggage , the rest in cargo aircraft . LAX is now the busiest air cargo center in the nation . Every day about 7 million pounds of air cargo goes_through LAX on 1 # 000 arriving and departing cargo and cargo-and-passenger flights . It ' s sort of like a flying warehouse in the sky . According to U.S. Department_of_Commerce figures on international imports and exports -- which account_for just under half of all LAX air cargo -- the largest imported commodity coming_through LAX was apparel , with 47 # 000 tons arriving in 1992 , the last year for which figures are available . The biggest export from LAX was 33 # 000 tons of vegetables , fruits and nuts . In that same year , 18 # 000 tons of computer equipment and parts worth about $ 2.4 billion were exported through LAX , and 24 # 000 tons of computer equipment worth about $ 3.3 billion were imported . There also were 7 # 000 tons of taps , valves , bearings and gaskets imported and exported , along with 6 # 000 tons of live animals and meat , 550 tons of feathers , artificial_flowers and wigs ; 16 # 000 tons of fish and crustaceans ; 1 # 400 tons of musical_instruments ; 1 # 100 tons of arms and munitions ; 1 # 700 tons of beverages , spirits and vinegar ; 2 # 600 tons of jewelry and coins ; 208 tons of animal and vegetable fats and oils . The list goes_on and on . There were even 57 tons of a category the Commerce_Department describes , somewhat curiously , as &quot; umbrellas , walking sticks and whips. &quot; * About 43 % of LAX air cargo exports go_to Asian_countries , with Europe and Australia / Oceania following at 35 % and 11 % , respectively . About 70 % of LAX imports come from Asia and about 17 % from Europe . Also about 175 # 000 tons of mail , domestic and international , moves through LAX every year . &quot; Anything that ' s valuable and can fit_in a plane , alive or dead , moving or not moving , comes_through here , &quot; said Rick Wells , assistant chief of airport planning for the Los Angeles Department of Airports . Sometimes the air cargo is illicit . In May , U.S. Customs agents discovered a ton of Colombian cocaine hidden in a shipment of flexible rubber tubing inbound from Mexico aboard a chartered cargo plane . So far this year , customs agents have made four seizures of drug shipments hidden in air cargo . All imported cargo passing_through LAX is subject_to U.S. Customs inspection . But with so_much cargo moving through , officials can only inspect a portion of it . &quot; It ' s a daunting task , &quot; spokesman Michael Fleming said . &quot; We have limited resources on what we can examine . The vast majority of cargo is legitimate , and we don ' t want to impede legitimate cargo , which could cause economic impacts . So we work selectively. &quot; Air cargo is an important if little known -- to the public at least -- aspect of airport operations , Wells said . It doesn ' t have the glamour of passenger operations , and thus it traditionally hasn ' t gotten as much attention from airport officials as the passenger side of the flying business . Still , as LAX air cargo tonnage has increased by about 50 % in the last decade , LAX cargo facilities have expanded to meet the demand . Gateway Freight Services Inc. , a contract cargo handler for 22 airlines that operate in and out of LAX , recently expanded its facilities . Federal Express , Japan Airlines and Qantas also plan to expand cargo handling facilities at LAX . Currently about 1.6 million square_feet of air cargo terminal space is available at LAX , about two-thirds of it used for international import-export . About 5 # 000 people in Los Angeles are directly employed in air cargo-related jobs with airline and freight companies . That represents about 10 % of the total number of people who work_at LAX . Airport officials estimate the &quot; economic impact &quot; of LAX air freight in the Los Angeles region at about $ 11 billion per year , or about $ 9 # 000 for every ton of air cargo that passes_through . * True , LAX ' s 1.4 million tons of cargo annually pales in comparison with the 75 million tons of goods that move through the Port of Los Angeles by ship every year . But the value of LAX import-export goods -- about $ 34 billion -- is a little over half of the value of goods that move through the port . In other words , air cargo may be relatively small in quantity . But pound for pound it ' s some of the most valuable cargo in the world . Generally , larger airlines with numerous LAX flights handle their own air cargo , but for smaller or foreign-based airlines with limited numbers of flights it ' s more cost-effective to contract_out their cargo handling operations to companies such_as Gateway Freight Services . &quot; Almost anything that ' s for_sale , anything people want , anywhere in the world , comes_through here , &quot; said David Abe , chief operating officer of Gateway , which handles nearly 600 million pounds of air cargo annually , making_it the largest contract air cargo handler at LAX . Abe is standing_in a 38 # 000-square-foot warehouse , one of five cargo handling centers Gateway operates at LAX . In the vast , high-ceiling building with row upon row of shelves , cargo waits to be put_on a plane or picked_up for delivery . There are pallets of pearl onions and stacked boxes of rhubarb . There ' s a box of live koi fish being shipped from Monterey Park to Seattle . There are boxes of lamb and venison from New Zealand and Australia , large slabs of tanned leather , a film canister bound for Hollywood from Portugal , boxes of men ' s belts from Italy , sealed boxes of unknown goods from India bound for the Target Stores of America , &quot; special handling &quot; boxes marked flammable and corrosive . &quot; Every single day it ' s something different , &quot; said Mark Wood , Gateway terminal manager . &quot; We ' ve had cars , reptiles from Africa , birds . Once we had a bear that was going_to the Los Angeles Zoo. &quot; Human_bodies -- dead human_bodies -- also constitute part of LAX air cargo . Exact figures aren ' t available , but airport spokesmen and air shippers say that every year hundreds of human corpses pass_through LAX , in coffins inside shipping boxes marked &quot; human remains , &quot; bound for burial in other states and countries . They are handled like any other piece of air cargo . Sending goods by air freight isn ' t cheap , compared to sea or truck or rail shipping . Prices vary widely , depending_on the weight and bulk of the shipment , but generally air freight costs three to 10 times more_than shipping by sea . Some items , such_as sea_urchins bound from California to the sushi restaurants of Japan , or prepared fugu fish from Japan bound for the Japanese restaurants of California , have to get from Point A to Point B fast or they ' ll spoil . At other times , market conditions , not perishability , make the difference . &quot; If you ' re a store owner selling winter jackets and they ' re going like hot_cakes and you need more of them , they have to get here fast , &quot; Wells said . &quot; Sure , it costs more to send by air , but they won ' t do you any good if they get here two months from now. &quot; &quot; If you need a shipment by tomorrow , then cost isn ' t really that much of a consideration , is it ? &quot; said Wayne Gatewood , office manager at Rainbow World Transport in Inglewood , one of about 300 freight forwarding companies in the Los Angeles area . * Of course , for some people cost really isn ' t a consideration . A few months ago , for example , Gatewood ' s company shipped a 48-foot horse trailer to Berlin by air freight at a cost of $ 17 # 000 -- at least three or four times what it would have cost to ship by sea . Gatewood figures that people who can afford to air ship horse trailers probably don ' t worry too_much about money in the first place . Gatewood ' s company also has shipped Harley-Davidson motorcycles to Italy , and Ferrari cars from Italy , along with 1 # 200 pounds of explosive detonators and some Italian space satellites . Sometimes people simply run_out of time and have no choice but to ship by air . that ' s what happened with Gary Harper and his $ 30 # 000 Gatling machine_gun . Harper is a Ramona gas_station owner who belongs_to a military re-enactment group called the Gordon Highlanders , who wear the uniforms of Scottish soldiers of the 1880s . They were scheduled to participate in a ceremony in Scotland , and Harper wanted to take his 4 # 000-pound Model 1874 , . 45 / 70-caliber Gatling gun . The problem was that he only had a week , and cargo_vessels couldn ' t get there that fast . Ordinarily , it would have cost Harper about $ 3 # 000 each way to air freight the Gatling gun , but only $ 300 to $ 400 by sea . But Northwest Airlines took a liking to his group and &quot; helped us out &quot; on the freight charges , Harper said . &quot; We had a time problem , &quot; Harper said . &quot; Besides , every time I ' ve ever shipped something by sea there ' s been a problem . The shipment gets damaged , or it gets wet ; it ' s always something . &quot; As far as I ' m concerned , air cargo is the only way to go. &quot;</TEXT>
