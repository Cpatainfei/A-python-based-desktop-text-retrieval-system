   <HEADLINE> IRAQI COMPLIANCE , NOT SWEET_TALK ; COPING WITH HUSSEIN ' S HEGEMONIC AMBITIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Late last Saturday , after a dozen hours of pointed argument and negotiation , the U.N. Security_Council unanimously approved a resolution condemning Iraq ' s movement of troops close to the Kuwait border and demanding not only their withdrawal but also that Iraq never again threaten its neighbors . Less than 48 hours later the consensus that put this resolution on record had fractured . Russia , which had made no effort to mask its dissatisfaction with the resolution it found expedient to support Saturday night , discovers itself in deepening disagreement with the United States and to a lesser extent Britain over where U.N. policy toward Iraq should go next . Russia ' s view , as expressed by Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev , is that the United States overreacted to what Baghdad intended to be innocent and routine military maneuvers in southern Iraq . Moreover , Iraq has made every effort to open_up certain of its most suspect military facilities to U.N. inspections . Further , it says it is conditionally prepared to recognize Kuwait ' s independence , dropping its claim that Kuwait is a separated province of Iraq . Given this moderation , Moscow says , Iraq deserves to be rewarded . Russia wants the economic sanctions against Iraq eased . Specifically , it wants the ban on its oil sales lifted . The American response , as forcefully expressed by Ambassador Madeleine Albright , is that &quot; words are cheap . Actions are the coin of the realm. &quot; Saddam Hussein trails a long and sordid record of meaningless promises and bogus assurances that can ' t be erased by yet more consoling lies and deceptive sweet_talk . What Washington demands is_full Iraqi compliance -- actions , not words -- with relevant U.N. resolutions . For starters , that means unequivocal recognition of Kuwait ' s independence and international borders . That , along with other appropriate unconditional actions , must precede any end to the embargo . Iraq ' s rubber-stamp parliament had the chance a_few days ago to renounce the claim to Kuwait . It didn ' t do so . Its deputy prime_minister , Tarik Aziz , had the opportunity to underscore Iraq ' s honorable intentions when he spoke_to the Security_Council on Monday . He did not do so . Russia has powerful commercial reasons -- Baghdad has promised it both debt repayment and lucrative contracts -- for seeking a softer approach toward Iraq . But Washington has a more compelling motivation for insisting that Iraq abide_by the U.N. resolutions : Neither this country nor its allies want to fight a second Persian_Gulf_war in response to Saddam Hussein ' s hegemonic ambitions . That really is what the debate over lifting the sanctions is about .</TEXT>
