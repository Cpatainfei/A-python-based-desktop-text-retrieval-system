   <HEADLINE> TRUE TO HIS FRIGHTFUL VISIONS ; GUILLERMO DEL TORO BRINGS A MEXICAN PERSPECTIVE TO HORROR FILMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Guillermo del Toro ' s passion for horror movies began at the age of 4 , when he made a deal with the monsters that haunted him through the night : He would become their best_friend if they would let him go_to the bathroom in peace . Two years later he began collecting his first horror-genre videos ; at 8 he made his first home_movie , and at 28 his first feature . &quot; Cronos , &quot; a film that Del Toro says is a cross between a classic horror film and a melodrama , has already been widely honored in Del Toro ' s native Mexico and abroad . In Guadalajara , Del Toro ' s hometown , the film grossed three times what &quot; The Fugitive &quot; did ; in Mexico_City , the film received nine Ariel awards last year , the highest honor in Mexican film , and was Mexico ' s official entry to the best foreign film category of the 1993 Academy Awards ; it won the Critics ' Week competition at last year ' s Cannes Film Festival and is being distributed in the United States by October Films , opening Friday at selected theaters in Southern California . Del Toro , who is now 29 , studied screenwriting with veteran director Jaime Humberto Hermosillo , known for such films as &quot; Dona Herlinda and Her Son , &quot; and &quot; The Homework , &quot; and learned the craft of makeup and special_effects in New York with Oscar winner Dick Smith . At present , Del Toro is director of the production department at the University of Guadalajara , one of the most important film schools in Mexico . &quot; Cronos , &quot; its director says somewhat cryptically , &quot; is an irreverent love_letter written with a great_deal of affection. &quot; It takes_place in 1997 , in a &quot; non-futuristic NAFTA Mexico , &quot; Del Toro says , and tells the story of an antiques dealer who discovers an object created by a 16th-Century alchemist from Veracruz . The device gives eternal_life to its owner but with one stipulation : He or she must feed_on human blood . The film gradually -- and creepily -- reveals the secrets of this fantastic device and how it affects the lives of those who encounter it : the antiques dealer , played by Argentine actor Federico Luppi ; his wife ( Margarita Isabel ) and their 5-year-old granddaughter ( Tamara Shanath ) . Others desperate to get their hands on the device include American actor Ron Perlman in the role of Angel de la Guardia , and his uncle , businessman Dieter de la Guardia , played by Claudio Brook . Dieter , who is terminally ill , has in his possession the diary of the alchemist , which includes detailed instructions of the use of the device , and will stop at nothing to get_it . Del Toro believes his picture breaks_with the traditional structure of old Mexican horror films . For one thing , he says , the villains are American and speak English ; the heroes are Latino and speak Spanish . And while he enjoys working in Hollywood , this perspective is not a surprise ; Del Toro prefers a distinctively Latino viewpoint . &quot; The problem with making movies in the U.S. is always creative : The stories repeat themselves again and again , &quot; he says . &quot; In Mexico none of the films of recent years resemble one another . Our only problem is finding the money to shoot. &quot; &quot; Cronos &quot; is the second most expensive Mexican film ever , after &quot; Like Water for Chocolate , &quot; with a budget of $ 2 million . Its nine-week schedule was considerably longer than that of the average Mexican movie ; extensive special_effects as well as foreign actors , like Luppi and Perlman , added_to the budget of the film , which was made in Mexico_City . Raising the money for this project was the work of producer Berta Navarro , who from the beginning was convinced that the film needed to be an international co-production with an eye toward a high profile outside Mexico . Navarro has a great_deal of experience in Mexican film : Her first production was the drama &quot; Reed : Mexico Insurgente , &quot; based on American journalist John Reed ' s book about covering the Mexican_Revolution , directed by Paul Leduc , and she has gone_on to produce many Mexican and American projects , including 1992 ' s &quot; Cabeza de Vaca. &quot; * Navarro believes film in Mexico is restructuring itself . &quot; Our movies are playing_around the world , &quot; she says , &quot; and although we still don ' t have a consolidated film_industry , this doesn ' t mean we will not have one in the near future. &quot; Principal photography began in February , 1992 , and , after post-production in Los Angeles , the film was finished by September . Del Toro specifically acknowledges the film ' s cinematographer , Guillermo Navarro , also known for his work in &quot; Love Around the Corner , &quot; &quot; Cabeza de Vaca &quot; and more recently &quot; The Cisco Kid , &quot; directed by Luis Valdez for TNT . Brigitte Broch was the art_director ; the original score , filled with polkas , cumbias and tangos , was composed by Javier Alvarez . Del Toro claims that , unlike other Mexican filmmakers who have relocated to Los Angeles , his interest in Hollywood is merely part of his learning experience . And although his movies may have international appeal , they also have &quot; a very Latin_American vision . . . . I am interested in making movies here in Los Angeles , but , of course , that ' s what airplanes are for . I always want to return home because my heart and my people are there. &quot; Del Toro is now in Mexico preparing &quot; The Devil ' s Backbone , &quot; a drama , and is developing a project for the American market , &quot; Meat Market : A Love_Story , &quot; about an employee of a butcher_shop who falls_in_love with his boss ' s wife . Also in the works is a joint project with directors Dana Rotberg ( &quot; Angel of Fire &quot; ) and Alfonso Cuaron ( &quot; Love in the Time of Hysteria &quot; ) , exploring the theme of Mexico ' s Day of the Dead .</TEXT>
