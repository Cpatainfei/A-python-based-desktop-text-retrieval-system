   <HEADLINE> A CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY HANGS OVER MEXICAN ELECTIONS ; POLITICS : FOLLOWING THE SLAYING OF LUIS DONALDO COLOSIO , CONGRESS QUIETLY PASSES REFORM PACKAGE . CRITICS SAY THE CHANGES ARE NOT ENOUGH TO GUARANTEE CLEAN VOTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mexicans began the traditional Easter week vacation Saturday under a cloud of uncertainty caused by the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio and apprehension about its effects on Aug . 21 federal elections . Concerns about whether the elections will be free_of fraud and how voters will react if they are not have been fueled by Wednesday ' s assassination of Colosio , presidential candidate of the ruling party . While the rest of the nation mourned Colosio last week , the Mexican Congress quietly passed a long-anticipated electoral reform package aimed at ensuring that those elections will be fair . The reforms were originally considered a response to demands for democracy raised by rebels who briefly took several towns in the southern state of Chiapas on Jan . 1 . But they have taken_on an added significance in the wake of Colosio ' s death and the questions it has raised about the Mexican political_system , which is dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) that has stayed in power for six decades through a combination of patronage , co-optation and vote fraud . The changes were the most extensive of the three reform packages enacted during President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s administration . But they are not enough to guarantee the clean elections needed to democratize the country , some critics have said . In another development Saturday , some of Mexico ' s most prominent political figures paraded through Salinas ' office in the presidential residence in a condensed version of the traditional consultations that precede the nomination of the ruling party ' s candidate for president . None of those who spoke with Salinas would comment on their conversations . Because the PRI has not lost a presidential election in its 65-year history , the party ' s nominee automatically becomes the front-runner , making the selection a matter of intense national interest . Callers to a radio talk_show made pitches for their favorite potential candidates , while some party activists publicly declared support for PRI Chairman Fernando Ortiz Arana -- even as party leaders insisted on silence about the subject . PRI leaders issued a statement from Ortiz Arana &quot; disauthorizing any expression of support in favor of any person whatsoever until the party . . . sets the terms for its internal process. &quot; Also Saturday , the Defense Ministry denied accusations made by the southern rebels that the Mexican army has bombed areas in guerrilla-held territory or is planning a new attack . The ministry reiterated its support for efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Chiapas . Government peace envoy Manuel Camacho Solis said he has passed that message on to the rebels , who call themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army . The Zapatistas said in a communique Friday that they have broken_off their consultations with grass-roots supporters on last month ' s government peace proposal because they believe the army plans to attack them . The continuing problems in Chiapas and disquiet over the selection of the new PRI candidate cast a cloud_over the traditional Easter week holiday spirit . Legislators had hoped that the special congressional session called to approve electoral reforms would have provided reassurance that the country was moving toward a democratic opening . Senate majority_leader Carlos Jimenez Macias said the reforms , approved late Thursday , had promised to foster &quot; a climate of respect , tolerance , dialogue and the adoption of agreements that guarantee the widest civil_liberties and solid social stability in the Aug . 21 elections. &quot; But he added that &quot; the deplorable exercise of violence that cut_short the life of Luis Donaldo Colosio resurrects a grave risk of political backsliding. &quot; The reforms give citizens not affiliated with political_parties the majority of votes on the 11-person Federal Electoral Commission , the agency that will run the election . They also provide_for a limited audit of voter registration lists and a special prosecutor to enforce stricter penalties for election_fraud . The reforms submitted to the Mexican Congress were reached in negotiations among the Interior Ministry and the three major parties : the PRI ; National Action Party , known as PAN , and Democratic Revolutionary Party , known as the PRD . Nevertheless , PRD presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , who many Mexicans believe lost the 1988 presidential race because of fraud , said the reforms do not go_far enough . &quot; I support measures that will guarantee clean elections , &quot; he said , &quot; but I cannot recognize as such measures that pretend to assure clean elections on Aug . 21 when they are nothing more_than limited changes that do not correct at their roots the rigidity and partiality of electoral structures and mechanisms. &quot; Cardenas presented a seven-point objection to the reforms , including concerns that the interior minister will still be_on the electoral commission -- limiting its independence from the government .</TEXT>
