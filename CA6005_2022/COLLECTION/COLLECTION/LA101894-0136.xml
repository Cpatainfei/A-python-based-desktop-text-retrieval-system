   <HEADLINE> U.S. AND RUSSIA EXCHANGE BARBS OVER IRAQ AT U.N.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev exchanged bristling barbs Monday in a rare public session of the Security_Council that laid bare the deep divisions at the United Nations over lifting sanctions on Iraq . Kozyrev wants the Security_Council to start discussing eventual lifting of sanctions , and Albright insists that sanctions cannot be lifted until Saddam Hussein earns the trust of the members by complying with all U.N. resolutions . Kozyrev asked_for the session to report on his Thursday meeting with Hussein in Baghdad , in which the Iraqi president announced his &quot; readiness to resolve in a positive manner the issue of recognizing Kuwait ' s sovereignty and borders , &quot; and the Russian foreign_minister promised to work toward lifting oil sanctions if Iraq cooperates for six months with a U.N. weapons-monitoring program . Meanwhile , Tarik Aziz , the deputy prime_minister who serves as Hussein ' s main voice to the West , ignored demands for proof that Iraq ' s promised recognition of Kuwait is genuine . While both the American and Russian diplomats at the Security_Council professed that their differences reflected the disagreements of close friends , the United Nations had not seen such open argument between a Russian and an American ambassador since the days of the Cold_War . Kozyrev , in fact , cast doubt on the Clinton_Administration ' s perception of the recent Iraqi military maneuvers in the southern part of the country as a threat to Kuwait and to peace in the area . He did not , however , repeat his accusation , made to Moscow reporters , that the American military response had &quot; an element of theatrical dramatization. &quot; &quot; A number of states , including Russia , had information concerning movements of troops planned by Iraq , &quot; the Russian foreign_minister told the Security_Council . &quot; . . . And there were reports to the effect that Iraq was not planning to attack Kuwait . That information was available to many states. &quot; This drew a sharp response from Albright . &quot; I hope that no government on this council seriously doubts the danger that we avoided last week , &quot; she said . &quot; The military threat was real. &quot; She said that only the American-led military buildup had deterred the Iraqis . Although she did not offer any more details to the council , the Pentagon reported in Washington that Iraqi forces were continuing to retreat from the area around Nasiriyah where they had dug_in during the weekend , easing the tensions in the region . Authorities said the withdrawal was likely to be over within a day or two . Kozyrev had sharp comments for the swiftness with which American officials dismissed his agreement with Hussein . He said some of the condemnations came even before the officials had read the communique . &quot; I hope that these inadequate and misguided assessments can be written_off as a result of the intensity of the crisis and of those emotions which overcame all_of us at that time , &quot; he said . The Russian foreign_minister then repeated the argument of the communique : The Security_Council should lift the embargo on oil if Iraq cooperates for six months with the U.N. monitors trying to make_sure that Hussein does not embark_on a massive rearmament program . &quot; The Security_Council must be ready to take yes for an answer , &quot; he said . &quot; If Iraq really complies with all_the demands in all_of the resolutions , then , of course , the present sanction system loses its sense. &quot; Albright , however , repeated the longstanding American position that no matter what the fine print of the resolution , it makes no sense to lift any sanctions until Hussein complies with all resolutions . &quot; The basic premise we have heard from some , &quot; she said , &quot; is that Iraq should be rewarded for partial compliance with some of its obligations . The council should categorically reject that approach . . . . Iraq must_not be led to believe that it can choose in an a_la_carte fashion among these obligations. &quot; She maintained , moreover , that Iraqi credibility is so low that if the United Nations followed Kozyrev ' s approach and lifted oil sanctions , Iraq could not be trusted to continue cooperating with a U.N. monitoring system afterward . During the debate , in which French Ambassador Jean-Bertrand Merimee supported the Russian position and British Ambassador David Hannay supported the American position , almost all ambassadors insisted that Iraq must recognize Kuwait in accordance with the Iraqi constitution -- through proclamations by Baghdad ' s Revolutionary Command Council and Parliament . Although Deputy Prime_Minister Aziz told reporters this was &quot; under_consideration , &quot; he made no such pledge to the Security_Council . This prompted Albright to tell the council , &quot; We simply cannot trust words and stated intentions from an Iraq which has shown its continued disdain for adherence to its commitments . Words are cheap . Actions are the coin of the realm. &quot; Hannay even implied that it would be difficult to lift sanctions so_long as Hussein ruled Iraq . He insisted that the lifting of sanctions would depend_on answers to questions like how to prevent Iraq from regaining enough strength to turn against its neighbors in the future . &quot; One thing , however , is clear , &quot; he said , &quot; and that is that the continued presence of Saddam Hussein as president of Iraq makes these questions more difficult to answer satisfactorily. &quot; In Baghdad on Monday , the Parliament met to consider Iraq ' s relations with the United Nations and other topics , adjourning without revealing whether it had voted on the U.N. demand that Iraq recognize Kuwait . But the Iraqi government stepped_up its public relations efforts to increase pressure for a lifting of sanctions , saying that the embargo amounted to &quot; killing people in_order to achieve a political end. &quot; Meeting with Western reporters Monday night , Trade Minister Mohammed Saleh sounded alternately self-pitying and defiant . He called Iraq &quot; one of the richest countries in the world &quot; and then added : &quot; But now Iraq is not even able to provide_for its own people. &quot; Saleh appeared with what he said was a monthly government food ration package on a conference_table . It was made_up of less than half a bottle of cooking_oil , some plastic bags of rice and flour , several cans of baby milk and some_other goods -- all amounting , he said , to little more_than a third of the requirements for a single person . Times staff writers Edwin Chen in Baghdad , Sonni Efron in Moscow and Art Pine and Doyle McManus in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
