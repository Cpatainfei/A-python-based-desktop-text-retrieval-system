   <HEADLINE> PALESTINIAN PRISONERS STILL ABUSED , ISRAELI GROUP SAYS ; MIDEAST : HUMAN_RIGHTS ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT USING TORTURE IN INTERROGATIONS PRODUCES ' A VICTORY FOR TERRORISM. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite ongoing peace negotiations , Israel ' s security services continue to torture Palestinian prisoners routinely , an Israeli human_rights group charged Wednesday . With Islamic militants mounting deadly suicide attacks against Israeli civilian and military targets , many Israelis may_not be sympathetic to complaints about the abuse of prisoners , acknowledged Yuval Ginbar , author of the report issued by the B ' tselem organization and released at a news_conference . &quot; These are tough times , &quot; Ginbar said . &quot; And as always , B ' tselem is stuck between a rock and a hard place. &quot; But the group believes , he said , that using torture in interrogations produces &quot; a victory for terrorism. &quot; B ' tselem alleged that interrogators for the General Security Services -- also known as the Shabak , or Shin Bet -- and the army routinely subject prisoners to sleep deprivation , humiliation , physical abuse and threats . The organization first made such charges in 1991 . Its periodic reports since then have always been rejected by the army . &quot; The IDF ( Israel Defense Forces ) has a clear and strict set of regulations governing actions permitted , as well as behavior prohibited , during questioning in IDF detention facilities , &quot; the army spokesman ' s office said in a written response to B ' tselem ' s latest charges . &quot; These rules determine that violence , threat of violence or any kind of humiliation or degradation may_not be used against a person being questioned . These rules , in their most updated version , are in_effect in every facility used for questioning by the IDF. &quot; The Shin Bet made no comment on the report . Ginbar and other B ' tselem officials criticized the government for recently approving new , secret methods of interrogation to cope_with the suicide bombings . Justice Minister David Libai has said that even the new methods fall within the boundaries of guidelines issued by the Landau Commission . In 1987 , the Landau Commission , a blue-ribbon panel , issued interrogation guidelines that allowed_for &quot; moderate physical pressure &quot; on prisoners during interrogations when circumstances required security_forces to extract information from suspects quickly in_order to save lives . This became known as the &quot; ticking bomb &quot; scenario . There is a national near-consensus that all means of interrogation are justified in such circumstances , said Yizhar Be ' er , B ' tselem ' s director . &quot; Lately , it has been said that the whole reality that we are living_in is a ticking bomb , &quot; he said . The Landau Commission said that even in a &quot; ticking bomb &quot; scenario , &quot; the pressure must_not attain the degree of physical torture or brutality or severe harm to ( a prisoner ' s ) dignity that deprives him of his humanity. &quot; The government has insisted since then that it follows the commission ' s guidelines . B ' tselem disputes the government ' s contention . &quot; Application of the recommendations resulted in the opposite ( result ) of that intended , &quot; B ' tselem alleged in its report . Now , prisoners are routinely subjected_to physical pressure , even in cases where they are ultimately released without charge , B ' tselem alleged . &quot; Where are our smart interrogators ? &quot; Ginbar asked at the news_conference . &quot; Where are interrogators who can extract information out of people by using sophisticated means ? Now , it seems , from the testimony that we have , that in_order to become a Shin Bet interrogator , you have to speak Arabic -- especially curse_words -- and you have to be strong physically. &quot; In the report issued Wednesday , B ' tselem said that its workers interviewed seven Palestinians and took sworn testimony from two others on the conditions they experienced during interrogations between May and September of 1994 . Only five of the nine prisoners mentioned in the report allowed their names to be used . One prisoner remains in detention . Seven others were released with no charges filed . One was convicted of minor offenses .</TEXT>
