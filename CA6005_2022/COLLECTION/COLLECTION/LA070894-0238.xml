   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS ORDERED FOR AIRPORT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Burbank Airport will conduct a structural analysis of its main terminal to comply with a local seismic safety ordinance , officials said this week . The airport was given_notice by the city of Burbank that it must complete a detailed engineering study by Aug . 1.The analysis is required for all non-reinforced masonry structures built before 1933 . The airport ' s main terminal opened in 1930 . Airport spokesman Victor Gill said the airport has hired an engineering consultant to assist with the study , which will also outline plans to retrofit the building to seismic standards . Although the airport was first notified three years ago that it would have to perform a structural analysis , officials declined to do so , calling it an &quot; unnecessary expenditure &quot; for a facility soon to be demolished for a new terminal . However , last month the city told the airport it would have to comply . Although they have agreed to conduct the analysis , airport officials note that the terminal has been strengthened in past years and that the building suffered no damage in the Northridge earthquake . Officials estimate that retrofitting the building could cost millions of dollars . HENRY CHU</TEXT>
