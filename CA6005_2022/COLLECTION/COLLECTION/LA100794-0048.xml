   <HEADLINE> AH , THE POWERFUL LURE OF THE FREEBIE ; POLITICS : HISTORY IS FULL OF WASHINGTONIANS WHO MISUSE THE PRIVILEGES OF POWER . BUT IS IT CORRUPTION OR PLAIN OLD SLOPPINESS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mike Espy , as they say , had everything going_for him . The first African American elected to Congress from Mississippi since Reconstruction , the youngest member of the Clinton Cabinet , he was getting good marks as Agriculture_Secretary until , investigators say , he started accepting small favors from Tyson Foods Inc. , the giant poultry processor his department is supposed to regulate . With that , Espy , who resigned Monday effective Dec . 31 , joined the ranks of supposedly savvy politicians who , in the harsh klieg_lights of Washington , proved themselves not ready for prime_time . From Sherman Adams , President Dwight D . Eisenhower ' s chief aide , who received an infamous vicuna coat , to President George_Bush ' s Chief_of_Staff John Sununu , who used military transportation to go_to stamp shows and the dentist , Washington history is replete with once powerful people who overstepped the line . &quot; It ' s a fairly common problem that you generally see at the beginning of every Administration as people come_in from the outside , &quot; said Marlin Fitzwater , a Washington veteran who was Bush ' s press secretary . &quot; In the business and the academic world , these things ( free trips and the_like ) are a recognized form of compensation. &quot; Such freebies have also been characteristic of the Congress , where Espy served into a fourth term before resigning to take the agriculture post . A number of Washington hands have suggested that his downfall resulted from bringing his Congressional ethics , or lack thereof , with him . &quot; He came_to the executive_branch via the legislative_branch and did not realize that the easy virtue of a legislator would have to change , &quot; theorized Stephen Hess , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . &quot; The type of scrutiny you get_in the executive_branch at a high level is unique , &quot; Hess continued . &quot; It doesn ' t come_to businessmen , university professors or even congressmen by and large. &quot; Still , the Espy affair is atypical , said longtime lobbyist Tom Korologos . &quot; The guys who get_in trouble in this town are the ones who ' ve never been here before . Suddenly , they have an official car , they eat_in the White_House mess and go_to the Kennedy Center . &quot; that ' s why this Espy thing is so mysterious , &quot; Korologos said . &quot; I don ' t understand how a pro like him could get_in trouble like this . Maybe he ' s the exception that proves the rule. &quot; The Reagan_Administration holds the modern record for appointees who slipped_up on ethical or other grounds . National Security Adviser Richard Allen had to make a quick exit in 1981 after it was revealed that he took $ 1 # 000 from Japanese journalists seeking an interview with Nancy Reagan . And who can forget Interior_Secretary James Watt ' s 1983 boast that he had appointed &quot; a black , a woman , two Jews and a cripple &quot; to an advisory commission -- a comment that even in those politically less correct days had him cleaning_out his desk forthwith . Reagan ' s first Attorney_General , William French Smith , resigned under press criticism for personal tax matters . His successor , Edwin Meese , survived almost until the end of Reagan ' s second term but was under almost continual investigation because of accusations of corruption and conflicts_of_interest ; he was never charged . The Reagan_Administration also holds the dubious distinction of being the only one to have had a Cabinet member step_down because of a criminal indictment . The 1984 charges against Secretary_of_Labor Raymond Donovan predated his Washington days . Donovan , a former New Jersey construction company executive , was alleged to have defrauded New York City of more_than $ 7 million on a subway project . He was acquitted . * President Clinton promised during his campaign to &quot; do better &quot; than the Republicans on ethical as well as policy matters . So when longtime Arkansas friend David Watkins was revealed last summer to have used the President ' s helicopter twice to go play golf -- at a cost to the taxpayers of more_than $ 13 # 000 -- he was forced_out as White_House director of administration . This week , government officials confirmed that General Services Administration chief Roger W . Johnson , former chairman of Western Digital Corp . in Irvine , is under investigation for the second time in his tenure over allegations that he misused his government position for personal benefit . An agency spokeswoman attributed it to &quot; unfamiliarity with the rules. &quot; White_House overzealousness in attempting to contain the Whitewater affair has caused the most casualties , among them White_House counsel Bernard Nussbaum and Deputy Treasury_Secretary Roger Altman . Altman , another political pro and Friend of Bill who , like Espy , seemed to have everything going_for him , was caught telling less than the whole truth about his Whitewater dealings to the Senate Banking Committee . Despite the irony of the fact that several of his chief accusers have themselves been investigated for alleged ethical misconduct , Altman , a former Wall_Street executive and Treasury official under President Jimmy_Carter , is leaving . * Meanwhile , his boss , Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , a former Senator and the archetypal Washington old_hand , whom Altman had apparently expected to replace , remains firmly entrenched . What distinguishes those who self-destruct from the_likes_of Bentsen or former White_House counsel Lloyd Cutler , whose Washington shelf_life seems to go_on forever ? &quot; Some people are very narcissistic and entitled and feel they deserve to be in a power position and don ' t need to hold to the same rules that others do , &quot; said Dr. Susan J . Fiester , a psychiatrist who gained her own measure of fame when she aided in the defense of the knife-wielding Lorena Bobbitt . While declining to characterize Espy or others she has not met , Fiester said that some politicians , like people in other fields , have a hard_time setting boundaries for personal conduct . &quot; There are a whole bunch of people who are personally corrupt , &quot; she said . &quot; On the other hand , some people are just sloppy. &quot;</TEXT>
