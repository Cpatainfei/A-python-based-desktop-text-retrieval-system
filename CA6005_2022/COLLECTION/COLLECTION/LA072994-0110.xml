   <HEADLINE> PLAYERS CALL FOR AUG . 12 WALKOUT DATE ; BASEBALL : WITH SEASON IN JEOPARDY , PLAYERS HAVE $ 175-MILLION STRIKE FUND , AND OWNERS FACE LOSS OF $ 140 MILLION IN POSTSEASON REVENUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Major_League Players Assn. , in a conference_call among union leaders and the 28 player representatives Thursday , set a strike deadline of Aug . 12 , meaning the 1994 baseball_season could end in 15 days . If there is no agreement in the collective_bargaining negotiations that have polarized the two sides , there will be no games played after Aug . 11 . A long-term work_stoppage could also erase the postseason , during which the owners have $ 140 million in TV revenue at stake . &quot; We believe that the Aug . 12 date maximizes the chance of successfully negotiating an agreement without a work_stoppage , &quot; said Don Fehr , the union ' s executive_director . &quot; The purpose of setting the strike date earlier rather than later ( in the season ) is to attempt to focus and accelerate the negotiations now to see if we can get the job done . &quot; A strike is a last_resort . No one wants to play more_than the players do , but the owners continue to insist on a salary cap that would place artificial restrictions on the free market , transfer millions of dollars from players to owners , destroy free_agency , eliminate arbitration and damage competitive balance . &quot; Moreover , the owners have made_it clear that they are prepared to unilaterally implement a salary cap without the players ' consent after the season ends , which leaves us with no choice . ( Owners ' negotiator ) Dick Ravitch has said that strikes only occur when one side underestimates the leverage of the other . Sometimes they occur because somebody wants them to occur. &quot; A strike would be baseball ' s eighth work_stoppage since 1972 . It would not prevent the owners from declaring an impasse and unilaterally implementing their salary-cap system , but it would deal a blow to their wallets , threatening the final seven weeks of a season that finds at least half of the 28 teams still involved in the new division races , not to mention the revenue from the postseason . It would also be costly for the players , however . They would lose three paychecks and a portion of a fourth if an Aug . 12 stoppage wiped_out the season . The union , for the last four years , has been retaining a portion of each player ' s licensing check -- which averages between $ 70 # 000 and $ 80 # 000 annually -- while accumulating a strike fund of about $ 175 million , or about $ 150 # 000 for every player with four ' years experience . Union officials refused to reveal how that money -- there would be less , of course , for players with less experience -- would be disbursed in the event of a strike . &quot; I don ' t see how either side could hold_out more_than 30 days , &quot; said an attorney involved in the negotiations . Interim baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said he wasn ' t sure how many days would have to be lost before it became impossible to play the postseason , but the union , in an attempt to put more pressure on the owners , has instructed players not to work_out collectively during a strike . Selig acknowledged that the sides are far apart but that the setting of a strike date merely &quot; raises the anxiety level of the fans. &quot; Ravitch said : &quot; I regret that the union has such disregard for the fans . As I ' ve said repeatedly , the only way to resolve bargaining differences is at the table , and that doesn ' t change , strike or otherwise. &quot; He said he shares Fehr ' s hope that the talks will now accelerate , but &quot; we still await the union ' s response to the problems of the game . If the players are determined to test the will of the owners , they ' ll find_out soon enough that the owners are not going_to settle for anything less than a system that will allow them to fix costs . History would indicate ( that the owners ) have given_in in the past , but in my judgment it won ' t happen this time. &quot; Perhaps , but many in baseball believe Ravitch ' s most difficult task will be holding the big and small markets together . Meanwhile , in an interesting break from his normal posture , Ravitch suggested that a new system does not have to be based on a salary cap , but he refused to elaborate and said there has been no cooperation from the union in formulating a new approach and no indication that it recognizes the economic problems . This , of course , is at the heart of the debate . The union does not accept Ravitch ' s contention that 19 teams will lose money this year . Nor does the union believe that an industry with revenue of $ 1.8 billion and projected attendance again of more_than 70 million is having financial problems . &quot; We accept that revenue streams change and different clubs may have different problems from year to year , &quot; Fehr said . &quot; Nevertheless , if the owners feel the need to change their revenue-sharing formulas , we ' ll be happy to work with them on that , but don ' t ask the players to pay_for it with a salary cap . we ' ll fight that for as long as it takes. &quot; Chapter 8 ?
