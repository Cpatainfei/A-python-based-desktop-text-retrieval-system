   <HEADLINE> A STELLAR ROLE ; * THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL BE IDEAL FOR VIEWING A NEBULA AND STAR CLUSTERS -- LOCATED CLOSE TOGETHER IN THE EARLY EVENING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They go unnoticed by most of us : fuzzy patches of light dotting the night sky that appear too small to be of much importance in the universe . But if you take a moment to peek through a pair of binoculars or a telescope , you can see that some of these objects not only dwarf our own solar_system , they actually help scientists explain how our universe works . The first few weeks of April will be the last time until winter that early-evening observers can glimpse these evolving stellar stages -- called nebulae and star clusters -- so close_together . Looking west soon after sunset , seek_out the star Sirius , the brightest star in the sky , nicknamed the Dog_Star . Don ' t mistake it with the planet Venus , which is brighter and lower in the sky . Sirius lies_in the collar of the constellation Canis_Major , the Big Dog . To the right of Sirius you will find three stars in a row . This is the belt of Orion the_Hunter . Below the farthest left star in the belt is Orion ' s sword -- three faint objects descending at an angle toward the horizon . The middle star in Orion ' s sword is not a star at all , but the famous Orion Nebula , about 1 # 600 years away from us if we were traveling at the speed_of_light ( called light-years ) . A massive swarm of interstellar hydrogen gas and dust that could swallow 20 # 000 of our solar_systems , the Orion Nebula is an interstellar womb for stars . Visible as a gray filament , the Orion Nebula is collapsing through gravity to create stars powered by the fusion of hydrogen_atoms into helium . An average star like our sun takes about 50 million years to form . The Orion Nebula contains enough matter_to create hundreds of thousands of stars . Using the three belt stars of Orion to point to the right , we pass the star Aldebaran , the eye of Taurus_the_bull , and encounter a smattering of faint stars called the Pleiades . This open cluster of stars lies_about 400 light-years away . If the Orion Nebula is a stellar womb , the Pleiades could be viewed_as stars in preschool . Relatively young ( not more_than 100 million years old ) , open clusters have been nudged from their nebulae birthplace by the rotation of our Milky Way galaxy . This movement will cause the cluster to eventually dissolve . Although only seven stars are visible to the naked eye in the Pleiades , there are actually a_few hundred in the cluster , a_few dozen of which are visible with binoculars . On the opposite side of Orion lies another open cluster , called the Beehive , in the constellation of Cancer_the_Crab . At 500 light-years away , the Beehive is a challenge to spot with the naked eye . Binoculars bring many of the cluster ' s estimated 200 stars into focus . With a telescope , you can see brilliant blue-white stars , which photographs reveal to be accompanied by a faint blue nebula remnant , left from the formation of the stars . At the tip of the right horn of Taurus_the_Bull lies the Crab_Nebula , about 6 # 300 light-years away . Visible as a faint gray cloud in an eight-inch diameter telescope , this is the remnant of an exploding star that was so powerful it could be seen in daylight from Earth , in the year 1054 A.D. It is this expelled star stuff , as well as matter shed occasionally from dying , red supergiant stars like Betelgeuse ( the armpit of Orion ) , that is the seed for a new generation of stars . So if anybody asks how the universe works , just point to the sky and tell them it ' s recycling itself . WHERE AND WHEN What : Los Angeles Valley College Astronomy Club ' s monthly planetarium shows and ( weather permitting ) observing through its 16-inch telescope . Location : Valley College Planetarium and Observatory , 5800 Fulton Ave. , Van Nuys . When : The next star party is April 9 , featuring a 5:30 p.m. trek to the Mt . Wilson area . Next planetarium / observing session at the college will be at 8 p.m. April 15 . Price : Mt . Wilson trip is free . Planetarium shows are $ 3.50 general , $ 2.50 seniors and $ 2 for kids 8 to 16 . No kids younger than 8 allowed . Call : ( 818 ) 781-1200 , Ext . 335 .</TEXT>
