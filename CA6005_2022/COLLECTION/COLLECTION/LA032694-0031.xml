   <HEADLINE> HOW BEST TO HONOR COLOSIO ' S MEMORY ; LET TRAGEDY LEAD TO MEXICAN POLITICAL REFORM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Can some good come of a tragedy ? While utterly lamentable , the assassination of Mexico ' s leading presidential candidate , Luis Donaldo Colosio , also offers that nation ' s most potent political force , the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , an opportunity . PRI leaders , especially Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , would honor their slain standard-bearer if they seized it . Colosio was respected as a capable public official , but the way he got the PRI nomination was controversial . He was handpicked by Salinas under an old political tradition that Mexicans refer to as el Dedazo , which means to be touched by a very large finger . The term refers to Mexican presidents personally selecting their successors , a practice that dates_from the PRI ' s founding in 1929 . El Dedazo has been tantamount_to being elected as Mexico ' s president : The PRI is the best-organized political_party in Mexico , and the many government officials who are PRI members , including the sitting president , did not hesitate to use their power to help Colosio ' s campaign . That is why Colosio was conceded to be the front runner in the campaign for the Aug . 21 election . But it was a grudging concession among the many Mexicans who believe their nation is too modern and sophisticated to be burdened with hoary political traditions from the ' 20s . Even official PRI candidate Colosio spoke_of the need to make the electoral_system more open and democratic . When he served as PRI president in the late 1980s , he even experimented with primary_elections in which PRI candidates ran against each other for party nominations . That suggests an idea . Salinas is expected to wait until after Easter to pick a second PRI nominee . Before he does , he should heed the suggestions of Mexican intellectuals like writer Carlos Fuentes who are urging him to open_up the nomination process . Precisely how that is done -- through a primary vote or open PRI convention -- is up_to party leaders . It might require delaying the election , a move that would require approval by the Mexican Congress . But Salinas can get the process moving simply by lifting an eyebrow . He could create a wide-open presidential race in which several respected PRI members could contend for the nomination . Besides the often-mentioned former Mexico_City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis , Finance_Minister Pedro Aspe and former Education Minister Ernesto Zedillo would be formidable candidates . No doubt there are other , less well-known political_leaders who would be worthy successors to Salinas . An open , democratic process leading to the election of any of them would be a fitting tribute to Colosio .</TEXT>
