   <HEADLINE> BIRTHING BLUES ; NEW PARENTS , INSURERS AT_ODDS OVER ONE-NIGHT MATERNITY STAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Having a baby isn ' t what it used to be . Just ask Tammye Martin of Oxnard . Pampered in the hospital for two days when her son was born 2 1 / 2 years ago , last month Martin had to go_home just one day after she gave_birth to her second child , a girl . Linda Gladys Ramos of Oxnard didn ' t even get a full day in the hospital . After 11 hours of labor , she gave_birth to her first child at 6 p.m. and was sent home 18 hours later with her newborn daughter . These women didn ' t leave the hospital quickly because they are uninsured , but rather because they have coverage . Like most women having babies these days , they find themselves affected by a new and widespread policy of insurance_companies to pay_for only one night in the hospital following a normal delivery . While families and health_care_providers adjust to the new insurance payment rules , many of them decry the practice and warn that mothers and babies are put at potential risk by being sent home so quickly . As recently as two years ago , most women who had health_insurance could count_on at least a two-day stay in the hospital after giving_birth . Besides giving the woman a little time to recover from childbirth , the hospital stay enabled nurses to instruct the mother on how to care_for the baby and observe the infant for what can be subtle indications of health_problems . Now , with hospitals discharging patients as early as 11 a.m. , a child born close to midnight often is sent home when only half a day old . &quot; This is obscene and grotesque , &quot; said Dr. Kenneth Saul , a_Thousand Oaks pediatrician . &quot; There is a major risk to children who are going_home so soon if the parents are not alert to the warning signs &quot; of health_problems . Although several doctors said they could not cite examples of newborns who went_home after one-night hospital stays and experienced serious difficulties , they say that potential problems include jaundice , dehydration , heart defects and breast-feeding problems . Many physicians emphasized the need to keep the babies hospitalized longer , adding that short stays are also hard on the mothers . &quot; I think from an emotional point_of_view , my mothers aren ' t ready to leave in 24 hours , &quot; said Dr. Maynard D . Belzer , a Camarillo obstetrician . But the insurance industry defends its new policy . &quot; This is just another managed-care technique , &quot; said Dan DiFonzo , spokesman for the Health_Insurance Assn . of America , a Washington , D.C.-based organization that represents 250 small- and medium-size private insurance_companies . &quot; Mothers are just as healthy going home after one day as after two. &quot; DiFonzo said an argument can be made_for sending mothers and babies home as quickly as possible so they do not contract an airborne infection in the hospital . &quot; Insurance_companies have found it is less expensive and just as efficacious to have a woman go_home after 24 hours , &quot; he said . Martin , who delivered her daughter at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura , said she would have liked to wait an extra day before taking_home newborn daughter Christina Marie . Because this was her second child , she knew that the challenges of sleepless nights , diapers , laundry and caring for a newborn would be a major adjustment for her . &quot; I thought ( the hospital stay ) should be a little bit longer , &quot; said Martin , 31 . &quot; Mentally , I ' d probably be a lot more rested . I think I ' d feel more prepared to accept the new challenges of being a parent. &quot; That view is shared by many in the medical_community . &quot; It can be overwhelming for the mother , &quot; said JoLynn de la Torre , communications manager for Simi Valley Hospital . &quot; You ' ve gone_through a tremendous change in your body , it ' s a very emotional time , you have a lot of things to remember . All of a sudden , someone says , ' Here , Mom . You ' re home with your baby . Carry on. ' &quot; Dr. Raymond I . Poliakin , chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Los Robles Regional Medical_Center in Thousand Oaks , said some women have no trouble going_home within hours after giving_birth . Others , especially first-time mothers , are in desperate need of sleep after delivering a baby , and they are not going_to get that once they go_home . If the baby is delivered in the evening , Poliakin said , a mother typically will not fall_asleep until 4 or 5 a.m. the next day . For the woman to be sent home five or six hours later is unfair , he said . &quot; They ' ve gotten no sleep , and then they go_home to a house where they might not have someone to help them , &quot; Poliakin said . &quot; I think one good_night ' s sleep_in the hospital is what the woman needs , and it ' s typically not the first night. &quot; * Shortening the hospital stay for mothers and babies has been gradual , health workers say . At first it was just the health_maintenance_organizations , or HMOs , that dictated the one-night stay . Eventually , however , other insurance_companies changed their policies . Now , unless there is a medical reason to keep a woman longer -- such_as an infection or excessive bleeding -- almost all mothers are sent home after one night in the hospital . For insurance providers , the shorter stays can translate into thousands of dollars in savings in a year . At St . John ' s Regional Medical_Center , which has facilities in Oxnard and Camarillo , a second night ' s stay for the mother adds an average $ 400 to the bill , a hospital spokeswoman said . With 220 babies born at the two hospitals each month , the shorter stays allow insurers to cut $ 88 # 000 in monthly costs . But this puts an extra burden on hospital staffs , which are charged with educating mothers on the care of their infants as well as tending to the physical needs of babies and their mothers following childbirth . The hospitals say they give special emphasis to breast-feeding techniques and determining if a baby is getting proper nourishment . &quot; It ' s hard to give ( mothers ) adequate education and make_sure the baby is feeding correctly , &quot; said Dianne Saavedra , manager of the maternity department at Community Memorial . &quot; It ' s a lot of education to give_in a short time. &quot; Most Ventura County hospitals have adjusted to the new insurance rules by offering more extensive education classes for expectant parents , as well as follow-up instruction by telephone or in_person after a baby is born . &quot; Insurance_companies really promote the mothers taking these classes , and a lot of them make_it mandatory , &quot; said Vickie Lemmon , director of nursing for St . John ' s Regional Medical_Center in Oxnard . Many insurance_companies have contracts with the hospital and pay_for their members to take the education classes , Lemmon said . &quot; I think we ' ve learned to cope by trying to get_to the parents prenatally and offer a wide variety of classes , &quot; she said . But that alone is not enough , Lemmon acknowledged . &quot; Education before the baby is born is very , very good , but it doesn ' t in any way , shape or form address all_the situations that come_up after the baby is born , &quot; she said . Hospitals in the county said their staff_members try to call mothers a_few days after they go_home . In addition , mothers are encouraged to call the hospital day or night if they have questions or problems . * Some pediatricians are concerned that parents might not know if their baby has a health_problem that went unnoticed in the hospital during the short stay . Jaundice symptoms may_not appear in the first few hours , and congenital heart defects also may go undetected . &quot; When the baby is totally under the care of the parents , then you have to count_on the parents , &quot; said Dr. J . Andrew Huang , an Oxnard pediatrician . &quot; It just makes you more nervous. &quot; Saul said signs of dehydration and heart problems can be subtle and must be watched for closely . &quot; We just have to go_into more detail educating the mothers about how to care_for the new babies because we don ' t have the nurses to watch for things , &quot; he said . Pediatricians see their newborn patients for the first time in the hospital , and traditionally , the next doctor visit is two weeks later . Saul , however , said he sees his newborns within a_few days of the hospital discharge because he is concerned that health_problems might go unnoticed at_home . Lemmon , St . John ' s director of nursing , said she does not have those concerns . &quot; Healthy babies really transition very quickly and very well , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t think the new insurance_policy has diminished the care_for babies . I think that is why the insurance_companies have been able to revise their standards. &quot; DiFonzo , the insurance industry spokesman , said many companies will pay_for a nurse to make a home visit after the hospital discharge . But that visit does not necessarily address another concern of doctors -- that mothers will stop breast-feeding when they get home because they did not have enough help getting started . &quot; A new mom is going_to need a lot of encouragement along those lines , &quot; said Dr. Edward Gibson , an Oxnard pediatrician . &quot; Those mothers are more likely to give_up on the breast-feeding. &quot; Poliakin , the Thousand Oaks obstetrician , agreed . &quot; Breast-feeding can be a very trying and traumatic experience for first-time mothers , &quot; he said . &quot; A woman ' s expectations about breast-feeding can crumble very quickly. &quot; * Huang said that despite his concerns about the short hospital stay , &quot; I think we have to live with it because of the control of medical costs. &quot; Belzer and Saul were not as understanding . Belzer , the Camarillo obstetrician , said his patients often get angry with him when they learn how soon they must leave the hospital . If they call the insurance_company to complain , they frequently are told the dismissal date is up_to the doctor . &quot; that ' s not true at all , &quot; Belzer said . In fact , he added , a doctor who lets a patient stay longer than an insurance_company would like will receive a severe scolding , at the least , and could find his services no longer covered by the insurance_company . &quot; It ' s not up_to the doctor , &quot; Belzer said . &quot; There are certain rules. &quot; Saul was even more pointed in his anger . &quot; Basically , we have to deal with it . We just have to take the best care of the patient we can with the circumstances we ' re given , &quot; he said . &quot; But a child is being put at risk for the sole benefit of insurance executives , who are making hundreds of millions of dollars off these short stays. &quot;</TEXT>
