   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : MID-CITY : MID-CITY ; STRIKING A BLOW AGAINST SICKLE_CELL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Twenty years ago , leaders of the 1 # 600-member Los Angeles chapter of the National Bowling Assn . decided to turn their games into a fund-raiser to help combat a disease affecting their friends , family members and others within the African American community . The chapter amended its constitution to commit itself to annual charity bowling tournaments , with proceeds going toward medical research and educational materials on sickle-cell_anemia , a deadly inherited blood_disorder . The group is once again hosting a &quot; Strike for Sickle_Cell &quot; benefit , which began Saturday at Mid-Town Bowling Center , 4546 Venice Blvd . &quot; In our bowling organization , we have always had members who have had someone in the family that has suffered from sickle_cell , &quot; said Eugene Knox , president of the Los Angeles chapter of the association , founded in 1939 as the National Negro Bowling Assn . The tournament , which will run from 1 to 6 p.m. every Saturday and Sunday through Sept . 25 , will benefit the Sickle_Cell Disease Assn . of America . A $ 15 entrance_fee entitles bowlers to three games as they compete for prizes donated by the association and the community . With the exception of large groups , reservations are not necessary . Lynda K . Anderson , executive_director of the Sickle_Cell Disease Assn . of America , believes the public needs to be educated about the gravity of the illness . &quot; Now that we have ( AIDS and other ) diseases that affect the population at_large , sickle_cell disease has been put_back in the shadows , &quot; she said . Sickle_cell anemia attacks the red_blood_cells , causing them to harden and assume a curved , sickle-like shape . These cells have a tendency to get caught around the joints , causing severe and often crippling pain . Diseased cells can also form blood_clots , often leading to leg ulcers and sometimes strokes . According to the National Center for Health Statistics , 419 Americans lost their lives to sickle_cell anemia in 1991 , the latest year for which statistics are available . Of that total , 406 were African American . Information : ( 213 ) 939-8238 . LESLIE BERESTEIN</TEXT>
