   <HEADLINE> ZEDILLO FACES SHOWDOWN OVER CHIAPAS GOVERNORSHIP ; MEXICO : REBELS VOW A PARALLEL GOVERNMENT IF RULING PARTY CANDIDATE IS INAUGURATED AFTER DISPUTED ELECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Ernesto Zedillo is headed for the first showdown of his new government this week , with eleventh-hour negotiations over Chiapas ending in a tentative agreement likely to leave Mexico ' s embattled southernmost state with two governors and parallel governments . Armed rebels warned that the scheduled ruling-party gubernatorial inauguration in Chiapas on Thursday could trigger a blood bath . In a move to ease tensions , Gov.-elect Eduardo Robledo Rincon offered to take a six-year leave_of_absence from the party to prove he wants to &quot; govern for all_the people of Chiapas. &quot; After two days of weekend talks with new Interior_Secretary Esteban Moctezuma Barragan in Mexico_City , the two rivals for power in the impoverished state vowed to avoid a violent confrontation when Robledo officially takes_office . Describing the meetings as &quot; encouraging , &quot; Moctezuma said Robledo and his rival , Chiapas opposition leader Amado Avendano , agreed to a six-point accord that should guarantee a peaceful transition of power on inauguration_day . But Avendano , who claims to be the real winner of the Aug . 21 election , announced as he returned to the state that despite his promise to respect Robledo ' s inauguration , he will create a &quot; parallel government &quot; this week . He also said his supporters will go_ahead with plans for massive protests Wednesday and Thursday , which Robledo agreed to tolerate . Avendano ' s opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party insists that Robledo and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party stole the election by fraud . Asked about the implications of two governments in a state many analysts say is_on the brink of another insurrection , Avendano told reporters , &quot; Use your imagination. &quot; The post-election conflict in the state , which was the scene of an armed peasant and Indian rebellion that left more_than 145 people dead during the first 12 days of January , is seen as a key test of Zedillo ' s promise to foster a new era of political pluralism , reform and government through dialogue . It is also a test of his new government ' s ability to keep order in the nation , where similar post-election conflicts are simmering in the states of Tabasco and Jalisco . The rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army has threatened to abandon its jungle and mountain bases in Chiapas and launch a nationwide civil_war if Robledo is sworn_in Thursday . &quot; If he wishes to avoid a blood bath in these parts , it would be better that he resign this post , which he did not obtain by the will of the people , &quot; rebel leader Subcommander Marcos declared in a communique issued Monday . The threat came even as Zedillo ' s government announced the accord allowing the governor ' s inauguration to take_place . In a nationally televised speech Monday night , Zedillo did not mention Chiapas . Instead , he unveiled the first in a series of measures to reform the judiciary and create a new rule_of_law in a nation where official corruption is endemic in the police and the courts . He said he will propose the reforms to the nation ' s Congress as constitutional amendments this week . Zedillo , elected in August and inaugurated last week , plans to take his most dramatic and concrete step today toward pluralism and reform of Mexico ' s 65 years of continuous one-party national rule when he meets behind closed doors with 500 members of the national legislature . The luncheon_meeting marks the first time in Mexican history that a president will consult formally with the nation ' s elected Congress on matters of national policy . On the eve of the historic congressional session , the ruling PRI also tried to send strong signals that it would embark_on a new era of reform . Maria de los Angeles Moreno , who was elected the party ' s first female president over the weekend , declared that the party must reform or crumble . &quot; Either the party changes in response to the aspirations of its members for renewal , &quot; she said in her inauguration speech , &quot; or it becomes paralyzed under its own weight , in danger of obsolescence. &quot; But Moreno did not specify what changes she plans , and at a time when the PRI is torn from within as never before between hard-liners and reformers , her pledges of renewal were met with less than enthusiasm from the opposition .</TEXT>
