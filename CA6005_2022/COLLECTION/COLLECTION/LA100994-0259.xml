   <HEADLINE> POLICE , PROSECUTORS UNEASY PARTNERS IN SIMPSON CASE ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : LONGSTANDING TENSIONS HAVE BEEN AGGRAVATED . NEWS LEAKS , EVIDENCE HANDLING ARE SORE POINTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As partners in one of the most closely scrutinized murder trials of all time , the Los Angeles Police_Department and the district_attorney ' s office share a mission : finding and convicting the killer of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman . But as they tackle the historic case , sources in and around both agencies say Los Angeles ' largest law_enforcement institutions are moving_in opposition as well as in conjunction , blaming each other for leaks , failing to communicate about evidence and even at times undermining each other ' s efforts . In recent days , some police_officers have grumbled about the performance of Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark , Police_Chief Willie L . Williams has appeared on television and reopened a dispute about which agency is to blame for the release of controversial 911 tapes , and detectives have complained that prosecutors failed to back them in the face of a defense request for samples of their hair . Such disputes are just the latest to arise since June 13 , when the bodies of Nicole Simpson and Goldman were found slashed and stabbed to death outside her Brentwood townhouse . Top officials at each agency concede that there have been some differences but say the working relationship between the LAPD and the district_attorney ' s office is fundamentally solid . Williams and his top staff have praised prosecutors , and Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti has likewise offered public compliments about the LAPD . &quot; Certainly , there ' s going_to be times when you don ' t like something that someone may say , &quot; Williams said in an interview Friday . But &quot; the overall relationship between the district_attorney ' s ( office ) and the LAPD is very , very sound. &quot; Garcetti agreed . &quot; Anytime there ' s a long , protracted situation , there ' s going_to be issues , &quot; he said . &quot; I think we have probably the best working professional relationship that we have ever had. &quot; Nevertheless , the Simpson case has triggered a series of pointed disagreements -- perhaps the most serious of which involve news_reports . At the district_attorney ' s office , sources say prosecutors blame police for putting_out an erroneous report about DNA test results , which some believe was leaked to retaliate for a tongue-lashing that a police_detective took from Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito that same day ; at Parker Center , meanwhile , some police believe that the district_attorney ' s office leaked the same story in an effort to bolster its motion to sequester the jury . Both agencies deny any wrongdoing . Other disputes have erupted over the way detectives conducted searches in their quest to build a case against O.J. Simpson , who has proclaimed his innocence in the face of charges that he committed the double homicide . And despite their public proclamations , high-level officials from the two agencies and the city attorney ' s office continue to dispute how the tapes of dramatic 911 calls placed by Nicole Simpson in 1989 managed to be publicly released . The slip-ups and finger-pointing in the Simpson case are far from the first time that the LAPD and district_attorney ' s office have been at_odds . In fact , the relationship is rife_with discord , and several recent cases have deepened the animosity : Many police_officers were furious at prosecutors ' refusal to bring charges against entertainer Michael Jackson ; others were angry about a prolonged and aggressive investigation of a police shooting that left a woman dead atop a hospital . &quot; There ' s always been tension in the relationship , and given a case like this where everyone is watching , it ' s only gotten_worse , &quot; said former Dist . Atty . Ira Reiner , who blames the LAPD for most of the tension . &quot; Historically , the LAPD has not really been up_to the standards that the D.A. would like. &quot; Police vehemently reject that characterization and tend to belittle the district_attorney ' s office as a political creature , contrasting that with their perception of the LAPD as a professional institution largely immune to the whims of public_opinion . The combination of historical tensions and new feuding means that a sometimes divided law_enforcement team has been handed the challenge of defeating Simpson ' s battery of investigators and lawyers . Eager to sow discord and to uncover the sources of news_reports , Simpson ' s lawyers have wasted few chances to encourage mistrust among their adversaries , calling_for the attorney_general to investigate leaks and suggesting that police cannot be trusted . Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , one of Simpson ' s lead attorneys , said his side is not averse to raising issues that divide the opposition . &quot; In our position , sometimes you have to be confrontational , &quot; Cochran said . &quot; You have to put the other side on the defensive. &quot; Williams acknowledged that the defense efforts have produced some results . &quot; I think some of the differences have been exacerbated by the defense_team , &quot; the chief said . &quot; They have half_a_dozen of the best defense_attorneys in the country . . . . The defense_team is doing a very skillful and in some respects successful job of exploiting the differences. &quot; Robert L . Shapiro , Simpson ' s other lead lawyer , declined to venture a guess about the inner workings of the police and prosecution teams , but he crowed about a recent appearance by Williams on a talk_show where the 911 tapes were discussed . On one of the tapes , Nicole Simpson sobs as a man she identifies as her ex-husband shouts angrily in the background . Garcetti had previously blamed the Police_Department and the city attorney for making public the explosive tapes , which he said were released without his knowledge . Williams , however , cast the release in a far different light , suggesting that the prosecutorial agencies favored making the tapes public while police were trying to exercise restraint . In an interview last week , Williams said he had expressed reservations about making public the 911 tape but that officials from the city attorney ' s office and from the district_attorney ' s office &quot; felt that it was appropriate to release &quot; them in response to media requests for the information . &quot; The chief of police came_out and basically called Garcetti a liar , &quot; Shapiro said of Williams ' remarks . &quot; That certainly suggests some disagreements. &quot; The squabbling over how the tape was released remains a sore point between the agencies , and Williams said he believes better protocols may be needed to clarify departmental responsibilities in high-profile cases such_as the Simpson investigation . Although the top brass of the agencies are working to smooth_over differences , potentially serious miscommunications in the Simpson case have occurred over the collection and testing of evidence . During a hearing last month , government lawyers were stunned when a package was opened in court and they learned for the first time of a note from Nicole Simpson to her ex-husband . The officer who seized the note said he had taken it because he believed it may have hinted at a possible motive for O.J. Simpson to have committed the murders . But the letter ' s impact on the prosecution case was ambiguous at best , and government attorneys were forced to publicly admit that they had never before seen the document . Although prosecutor Clark tried to downplay the importance of that new evidence , law_enforcement sources say members of the district_attorney ' s office were furious to learn of the note ' s contents months after it was seized . Other mistakes have surrounded blood samples : Scores were collected , and prosecutors were forced to concede at one point that samples had been sent to a lab by the LAPD without their knowledge . Although Ito found that no subterfuge was intended , the judge icily described the efforts of police and prosecutors as &quot; a picture of confusion , miscommunication and non-communication. &quot; Some gripes are more personal . Within the LAPD , some officers make sexist comments about Clark ' s temperament and say that she is not the right person to handle such an important case . &quot; She flies off the handle , &quot; one police_officer said . &quot; that ' s a problem they have in that office with the women prosecutors. &quot; Clark has consistently declined to discuss the case outside court . She did not respond to a request for comment Friday . For their part , some prosecutors see LAPD detectives as sloppy investigators whose work has deteriorated in recent years in the face of cutbacks and plummeting Police_Department morale . Others like and respect their LAPD counterparts but nevertheless complain about the quality of work that the department is producing . &quot; The quality and crime-fighting relevance of felonies submitted to us for filing has substantially decreased , &quot; Donald N . Eastman , a high-ranking official in the office , wrote in a memo to Garcetti last year . &quot; Our line lawyers feel that LAPD officers are compelled by current circumstances to go_through the motions , push paper , work their shift and go home. &quot; Such complaints , Reiner said , are nothing new : &quot; The expression that has been used for years in the D.A. ' s office to describe the LAPD is : ' Just enough is enough. ' &quot; It is that attitude , say sources close to the Simpson case , that has helped contribute to some of the Police_Department ' s miscues . Among others , the failure to log the contents of the Nicole Simpson note and the careless safeguarding of Simpson ' s Ford Bronco while it was in police custody have irritated prosecutors . Although personality conflicts , longstanding animosities and confusion about evidence have contributed to the unease between the agencies in the Simpson case , it is the continuing stream of leaks that has most bitterly divided the two organizations . From the opening days of the investigation , police and prosecutors have blamed each other for numerous news_reports . Early on in the case , The Times and some_other news organizations carried reports disclosing that a pair of bloody gloves -- one at Simpson ' s home and one at the murder scene -- had been recovered . Law_enforcement sources provided that information , and Simpson ' s lawyer at the time , Howard Weitzman , denied it up until the day he left the case . That report later was borne_out in testimony . Other reports disclosed that blood drops from the scene matched some of the characteristics of Simpson ' s blood ; the first stories dealt with conventional blood analysis , and subsequent articles have detailed far more sophisticated DNA test results . Other stories revealed that Simpson had cuts and scratches when interviewed by police , that an off-duty Los Angeles police_sergeant provided security for Simpson while he was under investigation , and that a hair recovered from Goldman ' s body resembles hair samples taken from Simpson . Although both sides have complained that the information in those reports was improperly released , neither police nor prosecutors nor defense_attorneys have challenged the veracity of any of those stories -- all_of which were reported first by The Times . In recent weeks , however , feuding over leaks has gained intensity because of television reports that inaccurately portrayed the status of scientific testing in the case . Those stories , which were aired first by KNBC Channel 4 and were echoed by CNN , reported that DNA tests of blood on a pair of socks discovered in Simpson ' s bedroom genetically matched Nicole Simpson ' s blood . During court discussions about those reports , defense_attorneys and prosecutors formed an unusual alliance and requested an investigation to ferret_out the source of the leaks . Denying all responsibility themselves , the attorneys together attacked the LAPD as the likely source of the erroneous disclosures . Cochran called_for the LAPD to launch an Internal Affairs investigation , and , in a rare point of agreement with her adversary , Clark seconded that notion . For police_officers , it was one thing to be attacked by the Simpson defense_team , but quite another to have the district_attorney ' s office join in . &quot; How nice for them , &quot; one police_officer said sarcastically . &quot; All the lawyers get_together and decide that none of them said anything . The one thing they all agree on is that we get blamed. &quot; Veteran court watchers , even those sensitive to the long rivalry between police and prosecutors , were surprised to see Clark so directly blame the police . &quot; It ' s pretty undiplomatic to dump it on the Police_Department , &quot; said Harland W . Braun , a noted criminal defense_lawyer and former deputy district_attorney . &quot; I can see why it burns them. &quot; Reiner agreed . &quot; The LAPD has a legitimate beef on this one , &quot; he said . &quot; The D.A. ' s office is a big office , with lawyers , investigators , secretaries . . . . Anybody who would bet $ 2 that this information didn ' t come_out of the D.A. ' s office is just a gambler. &quot; The LAPD has initiated an internal investigation to determine whether one of its officers was the source of that report . Prosecutors have not launched any comparable inquiry , but the defense has recently stepped_up the pressure , trying again to drive a wedge between police and prosecutors . In a motion filed under seal last week , Simpson ' s lawyers asked_for a hearing to search for the source of that report and possibly others . No matter what the outcome , the mere challenge may help further divide their adversaries . &quot; If that ' s the case , &quot; Cochran said , &quot; so be it. &quot;</TEXT>
