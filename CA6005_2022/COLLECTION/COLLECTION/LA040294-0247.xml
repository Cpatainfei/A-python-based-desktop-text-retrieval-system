   <HEADLINE> BORROWING TROUBLE ; SMALL-FIRM OWNERS STILL AWAITING SBA QUAKE RELIEF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To hear some small businesses tell it , the Northridge earthquake was only the first jolt . The aftershocks began when they turned_to the Small Business Administration for help . Most small-business owners are still waiting for assistance as the SBA doles out the money at a snail ' s pace -- and with homeowners at the front of the line . The now-familiar list of destruction from the Jan . 17 temblor -- at least 57 dead , up_to $ 20 billion in losses , six freeways mangled , more_than 4 # 300 buildings damaged -- includes losses for at least 100 # 000 small companies , most of which had no earthquake insurance to cover the blow to buildings , inventory , equipment and revenue . So far , the SBA has approved more_than $ 700 million in low-interest loans , but mostly for homeowners . Barely $ 2.6 million has reached business owners . The demand for disaster assistance seems to have overwhelmed the agency . But beyond the gargantuan snags , the hard truth is that many businesses -- already in hock to the hilt or teetering from the effects of the long Southland recession -- simply can ' t qualify for SBA loans . And for the businesses that can ' t qualify , there is not much help available . &quot; I ' m really angry , because they give you this big BS scenario about $ 8.6 billion to help repair earthquake damage . Well , where is it ? &quot; complained one Santa Monica retailer , who asked that her name not be used so customers and suppliers won ' t discover the financial mess that the earthquake has left her in . The woman said she applied for a $ 20 # 000 loan from the SBA to cover damage to her store ' s contents as well as loss of business . Weeks later , the SBA could not tell her whether additional paperwork she sent had arrived safely . Several blocks away , in one of Santa Monica ' s hardest-hit retail areas , the quake bounced Jason Douglas-Hiley out of his hair salon , the Yellow Balloon , which caters to children . Only the hospitality of a nearby beauty_shop owner allowed him to stay in business until he was allowed back into his own salon two weeks ago . The SBA has been decidedly less helpful , he said , misplacing his request for business and home loan_applications for more_than a month . &quot; It ' s very frustrating , &quot; said Douglas-Hiley , who has yet to see an SBA damage &quot; verifier &quot; at his business . A verifier finally appeared at his damaged Northridge home on March 24 , &quot; so at least I ' m starting to feel_like there ' s some movement. &quot; He and his wife , Denise , have spent hours on the phone and in disaster assistance centers to straighten_out the problem , in between tending for their infant daughter , born one week after the quake . &quot; I have 12 employees , &quot; Douglas-Hiley said as he passed_out balloons and hand stamps to his squirming clientele . &quot; Those people have to make a living . Southern California is not in great shape anyway. &quot; Similar tales abound of endlessly busy phone_lines , misplaced paperwork , delays , verifiers who don ' t show and questions on loan forms that can ' t be answered . Small Business Administration officials acknowledge that there have been problems but insist that they are attacking them and improving the agency ' s performance . Certainly not all_the reviews have been bad . The SBA has received praise for its quick response and flexibility in the early days after the earthquake , including an on-the-spot decision by SBA chief Erskine B . Bowles during a Southern California tour of destruction to raise the $ 1.5-million loan limit for individual loans to some small and medium-size companies . Victims have lauded the kindness and patience of SBA and Federal Emergency Management Agency employees . But many small companies that turned_to the SBA for help now are finding that the agency is severely backlogged , with loan_applications stacked_up more_than two months after the costliest natural disaster it has ever faced . Others who had sought aid said they simply gave_up when confronted with the rigorous paperwork requirements to get an SBA business disaster or economic injury loan . And these are the new , simpler loan_applications developed after last year ' s Midwest floods . Of course , bashing the SBA and FEMA , its partner in disaster relief , is always a favorite post-cataclysm sport . FEMA , the umbrella agency for emergency assistance , was reorganized last year after damning evaluations of its performance following the 1992 Los Angeles riots , Northern California ' s Loma Prieta earthquake , Hurricane Andrew in Florida and Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii . The SBA , which hands_out government low-interest loans to homeowners and businesses after a disaster , also did some program tinkering last year . The paperwork requirements for business loans were cut_in half . This time , part of the grousing stems from the sheer magnitude of the disaster . In addition , Clinton_Administration officials who promised speedy help right after the shaking stopped have acknowledged that they may have raised victims ' hopes unrealistically . But underneath all_the growing frustration is a kind of innocence lost as , one by one , business owners discover an ugly fact about disasters : Damage to your home is bad , but damage to your business is worse . that ' s because most disaster relief historically has been geared toward middle-class homeowners . Entrepreneurs , including owners of commercial apartment_buildings , come_in a distant second , said Mary Comerio , a UC Berkeley architecture professor who studied FEMA and SBA response to housing problems after the Loma Prieta earthquake . Most of the government ' s relief programs were developed for rural_areas where there was less need to help apartment or business owners , she said . There is no equivalent of FEMA housing vouchers or grants for private enterprise . &quot; There are lots of misperceptions around in the public mind , &quot; Comerio said . &quot; One is that the government will help you after a disaster . Another is that it all will be OK soon . In reality , rebuilding takes a tremendous amount of time. &quot; Don Ivone has already figured that out . The Burbank real_estate_broker suffered $ 50 # 000 worth of broken windows , wall cracks and water damage when a pipe_in his office ' s ceiling burst during the quake . He applied for an SBA loan two months ago and can ' t find_out where his application stands . &quot; We ' ve made several phone_calls and we ' ve been left in Muzak limbo forever , and it just becomes cost prohibitive for us to stay_on the phone , &quot; said Ivone , president of California Real_Estate Services . &quot; We ' re like the Energizer bunny . We ' re still waiting , still waiting. &quot; For the SBA , responding to the Northridge earthquake has been akin to setting_up a Fortune 500 company almost overnight . What ' s more , this instant organization must deal with complicated financial documents and a crush of customers who have just been through one of the worst experiences of their lives . &quot; Unfortunately , we ' ve had many opportunities to get better and better at it , &quot; said Tom MacKenzie , Sacramento-based assistant administrator for the SBA ' s sprawling Western region . This time , that meant jumping within a_few weeks from 300 to more_than 2 # 500 employees handling disaster response in the region . More_than half were new , untrained hires . Telephone_lines and nearly 100 operators were added . Facilities were rented and furnished . Raining_down on them was an unexpected torrent of loan_applications from homeowners and businesses . In the two and a half months since the quake , the SBA already has received more applications for earthquake-related disaster loans than it collected after any other disaster -- even months later , when it came time to close the books . Even so , the SBA is averaging more_than $ 20 million in loan_approvals a day ; agency officials used to consider $ 5 million in approvals a good_day . Indeed , the agency has won many fans with its initial fancy footwork . &quot; It ' s the most impressive response I ' ve ever seen from a government_agency , &quot; said John J . Rooney , president of the Valley Economic Development Center , a nonprofit organization that estimates it has helped more_than 5 # 000 companies fill_out earthquake disaster loan_applications . &quot; My hat is off to them. &quot; In the first month alone , the SBA issued nearly 300 # 000 applications and got_back slightly more_than 46 # 000 . By comparison , applications issued after Hurricane Andrew -- the previous record-holder in the disaster derby -- reached nearly 48 # 000 in the first month ; 5 # 700 were sent_back completed . The SBA shuffled more paper ( 5 # 715 applications processed ) and approved more money ( $ 93.3 million in home and business loans ) in the first month after the quake than ever before . But despite that pace , the proportion of applications processed actually was much smaller than in previous disasters , because the demand was so huge . About 40 # 000 applications sat unprocessed . &quot; The big challenge for them is , because they ' re going to have an unprecedented number of applications filed , getting them processed , &quot; Rooney said . &quot; They have such a big bubble to swallow. &quot; Bernard Kulik has been running the SBA ' s disaster assistance program for 12 years -- long enough to earn the nickname &quot; Master of Disaster. &quot; Kulik defends has agency ' s response while acknowledging that there have been problems in getting loan_applications through the system . &quot; We ' re knocking ourselves out_to do_it . We ' re attacking it tooth and nail , &quot; Kulik said . &quot; Obviously , we ' re not doing_it as fast as we would like , &quot; he said . &quot; Whatever delay we ' re dealing with is because of the volume . The numbers are enormous. &quot; On average , it is taking the SBA two to three weeks to process home loan_applications to_the_point of approval or rejection and four to six weeks for business loans . Businesses can receive loans for actual damages as well as for &quot; economic injury &quot; suffered because they were closed for a time or because revenues dropped after the quake . As of March 31 , the SBA had approved 1 # 319 business and economic injury loans totaling $ 75.9 million and 23 # 724 home loans totaling $ 664 million . But of those totals , the agency had actually issued only 238 checks to businesses for a total of $ 2.6 million . Homeowners had been issued 4 # 215 checks totaling $ 40.7 million . Homeowners have been getting a bigger chunk of the cash primarily because such loans are easier to process , Kulik said , adding that the SBA has no formal policy putting homeowners ahead of business owners after a disaster . The amount_of_money actually in the hands of business owners so far appears relatively small partly because the SBA pays_out in installments and because the agency cannot control how quickly applicants return their closing documents , he said . But here ' s another fact that upsets many entrepreneurs : Of the 50 # 000 or so companies that are expected to apply for SBA loans , 15 # 000 to 25 # 000 of them will never see a dime . Plenty of homeowners will be rejected , too , but the turn-down rate on those loans is lower ; homeowners generally have been in better shape financially than businesses and can more easily qualify for the income-based loans . Businesses have a harder_time demonstrating that they are credit-worthy . Many earthquake-damaged companies had already been slapped around by the recession and the restructuring of the aerospace and financial services_industries . To them , credit was a foreign word even before the earthquake struck . &quot; So many of these businesses were just hanging_on by their fingernails , and they ' re just not going_to qualify , &quot; said Jack Kyser , economist for the Economic Development Corp . of Los Angeles County , a nonprofit jobs promotion agency . &quot; The SBA is being a prudent lender . These are loans , not grants. &quot; The SBA ' s Kulik said the disaster loan program was not set_up to help with pre-existing economic problems . &quot; We are a lending organization , but by law we have to find a reasonable ability to repay , &quot; Kulik said . &quot; We don ' t make loans if the only way we can collect is to foreclose. &quot; If a homeowner is denied a loan , that person is referred to a grant program administered by FEMA and the state . &quot; Unfortunately , there is no safety net for business . There is no grant program that underpins business , &quot; Kulik said . Many businesses damaged in the 1992 riots found FEMA and SBA unresponsive . The overall rejection rate was 50 % to 60 % for loan and grant programs to homeowners and businesses after the disturbances , studies found at the time . After the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake , few businesses in the severely damaged Whittier business_district saw any SBA loan money for nearly a year , according to a National Science Foundation-funded study conducted by Robert Bolin , a professor at New Mexico State University . Between the slow funding and local redevelopment controversies , little rebuilding occurred in that time , Bolin found . Citing such experiences , disaster relief expert Richard Walden had once wanted to see FEMA abolished , though he now thinks the agency is doing a better job . Still , he would like to see the SBA ease_up even more on its lending requirements . &quot; These little mom-and-pop businesses find it almost impossible to convince the SBA that they are viable , &quot; said Walden , president of Operation USA , an international , nonprofit , disaster relief and development organization . &quot; In a post-disaster scenario , lending standards should be easier. &quot; Walden also suggests that the government give the disaster loan money to private banks and allow them to administer the programs . &quot; At least the banks are already set_up to do_it , &quot; he said . Outside of disasters , the SBA makes few direct_loans , instead guaranteeing loans made by private lending_institutions to small businesses . At Big Valley Music in Northridge , the windows advertise &quot; Big Shakedown Sale. &quot; But Carol Ozanian , president of the company , has decided that the biggest shakedown of all has been disaster relief . &quot; The reality is , there is no Santa Claus , &quot; said Ozanian , who expects to spend several thousand dollars to repair her roof and replace inventory . Ozanian is going it alone because she thinks the SBA would turn her down after finding_out she already has two SBA-guaranteed loans . &quot; The paperwork is horrendous , &quot; she said . &quot; It takes a tremendous amount of effort to fill them out . . . . I didn ' t want to go_through the whole process , only to be turned down. &quot; Choked Pipeline The Small Business Administration ' s disaster assistance loan program is a primary source of funds for business and apartment owners trying to repair and rebuild after the Jan . 17 earthquake . Many seeking loans complain that the SBA bureaucracy is moving slowly , though agency officials say they are moving as quickly and responsibly as possible , given an unprecedented volume of applications . Here are the numbers as of March 31 . * Applications issued : 412 # 270 Homeowners : 294 # 307 Businesses , apartments : 117 # 963 * Applications completed : 148 # 251 Homeowners : 116 # 985 Businesses , apartments : 31 # 266 * Loan decisions ( approvals and denials ) : 41 # 739 Homeowners : 39 # 178 Businesses , apartments : 2 # 561 * Loan_approvals : 25 # 043 totaling $ 739.9 million Homeowners : 23 # 724 totaling $ 664 million Businesses , apartments : 1 # 319 totaling $ 75.9 million * Funds disbursed : $ 43.4 million Homeowners : 4 # 215 checks totaling $ 40.7 million Businesses , apartments : 238 checks totaling $ 2.6 million Source : Small Business Administration After Disasters The Northridge earthquake of Jan . 17 has generated far more loan_applications to the Small Business Administration than any other disaster .
