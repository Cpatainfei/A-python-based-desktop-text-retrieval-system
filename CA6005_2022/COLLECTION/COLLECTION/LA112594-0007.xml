   <HEADLINE> WINE : SERVICE POINTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Imagine that the waiter brings the wine you ordered , but it ' s already uncorked . Do you reject the wine , as convention dictates , and ask the waiter to open a new bottle in front of you ? That is protocol in most fine restaurants , yet there are times when it ' s better to simply accept the already-open wine . As Edmund Osterland , a master sommelier and wine consultant , says , &quot; You shouldn ' t be so wine-geeky at simple places that have low prices. &quot; Restaurant etiquette is a subject rarely dealt with in wine literature , and I suspect many writers avoid the subject since there ' s no accepted rule book on it . Much appears to be handed_down by oral tradition , so the &quot; rules &quot; that follow are not universally acknowledged . &quot; However , from discussions with restaurant owners and wine_stewards , I am confident that the following won ' t get you in much trouble . * At a good restaurant , you should be handed the wine list as soon as you are seated . Unfortunately , you often have to beg for it . At one Hollywood restaurant last year , I was told to wait . &quot; We have only one list , and someone ' s looking_at it , &quot; said the waitress . When you ' re ordering by the glass , it ' s fair to ask_for a sip of one or two wines you ' re not familiar_with . With wine going_for $ 8 a glass and up , most restaurants permit patrons to try half an ounce ( that ' s a tablespoon ) of a wine sold by the glass . When the wine comes_to the table , most of the time you have to take it on faith that what you ordered is what ' s in the glass . Few restaurants pour the wine from the bottle at the table . But if in doubt , ask to see the bottle . Serving sizes of wines ordered by the glass vary . Most restaurants serve six ounces in a by-the-glass serving , though some serve only four ounces , and with a_few special items ( such_as Opus One , the famed Napa Valley red_wine ) , the standard serving is only three ounces . It ' s my experience that when you order a glass of sparkling_wine , you scarcely ever get six ounces . * When ordering wine from the wine list , you may need assistance . Osterland suggests you open a dialogue with the waiter . &quot; The patron should ask questions , &quot; says Osterland . &quot; And the waiter should either make recommendations based on the desire of the patron , or bring someone to the table who can. &quot; Osterland says when good waiters are asked_for suggestions , they don ' t simply respond with their personal favorites : &quot; They will ask , ' What do you drink at_home and do you want something like that ? ' This gives the waiter two bits of information : the type of wine the patron likes and the approximate price point he ' s prepared to pay. &quot; You might say , &quot; I like a rich Chardonnay , like Ferrari-Carano. &quot; Or the waiter might ask whether you prefer a lighter style of Cabernet , or one with a lot more power . Patrons should be alert to &quot; bait and switch &quot; tactics . They aren ' t common , but they do occur . Three years ago , I ordered a Chianti selling for $ 25 at an upscale Beverly Hills Italian restaurant . The waiter said it was sold_out and recommended another . But he never told me that the price was $ 38 , even when I asked . ( And there were cheaper wines on the list he could have suggested ) . In many top-rate restaurants , when a wine you have ordered is out_of_stock and a more expensive substitute is recommended , you are given the replacement wine at the same price as the wine you ordered . This is how it should be . * When the bottle arrives_at the table , the waiter should show you the label . Be certain the wine is the one ordered -- proper producer , vintage , special designations . For instance , you may order an Inglenook wine , expecting it to be from the Napa Valley ( where the winery is based ) , but instead get Inglenook Navalle , which is cheaper and contains little , if any , Napa Valley grapes . In a fine restaurant , the cork should still be in the bottle when the wine arrives . If you ' re in a small , inexpensive place , though , it may_not be . &quot; If you ' re in a mom-and-pop restaurant where the entire tab will be $ 10 , you probably shouldn ' t be so demanding if the cork is pulled_in the kitchen , &quot; says Osterland , owner of Grape Escape Consulting of San Diego . &quot; As the check price goes_up , you ratchet up your expectations. &quot; &quot; I ' ve even had waitresses ( at other restaurants ) ask me to open the bottle , &quot; said Manfred Krankl , wine buyer for Campanile in Los Angeles . &quot; In small cafes , if they open it in the kitchen , I usually don ' t mind. &quot; After the cork has been pulled , the waiter should put it down for you to look_at it . Long ago the cork was verification that you were getting the wine you ordered . Decades ago , fraud was more prevalent than today and bogus labels occasionally turned_up on some famed wines . The branded cork , with the name of the producer and the vintage , was one additional way to make_sure the wine was what it was supposed to be . * These days , however , you needn ' t worry about the cork . It ' s the aroma of the wine you ' re concerned about , not the aroma of the cork . After the cork has been pulled , the waiter pours a tiny amount ( perhaps a half-ounce ) for the person who ordered it . This is to smell and taste it , to determine whether it is sound . In general , the only reason to reject a wine in a restaurant is if it is spoiled . And the patron should know what sort of spoilage he is objecting to -- corkiness , oxidation , vinegar , etc . If the waiter makes a suggestion on a wine without having asked any questions of the patron , and the patron doesn ' t like the wine , who assumes responsibility ? &quot; I think the waiter should take it back , &quot; says Osterland . &quot; By making a recommendation , he is putting his reputation on the line . If the waiter says the wine is soft and you find it acidic , the waiter hasn ' t done his job. &quot; One last tactic is bringing your own wine from home . Many restaurants permit it ( though in some states it ' s against the law ) . Call ahead to alert the restaurant you will bring a wine from your cellar and ask if there is a corkage charge . ( Standard charges range from $ 3 to $ 10 per bottle. ) * Courtesy dictates you don ' t bring a wine the restaurant already stocks , and it ' s impolite to bring a cheap wine just to save money . One last warning : Restaurants in the United States are notorious for not training their wait-staffs in wine , so be prepared for some humorous banter with the less-well-informed . And don ' t think that just because the guy is wearing a sommelier ' s cup around his neck on a silver chain that he knows the difference between a Pommard and a Pomerol . Wine of the Week 1993 Sutter Home Winery Sauvignon Blanc ( $ 4.45 ) -- The winery that created and still dominates the field of white Zinfandel also makes a line of other varietal wines , and this one is surprisingly bold and full of character for so low a price . There is a lot of varietal intensity here , with olives , tarragon , green and herbal_teas and lemon grass all adding interest . ( I tasted this wine blind , and my tasting notes say , &quot; Is there too_much varietal character here ? &quot; ) The flavors are fairly deep , and the texture is soft and pleasing . Considering that the wine will be discounted to about $ 3.50 , this is worth trying .</TEXT>
