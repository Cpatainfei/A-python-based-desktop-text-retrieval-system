   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : MISSION VIEJO ; BALL_FIELDS NAMED IN COUPLE ' S MEMORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The softball fields at De Portola Elementary School were named this weekend in memory of Mark and Noreen Minzey , who were killed in a head-on collision by an alleged drunk driver last July while returning home from their daughter Karie ' s softball all-star game . An emotion-filled ceremony to name the fields was held before a crowd of 1 # 200 Saturday that had gathered for the 22nd annual opening day of the Mission de Oro Bobby Sox League.The Mission Viejo couple were volunteer coaches in the league , while 12-year-old Karie -- injured seriously in the crash -- was a star player . &quot; It was very special , &quot; Connie Beaty , president of the league , said of the ceremony . It was a difficult ceremony for many in the league who were close to the Minzeys , including the Rodriguez family , whose daughters Jackie and Danielle were involved in the collision but suffered minor injuries , Beaty said . The crash occurred July 11 on Santiago Canyon Road as the Minzey family and Rodriguez children returned home from a softball tournament . Second-degree murder and driving under the influence charges are pending against Ronald Joseph Allen Jr. , 31 , an internist with a history of arrests , on suspicion of driving while intoxicated . Friends said Karie Minzey has made remarkable progress since the crash and is living with her 15-year-old sister , Shelby , with their aunt and uncle in Marietta , Ga . Shelby was not involved in the crash . Special awards will also be given_in the league each year in memory of Mark and Noreen Minzey , and to honor the special player qualities of Karie . A special Minzey Field sign , bought with donations from Lamppost Pizza , will be installed at the entrance of the field , which is the home of the 350-member Bobby Sox league.ANNA CEKOLA</TEXT>
