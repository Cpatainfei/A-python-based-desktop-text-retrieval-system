   <TEXT> During the Cold_War , the United States and its allies assessed every local conflict for its quotient of strategic harm or benefit . With the Cold_War ended , the allies believe that they may allow local conflict to remain local with relative impunity . The war in the Balkans has been a semi-exception to this rule . The European powers have not felt that they could safely ignore the carnage there completely , but they have also not felt that any enemy could exploit this war to their serious harm . Serb expansionism under Slobodan Milosevic was , at worst , an ominous precedent . But this calculus may be_due for a revision . Though the Bosnian government has accepted a European proposal for a Bosnian partition , the separatist Bosnian Serbs have not . The war seems all but certain to continue , and the U.N. forces may soon be weakened by the reduction or even elimination of French and British support . If that happens , the conflict may continue as a Christian-Muslim conflict with outside support from the more ardent wing of each side ' s co-religionists . To oversimplify , Serbs-against-Bosnian-Muslims could become Cossacks-against-Mujahedeen . At that point , this local conflict would begin to become a grim imitation of the Cold_War proxy conflicts of old . This time it would be the shadow of terrorism , rather than the shadow of nuclear conflict , that would lengthen . The Muslim minorities in several European_countries are increasingly aggrieved and militant . The heavy loss of Muslim life that would result in the short term from a U.N. default in Bosnia could exacerbate their sense of grievance and foster the related militancy . The rhetoric heard at the sentencing of the World Trade Center terrorist bombers should remind us that the United States is not immune . That crime was utterly savage , and the life sentences that have now been imposed are fully justified . But a great_deal can be lost in cross-cultural translation , especially in a climate of rising hostility . That climate will only worsen if the situation in Bosnia worsens . &quot; We ' re fighting them there so that we won ' t have to fight them here , &quot; American soldiers said in Korea and Vietnam . In this instance , ironically , it is refusing to defend Muslims there that may lead in time to defending against other Muslims here .</TEXT>
