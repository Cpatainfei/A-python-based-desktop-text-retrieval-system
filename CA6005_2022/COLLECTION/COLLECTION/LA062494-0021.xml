   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW / HISTORY ; ' SHOTS , THE CRYING AND THE SCREAMING ' ; THE MASSACRE AT EL MOZOTE , BY MARK DANNER ( VINTAGE ; $ 12 , PAPER ; 304 PAGES )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When I first read about the_Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team in Mark Danner ' s otherwise horrifying book , &quot; The Massacre at El Mozote , &quot; I found myself heartened by the very notion of its existence . The team consists_of scientific experts who specialize in bringing murderers to justice by literally digging_up evidence of war atrocities , and they ' ve done their work throughout Central and South_America and as far afield as Iraq . But as I read Danner ' s account of what happened in the Salvadoran village of El Mozote in 1981 , my heart began to break . The Argentine forensic experts uncovered evidence of mass_murder that took the lives of nearly 700 men , women and children in El Mozote and the surrounding hamlets ; many of the victims died only after enduring rape and torture at the hands of the Salvadoran army . A member of the forensic team , for example , dug_up the skeleton of a child , identified only as No . 59 , and an orange plastic horse that had once belonged_to the tiny victim . &quot; Ordinarily , we could use this for identification , &quot; the anthropologist observes . &quot; I mean , even after 11 years , any mother would recognize this as her kid ' s , you know ? But here , they killed all_the mothers , too. &quot; Danner ' s work , which first appeared in the New Yorker , is a taut construction of investigative reporting , political analysis and a curious , sometimes almost rhapsodic description of the lives ( and deaths ) of the innocents unlucky enough to find themselves in El Mozote on the day the men in camouflage uniforms appeared in the village . There ' s a strangely poetic quality , for instance , in the testimony of one Salvadoran man who describes how government troops swept_through the zona rosa -- or free-fire zone -- where El Mozote was located in an effort to round_up and execute the suspected guerrillas whose names appeared on the death lists that their officers carried . &quot; They had lists from Perquin south to Arambala , &quot; the man told Danner , reciting the villages on_the_road to El Mozote . &quot; But farther down there were no lists . Farther down , they killed everything down to the ground . Farther down was scorched earth. &quot; The victims , as Danner shows us , were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time -- a vast battlefield in the civil_war that has ravaged El_Salvador for more_than a decade . &quot; The people of El Mozote were struggling to keep their balance in the middle of the perilously shifting ground of a brutal war , &quot; Danner explains , &quot; working hard to remain on friendly terms with the soldiers while fearing to alienate the guerrillas. &quot; The Ronald Reagan_Administration , Danner writes , had &quot; vowed . . . to ' draw_the_line ' in El_Salvador against communist subversion in the hemisphere. &quot; Salvadoran army and police units , armed and trained by the United States , were sent into the countryside not only to engage the guerrillas in battle , but also to terrorize the campesinos into loyalty to the government . At El Mozote , as in Vietnam , they sought to save the village by destroying it . The narrative in &quot; The Massacre at El Mozote &quot; is a spare 161 pages , and a good_deal of reportage is devoted to the decade-long effort of both the United States and El_Salvador to cover_up the killings and discredit the early reports of the crime . The rest of the book consists_of the documentation that Danner has assembled to convince us that the massacre took_place as he says it did -- CIA reports , diplomatic memoranda , death lists and eyewitness accounts . &quot; All morning , you could hear the shots , the crying and the screaming , &quot; recalls one woman who was among the few survivors . &quot; If only you could have heard that enormous screaming. &quot; Now , thanks to the_Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team -- and thanks , especially , to the work of Danner in &quot; The Massacre at El Mozote &quot; -- the screams of the victims can be heard anew . As a result , El Mozote , like My Lai , has become a code word for the very worst excesses of humankind at war with itself .</TEXT>
