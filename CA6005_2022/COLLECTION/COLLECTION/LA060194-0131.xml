   <HEADLINE> O ' LEARY MAY BACK ALASKA EXPORTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A move to lift a ban on oil exports from Alaska got tentative support from the secretary_of_energy Tuesday , but an aide to U.S. Sen . Patty Murray said the ban would stand if challenged on the Senate floor . Murray ( D-Wash. ) is fighting to make the ban permanent . Under current law , oil from Alaska ' s North Slope must be sold in the United States , a condition imposed when the trans-Alaskan pipeline was approved by Congress in the 1970s . The Department_of_Energy is expected to release a study later this month on the costs and benefits of lifting the ban . Petroleum refiners and consumer groups support the ban because they believe West Coast oil prices would soar if North Slope crude could be sold abroad . Selling Alaska ' s production abroad would make oil scarcer in the United States and , the groups argue , more expensive . Murray , whose constituents include Tosco Corp. , which owns a refinery in her state , is up against California oil_companies and British Petroleum , which favor lifting the ban . BP wants to sell oil in Far Eastern markets from its part-owned Prudhoe Bay , Alaska , field , while California oil producers think a price rise could spur new drilling in the state . Secretary_of_Energy Hazel O ' Leary , speaking at a meeting of the New York Society of Security Analysts in New York , said that if lifting the ban &quot; is not detrimental to the economies of Alaska and California , &quot; she would support removing it . Major maritime unions have removed objections to lifting the ban . Unions that now support lifting it include the Seafarers International Union , the American Maritime Officers and the International_Organization of Masters , Mates &amp; Pilots .</TEXT>
