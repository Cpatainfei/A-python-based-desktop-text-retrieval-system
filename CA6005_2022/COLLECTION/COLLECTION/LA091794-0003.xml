   <HEADLINE> CLINTON DISPATCHES CARTER TO HAITI IN BID TO END CRISIS ; CARIBBEAN : ONLY HOURS AFTER OFFICIALS SAID MILITARY_ACTION WAS ' IMMINENT , ' THE FORMER PRESIDENT , COLIN POWELL AND SAM NUNN ARE SENT TO TALK LEADERS INTO STEPPING_DOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , in an extraordinary last-ditch effort to resolve the Haiti crisis peacefully , is dispatching a delegation headed by former President Jimmy_Carter to the Caribbean nation to persuade its military dictators to relinquish power . The White_House announced the stunning development Friday afternoon only hours after senior national security officials had said that an invasion by U.S. forces was &quot; imminent &quot; and the President , in a televised address to the nation , had called_on the American people to support military_action . Carter , it was learned , has had a series of secret telephone_conversations in recent days with Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , Haiti ' s military_leader , and there apparently is a proposal on the table for a peaceful resolution to the crisis -- raising new White_House hopes of removing the Haitian regime without risking U.S. lives . The delegation , which is scheduled to fly to the Haitian_capital of Port-au-Prince aboard a U.S. military plane today and meet with the generals over the weekend , includes retired Army Gen . Colin L . Powell , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff ; Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , and members of the Administration ' s national security team . The new diplomatic initiative could lengthen what had been understood to be a very short timetable for military_action to restore Haiti ' s democratically elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide . But officials insisted that it does not represent a change of policy or give the Haitian regime significantly more room for maneuver and delay . The delegation has &quot; a very , very short time frame &quot; in which to accomplish its mission , one senior official said . Carter and his colleagues will be authorized to discuss with the Haitians only the means of their departure , the official said . If the leaders are serious about negotiating safe passage out of Haiti and sanctuary in another country , he added , their conversation will be short . The official specifically ruled_out a proposal -- for which Nunn once expressed support -- under which Cedras ' departure would be tied to new elections in Haiti . Asked if he could give assurances that the mission would not lead to some sort of dilution of Clinton ' s insistence that the generals leave unconditionally , the official said : &quot; Yes , yes , yes , yes . I can assure you of that. &quot; Clinton ' s last-minute decision -- after telling the military dictators in his address to the nation Thursday : &quot; Leave now or we will force you from power &quot; -- left a massive military_force assembled for an invasion sitting idle off the Haitian coast . Administration officials said that the forces , including more_than 20 ships and about 20 # 000 personnel , are still poised to swing into action if the Carter mission fails . &quot; No policy -- nothing -- has changed since the President ' s statement last night , &quot; an official said . &quot; Nothing in this changes either the urgency of the situation or the timetable of our military preparations. &quot; White_House officials described the new move as an outgrowth of a process that began with the talks between Carter and Cedras . Early Thursday , Carter informed Clinton that Cedras might be interested in meeting with Carter . Over the next 36 hours , Clinton , Carter , Nunn , Powell and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake conferred repeatedly in an attempt to nail_down a plan . Powell apparently knows Cedras from past contacts . And the fact that Powell is a widely respected military figure who headed the Joint Chiefs during the George_Bush Administration lends an element of bipartisanship to the endeavor . An Administration official said that Nunn , who opposes Clinton ' s plan for an invasion , will tell the Haitian leaders that congressional opposition -- vociferous and widespread as it has been -- would be no bar to an invasion . * Appearing Friday at a charity fund-raising dinner in Macon , Ga. , Nunn didn ' t seem optimistic about a diplomatic solution . &quot; I hope we can bring_about some resolution , &quot; he said . &quot; I think the odds are against it , but I hope so in spite of it all. &quot; &quot; We are making the trip to solve the crisis without the loss of a single Haitian or American life , &quot; Powell said Friday night in Ashland , Ohio , where he spoke at a fund-raiser at Ashland University . Accompanying Carter , Nunn and Powell will be Lawrence Rossin , the National Security_Council ' s point_man on Haiti , and Maj . Gen . Jared Bates , the chief_assistant to Lt . Gen . John Sheehan , director of operations for the Pentagon ' s joint staff . In Congress , most Republicans and many Democrats oppose Clinton ' s policy . And when Congress meets next week , there undoubtedly will be pressure for a vote on whether to support an invasion . A senior Administration official , commenting on the prominent stature of the members of the Carter delegation , said that &quot; dignity &quot; is an important factor for the Haitian leaders . &quot; It is important to them who they surrender their swords to , &quot; he said , speaking on the condition that he not be named . Asked why formal talks are needed if the only subject is the military_leaders ' departure , a senior official said : &quot; The way in which they would depart is not a simple thing . There are a lot of issues involved in the manner of their departure , which I would prefer not to go_into because we need to discuss it with them. &quot; On Friday , Panama said it would grant political asylum to Cedras if that would prevent a U.S. invasion . &quot; We would give him asylum with pleasure , but not after an invasion , &quot; President Ernesto Perez Balladares said . Clinton and Carter had been conferring off and on about the Haiti crisis for some time , sources said . Their conversations became more urgent after Carter returned Tuesday to Atlanta from a two-week visit in Africa just as U.S. forces began massing off the Haitian coast . The former Georgia governor was a natural emissary as Clinton sought to avoid an unpopular step -- a step one informed source said the President himself had privately expressed misgivings about taking . Carter served as the official monitor for the 1990 election when Haitians chose Aristide , who served as president only nine months before being ousted by the military . Carter ' s contacts with Cedras , according to one official , were one of several possible &quot; channels &quot; to the Haitian leadership that the Administration had been using without being sure whether any of them would work . &quot; A number of avenues were pursued , &quot; he said . There were indications that the makeup of Carter ' s delegation was shaped in part by a newspaper opinion article by Joseph H . Blatchford , a Washington lawyer and former Peace Corps director . Blatchford urged that Clinton name Carter to head a delegation to Haiti and suggested that Powell be included in the group . The piece , published on The Times ' Op-Ed page last Tuesday under the headline &quot; Another 11th-Hour Job for Jimmy_Carter , &quot; was read that day by the former President , sources say , and ultimately affected the selection of Clinton ' s emissaries . &quot; Say what you will about the Carter presidency , his Camp David accords brought peace between Israel and Egypt , &quot; wrote Blatchford , who served in the Richard Nixon Administration . &quot; His Panama_Canal treaty was a major leap forward in U.S.-Latin American relations , and as ex-President , his initiative to force the Sandinistas to call elections brought democracy back to Nicaragua . The returns aren ' t yet in on his mission to North_Korea , but so far it has proved useful to all sides. &quot; Clinton , pressing his case for public support for the invasion plan only hours before the White_House announced the Carter mission , told a group of journalists that he had been encouraged by indications that his speech Thursday had resulted in the U.S. public being &quot; more supportive. &quot; White_House officials cited overnight polls showing increased public support after the speech . One poll by USA Today / CNN / Gallup of 371 people who viewed the speech showed support for an invasion up from 40 % to 56 % . Clinton noted that 24 nations have now joined the United States in an international coalition in support of an invasion if it becomes necessary and said , &quot; I think we ' ll have more before very long. &quot; Most are small Caribbean nations , but the coalition includes Britain , Belgium , the_Netherlands , Israel and Jordan as well . Clinton was interviewed when he appeared at a high-level briefing arranged for the journalists in the Roosevelt Room of the White_House . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and five other senior officials who spoke on condition they not be identified directly conducted the briefing . Usually known for his direct personal engagement with interviewers , Clinton appeared tired and somewhat distracted as he stood answering questions . &quot; Are you nervous ? &quot; about the decision to press ahead against the generals , a journalist asked . &quot; Am I nervous ? No , I feel good about it . I don ' t know if good is the right word . I think the policy is right , and I think that I have done the best I could to present it to the American people and we have done the best we could to prepare . And I have enormous confidence in the work that others have done . . . . &quot; We don ' t live_in a risk-free world , and there are risks associated with anything we did or didn ' t do . But I think we ' re doing the right thing and I think we have the right people doing the right thing . that ' s all I could ever ask_for . And I ' ve made the decision , so if it doesn ' t go right , I ' m responsible. &quot; There was no hint then that any last-minute effort might be made to stave_off an invasion . In fact , the lengthy session focused mostly on how the United States intended to invade Haiti with minimal casualties on both sides . A national security official said that there would be an &quot; overwhelming force &quot; to minimize casualties , accomplish the mission quickly and permit U.S. troops to come_home as soon as possible . Christopher said that after Clinton ' s speech Thursday night , &quot; you ' re going to find support for this growing not only among the American people but on Capitol_Hill as well. &quot; He said that the Administration already had conducted 75 briefings on Haiti with members of Congress and was continuing to follow a heavy briefing schedule on Capitol_Hill . But he said the Administration has no plans to ask Congress to support the invasion plan . He pointed_out that President Ronald Reagan did not seek formal congressional support for invading Grenada and that President Bush did not seek it before invading Panama . &quot; And I think it ' s appropriate for the President to exercise his authority as commander-in-chief in the situation , but to comply with the authorities in Congress that are effective as we move through the situation. &quot; White_House officials invited Caribbean prime_ministers to the White_House to help them make the case for the U.S. action . Eugenia Charles of Dominica , who played an identical public role for Reagan a decade ago in support of the invasion of Grenada , said : &quot; We ' re determined that we should retain democracy in our part of the world . It ' s very important to realize , as small as we are , poor as we are , and with a population so little , that we do stand_for all_the good things that the world wants in their countries . And we believe that we must assist the Haitians to regain their democracy. &quot; Charles dismissed the idea advanced by some Republicans that , unlike Grenada , in this case U.S. interests are not at stake . &quot; I ' m not even sure your national interest was involved in Grenada . I am never quite sure what the American national interest is , frankly , &quot; she said . &quot; I know what our national interest is , and I think we want peace and democracy in our area , &quot; she added . &quot; And I will hope that the United States would feel it was not so far distant from our area ; that in fact they share some of the same seas we share , and there , they should have some of the concerns that we have. &quot; Administration officials sought to rebut charges that Aristide was a radical who would impose his own dictatorship on Haiti if returned to power . &quot; I think President Aristide understands the dynamics of the marketplace and market_economies , and that the way to grow is to have individual freedoms , free markets , &quot; said William H . Gray III , Clinton ' s special adviser on Haiti . &quot; I think he is clearly aware that in this hemisphere , as well as throughout the world village , other forms of economic and political organizations have been in deep despair and in_trouble and many of them have fallen_under their own weight. &quot; Sandy Berger , Clinton ' s deputy national security adviser , said Aristide &quot; understands extremely well that it is not in his interest or in the interest of Haiti for there to be a period of recrimination. &quot; Berger said Aristide probably would not return to Haiti until several days after U.S. forces occupy the island , which they are expected to do whether or not the military regime steps_down voluntarily . &quot; Obviously that depends to some degree on the conditions on the ground , &quot; he said .
