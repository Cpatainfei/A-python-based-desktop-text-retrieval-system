   <HEADLINE> U.S. LINKS WITH CHINA ' S MILITARY RAISE CONCERNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the last two months , the Pentagon has moved quietly but rapidly to develop military ties with the Chinese People ' s Liberation Army , raising questions in the United States and among Asian governments about what the new relationship means and where it is headed . Two months ago , in a private ceremony , a top Chinese general received the same sort of honor cordon at the Pentagon that Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide recently received on nationwide television . Last month , Gen . Merrill A . McPeak , U.S. Air_Force chief_of_staff , visited Beijing for talks and a banquet with the Chinese army ' s air_force commander . The new ties bear the personal imprimatur of Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , who has been_active in promoting cooperation between the U.S. and Chinese defense industries since his days as a senior Pentagon official in the Jimmy_Carter Administration . Perry , who has maintained personal ties with some senior Chinese military_leaders , will cement the new relationship with the Chinese army next week , when he pays his own visit to Beijing and establishes a U.S.-China commission to discuss possible cooperation between the two countries ' defense industries . &quot; I think it is important for our government to have a good working relationship with a country as important as China . I think that should include a defense-to-defense relationship , &quot; Perry said in an interview with The Times last week . He said his ties with Chinese leaders &quot; will be an asset in developing a good relationship . The Chinese are very strong . . . for what they call old friends . &quot; We ' ve got some hard problems to work_out with them , &quot; the defense_secretary said , citing China ' s sales of missiles to Pakistan and other countries and the U.S. effort to secure more Chinese help in stopping North_Korea ' s nuclear program . And on Friday , China conducted its second nuclear test this year , defying pressure to join an international nuclear-testing moratorium . A number of observers , including some U.S._government officials , believe that the new links will pave the way for the sale of military-related technology from American companies to China . &quot; It ' s inevitably going_to lead to that , &quot; one U.S._government official said . Michael D . Swaine , a RAND Corp . specialist on the Chinese army , observed of U.S. policy-makers : &quot; They seem to be trying to find a way to create some kind of sales without raising all kinds of reactions from Congress . The logic of the situation . . . is that the Clinton_Administration is going_to want to provide further assistance to U.S. businesses in China , including in areas that are defense-related. &quot; But Perry categorically denied that there will be any discussion of arms sales , American technology or any other American help for China ' s military during his trip . &quot; Nothing that I will be doing ( in China ) will be designed to enhance China ' s military_capability , &quot; he said . &quot; It may be that the Chinese Defense Ministry will make proposals to us that could involve a strengthening of their military activity . that ' s not what we ' re there to do. &quot; Although Pentagon officials say they have no intention of opening the way for direct government-to-government arms sales , they leave open the possibility of American sales of civilian technology with military applications -- such_as computers , radar and advanced electronics . Perry acknowledged that the United States might someday -- but not on his forthcoming trip -- seek to establish a military cooperation program with China . &quot; I never say never , &quot; he said , &quot; but I don ' t now conceive_of the circumstances in which I would see it as in our security_interests to be taking actions to deliberately plan to strengthen the military_capability of China . that ' s not what we ' re there to do. &quot; Pentagon officials also portray the new effort as a way of trying to deal with China as a future military superpower . They say they want to find_out what the Chinese military is doing and to reassure its leaders , through direct contact , that the Pentagon does not view China as an enemy . Yet the military links between the United States and China have begun to raise eyebrows in places such_as Russia , India , Taiwan and Southeast Asian_countries , all_of which are wary of China ' s growing military power and loath to have the United States do anything that would make China any stronger than it is . Perry said that top leaders of other Asian_countries &quot; have all urged me to form a strong relationship with China , and have been at times critical of our government for not working more closely with China. &quot; But he acknowledged that none of the other Asian leaders &quot; would propose today that we be involved today in arms sales to China or cooperative weapons development programs with China. &quot; The ties are controversial in Washington , where critics worry about the moral implications and the impact inside China of dealing with its army . In 1989 , although apparently with some reluctance , top military_leaders carried_out the orders of China ' s paramount leader , Deng Xiaoping , to remove pro-democracy demonstrators from the streets of Beijing . &quot; We always say this ( relationship ) doesn ' t give credibility to the PLA . But you ' ve got_to be realistic about it , &quot; said Rep . Patricia Schroeder , the Colorado Democrat and a member of the House Armed Services Committee . &quot; They ( Chinese army leaders ) are going_to say at_home , ' The Americans come here because we ' re such a great power. ' &quot; William C . Triplett , former chief counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and author of a forthcoming book about the Chinese military , said the Pentagon should have &quot; the same kind of relationship ( with China ' s army ) that we would have had with Hitler ' s general_staff in 1938 . Correct , yes , but the idea of cooperation with them is insane . . . . This is not France or Belgium here . We ' re talking_about a government which has used its military to enforce totalitarian rule. &quot; Until 1989 , the Pentagon and the Chinese army had extensive military links , based on their shared interest in counteracting Soviet military power in Asia . The ties included high-level visits , technology transfers , arms sales and strategic cooperation on issues such_as Afghanistan and Cambodia . But after the bloody Tian An Men Square crackdown , then-President George_Bush suspended all official contacts with the Chinese army and all U.S. military sales to China . To China ' s irritation , not only were new American sales prohibited , arms transfers already in process were held_up for nearly four years . For both the Pentagon and the Chinese , the events of 1989 were a watershed . &quot; There is no intention to go_back to pre-1989 days , &quot; one Pentagon official said . China , however , is now lobbying hard to have the Clinton_Administration lift the 1989 ban on direct arms sales to China and to open the way for transfers of technology with military applications . The ban on arms sales &quot; shows there is still a shadow over our relations , &quot; Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told a news_conference here last week . &quot; If we want to remove this shadow , we must work to lift these sanctions. &quot; He urged the Administration to open the way for_sales of military equipment , including spare_parts . Other governments believe that , whatever the Pentagon says publicly , it is maneuvering to become a supplier of military technology to China . &quot; The two countries ' interests converge , &quot; one European intelligence source observed . &quot; The United States has defense industries that need new sales , and China wants Western technology , because it doesn ' t want to rely entirely on what it can buy from Russia . &quot; But there are also some difficulties , &quot; the source added . &quot; The Americans want to sell off-the-shelf systems for quick income , and the Chinese want transfers of technology so that they can be able to make things on_their_own over the long term. &quot; On Perry ' s trip to China , he will hold the first official meeting of what will be called the U.S.-China Commission on Defense Conversion . Officially , the panel is supposed to talk_about ways of helping defense industries change_over to civilian production . But Perry ' s new panel will also open the way for broader exchanges between the U.S. and Chinese defense industries . U.S. officials on the panel will include representatives of the State and Defense_departments , the National Security_Council , the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff and , of particular note , the Commerce_Department -- the lead agency in promoting U.S. exports . Perry said he hoped the commission will help to establish &quot; business partnerships &quot; between U.S. companies and the Chinese defense industry . One possibility , he said , is that U.S. companies can help supply designs and marketing for low-technology products made by Chinese enterprises . Perry served as undersecretary of defense in the Jimmy_Carter Administration , when the United States was just opening the way for transfers of military-related technology to Beijing . &quot; He was closely involved in making more sophisticated technology available to the Chinese , &quot; said one career U.S. official , recalling Perry ' s efforts then . &quot; He was in the vanguard of liberalizing U.S. export controls for China. &quot; In particular , Perry led the way in changing the export rules so China would be treated more leniently than other Communist countries . Perry said he is proud_of the work he did_in trying to help China ' s military in 1980 , but he is not trying to revive those efforts . &quot; There ' s been a lot of history that has changed in the past 14 years , &quot; he said . One of the friends Perry made on that 1980 trip was Gen . Liu Huaqing , who is now one of China ' s top military_leaders . And in the early 1990s , while teaching at Stanford_University , he met Gen . Ding Henggao , who is now minister of the State Commission for Science , Technology and Industry for National Defense . The commission supervises the Chinese defense industry , and Ding will be China ' s top leader on the joint commission . Defense_Department officials say one of the main purposes of the high-level contact with the Chinese army is to avoid having the two sides drift into some sort of new Cold_War . &quot; We don ' t think_of them as an enemy , and they shouldn ' t think_of us as an enemy , &quot; one Pentagon official said . Ronald N . Montaperto , a China expert at the National Defense University who escorted four Chinese military officials on a recent trip to the United States , said he found leaders of China ' s army to be &quot; much less trustful , much more suspicious than they were two years ago. &quot; &quot; The PLA senior leadership is very taken by the notion that this Administration sees China as a future hostile peer competitor , and that U.S. policies reflect an attempt to prevent China from completing its program of economic development . They need to be disabused of this incorrect notion , &quot; Montaperto said . Some Pentagon officials argue that the Chinese army will get stronger with or without help from the United States . Over the last two years , for example , China has made big buys of military technology from Russia . &quot; This is not a military you can keep_down on the farm , &quot; one Defense_Department official observed . But critics of the new links say the United States should do as little as possible to help China ' s army . &quot; What are we doing ? &quot; asked Jeff Fiedler , who works_on China issues for the AFL-CIO . &quot; Why do we want to strengthen the Chinese military ? It could change the balance_of_power in Asia , to the detriment of the Japanese , who are a democracy without a large army. &quot; &quot; I get nervous when we trade items with high_technology , &quot; Schroeder added . &quot; How far will this go ? I don ' t know . I find it really kind of dangerous. &quot;</TEXT>
