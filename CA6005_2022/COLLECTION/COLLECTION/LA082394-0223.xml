   <TEXT> A distraught Princess Diana has denied making anonymous telephone_calls to an art_dealer friend who was acting_as a go-between when her marriage to Prince Charles fell_apart . It was the latest bizarre twist in the life of the estranged wife of Prince Charles , the heir to the_British throne.Diana , 33 , bowed_out of public life last year after she made a heartfelt plea for privacy . But she propelled herself back into the limelight with an unprecedented interview published Monday in the tabloid Daily Mail . Media reports say Oliver Hoare , a close friend of Diana and Charles , complained to police last October about a stream of nuisance calls . Each time he answered , no one spoke at the other end . Hoare , an expert on Islamic art , worried that he might be the target of Middle_East extremists , but investigators were said to have traced the calls to Diana ' s private apartments , her mobile phone , a line at her sister ' s house and even some public phone_booths . Diana , denying she ever made any of the calls , told the tabloid : &quot; You cannot be serious . I don ' t even know how to use a parking meter , let alone a phone box. &quot;</TEXT>
