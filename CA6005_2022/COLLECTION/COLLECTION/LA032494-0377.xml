   <TEXT> The man who occupies the mayor ' s chair must feel that he ' s wearing a straitjacket at times . As the leader of California ' s fifth largest city , Mayor Ernie Kell is faced with the ills common to a major urban_center : A record homicide rate , a looming budget_deficit , neighborhood blight , potholes -- all these headaches , and more , land on his desk . But if Long_Beach residents expect Kell to lead the ship of state through angry shoals , he must do so without oars . He has no vote on the nine-member City_Council . Most of his vetoes can be overridden with a simple majority . In short , it ' s a job that carries little official power . Yet Kell and 12 other candidates are vying for the mayor ' s job . The challengers are an eclectic lot , including two City_Council members , a real_estate magnate , a former city college president , a Marxist , a former minister and a 20-year-old college_student . With so many candidates running , it is unlikely any will garner the necessary majority -- 50 % plus one vote -- required to win the April 12 primary . In that case , the two top vote-getters would meet in a June 7 runoff . Most candidates brush_aside the question of mayoral powerlessness , saying they will overcome this obstacle to beef_up the police_force , cut red_tape and bring national recognition to Long_Beach . In forums across the city , challengers have railed against Kell for failing to create a vision for Long_Beach . These critics charge that for six years , Kell has governed this port city as a sleepy seaside town . And they say his few initiatives have been restricted to downtown and the wealthier Eastside . Kell says critics overlook his tireless lobbying efforts in Sacramento and Washington on behalf of the city , and he wonders if his opponents are simply grandstanding . &quot; Leadership is not standing on a soapbox , taking credit for everything you do , &quot; said Kell , who earns $ 84 # 057 as mayor . &quot; I ' ll match my personal success with anybody. &quot; The mayor ' s race comes at a time when Long_Beach is in transition -- its bustling harbor , gleaming downtown skyscrapers and struggling shopping corridors are all on the cusp of change . Once a predominantly white suburb of Los Angeles , a bastion of Navy and defense industry employees , only a shadow of Long_Beach ' s former image remains . The naval hospital on the city ' s Eastside has closed , and the Navy_base continues to scale back its operations . Defense plants , once the bulwark of a solid middle_class , have laid_off thousands , throwing the city ' s economy into a tailspin . Immigration has created cultural enclaves within the city , a cacophony of new languages and values . As Long_Beach sheds its Iowa-by-the-Sea image , most candidates say the mayor must be an ambassador to business , create more jobs , fill this port city ' s newly expanded Convention Center , its sleek downtown hotels , theaters and boutiques . And the mayor needs to be a diplomat to unite disparate neighborhoods . In this climate of rapid change , several candidates see an opportunity to reshape the skyline , to leave their own sprawling signatures on Long_Beach . &quot; It ' s like someone is giving you a huge canvas , like 20-feet-by-200 , and you can do anything with it , &quot; said Ray Grabinski , who is giving_up his City_Council seat after two terms to run_for mayor . &quot; You can leave one dot on it or create a major landscape. &quot; Whether the mayor will actually be given the paint and brushes to leave a mark has been a matter of some contention . Six years ago , Long_Beach voters elevated the job from a ceremonial post rotated among council_members every two years to a full-time elected position . A citizen ' s task_force that recommended the changes wanted to give the mayor veto powers that would have required a two-thirds council vote to override . But the council watered_down the measure that voters ultimately approved , requiring a simple majority to deny most vetoes . Today , the mayor can propose ordinances and policy_changes , but cannot vote on them . The city_manager draws_up the annual budget , although the mayor presents it to the council with his own recommendations . On budget issues , the mayor has a stronger veto , requiring a vote of two-thirds of the council_members to override . Kell has used his veto twice -- to block a package of budget increases and to force a proposed downtown apartment complex to reduce its number of units . The council voted to override Kell ' s veto on the budget issue , but he prevailed on the development dispute . The mayor also makes appointments to the city commissions that oversee multimillion-dollar projects in redevelopment , planning and the harbor . But the mayor doesn ' t exert any real authority over those agencies , the commissioners say , and his appointments must be approved by the City_Council . In a bid to expand the mayor ' s clout , Kell recently supported a proposed ballot measure to give the mayor a council vote . But council_members -- including mayoral candidates Grabinski and Vice Mayor Jeffrey A . Kellogg -- rejected the plan , saying it could tie_up city business with 5-5 deadlocks . Kellogg said he prefers that the mayor be given stronger veto powers . A vote of two-thirds of the council_members should be required to override all vetoes , he said . Grabinski favors a mayoral vote on the council , but only if the number of council seats is changed to ensure an odd number of voting members . Kell has vowed to lead a grass-roots initiative to put such a measure on the ballot in the future . &quot; The system needs to be changed , &quot; Kell said . &quot; There ' s no way the mayor can operate ( effectively ) without legislative power. &quot; But the mayor has the potential to wield influence beyond the authority that is defined in the City Charter , Kell ' s challengers say . The job can be used as a bully pulpit to attract new business and bring prestige to a city that for decades has lived_in the shadow of Los Angeles . Most challengers insist that Long_Beach needs a brand-name mayor -- such_as a Tom Bradley -- who will work to make Long_Beach a nationally recognized urban_center . &quot; I don ' t think Ernie Kell has been an effective spokesman outside the city_limits , &quot; said Paul Schmidt , a political_science professor at Cal State Long_Beach and an adviser to mayoral candidate Frank Colonna . &quot; Long_Beach is not a ( real ) presence in Sacramento or Washington. &quot; Kell , political insiders say , remains part of the old Long_Beach -- a city that survived on revenues from a booming oil_industry and was proud_of its self-sufficiency . Now that state lawmakers have begun slashing funds to cities to help balance the state budget , Long_Beach can no longer afford to be independent or aloof . &quot; This city will never be what it was , &quot; said candidate Beverly O ' Neill , retired Long_Beach City College president . &quot; I think people look_at us as provincial , but we ' re becoming international. &quot; Opponents complain that Kell doesn ' t even attend national mayoral conferences . Kell says they are a waste_of_time and taxpayer money . Critics contend he doesn ' t bother to attend meetings of the city ' s most powerful commissions . Kell says he doesn ' t want to grandstand , and he is more effective behind the scenes . For example , he says his quiet lobbying trips to the nation ' s Capitol have helped save the Navy shipyard from closing . Rep . Steve Horn ( R-Long Beach ) said Kell and other city officials have worked to keep the shipyard off the Pentagon ' s closure list . Horn , who is not endorsing a mayoral candidate , said Kell has led several delegations to lobby Navy brass in Washington . Kell , 65 , will admit he ' s more comfortable in back_rooms , behind the scenes . He learned politics as a boy growing_up in North_Dakota , where he saw his paternal grandfather ( a Republican ) defeat his maternal grandfather ( a Democrat ) for a seat in the state House of Representatives . After moving to Long_Beach in 1953 , he waged six successful campaigns for council and mayor , building a strong support base . He believes that support will carry him into office again . He recites a list of achievements during his tenure : The $ 111-million Convention Center expansion ; two new police substations , and expansion of the police_force . At his urging , a curfew on teen-agers was revived in January , which he predicts will reduce crime dramatically . The City_Council is considering a Kell proposal to fine parents whose children violate the curfew . Kell prefers to talk_about what he and most of his challengers agree are the key issues in this campaign : crime and jobs . He said he wants to continue adding officers and reservists to the police_force . He also says he will continue to push ahead with plans to convert the site of the closed Naval hospital on the Eastside into a huge discount shopping_center and develop the city ' s waterfront into a major tourist attraction , projects that he estimates would create thousands of jobs . At neighborhood forums across the city , most of the candidates -- squeezed shoulder to shoulder_in metal folding_chairs -- -- begin and end their two-minute messages with a promise to hire more police . Kellogg and O ' Neill pledge to put 100 and 150 more officers on the streets , respectively . Both agree the new salaries could be paid_for by privatizing some city services , such_as the city ' s janitorial services or the police helicopter unit . Colonna favors tripling the number of volunteer reserve officers . He also wants to move the downtown police_headquarters into the city ' s center -- a plot of city-owned land virtually surrounded by Signal Hill -- and introduce mobile substations into the most crime-ridden neighborhoods . Grabinski puts his emphasis on funding more gang intervention and youth recreation programs , but also advocates an increase in the police_force . Perennial candidate Thomas ( Ski ) Demski , a Santa Claus look-alike , would pay_for additional officers by selling the Queen Mary , which he describes as a costly albatross around the city ' s neck . Not everyone agrees that more police are the answer to crime , however . &quot; History has proven you only make problems worse with more oppression , &quot; said candidate Lee Chauser , a Marxist and high_school English_teacher . &quot; It ' s like throwing gasoline on a fire. &quot; G . Juan Johnson , an Amtrak employee , favors more counseling for the homeless and impoverished residents who might commit crimes . Chauser and others stress jobs as one answer to reducing crime . El Nora Willingham , a self-employed motivational specialist , would create marketing councils to welcome new business ; 20-year-old &quot; youth candidate &quot; Terry J . Stidom , a Long_Beach City College_student , would lower business permit fees . Don Westerland , who headed the city ' s Redevelopment Agency board for 6 1 / 2 years , criticizes Kell and City_Hall for stifling new business . He would reduce the number of permits required for business . &quot; Most government people don ' t have a ghost of an idea of what the business person needs , &quot; said Westerland , a former minister who runs Family Service of Long_Beach , a counseling agency . &quot; I ' m talking_about changing the culture at City Hall. &quot; Dan Rosenberg , a retired teacher and longtime council critic , wants to eliminate several city commissions to free up funds for city services . While the candidates seem passionate about these issues as they campaign at chicken-dinner fund-raisers and walk door to door , some political insiders complain that most are trudging a well-worn path . &quot; Not one candidate has come_up with a new or fresh approach to government , &quot; said Jeff Adler , a veteran of several Long_Beach campaigns -- including Kell ' s two previous mayoral bids . &quot; I don ' t think you ' ve heard one big idea . Everyone wants to be safe. &quot; Although the candidates are scrambling to put their names before the voters -- often repeating the same stump_speeches at forums night after night -- they reveal little about their personal histories and motivations . Take Ronnie Barnes . An ordained deacon in a small church and a legal investigator who runs his business from home , he has eight children to support . Yet he plans to spend $ 5 # 000 to $ 10 # 000 of_his_own money to convince voters that God intends him to be the next mayor . &quot; I am proclaiming victory now , &quot; Barnes said . &quot; I can do that because I am obedient to my creator. &quot; Grabinski grew_up on the rough side of the tracks . Born_on Chicago ' s South_Side , he lived_in East Los Angeles , Compton and North Long_Beach , along the way acquiring a tattoo that graces the middle_finger of his right_hand -- a crude bluish dot to show others he was protected by buddies . In Long_Beach , Grabinski said , he found opportunities waiting . He opened three restaurants and won a seat on the City_Council after playing a key role in a neighborhood group ' s fight to block a refinery in the Wrigley district . Beverly O ' Neill grew_up in another working-class neighborhood in central Long_Beach . Her mother worked in a laundry . O ' Neill helped_out by working_at the local J.C. Penney . She enrolled at Long_Beach City College and , four decades later , became the school ' s president . After retiring last June , friends convinced O ' Neill she could repeat her success in the role of mayor . For Colonna , leadership is an old dream . In high_school he says he was the &quot; short , fat kid in horn-rimmed glasses and a buzz cut. &quot; But even then , when girls danced with him only out of sympathy , he says , he had this future mapped_out : a successful business , a family , and then , when the time was right , he would step_forward to lead . The role_model of his dreams is apparent in the large , framed photograph of John F . Kennedy hanging_in his campaign office . Kellogg , a six-year member of the council and vice_president of a commercial real_estate brokerage_firm , is the youngest in a family of success stories . One brother is a U.S. Army general stationed in Europe , another played football for the Denver Broncos and a sister is a psychologist . For his part , Kell bristles_at the mention of someone new moving into his 14th floor City_Hall office that overlooks a downtown skyline he helped shape . He dismisses claims that he is vulnerable to anti-incumbent sentiment or wealthy challengers . Four years ago , he beat five other hopefuls in the primary , then slipped past Councilman Tom Clark by 670 votes to win reelection . The resilient mayor , who has sat on the council nearly 20 years , says he needs another term to finish his work_on the Naval hospital project and other redevelopment plans beyond downtown . &quot; I ' m the one who started the job , I should be the one to finish , &quot; Kell said of the Convention Center expansion and other projects initiated during his tenure . &quot; There ' s something to be said for experience. &quot; Kell says it ' s easy for challengers to point their fingers at a sitting mayor , but questions whether they have offered innovative ideas to address crime , joblessness and other key issues . Attempting to throw the criticism of him back at his challengers , Kell asks : &quot; Where the heck is their vision ? &quot; Candidates for Long_Beach Mayor * Ronnie Barnes Age : 49 Occupation : Legal investigator .
