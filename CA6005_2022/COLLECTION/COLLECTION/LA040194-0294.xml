   <HEADLINE> EASTER GIFTS MAKE RETAILERS HOP FOR JOY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the Easter_Bunny arrives on Sunday , handing_out chocolates and marshmallow eggs , he ' ll also give many children -- and toy makers -- a second chance for those presents that Santa never left under the tree . Easter has become another occasion for children , especially young children , to receive toys and other gifts . It ' s unlikely to reach the magnitude of Christmas , but the holiday still gives retailers and manufacturers a small but welcome lift in sales . Parents have been giving children plush bunnies and similar toys for Easter for years -- it is the biggest holiday in the plush business . But other toys increasingly are making their way into Easter baskets . For some families , Easter gifts are a new tradition . Donna Weber , a Greenlawn , N.Y. , mother of two , said she started giving Easter gifts to her children because &quot; what we ' re trying to do is stay_away_from all this candy. &quot; She buys small gifts such_as books and crayons . Easter gift-giving is not limited to children . Mervyn ' s , the 276-store chain owned by Dayton Hudson Corp . that sells mostly clothing , stocks up_on ceramic gift ware and plush items for the holiday . &quot; We have seen the business in toys and gifts increase over the last few years , &quot; spokeswoman Kathy Blackburn said . * Bloomingdale ' s and other upscale stores are advertising Waterford crystal Easter_eggs and other trinkets aimed at adults . Hallmark sells Easter tree decorations and other collectibles . Still , it is the toy_business that sees the biggest opportunities at Easter . Toys R Us Inc. circulated its spring catalogue well before the holiday and placed inserts advertising a range of toys -- including prominently displayed pastel-colored bunnies -- inside Sunday newspapers . John Taylor , a toy_industry analyst for L.H. Alton &amp; Co. , called the advertising &quot; the first major effort that people have made in a while &quot; to encourage toy-buying for Easter . Playmates Toys Inc. is using Easter to relaunch the Pound Puppies line of plush mutts and another stuffed toy line , Magic Heart Helplings . &quot; Toy manufacturers have noticed that for a long_time , there ' s usually a ( sales ) blip around the Easter season , partly because there ' s more retail traffic , &quot; said Diane Teigiser , director of merchandising for Playmates . Toy makers are &quot; taking_advantage of the fact that more people are in the stores buying clothing for the Easter holidays , &quot; she said . * The Toy Manufacturers of America , a trade group , said that last year manufacturers shipped 9 % of their merchandise during March in preparation for Easter . That compared to 6 % in February and 5 % in April . This year , Tiger Electronics Inc. offered a $ 10 rebate on its popular Toby Terrier toy specifically for the Easter season , spokesman Mark Rosenberg said . The company also is bringing_out a line of preschool electronic games in time for the holiday . &quot; It ' s really something we ' ve focused_on in the last three or four years because Easter has become a major buying holiday , &quot; Rosenberg said . Part of the toy makers ' push at Easter comes from their desire to spread the risks of a business that historically has been concentrated at Christmas . Most of their new product introductions are scheduled for the fourth quarter . The industry &quot; latched_on to other seasons for people to buy toys , &quot; said Bruce Maguire , a spokesman for Tyco Toys Inc. Tyco sells plush toys around Easter , but it has also promoted Magna-Doodle , a drawing toy , as an Easter gift in commercials this spring .</TEXT>
