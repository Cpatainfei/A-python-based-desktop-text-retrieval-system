   <HEADLINE> CLINTON ' S MIS-MANAGED CARE ; DOCTORS CLAIM THEY ARE ALREADY SINKING UNDER A SEA OF RED_TAPE . SOME INSIST IT WILL GET EVEN WORSE UNDER THE PROPOSED HEALTH-CARE PLANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In clamoring for &quot; health-care reform now , &quot; the American public reminds me of the patient who comes_to my office demanding to know &quot; What ' s the_matter , Doc ? &quot; and &quot; What are you going_to do to cure me ? &quot; before I even have a chance to say hello . &quot; Just a minute ! &quot; I have to say . Mere human_beings like myself ( doctors are not God , you know ) have to start by taking a history and doing a physical exam . Only after making a diagnosis -- which they hope is the right diagnosis -- should doctors reach for the prescription pad . Sometimes doctors have to tell patients that yes , there is a medicine that will make their heart stop &quot; skipping beats &quot; ( suppress &quot; PVCs &quot; or premature ventricular contractions ) . The only problem is , the medicine that regulates the heartbeat might also stop it altogether . The majority of patients -- there ' s no room to explain the exceptions here -- would be better_off to tolerate the aberrant beats . In some patients with a complex history of seemingly unrelated symptoms , the most useful part of the examination might not be listening to the patient ' s chest but looking in the shopping_bag filled with the patient ' s medicines . The first one might have been prescribed for the wrong diagnosis , the second for the side_effects of the first , the third to counteract the interaction of the first two , and so on . And there might be some medicines that are causing idiosyncratic side_effects . Sometimes , one can become a real medical hero very simply : Just stop all_the medicines . ( Sometimes. ) This is not the same thing as stopping all treatment and abandoning the patient . Call it a diagnostic test to determine whether the treatment is worse than the disease , or whether it really is the disease . Many of our politicians hope to become heroes and get reelected by giving the American people a &quot; Health Security Card. &quot; They remind me of myself when I was an internal_medicine intern at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas . I saw a man who had come_to the Minor Medicine section of the emergency_room because he had a cold . On listening to his heart , I detected bigeminy ( every_other beat was a PVC ) . The next thing he knew , the man was_on a stretcher being whisked to Major Medicine to have an electrocardiogram . I don ' t know what happened to him after that . At the time , I thought I had made a dramatic save . But 20 years later , I am sure that that patient should have stayed home . There was nothing I could do to prevent his cold from turning_into &quot; double pneumonia , &quot; and there still isn ' t . But our heart medicines could have given him something worse . Our treatment was given with the best of intentions and the most expert advice . The Clinton_Administration tells us that its proposed Health Security Act was devised in consultation with prominent experts in the health-care field . But unlike the doctors at Parkland or any other hospital , these experts didn ' t have to put their signatures on the progress notes or the prescription . In fact , the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons and others had to sue the White_House to find_out the names of task_force members , and , a year later , the White_House is still trying to prevent the public from finding_out who paid how much to whom to do what . Was the plan drafted by special-interest groups ( such_as big insurers , nonprofit foundations , vendors of information technology , bureaucrats ) who stand to profit from it ? The secrecy of the Clinton_Administration ' s Health_Care War Room is one issue . The actual prescription is now out there for everyone to see -- all 1 # 300-plus pages of it . It has a lot in common with most of the other &quot; health_care reform &quot; prescriptions before the U.S. Congress . It creates cartels , empowers bureaucrats and disenfranchises both patients and doctors . These nostrums do not even consider the possibility that the patient -- the health-care system -- is the victim of the legal equivalent of polypharmacy ( too many drugs ) : too_much regulation , too_much management , too many subsidies and too_much of the wrong kind of insurance . What if the chief symptom -- the outrageous cost of medical_care -- is caused by laws that we already have ? In that case , the answer is not to pass 1 # 300 pages of new laws , but to repeal some of the old ones . It would be like stopping highly toxic drugs that are prescribed to &quot; regulate &quot; conditions that are_best left alone . The three proposals receiving the most attention are the Clinton Plan , managed competition , and single payer . The Clinton Plan would force all but the most fortunate citizens into government-controlled , bureaucratic health-care cartels . Managed competition , sponsored by Rep . Jim Cooper ( D-Tenn. ) , is similar to the Clinton Plan but without price_controls . The single payer is a Canadian-style government monopsony that forbids patients to pay directly for medical_care . All are attempts to turn_back the clock to failed systems like mercantilism and socialism , while the rest of the world ( even Sweden ) progresses toward privatization . Their vision is a nationalized health-care system , marching regularly in lock step under the direction of a central monolith . ( The monolith , they imagine , will be under the direction of themselves and their buddies. ) People may swallow the deadly &quot; health &quot; potion because they have forgotten what medicine is about . Medicine is about healing the sick and the injured . The heart of medicine is the relationship of one doctor to one patient . The patient is at the center of the universe . Not the &quot; health-care delivery system &quot; and its ruling bureaucracy . Patients don ' t march in lock step . Every one is unique . When I see a patient , my job is to think_about how to help that patient . Not to build a brave new_world , or to save the planet , or to fight the War on Drugs or the War on Poverty or the War on Crime , or to save money so that the health plan managers can have a fancier cellular_phone , or to achieve a set of social priorities that may require the sacrifice of that one patient . WHEN I APPLIED TO MEDICAL_SCHOOL , I WAS A FAIRLY typical candidate . I said the right things at my interview , like all_the other applicants ( &quot; I like science , and I want to help people &quot; ) . I had engaged in an extracurricular_activity ( debate team ) . But most important in the early 1970s , I had good , non-inflated grades . Medical_schools are now having second_thoughts . Admitting people like me was evidently a mistake . The idea is to build &quot; a new kind of doctor for the 21st Century , &quot; in the words of former Surgeon_General C . Everett Koop , now senior scholar at the C . Everett Koop Institute at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire , but more visible recently as an unofficial member of the Clinton plan entourage . His New Doctor is portrayed as a patient-friendly family physician . Koop would change medical_school curricula to prepare New Doctors , making them , for example , computer literate . But if this idea &quot; doesn ' t catch , &quot; he told one reporter , he is prepared to &quot; just push it. &quot; The New Doctor is supposed to be_full of humanitarianism and empty_of greed . I do not know how to identify such a person in_advance . All the aspirants that I interview for our local medical_school seem to be nice , idealistic young people . Not one has ever told me that he wanted to go_to medical_school to get rich . ( I tell them that if they want to achieve financial security in these uncertain times , they should consider another field. ) How do others , such_as Dr. Koop , look_into the students ' souls ? They can ' t do_it any better than the interviewers of the last generation , who were also looking_for good moral character and humanitarianism . What they can do is demean academic achievement . Although medical_school is reputedly a miserable experience , I had a wonderful time . I thought neuroanatomy and biochemistry were fascinating . I was angry at the innovators who shortened the gross_anatomy curriculum to less than half a year . That wasn ' t nearly enough time to learn all that I thought I needed to know . But Koop told the New Physician magazine in December that a medical_student doing &quot; respite care and helping a family through a health_problem , for example , is ever so_much more important than learning certain intricacies about the anatomy of the hand that you ' ll never use in your life. &quot; But if I ' m a patient with an injured hand , I want my family_doctor to know all about extensor tendons . I don ' t want him to miss a diagnosis . If he makes a lot of money , that ' s good . I want him to be committed to medicine , not pursuing a sideline business to put bread on the table . Patients may disagree about the type of doctor they want to see . To some , willingness to abide_by government regulations and take the government fees override all else . One of my patients was furious when she found_out that I was no longer willing to accept money from Medicare . &quot; I paid my taxes , &quot; she said . &quot; Now those doctors should have to take_care of me. &quot; When asked whether her husband , a barber , should have to give $ 2 haircuts to all who met government eligibility standards , she said , &quot; that ' s different. &quot; ( Actually , I have treated many poor people at a price they could afford -- by mutual choice. ) All patients , poor or rich , are also said to want more family physicians , just as the would-be central planners think they should . Medical_students , however , are turning_away from family practice and internal_medicine . There are a lot of personal reasons for preferring one specialty over another . Some choose pediatrics because they don ' t like old people . Some choose internal_medicine because they can ' t stand screaming babies . Some choose non-patient-care specialties like radiology because they don ' t much like patients . Some opt_for highly paid specialties because they like the field -- or because they are deeply in debt . So what should we do if not enough students choose to follow the socially desired path ? Just push ? ( The Clinton Plan has lots of coercive provisions related to medical education : For example , some physicians who are gifted in a specialty such_as orthopedics will not be allowed to qualify in their field of interest if that field already has its nationwide quota of residents . They would have to study something else. ) Koop ' s New Doctor is supposed to be more &quot; caring. &quot; In fact , I think the New Doctor will be just as human as the old ones but will care less about certain things : He or she won ' t mind being pushed_around . Actually , she will have a whole different perception . What I call being &quot; pushed_around &quot; may seem entirely normal and acceptable , and resistance or noncompliance may be called disruptive and divisive and even antisocial . Here are some examples of managed-care and Medicare situations that are pushing Old Physicians right out of the profession : 1 . Spending hours on hold waiting to talk to a clerk . Doctors have to explain why a patient needs an operation to someone who may never have heard of the procedure . That anonymous someone has the power to deny insurance coverage . 2 . Being forced to work under a Medicare fee schedule devised by Harvard economist William Hsiao . He purports to know how many hours of psychotherapy equal a dislocated toe , but he is blissfully ignorant about rent , the cost of supplies and liability insurance_premiums . The fee schedule is infallible -- there is no appeal . ( Under Medicare , doctors who &quot; overcharge &quot; by as little as 51 cents may have to pay fines of $ 2 # 000 . The Clinton Plan and some others would extend governmental price fixing to all medical services and supplies. ) 3 . Having to answer threat letters from bureaucrats . Going_to see a sick patient in the hospital -- and billing for it -- often brings an accusatory letter from Medicare , especially if a consultant also saw the patient the same day . 4 . Being constantly in a fight . Doctors who happen to see many patients with potentially serious problems can choose between fighting with their conscience or with the powers that control their livelihood . Coping agreeably in the New World will require both New Doctors and New Patients , not the kind we had at Parkland , which received a constant stream of the most &quot; disadvantaged &quot; patients in society -- poor , unwashed , often illiterate and &quot; low sick. &quot; One such patient asked a highly outmoded question : &quot; You the doctor ? &quot; He wanted to see somebody with the responsibility and the authority to do something about his illness . Not a lady with a clipboard . Not a committee . Not a patient advocate or representative . Not a social_worker . He was waiting to see the doctor . The Parkland resident , who was no doubt very tired , fielded the question expertly by firing back another one : &quot; You the patient ? &quot; It has been said that &quot; the patient is the one with the disease &quot; ( Law IV in &quot; The House_of_God , &quot; an irreverent novel by Samuel Shem ) . It is also written : &quot; They that are whole have no need of the physician. &quot; A patient and a doctor : one on one . Singular , not plural . Some call that a &quot; disease orientation , &quot; as opposed to a &quot; wellness &quot; orientation . The focus is_on the sick individual , not on society ' s well-being . Will we have a New System in which there is &quot; universal access &quot; to &quot; health_care &quot; that is &quot; delivered &quot; by various &quot; health-care providers , &quot; including New Doctors and mid-level rationers ? What will that mean to a patient -- a sick_person -- who is waiting to see the doctor ? AT THE SAME TIME REFORMERS say we need universal access to health_care , they complain that in the United States we have too_much access to medical_care , especially high-tech services for the seriously ill . This is irrational , they say . One model for reformers is the Oregon Health Plan : a scheme for explicitly rationing medical_care . A group of Oregonians labored for 20 # 000 hours and finally delivered a list of some 700 health services , ranked in_order of social utility -- the greatest good for the greatest number . The idea is for the Legislature to draw_a_line , based on budgetary constraints . Services above the line are covered under Medicaid , and those below the line are simply unavailable to Medicaid patients . ( Medicaid patients are the experimental subjects ; the idea is to later extend a similar program to all. ) The list has a wellness orientation . Near the top are preventive services ( No . 141 for children and No . 74 for adults ) . Much farther down are certain treatments for conditions that the &quot; preventive &quot; services might uncover . In pediatrics , we were taught always to check for a congenitally dislocated hip . In Oregon , the social value of surgical hip reconstruction was ranked No . 552 in 1991 . It has now been changed to No . 85 , which is still considered less valuable than a general checkup for an adult . Treatments to improve problems caused by cerebral_palsy range from Nos . 203 to 425 . Not very many people have those conditions , so the societal benefit from treating them is small . Also , many treatments do not restore the patient to a normal condition , so , in the view of people who don ' t suffer from the problem , treatment isn ' t worth the cost . The new &quot; compassion &quot; is the opposite of old-fashioned charity . Charity means that those who are better_off choose to help those who are less fortunate . The new compassion means that the healthy are literally to take resources away from the sick and the disabled ( through the intervention of a third_party , of course ) . Resources are always scarce . Therefore , there must be some method of allocating them . ( Many , including Hillary Rodham Clinton , call that &quot; rationing , &quot; but I use the R-word to mean forcible allocations by the government , which has the power to say , &quot; You can ' t have that even though it is available and you can afford it or someone else will help you pay. &quot; ) Today , decisions about medical_care are the product of complex interactions of individuals -- including patients , some of whom are so desperate that they will spend themselves into bankruptcy pursuing pain relief or a reprieve from cancer . Patients , in the view of academic physicians and many other reformers , are not to be trusted to make decisions for themselves . As Rep . Pete Stark ( D-Oakland ) , one of the most powerful players in the reform debate , explained to an audience of managed-care administrators , patients either consider themselves &quot; invincible &quot; when feeling well or they are &quot; absolutely irrational , brain_dead , sniveling , begging , and fantasizing ills and pains. &quot; So who is to make decisions ? Surely not physicians , who are all supposed to be evil and avaricious . Instead , there is to be a new class of policy-makers , decision_makers , managers , medical directors , and ombudsmen . I call them wonks , bureaucrats and pooh-bahs now , but the New Doctor will have to be more respectful . To see the result , we do not need a crystal ball . We can buy a Canadian newspaper . At times , hospitals there buy ads begging for charitable contributions so they can obtain a defibrillator ( the device used to restart the heartbeat in patients who have an &quot; acute dying spell &quot; due_to ventricular_fibrillation , a complication of heart_attacks ) . There are numerous articles about the crisis of rising costs , even as hospital wings are being closed by provincial governments and patients wait months or years for potentially lifesaving surgery . There are also plenty of examples from the U.S. side of the border . Visit the waiting room of your local VA . I used to work_at one -- part of my job was to certify that veterans who had waited all day didn ' t really need medical treatment . Or try to find a copy of the secret contracts signed by doctors who work for some managed-care entities . They may have promised not to say anything critical about their plan . Also , they might have agreed to take a pay_cut if too many patients received too_much care . The plans refer to family_doctors and internists as &quot; gatekeepers. &quot; The idea is the same as at the county hospital , where the interns used to say , &quot; Put a rock at the front door. &quot; WHEN I EMERGED FROM the bureaucratic morass at the VA and went_into solo private practice , I made an astonishing discovery . When I called a consultant about a patient , he said &quot; thank_you &quot; instead of something unprintable . The medical_community was a vibrant one . The prevailing attitude was &quot; Yes I can. &quot; ( At the VA , it was &quot; Oh no you can ' t. &quot; ) We knew we could never defeat death or restore perfect health ; the idea was to think_of something that would help as much as possible . The physicians ' purpose was easy to understand and was right out of the Hippocratic Oath : &quot; I will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone. &quot; Doctors could enjoy the fruits of their long years of study . They had respect . Patients appreciated them and brought_in homemade jelly , pickles and tamales . As the Hippocratic Oath states , &quot; While I continue to keep this oath unviolated , may it be granted to me to enjoy life and the practice of the art , respected by all men and in all times. &quot; Things are different now . A literal translation of the Hippocratic Oath is used in only 6 % of U.S. medical_schools , and a modified version in 42 % . Instead , many New Doctors take oaths that emphasize their responsibility to society with its social ills and delete the inconvenient moral absolutes , such_as &quot; do no harm to anyone. &quot; The oath concludes with &quot; may the reverse be my lot &quot; ( if I swerve from the Oath or violate it ) . Could that be the reason why many physicians are so embittered and unhappy ? The Clinton Plan stands the Hippocratic Oath on its head by making all physicians ' judgment subject_to that of the omnipotent , infallible National Health Board of non-physicians . It mandates a stiff dose of harm to many people -- not just those who will be forced to pay_for it , but the patients whose medical treatment will be delayed , denied or reduced in quality . It completes the process that has already started with the intimate involvement of third_parties ( including government and insurers and other big corporations ) . No more homemade jelly . That might be construed as a bribe or gratuity . The plan will result in severe rationing ; people will inevitably become desperate to , say , get their child into a hospital . But if they offer to pay additional money to the hospital or the doctor , that is a bribe , and the exchange of anything of_value ( I wonder if that includes respect ) to influence the delivery of medical services would be a criminal offense . The penalties include five , 10 , 15 years in prison . If a patient dies , a doctor who had violated one of the rules could be jailed for life . But patients are subject_to jail terms also , as for offering bribes or simply for withholding information from a health alliance ( that carries a five-year sentence ) . Incredible as it seems , many medical associations have endorsed the Clinton Plan -- at least their leaders have . Perhaps many of the profession ' s leaders , deep down in their hearts , share Rep . Stark ' s opinion of their patients . They think they are much smarter than the patient in medical matters , even if the patient is capable of designing a computer . My prescription is basically this : We need to empower patients , not bureaucrats . All patients , of course , need medical advice . Today , they can choose whether to seek advice , and from whom , and whether to take the advice . The Clinton plan will circumscribe those choices for everybody . According to Dr. Daniel Johnson Jr. , speaker of the AMA House of Delegates , private practice will be destroyed by Clinton ' s reforms . The single most important element of any reform is its effect on freedom . True freedom is not the same thing as &quot; choice &quot; -- especially if &quot; none of the above &quot; is not one of the lawful choices . And to exercise freedom , patients need to retain control of their money . Patients should not be forced to spend money on compliance with current regulations that protect us against trivial risks . One rule made by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires a complicated paper trail for disposing_of materials , such_as a soiled diaper or sanitary_napkin , that individuals can send to the landfill without a second_thought . Paper trails require paper sentries : The hospital might not have a nurse to answer your call button , but they surely have a whole wing of administrative staff for complying with Medicare , insurance and OSHA rules . I cannot find_out for_sure what percentage of your hospital charges go_to support this staff , but I ' ve seen estimates of 25 % . Patients should also spend their money themselves rather than turning it over , in_advance , to a middleman . At present , less than 25 % of all medical costs are paid directly by the person receiving the service . The other 75 % passes_through the hands of a middleman first -- an insurer or the government -- and a lot of it sticks_to his fingers . Big insurers today don ' t want to take risks . They want to profit from managing your money . If you put your money in the bank instead of into an insurance_company , it draws interest . Also , when you write a check , the bank just pays_up . When you submit a claim to an insurer or the government , you always have a delay and often a fight . The Clintons want health alliances to control all_the money . Patients should say &quot; no way. &quot; They should take the amount they are now spending on premiums and put about half of it in a special savings account . With the rest , they should buy a low-cost , high-deductible &quot; catastrophic &quot; policy , as opposed to a prepayment plan for consumption of medical services . ( Some insurance_companies don ' t want you to do that because it is less profitable than high-pay , low-deductible plans. ) If most people did this , I predict that medical costs would plummet , care would improve , and the economy would boom , providing productive work for the newly unemployed paper shufflers . ( They could answer call buttons in truly competitive hospitals , for example. ) There is already overwhelming evidence of the superiority of privatization compared to central planning . The early results of a_few experiments are highly favorable . Since 1989 , a utility holding company in Richmond , Va. , has offered a high-deductible , low-cost insurance plan . Employees who choose the plan , as 75 % do , get_to keep the money that is not used in meeting their deductibles . Medical costs have increased only 1 % a year since the plan ' s inception . I ' m for doing more such experiments . How about the advocates of the Clinton Plan ? Will they agree to a competitive test ? Or will they insist on universal coercion to implement a universal plan ? Will they really listen to the patient ( American medicine ) before making a diagnosis ? Or will they rush the patient to the operating room , saw_through the breastbone and pour ice on the heart , without even bothering to charge their defibrillator ?</TEXT>
