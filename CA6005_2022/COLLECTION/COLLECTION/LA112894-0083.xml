   <TEXT> He was a 12-year-old predator , a lean , short-legged war machine with his store-bought camouflage jumpsuit and semiautomatic rifle , muddy helmet in_hand as he coolly surveyed the silent woods above . His boys called him Suicide Mike . He ' s the man , they said . He ' s the vicious runt of the litter , a miniature Rambo . On the field_of_battle , the kid was a force to be reckoned with . Suicide Mike sighed , explaining why he was the meanest little marauder this side of the Antelope Valley Freeway . &quot; I like shooting the hell out of people , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s why I live . Pogs are dead . Now the thing to do is fight wars. &quot; On Michael Daclan ' s 12th birthday , a dozen of his closest friends across the San Fernando Valley devised a suitably manic way to celebrate : Run_around some wooded slopes in full military gear -- hooting and hollering like wild_men , firing automatic weapons , maiming , wounding , killing and being killed . At least temporarily , in a paintball war . Saturdays and Sundays -- and all days in between -- they come , the wacked-out Weekend Warriors , middle-aged Marines and wanna-be war heroes , flocking to places like Close Encounters , near the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeway intersection , doing something most red-blooded American workers only dream of : getting a little macho aggression out of their system . But these are not Natural Born Killers . They ' re yuppies and their children looking_for a woodsy weekend thrill beyond the reach of the suburbs . They ' re married_couples , mothers and sons , brothers and sisters . Robert Shapiro , lead defense_attorney in the O . J . Simpson murder trial , recently brought his teen-age son to Close Encounters for an apparent break from the stresses of the courtroom drama , said owner Mike Schwartz . Out here , armed with weapons that fire not bullets , but small , hollow balls that explode on contact into a messy glob of nontoxic , biodegradable , food-based paint , players stalk the woods like guerrilla warriors in half-hour games that many say provide the adrenaline rush of real battle . &quot; We ' ve had cops and Marines and every_other kind of soldier you can think_of , &quot; Schwartz said . &quot; They all agree this is close to the real_thing . &quot; Out here in the woods , you can enjoy the ultimate thrill of hunting_down another human_being . And at the end of the day , everyone shakes hands and goes_home . Nobody gets hurt . Nobody gets killed , not even animals. &quot; Paintball players form two teams , each of which battles to capture the enemy team ' s flag . They describe the sport as a combination of dodge ball , tag , hide and seek and kick the can -- with the addition of paint pellets zinging through the air . And although they aren ' t lead bullets , the paintballs nonetheless pack a sting . Veteran players , many carrying the scars of battle , liken the sensation to being hit with a sharp rock or stick , or being slapped hard on a sunburned back . Said one player : &quot; Getting hit in the neck is the worst . It ' s like reeling out your fishing_pole and having the hook catch you in the back of the neck . Some guys are sicko . They juice_up their guns so the pellets hit harder , cause you more pain . And those things can hurt , man. &quot; Paintball wars have been around for several years , born of a decades-old practice among East Coast farmers and railroad_men of marking boundaries by firing paint pellets at trees and telephone_poles . &quot; One day , as the story goes , &quot; Schwartz said , &quot; these two ol ' boys turned the paint guns on each other as a joke . One guy shot the other in the butt and they decided to hunt each other . And suddenly , a new sport was born. &quot; Today , battlefield owners like Schwartz say , there are more_than half a_million paintball players nationwide , waging battle on about 500 playing fields . Southern California is dotted with a dozen or so fields . Hundreds gather at Close Encounters each weekend and companies rent the playing_field for private games during the week . Schwartz is a 44-year-old former Navy airplane mechanic who saw non-combat duty during the Vietnam_War , sometimes marching in uniform alongside ant-war protesters , he said . Years later , a friend turned him on to a new sport he called the perfect combination of war and peace . Back in the mid-1980s , though , paintball was still an underground sport played_on &quot; bootleg bandit fields &quot; whose location , like those of &quot; rave &quot; parties , would not be made known until the last minute . So Schwartz went_along and played a game of paintball . It changed his life . In his very first skirmish , Schwartz was posted along a trail , waiting for enemies to come_along so he could shoot them in the back . &quot; I was so nervous I could hear my own heart beating . And so I crouched there , worrying , ' Could anyone else hear it ? ' Then I heard someone coming , listened to the crunching of twigs getting closer and closer and closer . &quot; Finally , I couldn ' t stand it any longer . I popped_up and shot one of my own guys in the chest at point-blank range . To say the least , I was hooked. &quot; Schwartz joined a touring group that staged tournaments to promote the sport . He taught Marines at Camp Pendleton to use the game in training , and coached Boy_Scouts , church and youth groups to use it to work_out their aggressions . &quot; We all have this inherent hunting instinct , &quot; he said . &quot; Because of advancing technology , we no longer have to hunt and kill to survive . But we still need to unleash those survival instincts . These players aren ' t gun-crazed killers . But when they come_out here , their eyes glaze_over . They enter into another world. &quot; Schwartz says the game ' s popularity increased following the Persian_Gulf_War . &quot; It used to be , you wore a pair of fatigues and nobody wanted to look_at you , &quot; he said . &quot; Now war is no longer looked down upon . It ' s not like Vietnam . People believe we did something good in the Persian_Gulf . Paintball has benefited from that. &quot; More_than 80 % of paintball players are men , statistics show . Most of the games are pickup-style -- team members chosen at random moments before the whistle blows . Still , the paintball field has also been the site of some pretty strange battles . Like the executive who , dressed in shirt and tie , took_notes on the play to observe how workers handled pressure and who would emerge as a leader and who would panic . Then there are the Pepperdine fraternity battles . Pistol-armed pledges are given two minutes to hide before being hunted_down by the frat boys with semiautomatic paintball weapons . For the most part , however , Close Encounters caters to the beginner . Schwartz prides himself on &quot; turning wimps to warriors , &quot; teaching tactics and strategy to the wide-eyed and wanting . For $ 35 , players are equipped with a single-fire pistol , a mask and several hundred paint pellets . More sophisticated firepower , camouflage suits and ammunition pouches cost more , which can bring a day ' s expenses to $ 100 or more . At the camp ' s three 40-acre battlefields , beginners have other advantages . Their single-shot guns fire farther than those of more experienced fighters . They also get &quot; reincarnation privileges &quot; -- if killed within the first 10 minutes of battle , they often are allowed to rise and fight again . Other rules put a lid on aggressive emotions . Players can shoot an enemy only twice , not 10 times , before he is adjudged dead . Swearing isn ' t allowed . And players may_not fire from closer than 10 feet . After one battle , Mike Daclan and his boys were breathless -- this wasn ' t war , this was work . They lounged in a rest area reminiscent_of the set of &quot; M.A.S.H. &quot; -- with camouflage-netted tables and tents nestled just over the_hill from the traffic hissing along the Golden State Freeway . &quot; I ' m gasping for air , &quot; said Brad , a 25-year-old advertising salesman . &quot; In this game , you don ' t run_up that hill to capture the other guy ' s flag . You go_for an oxygen tent . This isn ' t flatland out here . After six games , running up- and down-hill , you ' re ready for a stretcher. &quot; Winded , some suffering sprained ankles from stumbling in the woods , the dozen friends were nevertheless jazzed by the battle . &quot; We ' re out here to be little boys again , &quot; said one 16-year-old . &quot; You don ' t have to go , ' Blam-blam-blam , you ' re dead ! ' You hit them with a paintball. &quot; Burbank newlyweds Leticia and Spencer Siegel said they appreciated the work of real soldiers after being both the_hunter and the hunted in the free-for-all gun battles . &quot; It ' s scary at first , &quot; Leticia said . &quot; They blow the whistle and you feel yourself running_for your life . But then you get_to shoot somebody . It ' s like a real war in that way . You get_to say to yourself , ' Yeah , I wasted that guy . One less enemy to worry about. ' So , it ' s pretty cool . It ' s a natural high. &quot; But she tasted death in the same battle . &quot; It was weird . I was face to face with the guy who killed me . But that ' s OK . While I ' m here , I want to experience everything . I want to kill and be killed. &quot; Out on the battlefield , everything is splotched with bursts of wild paintball color : trees , walls , the dirt , even passing dogs . The air , always filled with the zing of pellets , smells of pizza . Somebody on the picnic tables ordered takeout Domino ' s . The whistle blows and the two teams converge under the gaze of a referee . &quot; Keep moving , you jerks ! &quot; someone yells . Zing ! Zing ! The talking head retreats behind a tree , then pops back_out . &quot; What are ya , chicken ? We need some help up here ! &quot; Then the field_general is hit in the shoulder with a splatter of orange paint . Following the rules , he raises his right arm to show he ' s been hit , then treads sulkily off the field . &quot; I can ' t believe it ! &quot; he says . &quot; Just like that , I ' m dead . It ' s not fair , dude. &quot;</TEXT>
