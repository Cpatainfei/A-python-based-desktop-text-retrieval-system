   <HEADLINE> IRAQ REPORTEDLY MASSING TROOPS IN KURDISH AREA ; MILITARY : U.S. CAUTIONS BAGHDAD AGAINST USING FORCE AGAINST POPULATION IN THE NORTHERN REGION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Iraq has moved more_than 2 # 000 elite troops into a largely Kurdish area north of Baghdad , drawing a stiff warning from the United States against any military_action , senior U.S. officials said Friday . &quot; The Iraqis have moved four battalions of Republican Guard infantry into the area around Mosul , &quot; an official said , citing U.S. intelligence reports . &quot; We want to make_it clear to the Iraqi government that we will continue . . . to enforce ( United Nations ) Security_Council resolutions in that area . It would be unwise of them to test our resolve. &quot; The Security_Council has prohibited Iraq from mounting offensive military operations against the Kurds , a non-Arab ethnic_group that is the majority of the population in northern Iraq . &quot; We have seen this kind of troop movement before , but this is a higher level than we ' ve seen in more_than a year , &quot; the official said . &quot; Whether it is just saber-rattling or whether he intends to challenge the U.N. , we don ' t know. &quot; At the United Nations in New York , U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told the Security_Council of the troop movements , a spokesman said . &quot; We do not know whether ( Iraqi President ) Saddam Hussein intends to renew his offensive against his own people , but he clearly wishes to intimidate them , as well as the Security_Council , &quot; Albright said , according to her spokesman , James P . Rubin . Albright denounced the troop movements in a closed-door Security_Council debate over a proposed statement on Iraq ' s degree of compliance with the 1991 cease-fire that ended the Persian_Gulf_War . The 15-nation council agreed Wednesday to maintain economic sanctions against Iraq but was divided over whether to praise Hussein for cooperating with U.N. weapons inspections . Russia , China and France supported a proposed statement that would have lauded Iraq ' s cooperation , but the United States and Britain were opposed . Iraq is asking the United Nations to lift its embargo on oil exports , the country ' s main product . The U.N. resolutions that imposed the embargo said it could be lifted if Iraq openly declared and destroyed all its ballistic_missiles and other weapons of mass destruction and agreed to international monitoring . Iraq claims to have met those conditions , but the United States disagrees .</TEXT>
