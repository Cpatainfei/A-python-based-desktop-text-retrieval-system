   <HEADLINE> SPACE-AGE ROLE_MODEL FOR GIRLS ; CAREERS : JUDITH COHEN , WHO WORKED_ON THE APOLLO 12 LUNAR MISSION , HOPES HER BOOKS INSPIRE FEMALE STUDENTS TO PURSUE CHALLENGING FIELDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Judith Cohen was growing_up in the 1930s and ' 40s , she excelled in math , and danced well enough to gain an audition with New York ' s Metropolitan Ballet . Cohen ' s mother made no secret of what path she preferred for her daughter . &quot; ( My ) mother always told me that I should be using my head , and not my feet , &quot; said Cohen . So Cohen used her head . She studied engineering at Brooklyn College in New York for two years , and then went_to work_at North_American Aviation ( now Rockwell ) while attending USC . In the same period in which she got_married and had three children , Cohen worked_on the country ' s first satellite and on the guidance system for the Apollo 12 lunar_excursion_module . Now 60 , Cohen is a part-time author . Two years ago , she wrote &quot; You Can Be a Woman Engineer. &quot; In 35 pages written for elementary_school students , Cohen tells how she loved looking_at the universe through a telescope , and of her realization that she could be an engineer . Since then , she has co-written a series with other women in fields traditionally dominated by males . The series , colorfully illustrated by husband David Katz , includes the titles &quot; You Can Be a Woman Architect , &quot; &quot; You Can Be a Woman Marine Biologist &quot; and other books dealing with Egyptology , paleontology , zoology and oceanography . The series is intended to address a problem pointed_out in study after study : that girls are overlooked and undervalued in most coeducational classes , especially in math and science . Cohen and oceanographer Florence McAlary will read excerpts from their books at 11 a.m. Saturday at the Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore in Marina del Rey . The idea for the series grew out of a monthly column Cohen wrote for Engineer of California magazine while she was working for TRW . In 1990 , she wrote a piece about her life as an engineer . Her husband , a part-time teacher in the Los Angeles school district , saw a need for more of that kind of writing . &quot; My husband would talk to girls at the schools , and ask what they wanted to be when they grew_up , &quot; said Cohen . &quot; They ' d always say , ' I don ' t know. ' So he decided there was a need for something like this. &quot; Katz encouraged his wife to write her story for girls . When they completed the book , their distributor asked them also to do a Spanish version . And he suggested they do a series . In her first book , which Cohen and her husband published from their home_in Culver City , she wrote_about the excitement and challenges of nearly 30 years as a pioneering female in aerospace engineering -- in about 900 words . She graduated from USC with a degree in electrical_engineering in 1957 . Two years later , she went_to work for TRW , where she worked_on the first communications satellites sent into space . She earned a master ' s degree in electrical_engineering from USC in 1962 . Working on the backup guidance system for the Apollo 12 lunar_excursion_module , the capsule that landed on the moon , and then watching the historic moon landing was memorable , she said . But her proudest moment came during the next lunar mission . &quot; The astronauts couldn ' t land ( on the moon ) because of a system malfunction . A fuel tank blew_up . So they had to turn_off the power on the main system to get_back to Earth , &quot; said Cohen . &quot; I worked_on the backup guidance system , and that is what got them back. &quot; Later , she met an astronaut who told her that the guidance system saved the lives of the astronauts aboard Apollo 13 . &quot; I always thought that was amazing. &quot; Later , in the 1980s , she worked_on the satellite that NASA uses to send data back and forth from the Hubble Space Telescope . Explaining physics and advanced biology to a 10-year-old , said Cohen , was one of the biggest challenges of the series . &quot; The scientists get frustrated because I want to limit the book to 900 words , and they have thousands of words they want to use , &quot; she said . The books reached a wider market than she expected . &quot; The marine biologist book has been out two years , and high_school girls are the biggest customers , &quot; said Cohen . Adults like the books because they make sophisticated scientific concepts easy to comprehend . The books were initially sold at museums , including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . The Museum of Contemporary Art bought copies of the architect ' s book , while the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla sells the oceanographer ' s book . Teachers in the Los Angeles school district have bought about 1 # 000 of the books , which sell for $ 6 , and sales have increased by word_of_mouth . So far , Cohen said , about 18 # 000 have been sold . Earlier this week , Caroline Saleh and her 9-year-old daughter , Sarah , drove to the Marina del Rey bookstore from Redlands to buy Cohen ' s books . &quot; We had heard about her before , and we had seen the books , &quot; said Saleh . She said her daughter is interested in a science career . They bought &quot; You Can Be a Woman Oceanographer. &quot; &quot; I think it ' s good to encourage the girls to get_into those fields . So I came all_the way_out here just for these books. &quot; Cohen ' s next project will be a biography for children on the pioneer environmentalist and author Rachel Carson . Cohen then hopes to find a woman astronomer to help her write a book . Cohen retired from TRW in 1990 and works as a consulting engineer for companies including Litton Data Systems in the San Fernando Valley and Logicom in San Pedro . She ' s also learning LOTUS to help people set_up their own computer_systems . During a recent book reading , Cohen said she handed_out paper to the younger children to draw_on . While she was reading her book on being a woman engineer , Cohen said , a 6-year-old girl was busily sketching a rocket ship carrying a woman astronaut . &quot; That was so exciting , that a 6-year-old could see herself in the spaceship , &quot; Cohen said . &quot; And it ' s great that I can take_part in helping someone take_away this message. &quot;</TEXT>
