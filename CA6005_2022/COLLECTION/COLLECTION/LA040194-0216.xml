   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : BUDDHIST FEDERATION TO JOIN CELEBRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Plans by the Los Angeles Buddhist Federation , a Japanese-American group of seven Downtown congregations , to join the annual inter-ethnic celebration of Buddha ' s birthday this year have won praise from two temple leaders in the San Fernando Valley . Although some Japanese Buddhist clergy outside Little Tokyo have taken_part in past communitywide observances , this year the federation volunteered to act_as co-host for Sunday ' s event in Downtown Los Angeles with the multiethnic Buddhist Sangha Council of Southern California . &quot; I think it ' s wonderful for people to come_together , and it ' s good for outsiders to see this unity , &quot; said the Venerable Sumanatissa Barua , a spokesman for the Wat Thai Temple in North Hollywood . He estimated that about 50 monks and lay people will go from the Thai temple . &quot; It ' s very exciting , &quot; said the Rev . Kakyue Tada of the San Fernando Valley Hongwanji Buddhist Temple in Pacoima . &quot; I ' m looking_forward to attending if time permits. &quot; An estimated 500 # 000 people in Southern California observe Buddha ' s birthday on various dates in the spring because of differing traditions . Japanese Buddhists mark the birthday 2 # 500 years ago of Gautama_Buddha , or Hanamatsuri , around April 8 , but Buddhists of other ethnic traditions observe Wesak , which commemorates both the birthday and Enlightenment , around the time of the full_moon in May . Although congregations pick convenient weekend dates to have their own observances , the Sangha Council sought each year to choose one date for all groups to celebrate together . But the council had been unable to persuade federation representatives to participate in previous years . But early this year , the Rev . Gyoken Kuroyanagi of the Nichiren Shu Temple in Los Angeles approached the Venerable Havanpola Ratanasara , director of the Sangha Council , to suggest that a common Buddha ' s birthday celebration be held April 3 at the Japanese-American Cultural Center . Coincidentally , the program will fall on the same day Catholics and Protestants celebrate Easter . The reasons the Japanese-American federation had shown little interest in pan-Buddhist observances before , Kuroyanagi said , &quot; are very complicated . It is a hard question. &quot; The Venerable Karuna Dharma , an associate of Ratanasara , said the reluctance may be partly because Japanese Buddhism , especially the federation , is the oldest Buddhist community in Southern California and its leaders haven ' t felt the need to take_part in inter-Buddhist events . &quot; that ' s changing now because a lot of young ministers are interested in reaching_out , &quot; she said . Tada , whose Pacoima temple dedicated a new building in 1992 , is a member of the Sangha Council and has usually attended the communitywide observances . If he misses it this year , it will be because his temple holds its own Hanamatsuri festival on Sunday starting at 9:30 a.m. The inter-ethnic celebration Downtown is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. The program includes a parade at noon and a religious_service at 1 p.m. JOHN DART</TEXT>
