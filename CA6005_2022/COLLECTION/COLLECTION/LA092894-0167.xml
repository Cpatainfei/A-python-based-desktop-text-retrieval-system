   <HEADLINE> ASPCA MEETS IN BURBANK , 1ST TIME OUTSIDE NEW YORK ; PROTEST : ANIMAL-RIGHTS ACTIVISTS SAY GROUP USES PETS AS A FRONT FOR ITS FUND-RAISING ACTIVITIES IN MANHATTAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , the country ' s largest animal welfare group , Tuesday held its annual meeting outside New York for the first time in 128 years , which protesters contended was an attempt to escape controversy there . But a half-dozen or so animal-rights activists showed_up anyway to conduct a brief protest , calling the ASPCA &quot; a fund-raising organization that uses animals as a front. &quot; The protesters who lined_up outside the Burbank Airport Hilton hotel were forced to leave by the hotel ' s management after about 20 minutes of handing_out literature and waving placards . Still , Felicia Sukur , an organizer of the protest , said she believes the group sent a message to ASPCA officials that &quot; they can ' t run from the truth just by running_away from New York , &quot; where the organization has its headquarters . &quot; They ' ve been looked_into by both the state_attorney general and the Manhattan district_attorney ' s office , &quot; Sukur said . &quot; People in New York are starting to become very disgusted with this organization and its problems , and I think they felt there would be a lot of protest if they met there , but we followed them. &quot; About 100 people attended the ASPCA meeting at the hotel to hear reports on the workings of the nonprofit organization , which has a $ 22 million budget , employs about 225 people and has more_than 300 # 000 contributing members nationwide . Officials conceded that , since its founding 128 years ago , the organization had always met in New York , but said it met in Burbank this year because the organization is expanding its operations in the Los Angeles area and because it is in the process of pulling_out of the New York City animal shelter system , which it has managed under contract for 100 years . The ASPCA ' s $ 4.5-million annual contract with New York City will not be renewed , and the shelters will be managed by a new not-for-profit organization created by the city , officials said . &quot; We are in a state of transition , &quot; said John Foran , executive_vice_president and chief administrative officer . &quot; We ' re getting_out of the business of running shelters and moving toward attacking the problem of massive dog and cat overpopulation throughout the country. &quot; In New York , the ASPCA has been the target of intensive press scrutiny . Earlier this year , the New York Post published a series of articles on what the Post called the &quot; Puppy-Gate &quot; scandal , saying ASPCA workers were padding their salaries , some making twice their annual base pay in overtime . The protesters outside Tuesday ' s meeting were members of the Harry Bergh Coalition , named for the ASPCA ' s founder . They said that they are convinced the organization is rife_with financial misconduct , and that they believe probes by the New York state_attorney general into allegations of charity fraud , and by the Manhattan district_attorney into charges of health violations at a shelter , failed to clear the society . &quot; This is a city of 8 million people , with only two animal shelters . One of them is in the city ' s most crime-infested neighborhood and the other one has been cited because the animals were living_in such poor conditions , &quot; said Livi French , founder of the Bergh coalition , in a telephone_interview from New York . &quot; They are a nationwide organization whose purpose is to raise money . They do not care about New York ' s animal overpopulation problem. &quot; Foran conceded that the ASPCA has had its share of problems in recent years . He said he joined the organization about one year ago , at a time when about 20 high-ranking officials were discharged by the board of directors after questions about the society ' s finances . But he said charges that the ASPCA is more concerned with cash than animal welfare are &quot; ludicrous , &quot; and that the society was given &quot; a clean bill_of_health &quot; after the probes by both the state_attorney general and the city_district attorney .</TEXT>
