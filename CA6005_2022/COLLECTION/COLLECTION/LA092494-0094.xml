   <HEADLINE> SEMINAR URGES THE REPORTING OF SUSPECTED CHILD_ABUSE ; SOCIAL_SERVICES : THE MEDINA TORTURE CASE IS CITED AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW CRUCIAL IT IS THAT TEACHERS , DOCTORS ALERT AUTHORITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With Orange County ' s first child torture case as a backdrop , 80 teachers , social_workers , doctors and religious_leaders attended a daylong seminar Friday designed to dispel their fears about reporting suspected cases of child_abuse . The seminar for people required by law to report their suspicions of child_abuse included tours of Orangewood Children ' s Home and Juvenile and Family Court . Featured speakers included Family Court judges , social_services officials and a deputy district_attorney . &quot; We ' re just hoping to encourage people to report cases of abuse by giving them a sense of how the system works , &quot; said Jeanie Ming , a pediatric nurse with the Social_Services Agency ' s child_abuse services team . &quot; People want to know about what happens after they file a complaint. &quot; The furor over Orange County ' s first child torture case has led to a heightened awareness in recent weeks of the role and legal responsibilities of teachers , social_workers , police , doctors and others who are required by law to report suspected abuse . According to authorities , on Sept . 7 , Cynthia Medina , a 31-year-old Orange woman , seared her 10-year-old nephew ' s tongue with hot knives , then anally penetrated him with a baseball_bat as punishment for playing with her marijuana_cigarettes . The child ' s injuries were so severe that he had to undergo surgery . The abuse came_to the attention of authorities the next day , when Medina and her husband took the child to a doctor , alleging that he had fallen on the bat in a freak accident , authorities said . After examining the child , the doctor faxed a child_abuse complaint to the Orange County Child_Abuse Registry . A social_worker dispatched to the home examined the child and immediately ordered him hospitalized , according to social_services officials . Although some children ' s advocates were critical of the doctor ' s decision to send the child home with the Medinas , Deputy Dist . Atty . Charles J . Middleton said Friday that authorities credit action by both the doctor and the social_worker in saving the boy ' s life . Speaking at Friday ' s seminar , Middleton alluded to the Medina case in stressing the legal responsibility of attendees to report suspicions of abuse . &quot; There is a crime committed when a case is not reported to social_services , &quot; Middleton said . Lori Marshall , a pediatric nurse at Children ' s Hospital of Orange County , said that criticism of the doctor involved in the Medina case is unfair . &quot; People make assumptions that because you are medical people , you have the expertise to determine if something is child_abuse , &quot; she said . &quot; One of the things we ' re trying to do now is educate medical professionals . The need is apparent when you have a case like this that is so blatant. &quot;</TEXT>
