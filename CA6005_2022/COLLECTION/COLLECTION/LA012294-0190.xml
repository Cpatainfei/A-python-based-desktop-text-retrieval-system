   <TEXT> Four powerful aftershocks hit the San Fernando Valley in an hour Friday as public parks swelled with new_waves of the homeless and all_of Los Angeles braced for yet another trial this weekend : rain . A Pacific storm was expected to approach Southern California between Saturday and Monday , bringing the possibility of winds and as much as half an inch of rain . Many of the estimated 14 # 500 quake refugees sleeping_in public parks and parking_lots scrambled to buy protective gear , from ponchos to tarps large enough to cover an entire family . The National_Guard raced to set_up tent cities at six sites across the Valley , enough to shelter 6 # 000 people . &quot; Californians usually welcome rain , &quot; meteorologist Harry Woolford said . &quot; But not this time . For many people , it couldn ' t be a worse weekend for rain. &quot; Even as power was restored to virtually all_of Los Angeles and the water was deemed safe to drink_in some parts , the four powerful jolts at midmorning Friday reminded residents that this seismic dance was not over . The aftershocks , which ranged_in magnitude from 4.0 to 4.6 and were centered three miles northwest of San Fernando , fit the expected pattern for a quake the size of Monday ' s early morning magnitude 6.6 shaker . In other developments Friday : * Police were used to maintain order at federal disaster centers overwhelmed by frustrated quake victims . A 12th center opened in Sherman Oaks , but lines were long and the red_tape was thick . The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency promised to open six more centers by next week -- including one tomorrow in South-Central Los Angeles -- and President Clinton ordered centers staffed until 10 p.m. But on Friday , there were mostly long , angry , tearful queues to get appointments to see a relief worker days or weeks in the future . &quot; We ' re living in our car , &quot; one woman cried plaintively as a FEMA worker begged for patience . * The death toll in Los Angeles County rose to 55 as four more fatalities were reported by the coroner ' s office . All died on the day of the quake , but no other details were released . In San Bernardino County , an autopsy on Elizabeth Brace found that the Rancho Cucamonga mother widely reported to have died when she fell and hit her head on her child ' s crib during the quake had no broken bones . She may have died of excess adrenaline caused by fear , said Dr. Frank Sheridan , the county ' s chief medical_examiner . * The Los Angeles Unified School District said that it will open all but 97 of its hardest hit campuses Tuesday . The schools to remain closed indefinitely are all_in the West Valley , Supt . Sid Thompson said . School authorities are hoping that safe portions of those campuses , where more_than 100 # 000 students are enrolled , can be opened soon . * Mayor Richard Riordan said he will urge businesses to stagger work schedules and use four-day weeks and telecommuting to alleviate traffic_jams . Such measures were highly successful in preventing tie-ups during the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics . Ramps connecting the Glendale and Ventura freeways were closed so engineers could inspect damage from the aftershocks . Transportation officials came_to the grim conclusion Friday that alternate routes can handle only 60 % of the traffic being diverted from broken freeways . * The number of uninhabitable buildings in Los Angeles reached 1 # 175 as inspectors continued to fan_out through the city . The red- and yellow-tagged structures encompass 4 # 800 housing units . The city pledged to demolish buildings at no cost to owners and to pick_up street rubble in the Valley this weekend if residents will place it at the curb . * The Los Angeles Police_Department said it would stay fully mobilized at least through the weekend , keeping officers on 12-hour shifts with no days_off . Although officers report that crime has been remarkably low since the quake , they are busy assisting the displaced and patrolling ravaged area to guard against looters . * The federal_government , which normally covers such emergency assistance costs as police , firefighting and water delivery for the first 72 hours after a disaster , announced Friday that it will pay such expenses for an additional five days -- through Jan . 25 -- and possibly longer if necessary . * Friday also brought promises from politicians at every level of government about expediting aid . Henry Cisneros , secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development , said he will speed_up approval of $ 83 million in housing vouchers , low-interest loans and other quake aid . State legislators promised to introduce bills to increase tax_deductions for earthquake damage and speed unemployment benefits . And the City_Council asked the Department of Water and Power to find a way to offer customers in the quake zone discounts or payment deferrals on their water and electric_bills if their homes were damaged or destroyed . The Next Test Los Angeles struggled toward recovery Friday in fits and starts that felt_like one step_forward and two steps back . Electricity was restored to virtually all_of the city ; only a handful of customers remained without power . But 20 # 000 customers from the Valley to the Santa Monica Mountains were still without water . Tap_water south of the Santa Monica Mountains was declared safe to drink without being boiled , but water_supplied north of Sunset Boulevard was expected to remain unsafe at least through the weekend . Then came word of possible rain . The weather ' s unfortunate turn came as inspectors declared building after building uninhabitable and the newly homeless headed to parks and parking_lots for a place to sleep . The encamped population climbed from 13 # 800 to about 14 # 500 . Forecasters warned that a storm 700 miles off the Northwest coast and heading east could cause trouble for Los Angeles , pushing a cold_front through the area and posing a 40 % chance of light rain . Working frantically to beat the storm , emergency workers scrambled Friday to convince earthquake victims to leave city parks . Huge National_Guard tents such_as those used to shelter people who lost homes_in Hurricane Andrew had been delivered and were were being erected for emergency shelter . The sites selected as of Friday were Lanark Recreation Center in Canoga Park , Reseda Recreation Center , Valley Plaza Recreation Center , North Hollywood Park , West Valley Park and Winnetka Recreation Center in Northridge . GTE also has donated a tent in San Fernando . In addition to the tents , 32 Red_Cross centers were housing thousands . But efforts to clear the parks stalled despite the presence of &quot; reassurance teams &quot; that fanned_out to urge people to leave their camps and head to city shelters . Although some of those who were camped_out took that advice , new arrivals outnumbered them . &quot; This is big , &quot; said Geoffrey Garfield , an aide to Mayor Richard Riordan . &quot; It ' s our major effort right now . . . . We have to get the people out of these encampments. &quot; The decision to put_up the tents was made reluctantly and only after city officials became convinced that there was no other way to protect dislocated people from the coming rains . After Hurricane Andrew hit Florida , the tent cities became near-permanent encampments , and it took the concentrated efforts of law_enforcement agencies to ultimately force some people out of the tents . Nevertheless , Riordan and other city officials recommended Friday that the tents go_up before the rain arrives , possibly Saturday night or early Sunday morning . The storm is expected to taper_off to scattered showers by Monday . &quot; Some people may get the feeling they can stay there permanently , &quot; Riordan conceded . &quot; But with the rains coming , we have no choice. &quot; As the weather reports predicted an uncomfortable weekend , residents kept a wary eye on the darkening sky and hunted_down provisions . Outside the Home Depot in Canoga Park , Billaldo Jeronimo held_up his new tarp . &quot; We sleep outside in the parking_lot of our apartment , &quot; said the 18-year-old , who has been living_in a makeshift camp in North Hills with his wife and 6-month-old son . &quot; On Saturday , they say it will rain and we will have only this. &quot; Jack Welsh of Canoga Park also shopped for gear , just hoping to stay dry . When asked what he would do if faced with the choice of getting wet or re-entering his quake-damaged home , he replied : &quot; I ' m taking the rain outside. &quot; Meanwhile , as phone_calls deluged the Valley from throughout the world , Pacific Bell officials in the company ' s Northridge processing center struggled to repair roofs that could leave equipment exposed to the weekend rains . The center is handling 12 million calls a day , 7 million more_than normal . More Aftershocks At times there is a sense that the city could handle almost anything , even the rain , if the shaking would only stop . The swarm of aftershocks that hit at midmorning Friday sent the already shellshocked diving for cover_for a fifth day . The earth ' s rocking set_off a fire at a collapsed apartment_building on Victory Boulevard in Reseda when the shaking caused a car trapped beneath the building to ignite , Los Angeles City Fire_Chief Mike Littleton said . &quot; With the aftershocks moving things around , the car ' s frayed wires rubbed together and ignited the fire which spread to the building , &quot; he said . The blaze was controlled in less than an hour -- even though the building was deemed too dangerous for firefighters to venture inside . Residents were moving their belongings out of another condemned building nearby when National_Guard troops began yelling &quot; Fire ! Fire ! &quot; &quot; Me and my mom dropped what we were carrying and ran_out of the building , &quot; Charla Pang said wearily . &quot; All we want to do is get our stuff into storage and then find a place to live. &quot; Following the aftershocks , Cal State Northridge President Blenda Wilson announced that all 53 of the major structures on campus would have to be reinspected before a final damage assessment is made . Until Friday , engineers had been prepared to announce that 80 % of the buildings had made_it through the temblor and its initial aftershocks without debilitating structural damage . The campus may reopen by Feb . 14 , two weeks later than the scheduled start of the new semester . &quot; We might have to hold classes in trailers , community education buildings , churches and community agencies , &quot; Wilson said . Burying the Dead As the earth kept rumbling , Los Angeles residents began the grim task of burying the dead . Ted Fichtner , the first quake victim to be laid_to_rest , was interred in blue_jeans and a flannel shirt given to him by residents of the Chatsworth Lake neighborhood who had adopted him 10 years ago when he was homeless . Fichtner died inside the donated camper in which he lived_on a Van Nuys street when a microwave_oven fell and struck him in the head . Two hours later , 4-year-old Amy Tyre-Vigil was remembered in a service at a Reseda temple . Her short life was filled with promise and possessions -- different from Fichtner ' s in many ways -- but it ended within minutes of his when her parents ' affluent Sherman Oaks hillside house collapsed around her . The casualty count from the earthquake continued to rise Friday and hospital officials expressed alarm about the dwindling number of beds in county intensive care units . These are the beds for the most acutely ill , people on life support who need 24-hour care . There are 1 # 750 such beds in the county , but only 216 remained unoccupied as of midday Friday . &quot; We ' re becoming concerned , &quot; said David Langness , a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California . He said hospitals in San Bernardino , Ventura and Orange counties have been put_on alert . In addition to the usual run of heart_attacks , difficult pregnancies and other patients with potential life-threatening diseases , county hospitals have had to cope_with nearly 1 # 300 patients admitted for earthquake-related injuries , some of them in critical condition . Adding_to the problem are the 915 patients who were evacuated from more_than two_dozen quake-damaged hospitals . Three hospitals remained totally shut_down : St . Johns Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica , the Veterans Administration Hospital in Sepulveda , and the Psychiatric Hospital in the Los Angeles County-USC Medical_Center Complex . Many others were operating at reduced levels . The Hospital Council of Southern California said that 6 # 547 patients had been treated and released from hospitals since Monday ' s quake and that 1 # 292 patients were admitted for treatment . Government Tries to Help Friday also brought more promises from government officials who say they are expediting aid to quake victims , but it could be weeks before housing and other forms of emergency aid will be distributed by disaster centers . About $ 83 million in federal money that was to arrive in July for job training and low-income housing construction primarily in South-Central Los Angeles will be delivered immediately . A total of $ 200 million will be available throughout Los Angeles County . Councilman Mike Hernandez and other city officials praised Cisneros for moving quickly to respond to the city ' s needs . &quot; It ' s the kind of stuff that we didn ' t get during the civil disturbances , &quot; he said . Councilman Joel Wachs said Cisneros has been &quot; remarkable. &quot; A bill passed_by the Legislature and signed into law Thursday night by Gov . Pete Wilson extends the arraignment period for criminal suspects from 48 hours to seven days . The legislators said such a move was necessary because there are several quake damaged courthouses where arraignments can not take_place . The bill will expire after 30 days .</TEXT>
