   <HEADLINE> WOULD-BE RIVAL PLANS CHALLENGE TO PHONE FIRMS ; TELECOM : TELEPORT WANTS TO OFFER LOCAL SERVICE TO COMPANIES PROVIDING ACCESS TO COMPUTER RESOURCES SUCH AS THE INTERNET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s illegal for anybody but the local telephone monopoly -- presumably Pacific Bell or GTE -- to offer local telephone_service in California , right ? Maybe . Teleport Communications Group , a would-be rival of those two giants that is backed by the cable TV industry , has asked the state Public_Utilities Commission for permission to introduce local phone_service on a limited basis to companies seeking to provide access to the Internet and other computer-based information resources . If the PUC grants Teleport ' s request , which was presented to the commission Friday , it will simply be making kosher an activity in which Teleport is already engaged , more or less . By an interesting quirk -- one perhaps technically in violation of telecommunications regulations -- Teleport is providing local exchange service on a very small , experimental scale to a San Francisco start-up company that plugs its 100 customers into the Internet , the expansive network of electronic networks . The fledgling Internet &quot; gateway &quot; company , called Hooked , sought_out Teleport ' s services after a Centrex system installed by Pacific Bell in mid-March failed to meet its needs . By not charging Hooked for the connections , Teleport maintains that it is not reselling local phone_service and therefore not acting illegally . But company officials acknowledge that Pacific Bell might view things differently . &quot; We ' re seeking to provide this service in response to consumers who have had so_much trouble with their monopoly phone_company that they are literally in danger of being put_out of business , &quot; said Jim Washington , Teleport ' s western region vice_president , based in San Francisco . &quot; Our customers are desperate for service. &quot; In December , California regulators disclosed their intention to deregulate the state ' s telecommunications industry , basically opening long-distance and local markets to unbridled competition by 1997 . Like a camel insinuating its nose under the tent , fast-growing Teleport -- a 10-year-old firm based in Staten Island , N.Y. -- hopes to position itself to take_advantage of deregulation through the fiber-optic networks and switching capabilities it has in place . Teleport already has a robust business linking corporate customers to long-distance carriers in more_than 150 major markets , including Los Angeles , San Francisco and San Diego . Local phone_service would be a natural extension , and Teleport officials said they expect the company will have as_many as five customers like Hooked within a year if the PUC grants its request . Teleport is owned by a bevy of telecommunications and media powerhouses , including Cox Enterprises Inc. , Tele-Communications Inc. , Comcast Corp . and Continental Cablevision Inc. Time Warner Inc. has also agreed to buy a stake . David Holub , a founder of Hooked , testified about his experience Friday at a hearing in Sunnyvale before state regulators and representatives of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration , which is wrestling with deregulation , access and other issues . To be fair , he said in a telephone_interview later , Pacific Bell has offered to supply the connections he needs and has apologized &quot; for all_the confusion. &quot; However , he added , he would prefer to stick_with Teleport ' s service , which he said is technically superior . &quot; I feel_like a bit of an Internet poster child , &quot; he said ruefully , &quot; a small company trying to get_off the ground. &quot; Competition , he said , would benefit customers like Hooked . Pacific Bell has maintained that it favors competition but wants to ensure that all contenders operate under the same rules . &quot; It would appear that Teleport is trying to prematurely offer ( these ) services , &quot; said Michael Runzler , a spokesman for Pacific Telesis , the parent of Pacific Bell . He said the company will oppose Teleport ' s application . The cable industry , meanwhile , says Pacific Bell itself is trying to sneak into new business_lines ahead of regulatory approval . Last week , the California Cable_Television Assn . asked the Federal Communications Commission to look_into whether Pacific Bell has begun building a statewide video network before receiving the necessary federal approvals . The phone_company acknowledges that it will begin laying new cable this month with video in mind , but it insists it will not offer video services until the FCC gives its OK .</TEXT>
