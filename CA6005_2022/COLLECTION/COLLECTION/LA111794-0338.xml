   <HEADLINE> THE COLLEGES / STEVE ELLING : RECRUITS WONDER IF NORTHRIDGE ' S DIVISION I DAYS ARE NUMBERED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The recruiting pitch contained all_the usual elements . Verbal pomp and circumstance , crepe and bunting , all to sell prospective athletes on the successes of the school ' s athletic program . First , regale them with stories from last year ' s cool road trips to big-time sites like Hawaii . Introduce them to a semi-celebrity player . Close the deal . Kid , you can have all this and more . Standard pitch , straight as a fastball , but with a different tag-line . Never before at Cal State Northridge has a coach ' s exit line been a mumbled . . . &quot; I think . I hope . Well , maybe. &quot; At Northridge , this is what it ' s come_to for a handful of coaches who can ' t answer the simplest of follow-up questions from recruits : What ' s next for the Matador athletic program ? The NCAA ' s weeklong early signing period ended Wednesday and Northridge didn ' t exactly herniate the mailman . According to school officials , only one letter_of_intent is in_hand . The quandary started with last month ' s fee referendum , which was narrowly defeated by student vote . It would have generated millions for athletics and kept the school , which moved to Division I five years ago , in a state of ascent . At best , athletics is now in a state of flux . Budget_cuts loom and several programs are wondering if the other shoe is going_to drop . Obviously , recruits are concerned . &quot; There isn ' t anybody out there right now , male or female , that would sign ( in track ) until the school makes a decision on where we ' re going , &quot; said Don Strametz , the school ' s longtime track coach . The impact of the referendum ' s defeat is manifold , with aftershocks aplenty . Recruiting wasn ' t given much thought when the campaign was mounted , but it ' s definitely being addressed after the fact . In a nutshell , the athletics department gambled . In order to impress upon voters the possible impact of the referendum ' s defeat , a worst-case scenario was mapped_out with considerable hand-wringing . Defeat meant the possible loss of scholarships and programs , such_as track and football . If enough programs were lopped , the school was facing the unconscionable drop to Division II . Realistic threat or not -- school officials say they will avoid the latter at all cost -- it was mentioned as a possibility . Red flags attract attention . would n ' t you know it , recruits can read the papers , too . Some even heard the news through word_of_mouth , never known for its accuracy . Strametz didn ' t bother sending_out a single letter_of_intent and said things might be just as lean during the spring signing period , which begins in April . &quot; Right now , it ' s a disaster for everyone , &quot; he said . &quot; Even programs you would n ' t think would be affected are being hurt. &quot; Bingo . The softball team , as_good_as any Division I program around , lost a &quot; major recruit &quot; because of the budget problems , first-year Coach Janet Sherman said . &quot; There were rumors in some places that us going_to Division II was already a done deal , &quot; she said . Ever since the referendum failed four weeks ago , coaching track has been secondary to damage_control for Strametz . The track network , you see , is unlike any other . Track folks are die-hard aficionados . There are few casual fans . Alas , the grapevine is abuzz with bad Northridge news . Coaches from throughout the state did everything but send flowers to Strametz ' s funeral and ask if he ' d updated his resume . &quot; I ' ve had so many people call just to say , ' Sorry , try to make the best of it , ' &quot; Strametz said . &quot; I keep telling them we ' re not dead yet. &quot; Meanwhile , opposing coaches , fighting to land the same top recruits , keep using Northridge ' s predicament as leverage . With no answer regarding the school ' s direction expected until mid-December , the Matadors are losing ground . Men ' s volleyball Coach John Price doesn ' t think the referendum defeat had any effect on his recruiting plans . Then again , he can ' t be sure . This fall , Price made a serious run at one player and didn ' t land him . The day after the referendum was voted_down , the player phoned Price to ask what was going_on . &quot; With softball and men ' s volleyball , you have programs that are in the top four or five in the country right now , &quot; Price said . &quot; You have to take_advantage of that while you can . It doesn ' t always last forever . &quot; ( Uncertainty ) could kill our chances of staying there. &quot; Sherman should be recruiting from a quantifiable position of strength . No Northridge program had a better season in 1993-94 . The softball team was 52-10 and reached the championship game of the Women ' s College World_Series . Played_on television , even . Yet several recruits brought the first-year coach ' s recruiting pitch to a halt with the simple question : &quot; Where ' s your program gonna be in a_couple_of years , Division II ? &quot; Sherman , an assistant at Northridge for the past five years , lost a top recruit -- who signed with Cal State Fullerton -- because of the questions surrounding Northridge ' s future commitment to athletics . The coach put the best spin possible on the situation . &quot; All I can do at this point is assure them we plan to stay Division I and that I haven ' t been told anything differently , &quot; she said . Some recruits are buying . Some moved_on to the next sales pitch .</TEXT>
