   <HEADLINE> U.S. , ALLIES BACKTRACK ON USE OF FORCE AGAINST SERBS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and four European counterparts meted_out a diplomatic wrist slap Saturday to the Bosnian Serbs after the nationalist rebels had rejected a last-chance peace plan , killed a U.N. soldier , reimposed a blockade of Sarajevo and fired on aid flights . The foreign_ministers of the five-power Contact Group had billed their meeting here as a get-tough session aimed at punishing any Bosnian faction blocking the path to peace . But differences among the mediating nations over how to deal with the latest spate of Serbian aggression compelled them to retreat to a symbolic tightening of leaky economic sanctions against the rebels ' backers in Belgrade , leaving the deadliest crisis in Europe in half a century to be dealt with another day . The dramatic backtracking from threats to punish Serbian intransigence also risked diminishing the credibility of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , which had vowed to bomb Serbian gun_emplacements , munitions factories and supply_lines unless the rebels ceased attacks on U.N. troops and Bosnian civilians . What emerged from the gathering of five of the most militarily powerful nations in the world was a collective recognition that they are unwilling to resort_to armed force to persuade any Balkan belligerents to respect the principles and decisions of the community of nations . &quot; We ' ve made a decision not to seek to impose a solution , &quot; Christopher replied when asked if the great_powers deemed themselves incapable of forcing an end to the bloodshed . British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd emphatically insisted that the Contact Group , consisting_of the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany , is powerless to do more_than exert economic pressure . &quot; There is this assumption that the international community or the Contact Group has the power to impose solutions . I don ' t think the United States or anyone has that power , &quot; Hurd said at a press_conference after the ministerial meeting . Earlier this month , Christopher and the European statesmen threatened a military response if the Serbs spurned their plan for a partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina , which they unveiled in the first week of July and cast as a take-it-or-leave-it formula for restoring peace to Bosnia . The Muslim-led Bosnian government endorsed the proposal that would nominally retain an independent Bosnia while ceding half its territory to the control of Serbian separatists . The Serbs rejected the plan nearly two weeks ago and reiterated their opposition last week . The rebels , led by nationalist warlord Radovan Karadzic , had been warned that they might face NATO air_attacks if they rejected the plan . They were also warned of the possibility that the five nations might support lifting a U.N. arms embargo that has prevented the Sarajevo government from acquiring weapons to defend itself against the heavily armed Serbs . But in the face of Russian reluctance to take action against the Serbs and concern among the_French and British that their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia might be subjected_to Serbian reprisals , the foreign_ministers decided only to reaffirm their support for economic sanctions . The diplomats did agree to propose a resolution to the U.N. Security_Council , probably this week , aimed at closing a_few loopholes in the existing sanctions , such_as blocking financial remittances from offshore activities to the government of rump Yugoslavia . The Serb-dominated Yugoslav regime has armed and supplied the Bosnian Serbs throughout their 27-month-old campaign to conquer territory for a Greater Serbia . Belgrade also backed Serbian separatists in Croatia who seized one-third of that country in a 1991 rebellion . Despite more_than two years of severe economic sanctions levied against his country , Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has shown no sign of readiness to pinch off the supply_lines to his proxy warriors in Bosnia and Croatia . Christopher and the Europeans raised the prospect of future NATO air strikes to enforce weapons exclusion zones proclaimed around Sarajevo , the Bosnian capital , and the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde , both of which have been repeatedly violated over the past two months . The Serbs ' history of violation with impunity appeared to make_it unlikely they would take the latest vague threats any more seriously . Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev made clear his country ' s continued opposition to air strikes , warning that the Russian contingent of the U.N. peacekeeping force in the Balkans would be withdrawn if NATO nations decided to bomb Serbian weapons that are violating the exclusion zones . The ministers repeatedly sought to present their actions to tighten sanctions as firm resolve to bring the Serbian rebels into compliance . They portrayed their agreement on the symbolic measures as a great success , emphasizing the importance of unity among the five powers . Even U.S. officials who had pressed for a forceful response to provocative Serbian actions of the past week executed a diplomatic backpedaling to renounce the use of force to pressure the rebels . &quot; The nature of this process is to get a ' yes ' from the Serbs ( on the partition formula ) and to produce a negotiated settlement . It ' s not punishment for punishment ' s sake , &quot; said one senior U.S. official , insisting the mediators must &quot; keep the door open &quot; for a Serbian change of heart . Christopher said he was convinced by Kozyrev , who was en route to Belgrade after the Geneva meeting , that the Bosnian Serbs might eventually accept the peace plan . As an inducement to the holdouts , the foreign_ministers plan to couple their proposals for stricter economic sanctions against Serbia with assurances that the punitive measures will be suspended if the Bosnian Serbs comply with the peace plan . Although the European ministers suggested the relief would be immediate , Christopher said it would be a &quot; phased &quot; lifting of sanctions . U.S. officials fear that Karadzic ' s followers might agree to the peace formula to get sanctions removed from their patrons in Belgrade and then refuse to abide_by provisions requiring them to withdraw from areas they have cleared of Muslims and Croats .</TEXT>
