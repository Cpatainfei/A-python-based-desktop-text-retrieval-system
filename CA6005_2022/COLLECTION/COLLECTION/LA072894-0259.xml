   <HEADLINE> DEFECTOR CLAIMS NORTH_KOREA HAS 5 NUCLEAR BOMBS ; ASIA : U.S. DOUBTS REMARKS BY MAN IDENTIFIED AS PREMIER ' S SON-IN-LAW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A defector identified as the son-in-law of North_Korea ' s prime_minister declared Wednesday that Pyongyang has already built five nuclear bombs . At a news_conference in Seoul , Kang Myong Do said the security chief at the Yongbyon nuclear complex , 60 miles north of Pyongyang , told him that North_Korea intends to announce its development of nuclear_weapons after building five more . He added that assembly-line production of missiles to carry the warheads is expected in 1995 . Kang offered no documentation for his claims , and the U.S. State_Department cast doubt on their reliability . Nonetheless , his statement marked the first time that any defector from North_Korea has charged that the Stalinist nation has already constructed nuclear bombs . The remarks also came from one of the most elite North_Koreans ever to defect -- a member of the Kim family clan that dominates the ruling group . Kang , 35 , is married to the only daughter of North_Korean Prime_Minister Kang Song San . He defected in May and was subjected_to two months of detention and interrogation by South_Korea ' s Agency for National Security Planning . Wednesday ' s news_conference , which was tainted with obvious South_Korean propaganda , was staged by the intelligence agency . It was timed to coincide with the 41st anniversary of the armistice ending the 1950-53 Korean_War -- a day that North_Korea celebrates as &quot; Victory_Day &quot; commemorating the &quot; defeat &quot; of American &quot; aggressors. &quot; North_Korea early today angrily denounced South_Korea for putting a &quot; criminal &quot; defector on show in Seoul and flatly denied Kang is related to the North ' s prime_minister . The official Korean Central News_Agency accused the South of jeopardizing reconciliation of the two Koreas and of brainwashing Kang to report that the North has developed five nuclear bombs . In Pyongyang , both Prime_Minister Kang and Kim Jong Il , the country ' s new leader , failed to attend the Victory_Day celebration , a major Communist event . Their absence , combined with the younger Kang ' s declarations , raised new questions about what is happening in North_Korea , where President Kim Il Sung , 82 , died of a heart_attack July 8 . The Victory_Day commemoration was the second occasion since his father ' s death that Kim Jong Il , who has never been known to give a speech , failed to use a natural opportunity to deliver an address . A speech was read on his behalf . At his news_conference in Seoul , Kang said he was told that North_Korea has not yet admitted it has built the bombs because it fears &quot; the international community would impose sanctions upon us and we would not be able to build any more. &quot; He said the bombs are being built to provide defense against threats from the outside . Negotiations between the United States and North_Korea over the nuclear issue are scheduled to resume Aug . 5 . Defense Agency officials in Tokyo noted that neither the United States nor Japan believes North_Korea possesses enough plutonium to build five bombs . The CIA estimates that it has enough plutonium to have built only one or two . In Washington , State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Kang ' s statements &quot; are not consistent with information within our own intelligence community. &quot; Kang , vice_president of a trading company run_by the North_Korean president ' s office , is a distant relative of Kim Il Sung on his father ' s side . His father-in-law , the North_Korean prime_minister , is a cousin of the late dictator . To establish his identity , Kang provided South_Korean intelligence officials with family photos of himself with his wife -- whom he left_behind in the North -- and the prime_minister . He also had a passport and other official_documents . Reporters were shown a photograph of Kang and his wife flanking Prime_Minister Kang , 63 , who was most recently ranked No . 3 in the North_Korean hierarchy . Kang said he sought asylum when he suspected that his position with the trading firm had become threatened .</TEXT>
