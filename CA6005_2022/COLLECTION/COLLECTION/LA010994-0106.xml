   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : SECOND-GUESSING THE RATES THAT TOUR COMPANIES OFFER ; LODGING : IT PAYS TO CHECK IF YOUR OPERATOR IS REALLY GETTING YOU THE BEST HOTEL PRICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the whole , Dov B . Malkin of Los Angeles had a rewarding vacation in Peru in November . But he might have come_home happier still had he not started asking questions at the hotels arranged by his tour operator . At one lodging_in Lima , where Malkin and his fellow tour members were paying $ 78 nightly , Malkin found that similar rooms were available for $ 60 a night . At another hotel in the inland city of Cuzco , the travelers on Malkin ' s tour paid $ 47 nightly , while guests off the street were paying $ 24 . This understandably troubled Malkin , and he laid_out his case to me in a letter . His perplexity offers an important reminder for those who travel with tour groups : Tour operators can often negotiate attractive discounts with hotels because of their strength in numbers , and often mention such discounts in marketing their trips . But since tour operators seldom volunteer specific breakdowns of their package prices , travelers should pay close attention to itinerary details and package prices , or risk paying unnecessarily steep rates to inefficient or unscrupulous tour operators . James J . Murphy , chairman of the U.S. Tour Operators Assn. , estimates that large-scale tour operators pay 40 % -70 % of a hotel ' s undiscounted &quot; off-the-rack &quot; rates , passing some of that savings along to customers . Individual travelers can ' t count_on doing that well , but a smart lodger generally can find a price substantially below a hotel ' s &quot; rack &quot; rates , often by seeking_out weekend specials at business hotels or off-season or mid-week rates at lodgings that rely_on leisure travelers . Murphy notes that the rates tour operators negotiate vary widely depending_on the tour operator , the number of travelers he or she can deliver , the part of the world and the time_of_year . The tour operators who generally get_the_best rates , he says , are those who bring_in a steady stream of groups -- an arrival every week for two months , for instance -- and who can predict the size of those groups with some specificity . Operators who tend to reserve more rooms than they later fill may get less advantageous rates from hotels . Richard Launder , president of Garden Grove-based Contiki Holidays , notes that his negotiations with hotels often take_place a full year in_advance of the group ' s arrival , and in cities like Los Angeles and Las Vegas can involve as_many as 5 # 000 to 6 # 000 rooms yearly . In such circumstances , Launder says , a tour operator can get &quot; fantastic &quot; rates . Some tour operators have cut_out middlemen entirely by purchasing and operating their own lodgings -- in Contiki ' s case , a chateau in the Beaujolais region of France and a villa in Florence , Italy . Conversely , Launder acknowledges , in areas where demand for accommodations far surpasses supply , tour operators have less bargaining strength , and may offer a narrower margin of advantage over the walk-in rates available to individual travelers . The Grand_Canyon is one such place . Generally , it doesn ' t take too_much work for a traveler to satisfy himself , or herself , that a tour operator is charging sensible rates . Before you buy a tour package , ask a travel_agent how it stacks_up against comparable itineraries offered by other tour operators , or call other operators yourself . To get_into greater detail -- though this could mean a lot of phone_calls to hotels -- take the overall tour price ( excluding air fare ) and divide it by the number of the nights you ' ll spend in hotels . Then call the hotels to see what rate you would get as an independent traveler . Before you jump to any conclusions about the numbers before you , consider several factors : On a tour , you ' re usually paying also for the expertise of guides , ground transportation , and often meals and other services . Also , remember that most hotels in the United States , and many elsewhere , quote rates before taxes , which often boost the bill by 10 % -20 % . Keep_in mind , too , that unexpectedly weak business can lead a hotel_manager to drop prices to levels he or she would n ' t have offered six months or a year earlier , when the tour contract was signed . James Murphy ' s company , Van Nuys-based Brendan Tours , is offering a six-night London trip next year , with lodgings at the Stakis St . Ermin ' s Hotel between Victoria Station and Westminster Abbey . Using Brendan ' s package tour , a couple would pay about $ 95 per person , per night ( excluding air fare ) , and in the bargain receive free transportation to and from the airport , continental breakfasts , a two-day public transportation pass , a welcome drink , a half-day sightseeing tour , and a pair of theater_tickets valued at $ 50 each . The hotel ' s published &quot; rack &quot; rates , meanwhile , work_out to roughly $ 115 per person per night , double occupancy . A better price ( about $ 88 per person , per night ) is available if that couple reserves a St . Ermin ' s room via a toll-free call to Utell , the hotel ' s U.S. booking_agents -- but that rate includes no extras . Independent travelers often can get further discounts by calling overseas hotels directly . But tour operators may be able to arrange air fares at better prices , and tour groups offer freedom from logistical wrangling and the clout of an international_organization that can swing into action in a medical crisis or emergency .</TEXT>
