   <HEADLINE> ' I ' M STILL FIGHTING ' ; HE SUFFERED THE DEVASTATION OF A JAILHOUSE GANG RAPE . NOW , STEPHEN DONALDSON RESOLVES TO STOP A CRIME THAT OTHERS WOULD RATHER KEEP QUIET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He was only trying to protest the Vietnam_War and follow a creed of nonviolent resistance . But after he was gang-raped 50 times in the Washington , D.C. , jail , Stephen Donaldson started a war of_his_own . It all began on a hot August afternoon in 1973 , when he was arrested at a White_House pray-in . For reasons of conscience , the Quaker activist refused to post $ 10 bail and was placed in a cell with other first-time offenders . Then , without warning , he was sent to a wing with hardened criminals . Told that some inmates wanted to meet him , Donaldson went_to their cell . Within seconds , the men beat him savagely , tore_off his clothes and repeatedly assaulted him . He managed to escape two days later , and only after his attackers whispered that a guard was coming_down the hall . Like thousands before him , Donaldson was physically and emotionally traumatized by prison rape . It would take him years to recover . Unlike most victims , however , he was determined to speak out against a crime that has reached epidemic proportions in some U.S. prisons -- and is rarely discussed . &quot; I couldn ' t pretend it never happened , &quot; he says . &quot; Some prison officials figure people will keep quiet , and I ' m convinced the D.C. jail set me up , to teach me a political lesson . But they miscalculated with me . I was just beginning to fight_back , and I ' m still fighting. &quot; Today , Donaldson is president of Stop Prison Rape , the only national advocacy group focused solely on the problem . He debates the issue in public forums and helped draft a friend_of_the_court brief in Farmer vs . Brennan , a watershed prison rape case awaiting a Supreme Court decision . Next week , he ' s scheduled to testify in a hearing on prison rape before the Massachusetts Legislature , and he ' ll deliver a shocking estimate : Based on several decades of studies , Donaldson says , there are more_than a quarter-million sexual_assaults on inmates each year in American correctional facilities . Across the nation , a handful of prosecutors , attorneys , psychologists , religious_leaders and politicians are trying to root_out a cancer that is deeply ingrained in the criminal justice system , yet traditionally rouses little concern . Indeed , at a time when anger over crime is escalating , many find it hard to feel compassion for men who are abused behind bars . Arlen Specter , a Pennsylvania Republican and member of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee , says society pays a heavy price for such attitudes : &quot; We ignore this prison-rape problem at our peril , because there is a great potential for these victims to commit worse crimes when they get_out of jail . For anyone who cares about safety , it ' s a matter of common_sense as well as compassion. &quot; Specter speaks from experience ; he was district_attorney of Philadelphia in 1968 when a pioneering study was done of prison rape in that city ' s jail system . The conclusions were devastating : Nearly 1 # 000 men were raped each year in custody , and there were no programs to control the violence . Since then , studies in other states have found similar horrors , as well as evidence that many inmates are coerced into long-term sexual &quot; coupling &quot; with stronger prisoners simply to ward_off the possibility of repeated gang rapes . But there has been little national response . Meanwhile , AIDS is spreading rapidly in prisons and jails . In 1989 , there were 14.65 AIDS cases per 100 # 000 in the general population , but the rate for state and federal prisons was 202 cases per 100 # 000 , according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics . Only Vermont and Mississippi provide condoms to inmates who request them , as do jails in Philadelphia , San Francisco and New York City . Nationwide , there are an estimated 50 # 000 prisoners infected with HIV and the numbers are growing each year , says Nancy Mahon , director of the New York-based AIDS in Prison Project . There are few HIV counseling programs for those in custody . &quot; This is a powder_keg waiting to explode , &quot; she says . &quot; As we put more people in jail , you have to wonder about the medical consequences , and AIDS is one of them . If you put a kid in jail for petty theft and then he gets raped , there ' s a whole downward cycle for him . And HIV could be the final insult. &quot; It ' s a nightmare without end for victims , and every so often a gruesome prison rape story finds its way into the media . Then it ' s forgotten . Several days after his trauma , Donaldson held a news_conference in Washington and later appeared on talk_shows . He was the first American to personally describe such sexual terror , and he hoped reforms would follow . By year ' s end , however , his story had faded from view . &quot; The public indifference on this is staggering , &quot; Donaldson says . &quot; And it ' s harder for someone like me , because the trauma continues to haunt you . You can be tormented by this . So often , there ' s just nowhere to turn. &quot; * Once a newspaper journalist , Donaldson ' s life changed radically after 1973 . He now spends much of his time corresponding with inmates across the country and pestering public officials to focus_on the issue . It ' s a thankless task : Stop Prison Rape has little funding and only several hundred members nationwide . Donaldson , 47 , fights to keep it afloat . A complex and thoughtful man , he speaks bitterly about the past but never lapses into self-pity . His black jeans , long sideburns and fatigue jackets set him apart from the pin-striped world he once seemed destined to enter , and the harsh , unforgiving stories he tells distance him even more . Donaldson can be a jarring character at first glance . Visitors gape at his Stop Prison Rape baseball_cap and he raises eyebrows with a belt_buckle reading &quot; Punk. &quot; The word is more_than a referral to his taste in rock_music . It ' s also prison slang for the passive sexual role he was forced into behind bars . Yet shock value is only part of his persona . Once Donaldson starts talking_about rape , there ' s no doubting his gravitas . &quot; This guy knocked me off my feet , &quot; says Deborah Denno , a Fordham University law professor , who invited Donaldson to address her seminar on rape . &quot; He was very smart and there was a depth of human emotion and feeling to what he said . . . . His message is important. &quot; Born in Norfolk , Va. , to a military family , Donaldson ' s given name was Robert Martin . He was high_school valedictorian and attended Columbia University . Friends and family members recall him as a smart , outgoing person who seemed to have a golden future as a reporter , a lawyer or just about anything else he wanted to be . &quot; He had tremendous promise . He thought he might conquer the world , but after what happened I don ' t think he looks_at the world that way , &quot; says his stepmother , Brigitta Martin . &quot; It altered his life forever . He ' s not the same driven person I used to know. &quot; Donaldson describes himself as a survivor , but he ' s been wrestling with the demons of self-confidence and his own sexuality for nearly 21 years , largely as the result of his prison experience . Personal justice has also proved elusive : Angered that prosecutors declined to investigate corrections officers for what he says was their role in his rape , he refused to cooperate with a grand_jury and the D.C. jail case was dropped . In subsequent years , Donaldson ' s personal and professional_life spun_out of control . He was briefly homeless , struggled to establish a literary career and was arrested twice for drug possession . Although both charges were dropped , he was jailed in North Carolina and Virginia facilities and , he says , again raped . As a youth , Donaldson thought himself bisexual . But the D.C. assaults shattered his self-image . He changed his name , tried to lose himself in the world of punk_rock music and sought relief in Far Eastern spiritualism . The cracking point for the Navy veteran came_in 1980 , when he demanded treatment for a badly cut hand at the Veterans Hospital in the_Bronx and was told to come_back later . Enraged , he pulled a handgun and shot out the window in a hospital door . He served four years in federal prison , where Donaldson says he was yet again assaulted . Unlike most parolees , Donaldson got counseling after his release and learned to deal with rape trauma survivors syndrome . He ' s since been trained as a rape counselor and has produced a pioneering set of audio tapes to help prisoners cope_with the experience . A New York resident , he ' s working_on an encyclopedia of homosexuality and is a well-known punk_rock journalist . &quot; You might wonder , how did a pacifist like me , a Quaker , go from nonviolent resistance to being a gunman ? &quot; he asks . &quot; And the answer is very simple . What happened to me during and after the D.C. jail is an old story. &quot; And as American as apple_pie . Take a gullible kid , put him through the hell of prison rape , then set him loose on the streets . Watch the rage build , until he explodes in violence and returns to jail . The cycle is endless . * In the United States , it goes_back at least 170 years . In 1824 , the Rev . Louis Dwight , a New England prison reformer , toured many jails and lamented a barbaric culture where stronger , older prisoners repeatedly raped younger inmates , turning them into sexual slaves . &quot; Since October , 1824 , I have visited most of the prisons on two routes , between Massachusetts and Georgia , and ( in ) the New England States and New York , &quot; Dwight wrote . &quot; And I have found melancholy testimony to establish one general fact . . . that boys are prostituted to the lust of old convicts . Nature and humanity cry aloud for redemption from this dreadful degradation. &quot; It ' s gotten_worse . Although there are no statistics documenting the prevalence , scores of court cases brought by victims and a handful of studies suggest that sexual attacks behind bars are widespread . Yet they are rarely reported because of a code of silence that threatens informers with death . Meanwhile , corrections officials are reluctant to probe such behavior because it suggests that they ' ve lost_control of their institutions . As a result , the overwhelming number of cases rarely make_it to court . One typical administrative response is to place victims in protective custody , away from other convicts . But the solitude drives many men mad , and there have been documented cases of victims raped in seclusion . For the most part , thousands of vulnerable prisoners continue to be placed in cells or large holding areas with seasoned sexual offenders . In the 1968 Philadelphia study , only 3 % of the estimated 1 # 000 yearly attacks were reported to officials . In 1982 , researchers at a California prison found that 14 % of inmates had been assaulted . Yet the real_number was thought to be higher , because many men were reluctant to admit being raped . A New York study found that 28 % of prisoners had been sexually attacked . The only current study of jailhouse rape is being conducted in the Nebraska prison system by Cindy Struckman-Johnson , a professor at the University of South_Dakota . Her preliminary data , based on confidential questionnaires , confirms the 14 % sexual_assault rate found in California . &quot; Some of the answers we get are truly heartbreaking , &quot; Johnson reports . &quot; Young prisoners say they either fight_off a guy , or they ' re destroyed. &quot; In Philadelphia , one witness described a young_man ' s gang rape : &quot; They had the kid on the floor . About 12 fellows took turns with him . This went_on for two hours . . . . He lay there for about 20 minutes and ( one ) came_over and pulled his pants down and raped him again . When he got done , ( another ) did_it again , and about four or five others got_on him. &quot; * Why does_it happen ? Many criminologists believe prison rape mirrors crime in the outside world . It ' s a symbol of power for the attacker , a vehicle for aggression . Inmates battle for dominance in the racially tense , overcrowded worlds of most jails and prisons , and , for many , rape is synonymous with strength . &quot; There aren ' t many weapons in a prison , and so the penis becomes a weapon of control , &quot; says Wayne Wooden , coordinator of the Criminal Justice and Corrections program at California State Polytechnic University , Pomona . &quot; It ' s how prisoners assert themselves and show others that they ' re unassailable. &quot; Wooden , who co-authored the 1982 study of sexual abuse in a California prison , adds that many men are targeted for attack the minute they enter confinement . Typical victims are young , slightly built males without knowledge of prison culture or street-fighting techniques . Although homosexuals are obvious targets , most victims are heterosexual . Once behind bars , predators compete to see who will be the first to attack them -- or &quot; turn them out , &quot; in prison parlance . After a man is assaulted , word spreads rapidly through the institution and he ' s identified as a punk . His body belongs_to someone else as long as he is in custody . &quot; Few female rape victims must repay their rapist for the violence he inflicted upon them by devoting their existence to servicing his every need , &quot; write Louisiana prison inmates Wilbert Rideau and Ron Wikberg in their book , &quot; Life Sentences. &quot; &quot; But rape victims in the world of prison must. &quot; The immediate consequences of jailhouse rape are devastating . Many victims are pressured into believing they have been turned_into women , that their masculinity is gone . They frequently go_into shock and some attempt suicide . &quot; Your biggest problem is that few prisoners who are raped get prompt psychological counseling , &quot; says Maud Easter , who chairs the New York State Coalition Against Sexual Assault . &quot; Someone who has experienced this needs counseling immediately . They ' re in pain , and they ' ve got nowhere to turn. &quot; * that ' s how Donaldson felt after his gang rape : stunned , bloodied and utterly alone . He relives these memories in the wrenching letters sent to him by prisoners across the nation . Many of these inmates committed serious crimes , while others protest their innocence . None expected that sexual trauma would be part of their punishment . Writes &quot; Michael , &quot; from an Arizona prison : In October , 1974 , I was 18 years old , youthfully dumb and full of fun . Charged with four counts of petty forgery , I landed in the Pima Co . jail in Tucson , Arizona . I was brutally beaten , savagely and repeatedly raped . For LeShawn Cummings , at the state_prison in Tehachapi , Calif. , the trauma is heightened by the belief that authorities don ' t believe him : Between 10-18-93 and 11-3-93 , I was sodomized and forced to commit oral copulation against my will in my cell . My cellmate would threaten to beat me up if I did not have_sex with him . I told the correctional officers but they did not believe me and sent me back to the cell to endure more pain . Another Arizona convict writes that , at 23 , he was gang-raped . After a hospital stay , officials put him in protective custody : It ' s been 18 months now . I don ' t talk to no prisoners at all to this day . I don ' t have no money . Nothing . No TV or stereo . I sit in my cell and cry a lot . I ' ve cut my wrists three times . The state didn ' t do anything . * that ' s a common complaint . Yet many correctional officials say the problem is either overblown or impossible to document . They suggest that U.S. jails and prisons do a much better job_controlling rape than is generally believed . Hardy Rauch , an officer with the American Corrections Assn. , argues that sexual_assaults are more prevalent in society than in prisons . It would be impossible to guarantee complete security , he says , because that would mean hiring a guard for each of the nation ' s 1.2 million inmates . The ACA , an accrediting organization that includes prisons and jails in all 50 states , is aware of the issue , Rauch says , but adds : &quot; It ' s not considered to be a nationwide problem . And I ' d ask you : Is a warden more culpable when someone is attacked in prison than the mayor of Los Angeles is if a policeman isn ' t watching your house when it ' s robbed ? &quot; Other officials say rape isn ' t a problem in their institutions . At Rikers Island in New York , the nation ' s largest municipal jail complex , spokesman Tom Antenen says sexual_assaults are few . At the Federal Bureau of Prisons , which houses 84 # 000 prisoners in 75 facilities , spokesman Dan Dunne suggests that rape is &quot; relatively low. &quot; Neither offers statistics . The California Department of Corrections does not keep specific records of sexual_assaults in its 28 prisons . Records were logged from 1970 to 1988 , however , and they ranged from a low of four in 1973 to a high of 64 in 1987 . Currently , there are 121 # 800 inmates in the system , the nation ' s largest . In Los Angeles , the sprawling county jail system reported 52 sexual_assaults last year , says Jake Katz , custody management specialist with the Sheriff ' s Department . The system holds a daily average of 21 # 000 inmates . On rare occasions , prosecutors file charges against prison rapists . But even when victims win , the victory is a Pyrrhic one . Michael Wheat , an assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego , believes that he is the first federal prosecutor to successfully bring charges against one prisoner accused of raping another . In the 1993 case , inmate Gary Gonzaga told a U.S. District Court that he had been attacked by Frederick Garcia-Cruz while both were in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center . The defendant eventually pleaded guilty to aggravated assault , adding five years to his sentence . &quot; I was pleased with the outcome , but it ' s only a drop_in the bucket , &quot; says Wheat , who had to persuade Gonzaga to participate in the case . &quot; You ' re dealing with inmates , and juries aren ' t likely to find either side sympathetic . &quot; When a play is set_in hell , you can ' t cast it with angels. &quot; * Most inmates never get as far as a courtroom , and protection comes at a price . Donaldson , like thousands of other prisoners , took_on the role of a punk and serviced stronger men to avoid further gang rapes . While corrections officials usually forbid any sexual_activity , many passively permit such relationships because they promote stability in their institutions . Looking_back , Donaldson says life as a punk deepened his self-awareness . He believes that he ' s become more sensitive to the brutalization of women , and suggests that some prison relationships made him feel wanted and loved . The war still rages in his head . It erupts when he addresses a recent lunch seminar at New York University Law_School . Bearing an armful of Stop Prison Rape literature , he sits quietly at the head of a table and watches while students munch cookies . Then Donaldson grabs their attention . He plays the beginning of a cassette he produced , &quot; An Ounce of Prevention , &quot; which dramatizes a prison rape : 40 seconds of terror , pleading , muffled screams and sobs . The audience looks shaken . &quot; If all_of you were male , that could be you as a victim , &quot; he tells the crowd , his eyes sweeping the room . &quot; You ' d be meat on the table. &quot; For the next hour , there ' s silence as Donaldson tells his story and criticizes many groups -- feminists , gays , victims ' rights organizers , politicians , judges , attorneys and the general public -- for what he calls a cruel indifference to the trauma of men in U.S. prisons and jails . There ' s applause , but then a hostile questioner shatters the mood . &quot; Isn ' t fear of rape a good deterrent to crime ? &quot; the student asks . &quot; And aren ' t prisons supposed to be terrible places ? When you talk_about using taxpayers ' money for these programs . . . I couldn ' t justify that. &quot; Donaldson fixes the questioner with a hard , penetrating stare . &quot; Have you been in prison ? &quot; he asks . &quot; Do you know anyone in prison ? &quot; The student shakes his head . &quot; Then how can you say such a thing ? &quot; Donaldson demands with a look of pain and incredulity . &quot; How could you possibly understand ? &quot;</TEXT>
