   <HEADLINE> N . IRELAND WATCH ; HOPE IN A WEARY LAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Combined Loyalist Military Command , an umbrella body for several Protestant terrorist groups in Northern_Ireland , Thursday declared a cease-fire that will be , it promises , as permanent as the cease-fire declared in August by its Catholic nationalist counterpart , the_Irish Republican Army . This was the second shoe that weary Northern Irish had been waiting to hear fall.Both sides want to believe that , at last , a generation of bloodshed is at an end . The loyalist declaration was greeted with open enthusiasm by Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds . British Prime_Minister John Major reacted with more guarded hopefulness . Britain promised a year ago that Sinn Fein , the IRA ' s political partner , would be welcome at multilateral negotiations after three months of unbroken peace . Major , himself once the target of an IRA assassination attempt , is under mounting pressure for an earlier start . Whatever his personal feelings , the news , which reached him at a Tory Party conference , is something of a political windfall , and he may capitalize on it . Loyalist terrorism has taken more lives in recent years than nationalist terrorism , and the Protestants ' targets are typically civilians identified as enemies by their Roman_Catholic affiliation alone . The fear exists that leaders of the Combined Loyalist Military Command may be less firmly in control than Gerry Adams of the IRA ' s Sinn Fein . But their hand , like Adams ' , is strengthened by a popular feeling that even the hardest of the &quot; hard men &quot; may be forced to acknowledge : It ' s about time .</TEXT>
