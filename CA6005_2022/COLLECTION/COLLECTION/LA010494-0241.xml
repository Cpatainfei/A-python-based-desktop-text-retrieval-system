   <HEADLINE> ROCKETDYNE ' S SKIES MAY GET CROWDED ; AEROSPACE : ROCKWELL UNIT MAY FACE COMPETITION AS AEROJET AGREES TO MARKET HIGH-PERFORMANCE RUSSIAN ROCKET_ENGINES FOR SATELLITE LAUNCHES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At a time when Rocketdyne is stinging from cutbacks in NASA ' s budget , a rival aerospace firm has set_up a joint_venture with a Russian company that could threaten Rocketdyne ' s lucrative business making rocket_engines for commercial and military satellite launches . The potential challenge comes from Aerojet of Sacramento , which last month said it had signed a pact with Samara State Scientific and Production Enterprise to refurbish and market 102 rocket_engines that were produced by the former Soviet government . Those engines , called NK-33 , were initially designed in the late 1950s for the Soviet N1 Moon rocket project . Most of them are fully built and are now stored in a warehouse in Russia . Aerojet hopes to market them as a lower-cost military and commercial satellite launch vehicle for the U.S. Atlas and Delta rockets , which have long been powered largely by Rocketdyne ' s first-stage engines . Rocketdyne ' s Atlas and Delta motors , sometimes called booster engines , are what initially propel the satellite rockets into space . Like Rocketdyne ' s engines , the NK-33 is propelled by liquid_oxygen and kerosene . But the Russian engine runs at higher_pressures and temperatures , making_it more efficient and powerful than comparable U.S. engines , including Rocketdyne ' s . But the NK-33 has yet to be test fired in the United States , and Aerojet still needs to line_up funding from NASA or other sources to help it get the NK-33 ready to meet U.S. standards . Jack Lee , director of NASA ' s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala. , got a good look_at the NK-33 at a recent display of the engine . Based on what he saw , Lee said the NK-33 could be a cheaper alternative because the engines have already been built and need only to be modified , presumably at a fraction of the cost of building an engine from scratch . &quot; I would say there probably would be some concern at Rocketdyne , &quot; Lee said . Price is a big factor , experts say , because NASA and others have been studying ways to lower the cost of commercial and military satellite launches , which are more expensive in the United States than Europe or Asia . At stake are contracts worth tens of millions of dollars a year . Rocketdyne , the Canoga Park unit of Seal Beach-based Rockwell International , currently gets $ 5 million for each Delta engine it builds , and almost $ 10 million for an Atlas engine . Last year there were seven Delta and five Atlas launches . Rocketdyne ' s work_on the Delta and Atlas engines probably accounts_for 10 % of its overall business , which approaches $ 1 billion a year . At present Rocketdyne faces no competition for those types of engines . Bill Sprow , Aerojet ' s program manager for the NK-33 , said the Russian engines are technically superior to Rocketdyne ' s because the NK-33 uses a so-called closed cycle that pumps all_the fuel into the main engine chamber , rather than jettisoning some to prevent overheating , as Rocketdyne ' s engines do . Sprow hopes to get the NK-33 engines to market by late 1995 . Aerojet , a subsidiary of Ohio-based GenCorp , currently makes the first- and second-stage rocket_engines that power the Titan satellite rockets , which are launched by Martin Marietta . Aerojet also builds the second-stage engine for the Delta rocket . But Peter McCourt , Rocketdyne ' s vice_president of business development , questioned whether the NK-33 could make_it to the U.S. market . &quot; So far as we know , the NK-33 has never flown successfully , &quot; he said . &quot; They had four launches of the N1 Moon rocket , and all four were failures . There ' s absolutely zero flight-reliability data. &quot; Aerojet confirmed that the four NK-1 rocket launches did fail . But Aerojet said that was not_due to a flaw in the first-stage NK-33 engine , which Aerojet claimed performed successfully , but was_due to a flaw in another engine . By contrast , McCourt said , Rocketdyne-powered Atlas and Delta rockets have flown for 20 years with near-flawless performance . But last March a Rocketdyne Atlas rocket malfunctioned due_to a loose screw inside the engine , resulting in a $ 137-million satellite failing to reach its correct orbit . Sprow conceded that the NK-33 was far from ready for delivery . Besides test-firings , he said changes must be made in Russian instrumentation as well as mechanical and electrical connections . Sprow added that the joint_venture hoped to get a commitment from a potential buyer before investing heavily in the NK-33 . McDonnell Douglas Aerospace in Huntington Beach , which launches the Delta rockets , said it has been briefed on the NK-33 . But spokeswoman Anne McCauley said only , &quot; We are following Aerojet ' s activities with the Russians. &quot; General Dynamics Space Systems Division in San Diego , which last month announced it was being sold to Martin Marietta for $ 208.5 million , is the general contractor of the Atlas launch vehicle . Officials at General Dynamics would not comment on the Russian engine . * Rocketdyne ' s current contract with General Dynamics calls_for delivery of 62 Atlas engines for a total of $ 600 million . In February , Rocketdyne signed a six-year $ 200-million deal with McDonnell Douglas to build 40 Delta engines . Rocketdyne cannot afford to lose those two contracts , because two-thirds of its revenue comes from NASA for work_on the space shuttle ' s main engine and the electrical_power system for the proposed space_station -- both of which are facing budget_cuts . Last fall Congress sharply curtailed the space_station budget , and future funding for U.S. contractors is uncertain because that program is expected to be undertaken jointly with the Russians . And NASA has said it wants to lower its cost for space shuttle launches . To prepare_for leaner times , Rocketdyne said in November that it would trim up_to 990 workers , or 15 % of its 6 # 600 employees . Currently , between 500 and 700 Rocketdyne employees work_on the Atlas and Delta engines . Like Rocketdyne , Aerojet has had its share of troubles because of NASA ' s belt-tightening . Aerojet now produces the orbital propulsion_system on the space shuttle , and it had been working for three years on developing an advanced solid rocket motor for the space shuttle . But NASA scrapped that program last fall , resulting in layoffs of about 500 Aerojet workers . Still , some of the NK-33 ' s specifications are unmatched by comparable U.S. engines , said Walter Williams , a retired NASA chief engineer and now an aerospace consultant in Tarzana . The NK-33 , for example , has greater thrust , or the force by which a rocket is driven , than Rocketdyne ' s engines . And as a result , experts say , the NK-33 can carry heavier payloads . But Williams said performance was just one issue . &quot; What will it cost to get the NK-33 ready for use for U.S. launch vehicles ? &quot; he asked . &quot; What is its safety record ? What will the Russians want for the engines ? &quot;</TEXT>
