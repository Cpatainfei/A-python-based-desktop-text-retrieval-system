   <HEADLINE> FARRAKHAN SUSPENDS AIDE OVER BIGOTED REMARKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chastened by expressions of disapproval from the Congressional Black Caucus and the U.S. Senate , Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan suspended a top aide Thursday for making what he called &quot; repugnant &quot; and &quot; mean-spirited &quot; remarks about Jews . But the controversial black leader modified his rebuke of Khalid Abdul Muhammad by insisting : &quot; I stand_by the truths that he spoke. &quot; He then accused the Jewish Anti-Defamation League of B ' nai B ' rith and Vice_President Al Gore -- both of whom had criticized Muhammad ' s remarks -- of being anti-black . Farrakhan ' s announcement at a press_conference came a day after the Senate condemned the remarks in a unanimous resolution and the caucus publicly backed_away from a &quot; sacred covenant &quot; of cooperation that it only recently had entered with the Nation of Islam . Farrakhan ' s move climaxed weeks of controversy that began on Nov . 29 during a speech at Kean College of New Jersey , when Muhammad referred to Jews as &quot; bloodsuckers of the black nation. &quot; He said that they control government , the news media and other black activists . He also heaped insults on other persons and groups , including Pope John Paul II , whom he called &quot; a cracker , &quot; and homosexuals . The Anti-Defamation League called attention to the comments and condemned Farrakhan in a full-page newspaper_ad . Farrakhan explained his action against Muhammad by saying : &quot; In that instance , he was not representing us . He was representing himself . I found the speech . . . repugnant , malicious , mean-spirited and spoken in mockery of individuals and people , which is against the spirit of Islam. &quot; He added : &quot; While I stand_by the truths that he spoke , I must condemn in the strongest terms the manner in which those truths were represented. &quot; The black Muslim activist said that he had relieved Muhammad of his duties &quot; until he demonstrates that he is willing to conform_to the manner of representing Allah and the honorable Elijah Muhammad ( founder of the Nation of Islam ) . &quot; Farrakhan said that he remains convinced , however , that the Anti-Defamation League is prejudiced against blacks and is trying to destroy him and his Nation of Islam by publicizing the speech . He called the Jewish organization &quot; self-centered , bigoted and malicious , &quot; adding that Gore is conspiring with it against black people as part of &quot; racism at the highest levels of government. &quot; Gore had criticized Muhammad ' s remarks as &quot; the vilest kind of racism , &quot; telling the United Jewish Appeal that &quot; America is a tolerant country but we should not tolerate hatred and racism. &quot; Abraham Foxman , head of the Anti-Defamation League , Thursday rejected any characterization of his group as anti-black . He said that Farrakhan ' s comments about the organization are an example of &quot; double-think and hate. &quot; Earlier this week , Rep . Kweisi Mfume ( D-Md. ) , chairman of the black caucus , labeled Muhammad ' s remarks &quot; evil and vicious &quot; and said &quot; nowhere in American life can we give sanctuary to such garbage. &quot; BACKGROUND The Nation of Islam is a splinter_group based in New York that grew out of the 1960s movement given prominence by the late Malcolm X . It traces its roots to the black pride and black nationalism that swept Africa after World_War_II .</TEXT>
