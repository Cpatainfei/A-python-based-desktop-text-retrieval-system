   <HEADLINE> KOHL ' S POPULARITY UP , BUT COALITION VICTORY IN VOTE FAR FROM ASSURED ; GERMANY : CHANCELLOR SELLS CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS AS SECURE CHOICE . ECONOMY HAS IMPROVED . BUT SISTER PARTIES MAY FALL_SHORT IN OCT . 16 ELECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First , his wide forehead appears through the crowd ; then his familiar jowls ; suddenly , a smiling Chancellor Helmut Kohl bursts 6-foot-4 into the October night , extending a beefy hand to well-wishers . On friendly turf in this town of conservative entrepreneurs , the chancellor crisscrosses the plaza before storming up_to the podium on one of his final campaign swings before the Oct . 16 federal election . &quot; Secure Into the Future , &quot; says an election poster behind him . Other posters bear no words at all , satisfied just to picture the beaming chancellor amid a throng of supporters : Kohl himself is the picture of security . Or is he ? Chancellor for the last 12 years and seeking a fourth term , Kohl sells himself as the veteran statesman , the leader who helped reunify Germany and build the European Union . He asserts in a folksy baritone that he is the one who has steered Germany through its worst recession since World_War_II , the leader of a country at_peace with its neighbors , the candidate of stability . But his most urgent message on this Thursday night -- and at a rare press_conference Friday -- is just a nitty-gritty appeal for votes : His ruling coalition might not have enough . &quot; We have no vote to give_away . We need every vote to continue the politics of good_sense , the politics of a coalition , &quot; he said . In fact , the 64-year-old Kohl has risen dramatically in popularity since the beginning of the year , when polls and pundits were forecasting his political finish over an ailing economy . Back then , they said the country was hungry for a change . The economy has turned_around in the last six months -- on Friday , Kohl told reporters to expect 2.5 % growth this year -- and today there is no doubt that his Christian Democratic Party will again garner the most votes among a handful of parties , thanks largely to Kohl . But the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party , the Christian Social Union , apparently do not have enough votes to govern alone , and their junior coalition partner , the liberal Free Democratic Party , or FDP , could lose out altogether . The FDP has failed to win legislative seats in the last six state elections . Now , several polls show that the FDP may_not register the 5 % of the federal vote needed to win seats in Parliament , which then elects the chancellor . This week ' s cover of the weekly magazine Der Spiegel carries a torn photograph with half of Kohl ' s face and half of his challenger ' s , Social Democratic Party leader Rudolf Scharping . &quot; FDP slides_down : Kohl ' s majority crumbles . A Change of Power After All ? &quot; asks the headline . Various polls give Kohl a slight lead over Scharping , and the magazine predicts a tight race on election_day . So Kohl , the come-back chancellor , is pulling_out the stops . He tells his crowds the choice is clear between his center-right Christian Democrat-FDP government or a leftist Social Democrat-Greens government that would have support from the reformed Communists of the former East_Germany , the Party of Democratic Socialism . He then proceeds to demonize the other side . In rally after rally , the old Cold Warrior launches into a tirade against the Social Democrats for having formed a government in the state of Saxony-Anhalt this summer with the tacit support of the former Communists . He takes credit for ridding Germany of Russian troops . &quot; The experiences of the fall of the Weimar Republic have taught us the lesson that there shall never be common_ground with Nazis , neo-Nazis , Fascists and Communists of any kind , &quot; Kohl said to his Limburg crowd . &quot; We have paid dearly in Germany , first with the Brown dictatorship and then after the division , with the Red dictatorship . . . . We have had enough of Communists in Germany , &quot; he said . On Friday , he warned that the country ' s economy was at stake : A Social Democrat-led coalition would scare_off international investors and ruin the country ' s reputation as a reliable ally . Social Democratic leader Scharping has denied that he plans to form a government with the former Communists . He also stopped his own free-fall in the polls recently with a late but impressive show of unity with more charismatic rivals in his own party . Dubbed the &quot; troika &quot; by the European press , Scharping and his colleagues Oskar Lafontaine , the premier of Saarland state , and Gerhard Schroeder , premier of Lower_Saxony , finally stopped bickering and began appearing together at campaign rallies to take_on Kohl . &quot; Strong , &quot; says the party ' s new campaign posters showing the troika shoulder-to-shoulder . But Scharping has an image problem among voters who find his toothy smile forced . In an election of personalities , he is seen as stiff compared to the down-home Kohl . Some Germans believe that the bright career politician and premier of Rhineland-Palatinate talks_down to them . &quot; His face is too perfect , &quot; said Torsten Roeder , 18 , a student and undecided voter at the Kohl rally . Kohl , he said , seems to be &quot; a capable man. &quot; The best thing Kohl seems to have going_for him , however , is something he really didn ' t do at all : the end of the recession . At the end of an economic cycle , unemployment had dropped to 3.5 million in September from a postwar high of 4.04 million in February . Werner Fruehwirth , 45 , who works in an optical factory , said he would be voting for Kohl because &quot; I feel good . I have a job and can make quite a good living . And I think Kohl has done a good job with the unification. &quot; What about the cost of unification -- about $ 300 billion to the West so far ? &quot; It would have cost just as much with the other guys , &quot; he said . But Kohl isn ' t taking any chances . He goes_after the uncommitted with a litany of his good deeds and prods his own supporters to the polls . &quot; Don ' t let anybody tell you that this election has already been decided , &quot; he said . &quot; Nothing has been decided yet. &quot;</TEXT>
