   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : GLENDALE ; DISTRICT AGREES TO REVIEW CANCELED PLAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Glendale school district officials have agreed to formally review a canceled AIDS awareness play if parents at Hoover High_School still want it performed during class time . &quot; We would give it a second look if in fact the Parent-Teacher-Student Assn . wishes the district to do so , &quot; said Vic Pallos , spokesman for the Glendale Unified School District . The district canceled the play just one day before the scheduled Feb . 8 performance . Pallos said the review process involves an evaluation only and does not guarantee that district staff will permit the showing of &quot; Secrets , &quot; a play produced by the Oakland-based Kaiser Permanente hospital_care organization . If the district refuses to allow the play to be performed during school hours , Hoover officials still have the option of asking the district for permission to show it after school . Given those two options , PTSA members said they are willing to take their chances with a formal review process . &quot; I ' m not satisfied with it , but I ' m willing to try to work within the system , &quot; Carolyn Crane , AIDS awareness chairwoman for the PTSA , said Thursday . &quot; I would like them to have a second look_at it . I am hoping they will say that ' Secrets ' can go_on &quot; during school . District officials said the play , about a boy who is HIV-positive , was canceled because it conflicts with district policy . &quot; Secrets &quot; promotes the use of condoms for safe_sex , but the district wants abstinence to be taught as the only way to avoid acquired immune deficiency syndrome . Donald W . Empey , deputy superintendent of educational services , said his staff has been working_on proposed guidelines for evaluating such sex education-related programs as &quot; Secrets. &quot; No formal review procedure had existed in the district before . &quot; We ' re moving along to get_it done as quickly as possible , &quot; Empey said . &quot; Once staff has developed these guidelines , it will be submitted to the board for approval. &quot; The new process would also require campuses to report any outside sex-education-related programs or speakers to district officials , he said . Three years ago , &quot; Secrets &quot; was shown at Daily High Continuation School -- next to district offices , said Principal Ted Tiffany . Pallos said the district was not aware that the play was presented at the time . Hoover PTSA President Susan Kussman doubts that a review process would resolve the controversy surrounding &quot; Secrets. &quot; &quot; They ' ll probably put some process together that not even God can comply with , &quot; Kussman said .
