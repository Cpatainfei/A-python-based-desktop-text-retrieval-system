   <TEXT> Portrait maker Mariana Cook began focusing_on fathers and daughters in 1990 as a means of exploring what she calls the &quot; mysterious bond &quot; between genders and generations . Four years later , that exploration has produced a book of 60 portraits of the famous and the unknown , captioned in some cases by the subjects and so revealing that writer William Styron , the father of three daughters and a subject of Cook , calls them &quot; a substantial miracle of photography. &quot; In his introduction to the pictures , Styron writes : &quot; That all_of these images and arrangements are not entirely harmonious , nor without emotional tension , adds_to their appeal , and to their honesty . What matters is the poetic grace with which the artist has arrested for a moment the humor , the tenderness and , most often , the love that underlie one of the best of all human connections. &quot; * Who are these little people who sit on my lap ? Strange creatures that we have made , who live_in the world that Dominique and I have cobbled_together and in a world that they are making_up for themselves . . . . It seems at one_and_the_same time that we have never lived without these two and that it was just yesterday that , childless , I prepared myself for fatherhood by thinking_about Dada . Something I would soon experience and be helpless to prevent : total chaos . . . . Chaos is turning_into harmonic anarchy as we all bumble along into the future , bouncing off each other , weathering our teacup tempests and days of bliss alike . -- THOMAS PALMER * A lot of people assume it is wonderful to have a famous justice for a father . &quot; Wow , it must be so exciting. &quot; &quot; Oh , you must be so proud. &quot; It is exciting , and I am proud , but there are costs . . . . About two years after I was married , and after Dad wrote Roe v . Wade , he was scheduled to come_to Boston to give the keynote_address for the annual meeting of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology . He had never seen my house . I was in the early months of my first pregnancy , working full time , feeling exhausted and seasick . It was spring , and the buildup of pressure at the court to finish the year ' s cases had begun , but I might have been able to invite him and Mother to drive the hour and a half roundtrip to where I lived if Mother hadn ' t said , &quot; Don ' t ask anything of him , Nancy . He ' s terribly tired. &quot; So I made the trip to Boston three times in 24 hours , taking most of a day_off from work to be able to hear him speak . When my baby was born , he didn ' t come_to see me . I took the baby to Washington to see him . At such times it has been hard to sort_out what is important . On this occasion it was a question of obstetrics in the abstract or in the concrete . Do I take_care of the author of Roe v . Wade , and by extension all those women who don ' t want to be pregnant and the obstetricians and gynecologists who provide their medical_care , or does he take_care of the woman who is his pregnant daughter and the baby who is his grandchild ? This kind of thing has been confusing . What am I supposed to do with my anger , despair and frustration ? And yet , his are the most comforting hands to hold : square and warm and responsive . I like it that my own hands , not especially beautiful for a woman ' s , look_like his . At the onset of adolescence in eighth grade , a difficult year for most new teen-agers , he smoothed my path by reading me Sherlock_Holmes and helping me prepare_for , of all things , home_economics quizzes . We got an A , of course . We talk on the phone a lot , in a way that is_best captured by the nearly untranslatable German word gemutlich . Gemutlich zusammen -- warm and comfortable together . He has called more as he has gotten older , little conversations scattered through the week . I have learned how to make him laugh , and then he will end the call by saying , &quot; Oh , I feel so_much better now , &quot; and indeed , I can hear it in his voice . I hate letting_go_of him to hang_up , dreading that point in the future where there will be no more calls . -- NANCY BLACKMUN CONIARIS * Her questions are coming from the end of the ages . Her silences are the slow heritage of uncertain millenniums . Her words are whispered as if she knew for a very short time all that -- too soon -- life will make her forget . Her answers , coming from the distant future , help me to understand what I desperately try to grasp from a flying past . -- JACQUES ATTALI * Natasha was a bouncy , cheerful child full of fun and imagination . A father ' s great illusion is that his daughter will always remain so ; a source of infinite tenderness and unexpected surprises . The surprises do follow , but they are not always tender or funny . A person cannot enter and leave your living room forever doing cartwheels . First Communion is not an eternal event . Photographs fade , gauze gets torn , silk yellows . I always laugh remembering that Natasha gave me a first intimation of mortality . She was four and skipped with another child through my study , where I was watching television . &quot; Melanie , &quot; she said , &quot; this is my father . He is a_hundred years old. &quot; In this photograph we are both aging , in different ways , at different paces . I am both far and near to her in this photo ; so is she from herself . She is seen at a final , painful moment of adolescence , no longer confident , no longer at_ease with herself or with me . She called it her &quot; young grim winter , &quot; finding ways to invent and reinvent herself over and over again , to please , to shock . Loud and silly sometimes , smooth and cool at others , surprising her teachers , correcting them , having read through the complete works of Artaud at age 14 , about to become the child in the New Yorker cartoon whose teacher , gun in_hand , starkly states : &quot; You know too much. &quot; In this photo , she is about to go from being in the open or being in seclusion , to being with others . . . . She does not cling_to me , I cling_to her . -- CARLOS FUENTES * Cora has always seemed to be completely in command of herself . This comes_across in numerous small ways : her resolute choice of clothing each morning , her systematic preference for the company of other girls . I admire , perhaps even envy , the way she has cultivated an unusual degree of autonomy as well as the amazing equilibrium that goes_along with it . I think these qualities are unusual in someone her age . They make her rare moments of dependency on me all_the more precious . -- PAUL GILROY</TEXT>
