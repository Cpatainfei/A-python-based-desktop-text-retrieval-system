   <HEADLINE> VAST SCOPE MAY UNDERMINE HEALTH CARE INITIATIVE ; PROP . 186 : PLAN WOULD TAKE INSURANCE_FIRMS OUT OF SYSTEM . COMPLEXITY MAKES IT A TOUGH SELL FOR BACKERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Behind in public_opinion_polls and endowed by its authors with breathtaking complexity , the all-embracing single-payer health_care initiative on the Nov . 8 ballot appears in danger of being buried by its own colossal ambitions . Proposition 186 raises so many issues -- and represents such a sharp shift in health policy -- that supporters say one of their biggest tasks is getting enough time with people to answer all their questions . &quot; It is not easy to explain , &quot; said Bill Zimmerman , a campaign strategist for the measure . &quot; We can ' t win on sound bites. &quot; Figuratively speaking , the initiative would put more_than 30 million Californians in the same waiting_room . Its authors seek to enroll seniors on Medicare , low-income persons receiving Medi-Cal , the uninsured and workers and their families with private health_insurance -- in short , all legal residents . The initiative promises cradle-to-grave health_care coverage , a liberal package of mental_health and medical benefits , and money for long-term medical_care and prescription_drugs . It gets the name single-payer because a single state agency would pay everyone ' s medical and hospital bills . Because of the single-payer feature , Proposition 186 goes well beyond the national health reform proposal made by President Clinton and so far stalled in Congress . Under the Clinton plan , insurance_companies would continue to play a key role in the health system . But Proposition 186 is designed to take insurance_companies -- and the expenses they run_up -- out of the health_care system . Initiative supporters argue that insurance profits and overhead consume about 27 % to 30 % of the health dollar , while their system can be run with overhead costs capped at 4 % . The anticipated administrative savings would help fund the system , but monumental tax increases would still be needed . Under the initiative , income , payroll and cigarette taxes would be hiked a combined $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion annually -- roughly the amount now raised each year to run all_of state_government from combined sales , income , insurance and excise_taxes on such things as cigarettes and alcohol . Most working Californians would pay an additional 2.5 % of earnings in state income_tax . In return for the tax bite , individuals and employers would be freed_of the payments they now make_for insurance_premiums and most medical co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses . While they are healthy , individuals under the new tax burdens could suffer a net loss , but with the promise of making_it up when they become ill or grow old . Should the measure pass , the authors anticipate that thousands of insurance_company administrators and clerks , who now process claims , could be thrown_out of their jobs . As compensation , the measure provides_for up_to $ 1 billion of the new tax money to go_into job retraining for those affected . Total dollars going_into the system , counting tax money plus the state and federal transfers that now go_into Medicare for seniors and Medi-Cal for the poor , could exceed $ 75 billion annually , according to the state legislative analyst , or close to $ 100 billion , according to analyses done_by both supporters and opponents of the measure . Even at that , some economists say there will not be enough money and predict multibillion-dollar deficits . Moreover , federal_government approval would be required before Medicare and Medi-Cal patients and self-insured corporate plans could be folded into the proposed network . All that adds_up to an enormously complicated measure -- and political problems for the sponsors of Proposition 186 . A recent Los Angeles Times poll showed that the measure garnered just 9 % approval among likely voters , although the poll did say that two-thirds of those questioned did not know enough about it to form an impression . As a forum to explain the initiative as well as_to raise campaign money , strategists have developed an extensive network of volunteers who are hosting house_parties up and down the state . Usually a_couple_of hours long , the parties are attended by friends and neighbors of the hosts . Typically there are several speakers , often a physician who gives a detailed summary of the initiative , then answers questions . One such house_party in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles , co-hosted by Channing Chase , an actress , and her husband , Dan Saxon , an art_dealer , attracted about two_dozen people who sipped wine , ate cheese and talked_about health_insurance . Chase said she was drawn to Proposition 186 and its guarantee of universal coverage because so many of her actor friends are forced to live without health_insurance when they are between jobs . Spirited debates developed about both the need for health_care reform , which everyone seemed to agree on , and Proposition 186 , which produced a split . &quot; We ' re in a frying pan now , and I think ( Proposition 186 ) would catapult us into a bonfire , &quot; commented one of Chase ' s neighbors . She was clearly in the minority . House_party guests chipped_in just over $ 1 # 000 in contributions . In mid-September , the campaign was holding 50 parties a week , creating what was described as a positive cash flow to the campaign of about $ 40 # 000 . Campaign strategists hope to have those figures up_to 100 house_parties and $ 100 # 000 in contributions per week in October . Proposition 186 strategist Zimmerman said that since surveys show that more_than 80 % of the voters in California have health_insurance , part of the message of the campaign is how easily they could lose their coverage through job loss , divorce or some_other circumstance . &quot; When you explain it to people -- the benefits they would receive , the insecurity they are subject_to now -- we get a consistent two-thirds majority favoring the initiative . The problem is it takes us 10 minutes to explain it , &quot; Zimmerman said . Opponents don ' t share the view that time is all that is needed to persuade people to support the initiative . &quot; We find that the more people hear about the initiative the more they don ' t like it , &quot; said Richard A . Wiebe , the communications director for the &quot; no &quot; on Proposition 186 campaign . One key group , the California State Employees ' Assn. , came_out strongly against the measure after a lengthy review . The opposition is key because the group has been an aggressive advocate of improved health benefits for retired state employees . The association ' s stand has helped neutralize a long list of groups representing seniors and retired workers who are helping lead the charge for Proposition 186 . &quot; We looked_at it very closely and decided there is no way they could provide all those benefits with ( the ) amount_of_money covered , &quot; said Sheena Wolfe , spokeswoman for the group ' s 31 # 000-member retired persons division . She said analysts decided that the proposed payroll , income and cigarette tax increases would provide &quot; nothing more_than a minimum benefits package. &quot; Supporters of the initiative say the state employees ' association is an exception to other working groups because it has a heavily state-subsidized health plan . During a month of unanswered radio and television ads , the opponents spent at least $ 2 million hammering away at what their research showed were the biggest negatives in the minds of voters -- fears of a state-run system headed by an elected officeholder , big tax increases and job losses . Wiebe said one of his biggest concerns is complacency by opponents of the measure who , he declared , &quot; believe this thing is so preposterous that nobody would vote for it. &quot; &quot; All the movement so far has been in our favor , &quot; Wiebe said . But he said he was concerned that could change because the other side hasn ' t &quot; come_to the plate yet &quot; with their radio and television ads . Sponsors of Proposition 186 make_it clear that they are part of a national effort aimed at ultimately moving the United States into a single-payer system . Many see the California election as providing a crucial test vote on single-payer . &quot; If this goes_down , we will be back . I promise you that , &quot; said one well-placed official in a campaign with no lack of passion . Scratch the surface of any rally , fund-raiser or news_conference for Proposition 186 and you will find doctors , nurses or individuals frustrated and fighting mad over the health system . Although Proposition 186 is opposed by the leading establishment voice for physicians , the California Medical Assn. , many doctors support it . Several physicians , among them Dr. Andrew Bindman , a San Francisco internist , helped write the measure . Bindman said he simply got fed up with the increasingly complex and inefficient paper-driven system that he believes is at the root of many of the problems in the health_care system . A huge benefit of single payer , he said , is that everything , from bill payment to medical policy , would come from one source . &quot; The paperwork blizzard just turns_to summer , &quot; he said . More_than 300 groups have endorsed Proposition 186 , among them labor_unions , consumer organizations , senior groups and numerous nurses and physician organizations . On the other side , the bulk of the opposition is coming from business groups , insurance_companies and hospitals . During the last financial reporting period , reflecting contributions through June 30 , the &quot; no &quot; campaign , called Taxpayers Against the Government Takeover , took_in $ 596 # 396 in combined contributions . Big contributions came from the California Hospitals Committee on Issues , $ 205 # 000 , the Health_Insurance Assn . of America , $ 132 # 285 , and the American Council of Life_Insurance , $ 100 # 000 . The &quot; yes &quot; campaign , Californians for Health Security , reported taking_in more -- $ 900 # 838 in cash and non-monetary contributions , including $ 350 # 000 from the National Education Assn . and its state affiliate , the California Teachers Assn . But most of that money was spent qualifying the measure for the ballot and the &quot; no &quot; campaign is expected to raise substantially more for the rest of the campaign . Business_leaders believe the proposed added payroll tax , which would range from 4.4 % to 8.9 % , depending_on the number of employees in a given firm , would deliver a staggering blow to the economy . An economic consulting_firm predicts that passage of the initiative would lead to the loss of 300 # 000 jobs , largely because employers would make_up the cost of the tax by trimming payrolls . Another big fear centers_on the powerful government_agency that would be established to administer a system so large that a 1 % miscalculation on costs could create a $ 1-billion problem . &quot; There is no free lunch , &quot; said Mark Wager , president and chief_executive_officer of Cigna HealthCare of California , a health_maintenance_organization and administrator of plans for businesses . &quot; If someone would like to show me a government_agency capable of creating the fourth- or fifth-largest health_care system in the world and manage it well , I ' d love to see it . Something that size , if you don ' t manage it well , the costs will quickly escalate out of control. &quot; Supporters concede the reputation of government is a problem . &quot; The big thing we need to overcome is people ' s distrust of government being able to do anything right , &quot; said Proposition 186 spokesman Steve Hopcraft . &quot; But insurance_companies are not exactly doing the job . Our mission is to show people that insurance_companies are more inefficient than the government. &quot; Inside the Initiative Here are some main points of Proposition 186 , the single-payer health_care initiative on the Nov . 8 ballot : * CARDS : Would establish the Health Security Act . Health_insurance cards would be provided to all legal residents of California . Whether newcomers would be included would be up_to the Legislature . Cards would provide_for a wide range of benefits . Cardholders would be free to choose their own physician or provider as long as those chosen were in the system . * PERMISSION : Federal permission to join the system would be required for the enrollment of Medicare and Medi-Cal patients and employees of self-insured companies . * PAYMENT : Individuals earning up_to $ 250 # 000 annually , or families earning up_to $ 500 # 000 , would pay an additional 2.5 % of earnings in state income_tax . Those earning more would pay 5 % . * PAYROLL TAX : Employers would pay an extra payroll tax of 4.4 % to 8.9 % on salaries , depending_on the size of their work_force , phased_in over three years . Legal challenges would probably develop over whether the payroll tax would apply to self-insured corporations . * CIGARETTE TAX : Cigarette taxes would be raised an additional $ 1 a pack . * HEALTH COMMISSIONER : The program would be administered by an elected health commissioner . The first commissioner would be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature . Thereafter , the post would come_up for a statewide vote every four years . * BENEFITS : The health commissioner would define benefits , be empowered to cap costs , set co-payments for consumers in the event of budget problems , negotiate budgets with hospitals , determine reimbursement schedules for physicians , negotiate drug prices and establish a list of drugs allowed under the program . * REGIONS : The state would be divided into an undetermined number of health_care service regions , each administered by a local administrator appointed by the health commissioner . * CONSUMER COUNCILS : Consumer councils with professional staffs would be funded in each region to represent the interests of consumers and help mediate disputes with the commissioner .</TEXT>
