   <HEADLINE> GARBANZOS ; A BOY ' S OWN BEAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Garbanzo beans are manly beans . At least they are in those parts of the Mediterranean where they are prepared_for men by other men . In Syria , there are special restaurants where garbanzos ( also known as chick peas ) are prepared in numerous ways by a specialist , called a hamsani . The garbanzos , cooked very slowly in a fired oven , have a meltingly soft texture and delicious flavor . A dish of cooked garbanzos and crumbled pita , onions and &quot; white &quot; oil ( a highly acidic and unusual mixture of cold water , baking soda , garlic and cold , old olive_oil ) is a favorite among men when they get_together to play cards . It is called fatteh bi-zeit , which means &quot; shredded bread with oil. &quot; It is literally a dish that one can fix while someone shuffles the deck . While Syrian men eat this snack in the evening during card_games , in neighboring southeastern Turkey a similar dish is eaten for breakfast . Again , it is a dish prepared_for men by other men . In the central market of Gaziantep , I came_upon a covered shelter along one wall , shaded , cool , dimly lit , nearly as large as a railroad_station waiting room . Here a_couple_of hundred men were sitting around sipping tea and eating nohutlu durum , a rolled-up round of thick pita filled with garbanzos , slivered onions , parsley , red_pepper and sumac . The garbanzos had simmered all night in a broth flavored with lamb bones . Unfortunately , it is more interesting to describe than it was to eat . In the streets of Tunis there are numerous hole-in-the-wall soup_kitchens that serve nothing but garbanzo soup . Here garbanzos simmer overnight , with calves ' feet or marrow bones added_to give heft and flavor . The soup is served in deep earthen bowls ladled over stale bread cubes , then slathered with fiery harissa sauce and accented with ground cumin , lemon_juice and plenty of olive_oil . * The dish is affectionately called leblebi , a name that imitates the bellowing of a ram in heat , according to a Tunisian philologist , Ouled-Abdessayed Khamais . ( In Turkey , the word refers to char-roasted garbanzos. ) &quot; When you eat leblebi , &quot; a friend once counseled me , &quot; bring a handkerchief , because the dish is so hot with spices that the nose runs ferociously. &quot; Stimulating as the street version is , it can be further embellished with the favorite Tunisian garnish of canned tuna , capers , pickled vegetables and hard-boiled_eggs . ( In private homes , a poached egg is substituted. ) In this form it becomes an entire meal . Here is a good tip from Tunisian home cooks . During the period of Ramadan , they store garbanzos and fava_beans , previously soaked and drained , in airtight containers in the freezer . Every day a handful of each is thrown into the soup to be served to break the fast that night . The garbanzos and favas keep well for up_to a month , and it ' s not necessary to defrost them first . Garbanzos benefit from soaking overnight in plenty of water . But first I always toss the garbanzos with a little baking_soda , remembering to rinse the garbanzos in several changes of water in the morning . This enhances the desirable luscious texture of the garbanzos . I have never produced delectable garbanzos using the quick one-hour soak . Recently I have started to cook garbanzos in salted water . It adds an hour ' s cooking time , but they do taste better . * Cook garbanzos in a covered pot , preferably earthenware . ( Enameled cast_iron is a good alternative. ) Or cook them in much less water and without salt in a pressure_cooker for about 35 minutes with equal success . BASIC COOKED GARBANZOS 1 1 / 2 cups ( about 1 / 2 pound ) dried garbanzos , picked_over 1 / 2 teaspoon baking soda , optional Water 1 small onion , or 1 small veal marrow bone with some meat attached , or 1 small piece of cracked veal foot 3 / 4 teaspoon coarse salt Gently toss garbanzos with baking soda in bowl and cover with 1 quart water . Let stand at room_temperature at least 8 hours . Rinse garbanzos thoroughly . Place in enameled cast-iron Dutch_oven or earthenware bowl . Add onion and coarse salt . Cover with 2 quarts boiling water . Cover and set_in 300-degree oven to simmer until tender , 2 to 3 hours . Remove from oven and discard onion . Skim and discard fat if meaty bones were used . Garbanzos will keep , covered and refrigerated , for several days . Makes 3 3 / 4 cups , about 7 servings . Each serving contains about : 160 calories ; 263 mg sodium ; trace cholesterol ; 3 grams fat ; 27 grams carbohydrates ; 8 grams protein ; 1.82 grams fiber . * Many tasters in The Times Test Kitchen found the leblebi delicious even without the garnish of tuna and pickled vegetables . Try it both ways . Slivered pickled turnips with beets can be found at Middle Eastern grocers . TUNISIAN GARBANZO AND HARISSA SOUP ( Leblebi ) 3 3 / 4 cups Basic Cooked Garbanzos , with liquid 3 tablespoons olive_oil 3 tablespoons Homemade Harissa 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon ground cumin 3 tablespoons fresh strained lemon_juice 3 to 4 cups cubed stale peasant-style bread 1 ( 6-ounce ) can imported tuna packed in olive_oil , drained and coarsely flaked 1 / 3 cup slivered pickled turnips with beets 1 / 2 cup thinly sliced green_onions or red_onion 2 tablespoons small capers , rinsed and drained 4 lemon wedges Table Harissa Sauce , optional Drain Basic Cooked Garbanzos , reserving 1 quart cooking liquid . Put olive_oil in straight-sided 10-inch skillet over medium heat . Add Homemade Harissa and garlic . Cook , stirring , until harissa begins to sizzle , 30 seconds . Add garbanzos and fry another 30 seconds . Cover with reserved cooking liquid . Bring to boil , then reduce heat and cook gently 5 minutes . Add cumin and lemon_juice . Divide stale bread cubes among 4 deep soup_bowls . Ladle garbanzos and 1 cup cooking liquid into each bowl . Garnish each serving with tuna_fish , turnips , green_onions , capers and lemon wedge . Pass Table Harissa Sauce to make extra hot . Makes 4 servings . Each serving contains about : 418 calories ; 1 # 081 mg sodium ; 9 mg cholesterol ; 16 grams fat ; 47 grams carbohydrates ; 22 grams protein ; 2.24 grams fiber . Note : To make Table Harissa Sauce for Leblebi , in bowl combine 3 tablespoons Homemade Harissa , 1 tablespoon ground cumin , 1 tablespoon minced garlic , 2 tablespoons olive_oil , 3 tablespoons fresh lemon_juice and 1 / 2 cup reserved garbanzo cooking liquor and mix well . Makes about 3 / 4 cup . * In Tunisia , fiery hot red_peppers play a role in almost every dish , usually in the form of the famous harissa sauce , a mixture of sun-dried peppers pounded with spices and garlic and packed into jars under a coating of oil . The Tunisian / French harissa sauce sold here in tubes bears little resemblance to a true homemade harissa paste . In fact , I find commercial harissa pretty dreadful . I used to use Indonesian sambal oelek as a sort of workhorse for most of my Tunisian cooking , adding ground coriander , caraway and garlic to give it the proper pungent , rounded taste . The mildly hot_peppers used to make this sauce in Tunisia appear similar to New Mexican fresh chile peppers ( California Anaheims ) but are closer in flavor to the poblano or dried ancho . Now that dried ancho chiles are available , I make my own . I soak the peppers , then grind them with a little garlic , salt , spices and a roasted red_pepper for an even richer texture . Incidentally , in Tunisian home cooking , many soups , stews and sauces begin the same way : The cook stirs some tomato_paste into a spoonful of hot oil ; when the paste turns glossy and gives_off a good aroma , some harissa , diluted with water , and stirred until smooth , is added_to the pot , along with the vegetables , liquid , herbs and spices . This method not only tames the harissa but creates a creamier sauce . Homemade Harissa Sauce 3 ounces dried chiles , preferably anchos , or mixture of New Mexican chiles , pasillas , guajillos or cascabels 1 large clove garlic , minced 1 teaspoon ground coriander_seeds 3 / 4 teaspoon ground caraway_seeds 1 medium sweet red_pepper , roasted , stemmed , seeded , chopped , wrapped in cheesecloth and pressed until dry Salt Olive_oil Stem , seed and rinse dried chiles . Place in bowl and add boiling water to cover . Cover bowl and let chiles stand 30 minutes . Drain , wrap in cheesecloth and press_out excess moisture . Grind chiles in food_processor with garlic , coriander and caraway_seeds , sweet red_pepper and 3 / 4 teaspoon salt . If necessary , add small amount of olive_oil to make smooth paste . Pack mixture into small clean jar , cover with thin layer of oil , close with lid and keep refrigerated . Will keep 2 to 3 weeks in refrigerator . Makes about 1 / 2 cup . * The &quot; white &quot; oil typically used to make fatteh bi-zeit in Syria is actually an oil of second quality . In my adaptation below I use a better grade of olive_oil . The dish makes a delightful simple snack . Near East or Aleppo red_pepper is available at Middle Eastern grocers . SYRIAN GARBANZOS WITH OLIVE_OIL AND PITA ( Fatteh Bi-Zeit ) 2 cloves garlic_Salt 1 / 2 pound pitas , split 1 1 / 3 cups Basic Cooked Garbanzos , with 1 cup cooking liquid 3 tablespoons olive_oil 2 tablespoons cold water 1 / 4 teaspoon ground cumin 2 dashes of Near East or Aleppo red_pepper 6 to 8 green_onions , thinly sliced Peel and crush garlic with dash of salt . Set_aside . Toast pitas at 350 degrees until golden-brown . Remove and break_into small pieces . Place in wide , shallow serving bowl . Reheat Basic Cooked Garbanzos in saucepan with cooking liquid . Add crushed garlic . Quickly tilt saucepan and moisten pita pieces with garbanzo liquid , then toss bread well . Spread garlicky garbanzos on top . Beat olive_oil with cold water and drizzle over garbanzos . Sprinkle with cumin and Near East red_pepper . Garnish with green_onions . Serve at once . Makes 4 servings .

In the ingredient list I suggest some substitutes , but if you have a sausage-making machine you can make these sausages with ease . Grind 1 / 2 pound pork with 2 to 3 ounces of pork fat ; moisten the meat with a_few tablespoons of white_wine , salt , pepper and dashes of cinnamon or nutmeg , powdered cloves and crumbled thyme . Then force the seasoned meat into a casing and hang the sausage in an airy place for 24 hours . The sausage is cooked in boiling water and eaten hot or cold . GARBANZOS WITH TOMATOES , FRESH SAUSAGE AND PEPPERS ( Garbanzos a la Catalana ) 1 1 / 2 cups dried garbanzos , picked_over Water Baking_soda Coarse salt 1 / 2 pound Catalonian sausage or fresh country-style pork_sausage 1 / 3 pound slab bacon or lean salt_pork Oil or lard , optional 1 cup chopped onions 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic 1 cup diced green_pepper 4 large ripe tomatoes , peeled , seeded and chopped Grated nutmeg or cinnamon 1 / 4 teaspoon ground thyme Pepper Soak garbanzos in water overnight with dash baking soda in large bowl or pot . Drain garbanzos , rinse well and cook in lightly salted simmering water , covered in large pot , 1 hour . Simmer sausage in pot of water 20 minutes or brown in skillet . Drain off most of fat and cut sausage into 1-inch chunks . Set_aside . Simmer bacon in pot 10 minutes in water , drain , rinse well and dice . In skillet brown bacon , onion , garlic and green_pepper in 1 tablespoon sausage fat , or in 1 tablespoon oil or lard , over medium heat , stirring frequently . Add tomatoes , nutmeg , thyme , salt and pepper to taste . Cook , covered , 10 minutes . Fold in sausage slices . Drain garbanzos , reserving 2 cups cooking liquid . Put garbanzos in baking dish . Spoon in tomato-sausage mixture . Moisten with reserved garbanzo cooking liquid . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Cover dish and bake at 375 degrees 1 1 / 2 hours , stirring from time to time . Serve in wide soup_plates . Makes 6 servings . Each serving contains about : 457 calories ; 494 mg sodium ; 32 mg cholesterol ; 28 grams fat ; 38 grams carbohydrates ; 16 grams protein ; 2.84 grams fiber . * I ' ve eaten many marvelous dishes in Greece , including this Macedonian version of garbanzos , eggplants and tomatoes . When I first tried it , I liked it so_much I asked my Greek food-writer friend Aglaia Kremezi to find the recipe . The secret , it turned_out , is preparing the dish in an earthenware pot so that the correct amount of moisture is released during cooking . A dish as_good_as this need be accompanied only by dense , chewy bread . MACEDONIAN CHICK PEAS , EGG PLANTS AND TOMATOES 1 / 2 pound dried garbanzos , picked_over Water Baking_soda Coarse salt 1 ( 1-pound ) eggplant 1 / 4 cup olive_oil 2 chopped onions 1 Italian green frying pepper , cored , seeded and cut_into small pieces 2 1 / 2 teaspoons chopped long green chile 1 1 / 2 teaspoons garlic , peeled and crushed with dash of salt 2 cups canned tomatoes with juice 1 / 2 cup chopped parsley 1 teaspoon Greek oregano 1 bay_leaf Soak garbanzos in water overnight with dash baking soda in large bowl or pot . Drain garbanzos . Place in saucepan , add fresh_water to cover and 1 / 4 teaspoon coarse salt , bring_to boil and simmer , covered , over low heat until half-done , about 45 minutes . Set_aside . While garbanzos are cooking , peel eggplant and cut_into 1-inch cubes . Sprinkle lightly with coarse salt and let stand_in colander about 45 minutes to draw_off excess moisture . Set_aside . Heat oil in 12-inch skillet . Add onions , frying pepper and chile . Stir 3 minutes . Add eggplant and saute without browning 2 minutes . Add garlic , tomatoes and juice , parsley , oregano and 1 teaspoon coarse salt . Simmer 10 minutes , stirring often . In 4-quart bean pot , casserole or earthenware-lined electric cooker , mix garbanzos , 1 3 / 4 cup cooking liquid , bay_leaf and contents of skillet . Cover pot with clay plate or parchment paper ( fasten to pot with string ) . Bake at 300 degrees 2 1 / 2 to 6 hours , or all day in electric cooker . Remove cover , increase heat and bake 10 minutes more to evaporate excessive moisture . Garbanzos should be very tender and finished sauce should coat them thickly . Makes 6 servings . Each serving contains about : 280 calories ; 794 mg sodium ; trace cholesterol ; 12 grams fat ; 38 grams carbohydrates ; 10 grams protein ; 2.96 grams fiber . * I used to joke about writing a book in which I would follow the garbanzo around the Mediterranean , using this humble pulse as a prism through which to view culinary influences and history . Here ' s a dish that shows what I mean . You will find old Spanish versions with cured ham as a flavoring , served with lentils in Syria , favored with cumin in Egypt , flavored with cinnamon in Turkey and garnished with chopped onion in Lebanon . This Tunisian version , made with tomato and chile pepper , is my favorite . It can be served as a light meal with a brined ripened cheese such_as feta along with pickles , bread and salad . GARBANZOS AND SWISS_CHARD IN THE STYLE OF THE TUNISIAN SAHEL ( Morshan ) 3 / 4 pound Swiss_chard leaves , stemmed , rinsed and torn_into large pieces 2 large cloves garlic , peeled 1 / 2 teaspoon coarse salt 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 small dried red chile 2 tablespoons olive_oil 1 / 2 cup minced onion 2 teaspoons tomato_paste 1 cup Basic Cooked Garbanzos , with 3 / 4 cup cooking liquid 1 lemon , cut_in wedges , optional In pot steam , parboil or microwave chard leaves until tender , about 5 minutes . Set leaves in colander to drain . Squeeze_out excess moisture and shred coarsely . Crush garlic in mortar with salt , coriander and chile until thick , crumbly paste forms . Heat olive_oil in 10-inch skillet and saute onion until pale-golden . Add garlic paste and tomato_paste and stir into oil until sizzling . Add chard , Basic Cooked Garbanzos and cooking liquid and cook , stirring occasionally , 10 minutes . Remove from heat and let stand until ready to serve . ( Contents of skillet should be very moist but not soupy . For looser texture , stir in more garbanzo cooking liquid. ) Serve warm , at room_temperature or cold with lemon wedges . Makes 4 servings . Note : Broccoli_rabe , dandelion leaves , mustard greens , kale or turnip tops may be substituted for Swiss_chard . Discard any yellow or damaged leaves and cook like chard . Cooking time will vary .
