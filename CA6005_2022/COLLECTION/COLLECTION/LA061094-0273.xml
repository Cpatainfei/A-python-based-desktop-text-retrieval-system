   <HEADLINE> O.C. THEATER / JAN HERMAN ; FAME STEALS SHOW IN O.C. BROADWAY SERIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Think_of it : Carol Channing starring in &quot; Hello , Dolly ! &quot; again , 30 years after she originated the title_role . Now that ' s chutzpah . Next June , when she gets_to the Orange County Performing Arts Center , which announced earlier this week that the musical will be part of its 1994-95 Broadway Series , she ' ll be past 74 . More power to her . But do you really want to see a septuagenarian Dolly Levi ? I suppose there ' s no law against one . Dolly doesn ' t really have to dance in the show . She doesn ' t even have to sing . Channing ' s celebrated show-biz style owes more to talking her songs than singing them , anyway . Still , it makes you wonder how old Horace Vandergelder will have to be . Surely not a day under 80 . ( You remember him . He ' s the rich old_boy she marries ) . Other thoughts occur about the series . For example , do theatergoers realize they ' ll be seeing &quot; Jelly ' s Last Jam &quot; with Maurice Hines in the starring role , not younger brother Gregory , who starred in the show on Broadway ? Maurice happens to be a very fine dancer , but he doesn ' t quite have Gregory ' s charisma as a performer . But let ' s face it : The center and every_other theatrical venue booking these touring shows are playing a name game . It ' s the proven way to draw an audience . * Marie Osmond , coming next season in &quot; The Sound of Music , &quot; is another transparent instance of easy attraction , and a more dubious one . Given her wholesome image , Osmond playing the postulant nun made famous by Mary Martin promises to be even less of an artistic reach than her brother Donny is making in the title_role of &quot; Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. &quot; He ' s been such a smash hit in that touring show , first in Toronto and now in Chicago , that she ' ll probably be a bigger hit in this show in Costa Mesa . If you ask OCPAC executive_director Tom Tomlinson for his thoughts on the name game , he says Channing &quot; certainly owns the role &quot; and that &quot; the audience will look_forward to seeing an established star who ' s a legend in the business. &quot; Marie Osmond also gets his personal endorsement . &quot; I went_up to San Francisco to see her ( performance ) , &quot; he said earlier this week . &quot; I was surprised -- that ' s the wrong word -- pleasantly pleased to see the good job she did . And the costumes and scenery were beautiful. &quot; All the same , it makes you grateful for the prospect of catching Petula Clark in &quot; Blood Brothers. &quot; Despite the show ' s mixed reviews as a downbeat musical , at least Clark will be coming_to the center relatively fresh from her personal triumph on Broadway . She helped save &quot; Blood_Brothers &quot; from closing when she stepped into one of the starring roles almost a year ago . Clark , who plays a desperately poor mother of nine children , left the Broadway production only last week to be in the road version . &quot; Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat , &quot; also coming_to the center , doesn ' t have a name star -- yet . But the producers are hinting strongly that it will . ( Could it be Donny ? Doubtful . He ' s on a different tour. ) The &quot; Joseph &quot; we ' ll be getting is the one coming from Broadway . It ' s the same version that went_to Broadway from the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles where it played last year for almost five months . Which brings us to &quot; Porgy and Bess. &quot; No name stars here . Marquita Lister will play Bess in this import from the Houston Grand_Opera . It ' s doubtful you ever heard of her . But if things go right with this new revival of George and Ira Gershwin ' s classic folk opera , nothing else in next season ' s Broadway Series will come_close to touching it artistically . A total of eight other opera_companies have invested in the production , including the Los Angeles Music Center Opera . * Tomlinson is justifiably proud_of getting Costa Mesa on the show ' s itinerary . To make_it happen , he said , the center gladly invested $ 50 # 000 of its own . &quot; I wanted us to be part of its tour , &quot; he said . &quot; That kind of opportunity comes_along very rarely. &quot; The money , which he regards less as an investment than as an added &quot; cost-of-artist fee , &quot; comes from a reserve_fund the center has for programming ( a fund now &quot; in excess of $ 1 million , &quot; Tomlinson said. ) The Houston Grand_Opera has done &quot; Porgy and Bess &quot; before . Opera Pacific brought one of Houston ' s earlier revivals to the center in 1987 . But this one is said to be a revamp from top to bottom . Though &quot; Porgy and Bess &quot; will play the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles a week before coming south , that still shouldn ' t take the glory or the adventure out of the center ' s involvement .</TEXT>
