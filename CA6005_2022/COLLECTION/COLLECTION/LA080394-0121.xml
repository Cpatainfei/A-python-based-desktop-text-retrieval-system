   <TEXT> Officials from the Dominican_Republic said Tuesday that they have reached an agreement allowing an international force to patrol the country ' s border and prevent smuggling of fuel and other goods into Haiti . U.S. and Dominican officials said the mission will include more_than 80 civilian and military_personnel from the United States , Canada , Argentina and Brazil , expected to arrive within two weeks.Brazil , however , later denied that it will help staff the force . In Washington , the Defense_Department said it will supply six helicopters to be flown_by Dominican_Republic pilots . It will also send the Dominican_Republic 50 trucks , 45 motorcycles , six inflatable boats and 106 radios for the operation , the department said . Pentagon spokesman Dennis Boxx said the international force will not stop the smugglers but rather report them to Dominican_Republic border authorities . Smuggling of fuel across the nations ' border is considered a major reason for the failure of a U.N. economic embargo to force the ouster of Haiti ' s military_leaders . News of the agreement came as President Joaquin Balaguer was declared winner of the Dominican_Republic ' s May presidential election , which critics said was riddled with fraud . Balaguer was reelected by a margin of less than 1 % over opposition candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez , the Central Elections Board said . By constitutional mandate , the elections board had to declare a winner before inauguration_day , scheduled for Aug . 16 .</TEXT>
