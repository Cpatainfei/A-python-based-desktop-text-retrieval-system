   <TEXT> ISSUE : In the wake of recent political and economic reforms , sub-Saharan African_countries are hoping to boost foreign investment and increase trade with Asia , Europe and the United States . But given the region ' s largely underdeveloped economies , will the efforts be successful ? BACKGROUND : History casts a negative shadow . In recent times , Africa has played only a minimal role in international business , accounting_for just 1.1 % of total world trade_in 1991 . Despite abundant natural and human resources , many of sub-Saharan Africa ' s 42 independent countries are among the world ' s poorest . Massive foreign debt has sapped the strength of the area ' s diverse economies . Under prodding from international lending organizations , many sub-Saharan countries introduced reforms in the 1980s . In its first comprehensive report on African_countries , the World_Bank reported last week that those countries that introduced tough austerity measures and other reforms , such_as Ghana , showed growth , and those that did not fell further behind . The current global recession has hit the region particularly hard . Falling demand for Africa ' s main exports -- basic commodities such_as metal , timber and coffee -- hurt individual countries ' abilities to raise hard currency used to import needed food and fuel . Many observers say the resulting shortages of basic supplies have added_to social strife and political instability . South_Africa , the region ' s economic powerhouse , is expected to benefit from the lifting of economic sanctions in response to reforms to end apartheid . In November , officials from several U.S. firms , including IBM Corp. , Arco Chemical and Time Warner Inc. , accompanied U.S. Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown on a trade mission to Johannesburg . Other sub-Saharan nations are hoping to ride the coattails of a reformed South_Africa . But while South_Africa ' s comparatively well-developed infrastructure has allowed it to attract foreign trade , sub-Saharan Africa as_a_whole suffers from a long list of problems that discourage commerce : primitive transportation networks , power shortages , severely limited financial resources and struggling education and health_care systems . In addition , human-rights abuses and ethnic violence in some countries have given international investors pause . STRATEGY : Faced with such obstacles , many African_countries are undergoing dramatic structural reform . As a condition for new loans and debt refinancing , the World_Bank has required privatization of banking , energy and transportation industries in some countries . In addition , the International Monetary Fund has urged governments to curb spending and devalue their currencies . World_Bank officials say the programs have created sustained economic_growth in about 15 African_countries , most notably Ghana , Kenya , Tanzania and Uganda . Currency devaluation has allowed African exporters to offer their goods at prices low enough to compete with cheaper products from Asia and Latin_America . But critics say the economic gains have been offset by higher costs for basic goods and lower living standards . A devaluation of the African franc in January , for example , sparked fears of food shortages and riots in the Congo , Ivory_Coast and Niger , as prices doubled overnight . OUTLOOK : Much of the effort to boost trade_in Africa depends_on the success of political and economic reforms . Consider Kenya : Despite special tax_breaks and trade zones for importers , worries about political and ethnic strife have negated the government ' s efforts to attract foreign investors . While continued privatization of key industries and restructuring of foreign debt payments have spurred growth in the region , many economists doubt such gains will endure without modernized roads , railways and power_plants . Recent financial commitments from the World_Bank and IMF may help . The World_Bank approved $ 440 million for a Tanzanian energy project several months ago and could help with plans to upgrade airports in Zanzibar and other cities . Last year , the bank ' s renewed ties to South_Africa resulted in an $ 850-million loan to finance imports . Although the focus will be_on attracting multinational corporations , some observers say the key to economic development could lie_with small and medium-sized companies in Africa and overseas . The IMF recently opened an office for small-business loans in South_Africa , and American entrepreneurs are looking_at ventures throughout the sub-Saharan region . &quot; Small businesses are often a better fit for African_countries , which tend to buy imports in relatively small quantities , &quot; said Reuben Jaja , president of the Africa-USA Chamber_of_Commerce &amp; Industry . &quot; Also , small-business men can be mentors for their counterparts in Africa . There ' s more of a one-on-one relationship with them than with companies like IBM and AT &amp; T. &quot;</TEXT>
