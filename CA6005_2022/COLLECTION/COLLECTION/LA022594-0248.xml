   <HEADLINE> VIRUS FATAL TO 30 IN SOUTHWEST CLAIMS FIRST NORTHEAST VICTIM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A respiratory virus that killed more_than 30 people in the Southwest last summer has claimed its first victim in the Northeast , health officials confirmed Thursday . The latest person to die from hantaviral pulmonary syndrome was identified as David Rosenberg , 22 , a student at the Rhode Island School of Design.He died Jan . 20 . Government health experts said they believe Rosenberg contracted the virus during Christmas break , possibly in the Queens section of New York City where he reportedly helped clean_out a rat- and mouse-infested warehouse . That would be significant because the virus that infected the student has been found previously only in rural deer_mice . &quot; This is important , because it is in an area where there are no deer_mice , &quot; said Dr. Rima Khabbaz , a member of the Hantavirus Task_Force at the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention in Atlanta . &quot; If this involves rats common to inner_cities , the implication is that more people will be exposed to the hantavirus. &quot; State and federal_officials are searching areas that the man visited in New York and Rhode Island in hopes of finding traces of the hantavirus and infected rodents . The virus is characterized by flu-like symptoms with fever , muscle aches , headache and cough , followed by respiratory failure as the lungs fill with fluid and the patient essentially drowns . The disease is fatal about 60 % of the time . Fifty-nine hantavirus cases have been identified in the United States since the disease was first recognized in May . Most of the victims came from the Four Corners area of Colorado , Utah , Arizona and New Mexico . The first case east of the Mississippi_River showed_up early last month in Indiana , when a 48-year-old teacher died three days after developing symptoms , including breathing problems , nausea and fever .</TEXT>
