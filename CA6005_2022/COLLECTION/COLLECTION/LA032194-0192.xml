   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES AND TOM PETRUNO : PAPER LOSSES LEAVE BOND INVESTORS WONDERING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Phoenix investor Wesley Phillips made his first foray_into bond mutual_funds last year . So far , his experience hasn ' t been an especially pleasant one . Phillips ' adventure began in May , when he started moving money out of certificates_of_deposit into two Franklin tax-free funds in search of higher returns . He later added_to those positions and put some cash into a third fund , Franklin Income , which holds bonds and higher-yielding stocks . Although all three funds have good track records , that was of little consolation when interest_rates started to push higher in October and accelerated their rise in early February . Because interest_rates move inversely to bond prices , the latest trend has hurt nearly all bond fund investors . &quot; I understood ( at the time of purchase ) that bond funds could fluctuate in price , &quot; says Phillips , who invested $ 250 # 000 in the three funds and has lost nearly $ 4 # 000 in principal , excluding the sales commissions he paid . &quot; What I didn ' t realize that interest_rates were so low they could only go up. &quot; In this sense , he ' s not alone . Investors pumped a record $ 144 billion into bond funds in 1993 and many of them , like Phillips , may be wondering if they can ever recoup their paper losses . The answer , of course , is yes . Bond funds can appreciate as quickly as they have dropped_in recent weeks , assuming the interest_rate trend turns favorable . The hard part , of course , is predicting whether that will happen . Terry Anderson , branch manager at brokerage Diversified Securities in Tustin , says he ' s modestly concerned about rising interest_rates and is cautioning his clients about government_bond funds , which have a somewhat undeserved reputation for being &quot; safe. &quot; While the bonds owned by these funds aren ' t going_to go_into default -- eliminating one type of risk -- they nevertheless would be hurt by rising interest_rates . C . Frazier Evans , senior economist for the Colonial fund group in Boston , offers a more optimistic outlook . He expects to see a bond market rally developing by the second_half of 1994 , fueled by three catalysts : continuing low inflation , a shrinking federal_deficit and a slowing economy later this year . Similarly , Richard Schlanger , a bond fund manager for the Boston-based Pioneer group , thinks this year ' s bond market slide has been overdone . He sees the possibility of &quot; rough_water ahead followed by a calm. &quot; Regardless of your forecast for interest_rates , it ' s important to diversify your bond fund holdings among different segments of the market . For example , Anderson and Evans like the idea of multisector or flexible bond funds , which tend to hold a mix of U.S._government bonds , foreign government_bonds and lower-rated or &quot; junk &quot; domestic debt . Tax-exempt municipal_bond funds also remain attractive despite lower prices in recent weeks , say Evans and Anderson . Higher tax_rates this year have boosted demand for these securities , while the supply of new bonds coming_to market is expected to contract to $ 180 billion this year from a record $ 290 billion in 1993 , according to Evans . In addition , risk-shy investors should be careful not to put all their marbles in long-term bond funds . Though short-term portfolios pay lower yields , they don ' t get bruised as much when interest_rates do rise . Conservative investors , even retirees , might also consider having a small stake in_stock funds . For clients who don ' t have to live_off every dime of income , Anderson recommends some stock fund holdings as a longer-term inflation hedge and diversification move . As a general rule , Evans suggests subtracting your age from 110 , and putting that much of your portfolio in_stock funds . For Phillips , 70 , that would work_out to a 40 % equity stake . Sheldon Jacobs , publisher of the No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter in Irvington-on-Hudson , N.Y. , also recommends a 40 % stake in_stock funds , including those that venture into international markets , within his retirement model portfolio . He suggests another 20 % in income funds , which are dominated by bonds but also include some equity holdings , and just 40 % in pure bond products . By contrast , the new Stagecoach LifePath 2000 Fund from San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank is more conservative . This portfolio is designed for people in their 50s and 60s who anticipate they will retire or otherwise need the money around the year 2000 . Though its allocation mix will fluctuate , the fund is expected to maintain a stock exposure of about 20 % . And you could come_up with many_more allocation examples for conservative investors . The main point is to realize that the vast majority of fixed-income funds will drop_in price if interest_rates continue to rise . Yet the extent of price damage will vary by the average maturity and types of bonds held , which makes diversification a good rule for even risk-shy individuals . The Century City-based Pilgrim Group of mutual_funds has lost its court battle with mutual_fund rating service Morningstar Inc. of Chicago , which Pilgrim alleged had libeled it . Pilgrim sued Morningstar a year ago , charging that Morningstar had damaged the company with a newsletter report that questioned the accuracy of some of Pilgrim ' s fund advertisements . Pilgrim wanted a trial to prove its point . But in a decision Friday from the California Court of Appeal for the second appellate district , the company ' s suit was ordered dismissed . Morningstar , as a publisher , had asserted its First_Amendment right to question Pilgrim ' s ads , and the court agreed that Morningstar ' s analysis was &quot; non-actionable. &quot; Pilgrim , which manages $ 2.8 billion , has been embroiled in a number of controversies over its funds in recent years . The company issued a terse statement Sunday indicating that it will not attempt to appeal the court decision . &quot; As far as we are concerned , the_matter is now closed , and we shall continue to focus our efforts on delivering top performance to our shareholders , &quot; Pilgrim said . Measuring Bond Viability Virtually all bonds and bond mutual_funds decline in price when interest_rates rise , just as they appreciate when the rates drop . However , the magnitude of any fluctuations depends_on the type of debt_instrument , especially its maturity . Here is roughly how much principal loss various bonds and mutual_funds would see if interest_rates rose by one percentage_point . 5-year Treasury : -2.4 % 10-year Treasury : -6.1 30-year Treasury : -11.9 10-year municipal ( rated AA ) : -6.9 30-year municipal ( rated AA ) : -13.4 Average municipal fund ( long-term ) : -9.0 Average GNMA fund ( intermediate term ) : -3.5 Sources : Porter Pierpont Morgan , Liberty Financial Cos .</TEXT>
