The rapidly growing American cruise market is expected to reach 8 million passengers a year by 2000 , nearly double the present 4.5 million , according to Cruise Lines International Assn . Look_for the following trends in 1995 : * Good_deals in pre- and post-cruise packages . * More truth in cruise advertising . Gone are the days when anything that floated was termed &quot; a luxury cruise ship. &quot; * Fewer niche cruise lines in the near future . Overspecialized lines had a bad year in 1994 , with both child-oriented American Family Cruises and Carnival Cruise Line ' s Latin-themed FiestaMarina Cruises going_out of business . * More strenuous attention paid to cruise_ship inspections . * The gradual departure of older ships as new Safety of Life at_Sea regulations begin in 1995 .</TEXT>
