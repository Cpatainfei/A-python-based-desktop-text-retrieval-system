   <HEADLINE> EVEN A STRONG CASE BY D.A. CAN BE TESTED BY DEFENSE ; STRATEGY : SIMPSON LAWYERS WILL TRY TO KEEP_OUT EVIDENCE FROM SEARCH , 911 TAPES . IT WILL NOT BE EASY , EXPERTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It can appear to be a powerful case : blood_tests seem to link the suspect to the scene , a search conducted under a warrant uncovers incriminating items and police have evidence showing that the suspect had brutalized the victim before . But skillful defense work -- and the right set of circumstances -- can unravel the most carefully crafted prosecutions . Lawyers for O.J. Simpson are expected to file a variety of motions to try to keep_out evidence that allegedly ties the famed former athlete to the murders of his ex-wife and her friend . On Tuesday they are scheduled to argue a motion to suppress evidence from a search of Simpson ' s home June 13 . They also may eventually try to exclude other evidence , including his statements to police , old 911 tapes of Nicole Brown Simpson calling_for help as a man identified as O.J. Simpson raged in the background , and the results of DNA tests that might indicate that blood and hair found at the murder scene match Simpson ' s . None of it will be easy . But if Simpson ' s lawyers successfully show the initial search of his home was illegal , the prosecution could lose key evidence : the bloody glove that apparently matches one found at the murder scene and possibly even blood found on Simpson ' s driveway . &quot; It would be an amazing event that the most crucial piece of evidence in a high-profile murder case was thrown_out , &quot; said Cristina Arguedas , a Bay Area criminal defense_attorney . &quot; That would take one gutsy judge. &quot; But such motions have succeeded before in long-shot cases . In a Bay Area case , a man facing 40 years in prison after drugs and a machine_gun were found in his home was set_free because police had made a false implication in applying for the search_warrant . In the Christian Brando murder case in 1991 , the same lawyers who are defending Simpson successfully kept_out Brando ' s statements to police because an officer had omitted a phrase in the reading of the Miranda rights . And a Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled DNA evidence inadmissible two years ago because of scientific uncertainty over how to calculate the odds of a match . Admissibility of the Search In the pending motion to suppress evidence , Simpson ' s lawyers argue that the police , scaling a five-foot-high fence , illegally entered the grounds of the ex-athlete ' s Brentwood home when they first went there at 4:30 a.m. on June 13 to notify him of his ex-wife ' s death . Once on the grounds , police found the bloodstained glove . Later , they noticed blood leading from Simpson ' s white Ford Bronco on the street to his front_door , according to an affidavit by Los Angeles Police Detective Philip L . Vannatter . Police are required to obtain a warrant to search someone ' s property except under certain conditions , such_as when they are pursuing a fleeing suspect or attempting to preserve evidence they fear is about to be destroyed . Even a search done with a warrant can be unlawful if police misrepresented an important fact in seeking it . Simpson ' s lawyers contend that police inaccurately characterized Simpson ' s absence in their warrant application by stating that he had left on an &quot; unexpected &quot; flight to Chicago , even though they knew he was_on a planned business trip . But defense_lawyers said a warrant can only be thrown_out for deliberate misrepresentation if the magistrate would not have issued it without the false_statements . Some defense_attorneys said Thursday they believe the warrant might be upheld when it is heard next week because police said they saw &quot; what appeared to be human blood &quot; on the driver ' s door handle of Simpson ' s Bronco , which was parked on the street . That evidence alone , they said , might have been enough to obtain the search_warrant . Others said it would not be enough . &quot; The mere presence of bloodstains on the white Bronco parked on a public street might not be enough to say there was exigent circumstances to go inside the estate , unless that blood was very fresh , &quot; said UCLA criminal_law professor Peter Arenella . Several lawyers said it was difficult to make a definitive assessment because critical facts have not been revealed yet . Los Angeles criminal defense_lawyer Barry Levin noted that &quot; Vannatter ' s affidavit is devoid_of key details . It says nothing about jumping the fence or the purpose for which the entry was made. &quot; San Francisco Public_Defender Jeff Brown said : &quot; If you are going_to climb over someone ' s fence , you better get a warrant . You are stupid if you don ' t . You are just screwing_up somebody ' s case. &quot; The Police Interview As the case proceeds , Simpson ' s lawyers also may try to prevent the prosecution from using his statements to the police prior to his arrest . Against the advice of his then-attorney , Howard Weitzman , Simpson talked to police by himself for three hours on the day after the slayings . But if Simpson waived his Miranda rights after talking to his attorney , trying to keep_out his statements is &quot; going_to be very hard in this case , &quot; said Bay Area defense_attorney Ted Cassman . Prosecutor Marcia Clark has said that Simpson gave all_the proper waivers . It is not yet known what Simpson told the police , but defense_attorneys say prosecutors could try to use any inconsistencies in his statements against him . The 911 Tapes Legal experts said the Simpson defense probably would have better luck in excluding the 911 tapes from the trial , an issue that could arise after the preliminary hearing . A judge would first have to decide whether the tapes were relevant to the murder_charges against Simpson , and secondly , whether their relevance was outweighed by the prejudice they would create against the defendant . Prior Evidence of Violence Even without the tapes , Simpson ' s alleged assaults against his former wife could be admitted into evidence . &quot; The courts have a great_deal of discretion , &quot; Brown said . Court rulings on admitting evidence of prior abuse in such cases have been divided . In a 1983 murder case , a state appellate_court held that evidence that a husband dragged his wife outside their home , sprayed her with a hose and yelled obscenities at her was irrelevant and inadmissible . The court said there was no close connection between the husband ' s previous action and the wife ' s death . But in another case three years later , a different state appellate_court held that a prior assault was admissible because it showed motive to kill and ill_will . Prior violence is generally admissible if it demonstrates that the defendant acted according to a common scheme or plan . For example , evidence that linked a defendant to a signature murder where a playing card was left on the victim could be used to buttress evidence against him in a nearly identical murder . &quot; But there is no common scheme or plan between an allegation of hitting during an argument and breaking_down the door , &quot; said an experienced San Diego criminal defense_lawyer , referring to two incidents that sparked Nicole Simpson ' s previous calls to the police . &quot; That is not even close to what we are talking_about in this case. &quot; The Controversy Over DNA Testing DNA evidence could also be problematic . Most courts in the country admit such genetic evidence but California ' s appellate_courts have been divided on the question and the California Supreme Court has not yet ruled on it . A Court of Appeal in San Francisco held two years ago that a critical part of DNA evidence -- the statistics showing the chance that someone other_than the defendant would have the same genetic profile -- was inadmissible . The court excluded the evidence on the grounds that scientists were in fundamental disagreement about the validity of statistical methods used by the FBI and a private testing lab in the case . In that case , the prosecution had relied_on a type of DNA testing that can take two to three months and produce powerful results that juries find hard to overlook . For instance , the test can determine that the chances of another person having that DNA is only one in several million . In a pending case , a state appellate_court is being asked to rule on the validity of a DNA testing method known as polymerase chain_reaction , or PCR . It can be done more quickly than the older method but does not purport to show such high odds against a similar match . No court in California has ruled on this method . Prosecutors say it is sound but some defense_attorneys are wary . Walter Krstulja , a senior trial_attorney and forensics expert in the Los Angeles public_defender ' s office , warns that PCR evidence can be unreliable because samples can easily be contaminated . &quot; The test appears very promising , &quot; he said , &quot; but issues of quality_control and contamination still have to be worked out. &quot; Alameda County prosecutor Rockne Harmon , who has often used DNA results in his cases , strongly believes that the testing methods and statistical analyses are sound . &quot; Trial_judges don ' t have much difficulty ruling this evidence admissible , &quot; Harmon said . &quot; It is just the appellate judges who seem to be balking. &quot; It is believed that prosecutors in the Simpson case are relying_on both methods as well as on conventional serology , a less rigorous blood testing procedure . Only serology tests will be introduced at the preliminary hearing . Ultimately , the admissibility of any DNA test results may boil_down to the credibility of the laboratory used by the prosecution and the statistical methods used to compute the odds of a match . Some attorneys predict that the prosecution will win any fight over DNA results because previous court rulings were based on methods that are no longer used .
