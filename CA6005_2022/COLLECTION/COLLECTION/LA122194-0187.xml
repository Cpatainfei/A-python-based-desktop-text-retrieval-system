   <HEADLINE> MEXICO DEVALUES PESO 15 % AS REVOLT FLARES UP ; ECONOMY : MOVE TO HEAD OFF DAMAGE FROM CHIAPAS UPRISING GETS MIXED REACTION . SOME FEAR A REKINDLING OF INFLATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Acknowledging that political instability threatens Mexico ' s hard-won economic rehabilitation , the government moved to devalue the peso by 15 % at dawn on Tuesday . The move rippled through the economy , recalling the 1976 and 1982 peso devaluations that sent Mexico into a tailspin . Whether this latest step leads to similar economic havoc will depend mainly on investor perception , observers said . The government ' s action also was being closely watched in the United States , especially in California and Texas , where border merchants rely heavily on the purchasing power of Mexicans and where hundreds of U.S. companies have dramatically ratcheted up their economic transactions with Mexico in the free-trade climate of the past year . In Washington , Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sought to calm concerns : &quot; Mexico ' s exchange_rate action today will support the healthy development of the Mexican economy . With a balanced_budget , continuing economic reform and prudent monetary policy , Mexico ' s fundamentals remain sound. &quot; In a 4 a.m. communique , the Mexican government blamed guerrillas in the southern state of Chiapas for the instability that made the devaluation necessary . The guerrillas announced Monday that they will no longer observe a cease-fire that has been in_effect since mid-January . But in addition to the potential instability , economists and investors said , the peso is under pressure for economic reasons , mainly a foreign trade_deficit that is widely regarded_as unsustainable and has been a major factor_in the stagnation of Mexico ' s economy . With the devaluation of the peso , Mexico ' s exports become cheaper and goods and services from other nations become more expensive , causing trade_deficits to shrink . The devaluation means more pesos are needed to equal one dollar , with the result that interest_rates -- which have been kept high in_order to attract foreign investments -- will decline and invigorate the Mexican economy . The danger , however , is a rekindling of inflation . &quot; It ' s purely an economic decision , &quot; said one institutional investor . But &quot; the timing is political . If you can paint the ( guerrillas ) as the cause , that ' s a pretty good mud ball. &quot; The Mexican Stock_Exchange Index rose 43.06 points -- 1.93 % -- on the news , although the prices of Mexican stocks traded_in the United States fell an average of 6 % . Devaluations generally raise stock prices as investors anticipate lower interest_rates , unless companies have dollar-denominated debt . Technically , the government widened by 53 centavos the band within which the peso trades . That means the currency -- which had been trading at 3.46 pesos to the dollar late Monday -- could drop as low as 4.00 , a devaluation of 15 % , before the central_bank intervenes to defend it . Foreign exchange desks were quoting the dollar at 3.89 pesos on Tuesday , but some banks were offering 4.00. Rumors of devaluation had been rampant since spring as the peso clung to the top of the trading band , a clear indication that the central_bank was drawing_on foreign reserves to defend the currency . Besides spending foreign reserves , the government also tried to offset the trade_deficit with foreign investment , attracting capital from abroad by keeping interest_rates high . That angered Mexican industrialists who must borrow at those high interest_rates to modernize their outmoded factories and compete internationally . Less than three weeks into the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo , it became clear that the monetary policy could not continue . Devaluation is a delicate issue in Mexico because previous administrations have depleted international reserves and brought the economy to the brink of collapse before dropping the peso ' s value . Some foreign stock investors said they were shaken by Tuesday ' s devaluation and unsure whether it was the right decision . Direct investors were more confident . &quot; We see this as a short-term event , &quot; said one U.S. banker based in Mexico . &quot; We had planned to invest $ 100 million in Mexico in the coming years , and we are not reducing our operations in the least bit. &quot; But U.S. retailers along the 2 # 000-mile U.S.-Mexico frontera -- many of whom depend_on border-crossing Mexican shoppers for their livelihoods -- will probably be hurt . Mark Torres , manager of Kragen Auto Parts store in San Ysidro , just across the border from Tijuana , said that although business was good on Tuesday , he expects the devaluation to hurt as the news sinks_in . &quot; Ninety percent of our business comes from over there . So whatever happens to them will affect me . Yes , I have to be worried. &quot; Meanwhile , the hundreds of U.S. manufacturers with plants in Mexico will benefit because the cost of labor and Mexican supplies will drop accordingly with the peso ' s loss of_value against the dollar , said Ed Brekke , president of the Western Maquiladora Trade Assn. , a group of some 240 foreign manufacturers with plants in Baja California . The degree of benefit will depend_on where those plants are situated and where their products are shipped , Brekke said . U.S. plants situated in Mexico ' s interior shipping products back to the Midwest , for example , will benefit most , because the cost of labor and supplies should fall according to the peso ' s loss of_value . But that benefit will be less pronounced for U.S. companies with plants close to the border , because the border economy is heavily dollar-oriented , Brekke said . In downtown Los Angeles , Jorge Sanchez , owner of the record store Discoteca Favorita , was happy about the peso drop , because it would help him save money when purchasing much of the Mexican music the store sells -- and because the $ 500 he sends monthly to his parents and siblings living_in Ensenada would go a little further . &quot; I can afford to send that money every month , and I ' ll keep sending what I can , &quot; Sanchez said . &quot; Just because the dollar is worth more doesn ' t mean that I ' ll send less. &quot; * Darling reported from Mexico_City and Kraul from San Diego .
