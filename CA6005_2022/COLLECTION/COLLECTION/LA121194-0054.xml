   <HEADLINE> CRITIC ' S PICK : ' SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This splendid 1993 release is set_in the world of chess , but it would n ' t be a fraction of the film it is if chess were all it is about . It is a story of childhood simultaneously exalted and at risk , of the demands of parenthood and the burdens of competition and of genius.It is also the most impressive and promising of directing debuts on the part of writer Stephen Zaillian , who won an Oscar for his adaptation of Thomas Keneally ' s &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; &quot; Bobby Fischer &quot; tells what happens when a typical New York City kid ( Max Pomeranc , pictured ) , who has dreams of playing second_base for the Yankees , discovers that he has so_much innate chess ability that he puts people in mind of that celebrated world champion of the film ' s title . Remarkably photographed by Conrad Hall ( Cinemax Friday at 8 p.m. ) . Kenneth Turan</TEXT>
