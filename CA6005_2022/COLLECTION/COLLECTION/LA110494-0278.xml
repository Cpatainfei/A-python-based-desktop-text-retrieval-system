   <HEADLINE> THIS CAR ' S A NATURAL ; A QUIET ARRIVAL -- ON ALTERNATIVE FUEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While electric_cars have caught the public ' s imagination , a wallflower -- the natural_gas car -- has quietly become the alternative-fuel vehicle that comes_closest to giving drivers the same experience they get with their gasoline-powered autos . In fact , the practical success of these vehicles -- which are expected to be widely used in polluted air basins such_as those of Southern California -- is one big reason why so many failed to notice their arrival . &quot; Natural_gas vehicles are almost too transparent to the users , &quot; says Stephanie Gott , editor of NGV News , an industry newsletter based in Tennessee . &quot; They look_like normal vehicles . There ' s not a lot of glitz and glamour out there. &quot; Yet both Chrysler Corp . and Ford Motor Co . now offer fully warranted trucks and vans -- and in the 1996 model year , Ford will offer a Crown Victoria car -- that run only on compressed natural_gas . Existing cars can also be converted to natural_gas for $ 2 # 500 or more . The Natural_Gas Vehicle Coalition estimates that 5 million natural_gas cars , trucks and vans will be_on U.S. highways by the year 2000 , rising to about 20 million by 2010 . And the gas utilities are gearing_up to deliver their fuel . Southern California Gas Co . and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co . have already installed 70 public and private fleet refueling facilities in Southern California , while the Gas Co . plans 600 more by the end of the century . The goal : that one in 10 service_stations have a natural_gas pump in place . In the largest private-sector fleet order for such vehicles in this country , Super Shuttle is converting its entire Los Angeles-area fleet of 145 vehicles to natural_gas . The new vans begin to arrive later this year . And as part of the $ 7-million deal with Boone Pickens ' Mesa Corp. , a Texas natural_gas concern , Pickens is building refueling stations at LAX and John Wayne Airport in Orange County to refuel the Super Shuttle fleet and serve the public . Critics ' early fears of explosive accidents have almost entirely subsided in the fledgling industry as fuel tanks have proven their safety . &quot; There really wasn ' t a problem to begin with , &quot; says Michael A . Mihelich , Chrysler technical liaison in engineering . &quot; Look_at today ' s vehicle . Gasoline is a very volatile substance . People take it for granted , but we ' re very diligent in our design to make gasoline vehicles safe. &quot; Safety questions arose when two tanks ruptured -- but did not ignite -- among 2 # 500 General Motors natural_gas pickup_trucks . GM is buying back all_the trucks , but the problem was traced to the installation design , not the fuel tanks themselves . Since then , the various tank designs have been subjected_to much more rigorous testing than gasoline_tanks -- including fending off gunshots and igniting a stick of dynamite next to the tank . &quot; They are about the strongest part of the vehicle , &quot; says Tom Barker , a Ford alternative-fuel program specialist . Meanwhile , sluggish acceleration and limited range have also been improved . Compressed natural_gas needs a lot more storage_room than does the gasoline to provide the equivalent amount of energy . This has forced the use of bulky , pressurized tanks that still couldn ' t store enough gas to give vehicles driving range equal_to gasoline cars . Now these tanks , which often reduced trunk space to glove-compartment size , are being redesigned and mostly tucked out of the way . Most of this progress is embodied in an advanced natural_gas car designed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , to be unveiled in Washington today . The $ 800 # 000 project was sponsored by the Department_of_Energy , the Gas Research Institute , Southern California Gas Co . and two East Coast utilities . The new vehicle , converted from a Geo Prism , applied natural_gas technology to a compact_car for the first time . &quot; One of our prime goals was to make_it indistinguishable from the gasoline-fuel automobile , &quot; says John J . Wozniak , project manager . In rethinking the car , the engineers did everything they could to keep_from losing trunk space to the tanks -- while adding enough fuel storage to expand the car ' s range . They redesigned the car ' s suspension to allow more room above the rear wheels . They also eliminated the spare tire and jack . Instead , the car runs_on four so-called run-flat tires , built by Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. , which developed the tires for the 1994 Corvette . The tires can be driven_up to 250 miles when flat , without incurring damage . In all , the team was able to save 75 % of the Prism ' s trunk space , and it hopes that further refinements will raise that to 85 % . In the meantime , while many natural_gas vehicles have only enough tank storage on board to give them a 125-to-150-mile range , the Johns Hopkins car can go 300 miles between fill-ups , nearly comparable_to modern gasoline-auto ranges of 240 to 375 miles . Tanks are also being developed that could be both immensely strong but could also conform_to the odd extra spaces inside a car , much as conventional gasoline_tanks do . Such tanks might be made of aluminum or composite_materials that were first developed for the aerospace industry . And farther down the research road , &quot; the Holy_Grail , probably pretty far off , is adsorption technology , &quot; says Christopher H . Norton , research project manager for the Gas Co . This would be a storage scheme in which gas was stored in a container of material such_as granulated carbon , which in theory would allow equal amounts of gas to be contained in the same space , but at much lower_pressure than the 3 # 000 pounds per square_inch used now . Lower gas pressure would allow_for lighter tanks , increasing range and energy efficiency . It would even save money on the refueling equipment , since it takes energy to compress the gas in the first place . Such improvements could have wide impact on the workaday lives of ordinary drivers , since far more natural_gas cars than electric vehicles are likely to be_on U.S. roads for decades to come , as manufacturers and fleet owners meet requirements of federal and state air-pollution laws . Natural_Gas Vehicles : Pros and Cons An improved version of the natural_gas vehicle , to be unveiled in Washington today , is expected to lessen or eliminate some drawbacks of the vehicles , including lingering worries about safe handling of the fuel . Still , practical differences remain between conventional gasoline autos and natural_gas vehicles . Some pros and cons of natural_gas vehicles : ADVANTAGES * Very low-polluting * Meets most state vehicle emissions standards * Uses abundant domestic fuel * Could be produced on standard assembly_line * Fuel cost per mile is currently only two-thirds that of gasoline DISADVANTAGES * Uses fossil , not renewable , fuel * Slightly heavier , lowering fuel efficiency and acceleration * Limited range * Less trunk space * Costs $ 2 # 000 to $ 4 # 500 more per vehicle * Few refueling locations</TEXT>
