   <HEADLINE> ROBERTI RECALL EMERGING AS CAMPAIGN OF PARADOXES ; ELECTION : THE LONGTIME LAWMAKER IS FIGHTING FOR HIS POLITICAL LIFE AT A TIME WHEN HE HAD PLANNED TO LEAVE IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After 27 years in the Legislature , 13 years as head of the Senate and some 25 occasions as acting governor , state Sen . David A . Roberti -- prodded by his wife , June -- had finally decided to bow_out of politics . Hadn ' t the people cast their votes against career politicians anyway , with term limits ? And hadn ' t running_for office changed a great_deal since 1966 , when civic-minded volunteers and $ 3.50-a-plate spaghetti fund-raisers first vaulted Roberti into the Capitol ? And so , late last year , the Van Nuys Democrat had reached the decision to forgo running_for higher office when his term expired in December . For the first time in practically three decades , Roberti was going_to lead a normal life . Go_home at night to his family , dabble_in historical research and maybe get a job with a bigger paycheck . Then something happened that made him so angry it changed his mind . A coalition including firearms rights advocates , upset over his assault weapon control legislation , got a recall election set against him for April 12 . &quot; I think they were stupid because I actually had him convinced to look_for something else . . . to go_into private life , get_out of public life , &quot; June Roberti , her husband ' s closest adviser , said in a recent interview . &quot; But the recall changed everything . We ' re in it now to the end. &quot; As his foes issued their &quot; throw-the-bum-out &quot; cry , Roberti upped the ante and tossed_in a bid for the state_treasurer ' s office , declaring that he will not be intimidated into retiring from politics . Thus , the first recall election of a state official since 1914 may be remembered as something of an oddity , based on a series of paradoxes : a man fighting for his political life at a time when the exit light had beckoned ; an election-turned-referendum on an assault weapon ban that falls_short_of perfection ; a slick anti-recall campaign that skirts the issue of whether the senator has done a good job . Friends in the Capitol say it is typical of Roberti , a naturally introverted man , to step_out of his shell when challenged to protect his legacy . They say he desperately wants to avoid ending his long career as the victim of a recall effort . &quot; You can ' t turn your back on these people , &quot; Roberti said of the opponents he openly calls &quot; cuckoos &quot; or &quot; nut cases &quot; for the intensity of their Second Amendment rights views . &quot; Otherwise , you turn your back on a career of 27 years , you turn your back on your life. &quot; But recall proponents are quick to point_out that 46 # 000 registered voters who signed their petitions apparently agree that Roberti has served too long in the Legislature . &quot; No one has questioned Mr. Roberti ' s intelligence , &quot; said Kevin Washburn , manager of the recall campaign . &quot; What we are saying is he presided over the Senate at a time of the worst corruption of the democratic system in California history . And the people of this district are entitled to their democratic rights to recall him. &quot; By now , the senator ' s strategy is apparent : deny that this is about Roberti the officeholder , and define the election as retaliation for his legislation to ban assault weapons . While that tells part of the story , Roberti ' s own rhetoric shrinks away from his record or what he stands_for ( &quot; You don ' t have to like Senator David Roberti . . . &quot; says one campaign brochure urging a vote against the recall. ) &quot; I really don ' t view it as an election about me , &quot; Roberti said in an interview . &quot; If David Roberti were somebody else who had been able to do this ( pass gun_control laws ) , they ' d be_on their case. &quot; Regardless of the underlying issues , a simple question will appear , in less than two weeks , on the ballot : &quot; Should David Roberti be recalled ( removed ) from the office of State_Senator ? &quot; To answer that question , voters will have to determine just who is this man who burst onto the San Fernando Valley political scene in 1992 , renting a Van Nuys duplex to set_up residency after a quarter-century of representing Hollywood ? Capitol observers sum_up Roberti , 54 , as an adroit politician , one who shrewdly negotiates trade-offs -- if need be -- to further his agenda . And his sharp survival skills enable him to hone in on defining issues in the district , such_as the Los Angeles Unified School District breakup movement in the Valley , which he championed . He has a track record of successful fund raising , collecting hefty donations over the years from labor_unions , law_enforcement groups , the California Teachers Assn. , applicant attorneys , trial_lawyers and large corporations such_as Arco and Chevron . His ideology , he says , revolves_around his belief that government has a responsibility to help people so they can eventually help themselves . &quot; I guess I gravitate toward the have-nots , the people who need somebody to fight for them , &quot; Roberti said , noting , however , that , &quot; I think we make an error if we patronize anybody who thinks they are always right because of their condition , rather than the justice of their cause. &quot; Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) , who succeeded Roberti in January as leader of the upper house , describes his predecessor as adept at forging the kinds of compromises that keep the wheels of state_government churning . When it comes_to the recall , &quot; People tend to focus_on guns , &quot; Lockyer said , &quot; but I tend to see him in a different way . If there ' s an overarching philosophy , it ' s his sympathy for the underdog. &quot; Republicans in the Senate view the Roberti legacy in a more harsh light . &quot; He strikes me as having been a typical liberal Democratic legislative leader , &quot; said Sen . Bill Leonard ( R-Upland ) . &quot; He has blocked legislation that would have helped California ' s job situation over the years -- in tort law , environmental law , business regulation and taxation. &quot; Leonard described Roberti as a master manipulator when it came_to influencing whether a bill would pass or fail . &quot; Because of David Roberti ' s personality and dominance . . . he would stack committees to his interest and then guide particular bills to those committees , &quot; he said . But , he added , &quot; I certainly respect his legislative skills. &quot; But if Roberti has a reputation among Republicans as a die-hard liberal , one notable departure from that stereotype is his anti-abortion rights position , stemming from his Catholic upbringing . These days , the short and stout Roberti attends a lot of news_conferences , often posing with the AR 15s and Colt Sporters that his gun_control legislation targets . The image belies his reputation as a soft_touch for animals , one of his most passionate issues . He is no less than a hero to animal rights activists such_as &quot; Police Story &quot; actor Earl Holliman , who says of Roberti , &quot; He really cares . He ' s a very sensitive man. &quot; He is similarly praised by stage actress Gretchen Wyler , a friend who said she has seen him grow teary-eyed over the loss of a pet cat . Roberti ' s staff hands_out a laundry list of his accomplishments that include not only animal rights legislation but new laws to aid low-income tenants , increase criminal penalties for sexual abusers of children , restrict landfill disposal of hazardous waste and fund urban parks , AIDS and latchkey children ' s programs . He is also pushing state Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren to use the authority given him by the 1989 Assault Weapons Control Act to ban so-called copycat firearms . Gun manufacturers are getting_around Roberti ' s five-year-old law by making identical weapons under different names from those identified by the ban . Years ago , military weapons were also at the heart of Roberti ' s issues when he first ran_for Assembly in 1966 , championing an anti-Vietnam War platform while walking precincts with his then-fiancee , June . The couple met at the Young Democratic Club in Hollywood after Roberti ' s union-label family abandoned membership in the GOP because , he said , &quot; the Republican_Party was no longer a home for working people. &quot; One of two sons of a tailor who sewed costumes for the movies , Roberti figures he was drawn to politics because current events were always a topic of conversation in his parents ' home . Though his mother , Elvira , saw_to_it that the boys took voice , piano and tap-dancing lessons , Hollywood was never a calling for Roberti or his older brother -- both of whom grew_up to become lawyers . A bigger influence on Roberti ' s young life was his Italian heritage , which he notes was a target of prejudice and scorn during the World_War_II era . In fact , when Roberti was born a 13-pound baby , his birth_certificate had listed his parents ' name as &quot; Roberts. &quot; &quot; He ' s very , very Italian , &quot; said Los Angeles Superior_Court Judge John Farrell , a former high_school classmate . &quot; He ' s very proud_of it , but in growing_up , I know he felt some discrimination because of it. &quot; Farrell ' s recollection of early Roberti campaign events is of low-budget , warm , family-style atmospheres in which Emil ( Papa ) Roberti strummed the mandolin and his wife cooked stew or spaghetti for a house full of volunteers . Today , Roberti ' s ability to raise huge amounts of campaign funds has reached legendary proportions , although the money flow has dried_up some since he gave_up his Senate leadership post , a cash_cow in California politics . Roberti spent more_than $ 2 million to win the 20th Senate District in a 1992 special election , garnering 43 % of the vote . He estimates that he will have to spend $ 750 # 000 to defeat the recall movement , led by activists with far less cash on_hand . It was money that ended_up corrupting the three lieutenants Roberti placed in positions of power in the Senate -- former Sens . Alan Robbins , Joseph Montoya and Paul Carpenter , all_of whom were convicted of using their offices to extort cash from people seeking legislative favors . By association , this has reflected poorly on Roberti and has emerged as a hot theme in the recall debate . Says Washburn , &quot; We ' re not trying to prosecute Mr. Roberti . We ' re saying there is political accountability . It happened on his watch , and either he knew what was going_on and failed to stop it , or he didn ' t know what was going_on and he was incompetent. &quot; Roberti says he was unaware of his colleagues ' criminal activities . &quot; The best thing I can say is , Alan Robbins represented the 20th District for 18 years , and there was never a recall against him . I don ' t have to get_into Alan ' s problems , except to say they were multiple -- and nobody , but nobody , has accused me of any wrongdoing. &quot; That it is he , not Robbins , who ended_up on the receiving end of a vigorous recall effort is an irony that leaves Roberti stinging . &quot; I ' m a human_being . And human_beings , they feel sorry_for themselves sometimes , &quot; Roberti said . &quot; Why should I have to go_through this ? &quot; Many of Roberti ' s fellow lawmakers , unnerved by the mere thought of a recall , are circling the wagons and refusing to criticize the senator in his moment of vulnerability . Some observe that the triple duties of performing legislative work , running a treasurer ' s campaign and attempting to defeat the recall appear to be taking a toll . &quot; My sense of it is that he has moments of both depression and determination , &quot; Lockyer said . &quot; There ' s times when he feels , ' Why me ? This is unfair. ' And other times when he is determined to prove that these cranks can ' t destroy him . I see him both ways -- probably depending_on whether it ' s the second hour of the day , or the 15th hour. &quot; June Roberti acknowledges that her husband gets physically tired . But , she says , &quot; I think he has the fighting spirit more_than he has the low spirit . &quot; Maybe he feels sorry_for himself a little bit , but he doesn ' t get_away with that at home. &quot; Home is a spacious , two-story Tudor-style house in Los Feliz , where Roberti ' s father , now 90 , lives in the care of his daughter-in-law . His opponents charge Roberti is a carpetbagger , and the senator does not try to hide the fact that he doesn ' t reside in the California bungalow-style duplex the Robertis rent on Hamlin Street in Van Nuys . June Roberti says she stayed there for a short while after her husband won the Valley Senate seat , but grew anxious because of threatening notices that she said were left at the front_door by people she assumes were firearms rights activists . Roberti said he lives_in Los Feliz to be with his father , whom he does not want to move at his advanced age . He says he uses the Hamlin Street house as an office , a place to put_up his feet while getting some work done and unwinding from the stresses of public life . There is a theory circulating among Roberti ' s supporters that , even if he loses his seat , he ' ll benefit in the treasurer ' s race from the higher visibility brought_on by battling the National Rifle Assn. , one of the groups supporting the recall . &quot; I went_to Catholic_school . Martyrdom was always the highest calling , &quot; Roberti said . &quot; But I never aspired to it . I always thought there were less drastic ways to achieve an objective. &quot; Meanwhile , critics label Roberti an opportunist for running a crossover campaign that suggests his authorship of assault weapon laws would boost his ability as state_treasurer . A Roberti-for-treasurer campaign sign , for example , sports a fire-engine red bull ' s-eye for the &quot; o &quot; in his name , underlined with the words &quot; The Man Who Banned Assault Weapons. &quot; State Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) says of Roberti , &quot; If he survives the recall , he will be known as the guy who fought the NRA and automatic weapons . But gun_control is not something the state_treasurer can do something about. &quot; If he loses both election bids , Roberti said , he may well become a &quot; personality &quot; in the growing national movement to limit assault weapon distribution . But he does not sound crushed at the thought of someday being_on the outside looking in : &quot; What I love about politics is what will happen when it ' s all_over . I ' ll be David Roberti , private citizen . And I think I will be able to look_back and say , hey , ' I was able to do -- with the help of my people -- this , this and this. ' &quot;</TEXT>
