   <TEXT> Chris Boyatzis , an assistant_professor of child development at Cal State Fullerton , may be a vociferous critic of children ' s television , but he isn ' t naive . He ' s talked with hundreds of parents concerned about children ' s television consumption.Here are some of his and their best tips . * Don ' t just watch , think . One parent allowed a child to watch the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles only if the child imagined another turtle into the story -- a turtle named Gandhi who resolved the same plot without fighting . * Ask children to count the number of violent actions in a single episode . They ' ll probably lose count . * Permit the favorite shows as long as the fighting isn ' t imitated . * Put kids on a TV diet . Let them watch a favorite show once or twice a week , but not daily . * Finally , watch television with the kids so you can guide discussions and help children develop critical thinking about what they see , including commercials .
