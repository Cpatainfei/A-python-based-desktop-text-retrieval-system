   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEWS ; AMICO AT ACE : ' C ' -ING ISN ' T EVERYTHING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> David Amico ' s abstract paintings at Ace Contemporary Exhibitions read like snappy , graphic designs . Their crisp , simplified images have the impact of smartly laid-out pages in hip magazines . Although paintings are usually thought of as being composed , it ' s more accurate to see Amico ' s 12 large works as having been arranged . Each letter , stripe and field seems to have been made elsewhere and then placed on a vertical canvas . It ' s not difficult to imagine the artist in his studio , shuffling prototypes until the right look is achieved . Amico ' s use of paint adds_to this impression . Palpable sections of bright colors appear to have been applied with a trowel and then smoothed into dense layers that bury whatever was beneath them . The edges of these elements show_off the paint ' s thickness and make each part of the picture look_like a substantial object that has been cemented to the surface . The letters &quot; C &quot; and &quot; U &quot; frequently recur . Sometimes tipped on their sides , reversed , turned upside-down or cut_in half by the paintings ' edges , these two letters , in various typefaces , are also distended or compressed . They function visually and phonetically . As emblems , they invite comparison with monograms , logos or the copyright symbol . As statements , they demand to be sounded_out . With great economy , Amico ' s paintings inquire : &quot; You see ? &quot; Or exclaim : &quot; See . You see ! &quot; Or bid farewell : &quot; See you. &quot; These clever captions literally describe the conversation-like exchanges that take_place whenever viewers look_at art . Unfortunately , the paintings in which they appear don ' t resonate much longer than it takes_to read them . Amico ' s witty ideograms lack the inarticulate power and stubborn mystery of his previously speechless works . * Ace Contemporary Exhibitions , 5514 Wilshire Blvd. , ( 213 ) 935-4411 , through Sept . 17 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . Pleasant Glimpse : A modest sampling of collages , drawings and monoprints by Claude Bentley ( 1915-1990 ) at Boritzer / Gray / Hamano Gallery presents a pleasant glimpse of this little-known artist ' s works_on paper . Spanning the 1980s , these intimately scaled pieces are playful refinements of a formal vocabulary the Chicago-based abstract painter developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s , alongside the more famous , New York-based Abstract Expressionists . Bentley ' s collages consist_of carefully torn_sheets of brightly colored paper , bits of burlap , old envelopes and an occasional wine label . They are light-handed and lyrical and sometimes approach a state of weightlessness . The most recent ones appear to be drifting apart . The solid , architectural forms that once stood_in the center of Bentley ' s compositions begin to disperse , as if centrifugal_force is scattering them outward . Bentley ' s collages are more delicate , tenuous and fragile than those of Emerson Woelffer , a slightly more well-known abstract painter who also makes collages and was born in Chicago a year before Bentley . In contrast to Woelffer ' s bold , simplified and sometimes disruptive compositions , Bentley ' s collages look almost mannered . They willingly accept the conventions of collage and are content to refine its limited set of formal issues . Their slight , visual pleasures are wholly traditional . * Boritzer / Gray / Hamano Gallery , 1001-B Colorado Ave. , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 394-6652 , through July 23 . Closed Sundays and Mondays .</TEXT>
