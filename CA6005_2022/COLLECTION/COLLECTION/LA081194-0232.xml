   <HEADLINE> FRENCH TROOPS EDGY AS THEY PULL_OUT OF RWANDA ; AFRICA : SOLDIERS ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER ANOTHER HUGE REFUGEE EXODUS COULD FOLLOW THEIR DEPARTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> French soldiers protecting an estimated 1.2 million panicky Rwandans continued their pullout from this tortured African_country Wednesday , still uncertain whether another colossal refugee stampede is developing . French commanders , who have already cut their force by about half , pressed ahead with their plan for a complete withdrawal from their security zone in southwestern Rwanda by Aug . 22 , although there are broad appeals for their troops to remain . A few hundred French troops now provide a shield that keeps a giant mass of Hutus from bolting across the border into Zaire . At worst , such a flight could rival the tragedy of Hutus who have already crossed the border farther north in one of the deadliest refugee movements in modern times . &quot; It is very difficult to predict the reaction of large crowds . And they are gathering_in the camps here every day . The psychology of this can go very quickly , &quot; said French Marine Col . Erik de Stabenrath , commander of this zone . If Hutus rush across the border to Bukavu , Zaire , in coming days , they face conditions hardly better than the disease and despair that greeted the 1 million or so Rwandan refugees who went_into Goma , Zaire , last month . &quot; It cannot happen again -- it simply cannot happen because it is too horrible to happen , &quot; pleaded Ray Wilkinson , spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees . But if the Hutus stay_put , their future may_not be so bright either . Perhaps 1 million of the Hutus here already are refugees from other parts of the country , and what awaits them -- sooner or later -- is yet another bloody chapter in their death struggle for ethnic revenge , the_French say . The Hutus once were the overwhelming majority in this small , mountainous country . They lost a civil_war last month to a Tutsi-controlled rebel army . The invading Tutsi themselves were primarily refugees who grew_up in Uganda after an earlier round of Rwandan ethnic struggle . But more_than a backdrop to civil_war , Rwanda in 1994 turned_into a human slaughterhouse . Before losing and leaving , Hutus rampaged across the land and murdered eight of 10 Tutsi civilians , according to estimates here . &quot; In one sector north of here , there were 13 # 400 Tutsi in April . Only 200 were left alive , &quot; said De Stabenrath . For that very convincing reason , the Hutus fear being left unprotected against the vengeance that is the history of Rwanda . &quot; We can cope_with disease -- ( but ) the Tutsi soldiers will kill us for_sure , &quot; said Venuste Hakizimana , 25 , a Hutu teacher . &quot; If the_French leave , who will protect us ? We are wondering : ' Can we stay ? Or should we go ? ' I talk_about this a great_deal with my friends . We have decided if the_French leave , we will leave. &quot; Hakizimana says he set himself a Sunday deadline . After that , he said , he will begin the five-day march from Gikongoro over a steep mountain road to reach Zaire before the last of the_French soldiers go_home . African troops of the United Nations already are moving_into the region to try to maintain a shield for the Hutus . But neither African soldiers nor the United Nations is widely trusted here . For the short run , De Stabenrath said he hopes that African troops can establish credibility with Rwandan Hutus quickly . Already , one part of the_French zone has been turned_over to troops from Ghana . Soldiers from Chad arrived Wednesday . &quot; And the mass exodus of refugees that was predicted did not materialize , &quot; the colonel said . If the U.N. troops can maintain the Hutus ' trust , the_French will have breathing room to make their exit and not be blamed for another refugee exodus . But even so , De Stabenrath said his dealings with the Rwandans leave him pessimistic about their future . &quot; Hutus here are talking_about revenge for the revenge they expect will be taken_on them , &quot; he said . &quot; I talked to one Hutu man , &quot; he noted , &quot; who was forced to bury his ( Tutsi ) wife alive . She was in the grave and he was shoveling dirt onto her and they were praying together . Things in this place are beyond comprehension. &quot; The French are arranging talks between an appointed council of Hutu leaders and officials of the Tutsi-controlled Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) . The country ' s new leaders have said the Hutus are free to return and will not be subject_to government persecution -- except those who were guilty of massacres of helpless Tutsi civilians . Twice , so far , a Hutu council has met with the RPF at a site across the border from the French-controlled sector . As a result , De Stabenrath said he senses increased confidence on the part of the Hutus . Now the_French are negotiating to bring RPF officials into the French-occupied zone to meet , face to face , with the anxious Hutus here . &quot; I think that will do a lot of good for the population , &quot; De Stabenrath said .</TEXT>
