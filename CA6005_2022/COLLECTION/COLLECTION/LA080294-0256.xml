   <HEADLINE> THE HUBER MURDER CASE ; ARIZONA DROPS FAMALARO CHARGES ; COURTS : ACTION COMES AS ORANGE COUNTY AUTHORITIES PREPARE TO TAKE_OVER THE DENISE HUBER SLAYING CASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hours after John J . Famalaro was arraigned Monday on charges that he killed Denise Huber and stored her body in a freezer in a stolen rental truck , Arizona prosecutors dropped the murder_charge as Orange County authorities prepared to take_over the case . Famalaro , a 37-year-old handyman and house_painter , is being held without bail here in Yavapai County Jail pending his extradition to Orange County , where he faces charges of the first-degree murder and kidnaping of Huber , a 23-year-old Newport Beach woman who disappeared three years ago after attending a rock_concert . He could be eligible for the death_penalty if convicted . Huber ' s body was transported Monday from Phoenix to Herreid , S.D. , where she was to be buried today . Also on Monday , Famalaro provided court-ordered samples of his blood , saliva , hair and handwriting to prosecutors . Yavapai County Deputy Counsel Thomas B . Lindberg said his office dismissed the murder_charge without prejudice so it could be refiled in the future , if necessary . Lindberg said his office was retaining a felony charge of possession of a stolen vehicle against Famalaro so that the defendant would remain in custody in the unlikely event that he successfully fights extradition . That felony charge carries a maximum sentence of about 11 years , Lindberg said . Famalaro is accused of stealing the Ryder rental truck in which the freezer bearing Huber ' s body was being stored . Famalaro chose not to appear at his arraignment Monday morning to avoid the media attention that has been swirling around the case , according to his Arizona defense_attorney , Thomas K . Kelly . In his absence , Yavapai Superior_Court Judge Raymond W . Weaver Jr . announced that Famalaro had entered a not-guilty plea and waived the reading of the indictment against him , then set a trial date for Sept . 28 . But that Arizona trial is unlikely to occur , since Orange County prosecutors have already set the extradition process in motion . Orange County Deputy Dist . Atty . John D . Conley said his office will probably forward paperwork this week asking Gov . Pete Wilson to request Famalaro ' s extradition . Upon Wilson ' s request , Arizona Gov . Fife Symington can issue a warrant forcing Famalaro ' s transfer to California . &quot; The best scenario , if everything is ( express_mailed ) and walked through , we could have it done_in a month , &quot; Conley said . &quot; We ' re going to shoot_for that month , but it ' s not a crisis , it ' s not do or die . We can ' t guarantee that Gov . Wilson will clean off his desk or that the Arizona governor will clean off his desk . It ' s like the airport , some people get there ahead of you. &quot; Extradition could occur even sooner if Famalaro chooses not to fight it , a decision his attorneys said would be announced within about a week . Arraignment on the Orange County charges and other procedural matters will begin only upon Famalaro ' s arrival , Conley said . He added that his office is not seeking an indictment by the Orange County Grand_Jury against Famalaro but has not ruled_out that possibility . After Famalaro ' s Arizona arraignment Monday morning , Lindberg expressed some regret at saying goodby to the gruesome , bizarre case . &quot; It would be an interesting case to prosecute and a challenging case , and I would n ' t mind that , &quot; he said . &quot; My wife says she ' s planning a trip to California about whatever time the trial goes_on , &quot; Lindberg said , adding that Orange County Deputy Dist . Atty . Chris Evans &quot; said he ' d save me a seat. &quot;</TEXT>
