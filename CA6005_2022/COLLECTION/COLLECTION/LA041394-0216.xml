   <TEXT> United Parcel Builds a Better Bar_Code : Bar_codes have become a fact of life . Just ask former President George_Bush , whose astonishment at seeing a supermarket checkout scanner helped sink his 1992 reelection bid . A few years ago , United Parcel Service set_out to build a better bar_code . What the delivery service company came_up with is MaxiCode , which packs a load of information in little more_than the space of a thumbnail . A traditional bar_code used by UPS for tracking packages fits 18 characters of information in 3.5 square_inches . By contrast , MaxiCode crams 100 bits of information into a square_inch . And , unlike the old bar_codes , if a piece of MaxiCode is torn_off , the missing information can be quickly re-created by computer . UPS also developed an overhead reader that deciphers the new code at ultra-high speeds as packages move along a conveyor_belt . A computer then routes the packages for shipping . The company began using the MaxiCode system at a new Michigan facility last year , and plans are_on for a plant near Chicago next year . UPS eventually wants to use MaxiCode throughout its system , and it is making the new code available to other companies . Project engineer Earle Timothy said the savings in paper alone will pay_for the investment and that UPS service will improve dramatically . &quot; A package will have a personality rather than just an ID , &quot; Timothy said . &quot; It will tell us things about itself. &quot; Service Lets You Buy by Wire : Attention , cyberspace shoppers . Looking_for a hard-to-find capacitor ? Want to get_the_best price on pencils ? These days , some corporate and government buyers need look no further than their electronic_mail . Thanks to an automated brokerage system developed by USC ' s Information_Sciences Institute in Marina del Rey , finding and ordering products has been reduced to the push of a button -- well , several buttons . The system , called Fast , was started in 1987 and has picked_up speed in the past two years . More_than 130 customers -- including large entities such_as General Electric Co. , the Department_of_Defense and universities -- have purchased more_than $ 7 million worth of goods through Fast . Here ' s how it works : A customer in search of a particular product sends an e-mail message to Fast via the Internet computer_network . The Fast computer_screens its database to determine which of the 2 # 700 vendors in its system carry the product , then sends those vendors e-mail or faxed requests . Fast can even directly access some vendors ' inventory databases to find_out if they have the item in_stock , its price and the estimated shipping date . It then relays the information to the customer , who orders through Fast . The entire transaction can take less than 10 minutes , or sometimes as much as a day . A buyer can also tailor a product request -- by asking Fast to find the lowest price , for instance . Fast then places the order automatically and sends the customer a confirmation . Payment also goes_through Fast , which follows up_to ensure that the product was shipped on_time . Fast charges the buyer an 8 % fee . Location Beacon Caters to At-Risk Execs : Executives traveling abroad have a lot more to worry about these days than exchange_rates and wrinkled shirts . Kidnaping , for instance . that ' s why the London-based Counter Spy Shop developed the WanderCare personal location beacon . While location devices have been around for about 30 years , this gadget would make Maxwell Smart jealous . The tiny ( less than two ounces ) beacon can be slipped_in a pocket or fitted_in a shoe , an eyeglass case . . . even a pen . The beacon emits a personalized digital beam that is picked_up by a receiver connected to a laptop_computer . The signal has a range of 15 miles and can pinpoint the location of the person carrying the beacon to within an inch . The computer can be programmed to track distance and direction and , if necessary , notify local authorities . The product has been_on the market for six months . Tom Felice , manager of the Counter Spy Shop in New York , said he sells about six a month for $ 3 # 800 to $ 9 # 400 each , depending_on the degree of customization required . The Counter Spy Shop in Beverly Hills figures it sells three a month . Felice doesn ' t know of any specific instance in which a kidnaping plot was foiled by the locater beacon . And he concedes that the device would n ' t do much good if someone were strip-searched . However , the beacon includes a panic button that alerts the person manning the receiver that danger may be imminent . What ' s next ? A beacon device that can be inserted under the skin , Felice says . Software Escrow Safeguards Source_Code : When companies buy software , they ' re often buying a relationship . Software users need support and programs need upgrading and customizing . But if the software developer goes_out of business , the crucial &quot; source_code &quot; for the software might suddenly become unavailable . Enter the software escrow company . Like real_estate escrow firms , these outfits serve as neutral third_parties , keeping the developer ' s proprietary source_code -- the guts of a program , through which upgrades , enhancements and corrections are made -- under lock and key . If the developer goes bankrupt or fails to provide the agreed-upon service , the source_code is released to the licensee . Many businesses simply use their attorneys or banks for this role , but software escrow companies say they can do more . One such firm , San Francisco-based SourceFile , charges companies that license software from developers $ 1 # 000 a year , for which it fashions an agreement between the two parties , stores the source_code in underground , climate-controlled vaults and makes_sure the code is kept current with the latest revisions .
