   <HEADLINE> UNWELCOME VISITOR AT VALLEY ' S EDGE ; WILDLIFE : MOUNTAIN_LIONS ARE BEING SIGHTED MORE FREQUENTLY . SOMETIMES-TRAGIC ENCOUNTERS ACROSS THE STATE ARE RENEWING DEBATE OVER MANAGING THE POPULATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s fast and silent and kills its prey by slicing its fangs between the neck_bones , snapping the spinal_cord . And it ' s not , as you might think , confined to a distant and inaccessible wilderness . With increasing frequency , North_America ' s most efficient four-legged killer , the mountain_lion , is prowling areas that human_beings think_of as their domain : suburban neighborhoods , urban open spaces , sometimes even the shopping_mall . Just last month , two 12-year-old boys came_upon a mountain_lion in a canyon behind their Granada Hills homes . Days later , police_officers shot one that wandered into a shopping_mall in Montclair . After years in which the big_cats were presumed_to have vanished from the mountainous fringes of Los Angeles , animal officials are increasingly finding signs of a resurgent population throughout the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains , the Santa Susanas and even in the city-locked Santa Monica Mountains , where remains of deer killed by lions have been found amid the homes of Encino . &quot; I ' m getting more complaints during the past 12 months than I have ever had , &quot; said Dennis Kroeplin , San Fernando Valley wildlife specialist for the Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation . Kroeplin says he has confirmed 14 reported sightings in the Valley during that time by either spotting the lion himself or identifying the paw prints left_behind . Across the state , face-to-face encounters are_on the rise too , and that trend -- brought into horrifying focus by the fatal attack on a Sacramento jogger in April -- has renewed a decades-old debate over man ' s proper relationship with the large predators . Hunters and livestock interests attribute the recent spate of attacks on humans to a ban on mountain_lion hunting that has been in_effect in California , one way or another , since 1971 . They argue that it is time to resume hunting in_order to reduce the overcrowding , which they blame for forcing the animals into areas where they encounter humans . &quot; I think the attacks speak_for themselves , &quot; said Paige Lewis , director of communications for the Wildlife Legislative Fund for America , a hunters ' lobbying group . &quot; The incidents are going_to continue to rise until people realize there is just not enough habitat to support that wildlife. &quot; But while they acknowledge that lion-human contacts are rising , many animal-rights activists and wildlife biologists nonetheless characterize the risks as an acceptable price for preserving the wildest of the wild . To minimize the hazards , they advocate programs to teach defensive behavior to those who live or vacation in mountain_lion country , although they do not object to trapping or killing individual animals that threaten people or livestock . At the same time , they adamantly draw_the_line at sport hunting , which is usually done with packs of dogs that track and tree the lion , allowing the_hunter to shoot it at close range . &quot; We just don ' t think that is a proper use of wildlife heritage in this day and age , &quot; said Mark Palmer , executive_director of the Mountain_Lion Foundation , which was formed by environmental groups in 1986 to support Prop . 117 , the 1990 state initiative that prohibits mountain_lion hunting . The voters in_effect endorsed a hunting moratorium originally imposed by the Legislature in 1971 , bringing the public ' s evolving attitude toward large predators full circle . To California ' s early settlers , the mountain_lion -- also called cougar , puma , panther , painter and catamount -- was just a dangerous varmint . &quot; They were competitors for deer and competitors for livestock , &quot; said wildlife biologist Paul Beier , a mountain_lion specialist in Northern Arizona University ' s Forestry Department . &quot; There wasn ' t a whole_lot of thought in it . You saw a predator and you shot it. &quot; Early in this century , California made eradication a policy , offering bounties and sending four state hunters into the field to kill mountain_lions . The effect of the persecution remains a matter of conjecture because no scientific lion census was done until 1971 . One estimate set the California population at only 600 in 1920 . Beier , though an advocate of protection , now doubts that the mountain_lion was ever that close to extinction . &quot; They ' re very durable , &quot; he said . &quot; If there ' s a_few of them out there in the wilderness , they ' ll find each other and have cubs. &quot; It ' s undisputed that the mountain_lion has rebounded since state hunting was discontinued in 1959 and the bounty system dropped_in 1963 . From an estimate of 2 # 100 in the state Fish and Game Department ' s first formal count in 1971 , mountain_lions now number as_many as 6 # 000 . California ' s experience is part of a mountain_lion comeback across the western United States and Canada . Once ranging all_over North_America below the Arctic_Circle , the largest of the purring cats -- as opposed to the larger roaring cats of Asia and Africa , like lions and tigers -- was squeezed into the states west of the Rockies by encroaching settlers in the 19th Century and their numbers so reduced that they were rarely spotted by people , even in the wild . Now , however , some researchers have said there may be more mountain_lions on_the_loose in the western states than there were in frontier days . While the population boom is still being researched by wildlife biologists , the causes of the recent increase in conflicts between mountain_lions and humans is fiercely debated by conservationists and hunters . Animal-welfare activists focus_on the continued spread of suburban development into previously wild areas and the popularity of hiking and camping . &quot; Our ever-expanding encroachment makes_it very difficult for an animal to make a living_out there , &quot; said Martine Collette , founder of the Wildlife Waystation in Little Tujunga Canyon , an animal refuge where about 30 mountain_lions are lodged , some of them pets that got too big for their owners and some wild animals trapped in cities . &quot; They ' re being pressured , so they ' ve opted to live right next door to you. &quot; Sportsmen fume at what they see as the emotionalism of that analysis . &quot; When 117 passed , we knew there were going_to be problems in the future , &quot; said Dan Heal , a bow-and-arrow hunter from Chico , Calif. , and chairman of the California Sportsmen ' s Task_Force . &quot; We forecast right then that if you don ' t manage a population , it ' s going_to overflow its range. &quot; Hunters argue that mountain_lion habitat is already taken_up by solitary adult_males who command up_to 100 square_miles of territory each . Younger males are forced to look elsewhere for a home , often ending_up on the undesirable fringes of the wild lands -- sometimes foraging right into the edge of growing suburbs . A managed hunt , sportsmen say , would clear_out territories for the young lions , keeping them in the wild and coincidentally generating revenue from license fees with which the state could pay_for research to further protect the species . But wildlife biologists contend there is no evidence of a correlation between hunting and human safety . California is the only state where no hunting is allowed , but other states have just as_many lion attacks on humans , they say . &quot; All of the attacks in California have occurred in regional or state parks where you don ' t allow hunting anyway , &quot; said Palmer of the Mountain_Lion Foundation . Shy by nature and trained from infancy to hunt four-legged creatures , the big_cats account_for fewer injuries to people than lightning . Only seven attacks on human_beings have been documented in California during this century , state game officials say . But the acceleration of the rate of those encounters , and the terror they cause , has given the issue new prominence . Six of the seven attacks have occurred since 1986 , and four involved children . A boy and a girl were mauled that year in an Orange County park . A 1992 attack in Santa Barbara County and a 1993 attack in San Diego County left two boys slightly injured . Most recently , a woman apparently saved her husband ' s life in late August by slaying a rabid mountain_lion with a kitchen knife when it attacked a group of campers near San Rios in Mendocino County , biting_off her husband ' s thumb . California ' s first documented mountain_lion fatality occurred in April when Barbara Schoener , a 40-year-old mother of two , was killed while jogging in a wilderness area near Sacramento . Her body was partly eaten by a female mountain_lion , who was later tracked_down and killed . Experts speculated that Schoener ran past the hidden cat , stimulating its chase instinct , like a ball of yarn rolled in front of a house_cat . Schoener ' s death sparked her hometown legislator , Assemblyman David Knowles ( R-Cameron Park ) , to introduce a bill aimed at repealing the 25-year-old ban on hunting . &quot; What we are saying is the current law is emotional . It doesn ' t give any possibility for scientific evidence to be used , &quot; said Kevin Brown , an aide to Knowles . &quot; We want to return responsibility for managing the mountain_lion population to Fish and Game. &quot; The bill aroused widespread opposition from conservationists , not only because they are repelled by hunting but because it would also have abolished a land-acquisition fund that has steered millions of dollars into buying wildlife habitat , including $ 50 million worth in the Santa Monica Mountains . An Assembly committee killed it on a party-line vote , Republicans for and Democrats opposed . Fuming over the failure of the bill , Heal of the Sportsmen ' s Task_Force predicted that &quot; it ' s just a matter of time before some child is taken and then we ' re going to see the problem finished. &quot; Caught in the middle of these rhetorical salvos are agencies such_as the Department of Animal Regulation in Los Angeles and the state Fish and Game Department , charged with protecting wild animals as well as the public . Facing the condemnation of animal-rights activists if they kill a wild animal unnecessarily , they are also fearful of being held liable if someone is injured in an attack on public land . Some of their officers see it as a no-win dilemma . After a mountain_lion attacked 10-year-old Laura Small in 1986 -- leaving her partially paralyzed and blind in one eye -- Orange County lost a $ 2-million lawsuit , judged negligent for failing to post warnings that lions might lurk in Ronald W . Caspers Wilderness Park . Since then , the county has been unsuccessful in a campaign to pass a law shielding local_governments from such suits . Trial_lawyers and hunters ' groups have opposed their bills . Despite the fear that wild animals can arouse , standoffs with human_beings almost always turn_out badly for the beast . State game officials , who have primary responsibility for removing wild animals from populated areas , kill an average of five to 10 mountain lions a year , said Terry Mansfield , director of the Department of Fish and Game . It is within their authority to capture and remove the animal to a safe habitat . Seldom is that an option , however , because the mountain_lion population has filled its habitat to overflowing , Mansfield said . Today , the only significant management of the mountain_lion population is accomplished by depredation permits , which authorize property_owners to kill mountain_lions that threaten livestock or pets . The number of lions killed by permit has grown steadily from five in 1971 to 74 last year , and will probably rise again this year , Mansfield said . Most of the depredation permits are issued in rural counties in the central and northern part of California . No lions have been killed under permit in Los Angeles , and neither have Los Angeles city officials had occasion to kill a lion . Of the three lions trapped in urban_areas of the San Fernando Valley in the past quarter-century , two showed_up in the last six years , said Kroeplin , the wildlife officer for the area . One of those climbed a tree behind a Chatsworth house in 1988 and the other was prowling a condominium at Tampa Avenue and Rinaldi Street in 1991 . Both were released in the mountains , Kroeplin said . With lion sightings increasing , Kroeplin fears such good_fortune may_not last . As he walked down a fire road near Aliso Creek in Granada Hills last week , where two boys made the Valley ' s most recent sighting , he observed only the tracks of humans , dogs and horses . But what the tracks tell him is that unsuspecting people are dallying in the domain of a lethal predator . &quot; These people come_up here every day , &quot; he said . &quot; Someday there ' s going_to be a mountain_lion going_across here. &quot; His hope is that when the encounter is over , lion and human walk_off unhurt , each to their own worlds . Prowling Into Trouble Once thought to have practically vanished even in the wild , the mountain_lion , or cougar , is bouncing_back , and increasinly running_into human_beings . In the last 12 months , officials have confirmed 14 mountain_lion sightings in urban_areas of the San Fernando Valley . * Local Sightings Confirmed by L.A.
