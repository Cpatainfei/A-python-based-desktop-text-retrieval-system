   <HEADLINE> CSLB ART MUSEUM OPENS ITS NEW SITE TUESDAY ; REMODELING : THREE INSTALLATIONS KICK OFF THE 8 # 000-SQUARE-FOOT PERMANENT FACILITY IN THE NORTH CAMPUS LIBRARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since 1984 , the top-ranked art museum in the Cal State system has been hidden away in temporary galleries on the fifth floor of the main university library , but it finally has a permanent , more easily accessible new home . The 8 # 000-square-foot University Art Museum facility in the west wing of the North Campus Library at Cal State Long_Beach opens Tuesday with three shows : a photographic installation by Belgian artist Marie-Jo Lafontaine ; photographs of homeless people by Howard Schatz ; and &quot; Wall Works &quot; -- participatory installations devised by such well-known conceptual artists as Sol LeWitt , Imi Knoebel and Daniel Buren . The new museum -- one wing of a 3-year-old brick and stucco building designed by campus master planners Killingsworth , Stricker , Lindgren , Wilson &amp; Associates -- had been built specifically for library uses , not to display art . But museum director Constance W . Glenn was anxious to find a new home for her institution , which closed_in December , 1992 , to accommodate remodeling of the main library . The closing was the latest blow to an institution that has weathered major funding losses along with much of the rest of the Cal State system . The museum ' s 1994 operating budget is currently slightly under $ 1 million , down from a 1989 high of $ 1.5 million . With cutbacks in the full-time staff from 14 to four , Glenn now doubles as chief curator . Her concerns about the building found a sympathetic ear in Long_Beach resident Robert Gumbiner , chairman_of_the_board of FHP International Corp , who pledged $ 30 # 000 to transform the west wing into a museum . Although the Gumbiner gift was the largest single private donation to the remodeling project , the job also required university construction funds -- lobbied for by several high-placed officials -- for such initially unforeseen expenses as fire exits and handicapped access . ( University officials are mum about the total cost , which Glenn says even she doesn ' t know. ) While the museum hasn ' t gained additional exhibition space in its new location , it is now distinguished as an entity in its own_right by virtue of a prominent ground-floor location and a separate entrance . &quot; We didn ' t want any sense of being an aspect of another building , &quot; Glenn says . The Center Court Gallery , a ceremonial , 1 # 260-square-foot space demarcated by four plump columns and capped by a skylight , is surrounded by five other galleries with 12-foot ceilings and varying sizes . A windowed , 80-foot-long expanse can be divided into two or three smaller areas ( one of which is named for Gumbiner ) . Only one small &quot; black_box &quot; gallery escapes the ubiquitous wash of natural light . Shoehorned into the remaining space are a museum shop , designed by Los Angeles artist Eugenia P . Butler , and a handful of tiny offices . ( Storage and workroom space have been carved out of an area at the east end of the library. ) A few vestiges of the original library design remain , including patterned gray carpeting in the central gallery -- Glenn prevailed on the architects to allow bare concrete floors elsewhere -- and a massive central planter buried too deeply in the ground to allow_for easy removal . Glenn says it may someday serve as the base for a Nancy Graves sculpture owned by the museum . ( The rest of the UAM collection consists_of contemporary works_of_art on paper and outdoor sculptures installed at various sites on campus. ) Butler was one of three artists commissioned to make pieces for the museum garden , her fancifully ornamental bench , &quot; Lover ' s Bench for a New Millennium , &quot; is based on William Blake ' s drawings for Milton ' s &quot; Paradise Lost. &quot; Frederick Fisher planted delicate Italian_cypress and black plum_trees that delineate the footprint of an outdoor &quot; Room. &quot; Founded in 1973 , the UAM was accredited in 1984 by the American Assn . of Museums . Two years later , the California Arts Council ranked the museum among the top six arts institutions in the state , calling it &quot; a model for university museums. &quot; In accordance with Gumbiner ' s proviso that the museum stay open evenings to accommodate working people , the UAM ' s new hours will be noon to 8 p.m. , Tuesday through Thursday ; and noon to 5 p.m. , Friday through Sunday .
