   <HEADLINE> WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY ; KWAN , THE CALM AMID STORMS , JUST GOES ABOUT HER BUSINESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While the earth shakes in nearby communities , and man-made tremors threaten to split apart her sport , Michelle Kwan of Torrance diligently goes_about her business at Lake Arrowhead ' s International Ice Castle , preparing her programs in case she is called_upon to skate in next month ' s Winter_Olympics . &quot; We were told right after the national championships that we were to train very hard , as if we were going_to Norway , &quot; Kwan ' s coach , Frank Carroll , said over the weekend . &quot; that ' s what we ' ve been doing. &quot; Initially , the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . wanted the 13-year-old Kwan , the first alternate because of her second-place finish in the national championships , to be ready in case Nancy Kerrigan was unable to skate because of knee injuries sustained in the assault in Detroit . But now that it seems Kerrigan will be fine , it could be that Kwan will replace national champion Tonya Harding if Harding is implicated in the attack and removed from the Olympic team . &quot; We ' re kind of in limbo , &quot; Carroll said . So is the USFSA , which has until Jan . 31 to name its Olympians , including alternates . If anyone selected to compete in Norway is subsequently unable to skate , the U.S. Olympic Committee has until Feb . 21 , two days before the women ' s competition begins in Norway , to replace her with an alternate . Should Harding ' s legal_status not be resolved before the U.S. women are scheduled to leave on Feb . 9 , it is possible Kwan would be asked to go_to Norway with them in case a change has to be made later . But because alternates are not allowed to live_in the athletes ' village or skate at official practices , the USOC would have to arrange alternate accommodations . * A recent item in this column reporting that George Steinbrenner is a financial contributor to Kwan could have caused her problems with other backers , who wondered why they should give if the New York Yankee owner is picking_up the tab . As since has been explained to them , Steinbrenner has sent her $ 7 # 000 , which , while generous , does not put her in Don Mattingly ' s income_bracket . * Most Europeans do not seem concerned about the security of their figure skaters , probably because their champions rarely become cultural icons such_as Peggy Fleming and Dorothy Hamill . &quot; It would never happen in France , &quot; Eugene Peizerat , secretary_general of the_French Ice_Skating Federation , told the Associated Press . &quot; We don ' t think that way here . It seems to me to be a money-related problem . It ' s gone commercial over there. &quot; * Speaking of commercials , Kerrigan made a brief trip to Los Angeles last week to film one for Reebok . According to Reebok spokesman Dave Fogelson , the general theme was &quot; overcoming obstacles. &quot; But Fogelson could not reveal the location of the shoot because he didn ' t know . &quot; I didn ' t want to know , &quot; he said . &quot; If I ' m captured , it can ' t be beaten_out of me. &quot; * I ' m pretty sure that Shawn Eric Eckardt was not the model for Kevin Costner ' s character in &quot; The Bodyguard. &quot; * The sports scandal captivating Great Britain involves Cliff Temple , the respected track_and_field correspondent for the London Times who committed suicide by throwing himself under a train . The British Athletic Federation is investigating to determine whether its promotions officer , Andy Norman , emotionally pushed Temple . &quot; Sports boss hounded suicide reporter , &quot; claimed a recent headline in the Times . Concerned about a Times investigation into his activities as the most powerful man in British track_and_field , Norman allegedly threatened to spread stories about a sexual_relationship between Temple and a female athlete formerly coached by the correspondent . The athlete , Shireen Bailey , denied there was a relationship . Bailey and other athletes who were coached by Temple and the_British Athletic Writers ' Assn . have called_for Norman ' s banishment from the sport , but the BAF has allowed him to remain in his position during the investigation . * Helen Stephens , 75 , died last week after a stroke in Florissant , Mo . She was less famous for the two gold medals she won in track_and_field in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin than for her encounter afterward with Adolf Hitler . &quot; Hitler comes_in and gives me the Nazi salute , &quot; she said later . &quot; I gave him a good old Missouri handshake . Immediately , Hitler goes_for the jugular_vein . He gets ahold of my fanny , and he begins to squeeze and pinch and hug me up , and he said , ' You ' re a true Aryan type . You should be running_for Germany. ' &quot; So after he gave me the once-over and a full massage , he asked me if I ' d like to spend the weekend in Berchtesgaden. &quot; She declined . * Organizers of the Feb . 12-27 Winter_Olympics in Lillehammer report they have sold 90 % of available tickets . That beats the previous record of 84 % set by the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles . * Jay Leno says Tonya Harding belongs in the Olympics . . . &quot; as an enforcer for the hockey team. &quot;</TEXT>
