   <HEADLINE> MOVIE MOOLAH ; ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE THE GROWING PROFIT -- AND PAIN -- OF HOSTING HOLLYWOOD TV AND FILM CREWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a recent Sunday , police barricades brought traffic -- and shopping -- to a halt on what is usually the busiest day_of_the_week for the little antique stores clustered around the Orange Plaza park . A hostage situation ? Traffic accident ? No , it was simply the filming of a Toyota commercial . Hours of empty sidewalks and stores have left merchants in an uproar . They complain that customers couldn ' t get_to their businesses , resulting in the collective loss of thousands of dollars in potential sales . Orange ' s experience highlights the growing unease of living with film production as the county steps_up efforts to lure Hollywood producers to shoot on location here . &quot; At this point , there is no question there is disruption in some quarters , &quot; said county Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez , who took the lead in creating an Orange County Film Office . &quot; But when they produce here , they spend money here , &quot; and disruptions are minor compared to the huge economic benefits of filming on location . For years , Hollywood has taken_over buildings and streets in Los Angeles . Local businesses delight as the film crews lavish tens of thousands of dollars on equipment rentals , food and accommodations , but neighbors can recoil once the glitter wears_away . Orange County has had its share of film experience -- though not nearly as much as county officials would like . The county has served as host for portions of numerous movies , from Cecil B . DeMille ' s silent version of &quot; The Ten Commandments , &quot; to the current box_office smash &quot; Clear and Present Danger. &quot; Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise shuffled through the Santa Ana Train_Station at the conclusion of &quot; Rain Man. &quot; Emilio Estevez perfected his team ' s slap shot in &quot; Mighty Ducks II &quot; at The Pond of Anaheim . Sean Connery as James Bond destroyed an offshore drilling_rig in the 1971 spy flick &quot; Diamonds Are Forever. &quot; Without really trying , Orange County was second in film_industry expenditures among California counties in 1992 , the year in which the Alliance of Motion_Picture and Television Producers trade group conducted a study of the issue . But it was a pittance by comparison : nearly $ 15 billion in payroll and spending by the industry in Los Angeles County compared to $ 216 million in Orange County . And those Orange County figures included salaries of workers who merely live here but work in Hollywood . No one is quite sure of how much money was spent by Hollywood producers shooting on location in Orange County . That amount , too , is small compared to the amount spent in Los Angeles because of the work rules that govern film production . On major pictures , unions have a rule that makes their members eligible for overnight stays or bus transportation for jobs farther than 30 miles from Hollywood . Only the northern edge of Orange County -- from Seal Beach to Fullerton -- is within the circle . Cost , however , does not explain it all . The county has never actively solicited relationships with Hollywood until now , and misunderstanding has been allowed to grow on both sides . &quot; They think we ' re a bunch of snobbish Republicans , or Disneyland , or orange groves , &quot; said Cristi Silverberg , the director of the new Orange County Film Office . * Making matters worse , each of Orange County ' s 31 cities has different requirements for film permits . While Newport Beach can sometimes process applications in less than an hour and charges $ 200 a day to film , Mission Viejo requests a 30-day advance notice and charges $ 500 a day . Silverberg said she hopes to standardize the process with a one-stop center or by encouraging cities to charge the same fees . San Diego , which is cited as a model of film friendliness by Vasquez , abolished its fees and now only requires basic information about where and what a crew is filming . &quot; We didn ' t streamline the permit system . We said we weren ' t going_to have permits , &quot; said Wally Schlotter , the city ' s film commissioner . The result was a near 50-fold increase , over 15 years , in the amount of spending by film crews in the city to about $ 31 million in 1993 . San Diego is home to two syndicated television series -- &quot; Silk Stalkings , &quot; and &quot; Renegade , &quot; with Lorenzo Lamas . &quot; When Sea World sent_out a questionnaire asking visitors why they came_to see the marine amusement_park a_few years back , it was surprised to see how many checked the box marked other , &quot; Schlotter said . &quot; Other &quot; turned_out to be viewers of &quot; Simon and Simon , &quot; the since-canceled network version of the San Diego-based television detective show in which star Jameson Parker receives a wet smooch from a killer_whale in the opening credits . Just as important as bringing film and television crews to San Diego , Schlotter said he sees his role as keeping tabs on them while they are there . &quot; Given the chance , they will break the rules -- get the shot , and leave town , &quot; he said . * Newport Beach discovered that dilemma the hard way in 1986 . A boat being blown_up in the Back Bay area for &quot; Assassination , &quot; a movie_starring Charles Bronson , was supposed to burn for 35 seconds . Instead , it blazed for 40 minutes . The explosion and fire stopped traffic on Coast Highway and halted flights from John Wayne Airport . Sparks scorched canvas covers on about 40 other boats , set a house ablaze , and caused smoke and cinder damage to others . &quot; It was such a painful movie , I have not ever watched it , &quot; said Glen Everroad , the city ' s revenue manager . Nevertheless , he added , the city learned a lesson . It turned for help to a local film_industry veteran , Joseph Cleary , who operates a small company that helps filmmakers find locations on boats or ships . &quot; After the disaster , Joe cleaned_out Jacuzzis , washed windows and took damage estimates , &quot; Everroad said . Now Cleary coordinates crews coming_into the city , often acting_as a liaison between them and local merchants or homeowners . When Volvo filmed an expensive television commercial near the Balboa Pier last summer , Cleary found a way to park an unexpected bus-sized dressing_room truck without offending merchants . To stay_on good terms with the locals , Cleary made_sure that the crews ordered 60 pizzas a day and distributed them to locals on the beachfront . &quot; My biggest concern is not to dump on your neighbor , &quot; Cleary said . * The city of Orange could have used someone like Cleary last month for the filming of the Toyota commercial on the most profitable day_of_the_week for the antique and curio dealers who cluster near the circle park called the Plaza . Shop owners say they didn ' t have a chance to protest the plan to allow filming on Sunday before the City_Council . And after approval came , some said they received a memo from the Toyota commercial ' s producer , informing them that filming would be wrapped_up at 1 p.m. on Sunday . That schedule would have been all_right , because the sidewalks usually fill_in the afternoons as families wander over from church_services and lunch . Instead , morning overcast prevented shooting -- and the crews worked until 6 p.m. Brian McBroom said that business at his family-owned J &amp; J Antiques and Collectibles was off $ 500 for the day . At one point , he said a woman coming_to pick_up a purchase was held behind the barricades for half an hour before being allowed through . &quot; It created tremendous turmoil , &quot; said nearby antique dealer Chris Harwood . &quot; There ' s no way in the world we would have permitted ( filming ) on a Sunday. &quot; Ironically , the commercial will only be shown overseas -- in Japan . If Orange County wants a bigger piece of the film_industry action , it had better learn to adjust to dealing with movie crews . &quot; You ' ve got_to convince people once in a while that they have to put_up with a little inconvenience , &quot; Roger Mayer , president of media mogul Ted Turner ' s Turner Entertainment Co. , said at a recent symposium on film production in Orange County . &quot; Everyone would like to have ( a movie ) shot in the next block. &quot; Such inconvenience is worth it , local leaders say , because clearly identifiable images of Orange County seen around the globe will entice more people to visit , providing a boost to the county ' s all-important tourism industry . Often Orange County is merely a stand-in for somewhere else . When free-lance location manager Steve Dayan brought a production to Laguna Beach , it was because the local shores were a substitute for Hawaii . &quot; I found a perfect Hawaii look-alike , &quot; he said . Even if a city is portrayed by name , it is not always portrayed favorably . In the hit summer movie &quot; Speed , &quot; Los Angeles is home to a mad bomber . When star Keanu Reeves boards a bomb-rigged public_transit bus , he is threatened by a pistol-waving passenger . Yet Los Angeles film officials are tickled that &quot; Speed &quot; was shot in the city , rather than becoming yet another &quot; runaway &quot; production . Never mind the less-than-ideal portrayal of the city . &quot; I think everyone understands we ' re talking_about fantasy , &quot; said Patti Stolkin-Archuletta , director of the California Film Commission in Los Angeles . &quot; It was an action movie . I don ' t know that it sent a negative message about L.A. I thought it could be Anywhere , U.S.A. &quot; Ariel Penn , film liaison for the city of Pasadena , is fond of pointing_out that Lyle Lovett and Whoopi Goldberg , playing two Pasadena police_detectives in the 1993 Roger Altman film &quot; The Player , &quot; were about the only two honest characters in the film . Cities can do little to regulate content . &quot; Your film commission is not employed to be a censor , &quot; said San Diego ' s Schlotter . For now , however , Orange County has so little major film production that censorship is the least of its problems . Plans are in the works to promote the county at a major annual show for location managers and to invite them on a bus trip through the county to see photogenic spots like the old courthouse in Santa Ana , where a sequence in Rob Reiner ' s summer film &quot; North &quot; was filmed . Until then , movie scouts are likely to draw_a_blank when asked what they can shoot in Orange County . &quot; You probably have things there that none of us know anything about , &quot; said Turner Entertainment ' s Mayer . &quot; When people are sitting around planning production , it ' s not in their heads to say , ' Let ' s go_to Orange County !
