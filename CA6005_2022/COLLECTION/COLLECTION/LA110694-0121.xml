   <HEADLINE> AFTER ALL THE NEGATIVITY , WILL THE VICTORS BE ABLE TO GOVERN CALIFORNIA ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the campaign that truth forgot spins to a close , it ' s becoming clear that the slash-and-trash politics of 1994 will make_it extraordinarily difficult for the victors to govern California . Throughout this election season , the mood of Californians has been sour . A recent Los Angeles Times poll showed that two-thirds of voters surveyed think the state is_on the wrong track . Only 27 % said it is headed in the right direction . Voter antagonism toward government and the politicians who run it was high even before the flood of negative campaign ads hit . A national poll taken by Times Mirror Corp . earlier this fall , and a more recent Orange County survey conducted by UC Irvine researcher Mark Baldassare , depict an electorate that is rootless , self-absorbed , hostile toward the poor and social-welfare programs . And the campaign has only heightened that surly mood . This has been the most poll-driven election campaign in memory . Anger , fear and divisiveness are its currency -- and Californians are buying . And governance could be a victim . Governing -- shaping public policy -- requires consensus . Reaching consensus , inevitably the product of compromise , requires that elected leaders and constituents have confidence in each other , trust each other . The rhetoric of this campaign has hardly inspired such trust . In her ads and on the hustings , state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown has repeatedly branded Gov . Pete Wilson a liar . In turn , Wilson has impugned Brown ' s consistency and integrity . It ' s not surprising that voters , already disdainful of government by &quot; sleazy politicians , &quot; don ' t like either candidate much . Still , despite the truly mean tone of the gubernatorial campaign , some discussion of policy has slipped past the strident and negative ads . The U.S. Senate_campaign is another matter . It has seldom moved beyond character_assassination . Too_bad . California voters have been denied the opportunity to participate in a clear-cut referendum on the direction they want government to take . A real choice between two quite different philosophies of governance has been buried under layers of mean-spirited charge and countercharge . As a result , voters find themselves faced with a Hobson ' s choice . Do they vote for an incumbent whom Mike Huffington tarred as &quot; a senator who serves special_interests -- and her own &quot; ? Or for a challenger whom Sen . Dianne Feinstein labeled as &quot; secretive , threatening and greedy . . . the Texas oil millionaire Californians just can ' t trust &quot; ? If Californians return Feinstein to Washington , might they view every one of her future votes skeptically -- as just another &quot; special_interest &quot; payoff ? If Huffington replaces her , might he find himself a pariah in the Capitol , his motives and actions continually questioned by constituents and colleagues ? In either case , California is the loser . The fallout from the debate over Proposition 187 underscores the risks to governance inherent in crafting political support from anger , fear and distrust . Arguing against the initiative , which would deny most government services to illegal immigrants , hospital official David Langness told a Times reporter , &quot; The overlay of civil_disobedience , general confusion , lawsuits and uncertainty about how to apply the law will result in great chaos. &quot; Whether or not an exaggeration , such charged rhetoric serves to show how the anti-immigrant measure has further torn California ' s tattered social fabric . Race has been injected into a critical policy problem . Inevitably , that will make a solution to illegal immigration more difficult to achieve , regardless of the vote . Whether 187-supporter Wilson or 187-opponent Brown is the next governor , the state ' s chief_executive will have to lead a California incapable of debating serious policy alternatives . So wide is the divisive net cast by the &quot; Save Our State &quot; initiative that the judiciary is almost certain to find its own reputation , already under a cloud , on the line if the measure passes . Opponents of 187 are primed to challenge the proposition ' s legality in court , and whatever the ruling , a lot of people ' s suspicions , mostly negative , about the system ' s ability to deliver justice will be confirmed . And voters who viewed Proposition 187 as a means to grab control of the policy process away from unresponsive politicians may find their will thwarted and their anger unassuaged . The barrage of negative campaigning has meant something else this election year . When Californians vote on candidates to fill lower , state constitutional offices , they are , in_effect , creating the leadership bench for the major parties . Because candidates in down-ballot races are usually inadequately funded and are virtually ignored by the media , voters seldom know much about them -- beyond ballot title and party affiliation . This year , voters not only face uninformed choices -- they have been pitched false choices . If you catch the last-minute ads being aired by some candidates in down-ballot races , you could assume that the lieutenant_governor , schools chief , secretary_of_state and insurance commissioner all have major crime-fighting responsibilities . If Californians cared enough to learn exactly what these hucksters do -- and cannot do -- after they take_office , they would likely become even more contemptuous of politicians ' promises . Up and down the ballot , the real issues in Tuesday ' s election have been swept_away by political mudslides . And it is representative government , and California ' s future , that may wind_up being buried underneath the debris. *</TEXT>
