   <HEADLINE> EFFORT TO REVIVE B-2 BOMBER TAKES WING ; AEROSPACE : CONGRESS IS BEING ASKED TO BUY MORE OF THE STEALTH BOMBERS . THOUSANDS OF JOBS HINGE_ON THE DECISION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the last B-2 Stealth bomber winds its way through the giant assembly hangar at the Northrop Grumman Corp . plant in Palmdale and 22 # 000 B-2 jobs nationwide fall_into a post-Cold War abyss , the bombers ' proponents have embarked_on a broad campaign to continue production . Against formidable political odds , the lobbying effort is attempting to sell the Pentagon and Congress on a plan for 20 additional B-2s for $ 12 billion -- cheap by historical B-2 standards but a mountain of gold for the cash-starved Defense_Department . The first batch of 20 bombers is costing $ 44 billion , which includes research and development . There are two key arguments for making more B-2s : The nation must_not abandon its unique production capability for Stealth bombers , and only the B-2 can respond to international crises quickly and without jeopardizing many members of the U.S. military . Both assertions evoke bitter dispute . &quot; The role of the bomber has been elevated , not diminished by the end of the Cold_War , &quot; said Gen . John M . Loh , the Air_Force ' s combat aircraft commander . &quot; Nothing has the range and the payload of the bomber or the sense of immediacy , able to strike in 10 to 12 hours anywhere in the world. &quot; The goal is for the Air_Force to buy B-2 bombers much like the Navy buys nuclear submarines and aircraft_carriers -- essentially at a slow but nonstop pace , rather than in large batches , which inevitably leads to contentious political battles . The B-2 campaign would be much tougher were it not for the California economy , which has loomed large over congressional actions this year . According to a UCLA analysis , 30 # 000 direct and indirect jobs in California supported by the B-2 will be lost under the current program over the next six years . But additional B-2 orders would preserve about 13 # 000 of those jobs . Northrop ' s success will depend in large measure on the political will of the California delegation , which appears this year to be born again on the merits of big-ticket military programs that can underpin the state ' s still-weak economy . California representatives flexed their muscles two weeks ago in a vote to increase purchases of the C-17 cargo jets , dealing a harsh setback to Rep . Ron Dellums , the Oakland Democrat who chairs the House Armed Services Committee . &quot; We have all been hit in the face with the recognition that aerospace in California is a real driver of the economic health of the state , &quot; said Northrop ' s new B-2 chief , Ralph Crosby , who cites a long list of California Democrats who support the B-2 . Of course , B-2 opposition is stiff . Sen . Patrick Leahy ( D-Vt. ) has charged that the B-2 &quot; has been more able to penetrate the Treasury than any enemy line. &quot; Selling more B-2s seemed virtually impossible a year ago , so its prospects have clearly improved . But the plane , designed to escape detection by enemy radar , has avoided any new technical problems in recent years that would have doomed further orders . The chairmen of three key military committees in Congress support buying more B-2s , and some senior Air_Force officials have expressed support for the B-2 in defiance of official Pentagon policy against buying more . Earlier this week , the Senate Armed Services Committee voted_in secret session to provide $ 150 million for future B-2 production by preserving special tools at subcontractors . Coming_up with $ 150 million is painless compared to the ultimate bill of $ 12 billion , however . That would require drastic steps , such_as reducing C-17 production , canceling the Lockheed F-22 fighter or eliminating a Navy carrier -- the kinds of sacrifices that would bloody the Capitol or lead to a &quot; real food fight , &quot; as one House staff_member put it . B-2 proponents have begun laying the intellectual groundwork for the battle , arguing at a Center for Security Policy seminar this week that the B-2 can project U.S. power around the globe more forcefully than Navy carrier battle_groups . The B-2 ' s ability to carry large conventional bombs and deliver them with precision anywhere in the world &quot; is equal_to nuclear deterrence and even better , because we are likely to use it , &quot; said Donald Hicks , a former defense official and Northrop consultant . * As the United States withdraws from bases in Europe and Asia , its forces will increasingly operate from this country . Naval aviation came_out of the 1980s defense buildup without a single new class of plane , leaving the service with an air fleet that will have less range to penetrate inland . Loh suggests that the Pentagon pay_for the added bombers by reducing spending on think_tanks , spacecraft and supply depots . He worries that Air_Force power is eroding below what is necessary to carry_out the Clinton_Administration ' s avowed mission of fighting two major regional wars simultaneously . At present , the Air_Force has just 80 operational bombers , for example , Loh said . Opponents , however , bristle_at the idea that the Pentagon should buy more bombers . It is facing a funding crisis , taking_on too many programs and being saddled with responsibility for many non-defense roles , such_as spending for defense conversion , they say . By some estimates , the Pentagon has $ 100 billion more in commitments over the next five years than it has funding . Neil Singer , a defense expert at the Congressional Budget Office , estimates that although 20 more B-2s may cost only $ 12 billion to buy , they would end_up costing another $ 88 billion to operate over the next 20 years . That would require eliminating three of the Navy ' s carrier battle_groups , for example . Aside from military power issues , B-2 proponents argue that the nation must preserve the unique manufacturing technology for large Stealth aircraft , much as it is buying submarines to keep General Dynamics ' Electric Boat shipyard open in Groton , Conn . The idea is a huge departure from historical practice , in which producers of fighters or jetliners built bombers as needed . But the technology is different today , the B-2 supporters say . &quot; If you don ' t think that ' s the case , all you have to do is look_at the A-12 , &quot; said Hicks , referring to the Navy ' s disastrous effort to build a Stealth bomber using contractors that had no Stealth experience . At the bomber seminar this week , former Pentagon officials such_as James Schlesinger , Caspar Weinberger and Paul Wolfowitz offered ideas that supported more B-2 production . And Frank Miller , principal deputy assistant secretary_of_defense , allowed that &quot; bombers may be the system of choice if we ever have to cross the nuclear threshold in a regional contingency. &quot; Such tough issues will take years to debate and evaluate -- long past the window for buying more B-2s . Northrop hopes to preserve the option of producing more B-2s while the debate goes_on .</TEXT>
