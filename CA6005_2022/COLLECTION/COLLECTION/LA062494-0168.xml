   <HEADLINE> WASTE , AWAY ; THE BURIED BLACK GOO BUBBLES TO THE SURFACE EACH SUMMER IN THIS WESTMINSTER TRACT ; CREWS IN JULY WILL BEGIN TO SCRAPE IT OUT-FOR GOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By looking , no one would guess that beneath the tranquil back yards of this middle_class neighborhood an ancient black ooze lies creeping toward the surface . Neatly manicured lawns border quiet sidewalks lined with trees . Residents walk their dogs and wash new cars_parked in fresh-swept driveways . And everywhere , the impression is one of quiet life in the sunny ambience of North County . Every summer , though , something odd happens as the soil warms in this tract near Sowell Avenue and Golden West Street . A strange dark goo seeps up through back-yard lawns and cracks in the patios . It exudes a powerful stench , residents say , that causes coughing , headaches , sleeplessness , chest_pains , nausea and breathing difficulty . One resident even attributes the recent loss of a lung and regular bouts of severe asthma to the annual appearance of the black goo . &quot; It ' s miserable , &quot; said Gloria Delzeith , 51 , a resident since 1978 whose asthma requires almost monthly hospitalization and has kept her from working for the past two years . &quot; It ' s black , it ' s tarry and it stinks like rotten eggs . It ' s just been a mess ; it keeps coming_out of the ground , and there ' s nothing you can do about it. &quot; Federal_officials plan to do something about it this summer . Starting late in July , they will begin a two-year project during which as_many as 50 families will be relocated for up_to four months . Bulldozer operators in breathing masks will dig deep into 25 back yards , tearing_up swimming_pools , patios , fences and room additions , which the government later will replace . Then they will remove 45 # 000 cubic_yards of the buried petroleum residue that officials say makes this one of the worst hazardous waste sites in America . &quot; We have moved quickly on this , &quot; said Dick Vesperman , project manager for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , which is overseeing the $ 15-million cleanup . &quot; Not all hazardous sites are in residential areas. &quot; In fact , this one wasn ' t heavily residential either in 1936 when , according to historical_records gathered by the EPA , the Long Beach-based Ralph Gray Trucking Co . dumped petroleum waste_products of unknown origin into four open pits in a field the company owned . Numerous complaints to health officials and the Westminster Chamber_of_Commerce landed the_matter in court . On Dec . 2 , 1936 , the company ' s owner , Ralph Gray , was convicted of maintaining a public nuisance , a misdemeanor , and ordered to pay a $ 100 fine and to eliminate the problem within 30 days . * Apparently that never happened . Four years later a county health inspector was responding to further complaints with predictions that , left alone , the mess would seep away &quot; within a short time. &quot; And in 1958 a developer , intent_on building a housing tract unmarred by the unsightly pits , moved the hazardous material into two long trenches buried 18 feet beneath the back yards of 25 of the houses he was building . &quot; Apparently he felt he could do_better with it underground , &quot; Vesperman said . &quot; He just put dirt over it. &quot; Federal_officials say Gray has since died , they can ' t find any descendants , and the trucking_company no longer exists . Nor can they find the developer of the tract . So two years ago , the site was added_to the National Priorities List of Superfund sites , thus qualifying it for the federally funded cleanup . That project will take_place in two phases . This summer , Vesperman said , about half of those affected will be temporarily moved at government expense to nearby hotels , rented houses or the homes of relatives and friends . The families will include 12 whose back yards are to be excavated as well as their nearest neighbors . The waste will be taken_to an as yet undetermined hazardous waste disposal site in California . And later , Vesperman said , government workers will reconstruct the torn-up back yards with landscaping and swimming_pools , patios and room additions . EPA officials have set_up headquarters in one of the affected houses ; a three-bedroom rental which , like other homes_in the neighborhood , would probably sell for $ 150 # 000 to $ 200 # 000 if banks were willing to finance the sale -- which none are , residents say . The project ' s second phase will occur next summer when the same thing will be done to the remaining affected back yards . The ethnically diverse community , where 12 languages are spoken , has &quot; been very supportive , &quot; Vesperman said . &quot; It ' s really a cooperative effort. &quot; Yet some residents aren ' t pleased . Paul Nguyen , a 23-year-old law_student who has lived here with his mother for 10 years , said he has never seen evidence of the black ooze . &quot; I never gave it a thought , &quot; he said . &quot; This is an inconvenience ; we don ' t want to leave. &quot; Others , however , say that the project couldn ' t happen a moment too soon . Mike Torres , a sheet_metal worker who has lived here for 34 years , said that four members of his family already suffer from asthma , which he attributes to the waste . &quot; It ' s great that they ' re doing_it , &quot; he said . &quot; we ' ll enjoy being in a different location for a while. &quot; * And Delzeith , whose family expects to spend much of the summer living at a nearby Marriott hotel , said that while the cleanup may be too late to significantly improve her own health , she hopes that it will help maintain the health of others . &quot; It ' s taken them a long_time , &quot; said the former office supervisor , who had a lung removed last year because of what she describes as internal &quot; blistering. &quot; While no medical evidence exists directly linking her condition to the waste , Delzeith said , she is convinced that it stems from years of breathing the material ' s fumes . &quot; They should have done this a long_time ago , &quot; she said , &quot; but I ' ll be glad when it ' s all_cleared out. &quot; While officials say they have detected no statistically significant increase in the incidence of disease among residents of the tract , they acknowledge that long-term exposure to some of the chemicals contained in it , particularly sulfur_dioxide , can exacerbate pre-existing upper-respiratory conditions , including asthma . &quot; There ' s a chemical soup down there , &quot; said Marilyn C . Underwood , a toxicologist with the state health department who is familiar_with the site . &quot; It ' s a health hazard. &quot; Vesperman concurs . &quot; The risk assessments we ' ve done have indicated that there is some potential long-term health threats from continued exposure , &quot; he said . While the material is relatively harmless while buried in the ground , he added , there is some danger when it seeps to the surface during hot summers or because of excavation . One of the major hurdles in the project , officials say , is finding places where relocated residents can have their pets . &quot; It ' s a problem , &quot; said Fraser Felter , the agency ' s community relations coordinator . &quot; We ' ve got people with tortoises , 250 koi , rabbits , pheasants , chickens , birds , dogs and cats . Just a little thing like pets can really complicate matters. &quot; While government officials tackle that , some residents have begun packing . &quot; I ' m looking_forward to it , &quot; Delzeith said of the planned move . &quot; We ' re leaving everything except food , clothes and important papers . Some other stuff we ' ll put_in storage. &quot; Betty Haynes , 73 , said spending four months away from her home of 16 years &quot; will be kind of fun . I don ' t get_out much any more ; this will be something different. &quot; Back-Yard Cleanup In a_few weeks , the federal Environmental Protection Agency will begin to excavate and remove toxic oil_refinery waste buried in a Westminster housing tract . The waste wil go_to an authorized disposal site . * Evaluating Waste Sites Surface leaks Soil samples with hazardous waste : Small cores of soil establish locations and toxicity . Air monitoring wells : Measure noxious fumes and hazardous emissions during excavation process . * Excavation After fences , patios , pools and some rooms are removed , backhoes load hazardous material on trucks . When excavation is complete , lots will be regraded and pools , patios , fences and rooms rebuilt . * Hauling Hazardous Waste Under federal safety guidelines , dump_trucks hauling hazardous waste must have bed lined with thick , durable plastic sheeting . Waste is loaded into bed , sprayed with a foamy moisture sealant and battened under . * Original disposal pits : Oil-refining materials buried at site in 1936 . Area to be cleaned in 1995 . Area to be cleaned in 1994 * Topsoil ( surface-3 feet ) Hazardous waste ( 3-18 feet ) Security fencing surrounds cleanup area ; other security measures include increased police patrols and additional street lighting . Water-based misting system , woven into security fence , keeps fumes and dust inside excavation area .
