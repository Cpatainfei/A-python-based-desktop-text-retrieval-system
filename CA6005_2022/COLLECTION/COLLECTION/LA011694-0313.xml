   <HEADLINE> YOUR MORTGAGE ; QUESTIONS TO ASK WHEN SCREENING TO FIND BEST LENDER FOR DEAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How do I shop for a loan ? In order to meet the customary 30-day financing contingency deadline , a lender must be selected and a loan_application completed within several days after the purchase_contract is accepted . First you need to know where to look_for a loan . Most buyers get home loans from savings and loans , mortgage banks or commercial_banks . These are referred to as lenders . Many buyers use the services of a mortgage broker who acts_as an intermediary between the borrower and the lender . Ask friends and associates who bought a home or refinanced recently for a recommendation if they were satisfied with the service they received . Your real_estate_agent can provide you with lender rate sheets and can make recommendations . After you ' ve generated a list of possible money sources , call a representative of each and ask the following questions : -- What types of home loan programs do you offer ? Not all lenders provide all loan programs . For example , if you want an adjustable rate mortgage with an interest_rate that ' s fixed for more_than a year , your financing sources will be limited . -- What are your current interest_rates ? For ARMs , you ' ll also want to know how long the initial interest_rate will be in_effect ; the fully indexed rate ; the margin ; the index ; the interest_rate and monthly payment adjustment schedule ; the interest_rate caps ( periodic and lifetime ) ; if negative amortization is possible , and if the loan is convertible to a fixed rate at some point . -- What are your loan fees and when are they paid ? -- What are your qualifying ratios ? Briefly review your financial situation with each lender to make_sure there ' s a good chance you ' ll be approved for a loan before you apply . -- Will Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ) or an impound account ( for property_taxes and insurance ) be required ? What will this cost ? -- Is it possible to lock-in an interest_rate ? When can a rate be locked-in ? What will it cost ? -- How long will it take_to approve a loan ? -- Does loan_approval and processing occur locally ? Processing a loan long distance can result in frustrating delays . -- Will you give me a written loan commitment ? Some lenders only give verbal approvals . -- Do your loans have prepayment penalties ? -- Do you require termite work to be completed by closing ? -- If the sellers have agreed to pay_for some or all_of your non-recurring closing costs , ask if the lender will allow this . -- Will you provide references of recent customers ? Be sure to check references . You ' re looking_for a loan you can live with , and also for someone who ' ll process your loan efficiently . If you find this list daunting , or if you ' re short on_time , you may want to use a mortgage broker to shop for a loan for you . First-Time Tip : There ' s usually an inverse relationship between the interest_rate and points ( origination_fees ) charged on a loan : the lower the interest_rate , the higher the points , and vice versa . Points on a purchase loan are tax deductible in the year of purchase , so you may want to pay higher upfront fees for a lower interest_rate . If you ' re cash-strapped , however , you may need a low-point loan with a higher rate . Be aware that some no-point loans have prepayment penalties . The Closing : Buyers of homes_in new developments are wise_to use a lender who ' s experienced in financing new homes . You may get_the_best service by going_with a lender who has processed loans for other buyers who have purchased homes_in the same development .</TEXT>
