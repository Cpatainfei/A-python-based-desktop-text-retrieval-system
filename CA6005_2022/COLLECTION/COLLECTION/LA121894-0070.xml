   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : IT ' S NOT WHAT SHE SAID , BUT HOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is the mood of the people such_that an episode of a prime-time sitcom built around masturbation can win big ratings and awards , while political appointees who discuss its relevance to sex education get canned ? Well , sort of . True , Jerry Seinfeld scored big with last year ' s show about who could go the longest without resorting_to , well , you know . And true , Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders got fired because she suggested earlier this month at an AIDS conference that masturbation is &quot; a part of human sexuality &quot; and &quot; a part of something that perhaps should be taught. &quot; But Elders ' remark was merely the last straw on the back of a political camel named Bill , whose knees were already weakened with the unexpected weight of some heavy midterm election baggage . The already staggering Clinton really had no choice in his effort to placate the Right ; Elders had to go . In firing Elders , however , the President did something that no casual answer to a question about AIDS prevention could . He put masturbation on the front page . Way to go , Bill . As the mother of a toddler who has lately been experimenting with her large collection of stuffed animals , I am somewhat relieved . It ' s nice to know I am not the only adult in America thinking_about teaching children about masturbation , which on reflection is rather like teaching them about candy . Once they discover candy , they are rather prone to like it . It ' s just that you want them to eat it at the appropriate times . * When the news of Elders ' firing hit the media last week , Debra Haffner began receiving calls from friends whose kids were suddenly asking about masturbation . Haffner is executive_director of the Sexuality Education and Information Council of the United States , a 30-year-old New York-based information clearinghouse and advocacy organization for individual sexual rights . What , asked Haffner ' s friends , should they tell the kids ? &quot; What I told them to say was that touching your own genitals is called masturbation and that some boys and girls do_it and some do not. &quot; Simple . Uncomplicated . And hardly controversial . Nor should it be surprising that parents are at_sea on this and have to ask_for help . This is why most states have_sex education curriculum , after all . Here is what many sex educators think schoolchildren should know about masturbation : * It is one way for people to express their sexuality . * It is a way to give sexual_pleasure without risking disease or pregnancy . * Most people will do_it at some point . * Doing_it or not doing_it are both healthy choices . * It does not cause physical or mental harm . * Single and married people do_it . * It is a controversial topic and some people disapprove for religious reasons . * Your palms will not grow hair if you do_it . * Nor will you go blind . &quot; It ' s important to recognize that when both ' Roseanne ' and ' Seinfeld ' dealt with the issue this year , their ratings went_up , but when a federal_official talked_about it , she got fired , &quot; Haffner says . &quot; This is not an issue that is not talked_about in the popular culture . But the word itself is so loaded . Maybe if Elders had said , ' Master of His Domain ' ( as masturbation was referred to in the Emmy-winning ' Seinfeld ' episode ) , this would not have happened. &quot; Little sex-educator joke there . * Masturbation may_not be fodder for conversation at most dinner_tables in America , but it is certainly widely practiced . According to the much-publicized sex survey published by University of Chicago researchers last fall , about 60 % of men and 40 % of women admitted to masturbating occasionally or frequently . ( And what to make of these tidbits ? The greater a person ' s education and salary , the more likely they were to say they do_it . And the only issue people were less comfortable discussing than masturbation was how much money they make. ) Pepper Schwartz , a professor of sociology at the University of Washington , Seattle , has studied human sexuality for many years and finds it &quot; both humorous and pitiful &quot; that Americans are still talking_about whether masturbation &quot; is a good thing , or a moral thing , or whether this should be discussed in polite company . It feels good , and we are a pretty Puritanical society , so we are not so sure that feeling good is such a great idea. &quot; Sort of like candy . Everyone loves it , but nobody wants to admit how much .</TEXT>
