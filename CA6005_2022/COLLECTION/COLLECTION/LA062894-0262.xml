   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; DESPITE THE ODDS , GERMANY ' S KOHL IS ONCE AGAIN A FRONT-RUNNER ; ELECTION : LONG-RULING CHANCELLOR GETS A BOOST AS SOCIAL DEMOCRATS ' MODERATE LEADER SLIPS IN EARLY POLLING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A series of electoral setbacks has thrown Rudolf Scharping , the Social Democratic Party leader once widely seen as Germany ' s next chancellor , into second place in this election-rich year and increased odds that Chancellor Helmut Kohl can hold power when Germany conducts federal elections in October . Such a resurgence would make Kohl , who as leader of the Christian Democratic Union in the Bundestag has governed Germany since 1982 , one of the longest-tenured heads of government in the democratic world -- though by no means one of the most popular . In election after election this spring -- at the state , municipal and European levels -- voters in unforeseen numbers have rejected Social Democrats and their blandly moderate leader in favor of Kohl ' s Christian Democrats , the Greens or , increasingly , even the former Communist_Party of what used to be East_Germany . A public_opinion survey unveiled Monday showed the extent of Scharping ' s troubles : 40 % of those polled said they would vote for Kohl ' s Christian Democrats if federal elections were held next week ; only 36 % said they would elect Social Democrats . It was the widest such margin for Christian Democrats in three years . Just one month ago , the Social Democrats narrowly led . The most recent blow for the Social Democrats came Sunday , when voters in the depressed eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt went_to the polls . So many moderate-to-leftists whom Scharping , 46 , might have expected to vote Social Democrat voted instead for the former East_German Communist_Party that Kohl ' s unpopular Christian Democrats managed a narrow victory . More surprising still , in municipal elections held Sunday in the former East_German state of Saxony , voters in the city of Hoyerswerda elected a member of the former East_German Communist_Party -- now doing business as the Party of Democratic Socialism -- as mayor . Although a number of tiny towns and villages in the former East_Germany had elected former-Communist mayors since the Berlin Wall ' s fall_in 1989 , Hoyerswerda , population 100 # 000 , is by far the largest city to do so . Analysts insist that the flash of enthusiasm for former Communists doesn ' t reveal lingering support for hard-line ideas as much as it shows the failings of the two main German political_parties : Neither the Christian Democrats nor the Social Democrats have convinced eastern Germans that they are much more_than colonizers from the rich outside , seeking to impose their will on a disadvantaged , vulnerable East . In a startling response to Sunday ' s elections , Reinhard Hoeppner , the Social Democrat gubernatorial contender in Saxony-Anhalt , said that his party might be able to work in an informal coalition with the former Communists if it were in a position to form a minority government in the state . Such a plan would have been unthinkable just weeks ago ; ever since the East_German government ' s collapse , western Germany ' s political_parties have ridiculed the former Communists and vowed to have nothing to do with them . Meanwhile , Christian Democrats in the state , seeking to build a governing coalition , said they would even be willing -- though by no means eager -- to govern in coalition with Social Democrats . But such an alliance of the two main German parties -- a &quot; grand coalition &quot; -- would be poorly received by voters and would send a discouraging signal to the many Germans who believe this country needs fresh faces and new ideas . Recent events mark a dramatic change from the mood in Germany as recently as March , when voters were heading for polls in the first of 29 elections that will occur by year ' s end . Kohl then simply appeared to be running_out of gas . Unemployment in Germany was 4 million or more , depending_on how it was measured ; public disappointment with the reunification was rampant , and the public had grown deeply skeptical about entrenched politicians . Factions in the coalition with the Christian Democrats were grumbling and plotting ; even in the governing party there was talk_of replacing Kohl . Against that backdrop , Scharping ' s strategy has been to portray himself as a responsible centrist for whom a middle-of-the-road German -- even a disenchanted Christian Democrat -- could vote with confidence . Scharping distanced himself from his party ' s leftist wing , saying he was proud to have had as_many as 150 # 000 U.S. soldiers stationed in his state , Rhineland-Palatinate . He embraced the concept of privatizing public_services , complained about the welfare_state ' s growth , warned labor_unions they compromised Germany ' s position in the world economy and favored noncombat participation by Germany in U.N. peacekeeping operations . Germans seemed drawn to this moderate voice of change : Polls showed almost half of the electorate thought Scharping ' s Social Democrats would form the next government , at least in coalition , while less than a fifth thought Kohl ' s Christian Democrats would return to power in Bonn . Last week , in an effort to regain percentages , Scharping used a party convention in the eastern city of Halle to deliver an uncharacteristically passionate speech . &quot; We have to fight more directly and determinedly so that there will be a change on Oct . 16 , &quot; he said to applause from party delegates who had complained about his leadership . &quot; You can ' t look_forward if you ' re hanging your head. &quot; Andreas Scharpf and Christopher Steinmetz of The Times ' Berlin Bureau contributed to this report from Halle .</TEXT>
