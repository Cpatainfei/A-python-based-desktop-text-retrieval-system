   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON SUICIDE ; DEATH EMERGES AS A CIVIL LIBERTY ; THE BATTLE FOR THE RIGHT OF THE TERMINALLY ILL TO CHOOSE HOW AND WHEN TO DIE TAKES A MAJOR STEP_FORWARD IN OREGON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Choice over whether to live longer while suffering or to die sooner with dignity has finally arrived . For some , this signals the beginning of the end of a 1 # 600-year-old Judeo-Christian tradition against voluntary death ; for others , it is the ultimate civil_liberty . Two recent , but very different , events heralded this new era : First , Oregon voters passed a law permitting limited physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill . And then in Massachusetts , Billy Best , a 16-year-old with cancer , declined medical treatment that might save his life . The breakthrough on choice in dying has been 20 years in gestation . High-tech medicine became widely available in the 1970s , spawning the significant Karen Ann Quinlan case in New Jersey in 1976 . Through her ordeal -- and that of her parents -- the public learned that people previously considered as_good_as dead could be kept alive in a twilight world almost indefinitely by machines . In the immediate wake of that case , California passed the world ' s first living-will legislation , which has been copied and improved upon throughout America and elsewhere in the world . Billy Best ' s story brought attention to a little discussed aspect of the double-edged sword that is modern medicine : Do some treatments aimed at curing or slowing a disease have such unbearable side_effects that a patient is right to refuse them , even if death is thereby hastened ? This was Billy ' s case . After he began chemotherapy last August to treat Hodgkin ' s disease , a form of lymphatic cancer , his hair fell_out , his jaw ached and he was often left with a metallic taste in his mouth . He complained of severe nausea , aches and pains . When he protested against the chemotherapy , his parents insisted that he stay with it because there is a high cure rate when this disease is caught early and treated promptly . So Billy packed his things and ran_away from home . &quot; I felt_like the medicine was killing me instead of helping me , &quot; he said upon his return home weeks later . His chastened parents then promised that there would be no more pressure . Although only 16 , Billy seems intelligent enough to make his own decisions . Probably there was poor communication between him , his health_professionals and his parents . I hope he changes his mind and tries again for a cure , perhaps a different one . Almost simultaneously , on the other side of the nation , Oregon voters initiated a world first by passing a ballot measure that , as of Dec . 8 , permits doctors to fill terminally ill patients ' requests for prescriptions for lethal overdoses of drugs . There is a thicket of safeguards , such_as two waiting periods , second opinions , documentation , family notification and mandatory counseling by the doctor on pain control , depression and hospice alternatives , that must be gotten_through before the cup of hemlock is dispensed . Injections are forbidden . This law does not oblige anybody to do anything . Health_professionals , hospitals , patients with different ethical values can ignore it . But those who want to escape their suffering by an accelerated death now have a choice . All that has happened is that a procedure that was illegal and covert is decriminalized in Oregon . It will bring great comfort to thousands of dying people just to know this escape route is there . But a firestorm of controversy is building over the new Oregon law . The religious right and hospice community have already vowed to repeal it , either through the courts , the Legislature or another initiative . The National Right_to_Life Committee has filed a lawsuit trying to block implementation . Staggered that the measure passed , the medical_profession is nursing feelings hurt by the voters ' implicit criticism of their care of the dying . From now on , the dying in Oregon will receive the best terminal care known to world medicine because no doctor wants to be labeled as &quot; the first &quot; to assist a suicide . The Oregon public believes life to be sacred , but we deny its sacral quality when it degenerates to_the_point of being unbearable and meaningless to the individual . Organized religion is offended by this attitude . The bruising , 25-year battle over the rights of the unborn is about to be replaced by a much bigger nationwide struggle for the right to choose to die .</TEXT>
