   <HEADLINE> PUBLIC FACES OVERDOSE OF SIMILAR DRUG NAMES ; HEALTH : PROLIFERATION OF NEW BRANDS MEANS BIG MONEY IS_ON THE LINE FOR COMPETING PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES , BUT CONFUSION CAN BE FATAL FOR PATIENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Quick , what was that prescription your father takes_for his ulcer ? Zantac ? Xanax ? Zenate ? Or that heart drug your uncle takes . Cardizem ? Procardia ? Cardura ? Or that new breast_cancer drug , Taxol -- or was it Paxil ? Pharmaceutical makers seem intent_on tying the American tongue with brand names that defy linguistic logic and often look and sound like one another . While other new product names are designed to be memorable , drug_companies seem to live_in a nether world of pharmo-jargon founded by ancient_Greeks and populated only by doctors and druggists . It ' s not just confusing -- it ' s also dangerous . Misunderstandings over names have led to fatal mistakes in prescriptions . Drug makers say they want names that are easy to remember , pronounce and spell , but that it ' s a difficult goal to reach . &quot; There are only 26 letters in the Roman_alphabet and there ' s a glut of trademarks , &quot; said Marty Mazurek , a naming executive with Merck &amp; Co. , the world ' s largest drug maker . Companies also face a complex naming process , watched_over by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and trademark offices in every country where they want to sell drugs . So sometimes , even when they think they ' ve found that perfect five-letter moniker , it can end_up translating to something like &quot; death &quot; in Chinese . As a result , finding new drug names can cost up_to $ 200 # 000 and take_up to four years , companies say . &quot; Desperation in finding a name has driven a lot of name development to very arbitrary , gibberish-type names , &quot; said Nan Budinger , creative director of Metaphor Name Consultants in San Francisco . * The drug-naming process is much different than back in 1899 , when scientists at Bayer AG in Germany found a new painkiller in the sap of a shrub called spiraea . They simply took the root phrase &quot; spir , &quot; put an &quot; a &quot; in front of it and an &quot; in &quot; in back and came_up with aspirin . Now the process begins years before the drug is sold , while scientists are still testing it in humans . First , international groups develop a generic name for the drug . This is the name that will apply to the chemical_compound no matter which company makes_it . Drug_company naming committees include doctors , pharmacists , linguists , marketers , researchers and even English_teachers . They start with hundreds of candidates from a computerized random name generator or those they dream_up on_their_own . The namers pick_out those easiest to say and spell and discard those that are too similar to existing drugs or those with unwanted meanings in English or other languages . Then they ' re reviewed by government regulators . Since 1990 , the FDA has been the final name arbiter , further weeding out look-alike names and those with too_much marketing &quot; puffery , &quot; like Fatoff or Getwell , said Yana Mille , a labeling regulator . &quot; ' Wonder ' has been used and accepted as the name of a bread , but it is not an acceptable name for a drug , &quot; she told a trademarks conference in May . The FDA has rejected a third of all names . For instance , the FDA rejected the name Regaine for Upjohn ' s hair restoration drug , but approved Rogaine . Traditionally , many drug names have Greek or Latin roots . &quot; Zo , &quot; for example , is a Greek prefix meaning life , &quot; pro &quot; is Greek and Latin for before , or in front of . &quot; Bene &quot; means well . These help the drugs sound medicinal , a key ingredient . Without it , &quot; People say , ' That doesn ' t sound like a legitimate drug . That sounds like a candy drug , ' &quot; said Clive Chajet of Lippincott &amp; Margulies Inc. , a corporate identity consultant . * Some drug makers , like the_Swiss company Sandoz AG , use their corporate name : Sandimmune , Sanorex , Sansert . Biotech drugs , developed from genetic_engineering , can be often be spotted with &quot; bio , &quot; &quot; gen , &quot; or &quot; cell &quot; in their names . John Montgomery , Warner-Lambert Co. ' s drug naming chief , said companies often want to describe the drug or what it does_in the trademark . For example , Cognex increases cognition in Alzheimer ' s disease patients . Pepcid is for peptic_ulcers . Halcion , a sleeping pill , is reminiscent_of halcyon , the mythological Greek bird that calmed the seas . Premarin , for post-menopausal pain , is made from pregnant mares ' urine . Neurontin treats neurons or nerve_cells to prevent epileptic_seizures . Estroderm is a patch that secretes the hormone estrogen through the skin . * Unfortunately , catchy phrases get overused . So , Cardura for high_blood_pressure sounds like Cardizem and Procardia for heart patients . Some companies prefer nonsense words because they ' re less likely to cause a trademark conflict . Many began relying_on the letters X and Z because they stand_out from others , but they ' ve become overused too . So there ' s Zantac for ulcers , Xanax for anxiety and Zenate , a vitamin supplement . The results of this confusion can be harrowing . In 1992 , the wife of a New York State appeals court judge died after a hospital that should have given her Paraplatin , a Bristol-Myers Squibb drug for ovarian cancer , instead gave her Platinol , a different cancer_drug . Two years earlier , doctors were about to do exploratory surgery on a Colorado glaucoma patient who had consistently low blood_sugar levels . The night before , they checked her medication and found that she had been given Diabinese , a drug for diabetics , instead of the glaucoma drug , Diamox . Because of her bad vision , she couldn ' t tell them apart on the label . Merck had to rename its ulcer drug Losec to Prilosec because some patients were getting the fluid reduction drug Lasix instead . The confusion was blamed for at least one death . This August , Daniels Pharmaceuticals Inc. promised to change the name of its thyroid drug , Levoxine , because pharmacists were giving people Wellcome ' s heart drug Lanoxin . A nonprofit group , the Institute for Safe Medication Practices in Huntingdon Valley , Pa. , has found hundreds of &quot; mixed-up pairs &quot; and publishes articles warning professionals about them . Its president , Michael Cohen -- a drug-naming consultant -- said doctors can help avoid confusion by typing prescriptions instead of scribbling and indicating what condition a drug is being prescribed to treat , such_as Paxil for depression . Druggists also need to talk more to their customers , he said . &quot; Tell the patient , this is your Seldane , it ' s an antihistamine . If the patient was told to take Feldene for arthritis , they ' ll say , ' Wait a minute. ' &quot; More public awareness of different drugs and what they do would also help , experts say .</TEXT>
