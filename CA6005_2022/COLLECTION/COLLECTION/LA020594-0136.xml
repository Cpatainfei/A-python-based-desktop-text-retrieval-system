   <HEADLINE> STORES WON ' T STOCK MILK OF COWS TREATED WITH HORMONE ; AGRICULTURE : SEVERAL MAJOR GROCERY CHAINS SAY THEY WILL WAIT AND GAUGE CONSUMER SENTIMENT . PROCESSORS SAY THE DRUG IS SAFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Several of the state ' s major supermarket chains said Friday that for now they will not carry products from cows treated with a genetically engineered hormone that makes the animals give more milk . The grocers say they have not taken a stance on the synthetic bovine somatotropin , or BST , but that their suppliers -- dairy cooperatives , creameries and processors -- have told them they will not handle milk coming from dairy_farms where BST will be used . Many say they are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and will take their guidance from consumer reaction . St . Louis-based Monsanto Co . began selling its version of BST for the first time Friday , under the brand name Posilac . The company said first-day sales exceeded its optimistic projections , but opponents of the drug seem to be succeeding in staving_off its use by many dairy_farmers . Two groups are heading the campaign against Posilac . One , the Pure Food Campaign , is an offshoot of the Foundation on Economic Trends , a Washington organization led by Jeremy Rifkin , a longtime opponent of biotechnology and genetic_engineering techniques . The other is Consumers Union , an activist arm of the organization that publishes Consumer Reports magazine . The two groups say they believe the drug is harmful to human health . Other opponents say they fear it will put small , family-operated dairy_farms at an even greater disadvantage against larger , more efficient operations . However , many retailers and processors say they believe the drug is safe and the milk from cows treated with it perfectly harmless . Scientific tests have shown there is no discernible difference between milk from treated and untreated cows . California grocery chains Albertson ' s , Lucky , Ralphs , Stater Bros . and Vons said they will not at this time carry products from cows treated with BST . The nation ' s largest grocery chain , Cincinnati-based Kroger Co. , has also asked its suppliers to provide milk that isn ' t produced with the hormone . In California , the opponents are more active in the northern part of the state , where creameries and cooperatives report being deluged with calls from worried consumers . In the southern part of the state , farmers , creameries and grocery_stores report few or no calls from consumers on the issue . At the San Joaquin Valley Dairymen cooperative , Richard Cotta said , &quot; From our perspective , it ' s a product that has the approval and blessing of everybody in the country who understands ( it ) and knows what ' s going_on , and we just don ' t understand what ' s the big to-do about it. &quot; BST Briefing Facts about the BST hormone that stimulates milk production in cows : * BST stands_for bovine somatotropin , a protein hormone created by the pituitary_gland of cows . Traces of the hormone occur naturally in milk . * Monsanto Co . of St . Louis has created a copy of this hormone by taking a gene from a cow , implanting it in a bacterium and growing it . * The hormone must be injected in cows because it is destroyed when ingested . Increased production begins within a day or two and reaches its peak after six to eight weeks . Cows must be injected every two weeks . * An average cow produces about 1 # 800 gallons of milk a year . By one estimate , BST will increase that figure by about 209 gallons annually . * The Food and Drug Administration , which regulates drugs for people and animals , has found BST safe for both , although some increase in udder infections was associated with the higher milk production . Monsanto , working with the FDA , will conduct a post-approval monitoring_program to check for any unusual increase in infections and antibiotic treatment .</TEXT>
