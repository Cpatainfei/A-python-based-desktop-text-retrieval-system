   <HEADLINE> BOMBING RAID RATCHETS UP CHECHEN FIGHT ; RUSSIA : MOSCOW SEALS OFF REBELLIOUS REGION , GROZNY BRACES FOR WAR , BUT TALKS ARE SCHEDULED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia sealed_off the rebellious Muslim region of Chechnya on Saturday and staged a bombing raid near its capital , Grozny , in a new escalation of the festering conflict that many warn could turn_into another Afghanistan for the Kremlin . President Boris N . Yeltsin , who was laid-up in the hospital after a minor operation on his nose , had effectively instructed his government Friday to proceed without him in &quot; using all means at the state ' s disposal &quot; to subdue the defiant Chechens . Whatever means Moscow uses , whether further negotiations or a full-out attack by the Russian troops massed at Chechnya ' s borders , that will not be easy . The Chechens who populate the mountainous region of southern Russia are known as a tough , warlike people with a penchant for organized_crime , and they have reportedly been reinforced by Moslem brethren from Afghanistan and elsewhere . &quot; I ' m afraid to confess that the situation has already gotten beyond my control , &quot; Dzhokar Dudayev , the moustachioed Chechen president , told Saturday ' s Izvestia newspaper . &quot; In every village , in every district , Islamic batallions have been formed . . . When our general_staff gives them orders , they reply , ' We are God ' s fighters , not yours. ' &quot; Residents of Grozny were said to be bracing for war , beefing_up their civil_defenses and gathering volunteers for grassroots militias . Reuters news_agency reporters saw Russian warplanes bomb military targets near Grozny , and more raids were expected . But Russian analysts predicted that Yeltsin , aware that anti-war sentiment dominates both in Parliament and among the public at_large , would not launch an all-out invasion . Rather , the Izvestia newspaper said , he is likely to perform a &quot; balancing act_on the edge of war &quot; by asserting Russian control without undertaking operations that would lead to mass casualties . Talks between Moscow , Grozny and the Kremlin-backed opposition to Dudayev were scheduled to resume Monday . It was not clear whether Dudayev would consent to talk with his Chechen enemies . But the Russian deputy head of the peace talks commission , Vyacheslav Mikhailov , said Grozny officials had &quot; reiterated in phone conversations their intention to use this last chance to achieve a peaceful solution of the crisis. &quot; The sealing of the Chechen borders aimed to block the continuing flow of arms and Afghan mujaheddin fighters into the mainly Muslim republic of about 1 million people . The Russian government also ordered the Defense Ministry to close_off Chechnya ' s airspace . But along with waving sticks , the Kremlin was offering carrots to Chechnya . The government_issued a decree mandating radical -- though unspecified -- measures to restore parts of the North Caucasus economy damaged in the conflict .</TEXT>
