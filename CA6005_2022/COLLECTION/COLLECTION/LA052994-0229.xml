   <HEADLINE> A STORY OF LOVE AND WAR , DEATH AND PAIN , AND WIDOW ' S COURAGE ; GULF WAR : LAND_MINE KILLED ARMY CPL . J . SCOTT LINDSEY . IN HIS POCKET WERE A LETTER FROM HIS WIFE AND A POEM HE HAD WRITTEN HER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Army Cpl . J . Scott Lindsey died in a final , fatal spasm of the Gulf War , he carried in his pockets the two small books of Scripture his father had taken_to war in Vietnam , two_dollar_bills , a pocketknife , a letter from his wife , and a poem he had written her during desert guard_duty . This girl of my dreams . Her feelings are strong They hold me together Like notes in a song . . . . I awake in a spin My head ' s in a swirl For this is my love My wife , my girl . These few cherished things were packed in a small cardboard box . They reached Debi Lindsey a month later when America was in a self-congratulatory mood , jubilant at the end of a whirlwind war . &quot; There were so few lost -- hurt and killed -- that it was one big friggin ' picnic , &quot; she said as she knelt before a hope_chest filled with the legacy of her husband ' s death -- newspaper_articles , medals , books on the Gulf War . &quot; By July 4th , I thought , if I have to see another parade , I ' ll scream. &quot; Because for Debra Ann Strain Lindsey and her three children -- for the surviving spouses and children of the 293 U.S. servicemen and women who perished in the Persian_Gulf_War of 1990-91 -- this was no painless engagement . Nor was it brief . For them , the war goes_on , an ongoing struggle to adapt to a world without their loved ones -- a world that is suddenly , startlingly civilian , outside the military cocoon . Debi tries . Energetic and lively at 29 , a patient mother , her days fold one into the next , between laundry_baskets and sandwiches , growing her elaborate garden , trying to dodge probing questions that bring her pain . Most weekends , she is visited by the young soldier who tried to save her husband ' s life when he was felled by shrapnel . Two or three times a month , she drives alone to J. ' s grave in nearby Fayetteville , never staying . Just to check . This year , for Memorial_Day , she planned a camping trip in the Grand_Canyon . She used to like the holiday . Before J . died , Memorial_Day meant flying the flag and welcoming summer on the beach . &quot; I was young and stupid , &quot; she said . &quot; Now , it breaks my heart. &quot; * The cease-fire was declared on Feb . 28 , 1991 . On the night of March 3 , a Sunday , Debi Lindsey was at her kitchen_table in Germany , happily turning a sheet into a welcome home banner , when she heard the knock at her door . The military procedure for handling deaths is set_down in precise detail and , per regulation , Debi ' s casualty assistance officer arrived Monday morning to offer condolences and information . Debi would need to learn about benefits and about burial . She was about to be sent home -- wherever that was . &quot; I lost everything , &quot; she said , her voice breaking . &quot; My friends and my family . My house. &quot; A casualty assistance officer can do many things , but he cannot stop the pain . When a soldier dies , family members feel the embrace of the military go slack . Fingers that clutched the security of the fenced life , the certainty of eventually moving_on , the lingo , the purposefulness , the pride , are pried open . The family goes skidding away , thrust back into civilian life on a loose tether of regular checks and access to the post commissary . Despite the enormity of her losses , she seemed to absorb it only in tiny pieces . Four days later , when Debi flew back to America , the horror of the outside world rushed in . A flight_attendant asked , in front of her children , whether her husband was in the cargo hold . She did not answer . * This love_story ' s sad and complicated ending seems all wrong . When they were teen-agers , living_in the lush rural foothills of California ' s Sierra , J . and Debi ' s future brimmed with adventure and promise . He was the youngest of three children in a military family ; his parents named him simply J . Scott . She was the elder of two children ; her father was a letter_carrier , her mother a housewife . J . stopped by one day with his new midnight-blue motorcycle and offered her a ride . Debi was 15 ; he was almost 17 . &quot; It was love , &quot; she said . &quot; I was the first to ride_on his bike , and it went_on from there. &quot; They married in 1983 , as the tulips were coming_up . Then , Debi graduated from high_school and , in August , J . left for Army basic training in Ft . Benning , Ga . When Cole was born that October , his father first saw him in a photograph . All along , Debi had been enchanted with his choice of the Army . &quot; Who doesn ' t want to leave Placerville , California ? &quot; she said brightly . &quot; It was a way to see new and exciting places. &quot; The road map of their eight-year marriage is dotted with tiny apartments and years when they were eligible for food_stamps but declined out of pride . Their first home , in Hawaii , was a filthy two-bedroom apartment where Debi thought she heard termites gnawing_at night . J . departed for training in South_Korea two weeks after she arrived with Cole . A second baby , Cassie , was born Jan . 2 , 1987 . Then came a detour into civilian life , an airline job , and more struggles to make ends meet . J . returned to the Army . &quot; I was glad , &quot; Debi said with a sigh . &quot; It ' s a nice life . This is going_to sound strange : It ' s predictable in its unpredictability. &quot; Military life , among so many different kinds of Americans , had opened her mind . She was proud_of her husband , her friends , herself . J . was accepted back at his old job of mortarman , in_charge of a cannon . Given a choice , they picked a posting to Germany . In the fall of 1988 , he shipped out alone . For a year , they lived apart until he could move his family to base housing . She moved with the children to Colorado Springs , handy to an Army_base , its stores and friends from Hawaii . When at last she reached Gelnhausen , an enchanting medieval town , she found herself in a spotless three-bedroom apartment with friends grouped around a stairwell . After all their hardships , the Lindseys had found happiness . &quot; We finally had a plan and a family , and knew what we wanted to do , &quot; she said . &quot; It was one of the best years of my marriage. &quot; But when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug . 2 , 1990 , a sliver of worry crept into the Lindsey household . Troops went , and then more troops . Soon after the birth of April Janine -- now called A.J. -- on Sept . 19 , 1990 , J . said he wanted to stock up_on desert gear and avoid the rush . He needed sunscreen and a collapsible water canteen . Debi chided him , saying he should be thinking_of baby clothes . She began to fret . The orders came_around Thanksgiving . He would be leaving Dec . 20 . Christmas arrived early around the stairwell . Debi remembers the crumpled wrapping_paper piled_up ahead of schedule in the trash_cans . A night or two before J . left , Debi voiced her doubts . &quot; I didn ' t think they should go . There was so_much , ' It ' s oil , it ' s oil , it ' s oil , ' and it doesn ' t seem something worth dying for. &quot; His tart , hurt reply : &quot; Would you be proud if I died doing my duty ? &quot; * Less than a month after J. ' s death , Debi Lindsey landed with her children in Springdale , in Arkansas ' northwest corner . She came here because the cost_of_living was low , because her in-laws live here , and they had bought J . and Debi an 80-acre farm , though it eventually was sold . And , of course , because this is where she buried her husband . &quot; And for lack of a better idea , &quot; she added . Springdale , population 33 # 000 , is one of those protean boom_towns not yet sure what it will become -- strip shopping_centers and malls alternate with farms and feed and grain lots , and housing_developments bump_up against millionaire spreads . &quot; You just feel very isolated , alone , &quot; Debi said . &quot; Nobody understands . Nobody ' s in the military . I felt very conspicuous at first. &quot; Everyone seemed to know her . A visit to any store in town exposed her to curiosity . &quot; Everybody . . . and their mothers , and their mothers-in-law . They just asked what happened . A short , curt answer just wasn ' t enough. &quot; News_reports had thrust Debi into the hot light of unwanted celebrity . Knots of reporters greeted her at airports . Then came the deluge of sympathy_cards and letters from strangers , in nearly every one a check . Thousands of dollars , about $ 8 # 000 she thinks , paid_for a car and two pairs of bunk_beds for the kids . The money astonished her . &quot; At first , I couldn ' t fathom why they were doing_it , &quot; she said , &quot; until I realized they wanted to do something to help and this is what they could think of. &quot; Her family now lives_in a four-bedroom , ranch-style house of yellow brick and blue-green shutters near the bottom of a cul-de-sac . It was a steal at $ 69 # 000 . Debi is filling it with found furniture and modest antiques . The front and back yards bloom with flowers and children ' s toys , a slide and wading pool . In all that space , Debi has not found a good place for the flag she was given on March 11 , 1991 , the day she buried her husband at Fayetteville National Cemetery , 10 miles to the south . &quot; I haven ' t found a home for it where it doesn ' t leap_out at me , &quot; she said . At first , she wrapped the flag in a baby blanket and stuffed it deep in a closet . Last year , she put it in a triangular wood-and-glass case . First , it hung_in her bedroom . Then , in the hall . Now , it ' s on a living room wall , above a construction-paper flag her daughter Cassie made in kindergarten . Pictures of J . are displayed on nearby bookshelves . They show a handsome , mustachioed young_man with a taut , wiry build . He seems self-conscious , almost stern , even when tenderly cradling one of his babies . It ' s only in uniform that he smiles , actually glows . Here , grinning in a face smeared with camouflage paint ; there , carefree in his battle helmet . In death , J . Scott Lindsey was awarded a Bronze_Star and promoted to sergeant . In the Fayetteville cemetery , he lies alone , the only Gulf War casualty , surrounded by veterans of World_War_II , men who ripened into their 70s and 80s . * Cole , now 10 and in a fourth-grade class for gifted children , misses Germany , misses Hawaii , misses his dad . Freckles may skip across his nose , but he is no light-hearted boy . Soft-spoken , he sits alone plunking on an electronic keyboard , drawing a dragon , cocking an ear to adult talk . &quot; When I go_to my friends ' house and they have a dad and they do fun things , I feel kind of left out , &quot; he said . At 7 , Cassie is wary and restless , her long blond hair ragged , like raw silk . Her mother says Cassie gets angry sometimes . &quot; She ' ll say ' How come I don ' t have a dad ? ' and I ' ll explain , ' He still loves you. ' &quot; A.J. is too young to remember her father . The 3-year-old beams ; a natural mischief-maker , she interrupts adult conversation by biting her big_sister ' s bottom on the stairs of their wading-pool slide . It ' s tough rearing kids without their father , but financially at least the family is doing_better than ever . J. ' s life_insurance was a big help , and Debi manages now without working , on $ 22 # 000 a year assembled from a military widow ' s pension and Social_Security . In Germany , J . supported his family on $ 14 # 400 a year . Debi has seven years left to tap military education benefits and is just now thinking_about taking_up Spanish , learning horticulture . Her marriage_bed remains in the garage with boxes and boxes of J. ' s things , including his drum set . For three years , she slept on the couch until it broke ; now , she stays in the master_bedroom , on two children ' s mattresses . And now there is Cpl . Jim Starr , who most weekends drives the 487 miles from Ft . Hood in Killeen , Tex . He writes poetry , wants to return to silk-screen printing when he gets_out of the military , and maybe start_out as a security_guard . He first turned_up just before Memorial_Day , 1992 , to tell the story of how J . died . &quot; I felt the family needed an explanation of what happened , &quot; he said . &quot; Things get tangled up in translation. &quot; His friendship with Debi became a necessity . &quot; At first , it was to help me ease the way I felt . I kind of felt guilty . Alone , &quot; he said . Out of uniform , he began to cry . &quot; I just came_to see her because I felt that I should . I don ' t know. &quot; The worst day in their lives cements them in a bond they seem not to understand , but they accept it . They may even marry . &quot; People grow on you , &quot; he said . &quot; It seems dumb to be lonely the rest of your life , &quot; Debi said , staring at her slender gold wedding_band . &quot; If someone makes you happy , it can ' t be bad. &quot; She calls him Starr . Only 25 , his face is still boyish . But a look of constant pain pinches his eyes . J . was his boss in the three-man mortar squad , operating a cannon in an open vehicle called a track . They were in northern Iraq . Despite the cease-fire , they did not relax . The sun was going_down when a vehicle to the right of J. ' s ran_over a mine , a killer shaped like a small round cookie tin . Starr said it was left by U.S. forces , though the Army could not confirm this . The other vehicle was shielded by its armored underside , but shrapnel flew at the track . &quot; My hands were bleeding , &quot; Starr said . &quot; We looked_up_to see J . He was laying_down on the floor. &quot; Starr swallowed , barely able to speak . Seated at a picnic table in the back yard of Debi ' s house , children playing_around him , he trembled in the hot Arkansas sun . &quot; It just looked_like maybe he had been knocked_out . I ' m just holding_on to his neck , trying to control the bleeding. &quot; Starr was shaking . &quot; He passed_away before the helicopter got there. &quot; * In a videotape taken by a soldier in the desert , J . Scott Lindsey stands_in a shower_stall , a makeshift open-air amenity with a roof and modesty panels . A shower head dribbles water in a slow stream . J . is grinning as he reaches up_to the shower head , rubs his wet head , his smiling wet face . He turns his back to the camera and the desert-browned and muscular shoulders ripple and shimmer . Back still turned , he raises his left hand , and waves . &quot; On your darkest nights , remember it is the same sky above me , &quot; Debi Lindsey had written her husband on paper trimmed with flowers and lacy loops . &quot; I will search the heavens until I find your doubts and I will take what I can away to comfort you . &quot; When you lay_down to sleep each night , watch for me in the twinkling stars , I hear they are beautiful in the desert . My love for you will be up there , looking down on you each night . I promise it . She signed it : &quot; Your girl. &quot;</TEXT>
