   <HEADLINE> SIMI VALLEY TOPS LIST OF SAFEST U.S. CITIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This suburban community was the safest U.S. city with a population of at least 100 # 000 last year , marking the fourth time in five years that a municipality in eastern Ventura County has topped the nation ' s list of safe larger cities , according to FBI statistics released Sunday . Thousand Oaks , which ranked first in 1989-91 , was third in 1993 , FBI crime and population figures show , and the Los Angeles County suburb of Santa Clarita ranked fourth . In displacing Amherst Town , N.Y. , as the safest urban_area , Simi Valley ' s serious crime fell 18.4 % in 1993 because of citizen involvement , a surge in arrests of drug_users and a police crackdown on theft rings from the San Fernando Valley , officials said . &quot; It ' s nice to be recognized again as the safest city in America , &quot; said Mayor Greg Stratton , noting previous designations in the mid-1980s . &quot; It restores ( our reputation ) that we have a really great place to live and do business , where you can still walk the streets at night. &quot; Simi Valley ' s image was tarnished in 1992 after a jury sitting at the East County_Courthouse found four Los Angeles police_officers not_guilty in the beating of Rodney G . King , sparking the Los Angeles riots . A recent fatal schoolyard stabbing of a 14-year-old boy heightened fears about youth crime in Simi Valley . But the FBI statistics put residents ' growing fear of crime in a different perspective , Stratton said . &quot; Our crime totals are back to where they were five or six years ago , &quot; the mayor said . &quot; I think a lot of what we ' ve seen has been a wash-over from the opening of the freeway to Los Angeles . People started to realize there was this nice place called Simi Valley that was fresh pickings . We started to get a lot of out-of-town criminals. &quot; Reported major crime grew steadily to 3 # 547 offenses in 1992 , or 34 per 1 # 000 residents . But last year the total dropped to 2 # 892 , or 27.8 per 1 # 000 , because of sharp drops_in burglary , theft and auto theft . Even violent offenses -- already extremely low -- declined slightly to 257 , with no murders . Police said that three or four San Fernando Valley theft rings were busted last year , which alone could have resulted in hundreds fewer crimes . In a similar situation two years ago , Camarillo police attributed 600 thefts to two Van Nuys gang members . Simi Valley Police_Chief Willard Schlieter said the 1993 improvement could be the result of many_more arrests by a street narcotics unit that was doubled to six officers . An expanded anti-gang patrol also helped , he said . &quot; It ' s the overall street visibility , &quot; Schlieter said . &quot; And part of it is the nature of this community . It ' s not so_much an affluent community that wants to buy its way_out of crime , it ' s a community that really wants to get involved in fighting crime. &quot; Neighborhood Watch groups are expanding , he said . Thousand Oaks , which each year vies with Simi Valley for low-crime bragging rights , also had a drop_in crime overall , from 3 # 374 to 3 # 276 incidents . &quot; We ' re fortunate that we have an overall reduction , &quot; said Cmdr . Kathy Kemp of the Ventura County Sheriff ' s Department , which is under contract to patrol the city . &quot; And we had a relatively small increase in violent crime . But the type of crime is a concern because it ' s by our youth -- it ' s gang members. &quot; Confrontations between teen-agers increasingly end in violence , she said . In February , two Westlake High_School students were wounded in an after-school fight at a park . Two of the four youths charged with assault and illegally discharging a firearm are gang members . A communitywide anti-crime symposium on Saturday will address the problem of rising youth violence in Thousand Oaks , Kemp said . But she said the community remains relatively crime-free because of the extraordinary involvement of residents in Neighborhood Watch . Oxnard , Ventura County ' s largest city and one of its poorest , had a crime_rate about average for the nation last year . But its crimes per 1 # 000 fell from 67.3 to 58.1 in 1993 -- the most dramatic decrease in the county . Overall , Ventura County had a crime_rate of 38.3 per 1 # 000 residents last year , down about 9 % and better than the nationwide 3 % decrease , the FBI reported . Other low crime_rates in California included Irvine ' s 40 crimes per 1 # 000 residents , Fremont ' s 40.6 per 1 # 000 , Sunnyvale ' s 41.4 per 1 # 000 and Glendale ' s 44.4 per 1 # 000 . Of the state ' s 10 largest cities , San Jose had the lowest crime_rate , 45.7 crimes per 1 # 000 , while Santa Ana had 64.2 per 1 # 000 . Oakland had the highest rate among the largest California cities , with 117 crimes per 1 # 000 residents , followed by Fresno , 115 per 1 # 000 ; Sacramento , 104 per 1 # 000 ; San Francisco , 90 per 1 # 000 ; Los Angeles , 88 per 1 # 000 ; Long_Beach , 81 per 1 # 000 and San Diego , 74 per 1 # 000 . San Bernardino had the highest rate among all_the state ' s cities with more_than 100 # 000 residents -- 132 crimes per 1 # 000 residents .</TEXT>
