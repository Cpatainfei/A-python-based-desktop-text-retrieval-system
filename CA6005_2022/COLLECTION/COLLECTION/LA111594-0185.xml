   <HEADLINE> IRAQ MAKES OFFICIAL ITS RENUNCIATION OF KUWAIT CLAIMS ; PERSIAN_GULF : DEPUTY PREMIER GIVES DOCUMENTS TO U.S. AMBASSADOR AT UNITED NATIONS . BUT SANCTIONS REMAIN IN FORCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a brief and cold professional exchange , Iraqi Deputy Prime_Minister Tarik Aziz on Monday handed American Ambassador Madeleine Albright a packet of legal_documents giving_up all_of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ' s claims to the territory of Kuwait . The documents -- an official recognition of Kuwait and its territorial integrity -- pleased the Security_Council , but not enough for it to lift the sanctions on Iraq . After members completed their bimonthly review of the sanctions , Albright , who is serving as president of the council this month , told reporters that the Security_Council had decided to continue the sanctions &quot; without change. &quot; That was no surprise . The real battle over sanctions within the Security_Council is not expected to take_place for another six months . The meeting between Aziz and Albright , which lasted no more_than two minutes , was the first between Cabinet-level officials of the two governments since former Secretary_of_State James A . Baker III conferred_with Aziz before the start of the Persian_Gulf_War , a war fought because of Iraq ' s invasion and annexation of Kuwait . Albright , however , insisted that she was meeting Aziz only in her capacity as council president . In fact , her spokesman , James P . Rubin , said that she had betrayed her role as American ambassador only by wearing a brooch in the form of a snake . That was her way of thumbing her nose at Iraqi poet Ghazi Thai and at the government-run newspaper , Al Iraq . Al Iraq recently published rhymed couplets by the poet in both English and Arabic that heaped scorn on Albright , blamed her for the sanctions and likened her to a snake . &quot; Albright , Albright , &quot; the poem said , &quot; why do you hate the day and love the night ? &quot; American officials refused to let photographers into the brief Aziz-Albright meeting in the small office of the council president outside the main chamber of the Security_Council . But an American official , describing the session for reporters , said that Aziz &quot; did not seem his ebullient self &quot; and that Albright &quot; was very professional. &quot; After the session with Aziz , Albright , aside from passing_out the Iraqi documents , also handed each ambassador aerial photos of reconstructed government buildings and official residences in Iraq as evidence that Hussein , while accusing the United Nations of depriving his people of food with sanctions , is lavishing $ 1.2 billion on luxurious working space and living quarters for the ruling_class . &quot; If they have enough money to build these pleasure palaces , &quot; an American official told reporters , &quot; . . . they ought to have enough money to provide additional services and goods to their people . &quot; I know you all feel_like snickering , &quot; the official said to reporters , &quot; but this is to rebut the charge . . . that the Security_Council and the United States are responsible_for the suffering of the Iraqi people. &quot; This accusation , he said , is even believed by some people in the United States . He said that Albright recently received a broom from an American who called her a witch and blamed her for the suffering in Iraq . In a letter of reply , Albright , who has kept the broom in her office , told the writer that the real culprit is Hussein , a leader who does not care about his people . Aziz dismissed the American outrage over the buildings as &quot; rubbish. &quot; &quot; Every government has a palace for its head_of_state , &quot; he said , &quot; and Iraq is a country of great builders . . . . The national palace is a symbol of the nation . . . and we are proud that all_the sites that were bombed ( in the Gulf War ) have been rebuilt. &quot; The distribution of the photos seemed to strike some ambassadors as somewhat histrionic . When asked about them , French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee laughed and said , &quot; It is an interesting display of photographs , but it has nothing to do with the sanctions. &quot; After turning_over the documents , Aziz told reporters that it is time for &quot; the council to honor its own resolutions &quot; and lift the sanctions . But there is no support in the Security_Council for an immediate lifting of sanctions . The Russian and French ambassadors have suggested that the council_members consider lifting the sanctions on the Iraqi sale of oil if the Hussein government cooperates fully , for six months , with a system of U.N. monitoring designed to make_sure that it does not resume its programs of building weapons of mass destruction . Although the resolution covering this appears to provide_for the lifting of sanctions whenever Iraq has eliminated such weapons and accepted a system of monitoring , the Clinton_Administration insists that , no matter what the small print of the resolution states , no sanctions of any kind should be lifted until Iraq complies with all U.N. resolutions and thus satisfies the council_members of its peaceful intentions .</TEXT>
