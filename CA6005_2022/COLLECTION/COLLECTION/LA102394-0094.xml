   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; VENICE ' S WILD RIDE ; QUIRKY COMMUNITY CONSIDERS ANOTHER SEA CHANGE IN ITS TUMULTUOUS EXISTENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Venice draws life from poets and performers , bodybuilders and bohemians , but the seaside community owes its existence to a coin toss . Ninety years ago , Abbot Kinney , a tobacco tycoon and budding Los Angeles land developer , lost confidence in his Westside business partners . In what is now south Santa Monica , the partners had developed a commercial district and pioneered the Southland ' s first successful amusement business -- the Ocean Park Amusement Pier . But Kinney felt stymied by his associates ' unwillingness to support his more grandiose plans . So after months of bickering , Kinney and his fellow officers of the Ocean Park Development Co . sat_down in January of 1904 and flipped a coin to divide their holdings . Kinney won the toss and -- to the shock of his partners -- chose to take_control of a 1.5-mile stretch of salt marshes south of Navy Street instead of the far more valuable developed Ocean Park land . In the coastal dunes and wetlands , Kinney saw the potential for a new Pacific city of Old_World charm . Using his own money , the canny entrepreneur built Venice of America within 19 months , a resort community of canals and gondolas , of pavilions and cafes that soon rivaled Ocean Park and its pier . Wild rides and sideshows soon followed . &quot; Imagine , &quot; said 83-year-old Al Arnold , who has lived_in the same Venice house near the oceanfront for 77 years . &quot; When you got_to the beach , you found spectacular rides -- heart-stoppers -- dance_halls , a gigantic indoor saltwater plunge , two roller_coasters , fun houses . It was a regular circus. &quot; It was a stunning creation that transformed an idle backwater into one of the world ' s largest entertainment playgrounds and set the tone for a community that to this day has continued to reinvent itself . For 90 years , waves of builders , hustlers , dreamers , vaudevillians , poets and promoters have washed through the community , creating a place that has thrived on all creeds and attitudes , celebrated the_sublime and worshiped the ridiculous . As present-day Venice agonizes over plans to renovate its popular oceanfront boardwalk , those with long local histories may feel more_than a small sense of deja_vu . The most publicized proposal , calling_for brick paving , antique lighting , designated performance areas and more , is backed by merchants and property_owners concerned about competition from Santa Monica ' s Third Street Promenade , the Universal CityWalk and Pasadena ' s Old Town district . The plan has stirred strong opposition from many residents , activists and street performers concerned that commercially driven renovation might stifle the boardwalk ' s freewheeling spirit . They have offered an alternative plan . * The renovation efforts can hardly be considered novel . Venice is very much the product of self-promotion . In its early years , the community constantly made and remade itself , locked_in a struggle with competing attractions . that ' s why , for some , the prospect of a modern day make-over sounds familiar . &quot; In a way , the ( commercial ) ghosts of the past have come_back to haunt Venice and kept alive this constant struggle for definition , &quot; said Elayne Alexander , an archivist and historian at the Venice Historical Society . &quot; Nothing ' s really changed. &quot; Venice , to be sure , has not always been given to promotional campaigns . In recent decades , in fact , its appeal has been largely laissez-faire , as a quirky anything-goes outpost for the Beats_in the 1950s , hippies in the 1960s and ' 70s and New Agers now . But under Kinney , the making and remaking of Venice was nothing if not deliberate -- and always commercially driven . Using massive amounts of daring and showmanship , he created Venice of America , a sort of precursor to Disneyland , and lured the public away from the Ocean Park Amusement Pier owned by his former partners . Jeffrey Stanton , a local Venice historian , in his book &quot; Venice , California -- Coney_Island of the Pacific , &quot; has meticulously documented the struggle that followed between Kinney and the other real_estate interests seeking to develop the beachfront . Kinney and his competitors anchored their resort communities with amusement piers and warred against each other for the attention of immigrants hungry for entertainment . Overnight , the coast from Redondo Beach to Santa Monica mushroomed into an entertainment complex , jam-packed with wharves , mind-boggling rides , international restaurants and carny concessions . * During the highly competitive period of 1903-1920 , Kinney , the Doge of Venice , reigned supreme over the growing amusement_park scene . His Venice of America was the crown_jewel of the oceanfront , or as one vintage postcard series of photos proclaimed , &quot; The Capitol of Joyland. &quot; Santa Monica Bay ' s pristine beaches had become accessible to the general public in 1877 thanks to a growing network of rail_lines emanating out across the Los Angeles Basin from Pasadena , the Santa Fe Railway ' s most westerly passenger terminus . Los Angeles residents , beckoned by the cheap fares , flocked to the ocean on weekends and during the summer tourist season . Said Al Arnold ' s 89-year-old brother Arch : &quot; People came from all_over , riding the Pacific Electric ' s Red Cars . They were hanging_out the windows like they were_on their way to the Promised Land . Kinney even had a monkey farm on the end of the pier , an aquarium full of seals and sea_lions . Venice was quite the place . There was something for everyone. &quot; Kinney had as his centerpiece the startling Midway Plaisance . Located alongside the Venice Grand Lagoon ( now the Venice traffic_circle ) , it was a collection of amusements that included camel rides , freak shows and foreign exhibits from the attendance-breaking 1906 Columbian Exposition in St . Louis . His nearest competitors -- former partners Alexander Fraser , G.M. Jones and H.R. Gage -- were able to make life hard for Kinney ' s enterprise . As bosses of the Ocean Park section of Santa Monica , which had jurisdiction over Kinney ' s property , they used their influence to delay his building_permits , limit his business hours and block his requests for public_services . Their tactics , however , only strengthened Kinney ' s desire to win Venice ' s independence from Ocean Park . He counterattacked by adding more attractions to his pier -- animal exhibits , a ballroom and special events , including a performance featuring actress Sarah Bernhardt . He doubled the size of his Ship Cafe ( shaped like a boat ) , and began construction on an indoor hot saltwater plunge just west of the property now occupied by the Sidewalk Cafe . The Ocean Park powers forbade Kinney to complete the plunge ( it was in competition with Ocean Park ' s Bath House ) and scheduled the illegally constructed building foundations to be dynamited on June 10 , 1907 . That morning , Kinney ' s wife , Margaret , mobilized the &quot; Pick &amp; Shovel &quot; civic club and staged a sit-in with 200 women and children who picnicked atop the foundations . By noon the dynamiters had departed . Kinney pressed_on with his plans and the plunge opened June 21 , 1908 . On peak days , it accommodated 2 # 000 bathers and required 11 lifeguards . &quot; We ' d go_in the back_door , ' bargain prices ' it was called , &quot; said Liz Howland Smith , 68 , a lifelong Venice resident who spent many days at the plunge as a youth . &quot; We didn ' t use their towels or their showers . We wore scratchy wool bathing_suits with buttons down the front , rubber caps . The old people would sit next to the fountain where the hot water came_out . It was , when you look_back at it , all very therapeutic. &quot; * Soon after , Kinney quickened his promotional pace , adding an aquarium on his amusement pier that historian Stanton says contained &quot; the finest collection of marine specimens on the West Coast. &quot; Kinney had the &quot; Venice Scenic Railroad &quot; built alongside Ocean Front Walk , a ride that took a roller coaster-style journey with a brakeman aboard . In January , 1911 , he installed a Ferris wheel -- the first on the West Coast -- purchased from the Seattle-Yukon Exposition . On Zephyr Street , alongside Ocean Front Walk , promoters opened a &quot; Captive Balloon Ride , &quot; a hydrogen-filled balloon tethered to a 1 # 400-foot-long cable . In March , the &quot; Merry Widow &quot; opened , a ride of tilting , swirling cups . And soon after , at the entrance to his pier , a water ride was installed . Called the &quot; Rapids , &quot; it was immediately inundated by a public eager to be tumbled for fun . On May 29 , 1911 , Abbot Kinney ' s Italian-style , canal-lined real_estate development finally became the city of Venice . Venetian voters approved Kinney ' s cityhood proposal , ending his six-year-long struggle to transform his Italian dream into an American reality . Cityhood gave Kinney the freedom to compete more creatively and with less interference . But Kinney ' s competition did not rest . On June 17 , 1911 , Fraser and his Ocean Park partners , eager to counter Kinney ' s growing success , opened their new 1 # 250-foot-long Million Dollar Pier in Ocean Park . Its showpiece was the &quot; Grand_Canyon Electric Railroad , &quot; which ran_out over the water along the end of the pier . In the middle of the pier stood a 135-foot-tall mountain covered with electric_lights that at night looked_like an exploding volcano . Fraser ' s pier had a revolving cafe , a dance_hall , ice_cream parlors and numerous attractions , including a futuristic exhibit of incubators for newborns . It also had a Crooked House , a maze-like structure that Stanton says was an &quot; early fun house. &quot; Near the Ocean Park Amusement Pier , Frazer installed an Auto Maze ride , a forerunner of bumper_cars . Margaret Kinney died on June 30 , 1911 , six years to the day after she had turned_on the electric_lights of her husband ' s Venice of America development . Five days later , on the Fourth_of_July , Kinney opened the world ' s largest roller_coaster , &quot; Race Thru the Clouds , &quot; which became the ride sensation of the season . * Then tragedy struck the rival pier to the north : On Sept . 3 , 1912 , Fraser ' s Million Dollar Pier caught_fire and burned to the ground . Young children , trapped and confused in the Crooked House , perished in the fire . Yet Ocean Park bounced_back from the tragedy , outlining plans to rebuild a fire-proof cement pier by 1913 . And the promotions and counter-promotions continued , with Kinney and his competitors using every imaginable ploy to get people to take the trolley to the beach . In 1913 , the city of Venice fielded a baseball_team that played in the major_leagues for three years . Soon after , the Grand Prix road race was created , running_along the Venice Speedway to Playa del Rey and back . And Mack Sennett ' s Keystone Film Co . began holding bathing beauty parades along the Venice oceanfront . The pier was a very lively place , said Al Arnold . &quot; People were gamblin ' on the . . . floors of the Ship ' s Cafe , diving off the pier for money , getting_married in the sea . The scene in Venice was known ( everywhere ) . And I should know , I worked in the merchant_marine and saw the enthusiasm for Venice worldwide. &quot; After years of spectacular success that saw the rebuilding of Fraser ' s pier , expansion of Abbot Kinney ' s pier , Hindu fakirs , sword swallowers , operas and electric trams , the oceanfront complex finally started to show some cracks . On Nov . 4 , 1920 , Abbot Kinney died of lung_cancer . Six weeks later , the Kinney pier , with all_of its innumerable attractions , was destroyed by fire . &quot; I can remember the night ( it ) burned_down , &quot; said 83-year-old Frank Watson , a Venice native and resident . &quot; We lived_on Indiana , and went_down to the oceanfront at Brooks Avenue to watch . I can still hear the seals screaming . It was a quarter of a mile away . They were in a big tank and the water began to boil . Burning embers were falling_in the water , hissing . It was awful. &quot; * For Venice , it had been a long , strange ride , from being the rage to almost being razed . After Kinney died , the city , long plagued by problems of canal water circulation , Santa Monica sewage runoff and beachfront pollution , chose annexation in 1925 with the city of Los Angeles as a solution to its problems . Some saw the move as the beginning of the community ' s downfall . &quot; Everyone hoped annexation would solve the problems but the city of L.A. did nothing to help , &quot; Watson said . &quot; They filled_in the canals , which caused still other problems ; and those they didn ' t fill_in , they abandoned. &quot; Today , Venice ' s Ocean Front Walk stands as one of the Southland ' s most popular tourist destinations , attracting more_than 3 million visitors annually . But recent years have proved unsettling . A lingering recession has frayed nerves among oceanfront merchants and street performers . Gang_fights and drug dealing have upset residents . And rival attractions in the Los Angeles area have posed intense competition . It is against this backdrop that the community is debating plans for another make-over , which would be financed with $ 10 million in park bond funds approved by voters in 1992 . Arch Arnold speculated on what Kinney would have done : &quot; Why not build something that will generate income , like a roller_coaster ? A dance_hall would still be a hell of an attraction. &quot;</TEXT>
