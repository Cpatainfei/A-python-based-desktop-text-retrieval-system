   <HEADLINE> THERE ' S SILVER LINING FOR KWAN ; GOODWILL GAMES : SKATER OUTPERFORMS BONALY AND OTHERS IN FREESTYLE TO TAKE SECOND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michelle Kwan celebrated a birthday one month ago today , but she is still so very young -- young enough that when her coach , Frank Carroll , told her the cliche Saturday morning about the tough getting going when the going gets_tough , it did not sound like a cliche to her . It sounded like inspiration , which she needed after floundering in her technical program on the opening day of the Goodwill Games women ' s figure_skating competition Friday and finding herself in sixth place among eight skaters . But , displaying poise beyond her 14 years , she returned to the Yubileiny Sports Palace on Saturday to give one of the best performances of her young career . She defeated World Championships silver-medalist and four-time European champion Surya Bonaly and everyone else in the freestyle program to vault to second place overall behind the 21-year-old Frenchwoman . &quot; This is a new little notch in her belt , beating Surya in the free , &quot; said Carroll , who coaches Kwan , of Torrance , at Lake Arrowhead ' s International Ice Castles . Then , unable to maintain his usual restraint , Carroll added , &quot; Yes ! &quot; Bonaly , who has been working temporarily with Carroll this summer at Lake Arrowhead , gave him nothing to exclaim about , at least not positively . When she committed to appear in this competition , she hinted that she would use it as an opportunity to become the first woman to land a quadruple jump . But even after finishing first in the technical program , she said that she would be lucky to remain upright on her double and triple jumps Saturday . She stood_up , but , otherwise , there was not much in her program to scintillate the crowd of about 3 # 500 in the 7 # 000-seat arena . Dissatisfied with her skating boots , she wore one from a new pair and one from an old pair and had difficulty keeping balance . The only reason she was able to finish second in the freestyle program , which counts toward two-thirds of the final score , and hold_on to first place overall is because the others who had a chance to unseat her skated as poorly or worse . The seven judges had a hard_time sorting_out the mess , not unusual for a mid-summer competition . About the only thing they could agree upon is that the other two Americans , Nicole Bobek of Chicago and Elaine Zayak of Paramus , N.J. , belonged in the seventh and eight places . No woman scored higher than a 5.7 , on a 6.0 scale , for technical merit or artistic impression . Besides Kwan and Bonaly , two Russians , Maria Butyrskaya , who finished third overall , and Olga Markova , who was fourth , also received first-place votes for their freestyle programs . Kwan won that phase of the competition because she also had three second-place votes and a third . Then there was an inexplicable sixth from an Estonian judge . &quot; I don ' t think he knows one jump from another , &quot; Carroll said . One of only three women who did not fall , Kwan had the most technically demanding program as she attempted , and landed , seven triple jumps . But Carroll was even more impressed with the mature presentation of her new freestyle program , skated to music by Saint-Saens . It is her first classically oriented long program after going_with lighter , bouncier fare in the past . She also is improving at selling her performance , something that she said she has learned from watching Olympic champion Oksana Baiul of Ukraine . Kwan smiled whenever she remembered that she was supposed to Saturday and blew a kiss to the crowd when she finished . She still has difficulty putting her performances into perspective for reporters , but the high-five she gave her father , Danny , in the hallway afterward said it all . Carroll was at least equally enthused , but said he does not want to get carried_away . It would be easy to do . Before Kwan ' s 14th birthday , she had finished first in the junior world championships , first in the U.S. Olympic Festival and second in the national championships . Now , she has a freestyle victory over Bonaly and a silver medal from the Goodwill Games . Goodwill Notes Lisa Leslie scored 24 points as the U.S. women ' s basketball_team rolled to a 105-73 victory over China to advance to the women ' s basketball final . Dawn Staley added 21 , Ruthie Bolton-Holifield had 15 and Sheryl Swoopes scored 11 . The U.S. women , seeking their first gold medal in major international competition since 1990 , face France in Sunday ' s final . The French , led by Isabelle Fijalkowski with 20 points , defeated Russia , 80-73 , in the other semifinal . . . . Chinese divers won gold and bronze in the women ' s 10-meter platform diving . Xiong Min won with more_than 429 points . Mary Ellen Clark of the United States was second with Deng Yong third . . . . American Ruth Davidon won the gold medal in the women ' s 500-meter single sculls . The men ' s 500 singles sculls also went_to an American , Jason Gailes .</TEXT>
