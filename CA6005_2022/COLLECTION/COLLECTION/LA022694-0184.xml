   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : BURBANK ; RULES EASED TO REPAIR DAMAGED STRUCTURES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The owners of 14 buildings in Burbank that remain uninhabitable after the Northridge earthquake will not need to meet zoning code requirements or get approval by the city ' s planning_board because of action the city took this week . Reconstruction of the buildings , which had damage to 50 % or more of their structures , will be approved by administrative review instead of through a public process . The goal is to make_it easier for owners of older buildings to rebuild when they do not meet existing zoning code requirements such_as those for parking or open space . However , reconstruction work would have to meet current building and safety codes . Sprinkler_systems would be necessary to meet fire_codes and disabled access would have to be ensured . &quot; We didn ' t want these buildings just patched back together , &quot; said Bob Tague , the city ' s redevelopment director . Having the administrative review ensures that the buildings are rebuilt properly , he said . Usually , any building that has to be rebuilt by 50 % or more would also have to follow zoning requirements . After the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake , the city of Burbank had declared 22 buildings uninhabitable . Another 160 were classified as having limited access . Since then , the list of uninhabitable buildings has dropped , with some taken_off the list as further inspections showed the buildings were safe and others were repaired . The 14 buildings on the list now include three apartment_buildings , four office_buildings , six homes and an animal hospital . The City_Council also extended for six months a waiver of building_permit fees for all earthquake-damaged buildings . That amount is typically about 1 % of the total construction cost , said Bruce Feng , city building inspector . By eliminating the public review process to rebuild the uninhabitable buildings , the owners can potentially save several thousand dollars , Tague said . ED BOND</TEXT>
