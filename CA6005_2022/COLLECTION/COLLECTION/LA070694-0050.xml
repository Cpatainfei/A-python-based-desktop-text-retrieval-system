   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : ROUND OF 16 ; SPOTLIGHT ; SACCHI IS RIGHT AS LONG AS HE WINS , BUT IF HE LOSES . . .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of those attending Tuesday ' s Italy-Nigeria game was former Italian national team striker Giorgio Chinaglia , who is working as a color commentator for Italian radio . A New York Cosmos star in the days of the late , lamented North_American Soccer League offered this observation on the tournament : &quot; The only negative thing , I think , has been my country.The Italians , they have been a disappointment so far . Let ' s hope that today against Nigeria something better happens . &quot; Nigeria is not a team to underestimate . They are a little naive , especially on defense . But we ' ve seen them play in the African ( Nations ) Cup , which they won , and most of their players do play in Europe , so we know who they are . Their strength is their technical skill and their physical strength . But our players , unfortunately , are all midgets up front . &quot; Italy doesn ' t click as a team , and I think the coach ( Arrigo Sacchi ) is not putting the players in the right position . For instance , ( Giuseppe ) Signori , the top goal scorer in the Italian League the last two years , plays midfield or back . He ' s got_to be up front . That is a logical thing . &quot; But he ( Sacchi ) has his own ideas and until he loses , we ' ve got_to say , ' OK. ' When he loses , then we can jump_on him. &quot; GRAHAME L . JONES</TEXT>
