   <HEADLINE> FASHION ; HUMBLE T-SHIRT EMERGES TO MAKE BOLD STATEMENT ; ONCE JUST AN ORDINARY PIECE OF CLOTHING , IT NOW IS A BEARER OF MESSAGES THAT RANGE FROM THE SERIOUS TO THE RIDICULOUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are many forms of self-expression : theater , dance , music , T-shirts . Yes , this garment has in a_few short decades evolved from benign underwear to a fashion statement / personal billboard that offers public voice to the common_man . ( And the common woman , of course ; but women prefer not to think_of themselves in those terms. ) Oh , pundits still write letters to the editor . The conversion-bound hand_out Scripture on the streets . And pallid students still gather_in stark coffeehouses to read existential verse . But , might they only realize : There is no medium as sweet as bold letters on one ' s chest . That Americans should launch this form of communication seems fitting after long years of toting banners to proclaim their feelings , such_as &quot; Don ' t Tread_on Me &quot; or &quot; Down With Demon Rum ! &quot; Indeed , one of the earliest recorded T-shirt slogans was political . &quot; Dew it with Dewey , &quot; was emblazoned on shirts in 1948 for presidential candidate Thomas E . Dewey , a man who was at least aphoristically ahead of his time . Had he become President , Mr. D might have brought the fad to fruition sooner . As it was , Harry Truman did nothing whatsoever to promote T-shirt expression , instead popularizing gaudy Hawaiian leisure_wear . But in spite of this setback , the message T-shirt has made_it into popular culture and has evolved to include diverse current themes . Protest is still one of these , especially as adopted by the eco-hip . &quot; Save the Whales &quot; is a favored motto of the genre . This particular plea has been around long enough to produce spinoffs , such_as &quot; Save the Males &quot; and the newly coined &quot; Save the Ales , &quot; although there is no indication what might be threatening malted_liquor . Possibly tea drinking . Observing shirts , one notes that protest itself is becoming better humored , from the well-known &quot; Stop the Violins &quot; and &quot; Visualize Whirled Peas &quot; to the whimsical &quot; Free the Bound Periodicals ! &quot; Other shirts promote bonding with ones peers . These include feminist Tees ( &quot; Anonymous was a Woman &quot; ) and macho Tees ( &quot; The First Rule of Manhood : Never Ask_for Directions &quot; ) . Arrogant messages have long been common ( &quot; This is no ordinary person you are dealing with &quot; ) and gaining favor is their antithesis , the self-deprecating tee : &quot; Bad Spellers of the World , Untie &quot; or &quot; If Found , Drop_in Any Mailbox. &quot; A sub-genre of this category is the shirt declaring infirmity due_to age , such_as , &quot; Insufficient Memory at This Time &quot; and our personal favorite : &quot; OVER THE HILL -- What Hill ? Where ? I Didn ' t Notice Any Hill. &quot; But , the culmination of Tee diversity is found in the individualized Tee , intended to express any imaginable personal sentiment . And here in Ventura County is a plethora of shops ready to supply them on request . The local population may_not be using this option to its full potential , however . &quot; Usually , what people want is a shirt that says , ' Chuck is so and so old , ' &quot; said Amber Mullenix , store manager of Wild Tops in Thousand Oaks . Other big sellers , she said , are &quot; Fifty is Nifty &quot; and &quot; Forty and Sporty , &quot; also inspired by birthday observances . A similar report was given at Plum Pretty , a shirt printing booth in the Oxnard Esplanade Mall . Said owner Dolores Gragg : &quot; Most of it is : ' I love my Grandma ' or ' Mom Always Liked You Best. ' &quot; That is not to say that no unique messages are ever coined . Not that long ago , Mullenix printed a shirt for a customer reading , &quot; Tonka , Tonka. &quot; &quot; It ' s a saying that her husband would say all_the time when they were playing poker , &quot; she said . Other local shops had trouble recalling innovative shirts . Paul Lisak of Factory Screen Printing in Camarillo conceived a shirt reading &quot; I Survived the Malathion , &quot; which has been popular in that city . But by and large , retirements and birthdays dominate the local slogan scene . Why is it so ? When you think_of the sentiments expressed in daily dialogue -- are none of them worth wearing ? We determined to combat the trend , to choose a message that would set us apart from the crowd . It ' s not as easy as it sounds . Should the phrase be philosophical , flirtatious , witty ? What if it offends ? We came_to understand the common dilemma . So , we turned_to the idea book that Wild Tops keeps handy to help customers brainstorm . Right away , we were reassured . Here , agreeable titles abound -- on such subjects as diets , sports , hobbies and pets . It took a while . But , after careful deliberation , we found our personal manifesto : &quot; Backgammon Players Clear the Board. &quot; There ' s a certain elan about it . And , it hasn ' t offended anyone yet .</TEXT>
