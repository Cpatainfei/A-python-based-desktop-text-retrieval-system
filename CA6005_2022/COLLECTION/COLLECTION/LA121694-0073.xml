   <HEADLINE> SWEDEN TO LEAVE 800 BODIES INSIDE SUNKEN FERRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sweden decided Thursday to leave more_than 800 bodies inside the sunken ferry Estonia and preserve the wreck as a grave on the bottom of the Baltic_Sea . The long-awaited decision immediately drew fire from some relatives who had hoped to retrieve the bodies of their loved ones . &quot; This is one hell of a stupid decision , &quot; Kerstin Henriksson , a relative of two of the victims , told the Swedish news_agency TT . During the 2 1 / 2 months since the disaster , debate has been intense among supporters and opponents of a salvage that would be costly both financially and emotionally . Although technically feasible at an estimated cost of $ 67 million , officials believe they would never be able to retrieve all 818 bodies or identify them with certainty . Prime_Minister Ingvar Carlsson said the emotional toll on salvagers would be intense and unnecessary . He said the monetary cost of raising the ship , which sank about 23 miles southeast of the Finnish island of Uto , had &quot; played absolutely no part &quot; in the decision . More_than 900 people died on Sept . 28 after a Baltic_Sea storm tore_off the Estonia ' s front cargo door . Only 137 people survived and only 94 bodies were recovered .</TEXT>
