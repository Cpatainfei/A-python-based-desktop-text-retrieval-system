   <HEADLINE> AGRICULTURE_DEPARTMENT ACCUSED OF RACIAL BIAS ; TEXAS : USDA CONCEDES THE DISCRIMINATION , BUT DISAVOWS WHAT FARMER CALLS A LEGAL SETTLEMENT . THE PREJUDICIAL CONDUCT INCLUDED WITHHOLDING TECHNICAL ADVICE AND LOANS , HE SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The warning came early , Robert Williams Jr . says : He would n ' t have an easy time as the only black farmer owning land in Nolan County . ' You got this old farm , I helped you get_in , ' &quot; Williams says he was told by a Farmers Home Administration official when he bought 349 acres in 1990 . &quot; ' Son , you standing_up there smiling , but you ' re going to have to fight like hell to keep it. ' &quot; Williams ' cotton crops never flourished on the land he bought using funds from FmHA , the lending arm of the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture . He contends the agency ' s employees in nearby Sweetwater ridiculed him and denied him additional loans and technical guidance because of his race . After an investigation , the USDA conceded it discriminated against him . &quot; It wasn ' t no secret , &quot; Williams said . &quot; They let me know up front that I wasn ' t like the white_man . When it came time for me to get money or do certain things , they just would n ' t do things. &quot; After each planting season , Williams ' widely known financial woes deepened . Other farmers in his West Texas hometown of 1 # 500 taunted him , he said , and someone killed his dogs , glued shut the locks to his gate and draped the farm ' s entrance with a racist banner . Now , Williams and his attorneys say , the USDA is reneging_on a settlement . &quot; The whole system is messed_up , &quot; said Williams ' wife , LaVerne . &quot; They don ' t care . For the government -- I mean , all_the way to Washington -- to do someone like this , that was a hard pill to swallow . &quot; We thought maybe the nightmare was over , &quot; she said . &quot; In a sense , it ' s just begun. &quot; What the Williams camp calls a settlement , the USDA describes as a proposal containing terms the agency has no authority to honor . Bob Nash , the agency ' s undersecretary for small communities and rural development , said the official who signed it Aug . 27 was pressured . But attorney James Myart denies pressuring Carlton Lewis , acting branch chief for the FmHA ' s Equal_Opportunity Division . Myart says he considered the document final . &quot; that ' s his interpretation . . . and I ' m not going_to refute it one way or the other , &quot; Lewis said , declining to comment further . The document in_dispute , labeled a &quot; settlement memorandum , &quot; resulted from a seven-hour meeting in San Antonio between Williams ' attorneys and USDA officials from Washington . The document instructs the FmHA to pay Williams $ 1.08 million for farm liabilities and damages and $ 270 # 743.50 in attorneys ' fees . &quot; Mr. Lewis started the meeting out saying , ' We are not here to say who was wrong , who was right , because we know already that you people have been done wrong , ' &quot; LaVerne Williams said . &quot; I thought , ' Finally , somebody is listening to us , ' &quot; she said . &quot; I got excited . He said , ' We ' re here to settle. ' &quot; But a clause in the document required its submission to FmHA acting administrator Sharron Longino . One month later , Longino rejected the terms . &quot; There is no authority that would permit me to pay_for such things as Mr. and Mrs . Williams ' other business debts , lost income , emotional suffering or attorneys ' fees , &quot; she wrote to Myart . Instead , she offered to take the farm to satisfy the operating loan debt , and to help work_out agreements with other creditors . The FmHA was willing to lease the land back to Williams with a purchase option or help find another farm , Longino wrote . &quot; They ' ve disavowed the agreement and are attempting to treat it as a proposal , which is preposterous , &quot; said Myart , who accuses agriculture officials of using skewed legal reasoning to stall the settlement . Nash , the undersecretary , said USDA lawyers are working with the Department_of_Justice and Williams ' representatives to find an acceptable solution . He defended his department ' s handling of discrimination complaints since Mike Espy , who is black , became agriculture_secretary last year . The USDA didn ' t identify any discrimination cases in 1991 , and just six in 1992 , Nash said . But in 1993 , the USDA found 26 instances of discrimination and is remedying them as quickly as possible , he said . &quot; It would be naive for me to say that because Mike Espy is secretary_of_agriculture that no further discrimination will occur at USDA , &quot; Nash said . &quot; But it is also very realistic for me to say that Mike Espy and his staff will root_out and investigate every allegation. &quot; Nash confirmed that an investigation revealed discrimination against Williams , 49 , but declined to describe what the Office of Advocacy and Enterprise found . The complaint that Williams filed_in November , 1992 , was his second against the FmHA . The first was filed_in August , 1991 , and withdrawn six months later -- under coercion , Williams said , and the promise of a $ 24 # 900 operating loan , which he received . Myart , his attorney , titled his summation of the case , &quot; The Williams Tragedy : Down in the Land of Cotton , Look Away ! Look Away ! &quot; The summation demanded $ 1.23 million for farm liabilities , lost income and damages including reputation injury , humiliation and severe anxiety . No matter what happens , Williams said , the teasing in the local coffee_shop , vandalism , debts and FmHA discrimination ruined his life . &quot; I was a good old_boy , &quot; he said , &quot; until I got a farm of my own. &quot;</TEXT>
