   <HEADLINE> IS AID ON THE WRONG TERMS RIGHT ? ; RWANDA : IF THE REFUGEES STAY IN ZAIRE , LIVING_ON RELIEF , THEIR MEN WILL BE FREE TO RESUME WAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the world of humanitarian relief , the law of unintended consequences of good intentions is becoming ever more important . More_than 1 million Rwandan people , most of them members of the Hutu clan , have been led out of Rwanda at the instigation of_their_own leaders . The Hutu faction had mercilessly slaughtered an estimated 500 # 000 Tutsis while the world community passively watched , cluck-clucking about man ' s continuing inhumanity to man but lifting nary a finger to stop the slaughter of the innocent children whose dying faces stared out at us for more_than two months on evening news_programs . The Hutus fled a country where , even if ravaged by war , there was food in the fields , a village life and structure and the war and dying had stopped . The refugees ' political_leaders want to deny the Tutsi victors a population with which to rebuild the country . With their families safely supported by the world community in Zaire , the Hutu militants want to regroup , rearm , go_back in , kill the Tutsis and reconquer Rwanda . The job of the United Nations , the United States and other donor countries , if the Hutu leadership has its way , will be to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to keep their families alive in Zaire while the men and boys wage war . The Hutu leaders have been willing to lead their own children into areas where they will be threatened by cholera , and they are now intimidating their people and telling them not to return , that horrible things will happen to them if they go_back to Rwanda . All evidence shows that more horrible things face those families in the death-saturated fields of Goma , Zaire . The new government of Rwanda has stated its intention to peacefully welcome the return of the population and to bring_to justice the leaders of the Tutsi genocide . What , then , should a newly sensitized world do if it wants to use its resources wisely in this region ? The answer should be to use the relief aid as a magnet to move people back to Rwanda to get_on_with the harvest . The Rwandan families walked_out a week ago , and those who are not sick can be given provisions and an escort back home . And those who stayed in Rwanda should not receive less from the world community . Help that goes_to Rwanda also helps achieve Western governments ' and the United Nations ' goal of moving toward a more durable solution to the crisis . Putting 1 million people on an international food dole on the lava fields of Zaire is hardly_a long-term answer , especially when they sit there because of a desire for political vengeance . When Iraqi Kurds came flooding into Turkey , the United States was quick to establish the relief network back inside Iraq , because Turkey did not want the Kurds , a potentially destabilizing force . Here , the situation is reversed . The Zairean thugs who have &quot; the looting franchise &quot; for the part of Zaire where the refugees have fled want the U.N. planes to keep landing in Goma . They hold_up each plane until someone forks over money . If the refugees go_back , the gold mine goes_with them . Somalia left the United States timid about anything that might be construed by the media as intervention in the affairs of an African state . We have said that we will work in Zaire and leave it up_to the United Nations to work in Rwanda . While nobody wishes those desperate children in Goma to be shortchanged in any effort to save their lives , it is equally horrible to think that their return home will be held_up because the United States is willing to help them only if they continue to be refugees living_in horrendous health conditions . The U.S. humanitarian response to refugee needs has never been uncomplicated . In the 1980s , Afghans , Cambodians and Nicaraguans were encouraged to leave . Food and assistance served as a magnet , political_leaders intimidated people not to return and we went_along with it all . Families were supported for years while men fought against what we described as Soviet-supported opposition forces . The United States put a humanitarian cloak on what was essentially an anti-communist political policy . Now that has changed . Rwanda is unlikely to become a country where peace and prosperity reign forever . But for the moment , our pocketbooks and hearts are open . The resources should be used where they will have the greatest long-term positive humanitarian and political effects . That is inside Rwanda , helping the country and the refugees return to normal .</TEXT>
