   <TEXT> MALIBU : The City_Council has voted unanimously not to require residents seeking to rebuild homes burned in the November wildfires to indemnify the city from future liability resulting from landslides . The decision came_after hundreds of residents complained to council_members that an indemnification clause contained in waivers they had to sign before rebuilding would be onerous . For months , the city had refused to issue rebuilding permits until waivers releasing it from liability and indemnifying it were signed , holding_up reconstruction of about 200 homes on properties prone to landslides . Attorneys for the residents and the city reached a compromise Monday , dubbed Assumption of Risk and Release , which makes landholders assume risks incurred by building on geologically unstable land . Removal of the indemnity clause leaves the city open_to third-party suits . For instance , a homeowner whose house is damaged by another ' s during a slide would typically sue the neighbor and the city ( for issuing a building_permit ) . The indemnity clause would have exempted the city from such litigation .
