   <HEADLINE> NOTEBOOK ; TRANSPORTATION AGAIN EMERGES AS MAJOR GLITCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some observers , remembering the transportation problems that plagued the Lake Placid Winter_Olympics in 1980 , figured the same thing might happen here , where the arrangements are much the same . And it did . But , officials are saying , the problem has been rectified . About 300 spectators arrived late for the men ' s downhill skiing event Sunday at Kvitfjell because of long bus_lines -- gold-medal winner Tommy Moe ' s father and stepmother nearly missed his big moment because of that -- and about 100 figure_skating fans in Hamar were stranded until early Monday morning because they were unable to get_onto overcrowded buses . Private transportation has been cut_off in the Olympic region and Games spectators must rely primarily on buses supplied by Olympic organizers . That kind of arrangement fell_apart at Lake Placid because there were not enough buses , and for much of the first week of competition , fans were left fuming in parking_lots . Monday was a better day here , according to Einar Spurkeland , duty officer at the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee ' s transport section . &quot; We redeployed 20 buses at our disposal , which enabled us to transport 38 # 000 spectators to the various venues , &quot; Spurkeland said , adding that buses to the cross-country ski stadium , the luge and bobsled track at Hunderfossen and the Alpine skiing area at Kvitfjell all were_on schedule . Those who arrived too late to see Sunday ' s skiing will receive ticket refunds . Another 50 to 100 who turned_back when they realized they could not get_to Kvitfjell on_time , will also get refunds . * Juan Antonio Samaranch , president of the International Olympic Committee , left Lillehammer for Sarajevo to pay tribute to the besieged host city of the 1984 Winter Games . During his one-day visit , Samaranch hopes to see the sports facilities that have been damaged or destroyed in the Bosnian war . He also plans to meet with Bosnian Olympic Committee officials and confer_with government , U.N. and relief agency representatives . * They have concessions stands here at the Bierkebeineren ski stadium , selling beer , soda , candy_bars , hot dogs , other sandwiches , all_the usual amenities . They also have stands selling T-shirts , Olympic pins and other souvenirs . But the stands doing the biggest business Monday , in subzero temperatures , were the ones renting rubber and plastic standing mats , which keep the spectators ' feet off the snow . Stands selling souvenir cow bells ran a strong second . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
