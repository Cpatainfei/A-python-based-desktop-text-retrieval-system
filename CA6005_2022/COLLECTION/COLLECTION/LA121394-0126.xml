   <HEADLINE> BODY WATCH ; MAGIC MUSHROOM OR MENACE ; THE KOMBUCHA ' TEA ' CULT IS GROWING EVER STRONGER . BUT NO ONE CAN PROVE THE DRINK ALLEVIATES EVERYTHING FROM ASTHMA TO AIDS . AND SOME SAY IT MIGHT EVEN BE HARMFUL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; What kombucha does is . . . is it sets_up a vibrational tone , &quot; Norman Baker is saying . &quot; It ' s a living thing ! Give it love ! Sing to it ! &quot; Baker , who in stature and intensity calls to mind Richard Simmons , places his hand_over his heart and stares earnestly into his visitor ' s eyes . &quot; In fact , we believe the kombucha has an intelligence well above the level of a dolphin . It knows where to go_in your body. &quot; Ah , kombucha . Hindu love god ? Recently exhumed Mayan fertility idol ? No , Baker is talking_about a mushroomish mass of plant matter . Throughout Southern California and points beyond , kombucha is spreading like kudzu . But the pie-sized , brown mass with a tough but gelatinous consistency is not for eating . Rather , it is floated atop a solution of black or green_tea and sugar , and fermented for seven to 10 days -- after which it renders a tangy , cidery beverage with a whiff of vinegar and a hint of carbonation . Recommended dosage : four ounces , three times a day before meals . Kombucha &quot; tea , &quot; as it ' s called , is causing quite a stir . The list of ailments it is purported to cure , according to its fans , is staggering : asthma , eczema , low energy , bad digestion . It clears_up your skin , gets_rid_of wrinkles , and even turns hair ( or at least some of it ) from gray back to its original color . There are even claims that it rebuilds AIDS-ravaged immune_systems and mitigates symptoms of multiple_sclerosis . Skeptics , however , say that kombucha may be benign at best and toxic at worst , and fear a cultlike hysteria may arise before it is carefully analyzed . Meanwhile , there ' s a rush on kombucha accouterments . Pyrex bowls are selling as fast as the shipments come_in . And health_food stores such_as Wild_Oats in Pasadena are selling dozens of bottles of a commercially produced kombucha beverage for $ 5 a pint . It is difficult , however , to know just how much of the information circulating about kombucha -- which reportedly originated_in Manchuria -- is accurate . According to &quot; Kombucha , Health Beverage and Natural Remedy From the Far East , &quot; by Gunther W . Frank ( Wilhelm Ennsthaler , 1991 ) , the Soviets began conducting experiments with it under Stalin when it was discovered that people in the Ural Mountains who were inveterate &quot; tea kvass &quot; drinkers had dramatically lower cancer rates than other similarly industrialized areas . Still , the article contained in the book was penned , according to a note by Frank , by a Russian doctor who preferred to remain anonymous . &quot; The tea has been available in Europe for years , &quot; says German-born Aurelia Haslboeck , a healer and aroma therapist who says the tea works &quot; like magic. &quot; The Los Angeles woman says she is frequently complimented on the luminosity of her skin . Kombucha tea has also been widely embraced by people who are HIV-positive . &quot; I ' d say from between 15 % to 20 % of our AIDS patients have experimented with it , &quot; says Dr. Gary Cohan of the Pacific Oaks Medical Group , which specializes in AIDS and HIV treatment and research . * Norman Baker and his partner , novelist Betsy Prior , are believers . They are also the owners of Laurel Farms , a kombucha distribution outlet based in Culver City . Fifty bucks gets you a starter mushroom and instructions , although the two say that ' s just to subsidize free kombucha for those who are too sick or broke to pay . Still , Laurel Farms is a registered trademark , and the talk soon turns_to joint_ventures with Coca-Cola and Snapple . Combined , Baker and Prior are a gale force of kombucha boosterism that borders_on the messianic . Their office answering machine takes more_than a_hundred messages a day from people pleading for kombucha , people relating tales of miraculous remissions . But they are quick to note : &quot; We ' re not saying it ' s a cure. &quot; Saying it is a cure would immediately put kombucha within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , which is keeping a watchful eye on kombucha developments . Rosio Vior , the FDA ' s Los Angeles branch spokeswoman , says kombucha raises several red flags . &quot; One of the warning signs we look_for that something is a scam is when people say that a product cures a whole host of illnesses , &quot; she says . &quot; Another is when they refer to it as ancient , something used for years . You have to ask , if this stuff is so wonderful , why don ' t the medical professionals know about it ? &quot; Dr. Jeffrey Gates , an associate researcher in Cornell University ' s nutrition department , has been monitoring kombucha use for almost a year . A member of the China Group , a research group immersed in studying the diet of Chinese peasants , Gates recently sent samples of kombucha to a biotech lab to be analyzed for &quot; anti-carcinogenic activity. &quot; While awaiting results , Gates says he is slowly forming some preliminary conclusions about the fungus . &quot; There is a possibility that kombucha actually does_work , but the question remains : What is the margin of error allowed , how much is too_much , and what will happen if it ' s contaminated ? What are the consequences ? Death ? Organ damage ? Simple nausea ? &quot; Through the Internet , Gates has collected reams of anecdotal evidence about kombucha . &quot; The vast majority of stories are positive , but there have been reports of nausea and vomiting , and in one case a woman attributed a breast lump to the tea , &quot; he says . There also have been two unsubstantiated reports of death caused by kombucha , and_Gates says he can ' t rule_out the possibility -- however dim -- that kombucha could be toxic to the liver . Adds Cohan , the Pacific Oaks physician who specializes in AIDS treatment : &quot; Some of my patients have experimented with it and have fun with it , and I don ' t think there ' s any great harm in it . But if it ' s so great , where ' s the data ? There ' s a cult mentality at_work here. &quot;</TEXT>
