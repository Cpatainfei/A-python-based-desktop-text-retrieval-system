   <HEADLINE> ROUNDTABLE TAKES_AIM AT PREJUDICE , STEREOTYPES ; THOUSAND OAKS : GROUP OF WOMEN , WHO USE GAMES AND DISCUSSIONS TO BRING ABOUT CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING , HOPE TO GO BEFORE COMMUNITY FORUMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The game was simple , a tried-and-true icebreaker . You plucked a slip_of_paper from a hat . You read the scrawled half-sentence . You wandered the room , interviewing strangers , trying to find the person whose paper best completed your sentence . A straightforward get-to-know-you game . But this particular version had a nasty twist . Half the scraps contained sweeping categories : All Arabs are . . . . All Jews are . . . . All New Yorkers are . . . . The other half held angry adjectives : Uptight . Ugly . Stingy . Nuts . No one could hope to form a politically correct sentence . And that was exactly the point . The 16 women playing the game represented many different cultures : Indian , Japanese , Costa Rican , Armenian , African American , Jewish and more . Together , they formed the Roundtable on Diversity , a new group dedicated to busting stereotypes , battling prejudices and urging understanding in Thousand Oaks . &quot; We want to make this community better , &quot; said Elena Garate Eskey , an administrator at Cal Lutheran University who considers herself a blend of Cuban , German and Swiss heritage . Playing the sentence game helped Roundtable members confront their own prejudices . After reluctantly writing derogatory sentences , the women brainstormed to come_up with positive spins . The match &quot; All Californians are crazy , &quot; for example , turned_into &quot; All Californians are free-spirited and innovative. &quot; Still a stereotype , of course , but a slightly more palatable one . And the exercise proved a valuable education . &quot; Everybody ' s willing to pigeonhole everyone else , &quot; Eskey said , summarizing the lesson . &quot; But when it comes_down to it , we ' re just people. &quot; To spread that message , the Roundtable women hope to take their games and discussions into community forums . Eventually , they may expand their membership to include men . For now , though , they have decided to allow women only , &quot; because women really are the change agents , &quot; Eskey said . &quot; I don ' t think that ' s a stereotype -- women have always had the burden of change , all around the world. &quot; This particular group of women will be busy this summer , trying to persuade the Thousand Oaks City_Council to establish a multicultural commission with power to mediate disputes , investigate complaints and educate the public . &quot; I see ( the commission ) as a place where people can get a handle on changing ethnicity in this city , &quot; organizer Shoshana Brower said , digging into a breakfast of saffron rice , sushi rolls and potato kugel at a recent Roundtable meeting . &quot; If there ' s a problem , the commissioners can jump in and help avoid or manage conflict. &quot; If the commission is established , its first_step might simply be to spread the word that Thousand Oaks -- despite its reputation as a homogeneous bedroom community -- has grown increasingly diverse . The most recent census found that Latinos account_for fully one-tenth of the city ' s population . The 1990 survey also noted small but growing Asian and black communities , which together make_up nearly 6 % of the population . And diversity in Thousand Oaks goes way beyond the census figures . Students representing 33 countries , and 30 distinct languages , study side_by_side in the Conejo Valley Unified School District . A Japanese junior may confer_with a Peruvian senior while a Guatemalan classmate reviews algebra nearby . A Mayan tutor may help a Taiwanese immigrant learn English while Mexican students pore over a beginning grammar text . &quot; To all those people who think_of us ( in Thousand Oaks ) as absolutely negating diversity , I say , come_with me for a day , &quot; said Claudia Spelman , director of pupil services . Within the district , high_school students have formed their own mini-roundtables , gathering immigrants from various countries to discuss discrimination and alienation . Sometimes , they ask students born in the United States to participate as well . But despite some outreach efforts , &quot; we ' re like outsiders , &quot; said Gabriel Vazquez , 18 , a Westlake High senior who emigrated from Mexico two years ago and plans to attend Cal State Northridge in the fall . &quot; They don ' t always talk to us , and that ' s why I feel so sad. &quot; Thousand Oaks ' schools have largely avoided the racial strife that has sparked fights on some campuses elsewhere in the county , including Ventura and Oxnard . Yet three Westlake High students were recently injured in a fight that pitted white football_players against an Asian student allegedly backed by out-of-towners . And in the city as_a_whole , Roundtable members see no cause for complacency . They point first to a burst of hate crimes in Thousand Oaks over the summer . In the most widely publicized case , vandals three times spray-painted swastikas and racial epithets on the home of the Rev . Kenneth Bushnell , a black Seventh-day Adventist minister . Those incidents mirrored a flurry of anti-Semitic graffiti on Conejo Valley synagogues in late 1990 and early 1991 . Temple Adat Elohim was among the hardest hit , as an arsonist set fire to the school building several weeks after religious slurs were spray-painted on the synagogue . In more recent episodes , police have this year investigated several attacks described as racially motivated . And hate literature has been found stuffed in boxes at local drugstores . Of course , the problems in Thousand Oaks , consistently ranked one of the nation ' s safest mid-sized cities , seem minor compared to the violence that daily rattles Los Angeles . Because the city has enjoyed relative harmony , some question the need for a multicultural commission . &quot; I have seen absolutely almost zero ethnic tension in this city in my years as a resident and council_member , &quot; said Alex Fiore , who will retire this fall after 30 years on the City_Council . &quot; This is not Los Angeles or Chicago or New York , &quot; he said . &quot; This is Thousand Oaks. &quot; But Mayor Elois Zeanah , who has been working with the Roundtable since early March , considers Thousand Oaks ripe for some sort of multicultural commission . &quot; We ' re trying to get_in at the front_end , rather than waiting for ( racism ) to become a problem , &quot; she said . In Ventura County , the closest model would be Oxnard ' s Commission on Community Relations , which monitors and investigates discrimination complaints . Over the years , the commission has evolved into a general clearinghouse to help people cut_through red_tape at City_Hall . But the group does focus especially on those who &quot; feel they don ' t have a chance to be heard because they ' re from a minority , &quot; said Paula Reach , a member of the Oxnard panel for 12 years . Even more_than intervention , many Thousand Oaks Roundtable members are interested in education -- both for immigrant newcomers and for 30-year residents who may be bewildered by the multitude of languages they hear around them . By introducing residents to their new neighbors , and by holding forums or writing pamphlets to explain cultural differences , Roundtable members hope to ease the transition on both sides . Although she spoke perfect English , Anita Bapat could have used some support when she arrived from India 4 1 / 2 years ago . She found her neighbors friendly and welcoming , but couldn ' t get used to some of their customs -- like shaking hands and even hugging at every meeting . Raised to behave more circumspectly , Bapat considered Americans brash and forward . Her neighbors pegged her as aloof and rude . Bapat would like to see such misunderstandings averted through some kind of outreach and education effort . The multicultural commission should serve as an &quot; ambassador of goodwill , &quot; Roundtable member Karen Livesay agreed . She would also like to use the panel as a platform to educate people about diversity within each distinct ethnic_group . A local management_consultant , Livesay laughs when people seem to see her blond hair and fair skin as belying a Latino heritage . In reality , she grew_up speaking Spanish , eating tortillas with nearly every meal and celebrating her Costa Rican heritage . &quot; It amuses me but also bothers me , &quot; Livesay said . &quot; It shows that we haven ' t done a good_enough job of making people aware of our heritage. &quot; Roundtable members recognize that some Thousand Oaks residents -- proud_of their relatively homogeneous community -- might resent a multicultural commission designed to highlight diversity . &quot; Because of the economic distress around the world , people are a little less accepting these days , and they always need a scapegoat , &quot; said Spelman , the school administrator . &quot; But that makes the committee ' s work very important. &quot; Livesay agreed : &quot; Though it may_not be comfortable , change will take us in a better direction . We ' ve got so_much opportunity to be a model community . Why not push the envelope of our internationalism and go beyond what we may appear to be ? &quot; Thousand Oaks Population by Race White : 94 # 333 Hispanic : 9 # 871 Mexican : 6 # 924 Asian or Pacific Islander : 4 # 925 Chinese : 1 # 588 Black : 1 # 346 Japanese : 821 Asian Indian : 649 Korean : 570 Filipino : 535 Guatemalan : 371 Vietnamese : 347 American_Indian : 310 Salvadoran : 303 Colombian : 186 Cuban : 166 Puerto Rican : 159 Nicaraguan : 121 Peruvian : 95 Ecuadorean : 83 Hawaiian : 73 Guamanian : 47 Panamanian : 47 Tongan : 42 Aleut : 20 Thai : 18 Samoan : 18 Honduran : 17 Other Hispanic : 994 Other South_American : 340 Other Central_American : 65 TOTAL RESIDENTS : 104 # 352 Source : 1990 U .
