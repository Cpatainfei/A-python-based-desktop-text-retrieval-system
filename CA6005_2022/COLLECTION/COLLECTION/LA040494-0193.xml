   <HEADLINE> ' HOUSE OF SPIRITS ' FAILS TO LEVITATE ; MOVIES : THE STAR-STUDDED FILM DOES POORLY IN ITS U.S. OPENING , DESPITE HEAVY PUBLICITY AND STRONG EUROPEAN SALES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The House of the Spirits &quot; opened in U.S. theaters Friday boasting tantalizing star power , $ 55 million in European ticket sales and a plot based on the popular South_American novel of the same name . But , today , &quot; Spirits &quot; may be decidedly lower . In its first weekend , the movie drew a poor $ 1.8 million at the box_office at about 470 theaters . That is a disappointment for a movie that rode in on a wave of publicity with great expectations . Although there were many favorable reviews , most were not enthusiastic . And many negative reviews were withering . The film also generated a renewed protest from Latino actors in Los Angeles over the issue of non-Latinos playing roles that call_for Latin characters . The $ 25-million production shot in Portugal and Denmark is based on Isabel Allende ' s novel covering several generations of a powerful family in an unnamed South_American_nation . The lead roles of the aristocracy are played by Jeremy Irons , Glenn Close , Meryl Streep , Winona Ryder and Vanessa Redgrave -- all non-Latinos . The two major working-class roles are played by the cast ' s two best-known Latinos , Spanish actor Antonio Banderas and actress Maria Conchita Alonso . &quot; ' The House of the Spirits ' is not a big deal . But the film is a part of a trend that is starting not to look good , &quot; said Radames Soto , a producer with Blue Pearl Development in New York City , which also manages Latin talent . His current project in production is a syndicated series , &quot; Hispanic_Americans : The New Frontier , &quot; hosted by Latino actor Jimmy Smits . &quot; I just think it makes_sense to start developing the kinds of stars who will attract the Hispanic audience . . . it ' s the fast-growing segment of the country , &quot; Soto added . &quot; Look , Al Pacino is becoming the hardest working Hispanic actor who isn ' t Hispanic , &quot; Soto said , noting that among other Latino roles , Pacino , of Italian heritage , is soon to play Manuel Noriega , the deposed strongman of Panama , in Oliver Stone ' s &quot; Noriega. &quot; On Friday , a newly formed coalition of Latinos in Los Angeles and Orange counties named Luchador Chicanos distributed leaflets to moviegoers in Westwood , Hollywood and Santa Monica . Actor and protest organizer Del Zamora said that if non-Latino stars continue to take roles of Latino characters , &quot; we will boycott all_of their films. &quot; &quot; I understand the frustration of the actors who want to work , &quot; said Harvey Weinstein , the co-chairman of the movie ' s American distributor , Miramax Films . &quot; In the ideal situation , we probably should have cast all Chilean actors . But where would it stop ? These people were the best actors for the part. &quot; ( &quot; Spirits &quot; author Allende is of Chilean descent and the niece of that nation ' s former president , Salvador Allende , who was deposed by the military. ) &quot; We ' re the wrong company for them to protest , &quot; Weinstein said , noting that Miramax has distributed many Latin-made films , including those by Pedro Almodovar and the Mexican-made hit &quot; Like Water for Chocolate. &quot; Weinstein , who came_in on the project seven years ago when it was still at Warner Bros. , said the production was a &quot; labor of love. &quot; &quot; The cast worked for a fraction of their normal salaries . They believed_in the material , and I personally won ' t stand_for them being treated like this . When they ( the protesters ) say they should look Latin -- what is looking Latin ? &quot; Weinstein said if it weren ' t for the German producers Bernd Eichinger and Constantin Film and Danish director Bille August ' s ( &quot; Pelle the Conqueror &quot; ) persistence , the film would n ' t have been made . Meanwhile , Miramax ' s New York offices , faced with hugely negative reviews that came from England a_couple_of weeks ago , took_out an advertisement last week in the New York Times on the day before American reviews appeared to quote Allende ' s enthusiastic reaction to the movie as &quot; the best review of all. &quot; In an interview Friday , Weinstein said : &quot; That ad was just to tell the people who read the book that you can ' t do nine hours to ( adapt the book ) . Bille August chose three themes from the book : love , power and forgiveness. &quot; The London Daily Mail ' s headline had called the film &quot; the star-studded fiasco from hell. &quot; England , however , has been the exception so far in foreign reaction . A spokesman for the producer said the reception was especially favorable in Germany and other nations on the Continent . Indeed , it is unusual for a major movie to arrive in the United States with a gross of $ 55 million already under its belt and openings in Australia , Japan and South_America still to come . * Free-lance writers David Gritten in London and Robert Koehler in Los Angeles contributed this article .</TEXT>
