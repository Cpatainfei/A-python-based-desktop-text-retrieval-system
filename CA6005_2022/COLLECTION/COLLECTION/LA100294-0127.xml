   <HEADLINE> HIKING : SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS : ON THE TRAIL OF MANY LANGUAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Think globally , act locally &quot; could be the motto for builders of the new Solstice International Trail in the Santa Monica Mountains above Malibu . The self-guided interpretive trail leads hikers along a year-round creek and introduces them to the flora and history of the Santa Monica Mountains . Interpretive pamphlets are available in English , Spanish , Korean , Japanese , Tagalog , Cantonese and Mandarin . The idea behind the trail , a joint endeavor of the Southern California chapter of the Pacific Asia Travel Assn . and the nonprofit Mountains Conservancy Foundation , is to introduce the local wild lands -- what park professionals call &quot; the other L.A. &quot; -- to visitors and residents from Asian and Pacific Rim countries . The path itself is a narrow country road -- suitable for strollers and wheelchairs -- which offers an easy family hike in the shade of grand old oaks and towering sycamores . Solstice Canyon Park , which opened on the summer_solstice of 1988 and came from land privately owned , is enjoyable year-round , but autumn and winter are particularly good times to ramble through the quiet canyon . In autumn , enjoy the fall color display of the sycamores and in winter , from the park ' s upper slopes , look_for gray_whales migrating past Point Dume . Milk_thistle , castor_bean and other assorted non-native plants were eliminated when the park was built . Picnic_areas and a visitor center were added . Now , with the Solstice International Trail , Solstice Canyon Trail has to rank among the top nature parks in the Southland . Directions to trail head : From Pacific Coast Highway , about 17 miles up the coast from Santa Monica and 3 1 / 2 miles up-coast from Malibu Canyon Road , turn inland on Corral Canyon Road . At the first bend in the road you ' ll leave the road and proceed straight to the very small Solstice Canyon parking_lot . Beyond this small lot , the park access_road continues to a second , larger lot . There is a $ 5 park entry fee . The hike : Stop at the Visitor Center , pick_up a trail brochure in the language of your choice , then join signed Solstice International Trail . The brochure , keyed to two_dozen numbered posts along the path , describes everything you see en route , from sage to sycamores . About halfway along , you ' ll pass the 1865 Matthew Keller House and in a_few more minutes -- Fern Grotto . The road travels under the shade of oak and sycamore . Palms , agave , bamboo and bird_of_paradise and many_more tropical plants thrive in the garden . A waterfall , fountain and an old dam are some of the other special features found in this paradisiacal setting known as Tropical Terrace . Across the creek from Tropical Terrace is signed Rising Sun Trail , which climbs a ridge for rewarding canyon and ocean views . The two-mile trail offers an excellent , but more difficult return route to the trail head . Solstice International Trail Where : Solstice Canyon Park , Santa Monica Mountains . Distance : 3 miles round_trip . Terrain : Gentle canyon , year-round creek . Highlights : Best nature trail in the Santa Monica Mountains , complete with interpretive brochure in a half-dozen foreign languages . Degree of Difficulty : Easy .
