   <HEADLINE> FRENCHMAN GETS LIFE TERM FOR WWII KILLINGS ; WAR_CRIMES : THE VICHY REGIME ' S MILITIA CHIEF ORDERED THE EXECUTION OF SEVEN JEWS IN 1944 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Paul Touvier , the first French citizen tried_for crimes against humanity , was sentenced today to life in prison for ordering the execution of seven Jews during World_War_II . The former militia chief of France ' s collaborationist Vichy government was convicted early today of complicity in crimes against humanity . His conviction , after an emotional five-week trial , was a historic milestone for a nation that has struggled to come_to terms with its wartime past . The 79-year-old Touvier , his face white and tense , swallowed hard several times as the verdict was read after 5 1 / 2 hours of deliberation by the jury . He turned_around , waved to the courtroom audience and was escorted out by his lawyer . His lawyer said Touvier will appeal the verdict . Touvier was also fined $ 430 , and civil parties asked the court for one franc -- 17 cents -- in symbolic payment for damages . Touvier admitted ordering the execution of seven Jewish prisoners at Rillieux-la-Pape outside Lyons on June 29 , 1944 , but said he had sacrificed them to save the lives of 23 others . He said the Nazis had demanded 30 victims to avenge the assassination of Vichy Information Minister Philippe Henriot . In a brief statement issued before jurors began deliberations , Touvier said : &quot; I have never forgotten the victims of Rillieux . I think_about them every day , every night. &quot; Relatives of the victims welcomed the verdict . &quot; I have a great feeling of satisfaction tonight , &quot; said Gerard Benzimra , whose brother Claude was one of the victims . &quot; There is no question of vengeance for me . What ' s important is a crime against humanity has not gone unpunished. &quot; The trial was filled with emotional testimony by victims ' families as Touvier sat stoically in a bulletproof glass booth . Lawyer Jacques Tremolet de Villers made a final appeal for acquittal on Tuesday , saying Touvier was accused of war_crimes , which cannot be prosecuted because the 30-year statute of limitations has run_out . &quot; It was an act of war in reprisal for an act of war , &quot; he said . Touvier will remain in custody pending his appeal . Touvier was arrested in Nice in 1989 after spending decades as a fugitive , harbored in convents , churches and monasteries across France .</TEXT>
