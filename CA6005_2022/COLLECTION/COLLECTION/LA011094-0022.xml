   <HEADLINE> RABBI HECHT ON ' SCHINDLER ' S LIST '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In response to &quot; When Will Jews Let It Rest ? &quot; by Rabbi Eli Hecht , Commentary , Jan . 2 : As a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp , a presidential appointee to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum Council , and one of a handful of benefactors of the Los Angeles Holocaust Monument in Pan Pacific Park , I believe I am qualified to respond to Rabbi Hecht ' s column . Clearly Rabbi Hecht does not have the slightest understanding of why Jews -- and all people -- must understand the horrors of the Holocaust and never , ever forget it . The resounding message of every museum and monument which has been erected in memory of the Holocaust is not , as Hecht states , that &quot; the world is never a safe place for Jews. &quot; The message of remembrance , rather , is that the world must do everything humanly possible to prevent man ' s inhumanity to man from repeating itself . Each day , thousands of men , women and children of all races , religions , and nationalities visit the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington . I am extremely proud that I have been a part of its creation -- not because I wear a number on my arm . . . and not because I need a memorial to the nearly 60 members of my own family who perished at the hands of the Nazis . I am proud because of the many lessons it teaches to this generation and all future generations of children about ending discrimination of all kinds . If Rabbi Hecht cannot see the importance of these lessons of the Holocaust , then he has closed his eyes to the rest of the world , turning his back on the horrors of Cambodia , Bosnia and Somalia . He refuses to recognize the ongoing acts of the Ku Klux Klan , skinheads , and the many gangs who terrorize innocent victims and create daily versions of the Holocaust in our cities . The movie , &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; and other movies like it , should be required viewing for all people . As a teacher , Rabbi Hecht should know that children cannot be taught tolerance without awareness . As the Talmud reads ( as well as the inscription on the ring presented to Oskar Schindler by the 1 # 200 Jews he saved ) , &quot; He who saves one life , saves the world. &quot; NATHAN SHAPELL Beverly Hills * For the life of me I cannot understand why Rabbi Hecht is so upset with Steven Spielberg ' s film &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; In our religious_schools we were taught that one who saves one life is saving the whole world . Schindler , for whatever reason , saved over a_thousand Jews . For that alone he should be remembered . For all his moral shortcomings and the benefit he derived from Jewish labor , at the end he saved them . I too was saved by a righteous Gentile . I never questioned his reason or morality . But when a Polish Catholic endangered his life and the lives of his children and grandchildren to save my life , then he should be remembered for the good he did . The last thing I recall our martyred parents , brothers and sisters asking of the ones who would survive was to tell the world what happened to them , and to remember them . GEORGE LUBOW Arcadia * It was such a pleasure to read an honest observation made by Hecht . I ' m 69 and every time I see a Holocaust movie I cry . What the rabbi was saying is_on target . Enough of suffering ! As an American I remembered the hostility . Nobody really ever helped . JEANNE SCHULMAN Carson * It is true that Schindler was a member of the Nazi_party , an aspiring war profiteer and bon_vivant , but it is also true that somehow he discovered his humanity in the horrors of the Shoah as the rescuer of those Jews . In response to Hecht ' s contention that Schindler ' s motives and actions are highly suspect , it might be easy to say that Schindler was a hero and leave it at that . But that would be dangerous . Heroes are not like other people . Heroes rise above what is expected of the rest of us and perform acts which are extraordinary . Schindler ' s journey from war profiteer to rescuer did not come suddenly . It emerged from Schindler ' s recognition that the Jews working for him as slave laborers were human_beings . It was common humanity , that which linked Schindler to the Jews , that motivated his actions , not uncommon heroism . Spielberg has given us a very precious gift in bringing Schindler ' s story to the screen . Schindler was not a super-hero , he was a mensch , a human_being . We need menschen , real human_beings , more_than heroes . That is what Schindler really teaches us . RABBI SHELTON J . DONNELL Temple Beth Sholom , Santa Ana * Does Rabbi Hecht propose that , as Jews , we let Passover and Purim rest along with the Holocaust ? For centuries we have recounted tales of the enslavement and subsequent rescue of our people by &quot; righteous &quot; souls . Only an ostrich would not have noticed that along with dwelling on our past , we have celebrated life . We never used our oppression as an excuse to sink into despair . Didn ' t the rabbi ever hear of the admonition that &quot; those who do not study history are condemned to repeat it &quot; ? Would he have attacked Picasso ' s painting of the &quot; Guernica &quot; because it depicted the massacre of the populace of that Spanish town by Franco ' s fascists ? Would he decry our remembrance of the Civil War because it reminds us of the evils of slavery ? The film about Schindler will act_as a reminder for generations to come both about the depths that human_beings can descend to and the heights they can achieve . Rabbi Hecht has done a grievous disservice to righteous people throughout the world -- whatever their religion . BETTY R . PARDO MURRAY S . PARDO Laguna Hills * Rabbi Hecht badly misses the point of &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; Schindler was an imperfect hero whose motivations for rescuing hunted Jews from Nazi extermination remain unclear . Schindler ' s inexplicable heroism is precisely the reason the film is so compelling . Schindler was one of a small number of rescuers -- non-Jewish men and women -- who risked their lives and those of their families to help save the lives of fellow human_beings . The extraordinary moral courage displayed by Schindler in response to the darkness of unaccountable horror renders him a remarkable hero . Hecht acknowledges that he doesn ' t &quot; care to know &quot; about the &quot; moral awakening &quot; that drove this man &quot; to play G-d. &quot; Those whom Schindler saved , however , and those whom he inspired care a great_deal . Hecht acknowledges that his concern is not so_much with Schindler as it is with what he sees as the film ' s identification of Judaism with suffering . He couldn ' t be more wrong . Hecht ' s goal might be the bolstering of Jewish identity but &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; has an altogether different focus . Rather than criticize a film that so eloquently examines man ' s capacity for evil and the noble values of an unlikely hero , Hecht should re-evaluate the moving story of a man who in many ways was a model -- for Jews and non-Jews . SELENE BRUK Chair , Holocaust Committee ADL , Los Angeles * What a refreshing viewpoint expressed by Hecht concerning &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; and celebrating the richness of a Jewish heritage , versus the fears of persecution ! If everyone would practice celebrating the joy of his or her uniqueness , versus fearing for it , the world would be a much more joyful place . Too_much of our modern life revolves_around the fear and defensiveness we teach our children to associate with their differences in ethnicity , race , sex and religion . We should be teaching them the strengths that can be gained from these things . VICKI TALBOT Malibu * Faced with the certain , inescapable death by starvation , violence or Auschwitz , anyone would have preferred working for Schindler . I don ' t believe anyone whose life he saved cared about the man ' s personal morals . It is pretty futile to self-righteously accuse him of profiteering and adultery when he spent his personal fortune on saving lives . There is an absolute need to tell the story of suffering , especially because of the resurgence of ethnic cleansing , neo-Nazi violence and the emergence of maniacs like Zhirinovsky in Russia . If Hecht , as a Jew , is_sick and tired_of victimization -- I , as a German , am_sick and tired_of the stigma Hitler left on Germans . But I believe that those who do not learn from the mistakes of the past are bound to repeat them . We can ' t turn the clock back but we can try to educate and exercise tolerance . BIRGIT NIELSEN Los Angeles * I do not write to praise Schindler or to bury him . But Schindler , the Nazi , saved about 1 # 100 men , women and children . As a Jew who lived during the Final Solution , each life saved was very significant . There were other Nazis who profited from Jewish slave labor . Some provided additional bread rations , but during the final liquidation of the camps , they abandoned their Jewish workers to the fate of the SS , which usually meant death in a concentration_camp . So Schindler , the Nazi , a moral war profiteer , somehow decided for whatever reason to save 1 # 100 Jews . It was a unique act in Nazi-occupied Europe . Rabbi Hecht states that for many Jews this is a &quot; sacred_cow , &quot; just as the &quot; museums of the Holocaust are considered beyond criticism. &quot; He has missed the point . Memory of the Holocaust cannot be erased or replaced . The attack upon the memory of the survivors , GIs who liberated the concentration_camps and other eyewitnesses has been coming from the extreme right and other elements who deny that the Holocaust existed . Holocaust museums serve to preserve memory , but also to act_as educational centers . Our intention is not to portray Jews as victims but to educate the next generation that racial prejudices in whichever form may eventually lead to Auschwitz . I also reject Rabbi Hecht ' s contention that he is_sick and tired_of this generation ' s identifying Judaism with suffering . Does he suggest that we should use selective memory and provide our generation with only a richness about our noble religion ? As one who in June , 1942 , lost all members of his family and most of his childhood friends , I owe it to them to preserve their memory . &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; is not Holocaust entertainment . It is an attempt to depict an event too horrendous to comprehend and too difficult to view , and to show us that humanity has a long way to go_to become humane .
