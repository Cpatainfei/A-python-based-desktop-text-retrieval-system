   <HEADLINE> DEFENSE ; FRANCE TAKING TENTATIVE STEPS BACK INTO NATO MILITARY FOLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Atlantic Alliance defense ministers gather Wednesday in the Spanish city of Seville for their annual informal meeting , there will be a new face at the table -- that of French Defense Minister Francois Leotard . It is not that Leotard is new_to the job . He has held his post since the_French right returned to power in elections 18 months ago . What is new is that a French defense minister is in Seville at all . Indeed , Leotard ' s participation in the three-day gathering marks the first time France has attended such a meeting since the late President Charles de Gaulle pulled his nation out of the military side of the 16-member North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization in 1966 amid accusations that the alliance was little more_than a tool for American domination of Europe . The decision to send Leotard to Seville represents the latest in a series of gradual , low-key French steps back toward the NATO fold rather than any sudden , dramatic U-turn . Few predict the move signals any swift full French re-integration into NATO ' s military structure . That would surely be seen as compromising the unfettered independence of the_French military deterrent , an idea that remains a strict political taboo in Paris . Still , both here at NATO headquarters and in Paris , Leotard ' s presence is considered significant . &quot; It means something , &quot; said Dominique Moisi , deputy director of the_French Institution of International Relations in Paris . &quot; It means the_French are aware that their previous policy was leading them to self-exclusion , that if they wanted to have some influence . . . they had to be present. &quot; Added a senior NATO official : &quot; This is a step_in the right direction . It shows a new attitude on the part of France. &quot; It is also likely that Leotard ' s presence will be more_than merely symbolic . &quot; He ' s not just going_to Seville to listen , he ' s going_to take the lead in discussions about Bosnia-Herzegovina ( where France has the single largest contingent of U.N. peacekeepers ) and on security concerns in the Mediterranean , &quot; the NATO official said . &quot; He ' ll be trying to say that Algeria is a security concern for all_of Europe. &quot; Both for NATO and for France , this increasingly active French role is important . For the alliance , participation not only would add the clout of what by 1997 will be Western Europe ' s largest national military_force . It would also boost NATO ' s profile in the politically volatile Mediterranean and provide it with valuable experience in peacekeeping -- central to NATO ' s future . For France , closer cooperation with NATO is a way to avoid an isolation that had threatened to marginalize in the post-Cold War climate . De Gaulle ' s vision of France as a powerful , nuclear &quot; third force , &quot; independent of both superpowers , may have been viable in the Cold_War . But in the uncertain security environment of the 1990s , Paris has begun to realize it can exert greater influence from within NATO than from the sidelines . Leotard ' s presence in Seville stands as the culmination of this thinking . The evolution , however , has been gradual . France has always maintained a representative at NATO military_headquarters in Mons , Belgium , while French observers have long attended NATO military committee_meetings . But it was only with the end of the Cold_War that this tentative cooperation intensified . It has been especially visible in the Balkans , where French aircraft help enforce the NATO-enforced &quot; no fly &quot; zone over Bosnia and two French frigates are part of a NATO-Western European Union naval task_force in the Adriatic imposing a U.N.-ordered embargo against Serbia and Montenegro . France was instrumental in NATO ' s decision to enforce a U.N. weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo . Still , the rapprochement has not come without resistance in Paris . NATO officials here recall earlier this year the surprise when the chief of the_French defense staff , Adm . Jacques Lanxade , showed_up at an alliance meeting of defense staff chiefs . &quot; About 15 minutes after the meeting began , he received a message from the ( French ) president ' s office , &quot; recalled one NATO official . &quot; He left immediately. &quot;</TEXT>
