   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : THIS L.A. JOLT IS FELT ALL OVER WORLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is 3:20 p.m. in Pasadena and 7:20 p.m. in Rio de Janeiro and 20 minutes past midnight in Rome and the World Cup has just been won by Brazil on a shot by Italy . Ole , ole , ole , ole . It is 3:21 p.m. in North_America and people from South_America are singing and Pele is leaping and Dunga is running and Romario is wearing a flag and Brazilian players are doing a madcap jumping-jack dance . Ole , ole , ole , ole . It is 3:22 p.m. in the United States and 94 # 194 people who have been sitting on the edges of their seats are now standing and cheering and crying and hugging and shaking their heads with amazement over a classic climax to a classic drama that had to be seen to be disbelieved . L.A. , L.A. , L.A. , L.A. A month of soccer that came_down to one final shot . A scoreless championship game won by one final miss . A perfectly wonderful tournament with an imperfectly wonderful ending . It is 3:33 p.m. at the Rose Bowl and 7 # 000 miles from the Roman Colosseum and Italians are suffering . Franco Baresi is crying in his coach ' s arms and Roberto Baggio is in emotional and physical distress and no one back home is singing or dancing . Italian athletes collapse to the grass . Blue on green . Exhausted . Played_out . All they can do now is watch . Multicolor fireworks snap , crackle and pop above the bowl . A single-engine airplane hovers overhead , carrying a wing-walker . Brazilian flags flap in the breeze . The triumphant coach , Carlos Alberto Parreira , is being tossed up and down by a human trampoline . The team leader , Dunga , is clutching the golden trophy with both palms as though having just discovered the Holy_Grail . He kisses it , then passes it to Mauro Silva , to Branco , to Zinho , to Viola , to Marcio Santos , who all do the same , kiss and pass along , kiss and pass along . Off they go , running , somehow summoning up life in their legs from some unknown resource , suddenly not tired in the least . They have the strength of a_zillion Brazilians . They take a victory lap . They lug with them the 11-pound , 14-inch , 18-carat dingus , the golden goddess of victory , the trophy created by a sculptor , Silvio Gazzaniga , an Italian . But now all any Italian can do is watch . It is 3:40 p.m. at the end of the road , and Rome is in ruins . Arrigo Sacchi , coach of the conquered , pats players on the heads , helps them to their feet , takes them into his arms . He says : &quot; The players were fantastic . They gave everything they had to give. &quot; They did . He says : &quot; It has been a wonderful experience . . . . I only wish we could have brought our Italian spectators the championship. &quot; They did not . Turn_back the clock . It is 12:30 p.m. in Pasadena and no one knows how this will go . Whitney Houston is_on a stage belting a number and Kenny G is in a jazzy Team USA uniform blowing sax . And then team captains Dunga and Baresi are exchanging gifts , and goalkeepers Claudio Taffarel and Gianluca Pagliuca are clasping hands , and superstars Bebeto and Roberto Baggio are paying their respects , and at midfield Brazil gets the ball rolling . And the players give everything they have to give . Legging all out for a ball , Nicola Berti goes crashing over a rail . A point-blank shot misses and Daniele Massaro pinches his temples in relief . A free_kick by Branco shanks wildly and keeps Italy ' s goalkeeper on his toes . A dipsy-do by Romario fools opponent Luigi Apolloni , over whose foot Romario goes toppling , face down into the pitch . No one scores . It is 1:40 p.m. and we begin the second_half . A header by Bebeto sends Pagliuca diving to his right . A long topspinner by Silva yo-yo ' s backward off the goal post , which the goalkeeper promptly kisses . A shot by Mazinho has a chance , but the alert Italian keeper smothers it . And no one scores . We go overtime . A trainer holds Italy ' s Antonio Benarrivo by the ankles and jiggles his limbs , trying to revive them . A teammate splits Marcio Santos ' legs like a wishbone and kicks his thighs , hoping to awaken them . On the ground , Branco douses himself with Evian and shampoos it with his fingers deeply into his scalp . The heat is intense . So is the game . But no one scores . We go_to penalty kicks . Baresi , a ball , high and outside . Santos , a ball , low and smothered by the catcher . Demetrio Albertini , a strike , high and hard . Romario , a strike , on the outside corner . The count is even . Alberigo Evani , a left-footer , goes_down the middle to give Italy the lead . Branco answers with a long , long approach and a left- footed shot to the keeper ' s left . Massaro misses , his shot smothered by a tumbling Taffarel . Dunga does not miss , netting one nonchalantly . It is 3:20 p.m. and Baggio , the best Italy has , steps to the task . It is his game to win or lose . There is no better man for the job , this beatific Buddhist . He concentrates_on the ball as millions back home make the sign_of_the_cross . He makes his approach . He makes his mistake . He boots the ball_over the net . The boot of Italy . It is a Sunday afternoon in suburban Los Angeles and it is a shot heard around the world . The World Cup does not end with a bang . It ends with a blank .</TEXT>
