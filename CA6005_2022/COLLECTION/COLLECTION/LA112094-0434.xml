   <HEADLINE> WHOSE RIVER IS IT , ANYWAY ? ; MORE CONCRETE VERSUS MORE NATURE : THE BATTLE OVER FLOOD_CONTROL ON THE LOS ANGELES RIVER IS REALLY A FIGHT FOR ITS SOUL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The five questions about the Los Angeles River most people ask : 1 . Is it a real river ? 2 . Is there any water in it ? 3 . Who owns it ? 4 . Can I drive_in it ? 5 . Ever find a dead_body in it ? Three of them are as easy to answer as paddling in a pond . Yes , the river has water in it ( sometimes ) . No , you ' re not supposed to drive_in it . And yes , the occasional dead_body shows_up . But the questions of whether the Los Angeles River is a real river and who owns it launch you onto a mounting flood_tide of riverine politics , especially these days . Once a natural river of mercurial , Mediterranean temper , it flooded_in winter , dried_up in summer and changed its course entirely every century or so . A natural force that fickle threatened people , and so the river , beginning in the ' 30s , was strait-jacketed into a concrete channel by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . On some maps , it was reduced to a dotted line -- a 58-mile-long , man-made watershed of dams , reservoirs , debris basins and storm drains , landlocked by chain-link fences , padlocked gates and signs warning off trespassers . To city folk , it was that spookily empty sunken freeway snaking through the San Fernando Valley along the back of Griffith Park , trimming the east edge of Downtown , then arrowing for the Pacific . Nature still had a claim on the river , of course , as anyone who has watched its waters plumbed by red-winged_blackbirds or its winter flood_tide hurtle hellbent for the sea already knows . But now a countywide battle with national implications about how to run the river , a battle percolating below ground for years , has burst to the surface . By next summer , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works are determined to begin construction of a massive flood-control project on the river , the first in decades , which the corps says could cost at least $ 500 million by its end . Environmentalists bent_on blocking it insist that the county should resist the call_for more concrete because such attempts to conquer nature really don ' t work . They envision restoring the river with more natural flood-control methods , river-bank parks , a greenbelt and a bike path from the mountains to the sea . Questions raised in the wake of last year ' s disastrous Mississippi flood -- about the cost and effectiveness of huge dam and levee systems and a growing , nationwide movement to restore &quot; trashed &quot; urban rivers -- may tip the balance in their favor . Now that the Los Angeles River is back on the map , what will it become ? Can people live with nature without trying to conquer it ? Can a city unlock its gates to the wilderness ? Is the L.A. River finally just a flood-control project , or is it a real river ? Who owns it and who will finally run it ? Points of Embarkation Resolving to run the Los Angeles River beginning at its source is a quick way to run_aground . Its ancient origin is in the rainfall on four mountain_ranges that frame the city ' s sprawl . In winter , snow and rain lash the mountaintops , roaring down their slopes into a lacework of arroyos and canyons , washes and rivulets that unite to become the river . But the Corps of Engineers has planted its flag in Canoga Park , insisting that the river springs from a concrete &quot; merge &quot; where two creeks converge there . How can I get a grip on a river with no clear beginning ? If there are many rivers -- at least in people ' s minds -- I ' ll need many guides . Randi Spivak , who works for the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority , a public agency that protects parks and open spaces , suggests one way_out of this reality swamp : She ' ll lead a daylong trip to both the river ' s sources . We begin high above Santa Anita Dam in the San Gabriels , hiking the canyons where the Forest Service fights floods and fires and avalanches of mud . &quot; It ' s a natural cycle , &quot; observes Terry Ellis , a Forest Service district ranger . These mountains and the river ' s headwaters have left him more humble than flatland hydrologists . &quot; Man can ' t do a better job than Mother Nature . She ' s in command of these natural resources. &quot; What effect humans can have stretches_out before us as we ply our way north toward Canoga Park . Spivak , a transplanted New Yorker , marvels at the sheer audacity and scope of the basin ' s never-ending development . A detour takes us back into the mountains , to the Park at Porter Ranch , a gated city of 1 # 200 ersatz Spanish haciendas and four-lane asphalt roads that engulf a whole canyon in the Santa Susanas . It ' s the paving-over of more and more watershed like this that has hydrologists worried about increased flooding on the river . &quot; Freeways and developments like this also create biological islands of habitat , &quot; Spivak says as we press_on . &quot; We ' re trying to buy land that would connect them back up. &quot; The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and other environmentalists envision the river as a major artery of a system of parks , trails and open land nourishing wildlife , animals and people , much as the river once connected remote outposts of settlers . As the day wanes , Spivak maneuvers through rush-hour traffic to a mean , gritty little Canoga Park bridge distinguished mostly by its proximity to a Hughes Aircraft employees credit_union . She parks . &quot; Got it ? &quot; she asks . &quot; Got what ? &quot; &quot; The beginning of the river , &quot; she says , amused at my shock . It ' s just two concrete walls curving together in a point , one side stamped &quot; Bell Creek. &quot; Calabasas Creek , the other half , is unnamed . The concrete riverbed is paved with Fritos bags . No sign marks this inauspicious rendition of the headwaters of the Los Angeles River . The poet Gary Snyder writes that he can heat the L.A. River laughing under all that concrete on its way to the ocean . But I couldn ' t hear anything above the roar of the traffic . A Way In Canoeist Danis Schure has a postcard of himself on the Los Angeles River that makes people guess he ' s running wild water in the Sierra . Given that he leads white-water trips on some of California ' s most heart-stopping wilderness rivers , you ' d think he ' d prefer the kind of nature that starts somewhere several hours ' worth of traffic_jams from the city . But Schure , a board_member of a group called Friends of the Los Angeles River , is no purist . He believes city dwellers need nature at_home as well as on vacation . We push_out in Schure ' s battered red canoe onto the river in Sepulveda Basin , in one of only three places where the river_bottom hasn ' t been completely paved over . Schure is as ebullient as if we had just embarked_on the south fork of the American River . &quot; On a clear day , you can see the Santa Susanas , the San Gabriels and the Santa Monica Mountains -- that ' s the watershed , and 10 million people live_in it , &quot; he says in his best tour guidese . ( Schure has taken scores of political luminaries canoeing on these waters , courting support for FOLAR ' s drive to restore the river. ) A breeze cools the sizzling city air , rippling across the water through a canopy of overhanging willows . A mallard family sizes us up and glides into our eddy . Tiny white butterflies drift by like cherry blossom snow in spring . Just upstream , busy Balboa Boulevard roars overhead . From the bushes , someone lost in a wilderness of the mind raves biblically . The &quot; riparian &quot; ( riverbank ) habitat here includes Coke cans , plastic bags and a shredded beach_chair . It is not a clear day , and I notice that we are paddling in circles . that ' s because we ' re confined to one of three tiny man-made ponds , blocked_off by piles of rocks , that push the river around in ersatz contrived whirlpools , as in a high_school physics ripple tank . The corps built these ponds in the ' 40s , Schure points_out , then nature took_over . He wishes more of the river looked_like this . But Schure admits that greening the river has to enhance , not undermine , flood_control . &quot; Since the river ' s man-made , I look_on it as a clean_slate , &quot; Schure says , as we lift the canoe out of this odd oasis . Spoken like a true Army_Engineer corpsman ? Schure chuckles . &quot; But the corps thinks only about getting_rid_of the water as fast as possible . Their attitude is , ' It ' s going_to the ocean , end of discussion. &quot; ' No Way Out Running the river south from Downtown to Long_Beach in my white rent-a-Honda was Diego Cadena ' s idea . Cadena , a 12-year veteran of Los Angeles County ' s Department of Public Works and its L.A. River project manager for the past three years , didn ' t want to use his car because he ' d just had it washed . It being summer , the riverbed should ' ve been bone_dry . But Cadena points_out that the city releases water year round from its treatment plants into the concrete ditch that is &quot; the river we built , &quot; as Army Corps engineers call it . Sure enough , there are puddles to be splashed through after we speed off a levee and shoot_down onto the riverbed . Driving around in the riverbed is strictly forbidden , no matter what you ' ve seen in the movies . Cadena says , grinning and reciting a list of chase scenes from films like &quot; Terminator 2 : Judgment_Day &quot; that have been shot on this riverine speedway . City bus_drivers get_to practice in the riverbed , which conjures_up mahouts maneuvering their elephants in the Ganges . At least six people , most of them kids , drown in_floods every winter , Cadena announces . When Cadena first talked to me , by phone from Public Works ' Alhambra headquarters , he urged me to watch the county ' s video &quot; No Way Out , &quot; made to warn school kids about how dangerous the river is . The footage is shocking . Here is the &quot; flood_control channel &quot; at winter ' s full flood-tide fury , sweeping its young victims along in a 30- to 45-mile-an-hour death grip . Frantic rescue workers los their footing on the slippery canted concrete banks and are swept_away themselves . ( There are no wild river oases here : no rocks , no shoals , no sandbars , no lulls between rapids. ) Firemen dangle from choppers or bridges in harnesses , grabbing at drowning people as they shoot by . A rescuer snags one victim , who ' s torn from his grasp by a churning riptide of an armchair , shopping_carts , tree limbs and ripped-up bushes . Once , the river was a gift . Kumi vit natives who settled along its banks 1 # 500 years ago called the land pwinukipar -- &quot; it is_full of water. &quot; The Spanish and Mexicans who followed echoed them , calling their ranchos la cienega ( &quot; swamp &quot; ) and las salinas ( &quot; salt pools &quot; ) . Because of the river , a great city could rise from the desert : Until 1913 , the Los Angeles River was L.A. ' s sole source of water . But the city was growing too fast . In the early years of this century , its population doubled every four years . At first , city engineer and water god William Mulholland favored conservation : replenishing the city ' s water_supply by slowing the winter rains ' rush to the sea through reforestation and small check dams and by leaving open spaces where water could filter underground . But , given the boom-town thirst of real_estate speculators , dam-happy engineers and big farmers , that ecological approach couldn ' t hold water . Droughts compounded the pressure . So did the river ' s vagrant nature . Once emptying into the sea at Ballona Creek in Playa del Rey , the river radically changed its course to flow through Long_Beach after a huge storm cut a new channel in 1863 . Says Public Works Deputy Director Carl Blum : &quot; A city needs a river that ' s predictable and reliable. &quot; Beginning in the 1930s , after a series of catastrophic floods , the Corps of Engineers vowed to tame the river ' s cycle of winter floods and summer droughts . The remaking of the L.A. River was a confluence of the Depression ' s national romance with flood-control projects , the era ' s faith in Big Government , a desperate need for jobs and New DEal pork-barrel politics . Seventeen thousand men were given jobs paving the river . By 1960 , the city had built itself a concrete watershed . As we speed south on the levees , Cadena at the wheel , the Century Freeway dominates the horizon , raising the flag of the Age of Engineering , like some Iwo Jima Memorial . The whole contraption lifts_off from pilings akin to flying buttresses rooted in the man-made riverbed . Concrete sheathes the landscape in every direction . Even the sky--blasted , grainy , gray -- looks paved over . For a wild moment , Assemblyman Richard Katz ' s ( D-Panorama City ) 1989 folly of turning the L.A. River into a freeway has an outre grandeur . But Cadena is more down to earth . Not a visionary or a master builder , he ' s an engineer who still believes_in public_service . And now he ' s pointing down at the roofs of the bungalows , trailer_parks and warehouses snuggled cheek-by-jowl against the river . In many places , the levee we ' re hurtling along towers over them . Should a flood breach these banks , miles of real_estate would be sleeping_with the proverbial fishes . If Cadena and his corps counterparts could stop the river , they would . The best they can do is shove back hard . It ' s a constant scramble to stay_on top of the natural cycle of flood , mudslides , fire and earthquake , and they have the kind of respect for nature ' s savagery that soldiers have for a formidable foe . On our trip downriver , Cadena points_out where Carl Blum once worked , the trailer so close to the levee that in_flood season he kept his car_parked right outside the door , key in the ignition , ready at a moment ' s notice to high-tail it for drier ground . Humans have their own cycles , and one of them is an ever-permutating notion of safety . Less than a decade after the corps finished constructing its L.A. River , it began planning to fight an even bigger flood . Increased urban runoff from development plus more sophisticated calculations by corps-county hydrologists led to that conclusion . While most city dwellers assume that the billions spent for flood_control guarantee protection , the question of how big a flood is actually on the horizon is largely theoretical . The corps and Public Works now believe a significant flood on the L.A. River could inundate as much as 82 square_miles and do $ 2.3 billion in damage , Cadena tells me as we barrel on . &quot; that ' s 11 towns flooded between South Gate and Long Beach. &quot; To meet this apocalypse , corps and county flood controllers propose to reinforce the levees and heighten them with four- to eight-feet walls on an 11-mile stretch of the lower Los Angeles River and on nine miles of the Rio Hondo , a main tributary south of Downtown . Adding the walls will also mean raising or modifying 11 bridges along that same stretch . Estimates of the final cost of the project are all_over the map . As controversy has grown , county engineers keep revising figures down , a practice that amuses long-time observers , who know how budgets_for big corps projects can mushroom . Corps and county engineers operate as if the Los Angeles County Drainage_Area Flood_Control Project -- LACDA as it ' s known to friends and foes -- is a done deal . But since 1986 , when Friends of the Los Angeles River was founded , beating LACDA has come_to symbolize what environmental writer Marc Reisner calls &quot; undoing the wrongs done_by earlier generations doing what they thought was right. &quot; Last summer , the L.A. River became a national environmental cause when American Rivers Inc. , a national river conservation organization , adopted it as an endangered river and the National Resources Defense Council began meeting with FOLAR about initiating a lawsuit to stop LACDA . For the corps , at least in L.A. , there ' s a whiff of the Alamo in the air . &quot; There ' s absolutely no environmental impact to LACDA , &quot; fumes corps project manager Stuart H . Brehm III , when I first ask him about the project . &quot; It ' s just a bunch of walls. &quot; It isn ' t just environmentalists who have LACDA engineers circling their wagons . In the wake of the catastrophic 1993 Mississippi flood , questions are being raised about the government ' s ability to protect people from natural disasters . An interagency task_force , chaired by the Army Corps ' own Brig . Gen . Gerald E . Galloway , raised serious questions about rebuilding the Mississippi ' s network of dams and levees and called_for a new , multi-agency approach to manage that river ' s entire watershed . &quot; I like analogies , &quot; says Army_engineer Brehm . &quot; Our work_on the L.A. River was finished in the 1960s , just like Interstate 10 . They ' re both about 500 miles long . Suppose somebody wanted to put a guard rail on the 10 to 20 miles between Downtown and Covina . But instead , people come_back and say , ' Let ' s rip_out the freeway and have a whole new transportation system. ' It ' s like reinventing the wheel. &quot; Paddling Upstream Reinventing the river , if not the wheel , is just what scientists working with L.A. environmentalists have_in_mind . Peter Goodwin , an engineer with Philip Williams &amp; Associates Ltd. , a San Francisco environmental hydrology consulting_firm , likes to tell the story of an Indian engineer who explained at an international conference how his country couldn ' t afford the huge dam and levee systems of the West . So farmers in the Ganges flood plain plant crops that can withstand floods and build huts that can be moved at a moment ' s notice . An Army Corps engineer there was stunned : &quot; Great idea ! &quot; Goodwin grins : Perhaps the wheel doesn ' t have to be reinvented , only rediscovered . &quot; The L.A. River was the high-tech engineering solution of the ' 40s , &quot; Goodwin says . &quot; It was a control model . But we ' ve learned some things since then . We like to talk now about managing a river , and that includes its whole watershed , not just the single channel most people think_of when they say river. &quot; Goodwin and likeminded hydrologists believe that many of the corps ' traditional methods may actually make flooding worse . The Army_engineers ' approach of speeding the river to the sea as fast as possible by pouring a narrow , perfectly smooth concrete channel creates a ferocious force of water that would do a tidal_wave of damage if levees were ever topped . It ' s safer , Goodwin and others insist , to slow a flood by diverting water and allowing it to be absorbed naturally into the water_table . A variety of methods could be tried , from widening the river to adding new reservoirs and &quot; spreading grounds &quot; ( where water sits until it &quot; percolates &quot; underground ) to reforestation and the use of porous materials in driveways and parking_lots to decrease urban runoff . Running a piece of the river in north Long_Beach with Jim Danza , head of FOLAR ' s technical advisory_board , is a grand way to scope out the possibilities . &quot; It ' s good you got here today , &quot; he says as we boost selves over the chain-link fence that is supposed to keep people out of the river . &quot; The county ' ll clear-cut most of this soon , so the water ' ll run faster. &quot; Danza grew_up whiling away afternoons on the river . &quot; The corps thinks I ' m still just playing_around down here , &quot; Danza jokes as he leads me into a riverbank jungle of wild sunflowers . Downstream at Del Amo Boulevard , Danza points to where the river was made narrower when the concrete channel was poured . Widening the river is one of the most hotly contested issues in L.A. County flood-control politics . Deputy Director Blum insists that if FOLAR has its way , the river would have to be made six times as wide as it is now to handle floodwaters . &quot; Besides the expense , the land isn ' t available , &quot; Blum says . &quot; L.A. is overbuilt. &quot; Danza and others scoff at this . &quot; There ' s much more to it than widening the river . There ' s the question of the steepness of the banks and the rate of the water . There are all_the ways we ' d divert water before it even reaches here , &quot; argues Danza . But he also believes there may be more land available than Blum and Cadena claim , pointing_out as we walk how many public-utility easements there are along this stretch of riverbank . No one has done a complete study of land use along the river , Peter Goodwin says , although a report done to support state Sen . Art Torres ' idea for a riverside light rail system found more easements than expected . Danza and other environmentalists are cynical about what they see as the contingent nature of corps-county safety estimates . They point to the fact that the corps originally calculated that the new walls need to be six to eight feet high , but when the cost came_in at more_than $ 700 million , the corps cut the walls down . Goodwin asks a critical question : &quot; If LACDA goes_through , is it really going_to give us flood protection ? Or will we , in another 30 years , have to go_back yet again to the drawing boards and pay_for raising the walls higher ? &quot; At least one downstreamer living_in the flood path doubts there ' s any danger at all . William Pearl , an attorney and president of the East Long_Beach Homeowners ' Assn. , armed with the fruits of countless Freedom of Information requests , challenges the corps-county ' s entire rationale for the LACDA project . What set_off the alarm about whether the current levees could be topped in the next huge flood were the readings on stream-flow gauges and the discovery of river debris on a levee near Long_Beach after a big flood_in February , 1980 . No one actually witnessed this . The next day , the Long_Beach Independent Press Telegram reported that the L.A. River had risen only to &quot; within nine feet of its banks in Long Beach. &quot; But Pearl found county records showing that the rain_gauges weren ' t working accurately that day . The same day ' s computer printouts of riverflow measurements are missing . Pearl discovered that county flood-control experts later--it ' s unclear when--penciled in estimated levels . In a brief challenging LACDA , Pearl argues that the debris on top of the levee , if it even existed , could well have been deposited there by unusual currents rather than the whole river overtopping the levee . Pearl also wonders why it took the corps until 1987 to determine there was a new flood threat when the alleged incident happened seven years earlier . He points_out that in 1983 , the Federal Emergency Management Agency did a flood-insurance study that found that the current flood-control system could withstand a significant flood . FEMA then backpaddled and decided there is a flood threat . As Pearl notes in his brief , the agency wields a heavy club on behalf of LACDA . The corps has led FEMA , which administers the National Flood Insurance Program , &quot; to commence a process that could rezone the area for purposes of onerous and crippling ' flood zone ' building restrictions . Many property_owners would also face the mandatory purchase of FEMA ' s flood insurance. &quot; County public relations handouts quote a USC study that found that the FEMA requirements would eventually cause a loss of more_than $ 30 billion in economic activity , a loss of more_than 177 # 000 jobs and would cost property_owners in southeastern L.A. County $ 122 million in annual flood insurance . Here ' s how the system works , according to the corps ' Stuart Brehm : &quot; FEMA uses our hydrology and our flood maps . Our report triggered FEMA coming_out ( to redraw their flood maps ) . &quot; Not surprisingly , most downriver politicians support LACDA , but Long_Beach is a weak link . A mounting battle to block FEMA from putting new flood maps into effect in Long_Beach , led by Pearl , homeowners ' associations and at least two city councilmen , is brewing . In response , in late October , FEMA postponed putting the maps into effect until next summer -- conveniently after LACDA ' s startup . FOLAR still hopes Long_Beach will pull_out of LACDA , which would sink the project . But except in Long_Beach , this is a closed , rarely scrutinized system . So far , the Board of Supervisors , which funds Public Works be setting property-tax assessments for flood_control , and Congress , which holds the corps ' purse_strings , have simply rubberstamped corps projects . Government engineers have the money to do feasibility studies while environmentalists do not . When the corps ' own environmental impact study on LACDA failed to adequately consider alternatives , as required by law , FOLAR lawyers threatened to sue . But the supervisors didn ' t let the contract to redo the report_out to independent hydrologists . It went_to Woodward-Clyde Consultants , a big L.A. engineering firm that does a lot of work for the corps . ( Woodward and Clyde ' s project manager for the study says the firm ' s contract with the county prohibits him from talking to the media. ) Still , the corps doesn ' t always prevail . In Vicksburg , Miss , the corps has a multi-million-dollar , full-scale partial model of the Los Angeles River to test its engineers ' calculations . Peter Goodwin reports that the Vicksburg model itself was flooded_in the 1993 Mississippi disaster . This Is a River Lewis MacAdams , FOLAR co-founder , journalist and two-time world heavyweight poet , suggests we commence our river trip at the jaunty cafe Eatz , the group ' s international headquarters , near Griffith Park . MacAdams says his romance with the river began on a bus ride he used to take_in the early ' 80s from Venice to Downtown , where he worked near the 1st Street Bridge . &quot; that ' s when I first saw the river . What a metaphor of how humans can screw_up ! And not only a metaphor , but the river was so bad , I knew it had to turn. &quot; Later , he reports , he went_down to the river for a private ritual . He asked the river if it minded being saved . &quot; The river didn ' t say no , &quot; MacAdams says , &quot; so I decided to go ahead. &quot; Before FOLAR could convince people the river could be restored , MacAdams explained to the first annual Trashed Rivers conference a year ago in San Francisco , &quot; we had to create the very idea that the river existed. &quot; FOLAR ' s first act was a performance art piece of civil_disobedience that began when MacAdams and fellow artists cut_out a section of chain-link fence to get_to the water . &quot; It was all about how rivers hate to be in a straight_line , and freeing this river , &quot; says MacAdams , grinning because he knows how this sounds to the engineers Downtown . Eight years later , FOLAR has a mailing_list of several thousand names , annual river cleanups netting_tons of garbage , a seat on the countywide task_force on the Los Angeles River , the ear of local , state and national pols and a national reputation for political savvy . Nothing happens on or near the river without FOLAR sticking an oar in , most recently to negotiate with CBS Studio Center over its plan to pave over the confluence of Tujunga Wash and the river for a parking_lot . &quot; I have to hand it to Lewis , &quot; says Diego Cadena . &quot; He put the river on the map. &quot; &quot; Let ' s go_down to the river , &quot; MacAdams says , scooping_up his 3-year-old daughter , a frequent companion on his rounds , and settling her on one hip . Bunches of grass that have split through the concrete wave purple beards at us as we shimmy down the bank . This is the longest stretch of the river , nine miles , with an unpaved riverbed . Common_yellowthroats weave among stands of cattails and reeds sprout from two sandbars in the riverbed . Contrary to what many LACDA supporters believe , when MacAdams and friends talk_about restoring the river , they don ' t mean unpaving it . &quot; We can ' t let the river run free or bring_back the lush cottonwood groves , &quot; MacAdams concedes . &quot; But we could follow cities like Paris and San Antonio , who ' ve made their urban rivers places where people can enjoy themselves. &quot; The romantic Seine , FOLAR activists remind people , is sheathed in concrete in Paris . But there isn ' t a single bench on the L.A. River , and this is the river ' s only footbridge , MacAdams points_out as he leads me across it . &quot; The corps sees only a degraded river they want to keep people away from . So they don ' t see what difference higher walls make , &quot; says MacAdams . &quot; But it ' s a step back. &quot; Peter Goodwin has worked_on designs that would set the levees back farther , allow banks to naturalize and disguise spreading grounds in parks . FOLAR is working with the city , the mountains conservancy and others on plans for a bikeway along the river from the mountains to the sea . The conservancy wants to connect Griffith Park and Elysian Park with a necklace of pocket parks and wildlife viewing spots to brighten the bikeway . &quot; Every day , people come_up with new ideas for the river , &quot; MacAdams says . We linger_over a patch of wild grapes embellishing the chain-link fence as we exit the river . Not ripe yet . A man is pulling_up something that looks_like wild yarrow and piling it neatly on a page of newspaper . MacAdams asks him in Spanish what it is . They chat . &quot; I don ' t know what it is in English , but he says it ' s a good tea when you ' re sick , &quot; translates MacAdams , charmed to learn of yet another of the river ' s gifts . Bridge Over Homelessness Cruising over the river via the classic Art Deco 4th Street Bridge , I ' ve got one eye on my &quot; Guide to Architecture in L.A. and Southern California &quot; and one on the bridge . People are honking , so I park to examine this engineering marvel on foot . Built_in 1930 by Louis L . Huet and Merrill Butler , the guide tells me , it has classic Moderne zigzag pylons , piers and railings , a medley of styles of Frank Lloyd Wright , Bertram B . Goodhue and Eliel Saarinen . Downriver at City_Hall , mayoral aide Tom LaBonge waxes eloquent about the Downtown bridges , &quot; one of the city ' s most unappreciated sights. &quot; A real river rat who grew_up on the river and still bikes there with his wife , Brigid , LaBonge got the few signs naming the river attached_to bridges Downtown . &quot; We ' ve got_to get people back on the river , like FOLAR says , &quot; enthuses LaBonge as he rushes_out to meet with the mayor . The next morning , I see the 4th Street Bridge through other eyes . Alice Callaghan , an activist for the homeless and director of Las Familias del Pueblo on 7th Street , leads me under the bridge , where we meet Lisa Smith , a young_woman who says she ' s been living_on the river for two years . &quot; I can ' t complain , &quot; she says , breakfasting alfresco on an avocado-and-jalapeno omelet she ' s cooked_up over an open_fire from food scrounged from local markets ' discards . &quot; We got bathing_suits . There ain ' t enough water in the river to swim , but we get_in and play , &quot; Smith tells me as Callaghan frowns . &quot; We worry about infections because of toxic and treated sewage runoff , &quot; Callaghan says on our way up_to the bridge , &quot; But poor people , especially immigrants , insist on using it like a real river , washing clothes , drinking and swimming in it. &quot; The Whole River , Part One Most of the frogs split when the river was paved over , but this place is still called Frogtown . It feels more like a village than an urban neighborhood because it ' s so self-contained : a slice between two bends of the river and the Golden State Freeway southeast of Griffith Park and across from Taylor Yard , the defunct Southern Pacific railyard . The meeting , at St . Ann ' s Church on the corner of Riverdale and Blake , is packed with the kind of people environmentalists rarely attract to meetings : working-class Vietnamese , Chinese , Filipino , Latino and Anglo homeowners , many of whom have lived_in Frogtown for decades . But the neighborhood is also the yearly scene of FOLAR ' s most festive and well-attended river cleanups . &quot; The Los Angeles River isn ' t Yosemite , &quot; says FOLAR board_member Martin Schlageter . It was Schlageter who made the phone_calls , wrote , ran_off and posted the leaflets announcing the meeting . &quot; It runs_through the rust belt of L.A. , and these are the park-poor neighborhoods that really need some nature. &quot; They also need some say about what happens to the river , FOLAR believes , and so the meeting has been organized to get reaction to a FOLAR study , financed by the California Department of Water Resources , on how to turn the abandoned Taylor Yard into a park and flood-control project . It calls_for terraces up from the river , playing fields that could divert water at flood time and re-creating wetlands . The study supposedly has the support of Public Works , but Schlageter got a letter early in the week from Carl Blum asking the group to cancel the meeting . &quot; Because of other urgently needed flood_control projects , &quot; Blum wrote , &quot; we do not expect funding to be available . . . at this time. &quot; Schlageter interpreted this as &quot; LACDA preempts everything , &quot; sent Blum a thank-you-for-your-input letter and went_ahead with the meeting . ( There may be other reasons Public Works has cut_away from the plan . Taylor Yard is the biggest parcel of undeveloped land left near Downtown. ) The meeting begins affably enough , as Schlageter and MacAdams , this time with both his kids in tow , chat_up neighborhood people they know , munch cookies and inspect maps and drawings of the proposals . But when the two activists begin the presentation of their ideas for Taylor Yard , accompanied by a backup harmony of translation into Spanish , Chinese and Vietnamese , the whole fragmented , paranoid nature of postmodern politics threatens to drown them out . No sooner does MacAdams explain that the drawings are only ideas , not a firm plan , than people begin to attack . &quot; We don ' t want a park here , it ' ll attract gangs ! &quot; &quot; How can we afford it ? &quot; &quot; That railroad land is poisoned ! &quot; &quot; We don ' t want a bridge_over the river ! The gangs will come ! &quot; ( There ' s no bridge in the proposal. ) MacAdams and Schlageter take the heat calmly . &quot; What ' s your dream for this place ? &quot; MacAdams keeps asking . &quot; Jobs ? Parks ? Flood_Control ? Improved property values ? How can we make the plan better ? &quot; The crowd turns_on the two organizers . &quot; What developer do you represent ? &quot; &quot; What kind of secret deals ? &quot; &quot; Who paid you off ? &quot; &quot; They ' re going to push us out of here ! &quot; Schlageter speaks_up : &quot; I ' ve been meeting with many of you for over two years . I ' m not from Sacramento ! Someone ' s going_to take_over the railroad yard . Why shouldn ' t it be the community ? &quot; &quot; We have no power ! &quot; &quot; Bull---- ! &quot; says MacAdams , amiably but forcefully . &quot; I started FOLAR with nothing because I saw not a concrete ditch but a live river that connected everyone in this city. &quot; He repeats the challenge : &quot; What is your dream for this land ? &quot; An old_man in the second row pipes_up : &quot; A merry-go-round ! &quot; This brings_down the house . People applaud . There is a flood of ideas , and Schlageter is hard_put to scribble them down : &quot; Trees ! &quot; &quot; A museum ! &quot; &quot; Nature lessons for the kids ! &quot; &quot; Soccer ! &quot; &quot; A pool ! &quot; The meeting ends on a high note , with Schlageter and MacAdams agreeing to go_back to the drawing board and report back at another meeting . The two are philosophical about the meeting ' s bitterness . &quot; Of course , they ' re worried , &quot; MacAdams says quietly . &quot; They remember Dodger Stadium. &quot; The Whole River , Part Two Things are considerably quieter the following week over at the Los Angeles River Master_Plan advisory committee_meeting at Public Works headquarters . The committee came_out of an effort in 1990 by Mayor Tom Bradley to reverse the &quot; neglect and disregard &quot; of the river and now coordinates the activities of 27 local , state and national agencies that have some piece of the L.A. River , from mosquito abatement to water treatment , and works with the public and the cities along the river to come_up with a master_plan for the whole river . Diego Cadena and the county are firmly in_charge . Cadena greets Schlageter affably enough but asks him to remove FOLAR leaflets from the table where everyone is signing_in . &quot; You ' re welcome to hand them out yourself , after the meeting , &quot; he instructs . Schlageter complies and , introduced to Cadena ' s new assistant , gives him the &quot; it ' s-so-great-we ' re-all-sitting-down-together &quot; speech . The corps , however , is low-profile at the meeting . &quot; We don ' t play politics , &quot; Brehm snaps , &quot; we ' re engineers. &quot; Corps engineers indiscreetly bad-mouth FOLAR ; in fact , corps officials in L.A. take such a jaundiced view of greening the river that they refused three years ago to spend $ 1 million appropriated by Congress to study such improvements . Does their hard-line approach complicate river politics ? I ask one committee_member at the meeting . He laughs nervously , goes_off the record and opines , &quot; the corps is like a 10-ten elephant . They don ' t have to be good at politics. &quot; The suave Cadena , on the other hand , has cultivated his grass roots , especially the city_managers and politicians of the downriver cities in LACDA ' s shadow . He opens the meeting with a description of various committee demonstration projects and then introduces Randi Spivak to report on the conservancy ' s community meetings about their greenbelt along the river from Griffith Park to Elysian Park . Cadena sums_up : &quot; This is a good_example of a project that can be included in the master plan. &quot; ( The conservancy , although one of the state ' s most enterprising environmental groups , has so far stayed out of the battle against LACDA ) . Cadena then splits the committee into regional groups to come_up with riverbank projects in their own back yards . But as the meeting drones_on , what seems most remarkable is what is not being discussed . LACDA is never mentioned . Committee_members admit that Public Works ' modus_operandi -- that the project is a done deal -- has never been challenged in their meetings . The master_plan , expected to be issue next year , won ' t reflect local river politics , let alone volatile national flood-control politics . In an L.A. where William Mulholland ' s Department of Water and Power has been taken_over by environmentalists who are busy shipping water_back to the Owens Valley and studying the use of treated sewage water to replenish the city ' s water_table , the committee ' s deliberations are especially gutless . Of course , the real L.A. flood-control politics aren ' t going_on in this room but in the trench warfare FOLAR and its friends are waging in every political , administrative and regulatory arena from Sacramento to Washington . The next six months will be critical . Will the Board of Supervisors finally enter the fray ? Will the feds ruberstamp the corps ' request , as usual ? Will the City of Long_Beach pull_out of LACDA ? Will the walls really start going_up next summer ? Will the river ever be allowed to come_back ? Already , there is some rumbling among pols about a compromise : The corps gets the lower river and LACDA , with the upper river ceded to the environmentalists for alternative flood-control experiments , parks and recreation . Cadena doesn ' t like this scenario : &quot; We don ' t compromise on safety , &quot; he says . And FOLAR is poised to file suit to block LACDA . Lewis MacAdams is out front : &quot; We want the whole river. &quot; Nature ' s River For my last run_down the Los Angeles River , my guide is Kimball Garrett , from the L.A. County Museum of Natural_History ' s Exposition Park office . Garrett is also author of a weighty tome for the California Department of Fish and Game on the river ' s wildlife . The report is a historical_record as well as a brief for respecting what natural beauty the river still has . If the river were restored , some wildlife that was forced_out could be brought_back and a new natural balance struck . Garrett suggests we retrace the route MacAdams and I took because the river near Frogtown is the richest_in wildlife . More_than 125 species of birds have been sighted here , Garrett tells me . As Amtrak roars by on the far bank , we shuffle down the canted concrete bank close to some starlings bathing by a Bud Lite crate . &quot; Is this a river or a garbage_dump ? &quot; Garrett grumbles . Turning_away , he points_out kids fishing for crayfish downstream . Garrett asks me if I notice anything odd about the birds here . &quot; Great blue heron , &quot; I reply , &quot; mallard duck , those poking in the reeds-- &quot; &quot; Cinnamon teals , &quot; Garrett supplies , pedagogically . A bird lover but not a birder , I fail the test , but he doesn ' t seem to mind much . &quot; They ' re all marsh birds , not normally native to rivers or the urban neighborhoods around here. &quot; Normally , the river would dry_up completely in summer , but now the county releases treated water year round , creating a pseudo marsh . Nature has responded by inhabiting it with wetland instead of riverine birds and plants . &quot; Makes you wonder what ' s really natural , &quot; I muse . Garrett chuckles . &quot; Well , it ' s as natural as L.A. , anyway. &quot;</TEXT>
