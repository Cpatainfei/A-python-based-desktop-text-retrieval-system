   <HEADLINE> NUCLEAR FUEL TOWN NOT EVEN A DOT ON MAP ; COLORADO : SOON , BULLDOZERS WILL SCRAPE URAVAN OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH . WHY ? THOSE RADIOACTIVE TAILINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This town supplied the uranium that produced the bombs that ended World_War_II and fueled the Cold_War nuclear arsenal . But the three generations that grew_up here remember it only as a great place to live . Soon , bulldozers will scrape the former community of 1 # 000 off the face of the Earth . Road maps no longer show it . ZIP_code 81436 has been reassigned . Sure , kids used to play in the radioactive tailings from the uranium mines at the remote sandstone-rimmed spot on the San Miguel River . But now , despite what the state considers hazardous , all that lingers in the air is regret and new meaning to the phrase , &quot; You can ' t go_home again. &quot; &quot; It ' s real sad for me . I can ' t feature it without those houses . I think we were the first family to move there ( in 1936 ) , &quot; said Shirley Vancil . Three of her four children were born there . Phil Espinoza , who moved to Uravan in 1957 after service in the Navy , called it &quot; a beautiful home with down-to-earth people . Most kids go_home to see their hometown . Our kids can ' t do that anymore. &quot; Debby Ackerson Jackson experiences that deprivation first-hand . &quot; Even after we left , we knew we could go_back , &quot; she said . &quot; Now it ' s like they ' re trying to make_it extinct. &quot; Jackson was born in Uravan in 1954 -- one of several hundred born in the Union Carbide mill town . The last residents left in the late 1980s , half a century after Vancil ' s family settled here . Today , some former Uravan residents and others are lobbying to save bits and pieces of the ghost_town . The old boardinghouse may qualify as a national historic site . But the recreation hall-church , the commissary , the clinic and the mill buildings are being knocked_down . Already gone are the houses of A , B and C blocks , their gardens and fruit_trees . The state of Colorado is requiring UMETCO , the Union Carbide subsidiary responsible_for the old company town , to clean it up , said Don Simpson , the state employee responsible_for radiation control . That means trucking its low-level radioactive tailings to the rim above Uravan and burying it . Billions of dollars already have been spent moving radioactive tailings away from former mining centers across the country . Some of those tailings may be brought here . Dr. Geno Saccamanno , a pathologist in Grand Junction who has studied uranium-related cancer cases for four decades , said much of the tailing removal was unnecessary . Saccamanno said work in uranium mines was deadly , particularly because most miners smoked . But most of Uravan ' s population was employed by the mill , not in the mines . Studies found normal cancer rates among the Uravan population . Simpson said state and federal agencies had no choice on Uravan . &quot; The international community says there is no safe level for exposure to radioactivity , &quot; he said . &quot; Every time I read about them removing the tailings , I think it ' s a waste_of_time . We don ' t glow in the dark , and we used to jump and roll in the tailings . We ' d get a mouthful . Even if they ' d told us not to , we ' d have done_it anyway. &quot; &quot; My mom used tailings in her garden and we had_the_best garden in town . She grew 1 # 000 varieties of irises , &quot; Jackson added . Simpson said it is hard to underestimate the fear the word radioactivity generates . Tourists who drive down 60 miles on the winding road through narrow Unaweep Canyon from Grand Junction sometimes stop here to ask cleanup crews if everyone who lived here died . The story of the uranium on 180 # 000-square-mile Colorado Plateau started with the Ute Indians . They used the soft , yellow carnotite ore found on the surface to paint their faces . Authorized visitors enter with escorts . Step into some of the remaining buildings and it ' s like entering the Twilight Zone . A bottle labeled &quot; yellow cake &quot; sat on the counter of one dark and empty building . Prospectors began scouring the earth for uranium at the turn_of_the_century after Marie Curie discovered radium in uranium_ore samples . Madame Curie herself visited the region to look_at samples . For a time , it was worth $ 120 # 000 an ounce . The market later collapsed . Uravan itself was set_up primarily to mine vanadium , used in the manufacture of steel . The town ' s name is a combination of uranium and vanadium . Vanadium tailings became an important source of uranium for the Manhattan_Project during World_War_II . Robert Sullenberger helped build a uranium-processing mill for the U.S. Army across the river from the vanadium mill . Sullenberger has no regrets about his involvement . &quot; It saved a lot of lives , &quot; he said . &quot; I recall some Japanese tourists stopping outside Uravan . I restrained myself from telling them this is where the bombs came from that we dropped on your country. &quot; Though it was one of the most secret operations in U.S. history , Uravan ' s own remoteness made most security measures superfluous . The town got a scare once when an errant B-17 was mistaken for a Japanese bomber . The biggest security breach was when game_wardens burst in driving a green Plymouth in search of mill employees shooting deer out of season . The Cold_War triggered a frantic search for uranium . Ten thousand people , on foot , Jeeps and by helicopters , tramped the Colorado Plateau . Uravan boomed again . Its facilities included a clinic , two swimming_pools , a baseball field , commissary and grade_school . The company provided a doctor . &quot; It was a good place to grow_up and I thought the company was good to us , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; On Saturday nights , we roller-skated , and Sunday morning , they turned it ( the building ) into a church . It was a good place to raise kids . &quot; I wish I could raise mine here. &quot; More_than 100 former residents showed_up at an annual reunion this year . Vancil said , &quot; We didn ' t need a radio because the ones who moved to Uravan were so friendly . We ' d all congregate in our yards . We would play until 9 p.m. and then we ' d get_into bed. &quot; The uranium market crashed in 1981 after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island cooled the nation ' s hunger for nuclear_power . Other countries were producing uranium cheaper . Without jobs , most residents had left by 1984 .</TEXT>
