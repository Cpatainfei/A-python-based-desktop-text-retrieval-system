   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; PATRIOT GAMES ; ITALY-IRELAND CELEBRANTS FORM A PAGEANT STEEPED IN ETHNIC PRIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the end , it was more_than a game . It was a far-off place and , a time -- yesteryear to come_home to . They came_in their thousands Saturday to a stadium from which they could see the shimmering towers of a great city immigrant ancestors had built . They came remembering . The Irish came from Dublin , yes , but joyous battalions trekked also from Queens , and Ohio , and with their pipes and their shamrock shirts from suburban New Jersey . There were some Italians from Rome , but many_more from New York , Philadelphia , and Ontario , Canada ; first-generation immigrants half a century removed from rural poverty , and proud second-generation Italians from Albany , N.Y , and Scranton , Pa. , who can ' t say &quot; Buon giorno . &quot; They came , 74 # 826 of them with flags , banners and ethnic pride , to cheer a game their fathers had loved more . And in the cheering , they turned Giants Stadium into a gigantic celebration of self . &quot; This is who I am , this is my heritage , &quot; said Bob Wade , who brought his bagpipes and a vanload of fellow Irish-Americans from Pittstown , N.J. &quot; I think Ireland can go all_the way -- and we ' ll be here all_the way. &quot; Pasquale Steriti left the_hills south of Rome looking_for work 20 years ago . He found it in Philadelphia . On Saturday he came_to the New Jersey haze with an Italian flag wrapped around his neck . &quot; I ' m American , sure . But I eat Italian , I dream Italian , my heart -- right here -- will always be Italian , &quot; Steriti said . Outside , traffic roared along the New Jersey Turnpike and streamed toward New York on Route 3 . New York has the Knicks , the Yankees and Mets , the new champion Rangers , probably also the Gay Games higher on its sports agenda than soccer . America at_large cares even less . Yet for all_of the rookie fans there Saturday afternoon , Giants Stadium quickly acquired an intensity so consuming it might have been in Europe , South_America or one of the other continents where soccer comes first . Like the game , the stadium Saturday belonged_to Ireland , the green , white and orange outnumbering the Italian colors seven or eight to one . &quot; It sounded like a home match to me , &quot; said Ray Houghton , who scored the only goal . &quot; We were told there would be more Italian fans than Irish , so we couldn ' t believe what we actually saw . It certainly gave us a great lift. &quot; And that , opined psychiatrist Joseph Gagliardo on his way to the stadium Saturday , is really the name of the game . Gagliardo immigrated to the United States from Sicily in 1953 . He lives_in St . Louis , but Saturday afternoon found him happily in a forest of Italian red , white and green . &quot; Are people crazy to come thousands of miles to see a soccer game ? No . Sports has replaced religion for many people . Soccer , well-played , is even more beautiful than religion , &quot; said Gagliardo , who hadn ' t seen Italy play in_person for 25 years . David Coleman , an Irishman who emigrated to Canada in 1975 , came from Toronto with two friends to cheer for Eire . &quot; It ' s a strange place to find a World Cup . People have no feel_for the game . You can ' t build soccer like this from the top down ; it has to come from the grass roots . It ' s a bit like having the World_Series in England , &quot; he said . Antonio and Amerigo Bevilacqua , who left a mountain village near the Adriatic_Sea 40 years ago for a new life in Canada , drove down from Welland in Ontario for the game , lugging two well-worn flags that read &quot; Forza Italia. &quot; &quot; People on this side of the ocean don ' t know about this game , &quot; Antonio said . &quot; that ' s their problem. &quot; Roberto Falciani , a Roman who found a pasta dish in Manhattan on Friday night he said was as_good_as any he has ever eaten_at home , ( fettucine with shrimp and green_peas ) is more sanguine about America ' s Cup . &quot; We need to encourage the game here , and this must help , &quot; he said . &quot; Of course people are different , and it may be that Americans never come_to love the game as we do. &quot; A lot of them loved it Saturday -- many for the first time , and perhaps most for reasons that had less to do with sports than with family histories . Joseph Colagiovanni , a young lawyer and second-generation Italian-American who grew_up listening to his father and uncles rave about a game he hardly knew in a language he barely understood , came_home with a rush Saturday . &quot; I ' m an American , &quot; he said . &quot; But today I ' m also Italian. &quot;</TEXT>
