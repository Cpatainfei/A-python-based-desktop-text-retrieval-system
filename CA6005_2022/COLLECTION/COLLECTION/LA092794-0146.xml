   <TEXT> A prosecutor told jurors Monday that he could deliver a complete picture of the &quot; murderous , torturous &quot; acts performed by a trio of men who are accused of killing a Maywood police_officer and a Van Nuys grocer during a crime spree . Jose Contreras , Benjamin Alberto Navarro and Edgardo Sanchez Fuentes are accused of killing Officer John Hoglund . Contreras and Fuentes are also accused of killing market owner Lee Chul Kim . The men face as_many as 31 charges in addition to murder , stemming from seven robberies of markets and restaurants from Van Nuys to Paramount . Prosecutors are seeking the death_penalty against all three . Deputy Dist . Atty . Michael Grosbard began opening statements Monday with a detailed description of the slayings . Grosbard told jurors that Fuentes and Contreras confronted Kim in the freezer of his store , where he was &quot; crying and pleading for his life. &quot; Then the pair shot him about a dozen times , the prosecutor said . In the Hoglund killing , Grosbard said that after the three men robbed George ' s Market in Maywood , they were caught_on videotape walking_around the store drinking Gatorade and &quot; just taking their own sweet time. &quot; They tried to flee when Hoglund arrived , but as they were leaving Fuentes allegedly sneaked_up behind Hoglund and shot him twice , Grosbard said . As the officer fell to the ground , Fuentes allegedly shot him again in the back of the head . Grosbard also alleged that during the other robberies , the various defendants shoved a gun in one man ' s mouth and threatened to blow his brains out , threatened to cut_off a woman ' s fingers &quot; one by one &quot; and tortured other employees with stun guns . Customers could hear one waitress ' &quot; cries of pain as the stun gun was applied to her flesh , &quot; Grosbard said . A distinctive watch and a black-and-white polka-dot shirt Navarro wore during several of the robberies along with pictures of a red Mazda sports_car that was used as the getaway vehicle in some robberies will also be introduced as evidence , Grosbard said . Witnesses during the estimated two-month trial will include Navarro ' s former girlfriend , who will testify that after the Maywood robbery the defendants were &quot; just giggling that they had killed the police_officer , &quot; Grosbard said . Deputy Public_Defender James Coady , who represents Fuentes , asked jurors to &quot; keep an open mind &quot; when considering prosecution evidence . He conceded that the evidence against his client is strong . Eric K . Davis , Navarro ' s attorney , told jurors that while evidence will show his client had some involvement in some of the robberies , it will fall_short_of proving he is a murderer or torturer as prosecutors alleged . The attorney for Contreras contended that his client killed neither Kim nor Hoglund . &quot; Mr. Contreras is a robber , but he is not a killer , &quot; defense_attorney James P . Leonard said .</TEXT>
