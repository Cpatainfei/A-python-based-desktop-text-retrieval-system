   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; UNSAVORY DEBUT FOR CANDY ' S ' HOSTAGE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Whether John Candy ever might have gone_on to develop a directorial style will never be known . What is known is that &quot; Hostage for a Day &quot; -- a TV movie that marked his directing debut , completed before his death -- wasn ' t a promising start . It hews closer to the cheap laughs of Candy ' s worst movie vehicles than the knowing ones of his great &quot; SCTV &quot; days , despite his having brought several fellow Second City alumni in front of the camera . The titular &quot; Hostage &quot; here is George Wendt , as a lovable lug who wakes_up on his 41st birthday married to a cheating , money-grubbing , shrewish spouse ( &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; / &quot; SCTV &quot; vet Robin Duke ) and pathetically indebted to her bullying father ( John Vernon ) . Terminally harried , he gets_out his old coonskin_cap and flashes_back , figuratively and literally , to his bucolic childhood when he dreamed of heading to Alaska . A chance meeting with his pre-adolescent sweetheart ( Christopher Templeton ) gives him the impetus to realize that dream . His escape plan : to feign being held hostage by Russian terrorists . The wacky catch : He really does end_up a hostage of Russian terrorists . This lowest-common-denominator slapstick doesn ' t play_out any more cleverly than it sounds . Passingly , Wendt and his newly rediscovered love manage some sweet moments , and any feature that features a disabled woman as a romantic lead without making a messy plot point_out of it deserves a good mention . But mostly the movie goes_for the mustiest , most exaggerated and misogynistic laughs , giving us bumbling law_enforcement , dastardly Russians ( one of which is a bearded Candy , in a cameo ) and gold-digger wives as guffaw fodder . This is two hours of comedy held hostage , best avoided by Candy fans who want to savor their memories . * &quot; Hostage for a Day &quot; airs at 8 tonight on Fox ( Channels 11 and 6 ) .
