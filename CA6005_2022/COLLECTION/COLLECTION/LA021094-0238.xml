   <HEADLINE> CUTS IN HEALTH PLAN SOUGHT AFTER BIG DEFICIT PREDICTION ; INSURANCE : WHITE_HOUSE AND REFORM BACKERS REACT TO BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATES . UNIVERSAL COVERAGE TARGET DATE MAY BE DELAYED PAST 1998 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration and its Capitol_Hill allies began searching Wednesday for ways to trim the cost of the President ' s health reform plan , which the Congressional Budget Office says will add $ 74 billion to the federal_deficit by the year 2000 . Possible targets include several costly new programs proposed by Clinton : coverage of long-term care , prescription_drugs and mental_health treatments , and federal payment of early retirees ' health_insurance premiums , Administration and congressional sources said . The pressure to cut costs could delay the target date for providing all Americans with guaranteed insurance coverage . The President proposed 1998 as the deadline for attaining universal coverage and White_House aides have not yet backed_away from that target . But they also are not ruling_out the possibility of a longer phase-in period . Also under discussion is the possibility of scaling back a proposal to make all but the largest employers join quasi-public health alliances that would purchase insurance on their behalf . By making participation in the alliances more voluntary , the Administration might be able to refute the CBO ' s characterization of them as virtually government &quot; agents , &quot; analysts said . No decisions have been made and the Administration at this point appears more inclined to work in concert with congressional committees than to redesign the President ' s 1 # 342-page plan by itself , senior Administration officials said . &quot; We ' re not going_to rewrite the President ' s plan because of the CBO , &quot; said one senior Clinton adviser . &quot; It ' s more a process of working it out on the Hill. &quot; On Capitol_Hill , many lawmakers suggested that bringing Clinton ' s bill in_line with the CBO ' s deficit projections would not be difficult . Even CBO Director Robert D . Reischauer agreed that the projected shortfall could be offset . &quot; There are a number of things that could be done . The differences between the Administration ' s numbers and ours are not large relative to the menu of options , &quot; Reischauer told the Senate Finance_Committee during a second day of congressional testimony . On the one hand , the Administration clearly must respond to the CBO ' s critique , particularly the issue of deficit reduction . As the President acknowledged during a White_House photo session : &quot; Those are all things that we can work_out . Those are relatively minor budgetary considerations and other things that we can work_through to get our numbers in_harmony with theirs . So I ' m not at all concerned. &quot; On the other hand , any effort to lower the Clinton plan ' s total cost probably means scaling back major elements cherished by influential interest_groups , including the American Assn . of Retired Persons , labor_unions , consumer groups and the auto industry . Elements of the proposed benefits package that would be guaranteed to every American are being reconsidered because the CBO ruled that the Administration has underestimated the cost of insurance_premiums under its plan by 15 % . If the CBO is correct , that would mean that the government would wind_up paying more_than the White_House has estimated to provide subsidies for low-income workers and small employers . The additional costs would add $ 25 billion to the deficit between 1995 and the year 2000 , the CBO estimated . Instead of trimming or eliminating specific benefits , the Administration could reduce outlays for subsidies by lowering the minimum amount that employers must pay on behalf of their workers , analysts said . Clinton ' s plan , as written , would require employers to pay 80 % of an employee ' s premiums , with the worker paying the rest . &quot; Those things are negotiable , &quot; said one top Administration health adviser . &quot; But if you go_down to 50-50 , we ' d say no . We picked 80-20 because that ' s what most people have. &quot;</TEXT>
