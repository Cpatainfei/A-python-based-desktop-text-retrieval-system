   <HEADLINE> U.S. STUDY BACKS ALLOWING EXPORT OF ALASKAN OIL ; ENERGY : THE REPORT PREDICTS THAT LIFTING THE ' 70S-ERA BAN WOULD CREATE JOBS AND BOOST FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT REVENUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s hard-pressed independent oil producers will get good news this morning as the Clinton_Administration releases details of an unpublished but long-awaited study of lifting the current ban on Alaskan crude_oil exports . The Energy_Department cost-benefits study predicts that ending the ban would create as_many as 7 # 000 jobs in the California and Alaska oil_industries . It also estimates a boost to the federal treasury -- mostly from higher oil-tax revenues -- of as much as $ 284 million annually . The independents , along with British Petroleum Co. , have long lobbied to end the ban they say forces oil that would otherwise be sold in Asia into the glutted California market , depressing regional crude prices . The independents argue that the ban has cost the state 32 # 000 oil_industry jobs since 1985 as it has stifled investment and production in California ' s vast oil fields . Opposition has come chiefly from U.S. maritime unions and shippers , who have been guaranteed the tanker jobs by a federal law controlling marine traffic between U.S. ports . That federal law does not apply to exports . Now such opposition has apparently ended in a still-unannounced agreement between BP -- the big Alaska producer hoping to enter the Asian market -- and the maritime interests . Though oil_company executives have declined to confirm the details , BP apparently will agree to use U.S. crews and ships in any tanker traffic from Alaska to Japan , the expected destination for much of the surplus Alaskan crude . &quot; We understand that the unionized shippers and the oil and gas_companies and their unions have been coming_up with a win-win solution , &quot; William White , assistant energy_secretary , confirmed to The Times &quot; And we are encountering many people in Congress and union leaders who have historically opposed the export of Alaskan North Slope oil , who have this past week come_to us and said that they have reversed their position. &quot; Though the Clinton_Administration has yet to take a formal position on the ban , several high Administration officials have said that the ban should be overturned if the Energy_Department study finds such a move to be cost-effective . Though the study makes no specific recommendation on the ban , White said , highlights of the study show significant economic benefits to the West Coast oil_industry : * If world oil prices remain low , the study estimates a net job gain in the California and Alaska oil_industry of 6 # 500 in 1994 and 1995 , dropping to 6 # 000 jobs total during the period 1996 to 2000 . If world oil prices rise , the early job increase would be less -- 4 # 800 in 1994-1995 -- but gains would be greater later on : up_to 7 # 000 jobs from 1996 through 2000 . * Those numbers would be even higher if the apparent pact with the maritime industry is formalized , since the study estimates that lifting the ban could otherwise jeopardize 230 to 494 U.S. shipping jobs in 1994 and 1995 , using figures from the U.S. Department_of_Transportation ' s maritime administration . * California crude_oil price hikes from ending the ban would increase federal revenues by $ 20 million to $ 25 million annually at the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve , near Bakersfield , currently the nation ' s seventh-largest producing field . Adding increased federal tax_revenue from the expected higher sales of other oil producers would bring the annual federal benefit to $ 284 million from $ 50 million . * Higher crude prices would give producers incentives to make new investments in existing fields , lessening &quot; pressures for new production in frontier and wilderness areas , &quot; White said . These investments are particularly important for the North Slope , where production has been declining in recent years . * No &quot; significant &quot; impact on consumer gasoline prices at the pump would be expected , according to White . Independent producers will agree , saying that retail gasoline prices are tied to world , not regional , crude prices . However , some retail analysts have predicted price hikes in California of up_to 6 cents a gallon . * Some West Coast refiners , which the study found to have higher profit_margins than the rest of the industry , could be hurt by a rise in their crude_oil feedstock prices . Atlantic Richfield Co . and Exxon Corp. , two other big Alaska crude producers , consume virtually all their production in their own refineries and distribution networks and would not be significantly affected by a lifting of the ban . * The ban dates_from the oil crises of the 1970s , when Congress was considering legislation to enable construction of the Trans-Alaskan pipeline to bring crude_oil from Alaska ' s remote North Slope south across the state to the year-round port of Valdez . At a time when angry Americans were waiting in gas_lines , the ban was included to assure U.S. control of the domestic crude as well as jobs for the U.S. maritime fleet . &quot; The world has changed , &quot; White said . For one thing , he noted , when the ban was passed no strategic reserves existed -- such_as the 600 million barrels now stockpiled at Elk Hills -- beyond what is produced for_sale , to protect the nation against foreign oil boycotts and other crises . Most observers expect only 150 # 000 barrels a day to be diverted from the Alaskan production to Asian markets , White added . U.S. consumption is about 16 million barrels daily , with 7 million barrels of that from foreign producers . White expects to detail findings from the report in Monterey , Calif. , today at the annual meeting of the California Independent Petroleum Assn. , which has lobbied forcefully to end the ban .</TEXT>
