   <HEADLINE> TOBACCO ' S PR CAMPAIGN ; THE CIGARETTE_PAPERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> War . Mighty tobacco against the U.S. surgeon_general , the Food and Drug Administration , federal and state and local politicians , the media , the no-smoking crusaders , lawyers for dead and dying cigarette_smokers . Attacks against cigarette makers grew more ferocious this year . Tobacco ' s skeletons popped_out monthly in media exposes and in testimony before Rep . Henry A . Waxman ' s congressional committee hearings . Politicians papered the nation with proposed legislation to ban smoking here , there and everywhere . More recent , more ominous , is the FDA Drug_Abuse Advisory Committee ' s conclusion that cigarettes could be classified as a drug because of nicotine . That decision is crucial if the FDA decides to regulate tobacco products . Government control of nicotine alone portends a death rattle for tobacco ' s allure . At stake is $ 45.3 billion a year in cigarette sales and 2.3 million tobacco-dependent jobs . Understandably , cigarette makers dare not weaken . They must doggedly defend the smoke they sell . And money is their shield , their weapon . With it , they reward the friendly and savage the enemy through a legion of scientists , lawyers , publicists and lobbyists . Their approach is nothing new . It was conceived in 1953 during a similar anti-smoking frenzy -- so far , it has worked . What follows is a keyhole peek into the genesis , reasoning and execution of tobacco ' s strategy these 40 years . The story is told by the participants themselves through excerpts drawn from confidential notes , memos and letters never intended for public rummaging . We focus_on the decade before and the decade following the 1964 U.S. surgeon seneral ' s report that concluded that smoking can kill . STRATEGY It is 1953 . New scientific studies have connected cigarettes to lung disease . America has awakened to the dangers of smoking . Scientists have begun to expose the connections between cigarettes and lung disease . Shaken by unrelenting bad press and declining tobacco stocks , the chief_executive_officers of six leading cigarette makers -- American Tobacco Co. , R . J . Reynolds , Philip Morris , Benson &amp; Hedges , U.S. Tobacco Co . and Brown &amp; Williamson -- agreed that &quot; drastic action &quot; was necessary . They held a historic secret meeting Dec . 15 , 1953 , in New York City with John Hill , a founder of Hill &amp; Knowlton , the world-class public-relations firm . Their mission was to plan tobacco ' s counterattack . &quot; . . . before the current health crisis arose , cigarette manufacturers never met together at any time except at dinners honoring some industry leader . ( Tobacco should ) sponsor a public relations campaign which is positive in nature and is entirely ' pro-cigarettes. ' The current plans are for Hill &amp; Knowlton to serve as the operating agency of the companies , hiring all_the staff and disbursing all funds. &quot; ( Hill &amp; Knowlton memo , Dec . 15 , 1953. ) &quot; The situation is one of extreme delicacy . There is much at stake . . . . There is nothing the manufacturers can say or refrain_from saying that can stop people from being interested in their health , nor allay their fear of cancer . So_long as the causes and cure of this dread disease remain unknown , people will be subject_to waves of fear regarding it . &quot; We should create a committee with ' research ' in the title so that the public recognize the existence of weighty scientific views which hold there is no proof that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung_cancer . . . . The underlying purpose of any activity at this stage should be reassurance of the public . . . . this project would explore such questions as : Why do mice show no tendency to develop lung_cancer in experiments where they live half their lives in smoke filled chambers ? Why has the rise in lung_cancer been most marked among men , although the greatest rise in the use of cigarettes in the last 25 years seems to have been among women ? What are the benefits and enjoyment derived from smoking . . . ? What are the smoking habits of long-lived distinguished public leaders ? What are the human ills erroneously attributed to tobacco over the centuries ? &quot; ( Hill &amp; Knowlton memo to cigarette executives , Dec . 24 , 1953. ) Cigarette manufacturers followed Hill &amp; Knowlton ' s advice . They formed the Tobacco_Industry Research Committee in January , 1954 , with a first-year budget of $ 1.2 million and supported by 23 Hill &amp; Knowlton employees . STOP THE PRESSES The Tobacco_Industry Research Committee ' s media blitz began with a two-page advertisement : &quot; A Frank Statement to Cigarette_Smokers , &quot; which appeared Jan . 5 , 1954 , in 448 newspapers with a cumulative circulation of 43 million . The ad was followed in April with &quot; A Scientific Perspective on the Cigarette Controversy , &quot; a booklet quoting 36 scientists questioning smoking ' s link to health_problems . &quot; ( The booklet ) was sent to 176 # 800 doctors , general_practitioners and specialists . . . ( plus ) deans of medical and dental colleges . . . a press distribution of 15 # 000 . . . 114 key publishers and media heads . . . . days in_advance , key press , network , wire_services and columnist contacts were alerted by phone and in_person . . . and . . . hand-delivered ( with ) special placement to media in Los Angeles , Chicago , Cleveland , Pittsburgh and Washington , D.C. The story was carried by hundreds of papers and radio_stations throughout the country . . . . staff-written stories ( were ) developed with the help of Hill &amp; Knowlton , Inc. field offices. &quot; ( Hill &amp; Knowlton memo , May 3 , 1954. ) &quot; The proposed Argosy piece , by Dick Reddy , is now scheduled for the August issue and the latest revision we have seen in proof form shows that it will be an extremely positive piece. &quot; ( May 25 , 1955. ) Next , a June press_conference introduced the committee ' s new scientific director , Dr. Clarence Cook Little , a cancer researcher . &quot; ( The press_conference ) was covered by Dave Garroway ' s NBC-TV program , Today . Delos Smith , UP Science Editor , filed a very complete story of 600 words . AP filed two stories , one 80 words and the other 120 words . . . . AP radio to 1 # 400 stations . . . UP-Movietonews to 80 some TV_stations ; MGM-Telenews to 80 some TV_stations . . . . &quot; ( Hill &amp; Knowlton memo , June 18 , 1954. ) &quot; ( The research committee ) now has the basis needed for carrying_on a long-range plan of public relations . . . establishing the ( research committee ) in the public mind as a constructive force in scientific_research . . . . research should be carried forth on . . . current scientific opinion holding that no case has been proved against tobacco . . . . how the public is carried_away by over-simplified reading of scientific experiments. &quot; ( Hill &amp; Knowlton memo , June 21 , 1954. ) &quot; Although the industry has been bedeviled by sensational headlines generated often by publicity seeking researchers . . . the trend is beginning to turn . . . . The bulk of editorial comment now appearing approves and , at times , applauds the action of the industry . . . . Advance knowledge was obtained of a story on smoking by Bob Considine for Cosmopolitan Magazine . Information was supplied resulting in seven revisions . . . to the story which was already in type . . . . One negatively aimed program ( WNBT ) . . . was postponed after discussion ( with us ) . Another TV_program ( ABC-TV , Martin Agronsky ) . . . ended on a favorable note after conferences ( with us ) . . . . Assistance was provided to the New York Times for a Sunday magazine piece . . . . Special conferences are held with AP , UP and INS science writers. &quot; ( Hill &amp; Knowlton secret memo , July 17 , 1954. ) Hill &amp; Knowlton documents describe sit-down sessions with the New York Times , AP , UP , INS , Coronet magazine , the New Yorker , New York Post , Time , Newsweek , U.S. News &amp; World Report , Business Week , Cosmopolitan , the New York Daily News , the New York World Telegram &amp; Sun , Real magazine , Redbook , Bluebook , Harper ' s , Look Magazine , Life and Reader ' s Digest . According to an Oct . 7 , 1954 , memo , TIRC researchers pitched tobacco ' s case in private meetings with Arthur Hays Sulzberger , president and publisher , New York Times ; William Randolph Hearst Jr. , president and publisher , Hearst Consolidated Publications ; Mrs . Helen Rogers Reid , chairman_of_the_board , New York Herald Tribune ; Jack Howard , president , Scripps-Howard Newspapers , and Roy E . Larsen , president , Luce Publications . Hill &amp; Knowlton reported that the publishers felt that &quot; the sessions had been most helpful in clarifying the Tobacco_Industry Research Committee program. &quot; &quot; ( We have compiled ) a cross indexed card file . . . on medical and scientific papers regarding smoking and health . . . in some 2 # 500 medical journals . . . . a cross indexed card file on medical opinions . . . as noted in press , radio and other popular media is compiled . . . . &quot; ( Hill &amp; Knowlton report , &quot; considered highly confidential . . . . no additional copies be made . . . this copy not be placed in files , &quot; Aug . 17 , 1954. ) Tobacco ' s strategy was reflected in newspaper_headlines : &quot; Lung_Cancers Found in Non-Smoking Nuns , &quot; &quot; Air_Pollution Blamed for Lung_Cancer , &quot; &quot; New Survey Disputes Tobacco-Cancer Link , &quot; &quot; Finnish Doctor Challenges Cigaret-Heart Ill Link , &quot; &quot; Lung_Cancer Linked To Auto Exhaust , &quot; &quot; Japanese Research Finds No Link Between Lung_Cancer , Cigarettes , &quot; &quot; Heavy Smokers With Low Mortality , &quot; &quot; Cigaret Theory of Cancer Hit , &quot; &quot; Three Scientists Raise Questions About Cigarette-Cancer Theory. &quot; Research committee publicists nurtured such pro-smoking articles as &quot; Go Ahead and Smoke Moderately &quot; in Pageant magazine ; &quot; Phony Lung_Cancer Scare , &quot; in People Today ; &quot; Who Says Smoking Gives Men Lung_Cancer ? &quot; and &quot; Smoke Without Fear , &quot; published by True magazine . &quot; The first big scare continues on the wane . . . . the lynching party seems to have been called_off , at least temporarily . Treatment of the cigarette-health issue in public media continues to improve from the Tobacco_Industry Research Committee ' s point_of_view . Even adverse stories now tend to carry modifying statements . Positive stories are_on the ascendancy . . . . The research program . . . has won wide acceptance in the scientific world as a sincere , valuable and scientific effort . &quot; On the other side of the ledger . . . . Anti-tobacco crusaders continue to ride the health issue. &quot; ( Hill &amp; Knowlton memo , April 28 , 1955. ) TOBACCO SHUDDERS Then the other shoe dropped . In 1960 , U.S. Surgeon_General Dr. Luther L . Terry announced the &quot; need for a new look . . . that smoking has adverse health effects. &quot; A committee that Terry formed in 1962 delivered its report in January , 1964 , and forever changed the country ' s view toward cigarettes . Drawing_on studies of 1.2-million smokers and thousands of animals exposed to tobacco , the 387-page report declared that smoking can cause cancer of the mouth , larynx , esophagus and lung , plus chronic_bronchitis , emphysema , heart_disease , stunted babies and other ills . In response , the Tobacco_Industry Research Committee was reorganized , expanded and renamed the Council for Tobacco Research ( CTR ) . Hill &amp; Knowlton ended its relationship with the council in 1968 . &quot; The Council for Tobacco Research has served no public relations function since that time , &quot; says Dr. James F . Glenn , who is currently chief_executive_officer of the CTR . To date the council has handed_out $ 242 million in research grants to institutions in 44 states and 12 countries . Among them were Harvard , Dartmouth , MIT , Rutgers , Columbia , Cornell , Yale , Notre Dame , Stanford , USC , the University of Texas , Houston , and six schools in the University of California system . After the 1964 surgeon_general ' s report , the research council began recruiting and funding scientists to debunk anti-smoking research . &quot; . . . the industry must somehow find a way to make an effective technical rebuttal to the arguments of the anti-cigarette forces . Only in this way will the present burden be lifted from us . . . . Our philosophy is not to start a war , but if war comes , we aim to fight well and to win. &quot; ( Philip Morris internal memo , Oct . 28 , 1964. ) &quot; ( The Council for Tobacco Research is ) the best and cheapest insurance the tobacco_industry can buy and without it the Industry would have to invent ( it ) or would be dead. &quot; ( CTR official ' s handwritten note , mid ' 60s. ) &quot; ( The Council for Tobacco Research ) provides ( the tobacco_industry ) with its own scientific experts who may also serve as scientific spokesmen . . . ( to ) disprove the allegations that smoking is a primary etiological factor_in some diseases . . . . If we are satisfied . . . we could encourage its publication. &quot; ( CTR memo , Oct . 18 , 1965. ) Favorable studies were summarized in the research council ' s annual reports until 1976 and publicized in press_releases . Here is a representative_sample : Cancer : &quot; ( Test ) results lend little to support the hypothesis that cigarette smoke can act_as a direct contact carcinogen in the human lung. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1964-65. ) &quot; Association between lung_cancer and smoking is ' incomplete. ' &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1965-66. ) &quot; ( The increase in lung_cancer ) has been exaggerated considerably by the progressively increasing skill of clinicians in diagnosis . . . leading to overdiagnosis. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1966-67. ) &quot; Many experiments . . . have failed completely to produce lung tumors . . . with cigarette smoke . . . in lungs of ducks , hamsters and mice. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1968-69. ) &quot; Vital statistics for the past 15 years do not show a significant rise in reported cases of bladder cancer . Hence , the reported statistical association ( between smoking and bladder cancer ) has lacked rational explanation. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1968-69. ) &quot; Heart_Disease and Hypertension : &quot; Persons who stopped smoking showed significantly LESS cardiovascular_disease incidence than those who had never smoked at all. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1964-65. ) &quot; . . . studies suggest that the physiological act of eating sugar prevents the cardiac effects of smoking. &quot; ( Research council scientists ' abstract , 1964. ) &quot; Rabbits or hens . . . did not show any convincing differences in the condition of their arteries if given nicotine regularly. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1964-65. ) &quot; An entirely unexpected finding was the higher prevalence of coronary heart_disease among non-smokers than among ex-smokers , a paradox which casts doubt upon the alleged role of smoking in the genesis of coronary heart disease. &quot; ( Research council scientists ' abstract , 1965-66. ) &quot; There have been reports claiming a relationship between smoking and hypertension , but , paradoxically , it has been found that men who are heavy smokers generally have lower blood_pressure than non-smokers. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1968-69. ) Pregnancy : &quot; A significant question that remains unanswered is whether the decreased birth weight of infants born to smokers is detrimental. &quot; ( Research council scientists ' abstract , 1965-66. ) &quot; While this report clearly indicates that nicotine modifies uterine function in the rat . . . the authors emphasize that the results cannot be extrapolated to women who smoke. &quot; ( Research council scientists ' abstract , 1978. ) SMOKERS DO IT BETTER Nicotine . The bottom_line . &quot; We need to stress the benefits that sixty million smokers derive from the use of our products. &quot; ( Philip Morris memo , February , 1971. ) &quot; Nicotine stimulates the learning process , more particularly among the animals that are originally relatively slow learners. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1966-67. ) &quot; In short , the chronic administration of nicotine appeared to stimulate the brains of the rats , making the animals function more effectively. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1970-71. ) &quot; Without nicotine . . . there would be no smoking . No one has ever become a cigarette_smoker by smoking cigarettes without nicotine . Smoke is beyond question the most optimized vehicle of nicotine and the cigarette the most optimized dispenser of smoke . Think_of the cigarette pack as a storage container for a day ' s supply of nicotine . Think_of the cigarette as a . . . dose unit of nicotine. &quot; ( Confidential Report , Research Council Conference , St . Martin Island , the Caribbean , 1972. ) &quot; Habitual smokers proved more efficient and better able to sustain performance when they smoked than when they did not. &quot; ( Research council scientists ' abstract , 1975. ) &quot; Under ( nicotine ' s ) influence there is greater retention of learning . . . . It would appear to be the perfect tranquilizer . ( Research council scientists ' abstract , 1977. ) BLAME THE SMOKER Research committee scientists scavenged other explanations for smoking ' s growing disrepute . &quot; . . . inherited or genetic make-up causes predisposition to smoking and lung_cancer . To prove this is the industry ' s best hope. &quot; ( Handwritten council memo , March 21 , 1975. ) &quot; . . . A number of factors . . . that differ in smokers and nonsmokers and may be predictors of early heart and artery disease . Still another researcher has found a significant difference in basic brain_wave patterns of smokers and nonsmokers. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1968-69. ) &quot; Heavy smokers are characterized by features of : defiance , impulsiveness , danger seeking , neurotic lability , and oral preoccu- pation . . . . relationships with their fathers were more disturbed. &quot; ( Research council scientists ' abstract , 1970. ) &quot; . . . heredity and smoking probably contribute about equally to the likelihood of developing ( lung ) disease. &quot; ( Research council scientists ' abstract , 1970. ) HUH ? &quot; The earlier death of those that smoked more and those that smoked cigarettes was_due to the fact that they were born later and lived at a time when there was more smoking , rather than because smoking was life-shortening . . . . Individuals die essentially at a single point_in_time , one cannot precisely measure the effect of smoking on longevity since the probability of a given individual being a cigarette_smoker or non-smoker is related to the birth year ! &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1970-71. ) DON ' T TREAD ON ME Punch and counterpunch became tobacco ' s strategy . &quot; In this area ( of lung disease ) , the statistics are even more confused and of more dubious accuracy than they are in the case of cancer or ( heart ) diseases , by reason of problems of diagnosis and nomenclature. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1966-67. ) &quot; . . . changes in the popularity of such terms as ' emphysema , ' may have resulted in a fictitious increase in reported prevalence rates. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1969-70. ) &quot; We need to call attention to the exaggeration and lies of the anti-cigarette zealots . . . . &quot; ( Philip Morris report , 1971. ) &quot; . . . Any assumption that the results ( of painting mice with cigarette tar ) can be extrapolated directly to other species , especially man , is highly presumptuous. &quot; ( CTR annual report , 1973. ) &quot; We have gone_over from . . . the ' vigorous denial ' approach , the keep quiet and take it on the chin attitude , to the strongly voiced opposition and criticism . . . . this counter-propaganda is a better stance . . . . We need to give the scholarly reply to the improper studies. &quot; ( Philip Morris internal report , 1981. ) &quot; Attacking bad research . . . attacking researchers themselves , where vulnerable. &quot; ( Philip Morris memo , March 24 , 1981. ) HARDBALL Dr. Freddy Homburger , a scientist funded at the time by the research council , scheduled a press_conference at a scientific convention in Atlantic_City in April , 1974 , to accuse the tobacco_industry of attempting to suppress important findings about the harmful effects of smoking . &quot; Got press_conference killed without ( Homburger ) knowing why or how . . . . He came_into the press room . . . and nicely hastened out the door . . . . I doubt if you or Tom will want to retain this note. &quot; ( A confidential memo from Leonard Zahn , a long-time research council publicist , April , 1974. ) AND THE BEAT GOES_ON In 1990 , fifth grade students at Willow Ridge School in Amherst , N.Y. , wrote R . J . Reynolds Tobacco Co . about smoking advertisements and health . A company publicist replied : &quot; Dear Sir or Madam : &quot; A number of your fifth grade students have written ( about smoking advertisements and ) . . . about the controversies surrounding cigarette smoking . The tobacco_industry is also concerned about the charges being made that smoking is responsible_for so many serious diseases . Long before the present criticism began , the tobacco_industry in a sincere attempt to determine what harmful effects , if any , smoking might have_on human health , established The Council for Tobacco Research -- U.S.A. &quot; Despite all_the research going_on , the simple and unfortunate fact is that scientists do not know the cause or causes of the chronic diseases reported to be associated with smoking . . . . We would appreciate your passing this information along to your students. &quot; Science Bought and Sold A hand-scrawled note from the 1960s rated 44 scientists as_to &quot; which ones might be the greatest benefit to the ( tobacco ) industry. &quot; The note was written by an official of the Council of Tobacco Research , which funds scientists with tobacco money . The note ended : &quot; Use ( the ratings ) for what you think they might be worth and throw the paper away. &quot; On of the 44 was Dr. Gary Friedman , now 60 , of the Kaiser-Permanente Medical_Care Program in Oakland . &quot; I needed support for research back then , &quot; he explains . &quot; They were very interested in how smokers differed from nonsmokers in health and mortality. &quot; Friedman worked with Carl C . Seltzer , a Harvard anthropologist , whom the research council considered a favored scientist who has consistently criticized anti-smoking research . Friedman now says that at first he &quot; compromised &quot; with Seltzer on their early studies . After a further study convinced him that &quot; quitting smoking really seemed to do some good , &quot; Friedman says , Seltzer and the research council &quot; disassociated themselves &quot; from those findings . Friedman published his results in the New England Journal of Medicine in February 1979 . Seltzer wrote the to Journal : &quot; These authors conclude that stopping smoking appears to result in a substantial reduction in coronary mortality . I find the procedures used in their article to be questionable and the conclusions to be unjustified . . . . &quot; &quot; Just as well , &quot; Friedman reflects . &quot; There ' s a feeling in this building today of the wish we had never taken that money. &quot; Seltzer , now retired , insists that Friedman &quot; wanted to continue getting money from the council but didn ' t want me to have an equal say . His link to smoking and mortality was two or three times more_than anybody in the country . Sure , the council gave me and Harvard a lot of money . . . maybe a_million or so . I was at it for a great many years . The council liked my research . I also showed there was no relationship between heart_disease and smoking . And this business of secondary smoke , passive smoke , is absolute nonsense . . . nonsense . I don ' t care what the surgeon_general says ! What does the surgeon_general know ! He only knows what he is told ! &quot; In fairness , Seltzer and others argue that many research council grants have little to do with smoking or are sometimes critical of it . But there ' s little disagreement that the research council ' s influence on anti-smoking scientists went beyond money . &quot; Scientists by their very nature are very cautious , &quot; adds Michael Cummings , a senior research scientist at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo . &quot; that ' s one of the things the tobacco_industry has exploited . They look_for people to run counter . If the tobacco_industry can find a person or two to expound the opposite view , it creates controversy , casts doubt on the other scientists . They won ' t say what they believe . It ' s science by intimidation . Controversy means no grants , no funding , no tenure . Money is something scientists must have and the tobacco_industry and the research council have plenty of it. &quot; &quot; The tobacco_industry trained anti-smoking researchers to be irresponsibly cautious , &quot; says Stanton Glantz , a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco . &quot; Tobacco_industry intimidation causes the health community to apply a standard of proof so high on smoking dangers it consistently has understated the risks of smoking and has historically delayed actions year after year . The tobacco_industry jumps up and down and screams controversy ! It gives cigarette companies their best asset -- credibility . It ' s a fig_leaf for the politicians. &quot; Blowing Smoke After the release of the 1964 surgeon_general ' s report , the Council for Tobacco Research bombarded anti- smoking studies with a thesaurus of skeptical words , phrases and clauses . &quot; Fails to support . . . tenuous and inconclusive . . . still quite obscure . . . little evidence at present . . . no clear picture has emerged . . . lacked adequate controls . . . misdiagnosis . . . still no assurance . . . lend little to support . . . did not sustain any claims . . . suggest attention to the smoker rather than the smoke . . . speculative . . . baffling . . . superficial . . . unanswered . . . masked . . . overdiagnosis . . . fictitious . . . does not duplicate real_life situations . . . still little is understood . . . many anomalous and contradictory aspects . . . no firm evidence . . . problems of diagnosis and nomenclature . . . misstated or overstated . . . an impressive failure . . . still remain to be explored . . . cannot be concluded . . . dubious accuracy . . . confusion of contradictory findings . . . welter of fragmentary , confusing and inconclusive observations. &quot; The story draws from three main sources : Documents reported by Richard W .
