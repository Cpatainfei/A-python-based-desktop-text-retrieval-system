   <HEADLINE> QUEBEC ELECTS SEPARATISTS , OPENS DEBATE ON SECESSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Quebec voters Monday elected a separatist party to govern the province , launching Canada into what promises to be a debilitating yearlong struggle over national unity . The Parti Quebecois , led by Jacques Parizeau , won 77 seats in the 125-member National Assembly , as the provincial parliament is called . It ousted the Liberal_Party , which has governed for nine years and was led by Premier Daniel Johnson . The Liberals took 47 seats ; one seat went_to a splinter party . The popular vote was much closer , however , with near-complete returns showing the Parti Quebecois edging out the Liberals by only 0.4 % and failing to win a majority of the votes cast . Each district is decided on a winner-take-all basis . The election gives Quebec separatists what they view_as their last chance in a generation to achieve independence for the predominantly French-speaking province . Parizeau , who now becomes premier , has pledged to call a provincial referendum on sovereignty within 10 months . &quot; Sovereigntists have come_back to power in Quebec_City . . . and in 1995 we will ask the question that makes us a country , &quot; Parizeau told an enthusiastic crowd here in the provincial_capital . Polls show that a majority of the province ' s 4.85 million voters are opposed to separation , and the failure of the separatists to gain a majority of the popular vote underlines that sentiment . Nonetheless , the sovereigntists believe they can reverse the trend with a vigorous new government here . No one is sure how the rest of Canada would react if Quebeckers did vote for sovereignty in a referendum . Speculation ranges from predictions the two states would part amicably , as did the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993 , to scenarios of violent clashes . Canadian Prime_Minister Jean Chretien , a Quebecker who strongly favors national unity , did not participate in the provincial campaign , apparently preferring to hold his fire until the coming battle over the referendum . In a statement following the Parti Quebecois victory , he emphasized Canada ' s strengths as a country and asked Parizeau to work with national_leaders in solving its problems . &quot; Over the last 127 years , we have created a tolerant , generous and united country . This Canada -- we can and we will continue to build it together , &quot; Chretien said . The separatists don ' t have to be able to win a referendum to disrupt Canada ' s political agenda . Whatever the ultimate outcome , a bitter and encompassing campaign over Quebec ' s future could divert the nation ' s attention from other issues , such_as economic and social program reforms intended to reduce the burgeoning national_debt , among the highest in the industrial world as a percentage of gross_domestic_product . It also could discourage investment and raise tensions between Quebec ' s French-speaking majority and the province ' s native peoples , its English-speaking minority and immigrant communities , all_of whom generally oppose separation . Parizeau sought to head_off such tensions Monday night by saying , &quot; I want as much as I can be to be the premier of all Quebeckers. &quot; The United States ' stake in the future of Canada is large . Canada and the United States are each other ' s largest trading partners , longtime military allies and holders of the longest undefended border in the world . Traditional U.S. policy has been that this is an issue for Canadians to decide , and Vice_President Al Gore repeated that line on a recent visit to Ottawa , the Canadian_capital . Monday ' s election represents a milestone for Parizeau , a 64-year-old former university economics professor who embraced the independence movement in 1969 . A graduate of the London School of Economics , Parizeau served as finance_minister in the first Parti Quebecois government , headed by the late Rene Levesque , founder of the separatist movement . That government lost a 1980 referendum on sovereignty , putting the separatists into a decade-long decline . Their hopes were revived in 1990 and 1991 , with the failure of two successive attempts to amend the Canadian constitution to meet Quebec demands for special status to preserve its French language and culture . Parizeau ' s announced game_plan is to move quickly and boldly on the sovereignty issue . Shortly after taking_office later this month , Parizeau is expected to ask the provincial parliament to declare a &quot; declaration of intent &quot; to leave Canada . He also will appoint a commission to draw_up a constitution for the proposed new state . Parizeau also has indicated he will withdraw Quebec from a number of federal_government programs ; seek to seize jurisdiction over issues , such_as fishing rights , traditionally controlled by the federal_government ; refuse to participate in an upcoming reform of Canada ' s social_service programs , and generally contest Chretien ' s initiatives . In this , the Parti Quebecois will be assisted by its separatist allies in the federal Parliament , the Bloc Quebecois , led by the charismatic Lucien Bouchard . Bouchard told reporters Monday that he expects conflicts between the Parizeau and Chretien governments , and , despite the odds , he predicted that the separatists will win the referendum . But victory in a referendum appears problematic , given current polls , Quebec ' s history and the Parti Quebecois ' failure to win a majority Monday . The central issue for French-speaking Quebeckers , who account_for 82 % of the province ' s 6.8 million residents , is whether their desire to preserve their language and culture through independence is worth the economic uncertainties of cutting loose from Canada . While the Quebec campaign commanded Canadian and international attention because of the separatism issue , within the province the dominant issues were the economy , which only recently has begun to emerge from a long recession , and the voters ' exhaustion with the Liberal government . Indeed , sentiment for independence dropped steadily in the polls throughout the campaign , even as support for the Parti Quebecois held steady or increased . The latest surveys showed Quebeckers opposed to secession from Canada by about 60 % to 40 % , which is the same margin by which a 1980 sovereignty referendum was defeated . Johnson , 49 , became premier in January , succeeding Robert Bourassa , who retired because of poor health . He inherited a government that was seen by many voters as not caring about Quebec ' s jobless and unwilling to do much to correct chronic , double-digit unemployment . During the 50-day campaign , and in the months leading_up to it , Johnson sought to reverse that by putting_forward a new economic program and simultaneously warning that the Parti Quebecois ' focus_on sovereignty would distract a Parizeau government from job creation . In response , Parizeau argued that Quebec independence would be decided in the promised 1995 referendum and that this election was about good government . Parizeau also contended that independence is necessary for Quebec to achieve its economic potential . Chretien ' s absence from the campaign was criticized in some quarters . But federal election officials often stay out of provincial politics , and Chretien is sensitive to complaints in the rest of Canada that the federal_government pays too_much attention to Quebec . In any case , Chretien is far more popular outside of Quebec than within the province , and an appearance on behalf of Johnson might have backfired . Chretien was justice minister in 1981-82 and was instrumental in helping Prime_Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau enact a new Canadian constitution over the lone opposition of the Quebec government . Many Quebeckers never have forgiven Chretien .</TEXT>
