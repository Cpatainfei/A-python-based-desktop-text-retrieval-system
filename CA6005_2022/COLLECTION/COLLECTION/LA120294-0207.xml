   <HEADLINE> AIDS IS NO . 1 KILLER OF YOUNG AMERICANS ; EPIDEMIC : CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL DIRECTOR WARNS RATE OF INFECTION IS GROWING IN HETEROSEXUAL COMMUNITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Declaring AIDS to be the leading cause of death among Americans between the ages of 25 and 44 , the director of the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention said Thursday that the disease has moved dramatically into the heterosexual community and that the transmission rate there is growing . &quot; In the history of epidemics , AIDS is among the worst in the world , &quot; CDC Director David Satcher told a gathering of Atlanta business and labor_leaders . He said knowledge of the extent of HIV infection is &quot; imperfect and incomplete , &quot; but he added that &quot; every day we ' re learning something new about the virus and moving closer to a cure. &quot; In the United States , 400 # 000 people have contracted AIDS since 1981 , and 250 # 000 people have died from it . Increasingly the victims are intravenous drug_users and their sexual partners . &quot; In December , 1984 , three-fourths of AIDS cases were men who have_sex with men , &quot; Satcher said . &quot; This year , this group makes_up only a little more_than half of all cases , so you see the epidemic is changing. &quot; Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is the leading cause of death among men in the 25-44 age_group and the fourth leading cause in women in that same group -- behind cancer , accidental_injuries and heart_disease , according to preliminary 1993 data compiled by the CDC . Among young African American women , who make_up 82 % of American women with AIDS , it is the leading cause of death . From 1985 to 1993 , the proportion of people with the AIDS virus acquired through heterosexual transmission increased from 2 % to 7 % . Satcher was one of the speakers Thursday at the World AIDS Day conference in Atlanta held to promote adoption of AIDS awareness and education programs in the workplace . The CDC has helped companies establish education programs and AIDS policies for the last two years -- making the case , as one speaker said Thursday , that for most employers the cost of implementing a comprehensive education program would be less than the medical cost of treating a single person infected with HIV , the human_immunodeficiency_virus . William H . Baumhauer , chairman and chief_executive of DAKA International , a food service management company that also owns the Fuddruckers hamburger chain , gave several examples to illustrate why such programs are necessary . In 1987 , a college where the firm operated a food service operation insisted that DAKA fire or remove from campus a gay general_manager suspected of having AIDS . The next year , employees at one restaurant refused to work with a co-worker married to an HIV-infected man . And three years ago , a college_student who believed that DAKA was hiring people with AIDS because she had read the firm had implemented an AIDS education program expressed fear that she ' d contracted the disease after eating a salad that had blood on it . Baumhauer said the red substance was beet juice . &quot; Since no vaccine is available , education remains one of our few tools to fight this epidemic , &quot; Baumhauer said . One participant in the conference was Jerald A . Breitman , the director of professional_relations at the pharmaceutical firm Burroughs Wellcome Co . who is infected with HIV . He stressed the importance of companies developing a policy for educating employees and for handling workers who have contracted HIV , because the fear of unemployment along with rejection from family and friends prevents many people from acknowledging their illness and seeking treatment .</TEXT>
