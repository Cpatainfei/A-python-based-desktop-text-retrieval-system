   <HEADLINE> CARD WARS ; VISA DEAL HAS AMERICAN EXPRESS FUMING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Chef won ' t take The Card anymore -- and American Express is mad . In its latest skirmish with Visa , American Express has accused its rival of striking a secret deal with celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck . American Express says Puck agreed to drop its card at two restaurants in return for &quot; millions of dollars in advertising &quot; from Visa for Puck ' s Malibu restaurant , Granita . Visa plans to run television ads beginning next week saying Granita won ' t accept the American Express card . A spokesman for Puck acknowledged the deal with Visa , but said that the famed chef -- who did for pizza what Evian has done for water -- had planned to drop the American Express card anyway . &quot; It costs us twice as much ( as Visa ) to take the American Express card , &quot; said Tom Kaplan , managing general partner of Spago , Puck ' s trendy pizzeria on Sunset Boulevard , which stopped accepting the American Express card Dec . 1 . &quot; Like everyone else , we are constantly faced with having to control our costs , and this is a cost we can control. &quot; Said Visa spokesman Gregory Holmes : &quot; We don ' t have to pay merchants not to accept American Express. &quot; American Express launched its attack via advertisements appearing in Friday ' s editions of the Los Angeles Times , the San Francisco Chronicle and two entertainment_industry journals , Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter . In its ad , American Express not only fired at Visa , but took a shot at Puck as well , advising readers to &quot; consider the thousands of other fine restaurants in the Los Angeles area that gladly welcome American Express. &quot; The episode underscores the intensity of the competition for consumer charge dollars between Visa and American Express . In the last two years , Visa has been aggressively pursuing trendy restaurants and upscale merchants -- typical American Express customers -- in a bid for prestige and more corporate charge business . Meanwhile , American Express has been busy quelling discontent among some merchants who are annoyed with the company ' s higher payment processing fees . American Express has also lost cardholders , especially with the advent of no-fee Visa and MasterCards . The number of cardholders fell 2.6 % during the first nine months of last year , though American Express said some of that was_due to an intentional effort to weed out poor accounts . Past marketing deals similar to the one Visa reached with Puck have triggered angry reaction from American Express . The company successfully sued Visa over a television commercial featuring the ski resort town of Telluride , Colo. , forcing Visa to change the ad . American Express said the commercials falsely implied its card wasn ' t accepted anywhere in Telluride . Thomas O . Ryder , president of American Express ' establishment services division , said the deal between Puck and Visa is &quot; intended to disparage American Express broadly . At most , Visa will make $ 200 # 000 from those restaurants . Would you pay $ 1 million to get $ 200 # 000 ? &quot;</TEXT>
