   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN CLAIM OF SERBS ' BOMBING MUSLIM BRIDGE QUESTIONED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A NATO jet swooped over a besieged northern town Sunday after Bosnian state radio claimed Serbian warplanes destroyed a bridge in an attack similar to the one that provoked NATO retaliation . With Bosnian Serb troops barring access to Maglaj , there was no way for NATO or U.N. officials to visit the site to check the claim that planes attacked the Muslim-held town about 40 miles north of Sarajevo . But officers from the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization raised questions about the report . Squadron Leader John Jeffery , a NATO spokesman in Naples , Italy , said early warning aircraft did not detect any air_attack on Maglaj . &quot; If we had , we would have taken action , &quot; he said . Such a raid would be a flagrant violation of the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone imposed by the U.N. Security_Council over Bosnia . It would also be a challenge to NATO , which has been patrolling the zone since April and has begun showing a new resolve to act forcibly against warring parties in the former Yugoslav state . A week ago , two U.S. Air_Force F-16 fighters shot down four Bosnian Serb fighter-bombers in central Bosnia that U.N. officials said were attacking Bosnian government targets . A NATO official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said visibility was too poor when the two bombing_runs reportedly took_place for accurate attacks on a bridge . NATO reconnaissance aircraft also flew over the area around the time the second bombing_run was reported but saw nothing , he said . Bosnian Serbs ridiculed the Muslim-led government ' s claim , accusing the Bosnian army of faking an air strike . &quot; There have been no ( air ) bombardments of Maglaj , &quot; said a statement from the Bosnian Serb military in Banja Luka . &quot; The so-called Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina , following its old recipe , sets fire to heaps of old tires , wishing to create an impression of bombardment of the town. &quot; Bosnian radio and neighboring Croatia ' s HINA news_agency said Serbian planes targeted Maglaj ' s only bridge , which spans the Bosna River , and destroyed it . HINA said its story was based on reports from ham radio operators in Maglaj . Gen . Rasim Delic , commander of the Bosnian army , reported the alleged bombing to Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , commander of U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia , and demanded &quot; more effective &quot; NATO action . Bosnian radio said Serbian artillery also shelled Maglaj after the air_attack . With the nearly 4-week-old Sarajevo cease-fire between Bosnian Serbs and Muslim-led government forces under strain , the U.N. chief representative in the former Yugoslav federation , Yasushi Akashi , flew to Sarajevo for talks . He met with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Pale east of Sarajevo and later in the capital with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic . Akashi said he made progress toward reopening Tuzla ' s airport , which has been kept closed for much of the nearly 2-year-old war by shelling from Bosnian Serb artillery .</TEXT>
