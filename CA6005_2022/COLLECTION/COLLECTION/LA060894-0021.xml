   <HEADLINE> TO INVITE FARRAKHAN IS TO INVITE RACISM ; ANTI-SEMITISM : THE NAACP EMBRACE OF THE NATION OF ISLAM LEADER WILL IN THE END HARM BLACK PEOPLE AS WELL AS JEWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Louis Farrakhan participates in the National Leadership Conference of the NAACP in Baltimore on Sunday , many Jews and others sensitive to anti-Semitism will be demonstrating outside . Farrakhan ' s anti-Semitism and homophobia are_well documented . They are not matters of the distant past , a time when he was talking_about Judaism as a &quot; gutter religion. &quot; Although he flirted briefly with lowering his anti-Semitic profile and tried to dissociate from the worst excesses of his lieutenant , Khallid Abdul Muhammad , during a recent television call-in show in California Farrakhan reverted his old hateful ways , suggesting that Jews had set_up the Federal_Reserve_system and retained control over its money . Imagine how black people would feel if a prominent Jewish leader were going_around the country and drawing large Jewish crowds to hear him denounce &quot; black crime. &quot; There are indeed a disproportionate number of black people who are arrested for crimes of violence , but there is nothing that makes their crimes black crimes . To talk_about black crime suggests that there is something in the racial group that is the problem , and such a suggestion is false and racist . Similarly , there are Jews who have economic power , but they are not exercising that power for the sake of their community , under the auspices of the Jewish community or by virtue of being representatives of the Jewish community . To point to their Jewishness is to try to stir_up resentments by others who have less economic power , and to suggest that it is &quot; the Jews &quot; who run things . This is false and racist . It ' s false because it ignores the many Jews who are poor , the many Jews who are working-class , the many Jews who are struggling professionals and business people , and it falsely suggests that affluent Jews function in some corporate way , as Jews , to exercise disproportionate economic power , which they don ' t . In short , it falls_into the old Nazi stereotype . Anti-Semitic stereotypes were never publicly confronted and exposed as falsehoods in the United States in the way that sexism or anti-black racism were confronted in the past few decades . Anti-Semitism was prevalent in the 1930s , then became unfashionable when the United States entered the war with Germany . Perhaps because a full confrontation of anti-Semitic ideas would require a deep challenge to anti-Semitic depictions of Jews in the Gospel of John and some_other sections of the New Testament , &quot; polite society &quot; has resisted doing more_than keeping silent about the subject . When a small group of German and Polish theologians suggested recently that the Catholic_Church might have to take some public responsibility for its role in creating the conditions that led to the Holocaust , they were quickly disavowed . So these ideas have continued to flourish , particularly at the economic margins . Many African Americans have legitimate reasons to be angry about an economic_system that has a structured rate of unemployment that guarantees that at least 8 % of the population won ' t get a job , and then concentrates that unemployment in a vastly disproportionate way on the black community . But instead of focusing anger at the real economic and political elites , Farrakhan and other demagogues encourage black people to express that anger against Jews . Not that there isn ' t real reason for black people to be angry at some Jews . Many of the mainstream Jewish organizations and publications have , over the course of the past 25 years , defected from the social-justice agenda , adopted neoconservative politics and prominently opposed programs that would alleviate the worst suffering visited on the African American community . Journals like Commentary and the New Republic can hardly contain their glee at the prospect of throwing young black mothers off welfare and young black_men into prison . When Jewish intellectuals seek to blame poverty on &quot; the culture of poverty , &quot; conveniently forgetting how just 100 years ago Jewish poverty was similarly attributed to Jewish pathologies , they participate in a racism that legitimately earns the ire of black people . But African American leaders should also be vocal about the fact that Jews were , by and large , the only group to side with black people in opposition to Ronald Reagan and George_Bush in the 1980s and continue to back liberal programs of which they are the major beneficiaries . Moreover , if black people ignore racism in their own community , how can they expect others to fight its inevitable resurgence in the larger American polity should economic_conditions worsen ? Many Americans , caught_up in the ethos of selfishness that continues to dominate this society , are only too happy to find excuses to lower their own taxes by voting against candidates who support social programs for the poor . It has often been Jews who have been in the vanguard of groups reminding their fellow citizens of their moral responsibility toward the oppressed . While many of us will continue to play this role out of commitment to Torah values , there are many_more , torn between idealism and self-interest , who are increasingly resistant to a social-justice agenda when they perceive that the most oppressed are spitting in their faces . Farrakhan may be marginal at the moment , but the NAACP invitation has given him new avenues of entrance to more respectable communities . Taking the hint from its national office , the Fresno chapter of the NAACP sponsored a major rally at the Fresno Convention Center at which Farrakhan was the featured speaker , and Arsenio Hall hosted him on national television . The more his voice is legitimized , the more his poison will seem acceptable . Yet Farrakhan is only the tip of the iceberg , as was made clear last month when black students at San Francisco State University unveiled a mural portrait of Malcolm X , decorated in the margins with anti-Semitic and anti-Israel symbols . So we who will be demonstrating against Farrakhan will also be making a much more positive demand : that black leadership join with us and other progressive Jews to instigate a joint campaign against racism in the Jewish community and anti-Semitism in the black community . To keep it honest , the anti-racism campaign in the Jewish community should be supervised by black people , and the campaign against anti-Semitism in the black community should be supervised by Jews . I continue to respect the NAACP and support its leadership . But we Jews want the black community to assure us that Farrakhan and a culture of anti-Semitism are not the wave of the future and that Jews will not be alone in facing this kind of racist assault . While some black leaders have been reluctant to challenge anti-Semitism publicly , fearing that they will be seen as &quot; giving_in to Jewish pressure , &quot; others realize that anti-Semitism is a poison that does damage to blacks as well , providing an excuse to those who wish to ignore the continuing economic deprivation and police brutality facing a significant percentage of black people . Joining with Jews to combat black anti-Semitism should in no way weaken the credibility of black leaders , except among people so hostile to Jews that they are willing to sacrifice the best interests of the black community .</TEXT>
