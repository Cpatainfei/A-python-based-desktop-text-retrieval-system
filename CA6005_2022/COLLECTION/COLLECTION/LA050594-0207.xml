   <HEADLINE> CRITICS SAY CONFLICTS CERTAIN IN SIMPSON ' S TOURISM JOB ; GOVERNMENT : ANAHEIM COUNCILMAN COUNTERS THAT HE TOLD HOTEL-MOTEL GROUP THAT THE CITY COMES FIRST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Several community leaders expressed concern Wednesday that Councilman Bob D . Simpson ' s new job as executive_director of a recently formed hotel and motel association could pose so many conflicts that he would become an ineffectual lawmaker . Allan Hughes , executive_director of the Anaheim Chamber_of_Commerce , said he believes Simpson ' s position with the association &quot; would preclude him from voting on tourism issues . I can ' t imagine that it would n ' t be a conflict. &quot; &quot; This job is going_to take him out of the picture on more_than a_few things , &quot; agreed Shirley Grindle , an activist who has helped win political ethics reforms in the county . &quot; I think he should resign . . . . I don ' t think he could serve both. &quot; William R . Mitchell , chairman of Orange County Common Cause , also said he thought Simpson ' s new job was improper for an active councilman . &quot; It would seem apparent that his new position is based in large part because of his position on the City_Council , &quot; Mitchell said . &quot; In order to alleviate any concerns the public may have , he should abstain_from all votes affecting tourism that come_before the council. &quot; Simpson , who accepted the $ 36 # 000 part-time position last week , said he believes his new position will present few if any conflicts with public business and promised that he would confer_with the city attorney about what issues he can and can ' t vote on . Furthermore , Simpson said he told the 40 members of the Anaheim Area Hotel / Motel Assn . that his first obligation was to the city_council . He said Wednesday he would consider resigning from the group if too many conflicts arose . &quot; I ' m not going_to abdicate my time on the council , &quot; said Simpson , whose term expires in November . City Atty . Jack L . White said in an interview that he saw no legal problem in Simpson ' s taking the job . Conflicts would only occur if a vote directly benefits an association member either financially or materially , White said , or if he votes on an issue on which the association has a stated position . One issue that could eventually pose a conflict is an increase in the hotel bed tax . An increase in the tax is part of the financial framework for the proposed $ 3-billion Disneyland Resort , and many local motels could be expected to oppose such a tax_hike . In addition , the Disneyland Hotel is a member of Simpson ' s association . Kenneth P . Wong , senior_vice_president of Walt Disney Co. ' s development division , said he wasn ' t overly concerned about Simpson ' s new job . &quot; It ' s really for ( the city ) to work_out , &quot; he said . But Stan Pawlowski , co-chairman of Westcot 2000 , a pro-Disneyland Resort group , said he would be troubled if Simpson couldn ' t vote on the resort project . &quot; I ' d certainly hate to lose his vote , &quot; Pawlowski said . &quot; If some reason it came_to a 2-2 vote , we would be in one heck of a shape. &quot; To date , all_the votes on the Disney project have been unanimous . Wong , however , was optimistic . &quot; The good news is that Bob is going_to work for a very important industry in Anaheim , &quot; Wong said . &quot; He has been strong voice for the growth of tourism . I consider him a leading thinker. &quot;</TEXT>
