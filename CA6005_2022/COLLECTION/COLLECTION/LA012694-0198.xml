   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : QUICK-MOVING STORM CAUSES NO DAMAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A quick-moving storm that dropped nearly three-quarters of an inch of rain in parts of Ventura County caused no damage to areas recently ravaged by earthquakes and fires , officials said Tuesday . The rain , which began about 6 p.m. Monday and moved_out about four hours later , never became intense and was quickly absorbed by barren earth scorched by wildfires last fall , said Dolores Taylor , division engineer in the county ' s Flood_Control Department . The hills above Newbury Park and Santa Paula , scenes of the greatest devastation from wildfires in Ventura County , received about half an inch of rain . Mountain areas received up_to 0.69 of an inch . &quot; It was a healthy rain , &quot; Taylor said . &quot; It should water the grass seeds that the Soil_Conservation Corps worked so hard to spread around the fire areas. &quot; In Fillmore , where residents have been struggling to bring order to lives disrupted by the 6.6 magnitude Northridge earthquake , the storm caused little damage . Fire_Chief Patrick Askren said the biggest problem caused by the rain was a brief outage that affected 1 # 000 residents on the east_side of town . A transformer that may have been weakened by the Jan . 17 earthquake blew_out during the storm , he said . The transformer was quickly repaired by Southern California Edison workers , he said . Tuesday ' s blustery , cool weather will give_way to sunny skies and warmer temperatures today , said Dennis Tussey , a technician with the National Weather Service in Oxnard . Highs could reach_into the low 60s . There is a 50 % chance of more showers Thursday morning from another storm system that is moving toward the coast , Tussey said . The extended forecast calls_for clearing skies and warmer temperatures , he said .
