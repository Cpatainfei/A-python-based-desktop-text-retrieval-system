   <HEADLINE> CANADA , SWEDEN TO HAVE REMATCH IN WORLD HOCKEY SEMIFINALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Canada gained a chance to avenge the shootout at Lillehammer , Norway , when it beat the Czech Republic , 3-2 , Thursday to earn a berth against Sweden in the semifinals of the World Hockey Championships . The game will be a rematch of Canada ' s sudden-death loss to the Swedes in the Olympic final two months ago , although the cast of characters on both teams is different.Both are bolstered by NHL players . Canada ' s only holdover is Paul Kariya , the Mighty Ducks ' draft choice who had a goal and an assist against the Czechs . In the Olympic final , Kariya missed in a sudden-death shootout to give Sweden the gold . &quot; I still think_of it sometimes , but now I ' m focusing 100 % to win the world championships , &quot; said Kariya , who is tied for the tournament scoring lead with 10 points . The other semifinal Saturday will pit the United States , upset winners over Russia on Wednesday , against Finland , 10-0 winners over Austria on Thursday . Finland beat the U.S. , 7-2 , in their first meeting .</TEXT>
