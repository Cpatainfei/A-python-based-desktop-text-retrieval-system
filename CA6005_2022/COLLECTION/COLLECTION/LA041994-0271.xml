   <HEADLINE> VALLEY INTERVIEW : HAMPERED BY A LACK OF FACTS ON TROUBLED LANCASTER PRISON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As chairman of the citizens advisory committee for the new state_prison in Lancaster , James T . Lott just wrapped_up a nightmarish year . Before it opened on Feb . 1 , 1993 , Lancaster activists fought hard to keep the $ 207-million prison from being built . Shortly after it opened , Warden Otis Thurman appointed Lott to the 15-member panel . Then , during the prison ' s first 11 months , two minimum-security and two maximum-security inmates escaped . All four were recaptured , but community anger escalated . When Thurman refused to speak publicly about the escapes , many residents directed their questions at Lott , a 57-year-old administrator with the Keppel Union School District in Littlerock . In February , state officials removed Thurman , but Lott remains on the advisory panel , awaiting the arrival of a new warden . Lott was interviewed by Times staff writer Phil Sneiderman . * Question : Did you oppose construction of a new state_prison in Lancaster ? Answer : I had no position at all . I remember reading about it . But I didn ' t have enough information to be either for it or against it . All I knew was that whatever they put_in there , they better try to keep the inmates in and the community safe . Q . What were your first impressions of Warden Thurman ? A . At the first interview , he was very concerned about making_sure that the prison was a safe place to work and that the community was safe . I got the impression that he liked to give his staff a lot of autonomy , to give them the opportunity to do their job and to trust them . I think he delegated an awful lot of responsibility . Q . Did he regret that management style after Eric Rene Johnson , a convicted murderer , escaped last October by climbing over a wall and two fences ? A . I watched him after that escape . There was some worry on his face . I got the impression that he wished he would have handled things a little differently . He was in awe as_to how the escape happened . It bothered him . He made the statement , &quot; I know we can do_better than this . If anything else happens , I ' m really going_to consider being out of here. &quot; I guess part of that escape was something mechanical , about the fence not clamping the guy in or something . But that wasn ' t a good_enough excuse for us . For someone to escape , there ' s a human error . Someone failed . Q . Lancaster got this prison not because the community wanted it but because the state Legislature ordered one built_in north Los Angeles County . How did the warden feel about that ? A . I was under the impression that he felt that he was going_to be the hero . He was going show us that we can have a prison here and that it can be safe . Q . When the warden arrived , he was pretty visible , talking to a lot of community groups about the prison . Why didn ' t that continue ? A . After the escapes , he was so embarrassed and so disappointed that he just knew that people were going_to go_after him and blame him and not give him a chance to fix it because they didn ' t want it here in the first place . It kind of played right into their hands . He had an avoidance role , which worked against him . He could have talked_about what he was going_to do to improve the prison and admitted that there were mistakes made . Instead , I think he got_into a shell . The accessibility wasn ' t there . If a person called to talk to him , someone else would answer . Q . As chairman of the advisory committee , did you have trouble getting_in_touch with the warden ? A . Once or twice I did . I was a little disappointed in his availability , particularly during the time of the escapes . When we would have our meetings there to discuss our concerns , he would have some representatives there . Q . Ideally , what role did you envision for the advisory committee ? A . Our role would be to offer suggestions to the warden , to support the warden and get feedback from the community on concerns about the prison -- and then work them out . Our role was to be the eyes of the community . We were also concerned about how the prison was perceived by the community . When the first maximum-security inmate escaped , the Sheriff ' s Department wasn ' t called_for hours , and the committee_members were not called . The perception was that the prison was trying to hide something . I didn ' t want that perception . At an open meeting I said to the warden : &quot; We better not have anything to hide_out here. &quot; Q . What was his response ? A . It was : &quot; Oh , no , we don ' t have anything to hide here. &quot; Then we had another escape after that . The communication with the Sheriff ' s Department and the committee was better . But it should have been good all_the time . Q . When Johnson escaped , why did_it take so_long for the prison staff to notify sheriff ' s deputies and the advisory committee ? A . Some people in the community believed that if somehow the prison staff could have found this guy and gotten him back in there without letting anyone know , they would have done that . That was the perception out there . They have a process for notifying deputies and the committee , and I ' m sure they were going_to follow it . But I think that whoever was in_charge at that time was so nervous about getting the guy back and making_sure that nothing happened out there , that the notification took longer than it should have . Q . After that escape , did the prison tighten_up its security ? A . We were given a list of 53 recommendations , prepared by state corrections investigators , of things the prison staff should fix . It was a whole array of things , from more security to more workshops for the staff . How could I go_out and say it is going_to be safe when I ' ve got this many things wrong ? Q . What about the second maxi mum-security escape , when Steven Charles Brigada , serving a life sentence for attempted murder , slipped out_in a garbage_truck in January ? A . We were told that there were locks on the trash_bins , when in fact there weren ' t . Now there are . Q . Before that escape , when your committee toured the prison , didn ' t someone ask the prison staff if inmates could get_out in a trash_bin ? A . Yes . The staff said , &quot; No way . The bins have locks on them. &quot; After the escape they said that particular one was left open for dumping and they didn ' t lock it back_up . It seemed to be just one thing after another -- a lack of supervision . Q . What did prison investigators say about the second maximum-security escape ? A . They gave us 16 more things , in addition to the original 53 , that needed to be fixed . It had to do with human error . Q . As chairman of the committee , did the escapes put you in an awkward position ? A . I was in an awkward position for two reasons . If it had to do with prison personnel , there were some things we couldn ' t say . Secondly , we weren ' t given enough information to satisfy the community . We ' d just say a little , and it would sound like we didn ' t know what we were talking_about . Q . Were you surprised when the state removed the warden ? A . No . I was disappointed , though , that the warden was not as sensitive as I wanted him to be to our concerns . I think in his heart he meant well , and I think he trusted his staff to do_well , but the people just didn ' t do_it . Q . Were you surprised to learn that Lancaster ' s escape record was far worse than at most California prisons ? A . Yes . We heard reports at a Corrections Department convention that these escapes were part of growing pains , that this was common . I didn ' t buy_into any of that . Either you ' re accountable or you ' re not accountable . If you make a mistake , admit it and try to correct it . You don ' t talk_about growing pains being an excuse for people escaping . Q . Have you met yet with John Ratelle , the interim warden who took Thurman ' s place ? A . Yes . For one thing , he told me that no more trash trucks are going_into the perimeter of the prison . I told him I wanted to know , as one member of the committee , what happened to the 53 recommendations that were made after the first maximum-security escape . He said he would look_into that . We wanted progress_reports , and we didn ' t get them . And we didn ' t get anything on the 16 recommendations made after Brigada ' s escape . Q . Escapes aside , has the prison provided economic benefits to the community ? A . Yes . I think it has had a great impact on our economy here , especially in the wake of cutbacks in the aerospace industry . Q . How many local residents were hired by the prison ? A . We ' ve asked_for a report about the number of local employees , about how many employees are commuting from elsewhere as opposed to buying houses here , and how many local businesses are involved with the prison . We didn ' t get that report either . The interim warden said he is going_to push for that one , too . Q . Have you accomplished much ? A . I think we let the community down . There was no protest when any of us was appointed to the committee . So when the community saw these names , they thought these were good people , that they would check things out and be fair because they have a track record . Then all these things happened , and they came_to us for information , and we didn ' t know anything . They think that we ' re part of the effort to hide something . One guy said maybe the prison needs to think_about getting a new advisory committee . Q . Would that help ? A . It would n ' t change anything .</TEXT>
