   <HEADLINE> THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT ; EX-U.S. COACH SAYS HE HAS NO REASON TO BE ASHAMED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dave Peterson feels no need to defend either his brusque manner or his gung-ho offensive strategy , although he was vilified for both as the U.S. hockey_coach at Calgary in 1988 and again at Albertville , France , four years later . &quot; I thought we played very well ( in ' 88 ) and I know most people would find that shocking , &quot; Peterson says of a team that finished seventh with future NHL stars Brian Leetch , Craig Janney , Tony Granato , Kevin Stevens and Mike Richter . &quot; You second-guess yourself and say , ' Should our ( pre-Olympic ) schedule have been tougher ? ' And you think , ' Should we have had a_few older players ? ' But with the rules and format in_effect then , those were the players available . I have no apologies over who we picked and how we performed . &quot; People say , ' If you had all that talent , how come you didn ' t win ? ' I turn_around and say , ' Maybe we did a pretty good job preparing them for the NHL. ' I thought I did a pretty good job coaching . &quot; In 1992 , I thought we came_up a little emotionally dry in the bronze-medal game . By and large , I thought the players played well and we got the maximum out of them . Obviously , we had a great goalkeeper in Ray LeBlanc. &quot; He says he ignored the criticism heaped upon him , even when officials of the International Olympic Committee mocked the team ' s defensive disarray . &quot; If you ' re going to be in the coaching profession , you ' ve got_to live with it , &quot; adds Peterson , whose work as technical director of USA Hockey , the sport ' s governing body , includes compiling instructional material for players and coaches . &quot; You always feel there are little things you ' d do differently . The tournament is such_that if you played it every week , you ' d have a different winner . There are so many factors : How a player plays that day , how a team plays , how well you are physically , how well you adjust , especially if the Games are in another country. &quot; Peterson , 63 , will watch these Games on TV at_home in Colorado Springs . &quot; I think all coaches miss coaching , especially about now when the team is getting ready for a big competition , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s a great adventure . You say to yourself , ' It would be great to be doing this again , ' but knowing the hard work , you ' re glad you ' re not doing it. &quot; MORE BAD MEMORIES Ten years after he coached the United States to seventh place at Sarajevo , Yugoslavia , Lou Vairo has more excuses than Olympic victories . No one , he says , knew center Pat LaFontaine was ill and couldn ' t take medication because it was banned , or that defenseman Chris Chelios broke his foot in the first game . Or that David A . Jensen had a knee injury . No one made allowances for Al Iafrate and Ed Olczyk being 17 , or for the effects of David Hirsch hitting the crossbar with the U.S. team trailing Canada , 3-2 , in the opener , a game that killed American medal hopes . &quot; The thing that made me feel saddest is the world didn ' t see them at their best , &quot; says Vairo , director of special projects for USA Hockey . &quot; We were 2-2-2 and we lost to two great teams , Canada and Czechoslovakia . That same year , Czechoslovakia beat Canada at the World Championships. &quot; Vairo believes that he and Peterson have been maligned . &quot; I ' ve yet to hear anybody say we did a great job of player development . Leetch , Janney , Stevens . . . Nobody said Dave Peterson or Lou Vairo did a great job in player development . No , we didn ' t win a medal , but we did some things well . We didn ' t ruin them , anyway. &quot; SITTING PAT LaFontaine still rues his team ' s showing in ' 84 . And it probably should have been better , because he and many of his teammates had successful NHL careers . He played with Olczyk , center Corey Millen , Chelios -- a two-time Norris Trophy winner -- and Iafrate , a four-time all-star . &quot; We had a really talented team , but every place we went ( on an exhibition tour ) , they had a reception for us and that might have distracted us , &quot; said LaFontaine , the Buffalo Sabres ' top center . &quot; We ended_up playing 65 games . I look_back and say we played some of our best hockey before the Olympics. &quot; Last season , LaFontaine set a record for American-born players when he had 148 points and was runner-up to NHL scoring champion Mario Lemieux . He underwent knee surgery in November , but is progressing rapidly and might return in May . HE ' S AN OLYMPIC FLAME Dave King ' s mind will be with the Calgary Flames , but his heart will be with the Canadian Olympic team . King , the Flames ' coach , led Canada to fourth-place finishes in 1984 and ' 88 and to a silver medal in ' 92 . As these Games approach , he pines for the drama of international competition . &quot; I ' m glad to be doing what I ' m doing , but the Olympic hockey tournament to me is the highlight for any coach or athlete , &quot; said King , who had Eric Lindros , Joe Juneau and Sean Burke on his squad at Albertville . &quot; I made so many friends there and at the World Championships . You miss seeing those people. &quot; King sees no clear favorite in the competition , which will begin Saturday . &quot; The U.S. and Canadian teams are really good , and I think they can go a far ways , &quot; he says . &quot; I don ' t think the Russians are as strong as in the past , and since the split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia , their depth is thinned . . . . It ' s going_to be awesome. &quot; VIKTOR , VICTORIOUS Mighty Duck defenseman Alexei Kasatonov , who played for the Soviet_Union in 1980 , ' 84 and ' 88 , knows little about the Olympic field , &quot; Just what I see in the newspaper , &quot; he says . &quot; Five , maybe six teams have a chance to win. &quot; He does know Viktor Tikhonov will coach Russia , and that ' s enough for him to predict a strong performance , despite a total roster turnover since the Unified Team ' s ' 92 gold medal . &quot; He prepares the team very well , I believe , from my experience with him , &quot; adds Kasatonov , who got one silver and two gold medals under Tikhonov . &quot; He won three Olympics . No question , he is a great coach and a good teacher . Tikhonov will show he can work not just with the best players , but with any player. &quot; EYES ON LILLEHAMMER Mighty Duck wing Joe Sacco ( U.S. ' 92 ) has a strong interest in the American team : His brother , David , is a center . &quot; It ' s only going_to help him , &quot; Sacco says . &quot; For me , it was a great experience. &quot; Other local Olympians : the Ducks ' Sean Hill , Tim Sweeney ( U.S. ' 92 ) , Patrik Carnback ( Sweden ' 92 ) , Anatoli Semenov ( Soviet_Union ' 88 ) ; the Kings ' Granato ( U.S. ' 88 ) , Tomas Sandstrom ( Sweden ' 84 ) , Alex Zhitnik ( Unified Team ' 92 ) , Shawn McEachern ( U.S. ' 92 ) , Robert Lang ( Czechoslovakia ' 92 ) , Tim Watters ( Canada ' 80 and ' 88 ) , Jari Kurri ( Finland ' 80 ) . &quot; I don ' t think I would have been able to make the jump to the NHL without playing in the Olympics , &quot; Granato says .</TEXT>
