   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; COMMERCIAL APPEAL ; PUBLIC-ACCESS TV WAS BORN AS A MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS . BUT 25 YEARS LATER , IT ' S MORE MARKETING THAN PHILOSOPHY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On one channel , two women bare their tattoos for a captivated talk-show host . On another , an out-of-work twentysomething moons a South Bay mayor . Flip on down the dial , and a chiropractor peddles a sure-fire cure for whiplash . A trash-TV nightmare ? Nope . Such fare is probably available on your tube right now . And it ' s not coming from Geraldo Rivera and Montel Williams , but from your next-door neighbors . The shoulder of the &quot; information superhighway , &quot; it turns_out , is dotted with the billboards and Burma Shave signs of public-access cable TV . Billed 25 years ago as an &quot; electronic soapbox &quot; that would put mass media in the hands of the masses and invigorate democracy , public access has become something not quite as heady : A latter-day Schwab ' s drugstore for aspiring talk-show hosts , &quot; Wayne ' s World &quot; wanna-bes and hawking hairdressers . In recent years , the strictly non-commercial world of public-access TV has proven susceptible to creeping commercialism , especially in entertainment-savvy Southern California . And while the medium has long been ridiculed for its self-indulgent content and amateur productions , community programming is getting a bit more sophisticated . There is Terry Anfuso , a fitness instructor from Rolling Hills Estates who hopes to join the growing ranks of talk-show hosts such_as Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue . Her half-hour show , &quot; Terry ' s Topics , &quot; has aired for four years on various public-access channels in the South Bay and Westside while Anfuso has tried to cross over to network TV or syndication . &quot; They say people want to watch the sensational things , &quot; said Anfuso , whose show has tackled such issues as belly-dancing , female boxing and celebrity look-alikes . &quot; I would like to make_it big ; to do the show big-time. &quot; In true Oprah style , Anfuso recently booked two young_women with tattoos and body piercings . During a Tuesday night taping at a studio in Rolling Hills Estates , she gingerly queried the women as they revealed tattoos of animals and flowers on their backs and legs . &quot; Did getting your nipple pierced hurt ? &quot; Anfuso asks . ( Yes. ) &quot; Will a suntan fade the tattoos ? &quot; ( Yes , again. ) Meanwhile , Anfuso ' s director , Edd Linskey , gave instructions to three amateur cameramen from a small control_room . &quot; Focus , ( camera ) three , focus , &quot; he says into the microphone . &quot; No , no . . . don ' t cut_off her head . Higher. &quot; Linskey , who has done production work_on Hollywood TV_shows and now works full time at Dimension Cable in Rolling Hills Estates , acknowledges that some hope public access will be a springboard to something better . &quot; Terry ' s trying to find her niche , &quot; he said during a break_in taping . &quot; She definitely would like to go national . that ' s been her dream for a long time. &quot; Others are even bolder about using public access as a public-relations tool . Entrepreneurs have used the medium to run barely disguised infomercials for chiropractic , hairstyling and dentistry services . * The Los Angeles County Chiropractic Society , a trade association , uses public-access facilities throughout the metropolitan area to produce the series &quot; Chiropractic Today and Beyond , &quot; featuring member doctors . At the end of each show , viewers are advised to call an 800-number to get more information . Callers are then referred to a practitioner in their area . For such users , the chief advantage to public access is that it costs nothing . In most cases , even the training and materials are free . The tab is picked_up by cable companies , who collect their revenue from -- you guessed it -- their customers . Public-access channels are governed by franchise agreements between cable companies and each city or town . Most communities require users and producers to get training , but otherwise they take a hands-off approach to production and distribution of videotapes . The lack of oversight has made_it easier for users to edge closer to commercialization . In most communities , as long as a program is not explicitly obscene or commercial , public-access administrators must air it unedited . Censoring a program , administrators say , would violate cable franchise agreements and the 1st Amendment , though some programmers admit they practice a form of censorship by putting undesirable shows on very late at night . Public-access promotion is &quot; really a gray area , &quot; said Patty King , production supervisor at MultiVision Cable , which serves Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach . &quot; Some people are not aware of the freedom on public access . Others are , and they ' ll take_advantage of it . . .. If you ' re slick about it , you can get_away with it. &quot; Of course , not everyone who uses public access has a product to plug or a career to advance . Skip E . Lowe is a retired stand-up comic who uses a Beverly Hills facility to produce a talk_show with aging stars such_as Shelley Winters , Stella Stevens and Virginia O ' Brien . He has been doing the show for 14 years with no compensation other_than his own self-fulfillment . &quot; Why do I do_it ? I like to keep myself busy , &quot; Lowe said . &quot; I ' m enjoying what I ' m doing , even though I ' m not getting paid_for it. &quot; Lowe said he spends 30 to 40 hours a week working_on his show , mostly lining_up guests and sending tapes to various public-access channels in Southern California , New York and elsewhere . He often arranges guest appearances by going_to Hollywood parties and chatting_up celebrities who have seen his show . &quot; I ' m basically a one-man operation , &quot; Lowe said . &quot; I ' ve had many people try to syndicate , but they want me to sign everything over to them , and I can ' t do that . I work too hard on this for that. &quot; Other , less-devoted amateurs simply appreciate the chance to blow_off steam on camera . While experts say off-the-cuff programming rarely makes_for good TV , it does match the original intention of public access . Jeff Cole , director of the UCLA Center for Communication Policy , recalls an area public-access show on which the host expressed disappointment that few people read books anymore . &quot; So he used to sit in the studio and read a book . But not out loud , &quot; Cole said . &quot; To me , that ' s most of public access -- cheap , easy , sort of odd , &quot; he said . Public access &quot; gives each and every citizen the opportunity to express ideas through mass communications , &quot; said Michael Smith , Torrance cable-television administrator . &quot; It ' s free speech . We ' re operating the facility content-neutral. &quot; Yet that approach is precisely what enables some users to bend the system for personal gain . Because programmers have severely limited power to censor , creative producers can beam a pitch to a large TV_audience . This , however , is not how cable companies pitched public access in the late 1960s and early 1970s . Early operators were eager to negotiate franchise agreements with sometimes reluctant cities and towns . So to sweeten the pot , the companies agreed to devote one or more channels to public , educational or government ( PEG ) access , with no cost to the user . Communities often use government-access channels to air city_council meetings and local promotional pieces . In Hawthorne , for example , Mayor Larry Guidi hosts a government-access show , &quot; A Taste of Hawthorne , &quot; featuring local restaurants . Some communities separate government and public access on different channels , some don ' t . &quot; The idea was that cable companies would compensate the city for the use of the taxpayers ' ( electronic ) right_of_way , &quot; said Susan Herman , general_manager of the Los Angeles Department of Telecommunication . &quot; The companies would provide public-benefit services , like free ( hook-ups ) for schools , hospitals and so on . They would also provide access for governments and the public. &quot; Unlike network broadcasters , public-access channels are governed not by the media companies or the Federal Communications Commission but by franchise agreements with each town . The resulting lack of broad oversight has made_it easier for ingenious users to edge closer to commercialization . Cole , the UCLA professor , reports that the selling of public access happens more often in the Los Angeles area , mainly because it is the home of major entertainment companies . Users will produce a tape in a facility near their homes -- the Torrance studio , for example -- and then &quot; bicycle &quot; or export the tape to towns where it stands a chance of being seen by a channel-surfing media executive . This is the type of opportunity that Torrance resident and UCLA graduate Brian Ormsby relishes . Ormsby , 24 , and his housemate , Brad Dodge , 25 , are the hosts of &quot; Too_Much Free_Time , &quot; an hourlong talk and variety_show bicycled all_over the South Bay , Westside and San Fernando Valley . They estimate their potential audience is 670 # 000 households . Ormsby said that &quot; Too_Much Free_Time &quot; trades on the trend toward &quot; real-life TV &quot; pioneered by such shows as MTV ' s &quot; Real_World &quot; and popularized by the fictional &quot; Wayne ' s World. &quot; Political correctness is evidently shelved during taping . One show featured a chat with lesbian strippers . Another featured Ormsby saluting outgoing Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert by dropping his trousers and baring his backside for the camera . But it ' s not just a post-college prank . Ormsby said he would like to take the program national and is looking_for sponsors -- a ploy which , if effective , would bar the program ' s distribution on public access . &quot; We ' re hoping to make_it big and make a lot of money , &quot; said Ormsby , who says he lost his job at a car-rental company last year after a manager saw the show , found it offensive and told him to stop doing_it . He refused and now is unemployed . Dodge is a waiter . &quot; We ' re trying to syndicate the program ourselves , &quot; Ormsby said . Yet many question whether public access is seen by enough people to be an effective crossover tool . Even the free-advertising benefit is overrated , some say , because viewers skip_over public-access stations . &quot; Nobody watches public access , because a lot of the programs are not well done and are rather boring , &quot; said Torrance resident Steven Morris , who produced an eight-part lecture series promoting atheism . Some programmers disagree , however , arguing that public access will become even more important as cable companies offer hundreds of channels and desperately seek all kinds of programming , whether they are amateur , professional or somewhere in between . Herman , Los Angeles ' chief spokeswoman on cable issues , points_out that the 14 franchise areas served by her department cover most of the county and reach 520 # 000 households . The public-access facilities churn_out an average of 720 original half-hour shows every month , Herman said . The question isn ' t whether public access is being used , but how . Even its staunchest supporters admit that the direction the medium has taken_over the years isn ' t exactly what its inventors had_in_mind . &quot; Public access , &quot; said UCLA ' s Cole , &quot; is an extraordinary resource that hasn ' t been used very effectively . That doesn ' t argue against it . It ' s there to be used , stupidly or effectively. &quot; On the Cover Torrance resident Brad Dodge , 25 , left , and his housemate , Brian Ormsby , 24 , are the hosts of &quot; Too_Much Free_Time , &quot; an hourlong talk and variety_show that is filmed free at the Torrance public-access channel and exported throughout the South Bay , the Westside and the San Fernando Valley . The duo , like many others with shows on public access , hope to make_it to commercial television some day .
