   <HEADLINE> CHRISTOPHER TRIP TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher was humiliated at Beijing and he deserves it ( &quot; U.S. , China Trade Embittered Words on Human_Rights , &quot; March 13 ) . This is exactly the result of the mixed signals the United States has been sending to China . Despite China greeting Christopher ' s visit with arresting dissidents , the State_Department withdrew its objections of the past six months to the launching of an Australian communications satellite , made in the U.S. by Hughes Aircraft , on a Chinese rocket . And the Defense_Department announced earlier this month that it is interested in having closer ties to the Chinese People ' s Liberation Army , the same army that killed the pro-democracy students at Tian An Men Square on June 4 , 1989 . No wonder China has the impression that the United States had already decided to renew preferential trade privileges , the most-favored-nation trading status . President Clinton ' s credibility is_on the line . China has called the U.S. a paper tiger . The Clinton_Administration has to demonstrate that the paper tiger can bite . CHIA YU-TAI Silicon_Valley for Democracy in China San Jose * I ' m with China on this one . The U.S. will lose this argument . The U.S. has been dealing with China since the early 19th Century and in all this time and with all its experts , it still does not understand the Chinese . The party_bosses do not run China , the People ' s Liberation Army runs China . The PLA does not like city workers , students and intellectuals . The bulk of the so-called dissidents come from this so-called privileged class . The U.S. in the present and in the past has allied itself with the worst kind of repressive governments , so how can the U.S. pretend to be highly moral when it comes_to human_rights ? For example , our Congress and our President just passed the NAFTA agreement with one of the most undemocratic countries ( Mexico ) in the Americas . We are no paragon of virtue . We don ' t protect our own citizens from crime , from the ravages of management against workers and the environment that our people need to live with . We should stop being godlike and moral throughout the world . It is hypocritical . HOWARD A . SAMUELS Northridge * Regarding Christopher ' s trip to lecture the Chinese : The Chinese see maodun ( contradictions ) . Christopher criticizes Tian An Men Square . The Chinese see our Kent State . In both incidents the ruling government sought to preserve itself by intimidation . Christopher criticized the Chinese treatment of dissidents . The Chinese remember that Martin_Luther_King Jr . was repeatedly jailed and that the FBI sought to destroy him . JOHN FLEISCHER Burbank * I note where a group of 200 American businessmen publicly opposed our government ' s position regarding China ' s egregious civil_rights violations . I would be interested in knowing which 200 companies these were . American businesses expressing a public display of opposition to our government ' s legitimate demands for civil_rights progress , while on foreign soil , is appallingly callous . LELAND THOBURN Tujunga * China ' s most prominent political_dissident , Fang Lizhi , argues that the U.S._government should revoke China ' s most-favored-nation trading status ( Commentary , March 16 ) . It makes me sick every time I hear these political_dissidents trying to drive a wedge between the U.S. and China without regard for the two peoples and their economic welfare . They would enjoy it if the U.S. and China get_at each other ' s throats instead of working_out their differences and getting ready for a prosperous Pacific century . STEVE LAU Huntington Beach</TEXT>
