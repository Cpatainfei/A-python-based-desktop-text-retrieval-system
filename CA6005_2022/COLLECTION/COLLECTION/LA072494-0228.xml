   <HEADLINE> TIME RUNS_OUT FOR BANK SEIZED AFTER LOSING $ 200 # 000 A MONTH ; SAN PEDRO : REAL_ESTATE SLUMP AND BAD LOANS ARE BLAMED FOR THE FAILURE OF THE HARBOR AREA ' S SOLE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With regulators knocking at their door , Bank of San Pedro executives tried time and again to stay afloat . They sold real_estate assets , raised money in a stock offering , even collected a settlement from a sunken ship . It was all too late . State banking officials seized the financial_institution this month , shutting the doors on San Pedro ' s only independent financial_institution . The bank had been losing $ 200 # 000 a month , and its operations lost more_than $ 4 million since 1992 , state officials said . Home Bank of Signal Hill acquired $ 22.1 million of the Bank of San Pedro ' s $ 123.4 million in assets , including two of the failed institution ' s branches in San Pedro . The sites reopened Monday under their new name . Home Bank also plans to keep about 40 of the Bank of San Pedro ' s 80 employees . The failed bank ' s other sites -- including its headquarters in San Pedro and branches in Long_Beach and Gardena -- were closed by state officials and placed into the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . Also closed was a site in Avalon , leaving Catalina Island with only one bank , a branch of Southern California Bank . Bank of San Pedro President Lance Oak and board Chairman Peter Mandia , along with other top_executives , gave_up the bank ' s management after it was seized . &quot; They just ran_out of time , &quot; said Gerry Findley , publisher of the Findley Reports newsletter , which reports banking statistics . &quot; Management of the past couple of years has been doing a good job of trying to raise capital. &quot; Regulators blamed the bank ' s failure on real_estate investments that turned sour during the recession and a high number of bad loans . Overall , the losses reduced the bank ' s capital to $ 1.2 million . In addition , the bank ' s portfolio of non-performing loans was 5.9 % at the end of last year . State and federal regulators -- who date the bank ' s problems to 1987 -- recommend only 1 % to 2 % in bad loans . &quot; They got hit with what many independent banks have gone_through , &quot; said Barry Rubens , president of California Research Corp. , a bank consulting_firm in Santa Monica . &quot; They just couldn ' t get_over the problems . Usually , in seven years you can. &quot; Some former board_members blame the bank ' s demise on the new direction the institution took_in the 1980s , when it added new branches and started a subsidiary to invest in real_estate projects . Among the investments : an 80 % stake in the $ 25 million Redondo Shores shopping_center , which has lost money and cut_into the bank ' s profits . &quot; That was really the iceberg that brought it down , &quot; said Jim Hussey , a Bank of San Pedro founder , who left its board 12 years ago . When Hussey and four others founded the bank in 1975 at the site of a former take-out chicken restaurant , their goal was to give the harbor community ' s residents and businesses a financial_institution of_their_own , rather than depend_on big chain banks based in downtown Los Angeles . There was a major shake-up in the bank ' s executive ranks in 1981 , when two San Pedro developers -- Steven G . Podesta and Bill A . Moller -- acquired a controlling interest in the bank ' s stock . The founding directors quit and some were dismayed at the decision to move the headquarters to a 5th Street building owned by Moller and Podesta . Nevertheless , the bank ' s new directors oversaw a rapid expansion , including the start-up of the Gardena , Torrance and Avalon branches , and investments in real_estate projects near the Port of Los Angeles . The bank ' s assets jumped from $ 32 million when they joined the board to $ 180 million by the end of the decade . But in 1989 , state banking regulators began to scrutinize some of the loans the bank issued to its own directors , including nearly $ 2 million in loans to Moller and slightly more_than $ 1 million to Podesta . Bank officials defended the loans and contended the scrutiny stemmed from the special attention that federal regulators began to give to so-called insider loans following the savings and loan scandal . The bank directors , however , agreed in 1990 to adopt tighter restrictions on loans to themselves and other bank officers . Moller and Podesta , who left the bank ' s board in 1990 , could not be reached for comment . The two partners also were once co-owners of the cruise_ship Princess Louise , a popular floating restaurant in the Los Angeles Harbor that sunk_in 1989 . They had sold the vessel by that time , but the subsequent owner went bankrupt and it was repossessed by the Bank of San Pedro . It was not until last summer that the bank collected a $ 2 million insurance settlement on the ship . The money gave the bank a momentary reprieve from state banking regulators , who already had imposed deadlines for raising capital . * The bank could not sustain its revenue stream . Moreover , bank officials were unable to close a deal on the Redondo Shores shopping_center , which continued to eat_away at profits . &quot; They talked_about selling it for a number of years , &quot; said Stan Cardenas , chief deputy superintendent at the state Banking Department . &quot; We heard about it , but it never happened. &quot; Last year , the bank also tried to sell stock to investors , but raised only $ 3 million , far short of the $ 4 million to $ 5 million it needed to meet state banking guidelines . The failure has left the FDIC with some of the bank ' s assets , including stakes in Redondo Shores and the Catalina Canyon Hotel on Catalina Island . The FDIC also will set_up a plan for payment of claims to 210 customers who have uninsured deposits exceeding $ 100 # 000 . Shareholders in the company are expected to lose their investment . Home Bank , which bought $ 82.2 million of the bank ' s insured deposits , will continue to operate the former bank ' s sites as consumer-oriented banks , said Home Bank Chief_Executive James Staes . &quot; When there is a downturn , every financial_institution has to bite the bullet , &quot; Staes said .</TEXT>
