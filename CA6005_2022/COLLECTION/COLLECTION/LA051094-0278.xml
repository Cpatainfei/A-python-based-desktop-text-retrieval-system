   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; FASTEN YOUR SEAT_BELT : GREECE GIVES EU A BUMPY RIDE ; MANY EUROPEANS VIEW PAPANDREOU AS A TROUBLEMAKER , CITING THE BLOCKADE OF MACEDONIA AND FEUDS WITH ALBANIA AND TURKEY . OTHERS SAY BIAS AGAINST A SMALL , POOR NATION IS AT_WORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Greece , the current president of the European Union , is being sued by the other 11 members . What ' s going_on in this normally cozy club ? The manager has been breaking team rules , and the players are furious . They are aghast at the Greek economic blockade of its landlocked neighbor , recognized by the United Nations and the United States as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia but proclaimed by the 2 million people of the little country as simply Macedonia . that ' s the word that is inflaming Greek passions , touching deep nationalistic chords . Greece insists it holds the copyright on the name Macedonia and all related symbols and history . This is the biggest -- but just one -- of the problems Athens is having with its EU partners . The Greeks , for instance , are also noisily feuding with Albania , another Balkan neighbor . They are friendlier with land-hungry Serbia than their European allies would like , and the Greeks scarcely draw breath in their longstanding campaign of insult against Turkey , its next-door neighbor and partner in NATO . Not much of a manager , and not much of a partner either , other members of the European rich_man ' s club are saying . In many European capitals , Greek Prime_Minister Andreas Papandreou , EU president for the first_half of this year , is often considered more troublemaker than leader . Other EU members have made_it clear that they consider Greek Angst over the newly independent country that calls itself Macedonia to be gratuitous and destabilizing in the Balkan caldron . The Papandreou government ' s truculence at being hauled by its peers before the EU ' s Court of Justice in Luxembourg is symptomatic_of Greece ' s troubles in meshing with the rest of Europe . By nearly every statistical measure -- personal_income to national inflation to government deficit -- Greece is the worst off of Europe ' s dozen . Like its alphabet , Greece is different from the rest of Europe . The EU ' s legal_action against its partner -- essentially accusing Greece of a major breach of the union ' s founding treaty -- is unprecedented . After two months of stern warnings and a brief , futile attempt at mediation , the EU ' s executive commission decided last month that legal_action was the only way to end the Greek blockade of the former Yugoslav republic on its northern border . EU treaties forbid any member country from closing its borders unless there is a threat of war -- a set of circumstances the EU claims doesn ' t exist in this case . But Athens disagrees . &quot; The Greeks are saying there ' s a threat of war because they ' re the ones doing the threatening , &quot; explained a commission official familiar_with the case . In late April , the case landed at the Court of Justice , where jurists are considering whether to issue a preliminary injunction that would require Greece to lift the blockade , at least temporarily . Imposed without warning in February , the blockade is squeezing hard on the economy of the little republic . The lawsuit is scant solace to the Macedonians : A final ruling on the EU ' s case could take years . Publicly and privately , the Europeans are sulfurous at what they see as Greek disdain for international_law . British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd complained of blockade measures that &quot; in our view are illegal and certainly harm the reputation and the authority of Greece. &quot; German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel denounced the blockade as &quot; counter to the normal behavior expected between civilized European nations. &quot; A Dutch official was even more pungent : &quot; Actions like that make you wonder if they really belong here ( in the EU ) . &quot; But not all opinions are so harsh about Greece , which holds the rotating presidency through the end of June . &quot; Greece may be a burr in Europe ' s saddle , but it is an important member of democratic Europe , &quot; commented one senior Western diplomat . &quot; In fact , it is more European than it was even a_few years ago , closer to the rest in dress , consumer goods and habits . At the same time , though , it is Byzantine -- and Greek. &quot; Membership in the union , which came_in 1981 in the Socialist Papandreou ' s first government , has turned_out to be a boon for Greece : It brings billions in aid ; it is reinforcement for Greece ' s democratic institutions , and it confers major-league status on a nation of 10 million people . Despite a rising tide of Balkan nationalism that has accompanied the Macedonian crisis , the Greeks , like their government , seem content with their place in Europe . &quot; We are in Europe to stay . We believe_in Europe , &quot; says Telemachus Hytiris , the prime_minister ' s spokesman . Events have persuaded a fair number of influential Europeans , though , that Greece is out of step and that it has scant prospects of picking_up the pace . Is it a fair judgment ? Speaking_to reporters early this year , Theodoros Pangalos , Greek minister for European affairs , lamented what he described as a European bias against Greece . &quot; First there is a slightly racist view of those who are too Southern or too Eastern , who are viewed_as different . Second , it is our economic status , which we must take_care to address , especially the huge public_debt and the budget_deficit . Third is the Skopje ( Macedonia ) issue . . . . &quot; * Macedonia , as a pregnant case_in_point , has forced an issue on Europe that matters only to the Greeks . They argue that the new republic ' s name , emblems , national systems and constitution signal expansionist designs against the northern Greek province of Macedonia . Greece calls the new republic simply Skopje , after its capital city , or even Fyrom ( Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , its U.N. name ) . In Washington last month , President Clinton urged a visiting Papandreou to lift the embargo . Papandreou listed conditions : the Macedonian flag being stripped of its sun symbol , which Greeks hold as a national icon identified with Alexander the Great , and some articles being stricken from the Macedonian constitution . Macedonia says everything can be negotiated , but only after the blockade is lifted . Meanwhile , the drama plays_on . Says Greek nationalist Lakis Lazopoulos , a well-known entertainer : &quot; Are we poor and small ? Yes , we are . But I know what I am and who I am , and I didn ' t say I was somebody else . . . . Europeans don ' t like us because we are the people who say no . We have a different character. &quot; * Montalbano reported from Athens and Marshall from Brussels .</TEXT>
