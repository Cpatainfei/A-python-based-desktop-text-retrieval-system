   <HEADLINE> EARLY BREAST-FEEDING CUTS CANCER RISK , STUDY FINDS ; RESEARCH : THE LONGER THAT NURSING CONTINUES , THE BETTER THE CHANCES THAT PRE-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN CAN AVOID BREAST MALIGNANCY , RESEARCH SHOWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The longer that mothers breast-feed , and the younger they begin , the more they lower their risk of getting breast_cancer before menopause , a large study has found . It found that a woman who begins breast-feeding in her teens and continues for at least six months cuts the cancer risk almost in half . The study found no evidence that nursing prevents the disease from occurring after menopause . Breast_cancer before menopause is relatively rare . Except for those who began nursing in their teens , the reduction in risk was generally small , about 22 % . The finding is still noteworthy because breast-feeding represents one of the few voluntary things that women might do to change their odds of this cancer . Experts in the past have wondered about the possible effects of breast-feeding , but the data has been murky . Some earlier studies linked nursing with reduced cancer risk , while others found no correlation . The latest study was directed by Dr. Polly A . Newcomb of the University of Wisconsin and published in Thursday ' s New England Journal of Medicine . &quot; There are a number of reasons to breast-feed , &quot; Newcomb said . &quot; First and foremost is to provide the child with complete nutrition and psychological benefits . But a woman might also consider the possibility that this could reduce her risk of breast cancer. &quot; Her study was based on a review of 5 # 878 breast_cancer patients in Wisconsin , Massachusetts , Maine and New Hampshire . Their nursing habits were compared to those of 8 # 216 women who did not have breast_cancer . The study found that a woman who begins breast-feeding before age 20 and continues for at least six months cuts her risk of breast_cancer before menopause by 46 % . The researchers estimate that if all women with_children breast-fed for at least two years , the incidence of breast_cancer before menopause would fall by nearly 25 % . Breast_cancer is second only to lung_cancer as a cause of death among women .</TEXT>
