   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / GRAHAME L . JONES ; FRANCE WORKS IN ANTICIPATION OF NEW 32-TEAM CUP FIELD IN ' 98</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> France is ready , willing and apparently eager to stage a 32-team World Cup tournament in 1998 . A decision on whether to expand the event from its 24-team format could be made as early as this week , but the France ' 98 organizing committee already is acting as if it ' s fait_accompli . &quot; We are now working_on the basis of 32 teams , &quot; said Fernand Sastre , who , with former French star and national coach Michel Platini , is co-president of the organizing committee . &quot; We will have to organize 64 matches over a period of 32 or 33 days. &quot; Speaking at a news_conference in Saint Denis , near Paris , where an 80 # 000-seat stadium will be built for the tournament , Sastre said a dozen French cities are seeking to be World Cup ' 98 venues and added that eight to 10 will be chosen . Saint Denis will be the site of the opening game and eight others , including one semifinal and the final . Platini said the draw for the qualifying rounds will occur in December of 1995 at the Louvre in Paris . The draw for the finals will be held_in Marseille in 1997 . * If FIFA , world soccer ' s governing body , does increase the World Cup field to 32 , as expected , Japan and South_Korea will be hoping to possibly split the 2002 tournament . Both countries are bidding strongly for the event and the possibility of sharing it was suggested as a compromise . That idea has been shot_down by FIFA , however . &quot; Who would qualify as hosts ? Who would be responsible_for security ? The questions seem endless , &quot; said Joseph ( Sepp ) Blatter , FIFA ' s general secretary . FIFA President Joao Havelange has long wanted to stage the 2002 tournament in Asia , but said recently that Australia and Colombia also are interested in_playing host to the finals . Japan has the edge at the moment , but South_Korea ' s campaign is gaining attention . Colombia , which was supposed to stage the 1986 World Cup but had to bow_out and turn the tournament over to Mexico , could not possibly handle a 32-team event , and Australia ' s bid is nothing more_than a publicity ploy . * It took Argentine striker Claudio Caniggia less than a game to get embroiled in controversy again after a 13-month suspension for cocaine use . Playing for his club , AS Roma of Italy , against River Plate of Argentina in Buenos Aires last week , Caniggia scored the Italian club ' s second goal in a 3-1 victory . But the River Plate players protested furiously , albeit unsuccessfully , that Caniggia had used his hand , not his head , in scoring . If so , Caniggia apparently learned nothing during his enforced absence . He sat_out the 1990 World Cup_final in Italy after a blatant handball in Argentina ' s semifinal victory over Italy in Naples . He and teammate Diego Maradona , also well known for his handballs , will have to be watched closely by the referees in next month ' s World Cup . * The European Cup next season will feature many of the sport ' s most famous clubs . Those that already have qualified by winning their respective national championships include Manchester United of England , Glasgow Rangers of Scotland , AEK Athens of Greece , Ajax Amsterdam of the_Netherlands , Anderlecht of Belgium , AC Milan of Italy and Bayern Munich of Germany . The Rangers won their sixth consecutive title , but the Scottish club still is looking_for its first European trophy . Among the newcomers in the European Cup will be France ' s champion , Paris St . Germain , which won its first French title since 1986 . The Spanish championship came_down to the last_day of the season Sunday , with Barcelona winning its fourth consecutive title . Deportivo La Coruna , which had needed to win its final game to clinch its first title , was held to a scoreless tie . * The election of Nelson Mandela as South_Africa ' s president could have an impact on the nation ' s sporting image , too . Rugby has always been South_Africa ' s most popular sport , or at least the one at which it has been most successful . Now , soccer could take_over . One of Mandela ' s first acts_on his inauguration_day last week was to attend a soccer game with his Zambian counterpart , Frederick Chiluba . They were among 50 # 000 in Johannesburg who watched South_Africa upset Zambia , 2-1 . South_Africa already has been chosen as host country for the African_Nations Cup in 1997 and has been proposed as a possible World Cup host for 2006 . * The last of Europe ' s three cup tournaments ends tonight when AC Milan of Italy plays Barcelona of Spain in what could prove to be a classic European Cup_Final in Athens . AC Milan , a former winner , lost last season ' s final to Olympique Marseille of France , and Barcelona won the trophy in 1992 . Internazionale of Milan , meanwhile , won the UEFA Cup by scoring two 1-0 victories over Salzburg of Austria . The European Cup Winners ' Cup was won by Arsenal of England , which defeated defending champion Parma of Italy , 1-0 , in Copenhagen , Denmark . Arsenal became only the seventh English club to win the trophy . * The Netherlands , Germany and Italy each announced World Cup rosters without much ado . But in Brazil , it was a different story . Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira was being second-guessed even before the ink was dry on the paper . The main problem , it seemed to the Brazilian media , lay_in midfield . Gerson , a member of Brazil ' s 1970 World Cup-winning team and now a television analyst , had this to say : &quot; ( Parreira ) has picked a midfield where the emphasis is too_much on players who mark ( defend ) and not enough on players who create . It ' s a good squad and I ' m optimistic , but it could have been a lot better. &quot; Nor was Gerson too optimistic about the tournament as_a_whole . &quot; In terms of playing standards , I think this will be the worst World Cup in the last 20 years , &quot; he said . A harsh judgment , especially when voiced before the first ball has been kicked . Will Gerson say the same thing later on if Brazil actually wins the World Cup ? Soccer Notes Germany ' s 1990 World Cup-winning coach , Franz Beckenbauer , will serve as a German television commentator during this summer ' s tournament , but former England national team coach Graham Taylor has declined an invitation to attend the World Cup as a radio commentator for the BBC . . . . Dutch international Ruud Gullit has returned to his old club , AC Milan , on a one-year , $ 880 # 000 contract . Gullit , Europe ' s player of the year in 1987 , helped Sampdoria win the Italian Cup this season . Luis Fernandez , the former French international midfielder , is rumored to be leaving Cannes to take_over as coach of new French champion Paris St . Germain . Fernandez , who played_on the Parisian club ' s 1986 championship-winning team , would replace Portuguese Coach Artur Jorge . . . . Manchester United midfielder Bryan Robson , a former England captain , has retired after 13 years at the club , where he won three Football Assn . ( F.A. ) Cup medals , two league championships and a European Cup Winners ' Cup medal . Robson ' s 534-game career included 359 games for Manchester United . Anderlecht and Belgium defender Phillipe Albert is expected to be fit for World Cup duty after a two-month absence following knee surgery .</TEXT>
