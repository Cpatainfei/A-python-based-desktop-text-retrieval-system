   <HEADLINE> FORMER JORDAN RANCH DEDICATED AS FEDERAL PARK ; CEREMONY : THE EVENT IS HAILED AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL VICTORY ON LAND ONCE TARGETED FOR DEVELOPMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hundreds of hikers and equestrians gathered at Palo Comado Canyon ineastern Ventura County on Saturday to celebrate the dedication of the former cattle_ranch -- once slated for luxury homes and a PGA golf_course -- as federal parkland . Politicians and environmental activists also showed_up in_force to take credit for the acquisition of the 2 # 329-acre tract , formerly known as Jordan Ranch . The dedication began with an ancient ceremony led by Chumash Indian_Chief Charlie Cooke , who instructed the more_than 400 park visitors gathered under a canopy of oak_trees to reach down and touch the earth . &quot; Now you know what you ' re made of , &quot; he said . Then taking a clay bowl filled with smoldering white_sage , Cooke disbursed streams of smoke in a gesture symbolizing the purification of the land . The smoke had barely cleared before the jostling began between many of the dignitaries over who could claim the most credit for the acquisition of the tract , now part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area . The National_Park_Service bought Palo Comado Canyon from Bob Hope last June for $ 16.7 million after a drawn-out battle over a 750-home development and world-class golf_course planned for the site . Those development plans were shifted to nearby Ahmanson Ranch as part of a complex parkland-for-development deal . The fight to save Palo Comado Canyon involved five years of sparring among environmentalists and local , state and federal_officials . The politicking continued Saturday . Introduced by a federal park official as &quot; the father of the Santa Monica Mountains , &quot; Rep . Anthony Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) was the first to speak during the ceremony , which drew people from both Ventura and Los Angeles counties . &quot; It is of course for me extremely gratifying for all these many years to have been able to play a role in obtaining the funding to purchase this property &quot; as well as other mountain land , said Beilenson , who is running_for reelection this year . He went_on to thank other officials present for their role in helping to acquire Palo Comado Canyon . They included Ventura County Supervisor Maria VanderKolk , Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Director Joseph T . Edmiston and National Recreation Area Superintendent David Gackenbach . Beilenson also credited Gov . Pete Wilson and his staff for helping work_out a compromise deal between developers and county officials that resulted in the cancellation of development plans for the canyon . Beilenson acknowledged that Richard Sybert , Wilson ' s former planning director now competing for Beilenson ' s job , was present at the ceremony , but did not mention him by name . &quot; He will speak_to you shortly , so I won ' t introduce him , &quot; said Beilenson , eliciting laughs from the crowd . &quot; But he ' ll be around for a while. &quot; A short time later , Sybert , the governor ' s official representative at the ceremony , took the podium and wasted no time in returning the jab . &quot; As someone who plans to be here for a while , I ' d like to give credit where credit is_due -- to Congressman Beilenson , &quot; Sybert said . &quot; I know as he looks_back on a long career he will look_upon this as something to be proud of. &quot; In her speech , VanderKolk , a key player in the deal that resulted in the land purchase , noted that &quot; all_of the complicated reasons we are here today are not nearly so important as the fact we are here . I for one am happy that we are here together and celebrating this special moment. &quot; VanderKolk , who had been criticized by Sybert in the past for not giving Wilson enough credit in the parkland deal , did not mention Wilson or Sybert in her speech . She did , however , give special thanks to Beilenson as &quot; one of our most effective members of the House of Representatives and our white_knight in shining armor. &quot; Mary Wiesbrock , president of Save Open Space , an environmental group credited with leading the charge against development at Palo Comado Canyon , said she was proud_of &quot; what the public has accomplished. &quot; Still , Wiesbrock said the Park Service never should have paid Hope millions for the land . Because the property was landlocked -- with no legal access for a roadway -- it would have never been able to be developed , she said . But Edmiston of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy pointed_out that the land still had to be purchased for public use , adding that the value of the land was &quot; incalculable. &quot; Wiesbrock urged the crowd to join her group in fighting development on neighboring Ahmanson Ranch , where a 3 # 050-residence golf_course community is planned . &quot; Just as the public came_forward to stop development at Jordan Ranch , we ask you to please get active and save Ahmanson Ranch , &quot; she said . The Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved the giant Ahmanson Ranch project in 1993 on the condition that the development partners deliver to state and federal park agencies 10 # 000 acres of mountain land -- most of it owned by Hope . So far , only about 3 # 000 acres , including Palo Comado Canyon , have been acquired as parkland . The Ahmanson Land Co. , which has agreed to dedicate 2 # 633 acres of its ranch as open space , must still deliver two other Hope properties to park agencies before it can go_forward with its development . These include Hope ' s 4 # 369-acre Runkle Ranch near Chatsworth and his 339-acre Corral Canyon tract in Malibu . Aside from its significance as a recreation area , the Palo Comado Canyon acquisition preserves a key part of the wildlife corridor that runs from Simi Valley to the Pacific_Ocean . Bobcats , deer , mountain_lions and dozens of other species live among the rolling hills and rocky outcroppings of the tract that abuts the National Recreation Area ' s 2 # 150-acre Cheeseboro Canyon Park . Some of those who attended Saturday ' s dedication ceremonies said they were not bothered by all_the politicking . &quot; It ' s like a quarterback on a football_team , &quot; said Agoura resident Grant Gerson , 73 , who rode his horse to the ceremony . &quot; If you win , you ' re a hero . If you lose , you ' re a bum . I think all_of them have to be credited . But it ' s the people who won. &quot; Kitty Dill and her husband , Gordon , residents of Thousand Oaks , agreed . &quot; If it ' s important to them to say their piece , fine , &quot; Dill said . &quot; The reality is that Gordon and I can stand here under this oak_tree enjoying our iced_tea knowing that tomorrow and the next day we can come_back when there are no more political speeches. &quot; * RELATED STORY : B4</TEXT>
