   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : PIRU ; RIVER OIL SPILL CLEANUP COMPLETED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state_Department of Fish and Game on Wednesday declared clean the 173 # 000-gallon oil spill that drained into the Santa Clara River near Piru after a pipeline cracked during the Northridge earthquake . The cleanup took more_than 600 workers six weeks to complete and cost more_than $ 14 million . State Fish and Game Capt . Roger Reese said the Arco-owned Four Corners Pipe Line Co . did a good job responding to the spill , which polluted more_than 12 miles of the Santa Clara River and threatened its sensitive wildlife habitat . &quot; We ' re doing a damage assessment , but we won ' t know the results of that for some time , &quot; Reese said . Company officials said the spill had a minimal effect on plants and animals living_in the area . Meanwhile , the Taft-based oil_company responsible_for the McGrath Lake oil spill issued another report to state water officials . But like others written by Berry Petroleum , it fails to address the cause of the spill , discovered Dec . 25 near Oxnard . Officials at the Regional Water Quality_Control Board said Wednesday that it is not unusual for companies responsible_for oil spills to delay releasing relevant information . &quot; I would say this is typical of the kind of response we get , &quot; said Michael Lyons , who heads the surveillance unit of the water quality_control board in Los Angeles . &quot; The company responsible_for its spill tends to present information in as concise a form as possible , &quot; he said . The two-page report addresses six specific questions asked by the water agency on Feb . 1 , including what caused the spill and what measures were taken_to prevent it . But Berry Petroleum said Monday it still does not know how 84 # 000 gallons of thick crude_oil was released into the environmentally sensitive McGrath Lake wetlands over three days .
