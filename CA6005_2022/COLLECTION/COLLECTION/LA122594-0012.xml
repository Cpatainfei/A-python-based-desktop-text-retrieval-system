   <TEXT> With its bright colors , upbeat rock ' n ' roll soundtrack and strong ecological message , the 1992 animated film FernGully ... The Last Rain_Forest ( KTTV Sunday at 7:30 p.m. ) should delight children and amuse their older siblings and parents . Set_in an unspoiled tract of Australian rain_forest guarded by a tribe of tiny fairies , the film is based on a series of children ' s stories by Diane Young . The light comic wit of the 1990 Quick Change ( CBS Tuesday at 8 p.m. ) has a lovely premise : a trio of disillusioned New Yorkers -- a city planner ( Bill Murray ) , his sweetheart ( Geena Davis ) and Murray ' s goofy longtime friend ( Randy Quaid ) -- execute a brilliantly clever bank holdup . The loot : $ 1 million . Now all they have to do to be home free is to get_out of New York . With the city presented as an urban obstacle course of unmarked streets , wayward subway entrances and unfriendly natives , that proves to be easier said than done . Without the stunningly whimsical turtle suits supplied by Jim Henson ' s Creature Shop , the 1991 Teenage Mutant Turtles II : The Secret of the Ooze ( KTTV Monday at 8 p.m. ) , like its predecessor , might just look_like it sounds , which is pretty tacky . It takes_up where the original left_off , reintroducing us to Michelangelo , Leonardo and Donatello and their rat mentor , Splinter . With villains apparently in short supply , the movie resuscitates the monster-mobster of the previous movie , the infamous Shredder . With his 1992 City of Joy ( KCOP Monday at 8 p.m. , again on Friday at 2:30 a.m. ) , set_in Calcutta , Roland Joffe seems under the delusion that you can lure in the multitudes with an obvious plot and a hot star while educating them about India ' s downtrodden masses . Patrick Swayze , though miscast , is game as a surgeon who by chance meets a poor Indian family and winds_up working_at a public clinic . In the 1978 Same Time , Next Year ( KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m. ) adulterous Alan Alda sneaks_off with an also-married Ellen Burstyn for an affair that lasts only a weekend each year but endures for a quarter-century . This is an obvious theater piece , but as adapted by Bernard Slade from his play and directed by Robert Mulligan , it has warmth and skill . Michael Mann ' s riveting 1986 Manhunter ( KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m. ) offers an earlier incarnation of everybody ' s favorite cannibal -- this time played by Brian Cox .</TEXT>
