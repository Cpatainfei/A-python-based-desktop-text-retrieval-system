   <TEXT> &quot; ORIENTALE. &quot; Nathaniel Rosen , cello ; Doris Stevenson , piano . North_Star Records NS 0027.Subtitled &quot; Romantic Music for Cello , &quot; this collection revolves_around a style typified by Granados ' sensual Spanish Dance No . 2 -- &quot; Orientale , &quot; in Piatigorsky ' s transcription . Rosen ' s late mentor remains a major influence here ; Piatigorsky transcribed seven of the 17 pieces , and composed an eighth . His &quot; Syrinx , &quot; for unaccompanied cello -- in which Rosen turns_in a mysterious , eerie performance -- hold_up well against Debussy ' s famous flute solo . Backed by Stevenson , who provides compelling partnership , the cellist highlights his virtuosity throughout this repertory , tempering acrobatics with long cantabiles , as in Tchaikovsky ' s &quot; Valse Sentimentale &quot; and Saint-Saens ' inevitable &quot; Swan. &quot; SUSAN BLISS</TEXT>
