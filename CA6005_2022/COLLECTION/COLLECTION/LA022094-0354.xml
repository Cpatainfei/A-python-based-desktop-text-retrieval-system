   <HEADLINE> DAMAGE RAISES QUESTIONS ON MALLS ' SEISMIC SAFETY ; DISASTER : ANCHOR STORES , SUCH AS NORTHRIDGE BULLOCK ' S , WERE HIT HARD . ENGINEERS RENEW CALLS FOR RETROFITTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Of all_the destruction caused by the Jan . 17 earthquake , among the most striking failures was the collapsed Bullock ' s store at the Northridge Fashion Center , where hundreds of shoppers might have been injured or killed if the temblor had struck during business hours . Although that San Fernando Valley mall near the epicenter clearly fared the worst , interviews and city records show that other enclosed shopping_centers suffered varying degrees of damage -- from a collapsed roof and cracked concrete walls to loosened brick facades and fallen light fixtures . Many mall corridors were covered in shattered glass . In one , a water_main dropped from the ceiling , crushing a sales kiosk . A Times survey of a dozen shopping_malls within the earthquake ' s path , from the Valley to the Westside and the Crenshaw district , shows that at least 16 major department_stores remain closed because of quake damage , as do all_the shops inside the Northridge Fashion Center and Fashion Square Sherman Oaks . Although city inspectors and private engineers are still trying to assess the quake ' s effect on these centers of suburban life , they have observed that anchor stores , especially older ones , tended to suffer the heaviest damage . They also have found that in many instances non-structural elements such_as mirrors and merchandise displays presented more of a threat to shoppers and employees than structural failures did . Because the Northridge earthquake struck in the heart of a commercial center , experts say it affected malls like none before it , underscoring the potential for wide-scale casualties and the need for seismic upgrading . Of Southern California ' s 105 major shopping_centers , about half were built before building_codes incorporated the knowledge gained from the 1971 Sylmar earthquake . &quot; If we were to take the same approach with airplanes , the public would quickly become outraged , &quot; said structural engineer John Osteraas , who is helping to prepare a report for the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute of Oakland . Helmut Krawinkler , director of the John A . Blume Earthquake Engineering Center at Stanford_University , said all malls should be re-evaluated for seismic safety because tens of thousands of people pass_through them each day . &quot; We all know how lucky we were that ( the quake ) happened at 4:30 in the morning , &quot; Krawinkler said . Department_stores seemed to take a harder hit than the malls themselves , according to city building officials and private engineers . Some speculated that the many partition walls of the malls ' smaller stores provided stiffness to their structures and helped absorb energy from the earthquake . On the other hand , experts said , the tall ceilings and broad spaces of department_stores seem to have left them more vulnerable to the earthquake ' s shaking . They said large structures generally take longer to rebound from an earthquake ' s forces than smaller ones , leaving more opportunity for damage as they resonate . Several retail buildings -- such_as the Northridge Bullock ' s and a partially collapsed sister store in Sherman Oaks -- were made of reinforced concrete , a type of construction that the California Seismic Safety Commission has noted can snap under an earthquake ' s forces . Engineers examining retail outlets said they also have been struck by the volume of broken glass and poorly anchored architectural details such_as brick and tile veneers , decorative mirrors and display_cases , which could be lethal if they fall . &quot; We have not focused_on that issue strongly enough , &quot; said engineer Gregory Luth of Failure Analysis Associates . Under current codes , skylights must be made of tempered or wired_glass , which can cost more_than twice as much as conventional glass . But in storefronts , only the glass_in doorways or in display_windows that come within 18 inches of the floor must be tempered . The safety_glass requirement was not fueled by seismic considerations so_much as concern that someone could accidentally break the glass and get hurt , said Nick Delli Quadri , a senior structural engineer and spokesman for the Los Angeles Building and Safety Department . Decorative brick and tile also came loose in the earthquake , posing a potential hazard . At Topanga Plaza mall in Canoga Park and the nearby Promenade in Woodland Hills , the palatial , brick-covered entrances to a Nordstrom and Bullock ' s are under repair and remain off limits to the public because of earthquake damage . An architect for Nordstrom said the facade had started to separate from the wall during the quake . &quot; My speech is always the same , &quot; said structural engineer John Martin Jr . &quot; The ( greater ) danger isn ' t in the buildings , it ' s in the architectural elements falling on you. &quot; Sometimes the efforts of structural engineers can be diminished by architects ' creative indulgences , some engineers said . Fancy entrances and atriums with user-friendly open space can weaken earthquake-resistant walls , said Filip Filippou , a UC Berkeley engineer contributing to a university review of the Northridge quake . Malls also can be weakened by the cumulative effect of small remodeling projects in individual stores , said Drew A . Norman , a structural engineer whose clients include Century City Shopping_Center &amp; Marketplace . &quot; Any particular space within the mall may have been remodeled a dozen times since it was originally built , &quot; he said . Experts said that by far the most troubling sight has been the Northridge Bullock ' s , which opened in September , 1971 , with the rest of the Northridge Fashion Center . At the main entrance off Tampa Avenue , Bullock ' s brown-brick geodesic facade slipped almost entirely to the ground , leaving a gaping hole in the exterior wall . The view inside showed the top two of three stories squashed together in a jumble of concrete , steel and glass . &quot; It was the type of collapse where no one survives , &quot; said Martin , whose firm has been hired by the Northridge Fashion Center to analyze the damage . A spokeswoman for Bullock ' s parent , R.H. Macy &amp; Co. , said company officials are attributing the failure to the building ' s proximity to the Northridge earthquake ' s epicenter and to the fact that the 24-year-old building was designed to codes that were in_force before the Sylmar quake . The store ' s structural engineers are performing a more detailed analysis , she said , but she refused to disclose their names . The architecture firm that designed the store , Welton Beckett &amp; Associates of Santa Monica , is now Ellerbe Beckett of Santa Monica . Greg Nook , a senior_vice_president there , said he spoke_to the firm ' s former owner . &quot; He had no reason to believe that it was designed inconsistent with the codes or built inconsistent with the drawings . &quot; It ' s very difficult to say what the cause was , &quot; Nook said of the collapse . The top two stories of the building apparently collapsed because the ties between the floors and supporting_columns were not strong enough , said several engineers who viewed the store . &quot; They didn ' t have good connections , &quot; said Ben Schmid , a structural engineer for 45 years and a past president of the Structural Engineers Assn . of Southern California . The four-story Bullock ' s at Fashion Square Sherman Oaks was also declared unsafe by city inspectors . The roof collapsed like a V onto the top floor , one city building official said . Like the Bullock ' s in Northridge , it was designed by Welton Beckett &amp; Associates . It opened in 1962 . Elsewhere at the 1.5-million-square-foot Northridge Fashion Center , the Broadway , two Robinsons-May stores , Sears and JC Penney remain closed . Officials of some department_stores refused to discuss the damage , and city building officials said their inspectors have been too busy to conduct more thorough follow-up inspections of the malls . Within the mall , a preliminary review by Martin indicated that the shopping_center &quot; took a very severe beating &quot; that distorted its steel frame , but that it came_through the quake surprisingly well . The full extent of the structural damage has to be determined , Martin said . About 60 % of the mall ' s storefront windows shattered , some ceiling tiles fell , and everything imaginable on shelves and in display_cases fell_over , said general_manager Lloyd Miller . The four parking garages sustained such extensive damage that they have to be rebuilt . The only other mall that remains entirely closed is the Fashion Square Sherman Oaks . Mall spokeswoman Sandy Turner said the 32-year-old shopping_center suffered no structural damage and the city cleared it for occupancy . But Turner said the owners have been conducting a thorough review of the property for seismic and fire safety . To avoid reminding shoppers of the quake , the owners also want to remove all traces of damage before reopening , she said . At the Fallbrook Mall in West Hills , heavy decorative mirrors fell from atop one-story columns , and a 12-inch sprinkler main crashed from the ceiling onto a kiosk and &quot; disintegrated &quot; it , according to general_manager Eric Knudson . &quot; It was like something right out of Hollywood studios , &quot; Knudson said . The Sherman Oaks Galleria ' s steel structure held_up well , a spokeswoman said , but in a recently remodeled wing , several brass and glass light fixtures plunged in one piece to the floor . The mall ' s architects were investigating why the fixtures , measuring 10 or 12 feet long , broke_loose , said mall marketing director Karalyn Lucci . Topanga Plaza proved a testament to seismic upgrading . Opened in 1964 as the first enclosed mall west of the Mississippi , the shopping_center underwent a $ 45-million face_lift two years ago that included extensive seismic work , according to marketing director Annette Bethers . The architects added a $ 4-million , steel and concrete frame to the original building that was designed to absorb the shock of an earthquake , transfer its forces_back into the ground and hold its two stories together . It worked , Bethers said . The mall suffered a_few broken storefronts and cracked floor tiles and most of its stores quickly reopened . &quot; We feel smart and we feel more_than smart , we feel lucky that we did our ( seismic ) work when we did_it , &quot; Bethers said . Meanwhile , three of the plaza ' s anchor stores that were built at_the_same_time and of similar construction -- the Broadway , Robinsons-May and Montgomery Ward -- suffered varying degrees of structural damage and will remain closed for three to six months , Bethers said . Even before the earthquake struck , Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson had advocated retrofitting older , &quot; non-ductile &quot; structures -- those made of inflexible materials that do not move easily and could snap in a quake -- such_as the collapsed Northridge Bullock ' s . Los Angeles has an estimated 400 to 1 # 000 non-ductile buildings constructed in the 1950s , ' 60s and early ' 70s , officials said . &quot; We have an opportunity to learn from things that have happened in this quake , &quot; said Bernson , whose district includes the Northridge Fashion Center , where he once ran a T-shirt shop . The state Seismic Safety Commission , which is collecting information on the Northridge quake , has yet to hear evidence specifically on malls or issue any recommendations . But Executive_Director Tom Tobin agreed with Bernson and experts that older , high-occupancy buildings of reinforced concrete &quot; should be evaluated and the owners should be responsible_for doing what is necessary to prevent a collapse. &quot; Asked whether retrofitting should be required by law , Tobin replied : &quot; I think eventually it has to be. &quot; Los Angeles developer Arthur Pearlman , state director for the International Council of Shopping_Centers , said retrofitting should be done on a case by case basis , even for older buildings . &quot; My personal opinion is that the buildings designed after the 1971 earthquake are all up_to ( current seismic ) standards , and obviously more standards will come_out after this quake , &quot; Pearlman said . Robert Tindall , one of the architects who renovated Topanga Plaza , said the $ 4-million seismic upgrade represented a modest part of the overall cost of the $ 45-million remodeling project . But Tindall , a senior partner at Callison Partnership in Seattle , said seismic upgrading often increases renovation costs as much as 30 % . &quot; It ' s going_to be a tough decision developers will be facing , &quot; he said . &quot; Knowing what we know today , I ' m not sure it makes_sense not to include a seismic upgrade as part of your project . And I think the cities are going_to require it. &quot; Damaged Malls The dramatic collapse of a Bullock ' s store in Northridge and other damage to malls has heightened awareness of seismic safety in shopping_centers .
