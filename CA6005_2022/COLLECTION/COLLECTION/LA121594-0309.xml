   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; RUSSIANS PLAYING THE BLAME GAME OVER CHECHNYA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Famous last words . Russian Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev , speaking late last month , boasted that &quot; one regiment of paratroopers would need just two hours to solve the whole issue &quot; in breakaway Chechnya . Four days after Moscow sent thousands of troops streaming toward the Chechen capital of Grozny , those words come_off as bravado so outrageous as_to be almost comical . Except that to Russians there is nothing comical about the flaws in intelligence and military planning revealed by snags in the offensive . Why , media and analysts ask , was Russia ' s crisis with Chechnya allowed to get so out of hand that only massive force could solve it ? Why does the Russian march_on the breakaway region seem so impromptu ? And why were Russian troops caught by surprise when villagers outside Chechnya , in neighboring Dagestan and Ingushetia , blocked their way , leading to deaths , injuries and the humiliating loss of armored vehicles ? In the finger-pointing that has gathered momentum since Sunday , one target is taking the most blame -- the Federal Counterintelligence Service , a rough Russian equivalent of the FBI known by its Russian initials , FSK . &quot; I would give the FSK an F for its preparation of the operation without a moment of hesitation , &quot; said security expert Sergei Blagovolin , an adviser to President Boris N . Yeltsin . &quot; They failed to recruit people who are against ( Chechen President Dzhokar M. ) Dudayev -- and there are very many of those people in Chechnya . They could not work properly with the opposition . that ' s a kindergarten level of work . The FSK ' s preparation for the operation was disastrous. &quot; The FSK is charged with fighting foreign spies , terrorists and threats to Russia ' s security , including economic dangers . It came formally into existence only in January after yet another revamping of the remnants of the Soviet KGB , and it answers directly to Yeltsin . These days , in contrast to the all-powerful KGB , it must also answer to the_likes_of nationalist lawmaker Alexander Nevzorov . Nevzorov demanded that FSK Director Sergei V . Stepashin come_to Parliament to face the criticism . &quot; Stepashin is a lazybones , &quot; Nevzorov snapped . &quot; It ' s his fault that 18-year-old soldiers with runny noses are fighting there , not officers ' battalions trained for that purpose . . . . Let the FSK pay_for sending a special contingent of troops there. &quot; Stepashin was also taking flak from the Russian media . &quot; Was it really impossible to foresee ( and therefore prevent ) the reaction of the populations in Ingushetia and Dagestan ? &quot; wondered Dmitri Ostalsky in the newspaper Sevodnya . Ingush and Dagestani villagers burned at least 30 military_vehicles , and dozens of soldiers were taken hostage . Alexander Minkin ' s questions in Moskovsky Komsomolets , Russia ' s most popular daily , were even sharper : &quot; If ( we had to invade ) Chechnya , why did_it have to be done so stupidly , so talentlessly , so unpreparedly ? There have been reports that paratroopers arrested Stepashin -- he didn ' t know the password . Is this cooperation ? And why in winter ? It ' s hard enough to operate in the mountains even in summertime . Why do we know_nothing ? Is there a plan ? &quot; Analysts also appeared little impressed by the initial performance of the new Russian army in its biggest operation since it was created in 1992 . &quot; As for the military side of the operation , I would give them only a C , &quot; Blagovolin said . &quot; So far , they have avoided a lot of bloodshed. &quot; Vitaly Tretyakov , editor of the respected newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta , wrote scathingly : &quot; The start of the Chechen expedition as a fact and its first results ( the reaction of the local population , the losses among Russian troops , the colonels taken captive ! ! ! ) testify to the total incompetence of those who planned it both from the point_of_view of ethnic politics and the military aspect. &quot; The Russian troops struggling toward Grozny have come_in_for fewer attacks than the FSK , perhaps because they are seen as unfortunates fulfilling an unpleasant task . But their slow progress did their image no favor . &quot; The longer it takes_for our military_actions there , the greater will grow Dudayev ' s authority and prestige , &quot; worried Sergei Oznobishchev , director of the Center for International Security Problems at the USA-Canada Institute , a Moscow think_tank . The Russian army is also clearly suffering from the weak turnout in recent military drafts and the diminishing officer corps , both of which have left most units undermanned . &quot; Where can we get soldiers other_than the 18-year-olds you saw on TV ? &quot; asked Col . Gen . Yuri Rodionov , a member_of_Parliament ' s defense committee . &quot; It ' s all very easy to discuss problems , but it is very difficult to organize such an operation. &quot; Indeed , most commentators did not blame the army for how it carried_out its orders -- they instead pointed_out that the orders would never have needed to be given if not for the FSK . It was the FSK that , by all accounts , organized the Nov . 26 attempt at storming Grozny by forces that claimed to be Chechen opposition to Dudayev but were actually stacked with recruits from the Russian army . One problem was that the Russian soldiers were recruited by the FSK so clandestinely that their own commanders didn ' t know that their men would be moonlighting . That got the Defense Ministry understandably mad at the FSK . Another problem was that when the Russians were routed , officers were taken prisoner and forced to admit their role in the would-be coup . Acknowledging its shame , the FSK sacked its deputy chief , Yevgeny Savostyanov , who had overseen the Caucasus region for the service . Even worse , the disastrous Nov . 26 attack on Dudayev was the third of its kind , military observers say . When the FSK realized the last storm had failed , analysts believe , it immediately began to push for a major operation to squash Dudayev once and for all . Battered by public_opinion , the FSK may take its revenge on Dudayev personally . According to Russian reports , it has been putting_together a super-elite group of 120 commandos to slip into Grozny and &quot; liquidate &quot; the Chechen president .</TEXT>
