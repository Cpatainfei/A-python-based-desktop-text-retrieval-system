   <HEADLINE> BREAKING THE GLASS ; PANEL SEEKS TO REMOVE CEILING ON PROMOTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What are the best ways to smash the hard-to-spot barriers that prevent women and minorities from advancing in the workplace ? The executive_director of a federal commission exploring the &quot; glass ceiling &quot; offers two possible solutions that would give many executives heartaches : reinvigorate the labor_movement and expand the power of government regulators . Joyce D . Miller , the longtime labor_leader who runs the U.S. Labor_Department ' s Glass Ceiling Commission , says her panel has lots of work to do before issuing its recommendations next January on promoting diversity and fighting discrimination on_the_job . But Miller , in Los Angeles to conduct a public hearing Friday that will spotlight her commission ' s efforts , says some answers are already clear . And , she insists , they aren ' t hostile to business . &quot; Corporations , unions and organizations aren ' t going_to promote programs for diversity and for breaking the glass ceiling just because it ' s the right thing to do , &quot; Miller said . &quot; The change is going_to take_place when companies realize that diversity is a smart business decision . &quot; You want to make more use of everyone in your work_force , and the only way you are going_to is by promoting diversity and breaking the glass ceiling , &quot; she said . Already , Miller said , some major employers are making strides in that direction . One of the most effective approaches , she said , is the establishment of &quot; mentoring &quot; programs . New or lower-level workers are teamed with veteran employees who acquaint them with the ins and outs of their organizations . Such programs , she said , can provide insights on &quot; the kinds of things that aren ' t in the employee handbook , such_as how you should dress and who are the politically important people in your organization. &quot; Although some employers are voluntarily adopting programs to remove obstacles that traditionally have hindered women and minorities in the workplace , many others will need prodding , Miller said . To that end , she said her commission ' s members are beginning to think_about ways that government regulators can do more to promote diversity in the private sector . For instance , companies hoping to win antitrust clearance for mergers might be required to meet equal employment opportunity standards . Although Miller acknowledged that such a proposal would be politically explosive , she noted that federal contractors are already are required to pass such tests . &quot; I know what the attitudes are toward more regulation . All I can say is that we ' re considering it , &quot; said Miller , whose panel ' s recommendations will not be binding . Still , she said , the best way to promote equal_opportunity is for enlightened employers to lead by example -- and for unions to push for the same goals at companies that balk . Miller , one of the most powerful women in the U.S. labor_movement , credits_unions with spearheading the push for equal_opportunity on_the_job . She said unions will do even more on that score if the Clinton_Administration is successful in passing labor law reform , including a proposal to prevent employers from permanently replacing strikers . Miller joined the union now known as the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers after getting her master ' s degree in social_science from the University of Chicago in 1962 . Starting as the union ' s education director in the Chicago area , she rose through the ranks to become the first woman elected to the executive_council of the AFL-CIO in 1980 .</TEXT>
