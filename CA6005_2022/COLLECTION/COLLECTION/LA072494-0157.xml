   <HEADLINE> THE REAL U.S. SENATE_RACE : ADVERTISING MAN VS . ADVERTISING MAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Californians vote_in November for their next U.S. senator , will they choose Bill Carrick or Larry McCarthy ? Who ? Carrick and McCarthy are the advertising consultants for Sen . Dianne Feinstein and Rep . Michael Huffington , respectively . They represent the front-line contingent in what is shaping_up to be an unprecedented battle for the hearts , if not the minds , of voters . Their advertising war will probably set new spending records . It may also establish new marks for duration and intensity of mud-slinging . Disturbingly , it is a campaign in which in the candidates have been overshadowed by their media spots . Feinstein and Huffington have become little more_than high-priced TV images manufactured by their political handlers , or by their opponent ' s handlers . Money and media , to be sure , have always driven political messages . But never so quickly and deeply into the mire . Or with so few alternative sources of information available to voters . Call it the bull-horn effect . The candidate who blares the loudest , the most often and whose message grabs the voters will be heard above the din . So far , it has boosted Huffington . that ' s due partly to Huffington ' s willingness to tap his personal fortune to fund his race . He has reportedly spent more_than $ 9 million on his campaign -- all but $ 300 # 000 out of_his_own pocket . Feinstein , by comparison , has used only about $ 4 # 000 of_her_own money , according to her most recent disclosure statement , along with nearly $ 6 million in contributions , of which she has spent $ 3 million . Remember when voters were skeptical , when not scornful , of candidates who spent their own money ? Today ' s anti-politician electorate views personal funds as the only really &quot; clean &quot; campaign money . Which is why Huffington ' s handlers can use paid media to turn his wealth into a political asset . Consider : Touting her assistance to Raytheon , a Santa Barbara County-based corporation , Feinstein took_to the airwaves to attack Huffington for not helping business interests in his own congressional_district . But he counter-attacked . Noting Raytheon ' s contributions to Feinstein , the ad voice-over crowed : &quot; Mike Huffington doesn ' t take special-interest money . Feinstein ' s taken_over $ 6 million . Feinstein ' s a special-interest jukebox -- put_in your money and get what you want. &quot; In less than two years , Feinstein , who won election as the ultimate outsider , has become the consummate insider . By doing what senators are supposed to do -- legislate and protect the interests of their state -- she is tarred as part of the problem of business-as-usual in Washington . Huffington has used his money and media to drive this point home , attacking Feinstein for supporting President Bill_Clinton ' s health plan ( &quot; The government that gave us the welfare mess now wants to screw_up health_care &quot; ) , and then for deserting it when she and Clinton appeared to be dropping_in public-opinion polls ( &quot; It ' s the only principle of a career politician -- save your own skin &quot; ) . Feinstein ' s campaign has ratcheted-up its responses to Huffington ' s media barrage ( &quot; He ' ll say anything to get elected &quot; ) . She now relentlessly spotlights &quot; CONGRESSMAN Huffington , &quot; while portraying herself as merely a recent visitor ( &quot; In my short time in the Senate . . . &quot; ) unsullied by that tainted institution ( &quot; . . . I ' ve just begun to fight for California &quot; ) . Perhaps this marathon of slime would n ' t be so reprehensible if voters could weigh the fairy tales spun by media gurus against reality . But fragmentation , niche programming , viewer non-interest and the economics of television_news have combined to shrink political coverage . And what happens if a major media event -- say , the murder trial of O.J. Simpson -- dominates the news ? When media interest and public attention become fixated on something as sensational as the Simpson case , political news virtually disappears . The California senator stands to lose from such a lack of press attention . News_reports tend to influence voters much more_than campaign ads , and Feinstein , already a high-profile senator , has worked hard to generate coverage for her legislative accomplishments . But in a world almost devoid_of election coverage , paid media will define the debate . The more manufactured the campaign becomes , the more it will help Huffington , who is , by and large , a manufactured candidate . From the beginning , his handlers have controlled access to him and limited his unscripted public appearances . As a result , Huffington ' s paid TV and radio spots , not press scrutiny , have framed voters ' perceptions of his positions on the issues . In a politics-free news environment , Huffington can buy &quot; bundled &quot; media -- a package of advertising that uses targeted television , radio , voter slates , direct mail and even tailored videocassettes to supplement or replace both paid and unpaid mass media . Feinstein ' s going_to have to come a lot closer to him in fund-raising to compete . What do candidates do to interest a distracted press and public in the fall election ? How can voters acquire the information necessary to make reasoned choices in November ? It says a lot about California -- its politics and media -- that to guarantee coverage of the fall campaign , it might become necessary for candidates to hold their events on the front steps of the Criminal_Courts Building during recesses in the Simpson trial. *</TEXT>
