   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; BATTLING OVER BIBLES IN CHINA ; THE ARREST OF A RENEGADE U.S. EVANGELIST SIGNALS A CRACKDOWN ON FOREIGN MISSIONARIES . OFFICIALS HAVE TOLERATED ' DISCREET ' TEACHERS . BUT NOW THEY WANT TO LIMIT HOW FAR RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY CAN GO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rev . Dennis Balcombe , a Hong Kong-based faith healer known for his confrontational evangelism , has a history of provoking Chinese authorities . Police in Guangzhou ( Canton ) once detained him for conducting a weekly &quot; English_class &quot; with only one textbook -- the Bible . Another time , the 49-year-old American preacher says , he evaded arrest during an illegal outdoor prayer_meeting by hiding under blankets in a Chinese burial cart . Given such brazen acts , it is no wonder that Chinese officials chose Balcombe , whose &quot; Donkeys for Jesus &quot; program is one of the biggest Bible-smuggling operations in Asia , as the first target for new rules controlling foreign religious activity . Balcombe , who runs his Bible project out of a storefront Hong Kong church , is clearly on the radical fringe of Christian activists . But his arrest Feb . 11 in Henan province focused world attention on a surprising resurgence of Christian missionary activity in China . It also revived an old debate over proper behavior for Christian foreigners seeking converts and sent a warning to Christian teachers here and to their overseas sponsors . Forty-five years after Communists under Mao Tse-tung expelled most foreign church workers , hundreds of missionaries -- though few dare use that term publicly -- are back . The Communist government tolerates some low-key religious activity by foreigners because it needs English_teachers , especially those willing to take_on the toughest , most remote assignments . But officials have now drawn certain lines , banning missionary_work and limiting the religious activities in which Christian foreigners can participate . New regulations consolidating rules that existed in several provinces were signed by Premier Li Peng on Jan . 31 . Officials said the new rules were intended as guidelines for thousands of foreigners who have flooded into China during the recent era of economic reform . Many of these foreigners -- business people , consultants , professionals -- brought strong religious_beliefs with them . Authorities felt the need to codify acceptable behavior . In what officials admit was a test_case , Balcombe was arrested 11 days after he conducted an all-night mountaintop prayer_meeting with peasants . &quot; It was a warning , &quot; Chinese Religious Affairs Bureau official Zhang Weida said in a Beijing interview . Zhang heads the policy section of the office that drafted the new regulations . Officially , there are 12 million Christians in China , 7 million of them Protestant and 5 million Roman_Catholic . Officially at least , the number of Christians falls far below that of Buddhists , estimated officially at 100 million , and Muslims , at 17 million . China now recognizes Buddhism , Taoism , Islam , Catholicism and Protestantism . The Chinese Church Research_Center , a Hong Kong-based group that tracks Christian activities in China , estimates that more_than 2 # 000 Christians , mostly Americans , work as &quot; foreign experts &quot; teaching English and other subjects in remote areas . These teachers account_for more_than one-fourth of the nation ' s 7 # 500 foreign advisers and experts . Some carefully observe laws against proselytizing . &quot; We all knew the restrictions before we came here , &quot; said Thom Downing , 32 , a Quaker teacher from Pittsburgh , Pa. , who works in Jiangsu province . He opposes overt missionary activity : &quot; Personally , I don ' t have a lot of respect for people who come exclusively to proselytize under the guise of being teachers. &quot; Others , however , come_to spread their religion , some by clandestinely recruiting Chinese . Reports of &quot; bathtub baptisms &quot; and unauthorized Bible classes are common . Lay teachers in universities regularly complain that some of their Christian colleagues are more interested in &quot; saving souls &quot; than they are in teaching grammar . &quot; They keep a score card , &quot; complained a foreign teacher in Nanjing . &quot; Every day they come_in and say , ' I made another Christian today. ' &quot; Unlike many lay foreign experts , the Christian teachers are willing to travel_to the most remote and primitive settings to work for token salaries paid by the government . Missionary teachers can be found in the barren reaches of Inner Mongolia and the mountainous terrain of Tibet . &quot; There are some places in China that no one would go_to unless they were convinced God wanted them to go , &quot; explained a Hong Kong-based Christian publications editor , who asked not to be named because of his organization ' s missionary activity in China . Also , local authorities sometimes prefer the Christian teachers because they are less likely to become involved in sexual_relations with residents or in political activity , both of which officials fear even more_than religion . Nevertheless , missionary_work is still a very sensitive subject . Since Jesuit priests arrived in the late 16th Century , Christian missionaries have often been at the center of conflict between China and the West . In the 19th Century , inspired by Christian missionary tracts and convinced he was the younger brother of Jesus , charismatic leader Hong Xiuquan led peasants in the bloody Taiping Rebellion against the Qing Dynasty . For 11 years , until the rebellion was crushed with the help of Western mercenaries in 1864 , Hong ruled his &quot; Heavenly Kingdom &quot; from a base in Nanjing . During the Boxer uprising of 1898-1900 , Christian missionaries and their converts were the main targets of a bloody movement mounted by a mystical order , the Righteous and Harmonious Fists , known to foreigners as the Boxers . The movement ' s members , who believed they were immune to gunfire , accused the missionaries of plotting to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and obliterate traditional Chinese culture , among other crimes . Before the Communist_Party defeated the Nationalists in 1949 , 6 # 000 Christian missionaries_worked on the mainland , many sympathetic to the Nationalists . In its literature , the Communist_Party still views missionaries as &quot; tools of imperialism. &quot; But despite their large_numbers at various times ( 6 # 000 in 1930 , for example ) , foreign missionaries have historically been ineffective in obtaining converts . Their main contributions were in the creation of schools and hospitals . The recent emergence of foreign missionaries largely results from the opening of the Chinese economy initiated by senior leader Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s . Because of the economic reforms , China desperately needs foreign teachers and funding for universities and technical institutes . One of the largest sponsors of Christian teachers in China , the_English Language Institute / China , based in San Dimas , has 200 teachers at 60 Chinese universities . In a telephone_interview , institute Executive_Vice_President Bill Bauer said the organization , whose budget last year topped $ 4.8 million , has a &quot; professional , non-religious focus. &quot; However , the institute ' s recruitment brochures , distributed mainly on Christian college campuses in the United States , stress &quot; a Christian commitment &quot; as the first requirement , followed by an undergraduate or graduate degree , an aptitude for teaching and &quot; the ability to build close personal friendships. &quot; &quot; Since 1982 , &quot; states one publicity brochure , &quot; the_English Language Institute / China has had the exciting privilege of sending qualified Christian professionals to China . Through E.L.I.C. , over 150 # 000 Chinese students have been touched in over 60 of China ' s most important universities. &quot; Although he assiduously avoids calling his teachers &quot; missionaries , &quot; Bauer said they are highly appreciated by their Chinese hosts &quot; because of their Christian , moral , ethical standards. &quot; One man who does not shrink_from the missionary title is Balcombe , who is affiliated with the Shiloh Christian Fellowship in Oakland . Tall and fair , with a talent for language -- gained by studying the Bible in Chinese , he says -- Balcombe came_to China 25 years ago after serving as an Army cook in Vietnam . When he was expelled three days after his arrest in February , Balcombe held a news_conference in Hong Kong at which he accused Chinese authorities of brutality and the theft of more_than $ 14 # 000 in cash and video_equipment . He later testified before a U.S. congressional subcommittee investigating possible trade sanctions against China . Many other Christian groups in China object to Balcombe ' s guerrilla-style tactics . In a manual , &quot; How to Prepare for Possible Arrest in Visiting Christians in China , &quot; Balcombe advises followers to feign ignorance of Chinese and to &quot; speak in tongues &quot; if accosted by authorities . In another section of the six-page manual , he instructs followers to &quot; go_on the offensive if the Lord tells you to do so. &quot; &quot; Never use force or violence , &quot; wrote Balcombe , who grew_up in Southern California and attended high_school in Pomona , &quot; but make them do something against you . Refuse to move without notifying your embassy . Then , when they forcibly move you , accuse them of hitting you or hurting you. &quot; In a recent interview in his Hong Kong church , Balcombe said he sometimes invests in Chinese joint-venture businesses , such_as local_department stores , to provide a rationale for his frequent missions . In this age of economic development , China looks more kindly on businessmen than on preachers . Most of the money for Balcombe ' s investments comes from contributions by U.S. churches . During the interview , other members of his church practiced speaking Chinese in one room . Volunteers in other rooms packed suitcases with Chinese-language Bibles and other religious tracts that are smuggled to the mainland on daily Donkeys for Jesus runs . &quot; We never use the word smuggle , &quot; he explained . &quot; We just put them in our suitcase and we take them . We are not using ( shipping ) containers or other sleazy methods. &quot; The church has about 20 regular couriers and distributes a brochure urging overseas Christians to participate , providing low-cost dormitory housing in Hong Kong for those who come . The couriers enter China as tourists , with the understanding that authorities will not arrest them for smuggling but may confiscate their Bibles . &quot; To some of us who get involved in this type of work , it ' s a bit like 007 ( James Bond ) , &quot; said one courier , a 46-year-old man from Shawnee Mission , Kan . &quot; Everyone who gets_into this kind of work has a spirit of adventure. &quot; More_than most of the foreign Christians working in China , Balcombe sees himself at war with authorities who would block the spread of the faith . &quot; Some people will say that Dennis Balcombe is a troublemaker and that all these missionaries should keep_out of religion , &quot; he said , speaking in staccato bursts . &quot; But to us , what is the sense of being a Christian ? We don ' t think that just helping a nation learn English or improve the economy is going_to do anything . We think people need Jesus_Christ . They need the Gospel . The problem of society is not education , but that there are no morals. &quot; Balcombe ' s arrest and the resulting publicity rekindled the debate here about the conduct of foreign Christians in China , where governments dating_from the early dynasties have viewed foreign religions as potential threats to stability . Foreign Christians recently worried that Chinese authorities planned a general crackdown on missionary_work . At the very minimum , one Hong Kong-based church scholar reported , the new regulations give local authorities the power to quash foreign religious activity when and if they want . In an interview in Beijing , Religious Affairs Bureau policy director Zhang said the new regulations were necessary because of the flood of foreigners working in China during the period of economic development . &quot; More and more foreigners are coming_to China , &quot; Zhang explained . &quot; Most have religious_beliefs . These foreigners want a religious life. &quot; The regulations grant foreigners some expanded rights to practice their religion . If invited to China by officially recognized religious bodies , for example , foreigners theoretically are permitted to discuss the Scriptures and even deliver sermons . But the new rules also clearly state what the foreigners are not permitted to do , including &quot; establish religious organizations , set_up religious offices , open places for religious activities or run religious institutes . Nor may they develop followers , appoint religious personnel or conduct missionary activity among Chinese citizens. &quot; After the new regulations came_out , many foreign Christians acted quickly , through letters and articles in church bulletins , to reassure overseas sponsors that the Balcombe incident was an isolated case that would not affect most Christian teachers here . Elyn MacInnis is the pastor of the international congregation of St . Paul ' s Church in Nanjing . Most of her small congregation -- about 50 people attended the Palm_Sunday service -- are English_teachers in the Nanjing area who were recruited by Christian groups . MacInnis , an Episcopal priest from Rochester , N.Y. , said few feel threatened by the regulations . &quot; We were just horrified that people in the West would think that what happened to Dennis Balcombe is what is happening in China , &quot; she said . &quot; From my point_of_view , the new regulations are beneficial , &quot; said Susan Stiles , an Episcopal minister working as an English_teacher at a technical institute near Nanjing . &quot; The regulations tell us where we stand with the Chinese and give us legal recourse. &quot; Nevertheless , the Balcombe incident deeply divided the church community both inside China and abroad . The debate is between those who advocate working within the rules set by Beijing , and those who favor clandestine church work . In the balance are millions of dollars in donations for China missions raised in the churches of the United States and Europe , and in the powerful Protestant Christian communities of South_Korea and Taiwan . In a recent interview , Father Peter Barry , a Roman_Catholic priest with the Holy_Spirit Study Center , a Hong Kong-based research_center for Chinese religious matters , crystallized the terms of the debate : &quot; Should it be Bible-thumping or dialogue ? An analysis of missionary method is badly needed at this time. &quot; Special correspondent Christine Courtney in Hong Kong contributed to this story .</TEXT>
