   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO STEP_UP PRESSURE ON HAITI ; CARIBBEAN : WASHINGTON MAKES MOVES TOWARD INVASION IN BID TO SHOW REGIME CLINTON IS NOT BLUFFING . DEADLINE WEIGHED AS PART OF ' BRINKMANSHIP ' CAMPAIGN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration plans military and diplomatic actions over the next few weeks -- including new movements of U.S. troops into the Caribbean and a possible speech by President Clinton -- to ensure that Haiti ' s military rulers get the message that Clinton is serious about invading their nation if they do not step_down , officials said Friday . As part of a concerted campaign of combined psychological_warfare and political signals , U.S. Navy ships and other forces are being readied to move closer to Haiti . U.S. warplanes will increase their window-rattling flights over the island . And 266 Caribbean troops are heading for some well-publicized training on a U.S. base in nearby Puerto Rico . On the non-military side , Clinton aides are planning statements by the President to seek public and congressional support for an invasion . The Administration has asked leaders in other countries , like Dominican_Republic President Joaquin Balaguer , to tell the Haitians that the United States is not bluffing this time . Clinton is also seriously considering setting a formal deadline for the Haitians to step_down and sending a last-ditch diplomatic_mission to deliver the message -- just as President George_Bush did to Iraq before the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War . The Administration already has warned the Haitian regime that a major massacre of its domestic opponents or any attack on U.S. citizens in Haiti could touch_off immediate U.S. military_action . Taken together , the Administration ' s actions add_up to a classic exercise in brinkmanship : moving its forces to_the_point of an invasion to increase the chance that Haiti ' s rulers might blink . &quot; We still hope the Haitian military regime will get the message and allow us to resolve this thing without using force , &quot; said one official involved in Haiti policy . &quot; Until now , they never got the message . They always focused_on the factors that weren ' t in place yet and the conflicting signals coming_out of Washington that suggested that we might not be serious . &quot; The signal they have been waiting for is now there : concrete steps that require the international community and the different agencies of the U.S._government to cooperate , &quot; he said . &quot; That is beginning to happen and they are going_to see more of it. &quot; This week , the Administration stepped_up its rhetoric on Haiti , with Deputy Defense_Secretary John Deutch publicly declaring : &quot; The time for action has arrived . . . . There can be no doubt in anybody ' s mind that the ( U.S.-led ) multinational force is going_to Haiti. &quot; As important as Deutch ' s message , officials said , was the position of the person delivering it -- a top official from the Pentagon . Until this week , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry had been a leading voice warning of the perils of an invasion of Haiti . For the first time , the Haitians see the State and Defense_departments &quot; singing from the same hymnbook , &quot; one official said . At the same time , the Administration collected two important new pieces of international backing for military_action . Deutch and Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott won commitments from Caribbean countries , including Jamaica , Belize and Trinidad_and_Tobago , for troops in an invasion . Their offer of 266 soldiers in rear-echelon units was little more_than symbolic , but it provided the Administration with much-desired evidence that the United States would not be alone in supporting military_action . Second , U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali privately reported that he has received commitments from 10 countries to provide at least 2 # 000 troops for a U.N. peacekeeping force that would follow an invasion -- the bare minimum needed . The foreign troops would combine with 2 # 000 U.S. troops , U.N. officials said . The increasingly detailed preparations suggest , just as officials intended , that Clinton is moving steadily closer to a decision to invade Haiti if Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras and his fellow military rulers do not step_down . But they also suggest that it will take roughly a month before all_the desired preliminary steps have been taken . The training of the 266 Caribbean troops , for example , has yet to start and will take at least four weeks to complete . &quot; We ' re not expecting to see any real military operations for several more weeks , &quot; said a Pentagon official familiar_with the Administration ' s strategy . Still , Administration officials said that they believe the Haitian leaders may be vulnerable to the kind of steady escalation in pressure that they plan . The success of the Administration strategy depends_on Clinton ' s ability to convey the message that he is serious about invading -- the essence of what became known in the Cold_War as &quot; brinkmanship. &quot; John Foster Dulles , President Dwight D . Eisenhower ' s secretary_of_state , was credited with inventing the term when he said , speaking_of U.S. confrontations with the Soviet_Union , &quot; The ability to get_to the verge without getting_into the war is the necessary art. &quot; In this instance of brinkmanship , officials noted , the Administration suffers from one major handicap but also enjoys one major advantage . The handicap is that Clinton has won a reputation , fairly or not , for indecision , including over what to do_in Haiti . The Haitians &quot; have always doubted our commitment , and they have had some reason , &quot; one official said . As a result , he said , the Haitians may_not recognize that Clinton and his aides really are serious -- and thus force the United States to go_over the brink and invade . The advantage , on the other hand , is that an invasion of Haiti , with its ramshackle army of about 7 # 000 troops and no functioning air_force or navy , poses no danger of seriously daunting U.S. casualties . &quot; We ' ve tried everything else , &quot; one official said glumly . &quot; This is the only option we have left. &quot; And , he said , &quot; it ' s beginning to look almost inevitable. &quot;</TEXT>
