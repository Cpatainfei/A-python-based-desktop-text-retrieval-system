   <HEADLINE> U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL RESIGNS POST ; DIPLOMACY : EDWARD DJEREJIAN WILL HEAD NEW PUBLIC POLICY PROGRAM AT BAKER INSTITUTE IN HOUSTON . HE DENIES LEAVING WITH BITTER FEELINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward P . Djerejian announced Thursday that he will leave his post after only eight months to become director of a university institute founded by former Secretary_of_State James A . Baker III . Djerejian , 55 , is one of the most experienced envoys in the foreign service , and his decision to quit surprised Israeli officials . Several American officials in Israel said Djerejian resigned after telling associates he was dissatisfied with the way the United States was handling peace negotiations between Israel and Syria . They said Djerejian was frustrated in recent months by his relatively limited role in Syrian-Israeli peace talks . But Djerejian , reached in Houston , roundly denied those reports . &quot; I ' m doing this for personal and family reasons , &quot; he said . &quot; This is not a resignation in protest . This is a career decision. &quot; He will become the first director of the new Baker Institute for public policy at Rice University in Houston on Aug . 1 . He worked closely with Baker on Middle_East issues during the George_Bush Administration , when Baker was secretary_of_state . &quot; This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity , and timing is something people don ' t control , &quot; he said . &quot; This is exactly the kind of second career I wanted to embark on. &quot; He said he told Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher some months ago of his intention to retire . But Israel ' s government was being formally notified of his decision only today , a senior U.S. official said . Christopher had no immediate public comment . In a written statement released in Houston , Baker called Djerejian &quot; quite simply one of the finest diplomats I know. &quot; Djerejian has told associates that after 33 years in the foreign service -- and with college tuition bills looming for several children -- he was eager to work in the private sector . Despite the ambassador ' s denials , several American officials in Israel said he had been visibly frustrated by his relatively limited role in the Syrian-Israeli talks . They have been handled largely by Christopher and two aides . Djerejian &quot; blew_up &quot; earlier this week when Christopher excluded him from a key meeting with Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , they said . In a telephone_interview , Djerejian did not address the issue of his overall role in the negotiations but dismissed the allegation that he was angry at being left_out of meetings . &quot; that ' s nonsense , &quot; he said . &quot; . . . Ed Djerejian doesn ' t take a walk over something like that. &quot; Before coming_to Israel at the beginning of this year , Djerejian served as assistant secretary_of_state in both the Bush and Clinton_administrations and as ambassador to Syria in the Ronald Reagan_Administration . In the Bush_Administration , he played a major role in the Madrid conference that launched direct Arab-Israeli peace talks as well as the negotiations in Washington that followed . The Baker Institute , which Baker founded last year , is planned as a nonpartisan think_tank with experts on both domestic and foreign affairs . Baker is considering running_for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 and could draw_on the institute for policy advisers -- or , if he were to win the presidency , for top officials . Parks reported from Jerusalem and McManus from Washington . Times staff writer Robin Wright in Washington also contributed to this report . * MAINTAINING MOMENTUM : Israel , PLO step_up negotiations on a final settlement . A19</TEXT>
