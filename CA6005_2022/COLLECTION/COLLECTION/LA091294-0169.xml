   <HEADLINE> LUCKY STORES ' OFFER TURNED_DOWN BY TEAMSTERS ; LABOR : ACTION INCREASES CHANCE OF STRIKE BY THOSE WHO SUPPLY 235 SOUTHLAND SUPERMARKETS . CONTRACT EXPIRES TODAY , AND TALKS CONTINUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Teamsters members Sunday unanimously rejected the latest contract offer by Lucky Stores Inc. , the union reported , increasing the chance of a strike by 1 # 695 workers who warehouse and deliver goods to 235 Lucky supermarkets throughout Southern California . However , at the behest of a federal mediator , both sides continued to meet late Sunday , and Teamsters leaders told their members to report to work as usual today . The contract between Lucky and Teamsters Local 952 expired today at 12:01 a.m. , and union leaders left open the possibility that they could call a strike any time after that . Other possibilities are a boycott of Lucky without a work_stoppage , or an extension of the current contract until a new agreement is reached -- a step usually taken when a settlement appears imminent . But on Sunday , the two sides were still far apart . &quot; There ' s been very , very , very little headway , &quot; Ed Mireles , head of Teamsters Local 952 , said in an interview as hundreds of Lucky workers jammed into the union hall in Orange to cast their votes on the contract offer . &quot; There ' s nothing with substance , &quot; Mireles said of the latest offer , which came_after more_than 20 hours of talks that began Friday afternoon . Judy Decker , a Lucky spokeswoman , said : &quot; There ' s been some movement on the company ' s side , I don ' t know about the union side. &quot; She remained hopeful Sunday afternoon that a settlement could be reached , saying , &quot; They ' re making some progress , that ' s why they ' re talking again. &quot; The Teamsters and Lucky , the No . 2 supermarket chain in the Southland , have not been wrangling over wages and benefits . Rather , the two sides have been deadlocked since the talks started in mid-July over the company ' s ability to move distribution and warehouse work_out of Orange County . For many years , Lucky operated distribution centers in Buena Park , Irvine and Fullerton , whose workers are represented by Teamsters Local 952 , to service all_of Lucky ' s Southern California stores and 20 in Nevada . But earlier this summer , Lucky opened a warehouse in Fontana , and soon after that the company shifted liquor products there from its warehouse in Buena Park . Lucky workers in Fontana are represented by a separate Teamsters local and they make $ 4.60 an hour less than comparable workers in Orange County , whose hourly pay is about $ 16.60. Lucky has said it needs the flexibility to move work among its Southern California warehouses to operate efficiently . But Teamsters Local 952 says the shift in liquor products will cost at least 22 of its members their jobs , and moreover , threatens the long-term job security of its members because Lucky could move additional work to Fontana or other lower-wage warehouses . Neither side disclosed details of Lucky ' s offer that was voted_down on Sunday , but Mireles of the Teamsters said it was_well short of the union ' s goal of obtaining clear language that would preserve jobs for his members . Mireles said other issues were likely to fall_into_place once the dispute over job security was resolved . While there were no signs Sunday of an immediate strike , Lucky workers said they would not hesitate to walk_out . Many of the workers attending the union meeting Sunday pumped their fists in the air and broke_into applause when the Teamsters leaders urged them to reject the latest offer . &quot; If we don ' t take a stand now , we could be gone 10 years from now , &quot; said Don Brewster , a union steward at Lucky ' s warehouse in Irvine . Over the weekend , Teamsters Local 952 ironed_out a separate agreement with Albertson ' s , leaving only Lucky among the major supermarket chains in the region without a settlement . According to the Teamsters , all_of the other big food_chains agreed to the job-security language that the union is seeking from Lucky . Lucky officials said it did not matter what the other companies had agreed to , because each supermarket chain was negotiating a separate contract this year , whereas in the past the major food_companies , as a group , negotiated a single contract with the Teamsters .</TEXT>
