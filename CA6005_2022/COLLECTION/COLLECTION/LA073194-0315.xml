   <HEADLINE> ITALY OFFICIALS UNDERCUT PLAN OF BERLUSCONI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and Umberto Bossi , a key partner in the governing coalition , have thrown cold water on Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi ' s efforts to distance himself from his vast business holdings . Scalfaro said in a statement that while he appreciated Berlusconi ' s plan , constitutional restraints would probably prevent him from helping guarantee its success . He said he would wait to take a stand on Berlusconi ' s proposal until a panel of jurists issued its report . Bossi said the prime_minister ' s plan &quot; didn ' t stand_up &quot; and said his federalist Northern League would draft an alternative . The prime_minister announced Friday that he would submit a bill under which Scalfaro , the two Speakers of Parliament and antitrust authorities would jointly appoint a committee to oversee Berlusconi ' s firm , Fininvest , as long as Berlusconi remained in office .</TEXT>
