   <HEADLINE> AT G-7 MEETING , RUSSIA LOOKS FOR RESPECT , NOT AID ; SUMMIT : YELTSIN IS STILL THE ODD MAN OUT AS RICH COUNTRIES GATHER . BUT HE WILL BE AN EQUAL PARTNER IN POLITICAL MATTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin lands here today with a long-coveted invitation to the World ' s Most Important Countries_Club , marking a new phase_in Russia ' s bumpy rapprochement with the West . For the first time , Yeltsin does not come seeking international aid . Rather , he aims to show the West that Russia , however troubled , is no longer a charity_case . While Yeltsin was not invited to the Group of Seven economic talks that begin today , he will sit as an equal partner at the table Sunday when the world ' s richest democracies discuss political problems ranging from Bosnia-Herzegovina to North_Korea . Yeltsin has attended previous G-7 meetings as a second-class visitor . This year , however , Ukraine is the problem child . Its woes -- especially the $ 1.5 billion in proposed aid to close the Chernobyl nuclear_power plant -- will get top_billing . The symbolism of Yeltsin ' s inclusion is not trivial to Russians . During the hungry and frightening years of 1991 and 1992 , Moscow had to swallow its pride and ask the West for food aid to survive the winter . Even when Yeltsin brought_home pledges of $ 43 billion from the G-7 meeting in Tokyo last July , many of his countrymen felt humiliated by the spectacle of their fallen superpower being reduced to begging crumbs from the table of its rich capitalist rivals . Much of the promised aid never arrived . But Russia survived without it . It has been nine months since tanks rolled through the streets of Moscow to squelch a revolt by hard-line members_of_Parliament , a putsch that almost toppled the Yeltsin presidency . But to everyone ' s amazement , Russia is struggling back onto its feet in an atmosphere of relative economic and political tranquillity . Inflation fell to 6 % in June , down from a peak of 20 % per month last year . That performance bettered even the expectations of U.S. Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , who in February was skeptical that inflation could fall below 9 % by the end of 1994 . Meantime , the Russian budget_deficit yawns -- but not as wide as in some_other European_countries . And even the battered Russian ruble is stabilizing . As for Yeltsin , he now is_on cordial terms with the leaders of the two houses of the new Russian Parliament . Although the public is outraged by the spectacle of mobsters , bankers and bureaucrats getting rich while most workers grow poorer , the strikes and social unrest forecast for this summer have yet to materialize . And despite a business climate that would drive Horatio Alger to despair , Russian entrepreneurs are somehow holding_on . Russians today are far from upbeat about their future . Many are deeply cynical about what they have seen so far of &quot; democracy. &quot; Most are worn_out by the struggle to survive amid the epic chaos of the last five years . Despite its myriad and thorny problems , the Russia that Yeltsin will present to the G-7 today is a tougher , more independent and more self-reliant nation that insists on being treated as an equal political partner with the West . &quot; We ' re not asking_for packages of cheese and sausage , &quot; said Sergei D . Belenkov , a Russian presidential spokesman . Instead , what Russia wants is more trade , more private investment and freer access to world markets that remain closed to its most competitive products . Yeltsin may remind the G-7 of its many unkept aid promises . But he is unlikely to torment his hosts , lest Russia appear as an &quot; ungrateful beggar &quot; or &quot; a bottomless pit &quot; into which money vanishes -- images that officials are eager to dispel . Despite its economic accomplishments , the Yeltsin government still fears that Russia will be treated as a feeble Third_World power , humored by the West only because of its nuclear arsenal and its potential to bully the Baltic_states and the rest of the former Soviet empire . &quot; They are like a grumpy great aunt , &quot; one Western diplomat said . &quot; On the one hand , we don ' t take them seriously . But on the other hand , you can ' t ignore them. &quot; As Russia dismantles its military machine , it seeks membership in Europe ' s key financial , political and security structures to maintain its international clout . Moscow has already joined the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; program . Moscow also dreams of making this session of leading world economies not the G-7 but the G-8 .</TEXT>
