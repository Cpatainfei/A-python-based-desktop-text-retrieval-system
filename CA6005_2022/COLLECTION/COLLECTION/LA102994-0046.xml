   <HEADLINE> MUSIC REVIEW ; AUDUBON QUARTET KICKS OFF GUILD SEASON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles being still a relative yearling as cities go , time takes_on a qualified value . When an arts organization can boast a 50th anniversary , as the Music Guild is doing this season , there is cause for sounded trumpets . The chamber_music series , which started operations at the Wilshire-Ebell Theater in 1944 , began its semi-centennial season there Wednesday with a mostly solid performance by the Audubon String_Quartet . For some unknown reason , a bagpiper commenced the evening with a Celtic processional in the aisles and onstage . Given the festive circumstances , however , the seeming irrelevancies could be excused . As for the official performance , the quartet began a bit roughly with Beethoven ' s String_Quartet in E major , Opus 127 , with ragged intonational edges and uneven ensemble weave . But they hit an impressive stride on Samuel Barber ' s String_Quartet , Opus 11 . An agreeable , mercurial mode of romanticism marks Barber ' s first movement , but the piece will always be known for its elegiac slow section , later orchestrated and immortalized as the popular Adagio for Strings . Despite the theme ' s potential overfamiliarity , when played with the degree of focus and controlled intensity heard here , it remains one of the most touching and saddest tunes_in the West . For the concert ' s second_half , pianist Mona Golabek joined in on an assured reading of Schumann ' s Piano Quintet in E major , Opus 44 . Highlighted by an effectively funereal slow movement and a torrentially scalar Scherzo , it provided the evening an aptly triumphant finale . JOSEF WOODARD</TEXT>
