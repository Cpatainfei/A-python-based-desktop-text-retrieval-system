   <HEADLINE> CONSTRUCTION ; FILLING IN GAPS ON VARIETIES OF HOME INSULATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Modern home insulation works because myriad tiny closed pockets trap air , which acts_as an insulator . Insulation comes_in several forms : batts and blankets that fit between studs and joists , loose fill that is poured or blown in , rigid foam sheets , and liquid foam that is injected into wall cavities . All are rated by their ability to resist heat loss ( R-value ) . The higher the R-value , the more an insulation will prevent heat loss and cut fuel bills . In general , an existing home will benefit most from the addition of batts or loose fill between joists in the attic . This where the most heat is lost , and in an unfinished attic , it ' s a job that the homeowner can do easily for moderate cost . Blowing loose fill or injecting liquid foam into finished walls is a complex process and requires a contractor . Here are some guidelines : * Fiberglass Fluffy fiberglass batts and blankets are by far the most popular insulation and are standard for most new wood-frame houses . They are economical and easy to install . Blankets are long rolls . Batts are simply blankets cut_into 4- or 8-foot lengths . They come_in widths to fit between joists and studs spaced at standard 16- or 24-inch intervals . Thicknesses commonly correspond to stud and joist widths and range from R-11 to R-30 in insulating value . Fiberglass is available with or without a vapor retarder . Install any insulation so the vapor retarder faces the wall ' s heated side , which is the interior side in all but the hottest parts of the Sun Belt . When installing more insulation over existing insulation , use the kind without a vapor retarder so moisture won ' t get trapped between the old and new layers . Fiberglass particles can be harmful . Wear a breathing mask , gloves , a long-sleeve shirt and a hat when handling fiberglass . * Mineral_Wool Mineral_wool is similar to fiberglass . It ' s available in batts and blankets but is most commonly sold in bags as loose fill . It ' s easy to install . In an unfinished attic with no insulation , just lay a sheet of polyethylene plastic as a vapor retarder , pour the fill between joists and spread it with a rake . Loose fill pours easily into cavities that can ' t be reached with other insulations . But it settles in time , particularly in vertical wall cavities , so care must be taken_to install it properly . * Cellulose The advantages of cellulose are its low cost and the ease with which it is blown into otherwise inaccessible areas . Made of recycled paper , it ' s treated by the manufacturer with a fire-retardant chemical . The main disadvantage of cellulose is that it is messy to install . Because it is organic , it ' s also susceptible to moisture retention , which can cause it to shrink and lose its insulation value . * Urethane Foam Urethane foam is a very effective insulator . It is pumped as a liquid into wall cavities , where it solidifies and forms its own vapor retarder . But it is expensive and must be installed by a contractor . It also emits a toxic gas when it burns and has been banned in some states . * Plastic Foam Sheets Three types of rigid plastic foam sheets are commonly used for insulation : * Extruded polystyrene is the best choice for below-grade insulation of exterior walls and floors because it resists moisture . But it ' s costly . * Expanded polystyrene is the least expensive of the three , but it ' s not moisture resistant . It ' s commonly used beneath exterior siding as the core of foam-core panels . * Polyurethane sheets are also used primarily under siding . They give a high R-value per inch but are costly . All three are flammable . If installed indoors , they must be covered with fireproof gypsum wallboard .</TEXT>
