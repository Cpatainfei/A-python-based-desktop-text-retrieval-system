IN CATHOLIC SOUTH_AMERICA , HE ' S MORE POPULAR THAN THE POPE . IT IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT MARADONA IS AS WELL-KNOWN WORLD-WIDE AS MICHAEL JORDAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is the plastic cup they want , the one that just touched the lips of Diego Armando Maradona . &quot; Diego , Diego , the cup ! &quot; the kids scream from the stands of the old soccer stadium . Maradona is taking the first_water break of his first public workout of 1994 , his first_step toward playing the World Cup this summer in the United States . He looks happy today . He signs autographs , smiles for the cameras and jokes with the 300 or so fans that have come_to see him . He takes a drink of water , leans across the stadium moat and softly lofts his Pepsi cup underhand into the waiting arms of a smiling 9-year-old girl named Nadal Gilotti , who then runs_up the stands and sits in a bleacher , mesmerized by the trophy she clutches with both hands . Maradona ' s rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-riches legend has swept_through Asia , Europe , Africa and Australia . In Catholic South_America , he ' s more popular than the Pope . It is no exaggeration to say that Maradona is as well-known world-wide as Michael Jordan . Often tempestuous , sometimes unpredictable and always outspoken , Maradona is nobody ' s example of the ideal sports ambassador . His resume includes a 15-month suspension from the sport and a subsequent arrest for using cocaine . He routinely criticizes his country ' s president and FIFA ( Federation Internationale de Football Assn. ) , soccer ' s international governing body . His penchant for talking_about his friend Fidel Castro has earned him death threats from Cuban Americans in Florida . For the past 15 years , Maradona ' s life has been just about as private as Michael Jordan ' s or Michael Jackson ' s-and like the famous Michaels , at times Maradona seems incapable of avoiding controversy . Last month , for example , reporters shouting questions outside his home were met with a hail of pellets from an air rifle fired from inside his house . Injured reporters filed suit against Maradona and charges are pending . Maradona , without addressing who fired the gun , said the reporters repeatedly refused to stop screaming out questions and they were upsetting his daughters . The following night , he and his family fled their home , hiding in the back of a pickup_truck , only to be discovered days later by two reporters at a secluded seaside resort . Unlike soccer ' s other great legend , the now-retired Pele , Maradona never played in the United States , and until now , he has avoided the English-language media for most of his career . But he agreed to a rare talk a_few days before the air_gun incident over a cup of espresso in a crowded hotel . He did_it , he said , &quot; for the American kids , who really love the sport , even if the adults haven ' t warmed_up to it yet. &quot; Before the interview was over , he had touched_on his unbridled passion for Argentina and the sport that made him famous ; his hopes for the upcoming World Cup , which he said will be his last hurrah ; his regrets over his past drug use , and his love-hate relationship with the United States . &quot; I like Americans , their freedom , the way they live , even though they may_not be as fun-loving as I ' d like them to be , &quot; he said . &quot; And what I don ' t like about the United States is that perhaps they try too hard to dominate the rest of the world and solve everybody ' s problems. &quot; Nobody needs to tell Maradona that soccer is not a major U.S. sport . During a recent vacation in the Dominican_Republic , he came_across a group of families from New York . The kids , he said , immediately recognized him . &quot; They wanted their moms to take their picture with me . A lady in green came_up with a camera and asked me , &quot; Who are you ? ' and I said , &quot; Joe Montana. ' The woman said , &quot; Great , I ' m getting a picture of Joe Montana. ' Her kid turned red ; he was really embarrassed. &quot; Maradona knows U.S. sports fans like lots of scoring-the one thing soccer lacks . So what ' s so great about a 1-0 or 2-1 game ? &quot; Magic Johnson doesn ' t need to score to gain my admiration , &quot; he replies . &quot; Magic wins my admiration with his great no-look passes , even if the ball doesn ' t end_up in the basket . So that ' s the beauty of the game . You don ' t need to score to be creative and entertaining. &quot; A prolific scorer by soccer standards , Maradona is_best known for his all-around game : his precision passes , his dribbles and fakes , his ability to attract a crowd of players and then find the open teammate streaking toward the opponent ' s goal . He is , in sum , the closest thing to a Wayne Gretzky on grass . At 33 , Maradona has lost a_few steps but has adapted by becoming more assist-minded . At 5 feet 5 and about 165 pounds , he most resembles Emmitt Smith or Barry Sanders , and , like the football stars , he exploits his low center_of_gravity and uses quick bursts of speed to avoid defenders ' tackles . Like all_the great ones , he ' s won everything , at every level of the sport-including the 1986 World Cup in Mexico_City , where he delivered what many regard_as the best individual performance in Cup history . Maradona , the son of laborers , grew_up in poverty in the streets of Villa Fiorito , one of Buenos Aires ' roughest neighborhoods . At 10 , he became a minor celebrity when television_cameras discovered him putting_on ball-control exhibitions at halftimes of professional games . For 15 minutes , the ball would touch his feet , knees , chest , head , thighs and heels , but never hit the ground . After his performance , awe-struck crowds would boo the returning professional players . He turned professional at 15 and became an overnight success , making the national team only eight games into the season . Later that year , he suffered his first major disappointment when he was left_out in the final cut of the_Argentine team that went_on to win the 1978 World Cup . Vindication would come a year later when he would lead Argentina to victory in the Junior World Cup in Japan . By then , he was being called &quot; The White Pele. &quot; &quot; Soccer gave me everything , &quot; said Maradona . &quot; It gave me the chance to do what I like , have fun , get paid a lot and make_happy the people I love . Every morning that I get_up , I should light a candle to the soccer ball. &quot; As Maradona spoke , a half-dozen reporters sat a_few tables away , drinking beer and munching green_olives . Another 30 or so hotel guests and local business people sat around the other tables , filling the room . Everybody pretended to ignore the most famous living Argentine . It was a measure of their respect . The interview took_place in the Hotel Riviera Palace , the pride of downtown Rosario , a depressed industrial city of 1 million about 100 miles north of Buenos Aires . Maradona , a multimillionaire , chose to live_in this busy eight-story building with motel-sized rooms during the past soccer season . His wife and two daughters stayed home_in Buenos Aires , where the girls attend school . &quot; At some point I thought_about living_in the United States . I talked_about it with my wife , &quot; Maradona said . He especially liked that the United States is one of the few countries where he ' s not instantly recognized . &quot; But the thing is , I love to be in my country , among my people. &quot; By the time he was 18 , Maradona had won the_Argentine championship , and his transfer to the higher-paid European leagues seemed inevitable . He was sold to the Spanish team Barcelona in 1982 for a then-record $ 8 million , but before he could start playing in Spain , he would have to help defend Argentina ' s world title in World Cup Spain ' 82 . It was not to be Maradona ' s tournament . Distracted by the Falklands War , the_Argentine team went_down quietly in the second round and its star player ' s luster seemed to fade . His two years in Spain were marred by a bout of hepatitis and a fractured ankle that sidelined him for several months . In between , he managed to lead Barcelona to the 1983 Spanish Cup . In 1984 , he was transferred to Napoli of the Italian league , host to the world ' s best-paid soccer players . In his six years there , Maradona turned a perennial loser from one of Italy ' s poorest regions into a dynasty , winning a total of five Italian and European tournaments . For that , he became a hero of the Italian working_class and was rewarded with an endorsement portfolio that rivaled Michael Jordan ' s . But the kid from Villa Fiorito proved to be ill-prepared for life in the fishbowl . Everywhere he went , he was mobbed by fans . Italian newspapers reported rumors that he was taking drugs and was friendly with the Mafia . He was hit with a paternity suit . He partied at discos and gained weight . His play_on the field suffered . Off the field , in the social_event of 1989 in Argentina , he went_home and married his high_school sweetheart , Claudia Villafane , with whom he already had two daughters . But for staging such a lavish gathering-he chartered a plane to bring his friends from Italy and rented a boxing hall for the reception-he was criticized in newspapers all_over the world for his flamboyant ways . As far as Argentines were concerned , all was forgiven when he captained the national team to an unexpected second-place finish in the 1990 World Cup . Maradona considers eliminating host Italy in the semifinals that year the most important day of his career . As he recalled that game at the hotel bar , the skin on his arms broke_out in goose bumps . &quot; Look , &quot; he said , &quot; the allure of your flag is the most beautiful itch you will ever feel . When ( Italian fans ) tore_up our flag in front of the hotel window before the Italy game , I can ' t explain what was going_on inside me. &quot; He paused . He leaned forward , raised his eyebrows , and said in a grave , slow monotone : &quot; I wanted to beat them . I wanted to leave them out of_their_own World Cup. &quot; Nursing a torn muscle ( &quot; I shouldn ' t have even played in that game &quot; ) , Maradona went_on to assist on the game-tying goal and score the game-winning penalty kick . Afterward , he said , he rushed back to the hotel to kiss the new flag that hung from his window . His bitterness toward Italy would grow in the ensuing months . He fought with Napoli team officials . News accounts linked him to a prostitution ring . In 10 years , the bright-eyed extrovert had become a hardened shell . In April 1991 , he tested positive for cocaine after an Italian league game and FIFA slapped him with a world-wide , 15-month suspension . He reached his lowest point a month later when he was arrested in a Buenos Aires apartment after a cocaine binge . It was a Marion Barry-style sting operation , complete with a beautiful female undercover_agent and an army of photographers and television_camera crews recording the moment he was led into a patrol_car handcuffed and glassy-eyed . For weeks , the bust was the biggest story in Argentina . One the day after the sting , President Carlos Menem stripped Maradona of his sports ambassadorship and called him &quot; a sick child. &quot; Looking_back , Maradona seems remorseful when he says , &quot; I ( messed ) up and paid_for it. &quot; But , in the next breath he adds , &quot; I know I was set_up . But you know what ? They did me a great favor because they tried to kill me and instead they put me on the side of the people . The corrupt , the powerful never go_to jail in this country and they never will. &quot; A few days after the arrest , Maradona was freed on bail and he entered a court-ordered drug treatment program , which he completed last year . Through it all , Argentine soccer fans stayed loyal to their idol . Everywhere Argentine teams played , the crowds erupted in a spontaneous chant : &quot; Ole , Ole , Ole Oleeee , Dieeegoo , Dieeegoo ! &quot; When the soccer suspension ended , he signed with the Spanish team Seville . But in an up-and-down season , he only showed flashes of the vintage Maradona . For the most part he looked_like an old , overweight player headed toward retirement . Meanwhile , the_Argentine national team was doing fine without him . After the 1990 World Cup , it went_on a 33-game undefeated streak , a run that included two South_American championships . Nobody seemed to care when Maradona announced his retirement last summer . But then Argentina suffered the most humiliating defeat in its storied history : a 5-0 embarrassment to Colombia in Buenos Aires last September that left the team on the brink of elimination from World Cup ' 94 . &quot; I cried a lot that day-a lot , &quot; recalled Maradona , who watched the game from the stands . &quot; It was like they were touching my flag . My dad came_into my bedroom , my wife , my daughters , and they couldn ' t make me stop crying . I tried to explain to my girls that their father had given blood , ankle , knee , guts , everything to that jersey that had lost 5-0 that day , and that I needed to come back. &quot; Two months after the Colombia disaster , Argentina had to weather a two-game home-and-away series with Australia for the final berth in the World Cup_finals , and Maradona was ready . He had gone_on a diet and lost 30 pounds . To hone his soccer skills , he signed_up with the Rosario-based Newell ' s Old_Boys team of the_Argentine first Division . Maradona ' s debut with Newell ' s last October was a national event , televised live . He was introduced a half hour before the sold-out game , walking onto the spotlighted turf with his two daughters amid thunderous cheers from 35 # 000 fans . When it was over , Maradona had scored the game-winning goal . &quot; Soccer is skin , &quot; said Maradona . &quot; It ' s giving the people that happiness they never get from the government , or from the empty promises politicians have been making_for years . Soccer never lied to the_Argentine . When we couldn ' t win , we didn ' t . And when we did win , we all celebrated together. &quot; Against Australia , Maradona ' s presence on the field seemed enough to kick-start the_Argentine team . The rugged Australians played tough but were overmatched . Argentina qualified . Given his uneven history , Argentine soccer fans were naturally curious about whether Maradona would show_up for his first preseason practice with Newell ' s Jan . 12 after a month-long layoff . Is he in shape ? Are his drug problems behind him ? Are his injuries healed ? Is he ready to lead Argentina to another World Cup victory ? Millions of people wanted to know . that ' s why some two_dozen reporters showed_up . Maradona looked trim , muscular and cleanshaven . His black , curly hair was tightly fashioned in a preppy haircut that exposed his trademark left earring . He wore shorts , a T-shirt and a pair of cheap sneakers . There were no bandages or braces protecting his injury-ravaged body . He jogged without a limp . But Maradona ' s presence at World Cup ' 94 is far from guaranteed . In the latest of his famous mood swings , Maradona quit Newell ' s on the eve of a preseason game . So nobody , not even Maradona , can predict his future . &quot; I ' ll probably retire after the World Cup-if my heart lets me , &quot; he said . &quot; Sometimes it ' s hard to give it all up . After the Australia game , I wanted to be the last guy to leave the stadium . I wanted to turn_off the lights and walk_out with the last fan. &quot; After hanging_up his cleats , Maradona said he hopes to someday coach the national team , but for the most part he would like to teach soccer to the_Argentine children . &quot; I ' d like to start a university to teach kids the game-without stealing from them . Not like some washed_up player who retires without a penny and then tells kids , &quot; Give me a_thousand dollars and I ' ll teach you to play just like me. ' There are certain things you can ' t teach . I ' ll just say come_on over and play . Come and play and I won ' t steal from you. &quot;</TEXT>
