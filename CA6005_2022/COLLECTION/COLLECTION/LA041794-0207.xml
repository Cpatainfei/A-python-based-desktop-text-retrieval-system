   <HEADLINE> SECRECY LAW UNDER FIRE FOR HIDING BABY ' S AIDS INFECTION FROM MOTHER ; HEALTH : A NEW YORK LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TO &quot; UNBLIND &quot; NEONATAL TESTS HAS BECOME THE SUBJECT OF A FIERCE FIGHT . THE DEBATE TRANSCENDS POLITICAL LINES AND EVEN DIVIDES DOCTORS WHO TREAT THE DISEASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In four years of a troubled life , Andrew Von Graevenitz has undergone stomach surgery , had a brain-damaging seizure and -- by his foster_mother ' s count -- suffered 23 bouts of pneumonia . What angers Carol Von Graevenitz is that some of Andrew ' s health_problems could have been prevented if she had only known sooner about his disease . She suspected Andy ' s early illnesses were caused by AIDS , but had to fight the bureaucracy to have him tested when he was 10 months old . Andy had already been tested for the AIDS virus -- on the day he was born . But state law kept those results secret from everyone , including his mother and his doctors . A New York legislative proposal to &quot; unblind &quot; those tests has become the subject of a fierce fight in the state , which has 27 % of the nation ' s pediatric AIDS cases . The debate has transcended traditional political lines and even divided doctors who treat the disease . On one side is the state Health Department , AIDS activists and some doctors who argue that the bill would breach the strict law that guarantees AIDS tests be kept confidential . They say rapid advances in what is known about pediatric AIDS have already made the new proposal obsolete . Supporters say it is common_sense that mothers want to know whether their children could develop AIDS . They say it doesn ' t make_sense to withhold this information when there is a chance to prolong lives or make them more comfortable . &quot; As a parent , I ' m very angry because my child was made to suffer because of confidentiality , &quot; Von Graevenitz said . Health officials wanted to better trace the progression of AIDS when they started the tests in 1987 . The test is performed on all babies born in the state . Similar screening is conducted in 43 other states , although often on a much more limited basis , according to the state Health Department . Shortly after birth , a baby ' s heel is pricked for a blood sample used to test for a variety of diseases . After the tests are complete , the sample is stripped of all identifying information -- except for the hospital name and the mother ' s age and racial background -- and sent to the state ' s AIDS laboratory for an HIV test , said Health Department spokeswoman Frances Tarlton . Through the end of 1992 , the HIV test had been conducted on 1 # 446 , 680 New York newborns . There were 9 # 259 positive results , she said . A positive test does not mean a baby will develop AIDS . In fact , 75 % of newborns testing positive do not develop the deadly disease . The HIV antibody , which is what the test measures , eventually washes_out of the baby ' s bloodstream , she said . The test does prove , however , that the baby ' s mother is HIV-positive . Nettie Mayersohn , a Democratic state Assembly member from Queens who describes herself as a &quot; flaming liberal , &quot; said she was astounded to discover the state conducts this survey but does nothing with the information when a baby has tested positive . She proposed the bill that would require the state to track HIV-tested newborns and tell mothers when the tests are positive . The chance to help babies justifies this intrusion on a mother ' s privacy , Mayersohn said . This stance has made the legislator , once honored by the National Organization for Women as the top New York legislator , a target of groups she usually considers friends . &quot; Frankly , I am outraged that the opposition dares to present itself as defending the interests of women , &quot; Mayersohn said . &quot; Nothing could be further from the truth. &quot; Knowing that a baby is HIV-positive would change the way the child is treated almost from birth , said Dr. Louis Cooper , chief of pediatrics at St . Luke ' s-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City . Cooper said he would use drugs to ward_off pneumonia , one of the most common sicknesses for babies with AIDS . A doctor might ask to see an HIV-positive baby immediately if the mother complains the baby has the sniffles , while for another child a simple aspirin would be recommended . Proponents also say it is possible for the virus to pass_through a baby ' s system through the normal course of events and for the child be re-infected through nursing . There ' s never a good time to tell a woman that she is HIV-positive , but telling her at_the_same_time her baby is_sick is about the worst , Cooper acknowledged . Cooper supports Mayersohn ' s legislation , but that puts him at_odds with many of his colleagues . Even Judith Figuera , who manages the Program for Children and Families at St . Luke ' s-Roosevelt and works for Cooper , has been outspoken in opposing the bill . &quot; In regards_to AIDS , some people are responding in a kind of a panic , &quot; said Sharon Fawley , president of the state ' s NOW chapter . An expert panel appointed by state Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Chassin to wrestle with the question concluded that the newborn test should remain confidential . But it recommended that all pregnant women and new mothers be encouraged to take an HIV test and be counseled about it . Another bill before the Legislature would require doctors to advise their pregnant patients to take an HIV test and would spend $ 8 million on counseling . The legislation , sponsored by Assembly Health Committee Chairman Richard Gottfried , is a signal that Mayersohn ' s bill has an uphill fight to make_it into law . Gottfried believes there would be more people driven_away from the health_care system by Mayersohn ' s bill than babies helped . The opponents of Mayersohn ' s bill also note a National Institute of Health report in February saying the drug AZT , if given to pregnant women , can significantly reduce the risk of the virus being passed_on to the baby . &quot; It makes_it clear that postpartum testing is about six months too late , &quot; Gottfried said .</TEXT>
