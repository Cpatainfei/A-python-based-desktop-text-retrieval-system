   <TEXT> D . L . Menard , &quot; the Cajun Hank Williams , &quot; will headline the 1994 Southern California Cajun &amp; Zydeco Festival June 4-5 at the Rainbow Lagoon , next to the Long_Beach Convention Center . Menard and his band , the Louisiana Aces , top a six-act lineup that includes Walter Mouton &amp; the Scott Playboys who , according to the festival promoter , have played only one Saturday night concert outside their hometown of Scott , La. , since the ' 50s . Also from Louisiana , accordionist Steve Riley &amp; the Mamou Playboys and Nathan &amp; the Zydeco Cha-Chas will be making return appearances . The Poullard Brothers , from Texas , and Joe Simien , a Los Angeles transplant , round_out the bill . Promoter Franklin Zawacki said he is going_ahead with the eighth annual festival even though he lost about $ 40 # 000 last year because of heavy rain and competition from a Troubadours of Folk festival held at UCLA the same weekend . While the odds are against a repeat of last year ' s unseasonable downpour , the Cajun &amp; Zydeco festival will again coincide with the other festival , which has been renamed &quot; Troubadours of Music and Crafts Festival. &quot; Troubadour fest promoter Jim Rissmiller said he decided against changing the dates of his festival because he wants to establish it in fans ' minds . In addition to the music , the Cajun &amp; Zydeco festival will feature food booths from area restaurants plus dance , music and cultural workshops from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. each day . Ticket prices have not been announced . Information is available from Comprehensive Child Development in Long_Beach , which helps organize various events and receives some proceeds from the festival : ( 310 ) 427-3713 . RANDY LEWIS</TEXT>
