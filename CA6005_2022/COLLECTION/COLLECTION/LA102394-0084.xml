   <TEXT> Re &quot; A Dream Denied &quot; by Lynn Smith ( Oct . 12 ) : All right . That does_it . I am so tired_of receiving messages , via all forms of media , that women are going_to end_up miserable and -- God forbid -- unfulfilled , if they don ' t have children . I ' m tired_of hearing and reading that the feminist_movement is to blame for all_the problems of the world and all_the choices with which women now find themselves unsatisfied . I am tired_of that meaningless term family values . I am tired_of the word family being used in commercials , where the word people has always been perfectly fine . &quot; More and more families are drinking Tropicana orange juice. &quot; Excuse me , I drink Tropicana orange_juice ; don ' t I count ? I ' m tired_of all_the insurance ads being aimed at people with babies , as if that is the only demographic group that matters . I ' m sorry that so many women feel bereft that they are now too old to conceive . Hello ! Does the word adopt mean anything to you ? I have been called selfish for not wanting children , but guess what ? Wanting children is just as selfish , if not more . Smith writes_of people spending upward of $ 100 # 000 with fertility clinics . Now , that ' s selfish . CAT POLLON Studio City * Yes , infertility is a source of great grief ; the biological urge to reproduce is strong . But reproducing and parenting are two very different things , as evidenced by the previously infertile mother who realized she hated being home all_the time : &quot; Her restlessness was . . . a function of her oldest child ' s overactive personality . So she went_back to school and got a job. &quot; And did what with the child ? Many children in this heavily populated world are abandoned . Growing_up without parents is far more tragic than the painful inability to conceive . BARBARA NICHOLS Los Angeles * In Lynn Smith ' s story about motherhood , there was no examination of the role business and its white male leaders played in the necessary decision for women now in their 40s and 50s to delay motherhood . The white male Establishment decreed that we had to make a choice . They decreed this by not providing on-site child_care , not permitting maternity leave and a return to our jobs , and not allowing flexible work schedules . We did not give_up children just to redress our mothers ' lives . We had no other choice . If women were in_charge , we ' d have it all because we know how to do_it . Men don ' t .
