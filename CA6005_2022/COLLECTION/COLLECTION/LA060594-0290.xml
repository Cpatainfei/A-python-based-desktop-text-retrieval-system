   <HEADLINE> VIRGINIA GOP PICKS NORTH AS SENATE NOMINEE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Oliver L . North , the ramrod Marine who emerged from the Iran-Contra scandal as a conservative icon , won the Virginia Republican Senate nomination Saturday . His victory virtually ensured an unpredictable four-way contest for the seat now held by embattled Democrat Charles S . Robb . At a tense and emotional party convention here , North comfortably defeated fellow conservative James C . Miller III , who had centered his campaign on the argument that North could not win in the general_election . North carried 55 % of the delegates ' votes , to 45 % for Miller , the former director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan . &quot; Bring on the liberal elites : ( President ) Clinton , Congress , ( Ted ) Koppel and above all Chuck ( Robb ) , &quot; North declared exuberantly in a speech just before the vote . &quot; It ' s time to take a stand : Whose side are you on ? &quot; In selecting North -- an intense , charismatic former lieutenant_colonel who drew both renown and disdain for his combative 1987 testimony to a congressional committee investigating the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scandal -- the state party ensured a public split with its top-ranking federal_official . Republican Sen . John W . Warner has condemned North as unfit to serve in the Senate and said he will back an independent candidacy by Republican J . Marshall Coleman , a former state_attorney general . Although Coleman has not declared his candidacy , he seems certain to run now that North has been nominated . North ' s victory also makes virtually certain a second independent candidacy from former Democratic Gov . L . Douglas Wilder , who contends his archrival , Robb , is so politically weakened that he cannot retain the Senate seat for the Democrats in November . At the convention , North ' s strength was greatest in the southern part of the state . He ran particularly well among rural voters and evangelical Christians , who responded enthusiastically to his Reaganesque appeals_to family values and populist attacks on Washington . In a pre-vote speech barely 10 minutes long , North never diverged from those themes . As if squeezing rounds from a rifle , he blasted away at the &quot; imperial Congress &quot; with its &quot; precious parking places and gilded goodies , &quot; the &quot; bloated bureaucracy , &quot; the &quot; Washington crowd , &quot; the &quot; professional politicians &quot; and the &quot; ranting and raving powerbrokers. &quot; His brief references_to policy centered_on the conservative agenda for restraining government -- the balanced_budget amendment , the line-item veto and term limits -- as well as opposition to abortion . In remarks after the vote , North reprised those arguments in even more barbed tones : &quot; Virginians are_sick and tired_of a Congress run_by back-slapping good ol ' boys -- and a White_House governed by a bunch of 20-something kids with an earring and an ax to grind. &quot; North , a former National Security_Council aide , has acknowledged misleading Congress during the Iran-Contra affair , in which the Reagan_Administration traded arms to Iran for the release of U.S. hostages in Beirut and used part of the proceeds to finance the Nicaraguan Contras . In proceedings brought by special prosecutor Lawrence E . Walsh , North was convicted of obstructing Congress , shredding government documents and accepting an illegal gift of a home security_system . But his convictions were overturned in 1990 by a federal appeals court , which ruled that North ' s trial was tainted by testimony he gave to Congress while under a guarantee of immunity from prosecution . In the aftermath , North quickly built a national following in conservative circles through speeches and extensive direct mail appeals for a foundation and political_action_committee he established . Although Miller and North differed little on issues , the race polarized their supporters . At receptions , in hallways , waiting_on line for credentials , the nearly 15 # 000 delegates here regularly combusted into spontaneous debates that inevitably turned_on the same questions : Could North win a general_election ? Would Miller send to Washington the same stick-in-the-eye message as North ? Outside a party banquet Friday night , Robert Dunn , an engineer from the Richmond suburbs , was explaining why he supported North when Mark Roseneker , a Miller supporter from northern Virginia , challenged him . &quot; Why gamble for ideology when you can win the election , &quot; Roseneker asked Dunn . &quot; We are talking_about a candidate ( North ) who reflects poorly on the Republican Party. &quot; Dunn replied : &quot; I believe Oliver North can articulate the issues better , motivate the people better , give them a better direction . I believe we need somebody who can really send a message very clearly -- not muddled like it has been for so long. &quot; As that exchange suggested , the race was less a choice between Miller and North than a referendum on North himself . To his supporters , North stands as &quot; an American hero , &quot; as William Luchsinger , a Vietnam_War veteran and delegate from Arlington put it . &quot; If I had to go_to_war again , I ' d want an Oliver North in front of me and an Oliver North behind me , &quot; he said . But even in this ardently Republican , overwhelmingly conservative audience , there were many who viewed North as untrustworthy and undependable -- a sentiment encapsulated in a button worn by Miller supporters : &quot; Ollie , thou shalt not lie. &quot; In the weeks leading_up to the vote , North had endured a steady barrage of criticism from fellow conservatives and former colleagues , ranging from Reagan to former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff Colin L . Powell , who had raised questions about the former Marine ' s character and veracity . In remarks after the vote Saturday , Miller urged Republicans to unite behind North . But party leaders are concerned about defections from Miller supporters like Susan Miller ( no relation ) of Bedford , who slapped down a North flyer moments after the vote . &quot; I cannot support a man that Colin Powell can ' t support and Gen . ( H . Norman ) Schwarzkopf can ' t support , &quot; she said . The Democrats will select their nominee in a June 14 primary . Robb , who has been battered by allegations of marital infidelity , faces conservative state Sen . Virgil H . Goode Jr. ; Richmond lawyer Sylvia Clute , and Nancy Spannaus , a supporter of political extremist Lyndon H . LaRouche Jr . Polls have shown Robb with a substantial lead , but Goode has been pounding Robb with mailings and television advertisements citing memos from the senator ' s own staff detailing allegations that he had committed adultery ; Goode ' s television ads accuse Robb of associating with &quot; prostitutes and drug criminals. &quot; &quot; If it were head to head , there ' s a decent shot Robb could lose_it , &quot; said Democratic pollster Alan Secrest , who is not affiliated with any candidate . &quot; But I don ' t see how it will happen with two opponents . . . splitting the vote. &quot; The rest of the field will also fill_in by then : Wilder and Coleman have until 7 p.m. on June 14 , when the polls close_in the Democratic primary , to file the relatively modest 15 # 000 signatures needed to launch an independent campaign . Immediately after North ' s nomination , a committee to draft Coleman announced that it had collected enough signatures to place him on the November ballot . If the four-way race materializes , Virginia voters will face a choice with more angles than Fenway Park . Keeping track of the grudges alone is a formidable task . Robb and Wilder have a longstanding feud ; Coleman lost the 1981 gubernatorial race to Robb , and a second round to Wilder in 1989 . The religious conservatives fervent for North still bristle_at Coleman for abandoning his opposition to abortion in the 1989 race . The political calculations are equally intricate . Paradoxically , the proliferation of candidates may help all_of the contenders -- each of whom , for different reasons , would likely have difficulty attracting an absolute_majority of votes . In a race with four candidates , though , the winner may need only about 40 % of the vote -- a prospect that helps the candidate with the strongest base of committed supporters . North has such a base among evangelical Christians and other ideological conservatives . Wilder ' s base is among African Americans , who constitute between 15 % to 20 % of the statewide vote_in a general_election . Robb has already won endorsements from the institutional ligaments of the Democratic Party -- organized labor , the teachers union , and abortion-rights groups . To the extent Coleman can match such assets , it will be through what is expected to be the vigorous support of Warner , who remains popular in the state . At the convention , the state party passed a resolution urging Warner to reconsider his decision to oppose North ' s candidacy . No public polls have yet tested support in a four-way race , but an adviser to one of the candidates said he believed that each would begin such a contest with backing from between 20 % and 30 % of the electorate . In Republican circles , the initial estimation is that the race would come_down to North and Wilder , with Robb and Coleman fading . But at this point all predictions are a stab in the dark . &quot; This is the most complicated race I ' ve ever come_across , &quot; said Larry J . Sabato , a political_scientist at the University of Virginia . Times staff writer Jeff Leeds contributed to this story .</TEXT>
