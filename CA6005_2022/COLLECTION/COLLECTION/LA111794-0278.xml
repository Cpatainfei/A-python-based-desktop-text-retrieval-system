   <HEADLINE> FOCUS IS SHIFTING BACK TO PACKWOOD PROBE ; ETHICS : AFTER LONG DELAY , SENATE INVESTIGATORS ARE SAID TO BE GETTING KEY EVIDENCE IN SEXUAL MISCONDUCT CASE . PERSONAL DIARIES ARE BEING STUDIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Senate Ethics Committee ' s long-quiet investigation of sexual_harassment allegations and other charges against Sen . Bob Packwood is reawakening even as the Oregon Republican stands on the threshold of new influence on Capitol_Hill . After months of delay because of Packwood ' s legal challenges , committee investigators finally have started to receive &quot; a good bit &quot; of the critical evidence that they have been seeking : abridged versions of Packwood ' s personal diaries , according to a source close to the case . By agreement of both sides in the dispute , former federal Judge Kenneth W . Starr , who now is looking_into President Clinton ' s role in an Ozarks land deal as Whitewater independent counsel , has spent months screening the diaries , tape cassettes that Packwood dictated at the end of each day . The committee has subpoenaed Packwood ' s diaries from late 1989 through most of last year . Starr ' s task , which the source said is nearly complete , has been to review tape portions that Packwood ' s lawyers claim should be withheld from the committee on grounds that they are private family topics or matters involving attorney-client and physician-patient confidentiality . Starr is then to provide appropriate material to Senate investigators . &quot; He has turned_over a good bit of material to the committee , &quot; the source said . Victor Baird , the panel ' s chief counsel , declined to confirm the source ' s statement . He said only that &quot; during the remainder of this year &quot; the committee will review all tapes that are turned_over in hopes of preparing a preliminary report for its members soon after Congress convenes in January . The committee also hopes to resume questioning Packwood under oath by the end of 1994 , Baird said . That closed-door questioning was suspended last year pending the outcome of the dispute over Packwood ' s diaries . Packwood filed a series of court challenges to Senate subpoenas for the tape-recorded diaries and related transcripts , starting a months-long legal battle that ended last March when Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist upheld lower court rulings that the diaries must be surrendered . Sen . Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) , who is scheduled to become chairman of the Ethics Committee in January , and other leading Republican senators said that no effort would be made to prevent Packwood from assuming the chairmanship of the Finance_Committee , on which he is now ranking GOP member . As chairman , Packwood would play a major role in any legislation dealing with health_care , welfare reform or taxes . McConnell explained through a spokesperson that forcing Packwood to forgo the chairmanship until the ethics inquiry is complete &quot; would be contrary to the past practice of the Senate , &quot; where majority party members with seniority traditionally head committees . Starr ' s appointment in the case , approved by the federal_court last spring , preceded his being named last August to direct the unrelated , independent investigation into the investment in Whitewater Development Corp . of the President and his wife , First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , while Clinton was governor of Arkansas . During the 20-months-long ethics investigation , about 30 women have accused Packwood of making unwanted sexual advances , including some who claimed that he touched or kissed them against their will . Several were Senate employees . There has been speculation that Packwood ' s diaries may shed the most light on related matters that the ethics panel is examining , including his alleged efforts to intimidate and discredit his accusers . In addition , the diaries are considered crucial in the panel ' s investigation of job offers that businessmen and lobbyists allegedly made to the senator ' s estranged wife while the Packwoods were going_through a divorce and while his alimony payments were being determined . Another central issue is whether the senator tampered with the diary tapes after learning last year that a subpoena from the committee was imminent . Indications of tampering came from a former secretary of Packwood ' s who had transcribed his tapes for many years . The former employee told committee investigators last year that some tapes and transcripts being sought in the case had been altered . Altering subpoenaed material , if provable , could open Packwood to the possibility of criminal prosecution by the Justice_Department for obstruction of justice . In defending Packwood ' s right to a chairmanship , McConnell and Sen . Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , who is expected to become majority_leader in the new Congress , both noted that Democratic Sens . Donald W . Riegle Jr . of Michigan and John_Glenn of Ohio were permitted to keep their chairmanships of the Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs and Governmental Affairs committees , respectively , during the Ethics Committee ' s 1991 investigation of their relationship with Charles H . Keating Jr. , a savings and loan owner since jailed for defrauding investors . In that case , after months of public hearings , the ethics panel severely chastised Riegle and Sen . Dennis DeConcini ( D-Ariz. ) and mildly criticized Glenn and Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) -- all on grounds that they had accepted political contributions from Keating while intervening in a federal bank board investigation of his firm , Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn . Former Sen . Alan Cranston ( D-Calif. ) received a harsh reprimand in the same case . Sen . William V . Roth Jr . ( R-Del. ) , a veteran member of the Finance_Committee , said that he , too , will support Packwood ' s elevation to the chairmanship . Roth said that he sees no move by Republicans to block Packwood ' s ascendancy .</TEXT>
