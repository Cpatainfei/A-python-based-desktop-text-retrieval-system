   <HEADLINE> DELAYS ON CLEAN CARS ASSAILED ; ELECTRIC VEHICLES : THE FIGHT IS OVER HOW BEST TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND CUT DENSE SMOG THAT HAS HOVERED OVER THE NORTHEAST FOR YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eleven months after President Clinton unveiled a partnership with auto_makers to develop a cleaner car , the Administration is being accused of undercutting promotion of electric vehicles . The controversy stems from a bitter dispute between the car_manufacturers and state environmental officials from Virginia to Maine . The fight is over the issue of how best to reduce vehicle emissions and cut smog that hovered over the Northeast for years . While the Environmental Protection Agency insists it is merely trying to fashion a plan acceptable to all sides , some state regulators and environmentalists accuse it of catering to the auto_makers . In a sharply written letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner , the top environmental official in California recently accused the agency of working to reverse state-level development of clean-air programs like California ' s . &quot; EPA should stick_to the adoption of the best air_pollution prevention measures , not convene clandestine negotiations to broker weaker ones , &quot; wrote James Strock , California ' s secretary for environmental protection . This happened after reports surfaced that EPA officials had been trying to broker a clean air deal for the Northeast . A dozen Northeast states and the District_of_Columbia want to emulate the California plan . That plan would require the manufacture and sale of thousands of electric vehicles as well as &quot; ultra-low &quot; emission cars that run_on natural_gas . This has raised the ire of the automobile_industry , which has proposed its own plan to meet clean air requirements in the Northeast . It claims that emission reductions from vehicles can be met without having to sell electric_cars in the region . The manufacturers have sought_out the White_House and EPA to try to persuade the Northeastern states to go_along with their proposal . Next to Southern California , the Northeast has some of the worst smog problems in America . Under provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act , state officials must craft a blueprint for meeting air quality health standards early in the next decade . That requires car emissions to be cut roughly in half . Two states , Massachusetts and New York , already have passed laws fashioned on the California standard . Like California , Massachusetts and New York require that 2 % of all new car sales by model year 1999 be electric vehicles . Under a coalition called the Ozone Transport Commission , all_the Northeast states have proposed a solution similar to the one in California and are awaiting EPA approval . It includes a requirement for electric_cars , although actual sales mandates would be up_to each state . The auto_makers strongly oppose any requirement to sell electric_cars and have filed lawsuits in New York and Massachusetts against the state mandates . They argue that an acceptable electric_car with the range and size demanded by the public won ' t be possible for some time at competitive prices . &quot; Mandating the sale of cars that don ' t get bought or , if bought , don ' t get driven very much , does nothing for air quality . that ' s the real_world , &quot; argued Helen Petrauskas , vice_president for environmental and safety engineering at Ford Motor Co . Instead , said Andrew Card , president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn. , which has spearheaded the Washington lobbying effort against the Northeast states , the EPA should adopt &quot; a 49-state approach &quot; to deal with air_pollution . He said the auto_makers are prepared to produce and sell a cleaner gasoline-powered car for all states . The theory is that by selling cleaner-burning cars across the country , the smog-bound Northeast also would benefit because 10 % to 15 % of the driving in the Northeast is done_in cars from outside the region . In turn , auto_makers would not have to produce electric or &quot; ultra-clean &quot; natural_gas powered vehicles for areas outside of California . But state officials who have crafted the Northeast pollution control plan say the auto_makers ' proposal won ' t allow them to meet the pollution reduction requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act and only forces them to impose tougher pollution controls elsewhere -- on businesses , factories or even lawn_mowers . &quot; You don ' t get the same emission reductions ( from the auto industry proposal ) . . . . It ' s not sufficient , period , &quot; said Bruce Carhart , executive_director of the Ozone Transport Commission , the regional agency created to develop the pollution control plan for the states from Virginia to Maine . The regional plan envisioned cutting auto emissions in half by 2003 . These include nitrogen_oxide and volatile organic_compounds , both of which contribute to smog . Carhart said the auto industry plan would fall 15 % to 30 % short of that . And , he argued in an interview , there ' s no assurance anyone could enforce a &quot; 49-state &quot; clean car requirement since the federal air_pollution control laws are less stringent than what the auto_makers are offering . Congress intended for states , with federal approval , to impose more stringent requirements . In a letter to President Clinton , the governors of Vermont , New York and Massachusetts recently urged the President to ask the EPA to stop negotiating with the auto_makers and to adopt the Northeast states ' proposals . The governors reminded Clinton of his initiative last September in which the auto_makers promised at a White_House ceremony a new long-range partnership for developing a cleaner car . EPA officials deny charges they are undercutting electric_car development , but say they are only trying to find ways to get the auto_makers and Northeast states to agree on a program that will put cleaner cars on_the_road sooner . Browner ' s assistant for air_pollution programs , Mary Nichols , said the agency ' s involvement has been misunderstood by some state regulators and that the agency has no intention of retreating on any air quality goals . &quot; We would not entertain a compromise that would achieve less environmental benefits than what ( the Northeast states ) asked us for , &quot; Nichols said . &quot; The emission reductions . . . are not negotiable . The only issue is , are there alternative ways to get there ? &quot; While saying that electric vehicles &quot; are part of our future , &quot; Nichols also has urged the disagreeing parties to discuss other approaches including the auto industry ' s 49-state clean car proposal .</TEXT>
