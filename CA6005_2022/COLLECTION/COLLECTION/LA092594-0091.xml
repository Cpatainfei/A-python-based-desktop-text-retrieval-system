   <HEADLINE> COLOR KIDS SCARED : SEXUAL-ABUSE TRAINING_PROGRAMS RAISE QUESTIONS ; EDUCATION : PROGRAMS RANGE FROM COLORING BOOKS WARNING THAT MOST ANYONE COULD BE AN ABUSER TO CLASSES . CRITICS FEAR EFFORT COULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A coloring book asks , &quot; Who COULD be a child_molester ? &quot; and then answers with pictures of nearly everyone in a child ' s life : a priest , coach , policeman , teacher , Mom , Dad . A preschool curriculum instructs teachers to hold_up a drawing of a girl sitting in her uncle ' s lap and ask , &quot; What if Donna ' s uncle put his hand_down Donna ' s pants ? Would that be OK ? &quot; So_much for childhood innocence . Between their ABCs and recess , schoolchildren now must ponder a darker world . Sexual-abuse prevention programs for children have gained wide acceptance since they first appeared in the early 1980s , now reaching an estimated two-thirds of all U.S. children . Trouble is , nobody knows if the programs really work , and some researchers say they may do more harm than good . Critics say the programs have not been proved effective in preventing abuse and may confuse youngsters , possibly twisting their sexual development in later years . Even some advocates of prevention efforts say many programs are misguided , outdated and ineffective . &quot; These programs have been experimenting with kids since they started , &quot; said Neil Gilbert , professor of social_welfare at UC Berkeley and co-author of the book , &quot; With the Best of Intentions : The Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Movement. &quot; Gilbert challenges the ideology behind many prevention programs , saying they wrongly borrow from feminist principles in assuming young children can be &quot; empowered &quot; to fend_off sexual predators . In reality , he said , children are no match for adult abusers , physically or mentally . &quot; I think adults ought to be responsible_for protecting kids , &quot; Gilbert said . &quot; We shouldn ' t be saying , especially to young kids , ' It ' s on your shoulder. ' &quot; Studies he conducted in California found that preschoolers and first-graders could not grasp some concepts presented in abuse-prevention programs . Many could not distinguish between good and bad touching , and training appeared to increase the number of first-graders who thought that any kind of touching was wrong . The programs also may have unintended consequences down the road , Gilbert said . &quot; We don ' t know the long-term effects of introducing children to the notion that sexuality is bad and dangerous , &quot; he said . &quot; When they have their first sexual experience , we don ' t know if this will come floating back into their minds. &quot; Any assessment of prevention efforts is complicated by the hundreds of different programs in_use , ranging from 20-minute puppet_shows to two-month courses . All try to teach children to recognize sexual abuse , to say no , and to tell an adult . But the similarities end there . Some schools use methods discarded years ago by experts , said Joan Cole Duffell , community education director for the Seattle-based Committee for Children . Other schools , strapped for funds , turn_to local advocacy groups that do the training cheaply but may have little knowledge of child development . &quot; I fear them , &quot; Duffell said . &quot; They ' re really not prepared to know what kids are ready for at this age , and they don ' t know how to teach them. &quot; Duffell ' s nonprofit organization markets &quot; Talking About Touching , &quot; a six- to eight-week curriculum considered one of the nation ' s most comprehensive . It reaches 300 # 000 preschool and elementary schoolchildren a year , she said . Although Duffell believes abuse-prevention training is worthwhile if done right , she said it is often done wrong . &quot; Many of these programs should be looked_at in a critical light , &quot; she said . &quot; Anybody who ' s going_to do a one-shot program with 5-year-olds about ' the uh-oh feeling when someone touches you ' is only going_to leave them confused. &quot; A child ' s age also matters , she said . Many preschool programs start with 3-year-olds , figuring that if a child is old enough to be abused , he or she is old enough to learn about abuse . But Duffell ' s group recommends waiting until children turn 4 . &quot; Knowing what we know about learning and developmental issues , there really is no healthy point in telling a 3-year-old about sexual abuse , &quot; Duffell said . &quot; They ' ll become confused , and the most you can hope for is that you ' ll scare them. &quot; The first nationwide study of prevention programs , released last fall , yielded a mixed bag of findings . The University of New Hampshire ' s Family Research Laboratory conducted telephone_interviews with a national sample of 2 # 000 children ages 10 to 16 . While 67 % of the children said they had received abuse-prevention training , only 34 % had been exposed to what the researchers considered high-quality , comprehensive programs . A comprehensive program was defined as one with at least nine of 12 components , such_as involving parents , having more_than one class , letting children practice prevention skills , and exploring abuse by family members , not just strangers . On the positive side , the study found that children with comprehensive training were more likely to tell someone after being sexually abused . They also were more likely to use preferred strategies such_as yelling , demanding to be left alone , or threatening to tell . &quot; Overall , I take it to be encouraging , &quot; said David Finkelhor , the study ' s lead investigator . &quot; What ' s important about this study is that it ' s the first to suggest that exposure to these programs may be able to affect what children do_in these victimization encounters. &quot; But the study supplied critics with ammunition , too . Children appeared to receive little benefit from the brief , less comprehensive programs , actually scoring slightly lower on a knowledge test than children with no training at all . Even the children with comprehensive training , while scoring better for knowledge , were no more likely to stop an attempted abuse from being carried_out . And in what Finkelhor conceded was &quot; a troubling finding , &quot; children with comprehensive training were more likely to be injured during abuse , possibly because they were more prone to fight_back . Given the uncertainties , Gilbert believes money spent on programs aimed at young children might be_better spent instructing parents and teachers to be more vigilant . But Finkelhor believes the programs should be improved , not scrapped . Any negative effects , such_as scaring children , appear to be relatively mild , he said . &quot; Contrast it with the general fare of violence they get_on TV , &quot; Finkelhor said . &quot; Most of that seems more threatening and scary than this information. &quot; Duffell considers abuse-prevention training a necessary evil . &quot; It ' s too_bad we have to do_it , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s a trade-off that many parents and teachers are willing to live with , because they don ' t want the consequences of their children being abused. &quot; But there ' s a limit to what any school program can do , Duffell said . One of the strongest findings in Finkelhor ' s study was the benefit of parental involvement . Although school programs did not increase the likelihood that a child would thwart an attempted assault , parental instruction did . One of the greatest benefits of school programs appears to be the discussion they can stimulate at_home , the study concluded . &quot; Some parents say , ' Oh , my kid got personal safety this week at school , so I don ' t have to worry anymore , ' &quot; Duffell said . &quot; In reality , parents have to be constantly worried about it . They need to work_on good communication with their children . They need to be concerned about where their children are at all times . If you put all your eggs in the basket of teaching kids what to do_in the event of a sexual_assault , you ' re not going_to solve the problem. &quot;</TEXT>
