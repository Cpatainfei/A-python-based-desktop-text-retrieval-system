   <HEADLINE> FEINSTEIN ' S TV ATTACK ON IMMIGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Democratic U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein has been airing a new television commercial about immigration and her support for tougher enforcement on the international border . The ad , which is being broadcast statewide , also contrasts Feinstein ' s position with her Republican challenger for the Senate seat , Rep . Michael Huffington ( R-Santa Barbara ) . THE AD It opens with a statement : &quot; While Congressman Huffington voted against new border guards , Dianne Feinstein led the fight to stop illegal immigration. &quot; A picture of presumably illegal immigrants streaming over the border appears on the screen while Feinstein ' s voice is heard explaining that 3 # 000 illegal immigrants try to cross the border many nights . Feinstein adds that she has only been in the Senate a short time , but has worked hard to secure the border with more agents , fencing , lighting and other equipment . It closes with the senator saying to the camera : &quot; I ' m Dianne Feinstein and I ' ve just begun to fight for California. &quot; THE ANALYSIS The statement that Huffington voted against new border guards is based on the congressman ' s opposition last month to a sweeping appropriations_bill that included funding for 700 new Border_Patrol guards . Huffington ' s campaign has called the Feinstein attack a &quot; shameless distortion &quot; because he has voted four times to increase the border guard even though he opposed the recent appropriations_bill , saying it also contained wasteful spending . Feinstein ' s campaign contends , however , that if Huffington ' s side had won the vote , the guards would not be added . Some Latino officials have criticized the video of illegal immigrants running_across the border , warning that it scapegoats immigrants and harms relations among ethnic_groups . The complaints have been nowhere near the level of criticism aimed at Gov . Pete Wilson for a similar commercial about immigration . Feinstein ' s campaign said its commercial was more sensitive because it was shot in_color , not black-and-white , and the commentary was not as inflammatory . The estimate that 3 # 000 illegal immigrants cross the border_on many nights was provided to Feinstein by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service , said Marco Ramirez , a spokesman for the federal agency . The ad ' s claim that Feinstein has worked hard on the issue refers to her outspoken role on the Judiciary Committee , which plays a major role on immigration legislation . Last summer , Feinstein unveiled a six-point plan that included a $ 1 border-crossing fee . Last month , she introduced a comprehensive bill that calls_for another 2 # 100 border guards in the next three years . Huffington supported a plan in April that would have added 6 # 000 guards over five years .</TEXT>
