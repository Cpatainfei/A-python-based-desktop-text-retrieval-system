   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEWS ; ' WOVEN WATER ' A KITSCHY , FANTASTIC VOYAGE UNDER THE SEA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Walking into &quot; Woven Water , &quot; Maria Fernanda Cardoso ' s enchanting installation at Ruth Bloom Gallery , feels_like falling_into a dream . Thousands of starfish , seashells and sand_dollars -- suspended from the rafters , attached_to the walls and stacked on the floor -- make you feel_like a big fish in a beautiful aquarium . The tips of the starfish have been wired together to form undulating , organic nets that float overhead like constellations in the night sky , or cluster underfoot like synchronized troupes of tiny , stylized ballerinas . The slender , pointed shells of sea_snails , which resemble hollow , slightly curved pencils , have been slipped inside one another to form translucent scribbles spiraling through space like nonsensical handwriting . Artificially colored scallop_shells are stacked like poker_chips , and sand_dollars are strung together like enormous necklaces that also resemble the vertebrae of fantastic creatures . Cardoso ' s delightful installation shares many characteristics with the submarine ride at Disneyland . Both are upfront about their fakery , appealing_to visitors who willingly suspend disbelief . Neither piece of theater actually takes you into the sea , preferring instead that you visit the watery depths in your imagination . After a while , the initial , illusory magic of Cardoso ' s sculptures falls_flat : Her labor-intensive installation begins to look less like a dream and more like the decor of a cheesy seafood restaurant in the suburbs . The artist ' s impressive inventory of seashells simultaneously recalls the handcrafted knickknacks sold in souvenir shops near harbors and beaches all_over the world . Far from diminishing the power of Cardoso ' s art , however , these affinities with kitsch bolster the impact of her sculptures . The Colombian-born , Yale-educated and San Francisco-based artist mimics the formal elegance of Minimalist abstraction not to purge traces of touristic cliches from her work , but to emphasize connections among far-flung realms of culture . With barbed wit , Cardoso proposes that modern art is just another form of tourism . Like visits to out-of-the-ordinary , often exotic lands , art ' s significance depends_upon context , knowledge , history and point_of_view . Cheap souvenirs are intrinsically no more or less interesting than modernist abstractions . What counts are the ways you distill significance from Cardoso ' s promiscuous blends of natural materials and cultural forms , making meaning out of smart hybrids in which metaphors freely mix and contradictions abound . * Ruth Bloom Gallery , 2036 Broadway , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 829-7454 , through Sept . 3 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Sofa Showroom : Part garbage_dump , scavenger hunt , Christian myth and art historical sendup , Carter Potter ' s installation at TRI Gallery is also a cleverly compressed self-portrait . Titled &quot; Potter ' s Field , &quot; the L.A.-based artist ' s ongoing project consists_of two tidy piles of thrown-out couches that currently cover the floor of the small back gallery . Each day , for the duration of the exhibition , the 33-year-old Potter adds a junk sofa picked from the neighborhood . By the show ' s end , the room will be filled to overflowing . His growing accumulation of stained , slashed and stripped-down couches refers to the burial_ground for the indigent and friendless , first mentioned in the Bible when money that Judas was paid to betray Jesus was inherited by the city authorities and donated to the low-budget cemetery . Potter ' s modern gloss on the final resting place for the destitute offers a quick sketch of the hard-luck neighborhood of the new gallery , acknowledging the steadily increasing number of homeless people on Hollywood ' s streets . &quot; Potter ' s Field &quot; also surveys a major component of the artist ' s work . Over the past five years , Potter has pieced together sculptures with found couches and chairs , sometimes affixing them to the wall and at other times arranging them in Minimalist-inspired configurations . Those tattered pieces_of_furniture mock the middle-class idea of buying art to match the sofa and ridicule the requirement that art be pristine , neat and perfect . His current arrangement of discarded couches is indiscriminate or acompositional . It pays tongue-in-cheek homage to Potter ' s artistic forebears , repeating the once daring and now cliched impulse to fill galleries with garbage , dirt , blocks of wood or stacks of bricks . Following upon Franz West ' s celebrated installation of colorful public benches in the Museum of Contemporary Art ' s courtyard , &quot; Potter ' s Field &quot; appears to be the dumb , ugly cousin of such international ambition . His abandoned sofas cast such anonymous yet monumental gestures in more personal terms . These damaged pieces_of_furniture silently bear_witness to a host of domestic dramas , to past naps , conversations and comforts that Matisse found in his armchair and that Potter finds on curbsides all_over the city . * TRI Gallery , 6365 Yucca St. , ( 213 ) 469-6686 , through Sept . 5 . Closed Mondays and Tuesdays . * Sexual Boredom : Paul Botello ' s intimately scaled acrylics on canvas and board depict images never found in his more well-known murals . Sexual reveries take explicit shape in the L.A.-based artist ' s 22 boldly colored paintings at Granados 2 Gallery . Nude couples fondle , kiss , have_sex , swoon , float into the sky and fuse with the landscape . Unfortunately , Botello ' s paintings of men and women engaged in intimate embraces seem schematic and impersonal , as if the subjects of his images are not real individuals but generic types . Although Botello ' s vivid , supposedly private pictures have not been painted for public commissions and thus don ' t need the approval of boards or committees , they are nevertheless constrained by a style more suitable for murals than personal meditations on sex . Intimacy ' s extremely individual character gets lost in his readily accessible images . Part of this is intentional . Titled &quot; Sacred / Savage , &quot; Botello ' s exhibition is meant to transcend individuality , to reach back to a base animal_nature that is so vital and uncorrupted that it catapults us into the realm of religious transcendence . But Botello ' s flat , brusquely painted works do not carry viewers into these mysteries . * Granados 2 Gallery , 3221 Glendale Blvd. , Atwater Village , ( 213 ) 662-9930 , through Aug . 27 . Closed Sundays and Mondays .</TEXT>
