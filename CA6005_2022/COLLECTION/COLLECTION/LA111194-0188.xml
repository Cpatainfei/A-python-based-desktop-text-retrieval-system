   <HEADLINE> FILMMAKERS DOUBT GOP VICTORY WILL AFFECT WORK ; MOVIES : MOST INDUSTRY INSIDERS SAY SUBJECT_MATTER IS IMMUNE TO POLITICAL LANDSCAPE . STILL , MUCH OF HOLLYWOOD IS CASTING A WARY EYE TOWARD THE RISE IN CONSERVATIVES ' POWER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Though Hollywood and Republicans have never been comfortable bedfellows , few in the film business expect that the GOP landslide Tuesday will create negative ripples on the movie-making front . Family values and excessive violence -- on the streets and on the screen -- may be dominating the national debate , industry insiders say , but -- as the popularity of &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; and &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; point_out -- politics and entertainment are two different realms . While many in the creative community are reeling at the magnitude of the Republican victory , interviews with studio executives , producers and political analysts suggest that the impact on the movie_industry may , in fact , be negligible . &quot; Movies are ruled by the Movie God , not by the ballot_box , &quot; observed former Sony CEO Peter Guber , a lifelong Republican who threw his weight behind President Clinton in 1992 . &quot; Subject_matter , casting , distribution plans won ' t be altered by alterations in the country ' s political landscape. &quot; * While Hollywood is unlikely to undergo a sea change , few doubt that the messages of this year ' s election will eventually find their way into movies . &quot; Filmmakers will be dealing with stories about illegal immigration or the way society is dividing into one of ' haves ' and ' have-nots ' -- just as they did with stories about AIDS and the Vietnam_War , &quot; suggested TriStar Pictures President Marc Platt . &quot; This morning I was pulled over for running a red_light and a policeman asked to see my license . ' My passport , as well ? ' I asked -- in anger over the passage of Proposition 187 ( which denies public_services to undocumented immigrants ) . Others feel as I do . . . . and attitudes find their way into art. &quot; Jack Valenti , president of the Motion_Picture Assn . of America who formerly served as President Lyndon B . Johnson ' s press secretary , insisted that the industry ' s critical issues will not be adversely affected by the first Republican-controlled Congress in decades . &quot; Movie piracy , family values , open trade of movies and TV_shows are bipartisan issues -- not the preserve of a particular party , &quot; he says . &quot; Republican senators ranging from Oregon ' s Bob Packwood to North Carolina ' s Jesse Helms are big supporters of filmmaking . . . and I have a good relationship with ( probable Senate Majority_Leader ) Bob Dole. &quot; * Valenti -- and his TV counterparts -- will have a new roster of committee leaders to deal with in their D.C. lobbying efforts . Sen . Larry Pressler ( R-S.D. ) will probably replace Ernest F . Hollings ( D-S.C. ) as chair of the all-important Senate Commerce Committee , which , under the Democrats , was expected to write new Information Highway legislation in 1995 . Packwood -- a friend of the cable industry -- will likely become head of the Senate communications subcommittee now chaired by Sen . Daniel K . Inouye ( D-Hawaii ) . And Rep . Jack Fields ( R-Texas ) is the leading contender to chair the influential House telecommunications subcommittee currently headed by Rep . Edward J . Markey ( D-Mass. ) TriStar ' s Platt , who calls himself a liberal Democrat , suggested that the business side of Hollywood may find the new terrain to its liking . &quot; Lower corporate taxes and less governmental regulation will be viewed by some as good for any big corporation -- including entertainment conglomerates , &quot; he said . &quot; The Time-Warner merger , after all , occurred in the ( President ) Bush era , when there was little antitrust enforcement . The strong are likely to become stronger. &quot; One highly placed industry executive observed that the Republican debt to the Christian right could be problematic for Hollywood if the party becomes a bully pulpit . &quot; Most issues affecting the business are neither Republican nor Democratic , &quot; he said , noting that conservative Sen . Orrin G . Hatch ( R-Utah ) is one of the strongest advocates of protection of copyright -- the most important issue facing Hollywood today . &quot; Still , censorship is one of the foundations of the agenda of the Christian right , to whom the Republicans are now more beholden . That instills fear in the hearts of artists everywhere. &quot; * Movie producer Frank Price , a registered Republican who has supported such Democrats as senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Edward M . Kennedy of Massachusetts as well as California Gov . Pete Wilson and senatorial candidate Michael Huffington , said that the Clinton_Administration has also weighed in as a critic of media violence . &quot; Last I looked , it was ( U.S. Atty . Gen. ) Janet Reno coming_down on the networks , &quot; he says . &quot; Censorship is not particular to either party . It ' s just that liberals are OK with sex while conservatives are OK with violence. &quot; Last December , President Clinton himself attended a fund-raiser at Hollywood ' s Creative Artists Agency and challenged a high-powered media crowd to consider the impact of film and TV violence on impoverished youngsters who lack family and community support . Though this fall ' s network_programming has generated fewer complaints in that area than in years past , feature_films are still ridden with blood and gore . Films such_as &quot; The Crow &quot; scored big last summer and &quot; Frankenstein , &quot; &quot; Interview With the Vampire &quot; and &quot; The Professional &quot; are being served_up . Many have charged that the Classification and Rating Administration -- the film_industry ' s controversial ratings board -- is much softer_on violence than on sex . Some in the industry say that the success of two recent studio releases reflect the electorate ' s hunger for morality and decency . &quot; ' Forrest Gump ' was a feel-good movie of the first order -- one that said that despite all_the pain of 30 years of American history , life can still be good , &quot; said one studio executive . Others contend that it ' s counterproductive for studios to test the political waters before deciding what movies to make . According to the National Assn . of Theater Owners , the average consumer only sees six movies a year . And their entertainment choices are not always linked to their politics . &quot; The reality is that the public doesn ' t speak with one voice , &quot; said Kathy Garmezy , executive_director of the Hollywood Policy Center -- a nonprofit entertainment_industry group . Still , she added , the Republicans may try to use their newfound power as a mandate to dredge_up issues on which Hollywood has already been raked over the coals . Producer Sean Daniel ( &quot; Tombstone &quot; ) said that while Washington is unlikely to intercede in Hollywood affairs , the scenario is not unprecedented . &quot; The last time a Republican majority swept both houses of Congress during a midterm election , it was 1946 , and it kicked_off the McCarthy era and Hollywood blacklisting , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m not saying that historical conditions are the same , but we ' ll be watching carefully for any rumblings. &quot; * Optimists suggest that the current situation is no different from the Bush-Quayle years when Republicans occupied the White_House and Democrats controlled Capitol_Hill . And the election , they note , contained a smidgen of good news . &quot; Led by the Motion_Picture Assn. , voters decisively rejected radical right-inspired bills in Colorado and Oregon , &quot; one industry insider said . &quot; If the legislation had passed , it would have permitted local authorities to impose their own standards of what constitutes obscenity. &quot; Clinton , however , is far from old news as far as Hollywood is concerned . On Dec . 3 , some of Hollywood ' s biggest power_brokers will fork out between $ 50 # 000 and $ 100 # 000 per couple at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser hosted by Steven Spielberg and his actress-wife , Kate Capshaw . Attended by the President and Mrs . Clinton , the event -- to be co-chaired by David Geffen , Jeffrey Katzenberg and supermarket magnate Ron Burkle -- will be held at the Spielbergs ' home . &quot; The question on the table , &quot; said one political analyst , &quot; is whether this election will discourage Hollywood ' s Democrats or give them even more reason to fight back. &quot;</TEXT>
