   <HEADLINE> CONROY ' PADDLING ' BILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I have been following Assemblyman Conroy ' s &quot; paddling &quot; bill . I am astounded that such a bill would receive the attention ( it ) has . While most Californians are justifiably outraged with the increase of graffiti , we must_not use our outrage and frustration to sanction actions that would otherwise be considered child_abuse . Like all forms of discipline of children we must design a response that will teach respect for personal and public_property , and actually change behavior rather than just punishing behavior . We must address the causes of the problem as well as the solution . There are many nonviolent strategies that could be employed to accomplish this result . The comments made by boxer Tony ( The Tiger ) Lopez in support are irresponsible at best . He is obviously not an expert on child_abuse or even child-rearing . I often speak in high_schools and colleges about child_abuse and child_abuse prevention . The subject of spanking children almost always comes_up . A small number of students believe that spanking children under certain circumstances is an acceptable form of discipline . However , when I asked them if they could find a nonviolent way to accomplish the same result , which would they choose , without exception they choose the nonviolent way . It is possible to successfully raise children without hitting them . BARBARA J . OLIVER Dana Point</TEXT>
