   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : U.S. BRAINPOWER HELPS FUEL ELECTRIFICATION OF THE FAR EAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the most significant business stories of the decade is unfolding in the massive building of electric_power plants in Asia , with U.S. companies , perhaps surprisingly , in the forefront . Some 18 countries from China to Indonesia are planning and building power_plants at a breathtaking pace as they strive to develop modern industrial economies . General Electric Co . expects more_than 460 billion Watts of power to be ordered in Asia over the next 10 years , says Delbert Williamson , head of GE ' s power_systems division who is now based in Hong Kong . that ' s more_than 400 generating plants , requiring an investment across Asia of roughly $ 300 billion . The idea dwarfs the outlook for almost any other business , and is calling_forth vast financial ventures , such_as a $ 2.5-billion fund being set_up by GE Capital and global financier George Soros . China plans to build more_than a dozen plants a year , India will add five a year , Indonesia , the Philippines and South_Korea will be adding a lot of electrical_capacity . Even Japan ' s mature economy will be adding more_than 50 power_plants to build a reserve of power the way U.S. utilities do . The projections are not pie in the sky . In many countries , construction is underway . South_Korea , for example , is building two new cities -- Ilsan and Puchon -- around Westinghouse power_plants that will provide electricity for light and heating . The needs are immediate . The Philippines has just bought 39 diesel generators from Caterpillar Inc. , put them on offshore barges and hooked them into the national power_grid . Diesel generators are higher-cost , interim producers but the Philippines needs them to curb brownouts while larger base-load plants are built . At that , the brownouts attest to rising living standards : They are caused by more people using electric rice cookers . The scale and bustle of activity are fascinating , but the electrification of Asia is more_than a &quot; gee whiz &quot; story . It holds business lessons galore and poses important questions . First , if Asian_countries , particularly China , build all those power_plants , won ' t the global environment be hurt ? Maybe not , thanks to the way plants will be built . Some of China ' s increased electricity will come from Yankee ingenuity . Westinghouse Electric is already at_work renovating 150 generators to increase their efficiency and output . The result will give China the equivalent of 10 additional , and cleaner , power_plants . Also , the new plants that are built_in China and elsewhere will use environment-friendly methods that gasify coal and then burn gas to generate electricity -- even though such plants cost millions more to build . Why will poor countries , which at their present stage of development care more about industry than the environment , pay more for their electric plants ? Because international lenders will insist on it , says Edward R . Muller , president of Mission Energy , a subsidiary of SCE Corp. , which builds and operates electric plants here and abroad . &quot; Financing on these plants will be_on 10-to-12-year cycles , &quot; says Muller . Lenders won ' t want to get caught with a plant that has to be shut_down in the future . So they ' ll withhold financing unless environmental standards are met . A second question is closer to home : Why are U.S. companies so prevalent in the business , particularly in Asia , which was thought to be a Japanese sphere_of_influence ? The answer is that global business respects skills more_than nationality , and U.S. firms benefit from know-how and preparation . Asian_nations are deciding that private power is the way to get more electricity . Rather than raise taxes or try to float government_bonds to build generating plants costing $ 2.5 billion each , they are turning_to private contractors to finance , build , own and run electric utilities . And U.S. companies , with a lot of know-how about setting rates and billing customers , are reaping a growth business . Mission , Duke Energy and Southern Electric International , along with non-utility companies such_as Enron Power and Transco Energy , got_into the business thanks to a 1978 law that encouraged alternative_energy producers and have years of experience in domestic and foreign markets . U.S. power-plant suppliers have kept_up technologically by pursuing overseas markets in recent years , when few plants have been ordered domestically . GE , the world leader , and Westinghouse have been adaptive , forming joint_ventures in China , Japan and elsewhere . They prepared_for a market that is exuberantly global . Indonesia , for example , is about to launch construction of a $ 2.5-billion power_plant , which will be owned by Mission Energy , Mitsui of Japan , GE and an Indonesian company . GE will supply the turbine generator but other major parts will come from Switzerland ' s Asea Brown Boveri . Financing will come from global capital markets and Fluor Daniel or Bechtel will handle engineering and construction because those U.S. firms have credibility with global lenders , who want plants built well and on schedule . For a lesson in world business today , we should note who is buying and what is being sold . Poor countries -- Indonesia , China , India , Vietnam -- where villages are awakening to the dynamics and clamor of the modern_world economy are buying , with the aid of global financial markets . And what the United States and other developed countries have to sell is brainpower , whether contained in turbine generators and advanced fuel-burning systems or in knowledge of how to construct an electrical grid and use it most efficiently . Knowledge , reliability , credibility may_not appear on any balance_sheet , but they are very significant national assets in the race for business in emerging , electrifying Asia .</TEXT>
