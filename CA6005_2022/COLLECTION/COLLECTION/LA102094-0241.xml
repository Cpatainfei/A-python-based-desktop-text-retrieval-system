   <HEADLINE> REFERENDUM FAILS ON FEE INCREASE ; CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE : ATHLETIC PROGRAM MIGHT DROP FROM DIVISION I AFTER STUDENTS AGAIN VOTE_DOWN PROPOSAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now what ? Having failed Wednesday in its second attempt this year to pass a referendum increasing student fees allocated to Cal State Northridge sports programs , the school ' s athletic department was left to mull its future . Included on the list of worst-case options is a major retooling of the athletic program , including a drop from NCAA Division I to Division II . Northridge students , participating in a two-day election by touch-tone telephone , voted 2 # 315 to 2 # 116 against the referendum . The proposal would have raised money allocated to athletics from $ 4 to $ 49 a semester per student . The referendum , which generated the largest election turnout in school history , would have generated $ 2.25 million annually for athletics based on current enrollment levels . &quot; I think we did pretty much everything we could do , &quot; said Bob Hiegert , Northridge ' s athletic director . &quot; I don ' t think I ' d do anything differently . &quot; It ' s a difficult time ( economically ) to ask people for fee increases . But I don ' t think this is a good thing for the university. &quot; When the vote was announced Wednesday night at 10:10 p.m. at Northridge athletic department headquarters , the timbre changed from nervous anticipation to unqualified gloom . A group of approximately 75 student-athletes gathered for the verdict and groaned when Hiegert quietly read the final tally . Several swore and at least one broke_out in tears . The interpretation of the final tally was clear : Northridge students , who voted_down a similar proposal last spring , don ' t place a high priority on athletics . &quot; that ' s what 4 # 000 of them think , &quot; Hiegert said . &quot; I ' d like to know where the other 16 # 000 or so were. &quot; An athletics referendum was narrowly defeated last spring , 993-906 . Northridge administrators , attempting to raise awareness to the issue , this fall mounted a month-long campaign to sway student opinion in athletics ' favor . The referendum was necessary to keep the program afloat at the current level , Hiegert said . Northridge athletics , with a budget of $ 3.6 million for 1994-95 , stands to lose approximately $ 700 # 000 the following year , he said . The recession and declining enrollment -- the fall student population of 24 # 378 is down approximately 7 # 000 from the school ' s high-water_mark of the late 1980s -- trimmed enrollment-based accounts . &quot; Most of the feedback the athletes received was that ( voting against ) the increase was a fee issue , not an athletics issue , &quot; Hiegert said . The school faces a series of tough decisions regarding its long-term course . Northridge , which has competed at the Division I level for five seasons , may be forced to trim selected men ' s sports to satisfy gender-equity requirements of the California State University system . Football , which plays_at the Division I-AA level , could face elimination . To remain at the Division I level , Northridge must field seven sports each for men and women . It currently fields the NCAA-recognized equivalent of 16 , Hiegert said . Hiegert would n ' t speculate on what restrictions would apply to athletes seeking to transfer to another school if Northridge eventually moves to Division II . For the remainder of the student body , the referendum ' s defeat could come_with a price_tag -- at least for those who frequent athletic events . Northridge is considering charging admission to students to make_up for the budget losses . Previously , students with a valid Associated Students activities card were admitted free to all athletic events . Athletics dangled several carrots before the student body , to no avail . If the referendum passed , two women ' s teams were scheduled to be added . Scholarship limits were to be raised to the Division I maximum for every team but football , allowing Northridge to compete more realistically against fully funded opponents . Donations and corporate funds previously used to augment the day-to-day budget instead would be dedicated to facilities improvement . After failing in its referendum attempt last spring , the athletics department campaigned for the past month as Matador athletes gave informational speeches to their classmates and distributed promotional literature on campus . Twice beaten , thrice shy ? Perhaps not . Hiegert would n ' t count_out another referendum attempt in the future . &quot; I ' m not ruling anything out at this point , &quot; he said , fingering the paper on which the final tally was handwritten . Hiegert said he has a meeting tentatively scheduled Tuesday with Ron Kopita , the dean of students . The pair , along with President Blenda Wilson , will then begin plotting out the program ' s future and begin addressing predicted funding shortfalls . Hiegert , who seemed somewhat stunned by the tally , was at_a_loss to explain the department ' s next move . &quot; I don ' t really know what we ' ll do , &quot; Hiegert said .</TEXT>
