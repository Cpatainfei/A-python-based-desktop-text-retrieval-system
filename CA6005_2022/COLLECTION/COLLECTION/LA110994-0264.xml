   <HEADLINE> WORK BEGINS ON IRVINE 21-SCREEN MOVIE COMPLEX ; DEVELOPMENT : THE THEATERS ARE PART OF A $ 30-MILLION ENTERTAINMENT AND RETAIL CENTER . THE FIRST SCREENINGS ARE SCHEDULED FOR NEXT FALL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Construction on what could be the nation ' s largest cinema complex -- a 135 # 000-square-foot theater center with seating for 5 # 800 moviegoers -- begins today just north of the El Toro Y , where the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways merge . The cinema complex , part of a $ 30-million entertainment and retail center designed to resemble a Moroccan village , will have 21 screens . Four of the theaters will have screens more_than three stories tall and seat 500 moviegoers each . One screen will be devoted to art and foreign films , and another -- possibly outside the main building -- will only be used for coming-attraction trailers and cartoons . Parking for 4 # 500 vehicles will be provided . &quot; It ' s going_to be a landmark for Orange County , &quot; said Keith Eyrich , a vice_president in the retail division of the Irvine Co. , which is building the entertainment_center in partnership with Edwards Theaters Circuit Inc. The cinema complex -- scheduled to open in October -- will be_on a 235 # 000-square-foot site off Irvine Center Drive_in the Irvine Spectrum , the developer ' s 3 # 600-acre office park . The theaters are part of an entertainment_center that will include a food court called &quot; Oasis &quot; and a plaza designed as a bazaar where kiosks selling food , crafts and accessories could be set_up . Book and music stores are planned , as are four major restaurants . Other courtyard areas will have fountains . With nighttime activities , the center will likely have some outside lighting displays , such_as computer-generated laser lighting , officials said . &quot; It is such a wonderful theater . It will be a destination , &quot; said James Edwards Sr. , chairman of Newport Beach-based Edwards Theatres Circuit , Orange County ' s largest chain of movie_theaters . &quot; We have many neighborhood theaters , but things change . We need more modern theaters. &quot; A miniature locomotive is planned for inside the theater to entertain children with rides , Edwards said . The theaters will all have digital sound and one screen may be devoted exclusively to Spanish- and other foreign-language films , said Edwards . Some of the theaters will have amphitheater-style seating to give moviegoers a clearer view . At 21 screens , the Edwards complex will surpass the 18-screen Cineplex Odeon located next to Universal Studios-Hollywood , now the largest in California . Though a theater under construction in Texas is set to have 24 screens , developers and entertainment analysts believe the Irvine center will be the nation ' s largest in square footage . &quot; Our entertainment_center will be the downtown of Orange County , &quot; said Frederick O . Evans , the Irvine Co. ' s retail division president . &quot; We want to create a play place and still provide services to the 35 # 000 daytime residents of the Irvine Spectrum. &quot; Mission Viejo resident Tamara Anthony , a manager at AST Research Corp . headquarters at the Irvine Spectrum , said she is looking_forward to seeing movies right after work . Though concerned about increased traffic , Anthony said &quot; the good outweighs the bad. &quot; Real-estate watchers said the entertainment complex should fill a need in South County . &quot; It ' s different , it ' s bigger and it ' s easy to get_to . These all combine to make a very exciting project , &quot; said Greg Mickelson , a vice_president in the retail division of the Koll Co. , a Newport Beach development company . &quot; The size of the screens and the arena seating -- I think it intensifies the movie experience and makes_it more unique. &quot; Some of the nation ' s largest theater_companies are building megaplexes ; AMC has begun construction of a 24-screen , 80 # 000-square-foot complex near Dallas . Currently , the nation ' s largest movie complex is a 20-screen theater in Grand Rapids , Mich. , according to Jim Kozack , spokesman for the National Assn . of Theater Owners . Though the Edwards complex will be at one of Southern California ' s most congested freeway interchanges , county planners have said they do not expect cinema buffs to have trouble getting there , thinking that most movie fans would be arriving in the evening , after the afternoon rush-hour . And $ 247-million in improvements are underway at the El Toro Y interchange to help ease congestion . The Spectrum business park , opened in 1974 , was always planned to include a retail development . As early as 1976 , the Irvine Co . unveiled plans for a $ 300-million shopping_mall that would have opened by 1980 on land at the current site , which was then called &quot; The Golden Triangle. &quot; The company ' s ambitious plans included an enclosed mall anchored by Nordstrom and four other department_stores , more_than 100 adjacent shops , a 350-room hotel and an ice_rink . Those plans were never realized , but Irvine Co . officials said that plans for a regional mall are back on the drawing board and could be unveiled next year .</TEXT>
