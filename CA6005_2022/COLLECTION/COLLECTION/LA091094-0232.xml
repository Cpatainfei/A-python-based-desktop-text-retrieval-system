   <HEADLINE> SACRAMENTO FILE : BILLS ALLOW 14-YEAR-OLDS TO BE TRIED AS ADULTS IN SOME CRIMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson has signed into law a package of three anti-crime bills that allow minors as young as 14 who are charged with violent serious crimes to be tried , convicted and imprisoned as adults . The three bills are SB 23X by Sen . Bill Leonard ( R-Big Bear Lake ) , AB 560 by Sen . Steve Peace ( D-Bonita ) and SB 1539 by Sen . Dan McCorquodale ( D-Modesto ) . Peace introduced his bill when he was in the Assembly . In 1992 , juveniles were responsible_for 19 % of the state ' s murders , according to the governor , and arrests of minors for violent crimes increased 63.7 % from 1987 to 1992 . In addition , the governor said street gangs have increasingly enlisted juveniles to carry_out violent crimes because gangs know that existing laws treat minors more leniently than adults . &quot; When young violent offenders kill , rape or rob , they must be given the same penalty as adults , because it doesn ' t matter_to their victims how old they are , &quot; the governor told a Capitol news_conference . GOVERNOR Bills Signed * Juvenile Handgun Penalties : AB 2470 by Assemblyman Richard Rainey ( R-Walnut Creek ) makes minors convicted of illegal possession of handguns subject_to up_to three years imprisonment , and allows judges to revoke their driver ' s licenses for up_to five years and order them to perform up_to 500 hours of community service . * Stalking : AB 95X by Assemblyman John Burton ( D-San Francisco ) requires the state_Department of Corrections to notify victims , their families and court witnesses before it releases inmates who have been convicted of stalking crimes . * Aggravated Arson : SB 1309 by Sen . William Craven ( R-Oceanside ) imposes a prison_term of 10 years to life for arsonists who set fires that are intended to cause injury or property damage and result in either $ 5 million or more in damage or the destruction of five or more homes . * Arson Reporting : AB 2336 by Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) sets_up a statewide computerized arson information reporting system to help local fire and law_enforcement officials track and arrest arsonists . * Registering Arsonists : AB 8X by Assemblyman Bill Hoge ( R-Pasadena ) requires any person convicted of arson to register with local law_enforcement agencies . * Religious Worship : AB 3103 by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson ( R-Newport Beach ) increases the penalty from six months to a year in jail for disturbing religious church_services or preventing people from attending them .</TEXT>
