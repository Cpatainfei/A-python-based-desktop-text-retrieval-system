   <HEADLINE> HIGH-POWERED FUND RAISING IS PAYING OFF FOR BROWN ; CAMPAIGN : BUT RIVALS FAULT PAST PRACTICE OF TAKING MONEY FROM THOSE DOING BUSINESS WITH TREASURER ' S OFFICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Few politicians are as prodigious at fund raising as state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown , now on a quest to become governor . Assembly Speaker Willie Brown -- no slouch himself when it comes_to raising campaign money -- speaks_of her as a &quot; fund-raising machine. &quot; Over evening cocktails or morning coffee , at $ 500-a-plate lunches , in cross-country calls from her car phone , at gala banquets , Brown tirelessly uses her charm , family connections and disarming directness to perform a job that some politicians view with disgust -- raising money , lots of it . &quot; She ' s not afraid to ask the question , &quot; said Brown ' s East Coast fund-raiser , Susan Torricelli . &quot; She is able to say directly to people , ' I need money from you. ' She can do_it on the phone and do_it in_person . Many people are uncomfortable doing it. &quot; The result : After three years of fund raising , Brown has more cash -- $ 5 million -- than incumbent Republican Gov . Pete Wilson or either of her Democratic rivals , Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen . Tom Hayden . But Wilson and Garamendi have found plenty to criticize in the treasurer ' s fund-raising performance . In particular , their campaigns fault Brown for money she has raised from investment_bankers and others who do business with her office . Brown denies that the contributions have influenced her decisions as treasurer , and she stopped taking money from the investment_bankers last year . By that time , she had collected more_than $ 800 # 000 from employees of bond houses and attorneys with law_firms that oversee the sale of billions of dollars in state bonds . A review of Brown ' s fund-raising records and interviews with dozens of her contributors show the broad reach of her fund-raising_efforts and the varied reasons donors have for giving . Among her contributors are traditional Democratic interests , such_as labor_unions and trial_lawyers , eager to end 12 years of GOP control of the governor ' s office . There are also friends and appointees of her father , former Gov . Edmund G . ( Pat ) Brown Sr. , and brother , ex-Gov . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr . She also has received contributions from Hollywood figures such_as actor Kevin Costner and entertainment mogul David Geffen . Even more significant , perhaps , is a nationwide network of women , many of them professionals , who would be happy to see a woman become chief_executive of the nation ' s most populous state . Missing from the list , for the most part , are large corporate donors and trade organizations . But these will come later , Torricelli said , if Brown can win the Democratic primary and emerge as a possible winner in the fall . &quot; Keep_in mind , if not now , but post-primary , any smart business entity is going_to give to both sides if both sides look plausible , &quot; Torricelli said . The contributions from those who have done business with the treasurer ' s office are proving to be an irresistible target for Brown ' s opponents . Dan Schnur , spokesman for the Wilson campaign , said : &quot; There is an overall pattern of firms receiving bond business from Kathleen Brown ' s treasurer ' s office after having contributed to the Kathleen Brown campaign . ( The campaign ) recognized it , and moved to correct it , albeit after three years. &quot; Schnur said that Brown ' s acceptance of those contributions is different from Wilson ' s taking payments from major California industries that have interests in matters on Wilson ' s desk . &quot; The governor of the state of California has responsibility direct or indirect over almost every aspect of life in this state , &quot; Schnur said . Brown refused to be interviewed on fund-raising issues , but her aides emphatically deny that she has ever allowed a contribution to influence a decision as treasurer . &quot; The contracts ( to bankers ) do not follow contributions , &quot; said Brown campaign spokesman Michael Reese . &quot; Firms that gave considerable amounts in many cases got very little business . Firms that gave little or no contributions got quite a lot of business. &quot; Moreover , Reese argued , Brown was the first_state treasurer in the country to stop taking contributions from those that do business with her office . But before cutting them off , records show , Brown built a solid foundation of cash to launch her campaign and convince potential challengers that she was the Democratic front-runner . In January , 1992 , Brown stopped accepting checks from the investment banking firms that package sales of state bonds . But she continued to take sizable contributions from individual investment_bankers who worked for the firms . However , in 1993 , charges of improprieties began to erupt in states including New Jersey , where aides to the former governor are under investigation for allegedly improperly benefiting from bond sales . &quot; We wanted to step_out from the shadows cast in those states , &quot; Reese said . &quot; At that point we extended the restrictions to individuals. &quot; By the time Brown cut these sources off , in July , 1993 , she had accepted $ 450 # 000 from the bond houses and their employees . Atop the list is First Boston Corp . and its bankers , who gave Brown $ 52 # 750 since she became treasurer . The biggest single contributor , with $ 10 # 000 , was First Boston ' s chief_executive , Archibald Cox Jr. , now managing director of Tiger Management Corp . Cox said his contribution had nothing to do with First Boston ' s business dealings with the treasurer . &quot; I did_it purely myself because I think very highly of her. &quot; As part of her self-imposed rule , Brown also has been refusing money from the law_firms hired to provide the required legal opinions on bond sales . But she continues to take contributions from individual attorneys with those firms . In three years in office , she has collected more_than $ 350 # 000 from attorneys with the law_firms she does business with . One of these is the law_firm where she once worked as an attorney , O ' Melveny &amp; Myers . In the past three years , O ' Melveny and its attorneys have given her $ 52 # 900 . &quot; She is like family , one of us , &quot; said Gilbert Ray , the O ' Melveny lawyer who oversees the firm ' s donations . Ray said he has never felt pressure to contribute from Brown or any other politician . &quot; We have never had a politician infer that there was a ' pay-to-play system , ' &quot; he said . Brown ' s gubernatorial campaign has also taken more_than $ 50 # 000 from waste disposal companies , utilities and other firms that benefited from bond sales . And she continues to accept checks from employees of securities firms and law offices that do business with the state ' s massive pension_funds -- the Public Employees Retirement System and the State Teachers Retirement System . As treasurer , Brown serves as a trustee for both systems . Campaign spokesman Reese said that in these cases , Brown is only one member of a decision-making board or commission -- in many cases sitting side_by_side with representatives of Wilson and state Controller Gray Davis . Brown ' s fund raising extends far beyond those with whom her office does business . She has held fund-raisers at the homes of Sen . Jay Rockefeller in Washington , and financier Jerome Kohlberg in rural New York state . She appeared at a two-for-one event in New York City with Texas Gov . Ann Richards -- netting $ 90 # 000 for each campaign . Richards also appeared at a series of fund-raisers in California for Brown -- attracting 4 # 000 contributors who paid more_than $ 500 # 000 to see them in October . Brown has followed Richards ' example in reaching_out to women , who provide a significant part of her support . &quot; Early money is like yeast , &quot; Brown has repeated to early backers -- quoting the signature phrase of EMILY ' s List , a national organization dedicated to electing women to public office . Over the past two years , the group has collected an estimated $ 400 # 000 for Brown from individual contributors nationwide . The treasurer also has shown an ability to connect in Hollywood . Warren Beatty introduced her at a $ 1 # 000-a-plate dinner at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in December and told a story about the time the two went_out on a date . The yarn was apocryphal , but the event was a success , taking_in more_than $ 1 million . Many supporters open their homes for dinners or receptions . Last year , Brown stopped in on 50 smaller events each raising at least $ 10 # 000 , said campaign finance director Ann Hollister . Records show that Brown also is tapping into traditional Democratic Party stalwarts such_as organized labor . Her critics charge that Brown only captured labor backing after she reversed her early support for the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , a pact opposed by much of organized labor . In the first_half of last year , when Brown was supporting NAFTA , her union donations were lagging . After her reversal , the contributions started rolling in -- $ 240 # 000 in the second_half of the year , quadrupling what she had taken_in during the first_half of 1993 . Hollister , Brown ' s fund-raiser , attributed the increase in_labor contributions to the seasonal nature of fund-raising_efforts , and not to Brown ' s stand on NAFTA . &quot; It ' s reflective of the campaign_for_governor heating_up at that point , &quot; Hollister said . In interviews , Brown contributors give a range of reasons for sending checks to her campaign . Some donors are longtime Democrats who see her as the hope for unseating Republican Wilson . A number enjoy rubbing shoulders with political luminaries . Some say they just like Brown personally . And several wanted to discuss specific issues with a possible future governor . Magazine_publisher Stephen Adams , chairman of the Affinity Group , gave Brown $ 12 # 500 and then was introduced to her at an intimate dinner last month , arranged by a business associate -- a high_school classmate of Jerry Brown . Between courses at a Los Angeles restaurant with the treasurer and her news executive husband , Van Gordon Sauter , Adams was able to voice his concerns about the high cost of workers ' compensation insurance , which has forced him to shift jobs out of state . &quot; I expressed my view , &quot; Adams said . &quot; I don ' t think she had many arguments with it. &quot; After the meal , Adams sent the campaign a check for another $ 12 # 500 . There are no limits on the size of contributions in state races . In Southern California , the Brown campaign has organized a group of 40 women , each pledged to raise $ 25 # 000 before the June primary . Among the members of this women ' s campaign cabinet is lawyer Roberta Bennett , a lesbian activist who has raised $ 60 # 000 by filling tables at various fund-raisers . Bennett said she wants &quot; more appointments for the gay and lesbian community , &quot; more funding to combat AIDS , and a review of ROTC programs on college campuses in the state , which &quot; are discriminating against gays and lesbians in violation of university and college bylaws. &quot; Brown has not given her a commitment , but does hear her out on these and other issues , Bennett said . George Hedges , who runs a law_firm in Downtown Los Angeles and contributed $ 10 # 000 to Brown , explained why many of his legal colleagues are contributing to Brown : &quot; Part of your cachet as a lawyer is that you can say to a client , ' Let ' s get Kathleen on the phone. ' &quot; And he observed that &quot; a lot of lawyers want to be judges. &quot; Many of Kathleen Brown ' s donors are friends of her father , or were appointees of her brother . One such supporter of Pat Brown is Fred Furth . A Northern California lawyer , he owns the Chalk Hill Winery and was counselor to Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern . He was not a fan of Jerry Brown . &quot; Tell me you ' re not just a retread of Moonbeam , &quot; Furth recalled telling Kathleen Brown in their first conversation . &quot; What hurt Jerry was that he was an antiseptic person. &quot; Furth became convinced when the new Brown told about her three children , a divorce , and her career as a lawyer . He has given her $ 25 # 000 . Her largest single contribution came from John and Rebecca Moores of Sugar Land , Tex . Brown met the couple through Mark Caddell , a Houston lawyer she saw on a fund-raising jaunt through Texas . A trustee of the Democratic National Committee , Caddell concluded that Brown has &quot; the potential to have national stature. &quot; He wrote her a check for $ 5 # 000 and promptly introduced her to the Mooreses . John Moores made his fortune , estimated by Forbes magazine at more_than $ 400 million , by founding BMC Software Inc. , in Sugar Land . He is retired and devotes much of his time to philanthropic pursuits . The couple own a home_in Carmel . Last year , the Mooreses gave Brown a ride to one of her appointments on their private plane . At the end of the flight , they &quot; pulled_out a checkbook and wrote_out a check , &quot; Caddell said . The amount : $ 105 # 000 . The Moores could not be reached for comment about why they gave her the money . A future story will examine the fund raising of gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi . Kathleen Brown ' s Top Contributors State_Treasurer Kathleen Brown may need to raise as much as $ 25 million to compete in the primary and general_elections for governor . Here are her top contributors since 1991 .
