   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; U.S. OFFICIALS HEARTENED -- AT LEAST FOR NOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. officials now expect NATO to achieve at least ragged compliance with its demand for withdrawal of the Bosnian Serb howitzers and other heavy_weapons that have rained random death on Sarajevo for almost two years . And respite for Bosnia ' s battered capital is likely to be accomplished without an immediate need for allied air strikes . But the unsteady cease-fire in the snow-encrusted mountains above Sarajevo is not expected to last more_than two or three months at best . Renewed fighting , when it comes , will probably include not only a resumption of the shelling that has claimed 10 # 000 lives in the besieged capital but also a determined ground offensive by numerically superior Muslim forces that have heretofore been defensive underdogs . New fighting by Croat troops seeking to recapture lost ground and stabilize their positions in Bosnia is also expected . As a result , with Monday ' s deadline for compliance with the U.N. and NATO ultimatum in Sarajevo close_at_hand , the assessments that are guiding the Clinton_Administration run nearly parallel with those of analysts on the ground in Bosnia and elsewhere : a bittersweet mixture of surprising optimism for the short term and deep-seated pessimism for the long term . &quot; At best , the West has provided an interval of sanity for Sarajevo . But the war will continue , &quot; said a congressional source , echoing the thinking of officials inside the U.S._government . &quot; The factors required to make all_the parties believe that peace is in their best interest at_the_same_time simply aren ' t there yet. &quot; Bosnian Serb leaders want to avoid an outright armed clash with allied air_power and will comply with the ultimatum enough to avoid such attacks . Their ultimate goals will not change , however . &quot; For the immediate future , we ' re likely to get cooperation . But whether within a month or even sooner , all sides will begin a testing period to see what they can get_away with , &quot; said Zalmay Khalilzad , former assistant undersecretary of defense for policy planning and now senior strategist at the RAND Corp . Moreover , even immediate respite for the dispirited citizens of Sarajevo -- welcome as it will be in psychological and humanitarian terms -- is not likely to end the grim work of &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; by Serb nationalists using terror , harassment and persecution against Muslims elsewhere in Bosnia . Nor will lifting the siege of Sarajevo bring automatic relief for dozens of cities and towns lacking the symbolic prominence of the long-suffering capital . The plight of the 40 # 000 Muslims trapped in Srebrenica will not change , nor will that of the 150 Canadian soldiers serving as the encircled town ' s human shield . And Bosnian Serb forces still operate deadly artillery cordons around the predominantly Muslim cities of Gorazde , Zepa , Maglaj and Bihac . So far , they are believed to have held_back from wholesale killings and expulsions primarily to stave_off the kind of punitive actions that NATO is threatening for Bosnian Serb gunners above Sarajevo . But such enclaves remain highly vulnerable . Already , angry Serbian leaders in Belgrade and in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale have warned that Western intervention might widen the Balkans conflict , rather than contain it . &quot; We are openly telling everyone : In case of air strikes , all foreigners who find themselves on our territory will become hostages , &quot; Gen . Manojlo Milovanovic , the Bosnian Serb army chief_of_staff , was quoted as warning in the latest edition of the Serbian weekly Intervju . &quot; Those include International Red_Cross and ( U.N. relief ) workers and , sadly , journalists too. &quot; The defiant rebel leader also threatened &quot; massacre of international representatives &quot; in Muslim enclaves , an apparent reference_to the Canadians in Srebrenica . Most of the hundreds of aid workers and 12 # 000 U.N. troops deployed throughout Bosnia could be moved to more secure areas as a precaution against their becoming targets for retaliation . But some have recently been reminded of their vulnerability . Five officials of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees office in the northern Serb stronghold of Banja Luka were prevented from leaving Serb-held territory last week on the pretext of having failed to apply for travel permission . A UNHCR official conceded privately , however , that the agency interpreted the incident as an attempt by the Bosnian Serbs to keep potential hostages within their grasp . Real as such dangers are , what will bring short-term relief to Sarajevo , if it comes , will be the punishing potential of NATO air_attacks . NATO has amassed more_than 200 combat aircraft and a flotilla of warships around the Adriatic_Sea in its biggest show of force since the 1991 allied strike against Iraq . Alliance officials have not said publicly when and how they would strike against recalcitrant Bosnian Serb gunners who defied the 1 a.m. Monday ( 4 p.m. Sunday PST ) deadline for withdrawal . But senior Western military officials have indicated that they might target command_posts , ammunition bases and other strategic sites as well as the heavy artillery emplacements retained in defiance of the withdrawal order . Such strikes would likely do more to shackle the Bosnian Serb war machine than would direct hits at artillery , because communications with rebel commanders throughout Bosnia would be frustrated and vital lines of supply broken . If Monday ' s deadline does_in fact bring an acceptable level of Bosnian Serb compliance without allied air strikes , the next critical period is expected to come_in late March , as the spring thaws and longer hours make fighting easier and as the U.N. peacekeeping mandates in both Bosnia and Croatia are up for renewal . The Clinton_Administration , congressional sources and other experts all predict a series of violations before there is any significant or lasting progress on a peace settlement . After an interval , in this view , the Bosnian Serbs will resume their cat-and-mouse game of testing U.N. resolve by secretly moving weapons back near Sarajevo and resuming the bombardment . For their part , the Muslims are equally unlikely to use the long-awaited end to fighting in the Bosnian capital to seek a settlement . Western government leaders have been saying for months that they want a viable Bosnian state to emerge from partitioning talks underway in Geneva . But an apparently successful U.N. ultimatum will embolden the Muslim forces to go_on the offensive in an effort to recover more territory , it is believed . &quot; During the past six months , Muslims and Croat forces have initiated much of the combat in Bosnia , and that ' s not likely to change , regardless of the action to secure Sarajevo , &quot; the congressional source noted . Muslim troops were considered elite in the army of the former Yugoslav federation , according to U.S. officials . They are also more numerous . Bosnian Serb forces have been able to seize large sectors of Bosnia largely because of vastly superior armaments and disorganization among the Muslims . The Muslims have carried_out an effective reorganization of their forces and , while almost completely lacking in heavy_weapons , have plenty of small arms and ammunition . &quot; With their superior numbers , the Muslims now have a chance to dominate on the ground . And there are sections of greater Sarajevo and other areas of Bosnia that they might try to take_to enhance the size of their region , &quot; Khalilzad said . The wild card is the Croatians . On the one hand , Croatia holds the key to a major Muslim demand -- access to the Adriatic_Sea for the landlocked state . But Bosnian Croats have also been losing territory to the Muslims in recent weeks , leading Croatia to dispatch its troops into Bosnia . Well in excess of 5 # 000 Croatian troops have joined their ethnic brethren to fight Muslim forces . And although the Croatian-Serbian front has been comparatively quiet recently , it remains highly unstable . The Clinton_Administration , congressional sources and U.S. experts all anticipate some kind of renewed fighting to sort_out the boundaries of a larger Serbia and a more abbreviated Croatia . &quot; We ' ve decided to use a large cannon to secure a small target because the target -- Sarajevo -- is important . But there ' s a great_deal more of Bosnia to worry about . The current arrangements are not likely to either stabilize or eliminate this problem , &quot; another congressional source said .
