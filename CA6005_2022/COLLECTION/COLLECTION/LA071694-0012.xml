   <HEADLINE> LEPROSY NEARLY ERADICATED , AFRICA CLINIC TO TURN TO TB ; MEDICINE : ETHIOPIAN HOSPITAL ADJACENT TO LEPER COLONY WILL TARGET TUBERCULOSIS , CLOSELY LINKED TO AIDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Awol Ahemed never noticed the patch of discolored skin on his arm , and only after his left_hand had grown so numb that he could pick_up a chunk of burning charcoal without feeling pain did he accept the awful truth : God had cursed him . Gradually his hand became frozen in a claw-like position . Without pain as a protector , his fingers were constantly burned , cut and bruised and started to slowly wear_away . Ulcers formed . And like everyone else with leprosy , Awol became an outcast , destined to forage for food and live alone in his Wollo province village . A year ago Awol made his way to Addis Ababa , where he heard there was a hospital that would not turn him away . At the least , he had heard , he would be given soap , Vaseline , food . And near the hospital , people said , there was a huge leper colony where he would have to endure neither the stares nor the stigma of a disease scorned since biblical times . The hospital he came_to was the All-African Leprosy and Rehabilitation Training Center ( ALERT ) , on 600 acres of lush grounds outside the Ethiopian capital . In operation since 1965 , it is the only pan-African treatment facility for leprosy and is adjacent to the world ' s largest leper colony , a ghastly village where 25 # 000 Africans -- all lepers and their dependents -- live without electricity , toilets or running water . &quot; Even my wife and children did not want to be close to me , &quot; Awol said . &quot; No one in my family ever had this disease , so it is clear God cursed me for some reason . Why , I do not know. &quot; For Awol , who is healing now after an operation to remove part of his hand , it is small consolation that the disease that has afflicted and deformed many millions of people , particularly in Africa and on the Asian subcontinent , is about to be defeated by modern medicine . &quot; Leprosy is dying as a disease , &quot; said Neil Alldred , ALERT ' s executive_director . &quot; It ' s been knocked_on its head -- finished as a threat -- by two drugs . By the year 2000 , the World_Health_Organization says , leprosy should be eliminated as a public health problem. &quot; Dapsone , discovered in 1940 , was effective in controlling the symptoms of leprosy but required lifelong use . The real breakthrough came_in 1982 , when two new drugs taken_in pill form , Clofazimine and Rifampicin , were proved capable of stopping leprosy , even in advanced cases . ALERT recently abandoned a 20-year survey of patients who suffered relapses after using the drug because the relapse rate is virtually nil . &quot; There just wasn ' t anything to study , &quot; Alldred said . Since the drugs came_into widespread use , ALERT ' s caseload of patients with active leprosy has dropped from 23 # 000 to 1 # 200 . Despite popular beliefs , leprosy is not hereditary and is not passed_by touching an open sore . It is a germ that destroys the nerves , usually in the hands or feet , and is spread when a leper coughs or sneezes or otherwise spreads the bacteria . A healthy body exposed to the germ will reject it with no ill effects . Of the world ' s 2.5 million lepers , almost all are in India and Africa . The vast majority live_in unsanitary conditions and have inadequate diets and weak immune_systems -- characteristics that have made leprosy a disease of poverty . The fact that leprosy is about to be eliminated as a health threat does not mean ALERT will soon close its 200-bed hospital or its training and rehabilitation center . The presence of the leper shantytown alone , Alldred said , is a daily reminder of medical failure -- and of all that needs to be done to remove the stigma from the disease , treat the deformed and train the cured for some useful role in society . ALERT will , however , change its emphasis and will deal primarily with tuberculosis , a disease closely associated with AIDS . First priority will be given to lepers with TB because the center would be inundated if it opened its doors to everyone who suffers from tuberculosis . Five months ago the government estimated that 300 # 000 Ethiopians were HIV-positive . Last month it revised its estimate to 588 # 000 . One reason for the higher figure : The end of a decade-long civil_war has enabled more Ethiopians to reach clinics , which in turn report cases that previously went undetected . Still , medical_care remains so primitive that 55 % of Ethiopians must walk for at least one day to reach the nearest clinic . The government ' s new budget allocates only $ 2.10 per Ethiopian for health_care -- and 72 % of that goes_for salaries of medical personnel .</TEXT>
