   <TEXT> Julie Parisien , despite the emotional gulf separating her from her best days , somehow felt obligated to win Saturday ' s slalom , improbable as her chances were . Obligated to her dead brother , Jean-Paul ; to her sponsors , to herself , to her country . She actually feared no one would speak_to her if she lost , even as defeat loomed as inevitable . Parisien was a shell of the world-class racer she once was , yet there were moments when she still felt_like a champion in her race suit . Maybe , Parisien thought , she could fool herself for a minute or two . She couldn ' t . After posting the 18th-fastest time in the first run , Parisien was disqualified when she straddled the third gate from the finish in the second run at Hafjell . The reality crushed her . Parisien always had an Olympic pain partner in Dan Jansen , the hard-luck American speedskater who shared the burden of winning a medal for a lost sibling . Jansen won his gold last week . Parisien is alone again . &quot; I ' m concerned about my own ( mental ) health a little bit , &quot; Parisien said afterward . &quot; Ski_racing right now hasn ' t been important to me , since my brother died . It ' s tough to be out there when it ' s not important to you. &quot; There was minimal emotion in her voice , no tears . Jean-Paul , Parisien ' s older brother and mentor , was killed Dec . 17 , 1992 , when a drunken driver sideswiped his car and forced it into a tree just a_few miles from the family ' s home_in Auburn , Me . Parisien now says she came_back too racing too soon , only weeks after his death . It might have been the frustration talking , but Parisien , 22 , said she might now retire from World Cup ski_racing , or at least take a long sabbatical . She said she might enroll at the University of Colorado and try the Pro Circuit to make some spending_money . &quot; Right now I ' m at a point , nothing really matters_to me except my own -- not to sound mystical -- but my own spiritual health , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s just ruined right now . Crushed . My whole family is . that ' s just the way it is . &quot; Looking_back , it ' s the Dan Jansens and I who have suffered by going_back into competition , having to go_back the next day and having to race . I don ' t think I gave myself enough time . I ' ve overestimated my strength . &quot; I put too_much store in this race , I really wanted to do something , the final hurrah , whatever. &quot; Parisien has won more World Cup races , three , than any other current U.S. Alpine member . Before her emotional crash , she was considered a gold-medal contender in slalom . But isn ' t it time to get_out of a sport when you ' re standing in the starting_gate , as she was Saturday , thinking , &quot; Wow , I don ' t know about this &quot; ? Parisien wondered . &quot; It ' s the absolute worst thing you can do , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m kind of ashamed at the fact that I ' ve thought that way . Because any athlete who feels that way should get the hell out and give someone else a chance. &quot; Every contemplation was tied to that Dec . 17 . She thought_about quitting last Christmas , around the one-year anniversary of J.P. ' s death . The skier who led the first slalom run at the 1992 Albertville games , only to lose out on a medal by . 05 seconds , was suddenly skiing vacant , posting mediocre results , when she finished at all . Her top finish this season is eighth . &quot; It ' s been coming_on for quite a while , &quot; she said . &quot; A year and a half now . I don ' t blame it on anything , I don ' t say because my brother died , my motivation is gone . I do this for me , too . But maybe I realize that it ' s not making me the person I want to be . You never know . I might be hit by a drunk driver tomorrow , and I don ' t want feel this way if it ' s my last day. &quot; Parisien criticized the U.S. ski team , claiming it does not know how to produce world-class athletes . This , as the U.S. concludes one of its most successful Olympics ever in Alpine , with two gold and two silver medals . &quot; I think the ski team needs to revamp their whole structure and do some major changes , with the way they manage athletes , &quot; Parisien said . &quot; The coaching staff , they need to think_about us a little more. &quot; Yet it was Parisien , in a break from team policy , who was allowed to train with a personal coach earlier this season , a plan that was scrapped in December . Her comments did not sit well with Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director . &quot; We ' ve walked away with two gold and two silver and an athlete starts criticizing the team ? &quot; Major said . &quot; She should look_at herself in the mirror . that ' s the place she needs to begin. &quot; Parisien had only kind words to say about Major , but he thought that a bit incongruous . &quot; I ' m the Alpine director , &quot; Major said . &quot; I should be included ( in the criticism ) . I ' m the management . Who ' s there to blame ? If there ' s bad results , I ' m the one to blame . And I ' ll take full credit for not skiing well today . But I ' ll take some credit for those golds. &quot; Major was eager to speak with Parisien for further clarification . She wants to ski on the Pro Circuit ? &quot; It ' s for has-beens and people that never made_it on the World Cup , &quot; he said . &quot; She could be an overall champion on the World Cup . You can ' t just take one race and turn that into your career. &quot; Major , who also serves as the women ' s coach , understands the emotional burden she carries . He wants Parisien back , but warned that leaving the program was sort of like jumping_off a tiger . There is no easy way back on . &quot; She ' s as_good_as Pernilla ( Wiberg ) or Vreni ( Schneider ) , but you ' ve got_to meet that standard , &quot; he said . &quot; And right now , that standard is very high. &quot; Major said Parisien was not in great physical condition this season , but he wrote it off to extenuating circumstances . He agrees that Parisien should take some time_off , but said she needs to get her priorities straight . &quot; If you want to be_on that board in the top three , you pretty much have to give 100 % of your life to it , &quot; he said , pointing to the Olympic scoreboard . &quot; You can ' t sort of say , ' Oh , I ' m going_to college on the side. ' She ' s talented , she can go_to college and be successful in academics . But the three girls up there ( on the podium ) aren ' t worrying about their academics right now. &quot; Parisien isn ' t sure of her next step . &quot; I may be talking_out_of my armpit , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m so volatile. &quot; She might ski at the World Cup races at Mammoth Mountain early next month . After that , it ' s anyone ' s guess . &quot; To not do_it when you know you can be at the top , it ' s a joke , a waste of talent , &quot; Parisien said . &quot; I know that . I need a break . It ' s so hard to explain . All of this isn ' t as important as it used to be. &quot;</TEXT>
