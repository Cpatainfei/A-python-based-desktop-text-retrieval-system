   <HEADLINE> CALLS TO O.C. , L.A. ' S ABUSE HOT LINES SOAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the violent saga of O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson unfolds , men and women are flooding domestic violence hot_lines with questions about their own relationships . &quot; A lot of women are calling the shelter saying , ' Maybe this is as serious as I thought ; that when he says he ' s going_to kill me , it ' s real , ' &quot; said Jan Tyler , director of the Human Options Shelter in south Orange County . Calls there have tripled since transcripts were released Wednesday of Nicole Brown Simpson ' s October call to 911 , Tyler said . &quot; It seems the more this unwinds , the more the phones start ringing , &quot; said Andrea Thompson Adam , hot-line coordinator for the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women , where calls are up 80 % . The commission ' s hot_line usually fields about 1 # 300 calls a month . &quot; The women say , ' If it could happen to Nicole , it could happen to me . . . . ' The men say things like , ' I ' ve pushed my wife before . Does this mean I ' m a batterer ? ' It ' s really shaken the tree , &quot; Thompson Adam said . According to the Los Angeles County Domestic Violence Council , the county ' s other 18 hot_lines for battering victims have reported increased calls and higher attendance at support groups . Since the murders of Nicole Simpson and her friend , Ronald Lyle Goldman , increasingly graphic details of the Simpsons ' stormy relationship have emerged . He was convicted of misdemeanor spousal battery in 1989 after beating his then-wife so severely that she required hospitalization . On Wednesday , as O.J. Simpson awaited trial in the slayings , police released the 911 transcript . On the tape , which has been broadcast nationwide , she could be heard pleading for help because Simpson was breaking_down her door . The increase in calls to hot_lines is the result of the unusual exposure of Nicole Simpson ' s experiences and people identifying with her , said Patricia Occhiuzzo Giggans , executive_director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women . &quot; They ' re seeing their lives played_out on TV -- the intimidation , how fearful they are , how they keep the guy close to control his anger and abuse , how they almost accommodate him in some ways , especially when children are involved , &quot; Giggans said . At least half the callers volunteer that the Simpson case inspired them to call and more callers than before are using the words domestic violence to describe their situation , staffers said . The calls started to increase Monday and have continued to rise . Derith Mason , who works_on the hot_line at the Women ' s Transitional Living Center , the largest shelter for battered women in Orange County , said most of the callers have been asking how to get restraining orders , which Nicole Brown Simpson didn ' t have . Some of the callers worried that the media coverage would spur renewed attacks , she said . &quot; One woman said , ' My batterer ' s been away for four months and , seeing all this O.J. stuff on the news , I think he ' s going_to come_back at me , ' &quot; said Mason , who has been handling a minimum of 30 % more calls since the slayings . Bill Harris , who runs counseling groups in Fullerton and Long_Beach for men who batter women , said his phones also have been deluged with calls , most from men concerned about their behavior . Some past group members also have shown_up , worried about backsliding , he said . &quot; Two people who hadn ' t shown_up in awhile were back this week , &quot; Harris said . The publicity given the Simpson case also has motivated some women to take the first_step to addressing long-term abuse . Roz Wolpert , a volunteer counselor at Santa Monica ' s Sojourn , a multi-service program for battered women , recalled one woman who said she had been in a battering relationship for seven years . &quot; She told me the only reason she was finally calling is what ' s happening on the news , &quot; Wolpert said . &quot; I was beside myself , I was so happy that something good could come from this. &quot; But for some callers , the details of the Simpsons ' turbulent relationship have triggered flashbacks to previous traumas . &quot; They say , ' This is making me scared , the Simpson thing . . . . ' Some said they wanted to leave the area , &quot; said Tyler of Human Options . The calls have come from all parts of the region and beyond . Many have been referred to multicultural hot_lines and shelters with programs that are tailored to the callers ' ethnicity and are conducted in their native language . Most of the recent callers are women but the counselors have also received calls from men , a_few of whom say they have been battered and some of whom wonder if they are batterers . &quot; A lot of times people don ' t honestly recognize what this behavior is . It ' s learned behavior , &quot; Thompson Adam said . Some people may have grown_up with violence in their home or neighborhood , where they heard men say , &quot; You have to slap ' em every once in a while to keep ' em in_line , &quot; she said . &quot; People believe that , even though it ' s just a joke. &quot; Counselors said potential batterers might ask themselves questions such_as : Am I controlling ? Do I expect her to conform_to my time schedule and list of priorities ? Do I have her call_in and report to me ? One counselor suggests that batterers try to see themselves realistically by tape-recording themselves as they lose their temper and then listening to the tape in a calmer moment . They can also call a hot_line without having to identify themselves or explain their entire story . One episode does not make an abuser , Thompson Adam said . &quot; But you have to be careful and recognize this episode for whatever it is. &quot; Counselors at the Commission on Assaults Against Women identified a three-stage &quot; cycle of abuse &quot; : the tension-building stage , when the victim feels as if she has to &quot; walk on eggshells &quot; ; the violent or abusive stage that consists_of anything from verbal abuse to a slap across the face to being beaten in front of the children ; the honeymoon stage , a tender , making-up period that may include sex or , for the wealthy , &quot; something from Tiffany ' s. &quot; In many cases , the honeymoon stage eventually fades_away , they said . In those cases , counselors tell women there are three ways_out : He leaves and stays gone , you leave and he lets you stay gone , or somebody dies . Counseling may work , but they advise women not to rely_on it . Victims need to ask themselves if they have found outlets to talk_about the violence , or if they need to call the police . &quot; There isn ' t any easy advice , &quot; Thompson Adam said . However , counselors often advise women to make an escape plan in conjunction with a local hot_line . &quot; Every woman has to evaluate her own situation . What works for one woman may_not work for another . A woman in one situation may be able to leave the first time , where another could suffer severe repercussions as a result . Only they can know when is the best time for them to get out. &quot; * Times staff writer Tracy Weber contributed to this report .</TEXT>
