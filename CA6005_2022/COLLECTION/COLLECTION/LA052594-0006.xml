   <TEXT> I put this question before you : Try to name another woman , past or present , who equals Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in dignity , class , grace , style or elegance . It is the combination that cannot be equaled.She was not the first to bear an unimaginable tragedy , but she was the first to bear it within the arena of a world stage , and we were better as a nation by her bearing . She brought dignity , honor and respect_to us when we were floundering in the mires of horror . We will never be the same because she raised us up a_few notches . She leaves with us her mark . Thank God . JUDITH L . STEINBERG Hermosa Beach The death of the journalist , book editor , patron_saint of American art and mother Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis requires acknowledgment that we have lost the best of her generation . She was more heroic than any Greek tragedy . In a style that was uniquely her own , she helped heal a nation long ago in the cold winds of November . Her intelligence , grace and dignity under duress will not be seen again , or soon forgotten . Even in her leaving us , because we were always too selfish to let her be , she chose to overlook the springtime bouquet of her beloved Central_Park ; what style . May God and the people of this nation bless her , for she has blessed us all by her too brief presence . We bid her farewell , rest and the peace that a nation could not grant her . We are truly sorry . OSCAR E . STREETER JR . Altadena Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis : Now all_the interesting people are gone . MAGGIE WICKMAN Studio City</TEXT>
