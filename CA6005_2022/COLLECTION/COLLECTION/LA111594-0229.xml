   <HEADLINE> MICROSOFT GETS INTO ON-LINE DERBY WITH NEW SERVICE ; TECHNOLOGY : GATES SAYS NETWORK WILL MAKE IT EASIER AND CHEAPER FOR COMPUTER USERS TO GET ACCESS TO ALL THAT INFORMATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Microsoft Corp . Chairman Bill Gates on Monday formally presented his concept of the electronic community : an on-line service_called Microsoft Network that he hopes will do for the booming information-access business what Windows did for technophobic computer users . At a luncheon for reporters and industry_analysts at the Comdex computer trade show here , Gates said the new service &quot; will make_it easy and inexpensive &quot; for users to browse the Internet , send electronic_mail and call_up news and other information . It will be launched as part of Microsoft ' s new personal_computer operating system , Windows 95 , which is scheduled to ship by June . Although Microsoft has become the dominant player in the PC universe by selling stand-alone software , Gates sees the industry ' s future hinging on innovative communications and information services that go beyond anything now offered on the emergent information superhighway . &quot; It ' s not just movies on demand , it ' s not just computing , &quot; Gates said in his keynote_speech here . By 2005 , he said , communications , interactive commerce , interactive entertainment and computer-assisted delivery of health_care and other government services will fundamentally change the way people live , and the PC industry as it is known today will seem like a quaint relic . But Microsoft intends to use its dominance of the PC software industry today to help it carve out a big role in the information industry of tomorrow . The Microsoft Network , previously known in the industry by its code name Marvel , will play a central role in that strategy -- and on-line competitors are understandably nervous . Buyers of Windows 95 will be able to subscribe directly to the service with the click of a mouse , and they will have ready access to customer support . That could give the Redmond , Wash. , company a big advantage in winning market share from rivals such_as CompuServe , Prodigy and America Online . Competitors are already taking action . Prodigy , a venture of IBM Corp . and Sears , Roebuck &amp; Co. , last month reduced prices and improved its Internet offerings . America Online of Vienna , Va. , hopes to induce some of its &quot; content providers , &quot; including magazine_publishers and TV networks , to agree to exclusive arrangements . Some analysts say Microsoft ' s entry could end_up being be a boon to the entire on-line industry . Andy Bose , a vice_president of Link Resources , a New York consulting firm , says Microsoft ' s marketing savvy and marketplace strength will probably result in more innovation , reinvigorating demand for on-line services . That , in turn , should help create a far bigger market for the services , which Gates said has been hampered by arcane &quot; user_interfaces &quot; and a lack of compelling offerings . By year-end , Bose estimates , on-line subscriptions will total 5.4 million , a number Microsoft expects to double or quadruple in quick order . But Bose added that the company will have to be careful for antitrust reasons , since its network will clearly gain from the near-monopoly position enjoyed by Windows . The Justice_Department has already delayed Microsoft ' s proposed acquisition of Intuit Inc. , the innovative leader in personal finance software that could be an important service provider on the Microsoft Network . Russell Siegelman , Microsoft ' s general_manager of on-line services , noted that Windows 95 users will be able to choose any on-line service and won ' t be limited to Microsoft Network . He added that America Online and others have &quot; all kinds of ways to distribute &quot; their services , including free trial diskettes contained in many computer magazines . Key to Microsoft ' s initial success , Siegelman said , will be a low monthly fee and a low hourly connection fee for users . ( He declined to provide specifics , but industry observers have speculated that Microsoft ' s fee will be perhaps half the $ 8 to $ 10 that other companies charge per month for basic service. ) AT &amp; T will provide telecom access for the network , and Digital Equipment was selected to provide computer support . In the end , though , the key will be content . Siegelman said Microsoft is offering newspaper and magazine_publishers and other information companies very generous terms , including freedom to set prices and to determine how their products will look_on line . Still , many content providers are wary of Microsoft ' s power and are reportedly driving a hard bargain .
