   <HEADLINE> SPOTLIGHT ; DOWN BUT NOT OUT ; BASEBALL FANS DON ' T HAVE THE ANGELS , BUT THEY HAVE OPTIONS THAT ARE IN THE BALLPARK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All around the newsroom last Saturday , TVs were tuned to baseball . There were cheers when the hometown team tied it up , groans when they fell_back behind , gasps when a late-inning home_run put them back within one . With all_the attention , you might have thought it was the World_Series . And it was -- the Little_League World_Series , Northridge versus Maracaibo , Venezuela . These kids were good , but hey , they were still just kids . Yes , the major_leagues ' strike continues , reaching day 22 today and leaving some baseball fans more_than a little desperate . More_than 200 games have been missed , and if things keep moving ( or not moving ) as predicted , most if not all_of the remaining season will be wiped_out . Public_opinion seems to view both sides , the players and the owners , with equal disgust . It was a high-flying season until the walkout , with home_runs on a record pace and many star players having career seasons . Just like that , it was over , and for seemingly arcane reasons that have left most fans crying foul . The strike hit the same day the exhibition football_season started , so some made a relatively painless switch -- as long as there ' s a ball involved , they ' re happy . But die-hard fans of the great American pastime may be having more of a problem with the season ' s premature demise . The lack of baseball -- a national ritual as much as it is a game -- has left a void , and OC Live ! has a_few suggestions for filling it . Minor Diversions If there has been a winner in this strike , it is the minor_league system , which has reaped plenty of attention ( including newspaper features like this one ) touting it as an alternative to the stalled major_leagues ' seasons . All the publicity couldn ' t have come at a better time for the newly uptown Class A California League . The Lake Elsinore Storm ( an Angels affiliate ) has a new $ 19-million stadium with 6 # 800 seats , a sunken field and a roofed concourse that evokes a turn-of-the-century ballpark . The Epicenter , year-old home of the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes , cost a cool $ 20 million . Because of the relatively low ticket prices ( $ 3 general admission to $ 6 box_seats ) , minor-league games are whole-family affairs . And the action on the field isn ' t the only thing that ' s in an entirely different league than what you find at Dodgers and Angels games . At a Lake Elsinore Storm game last weekend , for instance , patrons jockeyed for prizes between innings : Dancers shimmied atop the dugouts , with the crowd ' s cheers determining the winner ; amateur golfers chipped whiffle balls at a pin held by the team ' s dinosaur mascot ; two men spun until they were dizzy , then ran a woozy footrace . Meanwhile , families spread blankets on the hilly lawn section , and kids did somersaults down the grass . Some even watched the game . The regular minor_league season winds to a close Sunday , but there are a_few remaining chances to catch games near Orange County . Ticket prices top out at $ 6 for the chance to see young ballplayers hustling to make an impression on big_league managers and scouts . Attendance has been strong this season , so it ' s not a bad idea to call ahead . * Lake Elsinore Storm : There ' s one home stand left , Friday through Sunday against the Riverside Pilots . The first two games start at 7:05 p.m. , the Sunday game at 5:05 p.m. ; ticket prices are $ 2.50 to $ 5 . Games are played_at the Diamond , on Diamond Drive just off Interstate 15 . Information : ( 714 ) 245-4487 . * Riverside Pilots : The Pilots , affiliated with the Seattle Mariners , have one home_game left , tonight against the Storm . Game time is 7:15 p.m. , and tickets range from $ 2 to $ 5 . The game will be played_at the Riverside Sports Center , 1000 Blaine St . Information : ( 909 ) 276-3352 . * Rancho Cucamonga Quakes : A San Diego Padres affiliate , the Quakes close_out their home season tonight at 7:05 p.m. against the High Desert Mavericks of Adelanto . Tickets are $ 3 to $ 6 . The Epicenter is_on Stadium Way ( off Foothill Boulevard ) . Information : ( 909 ) 481-5252 . League of Their Own &quot; I like baseball more_than softball . I grew_up playing in the streets with the boys , &quot; says Lee Ann Morretino . But when it came_to playing for organized teams , she never really had a choice . &quot; I had to follow that ' baseball is for boys , softball is for girls ' thing , &quot; she says . That has changed . Morretino is now the player-manager of the Edge , one of three Orange County teams in the new Women ' s National Adult Baseball Assn . Here in the county , the league kicked_off last Sunday with three games . Teams from the South Bay area of Los Angeles County joined in , including Pepper ' s Peaches , managed by Pepper Davis and featuring several actresses from the film &quot; A League of Their Own , &quot; about the wartime exploits of a women ' s professional_baseball league . The success of that film is what inspired the new women ' s recreational league , said Jim Moore , Orange County president of the National Adult Baseball Assn. , which started in 1986 as a men-only league . Now there are 44 men ' s teams in the county , including some with former college and minor_league players . Getting the women ' s league off the ground locally was a challenge , Moore said . But now that the season has started , it ' s getting attention , and he expects that to translate to more players . &quot; We hope to add some more teams , &quot; Moore says . &quot; We ' re really looking_for teams and players. &quot; Morretino , who played last year on the Rancho Santiago College softball team , says she is having a lot of fun . &quot; With the leading_off and the stealing , it ' s a blast . It ' s a little more challenging &quot; than softball . There ' s something for spectators too , she says . &quot; We ' re not inhibited at all , so there ' s a lot of action going_on all_the time , &quot; she says . &quot; They were good &quot; on Sunday , adds Moore . &quot; We had a pretty good little crowd_out there. &quot; The league accepts all ability levels ( players must be at least 18 ) . For information on both women ' s and men ' s leagues , call ( 714 ) 996-2763 . Games are played Sundays at 9 a.m. , noon and 3 p.m. at Pacifica High_School in Garden Grove ; spectators are admitted free . All-Star Weekend Some of the best high_school players in the world will converge on Long_Beach this weekend , playing the ninth annual Goodwill Series in lovely Blair Field . The three-day tournament , opening Saturday , features all-star teams from Korea , Japan and the United States . How ' s the level of play ? &quot; In my experience , it would be equal_to Class A over in the California League , &quot; said Bob Williams , president of the Santa Rosa-based Goodwill Series Inc. , organizers of the tournament . &quot; They would be very competitive in Division I college ball. &quot; OK , so Williams has a vested_interest . But he is able to point to some high-profile alumni , including Matt Williams of the Giants , Gregg Jeffries of the Cardinals and John Wetteland of the Expos . Chan Ho Park , who started the current season with the Dodgers , played for the 1991 Korean team at the event and was &quot; discovered &quot; there by Dodger scouts . ( He will make an appearance at this year ' s tournament , at noon on Saturday. ) So , what it boils_down to is this : If you can ' t watch the stars of today , come check_out the possible stars of tomorrow . Orange County is represented by one player on this year ' s 20-player U.S. team , Eric Valent of Canyon High_School in Anaheim . All the U.S. players are juniors , selected through a recent national tournament , the Area_Code Games . Here ' s the schedule : Saturday , it ' s Korea vs . the United States at 12:30 p.m. and Korea vs . Japan at 3:30 p.m. Sunday , the U.S. team will play Japan at 12:30 p.m. and Korea at 3:30 p.m. In the final games , the United States and Japan will play Monday at 12:30 p.m. , and Korea and Japan will meet at 3:30 p.m. Tickets for all games are $ 5 and will be sold at the gate ( children under 12 get_in free ) . Blair Field is near Wilson High_School in Long_Beach ; from the San Diego ( 405 ) Freeway , head west on Seventh Street , then turn right on Park_Avenue . Playing the Game Clyde Wright put_in 10 years as a major_league pitcher , including a stint with the Angels . &quot; I missed it from the day I walked_out_of it , &quot; he says now . &quot; I wish I could still play , but there ' s a certain thing called old_age that catches_up_with you. &quot; So , for 15 years , Wright has done the next best thing to playing -- teaching others to play , specifically , to pitch . &quot; We work_on the curve , the change-up , everything , &quot; he says . &quot; I start the kids at 9 years old , and they go_on from there. &quot; It ' s not just the youngsters , though . He ' s had students up_to 47 years old , getting ready for spring fantasy baseball camps . So , for those baseball fans who always dreamed of some time on the mound but figured their glory days were behind them , there ' s still a chance to rear_back and toss a_few , with the help of a pro . The skills learned could come_in_handy , with the growing number of recreational baseball_leagues . Wright teaches on a pair of practice mounds at_Home Run Park in Anaheim , a privately run park with batting_cages and a large baseball shop with more_than 1 # 000 bats for_sale . His school is one of several operated throughout Orange County ( just check the Yellow Pages under baseball schools ) ; Don Aase is another former Angel who operates a local pitching school , in Anaheim Hills . Enrolling in pitching school requires a commitment of time and money . Wright , for instance , charges $ 250 , which covers one one-hour meeting a week for eight weeks ( there are two students per session ) . The lessons can pay_off , however : One of Wright ' s longtime students just signed a contract with the Cleveland Indians . &quot; He made more money signing than I did_in 10 years of playing , &quot; Wright says . But there are no hard feelings . The young prospect is Wright ' s son , Jaret , a pitcher out of Katella High_School . Baseball fans who would rather work_on their swing than their slider , or just work_out their frustration over the shortened season , can drop into one of the many public batting_cages throughout the county . Most offer a variety of pitching machines set to speeds from about 40 m.p.h. up_to major league-level heat ( there are also slow-pitch softball machines ) . You can put_in a handful of quarters for a set number of pitches , on those quick visits , or pay a flat fee for a more substantial chunk of time . Most facilities loan bat and helmet for free . Memory Lane Where have you gone , Joe DiMaggio ? The musical question grows even more poignant as yet another labor dispute further tarnishes the image of the Grand Old Game . Baseball fans yearning for a visit with DiMaggio and other stars of yesteryear , and hoping perhaps for a nostalgic return to childhood passions , can check_out a sports card and memorabilia shop -- almost as ubiquitous on the Orange County landscape as frozen_yogurt franchises . Here , the cards you cavalierly obliterated in your bike spokes as a kid are gingerly preserved in plexiglass frames . Prices on the real rarities can exceed the players ' lifetime batting_averages . The browsing is fun , and even if you don ' t feel_like buying , chances are you ' ll at least find someone to commiserate with about the strike . Before the walkout , interest in cards of such hot current stars as Ken Griffey Jr . was riding high , according to Tim Stone , manager of Whiz Kids , a card and memorabilia shop in Costa Mesa . But when the strike hit , much of the collector interest drifted to the coming pro football_season . Still , the market for cards of past baseball stars remains steady . &quot; That never stops , &quot; Stone says . &quot; Interest in the older cards is still high. &quot; A Day in the Park Anaheim Stadium holds some memories , even if most of them are frustrating ones . There ' s no baseball there at the moment , but that doesn ' t have to rule_out a visit . The stadium ( which , alas , was a much nicer baseball park before it was partially enclosed for the Rams ) is open daily for tours , except on event days and holidays . Tour times are 11 a.m. , noon , 1 and 2 p.m. Tour stops include the Angels ' dugout , but not their locker_room . Visitors do get_to see the Rams ' locker_room and their cheerleaders ' locker_room , along with the press_box . They also get_to walk_out onto the field , which is currently in its between-seasons state : dirt base paths for baseball , goal posts for football . After Wednesday , tours will also include a stop at the Orange County Sports Hall_of_Fame , which is housed in the stadium near Gate 6 and features a number of former Angels . Officially , the hall_of_fame is open_to the public 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays , but times can be sporadic , so it ' s best to call ahead if you ' re not planning to take the stadium tour . The hall is also open for two hours before events at the stadium . Tours are $ 3 , $ 2 for children 5 to 16 and seniors , free for kids under 5 . For tour information , call ( 714 ) 254-3120 . For information on the hall_of_fame , call ( 714 ) 254-3050 . Road Trip Looking ahead , it will be possible to visit such legendary ballparks as Chicago ' s Wrigley Field and Boston ' s Fenway Park -- along with such minor_league spots as Bakersfield ' s rickety Sam Lynn Field -- all without leaving Fullerton . &quot; Major_League / Minor_League : Photographs of America ' s Baseball Stadiums by Jim Dow , &quot; a traveling exhibition from the Smithsonian , opens at the Fullerton Museum Center Sept . 30 . Dow , who once made prints for the great photographer Walker Evans , made his highly detailed ballpark portraits with a tripod-mounted , large-format view camera , taking his long-exposure photographs both at dusk and in daylight . The exhibition includes text by Times staff writer David Lamb , author of &quot; Stolen Season : A Journey Through America and Baseball ' s Minor Leagues. &quot; &quot; Baseball ' s best ballparks are_full of odd angles and nooks_and_crannies , &quot; Lamb says in a written release . &quot; And , rather than being architectural intruders , they appear to be part of the cityscape. &quot; For now , the major_league parks are a silent part of that cityscape . The Fullerton Museum Center is at 301 N . Pomona Ave . For information on the exhibit , which will run Sept . 30 through Nov . 13 , call ( 714 ) 738-6545 . Looking_Back Finally , the best news of all for dejected fans could be the arrival of &quot; Baseball &quot; -- the long-awaited series on the history of the sport from Ken Burns , creator of the highly praised &quot; Civil War &quot; miniseries . &quot; Baseball &quot; will air in nine two-hour segments on KCET Channel 28 , at 8 p.m. Sept . 18 through 22 and 25 through 28 .</TEXT>
