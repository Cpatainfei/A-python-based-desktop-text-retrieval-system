   <HEADLINE> IN DEVELOPMENT : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; SENSOR MAY BE THE SUSHI SOLUTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sushi sensor : Concern over complaints about illnesses related to eating raw seafood have spurred University of Alaska , Fairbanks , scientists to developing a way to detect parasites that occur naturally in fish . The parasites are not usually harmful in well-cooked fish , but they cause problems when fish is eaten raw or underdone . The parasites are small and extremely difficult to see . Typically , they are found by shining a bright light on a fillet . They show_up as dark spots against the bright background and are removed by hand . This labor-intensive process can account_for half the cost of producing a fillet . The University ' s patented technology uses an electronic sensor that takes_advantage of the natural_ability of fish flesh to conduct electricity . Since a typical cod fillet , for example , is many times better at conducting electricity than parasites are , the parasites show_up as voids in the magnetic_field . The sensor has been tested only on cod and pollock , but it may prove helpful with salmon , whose opaque meat makes the parasites difficult to distinguish . * Bring up the chart : Anyone who has been shuttled from medical_specialist to medical_specialist will appreciate the problem of making_sure the records make the trip as well . First Data Corp. , which already processes information for the credit_card , consumer funds transfer , mutual_funds , receivables management and cable_television industries , thinks it has the answer with its First Empower database for patient information . First Data ' s Health System Group , based in Charlotte , N.C. , designed First Empower to handle not only text , but voices and images as well . This multimedia capability allows the database to contain not only text , but radiology , ultrasound and arteriogram images ; patient photographs , and on-line voice annotation . The display system resembles a typical medical chart . All the doctor has to do is click on one of the &quot; tabs &quot; to bring_up lab test and radiology results , past orders and the_like . First Data , aware of fears that privacy could be compromised , says it is taking elaborate measures to make_sure medical_records go only to those authorized to receive them , and it is taking extra steps_on issues such_as HIV status and pregnancy . First Empower is being tested at several hospitals in the East . * High-tech diapers : If you thought supercomputers were only used for modeling complex phenomena such_as weather patterns or molecular structures , think again . Dow Chemical used a Cray-2 supercomputer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a high-performance Silicon Graphics workstation to test a design for an improved disposable diaper . The design in_question uses Dow ' s Drytech super-absorbent polymer particles distributed in a fluff pad . Much as computers can visualize storms , the numerical results of the diaper tests over time were converted into images and animated to show researchers just what happens inside a baby diaper . The Dow visualizations showed the concentration of liquid and its motion over a period_of_time ( 12 seconds ) using color_codes ranging from violet ( wet ) to brown ( dry ) . The polymer particles were represented as spheres . As the liquid hit the particles , the violet turned brown , so researchers knew that a diaper design for drier bottoms was achieved . No word yet from any babies . * Virtual access : If virtual_reality technology can train airplane pilots , can it also help firms determine whether their facilities are accessible by wheelchair ? While VR equipment is still expensive and often unwieldy , such applications are beginning to emerge . Chicago-based Prairie Virtual Systems Corp . has already developed a program to help architects design wheelchair-friendly buildings . The program lets the user experience a virtual environment from the perspective of a person in a wheelchair . Do doors open correctly ? Are sinks at the right height ? The program was used last summer to test plans for a hospital in Aurora , Ill. , where architects found the sinks protruded too far . These questions will be discussed at the annual &quot; Virtual Reality and Disabilities &quot; conference , sponsored by the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers and Cal State Northridge ' s Center_on Disabilities . It is set for June 8-10 at the San Francisco Airport Marriott Hotel .</TEXT>
