   <HEADLINE> STEADY ECONOMIC GAINS THROUGH ' 96 SEEN ; FINANCE : PRESIDENT ' S ADVISERS PREDICT ANNUAL GROWTH OF 2.5 % TO 3 % WITH RELATIVELY MILD INFLATION AND LOW UNEMPLOYMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s economy will continue its recent pattern of steady growth through the 1996 election year , expanding at an annual rate of 2.5 % to 3 % , with relatively mild inflation and low unemployment , President Clinton ' s top economic advisers predicted Monday . The moderate-growth , low-inflation scenario envisioned by the President ' s economic team would represent &quot; an extremely successful &quot; track record that could boost his chances of being elected to a second term , said Robert E . Rubin , Clinton ' s assistant for economic_policy . Despite the rosy hue of the White_House forecast , the latest economic indicators and current business conditions indicate that &quot; the odds favor it , &quot; Rubin said . The economy expanded at a rate of 3 % during the first_quarter of 1994 and many analysts say that is about as fast as it can grow_over long periods_of_time without rekindling inflation . Rubin acknowledged that the Administration will have to be &quot; watchful &quot; to ensure that the economy does not begin to overheat , thereby putting pressure on prices to rise and prompting the Federal_Reserve_Board to raise interest_rates , potentially choking_off the recovery . Clinton , in an ABC-TV interview , said there is no compelling evidence that a significant increase in inflation is_on the horizon . He said the Federal_Reserve should not raise interest_rates again as long as price increases do not begin to accelerate . The Fed has boosted short-term interest_rates four times since February in an effort to prevent the economy from growing too rapidly . Although the central_bank has not ruled_out additional increases , Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated that he thinks rates have risen enough for now . Speaking_to reporters in a luncheon interview , Rubin and his deputy , Gene Sperling , said they believe that the economy is &quot; on track &quot; to produce the 8 million new jobs that Clinton , in his 1992 presidential campaign , said his economic program would create by 1996 . Sperling said that 3.4 million new jobs , including about 3.1 million in the private sector , were created during Clinton ' s first 16 months in office . Moreover , the job growth continued during the last_quarter despite a significant decline in government spending , a feat that is &quot; almost unprecedented in this century , &quot; he said . Reaching the goal of 8 million new jobs might earn political points for the President , but some economists would not be overly impressed . Allen Sinai , an economist with the Lehman Brothers investment_firm , said Clinton ' s economic team has been &quot; low-balling &quot; its job creation goals . In a typical cyclical recovery , he said , total job creation could be expected to reach 10 million . Clinton ' s target is &quot; well-intentioned but I think it ' s not very much , &quot; said Sinai , who has advised both the Clinton and George_Bush administrations on economic_policy . &quot; If it ' s only 8 million , I could only give them a gentleman ' s ' C. ' &quot; Some Administration officials have lamented the fact that many of the jobs created since the recovery began are temporary or in the service sector , where wages tend to be lower . Rubin , who made a fortune estimated at more_than $ 100 million as a Wall_Street financier , said business_executives clearly respect what the President has done to reduce the federal_deficit . But he said they are not &quot; coalescing &quot; the way he thinks they should around a White_House economic program that is favorable to business . Many business_executives still have reservations about Clinton , Rubin said , noting that some of them are Republicans and apparently have difficulty perceiving any Democrat as pro-business . Instead of looking_at the 70 % of the Clinton economic program that reflects their interests , Rubin said , business_executives tend to &quot; look_at the 30 % they don ' t like , and disregard the art of what is politically doable. &quot; Rubin expressed frustration that despite the growth , Clinton gets relatively little credit from the American people , who , according to polls , have serious reservations about the President ' s character . The character issue , revolving around allegations of womanizing and financial improprieties while Clinton was Arkansas governor , should focus_on his activities since he became President , Rubin said .</TEXT>
