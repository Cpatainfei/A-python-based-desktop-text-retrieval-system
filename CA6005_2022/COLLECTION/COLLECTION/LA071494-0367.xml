   <HEADLINE> 4 PLO OFFICIALS EXPELLED FROM GAZA ; MIDEAST : SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WERE PART OF ARAFAT ' S ENTOURAGE . ISRAEL SAYS THEIR PRESENCE VIOLATED SELF-RULE AGREEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four PLO officials linked by Israeli intelligence to past terrorist attacks were expelled Wednesday from the Gaza Strip after Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin strongly protested their entry as violating the agreement on Palestinian self-government . The four men , two of whom are believed to have planned the 1974 attack on a high_school at Maalot in which 21 Israeli teen-agers were killed , entered the Gaza Strip on Tuesday morning in the entourage of Yasser Arafat , the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman . Israeli officials discovered their presence only hours later . Mordechai Gur , Israel ' s deputy defense minister , accused Arafat and the PLO of deceiving Israel in bringing the four into the Gaza Strip , knowing that Israel objected to their return . &quot; We cannot accept this sort of trickery , &quot; Gur said . &quot; I don ' t have any doubt that ( Arafat ) knew because we made ( their ) names known and said we would not allow them to enter . . . . There is no doubt that Arafat knew about the_matter . We do not accept this , and we will not accept it. &quot; Maj . Gen . Nasser Yusuf , commander of the Palestinian police , acknowledged the four men ' s entry as a violation of the agreement but said the_matter is resolved . &quot; The four tried to get_into Gaza illegally , thinking they would sneak_in with Arafat , &quot; Yusuf said by telephone . &quot; It was illegal , but we solved the problem and it is all over. &quot; For many Israelis , nervous about the character of the emerging Palestinian Authority , this was confirmation that the self-governing areas could quickly turn_into a &quot; terrorist state , &quot; as critics of the autonomy pact have charged . &quot; I am shocked that the Israeli government did not arrest these murderers of children and bring them to justice , &quot; Meir Amrusi , chairman of the Families of the Maalot Martyrs , said of the Palestinians . Dr. Ahmed Tibi , a Jerusalem physician who advises Arafat and serves as an unofficial link for him with top Israeli officials , drove three of the men across the border into Egypt at midday . The fourth left late Wednesday . Rabin , described as &quot; angered and outraged &quot; by the incident , ordered border crossings between the Gaza Strip and Egypt and between the West_Bank and Jordan closed to all PLO members until the four men were sent_back to Egypt . Under the autonomy agreement , Israel retained control of the crossings . &quot; They have to learn this lesson -- they can ' t cheat_on the agreement they signed with us , &quot; Rabin commented . &quot; It is not proper for someone to smuggle these people in the cars accompanying Chairman Arafat. &quot; Arafat requested a &quot; hot_line &quot; that would provide him and Rabin with quick , direct contact in the future so such incidents do not develop and endanger relations between Israel and the new Palestinian Authority . Tibi asserted that there had been no attempt to deceive Israel , that Arafat ' s understanding was that there was a general amnesty for members of the PLO and its affiliates returning under the autonomy accord . &quot; You cannot come and say this man did this in the past -- an agreement has been signed so that these things will not happen in the future , &quot; Tibi said . &quot; Those who committed these deeds now support the peace process. &quot; Three of the four belong_to the Palestinian Democratic Federation , a moderate PLO faction . &quot; These people came_to build_up peace , and they are not coming_to wage a war against Israel , &quot; the federation said in a statement . &quot; It is their right to return . The Israelis do not want to forget the past. &quot; But Yossi Sarid , Israel ' s dovish environment minister , said the amnesty could not be stretched to cover these four . &quot; We are talking_about two men who were involved in one of the most terrible and difficult events , the Maalot massacre , &quot; Sarid said . &quot; That is why we think they should not now be entering the self-rule areas. &quot; Tibi said the four had deposited their passports with Israeli border authorities when they arrived in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday &quot; proving there was no intention to smuggle them in &quot; as Israeli officials contended . Israel was not acting in good_faith by letting_in some PLO officials and barring others , Tibi said . &quot; This is explicitly in violation of the spirit of the agreement , &quot; he added . Israel also objected to the return of 13 other Palestinians who accompanied Arafat on grounds of their past activities , but agreed to allow them to remain in Gaza after all-night negotiations . Israeli media , quoting intelligence and police sources , identified the two men involved in the Maalot attack as Mamdouh Nofal , alleged mastermind of the operation , and Nihad Jayousi . An Israeli soldier , a family of three and two Arab women as well as the three Palestinian guerrillas from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine also died in the incident . According to press accounts , Israel also objected to the presence of Mustafa Liftawi ( Abu Firas ) , onetime head of the PLO ' s &quot; Western Sector &quot; intelligence group in Beirut that planned dozens of operations against Israel . The fourth was identified as Jihad Amarneh , also an official of the Western Sector .</TEXT>
