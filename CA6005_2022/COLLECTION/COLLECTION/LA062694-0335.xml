   <HEADLINE> HIKING : CENTRAL COLORADO : BRISTLING WITH ' FOURTEENER FEVER '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sculpted and stunted by wind and ice_crystals , ancient bristlecone_pines persevere in places where lesser conifers fail . In the central Colorado Rockies , about a 1 1 / 2-hour drive southwest of Denver , and just south of Breckenridge , a preserve protects a grove of Pinus_aristata , trees known to live for 2 # 000 years . Bristlecone Pine National Scenic Area , established by the U.S. Forest Service in 1964 , is a great place to visit these Methuselahs of the plant world . The bristlecones manage to survive at an elevation of 11 # 500 feet on well-named Windy Ridge . The winds from which the ridge gets its name sometimes reach speeds of 100 m.p.h. When you visit the trees , note their wind-influenced growth pattern : few buds and new branches are_on the trees ' windward_sides , and what branches there are seem bare and worn . Those bristlecones braving Windy Ridge itself are severely stunted while those in the slightly more sheltered environment below the ridge reach 25 to 30 feet tall . Windy Ridge is also the trail head for the hike to Mt . Bross , the 22nd highest summit in the state at 14 # 172 feet . The rotund peak offers a challenging day hike because of its high altitude , though experienced hikers will probably judge it a relatively mild climb in comparison to treks to the tops of Colorado ' s other 14 # 000-foot peaks . If , like me , you ' re afflicted with &quot; fourteener fever &quot; and absolutely have to scale a_couple_of Colorado ' s 14 # 000-foot summits , note the presence of three more peaks in the vicinity of Mt . Bross : Mt . Lincoln ( 14 # 286 feet ) , Mt . Cameron ( 14 # 238 feet ) and Mt . Democrat ( 14 # 148 feet ) . Experienced hikers ( some off-trail rock scrambling is required ) can bag all four in one long day by heading for the trail head at Kite Lake . From Colorado 9 in the center of Alma , turn west on dirt Kite Lake Road and drive six miles to Kite Lake and the signed trail head . More outdoor fun beckons in Park County , which has more territory above 9 # 000 feet than any other Colorado county . Among the activities are terrific fishing and camping and auto tours to ghost_towns and historic mining towns . Stop at the Pike National Forest office in Fairplay to inquire about local trail and road conditions , and ask_for brochures for the three self-guided driving tours of nearby historical mining areas . Directions to trail head : From Colorado 9 in Alma ( at 10 # 350 feet , the highest incorporated town in North_America and six miles north of Fairplay ) , head uphill ( west ) on Buckskin Gulch Road . Drive 6 1 / 2 miles up the graded dirt road , following the signs to Windy Ridge and the Bristlecone Pines National Scenic Area . A half-mile before the road reaches the bristlecones , it comes_to shallow Dolly Varden Creek . If your car is low slung , park before the creek crossing . If your vehicle has high clearance , forge ahead the last_half mile to the parking_area . The hike : After visiting the bristlecone_pines , you can either head straight up the steep and rocky slopes of Mt . Bross or follow a four-wheel drive road that switchbacks up the mountain . The road climbs two miles or so to the Dolly Varden Mine at 13 # 300 feet . From here , you make your own way up the scree-covered slopes to the flat summit of Mt . Bross . Enjoy the near views of the Mosquito Range -- that part of the Rockies that includes Mt . Bross and its cousins , and more far-reaching views up and down the Continental Divide . Mt . Bross Trail WHERE : Bristlecone Pine National Scenic Area , Pike National Forest , south of Breckenridge , Colo . DISTANCE : 7 miles round_trip from the bristlecones to the top of Mt . Bross with a 2 # 700-foot elevation gain . TERRAIN : Scree-covered peak near Continental Divide . HIGHLIGHTS : Ancient bristlecone_pine groves . DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY : Strenuous because of altitude . PRECAUTIONS : High-altitude hiking and short visitor season ( mid- to late summer ) . FOR MORE INFORMATION : Pike National Forest , South Park Ranger District , P.O.
