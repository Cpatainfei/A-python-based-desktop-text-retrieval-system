   <HEADLINE> U.S. WON ' T PRESSURE ISRAEL TO PULL_OUT OF WEST_BANK ; MIDEAST : JEWISH STATE IS BALKING AT TROOP WITHDRAWAL AFTER TERRORIST ATTACKS . CHRISTOPHER ' S COMMENTS ARE SEEN AS AN ENDORSEMENT OF RABIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , giving Israeli negotiators maximum room to maneuver , said Tuesday that Israel cannot be required to keep its commitment to withdraw its West_Bank occupation force until a spate of terrorist incidents is brought under_control . &quot; The security pledges are absolutely fundamental to the process going_forward , &quot; he said as he arrived in Israel for talks with Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin . &quot; Unless there is security , it is clear that the other commitments cannot be met , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; . . . The fundamental bedrock of these agreements . . . is security for the parties , and without that security , it ' s clear to me that the agreements cannot properly go forward. &quot; In the peace agreement signed_in May by Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat , Israel pledged to pull its troops from Palestinian-populated areas of the West_Bank before elections are held to choose members of the Palestinian self-governing authority . No date has been set for the elections , but Israeli officials have begun to hint that Israel might not keep its agreement to redeploy its army because of growing security concerns resulting from a suicide bus bombing in Tel Aviv ; a bloody battle between the PLO-sponsored Palestinian police and radical Islamic fundamentalists in Gaza , and other terrorist incidents . Christopher ' s comments seemed to be intended as an endorsement of whatever course the Israelis might choose . Washington has exhorted Israel and the PLO to adhere to the agreements signed_on the White_House lawn . But Christopher made_it clear that the United States will not attempt to pressure Israel to withdraw its troops until it is ready to do so . In Cairo , Israeli and PLO negotiators began a new round of talks on details for the election and for Israeli troop redeployment . PLO officials argued that Israel must pull_out its troops on schedule . Nabil Shaath , PLO chief negotiator , said any change in Israeli withdrawal plans will constitute a violation of the peace agreement . &quot; Everything that stops the peace process worries me very much , and this peace process is very clear . It has a time schedule , and anybody who wants to change that will be violating the agreement , &quot; Shaath said . But Rabin told reporters Monday that Israel intends to negotiate separately on each phase of the peace plan and will go_ahead only when its security concerns are satisfied . He said Israel will apply lessons learned in the Gaza Strip to the West_Bank . The Gaza Strip has been under Palestinian control for almost a year , and Israel claims that the Palestinian Authority has been unable to keep order there . Christopher flew to Israel after meeting for 4 1 / 2 hours in Damascus with Syrian President Hafez Assad . Christopher described the talks as &quot; serious and detailed , &quot; and other U.S. officials said they produced tiny but perceptible progress toward an Israel-Syria peace agreement . Top officials in both Syria and Israel have complained recently that their talks , conducted through U.S. mediators , are near a dead_end . Each side accused the other of making unreasonable demands . A senior U.S. official dismissed the comments as &quot; public posturing &quot; but said each side was trying to send a clear signal that it was unable to agree to the demands of the other . In a joint news_conference with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak over the weekend , Assad said Syria prefers the status_quo to the peace that Israel has offered . Apparently reacting to that comment , Christopher said : &quot; We must continue to move forward . There is no going_back . To accept the status_quo would . . . miss a historic opportunity to achieve peace with security -- an opportunity that is not likely to come again. &quot; One senior U.S. official said Christopher decided to visit the Middle_East this week because he was nearby attending a European security conference in Budapest , Hungary . The official indicated that the talks with Assad and Rabin were intended to keep the negotiations going but that no breakthroughs were expected -- or achieved . The original schedule called_for Christopher to return to Damascus on Thursday to report on his talks in Israel . But that stop has been canceled , allowing him to return to the United States on Thursday . Christopher meets with Rabin this morning , then heads to Gaza for talks with Arafat . U.S. officials hope the visit will bolster Arafat ' s sagging authority in the Palestinian-controlled territory , although one senior official conceded that most Palestinians who have soured on Arafat ' s leadership are unlikely to be persuaded by anything the Americans do .</TEXT>
