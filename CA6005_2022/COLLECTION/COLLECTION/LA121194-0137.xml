   <HEADLINE> MILITARY SPENDING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Your editorial , &quot; A Crucial Investment for America &quot; ( Dec . 5 ) , is a replay of the Reagan years for more money for the military . The only difference is that your call_for more money to enable the military to be able to meet assigned missions is different than the fight to stop communism . Why is it that throwing money at the military is always acceptable , but budget_cuts are the only acceptable choice for all social problems ? Why isn ' t $ 270 billion-plus enough for the armed forces ? Why do we need three air_forces ? Why do we need each of the services competing with each other regarding supplies , etc. ? Why do we still have armed forces in Europe ? Why do we need to spend billions of dollars on weapon_systems that in many instances are never used or completed or become obsolete before they are completed ? How much could be saved by an overall review of the military and its methods of squandering billions of dollars ? This review would provide sufficient dollars to meet the assigned missions . MELVIN WEISZ Calabasas * * It is galling that President Clinton , who refuses to use the military to stop the genocide in Bosnia , has the chutzpah to ask_for an increase in military spending . If he trembles so at the thought of sending_in ground troops against a motley force of tenth-rate Serb fascists , then in what situation could he possibly envision using such a newly fortified military ? This request is just one more ( goose ) step to the right for this &quot; liberal &quot; President . RONALD OWEN RICHARDS Los Angeles * * First an editorial , then a Column Left on defense funding ( &quot; $ 1.5 Trillion for Defense Isn ' t Enough ? , &quot; Dec . 6 ) . Living away from home is expensive , even if educational . Congress would not need to find so_much extra money for Defense_Department readiness if it precluded foreign adventures ( Haiti , Somalia ) . This it could do_by specifying that appropriated funds for consumables ( fuel , ammunition , rations ) be expended only at established bases and sea_lanes , unless in time of war or national emergency . It is high_time for the legislative_branch to reassert its proper role in foreign affairs . As things stand , Congress cowers in a shadow whenever the President ( whoever is President ) starts the meter running_on a new enterprise . The power of the purse should be in_play , because the purse is not of infinite capacity . GILBERT S . BAHN Moorpark</TEXT>
