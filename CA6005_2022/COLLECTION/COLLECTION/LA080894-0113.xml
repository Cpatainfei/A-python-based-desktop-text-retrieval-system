   <HEADLINE> SHAKE-UP EXPECTED AT TREASURY_DEPARTMENT ; WHITEWATER : LAWYER WHO GAVE EMBARRASSING TESTIMONY MAY BE FIRST TO GO . WHITE_HOUSE SAYS IT STANDS BY OFFICIALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jean Hanson , the Treasury_Department lawyer who contradicted a senior Clinton_Administration official before a bank of television_cameras , appears likely to become the first casualty of congressional hearings into the Whitewater affair . Before it ' s over , she may have plenty of company . Hanson , the department ' s general counsel , is expected to be pressured to resign by Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen in the near future , according to department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity . &quot; I would not put a lot of money on Hanson staying , &quot; one source said . &quot; Secretary Bentsen is loyal to his staff , but she did not help herself in these hearings. &quot; During two weeks of nationally televised hearings into the Administration ' s handling of the Whitewater controversy , Hanson testified that Deputy Treasury_Secretary Roger Altman had not fully disclosed the history of contacts between White_House officials and savings and loan regulators who were looking_into one aspect of the tangled Whitewater affair . She said Altman instructed her at one point to brief a top White_House official about the status of the case , a directive that Altman said he did not recall . Treasury officials said Hanson ' s performance during the Whitewater hearings has poisoned her relations with Altman , and few in the department believe that the two can continue to work together . &quot; If she does manage to stay , she is going_to have to have a peace summit with Altman , &quot; one senior official said . Even if Hanson decides to step aside , she may be only the first to fall , sources said . The jobs of other senior Treasury officials -- most notably Altman -- remain in jeopardy despite repeated statements of support from President Clinton , according to senior officials at both the White_House and the Treasury_Department . Publicly , at least , the White_House continues to stand_by the team at the department . &quot; We have confidence in the people that serve in this Administration , &quot; White_House Chief_of_Staff Leon E . Panetta said Sunday on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet the Press. &quot; But privately , aides say it seems certain that a major shake-up is in_store at the department as a result of embarrassing disclosures about the department ' s role in relaying information about the S &amp; L probe to the White_House early this year . Top Treasury officials had knowledge of the investigation because the department oversees the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency responsible_for cleaning_up the wreckage of the thrift industry . RTC investigators were trying to determine whether the Whitewater Development Corp. , an ill-fated Ozarks land venture involving the Clintons , contributed to the taxpayer-financed collapse of an Arkansas thrift . The repercussions for the Treasury_Department might even be severe enough to weaken Bentsen ' s stature within the Administration , sources said , perhaps accelerating his long-rumored plans to retire within a year . Moreover , the department ' s fall from grace could raise new questions about the viability and direction of the Clinton agenda in the post-Whitewater period . The department has been at the core of the policy-making process on issues ranging from international trade and deficit reduction to health_care and welfare reform . Adding_to the uncertainty over the Treasury_Department ' s future was the surprise decision of a three-judge panel Friday to replace Robert B . Fiske Jr . as Whitewater independent counsel with Kenneth W . Starr , who was the Justice_Department ' s solicitor_general under President George_Bush . Clinton White_House officials were careful Sunday not to antagonize the new investigator . &quot; I think it ' s a waste of taxpayers ' money , &quot; White_House Counsel Lloyd N . Cutler said on ABC-TV ' s &quot; This Week With David Brinkley , &quot; &quot; But I have every confidence in Starr , and I think that any fair-minded independent counsel is going_to conclude that there ' s not the slightest basis for any criminal charge. &quot; Panetta and Cutler both said they assumed Starr would &quot; review &quot; all_of Fiske ' s work but not necessarily re-investigate those portions of the case -- including whether Treasury officials lied to Congress -- that Fiske had closed . However , Clinton ' s lawyer in a sexual-harassment lawsuit called_on Starr to step_down from the case because of an appearance of &quot; partisanship &quot; against Clinton . Robert S . Bennett said in a Washington Post interview that he had no personal doubts about Starr ' s &quot; intellect and integrity. &quot; But he pointed to Starr ' s recent comments opposing Clinton ' s argument that he is immune as President from being sued by former Arkansas state employee Paula Corbin Jones and to news_reports that Starr had planned to file a friend-of-the-court brief opposing Clinton ' s position . &quot; I think Starr should decline ( the appointment ) , &quot; Bennett said . &quot; I think there is a real appearance of unfairness . If Starr found anything wrong , I don ' t think anybody could have any confidence in that. &quot; On the other hand , said Sen . Phil Gramm ( R-Tex. ) , if Starr finds nothing wrong , his appointment could be a boon for the Administration because it would quell all speculation &quot; that there was a whitewash on Whitewater. &quot; Appearing on CBS-TV ' s &quot; Face the Nation , &quot; Gramm renewed his call_for the firing of Altman , Hanson and Joshua L . Steiner , Bentsen ' s 28-year-old chief_of_staff . For now , both Clinton and Bentsen are said to be committed to retaining Altman , whom they view_as one of the most effective members of the Administration policy-making team . But Treasury officials concede that Altman ' s government career hinges_on whether Democratic congressional leaders make_it clear to the Administration that they can continue to work with him . Treasury officials say they believe that Altman -- the central Administration figure in the Whitewater hearings -- has been badly damaged by the fact that Democratic senators have joined Republicans in_questioning his conduct . &quot; I think it will be tough for Roger , and I think the next week or two will be critical for him , &quot; a senior Treasury official said . &quot; The key will be whether Senate Democrats on the committees that Treasury has to deal with signal that , even though they think he screwed_up on Whitewater , they can still work with him. &quot; In an effort to head_off a congressional stampede for Altman ' s ouster , Panetta has privately ordered senior White_House staffers to stop talking to the news media about whether Altman can survive the controversy , sources said . Longtime friends , including Robert E . Rubin , White_House assistant for economic_policy , have been angered by leaks about Altman and are publicly taking_up his cause . &quot; I ' ve known Roger for 20 years ; I ' d vouch for Roger on absolutely anything , &quot; Rubin said . &quot; As the President has said , Roger has been an outstanding deputy secretary , and there ' s no question in my mind he ' ll continue to be so going forward. &quot; But some Treasury officials , embittered by reports of an imminent shake-up , contend that White_House officials in_charge of Whitewater damage_control have been trying to deflect hostile fire toward the department by making Altman the fall_guy . While privately furious over the recent turn of events , Altman remains fiercely committed to remaining in office and clearing his name , according to sources close to him . &quot; Public_service is really important to him , &quot; a senior Treasury official said . &quot; And anyway , no one wants to be run_out of town. &quot; Yet if the Whitewater hearings have been disastrous for Hanson and Altman , they have been just as damaging for the Treasury_Department as_a_whole . In fact , some officials say they believe the congressional grilling subjected the department to disgrace . The stain of Whitewater has spread across almost the entire top layer of management at the department . Along with Hanson and Altman , whose conflicting testimony seemed to underscore a deep rift within the department , Steiner had to endure painful , detailed questions about his most private thoughts , which he jotted_down in a diary that has become a key piece of evidence in the hearings . Bentsen , a former U.S. senator from Texas who has generally received kid-glove treatment on Capitol_Hill , was forced to appear before his former colleagues to try to justify the department ' s actions in the_matter . Under surprisingly tough questioning , Bentsen distanced himself , insisting that he had no knowledge at the time of the department ' s involvement in the Whitewater controversy . And even after he completed his grueling testimony , Altman continued to be subjected_to public denunciations . Last Friday , leading Republicans intensified their demands that Altman resign , and Democratic leaders offered no defense . &quot; He should behave honorably and leave , &quot; said Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R-N.Y. ) , the ranking Republican on the Senate panel looking_into Whitewater . If he does not leave , D ' Amato said , lawmakers &quot; will be unable to rely_upon any statement &quot; that Altman makes to Congress . &quot; Mr. Altman will have no credibility. &quot; Despite such attacks , Rubin insists that Altman and the rest of the Treasury_Department ' s senior staff have continued to work_on the Clinton agenda without &quot; missing a beat. &quot; Treasury officials stress that the bitterly partisan personal attacks have not prevented them from collaborating with Congress on other matters . Altman ' s loss would be particularly troubling for the Administration . A former Wall_Street investment_banker and an old college friend of Clinton , Altman has been a leading player in crafting the White_House health_care agenda . Before Whitewater , he was regarded_as an effective legislative deal-maker . Perhaps his most important contribution has been to bring a more moderate approach to Clinton ' s economic and social agendas . Early in the Administration , Altman played a central role in persuading Clinton to embrace an economic plan that emphasized deficit reduction over new spending . In debates concerning the Clinton health plan , he has acted_as a counterweight to more activist aides such_as health_care adviser Ira Magaziner . &quot; The real tragedy is what ' s happened to Roger -- this is going_to hurt his effectiveness for a long_time , &quot; said David Hale , chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago and an occasional adviser to the Administration . Above all , outside analysts say they believe that the ouster of part or all_of the top echelon at the Treasury_Department could have a severe impact on the Administration ' s economic_policies , especially overseas . Unlike some players on the Clinton foreign_policy team , Treasury officials have received high marks from U.S. allies and trading partners . Bentsen , Altman and Lawrence Summers , undersecretary for international affairs , have helped reassert American influence -- which waned during the Bush_Administration -- over the direction of international financial policies established by the Group of Seven industrialized nations . In addition , Altman and Summers have been at the center of the often acrimonious trade negotiations with Japan . A purge at the Treasury_Department could bring economic_policy development to a screeching halt -- at least temporarily . &quot; The rest of the world doesn ' t understand Whitewater , so the scandal itself has had zero impact on the credibility of Treasury overseas , &quot; said Allen Stoga , an international economist with the consulting_firm of Kissinger Associates . &quot; The impact will come , however , if the Treasury team is taken_apart . That would increase the appearance of disarray in the Administration ' s handling of economic and foreign affairs . This has been one of the best Treasury_departments in terms of effectiveness in quite some time , and it has clearly been one of the best departments in this Administration . &quot; You could be talking_about taking_apart one of the best parts of this Administration. &quot;</TEXT>
