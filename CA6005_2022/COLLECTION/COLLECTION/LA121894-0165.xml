   <HEADLINE> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI : THE RIGHT WAY TO DRAW_ON AN IRA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Q . I turned 70 1 / 2 in October and must begin making mandatory withdrawals from my individual_retirement_accounts . I have a total of about $ 500 # 000 in all my accounts . I think my minimum required distribution is $ 20 # 805 . I have been taking_out the interest and dividends generated by my IRA investments each year , a total of about $ 27 # 300 . Am I meeting the federal requirements ? No one gives me a straight answer . -- F.B . * A . The easiest way to calculate your required annual minimum withdrawal is to use the &quot; term certain method , &quot; which is based on your life_expectancy and , if you want , the life_expectancy of your IRA beneficiary . Under this method , you would calculate the annual withdrawal each year by dividing your account balance by your life_expectancy , as determined by IRS actuarial_tables . These tables are detailed in IRS Publication No . 939 , Pension General Rules . To order , call ( 800 ) 829-3676 . We asked Palm Springs certified_public_accountant Howard Gordon to calculate your minimum required annual withdrawal for 1994 using your life_expectancy only . The result : about $ 32 # 680 . ( It would be less if you were to add in the life_expectancy of your IRA beneficiary. ) Where and How to Buy T-Bonds , T-Bills Q . Where can I purchase Treasury securities ? With rates increasing , these investments are looking more attractive every day . -- M . A . * A . You ' re absolutely right that the recent spike in interest_rates is generating interest in government_notes . Treasury_bonds can be purchased through banks and securities brokers , but you will probably be charged a sales fee of as much as $ 25 per bond . However , you can also buy bonds directly from the U.S._government and pay no fee at all . First , here is your range of purchase choices . Treasury_bonds , which range_in maturity from two years to 30 years , are available in $ 1 # 000 increments up_to a maximum of $ 5 million . Treasury_notes are sold in two- and five-year maturities and are available in $ 1 # 000 increments from a minimum of $ 5 # 000 to a maximum of $ 5 million . Treasury_bills , or T-bills as they are often called , are sold in six- and 12-month maturities and are available in $ 1 # 000 increments from a minimum of $ 10 # 000 to a maximum of $ 1 million . Treasury_bonds and notes may be purchased directly from the Federal_Reserve_Bank . In Los Angeles , the Fed is located at 950 S . Grand Ave . You may also buy them by mail by writing the Bureau of Public_Debt , Washington , DC 20239 . Personal_checks are accepted . T-bills are also available by mail , but the process is a bit more complicated . Your first_step should be to open an account with the Fed . You can do this by writing to the Fed at P.O. Box 2077 , Terminal Annex , Los Angeles , CA 90051 and asking_for a New Account Request form . Complete it and return it . Soon you will receive a note that your account has been opened . Then , you can simply send a cashier ' s check to the Fed in the amount of the bill you wish to purchase . Include a note stating the type of security you want to buy and your account number . As you may know , Treasury_bills are sold at discount , with the discount_rate corresponding to the interest_rate carried by the bill . Buyers should send checks for the full amount of the bill . Reimbursements for the discount are returned to the buyer by mail or direct deposit into a bank_account designated by the buyer shortly after the auction . To Avoid Taxes on a Home Sale , Buy Equal Q . I am planning to marry soon . My fiance and I have each sold a home that we had owned . We plan to use the proceeds to purchase a new home together . My home sold for $ 120 # 000 ; hers sold for $ 180 # 000 . The home we want to buy costs $ 183 # 000 . We are applying our profits ( mine were $ 3 # 000 ; hers were $ 15 # 000 ) to the new home and purchasing one that is more expensive than those we sold . Are we doing the right thing to avoid taxes ? -- A.G . * A . To avoid taxation on any profits you realized from the sale of your respective homes , the two of you must purchase a replacement home equal_to the combined total of the two sales prices . This means your replacement home must cost at least $ 300 # 000 . If you are unable or unwilling to make such a purchase , you face a tax_liability on your gains . One possible way to minimize the tax bite is to put the replacement home_in the name of your wife . This will allow her to shelter her gain of $ 15 # 000 and expose you to taxation on just $ 3 # 000 . $ 125 # 000 Exclusion Can Apply Interstate Q . My husband and I have owned a home_in another state since 1964 . He lives there ; I live_in California since being transferred here in 1986 . My husband will soon reach age 55 . May he sell his residence and take the $ 125 # 000 exclusion and relocate to California to live with me ? -- M.B . * A . Assuming the out-of-state home is truly your husband ' s principal residence , your plan should work . One way to verify that the out-of-state home is really your husband ' s principal residence is whether he files his income_tax from that location . He should , to pass muster .</TEXT>
