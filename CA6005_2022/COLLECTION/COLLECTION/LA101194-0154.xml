   <HEADLINE> MALLS HOPE FOR HOLIDAY RUSH ; BUT RETAILERS WONDER HOW STRONG THE DEMAND WILL BE AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Throughout the nation , retailers are decking the halls and expecting the best holiday shopping season in years . The Christmas holidays are especially important to retailers , given that 40 % of their sales typically come during that time_of_year . But can shopping_malls in the San Fernando Valley area , still haunted by Southern California ' s deep and lingering economic woes and rebuilding from the January earthquake , also hope for a merry Christmas ? Surprisingly , many say yes . &quot; We ' re feeling that customers are buying more now , &quot; said Annette Bethers , marketing director at the Topanga Plaza mall in Woodland Hills . &quot; We feel it ' s going_to be an extremely strong Christmas. &quot; Across the Valley , many malls that have finished their earthquake repairs -- or escaped major damage in the first place -- are reporting sales increases of 10 % to 30 % over this time last year . Some mall retailers even say sales are so brisk that year-to-date totals are up from last year ' s numbers -- despite temporary closures after the quake . But while some Valley-area malls are benefiting from pent-up consumer demand , layoffs in aerospace and other industries continue to plague the region , warned John Golisch , chief retail consultant in Southern California for the business services_firm Arthur Andersen . And he wondered if the sales gains reported by some stores will last , since so far they ' ve come largely at the expense of closed malls and from the influx of earthquake insurance and federal assistance funds . Whether sales increases &quot; will be sustaining when the rest of the capacity comes_back will really depend_on the mood of consumers , &quot; he said . One less-than-upbeat consumer is Pat McGarry of Sherman Oaks , who enjoyed a cup of coffee while his wife shopped recently at the Fashion Square mall in Sherman Oaks . &quot; It ' s my great hope , &quot; he said , to persuade his wife to spend less this year because his earthquake insurance didn ' t cover all_of their damage . &quot; I ' m sort of resigned . that ' s going_to cut_into Christmas this year. &quot; And not all local shopping_centers are toasting the holidays . The quake-devastated Northridge Fashion Center remains closed , and only the Broadway and Sears stores there will reopen next month , in time for Hanukkah and Christmas shoppers . Robinsons-May is the only store open at Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood , and mall management still won ' t say if the center will ever reopen . And other malls that were partially closed for several months while undergoing repairs can hardly expect to make_up for lost business just from the Christmas season . With the Bullock ' s Northridge mall store not_due to reopen until fall 1995 and the Sherman Oaks Bullock ' s fully reopening only this month , Michael Steinberg , chief_executive of Macy ' s West / Bullock ' s , acknowledged that even a huge holiday season won ' t compensate for lost sales in the Valley this year . But after four years of hard_times for Southern California retailers , he ' s optimistic . &quot; I really believe that we ' re out of the worst aspects of the recession , &quot; Steinberg said . &quot; That translates itself into retail business. &quot; Brian Pickering , vice_president of City Freeholds Inc. USA , an Australian company that owns Fashion Square in Sherman Oaks , is also expecting its best Christmas season in three years . But so far this year the mall ' s sales are down about 30 % because it was closed for two months after the quake , the parking garage was badly damaged and the Broadway and Bullock ' s stores are only now back to normal . &quot; We ' re never going_to pick_up that lost period , &quot; Pickering said . &quot; There were a lot of apartment units damaged , especially in this area . We lost a lot of our customer base. &quot; Most retail_chains say they ' re not planning any extra sales events for their quake-rattled stores . Indeed , the Northridge Broadway and Sears , while planning splashy reopenings , are mainly relying_on luring former customers back to familiar surroundings . Given the damage at several malls , and with the Northridge mall basically closed all year , shopping traffic has recirculated through the Valley and their losses have been others ' gains . Indeed , spokesmen at the malls that have been experiencing strong sales admit that the increases are largely due_to the customers they ' ve picked_up from Northridge Fashion Center and other heavily damaged shopping_malls . Once the Northridge mall fully reopens next year , at least some of the increased traffic that Topanga Plaza and others are experiencing may evaporate -- which again makes this Christmas season so critical . Nationally , 61 % of consumers said they plan to spend more money or the same this holiday season , and it was the most optimistic forecast since 1990 , according to a survey conducted in September by Chicago research firm Leo J . Shapiro &amp; Associates . But while this region ' s retailers should see an improvement in Christmas season sales , given the depressed local economy recently &quot; it would be relatively easy to beat last year ' s numbers , &quot; noted George Rosenbaum , Leo J . Shapiro president . What ' s more , after a tough year , the mood of Valley consumers might best be described as mixed . While shopping recently at Topanga Plaza , Florence Sussman of Calabasas and her mother , Ida Giniger of Encino , said they were &quot; feeling more optimistic &quot; and planned to spend more on their various children , grandchildren and great-grandchildren this holiday season . But Annie Farkas , shopping at the same mall , said she will spend less because she and her husband had no earthquake insurance and now have to repay the $ 25 # 000 Small Business Administration loan they used to make repairs_to their Woodland Hills house . Also , the new mother has cut_back her hours at her teaching job . But her sister , Lisa Aamoth of North Hills , said she ' ll spend more this year because her $ 80 # 000 in earthquake damage was covered by insurance -- and her newborn has added_to her shopping list . Still , many local mall stores expect brisk sales this holiday season , and they are stocking up_on items they think will be hot sellers . Vicky Crisp , co-manager at Topanga Plaza ' s Victoria ' s Secret store , said sales are booming and she can ' t keep the &quot; Miracle Bra &quot; -- one of the new gravity-defying push-up varieties -- in_stock . She also expects silk lingerie , flannel goods and thermal night wear to sell well for the holidays . Jennifer Maccarone , manager at the Imaginarium toy store in Topanga Plaza , which was closed for only a_few weeks after the quake , said her store ' s sales are up 20 % so far this year . Besides gaining sales while the Imaginarium store at the Northridge mall is closed , she said her store is also getting a boost from the &quot; baby boomlet &quot; of the past few years , and anticipates strong sales this holiday from such classics as train sets . The Crate &amp; Barrel shop in the Topanga mall is also seeing &quot; gangbusters business &quot; for its dishes , glasses , pots and pans , said area manager Geri Given . At the Sherman Oaks Galleria , Kamran Hedjasi , assistant manager at Sam Goody , said sales of recorded music and videocassettes are up 5 % over last year , in part because of a program the mall started for frequent shoppers to earn discounts , coupons and free merchandise . Hedjasi also sees a boost to holiday sales from the release of Walt Disney ' s &quot; Snow White &quot; on video this month . At The Limited women ' s clothing_store in the Galleria , co-manager Jocelyne Maalouf said sales have picked_up recently and &quot; we ' re crossing our fingers that we will have a good season. &quot; Some malls say the earthquake , while destructive , forced their anchor department_stores to modernize facilities and overhaul merchandising strategies , which should also help sales . The Robinsons-May store at Topanga Plaza , for instance , which is reopening Nov . 10 , will have more selling space , new architecture and expanded furniture , consumer electronics and housewares departments . At the Sherman Oaks Galleria , the two Robinsons-Mays were also updated and merchandise was rearranged so that women ' s apparel is now in one store , men ' s apparel and home goods in the other . While all_the local malls that escaped major earthquake damage say their sales are up strongly over a year ago , as more rival stores reopen , it remains murky exactly which malls will end_up with the biggest increase in shopper traffic . Michael Strle , vice_president at the O ' Connor Group , owner of the Promenade in Woodland Hills , said he ' s optimistic that his mall will continue enjoying the 30 % increase in comparable-store sales it ' s had since the earthquake -- even after other shopping_centers return to full operation . Patrons of other malls &quot; have rediscovered the Promenade , &quot; he said . &quot; We hope we ' ve converted them to regular shoppers. &quot; Mary Callahan , manager at Panorama Mall in Panorama City , reported sales are up 35 % there over last year . The small center , whose only department_store is a Broadway , &quot; is the only game in this part of town , &quot; she said . Callahan also hopes to hold onto customers she ' s picked_up since the quake because , she believes , the rebuilt Northridge mall will be even more upscale when it reopens , and shoppers will still be looking_for bargains . At the Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park , General_Manager Eric Knudsen also thinks his discount center has benefited from customers ' hunting for low prices . Sales there are up 30 % so far this year , and the JC Penney outlet ' s sales were so strong it opened a second floor last month , he said . Even malls relatively far away from Northridge say they ' ve picked_up sales that would have otherwise gone_to Northridge Fashion Center . At Media City_Center in Burbank , &quot; business is booming , &quot; said General_Manager Daniel Millman . &quot; I think we ' ll finish the Christmas season 20 % ahead of last year. &quot; And the Glendale Galleria , which attracts customers from all_over Los Angeles , says the percentage of its sales to Valley residents has increased to 24 % from 14 % before the quake . At the Valencia Town Center , 1994 &quot; has really been a fabulous year for our merchants , &quot; said General_Manager Kristin Mueller , because of Northridge Fashion Center ' s closure , damage to freeways that encouraged local residents to shop locally and an improving economy . Mueller expects such a busy holiday shopping season that she ' s planning to run shuttles from off-site customer parking_areas . In a possible sign of things to come , though , Ruth Ann Moore , marketing director at the Antelope Valley Mall , said she ' s noticed a tapering_off from sales increases seen immediately after the quake , as other malls get_back to full strength . She still expects to finish the year with total sales up about 10 % , and is encouraged by growth in the Antelope Valley . But some mall operators are wise enough to admit that predicting retail sales is a guessing game , and guessing wrong can leave retailers stuck_with unsold inventory . &quot; I think everyone would like for it to be a gangbuster holiday season , &quot; said Sherman Oaks Galleria General_Manager Joy De Backer . &quot; Is there a guarantee for it ? No. &quot; Shopping_Mall Update Heading into the all-important holiday shopping season , some local malls are limping along with earthquake repairs still under way .
