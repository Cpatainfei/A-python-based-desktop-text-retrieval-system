   <HEADLINE> RISING RATES DAMPEN SALES OF EXISTING HOMES ; REAL_ESTATE : THE NUMBERS EDGE_UP ONLY SLIGHTLY IN OCTOBER , LED BY GAINS IN THE WEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sales of previously owned homes barely moved_in October , inching up just 0.5 % for the first advance in three months as rising mortgage rates continued to brake housing activity . Sales fell_in all regions of the nation except for the West , and a real_estate trade group warned that the higher costs of financing would continue to be a drag_on the housing sector . &quot; There ' s no question that resales will feel the brunt of the Fed ' s generous rate increase . Adjustable-rate mortgages will be affected more_than long-term rates , but increases in both can be expected , &quot; said John A . Tuccillo of the National Assn . of Realtors . The Fed engineered a three-quarters of a percentage_point rise in short-term rates on Nov . 15 , the sixth increase in short-term rates this year . The realtors said seasonally adjusted sales of existing single-family homes totaled an annualized 3.91 million in October , up from September ' s revised 3.89 million rate . The initial September estimate was 3.97 million . The revision meant that sales in September matched the 1 % August decline , rather than rising 1 % . Sales edged_up 0.3 % in July . Despite the October advance , the rate was 3 % below that of a year earlier , when it totaled 4.03 million and when housing activity was headed toward what analysts regard_as the current cycle peak of 4.35 million in December , 1993 . The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp . said the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was 8.93 % in October , compared to 8.68 % in September and 6.83 % in October , 1993 . The rate stood at 9.25 % last week . An increase from 7 % to 9 % would add $ 209 to the monthly payment on a $ 150 # 000 mortgage . But despite rising rates , the realtors are predicting sales of 3.97 million existing homes this year , up from 3.80 million in 1993 and second only to 3.98 million in 1978 . &quot; In the current interest_rate environment , this is a vote_of_confidence in the economy , &quot; said Edmund G . Woods Jr. , Realtors Assn . president . However , the median price for existing homes declined slightly in October as it often does when demand wanes . It was $ 107 # 900 , down from $ 108 # 400 in September although it was up from $ 106 # 600 a year earlier . The median is the midpoint , meaning half of the homes cost more and half cost less . Regionally , the West posted the only increase in sales , a 3.7 % gain to an 840 # 000 annual rate . The median price there was $ 139 # 900 . Elsewhere , sales were unchanged in the Northeast at a 560 # 000 rate and in the South at 1.43 million . The median price was $ 135 # 700 in the Northeast ; $ 96 # 200 in the South . Sales fell 1.8 % , to a 1.07 million rate , in the Midwest , where the median price was $ 86 # 700 . Separately , the Federal_Reserve_Bank of Philadelphia said the economy is expected to grow more quickly this year than previously predicted , according to a survey of 30 forecasts . The quarterly survey of 30 economic forecasters compiled by the Philadelphia Fed predicted the nation ' s gross_domestic_product will grow 3.9 % in 1994 , up 0.2 percentage_points from their forecast in the last survey . That compares with GDP growth of about 3 % in 1993 . Existing Home Sales Seasonally adjusted annual rate , in millions of units : Oct , 1994 : 3.91 * Source : National Assn . of Realtors</TEXT>
