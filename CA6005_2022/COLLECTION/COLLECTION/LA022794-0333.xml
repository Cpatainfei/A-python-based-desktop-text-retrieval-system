   <HEADLINE> GROUPS WITH STAKE IN STATE TOP WILSON ' S DONOR LIST ; POLITICS : MAJOR CORPORATIONS , ORGANIZATIONS WITH AN INTEREST IN LEGISLATION , REGULATIONS ARE PRIME CONTRIBUTORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a day packed with discussions of education policy and meetings with legislators , Gov . Pete Wilson found time last fall to slip_away from his office for an intimate lunch with some old friends . Down the street from the Capitol at the private Sutter Club , Wilson dined Nov . 9 with the president of Sun-Diamond Growers and the four chairmen of the big agricultural concern ' s member cooperatives , representing growers of walnuts , prunes , raisins and figs . The luncheon tab : $ 25 # 000 in contributions to Wilson ' s reelection campaign , the latest in a series of big checks that make the Central Valley farming association one of the governor ' s most generous political benefactors . &quot; Pete has had a personal_relationship with the leadership of Sun-Diamond for over a decade , &quot; Richard Douglas , the firm ' s senior_vice_president , said in an interview . &quot; We want to see him remain at the helm of the ship. &quot; Wilson will need a lot more contributions like Sun-Diamond ' s if Douglas and his colleagues are to get their wish . The governor ' s campaign advisers believe that to win in November , Wilson will have to spend as much as $ 25 million . To get there , the Republican governor will have to take_in about $ 500 # 000 every week between now and Election_Day . If Wilson continues his pattern set_in 1993 , when he raised $ 5.9 million , he will collect that money at small , pricey affairs like the one with Sun-Diamond , and at_large , $ 150-per-ticket events for longtime supporters from his days as mayor of San Diego . He will receive a_few big checks from wealthy entrepreneurs and many tiny ones from retirees reached by his direct mail operation . A review of Wilson ' s campaign reports , including one filed Jan . 31 , shows that most of the money Wilson is raising comes from major corporations and interest_groups with a stake in legislation and regulations decided in Sacramento , often in the governor ' s office . Insurance_companies , the oil_industry and horse_racing interests are among his largest contributors . Agriculture , health_care companies and telecommunications firms also have been generous to Wilson . This is the way the system works in Sacramento , where unlike federal races there are no limits on the size or the source of political contributions . Some donors say they give_out of ideological affinity with the candidates . Some say they want better access -- improved odds that their phone_calls will be returned . Others say they wish they did not have to contribute but feel they must in_order to protect their interests . Wilson is_on record as favoring a $ 1 # 000 limit on contributions . But for the meantime , he plays the game by the rules_in effect in California . And he plays it as well as anybody . Some critics say his zeal , particularly his habit of scheduling fund-raisers while he is considering whether to sign or veto hundreds of bills after the end of the legislative session , is unseemly . &quot; He ' s peddling his executive powers , &quot; said Harvey Rosenfield , who has criticized Wilson for taking money from insurance_companies while signing bills to weaken Proposition 103 , which Rosenfield wrote and shepherded to voter approval to impose stricter regulation of insurance rates . Wilson is sensitive to this criticism and in a_few cases has refused contributions from interests with matters before him . Last year , he returned money that the Hollywood Park horse_racing track and two Los Angeles card clubs contributed as he was considering whether to sign a bill that those interests were fighting over . Other legislation on the same subject is expected this year . &quot; In anticipation of the bills arriving on the governor ' s desk , we believed it was in everyone ' s best interest to simply return the money to avoid any appearance of a conflict_of_interest , &quot; said Dan Schnur , the governor ' s campaign press secretary . But in many other instances last year , Wilson accepted and kept contributions from interests that were seeking to influence him on important matters . Some examples : * On the eve of the introduction Oct . 1 of a controversial new form of diesel_fuel , Texaco picked_up the $ 30 # 000 catering bill for a huge Wilson fund-raiser at Bob Hope ' s desert home . Arco contributed $ 10 # 000 at the same event . Despite protests from truck_drivers who said the new fuel would cost more and damage their engines , Wilson let the regulation take_effect on schedule two days later . * The state ' s nursery industry raised about $ 53 # 000 for Wilson at an event held as his Administration was weighing restrictions on methyl_bromide , a pesticide used widely as a fumigant in greenhouses and plant farms . Three months later , Wilson reversed an earlier decision and canceled a regulation that would have required broad public notification whenever the pesticide was used . * The timber industry contributed to Wilson at_the_same_time that his forestry board was considering regulations on cutting trees . Louisiana Pacific gave Wilson $ 50 # 000 in April . Two months later , Wilson , over the objections of environmentalists , ordered state officials to speed_up approval of logging permits . Schnur could offer no rationale for why Wilson returned the gambling money but kept the rest . He said the decisions are made on a case-by-case basis . &quot; When you ' re the incumbent governor , virtually any individual or interest may potentially have a stake in something under your purview , &quot; Schnur said . &quot; We try to do everything we can to identify and remove any potential conflicts . You have to draw_the_line somewhere. &quot; Few suggest that the contributions and Wilson ' s actions are directly linked . But even many donors acknowledge that they have given money to Wilson to establish a relationship that enables them to educate the governor and get_through more easily to Administration officials . Consider Sun-Diamond Growers . In 1982 , the company plucked Wilson from relative obscurity , endorsed him in a crowded Republican primary for the U.S. Senate and helped him raise money from other Central Valley growers , according to Douglas , the senior_vice_president . An agricultural neophyte then , Wilson today is one of the industry ' s staunchest defenders . &quot; We had our neck stuck_out for the mayor of San Diego , &quot; Douglas said . &quot; We raised money for him , we went_to bat for him and he won . Pete , after getting elected , came_back to thank the Sun-Diamond family time and time again. &quot; Sun-Diamond officials have many concerns with which Wilson can help . Water provided by the State Water_Project is vital to their business . The growers sell much of their product overseas and benefit from the state ' s export promotion programs . And they use pesticides that are regulated by the state , which is under pressure from environmental groups to limit the use of chemicals in agriculture . But none of these subjects , according to Douglas , were discussed at the luncheon with Wilson . &quot; We don ' t need to lobby the governor in that setting , &quot; he said . &quot; We don ' t discuss business . We talk_about the world . We talk_about families , the state . This is kind of like a group of old friends getting together. &quot; When he does need to talk business , Douglas calls Henry Voss , Wilson ' s agriculture_secretary , or Ira Goldman , the governor ' s trade representative . The calls , Douglas said , are swiftly returned . &quot; Certainly your phone_calls are going_to get answered quicker than the calls from someone who didn ' t toil in the vineyards to bring_in the harvest , &quot; he said . In Sacramento , as in other capitals , this is called access . Tom Burns , a former legislative aide and now a lobbyist for G . D . Searle &amp; Co. , a pharmaceuticals firm , said access is what the drug industry was looking_for when it held a $ 2 # 500-per-person fund-raiser for Wilson in Sacramento last year . The event raised more_than $ 30 # 000 for the governor . Attending with Wilson were his wife , Gayle , one of his political aides , Joe Shumate , and Kim Belshe , then the deputy secretary of health and welfare and now director of the Department of Health Services . &quot; It was very low-key , &quot; Burns said . &quot; There were three companies represented at each table , and the governor and his wife and Shumate and Kim rotated from table to table . Everybody got face time with the governor. &quot; At his table , Burns recalled , the main topic of conversation was the fact that his boss grew_up near Gayle Wilson in Arizona , where her father ran a bakery and the father of Burns ' boss sold bread for the competition . Despite the small_talk , Burns said he considered the event a good investment . &quot; The next time I pick_up the phone and call someone in the governor ' s office , they ' ll know who I am , &quot; he said . The same motivation drove the California Ski Industry Assn . to host a lunch for Wilson in October , said Bob Roberts , the group ' s executive_director . Wilson brought with him the directors of Caltrans and the Highway Patrol , and the secretaries of resources and trade and commerce . Representative of nine resorts attended , raising $ 23 # 900 for the governor . Ski resorts , Roberts said , tend to be located in rural_areas where few voters live . They cannot very well threaten to move_out of state if they ' re unhappy . So they have had trouble getting the ear of state officials for years . They need to talk to Caltrans and the Highway Patrol about keeping mountain roads open on snowy days , to the resources agency about air and water quality issues , and to the trade and commerce agency about the promotion of tourism . &quot; We have found that by getting more involved in the political process we have been able to at least find an audience of people to listen , &quot; Roberts said . Asked if he thought his industry could get a meeting with four top state officials without holding a fund-raiser for the governor , Roberts replied : &quot; Realistically , no. &quot; The ski industry event is reminiscent_of a Wilson fund-raiser a year ago to which the governor brought members of the state Waste Management Board to help him raise money from the waste handling and hauling industry . Wilson called that a mistake and vowed not to do_it again . But Schnur , Wilson ' s campaign spokesman , said that although officials with regulatory powers no longer attend fund-raisers , Cabinet officials do . It makes_sense for these experts to be present to help the governor spell_out his agenda to contributors like the ski resort operators , he said . A spokesman for the Wilson Administration said that contributions to the governor gain no special favors from these Cabinet officials . &quot; To the extent that you can work with anybody , you try and do so , &quot; Kevin Eckery said . &quot; But you certainly don ' t accommodate people based on whether you met with them at a fund-raiser , for God ' s sake. &quot; Schnur said there is no pressure on companies or interest_groups to contribute to Wilson , either to obtain access or influence policy . The governor , he said , often takes actions against the wishes of his donors . He cited a 1992 bill Wilson vetoed even though it was sponsored by the state ' s prison_guard union , which is a frequent contributor to the governor and waged a $ 1-million independent campaign to help him win election in 1990 . The perception among the interest_groups , however , is that contributions are a cost of doing business in the Capitol . Dennis Mangers , a former assemblyman who now lobbies for the California Cable_Television Assn. , said his industry makes contributions because it does not want to stand_out from the competition , particularly the telephone_companies , which are big contributors . Last year , nine cable companies contributed more_than $ 50 # 000 to Wilson at an event in San Francisco . &quot; We would just as soon inform , try to persuade and educate people of the complexities of ours and other interests , &quot; Mangers said , &quot; and not have money play any role at all. &quot; Mangers said he is sure that Wilson would not punish his industry if it stopped contributing to his campaigns . But he ' s not taking any chances . &quot; Under the current law and the current rules , it ' s expected that one will participate in the political lives of those who are elected , &quot; he said . Future stories will examine the fund raising of gubernatorial candidates Kathleen Brown and John Garamendi . * PARTY FAVORITE : Lack of GOP infighting lets Wilson focus_on Democrats . A3 Wilson Fund Raising California Gov . Pete Wilson has been raising large amounts_of_money to finance his reelection campaign . The governor ' s campaign advisers believe that to win in November , Wilson will have to spend as much as $ 25 million . The top contributors in 1993 to Wilson ' s reelection campaign committee were : * Sam Bamieh , president American Intertrade Group , a Bay Area import-export firm , $ 85 # 000 . * Pacific Telesis , telecommunications , $ 56 # 500 . * Paramount Pictures , $ 50 # 000 . * Louisiana Pacific , lumber company , $ 50 # 000 . * Assn . of California Insurance Cos. , $ 47 # 256 . * Arco , oil_company , $ 39 # 850 . * Albert Broccoli , television producer , $ 25 # 000 . * Sun-Diamond Growers , agriculture , $ 25 # 000 . * Bank of Stockton , $ 25 # 000 . * John Rosekrans Jr. , Kransco of San Francisco , a toy manufacturer , $ 25 # 000 . * Irvine Co. , real_estate developer , $ 25 # 000 . * Otis Spunkmeyer , cookie maker , $ 25 # 000 .</TEXT>
