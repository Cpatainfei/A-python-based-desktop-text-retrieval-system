   <HEADLINE> U.S. WARNS IRAQ ABOUT FURTHER THREATS ; PERSIAN_GULF : SADDAM HUSSEIN ' S REMAINING TROOPS APPEAR TO RETREAT FROM KUWAITI BORDER . THEIR RETURN COULD MEAN IMMEDIATE RETALIATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Iraq appeared to be pulling the last of its elite Republican Guards out of the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone near Kuwait on Sunday , but the Clinton_Administration kept the pressure on , warning Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein that the United States may retaliate immediately the next time the troops threaten Kuwait . A day after the U.N. Security_Council approved a resolution ordering the Iraqis to withdraw from the border area with Kuwait , Pentagon officials reported troop movements indicating that the second of two Republican Guard divisions sent south two weeks ago was pulling_out and moving northward . One of the divisions left the area several days ago , but another had remained camped around Nasiriyah , south of the 32nd Parallel , prompting the Clinton_Administration to press , over initial Russian objections , for a new Security_Council resolution warning the Iraqis that they faced &quot; serious consequences &quot; if they did not withdraw . The resolution was finally passed unanimously late Saturday after a day of intense negotiations that , for the time being at least , appeared to paper over the Administration ' s differences with Moscow over Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev ' s mission to Baghdad last week . As recently as Saturday , Pentagon officials said that the 10 # 000 Iraqi troops camped around Nasiriyah were showing no signs of leaving . But although the troops were still in the area Sunday , officials said there were signs that the division was preparing to move north . &quot; We have indications that the Republican Guards in the Nasiriyah area are beginning to pack their stuff , &quot; one senior Pentagon official said , adding that details were still sketchy but that the preliminary &quot; indications are that they ' re moving. &quot; The officials declined to elaborate , citing the sensitivity of intelligence information , but an Administration source said after a White_House meeting between President Clinton and his senior military and foreign_policy advisers Sunday that the President was &quot; cautiously optimistic &quot; that the Iraqis were finally complying with the U.N. ultimatum . &quot; But we continue to watch the situation closely to make_sure this is not a Potemkin pullout , &quot; the source added . &quot; We ' re not announcing that it ' s finished yet . . . but ( Hussein ) does seem to be moving_in the right direction , &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said Sunday on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet the Press. &quot; But as the latest Gulf crisis began to recede , it seemed apparent that the Administration had only temporarily bridged a widening gap with Moscow over what to do about Hussein . The Iraqi president has continually refused to comply with a series of Security_Council ultimatums that the United States insists must all be met before it agrees to ease any of the trade sanctions that have crippled Iraq ' s economy and cut_off all its oil exports . In a clear departure from the Clinton_Administration ' s position , Kozyrev announced in Baghdad last week that Russia would work toward an easing of the U.N. sanctions in return for what he said was a promise by Hussein to recognize Kuwait and respect its borders . Kozyrev was scheduled to arrive_at the United Nations today , and Russian officials sought to delay a vote on the resolution until he had reported to the Security_Council . * But arguing that Iraq should receive no reward for withdrawing its troops , U.S. officials strongly opposed the Russian initiative and pressed the Security_Council to approve a diluted version of the resolution , which warned only that Iraq would face unspecified &quot; consequences &quot; if it failed to withdraw , without specifically threatening or authorizing the use of force . In the end , the resolution passed unanimously -- but only after the Russians were given some face-saving language acknowledging the usefulness of Kozyrev ' s mission without endorsing its results . Moving aggressively to counter the impression that the council was divided , Christopher and other senior Administration officials called the resolution a strong warning that puts Hussein on notice that he faces immediate retaliation the next time his troops violate the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone in southern Iraq . &quot; I think the next time we ' ll probably not wait . We will take action , strong action , against him , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; The message is clear , &quot; Clinton added in a statement released Sunday . &quot; Iraq must complete its withdrawal . It must_not threaten its neighbors in the future. &quot; * The warnings were echoed and amplified by U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright , who said that the United States felt it already had the authorization under previous U.N. resolutions to use force against Iraq and that it reserves the right to do so &quot; multilaterally when we can and unilaterally when we must. &quot; The significance of the Security_Council vote , she said Sunday on ABC-TV ' s &quot; This Week With David Brinkley , &quot; is that &quot; the international community agrees with us that Saddam Hussein cannot keep being a repeat offender. &quot; The thrust of all these remarks , other officials conceded privately , was aimed at discouraging Hussein from trying to take_advantage of what still seemed to be U.S.-Russian divisions over how to handle Iraq . In Kuwait , however , officials said they were satisfied that the resolution gave the U.S.-led allied force in the area the authorization to reply with force if the Iraqis fail to complete their withdrawal . &quot; This gives a clear mandate to the coalition here to see that there will not be any repetition of such activities by Iraq , &quot; Kuwaiti Information Minister Saud al Sabah told The Times . &quot; It ' s so wide open that the coalition now can decide exactly where to draw_the_line in the sand. &quot; The &quot; whole picture has turned now , &quot; he added , &quot; and . . . any possibility that Iraq might pursue other ways of lifting sanctions is going_to be very futile. &quot; Times staff writer Scott Kraft in Kuwait City contributed to this report .</TEXT>
