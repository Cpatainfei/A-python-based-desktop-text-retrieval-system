   <TEXT> For the serious , hard-core gamer , it ' s becoming more and more obvious that some sort of CD_drive is a vital part of the video_game experience . Although I ' ve been critical of the Sega CD in the past , dramatic improvements in game quality have me close to eating my words , and two new games are adding_to my dining pleasure . The first is Microcosm , a strange and unusual disk from Psygnosis . The plot is long and complicated ; 20 pages of the instruction_manual are gobbled_up telling the tale . Basically , you ' re a top agent for Cybertech , reduced to the size of a dust mite and inserted , along with various vehicles and weapons , into the body of Cybertech president Tiron Korsby . You travel though Korsby ' s body , trying to find and destroy a manipulation device -- Grey M -- buried deep in his brain by the leader of a rival company . Traveling through veins and arteries , you fire on both natural viruses and the artificial probes filling his body to defend the intruding device . Your course is predetermined , although you can maneuver your craft along the preset path . You use three mechanical aids on your journey . A Spook Series 4 pod is your first vehicle . It ' s used in two sections of the game ; the initial battles , in the cephalic_vein , and the third stage , the superior_vena_cava and the heart . Your second vehicle is the_Hunter Killer RS-18 . You use it in section 2 , the left lung , and section 4 , the carotid_artery . When you reach the brain , section 5 , you are stuffed into the S2-21 pressure_suit for close-up work . Each has a variety of weapons , including lasers , cannons and smart bombs , which are upgraded by icons floating throughout the body . You ' ll need the firepower , because the variety of natural and artificial weaponry is awesome . As are the graphics . And the dramatic soundtrack , created by former Yes keyboard player Rick Wakeman . And the control , which is smooth and fluid . This is a continually fascinating and entertaining game , devilishly hard to beat . It ' s Sega-rated MA-13 , with parental discretion advised . * Sega is responsible_for the second CD -- Tomcat Alley . In this classic battle for air superiority , you are the radar and missile officer aboard an F-14 Tomcat fighter-bomber . You and your companions are trying to wipe_out two MIG squadrons stolen by renegade Russian Col . Alexi Povich and relocated to the Mexican desert . Tomcat Alley gives you a from-the-cockpit view of the action as you punch_in waypoint coordinates , trigger flares and chaff to throw_off enemy missiles , handle the radio and recon camera and line_up shots at waves of MIGs and SAM batteries defending Povich ' s headquarters and his chemical_warfare threat . Tomcat Alley isn ' t a true flight_simulator , since you don ' t fly the plane . The direction pad is used to line_up the cross_hairs for missile shots at enemy planes and to direct bombs and missiles against ground targets . But the action is hot and heavy , and the CD , rated MA-13 , is crammed with variations , so you almost never fight the same fight twice in a row . There are excellent , if slightly fuzzy , film sections with live actors , solid sound_effects and great shots of exploding jets -- MIGs , if you shoot well ; your own , if you miss . Tomcat Alley missions become more and more complex the closer you get_to wiping_out Povich and his pals . But keep trying . You might get a medal .</TEXT>
