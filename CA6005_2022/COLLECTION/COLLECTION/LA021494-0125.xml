   <TEXT> Finally , one small step for man . Tommy Moe ' s gold medal in Alpine downhill skiing was the first by a U.S. male in six years . Not since Brian Boitano ' s figure-skating victory at Calgary has a gold been won by an American man . The only victorious U.S. athletes at Albertville in 1992 were women -- speedskater Bonnie Blair twice , figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi , freestyle skier Donna Weinbrecht and short-track skater Cathy Turner . &quot; All right ! One for our side ! &quot; Boitano joked after Moe ' s success Sunday . * Headline from Sports Illustrated ' s Winter Olympic preview issue : &quot; What ' s wrong with U.S. skiing ? Sit down , this may take awhile. &quot; From writer E.M. Swift ' s text : &quot; Slovenia , Luxembourg and New Zealand all have better chances to take_home Alpine medals from Lillehammer than Uncle_Sam ' s lead-footed snowplow brigade . &quot; Norway . . . has four skiers ranked ahead of the top U.S. man , Tommy Moe . &quot; Only Moe and a miracle stand between this team and a repeat of the 1988 Games in Calgary , where the top U.S. skier finished ninth , just ahead of the lift operator. &quot; Anybody still believe_in miracles ? * Add article : Moe had this to say about the SI story : &quot; Everyone should read it , because none of it is really true . The result today kind of puts it in place . A lot of American skiers work hard . We don ' t need to be ridiculed. &quot; And : &quot; It ' s funny that it came_out this time_of_year , before the Olympics . I read it . It stoked my fire. &quot; * The magazine also asked why &quot; all seven million Austrians and half of the cows in Switzerland ski faster than the entire U.S. ski team ? &quot; Austria ' s downhill skiers placed fourth , tied for sixth , 15th and 19th Sunday . Switzerland ' s were 14th , 16th and 23rd . Americans placed first , 11th and 17th . No Slovenia , Luxembourg , New Zealand or Swiss bovine skiers won medals . MIKE DOWNEY</TEXT>
