   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; LATINO LAB ' S ' LA VICTIMA ' TAKES ANTI-PROP . 187 SLANT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1987 , Latino Theatre Lab presented &quot; La Victima , &quot; an agitprop epic about a family ' s migrations across the U.S.-Mexican border over 60 years , at Los Angeles Theatre Center . Now director Jose Luis Valenzuela and the Lab are doing &quot; La Victima &quot; at their new home , Plaza de la Raza , as a fund-raiser against Proposition 187 , the ballot measure that takes_aim at illegal immigrants . The play puts some of the issues raised by Proposition 187 into a historical context . It argues that U.S. attitudes toward immigration are largely determined by the health of the U.S. economy . The play ' s Villa family is tolerated in good times , for its contribution to the cheap labor_pool , and deported in bad times , when jobs are scarce . Cast members deliver brief commentaries along these lines directly to the audience . However , &quot; La Victima &quot; is not a dry historical_document . It focuses_on the human drama -- or melodrama -- of a mother and her children . Amparo ( Lupe Ontiveros ) is born in Mexico , just before her own mother flees the revolution . She grows_up in California . During the Depression , Amparo and her jobless husband return to Mexico , but she ' s separated from her young son Samuel ( Enrique Castillo ) at the train_station . He remains in the United States , adopted by a Mexican American family , and grows_up to become an immigration agent . Meanwhile , Amparo ' s other children ( Angela Moya and Sal Lopez ) return to the States as adults to help pay the bills . After her husband dies , Amparo joins them , smuggled in under a car_seat . When she visits her children on a picket_line , guess who is the immigration officer who busts the strikers and interrogates the old_woman before deporting her . No , it isn ' t Harold Ezell . The play ' s final confrontation is eloquently played by Ontiveros and Castillo . Its didacticism is leavened with mild humor , well played by Lopez and Ontiveros but overdone by Evelina Fernandez . Still , the play doesn ' t deal with some of the issues it raises . For example , how and why does Moya ' s character become a U.S. citizen while her brother , who emigrates at_the_same_time , remains illegal ? This production is bare-bones compared to the one that played LATC . That one involved a clever use of suitcases and screens . A few of the actors speak too softly at times , and not everyone had learned the lyrics to all_the songs . But the musical accompaniment , directed by Quetzal Flores and Jesus Perez , is solid . Perhaps befitting its new home , this staging uses more Spanish than the one at LATC . A screen provides English translations for most of the songs and Spanish translations for some of the speeches that are spoken in English . The Latino Theatre Lab has changed its name to the Latino Theatre Company , but the old name is still used in the spoken introduction . * &quot; La Vi ctima , &quot; Plaza de la Raza , 3540 N . Mission Road , tonight-Sunday , 8 p.m. ; Wednesday-Nov . 6 , 8 p.m. ; Nov . 6 , 2 p.m. $ 11 . ( 213 ) 223-2475 . Running time : 1 hour , 45 minutes .</TEXT>
