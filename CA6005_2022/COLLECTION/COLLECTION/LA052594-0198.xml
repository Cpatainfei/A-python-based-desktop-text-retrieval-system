   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; BITTERSWEET REUNION IN GAZA ; A FAMILY SPLINTERED BY EXILE AND OCCUPATION WILL FINALLY COME TOGETHER UNDER SELF-RULE . THEY WILL SHARE HOPES AND MEMORIES -- AND MOURN A BROTHER KILLED JUST MONTHS AGO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As they began to reunite from throughout the Arab world with tears of joy and loss -- a catharsis that was a quarter-century of occupation and separation in the making -- the Danaf family of Gaza City had much to catch_up on last week . Shawky Danaf had to break the worst of it to his half brother , Arafat , who arrived in an Iraqi paratrooper ' s uniform along with hundreds of other Palestinian police_officers in newly autonomous Jericho . After four years of war and isolation with the Palestine Liberation Army brigade based in Baghdad , the news was hard for Arafat to bear . Their brother Mohammad was dead , Shawky told him by phone in a voice choked with pain . He had been shot and killed by Israel ' s occupation army three months short of this greatly anticipated reunion -- the coming_together of a family long divided , like so many in the occupied lands . Just before his death , Mohammad had spoken_of this reunion as a dream more distant only than the dream of living_together with his exiled father and four half brothers in a liberated Palestinian land . By the end of their conversation , both Shawky and Arafat were in tears . The Danafs ' saga speaks volumes about the events unfolding at ground zero of the Middle_East conflict , as Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization finally have begun the first concrete steps toward peace . They are a family of simple poverty among hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who are beginning the long process of erasing the distance and pain of exile and occupation . And like the peace process itself , the Danaf reunion is far from complete . In fact , it has just begun . The family ' s father , a former Palestinian fighter named Hassan , fled to Gaza with his first wife from their Arab village in southern Israel in 1948 , when the Israeli state was carved out of British-ruled Palestine . Nineteen years later , he fled again after the Arabs lost the 1967 Middle_East War . He left his wife , three sons and two daughters in Gaza , bounced from Arab land to Arab land and finally settled with a second wife in Egypt , where he fathered two sons and two daughters . As the surviving half brothers -- two in Gaza and two in the Palestinian brigades destined to serve the autonomous zones -- anticipate their imminent reunion , it is Arafat and the slain Mohammad who best symbolize both the decades of Israeli occupation and the peace-building task now at_hand . The Danafs ' complex story was gleaned in more_than a dozen visits to their home and to a Gaza City cafe that Mohammad had opened last year while unemployed -- to keep_from going mad , he said . It is the story of the splintered and often confusing relationships that typify Gazan families , of lifetimes of desperation and fading hope now turned_to bittersweet joy . And it is a story that demonstrates the human impact of the beginning of both the end of Israel ' s 27 years of occupation in the former Palestine and of the effort still needed to restore enough hope to build Gaza and Jericho into the core of a future Palestinian land . Shawky , 32 , and Arafat , 19 , spoke_for the first time in years when Shawky delivered the news of Mohammad ' s death in the phone_call to Arafat ' s military_post . Gaza and Jericho , the two autonomous Palestinian zones , are still divided by dozens of miles of Israeli territory . A promised route for Palestinian safe passage is still weeks -- or months -- away . Not even Arafat ' s mother , Rida Wahbeh Abdul-Rasoul , who traveled from Cairo to Gaza two weeks ago to begin the reunion , can see him yet . The Egyptian second wife of Hassan came_to Gaza not only to meet the other half of her husband ' s family but also to see her own sons , Arafat and Sabar , for the first time in years . Then last week , on the day Palestinian extremists gunned_down two Israeli soldiers near the Gaza border , Israel sealed_off Gaza for at least nine days , a further obstacle to the reunion . Mohammad and Shawky ' s mother -- Halima Abu Obeid -- had little time last week for the problems of her husband ' s second wife . After all , Hassan had abandoned her when Mohammad , Shawky and the eldest brother , Ibrahim , 36 , were children , fleeing into exile . Nonetheless , Halima said , Rida was living with her in Gaza now . Arafat and Halima ' s other stepson , Sabar , 25 , are almost home after serving in exiled Palestinian brigades in Iraq and Libya both during and after the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War . Sabar , due_to arrive in Gaza any day with his delayed brigade from Libya , was &quot; a carbon_copy &quot; of Mohammad , Halima said . &quot; When my husband called this morning from Cairo , he asked how I was feeling now with the boys coming_home , &quot; she recalled . &quot; With him , I can still speak freely . I said , ' I still feel a great sadness . My hand is not complete . Still a big finger is missing . Our son Mohammad is gone . We have lost him . And nothing can bring him back. ' &quot; An amateur poet , cafe owner and singer in a local band , Mohammad was hardly known outside his gritty neighborhood of Sheikh Radwan . Even his half brothers had met him only once , years ago when they played together as children . But in the flurry of hugs , kisses and tears as thousands of Palestinian families continue to reunite here and in Jericho , Mohammad ' s life and death do much to set the stage for this bold step toward peace . They also say much about the desperate land Israel has just set_free . Mohammad ' s coffee_shop appeared suddenly in December as a battered beacon of hope on Gaza ' s grim landscape . He named it &quot; The Goal Coffeehouse and Restaurant. &quot; It stood_in an empty field , surrounded by Gaza City ' s smoldering garbage and soiled sand . Mohammad was 26 when he opened the shop with Shawky ; that was just 10 weeks before Mohammad became one of the last Palestinian casualties of Israeli occupation in Gaza . On the surface , Mohammad and his open-air cafe stood as small symbols of Gaza ' s irrepressible entrepreneurial spirit and uncanny capacity for survival . He had bought a scrapped bus for $ 200 , the last of his savings . It had been torched by angry Jewish settlers , who remain on the strip despite autonomy . He painted it . He banged_out the dents , and it became his kitchen and service counter . He borrowed seats from one of the dozens of movie_theaters that Israeli authorities shut_down in Gaza six years ago after the uprising known as the intifada brought 8 p.m. curfews . On Dec . 1 , the cafe opened for business , selling falafel and other items for half a shekel each ( about 15 cents ) . &quot; I was working in Israel making about 150 shekels a day in construction . When the Israelis sealed the border nine months ago , that was it . I sat around for months , &quot; Mohammad said then in one of several visits with a reporter . &quot; Finally , I had to open this place . We were going broke , and with nothing to do all day I was going crazy. &quot; He was one of tens of thousands of Gazan refugees whose families depended_on jobs in Israel . They had become unemployed when the government , citing rising anti-Israeli violence , closed the border to most Palestinian workers in April last year . Overnight , Gaza ' s unemployment_rate soared from 20 % to 60 % . After the closure , the Danaf family lived_on Mohammad ' s savings . For Mohammad , it was one more injustice that helped fuel a lifetime of hatred . &quot; I ' ll tell you what I know of the Jews , &quot; Mohammad said . &quot; I know that since birth , when I was growing_up , I remember asking where my father was . Everyone said the Jews forced him to flee our land . He left , they said , when Israel occupied the Gaza Strip . And that was the year I was born. &quot; Originally a refugee from the village of Hammama , one of dozens of Arab villages incorporated into Israel when the Jewish state was formed , Mohammad ' s father had been one of the Palestinian soldiers who fought against the Israeli army in the 1967 war . When Israel conquered Gaza that year , Hassan left with a Palestine Liberation Army brigade that went_to Damascus , Syria ; Aden , then-South Yemen ; Beirut and finally Cairo , where it has served under the Egyptian armed forces . It was one of half_a_dozen such brigades that scattered throughout the Arab world . These units took_over in Gaza and Jericho last week to form the core of the Palestinian security_force -- brigades that Hassan ' s two sons from his second marriage would join after him . Mohammad knew in December that his half brothers , Arafat and Sabar , were among the Palestinian fighters who would return to a homeland they never knew . He learned that news from his father , in the same way many Gazans kept_up with relatives in Egypt after occupation . They would travel_to the divided city of Rafah that straddles the Egyptian border in Gaza ' s south and , at prearranged meetings , shout to each other through barbed wire across 30 yards . Even at the time , Mohammad stressed the significance of this promised reunion -- a small but powerful step_in the reuniting of more_than 2 million Palestinian relatives still separated by occupation and exile . It was , he said then , almost too good to be true . &quot; Even if we have self-government in only one small piece of Gaza , it will be better for us , of course . But I fear for the future , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' d love to see the Palestine police_force take_control of this region , but I doubt it will happen. &quot; It did happen , but he didn ' t see it . Within weeks of its opening , Mohammad ' s cafe was trashed . It happened during an armed clash with another Palestinian family over ownership of the land . Desperate , Mohammad illegally crossed into Israel and took_back his old construction job . After two months , Israeli authorities caught him . He was deported . &quot; Mohammad came_home about midnight on Feb . 24 , &quot; Shawky recalled . &quot; He was angry and exhausted . When he woke_up about noon the next day and heard what had happened that morning , something just snapped in him . He left the house in a fury . The next time we saw him , he was dead. &quot; That was the day in February when a Jewish settler opened_fire inside a Hebron mosque , killing about 30 Palestinian worshipers and nearly destroying the autonomy plan for Gaza and Jericho . The killings touched_off demonstrations and riots throughout the occupied lands . Mohammad joined one of them , outside the Israeli military camp near his home . He was shot in the right side of his chest . He died in the hospital . As he sat outside the remains of the cafe last week , Shawky was in tears . &quot; Of course we will be happy when we finally see our two ( half ) brothers . But we are still in mourning for Mohammad , so there will be no celebration , &quot; he said . &quot; After a time , I will try to reopen this cafe . That was Mohammad ' s dream . . . . But you must understand , we already have paid the full price of this peace. &quot; * Arafat was haggard last week . His time in Iraq had aged his face far beyond his 19 years . And his eyes were wet as he reflected on the news of his half brother ' s death . He sat inside the new Palestinian military camp in Jericho , which he and 450 fellow members of the Iraq-based Al Aqsa Palestinian brigade will use as a base to build a future Palestine . Shawky had just called . &quot; I met ( Mohammad ) just once , and we had fun together . I was 8 at the time , &quot; Arafat said , recalling the one brief time Israeli officials allowed the other half of the Danaf family to visit . &quot; There was something special about Mohammad , the way he saw things and the way he never gave_up hope . He was the only one of the brothers in Gaza whose face I could remember. &quot; Then Arafat told the brief story of his life , and that of the other half of the Danaf family that lived as political nomads while Mohammad and Shawky ' s family lived as subjects of occupation . &quot; Once , I went_to the Egyptian Embassy in Baghdad to renew my passport , &quot; Arafat said . &quot; The man at the desk asked me where I was born . ' Damascus , ' I said . ' Why do you have an Egyptian passport ? ' he asked . ' My mother is Egyptian , and I grew_up in Cairo , ' I said . ' And where do you live now ? ' he asked . ' Baghdad , ' I said . The man just shrugged and said , ' that ' s nice. ' &quot; This is what our lives are like , we Palestinians . I joined the Palestinian brigade when I was 14 . There was no way to earn money on the streets of Cairo , and my brother ( Sabar ) had joined and said the pay was good -- $ 62 a week . And yes , I suppose we did have the feeling we were doing something for Palestine. &quot; But for both boys , the decision would isolate them from their family for years . Iraq invaded Kuwait soon after Arafat arrived in Baghdad and Sabar in Tripoli , and in the following months alliances shifted sharply in the Arab world . For many analysts , that invasion and the ensuing Gulf War forced the peace process ahead . When the subject turned_to politics , Arafat had far less to say than his half brothers . His father , who has decided to remain in Cairo for now to raise his two daughters , spoke occasionally about Gaza and the occupation , Arafat said . It was only in Iraq that Arafat was lectured each week on the origins and implications of the conflict . &quot; What I can tell you is I really do believe this new peace is a great thing , &quot; Arafat said . &quot; I never believed it myself until I put my foot on the soil of Jericho . And soon , . . . I will see Gaza again . I want so_much to see the sea of Gaza , to know that I really do have a home . &quot; But that ' s not the most important thing right now . The first thing I am going_to do is go_to the grave of my brother Mohammad. &quot; * Shawky stood beside that grave as he awaited the arrival of his half brothers last week . He stared at the inscription from the Koran that read , &quot; Do not think he who was killed fighting for God is dead . They are alive and living_in paradise. &quot; &quot; We are proud_of him , &quot; Shawky said . &quot; All of us will die one day , and we would like to die as he died . We miss him , but he is still in our hearts . . . . &quot; Many times , we imagine he is coming_to us in our dreams , speaking with us about his feelings . And when our half brothers finally do arrive , and we sit finally altogether as all families should , I believe he will be there with us to enjoy the moment he dreamed of for so long. &quot;</TEXT>
