   <HEADLINE> RAISING A STINK ; WITH LITTLE MORE THAN A SRONG ODOR , SWEAT HAS MADE ITS WAY INTO THE HISTORY BOOKS . IT ' S TAKEN DOWN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE , SPURRED A BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND GIVEN PIGS A BAD RAP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It allegedly cost Richard Nixon an election , is annoying in outer space and helps pay the bills of professional armpit sniffers from Boston . Salty and stinky , sweat is one of the world ' s least-loved excretions . But it serves as an occasional collector ' s item , keeps the nation ' s $ 1.6-billion deodorant industry afloat and inspires such artistic milestones as a &quot; Married . . . With Children &quot; episode in which Al Bundy ' s overheated body produces a sweat stain that resembles Elvis . It also is a sexual turn-on to dead French dictators . The evil drip has baffled and bedeviled humans for eons , says sweat scientist Richard L . Dobson , whose four decades of perspiration inquiry include military research , odd medical cases and a study of gorilla underarms . Among the riddles that he and others have looked_into : why some people ' s sweat is blue , yellow or red -- and why riding a Tokyo subway at rush_hour is far less odorous than , say , being aboard a crowded New York train . The shaded perspiration , it turns_out , is caused by chromidrosis , a rare condition in which iron or other colored materials get_into sweat_glands ( and which could explain biblical reports that Jesus ' sweat took_on the appearance of blood in the Garden of Gethsemane ) . As for the Tokyo subway phenomenon , Dobson blames a quirk of genetics . Most people , he says , have two types of sweat_glands -- eccrine , which react to heat , and apocrine , which respond to stress or sexual_arousal and are responsible_for that decaying goat smell known to scholars by the scientific name , B.O. Among the Japanese , however , apocrine_glands are few in number . &quot; I have no idea what Darwinian forces led to that , &quot; Dobson says , &quot; but it probably would n ' t be a good idea to start a deodorant company there. &quot; In most other places , of course , it ' s another story . In America , on any given day , residents shed enough perspiration to supply the city of Pittsburgh with 24 hours ' worth of water ( although nobody would want to drink the stuff ) . But scientists are looking_for ways to tame the nation ' s sweat_glands . At the Gillette Odor Clinic in Boston , 100-degree human incubation chambers and trained underarm sniffers are used to test the effectiveness of new antiperspirants and deodorants . When all goes well , wetness is slashed by 60 % and stink is virtually eliminated , says Toiletries Technology Lab wizard Brian Rogers . But not all armpits are created equal . &quot; You might hear an occasional ' Whoa ! ' &quot; Rogers says . &quot; We try to let the odor judges take a_few breaths in between , but if the product isn ' t effective or there ' s a lot of odor , they may need longer to clear their sinuses. &quot; Most employees , however , grow immune to the stench . &quot; They can do ( the tests ) and go eat a doughnut afterward , &quot; he says . And the job is definitely preferable to odor-judging mouthwash or diapers . Researchers also experiment with deodorant fragrances . Some companies try to imitate popular colognes and perfumes , but others cook_up new scents in laboratories , then poll consumers on whether the formulas remind them of &quot; youngness , &quot; &quot; conservatism &quot; or &quot; classical music. &quot; &quot; We ' re selling images , not fragrances , &quot; Rogers explains . Thirty or 40 years ago , those images were limited to Regular , Scented and Unscented . The back-to-nature movement added Herbal and Lime . Today , products tilt toward such concepts as Sport , Surf Spray , Wild Rain and Caribbean Cool . * Sweat has always had a PR problem . Adam -- the first recorded perspirer -- was booted from the Garden_of_Eden with the warning that toil and sweat would be his lot in life . Ancient Egyptians were so appalled by perspiration ' s odor that they slathered themselves with tree resins to cover it up . And sweat-related foot infections and heat disorders incapacitated thousands of soldiers during World_War_II , Korea and Vietnam . Even Richard Nixon supposedly lost his 1960 presidential bid partly because he dripped profusely during a televised debate with John F . Kennedy ( rumor had it that Nixon applied antiperspirants to his face for subsequent appearances ) . Nevertheless , sweat does have its adherents . When it falls_off celebrities or rock_stars -- as in &quot; authentic &quot; vials of Elvis sweat and towels that mopped Beatle brows -- collectors will pay considerable sums for the stuff . Sweat lodges and saunas are said to purify both body and soul ( although medical experts deride such theories ) . And Napoleon regarded the smell of perspiration as an aphrodisiac . After the battle of Marengo , he reportedly sent_word to Josephine : &quot; Will be home_in three days . . . don ' t wash. &quot; &quot; If you don ' t like to sweat , &quot; says Henry Allen , writing in the Washington Post , &quot; imagine what life would be like if you couldn ' t . Imagine those high-tension occasions when you dread sweating , and think_of the alternatives -- giving a speech , say , and having to periodically pick_up the pitcher of ice_water and pour it over your head , like an elephant . Or doing a job interview while slavering like a Saint Bernard. &quot; Or worse : Ostriches and emus cool_off by urinating on_their_own legs and letting the liquid evaporate . Jack rabbits have to flush blood through their ears to lower body_temperature . Only horses , a_few types of cows and some apes perspire for temperature control , say animal experts . Everything else pants . &quot; You ' ve heard the old adage about ' sweating like a pig ' ? &quot; asks Steve Wickler , an animal and veterinary sciences professor at Cal Poly Pomona . &quot; Well , pigs don ' t sweat. &quot; Perspiration authority Dobson says gorillas have the same kind of eccrine sweat_glands in their underarms that people do , except the ape glands don ' t work -- unless the animals are injected with a human neurotransmitter , acetylcholine , the secret sauce that causes people to perspire when blood temperature rises . Which is why gorillas will never play_at Wimbledon . &quot; Thanks to eccrine sweat . . . we can do things that animals can ' t , &quot; says Dobson , a professor of dermatology at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston and editor of the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology . &quot; At Wimbledon , with court temperatures at 100 degrees , players ( competed ) for 5 1 / 2 hours , &quot; he says . &quot; No African animal can run_for five hours. &quot; Even the odoriferous apocrine sweat_gland -- long considered the appendix of the human perspiration system -- might have some usefulness . Women with Fox-Fordyce disease , a rare condition that blocks apocrine sweat during romantic arousal , complain of extraordinary itching while having_sex , Dobson says . * Those who have pondered perspiration include generals , poets , astronauts and auto workers . In World_War_II , Gen . George S . Patton Jr . wrote that &quot; a pint of sweat will save a gallon of blood. &quot; Henry Wadsworth Longfellow rhapsodized that &quot; one half of the world must sweat and groan that the other half may dream. &quot; And , more recently , NASA engineers ruminated over how to deal with sweat in space . &quot; Perspiration and sensitive electronic_equipment don ' t mix , &quot; one space spokesman said . So tiny dehumidifiers were installed in space suits and capsules . Meanwhile , in Toledo , Ohio , in 1991 , Chrysler employees were asked to stop using antiperspirants because the ingredients damage paint jobs on Jeeps . Sweat has also been the subject of considerable scientific speculation . Galen , a 2nd-Century Greek physician whose chief contribution to medicine was the startling announcement that arteries carry blood , not air , was among the earliest sweat theorists . He believed that respiration occurred through the skin as &quot; insensible perspiration. &quot; In the 1600s , Italy ' s Santorio Santorio erected a monolithic scale -- on which he worked and slept for hours at a time -- to document how much weight he lost as this &quot; insensible perspiration &quot; evaporated from the skin . But it wasn ' t until a_few decades later that Dutch physician Hermann Boerhaave became the first to describe sweat_glands . And nobody counted them until the mid-19th Century , when a German corpse was put_under microscope and anatomists found some 2 # 381 , 248 of the tiny coiled organs ( later studies determined the number varies from 2 million to 4 million , covering every square_inch of the body save the lips ) . The next great strides in sweat science occurred in 1888 with Mum ( the first trademarked deodorant ) , the early 1900s with Everdry and Odo-ro-no ( the first antiperspirant and first nationally advertised deodorant , respectively ) and during the Eisenhower era , with the invention of roll-ons and aerosols . Air conditioning , pioneered in 1902 , was also a big breakthrough in anti-sweat technology . &quot; If you cannot install air conditioning , &quot; writes Miami humor columnist Dave Barry , &quot; I suggest you perspire . Perspiring is Mother Nature ' s own natural cooling_system . When you ' re in a situation involving great warmth or stress , such_as summer or an audience with the Queen , your sweat_glands , located in your armpits , rouse themselves and start pumping out perspiration , which makes your garments smell like a dead rodent , which is Mother Nature ' s way of telling you she wants you to take them off and get naked . Of course the average person cannot always get naked , let alone when with the Queen , so many people put anti-perspirant chemicals on their armpits ; this forces Mother Nature to reroute the perspiration to the mouth , where it forms bad breath , which is Mother Nature ' s way of telling you she is basically a vicious irresponsible slut. &quot;</TEXT>
