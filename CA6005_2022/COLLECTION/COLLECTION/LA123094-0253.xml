   <HEADLINE> AROUND TOWN : A MATCH MADE IN THE HEAVENS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Rotary_International ' s float rolls along the Rose Parade route Monday , a Martian and an astronaut will be playing Frisbee with a Martian dog and an Earth dog . And an arrow will be pointing toward space and the Paulharris asteroid . Our story begins on Sept . 8 , 1988 , when planetary scientist Eleanor Helin , peering through a telescope at Palomar Observatory northeast of San Diego , discovered a potato-shaped asteroid about 10 miles in diameter . Protocol -- and sound science -- dictate that a newly identified asteroid be observed three times in its orbit around the sun and then , Helin said , &quot; It ' s up_to the discoverer to give it a name. &quot; Having been duly &quot; recovered , &quot; or verified , by astronomers worldwide , this asteroid was , in time , entered in the international log published in Russia as No . 5349 , there having been 5 # 348 others entered since the first recorded asteroid sighting in Sicily 187 years earlier . Then one recent day , Helin , who heads the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey and International Near-earth Asteroid Survey at NASA ' s Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , happened to sit next to former Caltech alumni association president Theodore Combs at a banquet . Combs , a Rotarian , was thinking_about the globe-spanning theme for this year ' s float , &quot; Building Universal Friendship , &quot; and about how Rotary has raised $ 240 million-plus with a goal of eradicating polio worldwide by 2000 . &quot; Would it be appropriate , &quot; he asked Helin , &quot; to name an asteroid for the founder of Rotary_International ? &quot; It was serendipity . Said Helin : &quot; He did not know that I had had polio. &quot; As a 5-year-old growing_up in Pasadena , she contracted the disease and was bedridden for a year . &quot; It was a struggle , &quot; she said , and her father was tireless in helping her overcome the paralysis . He happened also to have been a Rotarian . All in all , Helin said , &quot; I felt this is most fitting. &quot; For 25 years , Helin has devoted her life to sighting and tracking asteroids , which are minor_planets , fragmented rocky bodies left over from the creation of the solar_system . Unlike comets , which are sort of rocky snowballs , asteroids are iceless . Most are so-called main-belt asteroids , moving_in nearly circular orbits between those of Mars and Jupiter . But there are also asteroids whose orbits bring them close to Earth . It is these -- about 340 are known -- that most intrigue Helin . She describes Paulharris as an inner-belt asteroid , one of those thought of as &quot; precursors to the near-Earth asteroids. &quot; With a little bump from another body , they could be flung into near-Earth space . Paulharris &quot; kisses the orbit of Mars , which is significant. &quot; It would &quot; certainly be a flyby , &quot; and maybe a stop , for travelers to Mars . Since 1973 , Helin and her team have discovered 90 near-Earth asteroids , about 30 % to 35 % of all identified over that time . She has been credited with more discoveries than any scientist in the world . The discoverer may name an asteroid for a friend , a scientist , a place . Helin named one Druyan ( for astronomer Carl Sagan ' s wife , Ann ) . Sagan already had his . Now , Helin explains , they can be &quot; in eternal space together. &quot; She named one Pauling ( for the late chemist Linus ) . She plans to name one Occidental , for her alma_mater , Occidental College . An asteroid she discovered in September , 1978 , just after the Camp David peace accord between Israel and Egypt , is called Ra-Shalom -- that ' s Ra , for the Egyptian sun god , and Shalom , the Hebrew word for peace . Other namers have gone commercial ( which is frowned_upon ) or quirky . There ' s Swissair . And there ' s Roddenberry , for &quot; Star Trek &quot; creator Gene . Because the naming committee of the International Astronomical Union likes to keep things simple , it prefers single names -- thus , Paulharris . &quot; ' Harris ' was taken , &quot; Helin explained , &quot; and ' Paul ' is not distinctive enough. &quot; There was nothing controversial about an extraterrestrial accolade for this Chicago attorney who founded Rotary in 1905 . The names the committee has resisted have been those carrying political baggage . A ruler of an &quot; unfriendly &quot; nation , for example . Helin estimates that two-thirds of the 6 # 000 known asteroids are now named . At first , she said , they really went_through the Greek and Roman_mythology . &quot; Now all_of the important Greek gods and goddesses have been used . One may find a son of Apollo or a grandniece of Hermes. &quot; Fittingly , a colleague named an asteroid for her . that ' s asteroid Glo , the nickname by which friends , family and fellow_workers know Helin . Each new discovery keeps her recharged . She said that some of them have come very close to Earth , and there ' s always a chance of &quot; finding an object really on a collision course &quot; with us . She and other scientists are also identifying asteroids that &quot; might be good candidates for a ( manned space ) mission. &quot; In 1997-98 , she mentioned , the Japanese are going_to collect samples on Nereus , &quot; one of my asteroids. &quot; She is among the scientists who believe that it was a large asteroid , perhaps six miles in diameter , that did_in the dinosaurs when it struck the Yucatan_Peninsula 65 million years ago , plunging Earth into cold and darkness . &quot; There are hundreds of thousands of objects &quot; of significant size out there , said Helin , who ' s spent many long nights at telescopes from Mauna Kea to Scandinavia . Should an asteroid the size of a football_field hit a city ( an unlikely scenario ) , &quot; it would be disastrous , &quot; Helin said . The explosive impact would set_off &quot; massive shock_waves , &quot; earthquakes and tidal_waves , and obscure the sky for weeks . Helin is not speculating on the odds of that but , she said , she would gamble that within the next 100 years an asteroid more_than 100 feet in diameter will plunge to Earth somewhere with &quot; stunning and alarming impact for people . It ' s something that would certainly get our attention. &quot; What are earthlings to do ? There has been talk_of intercepting a plummeting asteroid with a nuclear space_probe and nudging it into a different orbit . But , Helin said , &quot; It ' s years before we ' ll really be able to alter an orbit &quot; effectively . Meanwhile , on Monday , parade-watchers will see that sign pointing to asteroid Paulharris some whimsical number of millions of miles away . And the real Paulharris ? It has an orbital period around the sun of about 4.5 years and will next be seen clearly over Southern California in August , 1997 . * If , as has been said , Angelenos are what they drive , these recent license-plate sightings do give one pause : JACKRIPR and CHNSAW 1 . Other favorites from our personalized-plates file : on a gold Lexus , GATS B . On a white Mercedes , A2 BRTUS . And , finally , one perhaps to be avoided during rush_hour : a white Mitsubishi identifying its driver as MS MAGOO .</TEXT>
