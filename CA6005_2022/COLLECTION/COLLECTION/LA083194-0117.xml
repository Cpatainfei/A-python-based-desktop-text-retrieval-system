   <HEADLINE> IN CHINA , BROWN CITES SUCCESS ON TRADE , RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown asserted Tuesday that a new U.S. emphasis on &quot; commercial diplomacy &quot; toward China is not only producing big trade deals but also progress on human_rights . A formal U.S.-China dialogue on human_rights issues , suspended in the spring , will resume in late September when Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visits the United States , Brown announced at a news_conference here . While resumption of talks will not automatically benefit Chinese dissidents , Brown treated renewal of the dialogue as a significant step . &quot; Commercial engagement has had a greater impact than the threat of commercial disengagement , &quot; he said , adding that he was &quot; exhilarated by the results of our first 2 1 / 2 days in Beijing. &quot; Since Brown ' s arrival Saturday , executives of leading U.S. corporations traveling with him have &quot; already signed agreements with a total value of almost $ 5 billion , &quot; he said . &quot; We came_with high expectations about our ability to have a profoundly positive impact on the bilateral relationship between China and the United States , &quot; he said . &quot; We have already met and surpassed those expectations. &quot; The overall tone of Brown ' s remarks Tuesday , both at the news_conference and in a business lunch speech , was the warmest here by any top U.S. official since the 1989 crackdown on the Tian An Men Square pro-democracy protests . President Clinton severed the link between human_rights and trade issues in May . But Brown went_further in his comments Tuesday , stressing that while the United States wants to see human_rights progress here , threats are of no use . &quot; You can adopt a ' feel-good ' policy , which causes you to have the ability to make strong statements and achieve no results from those statements , &quot; Brown said . &quot; Or you can adopt a pragmatic , common-sense policy , which helps you achieve your goals. &quot; In a lunch speech to U.S. and Chinese business representatives , Brown outlined a vision of &quot; commercial diplomacy &quot; that he said can bring greater shared prosperity to the two nations and the world . &quot; The United States has sent substantive signals that we regard China as a commercial ally and a partner -- that China ' s long history is deserving of respect and even deference that she has not always received , &quot; Brown said to the business group . &quot; Once divided by ideology , we are now drawn_together by shared economic interests. &quot; Brown brushed_off a threat made Monday by his counterpart , Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi , that if China ' s effort to join the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) by the year ' s end is unsuccessful , Beijing will no longer be bound by previous trade and economic commitments . Asked at his news_conference whether Wu ' s comments cast any cloud_over the generally upbeat tone of his visit , Brown said : &quot; You have to be a pretty negative person to be looking_for a cloud today , with the incredible progress that we ' ve made in just 2 1 / 2 days . I don ' t see any cloud . I think we continue to make progress in our discussions with the Chinese &quot; about GATT . The mood of exhilarated optimism , reminiscent_of attitudes often shown by high-level U.S. delegations to China in the 1970s and 1980s , was also evident among the 24 executives of leading U.S. corporations traveling with Brown . &quot; I ' ve been extremely pleased with the dialogue , with the opening_up , &quot; said Leslie McCraw , chairman and chief_executive_officer of Fluor Corp . &quot; The attitude of the Chinese has been exceptionally positive . . . . We view China as clearly one of the great emerging market opportunities for a company like ours. &quot; Brown ' s visit marks a shift of the main focus in U.S.-China relations &quot; to business issues , commercial issues , rather than philosophical issues , &quot; McCraw said . &quot; I think these other agendas can be addressed if we are engaged commercially. &quot; Details of most of the agreements cited by Brown were not immediately released . While the sums involved totaled more_than $ 4.7 billion , not all_of this amount represents U.S. sales . Entergy Corp . said Tuesday it signed a memorandum of understanding , in partnership with the Lippo Group in Hong Kong , for a Chinese power_plant deal it valued at $ 1 billion . Brown presided at a signing ceremony for the Wing Group to build a $ 2.2-billion liquefied-natural-gas turbine . AES China Generating Co. , a joint_venture with Virginia-based AES Corp. , signed a $ 1.5-billion contract to upgrade a power_plant . TRW Inc. announced that with a Chinese partner , Suman Group Ltd. , it signed an agreement with Beijing Cable TV Network to supply 1 million de-scrambler units for household delivery of television programming . Sprint Communications Corp . announced a pact to expand China ' s connections to the global Internet service , which links an estimated 2 million computers in 154 countries .</TEXT>
