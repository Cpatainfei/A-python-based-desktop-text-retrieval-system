   <HEADLINE> DISPLAY OF EMOTION ; POWERFUL EXHIBIT AT IRVINE HIGH RECALLS HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While some students ran , laughed and finished their lunches on sunny Tuesday afternoon at Irvine High_School , the mood inside the school ' s darkened theater was solemn . * The haunting score from the film &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; played in the background as students moved slowly and nearly silently through a display of photographs and posters describing the rise of Nazism in Germany and the genocide of millions . &quot; I can ' t even look_at this one , &quot; said senior Jessica Hess , 18 , quickly turning from a picture of a Jewish woman cradling her baby as a soldier points a rifle at them . The exhibit from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles is part of a weeklong series of events at the school titled &quot; Celebrating Our Diversity Together. &quot; The goal of the exhibit is to provide students with a jolting lesson about the Holocaust . It certainly had that effect on many of the 50 students who helped organize it . &quot; I got choked_up when I talked_about it , &quot; said Hess , one of a group of students who guided visitors through the display . &quot; My emotions get_into it as well as the words themselves. &quot; For the exhibit , students and faculty_members transformed the theater into a dark memorial to victims of the Holocaust . The posters and photos provided by the Wiesenthal Center were arranged on the theater_stage below a giant swastika illuminated by red stage lights . &quot; It ' s not the same as if this had been done_in the daylight , &quot; said junior Rosa Tena , 16 , another program volunteer . &quot; It ' s not a normal exhibit . People take it more seriously. &quot; Since the exhibit opened Monday , it has been visited not only by students but also by community residents . &quot; People are shocked by it . They talk_about it a lot afterward , &quot; said senior Casey Teele , 17 . &quot; It creates a lasting impression. &quot; That is exactly the goal , said English_teacher Eamon Kane , who designed the exhibit and helped bring it to Irvine High . &quot; Students are silenced by it , if not sobered by it , &quot; Kane said . The volunteers spent several weekends researching the Holocaust and meeting with a concentration_camp survivor . They also visited the Wiesenthal Center to familiarize themselves with the often graphic images . The students said that some of the exhibit photos are difficult to view , such_as one showing parents separated from their child by a wire fence . Senior Anat Sharoni , 17 , said that helping to organize the exhibit gave her new insights into the Holocaust , even though her own Jewish grandmother lived through the experience in Europe . &quot; I tried to communicate with my grandma , but she was too depressed by &quot; the Holocaust , Sharoni said . Hess , whose Jewish relatives survived the Holocaust , said : &quot; My family never spoke_of it . My ( relatives ) went_to their graves without speaking about it . Unfortunately , I won ' t know about their experiences . But I have learned more about what happened. &quot; The exhibit will be open_to the public today from 3 to 7 p.m. Irvine High_School is at 4321 Walnut Ave .</TEXT>
