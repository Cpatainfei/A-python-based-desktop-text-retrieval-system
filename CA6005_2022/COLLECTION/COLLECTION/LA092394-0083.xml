   <TEXT> Controversy over darts ? Pub players have tossed their pointed projectiles at pie-shaped targets in the time-honored way since the game originated_in 15th-Century England . The Pilgrims are said to have brought the game to America aboard the Mayflower . So , what in the name of Myles Standish is that . . . . that thing standing in a smoky corner of The Rock , a Canoga Park tavern owned by Philip McGovern -- an Englishman , for heaven ' s sake ? It looks_like a dartboard . It plays like a dartboard . By George , it is a dartboard . Only this one has hundreds of tiny holes to catch plastic soft-tip darts . Scores are recorded electronically in a computerized game punctuated by whistles and bells . What ' s more , competitors must deposit 50 cents to play . Call it darts on Astroturf . Purists call it blasphemy . &quot; Some people are against it , and I quite agree that it ' s pathetic , &quot; said McGovern , who has nine dart machines in The Rock and two other San Fernando Valley-area bars . &quot; But I love it because I make money on the machines . They ' re becoming very popular. &quot; Too popular , some say . In fact , the soft-tip game is at the bull ' s-eye in a pointed dispute that has polarized the pubs . Modernists raise their glasses to the user-friendly , yuppie version of darts . Traditionalists mutter in their schooners that arcade gimmickry is making a mockery of their sacred game of throwing skill . &quot; I thought they were a joke right to begin with , &quot; said Brian Caldwell , a native of England and manager of Scotland_Yard , a British Pub in Canoga Park that caters exclusively to old-fashioned , steel-tip players . &quot; We ' ve got the real darts here. &quot; The feeling is mutual at the The Royal Oak in North Hollywood , another steel-tip stronghold where plastic is pooh-poohed . &quot; Plastic is OK , I guess , for people who don ' t have any ambition , &quot; said Eddie Harmston , a regular at The Royal Oak . &quot; There ' s no brain work involved in plastic . You don ' t even have to be able to count to 10 . To me , plastic is like a toy. &quot; Novelty or not , the soft-tip game has steadily gained popularity in the Valley area since one of the machines first appeared in a Van Nuys bar in 1984 . In fact , soft-tip players today outnumber their steel-tip counterparts nearly 3 to 1 among those participating in local leagues . Dozens of bars sponsoring soft-tip play entice competitors with prize_money . Pub owners are encouraged by soft-tip promoters offering to organize leagues and share revenue deposited into machines they provide . Avid soft-tip players drop as much as $ 25 a week into the machines . But the big draw is simplicity . Soft-tip players don ' t have to understand arcane variations of dart games or complicated rules . The machine is programmed for several games that players select at the press of a button . Not only does the computer register scores , it instructs players when and where to throw their next dart . All they have to do is aim and throw . &quot; Everything else is going computers these days . Darts might as well , too , &quot; said George Richardson , who competes in soft-tip leagues at The Rock and at other bars . &quot; that ' s what I like about it. &quot; It ' s also what critics hate . For purists who prefer to play with dartboards made of compressed sisal , a sturdy fiber obtained from the agave plant , the very notion of not keeping one ' s own score is ludicrous . Keeping score and knowing how to proceed in a game are a player ' s responsibilities , they say . Also , soft-tip play eliminates &quot; chalking , &quot; the traditional task of tallying scores that idle players perform . Steel-tip enthusiasts also are turned_off by lightweight plastic darts , which do not exceed 16 grams . teel-tip darts can weigh as much as 50 grams , although most players choose darts that weigh between 21 and 25 grams . &quot; Soft-tip is for a different type of dart shooter , &quot; said Patrick Mulcahy , manager of The Royal Oak . &quot; It ' s like comparing golf to pitch-and-putt . We used to have ( a machine ) in here , but it just gathered dust . We had a league , and it just died away. &quot; Extinction might come sooner for the steel-tip game . In some bars where the two games coexist , steel-tip darts have become relics . And some soft-tip proponents boldly predict that in 10 years , steel-tip play will be dead as a dodo bird . &quot; I ' ve been saying it ' s a dinosaur , &quot; said Larry Hill , who leases 190 machines to more_than 100 venues out of his Van Nuys store , Darts and Things . Hill is tournament director of the California Soft-Tip Dart Assn. , which runs 35 leagues involving more_than 1 # 000 players . &quot; One clique of people will continue to play steel-tip , &quot; Hill said . &quot; But they ' ll be playing the same people over and over during the next 20 years. &quot; Die-hard steel-tip players concede that their following is declining . Membership in the Southern California Dart Assn. , a governing body of the steel-tip game , stands at about 800 compared to about 3 # 200 in 1984 . About 75 % of association members compete in_leagues affiliated with 16 Valley bars or lodges , says Mel Katz , the association ' s president . Katz blames the presence of soft-tip machines for contributing to the decline in steel-tip participation -- not only in_leagues but among those who play just for fun . &quot; It ' s always been you could walk in off the street , pick_up a set of darts from the bartender and play for free , &quot; Katz said . &quot; The individuals who have made the machines and the individuals who supply the machines are the ones who are making the money , and it ' s turned_out to be big business. &quot; Players ' preferences aside , economics indeed plays a role in the dart debate . About 1 # 000 Valley-area soft-tip players compete for prize_money in_leagues sponsored by Medalist Marketing , a Seattle-based company that manufactures soft-tip machines and sanctions regional and national competition . Steel-tip leagues , which the dart association charges players $ 28 to join , offer no prize_money . Medalist players pay league registration fees of between $ 10 and $ 20 for a typical 14-week season . Those successful in_league play are invited to compete in a biannual regional tournament in Burbank that attracts hundreds of players . Tournament entrants can win as much as $ 500 apiece , depending_on how far their team advances . More money can be won at an annual national tournament in Reno , Nev. , that attracts about 2 # 500 Medalist players and boasts a total purse in excess of $ 175 # 000 . Players reaching the pinnacle of competition can win as much as $ 2 # 000 . The majority of soft-tip players , however , wind_up playing for fun . But the incentive to win money is an attraction , says Jerry Indik , who operates a Medalist League and his own soft-tip leagues out of his Golden State Darts and Games store in Chatsworth . &quot; that ' s why soft-tip play has become so_much more competitive , &quot; Indik said . &quot; The best players in the United States today are playing soft-tip. &quot; Indik ' s attitude might be indicative_of things to come . A former steel-tipped competitor once ranked fourth in the nation by the United States Darting Assn. , Indik today embraces the plastic game as the future of darts . &quot; Once people play soft-tip , they don ' t want to play steel-tip , &quot; Indik said . &quot; Soft-tip players don ' t hold a grudge against steel-tip players . It ' s just the reversal . It ' s that English influence that pooh-poohs the whole idea of soft-tip. &quot; Katz of the dart association insists his brethren harbor no grudges but share a passion for a game they fear might be fading_away . For decades , steel-tip players have played only for pleasure and plaques . Those who simply wish to play for fun have played for free . that ' s the way darts should be , Katz says . And that ' s the way darts should stay . &quot; They ' re not promoting the game of darts , they ' re promoting a game for profit , &quot; Katz said of his soft-tip counterparts . &quot; I have nothing against people who want to play soft-tip . Just take a lot of quarters with you. &quot; Where to Go What : Information on joining soft-tip dart leagues .
