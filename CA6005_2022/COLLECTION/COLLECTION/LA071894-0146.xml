   <HEADLINE> BRAZIL BEATS ITALY FOR WORLD CUP IN DRAMATIC PENALTY-KICK SHOWDOWN ; SOCCER : FIRST TOURNAMENT IN U.S. IS ALSO FIRST WITH CHAMPIONSHIP GAME THAT ENDS IN A SCORELESS TIE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a dramatic finish to the first World Cup in the United States , two teams with long and proud soccer traditions seemed to give everything they had for 120 minutes in the Rose Bowl on Sunday . Then they were asked to give more to decide which would become the first four-time world champion . Ultimately , Brazil was rewarded , but the game was so close and the method of determining the winner so fickle that it would have been difficult for the crowd of 94 # 194 or the worldwide television audience estimated at 2 billion to find_fault_with Italy as champion . For the first time since the World Cup originated_in 1930 , the championship game ended in a scoreless tie as both teams , acknowledging their respect for each other , played cautiously for 90 minutes of regulation_time and 30 minutes of overtime . The tension then was turned_up a notch as the weary teams engaged in a penalty-kick showdown , a controversial system of settling tie games that many coaches and players believe is as fair as roulette . Introduced into the World Cup in 1982 , this was the first time it had ever been required for the final game . With the grueling battle reduced to a game_of_chance , the gods of soccer anointed Brazil . Italy scored on only two of its five shots from the penalty spot 12 yards in front of the goal , eliminating the need for the Brazilians even to take their fifth shot after they had converted three of their first four . The last man with a chance to keep the Italians alive was forward Roberto Baggio , who had scored five goals in his last three games to enhance his status as the nation ' s soccer hero . He did nothing to alter that Sunday , running all afternoon with a strained hamstring that had threatened to keep him on the sideline for the championship game . But when it came time for him to face Brazilian goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel in the shootout , Baggio was spent . His shot sailed high over the net . While Brazilian players gathered_in the middle of the field to celebrate , Baggio stood on the penalty spot with his head down for several long moments before sagging to one knee . &quot; Brazil is again No . 1 , &quot; said the Brazilians ' coach , Carlos Alberto Parreira , of their fourth championship , their first since Pele led them to titles in 1958 , ' 62 and ' 70 . The Italians , champions in 1934 , ' 38 and ' 82 , did not argue the point , but they knew that it could have just as easily been they who were holding the World Cup trophy at the end . &quot; It was only luck , &quot; Italian defender Luigi Appolloni said . &quot; Unfortunately , it is more difficult to lose this way. &quot; No matter how the championship game is judged as a test of strategy , tactics and skill , soccer enthusiasts no doubt will conclude that the one-month , 52-game World Cup -- played_at nine sites in the United States -- was a triumph for the sport . In a country with little soccer tradition , the total number of spectators was 3 # 567 , 415 . That is more_than a_million more_than the previous record set four years ago in Italy . The average attendance also was a record , 68 # 604 as compared to 53 # 675 in Italy . The eight games at the Rose Bowl attracted an average crowd of 89 # 478 . Those who attended Sunday , including Vice_President Al Gore and George and Barbara Bush , were treated to an American-style pregame ceremony that featured a flyover by Air_Force jets , fireworks and six songs by Whitney Houston . Then they sat_back in anticipation of a game that figured to have as_many high notes as the one Kenny G hit with his alto sax near the end of the &quot; The Star-Spangled Banner. &quot; It did not seem too_much to ask . The first 51 games had produced considerably more action than there was in 1990 in Italy , a tournament so devoid_of excitement that even the sports purists in the international soccer federation , FIFA , recognized that rule changes were necessary . The changes worked . Through Saturday ' s 4-0 victory by Sweden over Bulgaria in the consolation game at the Rose Bowl , 30 more goals had been scored than in Italy . More significantly , the ball was in motion seven minutes more per game . But neither Italy nor Brazil was completely committed to the attack Sunday . Perhaps it was because the six previous games had taken their toll , or perhaps it was because of the heat on the field at the Rose Bowl , or perhaps it was because both teams were undermanned . While Baggio had the celebrated hamstring injury , another crucial Italian player , defender Franco Baresi , was playing only three weeks after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery . Brazil lost one of its most versatile players , defender Jorginho , in the 21st minute . If the game had been scored like a prizefight , the Brazilians would have won on points because they were more aggressive . But even they did not allow their midfielders and central defenders to advance in support of forwards Romario and Bebeto as often as usual in fear of the Italians ' dangerous counterattack . There , however , was nothing very dangerous about the Italians on Sunday . They mustered only eight shots , two by Baggio . The Brazilians took 22 , but no more_than four tested Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca . Fifteen minutes from the end of regulation_time , a hard shot by midfielder Mauro Silva glanced off Pagliuca ' s hands and toward the goal . But the ball bounced harmlessly off the left post , which he gratefully kissed . When the game was finally over , Parreira admitted , &quot; It was not the most eloquent way to win. &quot; Bebeto agreed , saying that it was &quot; sad that the game was decided on penalty kicks. &quot; But , he added , there will be no sad faces in Brazil . &quot; I hope this lifts the morale of all_of Brazil , &quot; he said . &quot; The economics and financial picture there is bad . The lack of jobs and the poor children are a very big problem . I hope this victory will stimulate the government to improve the economic conditions. &quot; * WORLD CUP COVERAGE : A8 , C1 , C6-C15 , Section W</TEXT>
