   <TEXT> Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis , the most elegant , cultured yet tragic First_Lady of the modern era , died Thursday night of cancer . She was 64 . At her side in her spacious 5th Avenue apartment were her daughter , Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg , 36 ; her son , John F . Kennedy Jr. , 33 , and her longtime companion Maurice Tempelsman , a New York financier and diamond dealer . &quot; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was a model of courage and dignity for all Americans and all_the world , &quot; President Clinton said in a statement . &quot; More_than any other woman of her time , she captivated our nation and the world with her intelligence , elegance and grace. &quot; Mrs . Onassis had entered New York Hospital-Cornell Medical_Center on Monday for further treatment of non-Hodgkin ' s lymphoma . But she asked to return to her apartment that faces Central_Park on Wednesday after doctors decided that the disease could not be stopped . &quot; There was nothing more to do for her , &quot; her close friend Nancy Tuckerman told reporters . As word of the gravity of her illness spread Thursday afternoon , crowds flocked to an exhibit in her honor at the John F . Kennedy Library in Boston to view , among other memorabilia , a film of her tour of the White_House as First_Lady and to gaze admiringly at the maroon-and-cream-colored gown she wore more_than 30 years ago at a White_House dinner . And it is , in fact , that vision of the First_Lady -- in a satin ball_gown or perhaps trim in a tailored suit and pillbox hat -- that most Americans will recall when they remember Mrs . Onassis . As the 31-year-old wife of John F . Kennedy , the 35th President of the United States , she set a standard of elegance , and with her handsome husband enlivened the country with a sense of youth and beauty . She immediately made a mark by transforming the White_House from the dowdy rec_room of the Eisenhower years into a historic jewel that was important not only on state occasions but also on weekdays when it was open for public tours . Yet so many indelible images remain of the lithe , dark-haired First_Lady . There were the Life magazine pictures of her as a young mother at Hyannis Port , slender in Capri-style white pants and a striped shirt , chasing_after her two small children on a warm summer ' s day . There was the desperate wife climbing over the back seat of the limousine where her husband lay mortally wounded in Dallas in 1963 . And finally , there was The First Widow , standing in low heels , tears barely visible behind a black veil as her 3-year-old son saluted the riderless horse at her husband ' s funeral . For the sake of fairy tale , the images should have ended there , with the 34-year-old widow quietly moving_into the countryside to ride horses , raise her children and preserve her husband ' s legend . Theodore H . White , in his memoir , &quot; In Search of History , &quot; recalls the night in Hyannis Port when he talked with then-Mrs . Kennedy from 8:30 in the morning until midnight about her late husband ' s White_House years . She purged herself of her husband ' s bloody assassination after the long day , he said . Then she found the thought she wanted . &quot; Her message was his message -- that one man , by trying , may change it all , &quot; White wrote . Thus , he said , she tried to frame her husband ' s legacy as the legend of Camelot . But Jackie Kennedy ' s fable did not quite stick . The myth was so often sullied by revelations of her husband ' s mistresses and manipulative behavior that periodic remembrances of Camelot are often tempered . And for the young widow , life also evolved . She went_on to live essentially two more lives . First , overseas with the wealthy and flamboyant Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis , who many said she married to escape a recklessly voyeuristic world . And later in a quiet , elite corner of Manhattan where she doted on her three grandchildren , worked as a book editor and made the social rounds for worthy causes . And on occasion , much the way she did as recently as Sunday , Mrs . Onassis simply blended in with the other strollers in Central_Park , usually holding hands with Tempelsman or trailing her toddling grandchildren . She survived being among the greatest female icons of the 20th Century by behaving almost perfectly . She maintained a rare grace and composure , refused to give_in to America ' s obsession with personal revelation and she not only outlived two husbands but prevailed over their disloyalty , achieving fame and fortune on_her_own terms . Known in later life for her trademark oversized sunglasses and by monikers such_as &quot; Jackie O , &quot; she has more entries in the Reader ' s Guide of Periodicals than almost anybody else ( and that does not include the 32 books about her ) . Yet she almost never talked to the media . While she may have been the most public &quot; private &quot; person in the world , to her colleagues in the publishing world where she toiled for 16 years , she was nothing less than intimate . Paul Golob , now a senior editor at Times Books who worked with Mrs . Onassis at Doubleday , said she took a genuine interest in young people in publishing and was often willing to take them under her wing . After Golob left Doubleday four years ago , they exchanged notes and she even invited him for tea and finger sandwiches in her apartment . On another occasion , during a discussion on a book he was working_on about politics , Golob recalled how &quot; she got a faraway look and told me how Jack would take her into the Senate Gallery and point_out Senators Russell and Mansfield . It was as if it were my mom telling me about what she and dad had done when they were first married . It was very personal and intimate. &quot; And it was not uncommon for the people who worked with her , Golob added , to see her in typical editor motion : &quot; sprinting down the hall to get something into someone ' s hands on deadline. &quot; This incarnation of her -- happy , caught_up in a workaday job -- is quite jarring considering the beginnings of Jacqueline Bouvier . She was born to an aristocratic family in Southampton , N.Y. Her father was John Vernon Bouvier III , an exotically handsome bon_vivant known as &quot; Black Jack &quot; who dwindled a $ 750 # 000 inheritance into a $ 100 # 000 estate . He was a serial womanizer who could not even get_through his honeymoon with Janet Lee -- daughter of a self-made millionaire -- without launching an affair . After having two daughters -- first Jacqueline and then Lee , 3 1 / 2 years later -- the Bouviers divorced . Jacqueline was only 10 years old . Though the girls lived with their mother , it was their father whom they adored and who continued to shape their sensibilities and direct their education . Their mother , meanwhile , plied them with a passion for social climbing -- and money . Jacqueline , who was studying ballet and taking riding lessons by the time she was 5 , attended the best schools : Miss Porter ' s and Miss Chapin ' s , where she listed in her yearbook that her goal was &quot; not to be a housewife. &quot; Unhappy at Vassar College , she rebelled by eating pastries and studying all night . After a junior year at the Sorbonne in Paris she returned to finish her degree in 1951 at George_Washington University . Instead of taking the Prix de Paris essay prize that she won from Vogue magazine and spending a year in Paris , she accepted a $ 42.50-a-week job as an &quot; inquiring photographer &quot; at the Washington Times-Herald . It was then that the 23-year-old Bouvier met Jack_Kennedy , 12 years her senior , at a dinner_party at the home of his friend , journalist Charles Bartlett . At the time Bouvier was engaged to a New York stockbroker , but she apparently couldn ' t resist a dashing young_man so_much like her father . From accounts in several books -- both learned and lurid -- the young Jackie comes_across as a strong-minded , tough , yet sensitive woman who was attracted to the junior congressman from Massachusetts both for love and for his considerable family wealth . He was worth $ 10 million , so it was said , at the time of their meeting and her family ' s fortune was virtually dried_up . When they married in September , 1953 , in front of 3 # 000 guests , there is sufficient evidence that Jackie Kennedy had been appropriately warned about her husband ' s womanizing , his boisterous if not overbearing family and the Kennedy obsession with athletics . ( She broke an ankle early on trying to join in a game of touch football. ) The Kennedy sisters did not much take_to Jackie , ridiculing her little-girl voice and pronouncing her name &quot; Jacklean &quot; to rhyme with queen . She didn ' t much like them either , calling them &quot; the rah-rah girls. &quot; In the first six years of their marriage , John Kennedy spent most of the time campaigning , traversing his home state , traveling the country . Mostly , his wife disdained the role of campaigning spouse , apparently out of shyness and a dislike of crowds . Once in the White_House , though , she fulfilled seemingly well the role of the pre-feminist First_Lady : She was the epitome of womanhood . Hers was not the job to advise on health_care and foreign_policy ; rather , she dressed like a princess , hosted extraordinary parties and oversaw the upbringing of her children with the help of a British nanny . But America seemed willing to forgive such upper-class indulgences . Following in the footsteps of the matronly Mamie Eisenhower , Jackie , as the country came_to think_of her , was a glamorous model for women to pattern themselves after . When she made_it a mission to bring art and culture to the White_House , it was as if she were the country ' s chief docent . Televised evenings with performers such_as cellist Pablo Casals made Midwestern housewives feel that , for a moment , the same thing might happen in their own shag-carpeted living_rooms . As Mrs . Kennedy , she was nearly universally adored -- even when she was impatient with questions about her clothes or when her eyes glazed_over during her husband ' s speeches . She was so engaging that wherever her mind was drifting , the public was willing to slavishly follow . When she undertook the $ 2-million renovation of the White_House , then-Chief Usher J . Bernard West was astounded at her grasp of detail and at her ability to get things done at such a young age . &quot; She had a will of iron , &quot; West later wrote , &quot; with more determination than anyone I have ever met . Yet she was so soft-spoken , so deft and subtle that she could impose that will upon people without their ever knowing it. &quot; Yet while Jackie was said to have lived an oddly remote life in the White_House , she got her husband ' s attention when he got the bills for her clothing expenditures . Yet he was unable to reform her and , though the President was only making $ 100 # 000 a year , the family expenses rose from $ 105 # 446 in 1961 to $ 121 # 462 in 1962 . After the death of their infant son Patrick in the summer of 1963 -- following a miscarriage and the births of Caroline in 1957 and John in 1960 -- the First_Lady took a long cruise with her sister on the yacht of Lee ' s then-boyfriend Aristotle Onassis . When the First_Lady returned she was refreshed and relaxed . Former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee wrote : &quot; She greeted J.F.K. with the most affectionate embrace we ' d ever seen them give one another. &quot; In a month , the President was dead . It is still amazing to recall her presence_of_mind , of history and of theater in the hours and days after his assassination . As she was returning from Dallas , Lady Bird Johnson asked her if she wanted to change out of her blood-caked suit . Jackie declined , saying : &quot; I want them to see what they have done to Jack. &quot; Once back in Washington she had the Library of Congress research the details of Lincoln ' s funeral and immediately ordered the White_House upholsterers to drape the black cambric that was usually used to cover the bottoms of chairs over the windows , mantels and chandeliers because that was how it was done for Lincoln ' s wake . Her dignity at that time perhaps did the most to seal her persona -- she was frozen in that queenly pose , her face composed for the nation . &quot; When Jack was assassinated , &quot; said Michael Beschloss , presidential scholar and historian , &quot; it was a time in which America ' s image in front of the world could have been badly damaged . That she carried_off the next four days with such majesty not only retrieved American stature , but also increased it . Her place in history will probably pivot around those critical four days. &quot; In the next phase of her life the widow found the kind of security that her first marriage did not provide . She wanted to be financially set and protected , so she became a rich_man ' s adornment . Though she had more appropriate suitors -- including Lord Harlech and Robert McNamara -- by the spring of 1968 she was becoming increasingly involved with Onassis , who seemed always to be cruising the Mediterranean in his yacht &quot; Christina. &quot; With its El Grecos and bar stools covered in leather , it was a far_cry from the_French vermeil candelabrum and satin draperies of the White_House . But perhaps that was the point . In 1968 , Robert F . Kennedy , who was trying to follow his brother into the White_House , urged her to wait to announce her engagement to Onassis . &quot; For God ' s sake , Jackie , &quot; he reportedly said , &quot; that could cost me five states. &quot; She agreed , for Bobby ' s sake , to wait , but he too was killed and his death changed everything . Mrs . Kennedy told friends : &quot; I despise America and I don ' t want my children to live here anymore . If they ' re killing Kennedys , my kids are No . 1 targets. &quot; As news of her engagement to Onassis reached the heartland , America wept that the woman they wanted to remember in a cloud of white chiffon and a tiara could end_up with a Greek tycoon . But on Oct . 10 , 1968 , on the island of Skorpios , Onassis and Mrs . Kennedy were married during a ceremony that was conducted mostly in Greek . She was 39 ; he was 62 . It rained that day -- which Greeks consider to be a good omen . But a month later Onassis was photographed with his old flame , opera singer Maria Callas , and the new Mrs . Onassis again was embroiled with an unfaithful man -- though this time she was at least well-kept in privacy . Though their marriage was long over -- Onassis had even hired Roy Cohn to begin divorce proceedings -- the shipping magnate ' s death in 1975 made any official separation a moot issue . Widowed a second time , she ended_up with $ 26 million after reaching an agreement with her stepdaughter , Christina , who had little affection for his father ' s American wife . After visiting the dying Onassis in a New York hospital , she coolly summed_up their life together : &quot; Aristotle Onassis rescued me at a time when my life was engulfed in shadows . He meant a lot to me . He brought me into a world where one could find happiness and love. &quot; Six months later , she was back in her 15-room New York apartment , working_at Viking Press as a consulting editor for $ 200 a week . She worked there two years when the publisher , without consulting her , bought a Jeffrey Archer novel based on Edward M . Kennedy , who becomes President and then is the target of an assassination attempt . She immediately quit and later joined Doubleday , moving_into a novice editor ' s windowless office . During her tenure at Doubleday , Mrs . Onassis edited a wide variety of books reflecting her urbane mind and keen aesthetic and a devotion to the arts , particularly music , ballet and the visual arts . A particular favorite , according to a rare interview she gave to Publishers Weekly a year ago , was the lavishly illustrated &quot; A Second Paradise : Indian Courtly Life 1590-1947 &quot; by Naveen Patnaik . There have been many histories -- from the exotic to the painfully dry -- on her list , but her tastes were broad enough to include editing Michael Jackson ' s wildly popular &quot; Moonwalk , &quot; children ' s books by Carly Simon and a history of cartoons . &quot; I ' m drawn to books that are out of our regular experience , &quot; Mrs . Onassis told Publishers Weekly . &quot; Books of other cultures , ancient histories . I ' m interested in the arts in_general , especially the creative process . I ' m fascinated by hearing artists talk_about their craft . To me , a wonderful book is one that takes me on a journey into something I didn ' t know before. &quot; In the end , her legacy was so enormous it is hard to characterize . After years of research to &quot; get past the myth , &quot; celebrity biographer Kitty Kelley offered one of the first non-fawning sketches of the world ' s favorite widow with her 1978 best-seller , &quot; Jackie Oh ! &quot; Kelley wrote that Onassis indulged herself with handmade bed_linens and extravagant silk lingerie , including underpants costing hundreds of dollars per pair . She was portrayed by employees and even some friends as a cold , pretentious , plotting woman whose chief virtue was her devotion to her children . Besides the books there were made-for-TV-movies and songs by groups like Human Sexual Response with lyrics like &quot; I want to be Jackie Onassis , oh yeah , oh yeah. &quot; A disco was named for her . Andy Warhol did a silk-screen of her . But in all that is written and all that is said , the country will never penetrate the mystery . For she managed to keep the world at_bay as she returned in the third phase of her life to the eternal verities -- family , books , and a quiet life with a kind , slightly pudgy man . She remained that Mona Lisa face that you could look_at endlessly and see flashes of all her past faces -- the sweet girl in riding jodhpurs , the First_Lady in a tiara , the tear-smeared widow , the pampered wife . And finally the wide dark eyes , edged with fine wrinkles , watching a world that always was watching her . Times staff writers Robin Wright in Washington , Elizabeth Mehren in Boston , Stanley Meisler in New York and Pamela Warrick in Los Angeles contributed to this report .</TEXT>
