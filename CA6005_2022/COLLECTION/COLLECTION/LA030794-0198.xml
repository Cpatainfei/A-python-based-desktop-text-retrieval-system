   <HEADLINE> BATTLING THE TRADE IMBALANCE WITH BAGELS AND MINK HATS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> These days , many people have ideas about how to shrink the U.S. trade_deficit . Some want sanctions . Others believe_in a stronger Japanese yen . Kiichirou Ayano tried bagels . Ayano , a Japanese trade representative , scoured his country on behalf of two American bagel entrepreneurs who thought the Japanese were ready for something more adventurous than raw fish . &quot; I tried six or seven months for these people , but no success , &quot; Ayano said , looking crestfallen . &quot; There is no Japanese market at present. &quot; Ayano is part of a team that may go_down as the oddest byproduct of the trade dispute between the United States and Japan . Nearly four decades ago , a booming Japan posted trade representatives such_as Ayano to the United States to promote its exports . Recently , though , as the U.S. trade_deficit with Japan has soared , the 21 senior trade advisers were ordered to do an about-face and promote U.S. exports to Japan . That means crisscrossing the United States , exhorting Americans to manufacture bigger hats for the Japanese head and smaller teacups for the Japanese home . It also means persuading the Japanese that they really do need kayaks made in Seattle , glow-in-the-dark dogs from New York and log_cabins built_in Michigan . &quot; One of my callings is to export good products from the U.S. , even if it ' s a very little bit , &quot; Ayano said . &quot; That is my duty. &quot; A day spent with Ayano shows it ' s no easy task . First stop on the rainy , cold day was an unheated ceramics studio in Brooklyn . There , Jamaican-born artist Noel Copeland was painting pink and blue Rastafarian characters with flowing dreadlocks onto platters and sushi plates . Never mind Japan ' s ancient tradition of exquisite china . Rasta is_on the way . &quot; These kind of products are a different taste , &quot; said Ayano , who ' s helping Copeland sell to a Japanese boutique . &quot; Very funky. &quot; On to a tiny Harlem fur shop , where Steven Cottman hopes to export mink baseball_caps to Japan . Ayano urges him to make his hats bigger and rounder , for Japanese heads . Next was Kate Kennedy in lower Manhattan . Like Copeland and Cottman , the ebullient Kennedy met the Japanese representative through a government export program , this one run_by the regional Port Authority . Kennedy was beaming . Thanks to Ayano , her glow-in-the-dark plastic dog necklaces were featured in a Japanese import magazine . She ' s gotten several orders . Now , Ayano said , a Japanese entrepreneur wants to license the design for Glow Dogs . Kennedy said she ' d like to shift all her production to the Far East . &quot; I think it would be more cost-effective , &quot; she said , but added , &quot; I don ' t know if I ' m betraying my country. &quot; &quot; We are helping only made-in-America , &quot; Ayano later told a reporter . The Japan External Trade Organization , which employs the advisers , estimates it was responsible_for $ 150 million of U.S. exports to Japan last year . that ' s a small sum compared to the $ 59 billion U.S. merchandise trade_deficit with Japan . Still , Ayano defends his mission to assist small businesses . If General Motors or Ford wants to export to Japan , Ayano said , &quot; they have the resources . The small or mid-size company has no such resources. &quot; For all his efforts , Ayano said , fewer than 10 % of the companies he assists succeed in exporting . Some just have the wrong products , he said . Others run_up against government regulations . Ayano admits that Glow Dogs and Rastafarian pottery won ' t match Japan ' s prodigious exports of cars and fax machines . But he hopes the number of small U.S. exporters will continue to grow .</TEXT>
