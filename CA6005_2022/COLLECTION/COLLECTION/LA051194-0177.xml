   <TEXT> In the jail known as Sailor ' s Rest , every detainee looks exhausted . Every dim cell is a dormitory crammed with bunk_beds , each bed shared by up_to four men . They sleep fitfully , in shifts , while others must stand . Cigarette smoke and clotheslines full of graying underwear add_to the dank , unbearable closeness . The toilet , behind the curtain in the corner and nothing but a hole in the floor , fuels the stench . Only the cockroaches thrive . &quot; I see everything as through a fog . Most of the time I am not sure whether I am asleep or awake , &quot; says Vladimir A . Kopylov , on_trial after 4 1 / 2 years in Sailor ' s Rest for alleged default_on a Soviet bank loan . &quot; We breathe like fish out of water . For lack of oxygen it ' s sometimes hard to light a match . &quot; My reserves of endurance are gone , &quot; the frail , 47-year-old businessman adds in a courtroom interview . &quot; I cannot imagine I will ever leave this hell. &quot; Kopylov is one of nearly a quarter million people in Russia who are imprisoned but not proven guilty , and their ranks are swelling as overworked police and judges wage a crude , uphill battle against crime . Officials acknowledge that the long wait for trial and the nightmarish conditions behind bars are the most widespread human_rights abuses of Russia ' s post-Soviet era . Visits to two pretrial prisons , in Moscow and Tula , offered a look_at the overcrowding and its effects -- spreading disease , shortages of food and medicine , the suffocating stink . Officials in both prisons said they feel powerless to improve things and fear a summer of unrest . In interviews elsewhere , former inmates and prisoner rights advocates described frequent , if not systematic , beatings by guards . They said many inmates are disciplined by being stripped to their underwear in cold isolation cells , where there is even less food and no bedding . Physical punishment is also reported in Russia ' s labor camps , which hold about 650 # 000 sentenced convicts . Labor is still compulsory , but camp conditions have improved since Soviet times ; they are less crowded and more humane than pretrial prisons -- so_much so that some detainees confess to crimes they didn ' t commit just to move from hell to purgatory . Russia ' s treatment of prisoners is not exceptional on a global scale . It cannot be compared to the terrors of Stalin or the abuses in many countries run_by dictators or brutalized by war . Some jurisdictions in the United States and Western Europe also impose harsher conditions on arrested suspects than on convicted criminals . But Russia has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world , and the lot of its prisoners is a volatile , if hidden , indicator of progress from Soviet dictatorship to the rule_of_law . By its own measure , President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s government is faltering . &quot; To be quite frank , the conditions of our pretrial detention centers , by international standards , may be classified as torture , &quot; Maj . Gen . Yuri I . Kalinin , the Interior Ministry official who oversees most of Russia ' s prisons , admitted in an interview . &quot; It is deprivation of sleep , air , space . &quot; In fact , &quot; he added , &quot; there isn ' t a single detention center in the country with the elementary conditions required by our law. &quot; &quot; Prisons are a cursed thing , &quot; Czar Peter the Great said of Russia ' s 18th-Century forerunners of the Soviet gulag . Today ' s reformers have let_in Russian Orthodox priests to set_up chapels and sprinkle holy_water . Yeltsin ' s 1993 constitution proclaims that a person is innocent until proven guilty . But post-Soviet legal reform has barely touched the country ' s 164 pretrial prisons . The simplest of cases can drag_up to 18 months before trial and a year or more in court . The prosecutor or judge during that time may deny visitation rights to a suspect ' s lawyer or family . Few suspects go free before trial . The collapse of the omnipresent Soviet state has made judges reluctant to release prisoners to the custody of an employer or social_organization . A bail system exists , but capitalist ownership rights are not entrenched , so the use of private_property for bail is limited . As a result , pretrial prison populations are growing . By law , a cell must have at least three square_yards of space for each inmate ; by that measure , the limit for all 164 prisons is 165 # 000 inmates . As of March 1 , they held 240 # 657 . Sailor ' s Rest , with a limit of 3 # 050 , holds about 6 # 200 inmates , 2 # 000 more_than it did a year ago . The place has 510 officers and guards , and 140 other employees . &quot; This is not a hotel , &quot; said Nikolai S . Barinov , the director of Sailor ' s Rest , named for the street it once shared with a naval barracks . &quot; We cannot hang_out a no-vacancies sign. &quot; It ' s not a restaurant either . The standard meal is soup with a thick layer of grease . The average food budget_for each of Russia ' s prisoners is 40 cents a day , Kalinin said , but Russia ' s financial crunch cut it to about 30 cents a day last year . Prisoners at Sailor ' s Rest have gone four months without sugar . Part of the crowding problem is that many pretrial prisons were abolished in the late 1950s , after Soviet leader Nikita S . Khrushchev declared that a crimeless , classless society was at_hand . About two-thirds of the prisons remaining in Russia were built before 1900 . Last year , a wall collapsed at one in Siberia . Kalinin says 20 are so decrepit they must be torn_down . &quot; This was built as a prison in 1751 under Czarina Elizabeth , &quot; Col . Yevgeny G . Mityayev informs visitors to his dungeon in Tula , 125 miles south of Moscow . &quot; It hasn ' t changed much since. &quot; Here , too , the cells are dark and overcrowded , but the strongest impression is the putrid odor -- a blend of low-grade tobacco , urine , sweat and the grime of_ages . Prisoners get a shower once a week and fresh air one hour a day , in rooftop &quot; exercise &quot; cages just big enough to pace around in . There is one light_touch : Mityayev allows pet cats . As Russia grapples with organized_crime , the colonel struggles to guard , feed and care_for 2 # 100 criminal suspects , mostly the disorganized kind . Nikolai N . Nizhelsky , 32 , landed here after the drunken January evening when he encountered a stranger and helped him lock a pig in a shed . The pig , it turns_out , had been stolen . &quot; I didn ' t steal anything . I ' m not pleading guilty , &quot; Nizhelsky protested . But justice is slow , and he ' s suffering heartburn and a skin_rash he never had before , for which &quot; all they give me is herbs. &quot; Asked why Nizhelsky cannot go free on bail , the colonel said with a shrug , &quot; All he owns is a pair of trousers. &quot; If he were to plead guilty , Nizhelsky could move to Tula ' s labor colony , a short walk and a world away . There he might serve_up to five years , but at least he would get more sunlight through bigger windows and his own bed . He would walk from classroom to lunchroom to factory , assembling electric_heaters for a modest wage . He could even try_out for the prison rock_band . If he behaved , he could go_home for periodic 12-day vacations , as 33 prisoners have done this year . &quot; You don ' t see that terrible closed door all_the time , &quot; said Sergei V . Spiridonov , 26 , who spent eight months in the Tula dungeon before being sentenced for hooliganism to 3 1 / 2 years in the labor camp . All prison officials deny beating inmates . But Alexander A . Dmitrichenko , 16 , interviewed in a juvenile labor camp , said he and his cellmates were often clubbed at random by drunken guards in the Tula dungeon until his 1993 conviction for stealing food . Vil S . Mirzayanov , the dissident chemist who spent 27 days this year in Sailor ' s Rest , said he watched similar , pointless beatings . Kopylov , the businessman held_in the same prison , told of being clubbed for refusing to share a cell with dysentery patients . Such brutality is rarely prosecuted . But human_rights organizations say it is not as prevalent or intimidating as the density , decay and disease in every pretrial prison . Summer brings scabies , a skin_rash spread by parasitic mites . Tuberculosis , incurable in damp cells , infects and kills prisoners at many times the rate in Russia as_a_whole , says Natalia Vezhnina , a prison doctor in Siberia ' s Keremovo region . &quot; Every day I pray for bad_weather , because when it ' s too hot , epidemics and deaths are unavoidable , &quot; Col . Gennady N . Oreshkin , then director of Moscow ' s Butyrskaya pretrial prison , told the Moscow City_Council last year . &quot; When it ' s raining , water runs_down the walls and conducts electric_current because the wiring is totally rotten , &quot; he said . &quot; The sewage_system gets blocked_up every day . . . . An ambulance has to be called two or three times a day for heart patients. &quot; There is no relief in_sight . In February , the Parliament voted an amnesty that by autumn will free about 26 # 000 teen-age , elderly , female , ailing and white-collar criminal suspects . But by then , prison officials estimate , 60 # 000 new suspects will be behind bars -- the flotsam of Russia ' s rising crime_wave . The overload is a sudden challenge for a criminal justice system in flux , torn between its libertarian constitution and its Soviet instinct to diminish the individual . Issues familiar in the West are just emerging here : Prison directors fault judges and judges fault police for piling on too many cases . Everyone blames Parliament for not voting enough money to fight crime . Police want more jails . Reformers want swifter trials and easier conditions for pretrial release . Under enormous political pressure to catch criminals , police often forgo real investigation , beat prisoners into signing Soviet-style confessions , throw them in jail and hope the charges stick , according to judges and other officials . Nikolai K . Baranovsky , chief_justice of a Moscow district , said 10 % of his defendants claim that their confessions were physically coerced . Baranovsky has a staff of 12 judges , 47 other employees who work 10 hours a day , two broken computers , some ancient typewriters and a leaky courthouse roof . They cannot keep_up with a growing caseload of 150 jailed suspects . One case involving nine accused thieves has been in court since 1991 , delayed by periodic measles and scabies quarantines in their cells . &quot; They want the trials to be over fast , and so do we , but we cannot do anything unless the laws are changed &quot; to streamline trial procedures , the judge said . &quot; But the lawmakers don ' t seem to worry about this problem. &quot; Since its December election , Parliament has shown concern in two ways but so far has changed nothing . It voted_in April to launch a six-month study of pretrial prison conditions , which nobody doubts are horrendous . And it voted_down a bill to improve those conditions , on the grounds that the bill didn ' t do enough to guarantee prisoners ' rights . The bill is back in committee . Perhaps the most promising improvement so far is the gradual opening of the system to outside scrutiny . Kalinin , the national prison chief , cooperates with human_rights advocates . Letters from inmates denouncing abuses are read on radio and printed in newspapers , even if they are not acted_upon . But many who ran the Soviet gulag are still on_the_job -- &quot; jailers accustomed to total freedom from control by the outside , &quot; says Sergei V . Sirotkin , deputy chairman of Yeltsin ' s Human_Rights Commission . Alexander Karagodov , an ex-convict who wrote a prison memoir titled &quot; The Right Only to Die , &quot; believes that the men who have cracked five of his ribs since his release are Interior Ministry thugs who feel threatened by the book ' s reformist mission . &quot; It took seven decades to build this system , and it will take even longer to destroy it , because we will do_it not by terror and shooting but by democratic means , &quot; says the 35-year-old author , who spent nearly half of his life behind bars for vagrancy , robbery and trying to kill a prison_guard . For now , the immediate problem is keeping all those crowded prisons from exploding . Thousands of inmates in Yekaterinburg and Orenburg have staged hunger_strikes in recent months to protest harsh conditions , and Deputy Interior Minister Pyotr G . Mishchenkov warns that &quot; a tiny spark could turn a trivial conflict into an outbreak of rioting. &quot; At Moscow ' s Butyrskaya prison , Col . Oreshkin once resorted_to a desperate method to ease the pressure -- one that worked but eventually ended his law_enforcement career . Like other prisons , Butyrskaya buys_food on the open market with its cash allocations from the Interior Ministry . With tension rising last summer , the prison ran_out of cash , and the suppliers halted food deliveries . While urgently lobbying his superiors for more money , the colonel called_in five mafia bosses , all former prisoners , and appealed for help . &quot; When you were inside , the state was interested in keeping you alive so you could work , &quot; he recalls telling them . &quot; Now you see that the state simply doesn ' t give_a_damn about those whom it no longer needs . So please , have mercy . They are your people as well as mine. &quot; The next morning a truck pulled_up to the prison gate and unloaded 15 # 000 cans of corned_beef and 500 cans of condensed milk , along with wholesale quantities of cheese , soap and cigarettes -- enough to supply the 6 # 000 detainees for five days , free_of charge . Sergei L . Loiko , a reporter in The Times ' Moscow Bureau , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
