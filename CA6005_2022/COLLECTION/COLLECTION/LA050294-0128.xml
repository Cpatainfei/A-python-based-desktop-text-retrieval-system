   <HEADLINE> PERSONAL TRAGEDIES MOTIVATE SANTA CLARITA WOMAN ' S PUBLIC SAFETY CRUSADE ; ACTIVISM : THE DEATHS OF HER YOUNG SON AND A CLOSE FRIEND TRANSFORM DEBORAH LUCK FROM AN APOLITICAL RESIDENT INTO AN INVOLVED CITIZEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Five months ago , Deborah Luck was a graphic designer who didn ' t even know who sat on the Santa Clarita City_Council . But a string of personal tragedies since then has transformed her into one of the area ' s most visible community activists . The 37-year-old Canyon Country resident initially gained notoriety after the slaying of her friend , Veronica Estrada , 29 , in December . Estrada ' s body was found along a dark portion of Soledad Canyon Road near her home_in Canyon Country . She is believed to have been strangled . After Estrada ' s death , Luck circulated a petition that helped bring street lights to the area . But further tragedies soon followed . It turned_out that the man later arrested on suspicion of murdering Estrada was another close friend of Luck ' s , Stuart Edward Milburn . Then , on April 12 , Luck ' s 11-year-old son , Christopher Kipp Turner , was killed in Arizona by a suspected hit-and-run driver . &quot; God says He never gives a person more_than they can deal with , &quot; she said . &quot; I wish He didn ' t think I was so danged strong. &quot; Her son ' s death prompted Luck to launch another high-profile crusade . In the past few weeks , Luck has collected thousands of dollars for Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) and is campaigning in Arizona for tougher hit-and-run and drunk-driving laws . &quot; I know my boy ' s up there saying , ' You ' ve got_to do this , Mom , ' &quot; she said . Luck added that she will never be able to go_back to the relatively quiet life she led before the recent tragedies . &quot; You find when you start one thing you see a lot of inadequacies and you say , ' You know , someone ' s got_to take_care of them , ' &quot; she said . Yellow ribbons are still flying in Christopher ' s memory outside each house on Luck ' s street . Inside her house , the rooms are still filled with flowers and sympathy_cards from friends , public officials and strangers who read about her loss . The cards and flowers , though welcome , offer only so_much solace . The house is too full of memories of her son . &quot; I ' m just kind of wandering around the house aimlessly , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t know what to do. &quot; A similar restlessness pushed Luck_into action after Estrada was killed . A few days after the tragedy , Luck and others close to Estrada placed a large sign where her body was found . It asked passing motorists to report any information they had about the case to Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department officials , who at the time had no suspects . City officials made the group take_down the sign after several residents objected to having the scene of the crime so boldly marked . But by then , the sign had served its purpose , prompting a key witness to come_forward , said Sgt . Doral Riggs , a homicide investigator . Luck was shocked when Sheriff ' s Department officials soon arrested Milburn in connection with the crime . Estrada and Milburn were martial_arts instructors at a tae_kwon_do studio . Luck compared the news of Milburn ' s arrest to a second death in the family , but said she is reserving judgment about his innocence or guilt . Milburn , 27 , is in custody without bail at Men ' s Central Jail in Los Angeles awaiting trial on a murder_charge with three special circumstances . If convicted , he could receive the death_penalty . Before Luck began circulating petitions to urge the council to install street lights on Soledad Canyon Road -- an effort that would gather 3 # 500 signatures -- she was a political novice , at best . &quot; When I started working_on the lights I had no idea , I ' m ashamed to say , who anyone on the City_Council was , &quot; she admitted . But council_members and those vying for three open seats in the April 12 election had little trouble distinguishing Luck . She showed_up at one candidates forum with a large sign calling_for the street lights , prompting all 11 candidates to make at least a passing reference in support of the idea . Her son Christopher , a martial_arts student of Estrada ' s , scooted around the neighborhood on in-line skates gathering signatures for the petition . But he didn ' t get the chance to see his efforts pay_off . Christopher was killed instantly upon being hit by a Rolls-Royce Silver Spur while visiting his father in Scottsdale . The vehicle ' s owner , Edward Palenkas , 67 , a retired businessman , was arrested two days later , but police said they could not prove their suspicion that he had been drinking at the time of the accident . Hurt and outraged once more , Luck went_to the media about her son ' s death . Letters poured into the offices of Scottsdale police and prosecutors , including one from U . S . Rep . Howard ( Buck ) McKeon ( R-Santa Clarita ) , urging them to pursue the case vigorously . On April 21 , a Maricopa County grand_jury indicted Palenkas on felony charges of manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident . The charges carry a maximum penalty of 23 years in prison . Luck said she hopes to bring a local MADD chapter to the Santa Clarita Valley and will continue her fight in Arizona . And she is increasingly speaking out on other issues . &quot; Someone in Arizona said , ' The next time we see you , will it be Mayor Luck ? ' &quot; she said with a laugh . &quot; I said , ' I don ' t know , but in 1996 it could be Councilwoman Luck. ' &quot;</TEXT>
