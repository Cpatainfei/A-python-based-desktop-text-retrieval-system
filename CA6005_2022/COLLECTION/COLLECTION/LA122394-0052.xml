   <HEADLINE> INK : ROTATING EXECUTIVES STUN USA TODAY STAFF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Part of the Gannett Co. ' s corporate culture is to change executives unexpectedly at its 83 daily newspapers . So it was last Thursday when staffers at USA Today were summoned to a meeting and told Peter S . Prichard was resigning as editor of Gannett ' s flagship property and David Mazzarella had the job . The next day ' s weekend edition was Prichard ' s last ; Mazzarella ' s name topped the masthead on Monday . The staff was stunned . Prichard , 50 , who will become a senior_vice_president in the Freedom Forum ( formerly known as the Gannett Foundation ) and executive_director of a news museum the foundation is developing , spent six years as editor . He hardened news coverage at the multicolored daily , whose bite-size stories and dazzling weather_map originally earned USA Today the derisive nickname &quot; McPaper. &quot; In the 56-year-old Mazzarella , USA Today gets a veteran newsman and manager who says he intends to build_on the news strength and give the paper &quot; more relevance on national and international issues. &quot; Mazzarella spent several years as an Associated Press reporter and bureau chief in Europe and covered the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars before becoming editor of the Daily American in Rome . After returning to the United States in 1976 , he became foreign editor of the Gannett News Service and then editor of the chain ' s central New Jersey paper , the Courier-News . Mazzarella worked_on the prototype for USA Today , launched in 1982 , and in recent years has hopscotched the map as president of the paper ' s multifaceted international publishing division , a job he will continue to hold . &quot; I ' d like to see more enterprise in the paper , but I was not brought_in to turn the place topsy-turvy , &quot; he said . USA Today reportedly ended a decade of red ink by producing a small profit last year . However , the belief among the paper ' s reporters is that Mazzarella represents a drive toward greater profitability initiated by Gannett Chairman John Curley ( with whom Mazzarella started_out in the AP three decades ago ) and his brother , USA Today Publisher Thomas Curley . Mazzarella sidestepped a question about revenues , saying , &quot; Certainly my goal is to produce a newspaper that more and more people will want to read and advertise in because it ' s a good paper . Other things grow from the quality of a paper. &quot; * On the Racks : The Martha Stewart media juggernaut -- books , weekly TV_show and Martha Stewart Living magazine -- rolls on . Martha Stewart Living Weddings ( $ 5 ) , the first special-edition spinoff of her successful monthly magazine , will appear on newsstands for three months beginning Monday . It ' s a 272-page mag that offers tastefully Martha ideas on all things nuptial . The never-ending tour of Bob Dylan has produced more_than just the singer ' s arrangements of old songs . &quot; Drawn Blank &quot; ( Random House ) is the first published collection of Dylan ' s artwork -- &quot; sketches for paintings that either never were painted , have yet to be painted ( or more likely never will be painted ) , &quot; as he explains in a brief foreword , which is the only text in the $ 30 book except for the title on the cover . His untitled sketches show nudes , interiors and exteriors framed by what could be hotel windows .</TEXT>
