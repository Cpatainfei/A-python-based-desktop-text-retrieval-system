   <HEADLINE> OIL AND VINEGAR DRESSING -- HOLD THE OIL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> These days , the well-dressed salad is not just a bowl of super-fresh ingredients . Good salad_dressings are a must to enhance the delicate flavors of lettuce , vegetables and fruit . Yet trying to keep salads low in fat with homemade dressings is tricky -- a classic vinaigrette contains 10 grams of fat per tablespoon . Do bottled diet dressings become a way_of_life for year-round salad lovers ? Or is there a secret to keeping flavor in and fat out ? I ' ve found a number of successful substitutions for oil in homemade dressings . The key is to retain the proper balance of flavors . Too_much of any one ingredient -- sharp , tangy or smooth -- can throw the balance off . In most dressings , the traditional proportion is two parts oil to one part vinegar . I was able to replace up_to one-third the oil with defatted broth , a vegetable puree , vegetable juices , blended low-fat cheeses such_as ricotta or cottage_cheese , nonfat milk and even balsamic vinegar -- with no flavor loss . For example , a recipe that called_for 3 / 4 cup olive_oil would become 1 / 2 cup olive_oil and 1 / 4 cup broth , pureed ricotta , unsalted tomato or vegetable juice , or balsamic vinegar . Automatically , I ' ve cut the calories and fat by 30 % or more . * As I tried further reducing the proportion of oil to other ingredients , I noticed that flavors appeared sharper . Oil acts_as a flavor emulsifier , creating a harmonious blend to the taste buds . To keep the balance of flavors when substituting or reducing the oil , I had to reduce the amount of stronger-tasting ingredients such_as grated onion , garlic and cayenne_pepper ; they tasted much more powerful than in the original recipe . Another result of reducing the oil further was that the dressing was less able to adhere to and coat the lettuce -- the essential job of all dressings . A salad_dressing is not successful if it pools in the bottom of the bowl . So , to create creaminess , I added a small amount of low-fat plain yogurt or pureed roasted sweet_peppers . The bit of fat in the yogurt was much less than the original amount in the oil , and it helped the dressing bind together . The roasted and peeled sweet red_peppers , which are sold in jars in the supermarket , became a staple for my doctored dressings . The peppers lent a grilled or barbecued flavor , a light rose color and -- when pureed first -- a smooth silky texture reminiscent_of fat . Green_peppers worked well too , although they were not as sweet as red . I also discovered that using stronger-tasting oils gave me more flavor mileage . For example , dark or toasted sesame_oil can be used in smaller amounts than olive_oil , yet the pungent flavor makes the dressing taste richer . * The following salad is an example of how the potent flavor of dark sesame_oil can be used in a very small quantity to give a big effect .
