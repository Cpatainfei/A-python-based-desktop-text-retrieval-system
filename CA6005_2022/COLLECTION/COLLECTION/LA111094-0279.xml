   <HEADLINE> FEINSTEIN IS APPARENT WINNER IN SENATE_RACE ; POLITICS : EXPERTS SAY LEAD IS PROBABLY ENOUGH , EVEN WITH 500 # 000 UNCOUNTED BALLOTS . HUFFINGTON REFUSES TO CONCEDE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Democrat Dianne Feinstein was the apparent winner in California ' s topsy-turvy race for U.S. Senate Wednesday , but the outcome remained so close that Feinstein declined to claim victory and Republican challenger Mike Huffington refused to concede defeat . In a dramatic finish to the nation ' s most expensive congressional race in history , state election officials said they expect that the final outcome will not be known until early next week as county registrars tally at least 500 # 000 absentee_ballots that remained uncounted Wednesday . An analysis of the outstanding ballots indicated that it was all but impossible for Huffington to overcome the 123 # 610-vote margin that Feinstein won on Election_Day . With all_of the state ' s precincts reporting by 4 a.m. Wednesday , Feinstein was ahead 46.6 % to 45 % , marking just the third time in 60 years that a California senator has won with less than half of the vote . &quot; I am optimistic that we are going_to win this race , &quot; Feinstein said at a news_conference Wednesday morning in San Francisco , where she described a long and sleepless election night . &quot; I believe the lead is sufficient enough to win the race . . . . Having said that , I recognize there are absentee_ballots out there. &quot; One reason for Feinstein ' s confidence is that Los Angeles County was responsible_for a plurality of the outstanding absentee_ballots -- at least 170 # 000 . Feinstein carried Los Angeles County by more_than 11 % on Election_Day and by about 1 % among the absentee_ballots already counted in the area . Overall , Huffington won the absentee_ballots already counted statewide by about 6 % , according to an exit poll conducted in California ' s largest 15 counties by The Times . But to win , Huffington officials figured that they must carry the outstanding ballots by a margin of about 21 % . Feinstein ' s lead is &quot; a big difference to overcome , . . . there is no question about it , &quot; said Ken Khachigian , a Huffington adviser . Khachigian said officials were studying the last overtime election when Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren ' s 1990 victory was not declared until absentee_ballot counts were released more_than two weeks after the election . Despite the long odds , Huffington would not admit defeat Wednesday , saying in a written statement that &quot; it is impossible -- and completely irresponsible -- to declare a winner at this time. &quot; Leaving his Orange County hotel where supporters had gathered the previous night for an election party , Huffington said he still expected to win the race . &quot; I think we will be standing here together again and I ' ll be claiming victory , &quot; said the candidate , who added that he planned to spend time at Disneyland with his daughters . Huffington , a freshman congressman from Santa Barbara , said he did not expect a recount . Officials from the Republican campaign said they were not aware of any irregularities in the voting that would make them suspect the Election_Day total . &quot; I don ' t think we ' re going to need a recount , &quot; Huffington said . &quot; I think it will be clear when it ' s over. &quot; Even as the campaign went_into extra innings , strategists were giving their political prognosis of California ' s electorate . Without a doubt , experts said , it was a race that will become part of the state ' s political lore . The two Senate candidates combined to spend more_than $ 41 million on the race , shattering a 10-year record of $ 26 million set by North Carolina Sen . Jesse A . Helms and his opponent . Huffington , whose fortune comes from the 1990 sale of his family ' s Texas oil and gas_company , spent almost $ 30 million from his own pocket , nearly double the most ever spent by a non-presidential candidate . Feinstein was outspent more_than 2 to 1 overall and as much as 3 to 1 on television . In addition , her campaign faced a number of powerful obstacles . The senator bucked the anti-government , anti-Clinton hostility that swept Republicans into power in Congress ; she was_on the unpopular side of Proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigration initiative , and fellow Democrat Kathleen Brown was losing the race for governor so badly that she was damaging the party ' s other candidates . At her news_conference Wednesday , Feinstein said she also believed that her reelection was complicated by the national Republican tide , which she attributed at least partly to President Clinton ' s health_care plan that she had co-sponsored until May . &quot; I think one of the issues out there that led to this ( GOP victory ) was an overreach on health_care reform , where people saw the proposals that were made as just so sweeping , so broad , just too_much government , &quot; she said . Huffington , on the other hand , spent so_much of the campaign attacking Feinstein that polls indicated that he never made a strong connection with voters . In addition , his campaign was rocked by news_stories critical of his business background , his wife ' s unconventional religious history and , most recently , his admission that he employed an illegal immigrant nanny in violation of federal law . &quot; I certainly think it would not have been so close but for Proposition 187 , &quot; said a White_House official . &quot; Feinstein was hurt by that . . . . I also think that , had Huffington not had the nanny problem , he probably would have won. &quot; The Times exit survey of voters on Election_Day indicated that Huffington was helped by his support for Proposition 187 , but it was not a major factor . But political observers said that , like Gov . Pete Wilson , Huffington ' s campaign probably would have tried to capitalize on the initiative ' s popularity in the final weeks of the race had the candidate not been caught in the controversy about the illegal immigrant nanny . The poll , supervised by Times Poll Director John Brennan , indicated several demographic factors that kept the race close . Feinstein lost the race -- by 6 % -- among white voters , who accounted_for 81 % of the electorate . She carried all_of the state ' s major ethnic_groups , including 80 % of blacks and 67 % of Latinos . Women failed to turn_out in greater numbers than men -- as they do traditionally -- despite the presence of two women candidates at the top of the ballot . The survey also found that self-described conservative voters turned_out much more_than self-described liberals . Many of the voter opinions about the Senate candidates , however , were shaped by the heaviest barrage of TV commercials ever broadcast in a California political race . With few exceptions , both candidates used their television commercials to tell voters why they should not support their opponent . As a result , The Times exit survey found 57 % of Huffington ' s supporters saying they were voting for the &quot; lesser of two evils. &quot; On the other hand , perhaps because she was_better known before the race began , 61 % of Feinstein ' s voters said they cast their ballot because they liked the candidate . Regionally , Feinstein had a powerful showing in the north -- particularly in the Bay Area , where she served for nine years as a mayor and county supervisor in San Francisco . Her score in San Francisco -- 64 % -- was almost the same as in her 1992 race . In Los Angeles , she outpolled Huffington by about 11 % , considered by some experts to be the minimum necessary for a Democrat to win statewide . Feinstein lost almost every_other county in Southern California . Huffington also failed to generate the margins he needed from major Republicans areas , although he was close . For example , only one Republican in the last 12 years has won a statewide race in California with less than 60 % of the vote_in GOP-rich Orange County . Huffington got 59 % . Huffington also failed to carry his home county of Santa Barbara , the only Southern California county besides Los Angeles to side with Feinstein . Huffington has been a controversial figure in his hometown since he upset a veteran congressman in 1992 and announced his bid for the Senate just a_few months later . Republican pollster Arnold Steinberg said Huffington &quot; came_to the table with a lot of baggage . I think he had the right message for this year but . . . was the wrong messenger. &quot; Times staff writers Greg Krikorian and Richard C . Paddock and Times researcher Tracy Thomas contributed to this article .</TEXT>
