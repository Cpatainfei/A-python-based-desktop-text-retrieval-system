   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : MAKING A DIFFERENCE ; TOBACCO EDUCATION : CLEARING THE AIR IN ORANGE COUNTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every county in California coordinates education activities to help people quit smoking and to keep others from starting . In Orange County the overall smoking prevalence has dropped_by 6 % in the last two years , making its current 18 % rate the lowest in the state . The decline , public health experts say , resulted in part from outreach efforts by the county ' s Tobacco Use Prevention Program which works in partnership with community organizations , schools , businesses and a coalition of volunteers to develop approaches for reducing tobacco use . Funding for Orange County ' s program and others like it throughout the state comes from Proposition 99 revenue , the 25-cent tobacco tax initiative Californians overwhelmingly supported in 1988 . The initiative specifically outlined how much revenue tobacco education programs would receive , but these allocations have been reduced in the past . Groups like the Americans for Nonsmokers ' Rights and the American Lung Assn . argue such alterations are illegal . Others like the California Medical Assn . and state hospitals say more Prop 99 money should fund medical services for the poor . And lawmakers like Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg ( D-Sacramento ) say the issue is deciding how best to use shrinking tax monies . The Legislature has yet to determine how Prop . 99 funds will be allocated for the next fiscal_year . HOW A COUNTY KICKS THE HABIT Orange County currently has 46 different education programs developed in response to its residents ' tobacco use patterns . Here ' s a sample : YOUTH PREVENTION Issue : In Orange county about 70 % of 14-16 years olds say they can purchase cigarettes from convenience_stores even though selling tobacco to minors is illegal . Response : Teens Not Tobacco , a new program , trains teenagers to educate convenience_store vendors about state laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco to minors . More_than 30 teens have talked to more_than 60 convenience_store managers . POLICY DEVELOPMENT Issue : Nearly half of all employees in Orange county workplaces without smoking restrictions are exposed to smoke ; where tobacco use restrictions have been implemented only 12.5 % of the workforce is exposed to smoke . Response : Work Site Consulting assists businesses and schools to create smoke free environments . To date , more_than 300 Orange County companies have tightened their smoking regulations and 30 companies with 500 or more employees have gone smoke-free . CESSATION Issue : Only 36 % of Orange county smokers reported that they were advised to quit smoking during their most recent doctor ' s visit ; 43 % of Orange County smokers who were advised to stop smoking during their last visit to a health_care professional tried to quit . Response : Training more_than 500 county health_care professionals about how to help their patients stop smoking has brought information to more_than 40 # 000 smokers . COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT Issue : Smoking among Orange county ' s young , urban Hispanic children is increasing . Response : Community-based groups receive grants up_to $ 20 # 000 to develop outreach programs that promote tobacco-free lifestyles . Among them : St . Jeanne de Lestonnac Free Clinic ' s &quot; Neighborhood Free from Tobacco &quot; program in Santa Ana discourages teens from smoking by approaching their families in a bilingual , door-to-door information campaign about how to maintain a tobaccoless home and community . A Mandate Going Up In Smoke ? Proposition 99 passed_by a 58 % to 42 % margin and included fixed percentages describing how the tax money was to be distributed . Here ' s how spending was approved by the voters and where the money goes today : Proposition 99 proceeds 03 # 18 , 06 # 06 1988 1994 Health Education 20 % 13 % Medical Services 45 52 Research 5 5 Environment 5 5 Unallocated 25 25 TO GET INVOLVED For information about Orange county ' s tobacco education programs or how to stop smoking call ( 714 ) 514-1444 .
