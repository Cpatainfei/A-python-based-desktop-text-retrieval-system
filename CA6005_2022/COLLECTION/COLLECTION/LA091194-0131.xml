Redford bought the 40-by-330-foot lot , which is between his beachfront house and Simon ' s , so nobody would buy and build next door to him , sources say . &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; Redford ' s fourth film as a director ( he won an Oscar for his first efforts as a director in the 1980 movie &quot; Ordinary People &quot; ) , is_due to be released Friday .

Pulitzer Prize- and Tony-winning Simon , whose numerous plays and movies include &quot; The Odd Couple , &quot; &quot; The Sunshine Boys &quot; and &quot; Lost in Yonkers , &quot; took_back a loan of $ 1.3 million on the sale of his lot to Redford , according to public records .

The couple have three children and three grandchildren . They apparently separated while he was working to raise money for his nonprofit Sundance Institute , the independent filmmakers workshop in Park City , Utah , that gave_birth to the popular Sundance Film Festival . Redford has been reported as saying , &quot; Starting Sundance made me very happy . But my marriage ended , which was very sad . I spent so_much time behind the scenes raising money. &quot; Simon has owned his beachfront home , with five bedrooms in just under 5 # 000 square_feet , since 1987 , sources say . TOM ARNOLD , who appears in the Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis film &quot; True Lies , &quot; has leased a Mediterranean villa in Beverly Hills for a year at $ 20 # 000 a month , sources say . Arnold , 35 , has been separated from TV comedy queen Roseanne since she filed for divorce in April , changed her mind three days later , and filed again . He created and starred in the TV series &quot; Tom , &quot; which was canceled in May . The home he leased has five bedrooms and a guest house in about 9 # 000 square_feet , behind walls and_gates . The estate is_on a knoll , about an acre in size with a panoramic view of the Los Angeles Basin . Lionel Richie and Elton John are among the former lessees . Raymond Bekeris of John Bruce Nelson &amp; Associates represented Arnold in the lease . LOUIS J . HORVITZ , who will direct the Primetime Emmy Awards telecast on ABC today , has purchased a house in the Hollywood Hills for nearly $ 1.2 million , sources say .

They had a house in Austria , near Salzburg , &quot; but it was too_much for us to keep_up , having an apartment in New York and the one here. &quot; He sighed . &quot; After all , we are getting old. &quot; The Premingers , who celebrated their 60th wedding_anniversary in August , are both 83 . Even so , once they moved to their house in the Palisades , they missed the pool and gym at their condo building on Wilshire . &quot; So we are going_to build a pool , &quot; he said .
