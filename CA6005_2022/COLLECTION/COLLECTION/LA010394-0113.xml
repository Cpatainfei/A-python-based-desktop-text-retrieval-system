   <HEADLINE> USE OF FETUS EGGS FOR FERTILITY SPARKS FUROR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Another controversy over fertilization techniques erupted in Britain on Sunday amid reports that a method of producing test-tube_babies using eggs from aborted fetuses is_on the horizon . Researchers said the technique , which has sparked intense ethical debate , may be able to produce a human baby within three years if the_British Medical Assn. ' s ethics committee gives it the go-ahead as expected next month . The technique , pioneered by Dr. Roger Gosden at Edinburgh Medical_School , would retrieve eggs from aborted female fetuses , fertilize them and place them in women who are unable to conceive because of early menopause or illness . Gosden has had positive results in the procedure using laboratory mice and mouse fetuses . The latest developments in fertility come_after a 59-year-old woman gave_birth to twins in a London clinic after undergoing artificial fertilization in Rome . Many doctors and officials argued that women past menopause are unsuitable to become mothers because of the vast age difference between them and their offspring . Last week , a British fertility clinic was embroiled in another controversy over implanting a white_woman ' s egg into a black_woman , after reports that the woman and her husband , a man of mixed race , wanted to ensure the color of their child . In the latest case , the thought of creating infants from the eggs of mothers who have never been born has caused some controversy in the medical and political worlds . Member_of_Parliament David Alton , a Liberal Democrat , called the new treatment &quot; reminiscent_of grave-robbing. &quot; &quot; This consumerist approach to the creation of life , &quot; he said , &quot; puts it on a par with an American fast-food outlet. &quot; A report on the research in the Sunday Express newspaper also raised the specter of &quot; fetus farming , &quot; in which women would conceive babies , have abortions and sell their fetuses for cash . But Prof . Stuart Campbell , head of obstetrics at King ' s College Hospital in London , said , &quot; Non-medical moralists who sound_off don ' t see the desperation of infertile couples. &quot; The government ' s in-vitro fertility watchdog group , the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority , is studying the research . Gosden claims that experiments in mice show that eggs from fetuses can be successfully implanted into infertile animals . The researchers say that the ovaries of a human female fetus can have up_to 5 million eggs ; the number of eggs gradually diminishes after birth , and by the age of 50 most women have fewer than 1 # 000 , British news_reports said . At present , there is a shortage of women ' s eggs because there are so few donors , medical experts say . &quot; I am certain the technique can be transferred to humans , &quot; Gosden told the Sunday Express . &quot; With ethical permission , the first human baby using the procedure could be born within three years. &quot; Some observers said the technique raises legal questions , such_as what would happen if a woman decided she had a legal_right to her fetus ' s fertilized egg in another woman ' s body . &quot; We are creating some nightmare scenarios in the next century , &quot; psychiatrist Anthony Clare said . &quot; People will be growing up whose mothers were aborted fetuses . I ' d be very interested to know what the mothers intend to tell their children when they grow up. &quot; Said Kieran Conrey of the Catholic Media Office , &quot; Any interference in natural procreation is considered unwelcome by the church. &quot; But Bishop Hugh Montefiore , ex-chairman of the Church_of_England ' s Board of Social Responsibility , said , &quot; I can see nothing wrong in the new procedure . But there must be safeguards . Written consent of both parents of the fetus must be obtained. &quot; Most fertility doctors in Britain welcomed news of the treatment . &quot; It is tremendous news , &quot; said Dr. Peter Brinsden of Bourn Hall Clinic in Cambridge . And Dr. Stuart Horner , chairman of the medical association ' s ethics committee , declared , &quot; We have not found any major ethical objection. &quot;</TEXT>
