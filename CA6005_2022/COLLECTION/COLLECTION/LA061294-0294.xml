   <TEXT> Jack Noseworthy , wearing bulky black boots and a ripped green army jacket with sleeves hanging past his hands , storms after Lisa Dean Ryan inside the faded gold lobby of the Belasco Theatre in downtown Los Angeles . She looks_like a waif , with her dark hair chopped short and her belly bare under the peace flower emblazoned on her cutoff T-shirt . The two actors are shooting the new half-hour TV series &quot; Dead at 21 , &quot; MTV ' s first foray_into action-adventure that might best be described as grunge on the run . They are playing Ed and Maria , two tattered 20-year-olds who are framed for murder and must stay one step ahead of a mad-dog federal_agent while searching desperately for the doctor who implanted a computer chip_in Ed ' s skull when he was born as part of a 1970s government plot to create super-smart human_beings . Unfortunately for Ed , the patients -- or neuro-cybernauts , as they ' re called -- self-destruct when they reach adulthood at the age of 21 . All the head-banging action , shot on 16-millimeter film throughout Southern California , is played_out on screen like an extended music video -- with extreme hand-held camera movement , colorful lighting , fast cuts and strobe effects , backed by a constant stream of music that ranges from the Spin_Doctors to Enya to Smashing Pumpkins to Snoop Doggy Dogg . The series airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. Noseworthy grabs Ryan ' s arm and spins her around on her platform heels . &quot; I think we should help him , &quot; he says , referring to Maria ' s father . &quot; Ed , that man stole me from my mom when I was a baby . He told me she was dead when she was alive . Just so I could help him run his cons , &quot; she counters . &quot; I could have known her , Ed . I could have known my mom before she died. &quot; Circling the two actors is a camera operator , Harry Garvin , moving_into their faces and back_out , tilting the camera on his shoulders from side to side like a lolling ship at_sea . &quot; I don ' t know what to say , &quot; Noseworthy says . &quot; But I do know what it feels_like to lose a family , and if you ' ve got a chance to patch things up , I think you should take it. &quot; &quot; He ' s trouble , Ed , and he ' s gonna get us in trouble. &quot; Displaced from their parents . Distrusting authority . Dismissed by a society pitted against them . And adulthood spells death . In many ways , &quot; Dead at 21 &quot; is the ultimate teen-age paranoia come_to_life . And that ' s exactly how the producers hope to hook the nation ' s alienated youth . * But it ' s not the only way . Executives at MTV are exploring an increasing number of entertainment alternatives to capture the wandering eyeballs and imaginations of young viewers these days . The basic cable channel that made an indelible stamp on pop culture in the 1980s by playing wall-to-wall music videos and specials has slowly expanded into a full-service &quot; lifestyle network &quot; to maintain the legions of followers it created over the past decade . MTV is now running its first scripted drama series , &quot; Catwalk , &quot; chronicling the ups and downs of a struggling garage band . A real-life soap_opera , &quot; The Real_World , &quot; and a sketch comedy series , &quot; The State , &quot; are prepping new seasons . MTV ' s late-night talk_show , &quot; The Jon Stewart Show , &quot; has been so well received that Viacom , MTV ' s parent company , is trying to sell it into broadcast syndication to replace &quot; The Arsenio Hall Show. &quot; Then there ' s a game_show ( &quot; Trashed &quot; ) in which contestants compete to destroy each other ' s property . A sports magazine ( &quot; MTV Sports &quot; ) with radical footage of in-line skaters , surfers and mountain bikers . A news_program ( &quot; Week in Rock &quot; ) whose chief correspondent , Tabitha Soren , is_on a first-name basis with President Clinton . A concert series ( &quot; MTV Unplugged &quot; ) that has spawned platinum record_albums . A fashion show ( &quot; House of Style &quot; ) hosted by super-model Cindy Crawford . And did we mention &quot; Beavis and Butt-head , &quot; the two cretinous cartoon characters who -- heh-heh-heh -- are the scourge of parents and educators everywhere ? &quot; Our fans look_forward to seeing the new ideas we try , &quot; said Joe Davola , senior_vice_president of MTV Productions and MTV Development , who is now overseeing the development of MTV ' s first sitcom . &quot; They ' re fine if we fail ; they get upset if we don ' t try . We have to change . Our audience expects us to change . The world changes , so do we . Once we stop , that ' s when it ' s over for us . We have to keep reinventing ourselves. &quot; But at a price . These different forms of programming have drawn heavy criticism from the network ' s primary supplier -- the recording industry . The booming record labels produce music videos to promote and market their artists . To them , MTV is a big electronic billboard that has managed to retain the rare attention of a restless generation of young people . At least 80 % of MTV ' s daily schedule still revolves_around music videos , including the afternoon and much of prime_time , but that ' s not enough for record executives , who are tired_of being squeezed_out by late-night reruns of &quot; Speed Racer &quot; and shows like &quot; Lip_Service , &quot; a lip-sync talent contest . &quot; We feel_like we ' re at the mercy of MTV , &quot; said one senior record executive , &quot; and we don ' t want to be at the mercy of anybody . It ' s just as simple as that . We want another option. &quot; So four of the six major record companies that normally compete fiercely against one another in the $ 9-billion domestic recording industry have raised the white_flag to address the issue . Warner Music Group , Sony Software , EMI Music and PolyGram Holding , which own or distribute the majority of all music released in the world , formed a partnership with Ticketmaster Corp . earlier this year to launch their own music video channel by year ' s end . The record companies will continue to license videos to MTV -- the only programmer to pay_for music videos -- but they will most likely use their channel for exclusive premieres of big videos and to sell tapes , compact_discs and other merchandise . &quot; Clearly there are more music videos made than can go_on MTV , &quot; said Jordan Rost , vice_president of marketing for Warner Music Group . &quot; And when MTV puts_on a program that has content other_than music videos , it narrows the number of available slots for us . The music industry is not putting_out fewer releases because MTV decided to add more non-music video programming . Therefore , we know our product can fill the time a new channel can provide . &quot; Record companies are more interested in having a channel with a strong music focus , as opposed to a more general lifestyle focus for the young adult audience . We want to be the cable channel purely dedicated to music. &quot; * MTV professes not to be worried by the potential competition . &quot; You have to stay ahead of the curve . We have never stopped planning and experimenting , &quot; countered Judy McGrath , president and creative director of MTV , who sees programming explorations as an important part of MTV ' s unique identity in a marketplace suddenly humming with music video outlets . &quot; I firmly believe the competition for MTV is going_to come from some kid sitting at_home in his garage or behind his computer , who has really fresh ideas , and somebody decides to let him take a shot at it . &quot; I don ' t spend my time worrying about record companies getting_together to compete with us , &quot; she continued , &quot; because I really believe it ' s a creative battle . The goal is to create a music environment that ' s going_to be interesting to the audience and bring them in to watch more videos. &quot; MTV has expanded beyond music videos for numerous reasons -- beginning with ratings . TV watching is a habit , and channel executives believe they can recruit more loyal viewers by giving them something regular to tune_in to . Most of the shows produced by MTV get their viewers involved in a way that music videos don ' t -- acting_as a giant watering_hole for America ' s youth to gather , get information and generally just rock on . Original programming also helps make MTV the master of its own destiny , by reducing its reliance on the record industry to consistently supply quality videos . It makes the channel more visible in TV guides , where for a long_time MTV wasn ' t carried because there were no real programs to list . And perhaps most important , advertisers are paying a premium to place commercials in such heavily promoted shows as &quot; The Real_World &quot; and &quot; Beavis and Butt-head , &quot; because they know kids watch them more intensely than they do an endless montage of music videos . Jon Sherman , the fledgling writer of the &quot; Dead at 21 &quot; pilot , was 22 when the network helped him develop his ideas for the show in 1992 . He epitomizes the split take_on MTV . &quot; When I was growing_up , I didn ' t like MTV , &quot; he said . &quot; I wanted to listen to music and I didn ' t want to watch music . I became a fan when MTV started doing stuff that was programming oriented . A lot of my friends complained that MTV was becoming so lame , putting shows on instead of music videos . I said , ' that ' s why I ' m watching it. ' Different people enjoy different things. &quot; MTV launched in 1981 with 250 music videos . For a number of years , when there were few cable channels and music videos were a novelty and Michael Jackson was a thriller , MTV ' s ratings were competitive with other major cable networks . MTV was promoted as a beachhead for channel surfers . During commercials on other channels , people were encouraged to flip_over to catch a quick music video on MTV , the first real channel for the remote-control age . But while MTV ' s prestige soared , its ratings plummeted . They only started to show signs of recovery in the last two years , when the network really started pushing different forms of programming . For the first_quarter of this year , roughly 236 # 000 homes were watching MTV in the average quarter-hour throughout the day , with 354 # 000 tuning_in during prime_time . that ' s a low number compared to basic cable ' s top-rated network , Turner Network Television , with an average of 1.5 million homes watching last month during prime_time . But MTV ' s numbers are actually up 18 % from the first_quarter a year ago , according to network officials . &quot; One thing MTV found about programming music videos -- you ' re basically encouraging viewers to shut you off , &quot; said Erica Gruen , a senior_vice_president and cable buyer at the advertising_agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in New York . &quot; When you give them bits and pieces , you can ' t sustain their interest for a half-hour , an hour or more . That was their whole premise when they started : We ' re going to provide music-video bits . You can tune_in and tune out . But if you do that , you lose your viewership base , and advertisers aren ' t too happy with that. &quot; MTV ' s major divergence from music-video programming began in 1987 with the dance show &quot; Club MTV , &quot; the news_program &quot; Week in Rock &quot; and &quot; Remote_Control , &quot; a game_show testing college_students ' knowledge of music and TV trivia . &quot; When we first_stepped into this world of programming with video or music or pop culture references , we did_it with the interest of shaking_up the format , keeping it interesting , giving people something to talk_about and write_about , &quot; McGrath said . &quot; Music is about a lot of different topics -- fashion , love , money , sex -- why not make some programming that reflects contemporary culture the way music does ? &quot; Advertisers suddenly began taking interest because they could selectively place commercials in specific programs , rather than take their chances in a block of music videos . &quot; Not all advertisers are comfortable being in a music-video environment , &quot; Gruen said . &quot; As we all know , the content for some of the music videos has more sex and violence than other types of television , and portrays situations that some advertisers and viewers don ' t feel comfortable with and don ' t want to be seen in. &quot; * MTV executives say all their alternative programming serves one purpose : to encourage viewers to stick_around and watch music videos . &quot; Music videos are our bread_and_butter , &quot; McGrath said . She vows that they will never dip below 80 % of the channel ' s total programming . &quot; The viewers come_to us for music , &quot; McGrath said . &quot; I want to keep their faith . When they come there will be a video in a short time. &quot; Another advantage to producing its own shows is that MTV can establish a greater presence outside the cable-TV universe . Its shows feed into a marketing whirlwind that sweeps in wider audiences . MTV Productions , for example , is developing feature_films based on &quot; Beavis and Butt-head &quot; and &quot; Joe ' s Apartment , &quot; a short filler from MTV ' s promo department about a guy whose pad is infested with friendly cockroaches . And MTV has become a prominent launching_pad for non-music personalities . Comic Denis Leary ' s ranting-and-raving MTV promos led to a comedy album and a budding feature_film career . &quot; MTV Sports &quot; host Dan Cortese turned his gig into two starring roles in broadcast network series . Tabitha Soren is an NBC News correspondent specializing in pop culture . And MTV ' s production unit will continue to produce &quot; Jon Stewart &quot; for Paramount Television , which was recently bought by Viacom . &quot; Basically , MTV is like the to 60 network , &quot; Davola said . &quot; You get_on , you get high visibility , you get high recognition. &quot; And when those personalities go_on to bigger things , that notoriety rubs_off on MTV . Pauly Shore still hosts programs on MTV at_the_same_time he ' s starring in such movies for the Walt Disney Co . as &quot; Son in Law &quot; and the upcoming &quot; In the Army Now. &quot; &quot; MTV is about new talent and the next thing , whatever that thing may be , &quot; McGrath said . &quot; We ' re kind of like a farm_team for new ideas. &quot; So what ' s in the farm system right now ? Following_up_on the runaway success of &quot; Beavis and Butt-head &quot; on MTV will be the August premiere of &quot; The Brothers Grunt , &quot; created by Danny Antonucci ( &quot; Lupo the Butcher &quot; ) , about a clan of brothers who leave their monastery to search for their runaway brother . This fall will bring the premiere of two more cartoons : &quot; The Head , &quot; featuring the symbiotic relationship between a man and the alien in his head , and Sam Keith ' s homeless superhero &quot; Maxx. &quot; In addition , &quot; Aeon Flux , &quot; the espionage character from &quot; Liquid Television &quot; who wears a black leather G-string and massacres hundreds with her ray gun , will get her own series next summer . MTV just ordered a series called &quot; Sand Blaster , &quot; an elaborate sun-and-sand version of &quot; American Gladiators. &quot; And comedian Anthony Clark and the hip-hop group TLC are among several artists working_on their own short comedy films . &quot; We ' re developing these shorts to be prototypes for a half-hour ( sitcom ) , &quot; Davola said . &quot; We will put then in rotation this summer . If one hits , we ' ll put_on a pilot , and if we like that , we ' ll create a series. &quot; &quot; We have no control over when and where and how we get videos , &quot; McGrath said . &quot; Sometimes you go_through a real drought , when you ' re hoping for something new and interesting , or some big proven star the audience wants to see . So now we can rely_on our own creative juices to create programming and not just wait for the next Pink Floyd record. &quot; * &quot; It is not my perception that there ' s a shortage of good music videos , but rather a shortage of time to air those videos , &quot; responded Susan Solomon , president and CEO of SW Networks , a joint_venture between Sony Software and Warner Music Group to produce , create and distribute music programming to everything from digital cable radio to computer on-line services . &quot; It ' s much less expensive to help people produce better music videos than to engage in much more expensive long-form production . That strikes me as a little odd. &quot; The record companies are not the only ones that believe MTV is vulnerable to healthy competition . In anticipation of a 500-channel cable universe , the marketplace for music videos is suddenly spinning at high speed . On July 1 , the country ' s sixth-largest cable operator , Cablevision Systems , will begin feeding the Canadian music video network MuchMusic to its 3 million subscribers . Black Entertainment Television is planning a separate jazz network in October . The easy-listening MOR Music TV , now available in 10 million homes , is launching a second music video channel with home shopping . Videos are also prime fodder on the Nashville Network , Country_Music Television and the viewer-request channel , the Box . And there are 250 regional music video shows running_on local cable channels and VHF stations around the country . But a tough regulatory environment , with strict cable rate rollbacks recently issued by the Federal Communications Commission , is holding major new efforts at_bay for now . Just last week , the owner of RCA Records and Tele-Communications Inc. , the country ' s biggest cable operator , cited &quot; changing market conditions &quot; as the reason for scrapping a music-video network they had scheduled for launch later this year . Even the record companies seem stalled in their designs until they find another cable partner -- although they are now in discussions with TCI . &quot; There ' s no real distinct game_plan , &quot; said a source close to the proceedings . &quot; It ' s more like , ' Hey , we ' re going to do this . Let ' s put_together a game plan. ' But nothing has happened since then . It was announced for the end of the year , but I ' ll be shocked if it happens by then. &quot; As a result , the next major music video channel to rival MTV ' s influence in 59 million cable homes may come from . . . MTV . An aggressive game_plan is afoot at the parent MTV Networks , one that involves global expansion and a dramatic renaissance of MTV ' s sister station , VH-1 . Up until now , MTV has treated VH-1 something like what Beavis might call a red-headed stepchild . VH-1 began as Video Hits One in 1985 , four years after MTV , and loosely targeted baby_boomers , first with Lionel Richie and Rod Stewart videos and later with reruns of &quot; WKRP in Cincinnati. &quot; In the coming months , VH-1 plans to lop_off the baby_boomer generation -- they ' re too old now -- to &quot; create a greater music programming synergy &quot; between MTV and VH-1 . Current and breaking music videos will spill_over from MTV onto VH-1 in a cross-promotional strategy to let viewers know that both channels are out there , working hand in_hand to deliver a barrage of music . Ultimately , executives hope to synchronize programming to_the_point that , at any time of the day , either MTV or VH-1 will be playing music videos , and viewers will never for an instant be denied their MTV . &quot; We definitely feel_like there ' s growth potential for VH-1 that has not been optimized , &quot; said Andy Schuon , the former program director who helped KROQ-FM in Los Angeles become an instrumental force in shaping the alternative rock world . He was recently named senior_vice_president of music programming and program planning to spearhead the musical unification of MTV and VH-1 . &quot; Specifically , we have decided to make a concerted effort to properly synchronize the two channels better , to make them work together better , &quot; Schuon said . &quot; If we ' re going to stay true_to our core , we can ' t grow with our consumers like some products do . We ' d like to hand off our MTV viewers at some point to VH-1. &quot; MTV Networks does have eventual designs to spin_off several new channels featuring different music genres -- a plan announced years ago -- and to get_into merchandising everything from clothes to CDs . But until the cable universe opens_up to new ventures , MTV Networks seems to be exploiting the assets it has . At a time when new channels are being frozen_out , VH-1 has a solid 48.4 million subscribers , or 83 % of the country ' s cable_television homes . MTV currently targets viewers 12 to 34 , and beginning later this year , VH-1 will reach_out to viewers 25 to 44 , who are moving_out of that younger age range but grew_up on MTV . The MTV moniker has become a successful trademark and the envy of the TV industry , helping MTV achieve a global reach in 248 million homes_in 58 countries . VH-1 hopes to develop its own distinct personality and point_of_view , while providing programming to meet its audience ' s needs . &quot; We want to focus specifically on the universe of people MTV carved out , &quot; Schuon said . &quot; The group of people who are familiar_with music videos , who like music videos , who still use music to shape and define their lives , who need more music information and who want to know what ' s going_on in pop culture. &quot; * Ironically , MTV helped create the monstrous music industry that seems to have risen_up against it . A few years ago , album sales were in the dumps . Alternative rock received no air time on mainstream radio until Nirvana exploded on MTV , swinging the direction of modern music , and &quot; Yo ! MTV Raps , &quot; a daily block of rap videos , led a rap revolution . The now thriving music industry has resulted in more albums from a wider variety of new artists who are making a torrent of music videos . MTV receives 30 to 50 videos a week from the record labels -- produced at costs ranging from $ 25 # 000 for low-budget productions to $ 150 # 000 or more for expensive ones -- but can ' t make room for more_than 10 of them . &quot; The one constituency most forgotten about by MTV is the record company , &quot; said one music executive . &quot; To a great degree , MTV is calling all_the shots now . They have more people who want to be_on MTV than they want to put_on . In the old days , when MTV was starting_out , the record industry called the shots . When you leave someone out of your tent and don ' t serve their need , they will find an alternative. &quot; McGrath vehemently denies the scattered record industry comments that MTV has become a music video monopoly . &quot; If we had that attitude we would be out of business , &quot; she said . &quot; That is very offensive to me. &quot; To expose new music , MTV has specifically created music video shows like &quot; Alternative Nation &quot; and &quot; 120 Minutes &quot; for alternative music , &quot; Headbangers Ball &quot; for hard rock and &quot; The Grind &quot; for dance tunes . The other forms of programming MTV delves into usually showcase music , too -- from the steady tunes that score &quot; The Real_World &quot; and &quot; Dead at 21 &quot; to the campy music videos that Beavis and Butt-head provide a running commentary on ( &quot; This is cool , &quot; &quot; This sucks &quot; ) . &quot; We do try and do a good job to present ( the record companies ' ) music and create an environment for it , &quot; McGrath said . &quot; We struggle every day to play the new videos they give us , and to find a place to play them. &quot; The competition to get music videos played is exquisite . One music executive accused MTV of sequestering Schuon from people at the labels , who are always calling and pleading their cases to play new videos and break new groups . But Schuon said he feels the pressure , even though he has a staff that sits_down and talks with label representatives to hear their needs . &quot; I get mail , faxes , phone_calls . The pressure is intense , &quot; Schuon said . &quot; When I was at KROQ , the pressure was there , but the truth is we were an alternative radio_station , and more times than not the supply met the demand . At MTV , on the other hand , we choose to play music from rock to Top 40 , from alternative to progressive , from hip-hop to rap . We define our channel as a musically diverse one . &quot; By doing that , there ' s always more supply , and I mean good supply , than we can play . We can ' t make the hour any longer . We can squeeze in about 10 videos an hour on television , and that ' s about it . If you ' re not going_to limit your audience ( to one genre ) , you ' re going to be faced with a space problem . So you pick the best of what you can , and no one is going_to be happy all_the time. &quot; MTV takes credit for breaking such successful artists as Arrested Development , Pearl Jam , Stone Temple Pilots , Counting Crows and Snoop Doggy Dogg . MTV devised &quot; Buzz Bin , &quot; a graphic slapped on fringe music videos , to help gain some attention for them . &quot; We absolutely jump_on new music with diversity you won ' t find anywhere , and more quickly than we ever have , &quot; McGrath said . &quot; Whether it ' s Pantera , Soundgarden , the Brand New Heavies , whoever it is -- people saw them first on MTV before they heard them on the radio or could buy them in the record store. &quot; Not everyone agrees . &quot; Historically , MTV has followed rather than led in the breaking of acts , &quot; said a creative development executive at one of the record companies . &quot; They like to see themselves as a powerful force in exposing new music , and they are . On the other side of things , they don ' t play something until they ' re pretty darned convinced it ' s going_to be a hit and they won ' t be hung_out to dry. &quot; Record labels are now cozying up_to dozens of alternative music-video outlets springing_up around the country . &quot; Record labels love us , because MTV doesn ' t program much M anymore , &quot; said Paul Carchidi , the creator of &quot; Rage. &quot; Carchidi , an entertainment attorney , pays $ 1 # 750 for an hour of time every Friday night on Boston superstation WSBK-TV38 , and then he sells his own advertising . Two weeks ago , his show clobbered MTV in the local ratings . &quot; Rage &quot; has done live interviews with k.d. lang and the Red Hot Chili_Peppers , and has helped break such bands as Sweden ' s Whale , whose song &quot; Hobo Humpin ' Slobo Babe &quot; received a flurry of national radio and MTV airplay after it was introduced on &quot; Rage. &quot; Columbia Records credits &quot; Rage &quot; with the worldwide video premiere of the Chicago group Stabbing Westward -- leading to consumer demand and the opening spot for the current Depeche Mode tour -- six weeks before MTV played the group ' s video &quot; Normal &quot; on &quot; 120 Minutes. &quot; &quot; MTV has dropped the ball in terms of music , &quot; Carchidi said . &quot; They used to educate people about new music and break bands . They don ' t care anymore . They ' re looking_for the ratings point. &quot; * The record companies , according to sources , have discussed a hefty $ 100-million business plan to launch their new channel . &quot; They ' re doing_it for the same reason you find entertainment companies owning TV channels , or movie companies owning theater chains , &quot; explained Jeffrey Logsdon , an entertainment analyst for Seidler Amdec Securities . &quot; You have a greater control over your distribution destiny . You can help create demand by playing what you believe are popular_music videos , and that will help spur CD or cassette sales. &quot; &quot; If you look_at the record companies , they basically had real good years and the real question is : How do you maintain and increase the retail pie , and continue to further the interest in music ? &quot; said Solomon with SW Networks . Those kind of attitudes could lead to problems , observed Deborah Russell , music video editor for Billboard magazine : &quot; I ' m mystified how they will program the channel , when you have different labels competing for time . Who gets the heavy rotation ? It would seem they would be better_off each doing their own channel. &quot; MTV ' s Schuon said that if the record companies succeed in getting their channel off the ground , they will eventually face the same &quot; choose or lose &quot; dilemma MTV did . &quot; The truth is , if record companies feel disappointed in what they are getting_on MTV and want to start their own channel , they ' re going to have to put_on the best music possible to make_it a successful business , &quot; he said . &quot; If they ' re going to be true_to the core of their audience and not just use their channel as a marketing tool , they ' re going to have to consider playing artists that aren ' t their own , and artists who audiences wants to watch on TV -- whether or not it ' s their personal priority . that ' s where compromise comes_in . that ' s what you can ' t lose track of -- the audience. &quot;</TEXT>
