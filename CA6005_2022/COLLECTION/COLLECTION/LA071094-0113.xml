   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : QUARTERFINALS ; BAGGIO MAKES A LAST-MINUTE DECISION AGAIN ; ITALY : STAR FORWARD COMES THROUGH WITH A LATE GOAL FOR THE SECOND GAME IN A ROW . SPAIN IS THE VICTIM THIS TIME , 2-1 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The bedsheet flapped wildly through the afternoon mist , its black lettering framed by hundreds of bouncing bodies and answered prayers . &quot; Vola Roby Baggio , Vola. &quot; In Italian , vola means fly . In the dialect of the 1994 World Cup , Baggio means little miracle . For a second consecutive game , Roberto Baggio awoke in the final minutes to carry exhausted , cramped Italy to a better place Saturday . His game-winning goal , in the 88th minute , gave the Italians a 2-1 victory over Spain in the World Cup quarterfinals before 54 # 605 at Foxboro Stadium . After juking the goalkeeper , Baggio ' s perfect strike from six yards at a near impossible angle eluded a sliding defender and sent the diminutive , ponytailed hero into a somersault . And the crowd into a bleacher-rattling uproar . And Spain into the ground . &quot; A tragedy , &quot; forward Julio Salinas said . &quot; I cannot describe it to you , &quot; goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta said softly . &quot; It is just something you have to live through. &quot; The Italians somehow found the words . &quot; Everybody was criticizing us , everybody wanted us to bench Roberto Baggio , everybody was saying things about ( Coach Arrigo ) Sacchi , &quot; said Antonio Matarrese , president of the Italian Soccer Federation . &quot; But we are now at the peak of world soccer . . . . so there ! &quot; After winning only one of their three first-round games , the Italians are only one game from the final . They will compete in the semifinals Wednesday at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford , N.J. , against the winner of today ' s game between defending champion Germany and Bulgaria . If the opponent is Germany , the battle will be enormous and historic , matching teams with two of the top three all-time World Cup records . Which is fine with the Italians . They say they want the Germans to be tough . They want the temperature to be 90 degrees and their own hamstrings to ache . And they say they want to be either tied or trailing going_into the final minutes . . . because that is all they have known . Their only first-round victory , over Norway , came_on a goal by Dino Baggio ( no relation_to Roberto ) in the 69th minute with his team playing one man short . In the second round last week , Roberto Baggio , voted best player in the world in 1993 , scored in the final minute of regulation and again in overtime to give them a victory over Nigeria . And now this , this victory engineered by two of the few remaining Italians who in those final dehydrating moments could still walk normally . &quot; We started_out this tournament suffering , &quot; said Giuseppe Signori , who set_up Roberto Baggio ' s goal . &quot; I think we will suffer until the very end . I guess we just like it that way. &quot; The Spaniards , who have won only six of 23 meetings ( there have been eight ties ) between these old rivals , feel they have suffered enough . This is the second time in three months that something like this has happened to them . The professional team from Barcelona , featuring nine of these players , was whipped by AC Milan in the European Champions Cup game in May . By now , they say bitterly , it should be obvious the Italians are more blessed than good . Perhaps they were trying to tell them that in the final moments of this defeat , when an elbow by Italy ' s Mauro Tassotti caught Luis Enrique in the face and broke his nose . Enrique and Italian defender Alessandro Costacurta began shoving each other . Then Fernando Hierro jumped into Costacurta ' s face and began shouting and pointing . Soon it was Jorge Otero ' s turn_to bump Costacurta and scream . After 60 years of grudge matches , the sniping continues . &quot; We lost , but not because of the way we played , &quot; Salinas said . &quot; We lost because of bad_luck . We dominate Italy in the second_half , we control the game . But they get the one play. &quot; And the Spaniards blew their one play , five minutes before the game-winning goal , when Salinas found himself one on one with Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca five yards from the goal . Salinas hesitated for an instant , undecided whether to go left or right . It was all_the time Pagliuca needed . The goalkeeper charged , forcing Salinas to punch it straight and off Pagliuca ' s foot , the ball and Spain ' s chances bouncing harmlessly away . &quot; I will live with that for the rest of my life , &quot; Salinas said . Just as he and his teammates must live with what happened late in a game that they were dominating . After being outplayed in the first_half , falling_behind , 1-0 , on a 27-yard bullet shot by Dino Baggio in the 26th minute , the Spaniards toughened and tied the score in the 59th minute on a 17-yard shot from Jose Luis Caminero . Italy , which had three fewer days ' rest before this game , suddenly looked haggard . The Spaniards , who took only four shots in the first_half , only two from inside the penalty area , suddenly had three good shots in a span of three minutes . &quot; In the second_half we had command , &quot; Spanish Coach Javier Clemente said . &quot; The Italians only had one opportunity. &quot; But look what they did with it . Catching Spain with seven men on the attack -- Clemente is one coach who was not playing for penalty kicks -- Dino Baggio lofted a beautiful pass_across midfield . Signori , who started the game on the bench , picked the ball out of the air with his feet and turned that pass into another beautiful pass just before being tackled . That was the pass that Roberto Baggio found . The Spaniards claimed he was offside . But they also admitted he is awfully quick . Running from defender Abelardo Fernandez , Baggio found himself on the right side with only the goalkeeper in his way . Waiting until Zubizarreta had come_out to challenge , he swiftly dribbled past him , jumping over the goalkeeper ' s left leg and racing for the corner of the goal . Just before Fernandez could cover the net , Baggio shot , and Italians will spend the next four years talking_about it . &quot; The goalkeeper made the right choice to come_out , &quot; Baggio said . &quot; I had to wait to find the right spot. &quot; He found that spot , but it wasn ' t on a soccer field : It was in hundreds of thousands of Italian hearts . Two more games like this , and he will be there for good .</TEXT>
