   <TEXT> If the ski_jumpers do as well today in competition as they did Saturday in practice , spectators can expect records on the big hill . Norwegian star Espen Bredesen got things going_with an unofficial record leap of 447 feet 8 inches ( 136.5 meters ) off the 120-meter jump , then Jens Weissflog of Germany topped him , sailing 449-5 ( 137 meters ) . &quot; On this hill , I can jump 140 meters , &quot; Bredesen said . * The first fake ticket of the Games -- or at least the first that was recognized -- turned_up at the cross-country ski stadium . The ticketholder , a Swede , said he had bought the ticket from someone else , believing it to be genuine . The ticket was described as being of fairly good quality by Liv-Grete Orvik , ticket-sales manager at that venue . * For reasons not entirely clear , although it does involve a record of sorts , this bit of intelligence was_on Saturday ' s Olympic news network : &quot; The people of Gudbrandsdalen ( the area that makes_up the Olympic region ) are eating more goat_cheese than ever . The dairy Ostlandsmeieriet Gudbrandsdal has sold 5.7 tons of goat_cheese during January . &quot; This is an increase of almost two tons , compared to last January . There has also been a considerable increase of sour_cream and cream. &quot; MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
