   <HEADLINE> PERSONAL HEALTH ; CURING DOCTORS OF FIGHTING ON JOB</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Did you hear the one about the surgeon and the anesthesiologist who got_into a fistfight in the surgical suite while the patient awaited her gallbladder operation ? Unfortunately , this is not a joke . The bizarre spectacle made news recently when the two doctors reached an agreement with the Massachusetts State Board of Registration in Medicine , which fined them $ 10 # 000 each and put them on probation for five years . Peculiar as the case may seem , heated quarrels between doctors on_the_job are not unusual . And although most doctors stop short of duking it out , conflicts among health-care professionals are sometimes serious enough to interfere with patient care . Paul Gitlin , chief of the Massachusetts medical board that investigated the case , said the clash was classic , in that it involved a surgeon and an anesthesiologist . Individuals in those two specialties are well-known for their mutual antagonism , born of the intense pressure of shared responsibility for a patient ' s life under the knife and the traditionally different personality types of the two . Surgeons are typically personified as cowboy go-getters , anesthesiologists as cool , calm , fine-tuners . In recent years , conflict-resolution has become a component of medical_school training .</TEXT>
