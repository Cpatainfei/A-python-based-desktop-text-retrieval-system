   <HEADLINE> ADMINISTRATION ASSESSING HARD LESSONS OF SOMALIA ; MILITARY : CLINTON ABOUT TO APPROVE NEW LIST OF RULES DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE U.S. RISK IN FORAYS INTO PEACEKEEPING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the last U.S. troops leave Mogadishu today , the Clinton_Administration is still absorbing the hard lessons of its bitter experience in Somalia -- and still trying to persuade a skeptical Congress that the United States should play a major role in international peacekeeping . Despite the bloody nose he got_in Somalia , President Clinton has not abandoned the idea of sending U.S. troops to police trouble spots overseas . Instead , he is about to approve a new list of rules designed to make U.S. forays_into peacekeeping as low-risk as possible . &quot; Peacekeeping . . . is rooted in American interests , &quot; Clinton ' s national security adviser , Anthony Lake , said in an interview Thursday . The most important lesson of Somalia , said Lake , is not that the United States should refuse to intervene in foreign conflicts -- but that the Administration should set clear and achievable goals , state them clearly to Congress and the public and know how to get_out if things go_wrong . The new guidelines , contained in a document called &quot; Presidential Decision Directive 13 , &quot; are likely to face an early test as diplomats work toward a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina that could require as_many as 25 # 000 U.S. ground troops to serve as peacekeepers . How the Administration will act when it faces that moment in Bosnia still is uncertain . &quot; In Somalia , this Administration encountered a firestorm -- and it ' s still feeling burned , &quot; said Arnold Kanter , an undersecretary of state in the George_Bush Administration . But Lake and other officials said there is more public support for U.N. peacekeeping operations than many members of Congress realize . Inside the White_House , Lake has been talking up a University of Maryland poll that shows a surprisingly large 49 % supporting U.S. participation in most U.N. forces -- and another 42 % supporting it in cases where U.S. interests are directly involved . In Bosnia , Lake said , &quot; I think it would still require a real effort to convince many members of Congress but . . . I can sense a real openness to the arguments that was not there &quot; last year . William J . Durch , a strategist at Washington ' s Henry L . Stimson Center , a defense-oriented research organization , agreed . &quot; I don ' t know that ( Somalia ) soured us on peacekeeping as much as it sobered us , &quot; he said . Among Directive 13 ' s provisions : * U.S. troops will only participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations in cases where there is a serious threat or breach of international security . Even then , the deployment must serve U.S. national interests . And all warring factions must have signed a peace accord . * The troops must be part of a multinational force , with a deployment order that provides a clear view of what the objectives of the mission are , how long it will last and what criteria the Administration will use to decide when to bring its forces home . * U.S. peacekeeping troops normally will serve in jobs for which Americans have special qualifications -- providing air_power or operating high-tech radar and communications_equipment , for example -- rather than front-line ground patrols , which might be riskier . * Except for a_few limited circumstances , all U.S. forces will be under U.S. command -- not under the command of foreign generals or admirals . * The Administration will work now more closely with Congress on peacekeeping operations , notifying lawmakers before deploying U.S. troops in the first place and keeping key House and Senate committees up_to date on how the venture is going . The limits contained in the directive constitute a conspicuous retreat from the dream that the Administration had only a year ago for a permanent , U.N.-led multilateral rapid-reaction force to keep the peace and support &quot; nation-building &quot; in the post-Cold War world .</TEXT>
