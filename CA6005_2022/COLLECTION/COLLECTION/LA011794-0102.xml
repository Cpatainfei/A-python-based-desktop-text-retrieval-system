   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL SCREENINGS : FILMS BY CHEN KAIGE PART OF ' NEW CHINESE ' PROGRAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chen Kaige ' s superb &quot; Farewell My Concubine &quot; may well be the strongest contender for the best foreign film Oscar , but earlier he made , among others , two films that surprisingly are considerably more complex . They are his debut feature , &quot; Yellow Earth &quot; ( 1984 ) , which screens Tuesday at UCLA ' s Melnitz Theater , and &quot; King of the Children &quot; ( 1987 ) , screening Sunday at Melnitz . Both films , part of the &quot; New Chinese Cinema &quot; program , show the nothing-less-than-cosmic impact a newcomer has upon a remote mountain community . In the first , set_in 1939 in northern China , a soldier ( Wang Xueqi ) has been sent to a village to collect folk_songs ; the idea is that if he explains that they will be sung by the Eighth Army , it will be easier to recruit village youths to join up in the battle against the Japanese invaders . What he does not reckon with is how his reports of the improving status of women in the big cities will affect a 13-year-old girl ( Xue Bai ) eager to free herself from an impending marriage arranged in her infancy . Both &quot; Yellow Earth &quot; and &quot; King of the Children &quot; take_place largely in single primitive locales , set against dramatic backdrops of immense mountain_ranges and vast skies , yet the films possess an epic scope much like &quot; Farewell My Concubine , &quot; which spans half a century and covers a sizable portion of China itself . that ' s because they are subtle , understated journeys into the heart , soul and mind of their people . ( Note : Zhang Yimou , now a director every bit as important as Chen , served as &quot; Yellow Earth &quot; cameraman. ) &quot; King of the Children &quot; is enormously complex in its implications . Set during the Cultural Revolution , it tells of a young intellectual ( Xie Yuan ) who ' s been undergoing &quot; re-education &quot; as a member of a unit that ' s been ordered to work as peasants . Out of the blue he receives an order to become a teacher to a large class of children who look_to be from 10 to 12 years old . He is appalled to discover that there ' s only one textbook for the entire class and that all that is expected of him is for him to write it out on a blackboard for the children to copy . He takes it upon himself , in a conscientious , patient fashion , to attempt to teach them to read and to write -- and in doing so , not only how to think but also to think for themselves . Obviously , the teacher is embarking_on a dangerous course , but &quot; King of Children , &quot; although a warm , earthy film , is not in the least predictable or conventional . It instead evolves into a speculation on the possibilities and limitations of teaching and learning and the roles in which nature and fantasy play in those processes . Although this film has been dissected at length as a philosophical treatise , it is nevertheless brisk , engaging , often as funny as it is sad , and finally affirmative in that no matter what happens to the teacher himself , he has transformed the lives of his students . The 94-minute &quot; Yellow Earth &quot; will be preceded by Wu Wenguang ' s 165-minute &quot; My Time in the Red Guards &quot; ( 1993 ) , which screens at 7:30 p.m. and which was unavailable for preview . It is a collection of interviews with intellectuals who , in their youth , had participated in Mao Tse-tung ' s political_movement . &quot; King of the Children &quot; is preceded by Huang Jianxin ' s &quot; Black Cannon Incident &quot; ( 1985 ) , which screens at 7 p.m. ( it was shown once at UCLA in January , 1987 ) . This prize-winning dynamic and controversial film , which ran_into complicated censorship problems , takes its title from a missing chess_piece referred to by a Chinese translator in a cable to an East_German engineer . Structured like a top-flight Hollywood political thriller , it is one of the most accessible and compelling contemporary Chinese pictures . Information : ( 310 ) 206-FILM .</TEXT>
