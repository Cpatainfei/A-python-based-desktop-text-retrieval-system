   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : NORTH HOLLYWOOD ; FIRM DELIVERS ELECTRIC_CARS FOR POLICE USE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Green Motorworks , based in North Hollywood , delivered the first four of six electric_cars it developed for use by Alhambra police this week . The vehicles will be used in parking enforcement . And William Meurer , founder of Green Motorworks , hopes they will demonstrate how effective electric_cars can be and how much energy they can save . Meurer , who started the company three years ago , believes it was the first electric_car dealership in Southern California . &quot; I wanted to do something to improve the environment , &quot; he said . Toward that end , Meurer got help from Calstart , a public-private consortium trying to convert defense technologies into electric vehicle uses . He also got some federal funding so he could install new higher-performance batteries in three of the cars . One of the cars ordered by Alhambra has an on-board computer to keep track of how much time the car is in_use , but not moving . Unlike gas-powered vehicles , electric_cars do not idle when they are at_rest and so save energy , he said . Meurer , who has sold more_than 30 of the Kewet electric_cars , believes that parking enforcement programs are ideal for proving the value of that feature . Initially , Green Motorworks converted gas-powered vehicles to electric . Last year , the company also started importing Kewets from Denmark . The cars ride_on special tires hand-made in Luxembourg that are meant to minimize rolling resistance , Meurer said . Kewets are smaller than standard compact_cars and cost about $ 14 # 000 , said Meurer . They have a range of 35 to 45 miles on a single charge and reach a top speed of about 45 m.p.h. For what Kewets are capable of , &quot; they ' re expensive , &quot; Meurer said . The cars are replacing the city of Alhambra ' s gas-powered Cushman three-wheel vehicles . Meurer predicts the electric_cars will have a life span of between 100 # 000 and 150 # 000 miles . &quot; Just remember to change the brushes in the motor at 80 # 000 miles , &quot; he said . Currently , electric_cars are mostly for hobbyists , said Meurer . But he said he is looking_forward to a day when mass-produced , affordable electric_cars are available . ED BOND</TEXT>
