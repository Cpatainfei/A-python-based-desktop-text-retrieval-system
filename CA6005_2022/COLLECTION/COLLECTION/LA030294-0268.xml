   <HEADLINE> THE FALL COLLECTIONS / MILAN ; OF YOUTH , SPARKLE , FAUX FUR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dressing the modern schoolgirl in cropped jackets , skinny pants , short full_skirts and jumper dresses , Giorgio Armani ' s Emporio Armani collection gave a much needed jolt Monday to the Italian fall ready-to-wear shows , which have sputtered along here since Sunday . Emporio is the Italian master ' s young line -- his signature collection will be shown tonight -- and it was very young , but pleasingly so . Jumper dresses and baby-dolls came_in demure florals , woolen knits and , for evening , in velvet with sequin tanks underneath , or in splotchy tweeds pieced together with smooth silks . Short , strong-shouldered jackets , in velveteen with frog closures , were worn over slim pants . Often these jackets were worn with longer vests for an eccentric , layered effect . Short jackets alternated with longer , slope-shouldered designs , worn with tight vests and fluid trousers . Tiers of ruffles were a recurring &quot; girlie &quot; theme . Iridescent leathers added the season ' s all-important shine . Dolce &amp; Gabbana ' s collection , shown Sunday , had the hot design duo doing what they do best -- masculine pantsuits offset by saucy starlet attire . With Isabella Rossellini on the runway , the collection had a maximum of verve and a minimum of gimmicks . Boucle miniskirt suits with tight little jackets trimmed in what looked_like faux fur were as sexy as could be . At Dolce &amp; Gabbana , Lurex turtlenecks and sequined tops sparkled under sedate menswear-ish suits . A cropped tank in fuzzy mohair topped a floor-sweeping sheer slip . A longhaired shearling coat was deliciously mangy . The designing boys ( Domenico and Stefano ) managed interesting mixes of materials -- mohair and chiffon , faux leopard and tweed -- and such accessible novelties as sweater sleeves sewn onto tweed jackets . Those forward-thinking fashion victims out there who have been wondering what they ' ll wear to the opening of &quot; The Flintstones &quot; movie need look no further than Gianni Versace ' s Versus secondary line . Overseen by the designer ' s spitfire sister Donatella , Versus took a twisted take_on couture styles , dishing_up lunch-lady clothes in mixed animal prints to the strains of Nancy Sinatra ' s &quot; These Boots Are Made_for Walking. &quot; It was jaw-droppingly over-the-top , what with spotted jackets worn with leather jumpers , striped velveteen jackets over zebra pants , men in leopard pants , faux-fur change purses dangling off belts , doughnut-shaped pillbox hats . Versace ' s other secondary line , Istante , made the season ' s biggest case for shine -- whether the shimmer of metal or the gloss of patent . But it wasn ' t anything we haven ' t already seen from American designer Anna Sui . There were pastel metallics , a_couple_of beautiful long lame and Lurex pleated dresses , and a red crinkled patent mini-dress . Glen plaid suits were studded in rhinestones and worn over Lurex turtlenecks . The Missoni show was truly no biggie . Everything looked_like ikat cloth , a Gustav Klimt painting or some ancient tapestry or other . Only the company ' s signature ombre leggings will turn heads ( for the right reasons ) on the street next fall . The Byblos show began with hooded Lurex knits and sporty iridescent jackets . What looked best were a satin three-piece pants suit , a cut velvet suit , a cropped glen plaid swing jacket over tan velveteen pants , and gunmetal lame quilted jackets worn with Lurex knits .</TEXT>
