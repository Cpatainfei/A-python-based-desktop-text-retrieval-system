   <TEXT> Here are some sources of information on converting your garden into a back-yard wildlife habitat : * Send for the National Wildlife Federation ' s packet on the Backyard Wildlife Habitat program . The packet contains an application_form , a booklet on planning and planting a habitat , and the paperback &quot; The Backyard Naturalist , &quot; describing the experiences of the manager of the program in creating a habitat . Send a check for $ 5.25 ( includes postage and handling ) to the National Wildlife Federation , 1400 16th St. , N.W. , Washington , D.C. , 20036-2266 , or call its toll-free number , ( 800 ) 432-6564 , to order . * &quot; Your Backyard Wildlife Garden , &quot; by Marcus Schneck ( Rodale Press , 1992 , $ 25 ) , is an excellent introduction to the subject . It explains how to look_at your yard from the viewpoint of an animal , contains many useful charts ( such_as lists of plants to attract hummingbirds and specific butterflies and birds ) , lots of photos for inspiration , fun ideas ( such_as creating a toad house ) and a great pictorial glossary in the back with all_the common wild creatures likely to be attracted to a typical back yard . Even the kids will enjoy referring to the glossary . * Another good basic book is &quot; Attracting Backyard Wildlife , &quot; by Bill Merilees ( Voyageur Press , 1989 , $ 10.95 ) , available in most libraries . * Back-yard habitats from the standpoint of design are featured in &quot; Landscaping With Nature , &quot; by Jeff Cox ( Rodale Press , 1991 , $ 27 ) . The author explains in detail how to simulate nature in our own back yards and proves that doing so is not only more compatible with wildlife but also can be more aesthetically pleasing . * &quot; The Natural Habitat Garden , &quot; by Ken Druse ( Clarkson Potter , $ 40 ) due out_in March . This third book by writer-photographer Druse on the naturalistic garden will emphasize the benefits of native plant gardening and include instructions for firescaping . * Sea &amp; Sage , the local chapter of the Audubon Society , can help you learn what kinds of birds you can expect to attract . Call ( 714 ) 261-7963 for information . * &quot; Butterflies of Greater Los Angeles &quot; is an illustrated guide to the 106 species in the area . Order from Theodore Payne Foundation , ( 818 ) 768-1802 . About $ 8 . * Fullerton Arboretum propagates many native plant species for its weekend plant sales . Call ( 714 ) 773-3579 for more information . Tree of Life Nursery in San Clemente is another good local source of native plants . ( 714 ) 728-0685 . * For inspiration , visit some gardens that are already good habitats . Hortense Miller ' s in Laguna Beach is a good one . Call the city of Laguna Beach at ( 714 ) 494-0716 to make reservations for a tour . For ideas on how to incorporate native plants into the landscaping , visit the Home Demonstration Garden at the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden , ( 805 ) 682-0988 ; the Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Garden , ( 909 ) 625-8767 in Claremont , or the Theodore Payne Foundation , ( 818 ) 768-1802 in Sun Valley .
