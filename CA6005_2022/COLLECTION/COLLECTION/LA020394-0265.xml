   <HEADLINE> KIDS ON FILM : HILARIOUS ACE TRACKS LAUGHS AS BLUNDERING ' PET DETECTIVE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective , &quot; TV comic Jim Carrey plays a goofball investigator who tackles the theft of a famous dolphin -- the mascot of the Miami football_team -- and in the process sends up other famous movie moments , including the surprise from &quot; The Crying Game. &quot; ( Rated PG-13. ) * Jim Carrey is funny . Head lowered , neck out , eyes full of childlike enthusiasm , his whole face quivers and stretches into places no human_face has ventured before . In this movie , kids -- especially those familiar_with Carrey ' s Fire_Marshal Bill character from &quot; In Living Color &quot; -- loved him hands_down . The film itself , however , earned mixed reviews . &quot; There ' s nothing much to the plot ; it ' s not involved or anything , &quot; said Tod McGill , 13 . &quot; It was a little corny , ( but ) it was funny enough to make_it good . It was funny because ( Carrey ) was always overacting . For his first movie , he did really well. &quot; Like &quot; Wayne ' s World &quot; without the wit , this movie celebrates adolescent boys ' humor : slapstick , bathroom jokes and raunch . Mostly , it seemed to attract and delight boys 12 to 14 , who laughed straight through from the beginning credits , when Carrey in a delivery-man disguise manhandles a box marked &quot; fragile , &quot; to the ending credits , when he picks a fistfight with another football mascot , a parrot . One group of boys , pumped up by TV trailers and the celebration of a friend ' s birthday ( &quot; the Big One-Three &quot; ) , couldn ' t praise &quot; Ace Ventura &quot; enough . Asked to rank it on a scale of 1 to 5 , they variously awarded the movie a 5 , a 6 , a 7 1 / 2 and a 99 . &quot; There ' s laugh after laugh , &quot; said birthday guy Chris Defarkas , sounding suspiciously like a plant from the publicity department . &quot; There isn ' t a slow moment. &quot; His friends all waved two thumbs in the air ; some mimicked Fire_Marshal Bill , while others hoped for a sequel . &quot; I ' m there , &quot; said Shane Ellis , 14 . But teen-age boys weren ' t the only ones who liked the teen-age boy humor , as Jon Hugstad , 14 , pointed_out . &quot; I had an older gentleman sitting next to me . He was laughing just as hard. &quot; Shane said his favorite part was one that made some_other kids uncomfortable -- a scene in which a woman ' s true sexual identity is discovered by a telltale bulge in her skivvies . &quot; I was dying ! &quot; he said . &quot; I watched ' The Crying Game , ' and I got that part . And the music just added_to it . It was ' Crying Game ' music. &quot; Tiffany Thair , 11 , was also dying , but for another reason . &quot; It was just kind of sick , &quot; she said . Mike Wile , 13 , said he also saw the R-rated &quot; The Crying Game &quot; and thought it , too , was_sick . &quot; After that I had dinner , and I didn ' t even feel good_enough to eat , &quot; he said . Another group of boys gave the movie lower marks -- a 4 , a 3 and a 2 . &quot; I thought it was funny , but it had no plot , &quot; said Evan Kennedy , 12 . As I recall , and none too easily , the story line follows the laughingstock pet detective Ventura as he traces a tiny gemstone found in the empty dolphin tank to the rings awarded in a past Super Bowl game . He tracks_down every team member ( while jogging , in the shower , mailing a letter , at a fancy cocktail_party ) to check_out their rings , before he finally narrows_down the list of suspects . &quot; The plot kept changing , &quot; said Elliott Rushovich , 13 . &quot; They kept making_it more funny so you would n ' t really care if you didn ' t understand it , because it was so funny. &quot; Like me , they agreed Carrey can be hilarious . I was amazed by his on-target imitation of a football_player in slow_motion and then in reverse . But a little goes a very long way . &quot; If they had a sequel , that would be overdoing it , &quot; Tod said . &quot; It would be too_much of a funny thing. &quot;</TEXT>
