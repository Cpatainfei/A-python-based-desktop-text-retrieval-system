   <HEADLINE> BODY WATCH ; GET_WELL SOON ; WHAT YOU KNOW BEFORE SURGERY CAN HASTEN RECOVERY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Before the Big Day The better prepared you are for surgery , the more quickly and completely you will recover . It is important to learn all you can about the procedure and prepare yourself , your home , your family and your employer for it . Here are some tips . * The better your physical condition before surgery , the quicker you ' ll recover . &quot; Go_into your surgery well-nourished , &quot; says Kathy Carder , a registered nurse who works with critical-care patients at Santa Monica Hospital . &quot; Protein is necessary for the antibodies and cells that fight infection . Calories , vitamins and minerals are also very important . Before and after surgery is not the time to diet. &quot; Carder also suggests that patients who smoke try to stop at least two weeks before surgery . * &quot; Bathrooms can be dangerous for all but the most physically fit patients , &quot; says Dr. Hilary Siebens , assistant medical director for the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center . &quot; Remove all throw_rugs , and find_out if you ' ll need a stool in the tub or shower . Consider moving your bedroom to the first_floor during recovery , &quot; she says . &quot; Find_out if you ' ll need help with self-care while recuperating. &quot; * Siebens suggests that patients and families discuss how their roles will change after surgery . Delegating who will manage finances , household chores and children should be discussed before surgery . &quot; Families also need to consider what will happen if full recovery is not possible or your surgery uncovers a more serious problem or terminal illness , &quot; Siebens says . * Let your employer know how much time you anticipate being gone . Tie_up loose_ends and find_out who will take_over your work duties . Arrange for your wages to be picked_up or deposited directly to your bank_account . Ask how much your insurance_company will cover of your procedure and post-operative care , especially if special help or equipment becomes necessary during recovery . * Find_out if you will need a blood_transfusion . Ask what your options are . * Find_out what your post-surgical medications will be and see if you can purchase them ahead of time . * Stock up_on groceries , toiletries , pet_food , stationery and stamps . Get enough to last six weeks . * Cook extra food and freeze meal-size portions . * Have lists of household instructions posted for any helpers coming_to your home . * Arrange transportation for incoming helpers and post-operative trips to the doctor . * Alert your postal carrier if you ' ll be confined to the house . Ask if he or she will pick_up outgoing mail . * Take_care of banking and bills ahead of time or arrange to do_it by telephone . * Get some of those back-burner projects that you ' ve been waiting to do organized and ready to tackle . * Purchase reading materials . After It ' s Over Ever wonder why patients who have just been through surgery are forced to sit_up , stand_up or walk as early as the day after surgery ? Although exercise of any kind in the few days after surgery may feel_like torture , &quot; Movement is extremely important after surgery , &quot; Santa Monica Hospital ' s Carder says . &quot; Early walking is most effective in preventing skin breakdown , blood_clots , pneumonia and constipation. &quot; Movement is so important that patients who cannot walk are generally turned side to side by a nurse . &quot; While bed rest is very important , the body loses muscle strength , flexibility and cardiopulmonary stamina , which is reversible through exercise , &quot; Siebens of Cedars-Sinai says . Once you are at_home , alternate periods of rest and activity , and don ' t worry if you ' re sleeping more , Carder says . &quot; Tissues heal faster during sleep , &quot; she says . &quot; Some days you may feel great ; others , worse. &quot; Carder warns that pain can prevent necessary deep breathing , movement and sleep . &quot; Don ' t be afraid to ask_for sufficient pain medication , &quot; she says . &quot; Drug_addiction almost never happens because of surgery and you must move. &quot; Attitude plays a big part in the recovery process . &quot; For some patients , coping_with recovery is straightforward ; others deal with many mood swings , &quot; Siebens says . &quot; Find someone to talk to about your feelings . If depression persists , seek some help. &quot; More ways to a speedy recovery include : * Psyche yourself up and remember the big picture . * Learn what signs of infection look_like . * Know the side_effects of your medicines . * Have telephone_numbers handy for medical personnel who can answer your questions . A good number to have is that of the nurses station of the hospital floor you stayed_on . Someone who may be familiar_with your case is there 24 hours . * Keep post-operative instructions handy for you and anyone assisting you . * Watch your fatigue level . * If you ' re walking with crutches or a cane , use a carpenter ' s apron with many pockets to help carry things . A patient using a walker can attach a basket . * Stick_to your doctor ' s recommendations regarding exercise . Overdoing it can hurt you . * Encourage non-stressful visitors . Talk to people who will make you laugh . When someone asks what they can do to help , tell them . * If family or friends are running errands , ask to go_along for the ride . * Tackle a_few projects you ' ve been putting_off . Organize a photo album , start a journal , catch_up on correspondence or computer work . * Splurge on books , magazines and crossword_puzzles . * Order in a pedicure . * Indulge in a soap_opera . * Learn a new card_game . * Do a jigsaw_puzzle . * Get some fresh air daily . * Set daily goals -- but within reason . Visualize yourself doing something that recovery is keeping you from now and work toward that goal . Best Advice From the Doctors There ' s no doubt that recovery from any surgery can be a challenge . The doctors we spoke_to overwhelmingly said that the best route to recovery is good planning and understanding of the proposed surgery . Here ' s what else they suggest . Dr. Kim Bader , OB-GYN ; Glendale : As a practicing obstetrician-gynecologist , I work exclusively with women . Surgeries are diverse -- from Cesarean_sections to hysterectomies to infertility surgeries . The preparations for each are as different as the outcomes . What few women consider before their surgery is how their role at_home will change during the recovery period . If you are the primary caregiver , cook and bottle washer , your role is about to change drastically . With any surgery , you will need some sort of help in the early days of recovery . Plan for it . If you are coming_home with a brand-new baby , not only will you need assistance , but you should consider how your family dynamic will change . Dr. Michael B . Van Scoy-Mosher , oncologist ; Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center : One of the best steps toward a healthy recovery is to focus_on the long-term benefits of the procedure . Find a surgeon who is not only knowledgeable and skilled , but has your best interest at heart . Make_sure he or she will spend sufficient time explaining your procedure , and don ' t be shy about seeking second opinions . Remember that the human_body rebels against surgery and will send strong messages of its displeasure . Remarkably , the body does know how to heal itself , and in time normal life can be resumed . Marc Schoen , Ph.D. , psychologist ; UCLA School_of_Medicine : How you prepare mentally before and after your surgery will profoundly affect your recovery . Some important points to consider are : * Control . Establish a sense of control before and after your surgery by becoming a part of the decision process . Ask questions about the procedure , anesthesia and recovery period . * Relaxation . Stress interferes with our immune_system ; therefore healing is enhanced when the body is in a relaxed state . Useful tools before and after surgery include self-hypnosis , meditation and prayer . * Suggestion . Studies show that hypnotic suggestions given while under anesthesia have helped to shorten hospital stays and lessen the need for pain medications . Patients can listen to tape-recorded suggestions prior to surgery and in the recovery_room . * Support . It is comforting and reassuring to know there is someone we can rely_on following surgery . Have someone available who will not only be helpful after surgery but will be an advocate for your health . Dr. Michael J . Patzakis , professor and chairman , USC School_of_Medicine , Department of Orthopedic Surgery : Maximizing functional independence following orthopedic surgery is essential . I suggest patients ask the following questions : * Will I need crutches , cane , wheelchair or other devices ? * Will I need a cast or splint , and for how long ? * Will I need physical_therapy or an exercise program ? * Will I have to keep certain limbs elevated ? * How do I avoid complications ? * What functional level can I expect after surgery ? * What is the length of my convalescence ? Patients who are immobile should plan ways to occupy their time . If you will not have assistance once you reach home , ask your doctor to arrange appropriate care . Dr. P.K. Shah , director of In-Patient Cardiology , Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center ; professor of medicine , UCLA School_of_Medicine : After uncomplicated heart_surgery , many patients are ready to return to work in eight to 10 weeks . The success of that recovery depends_on a heart-healthy diet , exercise and a positive outlook . At home , patients are encouraged to continue their prescribed exercise therapy and progressively increase the duration and number of sessions a day throughout the next four to six weeks . Patients are also encouraged to begin a casual walking routine , progressively increasing speed and duration . Once patients return to work , they should continue to participate in an organized exercise program that offers instruction on modifying heart_disease risk factors . Dr. Lee S . Berk , psychoneuroimmunologist at Loma Linda School_of_Medicine and School of Public Health : Laughter may truly be the best medicine . It is well-known that any of the hormones we produce when we are distressed stifle the immune_system , but good stress or what is known as eustress ( pronounced U-stress ) can work in our favor . Eustress can come from the exhilaration we feel after exercise , when we experience good anticipation or from laughter . In a recent study , we found that blood samples from medical_students watching humorous videos showed measurable physiological changes in endorphins , which act_as the body ' s own painkiller . These hormonal changes can aid in overcoming classical stress . By making yourself feel good , physiology is affected by psychology . Patients recovering from surgeries should find something each day to look_forward too . Try to keep your spirits light and relate to people you enjoy . Diversions such_as humorous books , funny movies , enjoyable music or other entertaining activities will aid your recovery . How to Be a Great Visitor It ' s nice to show how much you care , but visiting a patient at the hospital or at_home comes_with some guidelines too . Paul Mignano , registered nurse and manager of the Medical-ICU Coronary_Care_Unit at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena , offers these suggestions for visitors : * Find_out the hospital ' s policies for the unit you ' re visiting . * Don ' t overstay . Twenty minutes is long enough to give your best wishes unless the patient asks you to stay longer . Remember they are there to recover , not to entertain . * Unless you are asked to stay and help , leave the room when medical personnel are there to work with the patient . * Ask about the patient ' s restrictions before bringing flowers or food to the hospital . * Don ' t use the in-room telephone or bathroom . * Wash your hands before and after your visit , and observe all rules regarding contamination . Patients usually feel better once they are home , but visitors should remember that they are still recuperating , says Elo Tanielian , director of Home Health and Hospice for St . Joseph Medical_Center in Burbank . She offers this advice for home visits : * Schedule your visit -- don ' t just pop_in . * Keep your visit upbeat and short . Focus_on how well the patient is doing , not how far they have to go . * Let the patient direct the conversation . Be a good listener . * Don ' t play the &quot; I can top your symptoms &quot; game or concentrate_on your own troubles . * Ask if you can bring a meal or special food you can share together . Take_care of the cleanup . * Anticipate needs . Ask if you can bring_in the mail , pick_up grocery items , run an errand or help the patient accomplish a task at the home .</TEXT>
