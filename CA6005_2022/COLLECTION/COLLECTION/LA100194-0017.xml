   <HEADLINE> ARABS EASE BOYCOTT LINKED TO ISRAEL ; MIDEAST : SAUDI_ARABIA , FIVE OTHER NATIONS AGREE TO END CURBS AGAINST FIRMS DEALING WITH JEWISH STATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Saudi_Arabia and the other oil-rich Persian_Gulf monarchies agreed Friday to end their boycott of companies doing business with Israel , declaring that the blacklist is no longer needed because of Israel ' s peace agreements with Jordan and the Palestinians . Foreign ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council announced the step -- which removes a serious irritant from U.S.-Arab relations -- after a lunch_meeting with Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . With Prince Saud al Faisal , the Saudi foreign_minister , at his side , Christopher said , &quot; There is a commitment from the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council to no longer enforce the secondary and tertiary aspects of the boycott and not discriminate against American companies . &quot; These are very significant moves ahead , &quot; he added . A senior U.S. official said later that the step is far more important symbolically than it is economically because few Arab states have enforced the boycott in recent years . However , Friday ' s announcement was the first time that a significant group of Arab countries made the non-enforcement policy official and public . The U.S. official said the announcement should reassure firms that &quot; err on the side of caution &quot; that they can do business on both sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict . He said companies such_as Motorola , which have long been_on the Arab blacklist , should now be able to compete for business in the Gulf countries without any impediments . Several years ago , Arab governments offered to lift the boycott in exchange for a moratorium on Israeli construction of Jewish settlements in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . But the GCC action came despite continued Israeli settlement activity . A senior Gulf diplomat said the boycott had been intended to pressure Israel to make_peace with the Palestine Liberation Organization . When PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White_House lawn a year ago , the primary reason for the boycott was pared away , he said . &quot; You can ' t be more royalist than the king , &quot; the diplomat said . &quot; Whatever the Palestinians can live with , we can live with. &quot; Moreover , the diplomat said the boycott could make_it more difficult for U.S. firms to do business with the newly established Palestinian self-governing authority in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho because the Israeli and Palestinian economies are so closely intertwined . Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , here to attend the General_Assembly session , said the Arab decision , though incomplete and slow in coming , is still important . &quot; It is a step_in the dismantling of the walls of hatred , &quot; he said . The decision affects only the members of the GCC -- Saudi_Arabia , Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . The boycott was imposed by the Arab League and only that organization can officially end it . However , the league allows member states to ignore the boycott if they deem that to be in their national interest , creating the loophole that the GCC used to end enforcement . The GCC countries are the richest_in the Arab world and account_for a large percentage of all business dealings between Arab states and the rest of the world . As the GCC diplomat said wryly , &quot; American companies are not doing great business with Djibouti and Libya. &quot; The GCC ministers said they will urge the Arab League to repeal the secondary and tertiary aspects of the boycott as soon as possible . The secondary boycott bars Arab governments from doing business with companies that do business with Israel , while the tertiary boycott bars Arab governments from doing business with companies that do business with companies doing business with Israel . The primary boycott , banning direct dealing between Arab states and Israel , remains . The GCC diplomat hinted that the primary boycott will be lifted after Israel and Syria reach a peace settlement . The diplomat said the GCC action may strengthen Rabin ' s hand in his negotiations with Syria because it will show the Israeli public that peace brings a tangible payoff . Syria is demanding the return of the Golan Heights , occupied by Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war , as part of any peace settlement . Rabin has indicated that he is ready to exchange some land for peace , although he says he will not return all_of the strategic plateau that overlooks both northern Israel and most of Syria . But Rabin is facing strong opposition within Israel to any sort of territorial concession . The U.S. official said Israel and Syria have narrowed their differences as a result of negotiations conducted by U.S. mediators , but he said the two countries remain far from agreement on a peace_treaty . Christopher plans to visit the Middle_East during the first_half of October to continue his shuttle diplomacy between Rabin and Syrian President Hafez Assad . Apart from any impact the boycott decision may have_on the Israel-Syria talks , the most significant psychological effect may be in the United States , where the boycott has long been a corrosive factor_in U.S.-Arab relations .</TEXT>
