   <HEADLINE> U.S. EXPANDS TRADE RELATIONS WITH BEIJING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ignoring a new controversy over human_rights violations in China and unresolved questions about trade practices there , the Clinton_Administration agreed Monday to expand trade and investment talks . Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown , escorting 24 executives of some of the United States ' largest corporations on a six-day visit to China , signed an agreement in Beijing intended to boost U.S.-Chinese cooperation in such key economic areas as telecommunications , chemicals , electric_power , aviation , electronics , airport infrastructure and automotive machinery . The accord also provides_for talks aimed at establishing an improved long-term commercial relationship . The agreement , which Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi signed for the Chinese government , would also facilitate the exchange of information and expertise on legal matters and management training . But even as the officials were expanding the scope of U.S. ties with China , Brown was given a dressing-down by his counterpart Wu , who demanded concessions for China ' s multibillion-dollar textile industry and U.S. help in bringing China into the world trading system . Despite China ' s criticism of the United States , the Administration has made a great effort to keep relations with China on an even keel . It has limited any criticism of human_rights violations to private meetings , and in a business-as-usual approach , has sought to boost U.S. commercial contact with China , one of the most powerful emerging markets in the world . &quot; Nothing is going_to get_in the way of trade . Foreign policy has moved_over to the Commerce_Department , &quot; said Orville Schell , a China scholar and author of several volumes on developments in China . &quot; The Chinese have triumphed . They ' ve won everything they want . They can have the secretary_of_commerce come_over and then they stick a finger in his eye. &quot; Unless President Clinton sets the Administration ' s policy on China on an unambiguous course , which would make clear whether it will oppose human_rights violations and exact a price for them , Schell said , Clinton ' s &quot; various minions don ' t know what to do except keep selling. &quot; Asked about China ' s human_rights violations and the Brown mission , White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said : &quot; The President made clear that he would continue to take steps to pursue improvement of those human_rights while also pursuing an economic relationship , which we think will help open that country to the West and to information that will help move them forward. &quot; She spoke_to reporters in Martha ' s Vineyard , Mass. , where Clinton is spending his summer vacation . The most recent human_rights problems surfaced as Brown arrived in Beijing on Saturday , on the highest-level official U.S. visit to China since Clinton renewed China ' s sought-after most-favored-nation trade status in May , which effectively separated human_rights concerns from trade issues . In a new crackdown on dissidents , authorities placed a number of people under surveillance and detained for 12 hours Wang Dan , a leader of the 1989 democracy protest in Tian An Men Square . While such detentions are often timed to prevent private meetings between senior Western officials and dissidents , they also serve as public reminders of China ' s willingness to embarrass high-level visitors by silencing the government ' s critics . On the trade front , Wu presented Brown with two demands , Reuters reported in Beijing . Wu told the commerce_secretary that China would abandon previous trade commitments if it is blocked from joining the new_World Trade Organization . The United States has said that China is not ready to join the trade group and must first provide greater protection of intellectual property_rights , bring_down barriers to international trade and make its trade regulations clearer to foreign companies and countries . Wu also said China would &quot; take some counter-retaliatory strike &quot; unless the United States eases its restrictions on Chinese textile sales by the end of September . The textile dispute stems from an agreement reached in January . It was intended to crack_down on China ' s practice of circumventing quotas on its shipments to the United States by using third countries to mask their Chinese origin . With $ 25 billion in Chinese projects at stake in coming years , according to Brown , his mission this week is to line_up as much work as possible for U.S. companies . Administration officials argue that successful commercial ties between the United States and China will bring the sort of economic progress in China that would lead to greater democracy -- and help bring_down China ' s $ 23-billion trade surplus with the United States . &quot; We are not ideological or philosophical about this . We are relentlessly pragmatic , bottom-line oriented , &quot; Brown said . Corporate_executives who accompanied Brown included officials of Chrysler , Sprint , Tandem computers , Westinghouse and Pitney Bowes . The executives said they expected to sign deals while in China . On Monday , Westinghouse signed a $ 140-million contract to provide equipment for the Jiangsu Ligang Electric_Power Co. , and Pitney Bowes signed a $ 20-million agreement to automate post_offices in China .</TEXT>
