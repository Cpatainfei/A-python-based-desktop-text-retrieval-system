   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; SMALL-TOWN AMERICANA IS DEALT A CRIPPLING BLOW ; FILLMORE : MERCHANTS SAY THE COST OF STARTING OVER IN THE QUAKE-DAMAGED DOWNTOWN MAY BE TOO GREAT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They have been the backbone of Fillmore for decades . Passing their shops from father to son , they have kept their main_street alive . Together they ' ve preserved a slice of small-town Americana so pleasant movie crews flock there to recapture an era lost to tract homes and shopping_malls . But now , with their grit tested to the limit , some business owners on downtown Fillmore ' s Central Avenue say they don ' t know if they can ever recoup what they lost two weeks ago . No city in Ventura County was more devastated by the Jan . 17 earthquake than Fillmore , a town of 13 # 000 residents founded in 1888 on a railroad_line from Saugus to Ventura . The worst of the city ' s estimated $ 250 million in damage was_on Central Avenue , the heart of the downtown business_district . Officials of this small oil-and-farm town say the city -- destroyed by fire in 1903 , swamped by flood_in 1928 , rocked by at least three strong quakes this century -- has the pluck to bounce_back . But for now Fillmore is a town in mourning . &quot; It ' s like losing family , &quot; said gun shop owner Gary Creagle . &quot; People are already coming_up_to me and saying : ' We miss downtown . What are we going_to do without downtown ? ' &quot; Buffeted day-to-day by engineering reports that are ever gloomier , shopkeepers who spoke confidently of reconstruction a week ago are now wondering if they can afford $ 200 # 000 to $ 300 # 000 to rebuild . Owners of a half-dozen buildings with 14 shops -- nearly all built of brick and mortar between 1910 and 1925 -- say they ' ll tear_down their structures and not rebuild . They say they ' re too old to start over . Many of Central Avenue ' s 55 merchants say they don ' t know where they will end_up in the months to come . Nearly half of their shops are red-tagged as being too dangerous to enter . Most of the rest are marked unsafe . &quot; People are finding_out it ' s too expensive to rebuild . So it ' s like : ' Mark us red . We ' re outta here , ' &quot; said Janet Foy , whose flower shop has little damage . But even as merchants mourned their losses and pondered reconstructions that do not pencil out , they said they love their small_town and don ' t want to go anywhere else . They like the fact that they graduated from the same high_school as their grandfathers , that their moms jerked sodas at Clough ' s drugstore and that the all-male Fillmore Club is reputed to have met for cards and meals at a second-story Central Avenue walk-up the second Monday of every month since World_War I . As search-and-rescue crews entered cracked buildings to retrieve valuables last week , some merchants showed a resiliency that they say will bring Fillmore through its current trial . But the losses they face tear at the heart and soul of the town . Locals_call the 77-year-old Fillmore Theater , at the precise center of the town ' s central business_district , &quot; The Show. &quot; As the only movie_theater along the 50 miles between Ventura and Santa Clarita , it lured customers from miles around . But now a key wall has collapsed . Demolition is expected . And many residents say they regret the theater ' s passing . But the owner of the Fillmore Theater building , Dale Larson , is 76 years old and not in a position to think_about starting over . &quot; Right now I ' m just planning on demolishing the building and having the plot for sale. &quot; Late Friday , hope emerged that The Show might avoid demolition after all . City_Manager Roy Payne said state preservationists insist the theater is not beyond repair and have presented calculations that suggest reconstruction might be feasible . What finally happens to the Fillmore Theater and other badly damaged Central Avenue businesses may depend_on disaster aid . U.S. Small Business Administration representatives are in town doling out application_forms , but no loans so far . &quot; Everybody ' s getting more confused and frustrated as we go_along , &quot; said Ron Stewart , 44 , whose grandfather started Ballard Furniture 57 years ago . Stewart bought the building from his mother four years ago . His sister ' s manicure shop is one of his three tenants . Stewart figures it would cost him perhaps $ 250 # 000 to rebuild , &quot; so financially I would be better_off to just tear it down and start over , &quot; he said . Of course , he said , he couldn ' t afford the mortgage on the reconstruction loan . Weighing heavily on Stewart , and on store owners close to the Fillmore Theater , however , is the question of what will happen to their businesses if the theater comes_down . Many of the Central Avenue stores have common walls , as was the practice 80 years ago . The strength of one store relies_on its next-door neighbor , as have the merchants themselves . But when one building falls , the others are threatened in a domino effect , several merchants said . Garner ' s plumbing and hardware_stores share a wall with Stewart ' s building . And Garner shares a wall with The Show . &quot; The theater has dominoed me , &quot; Garner said . &quot; I ' m yellow tagged now . They ' re letting me get all my stuff out of my store before they tag it red. &quot; The same fate could befall Ben Aparicio , 44 , whose building also abuts the movie_house . After building a tax preparation business to 3 # 000 clients , Aparicio said he and a relative bought his 1918 storefront four years ago for $ 250 # 000 . They invested another $ 50 # 000 in improvements last year . &quot; We all chose Fillmore because of the uniqueness of its architecture and its small-town feel , &quot; he said . &quot; But if any improvement through demolition or repair will bring this building_up to code , then I ' m for it . It needs to be done. &quot; Tenants along Central Avenue tend to agree .</TEXT>
