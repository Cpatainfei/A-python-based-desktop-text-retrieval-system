   <HEADLINE> FAMALARO EXTRADITION EFFORT BEGINS ; COURTS : JUDGE SIGNS PAPERS AND FORWARDS THEM TO GOV . WILSON ' S OFFICE . HE IS EXPECTED TO TAKE ACTION NEXT WEEK IN EFFORT TO BRING HUBER SLAYING SUSPECT TO TRIAL IN CALIFORNIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson ' s office received extradition papers Friday that would force Arizona murder_suspect John J . Famalaro to return to California for trial in one of Orange County ' s most notorious missing person cases . Newport Beach Municipal Judge Margaret R . Anderson confirmed Friday that on Wednesday she signed papers that would move the former Lake Forest house_painter from the Prescott , Ariz. , jail where he has been held since last month . Famalaro was arrested after Arizona authorities found the body of Denise Huber , a Newport Beach waitress , inside a freezer in the driveway of his country_club home . &quot; This should get things rolling , &quot; Anderson said Friday . The extradition documents were shipped Thursday to the governor ' s office . Wilson spokesman Kevin Herglotz confirmed Friday that the governor ' s legal staff has begun reviewing them . &quot; If everything is in_order , the governor is expected to take action next week , &quot; Herglotz said . &quot; He will process it just as soon as possible. &quot; Orange County Assistant Dist . Atty . John Conley said the extradition papers detail evidence linking Famalaro to the crime and supporting his office ' s extradition request . The items include a photograph of the suspect , fingerprints , laboratory test results , a brief summary of the case and other evidence , Conley said . Famalaro , 37 , is accused of kidnaping and murdering Huber , then 23 , in 1991 and carting around her nude , handcuffed body in a running freezer . The suspect refused to waive extradition after his arrest last month in Arizona ' s Yavapai County . A hearing there is set for Aug . 29 . Famalaro ' s defense_attorneys in Orange County and Arizona could not be reached for comment Friday . Huber , a UC Irvine graduate , vanished June 3 , 1991 , after her car had a blowout on the Corona del Mar Freeway as she headed_home from a rock_concert . Her parents and local police launched a nationwide search for her . But Huber ' s whereabouts remained a mystery until Arizona law_enforcement officers found her frozen body locked_in the back of a stolen rental truck parked in the driveway of Famalaro ' s Prescott Country_Club home . Huber died from nearly a dozen blows to the head ; results of an autopsy and forensic tests may reveal whether she had been sexually assaulted . Authorities believe Huber was abducted and taken_to a Laguna Hills storage facility where Famalaro was living at the time . Authorities believe she was murdered there and possibly kept_in an upright freezer before Famalaro purchased a chest-high freezer just a_few days after her disappearance . Conley said he does not expect the extradition request to speed_up the hearing scheduled for later this month . Conley noted that the documents must still be forwarded to Arizona Gov . Fife Symington , a process that could take several days . &quot; Don ' t forget this could all end tomorrow if he just waives extradition , &quot; Conley said . &quot; We ' re just being prepared for everything. &quot; The prosecutor said that although his office is moving as quickly as possible , his case will not suffer if it takes longer than expected to bring Famalaro back to Orange County . &quot; Ideally , if everything goes smoothly , it could take a month , &quot; Conley said . &quot; But it ' s not a problem at all if it goes as much as three months. &quot; A Yavapai County Sheriff ' s Department spokeswoman , Laurie Berra , said Friday that the orders issued in Orange County were required in preparation for the extradition hearing later this month . &quot; We have no doubt he is going_back there , &quot; Berra said . &quot; I would n ' t be surprised if he dropped the challenge before the hearing . It ' s pretty much known that he and his attorneys needed to buy a little more time to get things organized . &quot; that ' s all_right because he ' s been upstairs ( in the Yavapai County Jail ) just hanging_out and being very quiet. &quot;</TEXT>
