   <TEXT> Praising President Leonid D . Kuchma as a post-Soviet Franklin D . Roosevelt , President Clinton on Tuesday promised to add $ 200 million to the U.S. aid program for Ukraine to help pay_for the dismantling of the world ' s third-largest nuclear arsenal and to prop_up the nation ' s sagging economy . If approved by the incoming Republican-dominated Congress , the additional money will increase total U.S. aid to Ukraine to about $ 900 million over two years , placing the France-sized country fourth on the list of aid recipients , behind Israel , Egypt and Russia . &quot; We think it is so important to complete the work of denuclearization , ( and ) we think your long-term economic development , your commitment to democracy and to an open economy is so important that we want to be there over the long_run , &quot; Clinton told Kuchma during a joint news_conference . While Clinton and Kuchma were meeting in the White_House , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin won assurances on Capitol_Hill that the new Congress will spare Israel ' s $ 3-billion annual aid allocation from its budget-cutting fervor . The coincident appearances of Kuchma and Rabin seemed to suggest that it will be extremely difficult for congressional Republicans , no matter how determined to slash foreign_aid in the abstract , to put the ax to particular recipients . There can be no doubt that Ukraine needs the money . With a population of 52 million , Ukraine is the second-most-populous nation carved out of the Soviet_Union . It is also one of the most economically depressed . Recent efforts to introduce private enterprise into the economy so far have only added_to the distress of the population . About $ 350 million of the two-year aid package for Ukraine is intended to reimburse the Kiev government for the cost of dismantling the potent arsenal of nuclear_weapons that it inherited from the defunct Soviet_Union . Most of the rest is designed to keep the economic reforms from collapsing . After hesitating for more_than two years , the Ukrainian Parliament agreed last week to renounce its right to possess nuclear arms . In exchange for Ukraine ' s ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , the United States , Britain and Russia assured Kiev of their assistance should the nation be threatened by a nuclear_power . &quot; Since his election just five months ago , President Kuchma has bravely and squarely confronted the two greatest challenges facing Ukraine -- economic reform and the nuclear question , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; He has taken hard , practical steps required to secure a more peaceful and prosperous future for his people. &quot; Earlier , during a welcoming ceremony , Clinton told Kuchma that he &quot; reminds us of one of our greatest leaders , Franklin_Roosevelt , who provided leadership in a time of great hardship in the United States . Like him , you inherited a nation in the throes of economic depression , and like him , you have lighted the darkness and created hope. &quot; Kuchma said that , despite its current economic distress , Ukraine is not basically a poor country . &quot; We are a young country , and an inexperienced one , &quot; he said . &quot; That is why we are ready to learn in the sphere of economics , politics , humanism on the best examples of other countries. &quot; Clinton and Kuchma signed agreements calling_for future cooperation between the two countries and authorizing joint peacetime space_programs . Lower-ranking officials signed other agreements to encourage private investment in Ukraine . Rabin , who met Clinton on Monday , spent Tuesday on Capitol_Hill meeting with key lawmakers from both parties . Summing_up his meetings , he said he is &quot; confident the United States will continue to assist Israel at the same level &quot; as it has in the past .
