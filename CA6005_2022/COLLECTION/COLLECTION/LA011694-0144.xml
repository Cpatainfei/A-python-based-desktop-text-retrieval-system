   <HEADLINE> PERSONAL FINANCE : IT ' S BACK , IT ' S IMPROVED : BANKING BY COMPUTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Home banking , a once-touted service that nearly died of neglect , is being revived with better products and greater consumer receptivity to new technologies . The result : Millions of Americans probably will be banking via personal_computer within the decade . The newest entries in the home banking market are two of the nation ' s biggest sellers of personal finance software -- Microsoft and Intuit . Both companies have formed alliances with banks and credit_card companies to offer a wide array of check-paying and bank information services via computer . Several regional phone_companies also are working with banks to offer bank services by &quot; video phone , &quot; and other companies promise to usher_in home banking with interactive television . These companies are trying to learn from the mistakes of others . Banks began to roll_out products for personal_computer banking more_than a decade ago , but few of the products ever caught_on . And when Chemical Bank -- which had offered Pronto , one of the most comprehensive early home banking products -- dropped_out of the market in the mid 1980s , the industry was thought to be far from success . Home banking products had captured between 1 % and 2 % of the banking market over the previous 10 years . Some computer users already bank from home . Intuit ' s Quicken software , for example , works with a service_called CheckFree , which charges $ 9.95 monthly for the first 20 electronic checks written each month . Prodigy , an on-line service , also has a home banking product that it offers in conjunction with certain banks . The bank-based products , however , were frequently ponderous and ignored many of the bells and whistles available with financial software . The software companies , meanwhile , couldn ' t offer interactive access to your own bank -- to transfer money between accounts , for example , or to log_on to see if a check had cleared . That seems primed for change , thanks to a flurry of joint_ventures formed between banks and computer companies in the last year : * A subsidiary of regional phone_company US West announced last summer that it will team_up with Electronic Data Systems and a French company to develop home banking by interactive television . * A host of banks -- from Citibank in New York to Banc One Corp . in Columbus , Ohio -- have announced plans to test market telephone-based home banking systems . * Intuit , of Menlo Park , announced it would team_up with Visa to offer home banking via personal_computer to any Visa-member bank that wants to sign_on . * And , late last year , Microsoft announced it would join with a handful of banks to offer home banking products in conjunction with its popular Money software . These and other companies are optimistic because vast improvements in technology are making home banking products cheaper , friendlier and more comprehensive . Also , today ' s consumer is more technologically literate and willing to buy and use the sophisticated systems that are necessary for full-scale home banking . &quot; The market just wasn ' t ready for home banking when it was first offered , &quot; says Richard Bray , product manager at Microsoft in Redmond , Wash . &quot; There weren ' t that many people with personal_computers , and the technology was evolving too fast for the banks to keep_up . It wasn ' t long before the bank products began to look obsolete , in terms of what a personal_computer could do. &quot; Now , 20 million to 30 million Americans have home computers , he says . More and more home computers have modems , which let computers talk to one another by phone , and many of these computers are newer models with the power necessary to run easy-to-use , graphically oriented personal-finance software . * About 52 % of Americans now are willing to bank and pay bills by phone , and roughly 15 % would use a personal_computer for banking if their bank offered the service , said Neal Chambliss , vice_president of PSI , a Tampa-based research firm that conducts home banking surveys . Already , consumers are banking via &quot; remote &quot; more_than half the time , adds Nik Banerjee , director of retail banking for the Bank Administration Institute , a Chicago-based trade group . About 31 % of bank transactions are done at automated teller machines , while 24 % are done over the phone , Banerjee says . Another 2 % use &quot; other &quot; means -- primarily personal_computers . Just 43 % of all transactions are done_in bank branches , according to BAI statistics . But what may prove to be the pivotal measures of whether home banking will fly now are the products themselves . There ' s no doubt that what ' s being offered today is a far_cry from what was_on the market a decade ago . Consider Microsoft ' s soon-to-be-introduced program : Money software to go_on the market next month will be able to hook your computer into three new services -- Bank On-Line , Pay On-Line and Quotes On-Line ( for updating stock and mutual_fund portfolios ) . Many banks are expected to offer Bank On-Line and Pay On-Line together as a package deal for about $ 15 a month . With them , you would be able to transfer money between linked accounts , find_out current balances and pay bills . You also will be able to copy the bank ' s records of your accounts into your personal_computer . Meanwhile , some of the television and telephone-based home banking products promise to link you to shopping networks and investment services as well . You could see something you like on the shopping channel , flip to the banking channel to check your balance , then press a_few buttons to buy the item . Or you could transfer cash from your checking_account to your mutual_fund without bothering to budge from the couch . &quot; When these products were solely for banking , they really didn ' t make_sense for the price , &quot; said Chuck Bruney , senior_vice_president at Speer &amp; Associates in Atlanta . &quot; But now that third-party vendors ( computer and phone_companies ) are packaging them with other products , I really believe they ' re going to catch on. &quot; Home Bank Tips What should you look_for in a home banking product ? Here are some key factors : * Cost . Even though the cost of most home banking products has come_down , they still are relatively expensive . Typically , you ' ll pay between $ 10 and $ 15 a month for a product that allows you unlimited access to balance information , some checking_account statements and the ability to pay 20 bills per month via remote . The bill-paying feature , if used to capacity and no further , saves you roughly $ 6 a month in stamps and envelopes . So the net cost is between $ 4 and $ 9 , in addition to your ordinary checking_account fees . * Compatability . Most products work either in conjunction with a sophisticated telephone or a high-powered computer . If you have to buy equipment that ' s compatible with the home banking product , your overall cost soars . Screen phones , for example , cost between $ 100 and $ 500 each . Software for the computer-based programs can run $ 50 to $ 150 , depending_on what software you ' ve already got . And if you need to upgrade your computer , add several hundred more dollars to the cost . Some companies will lend or rent necessary equipment . If your bank won ' t , consider products that work with what you ' ve got . * Transferability . Do you like your bank enough to know that you won ' t be switching in the near future ? If not , make_sure your home banking service is offered by other banks before you spend money on software or equipment that can ' t be used anywhere else . * Feel . Only you can determine whether you like the way a particular product feels . Is is ponderous ? Does_it require too_much typing or technological skill ? The only way to find_out is to try it out . Ask your bank if you can have a free trial period to see if you like it .</TEXT>
