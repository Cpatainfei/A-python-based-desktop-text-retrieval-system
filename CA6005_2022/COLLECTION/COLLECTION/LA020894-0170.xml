   <HEADLINE> RAIN TRIGGERS SLIDES ON DENUDED HILLSIDES ; STORM : BUSINESSES ALONG VENTURA BOULEVARD SCRAMBLE TO COVER QUAKE-DAMAGED WALLS AND ROOFS WITH PLASTIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Intense downpours from the most powerful storm of the winter lashed the fire-denuded hillsides of Southern California on Monday , loosing mudslides that surged through beachfront houses in Malibu and briefly trapped a dozen residents in Altadena . Winds gusted to 50 m.p.h. as the main force of the storm marched onshore , rocking outlying areas with thunder claps . A waterspout was reported off Santa Barbara , and cyclonic winds touched_down in Sunland and in Orange County . Commuter_traffic -- already crippled by earthquake detours -- slowed to a crawl_in many areas as low-lying intersections flooded and vehicles skidded into one another on rain-slick streets . Officials warned that several major mountain highways -- such_as those used as detours through the San Gabriels by Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley commuters to bypass quake bottlenecks -- probably would be blocked with heavy snow by dawn today . Cloudbursts drenched work crews laboring around the clock to repair quake-damaged freeways and the battered Cal State Northridge campus . Rain soaked_through temporary patches on roofs battered by the Jan . 17 temblor and made life a little more miserable for earthquake refugees still huddled in temporary shelters . About 3 # 200 homes lost power for three hours in portions of Sunland , Sun Valley , Granada Hills and North Hollywood . The potent core of the storm began moving onshore about 2 p.m. , and within an hour , hillsides that were stripped bare in last fall ' s devastating brush_fires began to give_way . In Malibu , water , mud and rocks coursed down canyons to the sea , invading homes and blocking portions of Pacific Coast Highway between Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Malibu Canyon Road . A delta of debris washed_out of Big Rock Canyon Road and across the Pacific Coast Highway , sloshing up against about a dozen houses and scattering half_a_dozen cars and trucks like sandbox toys . Homeowners and emergency crews struggled through the muck , trying to erect makeshift dikes with sandbags . But despite their efforts , the mud seeped into the shorefront homes and about 15 houses farther inland at Big Rock and in Las Flores Canyon . More_than 30 residents were forced to evacuate -- some of them after being plucked from their roofs , where they had taken refuge from the rising mud and water , in the bucket of a Caltrans skip-loader . Several people who didn ' t want to leave &quot; had to be removed forcibly , &quot; according to Los Angeles County Fire Capt . Scott Smith . One who left willingly was Greg Powers , whose beachfront house was invaded by tree_trunks , uprooted shrubbery and almost four feet of mud and water . Powers said his Jeep was carried_away by the torrent that hit his home about 3 p.m. &quot; I think I might move , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m tired_of this . First it was the fires , then the earthquake , now this. &quot; As Powers surveyed the damage , he carried his two yowling cats around with him in a soggy cardboard pet carrier . &quot; They ' re kind of upset , &quot; he said . In the San Fernando Valley , which bore the brunt of last month ' s earthquake , businesses big and small along Ventura Boulevard scrambled to cover damaged walls and roofs with huge sheets of plastic . One office in a three-story building in Sherman Oaks had been left completely open_to the elements , and although workers covered the open area with plastic sheeting , water seeped down through cracks and damaged office supplies . The supplies were left in &quot; the one part of the suite that we thought would be safe , &quot; said Elsie Bowker , 50 , owner of a Sherman Oaks property-management company that once occupied the damaged suite . &quot; We didn ' t know that it was the room that the rain would come in. &quot; Coming so soon after the quake , the storm added &quot; insult to injury , &quot; Bowker commented . At Century Bank in Encino , it was the timing of the rain that caught bank employees off_guard . &quot; We were somewhat prepared_for the rain , but frankly I forgot about one damaged part of the roof , and the rain leaked in there , &quot; said Albert Sage , a Century vice_president . Sage estimated the storm would add $ 10 # 000 to the $ 250 # 000 damage the bank suffered in the earthquake . About 3 # 200 customers in North Hollywood , Granada Hills , Sun Valley and Sunland were left in the dark when the rains and wind knocked_out five main circuits in the area . Service was largely restored by about 9 p.m. Winds described by witnesses as &quot; cyclonic &quot; knocked_down trees and electrical lines in Sun Valley , leaving traffic_signals and a train crossing gate without power . An area just north of the Burbank Airport was particularly hard hit . At about 3:40 p.m. , Crockett Street resident Sandra Morales heard a loud thud outside her home . &quot; I looked_out the window and there was garbage in the air , but I didn ' t see my car , &quot; said Morales , 23 . &quot; When I went outside , I saw the tree was lying on my car. &quot; Nearby , at the busy intersection of San Fernando Road and Sunland Boulevard , a sign broke_off the El Mexicano Taco Stand , shattering in the street . The windows of the drive-in stand also blew_out . &quot; The glass shattered and went_into the food , &quot; said cook Max Alcaraz , 17 . &quot; But we just heated_up more and kept it going. &quot; Throughout the Valley , the rain overwhelmed storm drains , creating small rivers that slowed traffic on many boulevards . Above Malibu , basketball-sized rocks crashed down onto Old Topanga Canyon Road , and sheets of mud and gravel covered stretches of the pavement . The persistent rains were beginning to warp wooden signs erected to thank firefighters for their efforts during the hellish fires that burned through Topanga Canyon last fall . Sharon Sandler returned from work Monday night to find her Malibu house filled with four feet of mud . &quot; The bedroom has been washed_away into the ocean , &quot; she said . &quot; It was like a river running_through it. &quot; The muck spilled off her back_porch like a waterfall , splattering down into storm-driven waves that swirled around the pilings supporting her home . Although some of the sand around the pilings was washing_away , all_the homes appeared to be standing_fast Monday night . &quot; The same thing happened &quot; more_than 20 years ago , said neighbor Monique Marti , who said she probably would spend the night with friends in Santa Monica . &quot; But you hate to go_away from your home , &quot; she said . &quot; Because you don ' t know what it will look_like when you get back. &quot; Vera Smith slogged her way to safety after her Mercedes-Benz was trapped in a mudflow near Big Rock Drive . &quot; As I looked_to make the next curve , there was this huge bank of mud coming toward me , &quot; she told a KABC-TV crew . &quot; Unbelievable , unbelievable . Things you see in the movies -- and it was happening to me. &quot; In Altadena , mud , rocks and debris from about 600 acres burned in last fall ' s fire slid_down onto Pasadena Glen Road during a short but intensive cloudburst , isolating about 20 hillside homes and damaging some of them . Most of the residents had already fled or were away at_work , but about a dozen were cut_off from escape as the mudslides continued to threaten their houses . After about an hour , county firefighters slogged through mud up_to four feet deep to reach the stranded people and escort them to safety . There were no reports of injuries . The Altadena slide cut another street , Old Grove Road , but the residents there were able to use alternate routes . In Orange County , cyclonic winds touched_down near an industrial area and carved a swath to UC Irvine , blowing down trees and power_lines , shattering windows and damaging a roof , police and fire officials said . Laguna Beach hillsides ravaged in the Oct . 27 fire were holding_up pretty well , according to Bill Reiter , public works operations manager for the county ' s Environmental Management Agency . Reiter ' s office was coordinating the efforts of about 50 workers -- including 24 prison inmates -- on_hand to monitor the situation and help shore_up the hillsides in case of mudslides . Curtis Brack , a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. , said the heavy rain should have tapered_off well before dawn today , with a_few showers -- and possibly some more thundershowers -- predicted until about noon . &quot; There should be partial clearing by the afternoon as the storm system continues moving inland , &quot; he said . &quot; After that , it looks_like it should be pretty dry for the rest of the week. &quot; By 5 p.m. Monday , 0.51 of an inch of rain had fallen at the Los Angeles Civic Center , raising the total for the season to 3.21 inches . The normal season ' s total for Feb . 7 is 8.61 inches . By this time last year , the city had received 18.83 inches . Other rainfall totals as of 5 p.m. Monday included 1.73 inches in Santa Barbara , 1.58 in Long_Beach , 1.30 in Santa Ana , 1.01 at Los Angeles International Airport , 0.88 in Palm Springs , 0.71 in Newport Beach , 0.63 in Monrovia , 0.41 in San Diego and 0.08 in Bakersfield .
