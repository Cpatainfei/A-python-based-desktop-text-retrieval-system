   <HEADLINE> GOP LEADERS VOW QUICK DRIVE TO CUT CAPITAL_GAINS TAX ; CONGRESS : KEY REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER ALSO WANTS TO EXPLORE ELIMINATION OF FEDERAL INCOME_TAX . TOUGH WELFARE REFORM IS ANOTHER PART OF THE AGENDA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new Republican leadership of Congress vowed Thursday to push for an immediate cut_in the capital_gains tax early next year , and the GOP chairman-designate of the House Ways and Means Committee said he plans to explore the possibility of eliminating the federal income_tax altogether . In addition , congressional Republicans must enact welfare reform legislation that strips most recipients of benefits after two years with no government safety net -- even if that forces indigent parents to give_up their children , said Rep . Bill Archer ( R-Tex. ) , who is in_line to take_over the Ways and Means panel . &quot; If we ' re going to be serious about having a program that requires work , then you ' ve got_to be in the position to say : ' You lose your welfare benefits and if the children cannot be supported by you , they have to be put into foster_homes , ' &quot; Archer said in an interview . The Texas conservative is the first Republican committee chairman to begin spelling_out details of his legislative priorities in the wake of Tuesday ' s electoral landslide . But the likely Republican chairmen of several key House and Senate committees served notice that they will seek to reverse some of the changes enacted since President Clinton took_office and steer the nation into a sharp , Reaganesque right turn . Many of the proposed tax cuts are perennial GOP priorities , including the reduction of taxes paid on capital_gains -- the profits from selling stocks , bonds and other investment assets . And even before the election , the Republicans ' &quot; contract with America &quot; had called_for a two-year limit on welfare with no guarantee of a fallback government job . But weighing the eventual elimination of the income_tax , the primary source of federal revenues , represents a radical departure from mainstream tax_policy . And enforcing a two-year limit on welfare , including food_stamps , so strictly that poor families could be forced to place their children in foster_homes would be Draconian even by conservative standards . Some analysts had expected the Republicans to moderate their more controversial positions once they take_control of Congress . Archer said that , on the contrary , their electoral victories if anything will make their positions even &quot; tougher. &quot; &quot; We have a responsibility now to roll_up our sleeves . . . and deliver , &quot; he said . Rep . E . Clay Shaw Jr . ( R-Fla. ) , likely chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on human resources , which will handle welfare reform , said the bill he plans to draft will follow Archer ' s prescription . While it seems improbable that Congress will vote to scrap the federal income_tax any time soon , the conservative wave produced by this week ' s midterm elections appears to have made some kind of tax reduction almost a certainty next year . Senior Clinton_Administration officials conceded Thursday that the White_House is likely to propose its own broad , middle-class tax cut_in an effort to blunt Republican initiatives . &quot; I think the chances may be going_up that we will do a tax cut , &quot; said one senior official who requested anonymity . Archer and other senior Republicans made_it clear that the Democrats face wrenching changes inside Congress as well as in policy initiatives , including reductions in committee assignments and staff sizes , as they slip into minority-party status after losing_control of Congress for the first time in 40 years . Preparing to replace Rep . Sam Gibbons ( D-Fla. ) as chairman of the pivotal Ways and Means panel , Archer said his first order_of_business will be a major revision of the nation ' s tax laws to promote savings and investment . The changes are designed to carry_out provisions of the GOP &quot; contract , &quot; which was signed by more_than 300 Republican candidates . Among the immediate priorities : cutting the capital_gains tax_rate , phasing_out the &quot; marriage penalty &quot; that taxes married_couples at higher rates than two single people living together and raising the earnings limit on outside income for Social_Security recipients . In addition , Archer said that within the first 100 days of the new Republican Congress , he will seek to restore tax-sheltered individual_retirement_accounts for upper-income earners and approve a $ 500-per-child tax_credit for families . The incoming Ways and Means chairman said a longer-term goal is the &quot; complete replacement &quot; of the current system of income taxation in favor of a &quot; national consumption tax , &quot; or sales tax , that could serve as an &quot; engine to drive job creation . . . and economic activity. &quot; Asked how the proposed tax cuts could be enacted without violating congressional budget rules and running_up the federal budget_deficit , Archer said the GOP contract had identified &quot; innumerable &quot; ways to cut spending and achieve savings in other areas . One immediate target is Congress itself . The Republicans plan to cut committee staffs by about a third and reduce the number of seats on many committees . Archer said he hopes to pare the Ways and Means panel from 38 to 29 seats and &quot; return millions of dollars to the taxpayers &quot; through staff reductions . &quot; We are going_to truly change this Congress and the way it operates , &quot; he said . Administration officials , while still shocked by the prospect of conservatives like Archer seizing control of national economic_policy , said they realize it will be politically difficult to draft a new budget that does not contain some kind of tax-cut proposal . Cautioning that final budget decisions are still weeks away , White_House officials said any tax cuts must be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget to comply with the President ' s deficit-reduction plan . &quot; The election doesn ' t change the basic economic considerations that we would have to make in our budget deliberations before we can do a tax cut , &quot; said Gene Sperling , deputy director of the White_House National Economic Council . Sperling said Administration officials , who savaged the &quot; contract with America &quot; and other GOP campaign proposals before the election , are eager to see whether the Republican congressional majority can make the budgetary math behind their plans add_up . &quot; They now have the same responsibility that we do for showing the American people how they will pay_for their tax cuts , &quot; Sperling said . &quot; And one thing that both parties should agree to is not to go_back to the days of magic asterisks and rosy scenarios . . . to make the math work. &quot; But it appears likely that the Clinton &quot; investment agenda &quot; of new domestic spending will languish in the new Congress . And the Administration may find itself forced to spend its political resources in a renewal of its battle against a balanced-budget amendment , a key element of the Republican contract . At the same time they trumpeted the changes they want to make , the new barons of Capitol_Hill sought to soften their post-election rhetoric by pledging to work with the Democrats wherever possible after taking_control of the House and Senate in January . A senior aide to incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia said Republicans will try to focus initially on issues &quot; where we think we can cooperate and reach some agreement with the President. &quot; The first priorities are likely to be welfare reform and a line-item veto , both of which have been endorsed in concept by Clinton , the aide said . The conciliatory tone contrasted sharply with the pointed critique offered the previous day by Gingrich , who characterized the President and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as &quot; counterculture McGovernicks , &quot; and the White_House staff as &quot; left-wing elitists. &quot; As they begin the transition from opposition to governing party , the Republicans are realizing that &quot; to get things done , we are going_to have to start working with the White_House , &quot; a senior GOP aide said . Remaining at loggerheads , the aide said , would foster &quot; the kind of gridlock that hamstrung the institution when ( George ) Bush was President &quot; and the government was divided between a Democratic Congress and a Republican White_House . Archer acknowledged that the Republicans will have to cooperate with the White_House because their majorities in the House and Senate will not be large enough to override a presidential veto . In a speech at Georgetown University on Thursday , Clinton cited welfare reform as the kind of major issue on which he and the GOP leadership clearly &quot; can work together &quot; and find common_ground in the new political world created by this week ' s election . And vetoing a reform bill could open Clinton to criticism of reneging_on his own popular campaign pledge to &quot; end the welfare system as we know it. &quot; Yet key Republican and Democratic lawmakers said in interviews Thursday that the stark legislative package that House Republicans plan to force quickly through Congress bears little resemblance to the carrot-and-stick approach to overhauling the welfare system that Clinton and his allies envisioned . In addition to cutting_off all benefits -- including food_stamps and health_insurance -- to most recipients after two years on welfare , the GOP proposal would deny benefits to teen-agers who have babies and make illegal immigrants ineligible for all federal assistance programs , including food_stamps and Aid for Families With Dependent Children , the main cash assistance program for families . These provisions , along with others in the GOP initiative , are far harsher than changes sought by Clinton , who has proposed making the government the employer of last_resort for welfare recipients . &quot; At least in the President ' s version , a job has to be available , &quot; said Rep . Robert T . Matsui ( D-Sacramento ) . &quot; If welfare becomes just a two-year program with no provisions for jobs . . , that would have the impact of creating a massive amount of homelessness throughout the United States. &quot; The potential collision over welfare policy could become one of the defining political issues of the next two years . And with Tuesday ' s election returns widely interpreted as a public rejection of big government , Democrats may find it difficult to muster enthusiasm for a Clinton-style reform plan that would require significant increases in federal spending . Archer and Shaw said Americans had spoken clearly Tuesday in favor of welfare reform that seriously combats the problems of out-of-wedlock births and dependence on entitlements such_as welfare . &quot; Ultimately if they cannot support their children , the children will be taken_care of through loving families through foster care and adoption , &quot; Archer said . &quot; It ' s better for their children. &quot; The Clinton plan , Archer charged , is &quot; anemic &quot; because it exempts all but the welfare recipients between 18 and 25 years old from the work requirement and allows states to exempt a sizable portion of welfare recipients in that age_group , so only about 250 # 000 would have to work by the year 2000 . The Republican bill , in contrast would require work for 1.5 million welfare recipients by the year 2000 . Shaw said he believes that political considerations will make_it difficult for the President to reject the welfare reform proposal presented to him by the Republican Congress . &quot; The President ' s own party was unwilling to carry it forward last session . I think that ' s part of the reason so many Republicans were elected around the country , &quot; Shaw said . &quot; Now the Republicans carry the ball. &quot; Shaw said he does not believe that Clinton could veto a welfare reform bill . &quot; He would regret that the rest of his political life , &quot; Shaw said . Meanwhile , other key Republicans began serving notice that they will seek major changes in their areas as well . Sen . Jesse Helms , the conservative North Carolina Republican who is in_line to take_over the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said he plans major cuts_in foreign_aid to keep &quot; taxpayer money . . . from going_down foreign rat holes. &quot; Sen . Strom Thurmond ( R-S.C. ) , who will replace Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said through a spokeswoman that his main priority will be to increase defense spending significantly . Rep . Thomas J . Bliley Jr . ( R-Va. ) , the most likely candidate to succeed Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment , said he will snuff_out an ongoing congressional investigation of the tobacco_industry . &quot; I don ' t think we need any more legislation regulating tobacco , &quot; said Bliley , who represents a district in which Philip Morris Inc. is the largest private employer and who received substantial contributions from the tobacco_industry for his campaign . A transition team composed of senior aides to Gingrich and Rep . Dick Armey of Texas , the probable new majority_leader , worked behind closed doors on plans to cut hundreds of congressional staff positions and replace Democratic appointees in scores of patronage posts . The looming reduction in_force is expected to put several thousand Democratic staff_members and other officials out_of_work . An atmosphere of resignation and gloom pervaded Democratic offices on both sides of the Capitol as anxious and dejected aides began cleaning_out their desks and writing their resumes . &quot; I don ' t know what I am going_to do , &quot; said one House aide , who asked not to be identified as she broke_down in tears . &quot; There are so many of us who are going_to be out_of_work , and there ' s not much of a market out there for losers. &quot; Times staff writers Melissa Healy , James Risen and Thomas B . Rosenstiel contributed to this story . * BUSINESS IMPACT : What investors should look_for in a capital_gains tax cut .
