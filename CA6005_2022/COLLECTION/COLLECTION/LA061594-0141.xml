   <HEADLINE> UKRAINE FEELS GLOBAL PRESSURE TO CLOSE CHERNOBYL PLANT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Across the Continent , Europeans and others at two key sessions made_it clear to Ukraine that it has little choice but to close the Chernobyl plant , scene of the world ' s worst nuclear accident eight years ago . In Vienna , delegates from more_than 70 countries met Tuesday to discuss tough new nuclear safety measures that could force the closure of the Chernobyl power_station . The three-day international conference , organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency , is reviewing a draft Nuclear Safety Convention that would require signatories to close unsafe nuclear plants . If Ukraine becomes a signatory , it might be obliged to shut Chernobyl unless internationally approved safety measures are adopted at the reactors still in_operation . An explosion and fire at Chernobyl in April , 1986 , spewed radiation across Europe and left 31 people dead in the immediate aftermath . Meanwhile , Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk signed a sweeping trade and cooperation treaty with the European Union on Tuesday in Luxembourg , but EU nations warned it may_not take_effect unless the former Soviet republic agrees to give_up its nuclear_weapons . The EU also made clear to Kravchuk that Ukraine should shut_down the Chernobyl plant . At a summit next week on the Greek island of Corfu , EU leaders will discuss helping Ukraine cover the costs of closing Chernobyl .</TEXT>
