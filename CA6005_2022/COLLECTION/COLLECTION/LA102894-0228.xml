   <HEADLINE> GROUP CONDUCTS ABORTION_PILL STUDY IN SECRECY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fearful of violence , a research organization is conducting the first nationwide study of the_French abortion_pill RU 486 without saying where the work is being done or how many clinics are participating . &quot; You may have noticed there are some nuts out there who do bad things to people who deliver abortions , &quot; said Dr. C . Wayne Bardin , research_director at the Population Council , the nonprofit group sponsoring the study . More_than 100 women have been given the pill since September as part of the $ 8-million study , which could make the drug routinely available in the United States by 1996 , Bardin said . The availability of RU 486 , now called mifepristone , will not be advertised , Bardin said Thursday at a news_conference . Women coming_to clinics for surgical abortions will be advised , he said . Immediately after the news_conference , the Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced that its clinics in San Diego ; Aurora , Colo. ; Cambridge , Mass. ; Des Moines ; Houston , and Williston , Vt. , are participating . Jane Johnson , executive_vice_president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , said she did not expect Planned Parenthood ' s participation to require any additional security . In July , Dr. John Britton and his bodyguard were shot to death outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola , Fla . The National Abortion Federation in Washington has reports of 38 bombings and 91 cases of arson at abortion clinics since 1977 . The RU 486 study is aimed at determining the pill ' s safety and effectiveness . When it is completed in the spring of 1995 , an application for approval will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration . &quot; It is a tragedy that pro-abortion advocates want to use women as guinea_pigs , &quot; said Wanda Franz , president of the National Right_to_Life Committee . &quot; NRLC opposes testing of RU 486 for abortion both because it kills unborn children and because its long-term side_effects for women are unknown. &quot;</TEXT>
