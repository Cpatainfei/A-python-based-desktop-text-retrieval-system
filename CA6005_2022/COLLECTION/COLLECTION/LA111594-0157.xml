   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : SHERMAN OAKS ; DEMONSTRATORS OPPOSE QUAKE REPAIR DISTRICT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About 40 demonstrators , some waving signs , paraded in front of Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky ' s field office on Ventura Boulevard on Monday , seeking to persuade the councilman to vote against a controversial proposal to create an emergency redevelopment area in the community . The City_Council will decide today whether to establish the Sherman Oaks redevelopment area , which would be the first such district in the San Fernando Valley . Five others in areas surrounding Northridge , Reseda , North Hollywood , Pacoima and East Hollywood will be reviewed by the council beginning Wednesday . Matt Epstein , co-chairman of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. ' s CRA study committee , presented Yaroslavsky aide Mark Spellman with a petition that Epstein said was signed by 2 # 500 Sherman Oaks residents . &quot; Last week , it came_out in the paper that Zev was leaning toward the ( redevelopment area ) because there has been no negative response from the community , &quot; Epstein said . &quot; We went_out this weekend and we got signatures. &quot; Spellman accepted the thick sheaf of papers and said simply , &quot; I ' ll get these to him today. &quot; Alisa Katz , Yaroslavsky ' s chief_of_staff , said the councilman had not made_up his mind on the issue . The petition &quot; is a very important piece of information , &quot; Katz said . &quot; I don ' t want to understate the significance of that many signatures. &quot; Katz added that the redevelopment project could be a good tool to bring funds for rebuilding into the community . The Community Redevelopment Agency has proposed the $ 18.8-million , 900-acre project in Sherman Oaks as a way to rebuild quake-damaged buildings and to make infrastructure improvements . The money would come from the sale of bonds , to be repaid by increased tax_revenues resulting from the improvements . Homeowners said they took their petition drive door-to-door and to supermarkets . The homeowners ' group feels the proposal does not have adequate limits on the CRA ' s powers to condemn property and could allow too_much money to be spent on street and sewer improvements at the expense of residential rebuilding . The Chamber_of_Commerce , however , supports the idea . Gary Holme , who said he manages properties with a total of 1 # 500 units in Sherman Oaks , said that existing private and public funding sources can take_care of the rebuilding that needs to be done , and that construction has already begun on many of the structures the CRA considers to be in need of help . CRA officials said that as of Oct . 11 there were 800 damaged residential buildings , comprising 10 # 100 units , and 200 crumbled commercial buildings in Sherman Oaks . According to Holme , however , there are only 47 residential structures -- equaling 1 # 210 units -- and only five commercial buildings that have shown no signs of reconstruction activity . Proposed Redevelopment Area The Community Redevelopment Agency wants to create a 900-acre redevelopment zone in Sherman Oaks , one of the hardest-hit areas in the quake . A portion of local property_taxes will be diverted to pay_for reconstruction , new construction and public improvements . Source : Community Redevelopment AgencyKAY HWANGBO</TEXT>
