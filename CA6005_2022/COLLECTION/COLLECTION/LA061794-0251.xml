   <TEXT> Jumping_out of an airplane would appear to be an activity grounded in insanity . After all , it ' s traditionally been reserved for emergency escapes_from flaming single-engines . But sky-diving has become a thrill-seeker ' s sport . It ' s the ultimate version of bungee-jumping . It starts_out the same -- with a flying leap -- but sky-diving affords you no no last-minute tether to sling you back . With sky-diving it ' s all or nothing . And the promised adrenaline rush is the exact reason why Sunny Hills junior Chris Winkler decided to do_it . &quot; I ' m a thrill-seeker , &quot; he said . Winkler let his cousin drag him to do_it last year . But before be could get_in the plane , he and all other prospective participants had to take a sky-diving class . They were versed in emergency_procedure and safe landing and basically told what to expect out of a jump . And before anyone could back_out , the jumpers were fitted with parachutes and taken_up in an airplane . &quot; They took us out over the desert , and then they just opened the door and we had to jump , &quot; Winkler said . &quot; I kind of hesitated at the door , but I had to do_it . I didn ' t want to have to go_back down in the plane . &quot; But I wasn ' t that scared. &quot; According to Winkler , right as you jump_out of the plane you feel that &quot; falling &quot; sensation , when your stomach kind of jumps into your throat . But after a_few seconds , &quot; you get used to it &quot; and can enjoy the ride . After a little while , Winkler pulled the cord on his parachute and sailed down to a sort of rough-and-tumble landing . &quot; I landed and then fell_down and got a lot of bruises. &quot; But he liked it enough to give it another shot a_few months later . That time , they just went_up , no training . &quot; I wasn ' t as scared the second time , &quot; Winkler said . &quot; I waited longer before pulling the cord on the parachute. &quot; In case the first cord doesn ' t work , there ' s a second emergency cord on the parachute . But , he added , &quot; If the second cord doesn ' t work , you ' re screwed. &quot; Winkler , however , never really thinks_about the danger aspect of sky-diving ; he figures it ' s part of the fun . &quot; that ' s what makes_it exciting. &quot; Melody McGrath is a senior at Sunny Hills High_School in Fullerton .
