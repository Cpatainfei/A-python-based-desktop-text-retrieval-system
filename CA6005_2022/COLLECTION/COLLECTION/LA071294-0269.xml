   <HEADLINE> U.S. ADMITS FRENCH ROLE IN HIV TEST KIT ; HEALTH : OFFICIALS SAY THAT THE VIRUS USED BY SCIENTISTS CAME FROM FRANCE . ROYALTIES WILL BE MORE EVENLY SPLIT UNDER A NEW AGREEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States acknowledged Monday that government scientists used a French-provided virus to invent the American test kit for the AIDS virus , and Washington agreed to increase payments to the_French under a 1987 royalty-sharing formula . The new agreement is intended to &quot; normalize the sometimes rocky relations &quot; between the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Pasteur Institute in Paris , said Dr. Harold Varmus , NIH director . The two agencies have been at_odds since 1983 over credit for discovery of the human_immunodeficiency_virus and the subsequent race to patent a test for the virus . In 1984 , the U.S. Patent_Office granted the patent to the American team . While NIH scientist Robert C . Gallo has been cleared of allegations that he stole the virus from the_French , Gallo has conceded that he &quot; likely &quot; used a virus he received from Pasteur researcher Luc Montagnier in inventing the American HIV test kit . Gallo and Montagnier ended_up sharing credit for discovering the virus . The official NIH acknowledgment that Gallo had used a French-provided virus was &quot; something that has never been said before by the U.S._government , &quot; according to Washington attorneys Michael Epstein and Robert Odle , who represented the_French in the dispute . &quot; It ' s a complete vindication of the Pasteur Institute , &quot; Odle said in a telephone_interview . Gallo issued a statement , saying : &quot; It is now time for this episode to be permanently closed . Pasteur scientists and I should focus all our energies on seeking a cure for AIDS. &quot; The two nations reached a settlement seven years ago to share_in the royalties for the HIV test kit , based on sales in each country . But largely because more American than French test kits are being sold , the U.S. has received $ 20 million in royalties to the Pasteur ' s $ 14 million . Varmus said that the new royalty-sharing arrangement is expected to provide the_French several hundred_thousand dollars more per year . His announcement included an open acknowledgment by the NIH and its parent agency , the Department of Health and Human Services , that &quot; scientists at the NIH used a virus provided to them by Institut Pasteur to invent the American HIV test kit. &quot; Varmus said that the acknowledgment came &quot; in light of the current state of knowledge , &quot; including an independent study in 1991 that supported the_French claims . Under the new arrangement , each side will continue to keep the first 20 % of royalties from sales of test kits in each country . The remaining 80 % of each side ' s royalties will be pooled and distributed in a different manner , with Pasteur getting 50 % , the NIH 25 % and the World AIDS Foundation the final 25 % . The old formula gave 25 % of the pooled revenues to the World AIDS Foundation , which funds education and research in the developing world , and 37.5 % each to France and the United States . Varmus said that the new formula is intended to give the United States and France &quot; approximately equal shares of the test kit royalties over the lives of the patents. &quot; He called the new agreement &quot; fair and equitable &quot; and expressed the hope that it has put &quot; this distraction behind us. &quot;</TEXT>
