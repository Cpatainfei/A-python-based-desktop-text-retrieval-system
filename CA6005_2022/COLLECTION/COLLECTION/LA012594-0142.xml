   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; TRAINS ' IMPORTANCE IN QUAKE DISCUSSED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County residents would need a variety of ways to commute in the event of an earthquake and would be especially reliant_on Metrolink trains , the chairman of the county ' s top transportation agency said Monday . &quot; The earthquake in Los Angeles County demonstrated the need to have a multi-mode transportation_system , with elements that can fill the gap when major roads and arteries are out , &quot; Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez , chairman of the Orange County Transportation Authority , told the OCTA board . Then the supervisor singled_out Metrolink , adding that the &quot; earthquake brought Metrolink to the forefront , &quot; Vasquez said . OCTA operates one commuter_train daily on a round_trip between Orange County and Los Angeles ; although the train is painted with periwinkle and white Metrolink markings , technically Metrolink won ' t officially come_to the county until March , when three additional trains will join the route . The existing service is run_by Amtrak crews under contract to OCTA . OCTA board_member Sarah Catz said she is confident that the additional trains will be available even though Los Angeles has borrowed rail cars to serve in the current crisis . Vasquez said he and OCTA Chief Stan Oftelie will discuss the need for OCTA to maintain full service in the event of an earthquake similar to the one centered in Northridge a week ago . Vasquez said he has been reassured that the office_building in Orange where OCTA is headquartered has been strengthened , and he intends to press his inquiry to be sure that OCTA ' s satellite facilities -- including bus yards and depots -- will also be serviceable after a significant quake . Advance communications and planning are important , Vasquez said , because of an earthquake ' s &quot; devastating economic and social impact. &quot; JEFFREY A . PERLMAN</TEXT>
