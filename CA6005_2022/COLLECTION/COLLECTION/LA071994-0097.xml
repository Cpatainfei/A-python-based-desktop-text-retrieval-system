   <HEADLINE> 14 CAR_DEALERS CLAIM MISSING COUPLE TOOK THEM FOR A RIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Call it the battle of the Toyota dealerships . Or car wars . Nearly three years after car brokers Dan and Mayumi Nishikawa bought first-class flights to Japan for themselves , their children and their cat , 16 auto dealerships across Southern California are winding_up a messy civil lawsuit . The suit alleges that the couple wrote $ 1.8 million in rubber checks_in 1991 so they could , in_effect , defraud 14 of the dealerships out of 129 pricey automobiles . Lawyers for all_the car_dealers say the Nishikawas , who have not been located , contended that they and their Torrance-based PIAA Inc. car brokerage were &quot; ethnic brokers , &quot; who bought new cars and sold them to Asian and Asian American buyers wary of non-Asian car salespeople . But lawyers for the 14 dealerships -- 13 Toyota franchises and Lexus of Santa Monica -- allege that the Nishikawas actually pulled_off a &quot; Ponzi-like scheme &quot; on them by gaining their trust over several years and then writing bad_checks on one huge , final purchase of cars . The dealers allege in a suit in Los Angeles Superior_Court that the Nishikawas were aided by a lack of caution at Toyota of North Hollywood and Koreatown-based Han Kook Motors Inc. The lawsuit by the 14 dealerships against the two firms alleges that the Nishikawas resold many of the autos they bought to those two dealerships , at prices so low the dealerships ' executives should have been suspicious of the sales . * Last Thursday , a state appellate_court panel generally agreed with that assessment . The three-judge panel , with little comment , upheld a 1993 Superior_Court ruling in favor of the 14 dealerships . The panel ' s decision means that whatever happened to the money -- and to the Nishikawas -- the lower court_order stands , requiring Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors to pay about $ 1.8 million to the dealerships for the cars , plus court costs and interest . &quot; It was the basic_principle of robbing Peter to pay Paul until the whole_thing collapses , &quot; said Norris Bishton , a lawyer who represents the 14 dealers and owns one of them , Toyota of Garden Grove . Court testimony by a PIAA employee described the Nishikawas as doing very well for themselves -- trading up from a small rented South Bay apartment to several posh houses . They had a lavish lifestyle , complete with shopping trips to Rodeo Drive for $ 5 # 000 suits and a white limousine to ferry their children to school , according to court documents . Just about everything else in the case remains hotly contested , including whether the Nishikawas spent the money on their affluent lifestyle as they went_along , lost_it in bad business_deals or absconded with the loot at the end when the alleged scheme collapsed . Toyota Motor Sales USA , which oversees all Toyota franchise dealerships in this country , declined to comment . &quot; They tried to stay out of it -- legally they stayed out of it -- but they are in the middle of it &quot; because they must deal with parties on both sides , one lawyer involved said of Toyota . One Toyota executive , who asked not to be identified , agreed , saying the parent corporation has taken great pains to stay neutral . &quot; It would be between the dealers , &quot; said John Matt , vice_president of sales for Toyota Motor Sales USA . &quot; Certainly there was a dispute and a conflict between the dealers involved. &quot; According to testimony and court documents , the Nishikawas were middlemen of sorts who over several years bought thousands of brand new Toyotas and Lexuses at dealers from Carlsbad to Thousand Oaks to San Bernardino , and then sold them at cost , or a loss , to Han Kook or the North Hollywood dealership , while keeping some of the proceeds for themselves . But all that , lawyers for the 14 dealerships allege in court documents , was part of an even larger setup to gain the trust of dealership executives before defrauding them in a big final score . In October , 1991 , the Nishikawas bought 179 new cars for about $ 2.6 million , sold most of them to Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors and then left the country before anyone realized that funds did not exist to pay_for the cars , lawyers allege in court documents . Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors &quot; should have been more suspicious that something was wrong , &quot; because the Nishikawas continued selling them cars for less than the Toyota factory ' s wholesale price , Bishton said . &quot; They knew ( something was wrong ) , but they chose to look the other way . &quot; It was like someone was saying to them , ' we ' ll sell you $ 100 bills for $ 90 apiece , ' &quot; Bishton said . &quot; The court found they . . . chose to look the other way while continuing to buy the cars in bad faith. &quot; As for the Nishikawas , Bishton said he tried to get authorities to extradite them to the United States to face criminal prosecution . &quot; I could never interest law_enforcement in looking_for them , &quot; he said . &quot; It has been very frustrating. &quot; A spokeswoman for Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti and an official with the state_Department of Motor_Vehicles said they were unaware of any criminal investigations into the Nishikawas or the car deals . A lawyer for Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors sees things differently . J . Douglas Post contends that his two clients did nothing wrong and that at least some of the other 14 dealers were improperly benefiting from the bulk sale of the cars to PIAA , falsely reporting them in such a way as_to rack_up lucrative incentive benefits from the factory . Bishton denied any wrongdoing on the part of his clients . Indeed , Post said , the court failed to uphold most of the arguments by lawyers for the 14 plaintiff dealerships , including their allegation that the Nishikawas and the two dealerships had engaged in a conspiracy or unfair competition . Post said the 14 dealerships prevailed only on a so-called &quot; conversion claim &quot; against Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors , in which they claimed continuing ownership rights to the cars because they were never paid_for by PIAA , which stands_for Pacific Imported Automobiles of America . The two dealerships , however , claimed that the original 14 dealers lost their ownership rights when they sold the vehicles to PIAA on credit , and not for cash . Where the cars involved are now is unclear . Lawyers said they probably were resold by the two dealerships long ago . * Post said the 14 dealers sought $ 15 million in their original suit , and that figure was whittled_down to an ultimate judgment of less than $ 2 million . As for the Nishikawas , Post said : &quot; They lost the money . They didn ' t go_back to Japan with a $ 2-million pot of money . There may have been shopping trips to Rodeo Drive and whatnot. &quot; He said the Nishikawas lost money on the cars they did not get paid_for . Post maintained that his clients ' only failing was an innocent one . &quot; The judges found that we should have known that these plaintiffs retained some ownership rights to the cars they sold to PIAA by virtue of the fact that they didn ' t end_up getting paid , &quot; he said . &quot; There was no way for us to know that. &quot; The Nishikawas were selling the cars at_a_loss to build_up a relationship with the dealers on both sides , and they ultimately wanted to recoup their losses by opening a retail facility in Torrance to sell cars to the public , he said . &quot; I don ' t know if we ' ll ever know exactly why they did_it , &quot; another attorney for the 14 dealerships , Thomas S . Nessinger , said of the Nishikawas . &quot; . . . They purchased plane_tickets for themselves , their children and their cat in 1991 just when the whole_thing was crashing , and just kind of left some American employees to sit there and face this mob. &quot;</TEXT>
