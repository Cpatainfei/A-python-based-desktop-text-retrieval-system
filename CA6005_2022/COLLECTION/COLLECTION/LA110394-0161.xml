   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : LOS ANGELES ; CITY_COUNCIL TAKES STAND AGAINST PROP . 184</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Los Angeles City_Council on Wednesday voted to oppose Prop . 184 , which would make_it difficult for Legislators to change the recently approved &quot; three strikes &quot; law . The council_members , voting 9-3 , said they are leery of amending the state Constitution to include the anti-crime law , which has been beset by problems . If voters approve the initiative , the Legislature can only change the statute , which significantly lengthens criminal sentences , by mustering a two-thirds vote . &quot; You need to be able to make changes , even if you support ' three strikes , ' &quot; said Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg . &quot; It puts the Constitution out of reach. &quot;</TEXT>
