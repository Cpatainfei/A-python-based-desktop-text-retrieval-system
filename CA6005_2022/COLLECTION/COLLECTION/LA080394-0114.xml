   <HEADLINE> GORE WOOS UKRAINE WITH PROMISES OF AID IN RETURN FOR DISARMAMENT STEPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wooing a new president to comply with the nuclear disarmament agreement signed by his predecessor , Vice_President Al Gore paid a six-hour call_on Kiev on Tuesday , bearing promises of U.S. aid if Ukraine continues to dismantle its nuclear_weapons . Gore also gave newly elected President Leonid Kuchma an invitation from President Clinton to visit Washington in November . The vice_president reiterated U.S. promises to give Ukraine up_to $ 700 million in aid this year to scrap its warheads and speed_up economic reforms . &quot; A democratic , prosperous and independent Ukraine is in America ' s national interests , &quot; Gore said . He was greeted with warm diplomatic smiles and hearty handshakes during the first high-level U.S. visit to Ukraine since Kuchma ' s July 19 inauguration . But both Ukrainian and Western officials warned that Kuchma ' s pro-Russian tilt , together with a new Parliament dominated by Communist hard-liners , could translate into a chillier , more demanding attitude on Kiev ' s part_with respect_to disarmament . &quot; You can already feel the change , &quot; said a Westerner closely involved in disarmament . &quot; They will demand performance , not promises. &quot; Gore pressed Ukraine , which has lagged behind nearly all its neighbors in introducing market reforms , to speed_up the process so that it could qualify for more_than $ 4 billion in aid from the Group of Seven industrialized nations . Gore said Ukraine is already the world ' s fourth-largest recipient of American aid . Kuchma has complained in the past that the aid amounts to &quot; beautiful words &quot; but no hard cash . He accepted the invitation to Washington on Nov . 29 but made no public statements after his meeting with Gore in the ornate 18th-Century Mariinsky Palace . Ukraine has removed the nuclear_warheads from about 200 missiles and shipped the warheads to Russia in exchange for 100 tons of nuclear fuel , in keeping with the trilateral nuclear statement signed_in January by the United States , Russia and Ukraine . The United States paid Russia $ 60 million to complete the deal . Gore praised Ukraine for its speedy fulfillment of its side of the agreement . Kuchma has criticized the United States for being slow in disbursing the disarmament aid . &quot; Does America keep its promises ? &quot; he asked a delegation from the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America days after his inauguration . Tougher rhetoric could signal trouble in implementing the rest of the trilateral agreement . Aside from the initial warhead-for-fuel swap , the pact does not specify how Ukraine is to get_rid_of its remaining 1 # 400 nuclear_warheads except to say they must be scrapped within seven years . It now seems likely that Ukraine will insist on receiving the money faster and demand more of it . Although Gore said that he did not discuss the subject with Kuchma , he stressed in remarks to journalists that Ukraine must join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a condition of the trilateral pact . Kuchma has said that he prefers to wait until 1995 , when the treaty comes_up for a legal overhaul . Perhaps more worrisome for Washington , however , is the possibility that Kuchma ' s pro-Russian rhetoric will find expression in policy , thus changing Moscow ' s attitude toward Ukraine ' s disarmament . Konstantin Zatulin , a key Russian lawmaker , told a popular Ukrainian newspaper on Friday that Russia would no longer press Ukraine to disarm &quot; if the two countries enter into a strategic partnership. &quot; A nuclear , allied Ukraine would give Russia &quot; another vote_in the nuclear club , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
