   <HEADLINE> GAO CITES CONTRACTORS ' EXPENSES AS QUESTIONABLE ; DEFENSE : TWO ORANGE COUNTY FIRMS ARE INCLUDED IN REPORT THAT ALLEGES OVERBILLING OF PENTAGON , INCLUDING FOR RESORT TRIPS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two Orange County defense companies allegedly billed the Pentagon for hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal or questionable expenses , including trips to exotic resorts for executives and spouses , alcoholic_beverages and unexplained consultant costs . Sparta Inc. in Laguna Hills and SRS Technologies in Newport Beach were two of eight military contractors whose government billing practices were audited by the General Accounting Office , an investigative arm of Congress . While the report does not publicly break_down the specific questionable expenses by company , a congressional source identified those incurred by the Orange County firms . Sparta allegedly sought government reimbursement for trips to the Caribbean , Mexico and Hawaii . The trips reportedly were taken_for annual management and business meetings . On a trip to Jamaica for which Sparta sought $ 102 # 000 in reimbursements , according to the congressional sources , the company sent 151 employees to Montego Bay to attend its annual shareholders meeting . The employees brought along 112 spouses or guests , but the report does not say whether their expenses were billed to the government . The company reportedly claimed the costs of meetings in resort areas as a form of incentive compensation . The GAO report questions whether the government &quot; should pay_for contractor employees to attend business meetings at resort locations. &quot; It does not specify whether the Pentagon had requested the return of any of the questioned expenses . Sparta is also accused of illegally billing the Pentagon for meals for spouses , alcoholic_beverages and for inadequately documented consultant fees , according a source familiar_with the audit . Officials at Sparta and SRS Technologies would not comment on the report Thursday evening and did not appear at a congressional hearing Thursday . Even after Sparta was notified in 1992 of the scrutiny by congressional investigators , a GAO analyst said , company officials billed the government for $ 229 # 000 for a trip to Hawaii . SRS Technologies is accused of illegally billing the government for the personal use of a company car , alcoholic_beverages , inadequately documented consultant costs and the company ' s legal costs in a lawsuit against the government . It also allegedly billed $ 44 # 000 for a trip that 40 employees and one consultant to the company took_to a Bermuda resort . The GAO said it considered this cost questionable but not forbidden by regulations . &quot; No , this is not Donald Trump ' s Visa bill , &quot; Sen . Jim Sasser ( D-Tenn. ) , chairman of the Senate Budget Committee , said in a statement . &quot; It ' s the tab the American taxpayers are picking_up for what defense_contractors euphemistically call ' overhead. ' &quot; Two GAO audits turned_up $ 4.9 million in questionable or illegal expenses . That amount was in addition to $ 4.4 million in_charges that the Pentagon ' s own contract watchdog agency had rejected .</TEXT>
