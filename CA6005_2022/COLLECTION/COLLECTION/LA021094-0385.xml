   <HEADLINE> THE 66TH ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS ; ANGLO-IRISH ACTORS ' YEAR FOR OSCAR NODS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The British film_industry may be virtually dead , but the United Kingdom certainly made its impact felt when the Oscar acting nominations were announced Wednesday . Half of the nominees for best actor or best supporting actor went_to individuals from Britain or Ireland . Nominated for their lead roles were Britain ' s Daniel Day-Lewis , who played the wrongly imprisoned Gerry Conlon in &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; ; Welshman Anthony Hopkins , who portrayed a repressed butler in &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; ; and Northern_Ireland native Liam Neeson , who adopted a German accent to play the unlikely industrialist-hero in &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; Two British subjects were recognized in the supporting role category : Ralph Fiennes for his portrayal of Nazi commandant Amon Goeth and Peter Postlethwaite , who played Conlon ' s father . On the female side , the_British influence was less pronounced , yet Emma Thompson was nominated in two categories for her work as a model housekeeper in &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; and as a fiery lawyer in &quot; In the Name of the Father. &quot; Anna Paquin , from the Commonwealth nation of New Zealand , was nominated for her role in &quot; The Piano &quot; as the 10-year-old who serves as her mute mother ' s mouthpiece . Day-Lewis , Hopkins and Thompson are all previous Oscar winners . What ' s going_on ? Speaking from his native Ireland , Jim Sheridan , a nominee himself in the directing category for &quot; In the Name of the Father , &quot; said the choices were a good reflection of the academy ' s open-mindedness . He also attributed some of the actors ' success to the material they were given . Ismail Merchant , producer of &quot; The Remains of the Day , &quot; said theater training is the key to getting an acting nomination . &quot; English actors have an extraordinary theater training , &quot; he said . &quot; British actors are very disciplined . They have a profound knowledge of the characters they are playing and exceptional acting ability. &quot;</TEXT>
