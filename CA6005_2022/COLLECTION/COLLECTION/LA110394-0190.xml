   <HEADLINE> JIM MURRAY : HE FACES TOUGH FOE -- OLD_AGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Old_age is a state_of_mind , not body . You ' re only as old as you feel . Age is only a number . If you didn ' t know how old you were , how old would you be ? Age cannot wither nor custom stale . Age , thou art shamed ! And so on . Take every cliche about aging and George Foreman has the answer . George is a surrogate for every guy whose wife ever said , &quot; Don ' t lift that ! You ' ll hurt yourself ! &quot; For every guy to whom a young kid ever said , &quot; Hey , Pops , got a light ? &quot; Every guy who forgot where he put the keys , paid senior rates at the movies , noticed that his knees hurt when it was going_to rain and wonders why all that hair is coming_out in his comb and it ' s gray . Every guy who looks in the mirror and an old stranger stares back at him . Every man who looks_at the calendar and wonders how it got_to be 1994 . I mean , what happened to the ' 80s ? George is going_to climb into the ring in Las Vegas and fight for the heavyweight championship of the world for all_of us Saturday and we ' re all 25 years younger for a day . I don ' t know about you , but if he wins I may get a gold necklace , grow a ponytail and go without stockings . Maybe even get an earring . I remember the first time I ever saw George Foreman . It was in 1968 in Mexico_City . The Olympic boxing finals . George had just manhandled some poor clumsy Russian with a pole-ax left and a paving-block right so badly the ref knew he had to call the fight or call the morgue . I remember seeing the fight through a chicken-wire fence , erected because the local crowd might be tempted to pelt the ring with live chickens or live snakes or heavy coins when a local favorite lost . It had been a troubled Olympics . First of all , in the weeks before it took_place , the International Olympic Committee , disturbed by student unrest and opposition to the Games , had weighed transferring them out of Mexico . This was obviated when the government militia opened_fire on a student demonstration in the Plaza of the Three Cultures , leaving dozens of the dissidents slain . Then , the American 200-meter medalists , Tommie Smith and John Carlos , had used the platform of the award ceremony to raise gloved black fists to protest racism in America , signaling to the world what a great place the Olympics were to get a political message across . So , the IOC was jittery , reeling , that night when George Foreman reached down behind him after the fight to pick_up a miniature American flag . They feared the worst . I remember someone gasping , &quot; My God , he ' s going_to burn it ! &quot; Not George . He was going_to kiss it . And wave it . Then , he gave a dozen roses to his fallen opponent . George became everybody ' s hero . He came_home America ' s champion . He launched his pro career to ringing cheers and well-wishes . But that was 26 years ago . Nixon was still to be elected President . Coffee was a quarter , gas 40 cents . You could get a Cadillac for seven grand . Russia was an &quot; evil empire &quot; and we hadn ' t even been to the moon yet . Jimmy Ellis was heavyweight champion of the world . &quot; Oliver ! &quot; won the Academy Award . Cliff Robertson was best actor . And if anyone had suggested that George Foreman would be climbing into the ring 26 years later to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world , in November of 1994 , people would have begun edging away from him . It was about as likely as Russia turning capitalist . To everyone but George . You can play golf as long as you can stand_up . You can play tennis with bifocals . You can play baseball till you ' re 40-something . Football and basketball come_to a stop in the mid-30s . But bleeding for a living , getting hit in a helmetless head , is something few people can do into their dotage . Dempsey fought for 14 years , Joe Louis for 17 . Archie Moore fought for 27 years and was 43 when he stepped into the ring to fight for the heavyweight championship against Floyd Patterson in 1956 . If you can believe the old record books , Jack Johnson fought for 31 years and was 50 when he had his last fight . But he was a mere 37 when he got his last title fight . George ignores the actuarial_tables . &quot; Numbers , &quot; George says reproachfully . &quot; People live their lives by numbers . They say , ' Oh , I ' m 80 ! I better go_off somewhere and die. ' Numbers are for accountants. &quot; George once lived_by the numbers . Embittered and disillusioned by his knockout by Muhammad Ali in Africa in 1974 , he retired for almost 10 years and turned_to preaching the word_of_God . But ministry is expensive . One day , George happened to catch some fights on TV . He was surprised to find how unskilled the game had become , how carelessly the modern fighters were exposed . &quot; Then , I thought , ' Hey , you ' re old ! You can ' t be doing that ! ' &quot; George recalls . &quot; Then , I thought , ' Wait a minute ! Who says so ? Just a number. ' We say , ' Well , I can ' t do that . I ' m 50 ! ' Or , ' I better not try that , I ' m 60 ! ' We ' re slaves to numbers. &quot; George looked_at the numbers and divided by two . George had reason to feel young . George had never abused his body -- with anything except double cheeseburgers with fries , pizza with everything , sno cones and banana_splits . George didn ' t drink , smoke , chew or swear and he mostly heeded the advice of that other noted senior , Satchel Paige , who had once observed , &quot; The social ramble ain ' t restful. &quot; Still , George had some difficulty convincing the world that he was ready to leave the rocking chair . &quot; I needed a sponsor , &quot; he says . &quot; So I called_up about 10 of them and I said , ' I want to make a comeback but I need $ 700 # 000 . For that , I will give you 40 % of the purses. ' They all hung_up on me . They thought it was a con . But George Foreman don ' t con . Now , if they stayed_on the line and took that option , they would have gotten 40 % of $ 60 million today. &quot; George , unlike the venerable Paige , knew how old he was . Satch , when asked how old he was , used to stall . &quot; People says different things , &quot; he would answer , &quot; but I would judge between 30 and 70. &quot; George could give them an honest count -- 40 . Unsponsored , he fought his way back to the top . When he got his title shot against Evander Holyfield , he was a boyish 43 . Holyfield thought it would be a walk in the park . It was . Central_Park . At 2 a.m. Wearing a Rolex . When the fight ended , Holyfield was looking frantically up at the clock and wondering , &quot; Where ' s that damn bell ? &quot; George had to go_to court to get his title shot Saturday at Michael Moorer . Some say it should have been the other way round . Still , it ' s a nice fight for Moorer . He ' s getting_to fight a man old enough to be his father . And if he fought the other heavyweight champ , Oliver McCall , the public would n ' t know one from the other . The public will know George in the fight at the MGM Grand . Every guy in the country with a hearing_aid , bifocals , a cane or a walker , stomach gas or store teeth will be in his corner . &quot; I ' m fighting for every guy who ever got told to ' act your age , ' &quot; George says . Every guy who got a gold watch , a set of luggage . Every guy who wonders why people don ' t speak_up anymore or why print is smaller these days . Every guy who wonders if it was always this chilly in the mornings and what he did with his keys . George is our champion . If George wins , his victory will not be over Michael Moorer . It ' ll be over that ancient foe of mankind -- old_age . Who is undefeated .</TEXT>
