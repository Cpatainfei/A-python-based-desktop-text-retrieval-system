   <HEADLINE> THE TIMES POLL ; BROWN LEADS DEMOCRATS AS TROUBLES PLAGUE WILSON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the primary_election for governor less than two weeks off , Kathleen Brown is maintaining a comfortable lead over her Democratic rivals , according to the Los Angeles Times Poll , while Republican Gov . Pete Wilson continues to wallow in troubled political waters . State_Treasurer Brown held a 17-point lead over her nearest contender , Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi , among the 662 registered Democrats interviewed . That gap -- just about the same as it was in late March -- narrowed to 12 points when limited to those Democrats who said they were likely to vote_in the June 7 primary . The poll indicated that many Democrats were not unalterably committed to their candidate at this point and might reconsider their choice . But those who favored Garamendi appeared just as likely as Brown supporters to change their minds . The third Democratic candidate , state Sen . Tom Hayden , trailed at 10 % , but there were hints that Hayden may have gotten a boost from his performance in the three Democratic gubernatorial debates held Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday -- while the poll was under way . The poll was conducted Saturday through Wednesday . In incomplete samples during the final two days of polling , his numbers rose to the mid-teens . His standing now could be higher than the poll numbers suggest , Times Poll Director John Brennan said . Otherwise , there appeared to be no dramatic reshuffling of the race as a result of the debates , he said . April and May -- the period since the previous Times poll -- are generally the months in which people begin to tune_in to a primary_election campaign in California ; candidates launch advertising drives and they begin campaigning more vigorously . All those things occurred in the governor ' s contest this spring , but seemed to have little impact on the balance of the race . The only thing that appeared to cause a significant shift in support for candidates was heavy television advertising by two wealthy Republicans who had been virtually unknown statewide . Senate candidate Michael Huffington and gubernatorial hopeful Ron Unz boosted their standings significantly by pouring millions of dollars into television advertising . The poll found that a boost in optimism about the California economy in the early months of 1994 has leveled_off , as did Wilson ' s job approval rating . From a low point of 28 % in the autumn of 1992 , following that summer ' s protracted budget stalemate , Wilson ' s job rating made a slow climb back to 39 % in March . It is now at 38 % , basically unchanged . Last fall , more_than half the Californians polled believed that the state was mired in a serious recession . The number dropped significantly in March to 35 % . This week the figure remained virtually unchanged at 34 % . Only one in four thought that things in California generally were going_in the right direction . Nearly two-thirds said they thought that California was_on the wrong track . &quot; that ' s just terrible news for an incumbent , &quot; Brennan said . At this point , Wilson does not seem to face a serious threat to winning the Republican nomination for a second term over his surprise Republican challenger , Unz , a Silicon_Valley entrepreneur . Unz got the support of 29 % of 542 registered Republicans to Wilson ' s 52 % . Among likely voters , the spread was 57 % for Wilson and 31 % for Unz . The relatively large Unz vote shows that disaffection with Wilson extends_to the Republican core . Unz was not included in the late March poll because he did not formally announce for governor until after that survey was taken . The Unz campaign said that its own polls gave him about 10 % of the GOP support at the time . But the governor trailed Democrats Brown and Garamendi by double_digits in hypothetical matchups in a November general_election . Brennan said : &quot; The governor faces the daunting political challenge of seeking reelection in a time of continuing pessimism and at time when improvements in the consumer outlook appear to have stalled. &quot; In California ' s U.S. Senate_race , first-term Rep . Huffington of Santa Barbara moved ahead of former Rep . William E . Dannemeyer for the Republican nomination after spending at least $ 4 million of_his_own money on television advertising , most of it attacking the Democratic incumbent , Sen . Dianne Feinstein . Huffington ' s support more_than doubled during the period . Among all registered Republicans , Huffington led Dannemeyer 27 % to 18 % , with a third candidate , Kate Squires , getting 10 % . Huffington ' s lead over Dannemeyer was larger , 35 % to 21 % , among most likely voters , but a third of the Republicans still had not decided how they would vote . Huffington ' s ad_campaign also appeared to have had an effect on Feinstein , who has no major opposition in the Democratic primary and did not run any television ads . Although she scored some significant and highly publicized Senate victories in Washington during the period , her approval rating among all 1 # 984 adults polled dropped from 52 % to 47 % . Feinstein led Huffington 52 % to 38 % and Dannemeyer 53 % to 35 % in a hypothetical matchup among all 1 # 471 registered voters . The poll found four overriding issues for the California electorate : crime , the economy , education and illegal immigration . In the race for governor , Wilson outscores his opponents for his positions on two issues he has emphasized for nearly a year , crime and immigration . Wilson , who says the California economy is coming_back , and Brown , who has criticized the governor for his management of the state during the recession , are roughly equal in getting support for their stands on the economy . The one area in which Brown has a substantial edge is in education , which Brennan said has the potential of being &quot; the sleeper issue &quot; in California this year . In the race for governor , the poll results generally indicate that Garamendi has slightly broader appeal throughout the electorate than Brown . Garamendi has greater appeal among Republicans and outscores Wilson in a hypothetical matchup by 14 points . Brown edges Wilson by 10 . Garamendi gets favorable ratings from a remarkable number of Republicans , 41 % to 19 % . But Brown enjoys greater popularity among Democrats , who will be choosing the party nominee June 7 . Brown is viewed favorably by 66 % of Democrats polled and unfavorably by only 15 % . &quot; Among the group ( of Democrats ) that likes both Brown and Garamendi , she continues to run ahead comfortably , &quot; Brennan said . Garamendi does somewhat better against Brown among Democrats who are mostly likely to vote largely because he enjoys greater popularity among older people , who tend to be the most faithful voters . Brown is particularly strong with voters who consider themselves liberal , scores well in the major urban_centers of Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area and with minority voters . Among various Democratic groups , Garamendi outscores Brown only among the relatively small segment of conservative Democratic voters . Family background and her record in office figure strongly in determining why voters like or dislike Brown . Fifteen percent of those who like her do so because of her family ties . Her father and brother were governors of California . Nineteen percent like Brown because of her record . Among those who dislike Brown , 26 % said it was because of her family background . Among Democrats who said they do not like Brown , 14 % said the reason was her position on the death_penalty . Brown personally opposes the death_penalty although she insists that she would enforce the state ' s capital_punishment law just as vigorously as Garamendi or Wilson , both strong supporters of the death_penalty . Among voters who like Garamendi , 42 % said it was because of his record as the state ' s first elected insurance commissioner . Among voters who did not like Garamendi , 44 % said it was his record as commissioner . Wilson ' s favorable ratings have dropped slightly since March . Forty-three percent say they like the governor and 52 % said they do not . When asked to volunteer reasons for liking Wilson , the most-frequently mentioned were because he is trying to do a good job ( 19 % ) , his stands on illegal immigration ( 19 % ) , and because of a feeling he gets things done ( 10 % ) . Those who do not like Wilson say he is ineffective ( 14 % ) , a weak leader ( 10 % ) , cite the recession ( 12 % ) , or cite his cuts_in public education budgets ( 13 % ) . How the Poll Was Conducted The Times Poll interviewed 1 # 984 California adults , by telephone , from May 21 through 25 . The sample includes 1 # 471 registered voters , 662 of whom are Democrats and 542 Republicans . Of those groups , 326 are likely Democratic voters and 268 likely Republican voters . Telephone_numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the state . Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers could be contacted . Interviewing was conducted in English and Spanish . The sample is weighted slightly to conform with census figures for sex , race , age and education . The margin of sampling error for the total adult and registered voter samples is plus or minus 3 percentage_points . For all registered Democrats and Republicans it is 4 and 5 points , respectively ; for likely Democratic and Republicans voters it is 6 and 7 points , respectively . For certain other subgroups the error margin will vary . Poll results can also be affected by other factors such_as question wording and the order in which questions are presented .
