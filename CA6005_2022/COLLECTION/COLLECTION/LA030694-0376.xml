   <HEADLINE> ' CONSERVATIVE SUMMIT ' DENOUNCES BUSH , MUCH OF GOP ; POLITICS : PARTICIPANTS REVEAL SIGNIFICANT DIVISIONS WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN_PARTY ON KEY ISSUES RANGING FROM HEALTH_CARE TO IMMIGRATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a sign of continued division within GOP ranks , it wasn ' t the Democrat currently residing in the White_House who drew most of the fire Saturday at a conference of conservative activists -- it was his Republican predecessor . Speakers at the &quot; Conservative Summit &quot; convened by National Review magazine disparaged George_Bush , lashed the GOP congressional leadership for &quot; failure of nerve &quot; and indicted party moderates as traitors . Along the way , participants bared significant divisions within the party on such key issues as trade , foreign_policy , health_care and immigration . At times , the assessment of the GOP ' s condition sounded as if it were lifted from a Democratic National Committee_meeting . &quot; The GOP , in my view , approaches the midterm election as a party without a clear philosophy , &quot; warned former GOP presidential candidate Pierre S . ( Pete ) du Pont IV , now chairman of the conservative magazine ' s National Review Institute . Conservatives , added pollster Tony Fabrizio , &quot; are making a big mistake if we look_to the Republican_Party for leadership. &quot; Less surprising , President Clinton also took his lumps at the gathering -- on foreign_policy , economics , health_care and social issues . One speaker accused him of espousing a &quot; mushy multilateralism &quot; in foreign affairs ; another said that on civil_rights a &quot; quota mentality ( is ) running rampant in the Administration. &quot; William Kristol , chairman of the Project for the Republican Future and an advocate of uncompromising GOP opposition to Clinton ' s health_care reform package , pronounced the Administration ' s health_care initiative virtually dead . &quot; It was supposed to be the poster child of his Administration , and it ' s become a tar baby , &quot; he said . But the attacks on Clinton paled against the intensity of the recriminations against Bush , who was accused of squandering the political legacy bequeathed to the GOP by Ronald Reagan . Du Pont set the tone with his conference-opening remarks , lamenting &quot; the Republican catastrophe of 1990-92 , when a Republican Administration enacted the Democratic Party platform. &quot; Bush doomed the GOP , he said , by accepting higher taxes and signing civil_rights legislation that was virtually identical to an earlier version he vetoed as a &quot; quota bill. &quot; &quot; The Republican_Party paid a terrible price for this deviation , &quot; Du Pont said . The conservative broadsides at Bush ' s legacy represent more_than mere disappointment over the loss of the White_House after 12 years . They also constitute another salvo in an ongoing GOP struggle over the party ' s response to Clinton . Since 1992 , some GOP moderates have argued that Bush failed because he leaned too far to the right , particularly on social issues . The conservatives hope to blunt that argument by contending that Bush lost because he failed to adhere to Reaganite principles . As Kristol put it : &quot; It is important to get history right if we are going_to get the future right. &quot; Indeed , congressional Republicans drew almost as much fire as Bush or Clinton . Repeatedly , speakers ridiculed the GOP congressional leadership for allowing the President to seize the initiative on such key issues as crime and welfare reform . &quot; To the extent he has co-opted some Republican themes , it is an indictment of Republicans for not making our case seriously enough , &quot; Kristol said . A particular target was Sen . John H . Chafee ( R-R.I. ) , who has authored the most moderate of the GOP alternatives to Clinton ' s health_care reform package . &quot; The party is really in a sad state of affairs when we have to depend_on John Chafee to be our moral leader on health_care , &quot; Fabrizio said . But if those attending the gathering were united in their denunciation of the Republican moderate strain represented by Bush and Chafee , they also displayed significant divisions over the future course of the conservative movement . At one session , Elliott Abrams , an assistant secretary_of_state in the Reagan_Administration , clashed with Angela ( Bay ) Buchanan , who managed her brother Patrick J . Buchanan ' s 1992 presidential bid . Abrams insisted that Patrick Buchanan , Ross Perot and other conservative critics of free_trade and active U.S. involvement abroad display an &quot; attitude of fear or lack of confidence &quot; about America ' s economic and diplomatic capacities . Bay Buchanan fired back : &quot; Protectionism isn ' t all bad if it is in the interest of American jobs , American interests , American industry. &quot; After another session , Ralph E . Reed Jr. , executive_director of broadcaster Pat Robertson ' s Christian Coalition , raised a warning flag about Patrick Buchanan and other GOP leaders advocating an ever-toughening position against immigration . Emphasizing that his organization had not yet taken a position on the issue , Reed said the offensive against immigration risked driving millions of new arrivals into Democratic ranks . &quot; If the Republican_Party moves toward a nativist impulse and becomes perceived as a party that wants to build a wall around America . . . , they could find themselves in the same political situation they were in with the immigrants of Eastern and Southern Europe , &quot; he said . Those Europeans , he noted , became a cornerstone of the Democratic New Deal political coalition . Although the conference did reaffirm conservative consensus on several large issues -- particularly opposition to new taxes and a commitment to social issues such_as banning abortion -- the proceedings provided ample evidence for Bay Buchanan ' s summation : &quot; As conservatives , we are spread all_over . It is time to stop this notion that we will all get together. &quot;</TEXT>
