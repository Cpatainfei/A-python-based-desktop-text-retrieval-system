   <HEADLINE> SPORTS ; ONE SWELL TIME ; WATER_SKI RACE TO CATALINA PROVIDES PLENTY OF THRILLS -- AND SPILLS -- FOR COMPETITORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s a $ 220 entry fee , no prize_money and the winner doesn ' t even get_to keep the perpetual trophy . But that hasn ' t deterred competitors throughout the world from from flocking to the annual Catalina Ski_Race , a 62-mile round-trip water_ski race from Long_Beach Harbor to Catalina Island and back . The 46th running of the event Sunday drew a record 140 teams from the United States , Australia , England , Canada , South_Africa , New Zealand , Belgium and Italy . The number of competitors , which range_in age from 8 to 69 , at this year ' s race forced organizers to start the race in two groups for the first time . About 110 teams started at the firing of a flare gun in a 1 1 / 2-mile stretch between Island White and Island Grisham in Long_Beach Harbor , fighting for position to exit the channel at the narrow Queen ' s Gate breakwater less than a mile away . A second stampede start followed 15 minutes later . Choppy waters prevented Mason Thompson ' s 1987 record of 54 minutes 56 seconds from being challenged , but Sunday ' s race marked the first time foreign competitors won the men ' s and women ' s races in the same year . Darren Kirkland , a 27-year-old carpenter from London who had finished second in three previous Catalina races , held_on for a 22-second victory over Kurt Schoen of Huntington Beach in 59:20 . Australian Leanne Braun , 21 , the 1993 world champion , racing for the first time in open waters , won the women ' s division in 1:10.03. Defending men ' s champion Lee Squier , 40 , of Long_Beach was the top local finisher , placing fourth in 1:03.55. &quot; Everyone in the skiing fraternity around the world knows the big races to go_to and Catalina is one of them , &quot; said Braun , a law_student from Perth . The race is also one of the toughest . The top skiers , using only a single , specially designed ski , can exceed 80 miles per hour . Braun aggravated tendinitis in her right knee during the race but was not the only one limping to the awards ceremony . Swells , which reached 15 to 20 feet Sunday , caused skiers to lose sight of their boats some 200 feet ahead . Gauging distance in open water is another unique challenge of the Catalina race . &quot; In Sydney , we race on lakes and rivers , but the closest thing we get_to this is a bay , &quot; Braun said . &quot; On the way back , I didn ' t know where anyone was , I didn ' t know whether I was winning or losing or what was going_on . All I wanted to see was the big white ( Spruce Goose ) dome. &quot; Skiers are aided by a support team , which includes a driver , navigator and observer , but plotting a direct course to Catalina and back is not an easy task either . It was sunny and visibility was good Sunday , but that didn ' t keep boats from veering several miles off course . &quot; If there is a real heavy cloud_bank and a thick marine layer , I ' ve been way back and seen the leaders get lost , &quot; said Kirk Book , 30 , of Carlsbad . &quot; They ' re so busy heading side_by_side , the guy who is leading heads_off to San Pedro and everybody follows him . All of a sudden , you ' re by yourself heading to the right opening. &quot; Book has led the Catalina race at some point since he first competed in the event at age 14 . But the 1993 world champion and four-time U.S. champion has yet to cross the finish_line first . He was challenging for the lead at the turnaround boat about a quarter_mile off Avalon , but finished third in 1:02:30 after taking a spill with about 19 miles to go . Book , who has been first to the island three times and finished second three times in 10 previous Catalina races , was leading last year when he took a spill and was knocked unconscious about halfway back to Long_Beach . &quot; This is the biggest ocean race in the U.S. and I ' ve won everything but this race , &quot; said Book , who competed with a brace to protect a hyper-extended knee suffered two weeks ago when he was thrown about 150 feet out of a boat traveling at 100 miles per hour . &quot; The top skiers don ' t refer to the things they won , they refer to the things they haven ' t won and this is the one I haven ' t. &quot; Finishing is a goal for others . One-hundred-one of the 140 teams completed the race in the allotted three hours . Mark Kachigan , a 38-year-old real_estate_broker from Long_Beach , dropped_out five miles after the turnaround because of the &quot; worst leg cramps &quot; of his life . Kachigan , a marathon_runner who has been a recreational water skier for 18 years , decided to try the race after watching the event every year for nearly a decade . &quot; If I could run_for 3 1 / 2 hours and run 26 miles , I didn ' t think it would be a problem being_on a ski for 1 1 / 2 to two hours , &quot; Kachigan said . &quot; You can see the island about a third of the way on the way_out , but it seemed like an eternity before you ' re there . I guess I thought I was a legend in my own mind. &quot; Any illusions of grandeur were quickly extinguished after Kachigan fell three times on the way to Catalina , the last of which he attributes to simply fatigue . &quot; I just wanted to make_it to the island , &quot; Kachigan said . &quot; My thighs were_on fire . I was in tears when I knew wasn ' t going_to finish and swore I would never do the Catalina race again . But the next day , I ' ll be mad about not finishing . And the day after that , I ' ll be thinking_of ways to do_better in next year ' s race. &quot;</TEXT>
