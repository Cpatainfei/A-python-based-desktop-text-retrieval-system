   <HEADLINE> CHINA STEPS UP ENFORCEMENT OF PIRACY LAWS ; TRADE : JURIST TELLS U.S. THAT COURTS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT CLEANING_UP PATENT AND TRADEMARK ABUSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stung by criticism that it permits thefts of intellectual property and other copyright infringement , the Chinese government has mounted a campaign to assure its foreign trading partners that it is serious about cleaning_up abuses . Patent and trademark laws are relatively new in China , but have been improving over time , Fei Zongyi , a justice of China ' s highest_court , said in Los Angeles recently . &quot; Compared to other countries , our legal_system has developed very fast . We ' ve demonstrated that China has made tremendous progress , &quot; said Fei , who was touring U.S. cities to explain his court ' s plans for legal enforcement to industry representatives concerned about the problem . In an interview , the justice said he is now involved in drafting new contract , property , and arbitration laws . Such laws will help companies to enforce their contracts and seek remedies for violations , he said . Under the proposed laws , copyright violators could face criminal penalties for the first time . In another measure designed to provide assurances that it is serious about eliminating violations , the government also said recently that it would sponsor seminars in China to inform business people and others about copyright laws now in_effect . &quot; Since last year , the emphasis is to let the public know the law , understand the law and follow the law , &quot; Fei said . As part of continuing efforts to strengthen the law , the government last year extended copyright laws covering company products to trademarks owned by service_industries . At the same time , the government extended patent protection to chemical and pharmaceutical products and has extended the life of patents to 20 years , from 12 years . Although business_executives who met with Fei said they were impressed by his willingness to come_to the United States and explain Chinese policies , many said that China is still a long way from solving the problem of piracy . &quot; It ' s productive to have these meetings to let people know it ' s a serious problem , but you can ' t stop counterfeiting completely , &quot; said Howard C . Lincoln , chairman of Nintendo of America Inc. Lincoln said Nintendo , the Redmond , Wash.-based subsidiary of the Japanese video_game concern , lost more_than $ 1 million last year because of piracy by state-owned or state-financed business in China , which distributed pirated Nintendo video_games in China and around the world . Nintendo isn ' t alone . Last year , U.S. businesses lost about $ 827 million because of piracy in China , according to the International Intellectual Property Alliance in Washington . Industries affected include computer software , music recordings , motion_pictures and books . The problem , industry officials said , lies_in the enforcement of the laws . &quot; The penalty for piracy is rather insignificant . It ' s not a deterrent ; there ' s practically no enforcement , &quot; said Jonas Rosenfield , president of the American Film Marketing Assn. , a trade organization that represents about 110 independent film companies worldwide . The intellectual property alliance estimated that the motion_picture industry lost about $ 50 million last year because of piracy in China . Many of the losses can be traced to a notorious factory in Shenzhen , an industrial Chinese city , which makes pirated laser discs with films from the United States , film_industry officials said . But the industry taking perhaps the biggest loss in China is computer software . Infringement cost the industry about about $ 322 million last year , according to the intellectual property alliance . The problem , said Kenji Eigner , director of Asia Pacific sales at Rexon Inc. , is that a pirate with one copy of software can duplicate as_many as he wishes with no fear of retribution . Despite success in computer_hardware sales in China , Rexon , a Simi Valley-based manufacturer of personal_computer accessories and software , said it has been reluctant to risk losses from piracy by introducing software in China . Copyright protection is &quot; the foundation for the entire software industry , &quot; said Brian McEachron , a senior corporate attorney for Microsoft Inc. who also met last week with Fei . Despite Fei ' s assurance of legal enforcement , many U.S. representative said they are still skeptical about taking legal_actions in Chinese courts . Fei acknowledged that China does not have a discovery process to uncover records from parties in a lawsuit . While he maintained that the lack of discovery is a benefit toward quickly resolving disputes , American executives say that without discovery , it ' s often difficult to prove a claim . In addition , the Americans say , Chinese enforcement is weak because of the often minimal compensation to victims . When a Chinese company was caught illegally using the Walt Disney Co. ' s Mickey_Mouse trademark character , it was only fined $ 91 . That figure would have been a_hundred times more here , said Peter Nolan , Disney vice_president and general counsel . &quot; We ' ve tried through court actions , and the remedies we ' re getting from the judicial_system ( are ) pitiful , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
