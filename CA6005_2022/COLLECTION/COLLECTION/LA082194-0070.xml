   <HEADLINE> PRIVATE LIVES ; VIDEODROME ; AT_HOME , THE FEAST NEED NEVER END ; LIKE ' WATER FOR CHOCOLATE ' ? LOVE ' WEDDINGS ' ? THEN CHECK_OUT THESE SIMILAR -- AND OFTEN SUPERIOR -- FILMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the cardinal rules of moviegoing is that if you skip a meal to go_to a screening , you will invariably be tor tured by a great big stomach-gurgling eating scene . So the arrival of &quot; Like Water for Chocolate &quot; in the video stores this week is particularly good news : It means it is possible to view the film and not worry about getting unquenchably hungry . Now you can watch it at_home and eat a great meal at_the_same_time . The easy availability of fare more fascinating than killer popcorn and Goobers may actually make the movie seem better . Or perhaps it works the other way around . The other art-house-meets-the-multiplex hit out on video this week is &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral. &quot; Romance with a British accent has always bowled_over American audiences . What made this one click with couples is the buffoonish charm mixed in with all_the pip-pip witticisms -- it ' s a tuxedo with baggy pants . If you play these two out and feel the need for more of same , only different , there are some amenable -- yea , better -- choices gathering electrostatic dust in the video bins . For Likewaterforchocoholics , you might try : BABETTE ' S FEAST : When this 1987 best foreign-language film Academy Award winner came_out , a local hoity-toity French restaurant ( since closed ) offered_up its pricey version of the film ' s feast , complete with pigeon en croute and turtle_soup . The source material was a short_story by Isak ( &quot; Out of Africa &quot; ) Dinesen -- originally published in the Ladies Home Journal ! -- and it culminates in a glutinous array of lovingly lit cuisine that would make a hunger-striker renounce all principle . Food never seemed so sensual . ( Up until that point , the film is all Danish village winterscapes and pious repressed sufferers ! ) TAMPOPO : The Citizen Kane of food movies . This 1987 Japanese comedy has oodles of noodles . It features a widow trying to keep her noodle shop and a deadpan cowboy trucker who wants to help_out . It ' s farcical and sexy -- a rare combo . Food in this film isn ' t just a stand-in for sex . . . it is sex . Best scene : A gangster and his moll exchange pleasantries by rolling an egg_yolk back and forth between their open mouths . When it breaks , it ' s pure consummation . MONTY PYTHON ' S THE MEANING OF LIFE : Multipart Python madness . The episode featuring the world ' s most obese man is the greatest cautionary tale in the history of food-on-film . As each sumptuous dish is placed before him , and gobbled , a horrible feeling sets_in . This is , after all , Monty Python -- it can only come_to a bad end . And it does . An after-dinner mint becomes the catalyst for a cornucopia of digested goodies . WARNING : Unlike the other films mentioned above , &quot; The Meaning of Life &quot; should be viewed on an empty stomach . If you like the wit in &quot; Four Weddings , &quot; the same screenwriter , Richard Curtis , wrote a much funnier film back in 1989 : THE TALL GUY : Starring Jeff Goldblum as an expatriate American actor in London , it sends up everything from Benny Hill-style low_comedy to Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals . Emma Thompson plays the tart nurse who gives Goldblum his hay-fever shots , and Rowan Atkinson , who plays the verbally challenged priest in &quot; Four Weddings , &quot; plays a hyperobnoxious comic . Goldblum is a marvel here -- he keeps working himself into a series of neuromuscular amazements . And the Lloyd Webber take-off is a musical version of &quot; The Elephant Man &quot; titled &quot; Elephant ! &quot; As a satire of the musical_theater , the &quot; Elephant ! &quot; sequences rival Mel Brooks ' &quot; Springtime for Hitler &quot; numbers in &quot; The Producers. &quot; GROUNDHOG_DAY : Since everyone compared the time-loop premise of &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral &quot; to &quot; Groundhog_Day , &quot; why not go_to the source ? In &quot; Four Weddings , &quot; Hugh Grant plays a gent who is forever late to weddings ; each bout of recurrent lateness registers like a replay of the one before . In &quot; Groundhog_Day , &quot; Bill Murray plays a newscaster whose day -- Groundhog_Day -- inexplicably repeats itself every sunrise . And both films feature Andie MacDowell as paramour . She ' s pretty ga-ga in both but this is one of Murray ' s best . PETER ' S FRIENDS : Kenneth Branagh directed this bawdy , convivial Brit house_party , and stars in it with -- guess who ? -- Emma Thompson . Rita Rudner , who scripted , also turns_up . It ' s a bit too Neil Simon-ized and cloying , but it scores off the upper-crust roustabouts in a way that sometimes prompts heavy giggles . Don ' t watch for Andie MacDowell . She ' s not here .</TEXT>
