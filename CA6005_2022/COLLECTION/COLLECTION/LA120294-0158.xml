   <TEXT> An elegant holiday setting , a glitzy fashion show and a Christmas theme -- it ' s a winning formula that has worked for the South County Community Clinic Auxiliary for 10 years . Tuesday , the auxiliary ' s 10th anniversary luncheon and fashion show drew a sellout crowd of 650 to the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point . The $ 65-per-person luncheon included a fashion show featuring the latest looks from stores at South Coast Plaza , Costa Mesa . Net proceeds were expected to exceed $ 65 # 000 and will go_to the San Juan Capistrano-based clinic , which provides health_care to needy families of south Orange County . Wings of Desire &quot; We always seem to come_back to angels and fairies , &quot; said Thyra Decker , a committee_member , explaining this year ' s theme , &quot; A Christmas Fantasy. &quot; Organizers traditionally hold their luncheon in early December , when the hotel is decked_out in lights and ribbons for the holidays . Guests , most of them women dressed in their holiday best , first crowded into the courtyard to see the holiday vignettes created by auxiliary members . They entered a drawing to see who would walk home with one of the six vignettes , each stocked with all kinds of decorations and gifts and valued at around $ 3 # 500 . One scene , &quot; Culinary Corner , &quot; offered assorted kitchen wares such_as a bread-making machine , coffee_maker , knife set and wine rack . &quot; It ' s a Small World &quot; overflowed with toys . The &quot; Christmas Fantasy &quot; vignette featured a traditional holiday scene with a decorated tree surrounded by gifts , including a Victorian doll , crystal candlesticks and a floral pillow . &quot; All of the presents are wrapped . You don ' t have to do anything , &quot; said Gaye Birtcher , founder of the auxiliary who worked_on the vignette . &quot; You just need to put people ' s names on the tags and you ' re done -- that ' s my Christmas fantasy. &quot; Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies Anne Crawford , event chairwoman , said the luncheon was a sellout ( more_than 100 people had to be turned_away ) because &quot; people remember the show and the vignettes. &quot; Next the crowd moved_into the ballroom , where tables were illuminated by tiny glowing Christmas_trees topped with Tinkerbell ornaments . There , guests were served chicken_breast with pistachio lemon crust and candied ginger carrot cake . After lunch the lights dimmed , and all eyes turned_to the stage , where a gigantic gift box opened_to reveal sugar plum fairies dressed in white who danced down the runway . They were followed by models sporting holiday and cruise wear from Calvin Klein , Barneys New York , Emporio Armani and a half-dozen other South Coast Plaza retailers . Models were occasionally joined by men in tuxedos bearing red roses for women in the audience . Since its inception , the auxiliary has raised more_than $ 1.2 million for the clinic . The clinic recently added a Mobile Medical Van , custom-designed to provide easy access to health_care for South County residents . Others in the crowd were : Linda Berkshire , auxiliary president ; Zara Cerni and Beth Carney , event co-chairwomen ; Margot Hughes-Lopez , executive_director of the clinic ; Monica Bergquist , Eileen Dombrow , Lois McFarlan , Cynthia Pagano , Anita Houston , Barbara Naud , Juin Foresman , Melba Roelen , Ruth Rothwell , Electa Anderson , Diane Shaber , Mame Mertes , Eunice Parker , Cindy Boragno , Billur Wallerich , Thomas and Carolyn Bent , Ninetta Herbert and Diane Robinson .
