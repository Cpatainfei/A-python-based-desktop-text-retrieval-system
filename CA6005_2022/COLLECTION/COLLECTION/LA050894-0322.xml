   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; THE LONG MARCH OF ENDESHA IDA MAE HOLLAND ; HER STRUGGLE BEGAN IN MISSISSIPPI , WHERE SHE ' ROSE FROM THE DIRT OF SOCIETY ' TO BECOME A CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST , TEACHER AND PRIZE-WINNING PLAYWRIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> She walks into the classroom wearing crimson tights , red Reebok ' s and an oversized red sweater spattered with odd-shaped gold buttons . Although she relies_on the support of a large wooden cane , she radiates strength as she slowly maneuvers her way into the room , wearing a brilliant smile . She reminds her students that they will be reading their autobiographical essays aloud . And as they fidget with their notes , she lounges back in her chair the same way someone preparing to watch her favorite movie would sink into a sofa . To Endesha Ida Mae Holland , everyone has a story buried somewhere inside . Her job is to help unleash those stories and carve them into jewels . Holland is a prize-winning playwright , tenured college professor , longtime civil_rights activist and a self-proclaimed nurturer of the human spirit . Her own life started_out tragically , but she never gave_up on the idea that she could do_better . Now , her success is a source of inspiration to others struggling to realize their dreams . &quot; When you say , ' She went from being a prostitute to Ph.D , ' it brings people some hope , &quot; Holland said . &quot; that ' s why I don ' t mind people talking_about my past. &quot; Although Holland has been at USC only since January , she already has left an indelible mark at the university , where she teaches a playwriting class in the School of Theatre and an autobiography / biography class as part of a program called the Study of Women and Men in Society . &quot; She connects with you at a deep place , &quot; said Linda-Rose Myers , a graduate_student in her playwriting class . &quot; It ' s really exciting to be with her because you see her spirit. &quot; Holland has the ability to inspire because , as she puts it , she &quot; rose from the dirt of society &quot; to achieve great things . Born in 1944 in the northern Mississippi town of Greenwood , Holland spent her childhood in a run-down home with her mother and three siblings . Her sister and brothers were the town drunks . But her mother was a strong woman who delivered the black babies that white doctors would n ' t . On her 11th birthday , Holland was raped by the white grandfather of a child she was baby-sitting . Angry and frustrated , she became a prostitute at age 12 , charging white_men $ 10 and African American men $ 5 . She dropped_out of school in the ninth grade , and then spent time in and out of jail for shoplifting and fighting until she was swept_up by the civil_rights movement of the 1960s . She had trailed a black civil_rights worker from out of town , hoping to turn a trick with him . Instead , he recruited her to work_on a voter registration drive_in Greenwood . &quot; I didn ' t know what I was doing until I started marching , &quot; Holland said . &quot; My values changed after that . I didn ' t want to steal no more , and I didn ' t want to ' ho ' no more. &quot; Despite the excitement of being part of a historic movement , Holland still cannot talk_about what happened next without tears welling_up in her eyes . In 1965 , hooded men believed to be Ku Klux Klansmen killed Holland ' s mother , who was in a wheelchair , when they firebombed her home_in retaliation for her daughter ' s activism . &quot; The one wish I have is that my mama was alive to see me now , &quot; said Holland , who does not know her real father ' s identity . &quot; But when I told Oprah ( Winfrey ) that , she said to me , ' How do you think all this happened ? Your mama ' s still with you. ' &quot; A year after her mother ' s death , she moved to Minneapolis to attend school . Having received her high_school equivalency diploma , she started taking classes at the University of Minnesota at the urging of fellow civil_rights workers and her prostitute and junkie friends . Although Holland had stopped turning tricks , she established friendships with prostitutes and junkies in Minneapolis . In 1979 -- 13 years after she first enrolled -- Holland received a bachelor ' s degree from the university in Afro-American studies . Five years later , she earned a master ' s degree in American studies , and two years later , she received her doctorate . She went_on to write eight plays , including her autobiographical work &quot; From the Mississippi Delta , &quot; which has been performed internationally and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1988 . Holland also is the recipient of more_than two_dozen awards , including the 1981 Lorraine Hansberry Award for her first play , &quot; Second Doctor Lady. &quot; In addition to being a prolific playwright , Holland has just completed her autobiography , which will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster next year . She is also negotiating a movie deal about her life_story . Longtime friends said they knew Holland ' s stories would be told one day , and that a lot of people would listen . &quot; When I first met Endesha , stories were coming_out of her every minute , &quot; said Elaine Tyler May , a professor of American studies at the University of Minnesota who worked with Holland on her dissertation . &quot; During the first day of class , everyone was supposed to introduce themselves and tell a little bit about themselves . Endesha had everyone in the class in tears by her brief but powerful story of her life. &quot; Holland ' s break came when a New York City producer , Woodie King Jr. , came_to Buffalo in 1987 to see a performance of &quot; From the Mississippi Delta , &quot; which began as a one-woman dramatic reading . At the time , Holland was an assistant_professor in the American Studies Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo , and frequently performed her own plays . King showcased the play in New York , and soon , &quot; From the Mississippi Delta &quot; made its way to theaters across the country , winning accolades at almost every stop . Producer Susan Quint Gallin saw the play in Hartford , and then turned it into an off-Broadway production with Oprah Winfrey as co-producer . Although Holland ' s passion for the dramatics has not ebbed , she can no longer perform because she suffers from ataxia , an incurable , degenerative neurological_disorder that causes her to occasionally lose her balance . Although ataxia is not necessarily fatal , it has affected Holland ' s speech and her ability to walk . She now spends much of her time writing from her spacious condominium overlooking the harbor in Marina del Rey . She lives alone among striking African artwork and portraits of her mother , who is the inspiration for much of her work . Her only child , Cedric , 32 , lives in Buffalo . In Swahili , &quot; Endesha &quot; means &quot; one who drives herself and others. &quot; She was given the name in 1979 by Kwanzaa creator and Cal State Long_Beach professor Maulana Karenga , and she takes it seriously . &quot; I want to make an impact , &quot; she said . &quot; . . . I know the reason why I made_it was because people believed_in me . that ' s what I want to give_back to others -- a sense of hope. &quot; Students appear to feed_on Holland ' s optimism . Although she can be brutally honest if she believes someone ' s writing is emotionless or awkward , she convinces her students that they have to keep trying until they get_it right . She is also savvy enough to know that aspiring writers and playwrights need more_than just encouragement if they want to make a living . Sometimes , she seems less like a playwriting professor than a shrewd businesswoman with a wealth of tips about how to get an agent , attract a publisher and play hardball when negotiating contracts . She is upfront about the obstacles artists face as they strive for recognition , but she still manages to pump self-esteem into her students in clever ways . She recently invited professional actors to read her students ' plays to give them a chance to hear their works performed by professionals . After the actors read senior Andrew Kamenetzky ' s play about a blues guitarist who sold his soul to the_devil , Kamenetzky ' s first words to the principal actor were : &quot; If this play is ever produced , you ' re hired. &quot; &quot; It was really great to hear it performed like that , &quot; Kamenetzky said . &quot; Dr. Holland has made me believe that I can do this . She ' s encouraged me to write from the heart. &quot; Part of the reason Holland is so effective at encouraging others is because she does not accept excuses . After seeing &quot; From the Mississippi Delta &quot; in Detroit , Habibi Minnie Wilson wrote Holland a letter saying how moved she was by the play and including samples of_her_own poetry . In her letter , Wilson told Holland that she was a similar age , and that she too had overcome a life of obstacles . But unlike Holland , Wilson said she had too many other obligations to pursue her writing dreams . A few months later , Wilson ' s phone rang . It was Holland . &quot; I was flabbergasted , &quot; Wilson said in a telephone_interview . &quot; But she said she wanted to offer words of encouragement . I told her my self-esteem was low , and she said , ' No , homegirl , you ' ve got_to find a publisher. ' I said I was too old to go_to school , but the next thing I knew , I was moving to Buffalo to get my college degree. &quot; About four years have passed , and Wilson is now preparing to graduate summa cum laude from the State University of New York at Buffalo with a degree in women ' s studies . &quot; She sees potential in everyone she meets , but particularly women who are middle-aged and don ' t feel they have any power , &quot; said Wilson , who is now Holland ' s business manager . &quot; I do not think I could have done any of this without her. &quot; For her part , Holland said she reached_out to Wilson because she liked the way she crafted her letter . &quot; She was talking_about ambition , and I said to myself , ' Now , here ' s someone who needs a break , ' &quot; she said . Holland said she often receives letters and calls from people who want to do something creative but feel trapped by fear and lack of inspiration . &quot; I hear from whites , blacks , Asians , Latinos , males and females , &quot; she said . &quot; They all tell me they can relate to my story. &quot; Holland came_to USC at the urging of Steven Sample , who was president of the State University of New York at Buffalo before being named president of USC . After her first semester of teaching , her colleagues see endless potential in her . &quot; Students are still a little bit in_awe_of her , &quot; said Robert Scales , the dean of USC ' s School of Theatre . &quot; But we ' re thinking of doing creative things like performing her plays with professionals . &quot; Endesha is a real person who wants to give something back . She has a voice and it ' s more_than just being a teacher. &quot; Although Holland almost moved_back to Buffalo after the Jan . 17 earthquake , she likes Los Angeles and USC . She said part of the reason she came_to USC is because it ' s at the edge of South-Central . &quot; I haven ' t been here long enough to know what ' s really going_on , but it seems like people here feel a sense of hopelessness , &quot; she said . &quot; There ' s a sense of being unable to do things . I want to help people break_down the barriers. &quot; One young_woman in Holland ' s playwriting class recently took a trip to Missouri to see her own play produced , courtesy of the Ida Mae Holland Educational and Artistic Scholarship Fund . The scholarship , which is named after Holland ' s mother , is designed for anyone who wants to go_to school or needs funds to pursue his or her professional goals . &quot; If someone says , ' I want to go_to school , ' I stay_on them and make_it so that they have no reason not to go , &quot; Holland said . &quot; I even have a stack of community_college applications that I keep_in this apartment. &quot; Holland ' s pride is evident when she talks_about her work and accomplishments . She ' s not afraid to say she has made_it , and she wants other people to know it . She almost seems haughty when she tells students in her class that she expects people to call her &quot; doctor , &quot; but no one is challenging her . &quot; She ' s someone who makes you think that if you just hang_in there , great things can happen , &quot; said Felton Perry , an actor and friend of Holland ' s . &quot; She ' s living proof of that. &quot; On the Cover She was raped at 11 , turned_to prostitution at 12 and suffered through the violent_death of her mother . But she was transformed by the righteous fervor of the civil_rights movement , and Endesha Ida Mae Holland has spent more_than a decade bringing her life experiences to the stage . Now , she ' s inspiring students at USC . &quot; She has always struck me as a walking storehouse of wisdom , &quot; said Elaine Tyler May , an American studies professor at State University of New York at Buffalo , Holland ' s former employer .</TEXT>
