   <TEXT> I lost a beautiful lady to a bitch . . . . That bitch took my lady . . . to sell her body for smoke . . . . Stole her heart and body and soul . A once beautiful body looks_like a bag of bones . . . . I pray she will break that chain . To get_away and stay_away_from that bitch cocaine . -- Street poet Southern Comfort , on a wall on Skid_Row . * Out in abandoned bungalows and broken-down cars , out under the cardboard lean-tos of the city ' s homeless camps and in the clattering halls of drug-recovery houses , the addicts talk in metaphors . It is a bitch , a devil , a god , a Svengali . It is a lover , an only friend , a full-time job . It is a curse unlike anything that came_before . &quot; You ' ve got_to have it no matter what , and you ' ll go_to any lengths to get_it , &quot; said Sharon Hayes , who remembers times when for five straight days she smoked crack cocaine , times when she went without eating , times when she engaged in sex for the sole purpose of affording her next high . Gordon Marble lost his job , his family , his home and everything he owned . He said he first fully understood the seductive power of the drug the second time he used it -- in bed with a woman in a hotel_room . &quot; Once I took a drag off the cocaine pipe , I didn ' t want the sex , &quot; Marble said . &quot; I just wanted the cocaine. &quot; A lust for crack cocaine is a thread that unites untold thousands of the homeless in Los Angeles -- from the garages and back alleys of Boyle Heights to the rooftops and beaches of Venice ; from the parking_lots of Long_Beach to the wooded parks and railroad_tracks of the San Fernando Valley . Crack is everywhere , a fiercely dominating drug that has eroded much of the city ' s beleaguered core while scattering &quot; mini Skid_Rows &quot; throughout poorer outlying neighborhoods . Not only has crack substantially added_to the number of people on the streets , it also has changed very dramatically the nature of those streets , making them far rougher , more desperate places . For the sake of a hit , guns blaze , people die , apartments are ransacked , windows are smashed . Those who have gone so far as_to neglect bills or mortgages , giving_up beds and refrigerators and indoor plumbing , find it not so difficult to make further reckless choices : to prey upon fellow transients and the mentally_ill , to break_into garages and vending_machines , to hijack cars and hold_up liquor_stores , to usurp parks and street_corners to buy and sell and get high . In the crass street ethic of the drug , all other rules and priorities submit to a single overriding aim : to obtain that next rock . The consequences do not always make headlines ; far more often , crack merely chisels away , day in , day out , at the elaborate underlying framework of society . Driven by their cravings , men steal from their families . Young mothers forsake baby food and diapers . Teen-agers drop_out of school . Employees quit their jobs -- or get fired for theft and absenteeism . Institutions such_as marriage and religion , the axis on which so many moral values revolve , weaken and give_way . There are husbands who disappear for days or weeks at a time -- the intermittent homeless , some still spiraling downward . There are wives and girlfriends walking the streets as prostitutes or &quot; strawberries &quot; -- women who trade sex for cocaine -- one more route to what addicts call &quot; the curb. &quot; &quot; When you ' re disadvantaged and you throw crack into that , you absolutely can ' t make_it , &quot; said Alice Callaghan , director of Las Familias del Pueblo , a family service_agency on Skid_Row . &quot; Crack just crumbles you . It pins you to the ground. &quot; Tabulating crack ' s impact on homelessness is , of course , difficult ; the experts cannot even agree on how many people reside on the nation ' s streets . Certainly , a substantial share of the homeless do not use crack , and crack smokers do not inevitably wind_up poor , or commit crimes . The roots of poverty and lawlessness run deep ; some connect , some reach back for decades , some are entirely unrelated to drugs . Still , activists acknowledge that the relationship between the drug and homelessness is more closely entwined than many of them would have admitted a_few years ago . In a vacuum of statistics and hard data , one fact stands_out as if etched in neon : During crack ' s 10-year siege , Los Angeles County ' s estimated homeless population has doubled , reaching 75 # 000 on any given night . What alcohol can do over 10 or 20 years , crack can do_in a year , or less . For anyone living paycheck to paycheck , it allows scant time to see the danger and regain equilibrium . For someone already homeless , turning_to crack for escape , the drug becomes a Sisyphean burden . The rock does not permit escape , not easily . It is there day and night , on nearly any block , a crushing obstacle for those who might otherwise climb out of the depths . Crack has thus wrought upon the city a soundless explosion : The shock_waves were felt , the victims now lie_in rows on the sidewalks , but no one really heard the bomb . Few communities , if any , have escaped the damage . Homeless crack addicts are part of the reason that , in South-Central , 62-year-old Esquine Pettie has had to change the time of her Neighborhood Watch meetings to 5 p.m. , before dark , because it has become so_much scarier to go outside . &quot; They sleep_in the daytime and rambles at night , &quot; Pettie said of the transient rock smokers who congregate in parks and abandoned houses , moving every time the police flush them out . &quot; They just go from one house to another house . The senior_citizens say they can ' t walk to the market , can ' t go_to the bus stop. &quot; Crack dealers have taken_over entire apartment_houses in Van Nuys . Dan Faller , president of an apartment owners group , remembers one landlord whose tenants fled as the dealers moved_in , bringing with them the addicts and transients who helped to strip the fixtures and render the building uninhabitable . &quot; The owner had to walk away and leave it , &quot; Faller said . &quot; It ' s hard . You ' re dealing with somebody who can kill you. &quot; Of all_the stages on which crack and homelessness have played as high drama , perhaps no town in the nation has offered more compelling theater than Santa Monica , a liberal , upscale beach city that once embraced the homeless by opening parks to overnight camping and initiating aid programs . That was before crack addicts began taking the blame for worsening crime and turning public_opinion against the homeless . In a city of 87 # 000 residents , about 1 # 000 people living_on the streets now account_for one-third of police calls and up_to 45 % of bookings in jail , said Police_Chief James T . Butts Jr . Car break-ins have escalated . Apartment tenants have complained of transients camping in carports , even setting fires . Despite a citizens ' campaign that led to the parks being closed again at night , the battle still rages , and many residents fear their town is forever changed . &quot; There was a time when -- when your kids got_to be about 10 -- you could let them walk to the park and play , &quot; said Jean Sedillos , who joined a group called Save Our City to try to clean_up the parks . &quot; You can ' t do that anymore . At some parks , they ' ve taken the doors off the bathrooms because of drugs . You never know if a drug deal ' s going_on in the bathrooms. &quot; For a while , police ran sting operations directed at transient cocaine dealers in Palisades Park along the bluff-top between the beach and some of the city ' s most opulent hotels . Even after $ 400 # 000 in police overtime , the problem persisted . Ultimately , City Councilman Kelly Olsen won approval for a six-month , $ 540 # 000 program establishing a full-time police patrol in the park . Launched in June , the patrol has won praise , but the money is about to end . Many residents do not know what to do . Many feel intimidated . &quot; You ' ll find that all_of the seniors start going_home at 4 o ' clock , &quot; said 90-year-old Florence Cardine , who considered Santa Monica one of the world ' s beautiful places when she first moved to town 50 years ago . &quot; It isn ' t safe to be out on the streets anymore . I would never think_of going_out alone. &quot; Fear creates a variety of hardships . Jess Markey has been hurt financially . Outside his print_shop in Downtown Los Angeles , Markey sees homeless crack smokers every day , all day long . They break_into cars and steal briefcases , tapes , anything they can sell . They panhandle . They scavenge for the drug in the cracks of the sidewalk . For two years , Markey said , he has been looking_to hire new employees . No one seems willing to work_on 7th Street . One woman a year ago never even got_through the door , calling later to say she just didn ' t feel safe . &quot; They just light_up right in front of you , &quot; Markey said of the users , mostly lean , restless men who have in common one horrific fact : They are among the drug ' s most pitiable victims . The suffering of the homeless addicts is a living hell . No one can know the depth of it , they will tell you , without tumbling down that same chasm . The addicts tell stories , and those stories take_on an aspect of caricature -- so filled with anguish and irrational acts that they would defy belief , except that they unfold time and again , along roughly similar plot_lines . Aloyisous Anderson , now 31 , a former forklift operator from Norwalk , was a crack user . He owed $ 6 # 000 in payments on his Ford Escort when he sold it to the dope dealer for $ 200 in rocks . &quot; I just watched the guy drive_off in my car and I didn ' t really care , &quot; he said , &quot; because I had dope in my hand . I just went_on in the house and I smoked . . . . I used to smoke in a walk-in closet . I had a reclining chair in there , and I would n ' t come_out . I stayed_up in there all day. &quot; Charles Chavers was renting a home with his girlfriend and training to operate construction equipment when he first inhaled the vapors in a lot behind a pool hall in Bakersfield . &quot; I was hooked right then . . . that first hit , &quot; Chavers , 42 , said outside a Skid_Row rehabilitation house . Within 24 hours he had spent $ 100 . By the end of four months , the drug was a complete obsession , costing him $ 300 a day -- even more if he had it . Chavers quit school , sold everything -- stereo , clothes , rings , lamps , telephone . He got $ 45 for a 19-inch color_TV and faked a break-in to account_for the loss . He parted_with a ' 76 Mercury that he figured was worth $ 700 . The crack dealer got the pink_slip for $ 150 in rocks . &quot; If he ' d have told me $ 75 , &quot; Chavers said , &quot; then he ' d have got the car for $ 75. &quot; From there it got_worse -- a breakup with his girlfriend , a series of cheap apartments , living without lights , without gas , refusing to pay rent , cashing food_stamps to buy crack , losing_weight , committing burglaries and armed_robberies . Chavers ended_up on Skid_Row , then in prison , then back on Skid_Row , where one day , just before he sought treatment , he tried to hang his girlfriend by her belt from the 12th story of the Frontier Hotel -- because she took a_few dollars , or stayed out too late , he doesn ' t quite remember . &quot; The drug and alcohol , mixed together , just sent me off into a rage , &quot; he said . &quot; My life was unmanageable . You want it so_much you ' re willing to take_a_chance on losing your life to go_out here and get it. &quot; Crack ' s destructive punch , its power to send lives crashing to the sidewalk , reaches across all racial and economic lines . Joe Shulkin , a 43-year-old television writer from West Hollywood , lost a six-figure income and found himself living_in a string of dilapidated motels . He and his wife , Cheryl , came_to see the drug as a disembodied voice , guiding their steps , at once soothing and insatiable . &quot; The drug takes_on a personality all its own , &quot; Shulkin said . &quot; It just gets_to the point where , if you can afford it , you don ' t even want to sleep. &quot; Yet not everyone hears its siren call . For complex social reasons , the drug has burned its greatest swath through low-income , mostly minority neighborhoods , where for only $ 5 or $ 10 it offers , in concentrated form , a high once available only to those who could afford costly powder cocaine . In the minds of those who welcomed crack into their dens and bedrooms , the new drug held a certain cachet . It connoted sex , caviar , the ultimate in self-indulgence . Depressants such_as alcohol or heroin might bring serenity ; crack , it turned_out , emboldened the smoker with energy , a colossal sense of power . &quot; You immediately feel_like you can handle the world , no problem , &quot; said Marble , 41 , who now beds_down in a Skid_Row recovery house after living_on the streets and in abandoned homes_in Compton . &quot; Let ' s say I ' m depressed and concerned about the job and the wife nagging me about the money that ' s gone . One blast_off the cocaine and I start to feel the sensation where my head gets light . I start to get kind of excitable . Where I was depressed and low , now I ' m up and standing tall . &quot; Then my thoughts are saying , ' I can manipulate my wife , I can manipulate my job , I can manipulate the Internal Revenue Service . . . . ' &quot; To many smokers , there came_to exist a wide gap between the euphoria of the high and the trials of life in communities marred by chronic unemployment , crime , despair , domestic strife , drug_abuse and other social problems . The two opposite poles create an almost electrical force -- &quot; the magnetic pull of confusion , &quot; addict Linwood Brown calls it -- which seizes users and rapidly propels them downward . Crack use on the streets varies by age_group and by neighborhood . Though most statistics are rough guesses , at best , some experts put the percentage of the homeless who use cocaine at about 15 % -- or half of those believed to regularly use drugs . On Skid_Row and in its lesser spin-offs -- among them , dense encampments at MacArthur and Lafayette parks -- the proportion is thought to be far higher . Former addict Mike Neely , who now runs an outreach program on Skid_Row , estimates that at least half of the homeless population there uses crack , while some addicts insist the percentage is more like 70 % or 80 % , even counting those in missions and hotel_rooms . Skid_Row is the bottom of the abyss . A nether world of Darwinian laws and grotesque horrors , it is crack ' s kingdom , the one place in Los Angeles where every facet of life has been tainted . The changes in Skid_Row over the past decade offer by far the clearest window onto crack ' s domination of other drugs and the dark spell it casts over users : How it has grabbed hold , warping attitudes , turning what has always been a bleak , trouble-marred corner of the city into a pit even more grim and unforgiving . &quot; If you walk down through there , you ' ll smell something , and most people will say it ' s the stench of the street , &quot; said Chavers . &quot; And it ain ' t . It ' s death . A lot of people are simply dying , and either they don ' t know they ' re dying or they don ' t care , because it takes_away everything . It takes_away the will to live . All you want to do is smoke. &quot; Hard-core addicts who become homeless tend to gravitate to Skid_Row because of the proximity of welfare offices and a cornucopia of free-meal programs and clothing giveaways . They share the streets , shelters and hotels with alcoholics , heroin_addicts , multi-drug users , the mentally_ill and other transients , taking_part in a brisk street economy in which crack is both currency and commodity . Rocks even as small as a quarter of an aspirin sell on nearly any corner -- $ 1 hits . The hustle to afford them goes_on day and night . There are handouts to sell : A hamburger provided by a homeless mission might bring $ 1 , or a worn shirt 50 cents . Stolen goods account_for much of the trade : onions and grapes from the produce markets , toys , flowers , camping tents , shoes , electronic_equipment . Addicts make regular assaults at night on warehouses crowned in razor wire . Some deal drugs , smoking up their profits ; some run errands or obtain crack for other users in exchange for hits , or trundle shopping_carts of recyclable cans and bottles . The most deeply afflicted say they can spend a $ 212 welfare check on crack in 24 hours , and in the long intervening days they hustle from dawn till dark -- going without food , showers , clean clothing or shelter , pausing when they can savor a $ 1 or $ 5 or $ 10 rock . Many addicts seem resigned to bitter hardship . Outside a ramshackle lean-to on Ceres Avenue , a man known to his friends as Black scrapes_up dope or cash by fixing bicycles . In September , he and his girlfriend , Theresa , became parents of a baby boy -- 5 pounds , 9 ounces , born in good_health at County-USC Medical_Center , but in foster care because Theresa was found to have cocaine in her blood . The parents grieve for their baby ; they are going_to court to try to win him back . Yet at every crossroads they seem to turn toward crack . For Theresa , 30 , it is the third time she has been forced to give_up a child . The second time , five years ago , she went eight months of her pregnancy without using , she said . She even saved a little money to buy Christmas toys for her daughter in Dallas . But before she mailed them , she said , her boyfriend at the time sold them for cocaine . Theresa said she was so upset that she left their rented room and bought a rock on Crenshaw Boulevard . Soon they were broke , lost the room and ended_up Downtown , where one night the boyfriend slammed her body to the pavement . Two days later , she went_into labor . &quot; I had a pipe full of dope , &quot; Theresa said , remembering how she tried to get someone to call the paramedics , but the only man near her insisted on first having a hit off the pipe . In a rage , she said , she shattered the glass tube in the street , screaming at him , &quot; F--- the pipe , this baby is_on the way ! &quot; The man answered , &quot; F--- the baby , I ' m going_to buy me a pipe. &quot; Then he hurried off , leaving her to crawl to a pay phone . This time the pregnancy was much easier , Theresa said . Black looked_out for her and forbid her to smoke . But she found ways to outwit him . &quot; I use , &quot; she said , &quot; any time I can get it. &quot; In the decade since crack arrived on Skid_Row , the street population has become , by most accounts , larger , younger and more violent . Though murder rates are not as high Downtown as in some areas overrun by street gangs , the Skid_Row homeless now regularly carry knives , lead pipes , even handguns . The hard-core users have pushed some of the more docile addicts and alcoholics into East Los Angeles , into MacArthur and Lafayette parks , into Pasadena and elsewhere . Rip-offs and assaults motivated by crack are common . Skid_Row loan_sharks expect a $ 2 or $ 3 return on the dollar , and delinquent addicts sometimes are killed . Occasionally the overdue debtors stop in at Las Familias on Seventh Street in tears , said director Callaghan . Some end_up boarding a bus out of town . More_than 2 # 000 crack-related arrests were made last year on Skid_Row , not counting assaults and burglaries in which no crack was confiscated . Despite running regular drug raids , police concede they are overwhelmed . &quot; Cocaine is a particularly difficult drug for us , &quot; said Detective Ed Auerbach of the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s narcotics group Downtown . Partly because it is such a stimulant , it creates &quot; the kind of emotional_states that tend to produce erratic or violent behavior . It causes people to get very agitated and nervous and paranoid and defensive and to act_out in a very aggressive manner. &quot; Chavers said he used to wait outside a check-cashing office and bludgeon people with an ax handle to get money to feed his cravings . Remorse was never part of the deal . &quot; If you laid there and bled to death , it wasn ' t on me , &quot; Chavers said . &quot; I got what I wanted . ( Cocaine ) hardens you . It turns you into something that you ' re not . . . . You ' ve got your drugs ; nine times_out of 10 you ' ve got a ' strawberry. ' And you and her , you don ' t care about that guy you left in that alley . If he makes_it , he makes_it . And if he don ' t , he don ' t. &quot; The promiscuity of many addicts has become a deadly new means of transmission of the virus that causes AIDS . Men with cash often celebrate by finding a woman , a hotel_room and a supply of cocaine . The room being optional , cocaine is also traded for sex in alleys , cars and cardboard shacks . In a study of the sex-for-crack phenomenon , UCLA researchers Kathleen Boyle and Douglas Anglin learned that the buyers ' market heavily favored men , who , having crack , had little difficulty finding partners . &quot; Strawberries &quot; were reluctant to insist on using condoms for fear of losing the chance to get high . AIDS reaches ever deeper into Skid_Row , spread by both intercourse and intravenous_injection . The infection rate among those who get tested is about 20 % , according to one clinical group that gives free exams . The roll_call of the sick includes Rochelle Davis , 37 , a tiny woman with large , expressive eyes who has been hospitalized eight times since her first collapse early last year . She was introduced to cocaine in 1979 ; a man she dated showed her how to smoke it by free-basing -- in which the drug is burned with a makeshift torch . Seeing it sizzle , she grew alarmed . &quot; I said , ' Damn , what is that ? I ' m scared of that , ' &quot; Davis recalled . &quot; He said , ' Nothing to be afraid of. ' &quot; But that same man later forced her into prostitution on South Figueroa Street to support their habits . Eventually , she said , he went_to prison and she drifted Downtown , where for seven years she lived_on the streets , weighing her craving for crack against her own fragile values . Some women consented to sex for as little as $ 5 ; Davis felt she preserved a measure of pride by insisting on $ 20 . &quot; I said I wasn ' t no cheap ' strawberry. ' &quot; Now , because of AIDS , she yearns to stay clean . This fall , social_worker Callaghan found a $ 240-a-month room for Davis and her boyfriend at the Pershing Hotel . In the lobby there one afternoon , Davis boasted of being sober seven days , feeling just great . But the stress hangs_on her . &quot; I ' m dying slowly but surely , and I know it , &quot; she said . &quot; I think_about the HIV , and I get scared . . . . And my old_man , he gets_to drinking his beer and he might say stuff , and I just get me some money and just break_out of here and get high. &quot; And so it was , a_few weeks later : Davis , alone among crowds on the trash-strewn sidewalks of 5th and Crocker streets , the city ' s crack hub ; back to a place where she could find a brand of solace . The bitterness of AIDS abets its own lethal spread among addicts . On Seventh Street , where transvestite bars foster heavy prostitution among gays , Alan Jackson , 49 , looked_back on a life laid waste . Crack made him homeless . He was diagnosed with AIDS four years ago . He spoke through several missing teeth and a bloody sore on his lip about the brutality of life on the streets . Still , there are times , Jackson said , when he gets his $ 671 Social_Security check , buys a quarter ounce of crack for $ 150 , and finds another man from the streets to join him in a hotel_room . He uses condoms , Jackson said . That is as far as he goes_in trying to ensure that he does not pass along the virus . &quot; that ' s what the Lord ' s going_to punish me for , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m only concerned about me. &quot; In their study , which began in 1989 , the UCLA researchers reported one surprise finding that had nothing to do with sex : How frequently the addicts attributed their homelessness to the drug . &quot; Many of our subjects , though heavy users of other drugs , had fairly stable lives before heavy crack use , &quot; the scholars wrote . &quot; For all , the quick escalation of their need for the drug seemed to catch them by surprise. &quot; It also caught much of America by surprise . Crack hit the streets in the early 1980s . Homelessness became a national issue during the same period . Yet the connection between the two went unnoticed by most so-called experts for many years . In 1984 , when homelessness first made the cover of Newsweek magazine , drugs were not even mentioned in accounting_for the crowds that were taking_to the streets in Los Angeles , New York , St . Louis , Atlanta , Chicago . At the time , advocates for the homeless were blaming Reagan-era cuts_to housing , welfare and mental-health programs , coupled with a general breakdown in family bonds . New York attorney Robert M . Hayes , who was emerging as one of the nation ' s leading activists on homelessness , told the media that the plight of the displaced could be summed_up in three words : &quot; Housing , housing , housing. &quot; There was much truth in all_the outcry , but it told only part of the story . Activists considered it a given that a certain percentage of the homeless were substance_abusers -- mainly alcoholics . Tactically , there was no point in harping on drugs when it risked destroying political support for those who needed aid . &quot; There was an effort , in some ways , to homogenize the ( homeless ) population and make_it look as mainstream as possible , &quot; said USC professor Jennifer Wolch , co-author of a book about Los Angeles called &quot; Malign Neglect : Homelessness in an American City. &quot; &quot; If you are arguing for programs and money . . . ( drug_addiction ) is not particularly popular . A lot of people believe drug_addicts got themselves into it , and why should we help them out ? &quot; Then , too , there just wasn ' t much data . No one was charting trends in crack consumption among the homeless and looking_at the fallout . The first warnings were sounded far below the level of public_debate , by voices from the streets . Among the more eloquent were members of the Homeless Writers Coalition -- street poets who began meeting in Los Angeles at a quirky Skid_Row cultural center named Another Planet . The Writers were like a teardrop from the eye of God ; out of suffering , they emerged as a gift , eager to help the downtrodden , said co-founder Alexander Anderson , now 40 . Anderson wrote with passion in the mid-1980s about the evils of crack , comparing the eyes of a coked-up user to the high beams of a car : &quot; He got his high beams on / And it won ' t be long / Before he sells his Cadillac and his three big homes ; / He said he needed a hit , / That led to 15 more ; / Now that sucker has to crawl around on his bedroom floor ; / Around and around and around . . . trying to find some more. &quot; His friend , Charles Walker , a.k.a. , Southern Comfort , also wrote_about the drug ; eventually , he emblazoned some of the verse on what addicts call the &quot; Berlin Wall &quot; on Fifth Street . For a time , the Writers achieved success -- city funding , performances at schools and churches , their own compact_disc . But they , too , were battered by crack . At one time , Comfort estimated , there were 20 members , a dozen of them smoking the drug . Eventually , he said , the group split , with one high-ranking member accused of embezzling and smoking up $ 12 # 000 in proceeds . Two members were later killed over cocaine -- one , a performer known as Pops , in July of 1993 , because of a $ 15 debt . By Comfort ' s account , Pops repaid the money to a dealer ' s girlfriend , who spent it on crack . In the end , the dealer took her word over his and shot Pops_in the chest . Tears and deaths out on the crowded streets of urban America were not enough to put a political spotlight on what was happening to the homeless because of crack cocaine . But , one by one , other voices were coming_forth , people who had seen it , people directly familiar_with the pain . One was Neely , the founder of Los Angeles ' nonprofit Homeless Outreach Program , who had plumbed the depths of addiction by parting_with about $ 90 # 000 over six years . He had lost an aerospace job , a home , a family and had done what many addicts do -- slept_in the rain , booked rooms only to check_out when the money and crack were gone . The $ 5 deposit on a hotel key was good for a $ 5 rock . At one point , living_on an upper floor of a $ 90-a-week Downtown hotel , Neely grew so paranoid that he imagined there were thieves in the room above , lowering a string and chewing gum through the window to try to heist those precious nuggets . &quot; Cocaine cost me everything , &quot; he said . &quot; It cost me everything that I ever had , everything I was , everything I ever wanted to be. &quot; Neely turned the nightmare into activism , traveling in the late 1980s to homelessness conferences in Miami , New Orleans , San Francisco and elsewhere . He kept talking_about crack , he said , and people kept rolling their eyes and turning the discussions back to housing and social_services . Similarly frustrated was Donald Burnes , who ran an emergency-assistance program for the poor in Washington , D.C. Burnes and his wife , Alice Baum , an alcohol and drug counselor , began work in 1986 on a book they published this year , &quot; A Nation in Denial : The Truth About Homelessness. &quot; In it , they argue that untreated drug_addiction , alcoholism and mental_illness are more to blame than poverty and lack of housing . The tragedy , they say , is that by failing to acknowledge the root problems , America allowed homelessness to gain unintended momentum . Time has brought a deeper understanding . Today , in Los Angeles , low-cost housing is more available than in decades . Through redevelopment , $ 206 million in public funds was spent to refurbish 40 of the 73 hotels on and around Skid_Row . Every night , especially during summer months , many of those rooms sit empty . Vacancy_rates in traditional bachelor and single apartments in central Los Angeles have climbed to 21 % , according to a survey by the Apartment Owners Assn . of Southern California . Emptiest of all are apartments in the lower rent ranges , starting at $ 400 a month . Part of the trouble is enduring poverty . And part of it is the continuing drain of crack cocaine . &quot; Crack is a problem that we , as a society , ignored for a long period_of_time , &quot; Neely said . &quot; We ' re still in the infancy of addressing the issue. &quot; Addicts lament that there are too few places to turn . Treatment programs , by most accounts , are sorely underfunded ; the wait for county-sponsored beds is 17 days at most facilities . Addicts who have surrendered to the power of the drug rarely wait that long -- not when , as they point_out , the dope man is open 24 hours a day . There are hints of better days ahead . In parts of town , the crack epidemic has shown signs of slowing , even receding . The quality of the drug on the street has dropped significantly in recent years -- the result , apparently , of dealers trying to maximize profits . Teen-age drug_users in Hollywood , Venice and outlying parts of the Valley have turned , instead , to marijuana and methamphetamine . A certain number of crack addicts do get help , many through hospitals and recovery centers that stress 12-step programs modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous . Chavers , Marble and Sharon Hayes are among them . Anderson , the street poet , is now clean and sharing a sober-living apartment . Southern Comfort lost one girlfriend to the drug -- her whereabouts are unknown -- but he rescued another woman from crack addiction . They have two children and an apartment in Palmdale . And yet , success stories seem to be the exceptions . Comfort ' s best_friend , Paul Johnson , still_lives with his dog Punchie on Skid_Row , cooking for other addicts , hustling and using . On a recent sun-filled morning , he lay nearly incoherent at Fifth and Crocker , his bare feet jutting from a crumpled box . He cradled fragments of rock while he sucked on his glass pipe . Down every adjoining street were others like him , hanging_out , scheming for money , going nowhere . &quot; Where would I like to be in the year 2000 ? &quot; Edwin Broome , 51 , mused on a stretch of Towne Avenue lined in steel gates and cinder_block . &quot; I ' d like to be_on my property , enjoying my grandkids and just kicking_back . . . . I ask God all_the time , ' Why are you putting me through this misery ? ' &quot; But Slim , as they call him , has no answer . He rarely hears from his two grown children and three grandchildren .
