   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : CORONA DEL MAR ; CIVIL WAR EXPERT HAS A DEVOTED FOLLOWING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Julian Scherer comes from a town in Illinois where you can start a fight by publicly disparaging the President . Not President Clinton , but Abraham_Lincoln . Scherer , a 77-year-old retired university professor and Civil War buff , takes this partisanship into the weekly verbal shootouts at the OASIS Senior Center in Corona del Mar , where he leads about a dozen seniors through detailed and sometimes raised-voice discussions of the American Civil War . &quot; They do not always believe what I say , &quot; Scherer said of his seniors-only audience . &quot; They are the foremost experts on the Civil War if they can ever agree on anything. &quot; Scherer has led such sessions nearly every week since 1984 . He started it as an accredited history course at Coastline College , but because the senior audience was so devoted , he decided to hold the sessions for free at the OASIS Senior Center . Recently , Scherer began with the discussion of the battle of Pea Ridge , Ark. , by handing_out a sketched_map of northern Arkansas and southern Missouri and detailing the weather and soil conditions that affected troop movements in 1862 . Most of the men in the discussion have served in the military and were particularly interested in weaponry and siege tactics . &quot; I have known Julian a long_time , &quot; said Janusz Zaleski , a 71-year-old resident of Corona del Mar who fought in the Polish army and later under British command in World_War_II . &quot; He is tremendously knowledgeable. &quot; Over the past 10 years , he said , the group has discussed the battle_of_Gettysburg , Shiloh , Antietam and the siege_of_Vicksburg many times , but has yet to cover the entire war . &quot; We have 6 # 200 battles to choose from , &quot; Scherer said , adding that typically one major battle requires two to three weeks for discussion . Props also are allowed . At his talk_about Pea Ridge , Scherer brought a bag of hardtack , a common food for soldiers , and a Civil War-era rifle and pistol . &quot; He is the best I have ever heard , &quot; said Richard Preston . &quot; If I had him in college , I ' d have been a history major instead of an engineer. &quot; Scherer said his class mushroomed in size in 1990 after the broadcast of Ken Burn ' s 11-hour documentary &quot; The Civil War &quot; on public television . Now that he has a captive audience , he keeps them coming_back . &quot; They can ' t leave , &quot; he said , &quot; or we ' ll talk_about them. &quot; BOB ELSTON</TEXT>
