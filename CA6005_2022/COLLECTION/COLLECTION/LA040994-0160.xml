   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : COMMERCIAL VACANCY_RATES HIT LOW POINT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Vacancy_rates for commercial properties in Ventura County dropped_in the first_quarter of 1994 , hitting some of the lowest numbers since the late 1980s , according to a report by a commercial real_estate group released Friday . Office space vacancies showed the biggest decrease countywide , from 24 % in the first_quarter of 1993 to 19.2 % in the first_quarter of 1994 . Much of that decrease was_due to General Telephone Co . taking_over the lease of the long-empty Chevron office_building in Oxnard , said Charles Engel , a vice_president with CB Commercial Real_Estate Group , which published the report . But he said he expected the trend to continue . &quot; The outlook for the office-space market is very optimistic for the balance of 1994 and into 1995 , &quot; he said . Earthquake relocation helped beef_up occupancy figures for office space in east Ventura County , Engel said . Westlake Village , closest to the quake-damaged west San Fernando Valley , fared best , dropping to a 16.5 % vacancy_rate . Industrial occupancy in east Ventura County also showed a sharp drop-off because of the earthquake , from 15 % in the last_quarter of 1993 to 13.5 % in the first_quarter this year . Three corporations -- Packard Bell , NNB and Vivitar -- that relocated from the Valley after January ' s quake , have filled more_than 320 # 000 square_feet of formerly empty space . But Mark Schniepp , director of the UCSB Economic Forecasting Group , said the drop seemed more related_to the earthquake than to an improved economy . He said many businesses that relocated did so only temporarily , and will probably be required under previous leases to return when damages are repaired . &quot; There has been a progressive downward trend , &quot; Schniepp said . &quot; And that ' s good , but still , we have to remember that in an absolute sense , these vacancy numbers are still quite high. &quot; MARY F .
