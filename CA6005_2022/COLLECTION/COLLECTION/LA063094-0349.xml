   <TEXT> In a town that thrives on the flashy , Forest Whitaker is one actor who shuns the limelight , does his work and then goes_home . Nonetheless , the 32-year-old actor has worked constantly during the last couple of years , in such quirky yet high-profile films as &quot; Bird &quot; and &quot; The Crying Game , &quot; and this season he ' s in four upcoming movies , as well as in the director ' s chair again . First up is &quot; Blown Away , &quot; which opens Friday , in which Whitaker stars with Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones as Bridges ' arrogant , antagonistic bomb squad partner . &quot; I was intrigued by a character that could walk into a room and say : ' I ' m the best . Stick_around and maybe you ' ll learn something from me , ' &quot; Whitaker says shyly , while noshing on rigatoni at a corner table at his hotel . &quot; Actually , I was hoping that the film would help me with that side of things , &quot; he says , followed by a crooked grin . Well , did_it ? &quot; I don ' t know , man , &quot; he admits . &quot; I ' m sure I ' m different . I keep growing. &quot; The publicity-shy actor has been dubbed &quot; enigmatic &quot; and a &quot; loner , &quot; but Whitaker up close comes_off as merely introverted , even spiritual . &quot; I am what I seem , &quot; he says simply . &quot; I ' m not acting like I ' ve done no wrongs . And I ' ve done some rights . I ' ve had pain , worked_on things , you know , &quot; he says softly . &quot; I ' ve looked through the fire . Now I ' m trying to find some peace. &quot; The actor has his own issues as well . &quot; You know what I think_about ' Blown Away ' ? I think it ' s about redemption . I think everybody , even in the smallest manner , deals with that issue. &quot; * Whitaker , who has become something of a critics ' darling , nonetheless says that he has had to confront his self-doubt through the years . &quot; There are times when I feel_like I ' m being chased by something , &quot; he says . &quot; Of not being able to do something right . It took a long_time before I felt comfortable about what I was doing as an actor. &quot; &quot; Blown Away &quot; director Stephen Hopkins says Whitaker has clearly reached that level . &quot; He ' s an interesting fellow , &quot; he says . &quot; He speaks in such a spiritual and gentle way , so it ' s a real shock when he comes onto the set and we start to shoot a scene and bang ! He ' s this rude and arrogant , larger-than-life character . It ' s really something to watch. &quot; Whitaker ' s searing portrayal of jazz great Charlie Parker in 1988 ' s &quot; Bird , &quot; directed by Clint Eastwood , was the turning point . &quot; At that time , I wasn ' t sure about what I was doing , &quot; he insists . &quot; I was just trying my best to see if I could do_it or not . But Clint trusted me , &quot; he marvels . &quot; He taught me how to dance on a limb. &quot; Some dancing -- he won the best actor award at Cannes for his performance . * A native of Longview , Tex. , Whitaker was raised in Los Angeles and became a star football_player at Palisades High_School . He won scholarships to the University of Southern California in both theater and opera , then switched his interests from singing to acting . His affable , bearish presence was a scene stealer from the very beginning , in his film debut in 1982 ' s &quot; Fast Times at Ridgemont High &quot; and other early roles like &quot; Platoon , &quot; &quot; Good_Morning Vietnam &quot; and &quot; The Color of Money. &quot; But perhaps his most heart-wrenching performance was as the soldier in 1992 ' s &quot; The Crying Game. &quot; The film catapulted Neil Jordan into the upper echelon of directors and made unknown Jaye Davidson a star . For Whitaker , however , the role of the_British soldier had less impact . &quot; It was a very positive experience , and I was so pleased to see how well it did , &quot; he says . &quot; But did_it help my career ? &quot; Perhaps , perhaps not . But Whitaker ' s choices have often seemed calculated to challenge , not coast . His directorial debut , 1993 ' s HBO movie &quot; Strapped , &quot; a gritty urban thriller , won him the director ' s award for best first feature from the Toronto Film Festival ; he was then inundated with directing offers from virtually every major studio . While he says he prefers directing to acting , he has absolutely no desire to direct himself . &quot; When I was working_on ' Strapped , ' I was directing a scene in which two of the actors were like biting the room , &quot; he recalls . &quot; There was so_much pain . If I had been acting in the film , I ' d have to live with that pain , figure it out and maybe it would stay with me a little bit. &quot; Whitaker recently returned from Paris , where he played Cy Bianco , a fictional , flamboyant fashion_designer in Robert Altman ' s &quot; Pret-a-Porter , &quot; an inside look_at the fashion_industry and the media that cover it . He was energized by Altman ' s improvisational spirit and , while he found the world of couture elusive ( &quot; I knew_nothing about the fashion world &quot; ) , the character he played is a real eccentric . &quot; He ' s into cheap clothes . The clothes he designs are old clothes that are restructured . He always speaks his mind , whereas a lot of the other designers in the film are more covert and competitive. &quot; * He also stars in the HBO film &quot; The Enemy Within , &quot; about a political coup in the United States in the near future , due out later this summer . He will then be seen in &quot; Jason ' s Lyric , &quot; a feature directed by Doug McHenry due out_in the fall , a powerful drama in which the actor plays an abusive father killed by one of his two sons . This week , he reports to work_on Wayne Wang ' s &quot; Smoke , &quot; about a long-estranged father and son , starring with William Hurt and Harvey Keitel . Later this year , he moves_back into the director ' s chair for 20th Century Fox ' s screen adaptation of the best-selling Terry McMillan novel &quot; Waiting to Exhale. &quot; Despite the fact that the film ' s major characters are all women , he says &quot; Exhale ' s &quot; subject_matter is universal : &quot; The film explores how people repeat cycles. &quot; A future role he hopes to play is that of legendary boxer Joe Louis , although that project is definitely off the front burner for now . He frets that by the time he ' s free_of his other commitments he may be too old to play the boxer . &quot; At some point , I ' ll probably just direct -- and write , &quot; he says . &quot; I don ' t know what it is that I ' m still trying to figure ( out ) -- there ' s something I need to figure out. &quot; Whitaker , who is divorced and has a 4-year-old son , Ocean Alexander , refuses to shed any but the dimmest light on his personal life . Instead , he is single-mindedly focused_on his career and thinks that time is really his only enemy . &quot; I wish I could feel it like when I was a kid . I could see the holidays coming . A year seemed like seven or eight when I was a kid . Now I need to stop and take_stock -- that ' s why I ' m probably not going_to be acting forever. &quot;</TEXT>
