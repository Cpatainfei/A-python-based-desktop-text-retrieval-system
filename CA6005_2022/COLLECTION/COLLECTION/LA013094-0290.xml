   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; SHATTERED AMERICANA ; DAMAGE IN QUAINT DOWNTOWN FILLMORE MAY BE TOO GREAT TO OVERCOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They have been the backbone of Fillmore for decades . Passing their shops from father to son , they have kept main_street alive . Together they have preserved a slice of small-town Americana so pleasant that movie crews flock there to recapture an era lost to tract homes and shopping_malls . But now , with their grit tested to the limit , some business owners on downtown Fillmore ' s Central Avenue say they don ' t know if they can ever recoup what they lost two weeks ago in the most devastating earthquake in Ventura County history . Officials of this small oil-and-farm town say the city has the pluck to bounce_back from $ 250 million in damage . But Fillmore is a town in mourning . &quot; It ' s like losing family , &quot; said gun shop owner Gary Creagle . &quot; People are already coming_up_to me and saying , ' We miss downtown . What are we going_to do without downtown. ' &quot; The shock of the Jan . 17 quake is wearing_off , and merchants are facing a reality harsher than they thought possible just two weeks ago . &quot; People are discouraged , &quot; said Creagle , a former mayor . &quot; Reality is setting in. &quot; Buffeted day-to-day by engineering reports that are ever gloomier , shopkeepers who spoke confidently of reconstruction a week ago , are now wondering if they can afford to rebuild at a cost of $ 200 # 000 to $ 300 # 000 . Before the quake , Central Avenue was a bustling main_street . Shoppers often had to drive the block five times to find a parking spot . But profits were never large . And many building owners say adding new reconstruction loans on top of old mortgages does not make economic sense . Owners of half_a_dozen buildings with 14 shops -- nearly all built of brick and mortar between 1910 and 1925 -- say they will tear_down their structures and not rebuild . They say they are too old to start from scratch . About half of Central Avenue ' s 55 merchants say they don ' t know where they will end_up in the months to come . Nearly half of their shops are red-tagged as being too dangerous to enter . Most of the rest are marked unsafe . A high mesh-wire fence keeps the public away . Visitors wear hard_hats to survey the damage . &quot; People are finding_out it ' s too expensive to rebuild . So it ' s like , ' Mark us red . We ' re outta here , ' &quot; said Janet Foy , whose flower shop has little damage , but whose neighbors are increasingly distraught . &quot; We ' ve heard a_few more negative things . Today has been a bad day. &quot; But even as merchants mourned their losses and pondered reconstructions that do not pencil out , they said they love their small_town and don ' t want to go anywhere else . They like the fact that they graduated from the same high_school as their grandfathers , that their moms jerked sodas at Clough ' s drug store and that the all-male Fillmore Club is reputed to have met for cards and meals at a second-story Central Avenue walk-up every second Monday of every month since World_War I . And some merchants said they are certain Fillmore -- destroyed by fire in 1903 , swamped by flood_in 1928 , rocked by at least three strong earthquakes this century -- will ride_out its latest catastrophe . &quot; We had the flood , and we had a real depression . We had rationing and price_controls . So we ' ll stay in business , &quot; said Harvey Patterson , 74 , who began to work in his father ' s Central Avenue hardware_store at the age of 10 . His own daughter plans to one day take_over the family_business . Indeed , as search-and-rescue crews entered cracked buildings to retrieve valuables last week , some merchants showed a resiliency that they say will bring Fillmore through its current trial . Foy is selling flowers and Patterson is peddling hardware out of their stores ' back_doors . Double Deal is handing_out pizzas in its alleyway . Grocer Jesse Segovia moved_into a storefront across the street from his battered 83-year-old market and struggles on . Ben Aparicio moved his tax business back into his house , and Darrell Garner relocated his plumbing store to a different shop away from downtown . Other merchants retrieved their goods and pondered a city offer to set_up storefronts out of trailers or tents in a park next to Central Avenue . ' The Show ' Locals_call the 77-year-old Fillmore Theater , at the precise center of the town ' s central business_district , &quot; The Show. &quot; Its bright , new red-and-white marquee still announces &quot; Beethoven ' s 2nd , &quot; the last picture before the Jan . 17 quake . As the only movie_theater along the 50 miles between Ventura and Santa Clarita , it lured customers from miles around . But now a key wall has collapsed . Demolition is expected . And many residents say they regret the theater ' s passing . &quot; that ' s one of the things that hurts me more_than anything else , &quot; Fire_Chief Pat Askren said . &quot; A lot of little towns don ' t have their own theater . I ' m going_to miss it if it doesn ' t come back. &quot; The Show is important to a town like Fillmore because it had continued to draw not only teen-agers but old-timers who had once paid 20 cents to see its first talking pictures . &quot; I was there when the first sound movie came_to town , &quot; Patterson recalled . &quot; It was ' Hells Angels , ' and in the very first scene there was a plane diving at us with its machine_gun going . Every kid hit the floor. &quot; The theater still brings the young to town after dark and customers to the street . &quot; People around here aren ' t real wealthy , and it ' s a nice source of fun . I don ' t know where we ' d go otherwise , &quot; said Gabe Asenas , proprietor of the Fillmore Billiard Parlor , a teen-age hangout a_few doors away . But the owner of the Fillmore Theater building , Dale Larson , is 76 years old and not in a position to think_about starting over . &quot; Right now I ' m just planning on demolishing the building and having the plot for sale. &quot; Hal Graves has run The Show since 1983 . At age 52 , he said he ' s young enough to build a new theater if he can just get a low-interest disaster loan from the federal_government . &quot; My life interest is movie_theaters , &quot; Graves said . &quot; So I ' m sure going to try. &quot; Already residents are talking_about a &quot; Save The Show &quot; campaign on cable TV . And city officials , who spent $ 13 # 000 on the theater ' s new marquee when they spruced_up the downtown a_few years ago , want to salvage it and store it at City_Hall . &quot; that ' s just in case there is ever a theater here again , &quot; Graves said . And in a development late Friday , hope emerged that The Show might avoid demolition after all . City_Manager Roy Payne said state preservationists insist the theater is not beyond repair and have presented calculations that suggest reconstruction might be feasible . Domino Effect Feared What finally happens to the Fillmore Theater and other badly damaged Central Avenue businesses may depend_on disaster aid . U.S. Small Business Administration representatives are in town doling out application_forms , but no loans so far . &quot; Everybody ' s getting more confused and frustrated as we go_along , &quot; said Ron Stewart , 44 , whose grandfather started Ballard Furniture 57 years ago . Stewart bought the building from his mother four years ago . His sister ' s manicure shop is one of his three tenants . Stewart figures it would cost him perhaps $ 250 # 000 to rebuild , &quot; so financially I would be better_off to just tear it down and start over , &quot; he said . Of course , he said , he couldn ' t afford the mortgage on the reconstruction loan . &quot; It just sounds like a lot of us are going_to be out a lot of money , or just out , period , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' d like to carry_on . What else am I going_to do ? My life ' s work has been in this business. &quot; Weighing heavily on Stewart , and on store owners close to the Fillmore Theater , however , is the question of what will happen to their businesses if the theater comes_down . Many of the Central Avenue stores have common walls , as was the practice 80 years ago . The strength of one store relies_on its next-door neighbor , as have the merchants themselves . But when one building falls , the others are threatened in a domino effect , several merchants said . Garner ' s plumbing and hardware_stores share a wall with Stewart ' s building . And Garner shares a wall with The Show . &quot; The theater has dominoed me , &quot; Garner said . &quot; I ' m yellow tagged now . They ' re letting me get all my stuff out of my store before they tag it red. &quot; The fear runs in both directions from the Fillmore Theater . Aparicio , 44 , whose building also abuts the movie_house , said he ' s concerned . &quot; If they demolish that , then there ' s a high probability my building might also have to go , &quot; he said . &quot; I haven ' t received a notice of demolition . But a_few ( city ) engineers told me they ' re considering that. &quot; After building a tax preparation business to 3 # 000 clients , Aparicio said he and a relative bought his 1918 storefront four years ago for $ 250 # 000 . They invested another $ 50 # 000 in improvements last year . Then the earth shook furiously in Fillmore , wiping_out a lifetime of effort in mere seconds . Aparicio said he hopes to rebuild and save a building that has helped establish Fillmore ' s character . &quot; We all chose Fillmore because of the uniqueness of its architecture and its small-town feel , &quot; he said . &quot; But if any improvement through demolition or repair will bring this building_up to code , then I ' m for it . It needs to be done. &quot; Tenants along Central Avenue tend to agree . They realize what could have happened if the 6.6-magnitude earthquake had occurred at 9:30 a.m. rather than five hours earlier . &quot; I won ' t go_back into those old buildings , &quot; chiropractor David Erickson said . &quot; I ' d rather work in an ugly building and be safe. &quot; But as Fillmore city officials moved quickly last week to demolish old , unsound buildings and rebuild from there , state and federal authorities intervened . On Tuesday , the city announced that it would tear_down 14 buildings , including five Central Avenue structures that contain 13 different businesses . Included were the Central Market , the Fillmore Theater , the Fillmore health clinic , the landmark Masonic Building and a small structure next to it . On Friday , the state Office of Historic Preservation refused to allow any buildings to be razed , saying that its own inspections indicate that every Central Avenue structure can be saved . Distinctiveness Lost But building owners say they don ' t have the money for costly reconstruction . And state representatives acknowledge that ultimately they cannot stop demolitions . &quot; I think it ' s going_to be really changed when those buildings come_down , &quot; said Santa Paula architectural historian Judith Triem , who recommended against demolition . &quot; What was so good was that it was so cohesive . And when you take those buildings out , you have holes . And it ' s never really the same again. &quot; Part of Fillmore ' s distinctiveness will be lost , she said . &quot; This whole valley -- Fillmore , Piru and Santa Paula -- is like a step back in time , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s like a time warp , really . It reflects a sort of frozen-in-time place that doesn ' t go much past the 1930s. &quot; City officials say they must move forward by replacing unsound buildings with new ones designed to withstand quakes . And they note that a new city architectural policy requires all new downtown construction to generally match the brick-and-awning style of existing buildings . &quot; We want to keep it like it is , good old Fillmore , &quot; Segovia said . He plans to repair his 1911 corner market , which greets visitors as they enter the one-block downtown core . Segovia is one of several longtime owners whose structures are severely damaged but who said they never considered tearing_down a historical building that could be repaired . Robert C . Harmonson and his wife , Laura , said they expect to quickly repair the two buildings their separate families have owned since 1906 and 1929 . Several shops are already open and inspectors downgraded the danger of several others on Friday . Still , city officials say it could be 18 months before Central Avenue is fully recovered . And some merchants think that estimate is optimistic . &quot; I think it will be back to normal , but it will not be done for three or four years , &quot; Robert Harmonson said . &quot; Hopefully , in my lifetime I ' ll see it back the way it was a month ago. &quot; Fillmore Damage Historic Downtown Suffers Following Quake No city in Ventura County was more devastated by the Jan . 17 earthquake than Fillmore , a town of 13 # 000 residents founded in 1888 on a new railroad_line from Saugus to Ventura . The worst of the city ' s estimated $ 250 million in damage was_on Central Avenue , the heart of the downtown business_district . Most shops -- built of unreinforced brick and mortar between 1900 and 1925 -- suffered severe damage . Twenty-five businesses have been red-tagged as dangerous , 17 are yellow-tagged for limited entry and 13 are safe to enter . Key buildings that may be demolished include the Masonic Building , Fillmore Theater , Central Market and the Fillmore health clinic .
