   <HEADLINE> STUNNING BLOW FOR A HIRED GUN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rumors started last summer , just a_few months after Clint Reilly took_over Kathleen Brown ' s gubernatorial campaign . Soon , the talk was so prevalent that some people suspected that Reilly , a San Francisco-based political consultant , had started it himself . Everyone knew that Reilly was a close friend of Tony Coelho , the ex-California congressman whom President Clinton had named chief strategist to the Democratic National Committee . Some speculated that with Coelho ' s help , Reilly -- who helped elect the current mayors of Los Angeles and San Francisco -- could be positioning himself to manage Clinton ' s reelection effort . There was one caveat : Before Reilly could burst onto the national stage , he would have to lead Brown to victory over Gov . Pete Wilson . In the wake of Brown ' s crushing defeat , the talk swirling around the controversial Reilly could not be more different from the scuttlebutt of months past . Especially since a week or so ago , when a Clinton_Administration official told reporters that &quot; Reilly should be tried_for political malpractice , &quot; the mercurial consultant ' s future has been widely debated among political insiders . Spurring the criticism was Reilly ' s admission that he had to pull Brown ' s TV commercials off the air the last weekend before the election because the campaign was out of money . Many consultants found this appalling because the Brown campaign had raised $ 24 million -- more_than any other Democratic campaign ever in California . Moreover , even campaigns with far less money had managed to save their firepower for the final weeks , when more voters were paying_attention . By canceling its ad time , some say , the Brown campaign sent a signal that it was conceding defeat , thus allowing Wilson to divert more_than $ 500 # 000 from his own effort to help Republican candidates for other positions get elected . &quot; This cost us probably the ( state ) Assembly , probably two down-ballot seats , and we pulled two others out by the skin of our teeth , &quot; said a political consultant who was involved in the campaign of another Democrat on the 1994 ticket . &quot; If Clint Reilly were a real_estate_agent and handled a client ' s money the way he handled the resources of this campaign , he would be sued and convicted for criminal malfeasance , &quot; said this consultant , who charged that Reilly had spent too_much during the summer months , failing to save money for the end . The consultant noted that Reilly made a commission on every TV ad that was produced , so he had an incentive to produce a lot of them . A Republican consultant echoed this view , saying Brown ' s money troubles -- combined with the revelation that before Reilly signed_on with Brown , he had discussed possible roles in the campaigns of Wilson and U.S. Rep . Mike Huffington -- will &quot; hurt Reilly with the Democratic Party. &quot; &quot; If he had won , they might have overlooked it , &quot; this consultant said . &quot; But given how much money the campaign spent , and given that it ran_out of money at the end , I think that will doom him from getting any major Democrats &quot; in the future . Reilly said that the criticism does not surprise him , but that it is misplaced . &quot; I get the credit when they win and I deserve a fair measure of the blame when they lose . . . . ( But ) in hindsight all things are clear , &quot; he said . He asserted that if Brown had aired ads during the last weekend , it would not have changed the outcome . And he said if she had not spent money during the summer months , she would have been even farther behind . &quot; After the primary , we were down by a sizable margin , &quot; he said . &quot; And I think we correctly assessed that if we went passively through the summer we probably would have been behind 20 points . We would have been in an irretrievable situation. &quot; Reilly declined to talk_about how much money his firm made on the Brown campaign or on what Brown ' s loss would mean for his future . Darry Sragow , who ran Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi ' s campaign against Brown in the Democratic gubernatorial primary , said campaigns are far too big and complicated to be blamed on any one person . While he said political consultants ' &quot; rule No . 1 is you don ' t run_out of money before you run_out of campaign , &quot; he maintained that anyone who predicts Reilly ' s professional demise is a fool . &quot; I was answering these same questions the day after Clint Reilly fired Dianne Feinstein in public , &quot; said Sragow , who worked for Feinstein ' s gubernatorial campaign in 1989 when Reilly -- then Feinstein ' s campaign manager -- sent_out a fax announcing that he was quitting . &quot; Everybody was saying any consultant who did what he did then is ejected , is out of here , is not running any campaign on the planet Earth . And he went_on to work for Kathleen Brown . . . . He ' s been written_off many times before . He ' s by no means dead. &quot;</TEXT>
