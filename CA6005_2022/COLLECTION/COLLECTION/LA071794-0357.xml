   <HEADLINE> 6 GRUELING MONTHS -- AND NOW THE HARD PART ; EARTHQUAKE : FUTURE STILL UNCERTAIN HALF A YEAR AFTER JAN . 17 DISASTER . ' IN A SENSE , WE ' VE JUST BEGUN. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It began with a region rising from a night of death and cataclysm and fear , binding the wounds and taking the first_steps toward recovery . Soon the tales of heroes and rescues were replaced by a litany of mounting damage and disturbing questions about the safety of the buildings in which we sleep , work and park our cars . Today , six months later , the most destructive earthquake in U.S. history has left a legacy of momentous violence , staggering loss , awesome compassion and courage , and great achievements . It also presents an uncertain future of faltering insurers , a federal_government struggling under the burden of the costliest U.S. domestic disaster , and a state and city without the resources to repair and rebuild businesses and housing . Scientists still cannot agree on where , exactly , the Northridge earthquake struck . And there is hardly any more sense of resolution in the numbers rising out of the damage inflicted from East Los Angeles and Glendale to Ventura County . In Los Angeles , 20 # 089 dwellings have been abandoned , and almost 30 # 000 more are at risk . Some 86 # 393 structures of all types were damaged . Half the 200 # 000 Southland applicants for the main federal relief program have been turned_down . Five hundred_thousand tons of debris remain to be cleared , almost as much as has been taken_away since the quake hit . Hundreds of steel-frame buildings , which before January were thought relatively invulnerable , have yet to be inspected for the sort of cracking discovered after the quake that mystified and alarmed engineers . In the hard-hit San Fernando Valley , 84 % of all residents report some quake damage , and 30 % say they have suffered financial reverses because of the disaster , according to a Los Angeles Times poll conducted last weekend . In Ventura County , which suffered more_than $ 700 million in damage , hundreds of homes and businesses in Fillmore and Simi Valley have been repaired and reoccupied . But Fillmore lost one-third of its vital business_district . Piru ' s tiny downtown remains fenced and dark . And hundreds more property_owners are grappling with repair bills that reach_into the six figures -- some weighing whether they should fix_up or walk away . Behind the numbers is a simple fact : It has taken most of the first six months of relentless struggle merely to understand the scope of the quake , and restore utilities and public transportation . The hard part is just beginning . &quot; The earthquake aftermath is characterized in two phases , &quot; said Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan . &quot; Response -- that time immediately after the disaster -- and recovery , which is everything from now on. &quot; &quot; In a sense , we ' ve just begun the long road to recovery. &quot; It was four months before what may become this earthquake ' s signature phenomenon was identified : &quot; ghost_towns , &quot; areas where destruction was so concentrated that vandalism and decay threatened to wreck what the earthquake had left . Amid all that has been rebuilt , the most disquieting image may be the 164-unit Northridge Meadows Apartments , still standing and still drawing the curious , who peer into the crushed living_spaces where 16 tenants died . Survivors were given until last Friday to remove their belongings , and demolition is about to begin . But the litigation over who is responsible_for the collapse , like the recovery itself , will go_on for years . The end is too far in the future to see , and the cost still anyone ' s guess . The federal_government has allocated $ 12 billion to cover everything from cash grants for individuals to reimbursing local and state_governments for repairs_to public facilities such_as freeways . Local and state officials are still desperately lobbying for more . The Federal Emergency Management Agency has issued 376 # 693 checks , averaging $ 2 # 834 each , for emergency repairs . The agency has also agreed to pay $ 714 million for public facilities and projects . Private money continues to pour into the recovery in quantities that may never be tallied . Twenty million for ARCO ' s damage to the Santa Clara River and a neighborhood in San Fernando caused by oil-pipeline ruptures . For repairs_to AT &amp; T ' s eight-story Ventura Boulevard telephone switching building , $ 11 million . And CalArts , a small arts college in Valencia , will spend $ 19 million for repairs so far , borrowing to pay 300 workers . One of the biggest victims may turn_out to be an insurance_company . From an estimate of $ 4.5 billion in April , insurance carriers have increased their projected losses to $ 6 billion . And that could climb , posing a potential crisis in the availability of earthquake and homeowners insurance across the state . Losing nearly two-thirds of its operating surplus in projected payouts of $ 600 million , Valley-based 20th Century Insurance Co . announced it would stop selling earthquake insurance immediately and phase_out all homeowners coverage over the next two years . Farmers Insurance Group , Allstate Insurance Cos . and many smaller companies have also cut_back on selling earthquake insurance , and tightened_up on selling new homeowners policies . Price increases are almost certainly on the way . Nor is there any accounting of the human cost -- in disrupted lives , depleted bank_accounts , and lost homes and businesses . Thousands of earthquake victims still await word on their requests for Small Business Administration loans . And thousands of others have been denied assistance , primarily because of their weak financial_condition . The rejection rate for SBA loans has been close to 50 % , higher than for either Hurricane Andrew or the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake . The SBA ' s strict eligibility requirements mystify property_owners such_as Ray Shouhed , an Iranian immigrant whose $ 500 # 000 investment in a half block of Reseda Boulevard storefronts turned_to dust Jan . 17 . Shouhed said that after completing a foot-thick application and waiting six months , his SBA loan_application was turned_down last week , with the agency saying his cash flow was insufficient . The previous owner has initiated foreclosure . &quot; It ' s all_over , &quot; Shouhed said with a self-conscious smile . &quot; What can I do ? &quot; And then there are the costs not yet imposed , such_as the price_tag on future seismic safety requirements . This week , the Los Angeles City_Council will consider ordering the owners of about 600 steel-frame buildings in the San Fernando Valley and Wilshire Corridor to inspect for damage . Meanwhile , repairs continue on dozens of damaged buildings despite experts ' doubts that the methods are effective . The potentially life-threatening failure of several concrete parking garages , some built under the latest seismic requirements , is forcing building officials and structural engineers to re-examine previously accepted construction methods . A seismic retrofitting program to be announced soon could require costly improvements to thousands more steel , wood-frame and concrete structures , said Nicolino Delli Quadri , earthquake spokesman for the Los Angeles Building and Safety Department . How well is the recovery progressing ? that ' s a question that comes under the heading of beauty in the eye of the beholder . For tourists and commuters , the picture is not nearly so bleak as it remains for students and some property_owners . Hoping to lessen a drop_in tourism that has hit $ 308 million , the Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau has launched a multimillion-dollar advertising_campaign called &quot; Play L.A. &quot; &quot; It ' s designed to tell people that we are OK , &quot; said Gary Sherwin , spokesman for the bureau . That image of a city boldly grasping its destiny was bolstered by the extraordinary repair of Southern California ' s world-famous freeway system . Fears of up_to a year of commuter horrors were put to rest by an incentive_program rewarding speedy work . The opening of the Santa Monica Freeway in April , two months early , earned a $ 15-million bonus for contractor C.C. Myers . The ramps that remain closed on the freeway will be reopened Friday , four days ahead of schedule , Gov . Pete Wilson just announced . In May , the contractor on the downed Golden State Freeway over Gavin Canyon also finished more_than a month early , restoring Southern California ' s commercial lifeline to the rest of the state . And key portions of the interchange between the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways were reopened earlier this month . Only the Simi Valley Freeway , whose old surface is still being ground into a mountain of rubble as cars squeeze_by in three lanes , remains to be fully restored . Resumption of nearly normal freeway travel may have appeared to herald a quick completion of the recovery process for a majority of Southern Californians . But such optimism faded with the identification in May of 13 ghost_towns in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood . These areas , where there did not appear to be enough money or will to rebuild , raised the specter of large pockets that could become intractable villages for scavengers , vandals and blight . City and law-enforcement officials moved quickly to clear_out trespassers , erect fences and hire security_guards . Owners and lenders were contacted . A row of abandoned apartments on Hubbard Street , one of the most precarious ghost_towns , was heading en masse into foreclosure , said city housing consultant Rich Wallach . Hoping for city intervention , the lenders have agreed to work with all but one of the owners to restructure the debt and rebuild , Wallach said . City officials expect the rebuilding to last up_to two years . Though perhaps the most dramatic example , ghost_towns represent only a small fraction of the damaged and endangered housing . The 20 # 089 dwellings still vacant because of quake damage are down from 33 # 033 on April 1 , the city reported last week . So far , 26 # 841 building_permits have been issued . Because there is no procedure for tracking final inspections , officials have no idea how many of those have been completed . In general , they say , early projects tended to be light repairs and rebuilding walls . Heavy construction -- such_as a Sherman Oaks apartment_building being lifted hydraulically so its first_floor could be reconstructed -- has begun in_earnest only in recent weeks . In Santa Monica , where 30 % of the city was declared a redevelopment zone to help with the recovery , only one in four of the 1 # 900 housing units rendered uninhabitable have been repaired . Those trying to fund repairs who have been turned_down by the SBA have a last_resort : the Los Angeles Housing Department , which has cobbled federal grants and bond financing into a fund that could reach $ 200 million to work with the toughest cases . State and local officials had planned a program three times that size until Wilson canceled it after California voters rejected a proposed bond issue for quake relief last month . Also to aid those turned_down by the SBA , Riordan said the federal Economic Development Administration will soon announce a $ 30-million revolving loan program to help restructure their loan portfolios . The council also is considering the creation of redevelopment &quot; recovery zones &quot; to offer tax increment financing for long-term recovery . Santa Monica officials are also seeking more federal help to assist business owners and to shore_up the Pacific Palisades bluffs . Some things will never be the same . Veterans Administration officials have decided against rebuilding the crippled hospital in Sepulveda . Such trendy Ventura Boulevard spots as Johnny Rockets and Cafe Cordiale in Sherman Oaks will not reopen , at least in their old spots . One of the most seriously damaged hospitals , St . John ' s Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica , will house only about half the 501 beds and employ half the 2 # 000 workers it had before the quake when it reopens Oct . 3 . Trish Bartel , a spokeswoman for the hospital , said the downsizing probably would have occurred anyway because of changes under way in the health-care system . &quot; We think the new St . John ' s will represent a more accurate vision of the future . The future means more outpatient services , more in-home care , less of a need for in-patient beds , &quot; she said . But plenty of others are coming_back stronger in spite of the quake . County health officials say they believe much of the estimated $ 400 million in federal earthquake repair dollars they expect to receive will be used to build a new , $ 1.3-billion hospital that will replace the existing County-USC Medical_Center . Outside the Valley , the most expensive earthquake repairs -- millions of dollars more_than that of the Santa Monica Freeway -- are at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum . Originally estimated at $ 35 million , the cost to fix a deep crack around the upper concourse , the weakened historic peristyle and the wrecked press_box will run between $ 50 million and $ 60 million . Enough of the work is expected to be completed by the end of the summer to allow the Raiders and USC to play football in the stadium this fall . The pace of school repairs has been nowhere near as fast . Students across the region will return in September to barricades and yellow tape , cracks in ceiling and floor tiles and possibly unusable gymnasiums and auditoriums . Damage at schools ranged from the abandonment of Van Gogh Elementary in Granada Hills for a new site to minor cracks in ceilings and walls at other campuses across the massive Los Angeles Unified School District . Soon after the earthquake , Supt . Sid Thompson said he wanted the 160 damaged schools -- with total damage expected to be between $ 300 million and $ 600 million -- to be either completely or partially repaired by January . But it appears that goal will elude him . Hoping to make the repairs without dipping_into the school_system ' s own coffers , the cash-short district has delayed the work while it pursues federal and state aid . The district has so far received about $ 70 million from FEMA and has spent about $ 17 million on building repairs , safety and structural inspections and the replacement of lost or damaged textbooks , supplies and equipment . Schools outside the giant L.A. district were also hard hit . Alemany and L.A. Baptist high_schools in the San Fernando Valley were forced to erect temporary facilities while they wait for repairs_to be made on their gyms . Hart High in Santa Clarita will demolish its gym over the summer and will use other facilities in the coming year . It will be years before Cal State Northridge picks_up the pieces after suffering $ 350 million in damage , the greatest loss from a natural disaster ever suffered by a U.S. university . Although desperate preparations got the campus open only two weeks late for the spring semester , enrollment was down to 24 # 813 , the lowest since 1974 . Campus officials anticipate another enrollment decline this fall despite harried efforts to ready student housing , the Oviatt Library and other buildings for the first day of classes . Most classes , along with the campus art_gallery , in fact , will be housed in several hundred portable classrooms trucked onto the campus last spring . Construction , fueled by $ 163 million in federal assistance so far approved , will continue across the 353-acre campus for years to come . Looking_into the future , economists see the earthquake as a minor irritant along Southern California ' s long road back to economic recovery . &quot; This seems to be coming_in as a very small event , &quot; said Larry Kimbell , director of UCLA ' s Business Forecasting Project . &quot; I haven ' t seen any sign the quake has had a big impact &quot; despite the billions of dollars of aid . He said the quake ' s long-term net economic effect will be only slightly negative . Compared to 800 # 000 jobs lost statewide since 1990 , UCLA forecasters see a net loss of 30 # 000 attributable to the earthquake . After an initial jump in January , Los Angeles County unemployment_rates quickly returned to about 9.7 % -- the annual average for 1993 -- and have remained stable since February . Retail workers were hard hit because several large shopping_centers and department_stores were too damaged to reopen immediately . Overall , 9 # 400 retail jobs have been lost since January . But as malls and shops gradually reopen , many of the unemployed are returning to work . In May , the last month for which data is available , 1 # 700 people found work in retail businesses . Conversely , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , almost 5 # 000 new construction jobs were created in Los Angeles County -- the largest jump in more_than two years -- between January and March . Analysts say the construction boom will continue at least through the rest of the year . Vacancy levels for industrial and research space in the San Fernando Valley and adjoining areas dipped only slightly after the quake before returning to their earlier level of 14 % . according to CB Commercial Real_Estate Group Inc. , which tracks 95-million square_feet in the region . Retail sales in the city of Los Angeles fell from $ 1.9 billion in November to nearly $ 1.7 billion in January and February , but the numbers for March and April came_back to around $ 1.9 billion , according to the federal_government . The hardest-hit mall was Northridge Fashion Center . Workers recently completed the removal of asbestos and will soon begin structural repairs . The mall is_due to reopen in mid-March , 1995 , although its six anchor stores are expected to reopen at various times between November and next August . All four of its parking structures will be rebuilt , including one that collapsed in the quake and three others that were damaged . Apart from the returning department_stores , mall general_manager Lloyd Miller said it is too early to tell how many of its 200 smaller shops will decide to reopen . At the Sherman Oaks Galleria , the Robinsons-May anchor store partly reopened Thursday . At the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square , closed for two months , Broadway and Bullocks have also partly reopened and 92 smaller stores have returned , with 23 more in the process . Only four will not reopen . For some Los Angeles institutions , the generosity of others has proved inspirational . The county ' s emergency medical system didn ' t have enough staff to help the thousands who sought medical help , and special medical teams were called_in from as far away as New Mexico . Impressed by the job they did , medical officials in Los Angeles are organizing their own teams , which will be available for future disasters . Los Angeles Fire_Department Engine Company 70 , which got help from out-of-town urban search and rescue teams pulling survivors from the Northridge Meadows Apartments , has been named the city ' s first such team , and will undertake training this year . At the state level , politicians have yet to find a way to fund California ' s share of the cost of rebuilding . Unlike after Northern California ' s Loma Prieta quake , when the governor and legislators quickly settled_on a temporary gasoline_tax increase , jittery politicians passed the buck to voters this election year . The defeat of the earthquake bond proposal means California is left with no new source of funding to cover the 10 % of the repair costs ( the federal_government pays the other 90 % ) to build highways , schools and colleges . Legislators moved quickly to require that mobile_homes -- one in 10 of which was rendered uninhabitable in Los Angeles County -- be securely attached_to their foundations . Other proposals would offer property- and income-tax relief to quake victims , and allow withdrawal without penalty from retirement accounts_for earthquake repair costs . Surprisingly , the most extensively measured earthquake in history has given scientists almost as much to debate as politicians . It is not settled , for instance , whether the earthquake occurred on a thrust_fault branching off from the Elysian Park system , or on a hitherto-unknown easterly extension of the Oak Ridge fault from Ventura County . The shaking intensities seemed among the highest ever recorded , until some scientists suggested a reason : No such recordings were taken_in most previous big quakes . That debate may compound the difficulty of rewriting seismic safety codes . Most people relate earthquakes to comfort and safety , not science . And on that score , the overriding lesson has been that quick reaction paid_off . Frank Kishton , coordinating officer for FEMA and a 22-year veteran of disaster relief , said he has never seen a better blending of federal , state and local efforts . &quot; In a matter of days , a multibillion-dollar corporation was established with a 500 # 000 customer base . . . over 10 # 000 federal , state and local employees . . . ( in ) 80 offices . That got set_up in a matter of a week of 10 days , &quot; Kishton said . &quot; You look_at K mart or Sears . They spend years putting stuff on the drawing board. &quot; * IMMOBILE HOMES : Bill to bolt_down mobile_homes goes_to Wilson . B1 * INSURANCE PINCH : Insurers balk at providing quake coverage .
