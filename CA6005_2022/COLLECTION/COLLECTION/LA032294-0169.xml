   <HEADLINE> JUSTICE DEPT . SETTLEMENT BARS DENYING CARE TO AIDS PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seeking to send &quot; a clear message &quot; to stop discrimination against AIDS patients , the Justice_Department on Monday settled a discrimination suit with Philadelphia that bars emergency medical personnel from refusing assistance to those with the disease . The settlement , the first involving an AIDS case under the Americans with Disabilities Act , also will require training for each of the city ' s 2 # 300 firefighters and emergency medical workers on preventing the transmission of HIV , respecting a person ' s right_to_privacy while rendering medical_care and being sensitive to the needs of persons with HIV or AIDS . In January , 1993 , Philadelphia emergency medical technicians allegedly refused to place on a stretcher a man lying on the ground and complaining of chest_pains . They had asked the man if he was_on any medication and he had whispered that he was taking AZT , a drug used to treat persons with HIV . One of the technicians then allegedly yelled , &quot; Oh my God , he has AIDS , &quot; according to Merrily Friedlander , a Civil Rights division attorney , and the technicians told the man to place himself on the stretcher . When he was unable to do so , a bystander helped him onto the stretcher and placed him in the ambulance . &quot; Today ' s settlement will send a clear message to all cities across the nation that we will not tolerate discrimination against persons with AIDS , &quot; said James P . Turner , acting assistant attorney_general for civil_rights . Such discrimination is barred by Title II of the disabilities act . Under the settlement , the man , whose name was withheld but who was described as a student in his 20s , will receive $ 10 # 000 in compensatory damages and a formal written apology from the city . In addition , the city must develop and make public a written policy that prohibits emergency medical technicians from discriminating against those with HIV or AIDS . The city also will be required to discipline any employee who fails to comply with its guidelines . The complaint that led to the settlement was filed by the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania .</TEXT>
