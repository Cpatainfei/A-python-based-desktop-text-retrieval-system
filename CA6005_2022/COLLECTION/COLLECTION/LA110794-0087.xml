   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 4TH SENATE DISTRICT ; PROP . 187 SERVING AS BACKDROP IN YET ANOTHER RACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the dusty farmlands of the Sacramento Valley , a Republican state legislator is campaigning as hard against illegal immigrants as he is against his Democratic opponent . But in an ironic twist to an ugly race , freshman Sen . K . Maurice Johannessen of Redding finds his own legal_status under_fire from Democratic challenger Mike McGowan of West Sacramento . &quot; I ' m not the one who entered this country illegally , you are , &quot; McGowan , 47 , charges in a television spot directed at Johannessen . &quot; I am not an illegal alien , &quot; insists Johannessen , 60 , who nevertheless has said he &quot; jumped ship &quot; at San Pedro in 1952 as a 17-year-old merchant seaman from Norway . He says he was detained , deported briefly to Mexico , returned to California and became a naturalized citizen while in the Army . &quot; At no time was I illegal , &quot; Johannessen said in an interview last week . &quot; There was nothing illegal . Now ( the McGowan campaign ) is saying I want to stop everybody else from coming_in . Horse manure. &quot; One Johannessen commercial depicts the purported takeover of a meeting of an unnamed California city_council by a mob of &quot; illegal alien activists &quot; whose shouts drown_out the pledge to the flag . &quot; So , Mr. McGowan , whose side are you on ? &quot; the announcer asks . The outcome in the 4th Senate District , stretching from the northeastern edge of San Francisco Bay to the Oregon line , is one of a handful of races that could determine whether Democrats keep their narrow control of the Senate . Although Democrats in the mostly blue-collar agricultural district outnumber Republicans , 47.7 % to 38.5 % , the region historically has been conservative . Johannessen , a bedrock conservative and wealthy real_estate developer , is seeking a full four-year term in a reapportioned district that is mostly new territory for him . He first took_office seven months ago after a special election . Traditionally , protecting water against export to the south is the most visceral political issue in the rural north . But immigration has overwhelmed water in this campaign . In speeches , mailers and broadcast advertising , Johannessen deplores what he says are waves of Latinos who illegally &quot; come_across the border for a free lunch &quot; of welfare and other benefits . &quot; These are people that violate the laws_of_the_land , &quot; he tells audiences in the accent of his native Norway . He asserts that McGowan is backed by &quot; liberals &quot; in the Legislature who favor benefits for undocumented immigrants . Johannessen is a strong supporter of the Proposition 187 illegal immigration initiative . McGowan also backs the measure , which he says is necessary to pressure the federal_government into paying the costs of illegal immigration in California . But McGowan , a Yolo County supervisor whose guilty plea on a 1984 drunken driving charge has become another campaign issue in recent weeks , claims that Johannessen is more_than a fervent supporter of Proposition 187 . By targeting illegal immigration of Latinos , McGowan says , his opponent practices hypocrisy and &quot; is plugging into the fears and frustrations of Californians. &quot; The seeds of controversy over Johannessen ' s own legal_status were planted several years ago in a television interview in which he said he &quot; jumped ship &quot; at San Pedro to join his immigrant parents in Glendale . In the interview , Johannessen said he was jailed , released and deported briefly to Mexico . Although unable to speak English , Johannessen said he returned to California and joined the Army when he couldn ' t find a civilian job . &quot; When I got_into the service , they did not know I was an alien , &quot; he said . He said he was asked about his lack of English skills and told officials he came from a little village in Minnesota where only Norwegian was spoken . &quot; They bought_it , &quot; he said . Later , he said , the Army helped him obtain citizenship papers , Johannessen said . In an interview with The Times , however , Johannessen amplified on his arrival in California and maintained he was never illegally in the country . He said the term &quot; jump ship &quot; was a &quot; common statement &quot; of immigrants of the early 1950s and was not meant to imply that his departure was &quot; done illegally. &quot; Johannessen said he went directly from the freighter to the immigration office at the San Pedro dock , where he showed officials his passport . He said he was detained overnight as a minor -- but not arrested -- until authorities &quot; called my father to pick me up the next morning. &quot; Three months later , he said , he went_to Tijuana where he &quot; picked_up the permanent ( U.S. residence ) papers . I stepped across the border of Mexico and was given the papers. &quot; He said he went_to Tijuana because U.S. residency documents were required to be issued in a foreign land and Mexico was convenient for him . As for misleading Army authorities by saying he was from a Norwegian town in Minnesota , Johannessen said he did so because he was repeatedly asked by others , &quot; How come you don ' t speak English well ? &quot; &quot; It was driving me bonkers . That was just my way of getting_away from ( the questions ) . I was 18 years old , a kid basically being harassed . It worked , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
