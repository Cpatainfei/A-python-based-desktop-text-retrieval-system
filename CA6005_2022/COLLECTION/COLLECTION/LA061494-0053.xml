   <HEADLINE> ON THE BEACH / JODY BERGER : MACHADO GETS TO STAY CLOSE TO HOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even among surfers , Rob Machado stands_out as extremely relaxed . He ' s also a right-foot first surfer , or goofy footer , in a crowd of lefties . But what really singles him out is the speed with which he has moved to the top of the sport . Machado , 20 , began surfing professionally two years ago and earned rookie of the year honors in 1992 . In 1993 , he became U.S. Surfing champion . Machado , already considered a contender for the 1994 world championship title , enters Wednesday ' s Body Glove Oceanside surf contest as a local and a favorite . Machado grew_up in Cardiff and learned to surf in and around Oceanside , but it ' s not the homecourt advantage he ' s excited about . &quot; The only advantage I ' ll have is sleeping_in my own bed , &quot; he said . &quot; I can just kick_back and cruise up_to the contest when I want. &quot; The Body Glove Oceanside is the sixth stop on the Bud Surf Tour , the national circuit that feeds the world tour . In a double-elimination format that culminates with finals Sunday , surfers will compete for $ 20 # 000 and 1 # 000 points on the world qualifying tour . The top 16 surfers in points earned at the end of the year earn a spot on the World Championship Tour the next year . Many surfers , including Machado , compete on both levels . With world tour dates in Australia , France , Brazil and Hawaii , and national tour dates in Hawaii , Virginia and all_over the California coast , Machado spends little time at_home . &quot; This is the longest I ' ll be home for a while , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ll be home for a month . Usually I ' m home for only a week or two. &quot; Machado ' s most recent trip was a 10-day stay_on Habara Beach , Japan . Competing in the Marui Pro , the second stop of the 10-event tour , he scored his first world tour victory . With $ 130 # 000 in purse money and former world champions Kelly Slater and Derek Ho in the water , it was clearly Machado ' s biggest victory . And yet he ' s not feeling any pressure to repeat . Each day of the five-day Oceanside contest , he ' ll leave his parents ' house in Cardiff an hour or 1 1 / 2 hours before he needs to be in the water . He ' ll arrive_at the beach near the Oceanside pier , survey the scene , surf his heat and head_home . &quot; I ' m just looking_forward to enjoying myself , &quot; he said . &quot; I think competition is something you can do for the wrong reasons . The whole reason I started surfing was to enjoy myself. &quot; Success must have been merely a side_effect . &quot; I just got lucky , &quot; he said of the Marui Pro , and while it might be true , it ' s not the whole story . Machado is known for generating amazing speed in small waves . He ' s at his best when the surf is less than four feet . The final day in Japan , the surf was exactly that -- four feet . * The conditions : Sean Collins of Surfline-Wavetrack , the industry ' s leading wave forecaster , expects surf at Oceanside to be in the waist-to-shoulder-high range , or two to four feet . &quot; Right now it looks_like small swells out of the southwest combining with the local northwest windswell , &quot; Collins said , adding that when there is one pure swell direction in Oceanside , the waves come_in lines , which tends to favor goofy footers . &quot; We will have a little bit of windswell , lefts are going_to be the favorite wave out there , &quot; he said . Said Machado : &quot; It ' s a really good site for a contest . It ' s a beach break , and any kind of swell will get_in there pretty good. &quot; * The competition : Machado ' s main rivalry will come from his friends , as it often does . Taylor Knox of Carlsbad , Chris Brown of Santa Barbara , Dino Andino of San Clemente , Pat O ' Connell of Laguna Niguel , Richie Collins of Newport Beach and Jeff Booth of Laguna Beach also are expected to surf . &quot; I ' m probably friends with half the guys I ' m surfing against , &quot; Machado said . &quot; But you just surf the heat , and when you ' re on the beach , whatever happened is over. &quot; Brown , currently the points leader on the domestic tour , won the Oceanside event last year , defeating Machado in the finals . Booth won the 1991 and 1992 events and the 1987 Oceanside as an amateur . * Up the beach : While spectators watch the final rounds of surfing Saturday and Sunday in Oceanside , farther north women will be competing in the Reebok Hermosa Beach Open as part of the Women ' s Pro Beach Volleyball tour . The double-elimination event in Hermosa and the tournament in Sacramento the next weekend were expected to decide who would compete in the Goodwill Games , July 23 in St . Petersburg , Russia . But because of visa requirements , the deadline for naming players was moved to June 22 and now there is little question who will go . Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan , who won the Hermosa Beach Open last year , have won five of the six 1994 WPVA tour events , and finished second in the other . With 460 points , they are 64 points ahead of their nearest competitors . Barbra Fontana and Lori Kotas-Forsythe defeated Kirby / Masakayan on June 5 in the Myrtle Beach Open and finished second to the leaders in two other tournaments . Fontana / Kotas-Forsythe have 396 points , 40 more_than the third-place team . In the Hermosa Open , now the final event before the deadline , players will earn one point for playing each game and two points for winning . &quot; I ' ve been told the third-place team couldn ' t possibly get enough points with just one event left , &quot; Fontana said . &quot; But that doesn ' t make Hermosa a letdown in any way . I lived there for a number of years , and it ' s just a great place to play. &quot; Fontana grew_up in Manhattan Beach and played volleyball for Mira Costa High_School . She was a four-year starter at Stanford and then earned a law_degree at Santa Clara . She joined the WPVA tour in 1991 and became association president last year . &quot; The Goodwill Games are very exciting . I think all_the athletes have their eyes on the international game , &quot; Fontana said . In 1993 , Fontana and Kotas-Forsythe finished third in the world rankings established by the Federation Internationale de Volleyball of Lausanne , Switzerland ( FIVB ) , which oversees the international game . Kirby and Masakayan were ranked first and a Brazilian team was second . The two-day Hermosa Beach Open begins at 9 a.m. Saturday , with 32 teams competing for the $ 9 # 400 first-place money . Competition resumes at 8:30 a.m. Sunday and finals are scheduled for 3 p.m. Admission is free .</TEXT>
