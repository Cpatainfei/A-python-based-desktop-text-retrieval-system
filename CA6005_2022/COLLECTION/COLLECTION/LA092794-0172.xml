   <HEADLINE> BATTLING TO BE TOP_DOG IN A FINICKY BUSINESS ; PET_FOOD : GLENDALE-BASED NESTLE USA GAINS SHARE IN A STAGNANT MARKET , HASTENING THE CLUTTERED INDUSTRY ' S TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For decades in the pet_food industry , companies battled for market share_in relatively polite fashion , as industry giants such_as Ralston Purina , Nestle and Mars behaved like well-mannered dogs gathered around a heaping bowl of chow . But the market has changed considerably in recent years . Competition from high-priced premium brands has intensified , grocery_stores have lost pet_food sales to alternative outlets , and growth in the pet population has slowed . Suddenly , there are too many dogs competing for too_little chow . With tensions rising , analysts say , expect skirmishes , and look_for the big dogs to survive . Nestle USA Inc. , the Glendale-based maker of Friskies and Mighty Dog pet_foods , started bulking up last week when it agreed to acquire Alpo Petfoods from London-based Grand Metropolitan for $ 510 million in cash . Since 1988 , Nestle ' s share of the $ 8.4-billion pet_food industry has fallen from 12.7 % to 11.5 % . The purchase of Alpo would make Nestle top_dog , surpassing by 0.1 % the 17 % market share held by longtime industry leader Ralston Purina . And it will give Nestle a popular dog_food brand to augment its already strong cat_food sales . Analysts applauded the deal as a much-needed closing of the ranks , but said there ' s plenty of room for further consolidation . In the not-so-distant future , analysts said , many companies will have to decide whether to join Nestle in building_up or Grand Met in getting_out . &quot; It would seem logical to expect more deals in the future , &quot; said Les Pugh , a pet-food industry_analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York . &quot; There are too many players , and too_much money invested in too many factories with too_much distribution. &quot; The winnowing-out process could take years , Pugh said , but eventually the pet_food industry ought to look a bit more like the $ 8-billion breakfast cereal industry , in which three companies -- Kellogg , General Mills and Post -- hold a combined 80 % market share_in the United States . In contrast , the top three pet_food companies -- Nestle , Ralston and Mars , the maker of Kal Kan -- together account_for 46 % of domestic sales . Such fragmentation has persisted for decades because companies such_as Nestle had little incentive to unload or expand pet_food divisions that typically required little attention while producing steady revenue growth . But the pet_food market has been upended over the past 10 years by a number of forces , including the emergence of long-dormant premium brands that have gobbled_up huge chunks of market share . Hill ' s Pet Nutrition Inc. , for example , was barely a blip on industry radar a decade ago . But by last year , the company had $ 660 million in sales and an almost 8 % market share , much of it gained at the expense of Ralston Purina , Nestle and others . What happened ? Some say the fitness craze finally hit pets . * Hill ' s is one of several so-called premium pet_food brands that claim to be more nutritious than traditional brands because they contain higher-quality grains and fewer fillers and animal byproducts . But nutrition comes at a hefty price . At Big Al ' s , a large pet supply store in Granada Hills , a 40-pound bag of Hill ' s Science Diet dog_food typically sells for about $ 25 , compared to just $ 12 for an equal amount of Purina Dog Chow . Until recently , most consumers , and even many veterinarians , saw little reason to spend the extra money . But today , &quot; you ' ve got people more concerned about their own diet , and that transfers to their pet , &quot; said Tim Phillips , a veterinarian who is editor of the Pet_Food Industry magazine . Hill ' s , a unit of Colgate-Palmolive Co. , has emerged as the leading premium brand partly by capitalizing on a relationship with veterinarians the company has cultivated since 1948 , when it introduced its Prescription Diet foods for animals with heart or kidney_disease . Until a_few years ago , Hill ' s sold virtually all_of its food through veterinarians , who pocketed up_to one-third of the sales price on each bag or can . Today , even though Hill ' s is now sold mostly through pet stores , its Science Diet brand is widely recommended by veterinarians , and health-conscious consumers are following doctors ' orders . Iams , another premium brand , has similarly capitalized on its status as a favorite among breeders , from whom many Americans get their puppies or kittens . Tiny 10 years ago , Iams had 1993 sales of $ 350 million , and held a 4.1 % market share . Ralston Purina , Nestle and other major pet_food makers have introduced their own premium brands in recent years . But sales of those products have foundered , partly because these companies lack credentials with veterinarians and breeders and also because they have been shut_out by specialty retailers . Over the past 10 years , grocery_stores have watched their share of retail pet_food sales in the United States slip from 95 % to 55 % , said John Maxwell , an analyst at Wheat First Securities in Richmond , Va . that ' s bad news for Ralston , Nestle and other industry leaders who have traditionally relied almost exclusively on grocery_store sales . * Mass merchandisers , including Price Club , Wal-Mart and Costco , have picked_up some of the business . In fact , Wal-Mart has acquired almost 6 % of the retail pet_food market through sales of its in-house brand , Ol ' Roy , named for the dog of the late Wal-Mart founder , Sam Walton . Also , as much as a quarter of all pet_food is now purchased through burgeoning pet_shop chains , some of which refuse to carry grocery_store brands . Petco , the second-largest U.S. pet store chain , has nearly doubled in size from 115 stores in 1988 to 205 stores today , and not one of them carries Nestle , Ralston Purina or other grocery_store brands . &quot; We threw them out_to differentiate ourselves , &quot; said Brian Devine , chief_executive of San Diego-based Petco . Instead , the company serves as an outlet for premium brands that aren ' t available at grocery_stores , including Hill ' s , Iams , Nutro and others . The outlook for Nestle , Ralston Purina and others has been further hampered by signs that the pet population is not growing as fast as it once did . Since 1990 , the number of pet dogs in the United States has remained unchanged at about 54.2 million , said Geri Mitchell of the Pet Information Bureau in Washington . Meanwhile , the number of pet cats has actually fallen from 60.3 million to 59.4 million . So analysts said that more consolidation is inevitable . Quaker Oats Co . is rumored to be looking_for a buyer for its pet_food division , which makes Cycle and Kibbles ' N Bits dog_food . Dozens of regional companies with tiny market shares are also considered acquisition targets . Likely suitors include the large and well-known food producers that must find ways to regain lost ground . Like Nestle , other industry heavyweights have seen their shares of total pet_food sales decline : Ralston Purina ' s has slipped from 27.2 % in 1998 to 17 % ; Mars has fallen from 10.7 % to 8.8 % . Even with Alpo , Nestle has already signaled it may still have some shopping to do . &quot; We are continually looking_for opportunities to grow our business , &quot; said Joe Weller , chief_executive of Nestle USA , &quot; whether through new products or acquisitions. &quot;</TEXT>
