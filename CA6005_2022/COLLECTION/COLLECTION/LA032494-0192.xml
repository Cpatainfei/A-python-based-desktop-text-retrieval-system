   <HEADLINE> OTHER STATES CHECK_OUT CALIFORNIA SMOG TEST DEAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s compromise with the federal_government on revamping its Smog Check program has touched_off a rebellious debate in state capitols across the nation , with many officials hoping to strike similar special deals on how cars are inspected for excessive exhaust emissions . From Georgia to Nevada , several legislatures and governors have suspended their own plans and are hurriedly evaluating California ' s . Although many are concluding that copying it would be too costly , several are preparing to negotiate with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for their own versions of California ' s Smog Check compromise . &quot; I ' ve been in this position for 13 years , and I ' ve not seen a backlash on an issue like I have_on this one . It was as if a tremendous shot was heard across the country , &quot; said William Becker , director of a Washington organization of state and local air_pollution regulators . &quot; EPA must now give other states the opportunity to pursue the same deal that they are giving California , &quot; he said . &quot; Legislatures and other officials in state_government are asking fair questions : ' What does all this mean for us and why should we break our necks and move forward when it is unclear what the EPA ' s policy is ? ' &quot; Under the federal Clean Air Act , 22 states with serious air_pollution must launch tougher inspection and maintenance programs for vehicles by Jan . 1 . The faceoff between the states and the EPA focuses_on the location and thoroughness of the tests . The EPA ordered most states to create centralized , test-only centers that operate under a state contract and perform more rigorous inspections on all cars and light trucks . But California legislators balked , saying that approach would hurt the state ' s 9 # 000 private repair_shops and service_stations that currently conduct smog checks . After lengthy negotiations , the Legislature forged a compromise with the EPA earlier this month and passed a package of bills that is awaiting Gov . Pete Wilson ' s signature . Under the agreement , 15 % of all cars in California in 1995 would be sent to the special test-only centers ; the others would continue to go_to regular service_stations . The state also would start a multimillion-dollar experiment with sensing devices along roadsides and other means of targeting gross polluters and cracking_down on fraud among mechanics . If those alternatives fail to clean_up enough cars , 30 % of all California vehicles in 1996 will go_to special centers . Because each vehicle is tested every_other year , that means 60 % of all California cars -- equivalent_to the percentage believed to be heavy polluters -- would undergo the more rigorous tests from then on . Under the plan , the 15 % of cars targeted initially will be culled from large fleets such_as rental cars and taxicabs , cars with missing emissions-control devices , gross polluting vehicles and cars selected randomly . Leaders of several other states -- angry with the EPA because it rejected their efforts to compromise -- said they will try to negotiate new agreements . Nevada Gov . Bob Miller dispatched a team to San Francisco on Wednesday to meet with the EPA ' s regional administrator . &quot; There are areas ( of the California deal ) that look as though they could have a positive application in the state of Nevada , &quot; said Richard Urey , Miller ' s press secretary . Many states , however , are finding elements of California ' s hybrid program unappealing , mostly because they fear it will be more costly for motorists and more complex for government . &quot; This will be hard to replicate in other states . They may flirt_with it , they may look_at it , but when they actually examine it , I think they won ' t find it attractive , &quot; said John White , a Sacramento lobbyist for the Sierra Club . Harold Reheis , Georgia ' s environmental director , said his state will not adopt California ' s plan because &quot; it will be very costly to car owners and will shift a heavy cost burden to lower income people. &quot; Instead , Reheis said Georgia will work_on its own compromise . The EPA estimates that California motorists will pay $ 50 or more for a smog inspection , up from their current $ 32 average . Nationally , the average will run $ 20 for motorists in states operating new test-only centers . No limit was put_on the amount_of_money a California motorist must spend to repair a car that is considered a gross polluter . &quot; I think many outside of California would argue that this is not a good_deal for the California consumer -- that it is unnecessarily expensive , and is much tougher in many respects than the standard , &quot; Becker said . But Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) , the chief architect of the compromise , said other states are making hasty judgments based on false assumptions . He disputed the EPA ' s estimate of $ 50 or more per test , saying : &quot; We honestly don ' t know how much it will cost. &quot; Katz called the program &quot; a reasonable alternative &quot; for California because it will clean_up the air , retain jobs at service_stations and be more convenient for motorists than the EPA ' s version . &quot; The volume of cars in California is much greater than it is in Georgia , which will bring the price down in California , &quot; Katz said . &quot; The states where you have more dense populations and a larger_number of vehicles will find this kind of program more attractive. &quot; Denise Graveline , an EPA spokeswoman in Washington , said that even though many states have asked to talk to the agency , none so far have asked to revise their inspection programs . If they do , she said , &quot; we have to wait to see what they are asking_for . Every state is looking_at what every_other state is doing , but every state wants something different. &quot; EPA officials have insisted that smog tests be separated from repairs because they believe the current system of allowing mechanics to do both is riddled with fraud and leaves smog-belching cars unfixed . Initially , most states started complying with the EPA ' s order reluctantly , after the agency threatened to freeze their highway funds and impose other economic sanctions . But even as they signed contracts to set_up inspection systems , many were eyeing the wrestling match between the EPA and California . In a December letter , Pennsylvania Acting Gov . Mark S . Singel warned EPA Administrator Carol Browner that if California is granted a special deal &quot; not only will Pennsylvania ' s Legislature rescind our ( program ) , but in my opinion , they will not take any federal Clean Air Act requirements seriously. &quot; Other state officials and Congress members sent similar warnings . Graveline , however , emphasized that the EPA has not budged from its bottom_line -- that California ' s hybrid program must achieve the Clean Air Act ' s mandate or be abandoned in 1996 . &quot; They can use alternatives , but they have to prove to us they can meet the equivalent of taking 60 % of the dirtiest cars off the road , &quot; she said . Becker , who says a tougher inspection_and_repair program is the best and cheapest way to clear the nation ' s skies , worries that the new programs may be delayed . &quot; The California deal has come at a very inopportune time , &quot; he said , &quot; given the fact that most states proceeded ahead in the past few months in good_faith . It came right in the middle when states were purchasing land and letting contracts -- making the final_decisions to implement their programs. &quot;</TEXT>
