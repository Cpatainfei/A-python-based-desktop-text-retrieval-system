   <TEXT> Chilling evidence suggesting that nuclear material is being smuggled out of the former Soviet_Union for illicit sale on world markets has prompted a new agreement between Germany and Russia for closer cooperation to combat movement of the contraband . In the last four months three such shipments have been intercepted in Germany , the most recent on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow to Munich two weeks ago . Western scientists who examined that 10.5-ounce cache of plutonium-239 believe it originated_in Russia . But Moscow has emphatically denied any official laxity , and in last week ' s agreement Germany diplomatically refrained_from new finger-pointing . National pride is clearly very much at_issue here , and some in Russia have also hastened to charge that worries over smuggled plutonium have been fabricated to justify Western intrusion into Russian nuclear facilities . But the widespread breakdown in_order and controls in Russia and the rise of organized_crime , graphically described by Times correspondent Richard Boudreaux last Sunday , indicate that the theft and smuggling of nuclear material represent an all too plausible threat . In any event there ' s no denying that German authorities have intercepted plutonium within their borders . How much smuggled material may have escaped detection is almost too scary to think_about . Such nuclear-ambitious countries as Iran and Libya are believed to be in the market for plutonium , a laboratory-created element not found in nature . But plutonium ' s great toxicity -- a small amount could poison a major city ' s water_supply -- makes_it a weapon coveted by terrorists as well as by states . Germany and Russia have agreed on closer intelligence cooperation and tighter border controls to try to curb the traffic in plutonium . But Germany isn ' t the only entry point for nuclear contraband . Other nations should be enlisted in this grim anti-smuggling effort , for the stakes are literally a matter of life and death .</TEXT>
