   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS ' 94 ; HOUSE PLAYS MUSICAL CHAIRS ; GINGRICH CALLS TUNE ; CONGRESS : THE GOP TAKEOVER WILL BRING RADICAL CHANGES TO LEADERSHIP OF KEY COMMITTEES . MILDER SHIFTS ARE SEEN IN THE SENATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , Rep . George Miller ( D-Martinez ) , a staunch environmentalist , has battled developers as chairman of the House Natural_Resources Committee . Now his fight is over . Come January , Miller is expected to be replaced by Rep . Don Young ( R-Alaska ) , a strong proponent of development whose peeves include the strict government regulation of millions of acres of federal land in his state . As a member of the minority , the once-powerful Miller will have little sway over the committee agenda . As the switch_on the Natural_Resources panel shows , the 1995 Congress will be vastly different from the old . Every gavel of every committee of Congress will be in different hands . Conservative Republicans will take_over chairmanships from often-liberal lawmakers and will decide what hearings are held , what legislation is considered and what the rules are . In the House , a good many committees and certainly subcommittees may no longer even exist . The likely new Speaker , Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) , has vowed to slash congressional staff by at least a third and radically reconfigure the committee structure . In the Senate , with the exception of the ascendancy of a_few high profile chairmen such_as Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R-N.Y. ) and Jesse Helms ( R-S.C. ) , most experts predict that the differences will not be as great . &quot; Most of these people who will be taking_over the House have very little profile , and no meaningful legislative record other_than voting , &quot; said Allen Shick , a professor of political_science at George Mason University . &quot; They have never led. &quot; Indeed , none has ever had the opportunity to do so . It ' s been 40 years since the Republicans last controlled the House . The change is going_to be dazzling . The Republicans can ' t wait . As he stood before a throng at the Westin Hotel in Costa Mesa on Tuesday night , Republican Rep . Robert K . Dornan of Garden Grove tantalized the crowd . After years on the minority side , Dornan is in_line to become a Armed Services subcommittee chairman . &quot; Chairman . . . Dornan , &quot; he said as if trying_on the title for size . Then he produced a wooden gavel , pounded it exuberantly on the lectern and shouted to the back of the room : &quot; Liberal Democrats ! You shut your mouth ! &quot; The list of new committee assignments includes : * On the powerful House subcommittee on health and the environment , Chairman Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , who has waged war on the tobacco_industry and was getting close to banning smoking in public places , is likely to be replaced by Rep . Thomas J . Bliley Jr . Bliley ' s Richmond , Va. , district is the home of Philip Morris Tobacco Co. , and he is one the industry ' s finest champions in Congress . * On the House Ways and Means Committee , Rep Bill Archer ( R-Tex. ) would represent &quot; a major , major , major move to the right , &quot; said Joe White , a senior policy analyst at the Brookings Institution , a Washington think_tank . Archer is committed to reducing broad capital_gains taxes . * Henry J . Hyde ( R-Ill. ) , the controversial but respected heir-apparent of the House Judiciary Committee chairmanship , is likely to try to spearhead a federal version of California ' s anti-illegal-immigrant Proposition 187 , several congressional analysts said . One outstanding question in the shuffling is how much control Gingrich will exert . Many observers anticipate a tense battle for the House agenda between Gingrich and his new Republicans and the older , somewhat more moderate Republicans who would take_over the committees if seniority were the determining factor . Gingrich has made_it clear that he wants to return to the era of centralized power , rather than continuing the current practice of allowing decisions to flow_from the committee chairs . &quot; Good_luck , &quot; said James A . Thurber , director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential studies at American University . &quot; I don ' t think anyone could do that in these days. &quot; Still , &quot; his operating style is very coordinated , &quot; said Rick Shapiro , director of the Congressional Management Foundation , a consulting group that trains congressional staff . &quot; He will appoint very few chairmen who will go_off and be moderate. &quot; On Wednesday , Gingrich told reporters that he intends to bypass the seniority system in choosing committee chairs . Among the rumored possibilities : * Carlos J . Moorhead ( R-Glendale ) might ordinarily be in_line to assume the chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee from Rep . John S . Dingell ( D-Mich. ) Some of Gingrich ' s aides , however , consider Moorhead too moderate and suggest that he would meet with strong opposition . * On the Rules Committee , 64-year-old Gerald B.H. Solomon ( R-N.Y. ) would be line to head a panel that can be important in assembling the Speaker ' s power because it controls many of the levers and switches of the House . But Solomon staged a brief challenge to Gingrich for the Republican whip ' s job two years ago . &quot; And Gingrich ' s people think he ' s too moderate , not a true believer , &quot; said a consultant employed by the Senate . Insiders say Gingrich ' s favorite for that post is Rep . David Dreier ( R-San Dimas ) , a 42-year-old member of the committee who , like Gingrich , made his name not legislatively but as a constant scold of Democratic methods . * Another senior Republican who is widely discussed as being_on Gingrich ' s hit list is Bill Thomas of Bakersfield , who would normally be in_line for the House Administration committee . &quot; Too moderate , &quot; said one Capitol_Hill aide familiar_with Gingrich ' s ideas . In the Senate , the Republican revolution may be gentler . On the Armed Services panel , the differences between Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) and Strom Thurmond ( R-S.C. ) will not be enormous . On the Finance_Committee , there also is little to separate moderate Republican Bob Packwood of Oregon from moderate Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York , said congressional scholar Norman Ornstein . The same applies on the Appropriations Committee , where Republican Mark O . Hatfield of Oregon is expected to take_over from Democrat Robert C . Byrd of West_Virginia . A few moves , however , would be more fundamental . On the Senate Banking Committee , D ' Amato is expected to undertake high-profile investigations , including hearings on President Clinton ' s Whitewater real_estate investment , which is currently the subject of an investigation by an independent government counsel . But on basic fiscal_policy , D ' Amato will not differ radically from the current chairman , Michigan Democrat Donald W . Riegle Jr. , analysts said . A major change will occur when Helms takes_over as head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . Helms has used his seat on the panel , currently chaired by Rhode Island Democrat Claiborne Pell , to fight State_Department appointments and other moves he opposes . Helms ' aides have already advised the State_Department to drop Clinton ' s pending nomination of Robert A . Pastor , a longtime aide to former President Jimmy_Carter , as U.S. ambassador to Panama . &quot; We ' re going to screw ' em whenever they turn_around , &quot; a Helms aide said , referring to the Democrats . Among California Republicans , the potential harvest of chairmanships is rivaled only by the dismantling of Democratic empires . California Democrats held chairmanships of four House committees -- Armed Services ; Natural_Resources ; Public Works and Transportation ; and Science , Space and Technology . They also held many subcommittee posts . Now , Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) may take_over the Committee on the District_of_Columbia and he may also be in_line to head a subcommittee of Science , Space and Technology . On the Appropriations Committee , which has ultimate control over House spending , Rep . Jerry Lewis ( R-Redlands ) will almost certainly become one of 13 subcommittee chairmen -- dubbed the &quot; cardinals &quot; for their power to influence spending decisions . Rep . Ron Packard ( R-Oceanside ) could also possibly benefit from Appropriations Committee chess_moves and wind_up in striking distance of a subcommittee chairmanship . New Senate Committee Chairmen The party that controls the Senate and House also controls the committees that shape legislation , pass judgement on presidential appointees and launch high-profile investigations . Under the seniority system , these Republicans are now in_line to take_over key committees since the GOP has won a Senate majority . * Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs ALFONSE M . D ' AMATO of New York . An outspoken critic of Administration policies and personnel , D ' Amato almost certainly would seek to embarrass President Clinton by investigating the Whitewater controversy more intensely than the present chairman , Donald W . Riegle Jr . ( D-Mich. ) , who is retiring . * Foreign Relations JESSE HELMS of North Carolina . A conservative scourge of presidents past who delights in sparring with the State_Department , he opposes U.S. foreign_aid and many of Clinton ' s foreign_policy initiatives . Helms would succeed Claiborne Pell ( D-R.I. ) , a lackluster chairman . * Armed Services STROM THURMOND of South Carolina . Back in 1948 , as a breakaway Democrat , Thurmond ran_for President against Harry S . Truman as a defender of racial_segregation . Now , approaching 92 , he will be hard-pressed to oversee the nation ' s defense spending with the tireless attention to detail of the current chairman , Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) , a serious student of Pentagon programs . * Finance BOB PACKWOOD of Oregon . Although he is more liberal than many of his GOP colleagues , Packwood , who headed the Finance_Committee in the early 1980s , probably would toe the party_line in an effort to save himself from being sanctioned on sexual-harassment charges . He would succeed Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) , the quixotic economics professor-turned-politician . * Appropriations MARK O . HATFIELD of Oregon . Unlike other members of his party ascending to chairmanships , he is more liberal than the present chairman , Robert C . Byrd ( D-W.Va. ) , who has used the post to gain political pork for his home state . * Agriculture , Nutrition and Forestry RICHARD G . LUGAR of Indiana . He probably would be more conservative and more attentive to the interests of the Midwestern grain-growing farmers than the current chairman , Patrick J . Leahy ( D-Vt. ) * Budget PETE V . DOMENICI of New Mexico . The chairman of the Budget Committee the last time the Republicans held a majority in the Senate , he is viewed_as a stronger proponent of deficit reduction than Democrat Chairman Jim Sasser of Tennessee . * Judiciary ORRIN G . HATCH of Utah . The President ' s judicial nominees-particularly liberals-are certain to encounter tougher scrutiny by a committee chaired by a conservative , who would replace liberal Joseph R . Biden Jr . ( D-Del. ) . * Labor and Human Resources NANCY LANDON KASSEBAUM of Kansas . Although she is not always as conservative on the issues that come_before this committee as_many other Republicans , she is certainly more conservative than the current chairman , Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) . Probable House Chairs * Energy and Commerce : Carlos Moorhead , 72 , who represents the Glendale-Burbank area 27th District , is staunchly conservative . He has been criticized by some party colleagues for not being aggressive enough . * Judiciary : Henry Hyde , 70 , is a flamboyant silver-haired former trial_lawyer from Illinois whose name is linked with the amendment that bans federal funding of most abortions . * Armed Services : Floyd Spence , 66 , of South Carolina , has been in the House since 1970 and in 1971 became the first member to sponsor a balanced_budget amendment to the Constitution . * Appropriations : Joseph McDade , 63 , of Pennsylvania , is under indictment on racketeering and bribery charges stemming from defense contracts he allegedly helped secure in exchange for favors . Whether he would be able to take the chair would have to be decided by the party . * Ways and Means : Bill Archer , 66 , of Texas , who after 24 years of fighting Democratic tax_policies will get_to promote the anti-tax , free-market agenda of his party like never before . * Agriculture : Pat Roberts , 58 , was a newspaper_editor and then a House aide before running_for his western Kansas seat in 1980 . He has voted to protect Kansas farmers from tax reformers . * Banking : Jim Leach , 52 , was director of a federal savings and loan before winning his congressional seat in 1976 . The Iowa representative ' s voting record makes him one of the most liberal Republicans in the House , but he is fiscally conservative . * Budget : John Kasich , 42 , was an Ohio state_senator before being elected to Congress in 1982 . His heart is in streamlining military expenditures and balancing the U.S. burden-share with European and other allies . * Education and Labor : William Goodling , 66 , was a public_school board_member before taking Pennsylvania ' s 19th District seat . Despite coming under heavy fire during the House banking scandal , Goodling ' s longstanding support of bipartisan education measures has kept him in office since 1974 . * Foreign Affairs : Benjamin Gilman , 71 , former New York assemblyman , has held his seat since 1972 . Known for his moderate stance on economic and foreign_policy , he supports ending the arms embargo against Bosnia .</TEXT>
