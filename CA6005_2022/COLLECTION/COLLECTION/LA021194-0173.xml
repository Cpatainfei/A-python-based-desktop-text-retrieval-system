   <HEADLINE> MARCH FONG EU QUITS AS SECRETARY OF STATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_of_State March Fong Eu , who has been nominated by President Clinton to be U.S. ambassador to Micronesia , announced Thursday that she is resigning and will go_to Washington for Senate confirmation_hearings . The resignation is effective next Thursday . Gov . Pete Wilson is not expected to appoint a replacement because of the short time before the election , which would make_it difficult for an appointee to obtain state Senate and Assembly confirmation . The job will be done on a temporary basis by Chief Deputy Tony Miller , who has declared his candidacy for the position . Eu has endorsed Miller , a fellow Democrat . Assemblyman Bill Jones ( R-Fresno ) , Assemblywoman Gwen Moore ( D-Los Angeles ) and Democrat Mike Woo , a former Los Angeles city councilman , also are running_for Eu ' s position . Eu said her proudest accomplishments while secretary_of_state for 20 years include obtaining mail voter registration , sponsoring the establishment of the state World Trade Commission , and getting federal approval of legislation allowing voters to register at the Department of Motor_Vehicles and other state agencies . &quot; I also have served as a successful role_model for women and minorities , &quot; she said , &quot; and that has been a source of much pride to me. &quot; First elected secretary_of_state in 1974 , Eu , 71 , won by a record vote of nearly 3 million . She was the first woman ever elected to the post . She previously served as assemblywoman representing Oakland and part of Castro Valley . As a legislator , Eu initiated a drive to abolish pay toilets for women and pushed_through the necessary legislation . She reaped nationwide publicity when she wielded a sledgehammer to smash a toilet on the Capitol steps for the benefit of television_cameras and newspaper photographers . In 1986 , Eu was beaten and robbed by an ax-wielding assailant in her Hancock Park home . After Eu gave him $ 400 , the man fled . She recovered and her assailant was convicted of several felony burglary counts . He was sentenced to 25 years in prison . Eu considered running_for U.S. Senate in 1988 , but decided not to make the race because her husband , Henry Eu , would not disclose his financial interests . Her son , Matt Fong , is a Republican who was appointed to the State Board of Equalization by Gov . Pete Wilson . Fong is running_for the office of state_treasurer .</TEXT>
