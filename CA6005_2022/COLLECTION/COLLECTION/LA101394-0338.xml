   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS : SPOTLIGHT ON HONG KONG ; THE HONG KONG ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The British colony has long been a thriving free market_economy , which has prompted some worries about how the pending takeove by China will impact on one of Asia ' s largest economies . Under an agreement signed with the_British in 1984 , the colony in 1997 reverts to Beijing control after 99 years of British rule . THE ECONOMY : With limited national resources , Hong Kong depends_on imports for virtually all_of its requirements , including raw_materials , food and other consumer goods and fuel . But Hong Kong ' s emergence as a world financial_center has contributed to steady growth in the colony ' s Gross_Domestic_Product , estimated at about $ 127.2 billion for 1994 . Real GDP per capita for 1994 is about $ 10 # 855 . Inflation , though still below double_digits , has been higher than most industrialized nations , largely because of increases in property values . SERVICES : Largely due_to Hong Kong ' s role as a major internationl financial_center , services account_for about three quarters of Hong Kong ' s GDP . The territory houses numerous domestic and foreign financial services companies , including banks , insurers , brokerages and investment concerns that play an important role in the emerging stock_markets in Asia . Transportation and shipping are also major service_industries . TOURISM : Tourism is the third largest foreign_exchange earner and has grown rapidly in the past decade . In 1992 , the number of tourists increased 16 % and earnings rose nearly 22 % . Visitors come mainly from Taiwan , Japan and Southeast_Asia . LABOR_FORCE : With some six million people live_in an area of just over over 400 square_miles , Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated regions in the world . Birth_rates are moderately low , with more_than 70 % of the population between the age of 15 and 64 . Some 2.7 million people are in the work_force . Despite the lack of a minimum_wage law , average labor costs are second only to Japan among Asian economies and skilled labor is in short supply . Real wages rose about 1.9 % in 1993 . There , however , is abundant unskilled labor , in part because of extensive illegal immigration from China and Vietnam . TRADE : Because of limited natural_resources , Hong Kong relies heavily on imports for its manufacturing and consumer goods , amassing an expected $ 4.7 billion trade_deficit this year . Hong Kong ' s principal imports are food , chemicals , textiles and machinery while it exports mostly clothing , electrical machinery and data processing equipment . It ' s principal trading partner is China , which relies_on Hong Kong for reexports in addition to the regular trade that takes_place between the two . Other major trading partners are Japan and the United States . TRANSPORTATION : The government has imposed rules to strictly limit private ownership of automobiles because of the limitations of the crowded territories roadways . As a result , car ownership is extremely low compared to other Asian cities . But has an elaborate system of public transportation . The international airport and a magnificent natural harbor provide many links to most areas of the world . AGRICULTURE : With only seven percent of Hong Kong ' s land arable , agriculture amounts to less than one_percent of GDP . The territory relies_on imports for most of its food , although it does produce some rice , vegetables , livestock and flowers .</TEXT>
