   <HEADLINE> RULING PARTY TAKES BIG LEAD IN SALVADOR VOTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The government ' s right-wing political_party jumped to a substantial lead Sunday over leftist former guerrillas in peaceful but flawed elections , the first voting since the end of El_Salvador ' s bloody civil_war . Armando Calderon Sol , presidential candidate for the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance , or Arena , was leading by nearly a 2-1 margin over leftist legislator Ruben Zamora . But Zamora insisted that a runoff will be necessary . The former rebels who dominate Zamora ' s coalition party angrily denounced a host of irregularities that prevented thousands of people from casting ballots . With the full political spectrum participating for the first time in Salvadoran history , the elections were seen as an important step_in El_Salvador ' s struggle to rebuild and heal deep wounds after a war that claimed 75 # 000 lives . Leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front , or FMLN , battled U.S.-backed forces for 12 years until both sides were forced to negotiate a settlement . U.N.-brokered peace accords ended the war in 1992 . The rebels agreed to disarm in exchange for sweeping political , military and judicial reforms , many of which are still incomplete . Preliminary results tabulated by the Jesuit-run University of Central_America and the Spanish-language U.S. television network Telemundo gave Calderon Sol 48.7 % of the vote nationwide , to 25.8 % for Zamora . If no candidate receives more_than 50 % of the vote , a runoff is required by law . Members of Arena were claiming victory Sunday , while supporters in cars , honking horns and waving red , white and blue_flags , pushed_through the streets of the capital . Salvadorans were also choosing all 84 legislators and 262 mayors nationwide . Results in these races were not yet available . Only scattered violence was reported in Sunday ' s elections . But a number of irregularities were observed by journalists and international monitoring teams . Voting stations opened with up_to two-hour delays ; scores of people with valid voter cards were not included in official registrar lists and thus not allowed to vote ; lines that stretched for blocks under a searing tropical sun moved painfully slowly , and there were isolated reports of double voting . &quot; All of these irregularities take_away from the transparency , honesty and liberty of this event , &quot; said the FMLN ' s top official , Schafik Handal , a veteran Communist who ran_for mayor of San Salvador . Handal spoke at a hastily called news_conference of the FMLN ' s senior five-member command an hour after the polls closed . The command members were clearly angry at what they called the Supreme Electoral Tribunal ' s deliberate strategy of impeding voters . The tribunal is the government_agency in_charge of overseeing elections and is controlled by pro-government magistrates . &quot; These irregularities , and they must be understood as such , are a form of fraud , &quot; FMLN leader Francisco Jovel said . &quot; It isn ' t the fraud of military dictatorships , of filling ballot_boxes and taking them to the barracks . Today it is a fraud in the sense that the people have been denied their constitutional right_to_vote . . . . We are talking_about a lot of people who had the desire to vote , and today that was frustrated. &quot; Zamora himself , speaking_to reporters later Sunday , took a more moderate tone . He said he was confident he would dispute a second round of voting with Calderon Sol , and pledged to make the system work better than it did Sunday . It was difficult to determine independently just what impact the delays and other problems would have_on election results . California Democrat Rep . Dan Hamburg , part of a team of observers , said late Sunday : &quot; There ' s a consistent pattern of something between willful incompetence and just plain incompetence . . . . It isn ' t like any one thing was so horrible . It ' s like five votes here , 10 votes there. &quot; Turnout was estimated by local television at between 55 % and 60 % , or about 1.4 million people . Authorities before Sunday had predicted that more_than 2 million people would vote . President Alfredo Cristiani , who by law is barred from running_for reelection , acknowledged minor irregularities early in the day . He did not immediately comment on the FMLN ' s specific charges . &quot; Nothing is perfect , &quot; he said . &quot; The important thing is that these problems are not intentional. &quot; Despite the problems , many voters said Sunday ' s exercise represented a marked departure from the past , when fighting , rebel boycotts and fear marked elections that were riddled with fraud . &quot; These elections are important for all Salvadorans ( as ) an opportunity to show that we all have a right to express our opinions , &quot; said Ernesto Rodriguez , 36 , who was voting accompanied by his family . &quot; Here among us are people who were carrying guns , and now they ' re participating in an electoral process , and that is the most important thing. &quot; &quot; I ' ve voted_in past elections , but there were fewer people ( because ) we were afraid to come and vote , &quot; Ena de Rivas , 26 , whose sister lives in Los Angeles , said as she left a voting station in the densely populated San Salvador suburb of Soyapango . Many voters , however , met only frustration . To vote , a Salvadoran citizen with a valid voter-registration card must report to the appropriate voting station , find his or her name on a computer printout of the registrar and then report to his or her assigned voting table to receive and deposit the ballots . In many voting stations visited by journalists , hundreds of people could be seen searching for their names on the pink computer printouts , taped to the walls of gymnasiums or nailed to trees and often not posted in alphabetical order . If the name does not appear , the person cannot vote . One woman searched for her name for two hours -- finding the names of her dead father , her dead uncle and a sister who left El_Salvador for Australia nine years ago . But she never found her own name -- even though she possessed a valid voter card -- and was not allowed to cast a ballot . &quot; A lot of people just give_up and leave , &quot; said police agent Gloria Zamora , who was helping people find their names at a voting station in a San Salvador . &quot; A lot of people don ' t know how to read , and the lists are really a mess . We are losing a lot of people. &quot; A survey contracted by a group of reporters revealed that the highest incidence of frustrated voters occurred in former war zones . By late morning , 10 % of the people who tried to vote_in the northeastern town of Chalatenango were unable to do so ; the rate was 5 % in the towns of Suchitoto and Tecaluca . By contrast , in Santa Tecla , an upper-middle-class suburb of San Salvador , the rate was 1 % . There were scattered reports of double voting . Zamora ' s campaign manager , Hector Silva , found that when he presented himself at the voting_booth , someone had already voted_in his name . &quot; I was only allowed to vote because I am a legislator and television_cameras were_on top of me , &quot; Silva said . &quot; Undoubtedly , if it is lack of ability , it is a huge lack of ability . A low turnout goes_against us . Intentional or not , we are affected by the turnout. &quot; In Guazapa , a town north of San Salvador on the skirts of a dormant volcano that was once the scene of vicious guerrilla battles and air_force bombings , more_than 200 people had lined_up by 7 a.m. But the polls opened an hour later . Juan de Dios Fernandez , a corn farmer in a straw_hat , had hiked and taken a bus beginning at 4 a.m. to reach the school where he was assigned to vote . &quot; It is an obligation , &quot; he said . Morris Valle , a 24-year-old former FMLN fighter , was voting for the first time . &quot; We have to make things different , &quot; he said . &quot; If things don ' t change , I ' ll have to go_to the States . But if things change , I will stay here forever in the struggle , here with my beans and corn. &quot; The irregularities in Sunday ' s voting did not necessarily follow political lines . Inside a sweltering gymnasium in Zacamil , a working-class suburb of San Salvador , Santos Pleitez de Sigaran , 49 , would have liked to vote for Arena because she believes that the party helped bring peace to El_Salvador . But her name was not on the list . &quot; One comes_with good intentions , but if they don ' t let me vote , well , there ' s nothing I can do , &quot; she said after she could not find her name . &quot; I am not going_to force it . It does not make me happy . By right , my name had to be there. &quot;</TEXT>
