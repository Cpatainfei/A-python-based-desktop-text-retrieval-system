   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : WESTMINSTER ; CITY REQUESTS AID FOR IMMIGRANT COSTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> City_Council members have asked the federal_government to share some of the cost of providing services to refugees and newly arrived immigrants , and to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country . The council this week passed two resolutions on immigration , including one that described public_services provided to immigrants , both legal and illegal , as an &quot; unfunded mandate &quot; by the federal_government on state and local_governments . In becoming the first Orange County city to join in the immigration debate , council_members said that the cost of providing public health , education , welfare , social_services and criminal justice to immigrants is growing &quot; at an alarming rate. &quot; However , city officials said they do not know how much the city is spending on immigrant services . Gov . Pete Wilson has asked the federal_government for $ 3.1 billion in reimbursements for statewide services to illegal immigrants . The city is home to the largest Vietnamese American community in the country . About 20 % of the city ' s 81 # 000 population is Asian American and about 18 % is Latino . &quot; It ' s not a race issue , it ' s a financial issue , &quot; acting City_Manager Robert J . Huntley said . But leaders of local minority groups said that the council action is part of what they believe is a growing pattern of blaming all immigrants for California ' s continuing economic troubles . &quot; Immigrants should not be used as scapegoats , &quot; said Dr. Co D.L. Pham , president of the Westminster Vietnamese Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s fair . Immigrants have contributed to the growth of the economy. &quot; He pointed_out that the Little Saigon business_district pours about $ 1.5 million in sales and property_taxes to the city each year -- an amount city officials confirmed . A majority of the business owners there are not yet U.S. citizens , Pham said . &quot; We give much more_than we receive from the city , &quot; Pham said . Amin David , head of Los Amigos of Orange County , an Anaheim-based group that addresses Latino issues , said that the council_members are misguided in their efforts . &quot; Where will it stop ? &quot; David asked . &quot; Will ( services ) to children born as U.S. citizens now be billed to the U.S._government just because they were fathered by immigrants ? &quot; Mayor Charles V . Smith , who was co-chairman of a task_force on immigration at the recent U.S. Conference of Mayors , has advocated for the passage of the council resolutions . He said that cities benefit from their immigrant population , but the costs of providing services to newly arrived immigrants are increasing at a time when revenues are declining . Councilman Tony Lam , who emigrated from Vietnam in the 1970s , said he was concerned the resolutions may be interpreted as &quot; immigrant bashing , &quot; but voted for them anyway because he said he was worried about the cost of illegal immigration .
