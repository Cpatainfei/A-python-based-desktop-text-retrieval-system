   <HEADLINE> SMALL BUSINESS ; SOLO AD VENTURER ; HIGH-TECH ONE-MAN AGENCY REPRESENTS NEXT WAVE AS INDUSTRY SHRINKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rob Frankel , president of Frankel &amp; Anderson advertising_agency , works in a tiny office in his Encino home , where he dreams_up ads on his Apple Macintosh computer . He also has an IBM PC-clone , a phone and a fax machine . He has no employees , just occasional visits from his two dogs and his 2-year-old son . His closets are stuffed with floppy_disks , his walls cluttered with movie posters and a photo of one of the actors who played Darrin Stephens , the advertising_agency executive from the ' 60s TV_show &quot; Bewitched. &quot; But Frankel , 37 , claims to represent the future of the advertising business , and he may just be right . While many big ad_agencies have been slow to incorporate computer_technology into their businesses , Frankel said he ' s been all-digital for about five years . Frankel composes ads on a computer -- whether drawings , rearranging photos , or tinkering with copy , headlines and colors -- then pushes a button to fax the ad to the client for approval . Better yet , if a client is_on the Internet computer_network , Frankel zaps a color , electronic version of the ad in a matter of seconds . He can even transmit TV commercials electronically , if the client is capable of receiving in that format . Of course , most ad_agencies these days use computers to compose and typeset ads the way that Frankel does . But even some of the largest agencies still haven ' t integrated their computer_systems among various departments , and rarely do they send ads to clients electronically . Some even still make presentations to prospective clients the old-fashioned way -- on hand-drawn art boards . Not only does Frankel charge less than big agencies , but he claims that technology has narrowed the quality gap , allowing him to produce ads comparable_to those that big agencies spend months on -- and in a fraction of the time . This , at a time when the ad industry is trying to recover from its longest and bleakest drought in memory , with tens of thousands of layoffs . Critics contend that many large agencies remain bloated and inefficient , and their once-loyal advertisers are increasingly breaking ad accounts into pieces that are doled_out to various firms . As a result , observers say , more and more work is going_to smaller , entrepreneurial agencies and non-traditional firms such_as Hollywood talent agencies -- who are seen as swifter , hipper and more responsive . Coca-Cola , for example , has defected from Madison Avenue to small ad_agencies and high-powered Hollywood talent agency Creative Artists Agency . IBM , Burger King , MasterCard and Volkswagen also switched from large to small agencies . &quot; The information highway ? They don ' t get_it , &quot; Frankel said of big ad_agencies . Most are &quot; still structured like 1950s agencies . They ' re still doing the Doris Day-Rock Hudson thing. &quot; Frankel is not alone in his view of big ad_agencies . &quot; There are some large agencies that are probably in a state of decline and are not going_to make_it because they ' ve bureaucratized the whole advertising process , &quot; said New York management_consultant James Howard . In his days working for big agencies , Frankel recalled , he would produce about one television spot and three print ads a year . He now completes a couple hundred jobs a year without breaking a sweat , claiming to take_in gross_revenues equivalent_to an agency billing between $ 3.5 million and $ 6 million annually . ( Advertising_agencies typically keep_from 7 % to 15 % of billings. ) Granted , that ' s puny compared to billion-dollar agencies . And Frankel ' s clients -- from computer software firms and retailers to the California Lottery and Sea World -- usually spend $ 500 # 000 or less on an ad_campaign with him . But many major ad_agencies that would n ' t accept jobs that small in the 1980s now do . Frankel said he gets most of his business through referrals from clients who like his &quot; funny &quot; style . For a Honda Sabre motorcycle ad , he created a glossy image of the bike imposed over photos of road signs with text that reads , &quot; It was born under three different signs. &quot; Another ad for a health club has a 100-pound bag of flour dressed in a bikini , with a reminder , &quot; Just because you ' re 100 lbs . doesn ' t mean you look great in a bikini. &quot; Major ad_agencies have also used Frankel anonymously to perform &quot; ghost work &quot; on some of their biggest accounts because his computer expertise allows him to turn assignments around so quickly , he claimed -- although Frankel won ' t reveal the names of these agencies . Larger ad_agencies generally have been slow to embrace computer_technology because the main reason to do so was to cut costs , said Ron Lockhart , chief_executive of Publications Directions , a New York consulting firm for graphics companies . &quot; In the ad industry , all_the charges are thrown right back to the client and marked_up at the industry standard . There was no motivation for advertisers to do it. &quot; It ' s only now that larger agencies are under pressure from smaller ones that they ' ve begun to catch_up , he said . Not everyone agrees that big ad_agencies are dinosaurs . BBDO Worldwide was &quot; forced into ( technology ) early &quot; because a major client is Apple Computer , which expects a certain degree of technological competence , said Patty Buss , vice_president at BBDO in Los Angeles . &quot; I think everyone is pretty much up_to speed now. &quot; The view of big ad_agencies as inefficient is &quot; wishful_thinking on the part of a lot of smaller agencies , &quot; said Abbott C . Jones , managing director of AdMedia Corporate Advisors , a New York investment banking firm . After their cutbacks and reorganizations , many big agencies are now leaner and more responsive to clients , Jones said . He noted that ad giants such_as Interpublic Group , Omnicon Group and Foote Cone &amp; Belding have growing revenues and earnings , and higher stock prices . Still , Frankel argued that many large agencies remain bloated with middle management and archaic chains of command : A client will communicate with an account_executive , who types_a memo and sends it to his supervisor , who passes it on to the senior creative_person , who dispatches the information to group heads . All the while , ideas bounce to and fro , from agency to advertiser , in meeting after meeting . Delivery service bills pile_up . &quot; It ' s a huge Ping-Pong game between the ad_agency and the client , which actually becomes adversarial , &quot; Frankel said . As evidence that some agencies are technologically deficient , Frankel noted a recent agency review he conducted for a division of the Dutch consumer electronics giant Philips . Frankel , hired to advise Philips on which agency to select , heard presentations by several major agencies . He was astonished when two presented art boards that were drawn and pasted up by hand . Frankel said he knows big ad_agencies well because he ' s worked for eight of them . Fresh out of UC Berkeley , Frankel joined Foote , Cone &amp; Belding as a writer . Over the next seven years he jumped from one agency to another , ending_up at D ' Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles . In 1986 , he was asked to leave the agency over &quot; style differences , &quot; he said . Then Frankel and art_director Don Anderson started their own firm with a leased office and a_few workers . Frankel later bought Anderson out , keeping the firm ' s name . By 1990 , Frankel saw that technology had advanced so far that he could earn more by working alone . He set_up his home_office with $ 35 # 000 in equipment , and developed a network of photographers , illustrators , media buyers and other on-line service providers . Along the way , Frankel has accepted stock or options in some of his clients in exchange for lower fees . Among the companies Frankel has equity in are Right Start Inc. , a Westlake Village mail-order firm ; GeoWorks , an Alameda software developer that recently raised more_than $ 10 million in its initial public stock offering , and Adaptive Software Inc. , a fast-growing Newport Beach developer of employee scheduling software . Stan Fridstein , Right Start ' s president , said Frankel started doing ad work for his company around 1985 when it couldn ' t afford a big agency . He kept going_back to Frankel even after Right Start grew_into a much larger and profitable company because , Fridstein said , Frankel is &quot; a streamed-down version of the sloth-like agencies. &quot; And soon , Frankel believes , the difference between cutting-edge ad_agencies and others will be even more evident with the coming of interactive television . Some big ad_agencies have formed_divisions to study the_matter . Frankel said he ' s ready now to produce interactive ads , he ' s just waiting for the market to develop .</TEXT>
