   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY VALUES : A WEEKLY COLUMN BY RON GALPERIN : SELF-SUFFICIENT HOMES BREAKING NEW GROUND ; ENERGY : ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY AND HEAT ARE BECOMING MORE SOPHISTICATED , BUT TOTAL ENERGY INDEPENDENCE IS STILL IN THE FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sylmar residents Ivan and Elke Forbes like being self-sufficient . A 45-foot wind_generator in their back yard services most of their electricity needs . The Forbes family also uses solar_panels to heat their water , warm their home and run their refrigerator . When the sun is strong or the wind is really blowing , the Forbeses generate enough power to apply to the Department of Water and Power for a credit on their already low utility bill . Ted Baumgart and his family in La Crescenta have also whittled_down their utility bill with an array of solar_panels that heat the pool and spa and that power everything from the refrigerator to an indoor / outdoor train set . The Baumgarts don ' t need to worry about heating and cooling bills thanks to concrete floors that were specially designed to keep the home cool in summer and warm in winter . Most of the solar_panels -- which cost $ 300 to $ 350 each -- have more_than paid_for themselves , Baumgart said . Is energy independence coming_to your home soon ? Can solar_panels and wind_generators increase your property values ? The answer to these questions is probably no -- at least in the near future . Alternative_energy technology is becoming more sophisticated , however , and property_owners can now at least begin to consider powering their homes without help from an electric or gas_company . Ivan Forbes isn ' t sure he has broken_even yet on the money he spent on a giant wind_generator . He does , however , save a substantial amount_of_money on his utility bill and he has benefited from both federal and state tax_breaks . The system ' s $ 20 # 000 cost may help explain why the Forbeses are one of the very few families in Southern California to have their home powered by the wind . Forbes says the highest monthly electric_bill he gets is $ 70 . Many homeowners also don ' t have the space or the inclination or the permission of local authorities to build a silo-like structure in their yard . Because they back_up against a power_company right-of-way , Ivan Forbes said , he has gotten no complaints from neighbors since erecting the generator more_than a decade ago . The wind_generator in Ivan Forbes ' yard looks nothing like the ones you may have seen en route to Palm Springs . Instead , this generator has a round metal frame that lets_in wind through vents . The wind then drives a series of spinning buckets . The energy then travels through an electronic system that converts it into AC electricity . The home is also powered with the help of solar_panels -- also known as photovoltaic panels -- which heat both the water and the 2 # 000-square-foot house . Of course , solar_power has been touted as a wave of the future for about 20 years now . But there are more advanced technologies in_use now and already , many solar thermal systems are being used to heat pools , spas and water for home use , said Bob Ellis , president of Environmental Solar Design Inc. in North Hollywood . Solar electric systems -- which actually produce electricity , as opposed to solar thermal systems which just heat water -- are more expensive and less well-developed , he said . &quot; It ' s still a small percentage of the market. &quot; Ellis , who has been in the solar business for about 10 years , says he does a great_deal of his business installing systems to heat pools and spas . &quot; Pools are very expensive to heat , &quot; he said , &quot; so solar_panels enable people to better utilize their pool. &quot; A typical solar_system costs between $ 2 # 500 and $ 6 # 000 to install . Not having to use gas or electricity to heat your pool can save $ 2 # 500 in the first year alone though . The system works basically by pumping water from the pool through solar_panels that attract the heat of the sun . The water circulates during the day and hot water is kept_in an insulated holding tank at night . * There are various types of solar water heating_systems for the home -- some with and some without a pump , Ellis explained . The cost is generally about $ 2 # 500 to $ 4 # 000 . The annual utility savings are about $ 300 to $ 600 for customers who currently heat their water with gas . The savings will be more significant for people who now heat their water with electricity or propane . ( Incidentally , there is a 10 % federal tax_credit for business and commercial uses of solar_energy . But neither the state of California nor the federal_government currently provide tax incentives for residential use of solar panels. ) Homeowners who live_in remote parts of the Valley and Ventura County are now being encouraged to use solar_power instead of hooking_up to a utility . These so-called off-grid customers now qualify for a Southern California Edison program that allows the property_owners to lease a solar_system with a option to buy . &quot; Homeowners in remote locations can get clean , quiet electricity , &quot; said Wayne Gould , manager of photovoltaic applications for Southern California Edison . &quot; This allows us to provide electrical service to people who haven ' t been customers. &quot; He called the solar program a &quot; harmonious marriage between us and third-party power providers who provide solar panels. &quot; While solar-powered homes can provide much of the electricity needed to run a home , there are very few homes that are totally self-sufficient . This is especially true for residents who want to run lots of appliances at one time . There are a growing number of options though . One way to learn about some of the options for energy self-sufficiency or so-called renewable energy is by taking a tour of the Forbes home and another energy-independent home_in Oxnard . Local tours are being organized from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Oct . 15 by Real Goods Trading Corp. , a Ukiah-based seller of renewable energy products . More information about the free tours is available by calling ( 800 ) 762-7325 .</TEXT>
