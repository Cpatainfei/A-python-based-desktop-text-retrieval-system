   <HEADLINE> THOUSANDS IN MEXICO MARCH TO BACK INDIANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thousands of workers , peasants and students marched through the Mexican_capital Friday demanding an end to the military_force used to fight Indian guerrillas who are threatening to spread their rebellion beyond the remote hills of southern Mexico . The government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , already badly shaken by the uprising that has claimed more_than 100 lives , now faces mounting political protest over the decision to launch a vigorous ground and air assault against the rebels . Human_rights and church officials fear civilian casualties , and there have been reports of apparent extrajudicial executions of suspected guerrillas . The Zapatista National Liberation Army , as the rebels call themselves , claimed responsibility for toppling two electrical towers late Thursday night in the states of Michoacan and Puebla , south of Mexico_City . Officials confirmed the damage Friday but said power was not interrupted . As new details emerged about their origins , the Zapatista rebels vowed to wage their self-proclaimed &quot; war &quot; against the Mexican government in the capital and , in communiques faxed to newspaper and wire_service offices , invited followers to join in acts of sabotage . Support for the rebels spread to Los Angeles , where hundreds of demonstrators gathered noisily but peacefully Friday night in front of the Mexican Consulate in the Wilshire District to condemn the Mexican government ' s tactics in putting_down the uprising . In the_hills surrounding San Cristobal de las Casas in the southern Chiapas state where the violence began New Year ' s Day , government troops in helicopter gunships and armored personnel_carriers continued hunting rebels who have largely retreated from the towns they first occupied . Thousands of soldiers conducted house-to-house searches in San Cristobal , while sporadic air_attacks continued to be reported near the towns of Tenejapa and Cancuuc , the seats of the two poorest townships in impoverished Chiapas . The most deadly armed rebellion in Mexico in decades has cast a rare -- and perhaps unwanted -- spotlight on this country ' s military , traditionally the silent_partner in Mexican government . With an estimated 12 # 000 troops deployed to fight the rebels , the army has been thrust into the unfamiliar role of guerrilla warfare . And with that comes unfamiliar scrutiny . &quot; The army has been a taboo subject here . Now there are public questions about the role it is playing , what human_rights violations have been committed , who is the army accountable to , &quot; said Mexican political_scientist Denise Dresser . &quot; And this will lead to greater questions about the Mexican government itself. &quot; In contrast to Central_America , where armies traditionally exert control over civilian authorities , Mexico ' s military and civilian powers operate under an agreement whereby the army submits to civilian order but the government does not interfere with military internal affairs . The army is rarely criticized in public . &quot; The military does not want to be the fall_guy for the failure of civilian political decisions that were made or not made , &quot; said Roderic Camp , a political_scientist at Tulane University who has written_on the Mexican military . &quot; Therefore the civilian leadership has to move very gingerly in terms of what it asks the military to do and what restrictions it places on the military to carry_out those functions. &quot; The army killed dozens , perhaps hundreds , of students in a demonstration in 1968 , but not since a movement led by Lucio Cabanas in the southern Sierra Madre range_in the early 1970s has the Mexican army had to fight guerrilla warfare . For nearly eight years , Cabanas rallied rebels in Guerrero state before he was slain by the army . For image-conscious Salinas , who has used most of his five years in office to portray Mexico as modernizing democracy and reliable trade partner , the surfacing allegations of human_rights abuse pose yet another public relations headache . The president took great pains in a nationally televised speech Thursday night to praise the army in the face of those reports . &quot; The army and the state security_forces are fulfilling their responsibility according to the law , &quot; he said , denying that troops would attack civilian populations . But his comments did little to assuage the mostly leftist demonstrators who marched Friday down Mexico_City ' s La Reforma boulevard , chanting for an end to the &quot; massacre &quot; in Chiapas . Many of the protesters , estimated at about 6 # 000 , said they did not support the rebels ' use of violence but said they agreed fully with the demands of land , political freedom and social justice that the rebels say they are fighting for . &quot; We are showing solidarity with the political protest , &quot; said Jose L . Ortiz , a 56-year-old Nahuas Indian who walked near the head of the march . &quot; If the people in Chiapas reached this extreme ( of violence ) , then it is because of the political errors of this government and past governments . These people have been ignored for centuries. &quot; Still , some of the protesters carried banners supporting the Zapatista rebels , including one that bore a portrait of Emiliano Zapata , the revolutionary war hero whose name the rebels have borrowed . At the Los Angeles march , 400 demonstrators marched along the sidewalk outside the consulate , chanting &quot; Viva La Revolucion &quot; and waving signs proclaiming &quot; Stop the Massacre of the Maya. &quot; Costumed performers danced to the beat of a drum . There was no response from the consulate , which was closed for the day . Late Friday , the government ' s attorney_general ' s office said autopsies had been completed on 30 bodies recovered at Ocosingo , scene of the heaviest fighting . Reporters had discovered bodies at Ocosingo with signs of having had their hands tied behind their backs and with single shots to the head . But the government ' s examiners concluded that only one of the dead might have been the victim of an illegal execution . Officials Friday did not address the signs that the rebels may have a larger network than first thought , as the destruction of the electrical towers could suggest . In addition , the literature distributed by the organization is sophisticated , apparently using offset_printing , photos and colors . All along , however , Salinas and his aides have insisted that rather than an indigenous movement , the Zapatista army is controlled by non-Indian &quot; professionals &quot; who have received help from Guatemalan or Salvadoran leftists . However , researchers who live_in San Cristobal said that after talking to the rebels when they invaded , they believe most of them are from eastern parts of the state that were jungle a generation ago . &quot; They said they were tired_of not being listened to , tired_of repression , &quot; said Ron Nye , an anthropologist who has worked in southern Mexico for 24 years . The rebels are mainly the descendants of Tzeltal Indians who were resettled to the Lacandon Rain_Forest 25 years ago , he said . Their parents were landless peasants who rented farms or worked for cattle ranchers in the area around Ocosingo , about 50 miles northeast of San Cristobal . &quot; The government has seen the Lacandon as an escape_valve , &quot; said Nye , who is also an organic agronomist . &quot; They were given land , but they were not given support. &quot; With no other alternative , they turned_to the slash-and-burn farming that they had used in the highlands , said Will Hoffman , cultural projects coordinator at Casa Na Bolom , a research_center in San Cristobal . In the delicate jungle , the effect was devastating . The thin layer of jungle topsoil was soon destroyed . In recent years , the situation has worsened as the price of coffee , one crop they could grow , has plummeted and the government has removed farm price_supports as part of its free market economic reforms , Nye said . Nye bristled_at government statements that the peasants were fooled into the uprising by foreigners . &quot; It is racist to say that the Indians were tricked , &quot; he said . &quot; They are much more aware of the risks than the government is giving them credit for , at least publicly. &quot; Military officials said they have arrested 106 suspected rebels .
