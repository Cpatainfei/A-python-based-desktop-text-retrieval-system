   <TEXT> Study Finds Doubled Violence Coverage : The three network evening TV newscasts doubled their coverage of crime and violence around the country last year , even though the nation ' s overall crime_rate remains essentially unchanged , according to the Washington ' s Center for Media and Public Affairs . A survey by the center also found that coverage of murders was three times as high in 1993 as in 1992 , while the national murder rate remained steady . The networks aired 1 # 632 domestic crime stories -- accounting_for one of every eight spots , the survey found . NBC had the highest tally with 626 , followed by CBS with 557 and ABC with 449 . This compared to 1992 when they aired only 830 crime stories -- one of every 18 reported . &quot; People ' s fear of crime doesn ' t come from looking over their shoulders , &quot; said Robert Lichter , the center ' s co-director . &quot; It comes from looking_at their television screens. &quot; ABC news anchor Peter Jennings , while noting that he generally distrusts &quot; counts without context &quot; by TV researchers , said that he too has noticed a surge in TV news ' coverage of violence , coinciding with increasing public concern . * Fox Tries Kids Radio : Fox Children ' s Network is breaking_into radio with the launch of Fox Kids Radio , a &quot; global kids radio network &quot; scheduled to begin May 8 with a weekly two-hour countdown of songs chosen by children and teens . &quot; By creating Fox Kids Radio , we have the opportunity to . . . create a unique entertainment source for children , &quot; said Fox Chairman Lucie Salhany .
