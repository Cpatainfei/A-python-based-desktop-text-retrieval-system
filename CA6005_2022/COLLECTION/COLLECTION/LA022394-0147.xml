   <HEADLINE> NO HORNS OF DILEMMA ; CALIFORNIA ' S TULE ELK , ONCE NEAR EXTINCTION , ARE HERE TO STAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the green pickup_truck bounces slowly over the dusty road , toward several large tule elk grazing in a meadow , the animals turn and stare cautiously , but show no signs of fear . Maury Morning_Star drives on , and the bull elk , some with impressive antlers , resume grazing . Soon they will drop their antlers and start growing new ones . In the spring , the females will begin calving , and in the heat of summer , during the rutting season , the strongest male will bugle loudly to warn the smaller bulls that he is the master and that the cows are his and his only . Antlers are sure to tangle . Such is life for the 28 tule elk confined to the Tule Elk State Reserve , a 956-acre spread of flat grassland and a_few small marshes , surrounded by a seemingly endless expanse of cotton fields and cattle_ranches . And such is life for Morning_Star , of the Department of Parks and Recreation , who takes visitors on prearranged tours over the reserve and whose job it is to see that no harm comes_to the animals . For the visitor , it might seem a sad state of affairs for the elk to have to live behind a fence after thriving in this region in much the way bison once roamed the Great Plains . But fence or no , they still have the chance to drop their antlers in favor of new and larger ones , to bring little tule elk into the world and , for some anyway , to mate with female tule elk . &quot; They do OK , &quot; Morning_Star says . And because they do , so do free-roaming herds of tule elk throughout California . Since it opened in 1932 , Tule Elk State Reserve has been supplying elk for the California Department of Fish and Game ' s reintroduction program , which has succeeded in bringing the animals back from possibly as few as two in the late 1800s to nearly 3 # 000 in 22 herds scattered throughout California . &quot; The fact that there are more_than 2 # 700 animals now is pretty remarkable , &quot; says Jon Fischer , elk project coordinator for the DFG . &quot; Especially when you consider that we had very few elk at one point_in_time -- definitely less than 20 , maybe less than 10 and maybe only two . I doubt that there are too many other animals on earth that have gotten_down that low in numbers that have recovered. &quot; * Tule elk , one of three subspecies of elk in California , used to roam the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys by the thousands , some belonging_to herds as large as 2 # 000 . Their range extended from Butte County north of Sacramento to Buena Vista Lake near Bakersfield in Kern County , and from the foothills of the western slope of the Sierra_Nevada across the Great Valley to the coastal mountain_ranges . An account in 1850 by a hiker walking from Stockton to Mariposa told of &quot; bands of elk , deer and antelope in such numbers that they actually darkened the plains for miles , and looked in the distance like great herds of cattle. &quot; But by then , the tule elks ' demise had already begun . The &quot; fur-brigades , &quot; starting in 1827 , had made a substantial impact on the animals . But it was the Gold_Rush in 1848 , and the influx of settlers it generated , that brought the animals to the brink of extinction . Cattle prices rose steadily during the period , and cheaper elk meat became increasingly popular among settlers and miners . Rather than waste ammunition on the animals , some hunters , or vaqueros , would ride alongside huge herds of fleeing elk and bring them down one by one with a swipe across the hind_legs with a long-handled machete , or luna . By 1850 , the herds of the Sacramento Valley were completely wiped_out . And not long after , only a small herd remained in California , in the tule marshes near Buena Vista Lake . But hunters were relentless , pursuing the animals in boats with lookouts atop a ladder on the mast to see over the tules . Draining of the reservoirs for agricultural development further exposed the animals , and by 1870 the tule elk subspecies -- later identified as such -- appeared to have ceased to exist . But in 1875 , two tule elk -- possibly the last pair -- were sighted in the marshes near Buena Vista Lake on the Miller and Lux Ranch . Henry Miller , by ordering his employees to protect the tule elk on his ranch , began a process that would eventually enable the animals to recover . The elk on Miller and Lux reproduced and the herd grew rapidly ; then in 1904 , the two ranchers offered part of the herd to the government . The offer was accepted and the first elk roundup and drive was organized . Not long after the drive was under way , the first elk stampede occurred . According to an account in The Times in 1905 , the animals cooperated until they neared a pen , at which time &quot; the wildest terror prevailed , and the herd stampeded , heading for the_hills . Once there , all_the work of the vaqueros would count for naught . &quot; Throwing caution to the wind , they spurred their cow_ponies on in pursuit to head them off . Failing in this , some had recourse to their lassos , and in a_few minutes a dozen or more of the animals were roped. &quot; Once in the pen , which was surrounded by dozens of onlookers , they began &quot; hurling themselves against the fence and against each other one minute , then huddling_together in abject terror the next. &quot; Several died in the fury , and of the handful of animals that made_it into the railroad_cars , only one would survive the trip to the government ' s pen in Sequoia National_Park on the Kaweah River . But by 1914 , the Miller and Lux herd had grown to 400 animals , and they caused such damage to the alfalfa fields and fences that small groups of animals were shipped to other locations . Miller died in 1917 , and the property was subdivided into smaller ranches , whose farmers eventually petitioned the government for relief from elk depredation on their lands . &quot; The fact of the_matter is that tule elk have a very large home_range -- they ' ll wander a great distance , &quot; DFG coordinator Fischer says . &quot; They don ' t respect fences . They don ' t respect agricultural crops in any way shape or form . . . and that sets the stage for conflict. &quot; In 1932 , the State Tule Elk Reserve was established , and about 175 animals on the former Miller and Lux were given a home . From there , some were moved to start new homes for California ' s smallest of three subspecies of elk , reaching weights of about 600 pounds . Tule Elk State Reserve became &quot; the source , &quot; according to Fischer . More_than 400 tule elk have been relocated from Tule Elk State Reserve since it opened , one as recently as last summer to add a bull to another herd that had been plagued by poachers . The herd in the Owens valley has about 400 elk . The largest , near San Luis Obispo , numbers about 600 , and Fischer said its range could soon extend_to the point where it merges with another herd farther north . &quot; It ' s clear we ' re not going_to have 500 # 000 tule elk in California ever again , &quot; Fischer says . &quot; There ' s no chance of that . But we ' re in a heck of a lot better shape now than we were 20 years ago , or than we were 120 years ago. &quot; Relocation is much easier now through the use of tranquilizer guns and helicopter transports , but finding suitable habitat remains a chief obstacle in expanding the herds , which are currently managed through controlled hunts . Still , with the help of such groups as the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation , Nature Conservancy and Safari Club , enough money has been raised and habitat found to put the animals back on the map , so to speak . * Morning_Star , driving his green pickup back toward the office near the front gate of the reserve , approaches several female tule elk and a_few spike bulls that had moved_in to mingle . Their heads all turn at once to watch him drive past . He tells of the time several elk once jumped over the 7-foot fence surrounding the reserve , but when approached by park personnel , they jumped back over . &quot; I really believe that the elk know they ' re safe here , &quot; Morning_Star says , &quot; because I ' ve seen where people come_up_to the viewing area and they ' ll be literally feet away from the animal , and the animal just walks like nothing is wrong , right past the people . But if you get_on the other side of the fence like we did , they just take_off -- they won ' t let you near them. &quot; Who can blame them ?</TEXT>
