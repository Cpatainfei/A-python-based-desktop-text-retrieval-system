   <HEADLINE> VALLEY COMMENTARY ; THE TALK OF THE TOWN ; A SOUTH BAY RESIDENT MOVES TO THE VALLEY AND HAS TO LEARN A WHOLE NEW LANGUAGE -- FILMEZE . ALL DISCUSSIONS ARE CENTERED ON SHOW_BUSINESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Are you in The Industry ? &quot; I was asked at a party one night soon after I moved to the San Fernando Valley . &quot; Industry ? &quot; I repeated , blankly . &quot; Yes . Aren ' t you in The Business ? &quot; &quot; What business ? &quot; I asked innocently . The hostess interrupted almost apologetically . &quot; John ' s a writer . . . for magazines. &quot; There was an awkward pause as my companions looked_into their drinks before moving toward a group discussing the character development pertinent to the thematic structure of Martin Scorsese ' s latest film . When I moved to the Valley from the South Bay beach area , I knew there would be a lot of changes . Hotter summers , bigger traffic_jams , better bagels . What I didn ' t expect was a language_barrier . I don ' t speak Filmeze . Oh , they treat you fine here at first , until they find_out you ' re not &quot; at &quot; one of the studios . ( Proper declension : &quot; I ' m at Fox , you ' re at Universal , he , she , it ' s at Disney. &quot; ) If the initials MCI , DGA or at the very least SAG do not follow your name , you may as well move to Pomona . Ph.D. or DDS doesn ' t cut it in this part of town . With most of the major studios located in the Valley , everyone is in the know and all discussions are centered_on show_business . Just eavesdrop at any watering_hole in town . If it ' s not studio executive wanna-bes discussing the points in Sly ' s latest three-picture play-or-pay mega-deal , it ' s screenwriters whose high conceptual imagery spec script is just this far from Spielberg ' s desk . Ask the waitress how she is and she ' ll tell you she is up for something , as in &quot; I am up for a ' Family Matters. ' &quot; This is actor ' s lingo for auditioning . To further translate , it means they ' re unemployed at the time . And I thought high_school Latin was difficult . As someone not associated with the film business ( although I was a movie usher_in high_school ) , I felt_like an outsider from the moment I passed LAX and mounted Sepulveda Pass . While looking_at houses , the real_estate_agent ( who was up for a &quot; Murder She Wrote &quot; ) would swear the house once belonged_to a celebrity -- as if living_in a house that Norma Desmond once owned could make_up for hideous bathroom tile . I soon learned there are five seasons in the Valley -- winter , spring , summer , fall and pilot . It was truly a one-industry town . Almost every store I walked into had walls bedecked with autographed celebrity photos , all but promising that Cher would be wandering back to the carwash that very afternoon . * At newsstands , Time magazine is buried beneath Dramaloge , the Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety , and everyone is always discussing a meeting they took about their production company ' s syndication package which has just been given the green_light if everyone involved can agree to something called &quot; the points. &quot; Doesn ' t anyone talk_about football here ? It ' s not that we weren ' t show_biz savvy in the South Bay . After all , the lady who played Marlo ' s mother on &quot; That Girl &quot; lives in Palos Verdes . And didn ' t Chuck Norris once have a Karate Studio in Torrance ? But down south , you could talk to someone without the phrase &quot; studio shake-up &quot; occurring . People actually spoke_of politics and world situations and family concerns that were not fodder for a movie of the week . Here , my neighbors all go_to work_at the high-walled studios , and although they tell me they are gaffers or best boys or grips , I ' ve decided not to ask exactly what that entails . They all wear those trendy studio jackets and baseball_caps emblazoned with the logos of popular television or films ( available only to cast and crews of shows , they will point_out proudly ) and are always ending stories with &quot; Well , you know how Eisner is . . . &quot; while everyone nods in_agreement . Is there a secret handshake as well ? I haven ' t felt this left_out since I didn ' t letter in high_school . But one adapts . After a_few weeks of living here , I listened and learned ( I ' ve always had an ear for languages ) . Now , at parties when introduced to strangers , I find myself smiling and saying &quot; I ' m a free-lance writer . . . . But what I really want to do is direct. &quot;</TEXT>
