   <HEADLINE> ON A SILVER PLATTER ; IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT TO MARKET FILMS ON CD-ROMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Martin Greenwald is not above gimmicks . The CEO of Image Entertainment Inc. says the company ' s soon-to-be-released movies on CD-ROM may sell chiefly as novelty items -- but that ' s fine with him . With more_than 7 million computers in the country now equipped for CD-ROM , reaching even a fraction of that market could mean big sales . &quot; Maybe it will be just one out of 10 who buy them , but I will be the big guy in that business , &quot; Greenwald said . CD-ROM , which stands_for Compact Disc-Read Only Memory , are five-inch computer discs that look_like audio_compact_discs . But CD-ROMs are played_on computers , not stereos , and they contain images and sounds for interactive games or educational software programs . Image Entertainment , which is controlled by billionaire John Kluge , for years has had only modest success in its licensing and distribution of movies on laser discs , 12-inch silver platters that transmit high-quality images on television screens . Laser disc players never took_off the way VCRs did . As a result , Image Entertainment laid_off 17 % of its work_force last year . That cost-cutting helped the company report a record profit of $ 3.4 million on sales of $ 66.2 million for the fiscal_year that ended March 31 . A year prior , Image lost $ 17 million on sales of $ 60.4 million . Unlike laser discs , Image is entering a CD-ROM market in which the required delivery systems are already widespread . The number of personal_computers equipped with CD-ROM_drives in the United States is expected to reach more_than 15 million by the end of the year , and CD-ROM_drives are fast becoming a standard feature of personal_computers , said Rich Bowers , executive_director of the Optical Publishing Assn . in Columbus , Ohio . By contrast , Greenwald estimates the number of laser disc players in_use to be 1.5 million . But CD-ROM offers Image a way to expand while not straying far from the technology it knows best . Like laser discs , Image ' s CD-ROMs are thin silver platters read by lasers . Pop one of Image ' s new CD-ROMs into your computer and action-packed flicks reel past in a postcard-sized square that fills a quarter of the screen . The picture is small , limited by current CD-ROM technology , and it ' s jerkier than a VCR ' s . But Image ' s CD-ROMs have the advantage of providing instant freeze-frames and printouts , and they ' re IBM and Macintosh compatible . And the movies Image will be selling ? &quot; Exploitative titles , &quot; Greenwald calls them , meaning movies packed with scenes of spurting blood , bursts of flame and , in all likelihood , sex and nudity . Among the first titles scheduled to be released beginning in October are &quot; Silence of the Lambs , &quot; &quot; Robocop , &quot; &quot; The Terminator &quot; and &quot; Nemesis. &quot; Image Entertainment is also a licensee of Playboy Home Video . Greenwald , a former distributor of pornographic movies , declined to say whether any Playboy movies are among the initial 24 titles on CD-ROM to be released . But he said such fare would be highly marketable in a computer format . &quot; I don ' t see putting ' Terms of Endearment ' on CD-ROM , &quot; he said . Japanese animation films are also top candidates for CD-ROM distribution . &quot; Thirteen- and 14-year-old kids , that ' s really where it ' s at , &quot; Greenwald said . Greenwald said the CD-ROM films will retail for between $ 14 and $ 20 , far less than the $ 40 to $ 100 that many CD-ROM software programs now cost . Image can do this because much of the work required for selling laser discs -- including editing , post-production work , licensing and distribution -- is easily transferred to CD-ROM . Image has spent about $ 12 # 000 per title to produce CD-ROM versions of movies , half what it would cost had Image not already been producing films on laser disc , Greenwald said . Its total investment in CD-ROM development is about $ 500 # 000 . that ' s not to say Image plans to abandon laser discs , said Greenwald . The company has an estimated 35 % market share_in the laser-disc business , and has exclusive licensing_agreements with Walt Disney ' s Buena Vista Home Video , FoxVideo , Orion Home Video and others . Although their popularity has by no means matched videocassettes , laser discs have a following among film buffs , and their sales have grown steadily . With his bold print shirts and his zebra-striped chairs , Greenwald seems an unlikely corporate_executive , much less a techno-whiz leading a new_wave of multimedia publishing . His office decor pits chrome and glass furniture against walls crowded with art . Photos of his daughter , age 13 , jostle with prints of models in seductive poses . Greenwald says it ' s true that the films he ' ll dish_out to computer-addicted adolescents are not especially uplifting . &quot; But it sells , &quot; he said . &quot; And my mission is to sell CD-ROM. &quot; Some , however , question the appeal of CD-ROM movies , which , unlike many games on CD-ROM , require users to simply watch , rather than interact , with their computers . &quot; Maybe I ' m strange , but . . . I , for one , have never sat and watched a two-hour movie at a 14-inch distance from the screen , &quot; said Gary Arlen , president of Arlen Communications Inc. , a Bethesda , Md. , multimedia research company . &quot; Why would anyone buy the CD-ROM when they already have the videotape sitting on the shelf ? &quot; asked David Clevinger , assistant marketing manager of the monthly trade journal Multimedia Monitor . Greenwald counters that consumers may choose to watch movies in snippets , rewinding to view favorite scenes . To make the CD-ROMs more appealing_to collectors , Image plans to include movie trailers and screen_savers -- scenes from movies that roll by on the screen when the computer is turned_off . Whatever its merits , Image is adding a new dimension to the realm of software publishing by attempting to mass market full-length feature_films on computers . The Voyager Co . of New York broke new ground in this area when it released the first Beatles movie , &quot; A Hard Day ' s Night , &quot; on CD-ROM last year . But many of the CD-ROM films available now are pornographic ones , which have found a thriving underground market , said Bower of the Optical Publishing Assn . Even analysts who doubt there ' s much demand for &quot; The Terminator &quot; on CD-ROM say Image ' s strategy could pay_off . With the market for multimedia publishing still in its infancy , companies with an early start will have &quot; a nice hedge against future competition , &quot; said consultant Nick Arnett , of the Multimedia Computing Corp . in Campbell , Calif . Trouble is , the ultimate form hardware and software will take_in this emerging market is still anyone ' s guess . Will they be discs for computers or discs for television ? &quot; It ' s not clear really which format will be the format , &quot; said Christopher Marlett , an analyst with Drake Capital Securities in Santa Monica . Image Entertainment knows that all too well . After years of trying to peddle laser discs to a nation enamored of VCRs , it ' s no wonder Greenwald is leery of bold claims for the future of CD-ROM . He sticks_to more limited pronouncements : &quot; We aim to sell to that one in 10 , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re Niche Industries Inc. &quot;</TEXT>
