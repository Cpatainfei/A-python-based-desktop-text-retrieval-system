   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA GENERAL TELLS CHECHENS : WE WON ' T SHOOT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The commander of one of three Russian tank columns sent to subdue the breakaway Chechnya republic said Friday that his men will not advance further or open_fire on civilians regardless of what orders he receives . &quot; Our bosses may curse us , but we won ' t shoot , &quot; Maj . Gen . Ivan Babichev told hundreds of unarmed villagers who blocked their way 20 miles west of this rebel capital . &quot; And please , don ' t let ( the rebels ) shoot either . . . . We really want everything to be peaceful so the tanks will leave with flowers. &quot; Babichev ' s emotional speech was the most dramatic sign of wavering and dissent in Moscow ' s largest military operation since the disastrous Soviet war in Afghanistan -- one aimed at crushing the self-declared independence of a tiny ethnic republic of 1.2 million people . &quot; This ( operation ) contradicts the constitution , &quot; the general added . &quot; It is forbidden to use the army against peaceful civilians . It is not our fault . We did not want this. &quot; The army ' s sluggish , hesitant advance on Grozny prompted Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin on Thursday to extend_to midnight tonight a deadline for Chechen secessionist fighters to surrender their weapons . Fighting all but stopped Friday as Chechnya ' s Muslim secessionist leader ordered his warriors to pull_back to this capital and joined Yeltsin in calling a cease-fire . But it was unclear whether a new round of peace talks proposed by both leaders would materialize before the midnight deadline . Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin said Yeltsin authorized him to meet with Chechnya ' s separatist president , Gen . Dzhokar M . Dudayev , but added that thousands of Russian troops closing in on Grozny , the rebel capital , &quot; will go_to the end &quot; to enforce the ultimatum -- a mission for which the troops appeared unenthusiastic . Dudayev announced that he was ready to hold &quot; high-level talks without preconditions &quot; but demanded that Russia withdraw the troops , who entered Chechnya on Sunday . Lower-level peace talks broke_down Wednesday when Moscow refused to pull the soldiers out . Chernomyrdin summoned Russia ' s defense , interior and counterintelligence chiefs to an evening session of the Security_Council to plot the next move . This decaying industrial city awoke Friday to a 30-minute barrage of artillery_fire on its northern outskirts , then experienced a tense lull . About half of Grozny ' s 400 # 000 residents have fled , leaving thousands of hard-core resisters behind . &quot; Freedom or death ! Chechnya is a subject of Allah , &quot; declared a giant chalk marker on_the_road into Grozny from the east . Russia ' s Interior Ministry , in an estimate that appears conservative , said 13 # 000 Chechens were armed for the fight -- with 100 tanks and armored personnel_carriers , 40 big antiaircraft_guns and 50 # 000 firearms . While portraying Chechnya as an internal Russian problem , the Clinton_Administration has expressed concern about its explosive potential here in Russia ' s Caucasus Mountains , a volatile , ethnically mixed area close to Turkey and the Middle_East . U.S. Vice_President Al Gore and Defense_Secretary William J . Perry met in Moscow with Russian leaders Friday and said the Kremlin was trying to resolve the conflict with a minimum of bloodshed . * &quot; I got the clear impression that they very much prefer a negotiated outcome there , if it is possible , &quot; Gore said after talks with Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin . &quot; We have urged negotiations . We are following it carefully . It ' s immensely complicated. &quot; Perry said Russian defense officials briefed him on their tactics in Chechnya , but he declined to talk_about them . The occupation of Chechnya has set_off a storm of protest in Russia , isolating Yeltsin with a small circle of hard-liners . Calls_for peace swelled Friday , joined by the Russian Orthodox patriarch and Chechnya ' s Muslim religious_leader , who met in Moscow . Perhaps to give peace a chance , or perhaps to give his troops time to position themselves for war , Yeltsin on Thursday extended the disarmament deadline by 48 hours . Russian field commanders , while waging sporadic combat against Chechens resisting their advance , have been saying all week that they do not intend to attack the city . While aimed at winning goodwill in a hostile place , such comments raise doubts about how much force Russia ' s troops and commanders would be willing to use if peace efforts fail and they were ordered to enter the rebel capital . Some Russian soldiers taking_part in the occupation have expressed outright opposition to it . &quot; The mood among the ( Russian ) soldiers is despondent , &quot; one tank commander told the newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda . &quot; Once again , the army is being used to cover the sins of politicians . It is like Afghanistan for us here. &quot; At least 15 Russian soldiers have been killed in Chechnya this week , and 20 more are being held prisoner . Reporters have counted scores of civilian casualties in Russian shelling and air_attacks . The Russian government moved Friday to tighten its control on information from Chechnya . It ordered Russian media to carry official accounts of fighting along with their own , and warned foreigners to stay out of Chechnya for their own safety .
