   <HEADLINE> CULTURE ; RESURRECTION TO ATONE FOR SINS OF SOVIET PAST ; YELTSIN SAYS REBUILDING A MOSCOW TEMPLE DESTROYED BY STALIN WILL HERALD A RETURN TO RUSSIA ' S LOST HERITAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If one piece of real_estate symbolizes the struggle for Russia ' s soul , it is a 984-foot-wide pit by the Moscow River not far from the Kremlin . Until last week , when construction workers fenced it off and drained it , the place was a complex of outdoor swimming_pools . But that was only one chapter in a bizarre history now coming full circle . In Chapter One , the world ' s largest Orthodox cathedral stood there . Consecrated in 1883 , the Temple of Christ the Savior accommodated 15 # 000 worshipers , a grandiose monument to the dual authority -- secular and divine -- of the czar . In Chapter Two , Christ the Savior became one of the world ' s largest demolition projects when Soviet dictator Josef Stalin decided to replace it with a temple to Communist supremacy . Looted and dynamited , the cathedral crumbled in 1931 and Stalin commissioned work_on a Palace of Soviets that was to stand taller than the Empire_State Building . But the swampy site proved incapable of supporting such a monster -- divine punishment , believers say . With the coming of World_War_II , and then Stalin ' s death , the palace never got_off_the_ground . Chapter Three , in 1960 , saw the abandoned site turned_into a network of heated pools , where bathers could frolic in subfreezing weather while steam rose from the water . Now , in Chapter Four , the Russian Orthodox patriarch and Moscow Mayor Yuri M . Luzhkov have unveiled plans to rebuild Christ the Savior on its original site and according to Konstantin Ton ' s 19th-Century design . Luzhkov assigned Mospromstroi , a construction company controlled by the city , to start work . The project and its estimated minimum $ 300-million price_tag are as controversial as the history behind it . Backers , including President Boris N . Yeltsin , say Russia needs the cathedral to herald the return of its lost culture and religion , to atone for excesses of its Soviet past . Critics call the cathedral , built to commemorate Russia ' s defeat of Napoleon in 1812 , a waste_of_money and an inappropriate salute to militarism . &quot; It is time to start this sacred venture , &quot; the mayor said in announcing the project . &quot; Russia is ready financially and , what is more important , morally . Our generation should compensate for the huge damage done to our cathedrals , to the Russian Orthodox Church , to the Russian people. &quot; Since Soviet authorities ended restrictions on religious life five years ago , thousands of Orthodox parishes have sprung to life . Yeltsin and other post-Soviet leaders find it politically prudent to attend services and adopt the causes of Russia ' s dominant church . Luzhkov and Alexy II , the Orthodox patriarch , have set_up a foundation that is supposed to finance the new cathedral entirely with private money -- from the church and its faithful , from bankers and other newly rich entrepreneurs who want their names on a plaque . Skeptics cite Czar Alexander I ' s promise that the original cathedral would be paid_for by donations ; it ended_up costing the state a fortune over 45 years of construction that dragged_on after his death . &quot; If the church is separated from the state , let it build the cathedral and not stretch its hand into my pocket , &quot; said Maria Lukashenko , a Moscow mother of three . The timing of the project is politically driven . Luzhkov wants the outer structure restored for Moscow ' s 850th birthday in 1997 and the inside finished for services by the year 2000 . For such an ambitious work in Russia , the timetable will be hard to meet . And it is uncertain whether the builders can duplicate the 19th-Century techniques that supported a cathedral more_than 30 stories high , laden with marble and granite . Some critics say the remake cannot be more_than an imitation , because so many splendid original icons , sculptures and frescoes were looted . The city is appealing for their return and hopes to get the main altar and dazzling iconostasis back from the Vatican . Others question whether $ 300 million would be_better spent restoring parish churches and religious life -- &quot; the only assurance that the cathedral will not be left empty in future years , &quot; Dmitry Popov wrote in the Moscow Times . On the whole , though , the idea of a new cathedral is popular in Moscow ; one opinion survey showed 65 % backing . &quot; I remember Christ the Savior cathedral from my childhood , &quot; A . P . Dyachenko , 80 , wrote to a Moscow newspaper . &quot; It was so big , and I was so small . I thought that it was God Himself . It must be restored , no question. &quot;</TEXT>
