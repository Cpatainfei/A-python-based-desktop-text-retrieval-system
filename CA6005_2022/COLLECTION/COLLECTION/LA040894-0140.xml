   <HEADLINE> MEDICINE / AIDS RESEARCH ; STUDY SUGGESTS AIDS VIRUS CAN CAUSE CANCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Researchers at UC San Francisco say they have found the first evidence that the human_immunodeficiency_virus , which causes AIDS , also can cause cancer rather than simply make patients susceptible by weakening their immune_system . In a study involving just four AIDS patients with what may be a previously undiscovered form of lymphoma , the scientists reported that the virus had inserted itself into the DNA of malignant_tumors , lodging next to a cancer-causing gene . They theorize that the virus activated this &quot; oncogene , &quot; spawning the malignancy . Top experts , however , are skeptical of the findings . Although lymphoma , or cancer of the lymph system , is common among AIDS patients , previous studies have shown that the cancer is not directly caused by HIV but occurs because the virus depresses the immune_system . If the San Francisco research proves correct , it would mark the first time that scientists have shown that HIV is a direct cause of cancer . &quot; It ' s a totally different perspective of what HIV can do , &quot; said Dr. Michael McGrath , the senior author of the study , which will appear next week in the journal Cancer Research . If the research is confirmed , the study could have broad implications for the treatment of AIDS patients and also the development of an AIDS vaccine . The findings suggest that even if effective treatments for AIDS are developed , those who have HIV could still develop cancer years after being infected with the virus . &quot; If it ' s correct , I think its very important , &quot; said Dr. Irvin Chen , director of the UCLA AIDS Institute . &quot; But I ' m a little skeptical of the data. &quot; The type of lymphoma tumors McGrath and his colleagues studied have never before been identified and contain different properties than those typically found in AIDS patients . Dr. Alexandra Levine , an expert in AIDS-related cancers at USC , said it is possible that what the San Francisco team believes is lymphoma is not a malignancy but simply an abnormal reaction to HIV . &quot; I don ' t believe they have proven in any sense that they have found a new kind of cancer , &quot; Levine said . &quot; It ' s a scientific curiosity that warrants further study , but they are not discussing classic AIDS lymphoma. &quot; In nearly all AIDS patients who have lymphoma , the malignant_tumors are &quot; monoclonal &quot; -- meaning they are derived from one type of cell , almost always a B-cell , an immune_system cell that makes antibodies . A small number of cases -- between 35 and 50 -- have been identified in which the cancer derives from other immune_system cells , called T-cells . But at San Francisco General Hospital , McGrath said , doctors have been seeing an increasing number of lymphomas that are &quot; polyclonal &quot; -- derived from a collection of B-cells , T-cells and also macrophages , a third type of immune_system cells . Over the past decade , McGrath said , he has seen 280 patients with this unusual form of lymphoma . Today , he said , nearly a third of all_the hospital ' s patients with AIDS-related lymphoma have strains that are not derived from B-cells . His team tested tissue from 30 such patients . In four , they reported finding evidence that HIV had integrated itself into the genetic material of the tissue , always in the same spot , next to the cancer-causing gene . Since that time , McGrath said , he has identified three more patients who fit this profile . How frequently this occurs remains unclear . But the study suggests it takes years for this type of lymphoma to develop . As the AIDS epidemic moves_into its second decade and HIV-infected people continue to live longer , more cases are likely to emerge , McGrath said . If the findings are confirmed , they could prove detrimental to efforts to develop an AIDS vaccine , according to Dr. William Blattner , chief of viral epidemiology at the National Cancer Institute . With several vaccine candidates failing to live_up_to their initial promise , Blattner noted that the best prospects may lie_with a &quot; live attenuated vaccine , &quot; formulated with a live , although weakened , form of the AIDS virus . But many scientists fear that a live virus vaccine would be too dangerous , and the San Francisco study may enhance those fears . In other AIDS research , the final results of the controversial Concorde study were published Thursday and confirmed preliminary findings reported a year ago : The drug AZT does not delay the onset of AIDS when given to patients who are infected with HIV but have not yet shown any symptoms . AZT has been shown effective in prolonging the life of patients with full-blown AIDS , and previous studies have suggested it was beneficial to give the drug to patients before they showed symptoms . The Concorde study has cast doubt on the earlier research and generated great debate among doctors about when to prescribe AZT .</TEXT>
