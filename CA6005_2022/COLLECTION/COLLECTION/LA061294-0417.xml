   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / GROUP E PREVIEW ; ITALY AT A GLANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * COACH : Arrigo Sacchi . * KEY PLAYERS : Roberto Baggio , Giuseppe Signori , Franco Baresi . * STRENGTHS : Tradition is_on the Italians ' side , as is the fact that the fans will be there for them in large_numbers . Baggio won the coaches ' vote as the world ' s best player for 1993 . Signori is a proven finisher , having led the Italian League in scoring each of the past two seasons . * WEAKNESSES : As in all tournaments , Italy will be under tremendous pressure to perform , especially after the disappointment of four years ago when it managed only a third-place finish at_home . Sacchi has tried a variety of combinations but none seem to have clicked . Baresi is past his best as a defender and might be exposed . * WORLD CUP HISTORY : Twelve previous appearances . Record of 31-11-12 . Winner in 1934 , 1938 and 1982 ; runner-up in 1970 ; third in 1990 ; fourth in 1978 . * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT : In 1934 , Italy played its first World Cup match and scored a 7-1 victory in Rome . Its opponent was the United States . * OUTLOOK : It will be tough going , but Italy should win its first-round group and then advance to at least the quarterfinals . If the team can finally come_together , the potential is there for it to reach the final , but Germany is a huge obstacle and already has the psychological edge , having beaten the Italians in warm-up play . * PREDICTED FIRST-ROUND FINISH : First . ROSTER 03 # 05 , 23 # 12 No .
