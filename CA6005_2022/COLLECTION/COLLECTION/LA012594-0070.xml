   <HEADLINE> ELECTION UMPIRE CALLS THEM AS HE SEES THEM ; SHYNESS ISN ' T A PROBLEM FOR INDIA ' S T . N . SESHAN , WHO IS PROUD OF DRIVING ' THE FEAR OF GOD ' INTO LAW-BREAKERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> India ' s mandarin-like civil_servants ? No better than &quot; polished call girls. &quot; His own baldness ? &quot; God made some heads beautiful . The others he covered with hair. &quot; It ' s virtually certain that if you live outside India , you ' ve never heard of T . N . Seshan . But if you reside here , you simply can ' t ignore his outspoken , often outrageous views . For three years , the bull-necked career bureaucrat with the gleaming toffee-hued dome has served as India ' s chief election commissioner . His biggest accomplishment ? &quot; I have driven the fear of God into people who broke the system , &quot; he says proudly . In the world ' s single largest democracy -- so huge that a nationwide election mobilizes 550 million voters and more_than 350 registered parties , generates 20 # 000 tons of paper ballots and requires 700 # 000 polling_booths and an army of 3 million to 4.5 million poll workers -- Seshan is the self-defined &quot; umpire. &quot; &quot; The Indian election system is one of the greatest marvels of the world , after the Taj Mahal , &quot; he has mused . So how ' s the umpire doing ? If controversy is the measure , he ' s doing_well indeed . For in the past year , though Seshan commands a full-time staff of only 192 , he arguably became the most important , and certainly the most exasperating and hotly debated , figure in Indian public life . The New Delhi building that houses the Election_Commission is now guarded by a squad of soldiers armed with automatics , and its bulky 60-year-old master is chauffeured around in a limo armored to stop a 5.6-millimeter bullet fired from a yard away . * To understand the danger , it ' s important to realize that intimidating violence , ballot-box stuffing and official manipulation of results used to be as much a part of elections in India as the ritual garland of bright yellow marigolds for the victor . But that was before the &quot; Seshan factor ' kicked_in . Two months ago , 143 million people across northern India were called to the polls to choose their local assemblies . The Times of India approvingly observed that for the first time in years , &quot; the electoral process in five major states was conducted without officially inspired rigging and malpractices. &quot; In Uttar Pradesh , a state particularly notorious for election shenanigans and bullying , there were only two murders . In 1991 , there had been more_than 190 . What did Seshan do ? &quot; In U . P. , I had 40 # 000 central policemen all_over the place , &quot; he confides . That virtually ended the usual intimidation of voters , and as a result a coalition came_to power that favors the disadvantaged . Although the job he holds is mandated by the constitution , chief election commissioners before Seshan were little more_than glorified errand_boys for the government , which manipulated the electoral process to further its grip on power . Seshan refuses to do what people working for Prime_Minister P . V . Narasimha Rao order . &quot; If I am a subordinate of government , God save this country ' s elections , &quot; he says . Subordinate is a word few would apply to Seshan , although he is a 36-year veteran of India ' s prestigious civil_service -- the same bunch he now claims is &quot; 98 % corrupt &quot; and likens to prostitutes . He held a succession of plum government jobs and even served nine months as Cabinet secretary , or India ' s No . 1 bureaucrat . Critics carp that if Seshan had complaints about public administration , he certainly kept quiet for a self-servingly long_time . Bhuvnesh Chaturvedi , a member_of_Parliament for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party , says Seshan ' s headline-grabbing comments are those of an &quot; abnormal man. &quot; For almost a year , Seshan and India ' s government have been waging a dispute so acrimonious that the commissioner is boycotting all official functions . In a nutshell , the government rejects Seshan ' s contention that he has the constitutional authority to order its staff to run and keep order at elections and that he can punish bureaucrats who won ' t comply . &quot; That is something I was not willing to stomach , &quot; Seshan says . He struck back last August by postponing all elections . The Supreme Court then gave him the interim powers he sought . Taking a leaf from Franklin D . Roosevelt ' s notebook , Rao ' s government moved to dilute Seshan ' s authority by appointing two additional commissioners . But Seshan , who as commission chief enjoys special status conferred by the constitution , is uncowed . &quot; The only way you can send me home is by going_through the process of impeachment , &quot; he says . He now is going_after 20 members of the Rajya Sabha , the upper house of Parliament , for allegedly falsifying their places of residence so they could get elected from states they don ' t live_in . If those allegations are true , Seshan wants charges brought . It ' s hardly_a move that will earn him brownie points with India ' s already alienated government -- one of the probe targets is Finance_Minister Manmohan Singh . * Seshan wants photo identity_cards for voters introduced by Jan . 1 of next year -- a laudable undertaking to cleanse often suspect voter rolls of the dead and departed , but dauntingly ambitious given the size of the electorate and the fact that millions of Indians have no fixed address and sleep on the streets . Rarely out of the headlines , Seshan in the past few weeks has ordered political_parties to remove the posters and graffiti from the last election and has banned the licensing of new firearms during campaigns . Bare-chested and armed with a constable ' s iron-tipped lathi , or stave , he robustly kept order at the January funeral of a Hindu holy_man , barking orders at policemen and using his beefy torso to block entry to the press . A scandal threatened to engulf the &quot; Mr. Clean &quot; of Indian politics when it became known that Seshan flew to the funeral aboard a jet he requisitioned from a leading industrialist . But Seshan said he had paid_for the flight , and produced the photocopy of a $ 3 # 000 personal_check he wrote . Most significantly , in a 12-page order , Seshan has directed district election officers throughout the country to scrutinize candidates ' campaign spending . For a typical parliamentary seat , spending is supposed to be limited to 200 # 000 rupees , or about $ 6 # 500 . In real_life , he says , candidates shell_out up_to 80 million rupees , or almost $ 2.6 million . &quot; I can ' t get_rid_of them by saying they ' ve spent more money , &quot; Seshan admits . &quot; But I intend to expose them. &quot; It is the source of that bankroll -- official corruption -- that really preoccupies Seshan and gets him worrying about the future of Indian democracy . Corruption , he says , is endemic because almost every big purchase or decision involves politicians or government officials who can skim money off contracts or demand kickbacks . &quot; You can buy a condom from X instead of Y in the United States , &quot; Seshan says with his usual flair for the outrageous . &quot; If you want a condom in India , you have to largely buy from the public sector. &quot; What has evolved in his country , Seshan explains , is a three-sided , incestuous process . First , elections serve as the source of power . Through corruption , an officeholder can then accumulate &quot; black money. &quot; He can then use his stash to finance reelection . And so on , ad infinitum . &quot; We don ' t seem to have a way to break this triangle , &quot; Seshan complains . But he ' s striking where the triangular process begins -- elections -- to enforce spending limits and try to minimize incumbents ' use of the perks of office while campaigning . The governor of Himachal Pradesh learned the hard way that Seshan was serious . He borrowed an official car to campaign for his son , Seshan says . The commissioner roundly condemned the father and announced he was delaying local elections for three months . Two days later , the governor was replaced . Ironically , India ' s chief election commissioner does not vote himself -- he believes it would harm his impartiality . Once , he says , when he worked for India ' s Oil and Natural_Gas Commission , he did try . &quot; The man read through the list and said , ' Yes , name correct , yes , address correct , yes , age correct , ' &quot; Seshan recalled . &quot; And then he said , ' But this list says you ' re a female.
