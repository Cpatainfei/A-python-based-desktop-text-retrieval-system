   <HEADLINE> ON CALIFORNIA : GAS_PUMPS IN THE REARVIEW ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here is how I remember it . We were driving on California 152 , over by Los Banos . This was about 30 years ago , and the family car was a big Mercury Monterey sedan . The distinguishing feature of this model was its back window , which slanted down and in at a sharp angle . The design ' s intent , I suppose , was to give the car a futuristic look , like something the Jetsons might drive . Anyway , on this summer day we happened to pass a strange little box of a car -- a Honda , I now believe . This was the first Japanese import we ' d ever seen , and the image of the tiny machine bucking an afternoon breeze , its passengers squeezed inside , shoulder to shoulder , head to roof , seemed absolutely ludicrous . We all giggled , and I seem to remember my mother saying something as we boomed past . What I seem to remember her saying was this : &quot; Toot , toot. &quot; * Well , how could we know any better ? How could we know that the next wave in automobiles would be , not big Mercs with slant-back windows , but little Japanese imports ? The future can be difficult to see , especially when it ' s in your rearview_mirror . I face a similar quandary today , trying to imagine a time when electric_cars dominate the roadways . Advocates insist this not only is inevitable , but could be only a decade or so away . Still , the idea of recharging some clean , quiet electro-wagon each night in the clutter of my garage seems faraway , fantastic . In this failure of imagination I suspect I am not alone . And in this failure of imagination Detroit auto_makers and their allies in internal_combustion find opportunity . As evidence , I offer a well-attended hearing Monday at the Capitol . An Assembly committee was taking testimony on regulations that will mandate 2 % of all new cars sold in California by 1998 emit zero pollutants . Under these mandates , drafted to help California comply with federal clean air requirements , 10 % of the vehicles sold by 2003 must be so-called Zero Emission Vehicles , or ZEVS . Present technology pretty much dictates that the ZEVS will be electric_cars . U.S. auto_makers have been lobbying quietly against the coming mandates . The hearing forced them and their allies -- mainly , representatives of the oil_industry -- to go public . In testimony , at news_conferences and in encounters in the Capitol halls , they attacked the mandates from many angles -- bad science , bad public policy , bad economics , unfair , unfeasible , unnecessary , un-American . They invoked Adam Smith and the Edsel . They warned of taxpayer boondoggles , excessive regulation , higher electric_bills and even job flight . The overarching intent seemed to be to plant one seed : The risk of enforcing the mandate schedule outweighs any benefit that will come from forcing along electric_cars . Though they pay homage to the quest_for &quot; exciting new technology , &quot; when it comes_to electric_cars , these people clearly are skeptics . The technology isn ' t there , they say , and neither is the market . Trust your instincts , they imply , it ' s not going_to happen . After testimony from one electric_car enthusiast , a representative of the Western States Petroleum Assn . gave me a grin and a knowing look and said : &quot; Pretty wild stuff. &quot; He might have just said : Toot , toot . * Electric_car advocates -- and the most significant development Monday was the Wilson Administration ' s reassertion of support for ZEV mandates -- compare the auto_makers ' stance to those initially taken against air_bags . Detroit , they say , simply wants to do business its way , on its timetable . And here is where the electric_car people sense an opportunity of_their_own . &quot; Not all these cars have to be built_in Detroit , &quot; said Michael Gage , the former politico who now serves as president of Calstart , a quasi-public consortium attempting to foster transportation innovations . If Detroit doesn ' t want to build them , he said , others surely will -- in Germany , or Japan , or maybe in Burbank , where his group is headquartered in a retired aircraft plant . A principal benefit of the mandates , he and others testified , will be to jump-start technology and create an entire new industry -- and jobs . During his testimony , Gage presented slides of electric_car prototypes under development around the world . The models ranged from Mercedes trucks to tiny , square Japanese contraptions that reminded me of that early Honda : Cars , quipped one Assembly member , &quot; that fit_in your pocket. &quot; The most important slide Gage brought , however , was a shot of the Los Angeles skyline choked with smog . &quot; This is what it ' s all about , &quot; he said . And he was right . The future might be tough to see , but the present is obvious . Just look_out the window , and ask what is the greater risk : Trying something that might not work , or not trying at all ?</TEXT>
