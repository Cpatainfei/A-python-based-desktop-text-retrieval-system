   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; REMODELED AND MODERN ' DOLL ' S HOUSE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Don ' t bother looking_for elegance or comfort in the stuffy , dark , onetime church and funeral_parlor of St . Cecilia ' s in downtown San Diego . But check_out the talent on the rise . Like young couples with big dreams starting_out in small , spare accommodations , young theater_companies and their young , ambitious talent are drawn to such places . Undergraund ! Inc. is one such company , and its production of Henrik Ibsen ' s &quot; A Doll ' s House &quot; is_well worth catching . The 1879 play about a wife , Nora , who walks_out_of her marriage after realizing she has been more doll than wife to her husband , gets a crisp , modern feel under the charged direction and adaptation of artistic director Ivan Talijancic . The one flaw in this intermission-less show is the ending -- Ibsen ' s dated speech about walking_out , dispassionately rendered by K.B. Merrill in an otherwise fine performance as Nora . &quot; A Doll ' s House &quot; became a rallying cry_for women leaving marriages to find themselves after the women ' s liberation movement . But the conclusion seems sad and naive , in the wake of bitter custody disputes , angry financial battles , escalated batterings and murders . It ' s almost as if the show ended with the sensibility of the wife who walks_out in the beginning of &quot; Kramer vs . Kramer &quot; -- still 100 years ahead of its time -- without incorporating the pain when she loses her child in the end . And while the body of the show alludes to the beatings from the O.J. / Nicole Simpson headlines , the ending doesn ' t address the fact that divorce doesn ' t always put an end to spousal abuse . Until that point , however , the show successfully depicts a marriage of a man who sees his wife as an asset and a wife who mistakenly believes there ' s much more to the relationship . Talijancic ' s fascinating set design tells part of the story , with Nora living_in enclosed white walls like Rapunzel shut_up in a castle . Action in the real_world takes_place outside those walls , on raised platforms , on a trestle . People visit Nora by climbing a ladder over her walls and lowering themselves down to her domain . James Kresser offers_up a pompous , condescending bully as Nora ' s husband , Torvald , while Merrill is lovely , lithe and lively as Nora , the child as bride . Glimmers of character depth break_through as Nora connects , compassionately , to her childhood friend , Kristine ( Laurie Lehmann-Gray ) , who needs a second chance at life , and longtime friend , Dr. Rank ( Tim West ) , who needs a loving hand to die in peace . Lehmann-Gray plays Kristine as a world-weary woman who has been through it all . The one hole in her performance is her inscrutability about why she declines in the end to help her friend as she said she would . Elliott Grey is explosive and threatening as Krogstad , the villain whose revelations about a debt Nora owes him threaten to bring her doll ' s house crumbling down . But more of a turn is needed in his crucial change of heart . West gives a wondrously mature performance as Rank , the man whose passion for Nora is more acted than told in painful , penetrating looks . Chris Kortum ' s lighting and Shannon Michael Terry ' s sound are integral to setting the mood as occasional flashes of lightning and thunder punctuate the scenes . Norah Switzer ' s costumes -- old-fashioned suits for the men , clingy , frilly and black for Norah , a dress with a corseted waist for Kristine -- work well in an odd , eclectic way . There is a brief nude scene at the end for Nora , suggesting that she is casting_off her shackles with her old clothes . But it plays more as if the company were struggling to contemporize the ending . When Talijancic finds more substantive ways of suggesting modern resonance -- perhaps with silent vignettes off the main center of action -- he will have gone beyond a promising production to craft a truly noteworthy revival . * &quot; A Doll ' s House , &quot; St .
