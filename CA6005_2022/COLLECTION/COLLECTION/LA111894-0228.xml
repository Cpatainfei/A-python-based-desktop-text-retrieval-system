   <HEADLINE> TERRORISM ; RECENT ATTACKS RAISE FEARS OF PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE IN PERU</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A recent bombing rampage by the ragtag remains of a brutal Maoist insurgency is a signal that terrorist violence could increase in the coming months of campaigning for April presidential elections , analysts say . The attacks by the Sendero Luminoso ( Shining Path ) could also shake President Alberto Fujimori ' s plans for reelection , as he has focused his campaign on convincing voters of his successes in combatting the terrorist group . Fujimori has repeatedly vowed to rid the country of terrorism by the end of his term in July . Sendero Luminoso has traditionally disrupted elections , especially in the hinterlands . The group ' s tactics include intimidating voters and assassinating candidates . The group launched its war against the government during the May , 1980 , presidential elections by burning ballot_boxes in the small_town of Chuschi , near the insurgency ' s birthplace of Ayacucho in the southern Andes . Since then , an estimated 30 # 000 Peruvians have died in terrorist violence . In the worst blackout since 1992 , Senderistas in early October blew_up power poles , plunging Lima and much of the coast into darkness . Insurgents last week tossed makeshift bombs at several banks here . The recent bombings also came at_the_same_time that an amnesty period for repentant Maoist guerrillas expired Oct . 31 . According to the army , about 6 # 000 rebels have turned themselves in since the law took_effect in 1992 . &quot; We will be inflexible until achieving total peace , &quot; Fujimori said in a speech to military officials the day after the amnesty law expired . At the same ceremony , Defense Minister Victor Malca Villanueva warned Senderistas still at_large that they now face the &quot; laws of war. &quot; The amnesty was one of a series of counterinsurgency measures decreed by Fujimori after he closed the Congress and seized broad powers in a military-backed &quot; self coup &quot; in April , 1992 . The law grants those who turn themselves in more lenient sentences and , in some cases , exemption from conviction . Although the law has been called an effective anti-guerrilla strategy , critics say that many of those who turned themselves in are peasants who were forced to collaborate by Sendero Luminoso . And some repentant insurgents -- in a bid for more lenient sentences -- often provided authorities with false information that led to the arrests of innocent Peruvians . Meanwhile , as Peru ' s inefficient judiciary begins processing their paperwork , the innocent and guilty alike languish in Peruvian prisons . Sendero Luminoso has been severely crippled by the September , 1992 , capture of its leader and founder , Abimael Guzman . Today , Sendero Luminoso watchers say , the group is headed by Oscar Ramirez , formerly No . 3 in the movement ' s leadership . Guzman and several other leaders are serving life sentences in a Lima prison . Ramirez , known by his nom_de_guerre , Feliciano , heads Sendero Luminoso ' s splinter faction Sendero Rojo ( Red Path ) , blamed for the recent bombings . With Guzman behind bars , Ramirez assumed control of Sendero Luminoso after he and hard-line members rejected Guzman ' s peace overtures to the government . Earlier this year , the army announced it was_on the verge of capturing Ramirez . But antipersonnel mines thwarted an army offensive , and Ramirez escaped . Across Peru , attacks have dropped from around 4 # 000 in the 25 months before Guzman ' s capture to about 2 # 000 in the 26 months since . Despite the recent resurgence of Sendero Luminoso attacks , few believe that the rebel group or a similar insurgency could rise again . &quot; People have been vaccinated against Sendero Luminoso , &quot; said Enrique Obando , an analyst at Lima ' s Peruvian Center for International Studies . Beginning in the late 1980s , killings in Lima shantytowns of grass-roots leaders who refused to toe the Sendero Luminoso line and a spate of car_bomb attacks in the capital alienated those the rebels tried to recruit .</TEXT>
