   <HEADLINE> MARKET FOCUS ; TAINTED PAPRIKA POISONS HUNGARY ' S CULINARY PRIDE ; FIFTY-NINE PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED IN THE SCANDAL , WHICH SENT 46 TO THE HOSPITAL . THE HEALTH OF THE INDUSTRY IS ALSO AT STAKE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Greed was the motive . Housewives were the unwitting perpetrators . So far , nearly four dozen diners have become victims , stricken ill by paprika laced with lead-based paint . The consequences of Europe ' s latest food-tampering scandal are likely to afflict not just the body but the soul of Hungary , as a nation proud_of its culinary culture finds its food under suspicion , and cooks from Sopron to Szeged ponder how they will manage without their signature Hungarian spice . Since 46 people were poisoned by tainted paprika last month , police have rounded up 60 suspects . Sacks and tins of paprika have been swept from every store shelf , and the government has banned all domestic sales of the spice . Yet panic has mounted . &quot; A Hungarian woman simply can ' t cook without paprika , &quot; insisted Anna Horvath , a pensioner who traveled 40 miles by train from an outlying village to get her cache of the capsicum-based , pungent red powder tested for traces of the poisonous paint . * Paprika is the defining ingredient of Hungarian cuisine . It provides the distinctive flavor of the most popular dishes , from its namesake chicken_paprika to every pot of goulash to the tangy tomato-pepper compote called lesco . Paprika gives Hungarian sausage its rusty color , and a sprinkling of the stuff adds flair to dishes finished_off with a dollop of sour_cream . It shares the pride of placement beside salt on most tables , edging out black_pepper as the popular choice for a final flavor spike . Paprika seeped into Hungarian cooking only about 200 years ago , but each of this country ' s 10.5 million citizens now consumes , on average , more_than a pound of it each year . Now a tiny part of the national total has been laced with a red paint compound , apparently to improve a sad-looking lot , and the country is up in arms . Worse than the culinary chaos disrupting millions of Hungarian households , for example , is the disastrous taint the incident has inflicted on Hungary ' s reputation as a safe place for travelers and a fun place to eat . Restaurants across Budapest report that some diners , especially foreign tourists , are specifically requesting that paprika be left_out of the dishes they order . The Matthias Cellar , one of the capital ' s most popular eateries , has temporarily taken goulash off the menu . &quot; Paprika symbolizes Hungary , &quot; explained a devastated Kalman Kalla , the master chef at Hungary ' s famed Gundel ' s restaurant . &quot; It will take a long_time to get_over this. &quot; Like a canary in a mine shaft , guarding against a lethal whiff , Kalla personally tastes a sample from each new sack of paprika , he said . &quot; We have presidents and prime_ministers and the world ' s great artists coming_to dine here . I have to know what I ' m feeding them is safe , otherwise I couldn ' t sleep at night , &quot; said the master chef . Hungary produces about 8 # 000 tons of paprika each year , about 6 % of the world market , which is evenly divided between domestic consumption and foreign export . Government investigators are not sure how much paprika was tainted with the toxic paint compound , but they have seized nearly two tons of the doctored substance in the Kalocsa &quot; Paprika Belt &quot; along the Danube_River , about 60 miles south of Budapest . The rest of the tainted paprika had been distributed to private traders who sold it to market vendors . &quot; The police say they doubt those who did this knew how harmful the substance can be , &quot; Emi Koncse of the Ministry for Trade and Industry said of the paint compound . Investigators believe that the perpetrators tried to save time and money by artificially drying ripe peppers instead of allowing them to naturally desiccate , which can take_up to a year . Peppers dried too quickly produce a less brilliant red color when ground into spice , food experts say , which likely prompted the tamperers to add the paint agent to improve the looks of their product . * The first cases of paprika-induced lead_poisoning occurred in late August , but the source was not traced to the tainted spice until nearly a month later , by which time 46 people were hospitalized . Prime_Minister Gyula Horn appointed his chief deputy , Gabor Kuncze , to oversee the investigation . The government was confident that the two main paprika mills in Kalocsa and Szeged practiced quality_controls adequate_to ensure none of their product had been tainted . Hungary ' s paprika supply used to be produced exclusively by the two state-owned plants , but at least 70 small private mills have cropped_up over the last five years under Hungary ' s post-Communist drive for entrepreneurship . The 59 people arrested so far are all associated with a handful of those fledgling private mills . Free testing of domestic stocks of paprika has been offered to consumers , but as the number of samples showing traces of toxic lead residue increased , panic ensued . By early October , Budapest ' s Quality Protection Institute was being inundated with 5 # 000 requests a day for sample testing . &quot; About 12.5 % of the samples we ' ve tested have been tainted , but 99.5 % of them are of the same origin , &quot; said Eva Simon , the testing department chief , alluding to the stocks police have traced to the tampering ring in Kalocsa . Nevertheless , growing hysteria over the tainting incident prompted the government to intensify its actions . All domestic sales of paprika have been banned , and stores were ordered to take remaining quantities of the spice off shelves . &quot; There won ' t be any paprika for_sale in Hungary for a_couple_of weeks , until we are satisfied that all_of the poisoned substance has been destroyed and there ' s no possibility of any more being sold , &quot; Koncse said . Hungary has not yet taken any steps that would affect its exports , and officials such_as Koncse insist that there is no way any of the tainted paprika could have gotten_into what she described as a closely regulated food export market . * But such assurances may_not allay wary consumers , especially foreign tourists spooked by the tainting scandal . &quot; We have already experienced groups coming here and saying they don ' t want anything with paprika in it , &quot; said Kalla , the chef at Gundel ' s . &quot; I know my food is good . But people are being frightened by the stories . This will have very bad consequences for the whole country. &quot;</TEXT>
