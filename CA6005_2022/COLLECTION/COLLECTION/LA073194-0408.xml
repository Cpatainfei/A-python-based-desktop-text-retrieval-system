   <HEADLINE> COLOR THEM RED : PLANTS THAT BLAZE YEAR-ROUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like a bullfighter ' s red cape , the color red in the landscape shouts for attention . Blazing fall colors or fiery summer flowers may be the first garden reds that come_to_mind . But there are other plants that have red leaves all year-round--or at least most of the year , if they ' re deciduous . Lumped together in a group that includes red , purple , bronze and copper foliage , these plants make a statement . They draw the eye toward them , breaking_up the sameness of an all-green garden . Red foliage plants come_in all shapes and sizes , ranging from ground-hugging carpet bugle to copper_beech , which can overshadow a two-story house . They generally look best with medium-green to dark-green neighbors , although in just the right spot they contrast dramatically with silver or gray foliage plants . For most of these plants , choose a spot in full sun . Too_much shade often fades the leaf color . * Starting with trees , the dainty Japanese_maple ( Acer_palmatum ) changes color with the seasons : scarlet in spring , green in summer , then yellow , orange or scarlet again in fall . An exception to the full-sun rule , Japanese_maple is happy in partial shade . A single tree at a lawn ' s edge or beneath an oak is a beautiful accent . A clustering of three or a grove of more calls_for a round of applause . * Flowering plums are also spectacular in grove plantings . Their dainty flowers are a spring bonus . Prunus blireiana ' s new leaves emerge purplish_red , then change to greenish bronze by fall . Purple-leaf plum ( Prunus_cerasifera ' Atropurpurea ' ) produces a bumper crop of red plums . Dwarf red-leaf plum ( Prunus cistena ) bears dark purple fruit and is easy to grow in a large tub . * Copper_beech ( Fagus_sylvatica ' Atropunicea ' ) , with dark_red or purple foliage , and weeping copper_beech ( F.s. ' Purpurea Pendula ' ) are excellent container plants too . In the ground , they may eventually reach 60 feet . * Smoke_tree ( Cotinus_coggygria ' Purpureus ' or ' Royal_Purple ' ) is another foliage chameleon , with new , Concord-grape purple leaves turning_to rose red in fall . A deciduous large bush or small tree , smoke_tree stands_up to wind , flourishes in poor or rocky soil and usually requires no watering after its second year . * Also look_for the purple hopseed bush ( Dodonea viscosa ' Purpurea ' ) , which keeps its willow-like leaves year-round , or purple filbert ( Corylus maxima ' Purpurea ' ) . * On the shorter side of the garden fence are two ornamental grasses that go dormant in winter . Japanese blood grass ( Imperata cylindrica ' Rubra ' or ' Red Baron ' ) is aptly named , with blood-red blades spreading in knee-high clumps . It likes regular water and thrives next to lawns . Red fountain_grass ( Pennisetum_setaceum ' Rubrum ' or ' Cupreum ' ) is less strident . Fluffy plumes in shades of red , copper or purple form in late summer atop thick , waist-high clumps of slender stalks . It is drought tolerant and grows in just about any garden soil . * The shrub heavenly bamboo ( Nandina domestica ) offers a celestial parade of colors . Feathery new leaves unfurl a pinkish or coppery red , then slowly change to medium-green . By summer , bronze , purple or red creeps from the edges toward the centers . In winter most of the leaves are brilliant scarlet , with long-lasting , shiny red berries dangling from the branches . * More delicate are glossy abelia ( belia grandiflora ) and Begonia richmondensis . Both have bronzy foliage contrasting with white or pink flowers . They are generally evergreen , tolerate full sun near the coast or filtered shade inland and require frost protection and regular watering . In water-conserving gardens , shrubby succulents offer many shades of red . Aeonium arboreum ' Atropurpureum ' sends_out burgundy rosettes about the size of an outstretched hand . Crassula corymbulosa is smaller , with dark_red rosettes . Stonecrop ( Sedum ) prospers in sun or shade and includes two tough ground_covers : Sedum spathulifolium ' Purpureum , ' with dark purple leaves , and Sedum spurium , with thick , evergreen , bronzy leaves and red flowers during most of summer . * Carpet bugle ( Ajuga_reptans ) grows fast into a dense mat of bronze or purple leaves . Spires of blue flowers cap the foliage from spring to summer . Half a dozen named varieties bear slightly different leaf_shapes and colors . Out of the ground , pots are comfortable summer homes for a_few red-leafed plants that should be indoors now . * Fancy-leafed caladium ( Caladium_bicolor ) , native to the tropics , provides color as loud as a squawking parrot on big , multicolored leaves . Kalanchoe laciniata has thick , succulent , red or bronze leaves . Finger-nail size flowers in red , orange or yellow appear in late winter and spring . However , hybridizers have had a field_day with kalanchoe and it ' s often available in bloom year-round at garden centers , drugstores or supermarkets .
