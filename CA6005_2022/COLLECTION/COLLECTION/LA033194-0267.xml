   <HEADLINE> LOCAL BUSINESSES FIND NO SOLACE IN NEW FEDERAL AIR QUALITY PLAN ; REGULATIONS : SOME PREDICT THAT MEETING THE STRICTER SMOG STANDARDS WILL RUIN THE VENTURA COUNTY ECONOMY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal and local air-quality officials offered little hope Wednesday for area business people who claimed the Ventura County economy could be ruined if a new federal plan to clean_up the air is imposed . To meet standards set by the federal Clean Air Act , Ventura County must reduce its smog-causing emissions by 40 % by 2005 , officials told area residents and business representatives gathered at the Ventura County Fairgrounds for a workshop on the plan . Measures proposed in a 1 # 600-page federal implementation plan for Ventura , Los Angeles and Sacramento counties aim to reduce emissions from trucks , tractors , ships , trains , pesticides and other more traditional sources of pollution , such_as cars and businesses . &quot; The ( federal ) plan is going_to have some significant economic impacts , &quot; said William Mount , deputy manager of the Ventura County Air_Pollution Control District . &quot; The trick is to come_up with ( local ) alternatives to these measures . But we simply don ' t have enough tools to reduce emissions to meet the standards , and especially not by 2005. &quot; The EPA was required to step_in to solve air-quality problems in Ventura , Los Angeles and Sacramento counties after local air-pollution districts were unable to devise enough regulations to reduce pollution to meet standards . In Ventura County , the local district has implemented strict controls on emissions from businesses within its jurisdiction . But cars , trucks , trains , ships and farm equipment and pesticides have been outside their legal limits . The federal plan was required after Ventura County was designated as having a &quot; severe &quot; air-quality problem in the 1990 Clean Air Act . Among other measures , it calls_for a 70 % reduction in nitrogen-oxide emissions from heavy trucks , such_as those used to haul produce . The plan also would impose fines on ships using ports in Ventura and Los Angeles counties . Al Zemsky , a spokesman for the Environmental Production Agency , said federal regulators came_to Ventura to explain the proposed new regulations and to get feedback . &quot; We need to hear from the public , &quot; he said . But he acknowledged that there is little room for the regulators to give on the proposed regulations if the standards are to be met . &quot; It will be tough , &quot; he said . Carolyn Leavens said her family farming business depends_on heavy trucks to transport citrus from the farm to the warehouse , from the warehouse to the packer and from the packer to market or port . &quot; You would shut agriculture down in a wink if it goes_through as proposed , &quot; she said . She said the farming industry can handle new regulations to reduce emissions from pesticides , from engines that operate pumps to bring irrigation water to the surface and from heavy farm equipment . But the restrictions on trucking will kill the industry , she said . New regulations on ship emissions would also hurt the Port of Hueneme , said port spokesman W . Kam Quarles . &quot; If the fines go_through , it would make the ports in this region less competitive than other parts of the West Coast , &quot; he said . &quot; Fines like that can push shippers away. &quot; But Stan Greene , president of the Citizens to Preserve the Ojai , said it hasn ' t been determined what the effects on business would be . On the other hand , he said there would be severe impacts if air_pollution is not reduced . &quot; It is not just people ' s health and suffering , &quot; he said . &quot; There are also economic costs to air pollution. &quot; He cited a reduction in crops , deterioration of architectural coatings and increased need for health_care to treat lung ailments . A public hearing on the plan , when comments from residents become part of the public records , will be held_in July , Zemsky said .</TEXT>
