   <TEXT> One of the original Mercury Seven astronauts , the former Navy test_pilot became the first man into space on May 5 , 1961 . In December , 1963 , he was grounded because of an inner-ear disorder and became chief of the astronaut office . In May , 1969 , his disorder was surgically treated and he was returned to flight status . In July , 1971 , he returned to space on Apollo 14 . Shepard , now 70 , became the first man to play golf on the lunar surface . Were you scared on your first flight into space ? I don ' t think scared is the right word . Nervous . Obviously , you practiced for all kinds of things to go_wrong . You have trained to respond to emergency situations . Still , you are a bit nervous when you are sitting on top of the rocket . . . . I ( was ) nervous that I might make a mistake , same thing as a youngster taking an exam . He ' s a little bit nervous , but as soon as the kid starts to answer the first question of the exam , he stops being nervous . As the rocket fires , you stop being nervous and pay_attention to the rocket . You don ' t worry about nervousness . Why did you hit golf_balls on the moon_on the Apollo 14 flight ? It was not spontaneous . Several months before the flight , I thought_about it . On the moon , golf_balls are going_to go six times as far and it ' s not going_to slice or hook because there ' s no atmosphere . So I started to practice . We had a collapsible handle which had a scoop on the end of it to scoop_up dust samples . The handle would be left up there , so I took the end of a No . 6 iron because that was about the length of the handle . I had it so it would snap on the end in place of the scoop . I took some pictures and then told the boss what I wanted to do . First , he said &quot; No. &quot; And then I said , &quot; Wait a minute , boss. &quot; I showed him the pictures . I said I paid_for the club_head and paid_for the golf_balls , so no expense to the taxpayers . I said , &quot; Suppose I wait to the very end of the lunar mission , just before we were supposed to leave . If anything has gone_wrong or we have equipment_failures or had screwed_up , anything like that , I won ' t hit the golf_balls . But if everything has gone completely right , then the last thing I ' ll do before I go is whack these two golf_balls . I won ' t even get them . I will leave them up there. &quot; And he said , &quot; that ' s a deal. &quot; How do you regard the state of NASA today ? We would like to see a full level of funding that would keep the space_station on schedule . I think we all understand that most of the people don ' t really know what ' s going_on at NASA . But it ' s a very mature sense of exploration in looking_into various fields of science . All the experiments they are doing_up on the shuttle -- I would say they are going_to help people make their life better . The average citizen doesn ' t know this . that ' s why they ' re having difficulty with the Congress because they don ' t realize that either . They don ' t understand basic research . When we start talking_about the experiments that the space_station will be doing -- looking_back at the planet , looking_at the ozone levels , looking_at pollution , and doing_it on a worldwide basis -- then they are going_to say those NASA guys are doing something for us on this planet after all . Would you go_into space again ? Oh yeah , absolutely . But I would n ' t want to go_through the thousands of hours of training again . I am too old for that ( laughs ) . WALTER ( WALLY ) SCHIRRA Another of the original Mercury Seven astronauts , the former lieutenant_commander and Korean_War veteran made his first foray_into space on Oct . 3 , 1962 , in the Sigma Seven . On the longest American mission to that date -- nine hours -- Schirra performed a series of scientific and engineering experiments . On Dec . 15 , 1965 , Schirra and Tom Stafford took_off in the Gemini 6 , which achieved a historic rendezvous with Gemini 7 , steering within 6 to 8 inches of it . And on Oct . 11 , 1968 , Schirra , Walt Cunningham and Don Eisle lifted_off in the Apollo 7 . Schirra developed a severe head_cold and the crew complained about the workload , including last-minute changes in their flight program . Schirra , 71 , is known as the prankster among the Mercury 7 astronauts . What were your feelings about the movie &quot; The Right Stuff &quot; ? Well , my appellation for that was &quot; Animal House in Space , &quot; which I said often enough that Tom Wolfe ( who wrote the best-selling book ) called me and said , &quot; My first bid for movie rights was from ( John ) Belushi and ( Dan ) Aykroyd , which would have made_it a much better comedy. &quot; I met Lance Henrikson ( who played Schirra in the movie ) at the premiere . That is the only time I have seen it really . He said , &quot; Did I get you wrong ! &quot; I kept saying I had more time in my Actifed commercial than I did_in that movie , and it was a 30-second commercial . How did you feel when you weren ' t given the first manned flight into space ? It was a real thud . All of us feel that you think you are the best , and suddenly you are not the very best . But then the sequence worked_out to where I had a better flight . I kept teasing Shepard after that . What kind of emotions did you feel as you waited to blast_off ? You are setting me up for my favorite line , though all_of us claim it . As you are lying there just before liftoff you think , all_of these hundreds and thousands of parts were put_together by the lowest bidder . It is one of our favorite lines . What was your first flight like ? That was a busy flight . I tried to conserve the altitude-control fuel which had been exhausted on John_Glenn and Scott Carpenter ' s flights . I did so well at it , I think I had 80 % of the fuel left and that permitted Gordon Cooper to go_up for 24 hours . Describe your White_House visit after your Sigma Seven flight ? My wife , son and daughter and I were sitting there in the Oval Office ; it was the Cuban Missile Crisis that very day . ( President ) Kennedy was so cool , and he asked my daughter how old she was and she held_up five fingers . He said , &quot; Do you want to see Macaroni ? &quot; That was Caroline ' s pet horse out_in the Rose_Garden . It was amazing how cool the man was with this crisis going_on around him . That has shown_up in a number of history books . What was the Gemini 7 flight like ? That was my favorite mission ... the first time a rendezvous was ever done and it was done so well . It was done to perfection . Up until then we came_in second to the Soviets . They had the first space_walk . They had the first multiple crew . They had the first man in orbit . The first woman in orbit . So suddenly , about all we could do was compete for duration , which we started doing , and even then we didn ' t win . But they had never done a rendezvous and they didn ' t do that kind of rendezvous for another 10 years . What about your head_cold on Apollo 7 ? That was a bad deal . There were no symptoms prior to the flight , which was kind of interesting . Then it developed within about 24 hours , maybe 48 hours , as a screaming head_cold . We had Actifed ( in the capsule ) , which many years later my daughter , now older , called the 10-day cold capsule . The producer of Actifed said , &quot; Would you do the spokesman role since you used Actifed ? &quot; and I said , &quot; Sure. &quot; I had a lot of fun with it . SUSAN KING</TEXT>
