   <HEADLINE> TAFT HIGH WINS ACADEMIC DECATHLON AGAIN ; EDUCATION : THE WOODLAND HILLS SCHOOL COLLECTS ITS SECOND STRAIGHT STATE TITLE . NATIONAL COMPETITION IS NEXT MONTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the second consecutive year , a team of students from Taft High_School of Woodland Hills claimed the mantle of California ' s best and brightest , winning the state Academic Decathlon . The Taft team , representing the Los Angeles Unified School District , out-tested its Los Angeles County rival , West High_School of Torrance , which finished second . Orange County ' s Laguna Hills High_School was third . Taft ' s win on Sunday earned the San Fernando Valley school its fourth state championship since the contest began 15 years ago . The nine-member team will represent California in the national competition next month . &quot; Today , we shook Stockton , &quot; said Taft senior Daniel Berdichevsky , 17 , who took the gold medal for the highest overall score in the 10-event contest , earning 8 # 937 points_out of a possible 10 # 000 . &quot; I feel exhilarated. &quot; The victory was also a welcome back gift for Taft Coach Arthur Berchin , who had left decathlon training four years ago after leading the 1989 Taft team to the national title . More_than 70 Taft parents , friends and district administrators cheered as team members raked_in 12 gold medals for individual events , 11 silver and seven bronze . The school scored 48 # 974 points of a possible 60 # 000 ; West High ' s tally was 46 # 278 . It was also a boost for the city ' s beleaguered school district , which fared poorly in state test scores released last week . More_than 375 students representing 43 California regions joined in the battle of brains that began Friday at the University of the Pacific . The first day included written tests in math , fine_arts , economics , science , literature and social studies . Students were back Saturday morning with essay writing , prepared and impromptu speeches , as well as interviews with judges . At Sunday ' s awards luncheon , Taft students nervously twittered at the table . Team members Sage Vaughn , 16 , and Sheldon Peregrino , 18 , created sculptures out of their water_glasses and lunch remnants . Rebecca Rissman , 17 , parked her elbows on the table and wrung her hands . &quot; This is torture , &quot; Vaughn said . When it came , the announcement could hardly be heard over the cheers of Taft supporters . &quot; We ' re so proud , &quot; said Jill Shapiro , whose 16-year-old daughter , Kimberly , took two individual event medals for the team . &quot; They ' re all great . We love them all. &quot; West High coach George Floratos said he was proud_of his students even though he was disappointed by the school ' s 0-4 record at the state competition . &quot; One of these times we ' re going to win it , &quot; Floratos said . &quot; But Taft was a super team and a neat bunch of kids. &quot; Also competing for Taft were Chris Huie , 17 , who took_home seven individual medals ; Andrew Salter , 17 , who finished second overall ; Michael Michrowski , 17 , who garnered three medals , and Stephen Shaw , 16 , the team ' s only junior , who won four medals . The victory means only a short break before they begin preparing_for next month ' s national competition in New Jersey . &quot; I think we get a_few days_off before we start studying again , &quot; Kimberly Shapiro said . &quot; We only have a month left. &quot;</TEXT>
