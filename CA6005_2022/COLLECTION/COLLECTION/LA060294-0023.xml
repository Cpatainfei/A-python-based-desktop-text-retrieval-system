   <HEADLINE> CHINESE NOODLES : THROWN , FRIED , EATEN WITH RELISH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I will never forget the flavor of Mr. Chang ' s red-cooked beef noodles . There were hundreds of food stalls in Taipei that specialized in noodles , but none was more famous than Mr. Chang ' s , a tiny place not far from the university where I attended classes in Mandarin Studies . Chang always stood at the back counter , where a huge caldron of beef slowly cooked in a fragrant braising liquid , filling the small shop with the pungent odor of cinnamon , star_anise and soy_sauce . Next to the beef pot sat another large pot filled with boiling water for cooking the noodles . As each order came_in , Chang would deftly grab a handful of fresh noodles and drop them into the boiling water , where they cooked in minutes . Using a bamboo colander , he would quickly strain them into a deep , earthenware bowl and ladle a generous portion of the red-cooked beef with its fragrant sauce on top . The final touch was a handful of leafy_vegetables that cooked instantly in the hot broth . And for the mere price of 75 cents , it was a delicious and filling meal . Noodles , as I was to learn during my three-year sojourn in Asia , are an extraordinarily versatile food and they are not just enjoyed in soups . They are equally relished pan-fried , soft-fried and deep-fried . They are served as a snack , side_dish or as a filling meal by themselves . * In northern China , where wheat rather than rice is the main grain , flour-and-water noodles are a daily staple . In the south , noodles made of flour , egg and water are served primarily as dim sum with other foods , but they also appear on tables as a meal in themselves . In all parts of China , they are eaten for breakfast , lunch or dinner and snacks . Traditionally , in northern China noodles were hand-thrown , and this art is still practiced in some restaurants in China , Hong Kong and the United States . For hand-thrown noodles , a relaxed flour-and-water dough is repeatedly stretched and wrapped in a braid-like shape until the dough magically divides into thousands of fine strands . Hand-thrown noodles are wonderfully delicate and have a silky texture . They may be round , flat or hollow , like macaroni . Flour , egg and water noodles , which are more popular in southern and eastern China , generally are made by machine , and the variety of shapes and sizes is endless . But other ingredients are used to make Chinese noodles too . * There are noodles made of rice powder or flour -- known as mifen , rice vermicelli and rice sticks -- which can be thin or thick . Very thin rice sticks are stir-fried or used as garnishes , in soups or deep-fried to golden nests for stir-fried dishes . Bean threads or cellophane noodles -- fen si -- are made from the starch of mung or green_beans . The translucent noodles are very high in protein . Once cooked , they turn transparent and acquire a smooth , gelatinous texture . Bean threads can be stir-fried , braised or served as beds for salads and cold platters . Like rice noodles , they may also be deep-fried and used as a crisp nest for stir-fried dishes . Noodles are even made of tofu . Bean_curd noodles may be cooked and tossed_in a dressing with other shredded vegetables for a light salad . Many Asian markets in this country carry fresh tofu noodles . * In many dishes , when the Chinese varieties are unavailable , Italian noodles such_as spaghettini , vermicelli , fettuccine and linguine may be substituted . Noodles are also popular in China for their nutritional appeal , in addition to being an inexpensive , high-carbohydrate fuel food . What ' s more , they symbolize longevity , and Chinese custom dictates that they be made long so that diners may attain longevity and their hair will turn as snowy-white as the noodle .
