   <HEADLINE> THE CASE OF THE INTERNET MOLE ; LIVERMORE FINDS ITSELF THE REPOSITORY OF A MOST UNWANTED PHOTO COLLECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than five years ago , a hacker broke_into computers several times at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . Apparently the nuclear_weapons lab is still vulnerable to outlaws riding the information superhighway , although this time the suspicion is that an insider opened the gates to half_a_dozen or so friends . Red-faced officials confirm that lab computers were being used to store and distribute pornographic images -- 2 # 000 steamy megabytes . They did not realize it until a Times reporter alerted them . The disclosure could not have come at a more awkward time for the Livermore , Calif. , lab , which is fighting for its life in the post-Cold War era . Its budget has shrunk since the demise of Ronald Reagan ' s fanciful Star Wars project , on which billions were wasted , and the collapse of the Soviet_Union . Nuclear bomb designers are a glut on the market . Livermore is promoting itself as the ideal site for a proposed $ 1-billion research superlaser known as the National Ignition Facility . We have supported Livermore ' s bid to survive because its staff represents a special national resource . But the smut disclosure hardly helps our case . Officials insist that the breached computer contained only unclassified information and that those used for classified work are protected by an &quot; air gap , &quot; that is , physically separated from non-classified computers and the Internet telephone_lines through which the cyberpunk pirates maraud . Livermore is certainly not their only victim . Last April , a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was arrested on charges of distributing more_than $ 1 million worth of pirated software through the Internet . And authorities have started a manhunt for Kevin Mitnick , a Southern Californian whom some call a veritable one-man keyboard crime_wave , allegedly stealing valuable software from cellular_phone companies , breaking_into Department of Motor_Vehicles records , even harassing the FBI_agents investigating him . Designers of the new Information Age were inspired by noble dreams of free-flowing data as a global liberating force , a true democratizing agent . Sadly , the crooks and creeps have also climbed aboard . The time has come for much tighter computer security . After all , banks learned some time ago that they had to put locks on their vaults .</TEXT>
