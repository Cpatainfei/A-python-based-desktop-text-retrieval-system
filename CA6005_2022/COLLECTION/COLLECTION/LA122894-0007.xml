   <HEADLINE> A BATTLE ENDS , A WAR GOES ON ; TERRORIST TAKEOVER OF AIRLINER WAS BUT ONE FACET OF ALGERIA ' S CIVIL CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> French officials did what was required at Marseilles ' airport on Monday to end the hostage drama that had begun in Algiers two days earlier . Thanks to the skill with which police commandos carried_out their rescue mission , many innocent lives were spared . The four Algerian Muslim militants who seized the Air France airliner on Christmas_Eve and soon afterward murdered three of its passengers were themselves killed by the commandos . While others aboard the airliner and some of their rescuers were injured , none died . Explosives found aboard the plane and comments by the terrorists indicated a plan to blow it up in flight , possibly above Paris , in a suicide-mass murder spectacle presumably intended to dramatize their cause . The failure of this particular act of terrorism will not , of course , deter Algeria ' s Muslim extremists from continuing their war against a regime that seized power almost three years ago . Indeed , within hours after the Marseilles rescue , four Catholic priests -- three of them French , one a Belgian -- were murdered in northern Algeria . Their &quot; offense &quot; was they were foreigners , a group specifically targeted by the militants . More_than a year ago one of the radical organizations , the Islamic Armed Group , ordered all foreigners out of the country on pain of death . Thousands left . Of those who remained , 76 have been murdered . Algeria ' s civil_war , as was the war for independence against France that began 40 years ago , is a merciless struggle , one that has already claimed up_to 20 # 000 lives . The independence that Algeria finally won from a demoralized France in 1962 brought it a succession of largely inefficient , corrupt and authoritarian governments . Three years ago almost to the day -- the timing of the Christmas_Eve hijacking was no coincidence -- the Islamic Salvation Front won the first round in the country ' s first free parliamentary elections . The scheduled second round of voting was promptly canceled and a state of emergency was soon proclaimed . A civil_war has been fought ferociously ever since . It is not a war in which sides can easily be chosen . Algeria ' s rulers hold power against the democratically expressed will of Algeria ' s voters . But the Muslim militants , whose goal is to impose a strict Islamic regime , are no friends of democracy or exponents of tolerance . Besides killing foreigners because they supposedly represent corrupting outside influences , they also attack Algeria ' s intellectuals and secular members of its middle_class . Should they win , hundreds of thousands of Algerians will be forced to seek refuge abroad . Should they win , their militancy almost certainly will be exported to neighboring states . The Air France hijacking was but a skirmish in a vicious war , one whose end is tragically nowhere in_sight .</TEXT>
