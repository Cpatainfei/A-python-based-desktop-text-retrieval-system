   <HEADLINE> HIROHITO ' S BROTHER ASSAILED JAPAN ' S WW II ' AGGRESSION ' ; ASIA : LATE EMPEROR ' S SIBLING CONFIRMS A BOLD 1944 SPEECH TO TROOPS CONDEMNING MILITARY POLICY , ATROCITIES IN CHINA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a 1944 speech in Nanking , China , Prince Mikasa -- the late Emperor Hirohito ' s youngest brother -- condemned the Japanese military ' s &quot; policy of aggression &quot; toward the Chinese and cruelties such_as using prisoners for bayonet practice , a Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday . In a remarkable interview with the Yomiuri Shimbun , the prince , now 78 , detailed the extent of military atrocities against the Chinese and confirmed that he had condemned the aggression in a speech delivered to some Japanese soldiers in China during World_War_II . Copies of his statements were later quashed and destroyed by military authorities . A single remaining copy was recently discovered in the library of Parliament by a Kobe University professor . The prince told the Yomiuri that he wrote and delivered his speech &quot; out of a desperate desire to bring the war to a close &quot; after a one-year assignment as staff_officer with Japanese expeditionary forces in the eastern Chinese city of Nanking ( now known as Nanjing ) . In an assignment that shocked and revolted him , he said he discovered that military_officers used Chinese prisoners_of_war for bayonet practice to instill &quot; guts &quot; in Japanese soldiers ; they gassed and shot them en masse after tying them to posts . &quot; It was truly a horrible scene that can only be termed a massacre , &quot; he said . He also disclosed in his newspaper interview that military officials tried to poison members of the League of Nations ' Lytton Commission , assigned to investigate Japan ' s seizure of Manchuria in 1931 , by lacing fruit with cholera germs ; the investigators did not develop the disease . The prince , then 27 years old , said he denounced the military near the end of the war for acting against what he believed was the emperor ' s strong desire for peace . But military authorities regarded his remarks as &quot; dangerous &quot; and destroyed copies . Since criticism of the military then was regarded_as treason , such outspoken denunciations would have been impossible for anyone but a member of the imperial family , he said . The Mikasa speech is the first open criticism of the military by an imperial family member and &quot; is of tremendous historical significance as evidence of the imperial family ' s basic opposition to the military even in the midst of war , &quot; Yomiuri reported . The military has long sought to legitimize its wartime behavior as done_in the name of the emperor . The remarks are certain to trigger controversy in a nation that remains divided on the nature of its war deeds and responsibility almost half a century after its defeat in World_War_II . During their recent travels across the United States , Emperor Akihito and his wife sought to sidestep the issue ; the current emperor has expressed &quot; deep sorrow &quot; for the &quot; severe suffering &quot; that the Japanese inflicted upon the Chinese during the war . Just two months ago , new Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano told a national newspaper that the &quot; Rape of Nanking , &quot; in which the Japanese military raped , robbed and murdered hundreds of thousands of Chinese in 1937 , was &quot; a fabrication. &quot; Then-Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata , who emphasized that his government was continuing its predecessor ' s view about Japan ' s wartime wrongdoing , reprimanded and dismissed Nagano for his remarks , which he retracted . Conservative Education Ministry officials have long ordered textbook publishers to whitewash such controversial incidents as Japan ' s germ_warfare experiments in Manchuria and the &quot; Rape of Nanking. &quot; Even today , those who challenge the right-wing version of history are often threatened or harmed . After Morihiro Hosokawa denounced the war as a &quot; mistaken war . . . a war of aggression &quot; while prime_minister of the newly formed coalition government last year , a rightist tried to assassinate him in May . And when the mayor of Nagasaki suggested after Emperor Hirohito ' s death in 1989 that the late emperor bore some guilt for World_War_II , a right-wing fanatic shot and nearly killed him . But even as right-wing scholars and sympathizers continue trying to justify Japan ' s wartime acts_as attempts to escape Western colonization and unite Asia in economic prosperity , the prince sharply attacked that assertion in 1944 . Referring to Japan ' s 1940 creation of a puppet government in Nanking , the former Chinese capital , the prince wrote : &quot; It cannot be said that Japan created that government out of a true wish to benefit China or to help the Chinese people form a unified state . Instead , it should be viewed_as a kind of makeshift trick prompted by a desire to cover_up Japan ' s policy of aggression. &quot; He also said the debate over the Nanking massacre missed the point by focusing_on the number of victims ( the Chinese say that about 300 # 000 people were killed ; Japanese scholars who acknowledge the massacre occurred say the number of victims was far smaller ) . &quot; If you kill prisoners in an atrocious manner , that is a massacre , &quot; he said , adding that there was no doubt Japanese soldiers committed such barbarous acts . The prince , however , said he never specifically told his brother , Hirohito , about his report . Instead , he shared his China experience with him in &quot; bits and pieces. &quot;</TEXT>
