   <HEADLINE> SUNDANCE FEST RETAINS ITS COUNTERCULTURE ESSENCE ; MOVIES : DESPITE THE INEVITABLE HOLLYWOOD OVERLAY , A YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM FOR FILM STILL CHARACTERIZES THE ANNUAL EVENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Yes , the Sundance Film Festival is more crowded than it ' s ever been . Yes , the Barking Frog , the town ' s restaurant of choice , was fully booked before a single film was shown and agents with cigars can be seen walking down Main_Street and talking on cellular_phones at the backs of theaters . But somehow the essence of this event still gets_through . Witness Megwynn White . &quot; It ' s really , really cool here -- I don ' t know how else to say it , &quot; says White , one of a group of 24 exuberant students from a filmmaking program at Pacoima Junior_High who have come en masse as the festival ' s partial guests to experience its wonders . &quot; We ' ve been at other festivals , but since we ' re kids , we don ' t always get a really good response . But here we can go_up to directors , say , ' Hi , we ' re students , ' and actually talk to them. &quot; This is the second year a group from Pacoima has come_to the festival , and though Sundance supplies them with free tickets , the students spend the entire year , in vintage Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney fashion , raising money to pay their expenses . &quot; We sold hundreds of boxes of chocolates , blow pops , gummy bears , gummy worms , everything there is that ' s gummy , &quot; says Josh Gray-Emmer , who has moved_on to Van Nuys High_School . &quot; If you counted each of the M &amp; Ms we sold , it was in the millions . And we all had to keep a B average to be able to attend. &quot; * Is it worth it ? &quot; It ' s incredible , &quot; says Gray-Emmer , 15 , whose ambition is to be the youngest producer in the motion_picture academy . &quot; A lot of students don ' t go_to anything but what ' s in the big theaters , and that ' s so limited . You ' d be amazed at how different our films were_after last year ' s festival . This gives us a chance to see what else is out there . We didn ' t even know films like this could exist. &quot; And , despite the inevitable Hollywood overlay , it is this kind of youthful enthusiasm for film and its ability to say something meaningful , to form an emotional connection with its audience , that still characterizes the Sundance festival . With posters taped to walls and a hand-lettered message near a hectic box_office reading , &quot; Avert misunderstanding by calm , poise , balance , &quot; the festival maintains a shaggy , counterculture feeling . Where else would &quot; Darkness in Tallinn , &quot; an out-of-competition thriller shot in the Baltics , try to get everyone ' s attention with mimeographed flyers reading , &quot; Everybody must get Estoned. &quot; Curiously paralleling their audience , many of the films in competition this year are earnest and sincere , more notable for the decency of their intentions than the dazzling nature of their execution . Judging by the first few days , dysfunctional families are a popular theme , with &quot; Spanking the Monkey &quot; confronting incest and &quot; Fun &quot; examining a thrill killing by teen-age girls who didn ' t exactly have caring parents . Also in this mode is the touching and sentimental &quot; blessing , &quot; the story of a free-spirited Wisconsin farm_girl who dreams of better things but must deal with an abusive father , not to mention all those cows . Actress Melora Griffis gives a nicely unaffected performance and gets_to play a lot of emotional scenes against her real-life father , actor Guy Griffis . One of the audience favorites among dramatic films , &quot; Fresh , &quot; written and directed by Boaz Yakin , also has a splintered family at its core . Twelve-year-old Michael , street name Fresh , is a wise-beyond-his-years Brooklyn kid who works for a pair of local drug dealers and , yes , dreams of better things . An unlikely and often unwieldy amalgam of social consciousness and commercial thriller elements , &quot; Fresh &quot; does feature solid performances from Samuel L . Jackson as Fresh ' s chess-addicted father , Giancarlo Esposito as the boy ' s drug-dealing mentor , &quot; Zebrahead ' s &quot; N ' Bushe Wright as his troubled sister , and Sean Nelson as Fresh himself . One of the most popular documentaries so far also has a family theme . &quot; Martha and Ethel &quot; is an extremely personal look_at the lifelong nannies who raised the large families of each of the filmmakers . Martha , who emigrated from Germany , is the disciplinarian who took_care of all six Ettingers , including co-producer Barbara , while Ethel is an affectionate black_woman from South Carolina who reared five Johnston children , including director-co-producer Jyll . The film has become something of a Cinderella story , getting a distribution deal with Sony Classics after just one screening . With the highly anticipated &quot; Hoop Dreams , &quot; a nearly three-hour documentary on four years in the lives of Chicago-area basketball_players still to come , the most thoughtful and informative doc at the festival so far is &quot; Freedom on My Mind , &quot; co-directed and co-produced by Connie Field and Marilyn Mulford . An examination of the activities of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in rural Mississippi in the early 1960s , this spirited look_at a spirited time evokes a struggle whose enormity we have largely forgotten . Extremely politically incorrect but often quite funny is &quot; Clerks , &quot; a black-and-white dramatic look_at a really bad day in the lives of two members of the dazed and confused generation , New Jersey division . Dante clerks at Quick Stop Groceries in Asbury Park , an establishment that makes a 7-Eleven look upscale , while buddy Randel works_at a nearby video store so feeble he himself rents elsewhere . Ragged , anarchic and clearly too long , this gleefully raunchy series of sketches is a kind of Eric Bogosian meets &quot; Slackers. &quot; Writer-director Kevin Smith doesn ' t handle his female characters very well , but his ear for the obscene banter of guys hanging_out is impeccable . Equal parts funny and offensive , &quot; Clerks &quot; has the kind of cinematic energy that shows Sundance at its best .</TEXT>
