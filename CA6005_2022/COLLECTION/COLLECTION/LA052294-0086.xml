   <HEADLINE> TASTE OF TRAVEL / SINGAPORE ; DISHING_UP A CURE ; THERE ' S A REMEDY IN EVERY RECIPE AT THE IMPERIAL HERBAL RESTAURANT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I have a horrible feeling I know what ' s going_to happen next . &quot; Just a moment , &quot; says my pal Boon Hee , who lays_down his chopsticks , jumps up from the table and scuttles through the packed Imperial Herbal Restaurant . I ' m left nervously making small_talk with Mrs . Wang-Lee Tee Eng , the restaurant owner , between mouthfuls of Shredded Fish With Yam . My worst fears are confirmed when Boon returns waving two branch-like objects . &quot; This one bull penis ; this one deer penis ! &quot; he announces triumphantly . Curious diners watch my expression as Boon and Wang-Lee explain the aphrodisiac properties of the two organs and how they ' re boiled , dried and sliced to make restorative soups and wines . Wang-Lee is especially explicit . The dainty Chinese restaurateur points to the shriveled testicles and rejoices , &quot; that ' s where all_the hormones are ! &quot; Mercifully , Boon returns the offending objects to the kitchen , and we resume one of the most interesting -- albeit peculiar -- meals I ' ve ever eaten . Singapore ' s Imperial Herbal Restaurant , located a stone ' s throw from the legendary Raffles Hotel in the heart of old Singapore , serves a full gamut of dishes expressly intended to remedy ailments from arthritis to low sexual appetite . The restaurant ' s runaway success in Singapore , where 78 % of the population is Chinese , may be attributed to the Chinese conviction that you truly &quot; are what you eat. &quot; It was inspired by southern China ' s &quot; tonic soup &quot; cafes -- eateries whose patrons believe they can calibrate their yin and yang through judicious consumption of soups made with ingredients said to possess curative powers . The soups are familiar to Singaporeans -- many of whom have roots in southern China -- because they are a staple of doting mothers who are thrown into a tizzy if one of their offspring looks even slightly off-color . During a visit to China in 1986 , it occurred to Wang-Lee -- a Singaporean freshly graduated from business_school in Canada -- that she could take the tonic soup concept a step further in her prosperous , food-obsessed homeland . She opened the Imperial Herb Restaurant in 1988 . In contrast to the down-home ambience of traditional tonic soup cafes , Wang-Lee ' s establishment is decidedly upscale , replete with rosewood furniture and antique silk wall_hangings . The restaurant seats 160 , and the day I was there it was crowded with tables full of tonic wine-chugging housewives , yuppies scarfing dishes intended to reduce their stress levels , ginseng-gobbling tourists from Hong Kong , Taiwan and Japan and even a_few bemused gweilo ( white devils like me ) . On Wang-Lee ' s payroll from the beginning has been Li Lian Xing , a famous herbalist / physician from Tianjin , China . Li worked with head chef Bian Jian Nian , who came from a similar restaurant in China , and master chef Shi Lian Yong , a former winner of China ' s prestigious National Culinary Competition , to concoct a myriad of health-enhancing recipes that would produce dishes both curative and delicious . Take , for instance , my shredded fish with yams . The steamed fresh_fish was firm but tender and served in a pungent garlic_sauce that was at once sweet , savory and spicy . Superb to the taste . But that ' s only half the story . According to Wang-Lee , the yams will help strengthen my spleen and stomach , thus improving my digestive_system , and tone_up my lungs and kidneys . The dish also purports to reduce blood_sugar and remedy mild forms of diabetes . As for the Double-Boiled Chicken_Soup With Ginseng and Chinese Wolfberry , the hearty dark broth allegedly improves blood circulation and eyesight , lowers cholesterol and helps control diabetes . The chickens they use for this dish , incidentally , are &quot; black chickens , &quot; a different breed of fowl whose flesh is as dark as slate . The Singaporean Chinese believe it is more nutritious than your run-of-the-mill white-fleshed variety . Double-boiling , Wang-Lee explains , is the process of cooking soup in a container that is then placed in yet another caldron filled with boiling water . There is no direct contact with the heat , so it cooks slowly -- the low_temperature helping to maintain the nutrient content . Tonic soups are usually boiled for at least three hours . Many items on the menu , which emphasizes Beijing-style cuisine , won ' t deter the timid of palate . Most dishes feature such familiar ingredients as seafood , poultry , beef and vegetables . It ' s only the presence of the oddly named curative herbs that is potentially off-putting . I ' m warming to the subject and ask Wang-Lee to recommend something for the aftereffects of a 24-hour , trans-Pacific marathon flight from Boston . She doesn ' t miss a beat . &quot; Coming from a cold , dry climate to Singapore , which is hot and humid , requires your lungs to be moistened , &quot; she says , &quot; and for that I recommend dishes using the bulb of lily flowers. &quot; And jet_lag itself ? &quot; Ginseng , &quot; blurts Boon , and Wang-Lee nods sagely . &quot; Ginseng in tea , in soup , in main dishes -- always restorative , &quot; she intones . Flipping through the menu , I encounter dishes far more exotic than the ones Boon has ordered for us : Monkey-Head Mushroom With Milk_Vetch Root ( &quot; Improves complexion ; enhances memory and all mental functions : sedative prevention of cancer , especially stomach cancer &quot; ) ; Stewed Shin Beef With Plygenum Multiflorum Soup ( &quot; Prevents premature graying ; promotes longevity &quot; ) ; Fresh Water Fish With American_Ginseng ( &quot; Prevents spontaneous perspiration &quot; ) ; The Whip Soup ( &quot; Aphrodisiac &quot; ) ; Gui Fei Soup &quot; ( A lady ' s tonic soup for a youthful beautiful complexion &quot; ) ; Multiflorum Jelly ( &quot; Preserves the original color of the hair &quot; ) . Some dishes have as their main ingredient scorpions and ants , which are first marinated in Chinese rice wine and deep-fried in a lightly spiced batter until they are a crispy golden brown . Ants , a group of esteemed Chinese scientists recently reported , act against rheumatism , hepatitis-B and other &quot; immunity disorders. &quot; One of the Imperial Herbal Restaurant ' s selling points is Li himself , who runs a traditional-looking Chinese herbal medicine counter close to the restaurant ' s entrance , a sight as incongruous as a prescription counter at Spago . By request , Li will check patrons ' pulses , examine their tongues and diagnose their health -- and provide a list of recommended dishes . He may also prescribe a package of herbs ( $ 4- $ 15 ) to steep in hot water and drink . The restaurant starts to empty as Boon and I finish our dessert of Menthol Jelly With Honeysuckle Flower ( &quot; Good for sore_throat &quot; ) , which frankly makes me feel a little peculiar . It has the look and texture of lime Jello , but the menthol has the same effect on my lungs that old-fashioned chest rubs do , without the smell . I sit_back in my seat , waiting for a wave of well-being to wash over me , sweeping away the detritus of jet_lag and an overindulgent night on the town . Nothing . &quot; It ' s not like Western drugs , &quot; Wang-Lee says admonishingly . &quot; You must live healthily and eat herbal meals regularly . No quick-fix solution. &quot; Well , at least my &quot; original hair color &quot; has been preserved .
