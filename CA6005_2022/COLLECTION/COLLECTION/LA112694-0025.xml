   <HEADLINE> RESEARCHER ACCUSED OF FAKING DATA ; SCIENCE : EX-MIT STAFFER IS APPEALING THE 19 ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT . HER STUDY PURPORTED TO USE GENES TO TRANSFER DISEASE RESISTANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal investigators have concluded that a former MIT researcher faked research on antibodies , raising false hope that she had discovered a way to transfer resistance to disease , officials said Friday . The federal_Office of Research Integrity said it found Thereza Imanishi-Kari guilty of 19 allegations of misconduct , including charges she lied to cover_up her actions . Imanishi-Kari has filed an appeal with the Department of Health and Human Services , officials said . Investigators told Imanishi-Kari of their findings three months ago and released them to the public Friday . If the appeal fails , Imanishi-Kari will be barred from receiving federal grants or contract money for 10 years . The research was funded by grants from the federal Public Health Service while Imanishi-Kari worked_at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Her results were published in the April 25 , 1986 , issue of the journal Cell in an article co-authored by Nobel laureate David Baltimore . The article &quot; purposed to show that a gene from one strain of mouse had been transferred to another strain of mouse , resulting in the latter ' s production of high levels of antibody molecules it would not normally produce -- antibody molecules mimicking the antibody molecules produced by the original strain , &quot; investigators said in a written statement . Trouble began when a colleague , Margot O ' Toole , reported that she could not duplicate the results . Prosecutors declined to file charges in July , 1992 , but HHS continued to investigate . After Imanishi-Kari ' s data was challenged , she lied to cover_up her fabrications , investigators said . &quot; Further fabrications appeared in her letter of correction , also published in Cell , and in two grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health , &quot; they said . The results had no immediate impact on human health , but they may have led other scientists to waste time and resources , investigators said . &quot; Besides raising the false hope that a way had been found to transfer resistance to disease , the research may have caused other researchers to pursue unproductive studies , &quot; the statement said . &quot; Other scientists have not been able to reproduce the most significant findings claimed in Cell. &quot; Investigators said they arrived_at their conclusions after reviewing scientific evidence and performing a computerized statistical analysis that showed the false data was not made_up of chance errors , but deliberate ones aimed at a particular result .</TEXT>
