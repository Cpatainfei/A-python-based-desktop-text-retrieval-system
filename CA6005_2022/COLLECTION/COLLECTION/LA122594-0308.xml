   <TEXT> LAND HO ! Isaac Tigrett , co-founder of the Hard Rock Cafe and developer of the House of Blues , has his eye on future upscale blues joints around the country and as far afield as Paris . He is also reputed to be entertaining plans for themed entertainment real_estate projects -- similar to CityWalk in Universal City -- in Las Vegas and elsewhere . . . . Koll Real_Estate Group is pressing ahead with plans for a 3 # 300-home development in the environmentally sensitive Bolsa Chica wetlands .

Merv Griffin , the one-man entertainment conglomerate , recently got the go-ahead to subdivide a 157-acre mountaintop above Benedict Canyon into six enormous home sites . . . . Raffi Cohen , the flamboyant developer , has yet to pull a rabbit out of his hat in the 20-year struggle to develop a prime piece of public land in Downtown Los Angeles , across from City_Hall . If Cohen can ' t get the project back on track , he ' ll lose his development rights . KEEP_ON TRUCKIN ' A milestone in the race to build an advanced transportation industry in California will be reached this spring when Special Vehicle Manufacturing Corp . in Downey rolls_out the first composite-material electric school_bus , the biggest innovation in 40 years in this transportation niche . The low-cost composite techniques , similar to those used in advanced aircraft and race_cars , could help California compete with Georgia , king of the steel school_bus chassis . A Blue-Bird electric bus prototype passed Antelope Valley testing with flying colors . . . . Truck sales will continue at a record pace as Americans trade_in passenger_cars for pickups , minivans and sport utility vehicles . Chrysler will update its industry-leading minivan , and Honda has jumped in -- belatedly -- with the Odyssey , a four-door , Accord-based minivan . . . . Even with U.S. auto sales booming , General Motors is finding it tough to make money at_home . Still , CEO John Smith says GM ' s turnaround is_on track and promises that results will show_up on the bottom_line in 1995 . Labor relations are likely to be come more strident as the United Auto Workers union crowns tough-talking Steve Yokich as its new president . GM is most vulnerable . A major priority for Yokich is settling a bitter 3-year-old dispute at Caterpillar . BANK ON IT The North_American Development Bank will open its doors in San Antonio next month . Set_up under the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , the NADBank has $ 750 million available to finance environmental improvements along the 2 # 000-mile U.S.-Mexico border . Among those expected to apply for loans are Imperial Valley officials looking_to treat sewage from the New River , which is polluted on the Mexicali side of the border but empties into the Salton Sea on the U.S. side . The deputy manager is Victor Miramontes , formerly a vice_president with Wells Fargo Bank in San Antonio . . . . Paul Hazen , who takes_over from Carl E . Reichardt as Wells Fargo chairman , displayed steel and savvy in negotiating Wells ' 1986 takeover of Crocker National_Bank and slashing 5 # 000 employees in the process . He has been_quiet about plans for the state ' s third-largest banking_company . HOLLYWOOD DREAMIN ' Look_for some high-profile hirings and announcements from Jeffrey Katzenberg , David Geffen and Steven Spielberg as the King ' s Ransom Trio tries to overcome Hollywood skepticism about plans to open a new studio . The entertainment titans have dubbed themselves the Dream Team but the proposed studio has yet to be blessed with a moniker . . . . Viacom needs more_than &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; to make its $ 10-billion Paramount acquisition pay_off . It will be up_to Viacom Entertainment unit Chairman Jonathan Dolgen to contain costs and generate entertainment profits . . . . Sony must prove that it can recover from a miserable year in Hollywood . A lot of eyes will be_on former CBS Entertainment chief Jeff Sagansky in his still vague but growing role at Sony . . . . Walt Disney Co . must continue to turn_around its theme park business , though company profit will soar regardless after &quot; The Lion King &quot; comes_out on videocassette in the spring . . . . Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ' s current regime , led by Frank Mancuso , will finally release a full slate of its own films , giving it a chance to prove it can rebuild the venerable studio . SHOP TILL THEY DROP Inveterate shoppers eagerly await the arrival of nirvana -- a.k.a. Bloomingdale ' s -- on the California scene . Federated Department_Stores Chairman Allen Questrom and his troops will presumably be choosing two Southland sites for East Coast mainstay Bloomie ' s by spring , with openings likely before year-end . . . . Questrom will also put his imprint on Bullock ' s and other stores of R.H. Macy &amp; Co. , which merged with Federated in late December after a painful period in bankruptcy . It ' s a homecoming of sorts for Questrom , who headed Bullock ' s in its heyday . . . . Meanwhile , David Dworkin , Broadway Stores ' chief exec , will be aiming to gather sales momentum at the chain , also getting_back on its feet after an episode in Bankruptcy Court . With store renovations complete , the retailer will push its Taste of California housewares line and introduce new casual clothing lines . . . . Yucaipa Cos . Chairman Ron Burkle rocked the Southern California supermarket industry with a deal to merge his Food 4 Less chain with 121-year-old Ralphs Grocery . Now comes the hard part : He must negotiate the regulatory process and consolidate operations . Good news for shoppers : Burkle promises to escalate the grocery price_war . . . . Down the aisle , look_for giant Tri-Valley Growers , a fruit and vegetable processing cooperative based in San Francisco , to be bought or merged with another company . Over-leveraged and undercapitalized , the co-op faces stiff competition in the tough new_world of global agriculture . Shoppers know one of its best-known subsidiaries , S &amp; W Fine Foods . CRUISING THE INFOBAHN Early next year , Congress will take another stab at opening_up the burgeoning telecommunications industry to more competition , and two new faces will guide the effort : Sen . Larry Pressler ( R-S.D. ) and Rep . Thomas J . Bliley Jr . ( R-Va. ) . Billions of dollars and potentially 1 million jobs will ride_on their reform effort . . . . In California , the scramble is_on as MCI , AT &amp; T and others try to win local long-distance customers from Pacific Bell and GTE , with competition opening_up in that market on New Year ' s Day . The California Public_Utilities Commission has vowed to end monopolies in all phone markets by 1997 . . . . Cellular phone magnate Craig McCaw is_on the prowl for licenses to offer personal communications services , the new generation of wireless technology . A federal auction of 99 broad-band PCS licenses is expected to generate more_than $ 4 billion . . . . The launching of the new United Paramount and WB networks will test whether viewers really want a fifth and a sixth network , let alone 500 channels . IN THE CHIPS Keep_an_eye_on Lawrence Ellison of Oracle , a database company that wants to be a key cog in the info revolution by making_possible such applications as video on demand . Also John Moussouris , who promises that his MicroUnity Systems Engineering will ship super-fast chips that can perform multimedia tasks that now require several microprocessors . . . . No matter how late its arrival , Microsoft Corp. ' s Windows 95 operating system is likely to make the personal_computer trade ' s biggest splash next year . The real war for the hearts of computer users is fought at the operating system level , and the battle comes_down to these questions : Who is the best marketer and who has the biggest installed base ? Windows 95 beats offerings from Apple Computer and IBM by default , despite their superior ease of use . . . . Microsoft CEO Bill Gates will be the hot individual to watch ; besides Windows 95 , he ' s rolling_out Microsoft Network , the company ' s entry in the sizzling on-line arena . A potential stumbling_block : Will the Justice_Department clear Microsoft ' s pending merger with Intuit , the king in personal-finance software , or bow to concerns of bankers and other financial service companies ? . . . Apple is likely to license its Macintosh operating system to Motorola , a partner in the company ' s PowerPC venture . If Motorola starts making Power Macintosh clones the platform will get a needed boost , but 1995 is also expected to be the year Intel ' s Pentium microprocessor outsells the popular 486 chip -- especially since Intel promised to replace flawed chips . INFORMATION , PLEASE Electronic commerce could come_of_age as security and convenience improve . Helping to foment change will be Netscape Communications of Mountain View , Calif. , which is licensing navigation software that makes the Internet comprehensible to average mortals . . . . The integration of PCs and TVs will continue apace with cable modems that transfer data as much as 1 # 000 times faster than conventional modems . Interactive television trials will proceed in markets from Castro Valley , Calif. , to Orlando , Fla . . . . Can agent Michael Ovitz drum_up business for the Baby Bells with which he is allied ? Stay tuned . . . . Multimedia will reach critical mass as the number of U.S. homes with computer_systems that play shiny CD-ROMs more_than doubles , to 10 million . . . . Video_games will increasingly go_on line . But Sega Enterprises , Sony Computer Entertainment and NEC Home Electronics , all based in Japan , are among the game makers hoping to escape a sluggish market for their machines with new high-powered , 32-bit devices . In the wings is a 64-bit system that Nintendo hopes to release next fall . . . . Little Grafix Zone in Irvine opened the recording industry ' s eyes and ears to interactivity this year with a CD-ROM based on the work of Prince ; coming soon is a multimedia Bob Dylan in &quot; Highway 61 Interactive. &quot; The times , they are a-changin ' . HOW ARE WE DOING ? Orange County ' s bankruptcy casts a wide shadow over California , but its effects on the state economy will be subtle and modestly negative at worst . The crisis will clip a percentage_point -- about $ 800 million -- off the county ' s economic_growth . Freeway renovations won ' t advance and an $ 82-million police information network will stay_on ice . . . . With small companies as the workhorses pulling California out of the ditch , the state ' s recovery is likely to pick_up steam even as the nationwide upturn begins to show signs of fatigue . The number of payroll jobs should register somewhat healthier gains than the paltry increase of 6 # 000 over the last 12 months , despite continued problems in aerospace and the planned closures of military bases . California consumers won ' t spend with the gleeful abandon of pre-recession times , but the forecast is for a continued upswing as incomes revive and job growth holds_up . . . . Look_for a high-profile role for real_estate expert Dan Garcia , Warner Bros . executive and head of the Community Redevelopment Agency , as Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan pushes City_Hall streamlining and economic development . Plans include reforming the permit process and folding the CRA into a super-agency for economic development . . . . The bipartisan federal commission that has already closed 22 of California ' s 66 military_installations is going_to take another whack at the state ' s remaining bases in March . Additional cuts could be deep . In San Diego County alone , local officials are fearful that the Marine Corps Recruit Depot , the North Island Naval Air_Station and one or more of the four U.S. Navy research laboratories could be axed . ON THE ( REGULATORY ) WATERFRONT The PUC will settle_on a precedent-setting plan for a deregulated electric utility industry , with final adoption expected in September . The state ' s investor-owned utilities will face tough competition from independent power producers and rival utilities . Utility stocks are unlikely to appeal_to widows and orphans any time soon . . . . With Republican Charles Quackenbush replacing John Garamendi as insurance commissioner , the industry is expecting much more sympathetic treatment in Sacramento . But Quackenbush has vowed to deliver all remaining rebates owed to policyholders under Proposition 103 , the 1988 rate-cutting initiative . . . . Joseph A . Dear , head of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration , will be_on the hot_seat . A preliminary proposal designed to protect workers from carpal_tunnel_syndrome and other repetitive stress injuries is_due out , and both labor and management groups are ready to pounce on anything they don ' t like about it . . . . As the fastest-growing sector of the environmental services_industry , pollution prevention will be the buzzword for companies trying to comply with the law and also reduce overhead costs . Revamping manufacturing processes to make them cleaner is often cheaper than installing scrubbers and other machinery at the other end of the pipe . Big winners already in Southern California : Arco , Anheuser-Busch and Northrop . . . . California workers ' compensation insurance rates will be deregulated in ' 95 . When employers renew their policies , they ' ll find there is no longer a state-mandated minimum charge for their coverage . Critics say that some small firms will find themselves paying more . AND WATCH FOR... Gary Groves , a former emergency_room physician , has been at the forefront of change in California ' s rapidly evolving health_care industry . In 1981 , he founded one of the nation ' s first publicly held companies that manage group medical_practices , Pacific Physician Services . The Redlands company has grown quickly and now provides medical services for more_than 280 # 000 people , mostly in California . Aiming to put a tighter rein on costs , Pacific Physicians recently acquired a hospital in Montclair , where it can funnel patients and keep closer tabs on expenses . And Groves has snatched_up medical_practices in Nevada and North Carolina , two states with paltry HMO enrollment . . . . In Los Angeles , the pulse of the advertising business is measured with a speedometer . The new Venice agency Houston Effler Helm Stingley says its first order_of_business is to land an automotive account . Co-founder John Stingley handled creative work_on the Infiniti at Chiat / Day .
