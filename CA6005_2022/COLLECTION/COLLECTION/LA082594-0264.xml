   <HEADLINE> SEN . ROGERS DEFENDS TALK TO GROUP ACCUSED OF RACISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State Sen . Don Rogers , under_fire for his plans to address an organization accused of holding white_supremacist beliefs , dismissed the criticism Wednesday , saying the group was composed of &quot; patriotic Americans. &quot; Rogers , a Republican who represents portions of the Antelope Valley , said he accepted an invitation to speak at a dinner Saturday night during the Jubilee newspaper ' s fourth annual conference in Bakersfield . According to the watchdog group Coalition for Human Dignity , the California-based Jubilee is the leading national publication of the Christian Identity movement . Followers believe that white northern European descendants are superior to other races and often refer to people_of_color as &quot; mud people , &quot; said Noah Chandler , a spokesman for the Center for Democratic Renewal , which tracks the religious right . Joining Rogers in the lineup of speakers will be Louis Beam Jr. , a former leader of the Texas Ku Klux Klan and an Aryan Nations organizer who is also a staff writer for the Jubilee . &quot; These guys are just hate mongers , and it ' s an absolute disgrace for a California state_senator to be speaking_to such a group , &quot; said the Rev . Jerry Sloan of the Sacramento-based Project Tocsin , which also monitors the religious right . &quot; The people with whom he is breaking_bread may be Christian , but they are definitely also white supremacists. &quot; Rogers said he does not share the views of white_supremacists and plans to speak only of a Senate resolution he authored to reaffirm state and individual rights . &quot; My impression of the Jubilee people is that they are a group of patriotic Americans who are working to preserve and restore individual rights and freedoms , &quot; Rogers said , adding he knows_nothing about charges that the group promotes racism . Jubilee representatives did not return phone_calls Wednesday . This will not be the first time Rogers has attended one of the group ' s annual gatherings . Two years ago , the senator spoke against gun_control and environmentalists at a conference in Mariposa , Calif . A May-June , 1992 , edition of Jubilee heralded Rogers for his talk and praised him for never voting for a tax increase . The same issue carried an article describing the Los Angeles riots as &quot; savage and senseless Negro attacks on White_persons . . . and massive looting by Latinos who swarmed into shattered buildings as mad dogs attacking a helpless lamb. &quot; The Jubilee maintained in that edition that its stance on race superiority was exaggerated by a biased media . In 1984 , Beam , a former grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Texas , was ordered by a court to cease harassing Vietnamese shrimp fishermen in Galveston . Five years later , he led racist skinheads in an Aryan Nations march in Tennessee . Rogers , who represents portions of Kern , Inyo , San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties , said he is only interested in finding supporters to back his resolution underscoring the U . S . Constitution ' s 10th Amendment , which says the federal_government cannot force unreasonable mandates on states . A veteran of battles with the federal_government over payment of back taxes , Rogers is a fierce believer in individual rights . He consistently ranks among the state Senate ' s most conservative members . The 66-year-old legislator , with two years remaining in the Senate before term limits force him out , also authored a separate resolution to reaffirm Californians ' right to bear arms . A resolution is non-binding and does not carry the force of law . &quot; I am the captain of my ship . I set the agenda , &quot; Rogers said . &quot; If someone wants to come_on board my ship and support my issue , they are welcome to do so , but they abide_by my rules . This does not mean that I support their position. &quot; Even with Rogers ' firm denial that he shares_in any racist beliefs , his appearance before Jubilee supporters is nonetheless damaging , said Robert Crawford of the Coalition for Human Dignity . &quot; The main thing is a lot of these groups reach_out to public officials or people with a broader public base to legitimize themselves , &quot; Crawford said . &quot; It lends them a legitimacy that they don ' t otherwise have access to in spreading their anti-Semitic and racist pseudo-religious ideas. &quot;</TEXT>
