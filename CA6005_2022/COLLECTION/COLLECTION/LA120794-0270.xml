   <HEADLINE> PG &amp; E TO SLASH PRICE OF DIABLO ELECTRICITY ; ENERGY : THE MOVE TO CUT_RATES FROM THE NUCLEAR POWER_PLANT COMES AS THE INDUSTRY PREPARES FOR DEREGULATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co . said Tuesday that it will cut the price of electricity produced by its Diablo Canyon nuclear_power plant by more_than $ 2 billion over the next five years . The plant near San Luis Obispo , which was bitterly opposed by environmental activists , cost $ 5.5 billion to build . Cost_overruns on its construction in the early 1980s eventually led to a $ 1-billion write-off on the facility . Ironically , since a 1988 rate agreement with the California Public_Utilities Commission , the utility has been accused of reaping unreasonable profits from Diablo . Tuesday ' s plan was reached in_agreement with the PUC ' s Division of Ratepayer Advocates , the state_attorney general and several consumer groups . It is subject_to approval by the full PUC . Analysts said the move would help PG &amp; E compete more effectively with lower-priced independent power_companies as the California utility industry is deregulated . The PUC has proposed that competition be phased_in over several years , beginning in 1996 -- though just how this will be done is unclear . The plan means that &quot; we ' re going to have less revenue , and it will affect the bottom_line , &quot; said Stanley T . Skinner , PG &amp; E president and chief_executive , &quot; but this represents no threat to the dividend. &quot; Skinner said the utility expects to offset the plan ' s impact on earnings by continuing an aggressive cost-cutting program and by increasing its own unregulated , independent power production business . PG &amp; E has cut 6 # 000 jobs in the last two years and plans $ 285 million in cost reductions for 1995 . Analysts , who had been concerned that high rates for Diablo power would make_it difficult for PG &amp; E to compete with lower-rate power_companies and other utilities , applauded the plan . &quot; PG &amp; E ' s competitive position will substantially improve , &quot; Charles Benore , a PaineWebber analyst , said in a report Tuesday . But Benore warned that PG &amp; E ' s average electricity rate , 10.6 cents a kilowatt-hour , is among the highest in the nation and will remain high even with the price_reduction at Diablo Canyon . ( The average rate represents the average price paid_for power to residential , industrial , commercial , wholesale and retail users. ) Skinner said all customers will benefit from the plan with an extension of the utility ' s current rate freeze through 1996 . He predicted rate drops to begin in 1997 . One consumer group , San Francisco-based Toward Utility Rate Normalization , refused to sign the agreement . The plan requires &quot; no real sacrifices , &quot; said Audrie Krause , TURN executive_director . But Ratepayer Advocates director Ed Texeira called the agreement &quot; unquestionably a $ 2-billion step_forward in reducing . . . excessively high rates. &quot; Electricity generated at Diablo Canyon currently costs 11.89 cents a kilowatt-hour ; the price was scheduled to rise to 12.2 cents in 1995 and to 13.3 cents in 1999 . Under the new plan , PG &amp; E would instead reduce prices 32 % in the next five years , for a price decrease to 11 cents per kilowatt-hour in 1995 , 10.5 cents in 1996 , 10 cents in 1997 , 9.5 cents in 1998 and 9 cents in 1999 . PG &amp; E stock closed_off 12.5 cents at $ 61.375 a share on the New York Stock_Exchange .</TEXT>
