   <HEADLINE> GOLF / THOMAS BONK ; ALL NORMAL OPEN NIGHTMARES ARE NOW IN PLACE AT OAKMONT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. Open is a little more_than two weeks away from its shrunken-fairway , roller-coaster-green , ball-eating-rough , four-day joy-ride through Oakmont Country_Club . Usually , it ' s a blast there , except if you happened to be unlucky enough to lose your ball in rough that is only slightly shorter than every club in your bag . Oakmont isn ' t exactly a place for the faint of heart . The United States Golf Assn . has ruled that the rough be no more_than four to five inches long , a far_cry from 1983 , the last time the Open was played there , when six-inch rough was standard and so was the complaining from the players . The fairways are so narrow , you have to turn sideways to walk them . Actually , they are about 30 yards across , so hitting it straight will be at even more of a premium than usual . If that ' s not enough , there are the greens . The only thing faster are the cars on the Pennsylvania Turnpike , which oddly bisects the course and puts holes Nos . 2 through 8 on the other side of the highway . It ' s clear that somebody is going_to pay the price for these conditions . It ' s happened there before , we have learned . The only thing that golf admires more_than a great winner is a great loser , and Oakmont has had its share . In fact , two of them are playing in this Open -- Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson . Palmer , who won his only U.S. Open title in 1960 when his closest challenger was an amateur named Jack Nicklaus , probably could have won two more , in 1962 and 1973 . On the final day in 1962 , Palmer and Nicklaus were tied with five holes to play , and both parred each hole to finish tied , although Palmer could have ended it . He missed birdie putts of less than 15 feet on Nos . 14 , 17 and 18 . Nicklaus won the playoff the next day with a 71 , three strokes ahead of Palmer . It was Nicklaus ' first Open as a professional . Palmer was tied for the lead after 54 holes of the 1973 U.S. Open at three under par . His only problem was 26-year-old Johnny Miller , who was three over par and getting ready to shoot an Open-record 63 to deny Palmer again . Palmer ' s fourth round included a missed short birdie putt at No . 11 and three consecutive bogeys , after he looked_at the scoreboard and was stunned to see Miller leading . Watson arrived_at Oakmont as the defending U.S. Open champion in 1983 and was_well aware of what evil the course could conjure_up . Watson had lost the 1978 PGA Championship at Oakmont when he blew a five-shot lead after 54 holes -- and a four-shot lead with nine to go . Watson double-bogeyed No . 10 , shot a three-over-par 38 on the back nine and lost to John Mahaffey in a playoff . Then in the ' 83 Open , Oakmont ' s back nine got_to Watson again . He had a three-shot lead with nine holes to go , but came_home with another 38 and lost to Larry Nelson by one stroke . * Add Oakmont : Oakmont was designed before they found a place to put it . Henry C . Fownes , who sold his steel_company to industrialist Andrew_Carnegie in 1896 , and Fownes ' son drew the layout of the course on paper , then set_out to find the land on which to build it . Fownes located the acreage he was looking_for in the borough of Oakmont , about 15 miles from Pittsburgh . But he also found a big problem , according to Jim Finegan in the June issue of Golf magazine : Too many oak_trees . The idea was to create a big , open layout like a British links course , so Townes had the trees cut_down and in 1903 got what he wanted -- a bleak , barren and very long golf_course -- eight par-fives , one par-six and a par of 80 . There also was more sand than anyplace except the Mojave , with more_than 200 bunkers on the course . At one time , the bunkers numbered 350 . Tommy Armour , who won the first of Oakmont ' s U.S Opens in 1927 , called it a &quot; cruel and treacherous playground. &quot; After six Opens , the trees at Oakmont are as large as the greens , although the putting surfaces still resembles Armour ' s playground with their speed and pitch . * New racket : Except for the Champions tour and TeamTennis , Jimmy Connors is using his racket a lot less than his golf_clubs these days . Connors , 41 , winner of 109 tennis titles , including eight Grand_Slams , has a list of 100 golf_courses he would like to play and is working his way through it . First on the list ? &quot; Augusta , &quot; said Connors , who lives_in Santa Ynez and said he plays every day . Connors is trying to arrange his schedule so he can be at Oakmont next month to watch the U.S. Open . He said the successful golfers at Oakmont could be the straight hitters on the narrow fairways . &quot; I can see Tom Kite or Corey Pavin doing_well , or the old guys like Tom Watson , Jack Nicklaus or Raymond Floyd , &quot; said Connors , who also thinks Seve Ballesteros could prosper . The USGA did not give Ballesteros an exemption , and the 36-year-old Spanish player must be No . 1 or No . 2 on the European tour money list to be eligible for the Open . Ballesteros , who was No . 1 last week , played an event this week in Europe , so his current ranking will be known later today . For what it ' s worth , Golf Digest rates Nick Faldo as the favorite at Oakmont . * Abandon ship ? : The Queen Mary Open has been around for 23 years . It ' s the tournament where such players as Fred Couples , Craig Stadler , Scott Simpson and Mark O ' Mears made their pro debuts , but chances are it won ' t be back in 1995 . Doug Ives , who founded the event and remains the chairman , said the Queen Mary Open may ship out if he can ' t find a sponsor for the event , which finished its 1994 run Saturday at Lakewood Country_Club . &quot; This isn ' t scare tactics , this is reality , &quot; Ives said . &quot; I ' m tired_of subsidizing it. &quot; Other players who made their pro debut in the Queen Mary Open are Corey Pavin , Bob Tway , Keith Clearwater , Jay Don Blake , Duffy Waldorf , Bill Glassen and Dan Forsman . Not only does the Open have a rich tradition , it also carries a $ 100 # 000 purse . But Ives said sponsor dollars are drying_up and county fees are too high . * Add Queen Mary : Mac O ' Grady played in the tournament at various times under three names -- Mac O ' Grady , Phil McGleno , Phil O ' Grady . * PGA at Riviera : The PGA is looking_for 2 # 000 volunteers for next year ' s PGA Championship , which will be played Aug . 7-13 , 1995 , at Riviera . For information , call ( 310 ) 573-7780 . The last time the PGA Championship was held at Riviera was 1983 , when Hal Sutton won by a stroke over Nicklaus . * Back , back back : Nancy Lopez , who hurt her back at the McDonald ' s LPGA Championship two weeks ago , picked_up her clubs again to play in the JCPenney LPGA Skins Game in Frisco , Tex. , this weekend . Lopez , the all-time leading money winner in Skins history with $ 320 # 000 , had a bulging disk and was advised to take a month off . Lopez didn ' t . She isn ' t intimidated by injuries , or much of anything , with the possible exception of Laura Davies . &quot; She ' s the only person I ' m intimidated by because I can ' t out-hit her , &quot; Lopez said . &quot; She out-hits me by 40 yards . that ' s pretty intimidating. &quot; Golf Notes Jamaal Wilkes , Jerry West , Dick Butkus , James Worthy , Doug Christie , Luc Robitaille , Willie Gault , Steve Garvey , Elgin Baylor , Johnny Mathis , Cathy Lee Crosby , Andy Garcia , James Garner , James Woods , Peter Falk and others will play in the fifth Toyota / Jerry Buss celebrity golf tournament June 6 at Riviera .
