   <HEADLINE> PRIVATE LIVES ; COMPUTER_GAME REVIEW ; FOR SALE : THE ' MONA LISA ' ; MILLENNIUM AUCTION LETS YOU BID ON SOME OF THE WORLD ' S TREASURED ARTWORKS AND CURIOS , INCLUDING NIXON ' S 18 MISSING MINUTES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here we are again in the future with a CD-ROM game that features exotic opponents , high-tech gadgets and brutal battles . But for once , the setting is neither outer space nor a post-nuclear landscape . This futuristic actioner takes_place in one of the most vicious of real-life settings -- an art auction_house . Millennium Auction is the first in a planned series of CD-ROM games by the Eidolon company in New York targeting an adult audience . The game takes_place in the year 2011 at a high-stakes auction of some of the world ' s most treasured artworks and curios , including the &quot; Mona Lisa , &quot; the &quot; Pieta , &quot; the missing 18 minutes of Richard Nixon ' s White_House audiotape , &quot; The Scream , &quot; Mann ' s Chinese Theatre ( the last movie_theater in the country ) and a robotic sex partner . The on-screen players come from a variety of backgrounds and situations , including an African American opera diva , a Saudi_Arabian developer and a German art critic . These exotic-looking bidders seemingly share only one attribute in common : None cares about the aesthetics or historical value of the items on the block . The sole objective of Millennium Auction is to acquire works that will increase in value and can be sold during the course of the game at a substantial profit . The winner , declared at the end of a 12-item auction_sale , is the player with the most cash . Millennium Auction might be billed as futuristic , but it seems nostalgic for the 1980s . * My buddy Aaron and I play a round to try_out the game . We are first directed to pick who we would like to be from a list of seven bidders . Aaron chooses to take_on the persona of Chanteena , the opera singer . I become Takeshi Mori , described as a &quot; Japanese cyberpunk entrepreneur. &quot; The computer picks two additional players ( an auction round requires a total of four ) -- &quot; arrogant American financier &quot; Randall Smith and German art critic Dieter Haas , who would be very much at_home on &quot; Sprockets. &quot; Let the back-stabbing begin . We are welcomed by the animated hostess , Nuria , a creepy and completely dour &quot; bidder liaison &quot; who speaks_of the &quot; unholy marriage of art and money. &quot; We enter the gallery , where the bidders are depicted as standing among the artworks , engaged in pre-auction conversation . By clicking on them with the mouse , we overhear snippets of gossip . It seems some of the pieces up for auction are of questionable authenticity and others are in danger of falling_in value . More information is gained from clicking on a newscast and from clicking into the maintenance office where Zeke , the kindly janitor , has access to some inside skinny . Then it ' s off to the bidding room for the action part of the game . All bidders start with an $ 8.5-million stake to make bids . Objects come onto the block and a lively on-screen auctioneer kicks_off the bidding . Aaron and I hit designated keys on the keyboard when we want to make a bid . The computer controls the bidding of Randall and Dieter . The idea is to try to get objects you want at a reasonable price while bidding up other objects in hopes of depleting your opponents ' funds . You are never quite sure when the computer-controlled bidders will quit , suddenly leaving you stuck_with paying_for an item you don ' t want . As the game progresses , news_events can bolster or deplete the value of the objects in your possession . Millennium Auction is an attempt to capture the interest of the same adult gamers who enjoy the challenge of Monopoly or Pictionary -- games of skill and chance that can be played in groups . Millennium Auction is not as engaging as those two games -- its game-play is not as straightforward and parts are frustratingly repetitive and slow . On the plus side , Millennium Auction has wonderful visuals and occasional bits of humor far more sophisticated than the CD-ROM norm . It ' s an admirable , nicely stylized first try at what could be an interesting genre for CD-ROM games . By the way , the two computer bidders came_out ahead of both Aaron / Chanteena and me / Takeshi . I came_in last but am now the proud owner of Hokusai ' s &quot; View of Mr. Fuji &quot; woodcut and the last surviving swordfish on Earth .</TEXT>
