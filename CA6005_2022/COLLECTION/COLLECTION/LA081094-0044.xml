   <HEADLINE> 2 SLAYINGS AT ABORTION CLINIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * As you stated in your editorial ( &quot; When Extremism Becomes Terrorism , &quot; July 30 ) , &quot; Nothing can justify the outrage that occurred in Pensacola. &quot; As a pro-lifer , I could not agree more . If the alleged perpetrator of this crime against humanity is found guilty , then the death_penalty is a just punishment . The murders of those two people , and the wounding of another , are bad news for the pro-life movement because , first and foremost , two lives were lost . That is not what the pro-life movement is about . Secondly , it is bad news because the liberal Establishment and the liberal media , of which The Times is a glaring example , are all too willing to condemn everyone in the pro-life movement for the actions of three nuts . Let ' s be clear about this . Regardless of the unjustifiable murders of three people in Florida , the big picture has not changed . Killing unborn children is still immoral , monstrous and wrong . JEFFREY C . AYER Yorba Linda * At least The Times does admit that the vast majority of anti-abortion Americans , myself included , do not support the killing of abortionists . There is enough killing done at abortion clinics already . Anti-abortion activists who are contemplating violence must remember that they have no more right to kill an abortionist than an abortionist has to kill an unborn child . But pro-abortion advocates like The Times should realize that , like slavery , the abortion issue will no go_away until abortion itself has gone_away . MLISSA SIMPSON Huntington Beach * The incident of a second murder of a physician performing abortions ( and of his volunteer companion ) is appalling ( July 30 ) . Yet , it is not so incredible because the killer had been given publicity for advocating this kind of murder . In fact , this man , a former minister ( dismissed from his church ) , was given legitimacy in_the_public_eye by being invited to appear on several radio and TV talk_shows . People with off-the-wall moral beliefs ( e.g. , it ' s not only OK but morally justifiable to kill doctors who perform abortions ) are at least psychologically unstable . Inviting such a person as a guest on popular talk_shows feeds the fires of his passion and further encourages him to justify to his &quot; audience &quot; and to himself that his moral stand is acceptable . I find it indefensible that the media should have as a guest a man who &quot; has traveled the country over encouraging anti-abortion violence , &quot; saying that &quot; murdering abortion providers was tantamount_to ' justifiable homicide ' &quot; ( July 30 ) . Those who honor &quot; the morality of violence against doctors &quot; as a legitimate topic for debate in the media and invite speakers who advocate murder bear some responsibility for violence leading to murder . ROSE M . BROMWICH Van Nuys * As a strong supporter of the pro-choice movement I , as most other citizens of all beliefs , am appalled and angered by the wanton murder of doctors who perform abortions . I am frightened by the cheapening of the value of life as shown by drive-by_shootings , freeway shootings , carjack shootings , bombings and all_the other terrorism and violence in our daily lives . I read that Paul Hill , the accused murderer of Dr. John Britton , believes that abortion is murder and thus considers his act to be &quot; righteous retribution. &quot; I can ' t believe that I am the only one who finds it hard to reconcile that it is all_right for the state to take a life by capital_punishment and consider it &quot; righteous retribution. &quot; Where is the distinction ? GLORIA DREXLER Santa Monica * So once again anti-abortion-rights activism results in coldblooded murder . And once again the leadership of the anti-choice movement scrambles to distance itself from the crimes of its followers . But to succeed , they must persuade the people that there is no connection whatsoever between their messages of hate and intolerance and the actions of hate and intolerance splashing across the headlines . Truly , they do not advocate murder or the oppression of the rights of others , not in so many words . But when they exhort their minions to assert their rights to free expression at the clear expense of the rights of others to obtain legally offered services , is it not logical that the followers will view the rights of those who disagree_with them as devalued , and therefore not worthy of consideration ? When the leaders proclaim abortion to be a crime against Almighty God , does_it not follow that some zealous &quot; Soldiers of Christ &quot; will take_up arms to avenge their Lord ' s honor ? When the leaders denounce abortion as murder most heinous , does_it not follow that some will seek to assert justice through execution ? They who sow the seeds of hatred will reap the harvest of violence and bloodshed , and let no person think that a hasty statement of denial can sever the clear connection between the self-righteous cause and the tragic effect .
