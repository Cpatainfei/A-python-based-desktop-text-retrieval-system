   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : COMPANY TOWN ; STARK FINDS LITTLE NOSTALGIA FOR OLD IDEA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With movies such_as &quot; Speed &quot; driving a strong summer box_office , look_for plenty of upward mobility in Hollywood this year . It usually takes just one hit , or even one widely acclaimed piece_of_work , to move someone ' s salary into the fast_lane these days . The most celebrated recent case involves comedian Jim Carrey , whose asking price rose from about $ 450 # 000 to $ 7 million after he starred in the sleeper hit &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective. &quot; Carrey may get another boost from &quot; The Mask , &quot; which comes_out soon . Others likely to benefit from their roles in summer sensations include Keanu Reeves of &quot; Speed &quot; and John Goodman of &quot; The Flintstones. &quot; that ' s great for stars and their support teams , but it ' s enough to make others nostalgic for the days when salaries were more managed under the old studio system . Producer Ray Stark ( &quot; The Way We Were , &quot; &quot; Steel Magnolias &quot; ) , for one , has quietly lobbied for a modified version of that system , only to discover that Hollywood is not a very nostalgic place . Stark ' s appeal began five years ago when he broached the idea with Motion_Picture Assn . of America President Jack Valenti . In a letter obtained by The Times that has not surfaced publicly before , Stark argued that spiraling salaries were throwing Hollywood ' s economy out of whack and damaging performers ' long-term careers -- because they worked less often and rarely established definitive screen personas , other_than as action stars . As a solution , he suggested that the studios embrace an updated contract system that would permit them to nurture talent as they did_in the days of Clark Gable , Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant . * Under Stark ' s detailed plan , each major studio would put_up $ 250 # 000 to begin funding an &quot; actors ' school. &quot; Some 12 students would be accepted to the school each year . The students could be represented by traditional agents and lawyers . But in return for training and guaranteed employment , they would agree to work under a seven-year personal services agreement , with per-picture salaries capped at $ 2.5 million . Stark told Valenti he had discussed the plan with most of the major studio chiefs at the time and that they were receptive , even encouraging . But it died there , although the producer recirculated the letter two years ago . Stark , confirming that he wrote the letter and still favors the idea , recalled that the industry never responded . &quot; Valenti said , ' Yeah , let ' s do something , ' &quot; Stark said . &quot; But no one ever took_on the project. &quot; It may_not take a Ph.D in logic to figure_out what happened . In Hollywood , it ' s a given that the balance_of_power has shifted from the studios to talent , which explains why stars such_as Arnold Schwarzenegger can command $ 15 million a film . Sources say most executives would be frightened of supporting such a fundamental change , because it could touch_off a holy war with big stars and their phalanx of powerful agents , managers and lawyers . It ' s possible that those studio chiefs who expressed interest in Stark ' s plan were doing so only hypothetically . But the plan also seems to raise antitrust issues , which are alluded to in the letter . The issue remains so sensitive that even now , no one but Stark will openly discuss it . * Valenti failed to return telephone_calls for comment after a copy of the letter was faxed to his Beverly Hills hotel at his request . Three of the studio chiefs named in the letter also declined to comment , with one saying he ' d just as soon shoot himself in a particularly sensitive area . Stark , one of those rare people in Hollywood who is successful and powerful enough to speak his mind , said he ' s never made a crusade out of the idea . But as someone who started as an agent representing actors such_as John Wayne and Lana Turner , he said he honestly believes that the old system did a better job of building careers . &quot; In the old days , personalities were built -- you went_to see Clark Gable no matter who he played , &quot; Stark said . &quot; But the studios don ' t build talent anymore . They build buildings. &quot; * Unity in numbers : As Europe lurches toward a new entertainment trade_policy , the American Film Marketing Assn . is lobbying against the formation of a pan-European movie distributor . In a letter to the European Audiovisual Conference , which begins discussions in Brussels on Thursday , AFMA President Jonas Rosenfeld argues that a subsidized pan-European company would turn_into a bottomless money pit . Rosenfeld says national distributors are already doing a good job of fostering multinational productions and other types of joint_ventures . European Union officials are heatedly debating how to revive the group ' s troubled entertainment_industry . The most nationalistic representatives have argued that the answer lies_in limiting the number of American movies and TV_shows allowed_in Europe . Those forces also succeeded in excluding entertainment from last year ' s General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . But Rosenfeld said the most vociferous complaints are coming from those involved with the creative side of the industry , with business interests going &quot; frequently unheard. &quot;</TEXT>
