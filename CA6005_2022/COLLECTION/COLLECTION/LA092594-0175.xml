   <HEADLINE> MISSING THE BULLY PULPIT : CLINTON ' S INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> America ' s most successful chief_executives have been preaching Presidents -- men with a vision of where the country needed to go and a facility for leading it there . For Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wil son , Franklin D . Roosevelt , Harry S . Truman , John F . Kennedy , Lyndon B . Johnson and Ronald Reagan , the White_House was a Bully Pulpit from which they could win Americans over to a cause imbued with moral and practical good_sense . The second Roosevelt , borrowing from the Bible , may have put it best : &quot; Where there is no vision the people perish. &quot; Throughout our history , Americans have been most drawn to the activist presidents with a coherent idea of how to achieve a more prosperous , just and peaceful society . Administrations with a Square_Deal , New Deal , Fair_Deal , Great Society , and Reagan Revolution have been more popular and accomplished than those without a core idea of how to advance the national well-being . But Americans are lukewarm toward a President who seems to stumble from one problem to the next without any clear sense of his overall intentions or , if they exist , any ability to communicate them to the public . Sadly , this describes President Bill_Clinton . This has been particularly true in foreign affairs , where Americans are always reluctant to tread and do so comfortably only when they have a clear idea of what potential and actual sacrifices in blood and treasure mean . The crusades to end war and defeat Nazism and communism appealed_to the national belief in purifying world politics and making the world safe for democracy . But having a good cause is not enough , even for the most righteous of our presidents . They must also be effective communicators -- politicians with resonant voices , an infectious smile , a buoyant manner , a kindly demeanor , an extraordinary ordinariness . There must be the magical phrases that stick_in people ' s minds and seem worth repeating . Wilson gave speeches that were so lyrical you could have danced to them . Franklin_Roosevelt , the greatest of our great communicators , invented the &quot; fireside chat , &quot; the warm , homey , hearth-side talk broadcast from his living room in the White_House to every one else ' s across the country . &quot; I miss the way the President used to talk to me about my government , &quot; people told Eleanor Roosevelt after her husband ' s death . &quot; In human affairs , the public must be offered a drama , &quot; Roosevelt told Charles de Gaulle at the Casablanca conference in January , 1943 . And such dramatics , staged by a master playwright and actor , were the stuff of political leadership on major questions vital to the life of the nation . By contrast , recall the failure of Herbert Hoover . Described as dour , uninspiring and rigidly puritanical , critics complained that &quot; a rose would wilt in his hand. &quot; Witness the defeat of Jimmy_Carter , a man of transparent decency , whose most memorable speech glumly described the country ' s &quot; malaise &quot; and made him an easy political mark for the charming , easy-going Reagan . Clinton knows all this . Moreover , he is one of the most intelligent and attractive personalities to have held the presidency in this century . His skill as a speaker and with the press are more_than a match for any politician currently on the national scene . His address to the Congress earlier this year arguing the necessity of health-care reform was beautifully crafted and compellingly delivered . Which brings us to his current difficulties with Haiti . True , for the moment , the Carter-Sam Nunn-Colin L . Powell negotiation with the military junta appears to have saved the President ' s political life . Averting a military clash that would have cost American lives and opening the way to the restoration of Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power , the agreement is being hailed by the Clinton_Administration as a triumph of the President ' s diplomacy . But Clinton and his advisers would do_well to consider how close they came_to political disaster . Whatever the merits of putting U.S. forces in Haiti -- and much can be said against it -- Clinton ' s greatest failing , once he decided to exercise the military option , was the decision to proceed without public and congressional backing . How could someone as astute and practiced in U.S. politics as Clinton have decided to commit himself to a military_action supported by only 31 % of the public and less than a solid majority in the Congress ? Surely , the President knows that even initially popular responses to aggressions challenging or seeming to challenge America ' s national interest lost part , if not much , of their appeal once lives began to be lost . Franklin_Roosevelt spent more_than two years preparing an isolationist America for involvement in a war that meant far more to its well-being than Haiti could ever be . Truman and Johnson , despite widespread national support for combatting the communist threat , lost political control in the waves of recrimination that engulfed their policies in Korea and Vietnam . By contrast , George_Bush , in the most masterful episode of his term , brought 90 % of the country to his side with the shrewd preparations that preceded the military response to Iraq ' s occupation of Kuwait . However overdrawn , comparing Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler and the Iraqi attack to Czechoslovakia and Munich , was a clever political appeal that won Bush not only public support but also a strong congressional endorsement . To be sure , the distressing thought_of a hostile Iraq in control of Persian_Gulf oil made Americans more receptive to Bush ' s appeal for intervention in the Gulf than they would be to any argument about toppling a military dictatorship in Haiti . Still , a candid presidential case against inhibiting the flow of Haitian migrants fleeing economic privation and political terror in their country would have had resonance with many Americans . Clinton did make the case to the American public about the criminality of the current regime . But what about Aristide ? It is doubtful that more_than a handful of Americans know enough about the man to make the idea of sacrificing American lives to re-establish his power compelling . But the fact that he was the only democratically elected president in that benighted country ' s history and that he is a Catholic priest with a genuine moral compass would mean something to Americans . America ' s past failed hopes of bringing democracy to Haiti by landing the Marines in 1915 is enough to make the current involvement seem like another episode in a long list of Caribbean misadventures . But even if Clinton ' s decision to use U.S. muscle to advance democracy ' s cause and block another flood of poor immigrants to our shores ends badly , there is still no excuse for his failure to practice the politics of foreign_policy more effectively than he has . Before he confronts the next inevitable overseas crisis , he should recall how presidents like Roosevelt and Kennedy , his two favorites , prepared the way for tough responses to complicated world problems . Roosevelt , for example , lived_by the proposition that a successful policy abroad required a stable consensus at_home -- one nurtured by presidential persuasion . Haiti , so far , is a demonstration of how not to win domestic support for a risky foreign_policy . Let us hope that Clinton will not take a narrow_escape from a Haitian political disaster as a reason to ignore what his lead-up to the invasion should teach . Shuffling around a press secretary has nothing to do with a President ' s ability to talk to the public . Clinton must recognize that the best of our presidents have done a lot of on-the-job training . It could make the difference between remaining in the White_House or joining all those other one-term Presidents in this century who lacked the wisdom and eloquence to advance their political fortunes and the national well-being .</TEXT>
