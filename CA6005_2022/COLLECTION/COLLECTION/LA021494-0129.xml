   <TEXT> Swedish defenseman Tomas Jonsson has a chance to become only the second player ever to win an Olympic gold medal and have his name on the Stanley Cup . Jonsson , who played_on the New York Islanders ' Stanley Cup championship teams in 1982 and ' 83 , can share the distinction with by Ken Morrow , who won a gold medal with the U.S. in 1980 at Lake Placid and was a member of the Islanders ' four Cup-winning teams . &quot; For a European guy , an Olympic gold medal is really big , &quot; said Jonsson , who assisted on Sweden ' s first goal Sunday . &quot; There is no comparison. &quot; But to win that medal , Jonsson said Sweden will have to improve its play over its tournament-opening effort Sunday . Sweden fell_behind Slovakia , 3-2 , before scoring twice in the third_period . A goal by Roman Kontsek with 5:48 to play brought Slovakia even . * Peter Forsberg , the Swedish center who signed a three-year , $ 6.9-million ( Canadian ) contract with the Nordiques , did not impress one knowledgeable observer Sunday . &quot; He doesn ' t play every night , &quot; said Finnish center Raimo Helminen , who plays against Forsberg in the Swedish Elite League . &quot; Some nights he ' s not so good. &quot; Although widely rated the best young player in the world , Forsberg has also been criticized for being inconsistent . He played well at the Izvestia tournament in December , but was not a factor_in the pre-Olympic Globen Cup competition in Sweden . His future Nordique teammates have publicly groused about the money given him by Quebec ' s management , creating the potential for discord . &quot; I feel sorry_for him , &quot; said his teammate , Jonsson . &quot; There ' s too_much pressure on him for a guy who ' s only 21 . He ' s going_to be a great hockey_player , but it ' s tough for him. &quot; * Mikko Makela is hoping to catch the eye of NHL general_managers and scouts at the Olympics and get an offer to return to the NHL . &quot; I want to go_back there , that ' s no secret . If I play good here and in the world championships , maybe that will open some doors for me , &quot; said Makela , who had a 36-goal season for the Islanders in 1987-88 but never became the prolific scorer they though he would . He had seven goals in 45 games with the Kings in 1989-90 before being traded to Buffalo . Makela ' s Finnish team , seeded seventh , opened the Olympics with a 3-1 upset of the Czech Republic , which is seeded third . That has made Finland a new medal favorite . The Finns play Russia today . &quot; It ' s going_to be tough for us , playing two good teams right away , but we ' re all excited about playing Russia , &quot; he said . &quot; I think they have a good team . Always in Russia the margin was really small between their ( worst ) team and first_team . Now , maybe the margin is a little bigger , but they ' re still a good team . Four or five teams can win here , and I think we have a strong team. &quot; Finland ' s best Olympic showing was a silver medal in 1988 . * Being chosen the first flag-bearer in Slovakia ' s first Olympic appearance was beautiful , &quot; said Peter Stastny , the former Quebec Nordique and New Jersey Devil standout . &quot; It wasn ' t only spectacular , it was a lifetime experience , &quot; he said . The only achievement he could imagine that might surpass it would be for Slovakia to win an Olympic game here , an accomplishment it narrowly missed Sunday in a 4-4 tie with Sweden . Slovakia is seeded 12th in the 12-team Olympic field . Sweden is seeded second . &quot; We could have won , but I ' ll take it , &quot; said Stastny , who scored Slovakia ' s third goal . &quot; I ' m very proud today. &quot; Slovakia became an independent nation in July , 1992 , and was not represented at the 1993 World Championships . Stastny , a fervent backer of Slovakian independence , agreed to represent the new country last fall even though he was 37 and had planned to return to Quebec this season . &quot; You have to understand , we were over 1 # 000 years out of independence , &quot; he said . &quot; During World_War_II we had five years of a Slovak state , but that was all . . . . &quot; All my dreams came true . To carry the flag , play for my national team and helping the country enjoy the sport , that ' s very , very special to me. &quot; HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
