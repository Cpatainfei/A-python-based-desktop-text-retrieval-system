   <TEXT> &quot; Hi . You ' re early , &quot; says Ma ya Lin hurriedly , as she appears out of the throng in Penn Station . With that , the famed creator of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial leaves a waiting visitor and climbs_on a hydraulic lift to the scaffolding around her newest public art project , some 15 feet above the crowd . Like a White Rabbit in Commuterland , Lin has no time to talk , on this day in late July , to anyone but the crew : The earthbound visitor may be early , but the project is running late . Early , late . Time has been weighing heavily on the architect / sculptor as the deadline for her work -- an artistic focal_point of the $ 190-million Penn Station renovation -- has pressed ever closer . There ' s a certain irony here , since the piece is itself about time . Designed to suggest a lunar_eclipse , the work is part timepiece , part overhead sculpture : When &quot; Eclipsed Time &quot; has its long-delayed public unveiling in early fall , it will mark the hours for some 250 # 000 people who hurtle daily through Penn Station , while providing a visual fulcrum between the new 34th Street entrance and the vaulted passage that runs east to west through the cavernous underground transportation hub . What will Long_Island and subway commuters see -- if they actually take the time to look_up ? A large oval form enclosing a frosted-glass disk on which the numbers 1 through 11 have been etched . Behind the glass disk is yet another disk , of brushed aluminum . As the aluminum disk moves across the glass , it eclipses the numbers , until at midnight the disks are aligned and the work is dark , except for a soft halo ; at noon , by contrast , the glass is completely illuminated , via a complex fiber-optic system that culminates in hundreds of pinpoints of light . That is the plan -- elegant and artistically minimal -- and it has been working perfectly in Lin ' s Bowery studio . But there have been inevitable snags during the installation of the massive piece in Penn Station . &quot; It ' s been 2 1 / 2 weeks of incredible stress , &quot; says Lin , relenting enough to allow her visitor briefly up_on the scaffold . A slight figure in her chinos , she deals equably with the ironworkers and electricians to sort_out the latest hitches in the schedule . Flaws have been detected in the frosted glass disk , and Lin is awaiting the arrival of an emergency order of &quot; etching cream. &quot; A newly discovered structural beam in the ceiling has interfered with the placement of a transformer box containing halogen bulbs and the box will have to be moved . The delay has made the architect visibly anxious , and even less happy than usual about being the focus of media attention . An intensely private person , Lin has been celebrated for 13 years -- ever since she designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington -- for making public art . &quot; It ' s a paradox , &quot; admits the 34-year-old artist . &quot; I really believe that the work is public , but I ' m not. &quot; Maybe her skittishness stems from the furor she faced as a 21-year-old Yale architecture student when her design for a V-shaped memorial of black granite was selected over hundreds of other entries in a nationwide competition . It comes almost as a shock to recall , now that the memorial has become a virtual icon of its era , what anger it once stirred in those who thought it &quot; demeaning &quot; to veterans . &quot; A black gash of shame and sorrow &quot; is how one leader of a Vietnam veterans ' group described it . As an Asian American woman , Lin also endured personal slurs -- political , sexist and racist -- before the controversy died_down and she was able to escape the limelight for a time . Yet when she re-emerged , it was with another public memorial : a monument honoring the civil_rights movement commissioned in 1988 by the Southern Poverty Law Center . I ts 1989 dedication in Montgom ery , Ala. , marked the end of her involvement with public memorials , Lin says : &quot; I was fortunate enough to work_on ( monuments for ) two wars of our era . With the completion of the Civil Rights Memorial in 1989 , I very happily laid that to rest. &quot; She has been working since on a variety of projects , including a renovation of the Museum for African Art in SoHo , a sculpture commemorating more_than two decades of undergraduate coeducation at Yale and a three-story garden of crushed glass for the Wexner Center for the Arts at The Ohio State University . She ' s even completing her first commissions to design private homes -- one in Santa Monica , the other in Williamstown , Mass . And she is pursuing her interest in environmental issues through contact with several groups that have been exploring a possible paper recycling plant in the South Bronx . But for the past several weeks , all her fine-tuned energies have been concentrated_on the Penn Station clock . Its installation marks the culmination of five years of effort , ever since Lin ' s design was selected in an invitational competition sponsored by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ' s Arts for Transit program . ( Because of the enormous area covered by the renovation , two artists were chosen to enhance the look of Penn Station ; terra-cotta bas reliefs by Andrew Leicester adorn several walls of the site. ) The work was judged by a panel that included artists Chuck Close and Mel Edwards , as well as some well-known curators and a representative of the Long_Island Rail Road . &quot; This was a very sophisticated panel , &quot; says panel chairwoman Wendy Feuer , director of the Arts for Transit program , which can allocate up_to 1 % of MTA construction budgets_for art in subway and railroad_stations . ( Given the scope of the Penn Station renovation , though , the art allocation was nowhere near 1 % , Feuer notes. ) &quot; They were interested in reviewing the work of artists who worked environmentally , who had national and international reputations and whose work conceptually could encompass large and disparate areas , &quot; Feuer explains . Nor was that all . The design requirements , recalls Lin , included some important negatives : &quot; Viewers couldn ' t touch it . It couldn ' t slow_down traffic . It couldn ' t have seating . &quot; I thought , what a challenge ! , &quot; says Lin , warming quickly to her subject once she takes a brief break from the problems on the scaffold . &quot; Given all these , how can you still communicate ? &quot; The trick , as Lin puts it , was to create a &quot; one-on-one dialogue , &quot; despite the limitations . In fact , all her public work -- beginning with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and its thousands of inscribed names of the dead or missing -- has endeavored to do just that : to take the massive and public and reduce it to the individual and private . And though &quot; Eclipsed Time &quot; is her first interior art installation , with unique problems , Lin ' s goal is still &quot; creating one still moment &quot; in the organized chaos of Penn Station . The concept of a lunar_eclipse , both romantic and familiar , is her way of saying stop , look and -- if you have the time -- think . &quot; What ' s really ironic , &quot; says Lin , by now bubbling with enthusiasm , &quot; is that though it deals with motion , you can ' t see it move . Though it deals with the passage of time , you ' d really have to stand_still to see the disk move. &quot; But standing_still is at a premium . Problems beckon up_on the scaffold . In a_few minutes , time ' s up for Maya Lin ' s visitor , who watches the slender figure in chinos weave back through Penn Station to play with time in her art .</TEXT>
