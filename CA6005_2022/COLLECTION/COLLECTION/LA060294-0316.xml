   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO HALT ALL FLIGHTS , FINANCIAL TIES WITH HAITI , OFFICIALS SAY ; CARIBBEAN : MOVES WOULD TIGHTEN EXISTING SANCTIONS . CLINTON REPORTEDLY HAS ORDERED OTHER STEPS AIMED AT REGIME ' S CIVILIAN BACKERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration is planning a ban on all air traffic , including passenger service , between Haiti and the United States , as well as a cutoff of financial transactions with the Caribbean nation , diplomatic and Haitian officials say . The actions , described by a U.S. official as &quot; the next logical step , &quot; would augment already stringent international economic and financial sanctions that have stopped all but commercial passenger air traffic . President Clinton also reportedly has ordered other steps aimed at punishing civilian backers of Haiti ' s military rulers . The order affecting air and financial services will come this month , perhaps within two weeks , one U.S. official said . He said several days ' notice will be given before the flight cutoff to allow people -- especially Americans -- to leave or return to Haiti . Embassy sources estimate there are 1 # 000 Americans in Haiti . U.S. officials said the latest bans target wealthy civilian supporters of Haiti ' s military rulers , who took power in September , 1991 , violently overthrowing Jean-Bertrand Aristide , this nation ' s first democratically elected president . They said the cuts_in air traffic and financial transactions will be the last efforts by the White_House to persuade the military to give_up power or face American military intervention . &quot; If this doesn ' t show them that we are serious , then I guess only Marines at the airport will do_it , &quot; said an American source in a telephone_interview from Washington . The tightening of the sanctions is part of an apparent three-step U.S. approach that involves reducing the privileges of the civilian elite ; squeezing the general population with the aim of causing serious public discontent , and openly threatening military_action . As a measure of the heightened tension here over the possibility of U.S. military_action , the United Nations and other international_organizations later this week are expected to order dependents of their officials and employees to leave Haiti as soon as possible . One U.N. official said dependents were never officially permitted , although several have come_to Haiti over the last few months anyway . They now are being told to leave . The French Embassy also is preparing to send dependents out of the country and is closing its school early . U.S. diplomats here said a similar American move &quot; is always under_consideration . But not yet . There is nothing in the works. &quot; The American move to sever air and financial links would come_in an executive order from Clinton . It would apply only to flights between the United States and Haiti . But it would effectively isolate this tiny island nation , because almost all international service in and out of Haiti connects through the United States ; there are only infrequent flights through Panama , France and Canada . The end of air service would be little more_than an inconvenience , not a hardship , for most Haitians , particularly the wealthy families who travel often for shopping , entertainment and business . But many among this nation ' s elite take great pride in their access to American culture and commerce and see their ability to fly_on a moment ' s notice to Miami as their escape route , if and when life in Haiti becomes unbearable . &quot; You are going_to see a scramble for the airport like you can ' t imagine , &quot; a Haitian businessman said . &quot; These people think they have a God-given right to go_to Miami . Take that away from them and they ' ll feel helpless. &quot; The Clinton_Administration , embarrassed by reports of the devastating effects of economic sanctions on the poor but not the rich here , is moving to close , at least partially , the loopholes that had favored the elite and the military regime . Officials said the U.S. Embassy has recommended to the State_Department that some of the wealthy , who had been exempted , now be added_to a list of Haitians prevented from traveling_to the United States and that their assets there be frozen . These individuals had been left_off the list , even though they had backed the 1991 coup , because , as a U.S. official here said , &quot; they had a role to play &quot; in resolving the current crisis through their supposed influence with army leaders . But the official , when asked this week to explain the policy shift , said of these families , &quot; They seemed to have played_out their role. &quot; State_Department sources said news_reports of the exemptions &quot; forced the White_House to act . It was hard to defend letting the Brandts and Madsens ( two of the most powerful and outspoken families supporting the military ) go_back and forth to Miami while children were seen starving. &quot; Embassy officials would not disclose the list . But other sources said at least three members of the Madsen family had lost visas . And one American source said that &quot; it is reasonable to expect that all &quot; the elite families would lose their visas , including the Brandt , Madsen , Acra and Mev families . Sources also said the United States was seeking to void contracts held by these families that enable them to control the import of the food , humanitarian aid and medicine exempted under the sanctions . While the air ban would put some strains on individuals and families , the major impact would come from the cutoff of financial transactions . As with the general sanctions , the pain from Clinton ' s newest decision would be felt most by the poor and the middle_class . The move is likely to do little more_than inconvenience the military and its civilian supporters . It could even enrich them , many sources said . &quot; This will prevent Haitians in the United States from sending money to their families , &quot; said a Haitian businessman . These payments , or remittances , amount to tens of millions of dollars yearly and are the only source of money for many Haitians , especially the poor . One businessman observed of the transactions ban : &quot; It will cause a giant leap in the currency black_market and make the gourde ( Haiti ' s currency ) worthless . Anyone who has access to dollars will be rich . And who has the most access to dollars ? The military . &quot; They ' ll continue to run the smuggling , drugs and all_the other things , &quot; he added .</TEXT>
