   <HEADLINE> ITALY SEES ONLY A CUP HALF EMPTY ; REACTION : CITY STREETS , GATHERING PLACES DESERTED AS NATION MOURNS TEAM ' S LOSS TO BRAZIL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A funereal silence shrouded Italy ' s city streets , beach resorts and countryside Sunday as Italians mourned their soccer team ' s loss to Brazil in the World Cup_final . Small pockets of cheers resounded around the Brazilian Embassy in downtown Rome , while huge crowds of disillusioned Italians walked away from the piazzas and stadiums of Italy where the game was shown live_on huge television screens . One of the few celebrations that could be heard during the otherwise silent night was at the Brazilian Embassy , where a jubilant crowd of Brazilian soccer fans watched the game in an overflowing auditorium . Customary television talk_shows after the game_showed a brief panorama of deserted city piazzas and streets pocked with police ready for the crowds that failed to materialize . The city_centers of Naples , Turin and Palermo were scenes of desolation after the match , with nothing but empty beer_cans and broken bottles to mark the passage of thousands of eager , hopeful fans . In Rome ' s central Piazza del Popolo , the giant screen that had shown every Italian game to thousands of fans broke_down Sunday night , causing a massive protest by a crowd of about 15 # 000 spectators , some of whom clashed with police before dispersing to other makeshift television setups . The city water_company had turned_off the water_supply for those fountains that could become impromptu swimming_pools for would-be revelers . While many Italians had gone_away to watch the game at weekend hide-outs and resorts , others had flocked back to city homes to see their team play what Italian Soccer Federation president Antonio Matarrese called &quot; one of the most exciting World Cup finals. &quot; &quot; This was the first time the World Cup was won on penalty kicks , &quot; he pointed_out in an interview from Los Angeles . &quot; And perhaps it would be a good idea to abolish this system. &quot; Azeglio Vicini , the Italian national team coach of 1990 , said , &quot; We watched it with our hearts in our mouths. &quot; Most experts showed little surprise , however , at the travails of the suffering Italian team , several members of which played injured . &quot; The team was in disastrous physical condition , &quot; said Gianni Rivera , a former national team player . &quot; The result was not unexpected. &quot; The consensus was that Italy had achieved an honorable second place against a more aggressive , fitter team . &quot; To reach the finals in this World Cup was already a remarkable achievement for Italy , &quot; was the upbeat comment from Enzo Bearzot , who coached the victorious 1982 national team . Said former national great Paolo Rossi : &quot; Brazil is a stronger team and Italy ' s is an honorable second place , but it grieves me to see a World Cup_final decided on the basis of penalty kicks. &quot; Italy ' s honor was its strong defense , rather than its attack , which showed , according to another former national team player , Roberto Rosato , that &quot; we were , in_effect , the second team of the World Cup. &quot; &quot; The Italian defense was great , but Brazil deserved to win -- they had more chances to score , &quot; said one fan , Marco D ' Arro . &quot; But I ' m very , very sad just the same. &quot; Coach Arrigo Sacchi came under predictable criticism from soccer experts and fans for not substituting attacker Giuseppe Signori , leading goal scorer in Italy ' s national championships , at least in the final , decisive minutes . As disconsolate and weeping fans went_home with their banners and flags still furled , newspapers were coming_out with their disappointed headlines : &quot; Shot Down Only on the Penalty Kicks , &quot; said the Turin daily La Stampa . . . . &quot; Thanks Just the Same , &quot; said the Roman left-wing newspaper L ' Unita .</TEXT>
