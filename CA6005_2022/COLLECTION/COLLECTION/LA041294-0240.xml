   <HEADLINE> BELGIANS FLEEING RWANDA AS ETHNIC KILLINGS MOUNT ; CENTRAL_AFRICA : MANY FOREIGNERS STILL AWAIT RESCUE IN BELEAGUERED CAPITAL . CEASE-FIRE ACCORD FAILS TO TAKE_HOLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amid continued fighting and tales of horrific carnage , the emergency evacuation of Westerners from Rwanda gathered pace Monday as more_than 100 Belgian nationals were flown out of the country and others awaited rescue in the beleaguered capital , Kigali . The Belgian Defense Ministry here said that about 250 of the 3 # 000 Belgians working in Rwanda had been flown to Nairobi , Kenya , by late Monday and that others were expected to leave the war-torn country soon , despite the dangers of the rescue operation . Frederic Francois , a Belgian television_reporter in the capital , reported that a Belgian military convoy moving from Kigali ' s airport into the city had been caught briefly in fighting Monday between the mainly Hutu government forces and units of the dissident Rwandan Patriotic Front , a rebel army made_up mainly of ethnic Tutsi . &quot; Like every night , we ' ve heard bullets whistling through the Kigali night , &quot; he said . There were other reports of convoys of Westerners -- seeking to avoid some of the heaviest fighting on the main approach road to the airport -- making their way through muddy side streets littered with bodies and echoing with the moans of wounded . But the worst reports of atrocities seemed to come Monday from hospitals , where troops were said to have slaughtered patients , some in their beds as they awaited treatment . In one incident , soldiers repeatedly bayoneted two civilians , who had sought medical_care , in full of view of doctors , nurses and patients in a crowded emergency_room of Kigali ' s central hospital . Francois reported that about 150 or 160 Westerners of various nationalities had taken shelter at a French school in Kigali as they awaited evacuation , while another 40 Belgians had arrived in the capital from outlying areas . There were also reports that bands of mainly young Rwandan men armed with machetes , spears and bows_and_arrows were roaming the city . &quot; The lack of security here is total , &quot; Francois said . About 400 Belgian troops are now in Rwanda as part of the rescue operation , and Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix indicated Sunday that it could be days before all remaining aid and development workers from his country are airlifted to safety . A Defense Ministry spokesman here said an agreed-upon cease-fire between the two warring groups had still failed to take_hold . &quot; In Kigali , the cease-fire has not held , &quot; Col . Freddy van der Weghe told reporters . &quot; The ( Rwandan ) army has been firing sporadically using heavy_weapons . The situation is still unstable , ( and ) there is still shooting between the RPF and the army. &quot; He said there were unconfirmed reports that a Rwandan Patriotic Front battalion had entered the city . The majority of French , Americans and other Westerners trapped by the convulsion of violence and ethnic warfare that erupted in the Central African_nation after last Wednesday ' s apparent presidential assassination have reportedly already fled the country . The latest frenzy of violence between Rwanda ' s majority Hutus and minority Tutsi may have left as_many as 20 # 000 dead , according to an estimate by the International Red_Cross . Belgian national television , which put the death toll in Kigali alone at 10 # 000 , aired footage that showed streets littered with bodies . Victims in the slaughter have included priests , nuns and local employees of international assistance agencies . In one incident , members of the French-based medical assistance organization Doctors Without Borders arrived Sunday morning at a tent hospital where they had been treating the wounded , only to find that more_than 100 of their patients had been murdered by soldiers . A Swiss radio reporter told Belgian television Sunday that he entered a church , apparently in the Kigali area , and found the bodies of an estimated 70 Tutsi , many of them women and small children . Long-simmering suspicions of Belgium , the former colonial power in Rwanda , along with rumors that Belgians were somehow involved in the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana , have severely complicated the rescue of Belgian nationals . Habyarimana was killed Wednesday when the plane carrying him and Burundian President Cyprian Ntayamira crashed as it prepared to land in Kigali . Rwandan officials said it was shot down by unidentified attackers . Forces believed to be part of the Rwandan army or the elite Presidential Guard initially prevented Belgian air_force C-130 transport planes from landing at Kigali , and there have been several reports of Belgian nationals being harassed by Rwandan troops as they tried to flee the fighting . The government here confirmed Monday that six Belgian civilians had been killed in the unrest . Outside the capital Monday , the Belgian Defense Ministry reported conditions were_quiet in the country ' s second- and third-largest cities , Butare in the south and Gisenye in the north , but heavy fighting was said to have occurred in the northern town of Ruhengeri .</TEXT>
