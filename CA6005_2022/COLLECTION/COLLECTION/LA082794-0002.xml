   <HEADLINE> ANOTHER WHALE OF A FIND IN SOUTH COUNTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bulldozers working_on the grounds of St . Timothy ' s Catholic_Church on Friday had just rolled_over a 5-million-year-old whale skeleton too deteriorated to save , when 30 feet from the blade a second giant skeleton appeared . &quot; We were very surprised to see another one , &quot; said Marion Kearin , a geology student who works for a paleontologist monitoring construction of a parking structure at the church . Excitement mounted , she said , when it appeared that this fossil skeleton , which was buried deeper than the first , was much better preserved in a waxy clay layer . The first of the two whales , both probably about 5 million years old , was found Thursday in a hard layer of gypsum that once had formed at the bottom of an ancient sea . The bones were porous , Kearin said , which indicated they belonged_to a mammal . After a day of painstakingly chipping_away the gypsum , technicians uncovered the outline of skeleton at least 28 feet long with a rib_cage about 6 1 / 2 feet wide , although the features were not yet clear enough to identify . Unfortunately , Kearin said , the whale ' s head was missing , which made_it impossible to determine its species . For that reason and because the fossil was not well preserved , Kearin said , the find was not considered important enough to warrant excavation . So about 11 a.m. Friday , after the whale had been measured and photographed by the technicians and filmed by several science_teachers from Saddleback Unified School District , the bulldozers rolled_over it . Half an hour later , a bulldozer blade hit yet another skeleton about nine feet underground . By late Friday , the outline of a skeleton at least 21 feet long could be distinguished , although the features were not yet clear enough to identify . &quot; It is a mammal and encased in marine sediments , so a whale is a real good bet , &quot; Kearin said , adding that technicians would work_through the weekend to uncover and identify the skeleton . Father David Gruver , associate pastor at St . Timothy ' s , said the church had agreed to halt further grading through Monday so the scientific value of the second skeleton can be determined . But Gruver said he is concerned about a longer delay . &quot; We are kind of hoping it isn ' t that valuable , &quot; he conceded . The church has been waiting years for money to build the parking structure , he said . &quot; The other day , Kathy ( Liuzz ) , the office manager , said nothing can stop us now unless they dig_up a dinosaur . And here they found an ancient whale. &quot; John Minch , a paleontologist from Mission Viejo who is familiar_with the region , said the finding of fossil whales in south Orange County is becoming almost commonplace . Minch said his firm alone , which has been monitoring construction of the San Joaquin Hills Corridor , has found at least half_a_dozen whales in South County in the last year , including a 26-foot , perfectly intact skeleton that has been placed on public display in Buena Park . The geologic formation in which these whales have been found , called the Capistrano Formation , dates them as having lived 5 to 6 million years ago , Minch said , when the ocean ' s shoreline was along the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains near what is now the community of Rancho Santa Margarita . At that time , he said , the location of St . Timothy ' s , at Crown Valley Parkway and Nueva Vista , was under 4 # 000 to 5 # 000 feet of water . Because the area abounds with whale remains , Minch said , scientists are collecting only the better specimens . Most ancient whales would be very recognizable , he said . &quot; They look very much like the whales we have today. &quot; Kearin , who by Friday evening was exhausted and nursing blistered fingers from the work of unearthing fossils , said it had been &quot; an invaluable experience &quot; for her as a geology student at Saddleback . &quot; You learn a lot more out_in the field than in the classroom. &quot; Moreover , Kearin said that just watching the dig was special for anyone interested in science who happened to walk by . &quot; They may see everything in a museum , she said , &quot; but watching them dug_up is exciting . It is nice they got_to see it happening in their own back yard. &quot;</TEXT>
