   <HEADLINE> AT &amp; T PULLS THE PLUG ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATOR ; TECHNOLOGY : COMPANY SAYS ITS EO DIDN ' T SELL WELL ENOUGH . MOVE COMES EVEN AS PCS LICENSES ARE BEING POUNCED ON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even as bids reached towering heights at a federal auction of the airwaves for the newest generation of wireless communications devices , AT &amp; T announced Wednesday that it is giving_up on EO , a 3-year-old venture that sought to exploit exactly that market . EO produced a so-called personal communications device -- a hand-held_computer that can send electronic_mail , among other things -- that flopped in a market that has proven slow to develop . AT &amp; T said that when its partners refused to invest more money to rejuvenate the product , it decided to pull the plug . &quot; Given the slow development of the personal communicator market generally and the low acceptance of EO ' s products , AT &amp; T believed it would not be prudent for AT &amp; T to invest more in EO without additional financing from other investors , &quot; said Carl S . Ledbetter , president of AT &amp; T Consumer Products and an EO board_member . In an interview , Ledbetter said he sees no irony in the fact that AT &amp; T ' s pullout occurred during the week that investors were pouring about $ 470 million into the Federal Communications Commission ' s auction of licenses to operate such devices -- far above expectations . &quot; The bidding on the licenses shows an enormous number of people are willing to bet that there will be an enormous market when we get_it right , &quot; Ledbetter said . &quot; We are still a long-term investor in this business category , but EO ' s implementation may_not be it. &quot; AT &amp; T would n ' t say what it had invested in Sunnyvale , Calif.-based EO . The company said it will take a charge against earnings , but it said the charge will not have a significant effect on corporate results . EO can take some comfort in the problems facing everybody else in the business . Virtually all companies looking_at the personal communicator business -- including Apple Computer , Motorola , Compaq , Microsoft and IBM -- have complained of unusually tough hurdles in designing products that combine multiple technologies , tackling a new market and facing high requirements for quality , price and usability . * EO was formed in 1991 with backing from such big names as AT &amp; T , Japanese electronics giant Matsushita Electric and Italian computer power Olivetti . The idea of a portable device for the mobile executive that could be a phone and fax as well as offer e-mail was attractive and received much publicity . EO predicted 100 million personal communicators would be sold by 2000 . But when the product came_out in 1993 , it cost $ 3 # 000 , weighed six pounds and was the size of a note pad . Customers weren ' t interested . Only 10 # 000 of the gadgets were sold . The company cut its 200-man staff in half in February . The closing will throw 97 people out_of_work . &quot; It may take 10 or 12 years before we can look_back and say this market was successful , &quot; Ledbetter said . Technology shortcomings were a key factor_in problems at EO as well as with Apple ' s Newton . Both products relied heavily on handwriting recognition to avoid having to include a large keyboard . Users found the technology clumsy and impractical . Handwriting technology will play a far smaller role in new products such_as Microsoft ' s WinPad . The EO product ' s greatest strength , its cellular_phone , also proved to be a great weakness . While consumer use of cellular_phones is subsidized by service providers , so that one can buy for $ 100 a phone that may cost five or 10 times that to make , EO had to charge customers the full cost of adding a phone to its device . Apple Computer introduced a second version of its Newton to respond to complaints about the handwriting-recognition problem as well as the lack of communications on the device . But while the Newton can now receive e-mail messages , it must be plugged into a phone_jack to send them . A new generation of devices is trying to learn from the tribulations of EO and Apple . But they are facing tough engineering and marketing challenges . Motorola said earlier this month that shipment of its Envoy , a $ 1 # 500 device that could send and receive faxes and e-mail , would be postponed until the end of the year for additional testing . &quot; These systems are very complex , &quot; said Jeff Morris , vice_president of marketing at Motorola ' s wireless data group , citing the challenge of combining a new operating_system with a computer and a wireless transmitter . For example , the microprocessors , which provide the computer capability , and the device ' s transmitter tend to interfere with each other ' s operation unless they are properly shielded , he said . * The difficulty of bringing_together all_of the various elements required to make the personal communicator work means the handy devices won ' t arrive as one great revolutionary gadget everybody will want , said Gerry Purdy , editor of Mobile Letter , an industry newsletter . &quot; You ' ll see this developing step by step , &quot; he said , adding that the first big step won ' t come_with expensive products such_as Motorola ' s Envoy but with cheaper devices such_as two-way pagers that can send and receive snippets of text and voice messages . But such low-cost devices may create demand for the more sophisticated products now coming_on the market . Such use will also help create the communications infrastructure needed to support the personal communicator business . Personal Communicators At &amp; T is pulling_out of the market for hand-held communications gadgets though some forecasters see a fast-growing future for them . Here are some of the devices available now or slated for introduction in the next few years . * Compaq : Plans a hand-held communicator in mid-1995 that will use Microsoft WinPad , a portable extension of Windows . The product offers E-mail and software for scheduling and other personal tasks . * Apple Newton : The second-generation product is still selling slowly . Apple is targeting corporate customers as opposed to the general market . The Newton has a similar range of functions as promised by WinPad . * EO : A startup backed by AT &amp; T , Matsushita and Olivetti that sold 10 # 000 units and is now liquidating . The device is a cellular_phone with fax and E-mail capabilities . * Motorola and Sony : Both are expected to introduce devices this summer using Magic Cap , software produced by General Magic . Features : e-mail , home shopping , personal productivity . * Bell South : A product called Simon , built by IBM and Mitsubishi Electric , was expected out_in March but is now slated for late summer . Fax , pager , cellular_phone and E-mail . PROJECTED SALES Sales and projected sales of personal communicators in the United States , in thousands : ' 93 : 9 ' 98 : 2 # 250 ( projected ) Source : International Data Corp .</TEXT>
