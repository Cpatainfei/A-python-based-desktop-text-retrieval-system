   <HEADLINE> TURKISH MILITARY , GUERRILLAS ESCALATE BATTLE OF WILLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This nation ' s highest appeals court on Monday upheld the detention of six Kurdish members_of_Parliament accused of treason , while in the war-scarred countryside , security_forces and Marxist guerrillas fought a battle of wills in a struggle that is polarizing this key country at the crossroads of the Balkans and the Middle_East . In Kurdish-dominated areas of southeastern Turkey , Monday was Nowruz , an ancient regional festival greeting the first day of spring . In recent years , celebrations of folk_dancing and fire-jumping had become a stage for bloody protests by Turkish Kurds seeking greater ethnic and political rights . At least two people died in a police raid in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir on Monday , and Kurdish leaders reported about 200 arrests , but most people stayed home . The Turkish armed forces flooded the southeast with troops , and , atypically , invited Kurds to celebrate a festival that has long triggered official disapproval . In response , the guerrillas , who seek an independent Kurdish state , instructed people to stay off the streets . It was a draw Monday in the distant , rural and poor region where about half of Turkey ' s 12 million Kurds live and about 11 # 000 people have died in the decade-long struggle between guerrillas and the armed forces . &quot; Once again the people were trapped in the middle , &quot; reported Mettin Corabatir , a Turkish television newsman , as cameras panned through tense streets patrolled by gunmen in civilian clothes and soldiers in uniform . The balance of terror gripping the southeast has drawn fire from international human_rights activists , who accuse both the armed forces and guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party of major abuses . More_than 800 villages have been forcibly evacuated -- some of them destroyed -- in an army drive to isolate the guerrillas , who often murder country folk who shun their cause . Hundreds of Kurdish leaders in the southeast have been slain , and arbitrary arrest and torture are routine tools of state repression , human_rights groups charge . Seven radical Kurdish members_of_Parliament were arrested earlier this month after being stripped of their parliamentary immunity . They allegedly expressed support for guerrillas fighting for a separate state for the 20 million to 30 million Kurds , a non-Turkic , non-Arabic people who speak their own language but lack their own country . The Turkish constitution asserts that there are no minorities in Turkey . Calls_for Kurdish rights , therefore , are treasonable in the view of government officials . Lawyers for the jailed Kurds argued that lifting their immunity was illegal . On Monday , as widely anticipated by Turkish observers , the country ' s constitutional court disagreed . It freed one of the deputies on a technicality , but confirmed detention of the rest .</TEXT>
