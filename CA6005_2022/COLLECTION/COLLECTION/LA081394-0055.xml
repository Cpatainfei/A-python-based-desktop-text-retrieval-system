   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; TREASURY RATES SLIDE , PUSHING STOCKS HIGHER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Long-term Treasury rates fell , pushing stocks higher Friday on news of unexpectedly tame inflation in July . However , reflecting the prevailing view that the Federal_Reserve will hike interest_rates next week anyway , shorter-term maturities dipped slightly . Indeed , the inflation news only further muddled the market debate over when and by how much the central_bank will next push_up rates . By day ' s end , the yield on the Treasury ' s 30-year bond fell to 7.50 % from 7.57 % on Thursday , pushing its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , up 5 / 8 point , or $ 6.25 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Prices of short-term Treasuries , meanwhile , rose only 1 / 16 to 5 / 32 point and intermediate maturities rose 1 / 4 point to 15 / 32 point , the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported . Still , the modest rally in long-term bonds erased nearly all_the sharp price drop from Thursday , when the market tanked after a lackluster auction of new 30-year bonds and a report of higher-than-expected producer inflation . Many traders had prepared_for a sharper increase in the wake of Thursday ' s report that producer prices jumped 0.5 % in July . Bond market participants fear inflation because it tends to diminish the value of Treasury securities and other fixed-income investments . Inflation also increases the likelihood that the Federal_Reserve will raise interest_rates . But on Friday , the Labor_Department reported that inflation as measured by the Consumer_Price_Index , excluding the volatile food and energy sectors , rose 0.2 % in July , less than expectations of a 0.3 % increase . Most analysts agreed that it would not deter the Federal_Reserve from raising short-term interest_rates next Tuesday at its Federal Open Market Committee_meeting in a bid to head_off future inflation . But James Solloway , research_director at Argus Research Corp. , said it might convince the Fed to tighten just 0.25 % , instead of the 0.50 % that had been feared as recently as Thursday . Back on Wall_Street , where stocks rallied on the falling interest_rates , the Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.81 points to 3 # 768.71 , adding 21.69 points for the week . In the broader market , advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Big Board volume retreated to a moderate 249.28 million shares , down from 275.70 million the day before . The NYSE ' s composite index rose 1.46 points to 254.77. The Nasdaq index of mostly smaller companies rose 3.41 points to 731.61. The Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 list added 3.06 points to 461.94. Among the market highlights : * Caterpillar added 2 1 / 8 to 105 1 / 8 after the company said its worldwide sales and profits will be stronger than expected . * Renewed takeover rumors in the food sector , notably of CPC International and Heinz , lifted food stocks . CPC added 1 3 / 4 to 51 7 / 8 , and Heinz rose 1 1 / 8 to 37 1 / 8 . General Mills advanced 1 11 / 32 to 53 31 / 32 . * Exxon rose 2 1 / 8 to 60 1 / 4 after a jury ordered the company to pay fishermen $ 286.8 million in compensatory damages for losses as a result of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill . The figure was significantly lower than the $ 895 million that plaintiffs had asked_for . * Syntex was the most active issue on the NYSE , finishing_off 1 to 21 5 / 8 . Traders said there were rumors that Roche Holdings of Switzerland was going_to cancel its bid for Syntex , but a Roche spokesman said the deal is going as expected . * Amgen stock was higher on rumors that the biotechnology company may be the target of a takeover_bid . Amgen was up 1 5 / 8 at 53 3 / 8 on 2.8 million shares traded . Overseas stock_markets were mixed despite interest_rate increases in Sweden and Italy . Frankfurt ' s DAX 30-share average closed_down 1.42 % , or 30.6 points , at 2 # 124.68 , while London ' s Financial Times 100-share average ended_up 4.1 points at 3 # 142.3. In Tokyo , the Nikkei 225-share average ended at 20 # 663.83 , off 157.53 points , and Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index ended 40.87 points higher at 2 # 637.76. Meanwhile , the dollar fell modestly against other key currencies as most U.S. dealers shrugged_off an early plunge in European trading and focused instead on the U.S. bond and stock_markets . In New York , the U.S. currency finished at 1.552 German marks and 100.15 Japanese yen , down from 1.561 marks and 100.23 yen , respectively , on Thursday . Market Roundup , D3</TEXT>
