   <HEADLINE> ENTHUSIASM , CONFUSION MARK VISTA DEBUT ; TRANSPORTATION : NEW COUNTYWIDE BUS SYSTEM SURVIVES FIRST-DAY GLITCHES , MAKES HISTORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The buses were late , the schedules missing and the riders confused . But despite the glitches , the launch of the new countywide VISTA bus_service Tuesday was met with enthusiasm by skeptics and supporters alike . For one thing , VISTA , or Ventura Intercity Service Transit Authority , provides bus_service linking every city in Ventura County except Ojai for the first time in county history . For another , its $ 1.9-million annual cost is covered in large part by federal funds in a two-year trial program designed to coax residents onto public transportation . Simi Valley City Councilman Bill Davis , who also serves on the Ventura County Transportation Commission , has been an outspoken VISTA critic , arguing that the program will be costly and unpopular . &quot; I ' ve been very skeptical of this ever since the idea was proposed , &quot; Davis said . &quot; But now that it ' s under way , the thing to do is set that aside and let the service speak_for itself. &quot; Mary Travis , spokeswoman for the Transportation Commission , said she is confident that once residents learn about the new bus_service , they will be eager to try it . And once they try it , she said , they will return for its comfort , cost and convenience . The new bus system provides far more connections than the old one , uses luxury coaches with restrooms and costs only $ 1 for a typical adult ticket . Travel_time compares with that on the few old routes -- about an hour , for example , from The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks to the Buenaventura Mall in Ventura . * Travis said the commission is planning to wait several months -- until all_the kinks in_service are ironed_out -- before launching a major advertising_campaign . &quot; There are always last-minute problems to be taken_care of , &quot; Travis said . &quot; All in all I think Day 1 went pretty well , and we ' ll be smoothing things out even more over the next few weeks. &quot; On Tuesday morning , buses were running about 15 minutes behind schedule as drivers figured_out their routes and took extra_time to answer questions from passengers and curious passersby . Halfway through the morning , driver Ted Martinez had answered dozens of questions , but had not picked_up a single passenger on his Oxnard-area route . Yet the veteran bus_driver -- who was hired for the trial period -- seemed unfazed . &quot; I ' ve had lots of people come_on board to ask me what this bus is for , and then say they ' ll be back to ride it , &quot; Martinez said . &quot; I think once people find_out about it , it ' s going_to be very popular. &quot; Martinez ' s effort to spread the word was stymied a bit by a shortage of schedules . Travis said almost all_of the 5 # 000 pre-printed schedules had been scooped_up ahead of time , and schedules from a second printing were not yet available . &quot; We ' ve had much more interest than we expected in the past few weeks , &quot; Travis said . &quot; We should have another batch of schedules out by Friday . By the end of the first year of service , transit officials are hoping to attract between 200 and 400 riders a day on each of VISTA ' s four lines . The hope , said Travis , is that riders will find the 44-passenger coaches -- with their restrooms , luggage_racks , air conditioning and reclining seats -- an easy , comfortable way to get_around . * In Oxnard , South Coast Area Transit rider Idolene Spann , 32 , was pleased to discover that VISTA could get her to her hairdresser at Silver Strand . &quot; that ' s great , &quot; she told the driver . &quot; I am always looking_for easier ways to get around. &quot; At The Oaks mall , VISTA caused confusion as riders accustomed to taking the Interconnect bus to Camarillo and Ventura puzzled_over the new service . They discovered that their old timetables were no longer any good , and that the old green Interconnect buses had been replaced with freshly painted turquoise , sky blue and purple VISTA coaches running_on a different schedule . Planning to visit her daughter in Ventura , Jaye Maria , 78 , had arrived_at the Thousand Oaks mall at 8:30 for the 9:10 Interconnect bus she has taken_for the weekly trip . When the bus did not show , Maria scoured the bus_stop , searching in vain for a new bus schedule or notice of the change . By the time another waiting passenger told Maria that Interconnect had been replaced by VISTA , she had failed to board the 9:05 VISTA bus to Ventura . &quot; It ' s really confusing , &quot; Maria said as she folded_up her old Interconnect schedule and tucked it in her purse . &quot; I ' m glad they ' re expanding the service , but if they ' re going to change the times , they should at least give us a schedule. &quot; The VISTA service consists_of four fixed routes and five Dial-a-Ride routes . On VISTA schedules , the fixed routes are identified as follows . * VISTA Highway 126 from Fillmore to Ventura , including stops at the Buenaventura Mall and the Ventura County Medical_Center . * VISTA Highway 101 connects with VISTA Highway 126 and runs_through Ventura , Oxnard and Camarillo to Thousand Oaks . Stops include Ventura College and the County Government Center in Ventura , the Camarillo Metrolink Station and The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks . * VISTA Central runs between Oxnard and Camarillo , including stops at the Oxnard Transportation Center , Point Mugu Naval Air Center and Camarillo State Hospital . * VISTA East serves Moorpark , Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks in Ventura County , crossing into Los Angeles County with a stop in Agoura Hills . In less-populated areas , residents who live far from bus_routes can call VISTA and arrange to be picked_up at their homes and taken_to the nearest bus_stop . Areas offering this type of service , called Dial-a-Ride , are Santa Paula , Fillmore , Agoura Hills , Oak Park and Westlake Village . * VISTA buses run Mondays through Fridays from about 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Some routes offer hourly service . On others , buses run every half hour . There is no weekend service . Fares on fixed routes are $ 1 for adults , 75 cents for students and 50 cents for senior_citizens . Drivers do not make change . Monthly passes , which can be purchased by phone or at any city_hall in the county , are $ 34 for adults , $ 26 for students and $ 15 for senior_citizens . The passes may be used on VISTA and on city buses throughout the county . Tickets on Dial-a-Ride service cost $ 1.50 for adults , $ 1 for students and 75 cents for senior_citizens . Monthly Dial-a-Ride passes are $ 50 for adults , $ 42 for students and $ 31 for senior_citizens . New VISTA Bus_Service A new countywide bus system began running Tuesday , w ith service to every local city exceptOjai . The new service operates as VISTA , or Ventura Intercity Transit Authority .
