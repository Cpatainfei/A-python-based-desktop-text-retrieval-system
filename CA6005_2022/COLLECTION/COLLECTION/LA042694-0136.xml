   <HEADLINE> POLITICAL MORASS COULD TRAP JAPAN ' S ECONOMIC RECOVERY ; LEADERSHIP : A SPLIT IN THE HOURS-OLD COALITION GOVERNMENT SENDS THE TOKYO STOCK_MARKET LOWER AS INVESTORS LOSE CONFIDENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The political chaos that hit Japan ' s government early today , just 12 hours after the election of new Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata , may derail an expected economic recovery and lead to worsening trade friction with the United States . Much depends , however , on how long the collapse of Hata ' s ruling coalition delays policy-making . The risk of stalemate is also balanced , to some degree , by the possibility that current upheavals will eventually bring a more stable political structure . Reflecting investors ' fears , the Tokyo stock_market ' s Nikkei index fell 158.53 points , or 0.8 % , to 19 # 550.61 in early-morning trading today . Investors &quot; had bought the dream of a return to efficient government led by a stable coalition and a prime_minister who is very pragmatic , &quot; said Jesper Koll , an analyst with S.G. Warburg Securities . &quot; And you are now short somewhere around 60 votes of a majority ( for Hata ' s government ) . Minority governments are inherently unstable . . . . You have the knee-jerk reaction in the stock market. &quot; The coalition that elected Hata split into conservative and leftist factions early today . Angered by the sudden formation of a parliamentary &quot; bargaining group &quot; by several coalition parties , Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama announced at 1:22 a.m. today that his party would leave the government . Murayama said his party would help pass a budget_for fiscal 1994 , which began April 1 , but would no longer be bound by any other policy agreements with other coalition parties . Passage of the budget , which contains some measures designed to stimulate Japan ' s stagnant economy , is considered the most basic prerequisite to encourage renewed economic_growth . But much more active market-opening and economic-stimulus measures will be needed to address trade disputes with the United States in the face of Clinton_Administration threats to impose retaliatory trade sanctions . Japan has pledged to produce by June a program to &quot; substantially &quot; reduce its $ 141-billion global trade surplus , including a $ 60-billion surplus with the United States . New action to stimulate economic_growth , thereby pulling_in more foreign goods through an increase in domestic demand , is a key element of what has been expected . But it is no longer clear that Hata ' s government will have the time or the political strength to focus_on these issues before that deadline . &quot; The promise of clarity over the fiscal stance has been shattered , &quot; Koll said . &quot; You ' ve got a government that is less likely to produce a permanent tax cut , as desired by the U.S._government , before the July Naples summit &quot; of the G-7 major industrial democracies . Koll also noted that pressure for a stronger yen may resume if other steps to cut Japan ' s huge trade surplus are ineffective . A strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive -- and less competitive . A political upheaval had been feared for months , but many had hoped that the election of Hata would usher_in at least a_few months of relative calm . Now the possibilities range from a quick political realignment that still gives Hata a working majority to a dissolution of the lower house of Parliament and general_elections . Jeffrey Young , an analyst at Salomon Bros . Asia Ltd. , said the stock_market did not show a greater reaction to the coalition ' s collapse because &quot; no one expected the left-wing Socialists to stay in the coalition forever. &quot; Another factor , he said , is that political realignment is likely to bring &quot; a more stable system &quot; once another general_election is held , which could be this year or next . * MAIN STORY : A1</TEXT>
