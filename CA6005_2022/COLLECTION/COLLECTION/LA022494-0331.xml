   <TEXT> I started doing drugs again this semester . Mostly bud ( marijuana ) and shrooms ( psychedelic mushrooms ) . They started coming my way again at the end of last semester , right before finals . It ' ll probably take me 10 years to figure_out what happened in the last six months . I was a good student until last semester when I got really , really sick_of school . Before that I was an A and B student . I ' ve taken a lot of honors courses -- still take them . Mostly I party on the weekends . Sometimes during the week -- like last night , which was an &quot; honorary weekend. &quot; I ' ve smoked_out the past three weekends . I ' m not into it as much as before . I ' m sort of bored with it . I don ' t dislike it . It ' s more like , why not use it ? It enhances things . I don ' t mind not fiending on it . It ' s not anything special . I don ' t care that I do_it ; it ' s just something I do . Maybe it ' s a subconscious attempt at suicide . I used to exercise , take good care of myself . I drink lots of coffee . Recently I started smoking cigarettes . I like smoking . It ' s cheaper than smoking cloves . I don ' t want to live to be 1 # 001 years old . Seventy years old would be OK , but if you ask me in 20 years , my answer might be different . I ' m not very good at focusing . * It ' s funny . I used to be involved in &quot; Just Say No &quot; to drugs . I even met Nancy Reagan . In seventh grade , a friend smoked me out . He just had it on him . He was a family friend , a_few years older . He didn ' t know it was my first time . It wasn ' t a big deal . I got a little high . We probably went_to the beach or shopping -- I don ' t remember exactly . At first , I ' d use it once every three or four months . Starting in ninth grade , my friends and I would use it about three out of four weekends . We didn ' t go_to parties ; we ' d just hang_out . We ' d think like &quot; would n ' t it be funny if we smoked in the parking_lot of the Richard Nixon Library. &quot; It was just something we did . It wasn ' t an issue . Somebody would have it , and we ' d use it . Most of the time someone had some on them . Most were my same age and up . They were school friends and camp friends . I would always get_it from friends who would buy_it or get_it from someone ' s back yard . Sometimes we smoke , and sometimes we use it as seasoning -- in omelets , cookies , pizza or whatever . My camp friends I ' ve known since I was little . At camp I didn ' t see people doing_it , but I knew it was around . Now we call it &quot; Camp Sex , Drugs , and Rock ' n ' Roll. &quot; I don ' t usually smoke at school but lots do . Off and on it seems like there are times when half the school is high . I don ' t at school because I can get annoyed with people and use it as an excuse to yell . So I avoid it . I ' ve pretty much quit everything at school . I used to be in debate , some clubs and a junior government program . This semester I ' ve been able to budget my time . I have this kind of general goal to get a Ph.D , but it ' s not in concrete . Last semester sort of wrecked my college plans , though . I ' m dropping plans to try_for an Ivy League school -- maybe I ' ll get a job and go_to junior_college for a year . I seem to have trouble focusing . * My parents are really cool about drugs . They ' d say &quot; we would like you to do them at_home if you ' re going to do them. &quot; They thought if they were preachy , I would be rebellious . My parents smoke pot and I smoke , but not in front of each other . They like to get drunk at night . Sometimes when I come_home my mom asks , &quot; Did you smoke_out tonight ? &quot; I think she has mixed feelings , though . She told me not to do shrooms . I think sometime she had a bad experience on them . You have to be very careful where you get them because they can be poisonous . I only buy from someone I know . We always split what we have between how many people there are . So there might be several each or just a stem and a small piece . They make me really happy . There ' s a certain contentment . Everything ' s in sync . When I come_down , all_of a sudden it ' s like vacation ' s over . * Sometimes we do acid . But I don ' t like the idea that it ' s a chemical . And I don ' t get drunk -- although I really like red_wine . We go_to L.A. a lot , and we go_to lots of clubs . I had a fake ID for awhile , but I lost_it . I don ' t need it now . It ' s easy to get_in -- I know all_the doormen . I hate being underage . I ' d like to move_in with one of my friends who lives_in L.A. I get_along_with my family , but I want to distance myself from them , be_on my own . I ' m not concerned about getting busted . I can find an excuse for every drug I do . I don ' t think I ' ll ever have enough marijuana on me to be a felony . With acid , I ' d just say I ' m crazy . With shrooms , it would be a spiritual thing or whatever . I ' ve had bad experiences twice -- both times with bud . Once there was other stuff in it . Another time the situation got_away from me I was smoking from a bong . It ' s like the smoke got caught in me . I had it in my body too long . I was really sketching . I had a really bad problem with focus . Last week I hallucinated for the first time . It was like a dream where I was awake . I was between asleep and awake , and I stood_up and it was like , who turned the strobe light on ? It was in a controlled situation -- at a party at a friend ' s house , and their parents were gone . I was with people who would help me , who would n ' t leave me there , so it was OK . Lots of people are doing speed now . It ' s the new rising drug . It ' s a habit with a lot of my friends . I don ' t like it though . I got so tired I didn ' t want to move or talk . I have really messed_up sleeping anyway . Something I do want to try is opium . I think I will try . Taking drugs is like smoking or eating sugar . It ' s kind of a philosophy . Today I ' m doing all my homework so I can have unrestricted fun this weekend . I plan to see lots of friends in L.A. , to have a drug-filled weekend . Is drug use among high_school students on the increase ? Yes , according to a survey by the National Institute on Drug_Abuse . The institute has been tracking the question for 19 years . For the past 10 years , the answer had been no . However , in the past year , the survey found that the trend has reversed . Across the country , 50 # 000 junior and senior_high_school students were surveyed about the use of marijuana and other illegal drugs . Among 10th -- graders , the share using marijuana went from 15.2 % in 1992 to 19.2 % in 1993 . The percentage of 12th-graders smoking the drug increased from 21.9 % to 26 % between 1992 and 1993 . The number of seniors who reported using an illegal drug at least once increased from 40.7 % in 1992 to 42.9 in 1993 . The number compares to the peak of 65.6 % reported in 1981 . Has the trend changed in Orange County ? In an individual account of drug use and in interviews with students on high_school campuses , OC High looks_at the issue .</TEXT>
