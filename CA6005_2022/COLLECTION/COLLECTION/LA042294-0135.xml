   <HEADLINE> VACANT LOTS A STARK TRIBUTE TO 2ND ANNIVERSARY OF RIOTS ; AFTERMATH : RECOVERY IS SLOWEST IN SOUTH-CENTRAL . BUT OFFICIALS SAY REBUILDING PROPERTIES IS ONLY A FIRST_STEP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the second anniversary of the Los Angeles riots nears , half the 607 properties in the city that were severely damaged or burned to the ground remain empty , weed-strewn lots . Although the violent upheaval cut a wide swath through the city , a Times analysis shows that rebuilding has progressed far more slowly in South-Central Los Angeles and Pico-Union than in other hard-hit areas . Nowhere is the contrast more striking than along the city ' s most seriously damaged commercial thoroughfare , Vermont Avenue , as it wends its way through Koreatown , Pico-Union and South-Central . North of the Santa Monica Freeway on Vermont , 80 % of the retail buildings and mini-malls that were seriously damaged or gutted by arsonists have been rebuilt . For many property_owners along this stretch , the main problem has been finding renters for their rebuilt storefronts during harsh economic times . South of the freeway , two-thirds of the Vermont properties that suffered serious damage or were destroyed remain forlorn , fenced-off lots . At one corner of the once-thriving intersection of Vermont and Manchester avenues , a single , new Payless Shoe Source store stands sentry over the ghosts of burned-out clothing shops , indoor swap meets and hamburger stands . Community leaders concede that the pace of reconstruction has been painfully slow since the three days of riots that began April 29 , 1992 . &quot; It ' s unfortunate ; it ' s kind of scary , &quot; said Roberto Barragan , director of the Community Financial Resource Center in South-Central . &quot; Watts never fully recovered after the 1965 riots . If something is not done , we ' ll be the Watts of the 1990s. &quot; Landowners and economic analysts say rebuilding efforts have been hampered by financing and insurance woes , fear of crime and renewed civil strife , speculation by absentee landlords , the depressed economy and community groups ' opposition to the return of liquor_stores . &quot; I ' m not satisfied with the progress , &quot; said recently appointed RLA President Linda Griego . &quot; The longer these sites are vacant , the harder for these neighborhoods to be revitalized. &quot; To be sure , significant rebuilding has occurred in some primarily black and Latino neighborhoods of South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles . Moreover , a handful of retail_chains led by Chief Auto Parts and Smart &amp; Final have returned to the inner_city with more outlets than before . Nevertheless , community leaders say that even if all vacant properties were rebuilt immediately , it would only be a first_step toward providing adequate services in chronically impoverished neighborhoods . &quot; It was already a challenge before the upheaval , and it was compounded so significantly as_to be overwhelming at a certain level , &quot; City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said . &quot; It can ' t be built like it was before . It has to be built back better. &quot; In all , about 1 # 100 properties suffered more_than $ 500 million in property damage during the civil unrest that followed the not-guilty verdicts returned in the case of four Los Angeles police_officers in the first beating trial of Rodney G . King . Most of them were mini-malls and free-standing commercial buildings housing Korean American-run retail businesses . Of the nearly 500 structures that suffered less than 25 % damage , most were back in_operation within 18 months , according to data from the city ' s Department of Building and Safety . However , city reports have not been up_to date on the 607 properties -- many of which contained several businesses -- that were damaged at least 25 % or destroyed . To determine the state of rebuilding efforts , a Times reporter surveyed each of these seriously damaged properties . North of the Santa Monica Freeway , 63 % of the properties that were seriously damaged or destroyed have been rebuilt or are under construction , compared to only 44 % south of the freeway . The computer-assisted study also shows that in Koreatown , 82 % have been rebuilt or are under construction ; in Pico-Union , 45 % ; in South-Central Los Angeles , 41 % , and in Southwest Los Angeles , 52 % . This analysis does not include riot-affected areas outside Los Angeles city_limits , where far fewer buildings were severely damaged or destroyed . Although city officials have often pledged special consideration for riot victims , many of them say they have received more hassles than assistance from city code inspectors . Most businessmen , with the exception of major retail_chain operators , said that they received absolutely no help from RLA , the private agency formed as Rebuild Los Angeles at the behest of former Mayor Tom Bradley and Gov . Pete Wilson to oversee revitalization efforts . &quot; This is an example of how it ' s not happening , &quot; said Bill McKee , executive_vice_president of Rexus Properties , the owner of the Taste and Style Plaza at Vermont Avenue and 1st Street . McKee , whose efforts to rebuild were initially slowed by the bankruptcy of his insurance carrier , said that it was not until his two-story building was virtually completed that he was told he would need a separate city water_meter for a new fire sprinkler_system . In mid-January , McKee wrote a $ 10 # 000 check to the city Department of Water and Power to pay_for the installation . But he said the DWP would n ' t accept the check until he submitted lengthy documentation of the sort that he had already presented to city building officials before the project began . &quot; The departments don ' t talk , &quot; McKee said . &quot; It ' s like different countries. &quot; Installation of the meter was delayed for additional weeks as the city Department_of_Transportation and the DWP prepared plans for diverting traffic around a construction trench . Along Vermont Avenue through the heart of Koreatown , many other rebuilt storefronts remain without tenants because of the weak economy . &quot; I ' m looking_for almost anything now , &quot; said Clifford Eng , whose rebuilt structure at 8th Street and Vermont lies vacant . His former tenant , a dry_cleaner , moved_on rather than waiting for the rebuilding . Eng said he spent more_than $ 300 # 000 from a federal Small Business Administration loan and his own finances on the project , only to see rental rates plunge to $ 1.50 a square_foot from a previous high of $ 2.25. Even at the reduced price , he said , &quot; they still won ' t bite. &quot; As trash and graffiti collect at the door , the disillusioned 65-year-old Los Angeles native said he is watching his dreams of a leisurely retirement fly out the window . &quot; The worst mistake I made is that I had many offers to sell the property as is , but I thought for my best advantage , I should have an income to take_care of me until I die. &quot; Not that there have not been some successes north of the Santa Monica Freeway . Pharmacist David Kasen quickly found five new tenants for the storefronts he rebuilt next to his Key Drug Co . at 8th and Vermont . &quot; Every aspect with the city was like a 10-act play , &quot; he said . &quot; But we were booked right away when the building was rebuilt. &quot; Moreover , plans for a 25-story hotel , office and commercial center in the midst of the riot zone received City_Council approval last month despite opposition from homeowners concerned about the center ' s massive bulk . In South-Central Los Angeles , a $ 115-million , 587 # 000-square-foot project such_as Koreatown ' s planned Pacific Trade Center would stick_out like the Empire_State Building . In many South-Central neighborhoods , new strip malls are heralded as major improvements . Chain groceries are few and far between here , office space is negligible and hotels are nonexistent . Absentee landlordism , on the other hand , runs high . County property records of unrebuilt , riot-wrecked lots along Vermont Avenue read like a directory of middle-class and upper-crust Southern California locales -- the property_owners living_in Rancho Palos Verdes , Pacific Palisades , Agoura Hills , Fountain Valley and other communities . Landlords with no ties to a neighborhood have fewer concerns about bringing it up_to snuff , said Jesse Bowman , a South-Central resident who reconstructed his riot-ravaged Jesse ' s TV Sales and Service at 84th Place and Vermont . &quot; Some people use their property as a tax write-off , &quot; Bowman said . &quot; ( Or ) they have other properties so they figure , ' we ' ll hold_tight on this area and see what happens. ' &quot; Steve Needleman , co-owner of several inner-city mini-malls , agrees that some absentee landlords make reconstruction difficult . &quot; Too many people are in the real_estate business that shouldn ' t be , &quot; said Needleman , a partner in family-run Denmarst Ltd . &quot; You ' d be amazed the different groups of names on chunks of land for 20 years or more . . . where it ' s always been in the family . &quot; Unfortunately , there ' s just not enough commitment down there . And it ' s not easy finding insurance or banks that will lend money. &quot; The Denmarst firm , in contrast , concentrates_on inner-city properties , including a mini-mall on Martin_Luther_King Boulevard that suffered more_than $ 3 million in riot damage and lost rent but was among the first rebuilt . The mall is surrounded by a high , black-painted metal fence as a buffer to the gangs and graffiti . &quot; Most of my tenants are now doing 10 % to 20 % better business than before the riots , in part because the competition was burned_out , &quot; Needleman said . &quot; You don ' t make the Taj Mahal but a secure and pleasant environment -- I paint over graffiti within 24 hours , &quot; Some business owners , such_as Young Shim , say they are afraid to return to South-Central . Shim , a Korean American , operated the Right On Drive-In Hamburger stand at 75th Street and Vermont , featuring Chinese food and all-American grilled beef_patties , until it was torched by rioters . His vacant_lot is for_sale , and he has moved the fast-food eatery , since renamed Young China , to East Los Angeles , where he now prepares Chinese food and hamburgers for Latino customers . &quot; Business was better on Vermont , but I don ' t want fights no more , no arguments . So I quit the area , &quot; he said . &quot; A lot of bad_guys used to be over there. &quot; Other merchants , primarily Korean Americans , have hit roadblocks in the form of zoning strictures discouraging the return of small convenience_stores with a high volume of liquor sales . Although the riots destroyed 224 of the 723 liquor outlets in South-Central , only a handful have been allowed back . One is the Trojan Market at 30th Street and Vermont , operated by Don Myung for four years before the riots . Myung said he would never have reopened if it were not for the firm support of his landlord , the Wolf family , a longtime landholder near USC . At public hearings , Myung , armed with petitions of support from customers , faced strong opposition from community groups that complained of drinking and loitering outside the mini-market . To win approval , Myung agreed to hire a security officer and close by 10 nightly . He also offered to sell fresh meat and produce in a community starved for grocery_stores . Government restrictions are a key to improving long-neglected neighborhoods , said Karen Bass , executive_director of the Community Coalition for Substance_Abuse Prevention and Treatment . &quot; The environment that surrounded many of these liquor_stores compromised public safety and quality_of_life , &quot; she said . &quot; If we are going_to rebuild , we shouldn ' t just rebuild but improve . If you have problems , why should you put them back ? &quot; At the same time , such provisions are a burden to grocery owners , Myung said . &quot; I ' ve been in this country for 20 years . When I was 20 , I could work for 20 hours a day . My feet never hurt . Now I ' m over 40 and starting new . I ' m burned_out and I have to start all_over again . My whole life , I ' ll be a victim. &quot; Farther south on Vermont , the commercial district centered at Slauson Avenue is among the emerging success stories of post-riot rebuilding . Most shops and grocery_stores that were looted were quickly restocked and among the businesses that burned_down , a Home Savings branch and a Kentucky Fried Chicken were swiftly rebuilt . In addition , the outer shell of a Taco Bell restaurant has emerged in recent months , a new J.J. Newberry discount_store is_due to rise this fall from the ashes of one that was torched and construction of a new Vons supermarket is scheduled to begin in early 1995 . Marva Smith Battle-Bey , executive_director of the Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corp. , said major chains have a much easier time than small entrepreneurs winning bank financing for rebuilding or new construction . Now , in contrast to after the Watts riots , many larger businesses have decided to remain in the inner-city rather than flee . &quot; We already had generated a commercial hub here , &quot; Battle-Bey said . &quot; Several major places were lost . . . but the larger kind of corporate entities came back. &quot; Twenty-five blocks to the south , the Vermont-Manchester business_district is probably the worst remaining riot eyesore . In recent months , the slew of burnt-out lots has become the focus of a philosophical and political dispute between Rep . Maxine Waters ( D-Los Angeles ) and Ridley-Thomas , two of the city ' s top African American elected officials . Waters envisions remaking the wide thoroughfare into a version of pedestrian-rich Old Town Pasadena or Santa Monica ' s Third Street Promenade , replete with coffee_shops , bookstores , bakeries and theaters . She is also fighting efforts to build a 130-unit , mixed-use affordable housing complex six blocks to the north . Ridley-Thomas , on the other hand , says there is ample room along the strip for a variety of investments . Current plans , he said , include $ 30 million in non-commercial structures consisting_of the affordable housing project , a senior_citizens housing complex , an alternative high_school and a mini-City Hall that would include his district office to replace one set_afire during the riots . One impediment to building a major shopping_center in the area is the fact the lots are owned by several landlords with competing financial interests . Making matters more difficult , landlords such_as Johnny Chu have gone_forward with their own plans . Last year , Chu began rebuilding his men ' s clothing shop . But he ran_out of cash before he could finish . As the second anniversary of the riots looms , the half-built structure sits like a war-scarred bunker in a sea of empty lots . Richard O ' Reilly , Times director of computer analysis , contributed to this story . Rebuilding L.A. Half of the 607 Los Angeles properties severely damaged or destroyed in the 1992 riots have not been rebuilt . The pace of rebuilding has proceeded more quickly north of the Santa Monica Freeway , where 62 % of the properties have been rebuilt or are under construction . South of the freeway , only 44 % have been rebuilt . The map shows properties that have not been rebuilt , and in some cases a single dot represents more_than one building .
