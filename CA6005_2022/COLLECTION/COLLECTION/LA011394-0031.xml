   <TEXT> * In response to &quot; Vitamin Makers Can Swallow New Rules , &quot; editorial , Jan . 4 : While I support the Food and Drug Administration ' s restrictions on the claims that can be made_for dietary supplements , something needs to be done about the Catch-22 inherent in market-driven medicine . The bee-sting therapy you reported about ( Jan . 4 ) is a classic example . It is scientifically unproven and will likely remain that way because scientific testing is almost always connected with intellectual property_rights . If nobody can own it , then the private , for-profit medical system is unlikely to test it . It ' s time that we leap over the ideological_barrier that keeps treatments in the public_domain from undergoing the rigors of scientific testing . It ' s time to spend public funds to test what is most promising . We could support this effort through sales taxes on those that prove effective . Not only would the public health be improved , but by eliminating worthless treatments , there is potential to reduce what we spend on health_care . It ' s also worth noting that the same principles that should make us skeptical of health claims by sellers of food supplements suggest that we restructure the way drugs are tested . Relying_on regulators to protect the public from the inherent conflict_of_interest in allowing corporations to test and monitor the safety and effectiveness of what they own is absurd . The FDA should create the standards and specifications and then put the testing out_to bid to third_parties without a stake in the outcome . This would also allow the public a window into the books of drug_companies so when we grow_into the reality of health_care rationing , excess profits will be_on the table with the really tough choices we need to make . KEN DIAMOND Thousand Palms * There is more involved in the FDA ' s attempts to impose new restrictions on the vitamin industry than honesty in advertising . What is at stake is the freedom to disseminate nutritional and health-related information without interference from an arrogant and backward agency which is generally 20 to 40 years behind in its knowledge of such matters . FDA Commissioner David Kessler and his cronies think that they should be the sole source of health-related information for the United States . The most likely result of increasing their control over the vitamin industry would be higher prices and lower_quality . JOHN A . SCHMIDT Los Angeles</TEXT>
