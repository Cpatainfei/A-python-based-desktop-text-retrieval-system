   <HEADLINE> JOBLESS RATE TO BE UNVEILED TODAY WILL REFLECT REVAMPED SYSTEM ; STATISTICS : NEW FIGURES ARE EXPECTED TO REVEAL A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OUT OF WORK . WOMEN IN PARTICULAR WERE BEING UNDERCOUNTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s overhauled system for gauging unemployment -- a method expected to boost official jobless rates -- will turn_out its first figures today when the Labor_Department releases employment statistics for January . Both government and private economists say the revamped approach will provide a more accurate picture of the U.S. job market . Among its drawbacks , the old format undercounted the number of women in the labor_force and the percentage of women unemployed , economists say . But the new system and other statistical revisions are making their debut amid concerns in the Clinton_Administration that the statistics will be misinterpreted as a reflection of a worsening job market . Government officials estimate that monthly jobless rates in 1993 would have been , on average , more_than half a percentage_point higher if the revised procedures had already been in_effect . For example , the U.S. jobless rate of 6.4 % reported for December probably would have been 6.9 % to 7.0 % under the new approach . Experts note , however , that the gap between the old and new formats will vary from month to month and will not always be half a percentage_point . That will make accurate comparisons between 1994 and previous years difficult if not impossible . Administration officials have made a major effort in recent days to head_off potentially misleading news_reports about the new unemployment numbers . On Thursday , that effort kicked into high_gear , with senior officials calling reporters about the revisions . &quot; We ' re all just calling around to everybody to make_sure they understand the changes , &quot; said Laura Andrea Tyson , the head of the President ' s Council of Economic Advisers . &quot; The new survey will be much more accurate , but obviously those numbers can be used in all sorts of ways , &quot; she said . &quot; We want people to understand it ' s an improvement , a technical correction. &quot; The government has long compiled unemployment figures by surveying about 60 # 000 households nationally every month , including 4 # 550 throughout California and 1 # 888 in Los Angeles County . But now government interviewers will ask more questions , and officials say the questions raised will be more precise and less gender-biased . For example , under the old system , men and women were asked different questions about what they did the week prior to the survey . Men were asked whether they were working or doing something else , while women were asked if they were keeping house or doing something else . That approach toward women &quot; has a Norman Rockwell ring about it , with Mom serving dinner wearing her apron , &quot; said labor economist Audrey Freedman , who heads a committee of business experts that advised the Labor_Department on its revisions . Under the new system , men and women alike are asked simply , &quot; Last week , did you do any work for pay or profit ? &quot; In another change intended to improve accuracy , government interviewers will use computers rather than paper questionnaires . The computers will aid interviewers by providing appropriate follow-up questions . Starting today , the government figures will also reflect revisions that take_into_account population changes identified by the 1990 census . Among other things , those revisions are supposed to remedy the previous undercounting of Latinos in the work_force . California ' s jobless rate is , like the national rate , expected to rise somewhat more_than half a percentage_point as a result of the revisions . The state rate was reported as 8.7 % for December . Also expected to rise are figures for Los Angeles County , which are released at_the_same_time as the national and state numbers , and figures for other California counties , which come_out several weeks later . Even with the changes , private economists say serious weaknesses remain in the data . They say the jobless rate will continue to rise in many cases when the economy is actually improving . That occurs because more people start looking_for work when they sense that their opportunities are_better . Times staff writer David Lauter in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
