   <HEADLINE> REAL_ESTATE Q &amp; A : ONE BAD HOUSE CAN BRING_DOWN VALUE OF WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : Our home is located in a middle-class neighborhood of nicely maintained houses , except for the house across the street from ours . It is a rental house . The owner lives out of town and doesn ' t care what the tenants do as long as they pay the mortgage and property_taxes . The house is a dump . The lawn is never mowed . It looks awful . But no laws are being violated so the city says they can ' t do anything . As we plan to sell our home_in a_few months , do you have any ideas for us as this house will hurt our home ' s salability ? We ' ve tried talking nicely to the tenants but they aren ' t very polite . ANSWER : Unfortunately , just one bad house like the type you describe can drag neighborhood property values down . Any prospective buyer of your home will either not make a purchase offer on your home or will make a low offer to compensate for the eyesore across the street . Several years ago , I had a similar situation . When I was sure the neighbors weren ' t home , one day a friend and I mowed their lawn and made their place look_sharp in front . After that , they did a better job of keeping_up their house . They even painted it . Since they never learned who mowed their lawn , they got the message the neighbors really do care . If readers send_in any other ideas for your problem , I ' ll run them here so we all can learn how to handle your frequently encountered problem . When Is the Right Time to Sell a Home ? Q : You ' re always writing it ' s a great time to buy a home . But when is the right time to sell ? My wife and I have owned our home almost 30 years . We raised our two sons here . But the last few years we ' ve noticed more renters moving_into the neighborhood and the home maintenance seems to be declining . Many of our older neighbors have died . The nearby high_school is a drug depot . Do you think we should sell and get_out ? A : Yes . When you see signs of serious neighborhood decay , that ' s the time to sell your home before it ' s too late while you can still get a fair price . When It ' s All Right to Accept Quitclaim_Deed Q : We are trying to buy our first home but it ' s turning_out to be a nightmare . The problem is not the house . We love its old-world charm and the location couldn ' t be better for us . The sellers are the troublemakers . It is a probate sale . Two sisters and a brother inherited the house . Apparently they hate each other and will only speak_to each other through their three attorneys . Their late mother was very wealthy and each sibling is afraid the estate won ' t be divided equally . But our problem is each one will only sign a quitclaim_deed . Our attorney says this indicates there is a title problem . Should we go_ahead or forget about buying this house ? A : Your situation is not uncommon in probate sales . If it ' s any comfort , divorce sales can be even worse . I ' ve never been able to understand why probate sales are often so difficult . The heirs paid absolutely nothing for the property , yet they act_as if they are entitled to squeeze every dollar out of the property . Also , their cost basis is the market_value on the date of the death so they usually have no profit tax to pay . However , there is nothing wrong with receiving a quitclaim_deed from each heir . Such a deed conveys whatever legal interest they owned . It could be fee_simple absolute . Or , if they had no title at all , a quitclaim might convey nothing . For example , if I give you my quitclaim_deed to the Empire_State Building , you will receive absolutely nothing because I don ' t own that building . Your best protection when receiving a quitclaim_deed is to insist on also obtaining an owner ' s title insurance_policy . If title proves to be defective on the quitclaim_deeds , then you have a claim against the &quot; deep pocket &quot; title insurance_company . Regardless what type of deed you receive , if you also receive an owner ' s title insurance_policy you are well-protected . Consider the After-Tax Mortgage Interest_Rate Q : Our credit is not the best . As you often suggest , before making an offer to buy a home , we needed a mortgage commitment . With our bad credit , we went_to a mortgage broker . She found us a lender who will make us a home loan at 9.5 % fixed interest_rate . I realize this is high . However , in our situation should we take it ? A : A 9.5 % mortgage interest_rate is higher than you could obtain if you had excellent credit . However , consider your after-tax interest_rate . If you are in the 28 % tax_bracket , after considering your income_tax savings , that mortgage will only cost you 6.84 % interest . That is a bargain . Grab it . Don ' t Be Afraid to Borrow Funds for Fixer Q : Each year my wife and I set_aside about $ 25 # 000 for investment . In the past , we bought mutual_funds and common_stocks . We ' re doing OK but nothing spectacular . This year I think we should follow your advice and buy a run-down fixer-upper house . There is one for_sale a_few doors away from our home . But the problem is we will have to borrow almost $ 100 # 000 to finance the purchase of this house . My brother ( a plumber ) and I can easily fix-up this house to make_it worth $ 175 # 000 . Would I be making a big mistake to borrow $ 100 # 000 to make a possible $ 75 # 000 profit ? A : Don ' t be afraid to borrow money to earn money . The situation sounds like a fantastic fixer-upper house . Unless your fix-up costs will be too high , go_for it . Being able to hire tradesmen at reduced prices makes your potential profits all_the more attractive . No Estate_Tax Due on Assets Left to Spouse Q : My husband is dying of emphysema . His doctor estimates he only has a_few weeks left . My problem is our house is held_in my husband ' s name alone . He owned it before we were married 38 years ago but he never added me to the title . It is free and clear . His will leaves everything to me . I estimate the house is worth about $ 250 # 000 . When my husband passes_on , how much estate_tax will I owe on the house ? A : Zero tax . All assets left to a surviving spouse pass free_of federal estate_tax , regardless of the total amount . However , when you die , Uncle_Sam will be waiting to collect estate_tax if your estate is worth more_than $ 600 # 000 .</TEXT>
