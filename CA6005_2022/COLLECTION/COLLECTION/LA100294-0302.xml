   <TEXT> In the gender-bending waters of Lake Apopka , alligators aren ' t quite male . They aren ' t quite female either . They may be both . Or neither . This sexual confusion in the wild , discovered in this steamy Florida swamp last year , is so disturbing to scientists that they keep performing test after test on the scaly reptiles , trying to prove themselves wrong . But the more they look , the more evidence they find . In fact , hardly any young alligators with normal sexuality can be found in this vast lake on the suburban outskirts of Orlando . Elsewhere around the world , the same astonishing phenomenon is turning_up in a menagerie of fish , birds and other wild animals . Testosterone levels have plummeted in some males , while females are supercharged with estrogen . Both sexes sometimes are born with a penis and ovaries , and some males wind_up so gender warped they try to produce eggs . &quot; Everything is really fouled_up . It is indeed real , and it is scary , &quot; said Tim Gross , a University of Florida wildlife endocrinologist on the team that discovered the feminized alligators . &quot; We didn ' t want to believe it , in all honesty. &quot; This is no fluke of Mother Nature , no quirk of evolution . This is probably a legacy of pollution . Wildlife scientists have uncovered persuasive evidence that artificial pesticides and industrial chemicals are infiltrating wombs and eggs , where they send false signals imitating or blocking hormones , which control sexuality . Although the parents are unharmed , their embryo ' s sexual development is disrupted , and some male_offspring are left chemically castrated and females sterile . The potential consequences , if unabated , are almost unthinkable . If males aren ' t male and females aren ' t female , they cannot reproduce , and some outwardly healthy populations could be a generation away from extinction . &quot; Biologically , this is the most significant thing that could impair species and populations across the continent and across the globe , &quot; said Timothy Kubiak , chief of contaminant prevention and investigations at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . So far about 45 chemicals , many of them organochlorine pesticides widely used by farms and households to kill insects and weeds , have mimicked estrogen or inhibited testosterone in laboratory tests and in wild animals . No one knows what this portends for humans -- who often encounter the same chemical residues in their food and water . But because hormones play a role in the human_body identical to other creatures , some scientists are alarmed by the potential of adults passing infertility and other reproductive defects such_as prostate cancer on to their children . The ability of these chemicals , called endocrine disrupters , to leave the parents unharmed but afflict the unborn is so alarming it was not even imagined by author Rachel Carson , who warned of pesticides run amok in her 1962 environmental classic , &quot; Silent Spring. &quot; The most insidious aspect is that the damage easily goes undetected ; the animals look healthy , even to experts . Their bizarre sexuality is discovered only if their internal genitalia are examined or their hormones are tested . Although the threat of environmental hormones is newly recognized , many scientists and government_agencies have given it a rare urgency . Other researchers , however , remain skeptical , saying more evidence is needed to comprehend the scope of the threat and pinpoint the chemicals to blame . Many of the scientists ' findings are so new they have yet to be reviewed by their peers and published . Nonetheless , 21 biologists recently took the unprecedented step of warning in a position paper that &quot; impacts on wildlife and laboratory animals . . . are of such a profound and insidious nature &quot; that swift government action is warranted . In response , the National Academy of Sciences is hastily convening a panel to analyze the findings and guide research . &quot; My fear is that we will find more and more instances of this as we learn what to look_for , &quot; said Ohio University reproductive biologist Brent Palmer , who found male cormorants in the Great Lakes and possibly some male frogs in California producing female egg proteins . &quot; It doesn ' t seem like a_few isolated incidents . The problem keeps snowballing and getting_worse and worse. &quot; Sexual Messengers Estrogen and testosterone are the body ' s sexual messengers , ordering embryos how to grow . When a pregnant animal is exposed to even a minuscule dose of a hormone during the onset of its embryo ' s sexual development , the gender of the offspring can be irreversibly altered , biologists say . In some cases , the father could be passing the defect to his young via his sperm or semen . Because hormones also regulate the embryo ' s immune_system and brain development , the offspring might also be prone to disease and behavioral disorders . &quot; It is the hand-me-down poison , from parents to offspring , &quot; said World Wildlife Fund senior scientist Theo Colborn . Certainly , most populations of animals seem nowhere near collapse . But many animals that are dependent_on heavily polluted waters for their food are suffering serious reproductive defects that have been linked to environmental hormones -- alligators and turtles in Lake Apopka , sea_gulls and some fish off the coast of Southern California , great_blue_herons in British_Columbia , terns in Massachusetts , sturgeon in the Missouri_River , trout in Great Britain , seals_in the_Netherlands , and an array of fish , birds and mammals in the Great Lakes . &quot; When it ' s bad enough to scare us , it ' s bad . And when I sit_down and think_about this , it scares me stiff , &quot; said Charles Facemire , a Fish and Wildlife Service toxicologist in Atlanta who has investigated contaminants for nearly 20 years . Wildlife biologists also have begun studying whether hormone-disrupting chemicals are behind the unexplained declines of some creatures , such_as frogs that are vanishing throughout much of the Western United States , and several endangered and threatened species . Many bald_eagles are failing to reproduce along the Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest ' s Columbia_River . In South Florida , a feud has erupted over whether environmental hormones are to blame for sperm and testicular disorders in the last living 30 to 50 Florida panthers . Across the nation , the severity of pollution has dramatically declined since the 1970s , when die-offs and birth_defects in eagles , pelicans and other animals prompted chemical bans and cleanups . But zoologists suspect that smaller volumes of pesticides and other chemicals originally thought to be benign may be gradually depleting populations . At the Great Lakes , 4 parts per million of polychlorinated biphenyls , or PCBs , will kill an eagle ' s embryo . But a much tinier amount -- perhaps measured in parts per billion -- during a key stage of development might be enough to alter the newborn ' s hormones and leave it sterile , experts say . &quot; If contaminants prevent an animal from reproducing , it will not replace itself , &quot; said zoologist David Crews at University of Texas , Austin , who created hermaphroditic pond turtles by painting eggs with 1 p.p.m. of PCBs . &quot; No normal animal will be born there. &quot; To the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , which regulates chemicals , most worrisome is the abundance of commercially sold substances that seem capable of altering hormones . Among those are the world ' s most widely used herbicides , including alachlor , atrazine and 2 # 4-D . About 170 million pounds of the three herbicides are sprayed each year on U.S. corn , soybeans and other crops , as well as gardens and lawns . Nonylphenols , popular industrial compounds used in plastics and detergents , also were identified . &quot; A lot of these are things you can buy_off the shelf at your local hardware_store , &quot; Facemire said . &quot; We ' re finding more all_the time. &quot; For many of these chemicals , evidence of their ability to tamper with hormones is based on laboratory tests . In wild animals , including Florida alligators , the most compelling proof has been detected in waters polluted with either DDT , a pesticide that blocks testosterone , or PCBs , which imitate estrogen . Used in enormous volumes until they were banned in the United States in the 1970s , these chemicals still pollute hundreds of lakes , streams and coastal waters . Although the impact on animals is documented , the human implications remain highly theoretical . Some reproductive scientists suspect that exposure to environmental hormones could be lowering sperm_counts in men and contributing to sharp increases in prostate and testicular_cancer as well as breast_cancer and endometriosis in women . But veterinary toxicologist Stephen Safe of Texas A &amp; M University is skeptical . Although he acknowledges that the wildlife data in highly polluted waterways is convincing , he is skeptical about inferring any impact on humans or on wildlife in less contaminated areas . People , he says , constantly are barraged with naturally occurring hormones in plants and food with no ill effects . &quot; The environment and organisms , including humans , have tremendous resiliency , &quot; said John McCarthy , vice_president for science and regulatory affairs at the American Crop Protection Assn. , which represents pesticide manufacturers . &quot; It doesn ' t mean you should go_out and bombard them unnecessarily , but it just doesn ' t seem like we ' re going downhill fast and headed toward a crash in a generation or two. &quot; But most scientists look_to animals as sentinels for environmental quality and human health . Holding out for more proof before restricting the chemicals , Kubiak said , &quot; is like waiting for the gangrene that started in your legs to go_up your arms before cutting_off your legs. &quot; Gulls a Tip-Off Few people were paying_attention when the first hint of trouble arose more_than 20 years ago , off the coast of Los Angeles . Sea_gulls on Santa Barbara Island -- a major breeding area -- were showing peculiar sexual behavior . Females were pairing up and sharing nests . Upon closer examination , two Southern California scientists found the reason . They counted as_many as 19 female gulls on the island for every male . Where , they wondered , had all_the males gone ? Because of the skewed gender ratio , the island ' s colony of Western gulls started to collapse , dropping from 3 # 000 pairs in the 1950s to about 700 by the mid-1970s . Avian toxicologist Michael Fry of UC Davis had a theory . He wondered if DDT , notorious for thinning the eggshells and killing the embryos of Southern California pelicans and cormorants , could be to blame for the missing males . Between 1950 and 1970 , about 4 million pounds of the pesticide was pumped into the ocean at the Torrance headquarters of Montrose Chemical Corp . Gulls , unlike pelicans and cormorants , had seemed to be unharmed by DDT . They had no visible birth_defects or other physical disorders . But looking further , Fry was shocked to find many gulls had both testes and ovaries . To confirm his finding , he injected gull eggs from uncontaminated Mono Lake with amounts of DDT comparable_to that found on Santa Barbara Island . In his laboratory , he crafted hermaphroditic birds . &quot; It turned_out that DDT has two very different effects , &quot; Fry said . &quot; In gulls , DDT in eggs caused abnormal development of the males . Chemical neuterization. &quot; Fry ' s work -- published in the journal Science in 1981 -- was the first evidence that environmental contaminants seemed to be feminizing wildlife . While some scientists noted it , most shrugged it off . At the time , common wisdom held that contamination that did not kill or maim animals was harmless . If an animal was alive , it was assumed to be healthy and fertile . Most biologists dismissed Fry ' s discovery as an inexplicable quirk at a uniquely contaminated spot . 3 # 000-Mile Parallels But 3 # 000 miles away , Quebec scientist Glen Fox was intrigued . Fox , a Canadian government wildlife toxicologist , had noticed female herring_gulls sharing nests at Lake_Michigan and Lake_Ontario -- also contaminated with DDT as well as PCBs . He called the California toxicologist for help , and Fry found the identical half-male , half-female phenomenon . Still , their work was met with skepticism . &quot; I had a great difficulty convincing the scientific community that this was a real_thing , &quot; Fry said . Six years later , zoologist Theo Colborn was researching a book on Great Lakes wildlife for a conservation group when she began turning_up studies indicating more_than a dozen birds , fish and mammals were suffering ailments linked to heavy DDT and PCB contamination . The oddest part , she thought , was that problems weren ' t showing_up in adults that grew_up in the 1960s and 1970s , when pollution had peaked . Instead , cormorants born more_than a decade later had twisted , mutated bills , and the only healthy eaglets seemed to have parents that had just migrated to the lakes . Most young trout and other fish had disappeared , except for those that had been stocked . &quot; It was very evident that the problems affecting wildlife around the Great Lakes were not in the adult animals , but their offspring . The offspring that survived were not in very good_shape , &quot; said Colborn , now a senior scientist with the World Wildlife Fund . Tapping into an electronic_database , Colborn pulled_together hundreds of scientific reports . She learned reproductive problems had been detected in almost every developed country since modern chemicals were introduced after World_War_II . But because the reports came from scientists from a wide array of disciplines who rarely see or hear about each other ' s work , no one had noticed the similarities . &quot; By the fall of 1988 , it became very overwhelming that there was something really wrong , &quot; Colborn said . &quot; As I put it all together , I had to do something with it. &quot; Finally , in the summer of 1991 , Colborn convened a meeting of 21 North_American and European zoologists , pathologists , immunologists and other scientists researching the endocrine_systems of humans and animals . After three days , they issued an alarming six-page statement . &quot; Many wildlife populations are already affected by these compounds , &quot; the scientists concluded . &quot; It is urgent to move reproductive effects to the forefront . . . . A major research initiative on humans must be undertaken. &quot; Last December , at a follow-up workshop , the warnings only intensified . Rarely does such a clear consensus emerge in science . But even Fry had assumed the worst of the reproductive damage was over . PCBs and DDT were banned in the 1970s , and contamination levels in fish and wildlife have gradually decreased . Then last year , when he visited New Bedford Harbor -- a bird breeding area near Cape_Cod contaminated with PCBs -- 11 of 15 terns he examined had the same bizarre sex organs he had seen in California a decade earlier . His colleagues have become believers . ' A Big Whodunit ' As the sun rises over Florida ' s Lake Woodruff , three air boats slice_through the tranquil morning mist , their engines roaring like Cessnas rising from a runway . H . Franklin Persival races his craft across the swamp ' s overgrown carpet of water_lilies and pulls_up to a pink nylon banner tied to a cypress . The banner means an alligator nest , spotted from the air , is hidden just offshore . Grabbing a pair of wooden stakes , a wire loop , a magnet and some dental_floss , Persival bounds onto the muddy banks . He deftly sidesteps saw-like blades of marsh grass , fist-sized spiders and mounds of fire_ants , approaching a small clearing , where he finds a five-foot-wide nest woven like a basket from grasses and branches . Quickly , Persival sets_up a crude radio-activated trap atop the nest , hoping the unsuspecting mother alligator will crawl through and get her snout snared . The research is grueling in merciless 98-degree heat , but the six-man team stops its alligator rodeo only long enough to dodge late-afternoon lightning storms . They know they have little time to waste if they want to save the lake ' s alligators from extinction . So many questions , so few answers -- &quot; a big whodunit , &quot; says Persival , a National Biological Survey scientist . Each summer , the team collects eggs , blood and tissue from alligators at both Lake Apopka and Lake Woodruff , a national refuge on the St . Johns River about 50 miles north of Orlando . Woodruff is considered a healthy lake , useful for comparing estrogen and testosterone in its alligators to those from Lake Apopka , one of Florida ' s most contaminated waterways . In 1980 , Tower Chemical Co . spilled a large quantity of Kelthane , a pesticide containing DDT , along Lake Apopka ' s banks . Fertilizers and insecticides routinely flow_off nearby citrus groves and other farms , while little fresh_water is allowed_in . Even Hurricane Andrew took a swipe at Apopka and stirred_up its polluted sediments . &quot; Everything that could happen to a lake has happened to this one , &quot; said University of Florida alligator biologist Ken Rice . Since the early 1980s , alligator births at the lake have dropped fivefold , which prompted the scientific team to begin exploring the cause . Apopka provides an ideal test_case , since the population crash was fairly recent , and the research offers the most convincing proof so far that chemicals still are causing hormonal damage in wildlife . The first breakthrough in finding why alligators are vanishing came_in the fall of 1992 , when endocrinologist Tim Gross , conducting routine sex typing on Apopka ' s turtles , couldn ' t tell males from females . The following March , zoologist Louis Guillette Jr . and Gross examined 6-month-old alligators hatched in their laboratory from eggs from the lake . Males had the high estrogen and low testosterone typical of a female , while females had double the normal estrogen and were laying clutches that , instead of containing the usual one egg , had as_many as seven , all dead . A few months later , the scientists confirmed sexual abnormalities in gators born in the wild -- four of 12 had part-male , part-female genitals . &quot; It sent up signals and flags and fireworks and we knew something was going_on there , &quot; said Guillette , director of the University of Florida ' s reproductive analysis laboratory . &quot; . . . We now know that every single animal that we thought was a female in Lake Apopka had abnormal gonads. &quot; DDE , a metabolite of DDT , was found in the tissues , and the team replicated the link in the laboratory when they painted eggs with minute amounts -- as low as 10 parts per billion -- and the young were born with abnormal hormones . In comparison , not a single alligator at Lake Woodruff had hormonal or sexual defects . Still unconvinced , the researchers returned to both lakes this summer . At night , they kicked_around every imaginable theory , even an unlikely one they jokingly named the &quot; shanty-town girl hypothesis &quot; -- that perhaps Lake Apopka is a magnet for poor , weak female gators . &quot; We wanted to be 100 % sure , &quot; Gross said , &quot; before we opened our big mouths. &quot; In August , they finally published their findings in a scientific journal , warning that their two years of studies &quot; have only begun to address what we believe could be a serious , widespread threat to wildlife populations &quot; and perhaps humans . Vital questions remain . How is the damage physically passed from mother or father to embryo ? How many chemicals are to blame , and at what concentrations ? &quot; What we have is circumstantial_evidence , but if you want to indict a certain chemical , we need a whole_lot more evidence , &quot; Persival said . &quot; Even if we then find what chemical it is , then what do we do about it ? &quot; Gross suspects that &quot; anything that eats anything off that lake potentially can be affected. &quot; But his fears go further . &quot; I think Lake Apopka is just one case . I don ' t think it ' s even the worst case . Those ( chemicals ) have been used worldwide over a lot of environments. &quot; Hundreds of species , from grebes at Southern California ' s Salton Sea to dolphins along the Atlantic Coast , suffer from mysterious ailments that could be linked to environmental hormones . Hoping to determine the national scope , Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt is seeking federal research funds in 1996 . Perhaps future generations are in better shape today because DDT and PCB pollution levels have receded . Or is the worst yet to come because other chemicals that might be creating sexual chaos still are used ? The answers , scientists say , lie hidden in the unborn . &quot; The seeds for the next generation are already planted , &quot; Gross said , &quot; and that is what ' s scary. &quot; NEXT : The implications for humans . Tracing the Damage Many wild animals exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals are suffering severe reproductive problems , including hermaphroditic sex_organs and abnormally low birth_rates . Substantial evidence has been found that contamination has caused disorders in alligators in Florida ' s Lake Apopka , sea_gulls in California ' s Channel Islands , terns in Massachusetts and various fish and birds at the Great Lakes . With some species , such_as Florida panthers that have low sperm_counts , wildlife experts only suspect a link to pollutants . A ) Location : Columbia_River Species affected : Bald eagles B ) Location : Salton Sea Species affected : Egrets , stilts , white-faced ibises , cormorants C ) Location : Channel Islands Species affected : Western gulls D ) Location : Missouri_River Species affected : Pallid sturgeon E ) Location : Tennessee_River Species affected : Osprey F ) Location : Great Lakes Species affected : Bald eagles , herring_gulls , cormorants , perch , otters and trout G ) Location : Lake Apopka , north Florida Species : Turtles , alligators H ) Location : Naples , south Florida Species : Panthers I ) Location : New Bedford , Mass . Species affected : Terns Imitating Hormones Hormone-imitating chemicals in the environment can cause infertility or other reproductive disorders that can devastate wildlife populations for generations . Here is how they work : * Pollutant accumulates : A female animal eats food , such_as fish , contaminated with an environmental pollutant that accumulates in her tissues . * False signal : During an embryo ' s development , the pollutant from the mother invades a reproductive_cell and binds to its receptor , which sends a false signal mimicking estrogen . To the cell , the signal from a fake hormone is indistinguishable from a natural one . * Proteins manufactured : The signal turns_on the manufacture of certain proteins , such_as those that produce egg_yolks . A male fetus could then develop both a penis and ovaries . Such an offspring would be unable to reproduce .</TEXT>
