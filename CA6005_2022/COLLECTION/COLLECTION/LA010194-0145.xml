   <TEXT> &quot; Knight Rider , &quot; move_over . NBC rolls_out its version of demolition derby at 9 p.m. Sunday with a two-hour premiere of &quot; Viper , &quot; a series about yet another crime-fighting sports_car and &quot; the three-man vigilante team behind it. &quot; This clunker ' s regular time_slot , on Channels 4 , 36 and 39 , is 8 p.m. Fridays . Viper is a high-tech , gizmo-glitzed car created by a paraplegic genius named Julian Wilkes ( Dorian Harewood ) who gets_to sit in front of computer_screens saying things like , &quot; I ' m reading armor-panel breakdown. &quot; The best thing about the premiere is that his disability goes unmentioned . The Viper ' s &quot; wheelman &quot; -- or driver , to the unhip -- is Joe Astor ( James McCaffrey ) , a career criminal who surgically has been given amnesia and transformed into a good_guy on the orders of officials of a city being terrorized by a crime syndicate known as the Outfit . Despite his felonious pedigree , Joe is deep , real deep . Before finding the big boss of the Outfit , Joe remarks pensively , he has to find someone else : &quot; Myself. &quot; If that isn ' t funny enough for you , No . 3 in the Viper troika is a laughman , motorpool specialist Frankie Waters ( Joe Nipote ) , who talks like , hey , y ' know , his speech coach is Kirk , the Jere Burns character in NBC ' s late &quot; Dear John. &quot; Tire-squealing clashes between Viper and the Outfit -- which devilishly plans to hijack plague anti-toxin and hold it for ransom -- are mindlessly violent , to say nothing of awesomely inane . The best is when the Outfit ' s low-life operatives peel away from their evil deeds in four matching black sports_cars . That way the cops couldn ' t possibly spot them . Written by series creators Paul De Meo and Danny Bilson ( &quot; The Flash &quot; ) , the script gives Joe a love interest ( Sydney Walsh ) while favoring technology over humanity . Even though the Viper ' s unspectacular special_effects are basically upgraded James Bond or modified Batmobile , the car looks sturdier than the series . HOWARD ROSENBERG</TEXT>
