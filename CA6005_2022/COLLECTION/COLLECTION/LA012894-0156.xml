   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK ; 4.5 AFTERSHOCK BREAKS 4-DAY LULL ; TEMBLOR : OFFICIALS WILL REINSPECT BUILDINGS NEAR THE NORTHERN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY EPICENTER . POST-QUAKE PATTERNS REMAIN NORMAL , SEISMOLOGISTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A magnitude 4.5 aftershock centered two miles west of Granada Hills at 9:19 a.m. Thursday broke a four-day lull of only scattered mild aftershocks in the magnitude 3 range , but scientists reiterated that such moderately strong quakes are to be expected . Seismologist Lucile M . Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey said that the number of aftershocks in any given day has been slowly diminishing since the 6.6 temblor Jan . 17 , but that quite a_few more magnitude 4s and perhaps one more magnitude 5 are likely in coming months . &quot; The aftershocks are following a very normal pattern for Californian earthquakes , &quot; read a statement issued Thursday afternoon by four institutions that are actively studying the geology of the Northridge quake -- Caltech , the U.S. Geological Survey , the Southern California Earthquake Center at USC and the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory . &quot; If the aftershocks continue at this rate , the probability of a magnitude 5 aftershock in the next week is about one in five , &quot; the statement read . &quot; We expect one or two more aftershocks of magnitude 4.5 or greater in the next week. &quot; Jones noted that a number of historic earthquakes in California have been followed by a &quot; large late aftershock &quot; that has done some damage and injury . For instance , the magnitude 7.7 Tehachapi earthquake of July 21 , 1952 , that killed 12 people was followed a month later by a magnitude 5.8 temblor centered close to Bakersfield that killed two more . In the 1933 Long_Beach 6.3 earthquake , a damaging 5.4 aftershock came seven months after the main shock , and in the 1983 Coalinga 6.5 earthquake , a 6.0 aftershock came three months later near the town of Avenal . The Avenal earthquake was larger in_relation_to the Coalinga main shock than is usually the case with aftershocks . Jones reported this week that historically , &quot; the difference in magnitude between the main shock and largest aftershock can range from 0.1 to 3 or more , but averages 1.2. &quot; This means that the largest average aftershock to have been expected from the 6.6 Northridge temblor would have been 5.4. But that magnitude has already been exceeded , by the 5.6 shock that occurred on the afternoon of the quake . Thursday morning ' s aftershock , which authorities said would prompt some reinspection of buildings for damage in the area near its north Valley epicenter , was the 36th between magnitude 4.0 and 4.9 since the Northridge earthquake . During the same period , there have been two aftershocks between 5.0 and 5.6 and more_than 300 between 3.0 and 3.9. Altogether there have been more_than 3 # 150 aftershocks , still a long way from the 50 # 000 that have accumulated in the 19 months since the major Landers earthquake of June 28 , 1992 . A quake must reach approximately magnitude 2.5 before most people feel it in their ordinary activities , and the vast majority of shocks are less than that . But aftershocks , regardless of size , are studied closely by earthquake experts because they often delineate as clearly as anything the extent of the area directly involved in the earthquake , and by determining their relative depth , scientists can calculate the fault plane of the quake . Aftershocks also can demonstrate movement that has been triggered on other faults . Scientists have put the depth of the origin of the Northridge main shock at about 11 miles . By locating the aftershocks , they believe that the unnamed thrust_fault involved extends up , east and west from this point . &quot; It is a circular_plane , tilted at an angle of about 40 degrees from the earth ' s surface , &quot; the researchers said in a statement . &quot; Its deepest point is at the main shock focus and its shallowest point is near the Santa Clarita Valley . . . . ( But ) we think the main shock fault does not extend up_to the surface. &quot; Signs of surface disturbance that have been found in Granada Hills , along the Santa Susana range and in Potrero Canyon west of Castaic Junction probably represent movements on other faults , some of the scientists say . In a new observation Thursday , the four institutions added that they believe that the Northridge earthquake &quot; occurred within the system of faults under the northern Los Angeles Basin that was recognized after the Whittier Narrows earthquake of 1987 . We think this band of buried faults extends across the northern side of the basin and under the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys , &quot; they said . Times staff writer Bettina Boxall contributed to this story . Adding Aftershocks The magnitude 4.5 aftershock Thursday morning merely added_to the list of seismic activity since the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake . Some aftershock totals : * 2 aftershocks magnitude 5.0-5.6 * 36 aftershocks magnitude 4.0-4.9 * 302 aftershocks magnitude 3.0-3.9 * 3 # 150 total aftershocks</TEXT>
