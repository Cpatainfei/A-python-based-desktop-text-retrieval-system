   <HEADLINE> CHRISTOPHER PREDICTS U.N. APPROVAL OF N . KOREAN SANCTIONS ; DIPLOMACY : HE VOICES OPTIMISM DESPITE RELUCTANCE BY CHINA AND JAPAN ABOUT IMPOSING ECONOMIC RESTRAINTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite signals of reluctance from China and Japan about imposing economic sanctions on North_Korea , U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher predicted Thursday that such punitive measures would win approval if they come_before the United Nations . &quot; We ' re proceeding firmly and deliberately to seek sanctions in the U.N. Security_Council , and I think they can be achieved , &quot; he said at a news_conference after a meeting of North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization foreign_ministers here . The official American optimism followed China ' s rebuff Thursday of a South_Korean appeal for sanctions against Pyongyang for failing to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities . The appeal came_after talks between South_Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Beijing . Although the officials agreed that the Korean_Peninsula should be nuclear-free , the Chinese have insisted that sanctions would lead to an unwanted escalation of tensions in the region . &quot; We do not agree on sanctions , for sanctions would only serve to push the opposing sides into confrontation with one another and result in a situation that no one would like to see , &quot; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said . The Chinese Foreign Ministry urged patience and further negotiations -- outside the United Nations -- among key players . &quot; We are not in favor of the involvement of the U.N. Security_Council in this issue , &quot; Shen said . But Beijing did not indicate whether it was prepared to use its U.N. veto if a resolution is formally put to a vote . In Istanbul , Christopher said he drew a distinction between what the Chinese prefer and what they would do_in the event of a U.N. sanctions vote , indicating that he thought they might abstain if other Security_Council members supported it . &quot; There is more here than exists on the surface of some of the statements being made , &quot; he said . But in one of many indications of the fragile , fluid state of diplomacy on the North_Korean controversy , Assistant Secretary_of_State Robert L . Gallucci sounded less optimistic in testimony Thursday on Capitol_Hill . Despite a series of consultations with key players in the crisis this week , he conceded that the United States could not predict how China would vote on a U.N. economic embargo . North_Korea also upped the ante Thursday by threatening Japan with war , if Tokyo supported sanctions . This was North_Korea ' s apparent attempt to divide key players in the dispute . North_Korea would regard Japanese support &quot; as a declaration of war and Japan would be unable to evade a deserving punishment , &quot; the official Korean Central News_Agency warned . Although North_Korea has generally threatened war in the event an international sanctions resolution is passed , Pyongyang has not threatened Japan directly or specifically . Some Japanese cities are within reach of North_Korean missiles , and Tokyo has expressed concern about possible terrorist actions by Koreans living_in Japan . Remittances from Korean workers in Japan provide hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign_exchange for North_Korea , making Japanese support for sanctions a potentially devastating blow for Pyongyang ' s already fragile economy . North_Korea is trying to rattle Japan , which has also been resisting American pressure to totally cut_off Pyongyang , U.S. officials suggested Thursday . But on the possibility of Japan wavering , Christopher said , &quot; I have no question but that the Japanese understand the importance of sanctions , just as we do. &quot; In South_Korea on Thursday , President Kim Young Sam talked by telephone to Japanese Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata . Afterward , a Korean presidential spokesman said , &quot; Japan believes the nuclear conflict should be resolved through negotiations but realizes that because of North_Korea ' s attitude , U.N. sanctions are inevitable. &quot; Hata is expected to travel_to South_Korea and possibly China soon for further talks on the crisis . The developments came as former President Jimmy_Carter announced that he and his wife , Rosalynn , will visit Pyongyang next week for discussions with the North_Korean government , ostensibly as private citizens with &quot; no official status relating to the U.S. government. &quot; The White_House said Thursday that Carter had been briefed by the White_House on the situation involving North_Korea , but declined to say whether he had been asked to carry_out any sort of informal mission . Former Presidents frequently are used in such a capacity . Meanwhile , the International Atomic Energy Agency moved Thursday to suspend technical aid to North_Korea in light of recent actions that it charged widened Pyongyang ' s violations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . After a recommendation from 18 of 35 member countries on the IAEA board of governors , the U.N. nuclear regulatory group is expected to vote formally today . Suspension would jeopardize the $ 250 # 000 that North_Korea receives annually in technical aid and support for its civilian nuclear program . In his testimony , Gallucci said a Russian proposal for an international conference on nuclear arms on the Korean_Peninsula might be &quot; useful &quot; in resolving the present crisis . But the role and sequence of such a session is still under debate by major parties involved in the_matter , said a Western diplomat at the United Nations . The Clinton_Administration has not yet endorsed the proposal . This weekend , critical negotiations are expected to take_place behind the scenes after Christopher returns from a 10-day trip to Britain , France and Turkey . Western diplomats said they expect the talks to iron_out an agreement on a framework for action at the United Nations to move the crisis beyond deliberations . In Japan , Hata on Thursday told opposition Socialist_Party members leaving today for a Pyongyang visit that Japan and South_Korea would cooperate to raise living standards in North_Korea , if Pyongyang accepts international inspection of its nuclear facilities . Times staff writer Sam Jameson in Tokyo contributed to this report .</TEXT>
