   <HEADLINE> SENATE VOTES SHOW SPLIT ON ARMS TO BOSNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In contradictory votes underscoring the extent to which lawmakers remain divided over the bitter war raging in the Balkans , the Senate narrowly passed legislation on Thursday that calls_for lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina . The vote showed the growing discontent with the Clinton_Administration ' s handling of the Bosnian crisis : 13 Democrats sided with the Republican initiative as the senators voted 50 to 49 for an amendment ordering the President to unilaterally lift the U.N.-imposed embargo , even if North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization allies do not agree . But the &quot; strong message &quot; that disaffected Democrats said they wanted to send to Clinton was a muddled one -- senators , just before , had voted by an identical 50-49 margin to endorse the President ' s position that the embargo should only be lifted with the consent of the allies . In the end , after weeks of closed-door negotiations and hours of often impassioned floor debate , two things were made clear by the Senate action , said a senior Senate foreign_policy aide : &quot; First , it is apparent that nobody likes what Clinton is doing when it comes_to Bosnia . But second , it is just as clear that there is no consensus on what he ought to be doing. &quot; The bottom_line , said Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) , is that &quot; there is not going_to be any unilateral action . . . to lift the embargo &quot; to give the poorly armed Bosnian Muslims a chance to obtain the weapons they need to repel Bosnian Serb attacks . Noting that the legislation to which the amendments were attached is now flawed by conflicting directives , Mitchell said he sees &quot; no chance of it becoming law. &quot; Before it can be sent to the President ' s desk , the measure also would have to win approval in the House , where Democratic leaders are expected to keep it from reaching the floor . Ever since the siege of Sarajevo in January , the Senate has been wrestling with American policy options in the Balkans . An increasing number of Democrats have joined Republicans in voicing dissatisfaction with an Administration policy they characterize as vacillating and vague . Although the senators are nearly unanimous in wanting to see the embargo lifted , there is no consensus on whether it should be ended unilaterally or , as Clinton maintains , only if allied nations with peacekeeping troops on the ground in Bosnia give their consent . The latest debate was triggered by an amendment sponsored by Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) to lift the embargo unilaterally . Fearing it would pass , Mitchell spent weeks trying to craft a substitute strong enough to keep disaffected Democrats in_line without directly challenging the President . The alternative he finally offered directs Clinton to seek the allies ' consent for ending the embargo and to report back to Congress on the possibility of lifting it unilaterally if they refuse . As much as the lawmakers want to lift the embargo , the United States cannot do so unilaterally without inviting other countries to disregard other sanctions that Washington wants enforced , Mitchell said in arguing against Dole ' s amendment . &quot; We can ' t take the position that others must participate in multilateral actions but the United States alone can pick and choose , &quot; he said . &quot; We can ' t have it both ways. &quot; But having it both ways was exactly what the Senate sought to do , as it approved the rival GOP and Democratic leadership alternatives by identical margins . Further mixing the message , eight senators , all_of them Democrats , voted for both amendments . One of them , Sen . Richard H . Bryan ( D-Nev. ) , said he did so because he feared that Dole ' s amendment would lose and he thought that voting for Mitchell ' s amendment first would at least allow him to go_on record as favoring an end to the embargo . Others , like Sen . Paul Simon ( D-Ill. ) , said they voted with Dole because they wanted to send the Administration a &quot; strong message &quot; that its Bosnia policy has been &quot; anemic &quot; and that it &quot; must do better &quot; in the future . Sen . John W . Warner ( R-Va. ) , who supports the Administration on Bosnia , said the mixed message the Senate ended_up sending was anything but strong . &quot; It shows you the ineptitude of the United States Senate at times in giving direction on foreign_policy , &quot; he said . Reaction from America ' s allies was quick . Alain Juppe , the_French foreign_minister who was in Washington to confer_with Administration policy-makers , warned that , if the United States were to lift the embargo unilaterally , it would end U.N. ground action and prompt a resumption of fighting in Bosnia &quot; It seems almost to me the worst solution , &quot; Juppe told reporters . At the same time , Juppe dismissed reports that Washington and Paris were split over what should be done_in Bosnia , contending that the two governments were essentially in_agreement on broad policy and &quot; both think the time has come for a political settlement. &quot; He also warned that European governments might not be able politically to keep ground troops in the region much longer . &quot; The time will come when the_French public_opinion . . . will ask , ' What are we doing_in Bosnia ? ' &quot; he said -- much as Americans did_in Somalia . At the United Nations , a report from Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged the Security_Council on Thursday to make_it clear in new resolutions that U.N. peacekeepers could play only a limited role in protecting Bosnian &quot; safe havens. &quot; Boutros-Ghali ' s report betrayed his frustration over what he said is the attempt by Bosnian Muslims to use the U.N.-designated safe areas as havens in which to regroup and mount attacks against Bosnian Serbs . He also sees a worldwide impression that U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia were mainly assigned to repel Serbian aggression against the Muslims . The peacekeeping force , he insisted , &quot; is neither structured nor equipped for combat and has never had sufficient resources , even with air support , to defend the safe areas against a deliberate attack or to hold ground. &quot; Throughout Bosnia , he noted , the United Nations has &quot; found itself in a situation where many safe areas were not safe , where their existence appeared to thwart only one army in the conflict , thus jeopardizing ( the United Nations ' ) impartiality , and where ( the U.N. ) role needed to be adequately defined in a manner that would be compatible with the rest of its mandate &quot; -- protecting humanitarian relief and guiding the parties to a negotiated settlement . He proposed that the council redefine the safe areas to make_it clear the intent &quot; is primarily to protect people and not to defend territory and that ( the United Nations ' ) protection of these areas is not intended to make_it a party to the conflict. &quot; He also proposed that the council clearly set_down realistic boundaries for the safe areas to ensure peacekeepers are not assigned to protect an area that is too_large for them to do so . On Thursday , battlefronts across Bosnia heated_up ahead of a key meeting of frustrated foreign states trying to stop two years of bloodshed . The Associated Press reported that a U.N. military observer was killed and another seriously wounded when they came under_fire near Sarajevo , the capital . In another reported violation of the 3-month-old truce in Sarajevo , a Bosnian Serb soldier was fatally shot near Vrbanja bridge , linking Serbian- and government-held parts of the city . There was no U.N. confirmation of the report by the Bosnian Serb SRNA news_agency . In northern Bosnia on Wednesday evening , mortar_fire cut electricity to Serbian-held Brcko , in an east-west corridor vital to Serbian supply_lines . Both Bosnian Serb and government media reported shelling in the area Thursday . Reported military buildups by both sides around Brcko have fed speculation about an impending major battle . Times staff writers Art Pine in Washington and Stanley Meisler at the United Nations contributed to this report .</TEXT>
