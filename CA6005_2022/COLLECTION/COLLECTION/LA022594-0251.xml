   <HEADLINE> TEEN-AGERS FACE SPECIAL SMOKING RISK , REPORT WARNS ; HEALTH : SURGEON_GENERAL SAYS TOBACCO USE AMONG YOUTHS IS STILL PREVALENT . THE INDUSTRY ' S ADVERTISING_CAMPAIGNS ARE SINGLED_OUT FOR BLAME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cigarette smoking -- of all addictive behaviors -- is the one most likely to take_hold during adolescence and almost all adult smokers took their first drag before they were graduated from high_school , the surgeon_general ' s annual report on smoking said Thursday . Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders unveiled the report with a warning to the nation ' s young people : &quot; Tobacco addicts and it kills. &quot; &quot; We can no longer discuss smoking as an adult habit -- because today , tobacco use , without question , is an adolescent tragedy , &quot; she added at a news_conference . The report , which focused_on cigarette smoking and youth , is part of a series of documents released since the landmark 1964 report that first established cigarette smoking as a significant danger to health . Cigarette smoking is a major contributor to heart_disease -- the leading killer of adults in the United States -- and stroke , as well as a chief cause of certain cancers and respiratory ailments . Federal health officials blame smoking for an estimated 434 # 000 deaths a year . Although tobacco use declined among high_school seniors in the 1970s , it remained steady in the 1980s and is now on the rise again at all grade levels , according to a survey released recently by the federal_government . Cigarettes and alcohol remain the most widely abused substances among the nation ' s youth , the survey said . Now , more_than 3 million adolescents smoke cigarettes and more_than 1 million adolescent males use smokeless tobacco , the surgeon_general ' s report said . &quot; Despite three decades of explicit health warnings , large_numbers of young people continue to take_up tobacco , &quot; the report said . One out of every three adolescents in the United States uses tobacco by age 18 , it added . The report blamed the tobacco_industry ' s $ 4-billion-a-year cigarette advertising and promotional campaign for contributing to teen-age smoking , but said that disincentives to smoking -- such_as tobacco tax increases and school-based tobacco-use prevention programs -- are effective . Advertising &quot; appears to increase young people ' s risk of smoking by affecting their perceptions of the pervasiveness , image and function of smoking , &quot; the report said . Since cigarette ads were banned from the broadcast media , &quot; there has been a continuing shift from advertising to promotion , &quot; such_as the sponsoring of sports events , the report said . &quot; Clearly , young people are being indoctrinated with tobacco promotion at a susceptible time in their lives , &quot; it said . &quot; Young people face enormous pressures to smoke. &quot; School-based programs that identify social influences on smoking and provide skills to resist those influences have demonstrated &quot; consistent and significant reductions in adolescent smoking prevalence , &quot; the report said . Also , &quot; a crucial element of prevention is access , &quot; the report added . &quot; Adolescents should not be able to purchase tobacco products in their communities. &quot; Elders took special aim at the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . for its controversial &quot; Joe Camel &quot; ads , and she challenged the Federal Trade Commission to act_on petitions against the advertising_campaign . Peggy Carter , a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds , said a recent study done for the company indicated that Joe Camel was not influencing the nation ' s children to smoke . &quot; It showed that Joe Camel is not the most memorable advertising character with youth -- and , in fact , the strong negative reaction to the product he represents suggests that the campaign is not causing youth to start smoking , &quot; she said . While condemning cigarette advertising for influencing young people to smoke , Elders did not call_for a total advertising ban . However , she said &quot; we shouldn ' t advertise something we know to be a poison and a killer. &quot; She also called_for higher cigarette taxes , a move already proposed by President Clinton to help finance his health_care reform plan . Officials from the tobacco_industry said they agreed with much of the report , including its basic message -- that young people should be prevented from smoking -- but took_issue with some of the specifics , particularly the charge that advertising and promotion are largely responsible_for the problem . &quot; There ' s a lot of room for agreement , &quot; said Brennan Dawson , a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute . &quot; Industry has been a leader in developing and marketing ( materials ) for parents and working with the school_systems to discourage young people from smoking. &quot; Nevertheless , she called it &quot; misguided &quot; to attack advertising and promotion as the main villains in enticing young people to smoke . &quot; Advertising is not the factor that gets young people to smoke , &quot; she said . &quot; The ( report ) talks_about ads creating a positive environment for smoking . The surveys all show that young people are very aware of the risks. &quot; The American Cancer Society , the American Heart Assn . and the American Lung Assn . issued a joint statement supporting the report ' s conclusions and Elders ' comments , saying : &quot; We need to reduce conditions that contribute to tobacco use and help young people turn their backs on tobacco. &quot; In conjunction with the report , the Department of Health and Human Services also released a new surgeon_general ' s report for children . The magazine-style document is geared for students in sixth grade -- where smoking often starts .</TEXT>
