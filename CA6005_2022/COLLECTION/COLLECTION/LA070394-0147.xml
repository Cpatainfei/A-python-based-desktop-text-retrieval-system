   <HEADLINE> DWP OFFICIAL SEEKS TO CLEAR AIR ON POLLUTION IMPACTS FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * I was disturbed by sections of a recent article and cartoon ( &quot; State Taking Wrong Road in Drive for Electric Vehicles , &quot; June 12 ) , which inaccurately said that air emissions from power_plants will negate the benefits of the commercial introduction of zero-emission electric vehicles . In California , electric vehicles are 97 % less polluting than conventional gasoline-powered cars , even accounting_for air emissions from power_plants that generate the electricity to recharge the batteries.This number is based on data collected by the California Air Resources Board and other air quality agencies . Beyond that , it is important to note that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ' s four power_plants in the Los Angeles Basin , including one in Sun Valley , produce less than one-tenth of 1 % of the region ' s air_pollution . From the late 1960s through the early 1990s , the DWP reduced emissions of oxides of nitrogen ( a primary precursor to smog ) from these plants by 90 % , and another 90 % reduction is planned by the year 2000 . We must attack the primary air_pollution culprits in our region , which are mobile sources , including the 9 million motor_vehicles driven by some 13 million people . These sources account_for two-thirds of our air_pollution . Given these facts , it becomes clear that electric vehicles will play a very significant role in putting Los Angeles on_the_road to becoming a cleaner , healthier environment in which to live and a viable place to do business in the future .
