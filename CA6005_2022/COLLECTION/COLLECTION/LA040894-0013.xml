   <HEADLINE> ' HOLOCAUST ' : KEEPING THE TRUTH ALIVE -- AGAIN ; TELEVISION : WELL BEFORE ' SCHINDLER ' S LIST , ' A MINISERIES AWAKENED MILLIONS TO THE HORROR OF NAZI GENOCIDE . IT RETURNS TO AMERICAN AIRWAVES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 15 YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 15 years before &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; another Hollywood film awakened perhaps as_many as 400 million TV viewers around the world to the horror of Nazi genocide during World_War_II , changed laws in Germany and helped pave the way for Steven Spielberg ' s acclaimed film . &quot; Holocaust , &quot; an eight-hour miniseries first broadcast on NBC in the spring of 1978 and then rerun the following year , was &quot; groundbreaking , &quot; according to those involved in making_it , in that it was the first mass-media dramatization about the entirety of the Holocaust -- and certainly the most seen . In commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Week , cable ' s Family Channel will present the mini-series for the first time on American television since 1979 , Sunday through Thursday at 8 p.m. &quot; There ' s no question that the impact of ' Holocaust ' was unlike anything in terms of bringing knowledge and issues of history to a great mass of people , &quot; said Gerald Green , the novelist who researched and wrote the screenplay , which told the story of two fictional German families -- one Jewish , one headed by a rising star in the Nazi_Party -- and the betrayal , separation , madness and fear that befell them . &quot; Back then you had Christian neighbors coming_out of houses saying , ' Did you know this was happening ? ' Holocaust was just a word to many of these people , &quot; Green said . &quot; I ' m not taking all_the credit . There had been many documentaries on the Holocaust that were excellent and in many cases got closer to the truth than any fictitious drama could . But none were seen by the amount of people who saw this show . This reached and made an impression on the average American sitting in farmhouses in Duluth , Minn. &quot; * Just as &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; dominated this year ' s Oscars , &quot; Holocaust &quot; swept the Emmys , winning eight , including outstanding limited series . Meryl Streep , in one of her first major roles , won for outstanding lead actress in a limited series , Michael Moriarty nabbed the outstanding lead actor Emmy , Blanche Baker was honored as outstanding supporting actress , Marvin Chomsky won for his directing and Green for his script . The most dramatic and perhaps crucial measure of the film ' s impact is that it prompted the German legislature to repeal the statute of limitations on Nazi war_crimes . &quot; There were a bunch of Nazi criminals hiding in South_America who were planning the very next year to come_home to joyful reunions , &quot; Chomsky recalled . &quot; The show reached 19 million or 20 million households in Germany alone . ' Schindler ' s List ' probably will be seen by no more_than 2 million people there . And it prompted countless and interminable conversations and discussions and historical analysis , and it got kids in Germany finally asking their fathers , ' What did you do_in the war ? ' &quot; &quot; I want it on my tombstone that I was partially responsible_for changing the laws of West Germany and permitting the prosecution of more Nazi war_criminals , &quot; said Green , who also wrote the novel &quot; The Last Angry Man &quot; among other books , films and TV_shows . &quot; that ' s not a bad accomplishment. &quot; James Woods , who starred in &quot; Holocaust &quot; as a Jewish artist married to Streep ' s character , said that when he was in Germany making the film back in 1977 , he read a poll that indicated that 85 % of German 12-year-olds did not even know who Adolf Hitler was . &quot; Holocaust , &quot; he said , changed that . &quot; I ' ve done a lot of true-life stories in my life , but this was the most remarkable , &quot; Woods said . &quot; It showed that 6 million Jews were murdered , but it also didn ' t forget that another 6 million Gypsies and homosexuals and Catholics and communists and political_dissidents died in the camps too . Through this family , it depicted all aspects of the Holocaust , from Kristalnacht to the Warsaw ghetto to the camps to the mass shooting executions at Babi Yar . It presented a lot of factual truths that weren ' t shown in ' Schindler ' s List. ' &quot; While remembrance of the Holocaust has already been boosted inordinately by Spielberg ' s film , Chomsky is &quot; quite pleased &quot; that the miniseries will be available again in the United States . * &quot; Spielberg ' s picture certainly opened some people ' s eyes , and seeing this may open them wider or give them a new perspective or understanding , &quot; he said . &quot; We teach precious little in the United States about what goes_on or what happened anywhere else , and just like we teach the Bible stories over and over to each new generation , the Holocaust should be recounted repeatedly in the lexicon of man ' s inhumanity to man. &quot; Green agreed . &quot; Since we told the story to the world , the revisionists -- the ones who want to pretend it never happened -- had to come_out and work hard to spread their lies and slander , and that is still going_on , &quot; he said . &quot; So I don ' t think you can ever have too many movies or books or articles about this. &quot; Woods said he has encountered some of these revisionists first-hand . During an interview , an American journalist asked Woods where they got the story about millions of people being thrown into labor camps and killed . &quot; This supposedly was an educated , professional guy , and he thought it was some remarkably interesting flight of fancy , &quot; Woods said . &quot; You really can ' t know the joy of having participated in such a project that keeps truth alive and maybe prods people into understanding or looking more deeply into all human-rights abuses that occur , sadly , all_the rest of our lives . &quot; I mean , this is just 15 short years after millions and millions of people saw our miniseries and already they had to be reminded by ' Schindler ' s List. ' In just 15 years it was being forgotten , and I dread to say that 15 years from now , it might be forgotten again. &quot;</TEXT>
