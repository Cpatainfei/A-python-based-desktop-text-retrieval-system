   <HEADLINE> O.C. OFFICER DIES AFTER CRASH ; DRIVER ARRESTED ; ACCIDENT : POLICE SAY SUSPECT WAS DRUNK WHEN HE RAN A RED_LIGHT AT 60 M.P.H. AND COLLIDED WITH PATROL_CAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A police_officer on routine patrol was fatally injured when a drunk-driving suspect ran a red_light and smashed into his cruiser , demolishing it and pinning the officer inside , authorities said Tuesday . Officer Michael Osornio , 26 , a former contractor who joined the La Habra Police_Department 14 months ago and was recently engaged to be married , succumbed to internal injuries an hour after the collision at 9:22 p.m. Monday . Osornio became the first officer on the city ' s police_force to be killed on_duty . Thirty-two officers have been killed on_duty in Orange County since 1912 . &quot; I ' m proud to have known him . Being a policeman was one of his dreams , &quot; said Robert Skipper , father of Osornio ' s fiancee , Chartina Skipper . &quot; He wanted to be a police_officer so_much , he would have done_it for nothing. &quot; Police arrested Marco Villegas Ramirez , 51 , of La Mirada on suspicion of murder , Capt . Terry Rammell said . Ramirez , who was in stable condition at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana with facial injuries , was found to have a blood-alcohol level of 0.18 % -- more_than twice the legal limit of 0.08 , Rammell said . The car that struck and killed Osornio was traveling at least 60 m.p.h. and weaving along Beach Boulevard , prompting a witness to telephone police even as the collision occurred , Rammell said . Police said witnesses reported seeing the vehicle bouncing off the curb as it sped north on Beach before colliding_with Osornio ' s westbound cruiser at the intersection of Beach and La Habra Boulevard , Rammell said . Ramirez ' s co-workers described him as a quiet , fatherly figure who never joined colleagues for drinks after work and often warned them against drinking and driving . &quot; At Thanksgiving and Christmas get-togethers , he never drank_in excess . I only saw him drink two beers at the most , &quot; said Marc Maligalig , a co-worker at Lindblade Metalworks Inc. in La Mirada . &quot; All of us are pretty devastated . But I feel worse for the family of the police officer. &quot; Police who received calls reporting the crash did not know at first that it involved one of_their_own . A dispatcher radioed Osornio to send him to the scene , but he did not respond , said police spokeswoman Cindy Knapp . Officer Kari Armstrong , the second officer sent to the accident , arrived to find her injured colleague . &quot; She said , ' Mike , come_on , wake_up , wake up. ' And the guy didn ' t respond or anything , &quot; said Victorio Toscano , a clerk at a nearby auto parts store who ran to the scene of the collision . On Tuesday , the spot had been turned_into a memorial site as fellow officers and city residents stopped to place flowers and pay respects_to Osornio , described as a hard-working cop gifted with keen instincts and a wry wit . A 1986 graduate of Walnut High_School in Walnut , Osornio made_good on a longtime dream to become a police_officer when he put himself through the police_academy at Golden West College last year and was hired soon afterward for the 70-member force in La Habra . Around the station_house , he was frequently consulted for his carpentry knowhow and renowned for a dry sense_of_humor , colleagues said . As a rookie officer , Osornio distinguished himself through his role in a team arrest of a rape_suspect this year , Rammell said . Another time , Osornio chatted_up a driver he had stopped long enough to find_out the man was_on parole . A search of the car turned_up enough evidence to make an arrest for drugs and weapons possession , said Sgt . Jeff Love , Osornio ' s supervisor at the time . Osornio had moved with his family four years ago to Chino , where neighbors described him as helpful , outgoing and well-liked . &quot; He was a real nice , easygoing guy , &quot; said John Whiteman , 37 , who lives across the street from Osornio ' s parents and had seen Osornio on Monday afternoon stopping on his way to work . &quot; He would wave to you all_the time and if he saw you working ; he ' d always stop and ask if you needed help. &quot; Skilled with his hands like his father , a professional bricklayer , Osornio could often be seen helping_out with family construction projects . &quot; They ' re a really close family , &quot; Whiteman said . &quot; Sunday was family day . You ' d always see them out doing things together. &quot; The young officer , a boating and water-skiing enthusiast who remodeled old houses , recently moved_in with his high_school sweetheart , Chartina Skipper , who owned a home_in nearby Montclair . The two planned to marry soon . Huddled in the front_yard of Osornio ' s parents ' sprawling , ranch-style home_in Chino , clusters of the officer ' s longtime friends hugged his father , who at times was in tears . Rafael Osornio wept when approached by a reporter outside the home . &quot; What can I say ? &quot; he asked . Tony Robledo , who grew_up with Osornio , added : &quot; Mike was one of my closest friends and I ' m going_to miss him . He died a hero in my eyes. &quot; At the time of the crash , Osornio was about an hour into his overnight shift patrolling the city ' s southwest corner . His evening had been uneventful until the collision , Rammell said . Investigators sought Tuesday to determine where Ramirez , a sheet-metal worker who they said had never been arrested for drunk driving , had been before the crash . Ramirez received two traffic tickets -- one for failure to signal in 1992 and one for speeding in September -- and was involved in a car accident last year , according to court records and the Department of Motor_Vehicles . A resident alien who had been employed at the small metal-working plant for four years , Ramirez had a solid work record but had been beset by personal problems in recent months , said Marilyn Lindblade , owner of the business . Co-worker Maligalig said Ramirez was &quot; trying to pull his life together , trying to build something , helping his son go_to school and stay out of trouble . He was being a good father to his son . He lives for his children. &quot; Ramirez told colleagues he had been evicted from a Monterey Park apartment about six months ago because of problems with his son ' s friends , who were considered troublemakers by the landlord , Lindblade said . Before that , Ramirez ' s wife and two grown sons returned to Hidalgo , Mexico , to take_over the family_business after her father died , Lindblade said . Since then , Ramirez had been sleeping on a couch in a vacant office at the company , she said . Lindblade said Ramirez took the afternoon off Monday to talk to his son . &quot; He left at noon and came_back in the afternoon . He wasn ' t drunk then , and didn ' t seem to be upset or in a bad mood , &quot; she said . Co-workers said they did not know whether he left later . &quot; It was definitely an accident . It ' s totally out of character , &quot; Lindblade said . &quot; He did not drink , smoke or do drugs . He didn ' t go_in for that sort of thing . He was not a party-type person. &quot; La Habra police and residents spent much of Tuesday comforting each other . Officers wore narrow black bands across their badges in memory of their fallen comrade -- the second Southland officer to be mourned in a little more_than a week after falling line_of_duty . Officers wore the same bands in memory of a Los Angeles police_officer who was shot dead Oct . 21 while investigating possible drug dealing at a Hollywood motel . &quot; This is the first time I ' ve had to wear one for my own officer , &quot; Rammell said . The lobby at the city ' s police_station , decorated with a photograph of Osornio , was decked with bouquets of flowers brought by residents . A memorial fund in Osornio ' s name was being established at a local bank , officials said . Donations may be sent to the Michaal Osornio Memorial Fund , Sanwa Bank , 2015 W . La Habra Blvd. , La Habra . Capt . John Rees , one of a group of officers visiting Osornio ' s parents Tuesday , said a psychologist would be_on hand Tuesday night to counsel officers who were at the scene . &quot; The La Habra Police_Department is a small , family-oriented police_department , &quot; he said . &quot; I know the names of all_the people who work for me and I know the names of their wives . When a tragedy like this hits , it ' s a significant event in the life of the department . The officers will remember Mike for a long time. &quot; Even strangers joined the mourning . A group of four Sanwa employees visited the crash site at lunch time Tuesday . Only one of them had ever met Osornio , but that seemed to matter little . &quot; This is a very small community , &quot; said one of the bank workers , Ada Gaughan . &quot; Things that go_on here affect everyone in the community -- a police_officer particularly . They ' re friends here . They ' re not the enemy. &quot; Times staff writers Anna Cekola , David Haldane , Rene Lynch , Susan Marquez Owen and Martin Miller contributed to this report . * FEW OFFENDERS CAUGHT : In California only one drunk driver in 500 is arrested .
