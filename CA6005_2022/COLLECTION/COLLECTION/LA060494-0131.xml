   <HEADLINE> UCI PROFESSOR HAS OWN LINES ON ACTING ; PERFORMING ARTS : ROBERT COHEN ' S BOOKS ARE USED IN DRAMA PROGRAMS AT MANY UNIVERSITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Can acting be taught ? &quot; asks UC Irvine drama professor Robert E . Cohen , posing a question he has answered with distinction . It is a question Cohen asks on the first page of his 216-page book , &quot; Acting One , &quot; and answers with lessons on diction , body_language , stage_fright , approach , memorization methods , cues , techniques and liberation . It is a question , asked and answered , in his three other books on acting and in 25 years at UC Irvine , where he is the founder and former chairman of the widely respected theater department and where he continues to teach . Last fall Cohen was awarded the UCI Medal , the university ' s highest honor . This summer his influence in academia will be highlighted again by a study to be presented at a national educators ' conference showing that &quot; Acting One &quot; is used on more campuses to teach undergraduate performers than any other text . Surprisingly , the book is even more popular as a teaching tool than the celebrated &quot; An Actor Prepares &quot; by legendary Russian actor-director Konstantin Stanislavsky , who has long been one of the most pervasive influences in 20th-Century theater . &quot; Cohen ' s book replaced everything we had here , &quot; David Knight , chairman of the theater department and the head of acting at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , said by telephone . &quot; He has made quite an impact . Acting books come and go . There are a lot of them . But his has lasted because people find it useful. &quot; According to Joyce Aldridge , who conducted a nationwide survey for a 1992 doctoral dissertation at the University of Colorado , &quot; Acting One , &quot; which was written in 1984 , tops the list of all instructional acting books . It is required reading in 113 university drama programs . By her count , which she says still holds , Cohen ' s other books also are used extensively . &quot; Acting Power , &quot; his theoretical manifesto , is required in 54 programs , mostly at the graduate level ; &quot; Acting Professionally , &quot; a journalistic analysis of the industry , is used in 61 programs , and &quot; Acting in Shakespeare &quot; in five . Stanislavsky ' s ideas , which gave_rise to so-called method acting , gained their greatest fame in this country through such adherents as Marlon Brando and James Dean . But if the Russian master is &quot; the intellectual ancestor &quot; of all modern American acting , to quote Cohen , it is the 55-year-old professor ' s own post-Stanislavsky teachings that have invited comparison with Stanislavsky ' s and created a new , very different mantle of authority . This , despite the fact that Cohen is not himself a performer , world-renowned or otherwise , and has no famous students crediting him for their success . &quot; Cohen has codified a system that engages the student very quickly in action with partners , &quot; Aldridge said from Castleton State College in Vermont , where she is an assistant_professor of theater . &quot; He involves the student in what he calls ' interactive dynamics. ' Stanislavsky asks the actor to think_about his past and what has led him to the moment being presented on stage . Cohen asks him to think_about the future. &quot; During a recent interview at his UCI office , a cozy den lined with books and filled with theatrical memorabilia , Cohen said he is not &quot; anti-Stanislavsky &quot; but nonetheless reeled_off a litany of differences between their views . &quot; Stanislavsky is all about the actor getting_in_touch with his feelings . He thinks the source of a character resides in the actor ' s personality . I think it resides much more in the situation. &quot; &quot; I ' m more optimistic . He ' s more pessimistic . I ' m more future-oriented . He ' s more past-oriented . I ' m more cybernetic . He ' s more deterministic . I deal with tactics . He didn ' t deal very much with tactics , and he never dealt with the audience . It was an embarrassment to him. &quot; Cohen , who came_to UCI in 1965 by way of Dartmouth and Yale , speaks in such speedy rhythms that he sounds streetwise rather than Ivy League . He also does not look even remotely tweedy . Dressed in a habitual outfit of drab work shirt and jeans , he gives the casual appearance of someone who has wandered onto the campus perhaps by mistake . But there is no mistaking the chord he has struck . Ashley Carr , head of acting at Cal State Long_Beach , says Cohen &quot; distills Stanislavsky down to essentials as a starting point , &quot; then shows young actors how to avoid &quot; the sort of self-conscious , self-obsessed performances &quot; commonly associated with method acting . For his part , Cohen believes his ideas are popular because he emphasizes &quot; non-gloomy , totally goal-oriented acting. &quot; That means &quot; capturing and embodying the character ' s hope for victory , &quot; he said . Instead of having the actor plumb his own history to identify with the character by applying &quot; emotional memory &quot; -- one of the chief legacies of Stanislavsky ' s early teachings -- Cohen asks the actor to apply &quot; positive energy and optimism &quot; toward the character ' s goals . He says that perhaps the easiest way to illustrate the difference in their approaches is to imagine a bear , a man and a cabin . The bear is chasing the man . The man is running toward the cabin . A method actor playing the man concentrates_on what is behind him : the bear , which he understands as the &quot; cause &quot; of the situation . The bear is a metaphor for the past , in other words , a summation of all_the circumstances that brought him to that moment . Cohen , by contrast , would have the actor concentrate_on what is in front of him : the cabin , which provides a potential haven and is a metaphor for the future . &quot; Anybody in that situation would be looking ahead , not behind , &quot; he explained . &quot; He ' d be thinking_of how to get_to the cabin as fast as possible . He ' d be thinking_of contingency plans . ' If the door is locked , I ' ll climb_on the roof. ' The character is pulled by the future , not pushed by the past. &quot; Cohen says he derives his views on acting in large measure from concepts pioneered by post-Freudian psychiatry and modern communications theory . He mentions such influences as Erving Goffman ( &quot; The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life &quot; ) , Eric Berne ( &quot; Transactional Analysis in Psychotherapy &quot; ) , Paul Watzlawick ( &quot; Pragmatics of Human Communication &quot; ) and Gregory Bateson ( &quot; Steps to an Ecology of Mind &quot; ) . &quot; I ' m interested in where performance and behavior intersect , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re giving performances all_the time. &quot; In addition to his pedagogical clout on American campuses , Cohen is making inroads in Eastern Europe , where Stanislavsky has held_sway since Stalinist times . &quot; Acting Power &quot; has been published in Hungary , Estonia and Finland . &quot; I think he has updated Stanislavsky , &quot; Cohen ' s Finnish translator Maija-Liisa Marton said from Helsinki . &quot; He brings_to acting what modern science and technology have brought_to our lives . Stanislavsky is outdated . Cohen speaks a language young people understand nowadays. &quot; Marton notes that Cohen gives actors &quot; more tools &quot; for absurdist works . Characters in a Samuel Beckett play , for example , tend to be less susceptible to psychological parsing a la Stanislavsky , she says , and more amenable to Cohen ' s goal-oriented approach . &quot; Eastern Europe is in an acting crisis , &quot; said Cohen , who went_to Budapest in March to give master classes at Hungary ' s National Theatre Academy . &quot; They ' re looking_for optimism . They ' re looking_to escape_from solipsistic acting . &quot; With the demise of the Soviet empire they don ' t want to go_back to the tea-and-saucer drama that existed before Stanislavsky , you know -- kneel on your left leg and kiss with your upstage lip . This is true of everyone from the Hungarians to the Estonians , and even to a certain extent the Finns , who were not under Soviet domination. &quot;</TEXT>
