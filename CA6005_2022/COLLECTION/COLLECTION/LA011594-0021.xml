   <HEADLINE> CAREFUL , HE ' S NOT MR . NICE GUY ; SURE , SHAKE ASSAD ' S HAND , BUT DON ' T GO MUCH BEYOND THAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A few hours from now , President Clinton is scheduled to shake hands in Geneva with President Hafez Assad of Syria , a gesture of high-level recognition -- if not of approbation -- that Washington hopes will help induce one of the Arab world ' s more durable and ruthless dictators to resume peace negotiations with Israel . The Syria-Israel talks , which have been held sporadically along with other bilateral negotiations as part of the U.S.-sponsored Middle_East peace process , were suspended last fall . Syria has said there ' s nothing more to talk_about until Israel first commits itself to withdraw from the Golan Heights , the strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel that Israeli troops occupied in the 1967 war . Israel says discussion of its withdrawal will go_on the table as soon as Syria spells_out what kind of a peace agreement it is ready to make . Such incompatible conditions inevitably have led to deadlock . HAPPY AS A SPOILER : It would of course be desirable to re-enlist Syria as a fully involved partner in the peace process , alongside Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization . ( Lebanon , the fourth Arab party in the talks , remains under partial occupation by the Syrian army , and is compelled to do what Damascus wants in this regard. ) If Syria commits to ending its long war with Israel the prospects for lasting accommodation in the eastern Mediterranean -- including , probably , an explosion in economic_growth -- would be far brighter . If it stays outside the peace process , Syria almost certainly would continue to play its familiar role of spoiler , supporting the radical Iran-inspired Islamic group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and doing what it could generally to subvert whatever progress Jordan and the Palestinians might make with Israel . If nothing else , Assad would be able to claim that he continues to stand at the head of those Arabs who reject all political and territorial compromises with Israel . Assad might well indicate to Clinton that he could be drawn_back into the peace process if the price was right . One thing he very much wants is for the State_Department to drop Syria from its list of countries that support international terrorism . That would be a mistake . Syria has richly earned a place on the list by its deeds . It should be erased from the list not for expedient political reasons but only when it has clearly shown that it no longer supports terrorists . CREDITOR ' S CALL : The fact is that Syria is not playing with a very strong hand when it comes_to setting terms for rejoining the peace process . The considerable economic , military and political support Assad could once count_on from the Soviet_Union has disappeared . Indeed , Russia now wants the hard-pressed Damascus regime to repay its $ 8-billion debt to Moscow , and reportedly is holding_up shipments of military spare_parts until it starts to do so . Syria needs good relations and closer economic ties with the West . Even more important for the long term , it would benefit , along with others in the region , from the economic dividend that a successful peace process surely would produce . Reaching an accommodation with Israel and behaving responsibly after that are not gifts to be bestowed , but something Syria should do_in its own interests . Not least , it could help promote Assad ' s ambition to restore Damascus as the hub of Arab cultural and political affairs . The self-interest argument is one Clinton should emphasize . What he should not do is hand Assad any unearned rewards to try to lure him back to the conference_table . He should not get involved , either , in any substantive negotiations over either the terms for his return or -- more dangerously -- the terms of an Israel-Syria agreement . The strongest message Clinton can deliver is that peace will bring its own rewards . But peace can come_about only through negotiations .</TEXT>
