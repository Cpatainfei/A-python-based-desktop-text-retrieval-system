   <HEADLINE> U.S. GOLFERS SUDDENLY FACE THEIR FIRST MAJOR SHUTOUT ; PGA CHAMPIONSHIP : FOREIGN CONTINGENT HAS WON FIRST THREE TOURNAMENTS OF GRAND_SLAM THIS YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Maybe it ' s time to stop bashing the Americans and just say that golf is a truly international game . Maybe not . The PGA Championship opens at Southern Hills Country_Club on Thursday with the United States facing its first shutout in the four major championships since the Masters was created in 1934 . With three majors gone , the winners this year were Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain in the Masters , Ernie Els of South_Africa in the U.S. Open and Nick Price of Zimbabwe in the_British Open . Yes , Americans have lost their lock on the major championships . And , yes the winners ' list this year on the PGA Tour reads more like a Who ' s That than a Who ' s Who . But no other country is dominating the game , either . Winners are coming from all_over the globe . Maybe what it all all adds_up to is this : Golf HAS become a truly international game , but the Americans STILL should be bashed . &quot; American golf is getting hammered , &quot; said Paul Azinger , the defending PGA champion just returning to competition after a year sidelined with cancer . &quot; It ' s tiring listening to that . We are all golfers . Some are born in South_Africa , some are born in America . I think it ' s a wonderful thing that there is so_much competition. &quot; Competition there is . Consider this : Seven of the last nine major championships have been won by non-Americans . Six of those seven foreign winners have been different people from six different countries . Beyond Price , Els and Olazabal , there was Greg Norman of Australia in the 1993 British Open , Bernhard Langer of Germany in the 1993 Masters and Nick Faldo of England in the 1992 British Open . The only American winners in that stretch back to the ' 92 British Open were Azinger , in last year ' s PGA , and Lee Janzen , in last year ' s U.S. Open . Price was the only repeat winner , taking the 1992 PGA along with this year ' s British Open . Clearly , the foreign players have shown an astonishing depth . It ' s THEM against US and the THEMS from just about anywhere have shown they can beat US . &quot; Everyone wants to beat the Americans because the Americans have always been the best , whether in sports or war , &quot; Azinger said . &quot; ' Anyone from just about anywhere could win. &quot; In fact , the anyones from just about anywhere in the United States have shown they can win on the PGA Tour . Consider this : The only multiple winner on the PGA Tour this year is Price , who has three tour wins plus the_British Open . Going_into the Buick Open , seven PGA Tour events since the third week of March were claimed by first-time winners . Jot_down these names : Loren Roberts , Mike Springer , Mike Heinen , Neal Lancaster , Tom Lehman , Brian Henninger and Dicky Pride . Are you betting_on any of them this week in the PGA ? Likely not . The first_names to go_in the office pools are still Price , Norman , Faldo , maybe Els , Olazabal and Langer . When it comes time to list American contenders , who do we name ? Tom Watson , 44 and a non-winner since 1987 ; Fuzzy Zoeller , 42 and a non-winner since 1986 ; Raymond Floyd , 51 , Hale Irwin , 49 , Tom Kite , 44 , and Ben Crenshaw , 42 . Among the young studs , Janzen has been inconsistent since winning the U.S. Open in 1993 ; Fred Couples took the Masters in 1992 and appeared to be among the best in the world before a messy divorce distracted him and a back injury shelved him . And Azinger , winner of three tournaments in 1993 , including the PGA , in the top-three 10 times -- the most since Watson in 1980 -- and possessor of at least one victory each year since 1987 , had his run at greatness slowed by cancer late last year . Watson says the foreign domination is partly a cyclical thing . &quot; We are just in an era now where players from overseas have won more majors , &quot; he said . But Watson also thinks American golfers have become less competitive for two reasons : Easy entries and easy earnings . &quot; It might have to do with the all-exempt tour , &quot; Watson said . &quot; It doesn ' t promote the competition the old tour did . Monday qualifying was a big character builder. &quot; And then there is money . &quot; I truly believe that money corrupts desire , &quot; said Watson , who is the only American to finish in the top 10 in all three major championships this year . &quot; Not only in golf but in pro sports everywhere , and in business , &quot; he said . &quot; Some of the fear of not having it goes_away . When that fear leaves you , your desire probably weakens , &quot; Watson said . &quot; If you didn ' t finish in the top 30 money winners when I first came_on the tour , you probably weren ' t breaking even. &quot; Going_into the Buick Open , Janzen was in 30th place on this year ' s money list and had already won $ 359 # 295 . And 127 players had won more_than $ 100 # 000 for the year .</TEXT>
