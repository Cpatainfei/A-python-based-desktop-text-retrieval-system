   <HEADLINE> BUILDING TAIWAN : ASIA GOLD_RUSH ON ; INDUSTRY : FOREIGN COMPANIES CLAMOR TO GET PARTS OF ITS SIX-YEAR , $ 300-BILLION INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s a burning issue in Taiwan , pitting the United States and Europe against Japan in a global competition that speaks volumes about business in the high-stakes political minefields of Asia . The question : Who will have the privilege of burning garbage in this cash-rich island state ? The Japanese got_off to a head_start three years ago , claiming they were uniquely qualified for the job because they share with Taiwan a basic garbage culture . Asian garbage is &quot; wet &quot; compared to Western trash , the argument went , and that supposedly made Japan ' s incinerator technology the kind best suited to the task . Nonsense , said Americans trying to wrest away a_few good public-works contracts from the Japanese , who so far have dominated Taiwan ' s growing market for municipal incinerators . Garbage viscosity is a lame excuse , they said , for keeping a chokehold on the lucrative contracts . At stake is far more_than the $ 1 billion worth of waste incinerator contracts Taiwan will award this year alone . Foreign contractors are also competing here for power_plants , telecommunications gear and mass-transit projects -- all parts of Taiwan ' s $ 300-billion , six-year plan to develop a modern infrastructure . The total budget has been scaled back somewhat since this ambitious building bonanza was announced , with considerable hoopla , in 1991 . And , since a series of snafus involving land speculation and corruption , it appears that very little work will have been completed by year six of the plan . But Taipei is still Fat City in an Asian infrastructure gold_rush that extends from Hong Kong to Hanoi . After about a third of the infrastructure budget goes_to land acquisition and another third is paid to local contractors , Taiwan ' s market will yield some $ 60 billion to $ 80 billion in contracts to international bidders , according to U.S. officials . U.S. Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen estimates that Asian_countries will spend $ 1 trillion on infrastructure in the next decade . That figure doesn ' t count Japan ' s market , until recently closed to foreigners . &quot; that ' s 18 Santa Monica Freeway projects every day , &quot; Bentsen said in Los Angeles last month . &quot; If I were 30 years younger , I know what market I ' d want to be in. &quot; But it ' s not all easy_money . Taiwan ' s trash scene , for one , illustrates the convoluted reality of doing business in the trenches of Asia ' s public-works sector . &quot; This incinerator thing has been one big frustration , &quot; said Gregory Stevens , an American environmental business consultant based in Taipei . &quot; It ' s a mess. &quot; On the face of things , Taiwan ' s central government couldn ' t be more accommodating to European and U.S. firms . Taipei ' s dusty streets are torn_up now for a sprawling light-rail project that has been parceled off in so many segments to so many foreign joint_ventures that local wags call it &quot; the United Nations subway system. &quot; Cynical observers say the government , bucking its diplomatic pariah status as pretender to China ' s throne , is trying to buy some respect on the international stage with its public-works program . Others allege that civilian contracts_in some cases have been used as bait for foreign arms deals . Clearly , one of Taipei ' s most audacious strategies is its official policy of discrimination against Japan in awarding the contracts . Taipei , distressed by a $ 15-billion bilateral trade_deficit with Japan , has retaliated by raising import_barriers and nominally banning Japanese companies from bidding for public-works projects . Still , the official ban hasn ' t stopped Japanese-controlled firms from grabbing a piece of the pie . They ' ve bidden through overseas subsidiaries or local joint_ventures . On a section of the Taipei subway where Boise , Ida.-based Morrison Knudsen has a contract , price-competitive Komatsu backhoes are ripping_up the asphalt . The roads are clogged with supposedly verboten Japanese autos -- assembled in local screwdriver plants or imported from the United States to circumvent high tariffs . Even the Fords popular in this former Japanese colony are made by Mazda , lamented Ying Price , chief of the commercial section for the American Institute in Taiwan , the unofficial embassy . &quot; Taiwan was occupied by Japan for 50 years , &quot; she said . &quot; Maybe the troops left , but Japan ' s business practices are still deeply rooted. &quot; In the world of incinerators , as in other sectors , the Japanese competitive grip begins with the &quot; specs , &quot; or engineering specifications . Typically , whoever drafts the specs for an international tender has a decisive advantage in the competitive bidding . It ' s smart business . And in Taiwan , Japanese consultants initially set the specs for Taiwan ' s incinerators -- thereby perpetrating that myth that their technology was &quot; designed to treat Asian garbage , &quot; Price said . Some observers say the Japanese construction_industry ' s time-honored practice of dango , or bid rigging , has traveled_to Taiwan . &quot; The Japanese contractors behave as collusive bidders , &quot; said Chi Schive , vice_chairman of the government ' s Economic Planning and Development Council . &quot; They join as a group to bid , and they try to monopolize the market here. &quot; When a European or U.S. company bids on a project , Schive said , the Japanese firms typically &quot; lower their bids so no one can make a profit . In the second round , there are no Europeans or Americans left , and they raise their bids. &quot; Schive didn ' t say which bidding he was talking_about , but other observers say that ' s exactly what happened in the first round of eight incinerators put to bid in 1991 . Six of those projects went_to Japanese-affiliated companies . Japanese industry sources deny wrongdoing . The other two went_to Volund , a Danish firm , and its local partner , Chung Hsin . The Kuomintang ( KMT ) , Taiwan ' s ruling party , is a major shareholder in Chung Hsin , industry sources say . ( The KMT controls an extensive network of companies in Taiwan , but it flatly dismissed criticism that its involvement in business poses any conflict of interest. ) Meanwhile , Taiwanese authorities , in their zeal to stack the deck against the Japanese , decided to retain U.S. consultants to guide local officials in setting incinerator specifications in the second and future rounds of bidding . And Taiwan ' s Environmental Protection Agency , which funds the municipal projects , now requires that foreign companies involved in the bidding own their original technology . That rule burned all but one Japanese player , Takuma Co . of Osaka , which won two incinerator contracts_in 1991 . The others were licensing European technology , notwithstanding their claims of special expertise in Asian trash . The rule change strengthened the hand of the Europeans , who excel_at burning trash . It also eliminated all but three American companies : WMX Technologies , the former Waste Management Inc. , of Oakbrook , Ill. ; Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric , and Foster Wheeler of Clinton , N.J. &quot; It ' s a very tough market , but we think we can compete , &quot; said Katsihiko Senga , general_manager of Takuma ' s overseas department . &quot; We were accused of collusion by the newspapers because of a misunderstanding about budget overruns , &quot; Senga said . &quot; But it ' s not true . The whole atmosphere of discrimination is unfair to Japanese vendors . It ' s all because of the trade balance. &quot; Yet bidding on the second round , for six incinerators , was delayed until early this year . Taiwanese companies lobbied to join the fray as prime contractors , reversing roles in their alliances with the international firms by using foreign technology partners . &quot; Because of the political situation here , your technical qualifications aren ' t as important as your political clout , &quot; said a representative of a foreign environmental company in Taipei . &quot; In the first round , you had Japanese collusion , but now there ' s political collusion. &quot; In March , the Chung Hsin-Vorlund partnership was awarded two more incinerators , leaving four up for grabs this fiscal_year , which ends in June . As if things weren ' t confusing enough , overlapping layers of bureaucracy in Taiwan add another challenge to the sport of infrastructure bidding here . Since the central government claims to rule all_of China , a redundant provincial government supposedly runs this small , congested island . Add_to that county and municipal councils , all with a say in infrastructure policy . &quot; No one wants to be singled_out for a decision of any sort in this politically charged environment , &quot; complained a Taiwan-based American executive in the power generation industry . &quot; And we have nothing that the politicians are interested in . We don ' t vote , and we don ' t do political_campaign contributions. &quot; The situation is ripe for corruption , critics say . Legislators of the opposition Democratic Progressive_Party , many of whom were jailed as dissidents in the old days , have appointed themselves guardians against boondoggles and graft . Maysing H . Yang , a DPP official , railed in an interview about the problems of the disjointed &quot; United Nations subway , &quot; on which equipment has failed and trash_cans cost $ 1 # 000 each . The cost of building the line , she said , is 40 times higher than subway construction in Tokyo or Singapore , because insider speculation has driven_up land prices . &quot; We know that Japan has a lot of corruption , &quot; Yang said , &quot; but at least their projects work. &quot; In October , a Taipei court convicted 13 city transit officials on corruption charges and ordered them to repay $ 9.7 million in misappropriated funds . The $ 17-billion commuter rail program has been plagued by litigation , including a bizarre contract dispute with the_French firm Matra . Arthur Y . Chen , executive_secretary of the Public Construction Supervisory Board , the government ' s official watchdog agency , blames democracy for the infrastructure morass . Now that regional officials and local councils have been empowered by democratic reform , Chen said , they all want a piece of the action . That has slowed approvals for permits and helped inflate land costs , he said . &quot; All this problem with land is the kind of trouble you get from democracy , &quot; he said . &quot; We accomplished so_much in the past , but now , with too_much democracy , everybody can say something , and it ' s impossible to move. &quot;</TEXT>
