   <TEXT> You ' re at a luncheon on a balcony overlooking the_French Riviera . It is the day after your latest film , &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; had its world_premiere at the Cannes Film Festival , the day after you saw the movie for the first time yourself , and you ' re here with your director , Quentin Tarantino , and co-stars Bruce Willis , Uma Thurman and Samuel L . Jackson to discuss it with the international press . As you move from one table to another , in a media ritual known as the round_robin interview , you find that you ' re not being interviewed so_much as being adulated . The critics and journalists loved the movie , a black comedy about killers and molls and double-crossers , but they are astonished by your performance as a fast-talking , heroin-addicted hit_man , and as rude as they may normally be , they can ' t stop gushing today . An actor can ' t hear too_much praise , you will say later , and you certainly got plenty of it when you were the hottest movie_star on the planet . But that was a long_time ago -- before circumstances and a series of box-office failures drained your popularity , before critics and film_industry mavens lost interest , before the tabloids started calling you fat and a religious cultist , before you resigned yourself to perhaps never getting another chance to reclaim your stardom -- and the response to you here is overwhelming . Your name is John Travolta , you ' re 40 years old , and you ' re afraid you ' re going to cry . * &quot; At one point , I had to leave one of the tables and gather my feelings , &quot; Travolta recalls , three and a half months later , in the library of his home_in an exclusive subdivision of Daytona Beach , Fla . &quot; I didn ' t want to cry in front of ( the press ) , but I felt_like it. &quot; The Cannes Film Festival is famous for launching new stars , and the Palme d ' Or won by &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; in May is having that effect on director Tarantino . But in the case of Travolta , the film , which opens Friday , has relaunched an old star and may be sending him further than he has ever gone . &quot; Since Cannes , my career has had more forward progress than it did any time after one of my hits , &quot; Travolta says . &quot; In terms of both the quality of the projects offered and the money paid. &quot; Says Jonathan Krane , a film_producer who has doubled for the last 10 years as Travolta ' s business manager : &quot; It has been the most direct and immediate response I have ever seen in my life between a performance and the way it was received . From the moment the film was seen at Cannes , ( industry ) people have been coming_to John with offers. &quot; Though &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; has so far been seen only at festivals , Travolta has already signed for two new movies , including one -- an MGM adaptation of Elmore Leonard ' s bestseller &quot; Get Shorty &quot; -- that provides the highest upfront salary of his career ( which he declined to confirm but is reportedly about $ 3.5 million ) , plus a reported $ 750 # 000 bonus if he receives an Oscar nomination for &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; and another $ 750 # 000 if he wins . &quot; I don ' t know if that ' s ever been done before , &quot; Travolta says of his bonus arrangement with the producers of &quot; Get Shorty. &quot; &quot; would n ' t it be something if I started a trend ? &quot; Before taking_on the role of Chili Palmer in &quot; Get Shorty , &quot; Travolta will star in &quot; White_Man ' s Burden , &quot; a low-budget independent feature being produced by Tarantino ' s film company and directed by Tarantino ' s friend Desmond Nakano . Travolta says he loves Nakano ' s story , a dramatic fable about a society in which the roles of whites and blacks are reversed , but acknowledges that he agreed to work with a first-time director partly out of loyalty to Tarantino and to his partner , Lawrence Bender . &quot; I have to trust those guys because I ' m where I am because of them , &quot; Travolta says . &quot; It ' s funny , one movie can make you , and one movie can remake you . It ' s like I went_to the moon , then came_back down to Earth , and now I get_to go_to Mars or someplace. &quot; Earth to moon in this celestial metaphor is Englewood , N.J. , where Travolta grew_up , to Hollywood , where he gained quick fame as Vinnie Barbarino in ABC ' s &quot; Welcome Back , Kotter &quot; ( 1975-79 ) and as Tony Manero and Danny Zuko in the movie blockbusters &quot; Saturday Night Fever &quot; ( 1977 ) and &quot; Grease &quot; ( 1978 ) . For a while , Travolta even reigned atop the rock charts as a recording artist . Moon to Earth was his fall from grace after the 1985 flop &quot; Perfect &quot; and a series of movies that were barely released in theaters . His fall was broken by the popular &quot; Look Who ' s Talking &quot; series , but his role did little to resurrect Travolta as a dramatic leading man . Now , thanks to Tarantino , a 31-year-old fellow high_school dropout who had been a fan of Travolta ' s since grade_school , the star is headed for Mars or someplace . &quot; It ' s like this young_man comes_into my life and gives me an opportunity to rekindle the kind of career people expected from me and that I expected from myself , &quot; Travolta says . &quot; There was always a trickle of hope brought_in with each production , but last year , I just decided to live my life and stop worrying about ( my career ) . Then , within a_couple_of days , I got a call from Quentin. &quot; To appreciate the full impact of that call , you have to imagine another lunch scene , this one in the restaurant of Beverly Hills ' Four Seasons Hotel . It was there , early last year , where Travolta and Tarantino -- whose first feature , &quot; Reservoir Dogs , &quot; had made him one of the hottest directing prospects in the industry -- first met . &quot; I was writing ' Pulp Fiction ' then , but I didn ' t have John in mind for a part , &quot; says Tarantino , an inveterate movie buff who can recall Travolta ' s films with almost scene-for-scene detail . &quot; In the back of my mind , I hoped we ' d get_along and that I could work with him later , but I just wanted to meet him. &quot; Travolta says he agreed to the lunch because his agent and friends urged him to , and because he was flattered by Tarantino ' s enthusiasm . The guy was hot , sure , but after taking_a_look at the ultra-violent &quot; Reservoir Dogs &quot; on video , he wondered , &quot; What would I be doing_in something like this ? &quot; The Four Seasons lunch was another gusher for Travolta , who nourished himself on Tarantino ' s praise . And Emma Thompson , who was eating_at another table , dropped_by to flatter him some more . Thompson , who won the best actress Oscar for the previous year ' s &quot; Howards End , &quot; had been a Travolta fan since her uncle took her to see &quot; Saturday Night Fever , &quot; she told him ; then , turning_to Tarantino , she admonished him to &quot; put this man in one of your movies ; he needs a good movie. &quot; Travolta had been in similar situations before and didn ' t think there was anything special going on . Tarantino , who collects board_games based on movies and TV_shows , ended that lunch by inviting Travolta to drop_by his West Hollywood apartment the following week to play the games he had that were based on &quot; Welcome Back , Kotter , &quot; &quot; Grease &quot; and &quot; Saturday Night Fever. &quot; Travolta agreed . In the &quot; Grease &quot; game , Tarantino says , each person plays a disc_jockey collecting hit records . &quot; When we started , John said , ' This is a really lame game , ' but every time a song title came_up , we ' d both start singing . You ' re not supposed to , but we did . It was great. &quot; If Tarantino ' s neighbors were wondering why two grown men were belting_out the lyrics to &quot; You ' re the One That I Want &quot; that night , what they were doing was sowing the seeds of Travolta ' s comeback . Tarantino went_back to writing &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; suddenly inspired to tailor one of his principal characters for the star , while Travolta went blithely on with his life . As grim as things may have seemed to outsiders looking_at Travolta ' s career , the actor says he was_on a personal high in 1993 . He had married actress Kelly Preston in 1991 , and their son , Jett , was barely a year old . The couple divide their time between homes_in the Spruce Creek Fly-In development in Florida , on an island off the coast of Maine and in Carmel . Travolta , an avid flyer since age 16 , owns three jets ( yes , his son was named for his hobby ) , and he keeps the two smaller ones -- a Lear and a vintage Vampire British fighter -- in the hangar behind his house in Daytona Beach . With wealth , lovely homes , a beautiful wife , a son he says has given him a sense of wonder and vulnerability he had never known before , Travolta was facing his 40th birthday with everything his heart desired -- except a flourishing film career . How did an actor who , at 22 , was being heralded by some as the new Marlon Brando , end_up making movies that barely went_to video , let alone theaters , a decade later ? &quot; Up until 1985 , I think I made all_the choices I was supposed to make , &quot; Travolta says . &quot; But when the onslaught of wonderful young actors came_on the scene -- Tom Hanks , Cruise , Costner , Mel Gibson -- it was suddenly less interesting to give me all_the best scripts . It wasn ' t that there weren ' t hits or some good work after that , but it wasn ' t at the top level . . . . I had to settle for third and fourth choices and make the best of what was offered to me. &quot; Travolta insists that things were never as grim as they may have seemed to outsiders examining his career . There was always something going_on , offers he didn ' t take , or things that didn ' t pan_out . He thought he had it wired in 1989 , when he starred in a Michael Douglas-produced drama called &quot; The Tender &quot; and in Robert Altman ' s one-hour dramatization of Harold Pinter ' s &quot; The Dumb Waiter. &quot; But &quot; The Tender &quot; got caught_up in a bankruptcy and has never been released , and &quot; The Dumb Waiter , &quot; in which Travolta plays a cockney British hit_man , was dumped by ABC in a low-viewer time_slot . Altman raves about Travolta ' s performance in &quot; The Dumb Waiter , &quot; while acknowledging that he agreed to consider him only because he was asked to by a network executive . &quot; I would never have cast him based on what I ' d seen him do before , &quot; Altman says . &quot; I was impressed with his confidence . He said he could do_it and I believed him . . . . I was thrilled with what he did , and Pinter just loved him. &quot; When you look_at Travolta ' s career in the context of what was going_on in Hollywood , he seems as much a victim of timing as of mismanagement . He arrived_at the very moment the studios were trying to target youth audiences with either special_effects or fad movies , and with his good looks , dramatic talent and music ability , he was the perfect candidate for those pop culture movie events . &quot; Saturday Night Fever &quot; tapped into the disco craze , &quot; Grease &quot; into ' 50s nostalgia , &quot; Urban Cowboy &quot; into cowboy chic , &quot; Perfect &quot; into the health club singles scene . When Travolta wasn ' t in films exploiting pop culture trends , he was being exploited himself , in Sylvester Stallone ' s &quot; Staying Alive &quot; and in &quot; Two of a Kind , &quot; a listless comedy whose only draw was his on-screen reunion with &quot; Grease &quot; co-star Olivia Newton-John . &quot; Because he rose so fast , when the chain was broken , he fell very quickly , &quot; says movie critic Gene Siskel , who ranks &quot; Saturday Night Fever &quot; among Hollywood ' s greatest coming-of-age movies . &quot; After that , people put him in a box . He was perceived of as a youth performer . People loved him so_much in that youthful role , they didn ' t want to let it go. &quot; The truth is that even if Travolta had wanted to try some small , &quot; serious &quot; films , the industry wasn ' t making many of them in the early ' 80s . Only at the end of the decade did the studios begin to recognize the viability of movies aimed at older audiences . By then , Travolta ' s image was closer to that of Tab Hunter than Marlon Brando . &quot; I don ' t think people doubted he was a good actor , &quot; says &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; producer Bender . &quot; But there was the perception in Hollywood that John Travolta was not going_to get your movie made. &quot; Travolta himself acknowledges that when &quot; Look Who ' s Talking &quot; was being developed , the studio would green-light it only if one of five actresses -- Kirstie Alley , Meg Ryan and Goldie Hawn among them -- would agree to co-star . The movie , released at Christmas in 1989 , eventually grossed $ 138 million , and the first sequel , &quot; Look Who ' s Talking Too , &quot; sold another $ 47 million in tickets . Travolta made a lot of money through profit participation , but the level of scripts being offered to him did not improve . Re-enter Quentin Tarantino . While Travolta was preparing_for the third &quot; Look Who ' s Talking &quot; movie in Vancouver , Canada , Tarantino was tailoring the role of hit_man Vincent Vega in &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; for him . &quot; After meeting John , I kept thinking_of him whenever I was writing for Vincent , &quot; Tarantino says . &quot; I had another actor ( Michael Madsen ) in mind when I started_out , but I could see John doing_it . When I finished , I called him and said , ' I ' m sending you something . Look_at Vincent. ' &quot; &quot; It was an amazing script , &quot; says Travolta . &quot; Beyond clever , it was alive and unique and real . I thought , ' I would love to do this character , but there is no way in hell they ' re going to let me. ' &quot; Travolta ' s instincts were right . &quot; The reaction was ' You can get anybody in the world -- why do you want John Travolta ? ' &quot; Bender says . Travolta said at a press_conference in Cannes that Tarantino had put his job on the line to get him in the movie , and publicly thanked him for it . Tarantino says he didn ' t have to go quite that far , saying he persuaded the film ' s financial backers with &quot; my enthusiasm. &quot; Even after he was approved for the role , Travolta had to sign_on for a fee that he says didn ' t even cover his expenses . &quot; I said to ( Miramax Chairman ) Harvey Weinstein , ' I ' ll accept this , but isn ' t this inverted ? I grew_up thinking that if you did some work , you got paid_for it. ' I just had to look_at it as an investment , and it worked_out pretty well. &quot; In the final analysis , of course , it ' s the performance , not the casting gimmick , that has returned Travolta to the Hollywood A-list . With shoulder-length hair and earrings , his six-foot frame swollen to a sluggish 200 pounds , Travolta plays Vincent as a gently disoriented sociopath , talking his partner ' s ears off about the comparative qualities of American- and foreign-made French fries while preparing to carry_out a Mob execution . As critic Pauline Kael observed about him early in his career , Travolta is a great physical actor -- &quot; he has the gift of transparency , &quot; she wrote -- and you can hardly look_at Vincent floating along on a heroin high and not giggle . There is certainly nothing transparent in Travolta ' s appearance . He was more_than 40 pounds heavier for &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; than he was for &quot; Saturday Night Fever &quot; and is unabashed about it . There ' s a scene in the film where he is compelled to strip , and , by his own description , it ' s not a pretty sight . &quot; When I saw that scene for the first time in Cannes , I went , ' Ooh. ' I told Quentin , ' I ' ll do this , but if I turn_around and show my big ass , audiences will be going , ' Do we really have to ? ' &quot; Asked about his weight now , Travolta runs_through the numbers as if they were part of his resume . He weighed 180 as Barbarino , 160 as Tony Manero and nearly 230 as the expectant father of Jett Travolta . &quot; When Kelly ate , &quot; he says , &quot; I ate with her. &quot; Tarantino says Travolta offered to bulk up for the role of Vincent , but they agreed that a middle-aged hit_man addicted to heroin and french fries would n ' t spend much time in the gym . The real genius was in Tarantino ' s casting of Travolta , says the star ' s supporters . &quot; There is a sweetness that ' s always there , &quot; critic Siskel says . &quot; that ' s a real powerful thing in him. &quot; &quot; John has a quality of vulnerability and emotional connection that is evident in every movie he ' s ever done , &quot; says producer and business manager Krane . &quot; You get_it from him no matter what kind of character he plays. &quot; John Badham , who directed Travolta in &quot; Saturday Night Fever , &quot; ranks his Oscar-nominated performance in that film as one of the finest he has ever seen and says it would have been a different movie with anyone else in the role . &quot; Tony Manero was the most negative , rude , manipulative , using kind of character that I ' d ever seen in a script , &quot; Badham recalls . &quot; An actor without sympathy would have made him totally hateful . John brought a quality to him that made him work , made audiences feel something for him. &quot; Seventeen years later , Travolta seems to have done the same thing in &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; for Vincent Vega , a lowlife thug with a quick trigger and a kindly spirit . There is a scene in &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; in which Vincent accidentally shoots a man in the head , creating a mess in his and his partner ' s car that takes them the next 20 minutes of screen time to clean_up . &quot; That scene to me was the hardest part of saying yes to the project , &quot; Travolta says . &quot; In the original script , I shoot the guy once in the throat and he ' s still alive , so I have to shoot him in the head to put him out of his misery . Then we worry about the mess . It was the scene most like the torture scene in ' Reservoir Dogs , ' and I didn ' t think it was going_to be funny. &quot; Travolta ended_up suggesting changes that both soften the cruelty of his character and take the entire sequence directly into black comedy . However &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; does at the box_office , Travolta says , it has already changed his life and his thinking about the industry that coveted him , rejected him and is now coveting him again . &quot; Warren Beatty told me something 10 years ago that I didn ' t quite believe , &quot; Travolta says . &quot; I asked him , ' Warren , what ' s more important : movies that do_well from a box-office point_of_view or movies that the industry admires more ? ' Without a beat , he said , ' What you need to do is impress the people who can further your career. ' I thought he was crazy , but I can ' t disagree now . The perception of ' Pulp Fiction ' is changing the perception of who I am in Hollywood. &quot; As for Tarantino , the fan who rescued the star , it all seemed so obvious . &quot; It drove me crazy in the last five years seeing John in the movies he ' s been in , &quot; Tarantino says . &quot; I looked_at them and said , ' Why aren ' t directors taking_advantage of him ? Don ' t they know they have this great natural_resource out there ? ' &quot; They do now .</TEXT>
