   <HEADLINE> STRENGTHENING DOLLAR CALMS STOCKS , BONDS ; MARKETS : ADMINISTRATION ' S INTERVENTION IS A SUCCESS . THE DOW AVERAGE CLOSES_DOWN 1.78 POINTS IN SUBDUED TRADING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dollar extended its gains against most major currencies Thursday , and the sense of calm spread to the stock and bond markets . Analysts said the dollar ' s advance shows that the Clinton_Administration had succeeded -- at least for now -- in its battle to rescue the battered currency . In New York , the dollar closed at 102.85 Japanese yen , up from 101.85 on Wednesday , and at 1.667 German marks , up from 1.654. The dollar also strengthened elsewhere in Europe on Thursday , a day after it surged worldwide on the U.S.-led support move . The Federal_Reserve_Bank of New York and the central_banks of 15 other nations intervened heavily in the U.S. and European markets Wednesday , buying_up dollars . It was the largest coordinated intervention by the leading industrialized nations since August , 1992 . The dollar ' s rapid decline against key currencies had aroused fears of inflation and capital flight from the United States . &quot; When we closed over certain levels ( Wednesday ) , a lot of people changed sentiment , &quot; said Matt Porio , vice_president for foreign_exchange at Chase Manhattan Bank . &quot; There ' s been such a bearish trend since February . This is the biggest sign of life for the dollar in two to three months. &quot; But some analysts said that economic fundamentals -- notably robust U.S. growth compared to sluggishness in Europe and Japan -- had not supported a weak dollar , and the intervention provided traders with an excuse to reverse course . A nation ' s currency tends to strengthen with economic_growth , which helps raise the price of stocks , bonds and other assets and thus draws_in capital . Meanwhile , stocks closed modestly lower in quiet trading as traders turned cautious ahead of today ' s closely watched jobs report for April . &quot; The smartest thing anybody could say about this market is that it ' s looking_for something to push it one way or another , &quot; said Richard Meyer , head equity trader at Ladenburg , Thalmann &amp; Co . The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.78 points to 3 # 695.97. On the New York Stock_Exchange , declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on Big Board volume totaling 255.69 million shares , down from 267.9 million Wednesday . The Nasdaq composite index managed to edge_up 0.25 to 740.55 , even though most small-capitalization stocks finished lower . Wall_Street analysts expect today ' s report to show that unemployment remained steady at 6.5 % and that non-farm payrolls rose by just under 200 # 000 . If the report shows that more people than expected are working , it could be interpreted as potentially inflationary and drive bond and stock prices lower , analysts said . Stocks were supported through most of the session by a firmer bond market , where the 30-year Treasury yield finished unchanged from Wednesday ' s 7.33 % . The Dow had moved_up more_than 15 points early in the session , dipped backed to nearly unchanged , then recovered to post modest gains for most of the afternoon , until last-minute selling pushed it lower . Bonds rose early in the day in response to the dollar ' s strength and a Labor_Department report saying first-time state unemployment claims rose by 17 # 000 last week , much more_than most economists had expected . Traders viewed the number as a positive harbinger for today ' s jobs report . A rise in joblessness could ease the market ' s fear of upward pressure on wages , a key component of inflation . Among the market highlights : * Kmart led the action on the NYSE , falling 3 / 8 to 15 5 / 8 after reporting that sales in U.S. stores open at least a year slipped 3.2 % in April . Gap , which fell 1 1 / 8 to 47 1 / 2 , said same-store sales were unchanged while total sales rose 10 % . Sears rose 1 1 / 4 to 47 5 / 8 . Its same-store sales advanced 12.3 % and overall sales rose 12.4 % . Utilities stocks fell amid fears that another interest_rate tightening by the Fed would raise operating_costs for utility companies , which tend to borrow heavily in the capital markets for large-scale construction projects . * American Electric_Power finished down 7 / 8 at 3 1 / 2 , Peoples Energy fell 7 / 8 to 27 7 / 8 and FPL Group fell 2 1 / 8 to 31 3 / 4 . * Oil stocks rose amid mounting consensus that oil prices will remain steady . Atlantic Richfield rose 2 1 / 8 to 99 3 / 8 . British Petroleum advanced 2 19 / 32 to 71 15 / 32 . * Insurance stocks rose amid sentiment that the downward pressure on premiums is easing . Aetna rose 1 to 53 7 / 8 . Marsh &amp; McLennan rose 2 to 87 . Prices were mixed_in overseas trading . In London , the Financial Times 100-share average climbed back above the psychological 3 # 100 level , closing_up 35.5 at 3 # 106 , while Frankfurt ' s DAX 30-share average ended 13.18 points lower at 2 # 235.84. Hong Kong ' s blue_chip Hang Seng index climbed 43.44 points to 8 # 412.88 after trading lower for most of the day . It hit the year ' s intra-day low at 8 # 249.20 in morning trade . Both the Mexican and Japanese markets were closed for holidays . Elsewhere , gold prices fell on New York ' s Comex to $ 373.60 an ounce , off $ 3 . Silver finished at $ 5.107 an ounce , down from $ 5.175 on Wednesday . Coffee futures topped $ 1 a pound for the first time in more_than 3 1 / 2 years on speculative buying ignited by tight supplies . &quot; It ' s just a buying frenzy , &quot; said analyst Judy Ganes of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . Green coffee_beans for May delivery surged 5.45 cents on New York ' s Coffee , Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange to $ 1.002 a pound , the highest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Sept . 5 , 1990 . The more actively traded July contract rose 4.95 cents to 99.85 cents a pound . Coffee futures have rallied 27.7 cents this year , or about 38 % , as production and exports have dwindled due_to nearly five years of low prices and poor growing weather in some producing countries . Prices have also been driven higher by an agreement among 28 producer countries to hold_back up_to 20 % of normal exports . The countries began retaining shipments Oct . 1 but stopped last week when a 20-day moving price average reached 80 cents a pound . Their agreement requires the producers to begin releasing the retained stocks when the indicator price reaches 85 cents . It stood at 82.83 cents Thursday . Crude_oil prices also rose strongly in reaction to the outbreak of civil_war in Yemen and forecasts of higher demand . Light , sweet crude_oil for June delivery settled at $ 17.29 a barrel , up 43 cents on the New York Merc . Yemen , which pumps about 350 # 000 barrels a day , was plunged into civil_war Thursday between historically conservative northern Yemen and the socialist southern part of the country . Crude_oil prices have slowly been recovering from five-year lows on expectations of higher demand and a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to keep production steady .
