   <HEADLINE> NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE OUSTS SLOVAK LEADER ; EUROPE : POPULIST CRUSADER MECIAR IS A VICTIM OF A SAGGING ECONOMY . POLITICAL ALLIES DESERT HIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Parliament of Slovakia voted Friday to oust populist Prime_Minister Vladimir Meciar , who spearheaded the nationalist drive that brought_about the 1993 break-up of Czechoslovakia and set the poorer eastern lands on a course for economic ruin . The 78-2 vote of no-confidence in Meciar , cast after a two-day debate in the Slovak capital of Bratislava , reflected the political and social turmoil that has gradually consumed Slovakia since its damaging split from the Czech lands 14 months ago . Under the Slovak constitution , the Cabinet must resign after a parliamentary vote of no-confidence . President Michal Kovac must then designate an interim prime_minister to propose a new government , which must secure parliamentary endorsement in 30 days . Meciar , who still enjoys strong popular support despite recent political setbacks , became vulnerable to parliamentary ouster after nine deputies defected from his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia last month . At least a dozen other lawmakers from the movement and its coalition partner , the Slovak Nationalist Party , had switched allegiances in the last six months in protest of the prime_minister ' s authoritarian and combative leadership style . Deputies from Meciar ' s coalition abstained_from the no-confidence vote . True_to his pugilist background , Meciar went_down fighting . &quot; You all know I shall win the elections , &quot; he warned the deputies before their vote to oust him . &quot; You are opposing something you cannot even grasp. &quot; The Czech news_agency CTK said Meciar spoke_for more_than two hours , urging the Parliament to oust the turncoat deputies rather than his government . The Slovak Parliament had been virtually paralyzed since the latest defections , making_it impossible for either the prime_minister ' s coalition or the opposition to push_through legislation that might have set the nation on a path toward recovery . While the Czech Republic has surged ahead with reforms since the peaceful Jan . 1 , 1993 , divorce of Czechoslovakia into two separate countries , Slovakia has watched its antiquated heavy industries slip deeper into bankruptcy while unemployment has topped 12 % and inflation gallops at triple-digit rates . Meciar had been campaigning for early elections in June to cash_in_on his continued voter appeal before living conditions could erode further . But he had been encountering resistance from opposition deputies who know their parties would fare better later in the year , when the economic_crisis has had more time to influence voters . &quot; Our first task will be to secure a peaceful early election , &quot; said Roman Kovac , a former deputy prime_minister who is considered a possible successor to Meciar . No date has been set for new elections , but they are likely to be called this autumn to resolve the governing crisis that has resulted from so many members of the 150-seat Parliament switching parties to protest Meciar ' s failed economic_policies . New elections may do little to simplify the political chaos , as voter sympathies appear polarized between the far right and former Communist left .</TEXT>
