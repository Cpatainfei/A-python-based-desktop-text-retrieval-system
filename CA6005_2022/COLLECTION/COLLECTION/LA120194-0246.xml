   <TEXT> Since the 1970s , California ' s scales of justice have equated the severity of possessing less than an ounce of marijuana to running a red_light . All that changes starting today . As of 12:01 a.m. , offenders face a six-month suspension of their driver ' s license for any drug conviction , including marijuana and all other illicit drugs . The tough state law enacted this year -- dubbed the &quot; smoke a joint , lose your license &quot; law -- is expected to snare the licenses of 131 # 000 drivers during the next 12 months , whether or not their offenses were related to operation of a motor_vehicle . It applies to state and federal drug crimes , ranging from felonies punishable by long prison sentences to the so-called decriminalized misdemeanor possession of less than an ounce of marijuana , which up_to now has been punishable by a citation and $ 100 fine , less than the fine for many traffic violations . &quot; It ' s going_to complicate prosecution of minor crimes , &quot; said Dale Gieringer , California coordinator of a national group that advocates decriminalizing simple marijuana offenses . &quot; People are going_to be contesting charges in court because the loss of your license is more of a concern than a fine of $ 100. &quot; The new law , Gieringer asserted , is an attempt to bypass legislation enacted in the 1970s that made possession or cultivation of less than an ounce of marijuana for personal use subject_to the $ 100 fine and citation . But officials from the Wilson Administration , which pushed for the law , say a 1993 Department of Motor_Vehicles study shows that those arrested on drug offenses are prone to more traffic accidents and violations regardless of whether their arrest was connected to driving . California becomes the 19th state to comply with an extraordinary federal law that requires states to enact the driver ' s license statute or formally declare their opposition to such a law -- as 31 states have . States that remain silent on the issue risk losing federal highway funds . For California , the cost of not taking action would have resulted in the cutoff of 5 % , or about $ 54 million , of its federal road_construction and maintenance money during the next year . The compliance bill , carried for Gov . Pete Wilson by Assemblyman Robert Frazee ( R-Carlsbad ) , was passed_on the last_day of the legislative session , Aug . 31 -- one month before the federal deadline -- and signed by Wilson . He called it an appropriate response to illegal drug use , &quot; regardless of whether or not the individual was operating a motor vehicle. &quot; Unlike most statutes that become permanent , the new law will automatically expire next Dec . 1 , unless it is renewed by the 1995 Legislature , as expected . Judges in California long have had the power to suspend or revoke the driver ' s license of anyone found guilty of a drug offense involving the use of a motor_vehicle . The new law makes a radical departure by targeting drug offenses unrelated to driving , unless the judge finds a &quot; compelling circumstance &quot; to make an exception . State Director of Motor_Vehicles Frank Zolin , whose department sponsored the legislation , estimates that 131 # 000 drivers will lose their licenses because of drug convictions in the next year . The bill was also supported by the state_Department of Transportation , the California Highway Patrol and the Committee on Moral Concerns , a Christian lobby . Among opponents were the American Civil Liberties Union , the Teamsters Union and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) . The ACLU and the Teamsters argued that suspension of a driver ' s license should occur only as a result of offenses related directly to operation of a motor_vehicle . Opponents also warned that a minor marijuana conviction , for example , could cost a person a job by jeopardizing transportation to and from work . &quot; The Legislature basically caved_in to Wilson , who was insisting on this bill , &quot; said Gieringer of NORML . &quot; Every state west of Texas opted out of this except California. &quot; Sean Walsh , Wilson ' s press secretary , said : &quot; We say the bottom_line is , we ' ve got_to have a penalty . This , by law , requires people to act responsibly . We expect it will have the result of cutting_back on illegal drug use. &quot; In 1992 , the Legislature passed a bill strengthening driver ' s license restrictions but declaring the state ' s opposition to suspending licenses of drug violators . Wilson vetoed it . Nationally and in California , critics of linking the loss of a driver ' s license to unrelated drug convictions have charged that there is no credible connection between the two . But the Wilson Administration says the DMV study shows there is a connection . The DMV study looked_at 106 # 214 people arrested in 1989 in California on drug charges and charted their traffic records for three years . The review found that those arrested had 1.6 times more highway crashes as other motorists and three times as_many traffic offenses . The study said those arrested on drug violations represented an &quot; elevated &quot; highway safety risk . It concluded that there is a &quot; nexus between drugs and traffic safety. &quot; But NORML challenged the study as failing to build_in a control factor for age and sex . &quot; It only confirms that young males are worse drivers , &quot; NORML said . As for NORML ' s warning of a clogged court system , DMV spokesman Evan Nossoff said the measure ' s potential impact on the judiciary was not studied because officials believe it will have relatively little effect . &quot; Mainly , we looked_at the impact of losing between $ 47 million and $ 55 million , &quot; he said . &quot; We don ' t see that this law will be a major factor_in courtroom calendars , but we do believe it will provide a small but significant improvement in traffic safety. &quot; Highway Patrol officials offered only cautious forecasts on the law ' s potential to reduce both drug use and traffic carnage . &quot; It ' s worth a try , &quot; said Deputy CHP Commissioner D.E. ( Spike ) Helmick . &quot; If it has some deterrent effect on youth , we felt it might have some basis. &quot;</TEXT>
