   <HEADLINE> ELECTION ORDERED TO RESOLVE LONG_BEACH COUNCIL RACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Superior_Court judge has ordered a special election in Long_Beach to resolve a seesaw City_Council race in which the apparent loser emerged with a two-vote victory in June after several uncounted ballots were discovered during a recount . Mike Donelon , a contractor who was declared the winner , will step_down , leaving the seat vacant until the special election determines whether he or community activist Tonia Reyes Uranga should represent the city ' s 7th Council District . The City_Council will decide Tuesday on the election date , which by law must be in late January or early February , attorneys said . It is the first time that an election has been voided in the city , officials said . &quot; This is certainly a victory , not just for me but for the voters , &quot; said Uranga , who filed the lawsuit challenging the outcome . &quot; This was a fight for truth in the election process. &quot; As part of the agreement , Long_Beach officials acknowledged that the city clerk ' s office made errors on election night , including mistakenly allowing some improper votes to be tallied , said Assistant City Atty . Robert E . Shannon . Therefore , he said , the city will pay the candidates ' legal_fees as well as the expense of a special election , expected to be about $ 65 # 000 . &quot; The fact that we ' re being forced to have a new election is ludicrous , &quot; Donelon said . &quot; The election process , both on the state and local levels , is so flawed that it ' s easy for improper votes to be counted . I feel I won the election , but illegal votes were cast by unknowing people. &quot; Uranga , former president of the Long_Beach Children ' s Museum , had seemed the victor by a 29-vote margin on election night . But her lead was wiped_out during a June 22 recount , when previously uncounted ballots were found . Uranga challenged Donelon ' s narrow victory in court , contending among other things that ballots were improperly tallied and improper votes accepted . The case went_to trial last week , but Superior_Court Judge Judith C . Chirlin halted proceedings Thursday to allow attorneys and the city to try to work_out an agreement . On Wednesday , Chirlin accepted the agreement to schedule a special election . The Long_Beach City_Council had voted unanimously in closed_session Friday to support the new election . &quot; ( The agreement ) saved a lot of aggravation on the part of truly third_parties , who had no personal stake in this , other_than fany resident of the 7th District has in the accuracy of the ( elections ) , &quot; she said . The Long_Beach City_Council had voted unanimously in closed_session Friday to support the new election .</TEXT>
