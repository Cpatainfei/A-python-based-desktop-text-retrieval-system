   <HEADLINE> THE WEEK AHEAD : MADRID ; CLASH OVER LABOR LAWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Unions say they ' ll shut_down Spain for 24 hours Thursday in a general strike against government attempts to abolish labor laws that gave workers four decades of ironclad job security . The unions hope to force Prime_Minister Felipe Gonzalez to scotch new laws that make_it easier for employers to fire , transfer and change job descriptions of their workers.Foreign investors and Spanish businesses claim that the old laws are the main reason that Spain has Europe ' s highest jobless rate -- 23 % . Employers , they say , are encouraged to keep payrolls at a minimum because once-hired , never-fired laws mean they can ' t prune staff when the economy slows . Unions say loosening job protection won ' t create jobs but rather will enable employers to replace veteran workers with cheaper new ones .</TEXT>
