   <HEADLINE> OFFICIALS WEIGH PROPRIETY OF PAYING CITRON ' S LAWYER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As investigators trace how Orange County ' s financial crisis unfolded and explore the possibility of wrongdoing by former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron , officials are questioning whether they are obligated to foot the bill for Citron ' s legal expenses . Facing a statutory deadline , county officials said Saturday they are close to rejecting Citron ' s appeal for help in paying his mounting legal costs , because of a growing &quot; pattern of deception and misrepresentation &quot; in the former treasurer ' s investment practices . After a flurry of meetings and telephone_conversations late Friday , attorneys for Citron and the county worked_out a last-minute agreement to extend for 12 days the legal time frame for responding to Citron ' s request that his fees be covered , according to high-ranking county officials . County Counsel Terry C . Andrus said Saturday the county now has until Jan . 5 to reach a decision on whether to pay Citron ' s legal expenses , but declined to elaborate . &quot; To the extent that the county has any legal discretion , a decision will be based solely on what is in the best interest of the county and not anyone or anything else , &quot; Andrus said . Under state law , a public agency is required to defend and indemnify an employee for non-fraudulent acts or omissions that occur within the scope of employment , county officials said . In addition , the county ' s Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing may shield it from Citron ' s request that his legal_fees be paid , according to a source close to the case . Because the Chapter 9 filing protects the county from virtually all lawsuits , Citron might have to line_up with the county ' s numerous other creditors in_order to recoup legal_fees , the source said . Reached at his home Saturday , Citron declined to comment . His attorney , David Wiechert , did not return numerous telephone_calls to his home and office . * Supervisor William G . Steiner said he had not yet decided whether he believes the county should pay legal expenses for Citron , whose risky investment practices pushed the county into bankruptcy three weeks ago and imperiled the savings of 185 cities , school districts and other agencies . Citron ' s financial dealings are under investigation by the Orange County district_attorney , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the state_Department of Corporations , among others . As the investigations progress , &quot; things seem to be evolving from a question of poor judgment to more serious considerations , &quot; Steiner said in reference_to Citron . &quot; I ' d sure like to hear a more comprehensive explanation from his view , but maybe that won ' t come_out until the SEC and DA finish their investigations. &quot; Meanwhile , weary county officials grappled Christmas_Eve with the challenge of drumming_up holiday spirit after days of dealing with the financial crisis . &quot; It ' s the weirdest Christmas I think I ' ve ever been through , &quot; incoming Supervisor Marian Bergeson said as she fixed a Christmas_Eve feast for relatives . &quot; It ' s supposed to be such a happy time , and instead all_of this is going_on . It ' s tough on families. &quot; Bruce Bennett , the county ' s bankruptcy attorney , spent the day working_at his Los Angeles office . He spent about three hours sorting piles of mail that he has ignored during the past week and communicated via fax with other lawyers working_on the complex case . At the county administration complex in Santa Ana , most offices were locked and dark for the first weekend since the crisis began Dec . 1 . Parking lots were empty . Homeless people replaced the crowds of county officials , lawyers and anxious employees , who had traversed the plaza near the buildings throughout a week during which officials announced that hundreds of county workers may be laid_off as a result of sweeping budget_cuts . Near the entrance to the treasurer-tax collector ' s office , a group of charity workers distributed clothing to several dozen needy people . When Citron announced his resignation in a letter Dec . 4 , two days before the county ' s unprecedented bankruptcy filing , he orally requested help with any legal expenses he might incur , several county officials said . Nearly two weeks later , on Dec . 16 , Wiechert made the same request in a letter to Andrus , they said . By law , the county has 20 days after receiving a notification to rule on an employee ' s request . But because Citron made two requests , county officials were uncertain which one had started the statutory time_clock . If the 20-day period began with Citron ' s oral notification , the deadline would have been Friday and top county officials said Andrus was prepared to deny the former treasurer ' s request . * In a draft of a letter addressed to Citron ' s attorney that was not sent , Andrus cited a growing &quot; pattern of deception and misrepresentation &quot; involving the former treasurer ' s investment practices , sources said . Andrus has the authority to send the letter on_his_own , but the action would ultimately come_before the Board of Supervisors for formal approval , they said . But after eleventh-hour discussions with Wiechert , Andrus struck an agreement that made the Dec . 16 letter the official notification , giving him and other county officials until Jan . 5 to mull the issue over , sources said . During that period , county officials will ask Wiechert to share aspects of his defense strategy and explain why the county should not reject Citron ' s request for indemnification . Dist . Atty . Michael R . Capizzi ' s probe focuses_on whether Citron warned investors that the county ' s portfolio was losing value and how he planned to guard against losses . Investigators have also asked_for information on any contingency plans the county had to &quot; extricate &quot; itself from potential problems . The SEC , meanwhile , has subpoenaed many documents , including appointment_calendars , phone logs and campaign contribution material from Citron , all five county supervisors , County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider and top brokers for Merrill Lynch -- the county ' s top bond underwriter . The federal agency is seeking to determine whether the brokerage gave campaign contributions or provided kickbacks to county officials in exchange for business , sources close to the investigation have said . The SEC and the Department of Corporations also are trying to determine whether Citron plunged the county an additional $ 600 million into debt during the summer to cover mounting losses in the investment pool . * Some city and school district officials have claimed that Citron misled them and gave them false assurances that their money was invested in a safe bond pool . Those officials said Citron never disclosed the ailing health and risks of the investment pool . Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F . Riley , who steps_down from his post next month , said he was not aware of an effort by the county to avoid paying the former treasurer ' s legal costs . Riley , who was preparing to attend Christmas_Eve services with his family Saturday , said he could not comment on how he would vote on the legal_fees issue . &quot; I don ' t want to answer that . I would want to hear what the reasons , challenges and rules are_on this before making a decision. &quot; Other supervisors and Supervisor-elect Jim Silva could not be reached for comment Saturday . * Bergeson , the Republican state_senator from Newport Beach who was elected to Riley ' s seat on the board , said she , too , needs more concrete information about Citron ' s activities as treasurer before making a determination on the issue . &quot; We need to get a clearer understanding of the role he actually played , &quot; Bergeson said . &quot; From what I ' ve heard to this point , I think there were illegal activities involved , by virtue of the state laws that were not being followed &quot; in Citron ' s investment practices . &quot; It ' s really incredible to think that the hostility has gotten_to this point , &quot; Bergeson said . &quot; I just hope the healing of this county starts pretty soon. &quot; Times staff writers Lee Romney and Jodi Wilgoren contributed to this report . * CIRCLE OF MONEY Investigators track dealings of O.C. officials and bankers .
