   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : KEEPING DOLLAR ABOVE 100 YEN SEEN AS CRUCIAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration has finally decided to come_to the aid of the falling dollar , partly in the name of stock and bond market stability . Yet on Wall_Street , many pros argue that the dollar would n ' t be in its current predicament if the Administration hadn ' t ordered a de_facto devaluation earlier this year , as part of the undeclared trade war with Japan . And some experts question whether support for the buck will mean all that much to stock and bond investors , many of whom have far bigger concerns at this point . On Friday , at the Treasury ' s direction , the Federal_Reserve_Bank of New York jumped into the currency market to buy dollars when it appeared that the dollar would break_through the 100 yen level for the first time in post-World War II history . The dollar closed_in New York at 101.50 yen Friday , up from 101.35 on Thursday and well above the low of 100.65 reached Friday just before the Fed began to buy . The U.S. currency ' s weakness actually has been ongoing for months , but its decline has been almost completely overshadowed by the turmoil in_stocks and bonds . Since Jan . 1 , the dollar has tumbled from 111.60 yen , a drop of 9 % . Against the German mark , the dollar has slumped from 1.738 marks to 1.654 , a drop of 5 % . It ' s also down nearly 6 % against the_Swiss franc and the Italian_lira . Unless they ' ve traveled overseas or bought a big-ticket foreign-made product , however , most Americans probably haven ' t been aware of the dollar ' s devaluation . But the White_House has decided that enough is enough , apparently for two reasons , analysts say : * Already shocked by the surge in long-term bond yields this year , the Administration fears that bond traders could seize_on the weak dollar to whip_up more inflation hysteria and push yields even higher . A falling dollar , after all , boosts prices of goods imported to the United States . * A slide in the dollar below the psychologically important 100-yen level could prove far too destabilizing for Japan , especially with yet another new and struggling government in place there . In fact , the most intriguing aspect of the Administration ' s new approach to currency markets is that it may signal the end of the 2-month-old effort to pry open Japan ' s consumer and industrial markets with a dramatically weaker dollar , which automatically lowers prices of U.S. exports to Japan . &quot; I see this as the start of a more positive approach by the Administration to the U.S.-Japan trade dispute , &quot; says Steven Nagourney , global portfolio strategist at Lehman Bros . in New York . Practically speaking , with the new government of Prime_Minister Tsutomo Hata on extremely shaky ground , bashing Japan further with a lower dollar would seem to be a futile effort anyway , if the goal is to force a negotiated settlement of America ' s trade beefs . &quot; Japanese political unrest is endemic now , &quot; warns Donald Straszheim , chief economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . in New York . &quot; There ' s nobody to negotiate a trade deal with . &quot; It may also have become evident to the White_House , experts say , that the decision to use the dollar ' s value as a weapon against Japan has had unintended effects -- mainly in triggering or at least abetting a slide in the buck against key European currencies . &quot; There ' s been an erosion of confidence in exactly what the Administration has_in_mind for the dollar , &quot; says Eric Nickerson , senior economist at Bank of America in San Francisco . That translates into &quot; a tendency for the dollar to sag against all other currencies &quot; as well , he says , because &quot; the speculation ( on the market ' s part ) is that no one cares. &quot; For foreign investors , buying assets denominated in a weak currency is a losing game : Each time the currency declines in value , their assets shrink accordingly . The irony is that , based solely on economic fundamentals , the dollar should have been the world ' s strong currency this year . The U.S. economy is growing , while Japan and much of Europe remain mired in recession or close to it . By definition , a healthy economy should beget a healthy currency by attracting investment and engendering confidence . What ' s more , the Fed ' s decision to raise interest_rates this year to moderate the economy ' s pace should have attracted yield-hungry foreign investors to U.S. fixed-income securities , thereby boosting demand for dollars . But potential foreign buyers of U.S. securities may have been put_off by more_than the Administration ' s dollar policy , experts say . The violent dumping of stocks and bonds by U.S. investors since January , as the Fed ' s credit-tightening unraveled years of hidden speculation in the markets , also may have caused foreigners to think_twice about the true value of dollar-denominated assets . To put it simply , if Americans are fleeing their own stocks and bonds , why should foreigners be attracted to those securities ? At the same time , Americans ' appetite for foreign stocks , mostly via foreign-stock mutual_funds , has remained remarkably strong this year . After a hiccup in_demand in March , many fund companies say foreign stock funds were hot products again in April . Every dollar sent overseas is a dollar sold in favor of another currency . All told , the reasons for the dollar ' s weakness are obvious in retrospect , analysts say . The question now is whether the Fed and the Administration can succeed in at least stabilizing the buck , if not strengthening it . Perhaps more important for the average investor , would a healthier dollar be bullish for U.S. markets ? Many experts say that , given the awful sentiment in the bond market -- where long-term yields jumped again last week on inflation fears -- a more robust dollar could be a meaningful help there . A turnaround in the dollar would allay worries about imported inflation and could lure more foreigners to U.S. bonds , perhaps just in time for the Treasury ' s huge mid-May sale of notes and bonds , says Lehman Bros. ' Nagourney . A higher dollar could likewise pump up foreign demand for U.S. stocks , because an appreciating currency provides automatic gains for foreign owners of assets denominated in that currency . The flip side , however , is that a rising dollar would make U.S. exports more expensive overseas . That could be negative for the export-dependent industrial and technology companies whose stocks have led the bull_market over the past year . And some Wall Streeters maintain that the dollar is the least of the markets ' worries . Of far greater concern is how high the Fed will ultimately raise interest_rates , and whether corporate earnings will continue to grow at a pace brisk enough to support stock prices . Even so , the dollar ' s moves figure into both of those equations as well , experts note . Overall , economist Henry Gailliot at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh figures that it isn ' t as important for the dollar to rise here as it is for the currency to stop falling . &quot; The dollar going_up 5 % or 10 % is not as good ( for markets ) as another drop of 5 % or 10 % is bad for them , &quot; he says . * Searching for Bond Buyers : The $ 7.7 billion net cash outflow from bond mutual_funds in March , reported last week by the funds ' trade group , is raising the specter of another long famine ahead for the funds . The last time investors pulled so_much out of bond funds in one month was in October , 1987 . Then , as now , market interest_rates were rising and bond fund share prices were falling . Also , the rush of money out of bond funds in late 1987 and in 1988 followed a dramatic surge of cash_in 1985-86 . As the accompanying chart shows , the cash flows into bond funds between 1991 and 1993 rivaled that 1985-86 surge . What ' s also important to note is that in the last cycle , investors failed to return to bond funds in significant numbers until 1991 -- even though the Fed began allowing short-term interest_rates to drop beginning in early 1989 . Coincidentally , long-term bond yields remained stubbornly high until 1991 . All of this suggests that , when investors begin to exit bond funds , they stay away for a long_time . And without this major source of buying power to compete for bonds , long-term yields can stay higher than you ' d expect for a long_time as well . Bond Fund Flows : ' 80s Redux ? Bond fund investors have begun to yank money out of the funds as interest_rates have risen and fund share prices have eroded . After three years of huge cash inflows , a repeat of the late-1980s experience may be imminent . Cash inflows all but dried_up in those years . Net new cash flow into bond funds .
