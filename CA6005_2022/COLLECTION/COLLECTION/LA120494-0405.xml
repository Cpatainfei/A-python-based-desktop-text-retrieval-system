   <TEXT> With straight brown hair , blue eyes and a broad smile , Ryan Arnold had always been able to clunk into a room wearing huge sneakers and a floppy T-shirt and charm almost anyone . But last year when he turned 12 , his temperament shifted . His grades plummeted , he started smoking and he took long bike trips along the railroad_tracks , past the old factories and warehouses in Martinez , a small_town near Walnut Creek . Patricia Arnold , who had chosen to rear him alone , was shocked . &quot; He had always been my little buddy ; so good , &quot; she recalls . &quot; I had a 20-year plan in mind for how his life would go and this kind of behavior wasn ' t in the blueprint . I was scared of him. &quot; It didn ' t take long for Ryan ' s teachers to suggest that he might be emotionally disturbed . His grandfather offered to pay_for anything that might straighten the boy out : doctors , medicine , even a psychiatric group home . &quot; We knew there was something seriously wrong with him , &quot; says Arnold . &quot; I wanted an explanation , a diagnosis , and I became passionate about finding one. &quot; A psychologist found to have mild emotional and learning difficulties . He became one of an increasing number of American boys -- more_than 1.7 million in all -- who have been declared emotionally disturbed or educationally disabled . This is a particularly male problem , and just one aspect of a crisis that frightens parents and anyone else who deals with boys . Emotionally disturbed boys outnumber girls nearly 4 to 1 . For learning disabilities , the ratio is more_than 2 to 1 . Boys clog the court system , fill juvenile detention centers and threaten public safety . Juvenile arrests for violent crimes -- which almost always involve males -- increased by 50 % between 1987 and 1991 . The murder rate for teens -- victims are almost all male -- is up 104 % from 20 years ago , and last year , nearly 7 # 000 boys between ages 15 and 24 were killed . The American boy has become so frightening that many states are moving to lower the age when criminal defendants can be tried as adults . Experts across the nation are struggling to explain what is happening . In a spate of new books , they offer competing explanations -- from absent fathers to the evils of technology -- to account_for the troubled state of American boys . Altogether , the research suggests that today ' s boys -- deeply distressed and tragically misunderstood -- may be victims of_their_own biology and society ' s confusion about masculinity . &quot; This is a complex issue because there are several things going_on that are all true , &quot; says Dr. Judith Rapoport , chief of the child psychiatry branch at the National Institute of Mental Health . Rapoport uses magnetic_resonance_imaging to map the brains of developing children and hunt for neurological factors that make boys different from girls . The MRIs can show brain damage , differences in the size of parts of the brain and even differences in the neurological connections called synapses . Based on what is known , Rapoport says , &quot; it ' s clear that boys ' brains may be more vulnerable , and they do get these ( psychiatric ) diseases more often. &quot; Biology ' s influence may be significant , but Rapoport also suspects there ' s a strong social component to the troubled-boy phenomenon . Sometimes a boy like Ryan Arnold isn ' t sick . Sometimes he is just going_through a difficult adolescence at a time when society looks askance at all male aggression . &quot; We have to ask if society is more intolerant about males and more ready to label them as medical cases , &quot; says Rapoport . It is possible , she adds , that aggression and other masculine traits -- including many that were once admired -- have been so &quot; pathologized &quot; that today Tom_Sawyer would be labeled as disturbed . Our changing attitude toward boys can be seen in the way young males are portrayed in the media and discussed in everyday conversation . Bad men and boys are increasingly the staples of television talk_shows . And , of course , the news is_full of male rapists and murderers . Boys are portrayed as the drug pushers in public_service announcements . They are the danger lurking on city streets . Even the simple phrase &quot; boys will be boys &quot; carries a more ominous meaning now since it ' s the title of a recent book about male violence . All this evidence suggests that , to some degree , society believes that boys are , by definition , bad . In some cases , when the experts send boys to treatment and special_education , they may be acting_out of fear and anti-boy prejudice . &quot; Males are now regarded_as ' The Problem ' and people look_at boys as if their masculinity is something to be cured , or overcome , &quot; says David Blankenhorn , author of &quot; Fatherless America , &quot; which will be published next year by Basic Books , and president of the private Institute for American Values of New York , which conducts research and analysis of family issues . He argues that many boys are being victimized by adult standards that are heavily freighted with feminist politics . &quot; This is especially true in schools , &quot; he adds . &quot; Schools are institutions run_by women in which women and girls are seen as disadvantaged and boys are seen as a toxic problem . In school , the goal of getting girls to achieve is wonderful . The goal for boys is making them behave. &quot; While some boys are no doubt misunderstood , it is clear that a great number are truly troubled . One measure of this distress is that juvenile suicide , always more common among boys , peaked in 1977 , and the rate is still more_than three times the rate it was in 1960 . Boys are the subject of broad research by social_scientists looking_at the ways that parents , schools and other institutions may be failing them . In the meantime , hard science has begun to focus_on the difference in male and female brains . Once a neglected area , the comparative study of the brain has been energized by new technology and a cadre of scientists willing to say that sex differences are real . Some researchers are so impressed by what they are learning that they suggest it may be biologically impossible for many boys to meet the modern standard of behavior . In such cases , they say , boys may be penalized simply for being boys . Research scientist Laura Allen begins her study of the brain in autopsy labs at hospitals throughout Southern California . A UCLA neuroanatomist , she collects brain tissue samples from cadavers and returns to her lab to continue her studies on gender differences . During the past decade , Allen has contributed substantially to a growing body of knowledge about brain function . &quot; It used to be accepted that men and women process information the same way . We now know that is not true , &quot; she says . &quot; The entire brain is different at a very subtle level , at least. &quot; In the 1980s , Allen ' s research confirmed that a critical part of the brain responsible_for passing information from one hemisphere to the other -- the corpus_callosum -- is larger in females . Two other parts of the brain that perform a similar function , she discovered , are also larger in women . Other researchers have shown that boys ' brains mature more slowly , especially the frontal_lobes , which handle many social and cognitive functions . Scientists generally agree that high levels of the male hormone testosterone , which are necessary to transform a fetus into a boy , are causing this difference . Allen ' s colleague , neuroendocrinologist Roger Gorski , has pioneered research showing how hormones affect mammalian brains , especially the parts that control sexual_activity . Gorski has used hormone injections to induce female rats to behave like rutting males , and to make males behave like receptive females in heat . In normal rats , natural levels of male and female hormones create substantial structural differences in the part of the brain that controls sexual behavior . &quot; Since sex and aggression are very , very close , &quot; notes Gorski , &quot; these differences may have an impact beyond sex. &quot; The effect of biology on intellectual functioning has been widely noted . Several studies have shown that scores on certain tests of mental_abilities go_up and down depending_on the levels of hormones in a subject ' s body . Likewise , little_girls with elevated testosterone levels are more likely to choose the toys that boys prefer : sports_cars , trucks and Lincoln Logs . But the differences extend beyond hormones to the actual functioning of the brain . Scientists have discovered , for example , that women use more of their brain in the task of spelling than men . The research , and her own experience with her son and daughter , have convinced Allen that biology is perhaps the central factor_in the problems of boys . &quot; I have a little boy in kindergarten , &quot; she says . &quot; My son is a good little boy , but he cannot be expected to be just like a well-behaved little_girl . Boys need parents to be a lot more understanding. &quot; Allen is not alone in her assessment . Laboratories across the country are uncovering neurological clues to boys ' behavior problems . These discoveries suggest that some boys are not to blame if they cannot meet our rising expectations of civility . &quot; We actually know quite a bit about the brain and these behavioral disturbances , &quot; says neuropsychologist Ruben Gur , who leads a brain study team at the University of Pennsylvania . &quot; Anyone in science who doesn ' t know this must be sleeping. &quot; For example , psychologists and educators have long known that girls excel_at communication and social skills . Boys have been observed to be more aggressive and physical . Girls tend to be more cooperative and reflective . Many parents would likely agree with these generalities . Now there ' s emerging evidence that the stereotypical behavior is caused by differences in the brain , differences that Gur and others have documented with magnetic_resonance_imaging . The MRI pictures and post-mortem studies show some intriguing variations . Females seem to have more gray_matter , the active brain_cells that perform thinking . The rate of blood flow in the female brain is faster , adds Gur , and the electrical activity in women ' s brains also seems to be faster . Also , males tend to activate both sides of their brain for a given type of problem , he says , while females tend to be &quot; lateralized &quot; thinkers , restricting activity to one side or the other . &quot; Stated simply , &quot; says Gur , &quot; women run hotter and are more revved-up. &quot; He theorizes that this extra activity makes_it easier for women to score high on tests of communication and social skills . Women , for example , are much better at identifying the emotions a person shows in a photograph . Men , with their ability to concentrate activity in one side of the brain , dominate fields such_as mathematics , which require this kind of thinking . &quot; It ' s all_in the way we are wired , &quot; Gur says . Different wiring may also explain why boys are far more likely to have learning and behavior problems . It turns_out that baby boys are more vulnerable to minor brain damage -- during birth or because of later injury -- than girls . Scientists guess that this is because higher levels of testosterone make the male brain less resilient . Testosterone may also delay the development of certain spheres of the brain critical to social skills and communication . If these areas are injured , boys are less able to heal or adapt . It may be these tiny injuries that cause the most common brain disorder found in boys -- Attention_Deficit_Disorder , which can manifest itself in the form of failure at school , aggression and even criminal behavior . &quot; A child like this becomes frustrated , associates learning with failure and becomes aggressive , &quot; Gur says . &quot; They are not simply bad boys . It ' s not that easy . They might have ADD and act_out in frustration. &quot; The diagnosis of ADD ( formerly called hyperactivity ) involves as much art as science . Doctors and therapists tend to look_for a variety of behavior problems , among them fidgeting , distraction , impulsiveness and excessive talking . All can get a boy into a lot of trouble at school . But they don ' t necessarily mean that he is emotionally disturbed or a social deviant . In fact , the act of labeling a child disturbed or disabled may do more harm than good . &quot; These kids are identified as problems in most schools often by the second grade , &quot; notes psychiatrist John Ratey , who is also a Harvard assistant_professor of psychiatry . &quot; This happens quickly because schools today emphasize cooperative learning and social skills . But these kids can ' t do_it . They are identified as a problem and then everybody treats them differently . Teachers aren ' t the same with the kids who aren ' t so nice . Parents with_children in these schools try to avoid having their kids placed in the same classroom. &quot; Often , these seemingly unruly children are reprimanded , counseled and punished . Their trouble may be linked to a male tendency toward ADD and other brain-based problems . If it is ADD , the stimulant Ritalin may be enough to quiet a boy down and keep him on track in school . Teachers and school administrators are often the first to recommend Ritalin , and some districts have even gone_to court to argue that a child be given the medicine by his parents . Sometimes children are treated with talking therapy , other stimulants , or anti-depressive drugs . In the past few years , as scientific findings about brain development and gender have reached a wider audience , more and more children are being treated , notes Ratey . He ought to know . As author of &quot; Driven to Distraction , &quot; a widely praised new book on attention deficit , Ratey has helped put ADD in the vernacular . &quot; ADD has become the diagnosis of the decade , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s the Prozac of the ' 90s ; everybody ' s interested in it. &quot; Ratey and other specialists report a growing number of children and adults coming_to them for treatment -- drugs and / or psychotherapy -- and finding relief after years of struggling with problems apparently caused by undiagnosed ADD . Though Ritalin is not without side_effects ( those include loss of appetite , sleep disturbances and reports of slowed growth_rates when used for long periods ) , it ' s been widely embraced by parents and counselors . One measure of its popularity : the U.S. drug industry ' s production of Ritalin has risen 300 % since 1990 . Yet Ratey suspects that many cases of ADD are still undiagnosed and many boys misunderstood . &quot; ADD is not the only cause of boys ' problems , &quot; he adds , &quot; but it ' s a very important factor , and once it ' s diagnosed and treated , the change can be dramatic. &quot; The diagnosis of a mild attention deficit for Ryan Arnold was not severe enough to merit drug therapy . Instead , he was counseled for one hour each week , and his mother established a more ordered routine at_home . A few months later , Ryan ' s school performance improved . But he remains aggressive , unpredictable and fidgety . In Martinez , on a Sunday afternoon when he would rather be outside with his friends , Ryan is more_than a little impatient when his mother invites him to sit and chat . He arrives in the room pushing his trail bike and dressed in baggy blue striped shorts and a huge gray T-shirt . He leans the bike against a wall and looks_out the window at the street before sitting_down and squirming in his chair . &quot; Excuse me , sir . I don ' t mean to be rude . But is this going_to take long ? &quot; Ryan struggles through a_few minutes of conversation . In one breath he angrily criticizes a therapist he has seen . &quot; I hate Don , &quot; he says . His mother cuts him off with an urgently whispered &quot; Ryan ! &quot; A moment later , Ryan offers to massage his mother ' s sore neck . He recalls enjoying school until fourth grade , when he began to feel bored and restless . &quot; Right now baseball is my life . My teachers say they don ' t understand me . I don ' t know why they are baffled . I ' m just trying to be myself . Can I go now ? &quot; When Ryan again looks anxiously out the window , his mother dismisses him so that he can join a friend waiting_on the sidewalk . After he ' s gone , Patricia Arnold says she does not believe that ADD is the real cause of her son ' s troubles . One of Ryan ' s therapists , Don Elium , has suggested that the boy suffers from a lack of firm guidance and male role_models . Boys need to be around men who can show them how to contain and control their naturally aggressive impulses , says Elium . This makes_sense to Arnold , who first learned about this theory in Elium ' s book , &quot; Raising a Son. &quot; Elium , a marriage , child and family counselor , teaches psychology at John F . Kennedy University in Orinda , near Oakland . Elium would say it ' s not only difficult but also dangerous for a boy to be raised outside the company of men . However , with single-mother households increasing and divorce splitting half of all marriages , legions of boys are coming of_age today without a constant male role_model . At the same time , boyish behavior that was once considered normal -- aggression , defiance , mischievousness , risk-taking -- is gradually being redefined as pathological . If boys are in_trouble , says Elium , it ' s because too many men have abandoned their sons , and adults in_general are failing to help boys meet a social standard that requires them to be more cooperative . &quot; Many women , feminists especially , are afraid that masculinity will run wild and become life-threatening , &quot; adds Jeanne Elium , Elium ' s wife and co-author of &quot; Raising a Son. &quot; &quot; Many mothers are afraid of the aggressiveness in boys . Our son began staring me down when he was about 3 years old . I thought , ' Oh , my God , what do I do now ? ' I didn ' t understand him. &quot; The Eliums believe that many mothers and teachers don ' t understand the natural assertiveness in boys . However , they are often responsible_for teaching them to be more sensitive and considerate . This is necessary , so that boys can be successful , but this civilizing process must be done with great_care . Too often , they say , boys are made to feel inferior or even disturbed . This notion that males are bad is reinforced by a stream of feminist thought that argues that women are natural peacemakers while male aggression -- in the form of patriarchy -- is the main source of war , pollution , poverty , virtually every kind of suffering in the world . &quot; Good feminism helps boys with feelings and relationships , but harsh views about boys being awful creatures and jokes about testosterone poisoning hurt rather than help , &quot; argues Priscilla Vail , a New York educator and author of books on child development . &quot; Bad feminism has eroded our willingness to respect differences in males and females . Boys do need something different than girls . And if we start diagnosing every boy who throws a rock through the window , we ' re in trouble. &quot; &quot; Boys take_apart things , they crash around a room , they seem more out of control , &quot; says Don Elium . The Eliums prize the energy of boys who may seem overly rambunctious . They describe that energy as a natural , exciting and potentially creative force . The problem is , &quot; boys are often made to feel ashamed that they can ' t act more like girls , ashamed of being boys , &quot; says Don Elium . &quot; But if you try to kill these impulses rather than mold them , you create boys that are either murderous or suicidal. &quot; He suggests that boys be given more outlets for their impulses . In school this might mean longer recesses , to let boys burn_off steam . Teachers must also understand the difficulties boys have with such tasks as reading , sitting still and working cooperatively . Some teachers do try to accommodate boys , for instance , by touching them often to calm them down , or letting a hyperactive boy stand_in the back of a classroom when he can no longer sit still . At home , Elium hopes that fathers will play a stronger role in their sons ' lives , showing them that male assertiveness doesn ' t have to devolve into brutish behavior . Single mothers can also help their sons with this task . But the key , according to the Eliums , is found in male role_models . The vision of a world in which boys have access to the time and attention of male role_models is appealing , yet , say some critics , it ' s fraught with real-world complexities that make_it practically impossible to realize . &quot; There are not a lot of wonderful men out there , &quot; says New York family therapist Olga Silverstein , &quot; and the fact is , a lot of women have to raise sons alone . They have no choice . To say they must have men to help is ridiculous. &quot; Silverstein helped bring feminist concepts to the family therapy movement in the ' 70s , and according to the theories she puts_forward in her book &quot; The Courage to Raise Good Men , &quot; with the disappearance of men from their lives , boys need more attention from their mothers . &quot; Mothers have abandoned their sons because they think they can ' t raise them well , or they will turn them into sissies if they maintain a close relationship . But if mothers pull_away , then who is the boy left with ? No one . He raises himself , and we are seeing the results. &quot; Boys get_into trouble mainly because they don ' t know how to relate to other people , argues Silverstein . Mothers who want to create strong and self-sufficient sons fail to become attached_to them in an emotional relationship that teaches them empathy for other human_beings . Without empathy , says Silverstein , &quot; we wind_up with boys who are shooting each other. &quot; Silverstein ' s book describes how parents , especially mothers , have trained their sons to be highly competitive and self-absorbed . These mothers , eager to prevent their sons from becoming &quot; Mama ' s boys , &quot; push them away at an early age . &quot; Why would we be surprised , then , that boys turn_out to be more violent and that men have abandoned the family ? We train them to do that , and it works. &quot; Instead of leaving a boy alone , or handing him off to a macho-man father figure , Silverstein advises mothers to bond with their sons and maintain a respectful but close relationship into adulthood . Patti Kubasek and her son Chris discovered the value of this kind of relationship last year . At the time , 14-year-old Chris was sliding into truancy and gang activity in the months that followed his father ' s death from cancer . His grades fell , he got_into fights at school and he was caught with a knife . He also began hanging_around with suburban gangbangers in Martinez . &quot; My mom and I would fight twice a day . Everything she did drove me nuts , &quot; recalls Chris , a blond-haired boy who is so tall that an easy_chair barely contains his arms and legs . &quot; I wasn ' t exactly nice to anyone. &quot; After her husband died , she and Chris had &quot; talked a lot about his father , &quot; Kubasek says . &quot; He took me from one room of the house to another , stopping to talk_about him in each room. &quot; But in her grief , she had thrown herself into work and the pursuit of a college degree , abandoning her relationship with her son . Trying to renew it , she read books about mothers and sons and brought Chris to a therapist . They started to talk and she realized how sad her son had been . As Chris began to see that his mother was serious about trying to restore their relationship , he gradually calmed_down . Over time , and with the intervention of his mother and counselors , he left his gang friends . Now he ' s thriving again at school . Chris says his mother ' s openness was all-important in his decision to restore his life . &quot; When she showed me how much she really cared , &quot; he says , &quot; it really made a difference. &quot; A close mother-son relationship will produce a man who understands others , controls his aggressive impulses and communicates successfully , says Silverstein . This kind of boy will be as different in his outlook on life as today ' s girls are different from their grandmothers . &quot; We have broken the gender barrier when it comes_to girls and careers . They feel comfortable at_work and at_home . Now we have to let boys back into the family emotionally . that ' s what they need . To say that they can ' t be helped because of their nature is a great rationalization . I refuse to accept it , because if you do , there is no hope for the future. &quot; The help of at least one parent is vital when all_of society is conspiring to turn boys into brutes , adds Angela Phillips , who fears that men are in danger of becoming the &quot; rogue_elephants &quot; of the human_race , admitted to family life for the purpose of mating only . Phillips , who specializes in writing_about children and family_relationships , agrees with Silverstein when it comes_to boys who have been emotionally abandoned and have no secure attachment to their families . But she goes one step further . &quot; Lessons in violence , indifference and separation are provided every day for every male_child , &quot; Phillips argues in &quot; The Trouble With Boys. &quot; &quot; Learning them is part of learning to survive as a boy. &quot; Indeed , a boy who is not deemed sufficiently aggressive , who likes beautiful , soft or cuddly toys , may be considered effeminate and referred for counseling by his parents . In contrast , the femininity of a female_child is rarely questioned . &quot; A girl can dress_up as a fairy princess or wears sneakers and jeans and no one will worry about her femininity. &quot; It should be no wonder that boys are troubled when their natural aggression runs_up against modern standards of behavior . Surviving as a boy may get more difficult as the post-industrial world becomes more complex and brawn becomes a devalued asset . Where once a man who had trouble communicating could make a good wage in a steel_mill , writes Phillips , he is now frustrated because the steel_mills are closed and he has no aptitude for high-tech work . Some boys look_at these men and , rightly or wrongly , conclude that the world no longer holds a place for them . Phillips argues that poor males who lack communication skills naturally seek an identity in the culture of street violence , where strength is still valued . The sense of failure &quot; is reinforced by the level of information they need to process and the high stress levels in modern life , &quot; observes Charlotte Tomaino , who runs a group practice in New York called Neuropsychological Services of Westchester . Tomaino , who has treated hundreds of patients with brain-related disorders , says society ' s rules about acceptable behavior and the skills required to succeed are changing too fast for some boys to keep_up . &quot; It ' s like survival_of_the_fittest , only the fittest will be the people who have good impulse control , can orchestrate events , organize things and focus their attention , &quot; says Tomaino . All these skills appear to be located in the frontal_lobe of the brain , which develops much more slowly in boys , according to some researchers . This could mean that boys are being judged by a standard that is harder and harder for them to reach , she says . &quot; Twenty years ago , no one had to do many of the things we must now do with technology and communication , &quot; she says . &quot; Our institutions are more complex and difficult . I ' m concerned that we ' re going to have many_more of these boys in the future. &quot; The partisans in the struggle to understand boys can each point to children who have been helped by one approach or another . Psychotherapists can offer_up patients who improve with a variety of interventions , from better fathering to behavior_modification therapy . At the same time , neuroscientists note that many boys with ADD improve when their brains are dosed with chemicals , though they ' ve not yet found chemical solutions for the wide range of disorders facing children and young_men . While they may disagree about the cause and treatment , none of the various schools of research would argue with the notion that boys are in a kind of crisis , and that their emotional and educational disabilities burden families and communities . Many of those who research and treat boys ' problems are beginning to see the appeal of an approach that takes into consideration both the nature of the boy child and the way we nurture them . Even an ardent &quot; hard &quot; scientist , such_as Laura Allen , acknowledges that the way a boy is raised can overcome certain genetic tendencies . &quot; In a study at Berkeley they followed boys who were given lots of attention in the first 18 months and those who were not , &quot; she notes . Years later , the boys who were given more affection scored higher on IQ_tests . These findings seem to refute those who look_at IQ and other measures of cognition and declare that biology is destiny . &quot; Boys seem to benefit from more one-on-one attention , &quot; says Allen . &quot; I think the affection may change the sex_hormone level in the brain , which then affects brain development. &quot; On the other hand , boys also seem to be more damaged by problems within a family , especially divorce , at least in the short run . Allen even wonders if boys may be more vulnerable to the loss of parental attention inherent with day_care . &quot; I worry about day_care because infants need a lot of cuddling to develop and I ' m not sure you can get that kind of nurturing by paying_for it , &quot; she says . Despite the scientific advances , the complexity of human behavior makes the diagnosis of and treatment of emotional problems difficult . &quot; You can ' t just treat all these kids with Ritalin and then , because they slow_down , declare that that was the problem all along , &quot; says Paul McHugh , chairman of the psychiatry department at Johns Hopkins Medical_School in Baltimore . &quot; Ritalin will slow almost any kid down . And a lot of kids who supposedly have neurologically based ADD can ' t sit still in school but they can watch TV for two hours . That tells me that we ' re too impressed by our biological discoveries and using them to explain things without taking_into_account other factors. &quot; McHugh insists that how boys are treated has a much greater effect on their behavior than brain structure . &quot; Boys have a genetic influence to be aggressive . But if you raise them a certain way , that will assert itself as leadership or entrepreneurial skill . If he is raised in another environment that is not as nurturing , he may become violent . That is why broken families have more of these problems . It ' s harder for them to provide the right environment. &quot; A parent who is aware of a boy ' s special needs can help him from an early age . Steve Brooks , a single father of a boy named Brandon , recognized that his son needed help when he seemed unable to conform_to the rules of the preschool he attended in the San Francisco Bay Area . &quot; I got constant phone_calls from school saying he was unruly and he couldn ' t concentrate. &quot; Brandon was dramatically different from his sister , Tarren , who had experienced little trouble adjusting to school and excelled_at working cooperatively . &quot; Tarren was eager to please and knew how to do_it , &quot; recalls Brooks . &quot; Brandon didn ' t have a clue. &quot; Although he wasn ' t found to have ADD , Brandon exhibited many of the traits and behaviors typical of boys who are . He dismantled anything that came_apart , including his own toys . He spoke out of turn , fought with other children and raced around . &quot; He sometimes would have rages and literally throw things around , &quot; Brooks says . &quot; It was hard for anyone , teachers included , to have enough patience to deal with him. &quot; During the past year , at the suggestion of his school_principal , Brandon received special_education classes . He got extra attention from his father . Both have helped him learn how to focus_on specific tasks , such_as schoolwork , and taught him how to interact with other children . Now 7 , Brandon seems to be thriving . But he is still a bundle of aggressive energy . On a recent Sunday morning he scampered in and out of his home half_a_dozen times in 15 minutes . Dressed in shorts and a T-shirt , he was a blur of activity , just like the Tasmanian devil on his shirt . &quot; We ' re building a house out there , &quot; he said to his dad , his voice filled with excitement . &quot; You should see it. &quot; The house , made of cardboard , was one of the many projects Brandon would tackle that weekend . None would exhaust his energy . &quot; People expect a_level of behavior from kids that is more civilized , more gentle , &quot; says Brooks . &quot; I ' m trying to give Brandon outlets for his energy while teaching him what ' s expected. &quot; He takes his son on long hikes and extended camping trips . He ' ll do almost anything to help his son learn the modern survival skills of self-control . Along the way , says Brooks , he has come_to admire the depth of his son ' s energy . &quot; I have to say I appreciate him , and I appreciate male power more in_general , &quot; he concludes . &quot; But Brandon has to live_in the modern_world , and he was running the risk of being stigmatized by his behavior . I had to save him from a lot of problems in the future. &quot;</TEXT>
