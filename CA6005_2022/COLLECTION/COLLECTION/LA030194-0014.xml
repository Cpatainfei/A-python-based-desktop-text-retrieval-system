   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / MICKEY EDWARDS : POLICY PUTS GOP BACK IN CONTROL ; WITHOUT RELYING_ON POLITICS OR PERSONALITIES , THE REPUBLICANS ARE SETTING THE NATIONAL AGENDA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Republicans , without the White_House , without either house of Congress , a political minority for most of the past half a century , are again seizing control of the national agenda . It began with Richard Thornburgh . Thornburgh was a popular governor of Pennsylvania , and after having picked_up some federal experience as attorney_general , he would have made a good U.S. senator . Instead , Thornburgh , a Republican , was defeated for a Senate seat by a Democrat named Harris Wofford , a distinct underdog , who had latched onto the public ' s anxiety about rising health-care costs . Republicans were dismayed . As it turns_out , however , Thornburgh ' s stunning loss may well prove to have been a blessing in disguise . When the heavily favored Thornburgh was sent crashing to defeat , Democrats across the country thought they had finally found the magic_bullet that would end Republican control of the White_House . When Bill_Clinton did_in fact win the presidency with health-care reform as one of his major issues , the Democrats were certain they had found the political equivalent of the death ray . Clinton immediately staked a good_part of his presidency on creating the national health-insurance program that had eluded both Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson . Once more , for the umpteenth time since 1920 , we were told that a comprehensive national health program was an idea whose time had come . The President showed his commitment to the effort by placing his wife in_charge . From every corner , policy wonks gathered . And on this roll of the dice , Bill_Clinton is about to come a cropper . For one thing , Clinton misread his election victory . Like Ronald Reagan , who mistakenly interpreted the public ' s rejection of Jimmy_Carter as a mandate for the entire Reagan legislative agenda , Clinton thought the voters were electing him when , in fact , they were unelecting George_Bush . And even then , 57 % of the voters cast their ballots for the two candidates who advocated neither a national health program nor a major expansion of government . The President ' s second major miscalculation was the belief that congressional Republicans would either draw_a_line in the sand and suggest that people who were not wealthy should simply be left to die , or simply spin about ineffectually , caught between right-wing rhetoric and political fear . In fact , Republicans had been hard at_work for more_than a year before Clinton ' s election trying to devise their own programs to deal with what they , too , perceived as problem areas in the nation ' s health-care system . They neither spun nor dithered . They came_forth with solid programs that made considerably more sense than did Clinton ' s . When one of conservatism ' s brightest new spokesmen , William Kristol , stated boldly that the country had health-care problems but no crisis -- a sentiment shared by the majority of Americans -- Republicans had found their voice , and Clinton ' s health plan began to lose steam rapidly . Now , Clinton ' s chickens are coming_home to roost . Rep . Pete Stark ( D-Oakland ) , the Ways and Means subcommittee chairman who gets first crack at the Clinton plan , has proclaimed large parts of it dead on arrival . And Stark , who is even more liberal than the President , says that all_the President will get is a smidgen of the program he sent to Capitol_Hill . At the same time , voters told pollsters that their principal concern was the high rate of violent crime in the nation ' s cities , precisely the message Republicans had been hammering home all through the Bush presidency . The best line of Clinton ' s State of the Union speech ( &quot; Three strikes and you ' re out , &quot; he told criminals ) was a Republican line . Liberal Democrats now see their President pushing a welfare-reform program that is a virtual carbon_copy of Republican initiatives . We are closer than ever to putting a balanced-budget amendment in the federal Constitution . The Administration ' s campaign to &quot; reinvent government &quot; is nothing more_than a stitching together of Republican reform proposals dating_back to the early days of the Reagan presidency . Republicans control no levers of power . They don ' t have the White_House , they don ' t have a single chairmanship in Congress , they have no consensus spokesman , but in the long_run what politics is all about is neither partisanship nor personality . It ' s about policy , and policy is a game the Republicans are winning .</TEXT>
