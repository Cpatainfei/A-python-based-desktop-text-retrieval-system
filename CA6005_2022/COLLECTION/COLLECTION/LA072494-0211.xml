   <HEADLINE> ADULT_EDUCATION ENTERS THE HIGH-TECH AGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Les Lane fell trying to climb without a ladder . To meet the demands of his bosses at a Moorpark T-shirt company , Lane scrambled up some shelves along a warehouse wall to retrieve stock . He slipped , severely breaking his ankle . Two years later , Lane is still unable to stand_for more_than 15 minutes at a time . So he spends his days at a task he had never envisioned for himself at 45 years old : training for a new career in computers . He considered attending a community_college or private computer institute , the traditional sites for such high-tech training . But he chose instead to enroll at a local adult school . Once viewed_as the province of students trying to catch_up on the basics such_as learning to speak English or finishing their high_school equivalency degrees , many adult schools are now becoming centers for teaching technology . As they move_into this arena , adult schools in Ventura County and around California increasingly are competing against colleges and private institutes for students such_as Lane who have been laid_off or disabled on_the_job . And Ventura Adult School , where Lane is enrolled , has been at the forefront of this statewide trend , a position state education officials credit to the leadership of Principal Barry Tronstad . When Tronstad took_over at Ventura Adult School in the late 1980s , the school ' s vocational offerings consisted mainly of routine courses in bookkeeping , word_processing and other office skills . Tronstad began quickly to revamp the program -- filling the school ' s classrooms with the latest models of computers , hiring teachers from industry and designing courses geared to a changing workplace . &quot; They were a pioneer , &quot; said Al Koshiyama , a state_Department of Education adult_education administrator . Besides being a leader among the state ' s 412 adult schools in offering technology classes , Ventura Adult School also stands_out because of its responsiveness to its community , Koshiyama said . &quot; Most adult programs just keep_on doing the same-old , same-old , year after year , &quot; he said . But Ventura Adult School has &quot; state-of-the-art vocational technical skill development. &quot; Ventura ' s adult_education program now offers courses ranging from computer-aided drafting to computerized accounting and computer animation . And it boasts an 80 % success rate at placing graduates in entry-level jobs in these fields . Ventura County has seven adult schools ranging_in size from the 100-student Fillmore Adult School to the 14 # 000-student school in Oxnard . All of the adult schools are run_by local school districts . Besides Ventura Adult School , the three other large adult schools in the county -- located in Thousand Oaks , Simi Valley and Oxnard -- also offer training for careers ranging from computerized bookkeeping to X-ray technology . But Ventura Adult School has gone the furthest in building a vocational_rehabilitation_program for injured or laid-off workers . Of the 9 # 500 students who attend Ventura Adult School each year , about 275 are disabled or laid-off workers . * By contrast , Oxnard Adult School has only about 75 such adults among its 14 # 000 students . Simi Valley Adult School ' s 11 # 500 students include only 80 who are there for vocational_rehabilitation . Besides any altruistic motivation to serve the disabled and the out-of-work , Ventura Adult School has another reason for shifting its focus -- cash . Because workers ' compensation funds and state and federal retraining programs pay tuition for disabled and laid-off employees to prepare_for new careers , they are a ready source of money for budget-strapped schools serving such adults . Ventura Adult School charges $ 700 per month , for example , for the computer-aided drafting course that Lane is taking . The course typically lasts about five months , bringing the total cost to about $ 5 # 000 . That is a big jump over the nominal fees for typical adult school classes , such_as the $ 48 that Ventura Adult School charges for a semester of conversational French . Overall , Ventura Adult School gets $ 850 # 000 , or more_than one-quarter of its annual $ 3-million budget , from its vocational_rehabilitation_program for disabled or laid-off workers . The school gets another $ 1.2 million per year from a special retraining program it runs at Camarillo State Hospital for adults confined to the institution . Simi Valley Adult School , by contrast , gets only $ 100 # 000 in fees each year from its vocational_rehabilitation courses . But the Simi Valley school , which has one of the widest selections of course offerings among the county ' s adult schools , gets_about $ 4.6 million from the state each year compared to only about $ 1 million in annual state funding for the adult_education program in Ventura . In light of such stagnant levels of state funding , Tronstad decided when he took_over Ventura Adult School that the only way to enhance the school ' s courses was to get money from other sources . So he began to contract with local insurance_companies and rehabilitation agencies to train their disabled or laid-off clients . Under state law , the school cannot use any of the money it receives from vocational_rehabilitation contracts to support other programs at the school . So it uses the funds from its Technology Development Center -- the name of its vocational_rehabilitation_program -- to pay the salaries of the center ' s 10 full-time teachers and to upgrade its equipment . The school spends roughly $ 200 # 000 each year on hardware and software for subjects ranging from computer animation to computer_graphics . Offering such courses allows the adult school to play a vital role in the community at a time when when midlife career changes are becoming the norm and employers are demanding an increasingly high level of skills from workers , Tronstad said . For students , adult schools frequently offer more individual attention and flexible hours than community_colleges or private institutes , some students at Ventura Adult School said . * Unlike schools that abide_by traditional academic_year calendars , students are able to enroll in any Technology Development Center ' s courses at any time during the year . Although students report to class during regular hours each day -- from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. for the computer-aided drafting course -- they work_at their own pace . Lane said he considered but dismissed the idea of enrolling at a community_college , where it takes two years to earn an associate ' s degree . &quot; You can ' t afford at my age to kick_back and go_to school for two years , &quot; he said . A onetime painting contractor and heavy-equipment operator , Lane has always made his living by the sweat of his brow . But a year after breaking his ankle , when even surgery failed to heal the pain , Lane faced the fact he had to train for work that he could do without standing or using his legs . When he earns his computer-aided drafting certificate in November , he hopes to land an entry-level job , most of which pay between $ 7 and $ 11.50 per hour . That would be less than what Lane earned in previous jobs , he said , but it would be far more_than the $ 187.50-per-week workers ' compensation payments that he has to live_on while he is in school . * Lane travels_to school from his home_in Carpinteria each day . Other students come from as far away as San Luis Obispo . &quot; I had never touched a computer , not even to play computer_games , &quot; Lane said . But he never forgets the seriousness of his situation . &quot; I ' m concentrating_on this , &quot; Lane said , gesturing toward his computer , &quot; because I don ' t have a backup. &quot; Margie Giallenardo , a 57-year-old Camarillo resident , worked as a waitress for 40 years before she slipped at the Newbury Park restaurant where she worked , breaking her hip and left arm . No longer able to lift heavy trays , she is now studying computerized bookkeeping at Ventura Adult School . Although she earned $ 15 an hour as a waitress , including tips , Giallenardo said she expects to get a bookkeeping job paying $ 8 to $ 12 per hour . &quot; I loved waitressing , &quot; she said . &quot; It was the only thing I knew. &quot; But she said she shares with her classmates a hopeful attitude about the future . &quot; Everybody has a pretty good attitude here . You ' re here because you want to be. &quot;</TEXT>
