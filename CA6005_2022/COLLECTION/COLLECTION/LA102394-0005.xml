   <HEADLINE> THE BUSINESS OF AMERICA ; COMEBACK : THE FALL AND RISE OF THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE_INDUSTRY , BY PAUL INGRASSIA AND JOSEPH B . WHITE ( SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER : $ 25 ; 496 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Calvin_Coolidge didn ' t say much , but his announcement that &quot; The business of America is business &quot; ought to be considered a worthy substitute for &quot; In God We Trust &quot; on our paper_money , since the closest thing to heaven for most Americans is a profitable bottom_line . Of all_the businesses in this country , the one that has been most closely identified with , and provided the economic underpinnings for , our national being is the manufacture of motor_vehicles , primarily automobiles . The success and failure of the Big Three American car_companies is measured almost daily by the media : as Detroit goes , so does a substantial portion of the American economy , and the American psyche . The decade of the 1980s was first boom and then bust for General Motors , Ford and Chrysler , all_of which suffered mightily at the hands of Japanese competitors and the hubris of their top_executives . As recounted in fascinating detail by Paul Ingrassia and Joseph B . White ( who cover the auto business for the Wall_Street Journal , where they won a Pulitzer Prize together for their stories on GM ) , all three companies had to lose billions of dollars , in two cases -- Chrysler and , incredibly , GM -- barely skirting total economic collapse before they recovered . That such large , established manufacturers could perform so miserably appears to have been the result of a narrow-minded executive elite enjoying its boom times by throwing corporate money around . That corporate chieftains are out of touch with middle- or working-class America is no surprise : to be picked_up by a waiting car on the Tarmac after a ride in a corporate jet is to enjoy a particularly pleasant form of social insulation . What you learn reading this book is that the perks are available down the pecking order . One doesn ' t even have to be a corporate officer at Ford to get a new , company-leased car every year , with parking provided in the executive garage , where the car is filled with gas daily and washed three times a week . To take_care of their families , executives at this level could lease two more cars at &quot; favorable &quot; rates and obtain low-cost insurance for those cars , a big saving if there ' s a teen-age driver . Corporate generosity extends past the executive ' s working life : In retirement he ( it ' s almost always a he ) continues to get a leased car . Speaking of retirement , it is instructive to learn that one departing GM chairman managed to sneak a $ 600 # 000 increase in his pension past his board of directors , who remained unaware that they had approved doubling his package until a reporter later deciphered a proxy statement . By then the damage was done , and the board was too embarrassed to admit openly that they had been snookered . In the insular world of Detroit auto execs , the early 1980s were so profitable that anything seemed possible . General Motors bought Hughes Aircraft for $ 5 billion , beating Ford ' s $ 4-billion offer . GM spent billions and billions on automated factories , while at_the_same_time signing labor_contracts that kept the work_force in place . The bloated number of workers couldn ' t make the new machines operate properly . A production expert from Toyota , invited to visit GM ' s most high-tech plant , was asked what he thought after he walked through . &quot; They have many problems , &quot; the Toyota man replied , &quot; that they have not thought of yet. &quot; Ford used its vast amount of cash to buy a savings and loan and two consumer lending companies , then spent $ 2.5 billion to outbid GM for Britain ' s prestigious but financially ailing Jaguar . ( The then-head of Jaguar preferred a partnership with GM , rather than outright ownership by Ford , saying , &quot; When an elephant gets_in bed with a mouse , two things happen -- the elephant doesn ' t have much fun , and the mouse gets killed. &quot; ) Chrysler , the smallest of the Big Three , paid $ 636 million for Gulfstream , $ 400 million for FinanceAmerica and $ 200 million for American Motors ( but had to assume $ 700 million of its debt and $ 300 million in unfunded pensions ) . Then it started a joint_venture with the Italian manufacturer Maserati to produce luxury two-seat coupes , which wound_up costing $ 400 million for 7 # 300 cars . With another bad joint_venture -- to produce and sell a Renault model under the Eagle name -- and some plant shifts and closings , Chrysler went_through $ 4.85 billion , money the company didn ' t use to develop new cars or engines . When sales dropped_off after the 1987 stock_market crash and ensuing ( in California and other places , continuing ) recession , Detroit ' s manufacturers were drowning in red ink . Their recovery seems to be_due to new leadership at all three companies , as well as a willingness to listen to and put into practice the ideas of mid-level executives who learned how the Japanese manufacture cars . Of course , it helps mightily that the dollar has tumbled so far against the yen that even compact American cars now enjoy a $ 2 # 000 price advantage against their direct Japanese competitors . One factual quibble : The authors repeat a_couple_of times that Ford ' s introduction of the Taurus in late 1985 &quot; revolutionized automobile styling around the world , &quot; ignoring the fact that the Taurus was a softer version of British Ford ' s Sierra , which had hit U.K. showrooms in fall of 1982 ; it hadn ' t sold well , the_British car magazines declared , because its aerodynamic shape was too advanced for the public . Moreover , the book is filled with phrases that are the literary equivalent of the 1980s boxy Chrysler K-Cars or the Pontiac Fiero ( which had the annoying habit of bursting into flames ) : A GM exec &quot; came_through in the clutch &quot; ; &quot; It quickly became apparent that this coupe was no coup. &quot; Executives are &quot; top guns , &quot; &quot; marketing mavens &quot; and &quot; heavy hitters. &quot; These caveats notwithstanding , &quot; Comeback &quot; is an absorbing , cautionary tale about corporate behavior in an industry that creates the one product necessary both for basic transportation and to define our individual personality .</TEXT>
