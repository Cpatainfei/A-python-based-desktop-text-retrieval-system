   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : HORACE GREELEY HAD IT ALL WRONG : GO EAST , YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR !</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Japanese don ' t know it yet but they ' re about to experience an unprecedented explosion of entrepreneurship . They can thank their economy . The nation ' s Economic Planning Agency reports that the index of consumer confidence is the lowest it ' s been in 19 years . U.S. trade envoy Mickey Kantor is in town to pressure the Hosokawa government to broaden market access . Practically every week , Japanese companies with proud traditions of lifetime employment humbly announce major restructurings and layoffs . The same University of Tokyo-trained civil_servants who had zealously supervised one of the world ' s most regulated economies are now grasping the nettle of deregulation as essential to economic_growth . This bleak litany of Japan ' s corpocratic woes is excellent news for entrepreneurs . All the elements are clicking into place for the sort of &quot; creative destruction &quot; -- the expression articulated by Joseph Schumpeter , the patron economist of entrepreneurship -- that can rejuvenate a stagnant economy . that ' s not to say that a new generation of entrepreneurs is poised to topple today ' s Sonys , Matsushitas , Toyotas or Mitsubishis . But it ' s become clear that a rising level of economic dissatisfaction is causing people to look beyond traditional efforts to simply try to improve existing business institutions . &quot; We have a sense of crisis in Japan ' s current economy , &quot; acknowledges a senior official at Japan ' s influential Ministry of International Trade and Industry . &quot; And we recognize that there are certain structural problems . ( This lack of ) entrepreneurship is a big problem . . . . Intel and Microsoft took_over for IBM when it stumbled . But who in Japan takes_over for Fujitsu or NEC ? &quot; Ironically , MITI has spent more_than a decade trying -- and failing -- to promote new business formation . Apparently , bureaucrats who regulate global enterprises have trouble giving_birth to entrepreneurs . What ' s more , why rock the boat during a rising tide ? In the 1980s , it was easier to make money playing the stock_market and real_estate game than actually launching a new company . But in terms of sheer entrepreneurial resources , Japan is superbly positioned in high_technology , venture_capital and business expertise . As for entrepreneurial successes , there ' s a reason why Matsushita , Toyota and Honda have the names they do . In fact , Sony ' s Akio Morita and Kyocera ' s Kazuo Inamori are probably more global , more innovative and more entrepreneurial than most of their Silicon_Valley counterparts . But it ' s also no secret that Japan ' s business culture and administrative infrastructures have long been biased against start-ups , spin-offs and new entrants to a marketplace . If top graduates of leading universities don ' t go_into government , they ' re expected to join top-tier companies such_as Sumitomo and Mitsui . To this very day , most university graduates hired by leading companies fully expect to be employed for life . Until very recently , job hopping between corporations was regarded_as a psychological aberration . Getting a keiretsu -- a business group -- to buy an innovative new product from a start-up or the spin-off of a traditional company is still extraordinarily difficult . Indeed , Kyocera ' s Inamori likes to point_out that he had to first sell his semiconductor packages to Texas Instruments before any Japanese companies would pay_attention to him . Increasingly , however , words such_as kigyo -- for entrepreneurship -- rather than keiretsu are slipping into business conversations . The stresses and strains of an economy in recession -- along with a population that seems increasingly frustrated by the political chicanery and regulatory corruption that appear to have slowed a general rise in their standard_of_living -- are changing Japan ' s conversations about the future . &quot; More and more , Japan ' s businessmen say they are now going_to make business by themselves , &quot; observes the MITI official . &quot; They recognize the problems of the Japanese economy and they want to become more entrepreneurial . They ' re looking_for some dreams . . . . When I talk with young business people , they say they are now looking_to leave large companies they work for. &quot; To be sure , most of that is just talk . But the burst &quot; bubble economy &quot; and the declining rates of return on traditional investments inevitably mean that a growing number of bright , energetic and ambitious Japanese now have more incentive than ever before to launch new ventures . Deregulation reduces market barriers . Companies desperate to reduce costs are more willing to test a new supplier . Retrenchment makes_it harder for companies to promote the young managers it wants to keep . Older managers are being cherry-picked to join the Japanese affiliates of what were once American , Korean and Taiwanese start-ups . More and more Japanese seem prepared to explore their options if the price is right . Indeed , both MITI and the Ministry of Finance are discussing how to create new stock_exchanges to build a better venture_capital infrastructure for new enterprise . Needless to say , these exchanges could bring_about more foreign investment in Japanese innovation . To be sure , there is no certainty that a rising population of entrepreneurs will effectively transform Japan : There are always more failures than successes . What ' s more , Japanese entrepreneurship -- just like Japanese capitalism -- is likely to have its own unique features . For example , it ' s quite possible that spin-offs from large companies striving to manage costs while pursuing new market opportunities might be a more likely scenario for the future of Japanese venture_capital than slavish imitation of the Silicon_Valley start-up . Small companies have always played an important role in Japan ' s economy , but there has never been a more propitious time for new enterprises to proliferate . Japan ' s ability to grow vibrant new businesses -- not merely its ability to more cleverly restructure its older , larger ones -- may be the true measure of how well the country ' s economy can navigate the decade .</TEXT>
