   <TEXT> * In response to &quot; River Rescue &quot; ( April 20 ) , and the letter ( May 11 ) from Friends of the L.A. River ( FoLAR ) on May 11 : I believe the 11 flood-impacted cities of Southeast Los Angeles County are being unfairly treated for supporting the proposed Los Angeles County Drainage_Area ( LACDA ) project . The cities are certainly not opposed to enhancing water_conservation or recreational opportunities for our 675 # 000 residents living_in the 82-square-mile flood plain area , but we are opposed to risking residents ' lives and the region ' s economic future on FoLAR ' s dream to &quot; restore &quot; the Los Angeles River . What FoLAR refuses to recognize are the economic realities , which were demonstrated in a $ 50 # 000 USC study commissioned by the Southeast Los Angeles County cities . That study estimated our region will lose $ 32 billion in economic activity and 177 # 000 jobs over a 10-year period without the LACDA project relieving the national flood insurance program requirements . Each year the project is delayed , it exposes our residents to loss of life and economic damages totaling $ 2.25 billion from the effects of a 100-year flood . Starting next year , residents will have to pay $ 131 million yearly for mandatory flood insurance_premiums . FoLAR ' s idea of restoring the L.A. River to its &quot; natural &quot; or &quot; restored &quot; state doesn ' t make_sense . The L.A. River , after all , used to empty into Marina del Rey until it changed_course in the mid-1800s . To take_out the concrete retaining walls and widen the river to its &quot; natural &quot; state would mean removing 40 # 000-plus structures just for the distance from South Gate to Long_Beach .
