   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : GOT THE URGE TO CHEAT ? DON ' T WORRY , IT ' S ONLY NATURAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We were a_couple_of married ladies , passing the time with idle conversation about old boyfriends . &quot; Have you ever thought lustfully about other men ? &quot; I asked my friend . &quot; I mean , have you ever thought_about having_sex with other guys ? &quot; &quot; Oh sure , &quot; she said . &quot; Who hasn ' t ? &quot; &quot; But would you ever do_it ? &quot; &quot; No , of course not , &quot; she said . &quot; I love my husband. &quot; &quot; Yeah , &quot; I said , &quot; me too , but that doesn ' t mean you don ' t get the urge. &quot; &quot; that ' s true , &quot; she replied . &quot; I think most people would love to have_sex with someone besides their spouse . As long as there were no repercussions. &quot; Ah , yes , repercussions . Those little details : devastation , disease and divorce . Ah , well . We agreed that repercussionless extramarital_sex was a universal fantasy -- for both sexes -- then segued into our next favorite topic : what our husbands had done lately to make us want to rip_out their nose hairs . But afterward I found myself brooding : Could that really be true ? How can we be programmed for infidelity when society places such a premium on monogamy ? Are our &quot; urges &quot; rooted in biology and therefore impossible to ignore ? Last week , when I saw the cover of Time -- with a golden wedding_band snapped in half and the provocative headline , &quot; Infidelity : It may be in our genes &quot; -- I remembered our chat . Turns_out that with her own simple logic , my friend had demonstrated an unschooled appreciation for the burgeoning field of evolutionary psychology . * The article in Time is a much-condensed version of a book called &quot; The Moral Animal : Evolutionary Psychology and Everyday Life &quot; by New Republic Senior Editor Robert Wright . It is one of a number of recent books that attempt to view human reproductive behavior through the lens of evolution , to explain our messed_up sex lives in the context of Darwinian survival . Wright pulls_together research that ranges over the bumpy terrain of love , looking_for biological cues to our behavior , attempting to answer timeless questions such_as why wealthy_men take trophy wives , why most societies throughout history have been polygamous and why we cheat . The answer to all these questions , evolution-wise , is propagation of the species . &quot; The good news is that human_beings are designed to fall_in_love , &quot; Wright says . &quot; The bad news is they aren ' t designed to stay there . According to evolutionary biology , it is ' natural ' for both men and women . . . to commit adultery or to sour on a mate , to suddenly find a spouse unattractive , irritating , wholly unreasonable . . . . It is similarly natural to find some attractive colleague superior on all counts to the sorry wreck of a spouse you ' re saddled with. &quot; ( Act_on your impulses , though , and that attractive colleague could one day be that sorry wreck of a spouse. ) Conventional wisdom -- as it ' s often expressed on talk_shows and in magazines -- holds that men are programmed to stray while women are programmed to stay . Not so , Wright says . &quot; Women are not by nature paragons of fidelity , &quot; he says . &quot; Wanderlust is an innate part of their nature , ready to surface under propitious circumstances. &quot; But , he adds , &quot; If you think women are bad , you should see men. &quot; ( On behalf of my gender , I thank him for that. ) * So why are we inclined to stray ? Evolutionarily speaking , women ' s innate wanderlust is geared toward confusing the paternity of a child -- on the theory that a man who thinks he may be the father will be disposed to offer care and protection . The more men who think they could be the father , the more protectors a child will have . Men want to jump into bed with everything that moves for an entirely different reason : The more sex they have with young , healthy females , the more likely they are to produce healthy offspring , thus ensuring the bloodline . ( Added evolutionary bonus : each time a male impregnates a female , she is less likely to pass_on the genes of another male. ) Now . The next time you see a luscious prospect and reach instinctively to remove your wedding_band , remember : You are normal and you do not have to act_on your lust . Your positive sexual response to another person does not mean you married the wrong guy or gal , Wright says . It simply means you are human . And so -- don ' t forget -- is the person you married .</TEXT>
