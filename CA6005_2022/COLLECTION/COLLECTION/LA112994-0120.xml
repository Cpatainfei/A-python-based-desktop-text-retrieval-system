   <HEADLINE> AGE OF AQUARIUMS ; CONSCIOUSNESS RAISED , A NEW BREED OF FISH LOVERS GROW THEIR OWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Robert Hildreth has a passion . And a dilemma . He proudly owns a 240-gallon aquarium featuring an array of exotic tropical fish that he bought from stores . He ' s so enthusiastic about his hobby , he keeps another tank as well : a 40-gallon aquarium in which he has bred and raised more_than 100 clown fish , most of which he has given_away to friends . But Hildreth is a prime example of a new kind of aquarist faced with a difficult choice . Prompted by a love of nature to set_up aquariums , they are discovering that keeping fish and enlarging their numbers threatens the natural environment of the very creatures they enjoy . So to solve this problem , many are turning_to breeding their own fish and invertebrates , a worthy cause but one that poses major challenges . &quot; It ' s necessary for the survival of the hobby , &quot; said Hildreth who , like other like-minded practitioners , is a member of the Southern California Marine Aquarium Society , an Orange County organization helping to spearhead the move . &quot; Aquarists are a lot more environmentally oriented than we ' re given credit for . Many of the most serious do this with a conscience. &quot; It wasn ' t always so . Traditionally , enthusiasts say , marine aquarists have obtained virtually all_of the animals and plant_life they keep_from hobby shops that rely_on importers who travel the world ' s oceans collecting the organisms en masse with specially outfitted boats . In recent years , however , there has been growing concern that the oceans are being depleted . Many countries -- in areas ranging from the Caribbean to the South Pacific -- have enacted stringent laws restricting the methods and numbers by which fish and coral can be taken . While most of the concern in the United States has centered_on the Florida coast and Hawaii , Southern Californians got_into the fray recently with their own battle over the Garibaldi , a bright orange fish seen commonly in an area from the rocks of Laguna Beach to the waters off Catalina Island , where professional collectors have for years hunted them for_sale to aquarists in the Orient and , to a lesser extent , locally . Last year , a Huntington Beach environmental organization led a statewide effort to outlaw the practice by attempting to get the Garibaldi designated as the official state marine fish . While not extending the official status to the fish , lawmakers responded by enacting legislation banning the collection of Garibaldis off Catalina Island . They also restricted collection elsewhere along the coast to November , December and January and imposed stiff new permit fees for collectors and wholesalers ranging from $ 330 to $ 1 # 000 a year . Steve Robinson , a collector and wholesaler based in Los Angeles , blames similar restrictions worldwide on the excesses of colleagues who too often , he said , coax fish out of coral habitats by using poisons such_as sodium_cyanide , which &quot; destroy a 70-year-old coral head to get a $ 1 fish. &quot; &quot; Because of the way our trade has behaved , it has attracted the attention of fisheries all_over the world , which are beginning to put limits on collection because of the damage to the ecosystem , &quot; he said . To help solve the problem , Robinson -- who owns a company called Cortez Handcaught Marine -- advocates the use of hand-held nets to catch tropical fish , a method that results in smaller catches but also much less damage to the environment . &quot; It ' s like asking what ' s more important , the apple or the apple_tree ? &quot; he said . &quot; Our industry seems to think that the apple is more important. &quot; * One result of the heavy restrictions imposed on fish and invertebrate collecting worldwide has been a dramatic reduction in the selection of fish and other marine life available locally , and an increase in prices by about 25 % in the last two years . &quot; What it ' s done is made us work a lot harder for what we get , &quot; said Steve Paccione , owner of Strictly Fish , a popular tropical fish store in Garden Grove . &quot; Before you could go_to one or two places to get your fish ; now you have to go_to four or five different wholesalers and spend two or three days a week instead of one. &quot; Some retailers have responded by experimentally offering fish bred in tanks . For the last several weeks , for instance , ' Tis Tropical Fish in Fountain Valley has been selling Percula clowns purchased from a professional breeder in Utah who just set_up shop last year . Smaller , less colorful and more expensive than their ocean-bred counterparts , said owner Kevin Kerns , the fish are not selling well . Mostly , though , it ' s been individual practitioners themselves who have taken the lead in pioneering new ways to breed marine fish and propagate corals and other invertebrates . One of the main difficulties in breeding marine fish , they say , is learning how to produce food capable of sustaining their usually microscopic larvae . And coral or other invertebrates -- which usually reproduce asexually by budding or dividing -- are highly dependent_on such critical environmental factors as timing , lighting , temperature and water quality . &quot; Looking_at some of these organisms is like studying creatures from Mars , &quot; quipped Marc Trimble , president of the Southern California Marine Aquarium Society . Like any hobby club , the 150-member society promotes activities designed simply to enhance its members ' enjoyment of their hobby . But the group also holds monthly meetings featuring expert speakers on breeding and propagation , supports research on those subjects , and organizes educational field trips to area aquariums . Next year it plans to hold a national conference in Costa Mesa -- expected to be attended by more_than 500 aquarists from throughout the United States -- at which breeding and propagation will be major topics of discussion . * &quot; Most of our members are environmentalists , &quot; Trimble said . &quot; We ' re trying real hard to figure_out ways for these animals to reproduce. &quot; That certainly seemed to be the prevailing sentiment during a recent meeting at Costa Mesa ' s Newport Bay Inn , where a guest speaker spent more_than an hour showing slides of the stony_coral he had successfully grown , and in some cases propagated , in his reef tank at_home . Later came the club ' s monthly raffle from which members walked away with a variety of prizes including several bits of coral and other invertebrates ready for home propagation . &quot; The reason I joined is that there ' s so little known and everything is conjecture , &quot; said Gary Bell , a systems engineer from Garden Grove who owns three marine aquariums and has been a club_member for the last three months . &quot; We ' re trying to document what ' s going_on so that we can benefit from each other ' s experiences. &quot; Added Trimble : &quot; We want the hobby to survive . This is the next step ; we have to learn to survive with the ' ark , ' a pair of each species. &quot;</TEXT>
