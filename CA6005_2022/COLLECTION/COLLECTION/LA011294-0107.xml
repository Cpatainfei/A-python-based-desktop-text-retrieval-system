   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL , PALESTINIANS AGREE ON TRANSFER OF CIVILIAN POWER ; MIDEAST : DELEGATES AT EGYPT TALKS REPORT PROGRESS -- BUT NO BREAKTHROUGH -- ON DIFFICULT SECURITY ISSUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel has agreed on the transfer of most civilian government functions to a new Palestinian self-governing authority , and negotiators made progress on some of the most difficult issues blocking an agreement on Palestinian autonomy , delegates said Tuesday . &quot; I hope we ' ll be able to really consider it a milestone that has been accomplished on the way to doing this agreement , &quot; chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said of the agreements now covering almost every aspect of civilian administration in the occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip ; the areas have been in the Israelis ' hands since 1967 . Meeting for the second day in this Egyptian Red_Sea resort , negotiators tried to go beyond the crucial security issues that for months have stymied agreement on Palestinian autonomy . Instead , they sped their way through other nagging issues -- from economics to who controls the telephones -- that have also remained in_dispute . After a long , closed meeting between Shaath and Israeli delegation chief Amnon Shahak , Palestinian negotiators said they expected to reach agreement this week on 37 of 38 areas of civil administration in Jericho and Gaza , which will pass into Palestinian hands for a five-year period of autonomy once an agreement is concluded . Reaching full agreement on electricity , telephones , transportation and population registration , negotiators will have only planning and zoning issues to discuss next week , Shaath said . &quot; We were able today to move very rapidly and I think very positively in most of the departments that used to have difficulty in the transfer of authority to the Palestinian side , &quot; he said . &quot; So I hope we will be able to write the document on the civil issues and the transfer of authority before the end of the week. &quot; Negotiators from both sides denied reports they had reached agreement on the difficult security issues of the size of the Jericho enclave and control of international border crossings ; delegation sources did report progress on both issues . The Palestinian side clearly has dropped its demand for a large enclave around the city of Jericho . But the two sides are still disputing key areas that the Palestinians insist on including outside the city , among them several religious sites and an access to the Dead_Sea . &quot; Have we finally settled_on what we have been offered by the Israeli side ? I say we have not made that agreement , but we have really not gone_back to zero point . On the contrary , I think we have made use of the progress that happened ( in earlier talks ) in Cairo , but we are not yet satisfied , &quot; Shaath said . Likewise , on the issue of international border crossings , Shaath said the two sides &quot; made progress , but we are still short of a sign-able agreement. &quot; The Palestinians appear to have accepted the idea of Israeli-Palestinian monitors of West_Bank residents entering the autonomous areas but are still disputing control of roads from the border crossings to Gaza and Jericho . &quot; Some of the issues we are in full agreement , some in partial agreement , some are totally un-agreed . It ' s going_to take a long_time , &quot; Israeli delegation spokesman Ami Gluska said . He said the issue of what area around Jericho will fall to Palestinian control &quot; is right now at a point where we do not exactly see eye to eye. &quot; The issues of Jericho and border crossings have bedeviled the talks since they opened in mid-October . Shaath said the two sides are moving_on to other issues to keep things going toward an agreement until security issues can be resolved . A subcommittee on security met throughout the past two days on the issues and was scheduled to resume its talks this morning . Meantime , the subcommittee on civil administration is scheduled to take_on the potentially difficult issues of water and archeology later this week ; a third subcommittee today will begin looking_at legal issues , including specific powers of the Palestinian self-governing authority that is to assume power once the Israelis withdraw .</TEXT>
