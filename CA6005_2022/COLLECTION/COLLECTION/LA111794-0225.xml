   <TEXT> Dealing With Minorities : When the National Assn . of Minority Automobile Dealers met recently in Washington , representatives of four Southland auto_companies were there to listen to their concerns . Cypress-based Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America sent two dealer development managers to explain the company ' s 3-month-old Market Investment Program under which Mitsubishi provides up_to 85 % of the money needed to start a new dealership . In Southern California , where land costs are among the highest in the nation , that can easily hit $ 1 million , dealers say . Mitsubishi becomes a partner in the dealership , but provides an opportunity for the dealer to buy_out its share over a five-year period . So far , only one dealer -- not a minority -- has been accepted into the program . A Southern California dealership is next on the list , and Mitsubishi wants a minority dealer for it , said Joseph Zeuli , dealer development manager . Of the company ' s 512 dealers , 18 are minorities . Other companies with representatives at the minority dealer session were Irvine-based Mazda Motor America Inc. , and Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. and Honda North_America Inc. , both based in Torrance . Mazda said 19 of the company ' s 900 dealers are minorities , including five who started this year . The company , which has had a minority recruitment consultant for three years , expects to add three minority-owned dealerships by Jan . 1 , for a total of 22 . Toyota ' s 1 # 191 dealers in the United States include 42 minorities . The company ' s Lexus division has 172 dealers , of whom three are minorities . At Honda , the 1 # 300 Honda and Acura dealers in the United States include 55 minorities .</TEXT>
