   <HEADLINE> COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI ; WHY DID THEY MAKE A FEDERAL CASE OUT OF IT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The world , former Marquette Coach Al McGuire once observed , is run_by C students . Of course , given the continuing fiasco involving the NCAA , the Black Coaches Assn. , the National Assn . of Basketball_Coaches , the university presidents , the Justice_Department and the Congressional Black Caucus , it appears McGuire might have erred on the high side . What a collection of strange bedfellows this is . Forget about these people being_on the same page , most of them aren ' t even in the same book . The thumbnail sketches : --The NCAA : Bureaucrat central . An organization composed partly of well-meaning professionals who care deeply about college athletics and partly of arrogant nimrods who don ' t have a clue . --The NABC : If you own a whistle and can diagram an inbounds play , you can join the NABC . Lots of members , lots of position papers , zero clout . In recent years the NABC has tried to assert itself , but without much success . It has all_the bite of an old_man who forgot his dentures on the bedside table . --The Black Coaches Assn. : Passionate , but clumsy , the BCA has become the new power_broker . Tired of watching the NABC get nowhere with the NCAA and university presidents , the BCA decided to take the initiative , threatened to boycott , and look where it got_it : involved with the Feds , which is never a good thing . --The university presidents : The grand poohbahs of college athletics . Some of them have actually seen a basketball_game , while others think the Atlantic Coast Conference is a four-day seminar on seaweed management . They currently own a stranglehold on the NCAA cost-containment legislation that counts , including the controversial 13-scholarship limit for men ' s basketball . --The Justice_Department : A nice place to visit on a Washington field trip , but you don ' t want any of its officials involved in your business . The department ' s Community Relations Service has been designated as the mediator and arbitrator between the coaches and NCAA . Good_luck . --The Congressional Black Caucus : Politicians . Need we say more ? A FINE MESS--PART II Until the Justice_Department intervened last weekend , the BCA was set to call_for a widespread boycott of games . Rudy Washington , the executive_director of the BCA , described the situation as &quot; nuclear. &quot; USC Coach George Raveling , one of the BCA ' s more prominent members , invoked images of slavery . Temple Coach John Chaney , another BCA spokesman , accused everyone of not caring about the issues . The problem is , no one knew what the issues were . Was it the presidents ' refusal to restore the number of available scholarships from 13 to 14 ? Was it the alleged betrayal of the coaches by the presidents during the recent NCAA convention ? Was it the BCA ' s concerns involving issues related to minorities ? Was it a question of economics ? Was it a question of ethics ? Of being left_out of the decision-making loop ? Was it all_of the above ? Even now , nearly a week removed from the planned boycott , there remains an obvious lack of unity among the coaches and an equally embarrassing lack of understanding and compassion among some NCAA administrators and university presidents . This from Rhode Island Coach Al Skinner , a BCA member : &quot; When the 14th scholarship was not reinstated , you kind of threw your hands up and said , ' What else do we have to do_in order to be listened to , in_order to be taken seriously ? ' &quot; The BCA ' s answer was to essentially ditch the NABC and threaten to boycott games . Thus , began the debate . &quot; I ' m not exactly sure what the ( BCA ' s ) tactics are , &quot; said St . Joseph ' s Coach John Griffin , whose school helped sponsor the legislation that called_for a return to 14 scholarships . &quot; I appreciate the calling of the attention to the issue . ( The threatened boycott ) was courageous and somewhat risky . &quot; I think it may be better if it was a united front with all coaches . Both black_and_white coaches have concerns about minority players. &quot; The bottom_line is this : The talk_of BCA-sponsored boycotts isn ' t the result of failed legislation concerning the 14th scholarship . The coaches are smarter than that--we think . For the BCA to walk_out because of one fewer scholarship would have been a public relations disaster . According to the NCAA , only 122 of 288 Division I teams ( the NCAA doesn ' t include Ivy League members ) had the then-allowable 14 scholarship players on their rosters last season . In fact , the national average was 12.54. The season before , it was 13.0. &quot; Personally , I don ' t think 14 ( scholarship players ) is necessary , &quot; Louisiana State Coach Dale Brown said . Of course , that doesn ' t stop some coaches ( i.e. Louisville ' s Denny Crum ) from complaining about not having enough players to conduct practice or overcome injuries or illness . Our suggestion : Someone needs to explain to Crum the value of walk-ons , America ' s practice fodder . And please , enough with the speeches about how the scholarship reduction lessens the number of opportunities for players , especially minority players . First of all , since when was an athletic scholarship an inalienable right ? Second , the reduction wasn ' t limited to basketball . All Division I men ' s sports underwent a 10 % across-the-board cut . Third , statistics show that teams survive quite nicely with 13 scholarship players . Fourth , it could have been worse . At some schools , scholarships for minor sports were eliminated altogether . Fifth , this idea of precious opportunities loses a little steam when you consider how many scholarships are given to foreign players . For instance , eight of the nine teams in the Atlantic 10 Conference have players from foreign countries . So , if a coach has to choose between a star foreign prospect or an inner-city recruit of lesser talent , whom do you think he ' ll pick ? Exactly . A FINE MESS--PART III St . Joseph ' s Griffin insists that the main issue isn ' t about money . And he ' s right . &quot; In the context of an athletic department budget , one scholarship is a drop_in a bucket , &quot; he said . Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski insists that the main issue isn ' t about race . And he ' s right . &quot; The main ingredient in this whole_thing is the student-athlete , &quot; he said . &quot; We need to take_care of the student-athlete. &quot; And if they don ' t ? LSU ' s Brown made this prediction : &quot; I think someday , and this is looking_into the crystal ball , it would not surprise me . . . that somebody ' s ( going_to be ) getting ready for a Final Four game , the stadium is filled , the television_cameras are_on and the kids say , ' Hey , it ' s time we quit going_under the sham of amateurism . We ' re not going_out until we negotiate. ' &quot; I think then you ' re going to see some quick-moving ( NCAA ) people. &quot; In the meantime , the coaches and the university presidents need to kiss and make_up . The sooner , the better , too . &quot; There ' s an undercurrent here of a bigger issue , &quot; Griffin said . &quot; It ' s unfortunate that it got_to that point of who ' s running college athletics . Let ' s concede that college presidents are running college athletics . Let ' s agree to that . &quot; But the whole point of this was to help the college presidents make informed decisions . And they interpreted this information in such a personal , kind of attacking way , that it degenerated into this Tarzan-like beating of the chest and ' We ' re calling the shots. ' &quot; Added North Carolina Coach Dean Smith , who offered this suggestion to the presidents : &quot; Just talk with the ( coaches ) like they would in the history_department . If they had a problem , they ' d talk to the faculty people in history. &quot; The coaches--both in the BCA and NABC--thought they had a deal with the presidents at the NCAA convention . According to Krzyzewski , the coaches were given &quot; an assurance &quot; that the powerful Presidents Commission , which was headed by Greg O ' Brien , &quot; would look favorably &quot; at reinstating the 14 scholarships . &quot; What happened at the convention , &quot; said Krzyzewski , &quot; was that Greg O ' Brien spoke passionately against the 14 scholarships . So whether a promise was made , I doubt that could happen . But an assurance of support was made. &quot; Or as Kansas Coach Roy Williams said : &quot; They took all_the things they wanted from us and gave us nothing in return . I think we did our normal bloodbath. &quot; A FINE MESS--THE FINAL CHAPTER If nothing else , at least a boycott was averted . A boycott would have made_for great headlines , but like all movements , there would have been a price to pay . In all likelihood , it would n ' t have been a unified effort . Worse yet , there would have been further division between the BCA and the NABC , as well as the coaches and presidents . Oklahoma ' s Billy Tubbs said he would n ' t have joined the boycott . &quot; I ' m not going_to walk_off the court and leave my players on the court all alone , &quot; he said . &quot; I have to fulfill their needs first. &quot; In fact , who knows how many prominent white coaches would have stiffed the BCA ? UCLA ' s Jim Harrick sounded relieved that he didn ' t have to make that decision . The same goes_for Williams and also Krzyzewski , who later instructed his Duke players not to discuss the boycott with reporters . The reason : He didn ' t fully understand the inner workings of the planned action , so how could they ? Then again , that could be posturing . Despite his public proclamations , Tubbs supposedly contacted the BCA about joining the organization . And while they might do so reluctantly , it would n ' t surprise us if Williams , Krzyzewski , Smith and other high-profile white coaches joined a BCA boycott . According to a BCA official , that walkout will take_place within three weeks if Justice_Department intervention doesn ' t produce satisfactory progress with the NCAA and university presidents . There is a danger to all_of this . The boycott repercussions could be swift and painful . &quot; What you have here is the presidents of the universities run the NCAA , &quot; said McGuire , who moonlights as a college basketball analyst for CBS . &quot; The NCAA works--and this is a utopia I ' m talking about--at the convenience of the presidents of the universities . So , it becomes the coaches taking_on their bosses . What are you , crazy ? You don ' t take_on your boss . &quot; You can take_on your boss if you ' re John ( Thompson of Georgetown ) , if you ' re Mike ( Krzyzewski ) , if you ' re Dean ( Smith ) --if you have one word . You know one word ? Like a real pro , an NBA star : Michael , Larry , Shaq . It ' s beautiful if you ' re a one-name person . But if you ' re two names , be careful . Solidarity ' s beautiful at the union hall . It ' s not too nice at_home because you ' ve got_to pay the rent. &quot; USC ' s Raveling would survive the fallout , McGuire said . So would have fellow BCA members Nolan Richardson of Arkansas and Chaney of Temple . But what about less-established black coaches such_as Wyoming ' s Joby Wright or Air_Force ' s Reggie Minton ? &quot; Raveling , Thompson , Richardson , Chaney . . . they ' ve cleared the trees , &quot; McGuire said . &quot; But can you imagine Reggie Minton going_in and telling the general he ' s going_to boycott ? They ' d send him to Wiesbaden , Germany . They ' d just move him out. &quot; Here ' s hoping it never comes_to that . Here ' s hoping for some A students .
