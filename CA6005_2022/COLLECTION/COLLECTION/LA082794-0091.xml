   <TEXT> Regarding &quot; One Studio ' s Trash Is Another ' s Treasure , &quot; Aug . 10 : The real point is that the majority of producers are looking_for a guarantee in a script , and there never is a guarantee . If they turn their attention to finding something of quality , they may find that you can do something worthwhile and get paid_for it . But , as you see in most American films , greed leads the way . And it shows with high-concept , superficial films . Too many people are looking_for a &quot; payday &quot; rather than a film that they can be proud_of . The old saying is still true : &quot; There is not a shortage of Cary Grant / Irene Dunne movies , just a shortage of people who can recognize them. &quot; BEAU DARE Encino</TEXT>
