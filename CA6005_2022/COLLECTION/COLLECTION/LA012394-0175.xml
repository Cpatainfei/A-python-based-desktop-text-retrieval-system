   <HEADLINE> JAPANESE COMPANIES DOMINATE THE MARKET FOR LCD SCREENS . BUT U.S. ELECTRONICS FIRMS BELATEDLY ARE GEARING_UP FOR ; FLAT OUT COMPETITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some call it Flat Panel Flats . This region , carved out of woodlands south of Portland , is the focal_point of an infant electronic display industry whose healthy growth may be critical to the future success of the entire U.S. electronics_industry . The nation ' s largest manufacturer of flat panel displays -- Planar Systems Inc. , which builds displays for medical equipment -- is based here . Not far away , Tektronix is working_on technology that one day may be used to produce large televisions thin enough to hang_on walls . Motif Inc. , a local start-up , is constructing what soon will be the nation ' s largest factory producing screens for laptop_computers . But as significant as these companies are by American standards , they are Lilliputian on a worldwide scale . Planar ' s sales last year came_to just $ 46 million . By contrast , Sharp Corp. , the industry ' s world leader , is a $ 13.6-billion company with more_than $ 1 billion in flat panel display sales alone . And together , Japanese companies hold an iron grip on 95 % of the world market for flat panel displays -- a dominance they are committed to maintaining , no matter what their late-starting American competitors undertake . Still , it is the U.S. display industry ' s strategic importance , far out of proportion to its size , that has turned it into a test_bed for American industrial policy . From computers and telecommunication to autos , broad sectors of U.S. high_technology will depend increasingly on these thin glass screens to give their products portability and pizazz . How well the federal_government promotes panel manufacturing may_not only determine those sectors ' success , but also shape future debates over Washington ' s appropriate role in the development of other emerging industries . &quot; We are competing in a world economy , &quot; says Malcolm Thompson , who heads display efforts at Xerox ' s Palo Alto Research_Center . &quot; This is either going_to be jobs for Americans or jobs for someone else. &quot; During the Reagan and Bush_administrations , the United States_government publicly opposed industrial policy -- the idea of selectively backing important industries as Japan did after World_War_II in its drive to catch_up_with the West . Now , the Clinton_Administration is openly promoting a stronger government role as unavoidable in a competitive global economy in which virtually every advanced power promotes frontier industries at the expense of American industry -- whether Europe ' s support of aircraft manufacturing or Japan ' s promotion of semiconductors . Over the next few weeks , officials at the Department_of_Defense will put the finishing touches_on an inter-agency plan that , drawing a page from the Japan ' s own targeting policies , will determine how best to nurture a competitive American flat panel display industry . Among the proposals under_consideration are innovative financial incentives designed to spur the large corporate investments necessary to make this country an international player . American companies , once wary of government intervention in the market , now are enthusiastically backing a bigger government role . Companies such_as AT &amp; T , IBM and Xerox chose not to invest in liquid_crystal_display ( LCD ) technology a decade ago , concluding it was too expensive and the manufacturing process too complex . Today , they have woken_up to discover that displays are critical to a broad range of the products they plan for the future . Yet , they are completely dependent_on Japanese suppliers -- most of which are also their competitors . Recent shortages of color displays and the high prices that companies have had to pay_for them have underscored American firms ' vulnerability . Companies like Apple and Compaq have found themselves with little alternative but to subcontract key products to Japanese manufacturers to assure supplies of the screens . &quot; There is a feeling that the computer and electronics_industries could go_down in flames if they are vulnerable to ( supply ) delays and ( discriminatory ) pricing , &quot; says Jeffrey Hart , a political_science professor at Indiana University who has studied the industry . Japanese companies ' advanced knowledge of how the latest generation screens will be produced , Hart argues , would give them a competitive advantage in a wide range of new products . Big U.S. companies are taking their first , cautious steps into the white-hot business . Xerox has put_together a consortium , including AT &amp; T , that is asking_for government support to build a commercial-size , color-display production plant . IBM hopes to join the consortium and persuade it to use technology developed by Display Technologies Inc. , an IBM joint_venture with Toshiba . AT &amp; T and Xerox also reportedly are moving ahead with pilot plants of_their_own to build color displays . Efforts to promote a domestic display industry are &quot; good for the country , for the economy and for the job market , &quot; says Jim Dornbusch , manager of business operations at AT &amp; T ' s high resolution technology division . &quot; It ' s an industry that will produce an enormous amount of revenue and jobs. &quot; According to Japanese think_tank Nomura Research , the flat panel display business is expected to be worth about $ 15 billion by the end of the decade -- triple its size today . * The business is worth most to companies that can use the screens to produce high-value electronics products . For example , Sharp Corp. , once a laggard in the camcorder business , became an industry leader overnight when it began selling a camcorder that features a large color LCD as the viewer . &quot; The perception of the quality of a machine is dependent_on what the display looks_like , &quot; says Steven Depp , IBM ' s director of subsystems technology . Demand for IBM ' s new ThinkPad laptop_computer , for example , has been driven by the rich colors of its LCD screen . IBM ' s joint-venture plant in Japan gave IBM an important head_start in designing the product and securing supplies of the screens , Depp says . Playing catch_up actually may put America at an advantage . &quot; For the first time , the Japanese have pioneered first-generation manufacturing , &quot; says Peter Mills , head of the U.S. Display Consortium , an industry group that is trying to develop more advanced display manufacturing equipment with government aid . &quot; And like any first generation , it doesn ' t work very well. &quot; In pursuit of the holy_grail of the display business -- color screens with video capability -- Japanese companies have spent upward of $ 1 billion perfecting a complex technology called active matrix liquid_crystal_display . The technology requires cramming hundreds of thousands of tiny transistors onto a single plate of glass slightly smaller than a sheet_of_paper . Each transistor switches liquid_crystal shutters on and off , allowing light to pass_through color filters and appear as points of colored light . With a_few defective transistors , the entire screen is useless . And the back lots of Japanese color display factories are piled high with the glass of rejected displays . Because of the high reject rates and the high cost of materials -- color filters cost $ 120 per screen -- color screens for laptops sell for as much as $ 1 # 400 . But while high manufacturing costs once appeared as a window of opportunity for American companies , the window is closing fast . In 1991 , a government study by Lawrence E . Tannas , an Orange , Calif.-based consultant , highlighted Japan ' s problems manufacturing color displays . But Tannas has a new study that concludes Japan ' s toughest problems have been overcome . Japanese companies , he says , are about to make a quantum leap in productivity , using a new generation of manufacturing equipment that is three to five times more efficient . &quot; We have lost the chance of becoming an international player in this round , &quot; Tannas says , adding that only a major shift in technology will give America another chance to break_into the market . In recent months , Japanese firms have made a show of renewed confidence in the business by announcing plans to spend $ 2.3 billion to quadruple production of color displays with the new equipment over the next three to four years . Stanford Resources , a San Jose-based consulting firm with wide expertise in displays , predicts that Japan will start making money on color displays this year , a full year ahead of earlier forecasts . &quot; Japan has had such a tremendous head_start , it is going_to be difficult to catch_up , &quot; says Joseph Castellano , president of Stanford Resources . &quot; Any new technology will take_five years to develop. &quot; But nobody is talking_about giving_up . At the first Display Manufacturing Technology Conference held_in San Francisco earlier this month , 400 people showed_up to talk_about technology trends in what participants called an &quot; upbeat &quot; atmosphere . One key source of the optimism : The Pentagon ' s Advanced Research Projects Agency boosted its budget_for display research to $ 125 million this year , up sharply from $ 25 million just two years ago . And many believe more money is_on the way . * Not all_the money will be spent efficiently . Taunton , Mass.-based Kopin Corp . has been working for more_than a decade on technology it promised would cut the cost of making active matrix LCDs . The company ' s founders made small_fortunes last year when they went public , with no product and little more in earnings than the company ' s two-year , $ 9.3-million ARPA contract . But even if the government makes some mistakes in its effort to promote the industry , the amounts_of_money involved pale , in any event , in comparison to past defense spending that failed to pan_out in usable technology . Most industry_analysts say ARPA has done an effective job coordinating the resources of universities , national laboratories , start-ups and large corporations to promote promising technologies . With dozens of new display technologies vying against each other , there are still hopes that one will emerge that will enable America to make an end_run around its Japanese competitors . &quot; This is an industry in its absolute infancy , &quot; says Xerox ' s Thompson . &quot; It ' s a long ways before we will find who are the winners and who are the losers. &quot; On Thursday , ARPA awarded Xerox $ 21.4 million for work_on a technology that produces the world ' s crispest color images -- but involves a costly , expensive manufacturing process . Silicon Video , a small Cupertino firm , is using ARPA money to work_on field_emission displays , which combine thousands of microscopic television_tubes to create bright color images . &quot; With the right processing approaches , it could be very low cost , low power , ( with ) beautiful color and full video , &quot; says Bob Duboc , vice_president of operations . But he acknowledges that the technology is at least two years from market . More promising , near term , is Motif ' s approach , which uses so-called passive matrix screens -- now commonly used for monochrome displays -- and adds sophisticated chips that enable the displays to handle color and video . Henry Lewinsohn , one of two chief_executives at Motif , says his factory will be producing 300 # 000 panels a year within 12 to 18 months . The plant will cost less than $ 70 million -- one-eighth the cost of an active matrix factory . Analysts agree that the technology is promising for certain segments of the market -- including mid-range laptops -- where customers may be willing to sacrifice the bright colors and contrast available on active_matrix_screens in exchange for lower prices . * One problem with the government ' s decision to sponsor numerous alternative technologies is the difficulty the industry will face agreeing on standards that will allow low-cost manufacturing . Japanese industrial policy , by contrast , has encouraged industry to focus early on the technology with the best potential . The result has been a quicker move to mass production . The federal_government ' s biggest help to U.S. industry may be the $ 20 million it is investing to cover two-thirds of the annual budget of the U.S. Display Consortium . The group ' s goal is to create an infrastructure of suppliers of advanced display manufacturing equipment and materials so that the emerging American industry is not dependent_on Japanese suppliers . But an equally important function for the consortium will be pushing for an industry consensus on the key technologies that ought to be pursued . The group was established only last summer . But learning from the experiences of its sister organization in the semiconductor industry , Sematech , it has moved quickly to focus its research efforts on a dozen key manufacturing technologies with the biggest potential for cutting production_costs . With closer coordination , officials hope they can avoid the divisiveness created in 1991 when a group of display makers filed dumping charges that resulted in a 63 % tariff on display imports . That drove production of laptop_computers offshore without doing much to help American producers . But there ' s still a chicken-and-egg dilemma : There is no point in supporting equipment manufacturers if companies aren ' t building factories . Earlier this year , ARPA gave $ 50 million to Optical Imaging Systems Inc. of Troy , Mich. , to help build a small factory that will produce active matrix color displays for jet fighters . The company will work with American equipment makers working under contract to the U.S. Display Consortium . But none of these investments will result in any significant production -- unless major corporations with money to invest get involved . Although AT &amp; T and Xerox insist they are serious about the business , they have yet to offer details of their plans . And while government subsidies may make_it less risky for the companies to build pilot plants , it is far from clear the companies will follow_through with money for additional plants . David Mentley of Stanford Resources estimates that if American companies want a 20 % share of the $ 12-billion-plus market in the year 2000 , they will have to invest nearly $ 2 billion . Companies may be particularly wary of making large investments because huge new Japanese plants are coming_on line over the next two years , Mentley says . The resulting overcapacity could set the stage for the kind of predatory pricing that once devastated U.S semiconductor makers . Important questions remain . Just how much will the Clinton_Administration propose spending on incentives for U.S. production ? How will the incentives be structured to avoid the appearance of pork_barrel ? The rationale that probably will be offered for expanded government investment is that a commercial industry exposed to market forces will be more likely to supply low-cost displays for both military and civilian use . Such an industry , promoters say , would be more efficient than dependence on a small corps of high-cost military contractors . * Scott Holmberg , who helped build one of the first prototypes for a color active matrix LCD way back in 1982 , is skeptical that U.S. companies can be convinced to make the substantial investments necessary . Although he had a pilot production plant for color displays in 1989 , his key backer -- Honeywell -- pulled the plug . &quot; We were ahead of the Japanese but we couldn ' t get the financing to put_up manufacturing facilities in the U.S. , &quot; says Holmberg . Today , Holmberg is chief_executive of Image Quest , a Fremont , Calif. , company that is developing production technology to build color displays for a company with deeper pockets -- Korean conglomerate Hyundai . When the technology is perfected , it will be transferred to Korea , where Hyundai is committed to pouring in the huge investments necessary to produce world-class facilities by the end of 1995 . &quot; You have to be in it for five years just to break_even , &quot; Holmberg says . &quot; U.S. investors aren ' t willing to sit_tight for that long. &quot; Japan Dominates the Flat-Panel Market... With a long head_start on U.S. and Korean competitors , seven Japanese manufacturers-led by Sharp-hold 95 % of the world market for liquid_crystal_displays . Figures are for 1992 . Sharp : 26.8 % Seiko Epson : 12 Optrex : 8.2 Hitachi : 6.4 Toshiba : 6.1 Tottori-Sanyo : 5.8 Casio : 4.4 Other Japanese companies : 25.9 Korean companies : 2.9 U.S. Companies : 1.5 Source : Stanford Resources Inc. ...but Makers Are Only Begining to Show Profits After years of losses on every screen sold , flat-panel display manufacturers are expected to begin making money this year on liquid_crystal_displays , with margins projected to fluctuate but remain positive throughout the decade .
