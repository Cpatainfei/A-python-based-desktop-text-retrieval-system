   <HEADLINE> BORDER_PATROL STOP BASED SOLELY ON ETHNIC APPEARANCE IS ILLEGAL , COURT RULES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal appeals panel has found that the U.S. Border_Patrol committed a &quot; bad-faith , egregious constitutional violation &quot; in stopping a car along a San Diego freeway solely because its occupants looked Latino . The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a longstanding law holding that a car cannot be stopped merely because of its occupants ' ethnic appearance . In a 2-1 ruling , the court Thursday also took the unusual step of barring evidence the officers discovered , which showed that a passenger was an illegal immigrant . &quot; We should not allow our courts to be used to sanction racism in any form , &quot; wrote Judge Thomas Tang . Dissenting Judge Herbert Choy said the officers ' actions , although improper , were not violent or shocking and did not justify excluding the evidence . Illegally seized evidence is generally barred in criminal cases , but deportations are considered civil cases . The U.S. Supreme Court ruled_in a 1984 immigration case that illegally obtained evidence should generally be allowed , but might be excluded in cases of egregious violations . The recent case involved Mario Gonzalez Rivera , then 22 , who was a passenger in a car driven by his father when Border_Patrol officers stopped the vehicle in January , 1988 , on a San Diego freeway . The father was a legal resident , but the son was not . Immigration authorities moved to deport the son , but he has been allowed to stay in the United States while appealing his case . Agent Salvador Wilson testified that agents stopped the car for a number of reasons : The two men appeared Latino ; both looked_away from the officers ; the son ' s mouth appeared to be dry , he was blinking more_than normal , and both men looked nervous . An immigration judge -- noting a 1975 Supreme Court ruling that ethnic appearance alone did not justify a stop -- called the officers ' action unjustified after discounting all_the explanations except the men ' s appearance . But the Board of Immigration Appeals overruled the judge and accepted Wilson ' s explanation . Thursday ' s appeals court decision overrules the Board of Immigration Appeals ruling . Judge Dorothy Nelson , in her lead opinion , questioned whether anyone in a passing car could tell whether a passenger ' s mouth was dry , how often he was blinking or whether those were symptoms of unusual nervousness .</TEXT>
