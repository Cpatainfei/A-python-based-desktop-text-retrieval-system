   <HEADLINE> U.S. DEBATES FIRMER STAND ON JAPAN TRADE ; DIPLOMACY : OFFICIALS DIVIDED ON HOW MUCH PRESSURE TO APPLY OVER GROWING IMBALANCE AS TWO LEADERS PREPARE TO MEET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Several years ago , when Tsutomu Hata was the agriculture minister in the Japanese government run_by the Liberal Democrats , he drew a firm line : Not a grain of foreign rice would be allowed into Japan . Now , he is foreign_minister in the governing coalition that overthrew the Liberal Democrats . And he is asking President Clinton to understand the political pressures his prime_minister , Morihiro Hosokawa , is facing as the new government tries to redesign Japan ' s economic and political_systems . The two leaders will meet today . The arguments made_over the years by Hata , who met Thursday with senior Administration officials as they tried to head_off a collision between their two governments , parallels the debate among the Japan experts in the United States . They are thrashing_out whether now is the time to finally draw a firm line of_their_own by insisting that Japan drop its decades-long defense against foreign access to its lucrative markets . On one side are the &quot; revisionists , &quot; among them U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor , Deputy Treasury_Secretary Roger Altman , and Bowman Cutter , a senior White_House economics adviser . They are adamant : It is time to hold Hosokawa to a pledge made by his predecessor , the last of the Liberal Democrats ' prime_ministers , who promised within six months to establish a framework of &quot; quantitative indicators &quot; for greater foreign access in four key trade groups . On the other side are the &quot; chrysanthemums &quot; -- a term taken from the seat of Japanese royalty , the Chrysanthemum throne . They argue that the United States must recognize the efforts Hosokawa has already undertaken , as well as the difficulties he has encountered trying to stimulate the Japanese economy with tax cuts that are vehemently opposed by the powerful bureaucrats of the Japanese government . &quot; In a nutshell , I have a feeling the Clinton people have become like the proverbial mouse trapped in a corner by a cat , &quot; said Ronald Aqua , vice_president of the U.S.-Japan Foundation . &quot; They don ' t know which way to run. &quot; Within the State_Department , said one Administration official , some are worried that the single-minded focus_on economic issues and the unyielding stance dictated by the White_House will weaken the other pillars of the U.S.-Japanese relationship . Those include a security partnership that has ebbed in importance with the end of the Cold_War but continues to carry weight because of uncertainties over North_Korea and the broader political relationship in which Japan is frequently a partner of the United States in such areas as combatting pollution and global population growth . &quot; There is concern that the other matters might fall by the wayside in the debate over economic issues , &quot; the official said . But with the exception of the few voices at the State_Department , senior Administration officials say they are unanimous in their insistence that there will be no retreat to an agreement that papers over the differences . And , they say , there is little risk to the strength of the overall U.S.-Japanese relationship . &quot; I believe it is still a stable relationship , and I would not say it is permanently damaged in any sense , &quot; Altman said . &quot; But the economic imbalance has to be corrected and the relationship will not be able to remain as solid as it should , absent that. &quot; Throughout Thursday , groups of senior and mid-level U.S. officials met with their Japanese counterparts , probing for a willingness on the part of the visitors to agree to a measurable framework that would increase Japan ' s imports in four economic sectors : autos and auto parts , telecommunications_equipment , medical equipment and insurance . For one reason or another , each sector has erected nearly insurmountable barriers to foreign firms . The four were agreed upon during Clinton ' s Tokyo visit last July as the first targets in the attempt to bring_down Japan ' s trade surplus . That imbalance reached $ 132 billion last year , nearly half of it with the United States . By nightfall Thursday , there was no substantial progress_to report , Altman said . What had given U.S. officials hope was the centerpiece of Hosokawa ' s campaign program : deregulation of the rigid Japanese economy . &quot; One of the arguments you hear is this ( U.S. ) approach is not necessary because they are deregulating and opening_up . Up to this point , it ' s all rhetoric and there is no deregulation , &quot; said a senior Administration official who monitors the U.S.-Japanese relationship . &quot; We do not know any other way of prying ( the Japanese ) market open. &quot; There is little sympathy among senior U.S. officials for the political predicament in which Hosokawa finds himself . &quot; We have tried to give him as much running room as we can , &quot; a senior Clinton aide said . Now , the official said , &quot; we ' ve told them : ' The time is up. ' &quot;</TEXT>
