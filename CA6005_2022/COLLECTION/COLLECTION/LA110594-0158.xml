   <HEADLINE> GROUP URGES DOCTORS TO GIVE SPIRITUAL ADVICE ; HEALTH : THE CHRISTIAN MEDICAL &amp; DENTAL SOCIETY WANTS MEMBERS TO OFFER MORE THAN JUST PHYSICAL HEALING . A BIOETHICIST SAYS SUCH PRACTICES NEED TO BE DISCLOSED TO PATIENTS BEFOREHAND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A doctor ' s group that wants to bring spirituality into the examining room is encouraging physicians to discuss not only prescriptions and surgery with patients , but God , too . The Christian Medical &amp; Dental Society is an interdenominational organization of about 9 # 000 doctors and dentists . &quot; The bottom_line is , we need to change the physicians , the nurses , the people that provide the care , &quot; said Dr. David Stevens , the new general director of the society . &quot; Physicians need to be more_than just people that provide physical healing , but also those who can give spiritual counseling , &quot; he said . The society organizes volunteer medical work around the world , supports missionaries and encourages medical_students and doctors to practice their faith on_the_job and off . The group opposes euthanasia , surrogate motherhood and abortion , except to save a woman ' s life . While it has no official position on birth_control , a doctor writes in the current issue of the society ' s magazine that physicians should not prescribe birth_control_pills for unmarried_women . Each year , the Christian Medical &amp; Dental Society , which raises its $ 3 million annual budget from dues and donations , sends 1 # 500 doctors , dentists , nurses and volunteers on about 50 volunteer medical programs for two weeks or more . The group also is trying to encourage doctors to donate their services more in U.S. inner_cities and impoverished rural_areas . &quot; I think medicine is a natural outreach of the Christian_church , &quot; Stevens says . &quot; When people come_into a physician ' s office , they ' re thinking about serious things and they ' re ready for change in the way they behave , in the lifestyles . Christian physicians are in an ideal place to share more_than just pills , more_than just surgery , but to share something that means more to them than their profession . that ' s their faith in Jesus_Christ , &quot; he said . However , some consumer medical advocates and bioethicists said they believe physicians should let patients know beforehand if they will not carry_out practices that are considered the medical standard , whatever the religious , moral or philosophical reason . &quot; The issue becomes one of disclosure . What I think they have to be sure to do is let their patients know what the value basis is they operate from , &quot; said Dr. Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania .</TEXT>
