   <HEADLINE> LAPD MAY MANUFACTURE COCAINE FOR BAIT IN STINGS ; DRUGS : THE AGENCY IS CONSIDERING PROVIDING CRACK -- MADE IN ITS OWN LABS , IF NEEDED -- TO UNDERCOVER OFFICERS FOR REVERSE STING OPERATIONS . OTHER DEPARTMENTS USE SIMILAR TACTICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taking a cue from Orange County authorities , the officer in_charge of street-level narcotics investigations for the Los Angeles Police_Department is preparing a proposal to establish reverse sting operations to catch illegal drug_users and , if necessary , manufacture rock -- or crack -- cocaine in police labs for use as bait . Until now , the LAPD has never seriously considered such operations . But Capt . Bob Hansohn said the proposal he is preparing_for consideration by Chief Willie L . Williams could put some officers on the street dealing drugs undercover much like police in Santa Ana . There , 350 people have been arrested during the past 18 months by undercover police_officers dealing county-made crack cocaine . If needed , Hansohn said LAPD officers could be supplied with rock cocaine manufactured by the Los Angeles crime lab . Authorities have said most of those arrested in Orange County were first-time buyers and were assigned to drug diversion programs instead of receiving jail or prison_terms . &quot; If the conventional methods aren ' t working , I believe we have the obligation to look_at knocking_out the problem in other ways , &quot; Hansohn said . &quot; This proposal is just in the preliminary stages . ( Chief Williams ) may or may_not agree. &quot; Pasadena police have been selling street_drugs , rather than those cooked by police , during reverse stings for about eight years , Lt . Jerry Schultze said . In the court_order approving Santa Ana ' s program , the Orange County district_attorney ' s office cited two Pasadena cases in which state courts ruled that reverse stings were legal . The Inglewood Police_Department has been selling rock cocaine undercover since 1988 , when it combined its program with a billboard campaign that warned : &quot; Behind That Rock Could Be a Cop , &quot; Capt . Jim Seymour said . In Santa Ana , authorities said their stings are intended to make small-time buyers eligible for harsher punishments . Deputy Dist . Atty . Carl Armbrust said Friday that the reverse stings help officers build felony rap sheets against users who will eventually be eligible for prison sentences if they are arrested a second time . Orange County Public_Defender Ronald Y . Butler questioned whether the police_actions amount to entrapment . &quot; Since most of these people are first-time offenders , you have to wonder if they would be purchasing drugs at all if the police weren ' t out there enticing them , &quot; Butler said . &quot; I would seriously question the efficacy of their efforts . I think the motives are pure , but the means to the end seem to be really stretching it. &quot; Armbrust and Santa Ana police officials defend the operations in which the Orange County Crime Laboratory has been manufacturing $ 10 and $ 20 pieces of rock cocaine for undercover officers to sell on the street . &quot; You can ' t measure the success of this program just by how many people end_up in jail , &quot; said Santa Ana Police Lt . Robert Helton . &quot; We also rely_on people in the neighborhoods to tell us whether things are getting better . I think we are seeing a significant degree of success here. &quot; Butler said his staff will file a legal_brief as early as Monday , contending that the manufacture of the highly addictive crack cocaine amounts to &quot; outrageous government conduct. &quot; The public_defender ' s brief is patterned after a similar legal objection filed_in Broward County , Fla. , where a state appeals court ruled that the county sheriff acted illegally in manufacturing rock cocaine for undercover drug investigations . The Florida ruling resulted in the reversal of hundreds of convictions obtained from reverse sting investigations .</TEXT>
