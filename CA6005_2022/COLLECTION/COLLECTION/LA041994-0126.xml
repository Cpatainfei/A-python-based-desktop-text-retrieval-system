   <HEADLINE> SERBS USING U.N. AS A COVER , SAYS MISSION LEADER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia condemned Serbian nationalists Monday for using his peacekeeping mission as a cover_for waging war and warned that the fall of Gorazde would unleash a humanitarian disaster . British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose said his 15 # 000-strong peacekeeping force is helpless to save the overrun city , and he dismissed the likelihood of further NATO air strikes to halt the slaughter by the Serbs . Rose said that nothing could be gained without ground forces to hold territory that might be recovered if the rebels were driven_back with air_power . He also made clear that he is opposed to having his troops transformed from impartial peacekeepers to combatants in the lopsided war . In a further indication that the international community suffers paralyzing confusion over what to do_in Bosnia , senior U.N. military officials have concluded that Radovan Karadzic , the Bosnian Serb leader negotiating with Western mediators , exercises little if any control over the Serbian gunmen under the command of Gen . Ratko Mladic . The fiery nationalist general ' s rampage against Gorazde is believed to be occurring on orders from Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade , the Yugoslav capital . &quot; Mladic has taken the upper_hand , and Karadzic is extremely shattered . He saw himself as a statesman , and he is now a running dog for a warmonger , &quot; said a senior U.N. source . Russia ' s special envoy for the Balkans , Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S . Churkin , also seemed to have concluded that the Bosnian Serb military machine is out of control . &quot; A group of Bosnian Serb extremists has fallen ill with the madness of war , &quot; Churkin told reporters in Zagreb , Croatia , after more_than a week of shuttling among Serbian leaders . The renegade and seemingly uncontrollable assault on Gorazde , despite promises by Karadzic to call_off the onslaught , prompted Rose to accuse the rebels of manipulation and deceit . &quot; This is a very sad week for the world when United Nations peacekeeping operations have been so blatantly used to cover the prosecution of war aims by the Bosnian Serb authorities , &quot; Rose said . He said Gorazde was at the mercy of the Serbian forces besieging it and conceded that the U.N. Protection Force could do virtually nothing to prevent its fall . He blamed the mission ' s crippling rules of engagement -- which allow peacekeeping troops to use force against combatants only when their own lives are threatened -- for his inability to spare the 65 # 000 residents of the U.N.-protected safe area of Gorazde . Seven U.N. special forces officers who had been deployed to the besieged town escaped back to Sarajevo under cover of night , further handcuffing the mission ' s ability to call_in North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization warplanes to bomb Serbian positions . Five U.N. military observers and eight relief officials are now the only foreigners left in Gorazde . Sources at the Sarajevo command center say Rose is pressing U.N. superiors for a tougher mandate , one that would create weapons exclusion zones around Gorazde and other vulnerable safe areas . As in the demilitarized zone proclaimed around Sarajevo in February , the threat of NATO air strikes would hang over the Serbs if they refused to remove heavy_weapons . Time appeared to be running_out , though , for the anguished people of Gorazde . Relief agency officials described a scene of savagery and panic . &quot; Shells are now dropping at random into the city_center . The hospital has taken direct hits on its roof . The ( International Committee of the Red_Cross ) refugee center is hit , &quot; with many casualties , four stranded workers of the U.N. high_commissioner for refugees reported from the raging battle zone . Agency spokesman Kris Janowski said the Gorazde team counted at least five tank rounds crashing into or near the overcrowded hospital and described the bombardment as fierce , with shells landing every 20 seconds . &quot; It ' s extremely alarming . We are very concerned about the fate of all_the people in Gorazde . There are tens of thousands of people massed in the city , &quot; Janowski said , estimating the displaced at 30 # 000 . But evacuations to ease the overcrowding -- caused by those who have fled overrun villages and suburbs during the 20-day assault -- are out_of_the_question until the besieging forces agree to halt fire long enough to allow the organization of a rescue operation , Janowski said . Relief workers in this battered capital , already exhausted by two years of trying to aid innocent victims in the midst of ongoing war , are in a quandary over how to help the displaced of Gorazde when , or if , the attacks die_down . A year ago , Serbian gunmen rolling_up territory for a Greater Serbia waged a similar assault on the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica , forcing humanitarian aid agencies to evacuate thousands of civilians to government-held territory . Chaotic stampedes resulted when open trucks arrived to haul out terrified civilians , with at least six women and children crushed to death before the evacuations were called_off after the United Nations designated Srebrenica a safe area . The U.N. mission ' s civilian chief , Yasushi Akashi of Japan , returned to his headquarters in Zagreb on Monday after repeated failures to secure genuine commitment by the rebel leaders to a proposed cease-fire . Viktor Andreyev , the Russian civilian affairs chief , visited rebel headquarters in nearby Pale to discuss another truce proposal and claimed to have won Karadzic ' s support for deploying a company of U.N. troops to Gorazde as well as allowing unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid . Serbian commitments to cease-fires have proven unreliable , however , as Mladic presses_on with the land-grab while Karadzic strikes an agreeable pose . As the world watched the relentless Serbian offensive , few outsiders were as dismayed as the Russians , whose claim of influence over their Slavic brothers was shattered by the guns they could not silence . Moscow appeared to be re-examining its opposition to punishing the Serbs . Churkin , the Russian envoy , returned abruptly to Moscow on Monday , saying Russia had been manipulated and should break_off talks with Serbian leaders . &quot; The time for talks is over now , &quot; he declared . &quot; The Bosnian Serbs must understand that when they deal with Russia , they are dealing with a great world_power and not a banana republic. &quot; His remarks appeared to signal at least a change of attitude , if not of policy , in Moscow . Russia had opposed NATO bombing attacks on Serbian forces and was incensed at not being consulted in_advance about the raids last week . And Russia had repeatedly called_for a gradual lifting of U.N.-backed economic and military sanctions against Serbia in exchange for steps toward a cease-fire . Churkin , a special envoy of President Boris N . Yeltsin who had spent the last nine days in Belgrade , said Monday that the Bosnian situation &quot; can hardly be controlled &quot; or &quot; explained in any reasonable or logical terms. &quot; He said the place was &quot; on the brink of catastrophe. &quot; Arriving in Moscow , he gave this analysis : &quot; Russia ' s policy used to come_down to a simple formula -- when the Serbs would say that the entire world was up in arms against them and they were to be helped , we agreed on the condition that they would follow our instructions . Instead , the Serbs are using Russia ' s policy as a screen. &quot; The Russian envoy indicated he was ready to recommend that Yeltsin support new NATO air strikes on Serbian positions . That would be a risky position for the Russian president , who could face an outcry of ultranationalist and centrist opposition at_home in the event of new bombings . Also , the Russians are as reluctant as the West to engage their peacekeeping troops in a ground war in the former Yugoslav federation . Meantime , in Sarajevo , almost 2 # 000 people demonstrated against U.N. capitulation to Serbian aggression , accusing Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of abandoning them to a brutal fate . &quot; We have learned our lesson , &quot; Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told the aggrieved , angry crowd . &quot; The lesson is we have to be strong , because in this world only force is respected. &quot; More_than 200 # 000 people are dead or missing since Serbian nationalists rebelled against Bosnian independence in March , 1992 . They have since conquered 70 % of the country . Times staff writer Richard Boudreaux in Moscow contributed to this report .</TEXT>
