   <HEADLINE> 138 COUNTRIES SEEK TO COMBAT GLOBAL CRIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Top government officials from 138 countries launched a drive Wednesday against cross-border crime with a two-part program to combat the world ' s organized criminals . Alarmed at the rising power of international gangs , a U.N.-convened conference approved the &quot; Naples declaration &quot; in which delegates pledged themselves to crack_down harder on crime on_their_own turf and cooperate closely with other countries . &quot; We proclaim our political will and strong determination , as well as our unequivocal commitment to ensure full . . . implementation of the present declaration and the global action plan against organized transnational crime , &quot; the declaration said . The world ' s criminal gangs are estimated to turn_over $ 750 billion a year from drug smuggling , arms trafficking and prostitution rackets . Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who hosted the conference , said the fight against crime is a global war that can be won only if countries unite . There are worrying signs that the mobs are overcoming their traditional clannishness and joining forces to boost business . The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe has brought a new threat from Mafia-style groups there . The World Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational Crime , the highest-level gathering convened by the United Nations on crime , urged countries to tighten their own laws to prevent criminal organizations from benefiting from international loopholes . But the countries stopped short of calling_for the immediate introduction of an international convention on organized_crime , advocated by some Third_World members . The conference was held_in Naples , infamous for its Camorra criminal gangs , to underline Italy ' s and the international community ' s determination to battle the mobs . Berlusconi attended a ceremony here Wednesday at a special U.N. monument honoring all victims of organized_crime . But Berlusconi ' s own legal problems , with Milan magistrates serving him with an official warning that he is under investigation for alleged corruption , have to some extent overshadowed the conference . Magistrates suspect him of involvement in bribes paid by his Fininvest media company to finance police before he took power in March elections . Berlusconi denies the allegations . Seeking to save his political skin , Berlusconi threatened Wednesday to resign and seek new elections if his coalition allies fail to back him . Berlusconi said he has a &quot; contract with voters &quot; to pursue the program he put_forward for general_elections last March . Speaking at a news_conference , the billionaire businessman also said he is willing to sell his three national television_stations , which he has previously refused to do .</TEXT>
