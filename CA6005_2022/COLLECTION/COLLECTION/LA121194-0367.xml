   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES : WILL 1995 BE THE YEAR GROWTH_STOCKS TAKE OFF ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Against a generally favorable economic and political backdrop , growth_stocks might actually start to grow again . That would be a welcome change for several hundred mutual_funds that seek_out companies with promising sales and earnings potential . Most of these funds are showing modest losses so far in 1994 . Worse yet , they have been outperformed since 1991 by their archrivals -- funds that invest in bargain or &quot; value &quot; stocks . These are companies characterized as cheap in terms of having a low price-earnings multiple , a low price-book value ratio , a hefty dividend yield or the_like . The two categories of stocks tend to alternate in and out of favor for years at a stretch , and many growth-fund managers are becoming hopeful that 1995 will be their year . This optimism can be boiled_down to several key reasons : * In a slowing economy , which many people are forecasting for 1995 , growth companies are_better able to maintain impressive financial results , at least compared to value stocks . &quot; The U.S. economy is in the mature stages of its current expansion , &quot; says Michael Gerding , manager of the Founders Worldwide Growth Fund in Denver . &quot; Such an environment favors growth_stocks , and small growth_stocks in particular , &quot; he says . * Higher interest_rates , while bad for stocks generally , will put added pressure on firms in debt-laden industries such_as the electric-utility business and energy production . Big borrowers , including many cyclical companies , often fall_into the value camp . * A lower capital-gains tax_rate , if the new Republican Congress can push one through , would tend to favor investments that deliver appreciation rather than dividends . True growth companies pay little if anything in the way of dividends . A cut_in the capital-gains rate would also tend to shift investor enthusiasm toward stocks generally , notes Hans Ziegler , chief_executive_officer of Stein Roe &amp; Farnham in Chicago . * It ' s about time for growth_stocks to rotate into favor . Value companies have been winners most of the time from 1981 on , having logged much better performance in 1992 and 1993 . &quot; Growth shares currently are undervalued relative to the market on a historical basis , &quot; says Ziegler . This year , the growth is doing better , raising hopes in the growth camp that the momentum is shifting . Mike Flynn , a manager at Stratford Advisory Group in Chicago , says his firm in recent months has been recommending that clients shift their holdings of domestic stock funds to 75 % growth , 25 % value from a 50-50 split this summer . Margie Mullen of Mullen Advisory in Los Angeles recommends a 50-50 split between the two , but that represents her heftiest growth weighting in three years . &quot; After three years of under-performance , I think growth will do_well , &quot; she says . As a caveat , it ' s not always easy to identify one type of stock from the other -- investment beauty often is in the eye of the portfolio manager . Besides , classifications change . A few years ago , pharmaceutical companies were viewed_as classic growth_stocks because of their superb record of profit increases . But these issues got clobbered when the Clinton_Administration raised the specter of health-care reform , and now many drug manufacturers have become value plays . Perhaps more troubling for mutual_fund shareholders , you can ' t assume that a particular growth fund will be holding growth_stocks . The growth nomenclature is used to describe funds oriented toward capital-gain returns rather than dividends . Many fine growth funds actually follow a value investing approach . Some even have &quot; value &quot; in their names . But you are more likely to find value portfolios in the growth and income and equity-income fund categories . It ' s worth noting that not everybody thinks growth_stocks will necessarily outperform in 1995 . In a soft market , especially one marked by rising interest_rates , stocks with high price-earnings ratios often get banged_up the most , says Judy Vale , manager of the value-oriented Neuberger &amp; Berman Genesis Fund in New York . Growth_stocks trade at higher P-E ratios than value shares . Considering that interest_rates still appear to be rising , that could be an important negative . Vale combines the two approaches in that she looks_for growing companies whose share prices have stumbled . There ' s a perception that value firms often are &quot; static , &quot; she says , but in many cases the shares of quality companies have been beaten_down simply because management reported a flat quarter . &quot; A number of companies continue to have strong fundamentals , but their stock prices are off , &quot; she says . Given the blurry lines between many growth and value stocks , not to mention the difficulty of predicting which category will fare better , it ' s often wise_to cover your bases . The easy solution is to buy_at least two stock funds -- one with a growth orientation and the other with a value slant . * John Neff , one of the most successful fund managers ever , will step_down from the helm of Vanguard Windsor at the end of 1995 . Neff became manager in 1964 , when the fund had $ 75 million in assets . Today , it counts $ 10.7 billion . Under his direction , Windsor beat the market through most of the 1980s , stumbled badly in 1989 and 1990 , and has since resumed its relatively good performance . The fund is currently closed to new investors . Neff will stay_on in an advisory role . Charles Freeman will take_over as lead manager of Windsor . He has worked for the fund since 1969 .</TEXT>
