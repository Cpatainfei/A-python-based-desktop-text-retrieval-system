   <HEADLINE> MOTORCYCLE PRODUCTION REVVING_UP IN CHINA ; MANUFACTURING : THE NATION PASSED JAPAN AS THE WORLD ' S BIGGEST MAKER . GREATER DEMAND IS SEEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China has overtaken Japan as the world ' s biggest maker of motorcycles -- but the market is dominated by models developed by three Japanese manufacturers . Chinese production_lines turned_out a record 3.37 million cycles in 1993 , while Japanese factories built 3.197 million . The gap is expected to widen this year with demand strong in China but weak in Japan . &quot; We expect sales here to grow 15 % a year until the end of the century , &quot; said Kazukimi Kojima , representative of Honda Motor Co . in Beijing . &quot; There is no market like this in the world. &quot; Kojima said Honda has first place in China , with a 37 % share of the market held by firms with which it has technical cooperation agreements or joint_venture agreements , followed by Yamaha at 26 % and Suzuki with 24 % . Chinese output has soared from fewer than 50 # 000 machines in 1980 to 1.34 million in 1991 and 2.05 million in 1992 , according to official figures . Honda was the first Japanese maker to arrive when it signed a technical cooperation agreement in January , 1982 . Its rivals followed and now Honda , Yamaha and Suzuki have a total of 18 plants here using their capital or technology . Kawasaki has no plants in China . The top two factories are appropriately in Chongqing in southwest China , a city so hilly that it is not suitable for the hardy bicycle , of which China has 400 million . One is a joint_venture with Honda and the other with Yamaha , reminiscent_of the five-year Honda-Yamaha war in Japan , where motorcycle output peaked at 7.41 million in 1981 . The main markets in China are in cities in the south and on the coast , where residents use motorcycles to go_to work , and in villages where the cycles are used to carry goods as well as people . Guangdong has 860 # 000 privately owned motorcycles , the most of any province . But nationwide , fewer than eight people per 1 # 000 own motorcycles , compared to a world average of 30 . &quot; We have entered the golden_age of China ' s motorcycles , in the footsteps of Japan , Taiwan and elsewhere in their period of economic takeoff , &quot; the Economic Daily wrote . &quot; There is no market in the world that can compare with China . If we do not develop production rapidly , large-scale imports and smuggling are inevitable. &quot; Experience shows that sales of motorcycles begin when per-capita income reaches $ 300 a year and soar when it reaches $ 1 # 000 . That is the income level in Guangzhou , where most households have bought most of the appliances they want . Rich Chinese still prefer imported models . With an import_duty of 150 % , they cost more_than $ 1 # 150 , against $ 805 to $ 1 # 030 for the popular 70cc model produced by Jialing , Honda ' s partner in Chongqing . In 1993 , Japan legally exported 460 # 633 motorcycles to China , up from 297 # 260 in 1992 . Many are also smuggled in to escape the duty . Demand is limited by government directive . Concerned about worsening traffic chaos , many cities_limit the use of motorcycles , with Beijing among the most strict . Other cities issue only a certain number of licenses per month . Another limiting factor is the price of fuel , likely to rise sharply as China moves to discourage consumption because domestic output cannot keep pace with demand . For Japanese such_as Honda ' s Kojima , this explosive growth in output carries a somber message . &quot; In the 1950s , we Japanese were the students and the U.S. the teacher , &quot; he said . &quot; Now we are the teacher and the Chinese the students . How are we to avoid the decline of the U.S. and Europe ? We must work even harder to develop new technology and new products . &quot; If China reaches the standard of Japan , we have no future. &quot;</TEXT>
