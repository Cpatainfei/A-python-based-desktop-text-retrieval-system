   <HEADLINE> IRVINE WOMAN VOWS TO FIGHT EXTRADITION IN MURDER CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An Irvine woman who has been charged with murder in the death of her adopted baby daughter in Illinois 18 years ago will fight extradition from California , her lawyer said Monday . In a brief court hearing , lawyer Keith Ross of Santa Ana said Victoria Neal does not want to give_up her right to an extradition hearing . Neal , described by police as a 44-year-old interior_designer , was arrested at her Irvine home on Thursday on the strength of Illinois indictments charging her with murder in the death of 1-year-old Danielle Christine Neal , who died in a hospital in Peoria , Ill . Prosecutors in Tazewell County , Ill. , said Neal told an Orange County social_worker last year that she was responsible_for the baby ' s death on Sept 2 , 1976 . But on Monday , Ross denied the allegations , saying Neal was &quot; going_through a very difficult time. &quot; Outside the courtroom , Ross said : &quot; Eighteen years ago , a child died in a tragic accident . There was a full investigation and death was found to be accidental . It is an election year in Illinois and one has to wonder why this has been brought_up &quot; again . Ross declined to elaborate . Neal was being held_in County Jail . Bail was set at $ 100 # 000 . Ross asked Superior_Court Judge Michael Brenner to permit Neal ' s 14-year-old daughter , Tressa , to visit her mother in jail . The judge said he would consider the request and rule later . Brenner also transferred the_matter to Municipal Court for a hearing related to her extradition today .</TEXT>
