   <TEXT> * Before we start building prisons ( at a cost of some $ 100 # 000 per cell ) to launch a new offensive in the &quot; war on crime , &quot; let ' s consider the effectiveness of prisons . In fact , let ' s examine the whole concept of &quot; crime and punishment. &quot; Why do we put people in prison when they violate the law ? It seems to me that there are four main reasons : 1 ) &quot; That ' ll teach ' em a lesson. &quot; The presumption here is that by putting a criminal in prison for a portion of his life , large or small , we give him an opportunity to reflect upon his behavior so that when he comes_out , he ' ll be a decent , law-abiding citizen . Result : At any given time , about two-thirds of those in prison have been there before . This doesn ' t work ! 2 ) &quot; We ' ve got_to protect the public ! &quot; This works , but only for the time the criminal is in prison . To really accomplish this goal , we need to give every felon a life sentence . 3 ) &quot; The mental well-being of the victims. &quot; To put it another way , it ' s vengeance , revenge . 4 ) &quot; Prisons send a message. &quot; Nearly every society in human history has relied_upon prisons to serve as a deterrent to crime . But the crime_rate still keeps rising now . So either not enough people are getting the message , or the message has no meaning . It ' s true that we cannot count the crimes that were not committed because the criminal was deterred by the thought of prison . But plenty are being committed despite the &quot; message. &quot; Prisons are very expensive , and so are prisoners . Maybe it ' s time we tried something different , whether it is compulsory &quot; boot camp , &quot; psychological counseling , whatever . What we really want to do is to change the behavior of those who commit crimes . And prisons are failing to do this . DEANE BOTTORF Corona del Mar</TEXT>
