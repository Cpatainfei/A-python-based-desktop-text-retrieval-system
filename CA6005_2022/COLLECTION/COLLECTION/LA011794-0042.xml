   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : TESTIMONY / ONE PERSON ' S VIEW OF LOCAL TV NEWS ; ' THE BOTTOM_LINE IS ALSO TIED TO CREDIBILITY '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sherrie Mazingo worked for nine years as a producer , news writer and deputy bureau chief for NBC in New York and Atlanta . She is chair of the Broadcast Journalism Sequence , School of Journalism , USC . I paid particular attention to a leading local news channel on a recent Monday night . I wrote_down every story they did . And I was appalled that the first 11 stories before the commercial break were all dealing with crime and violence . This is not balanced news presentation . If I was a visitor here and I turned_on that newscast , I would get the distinct impression that what goes_on in the Los Angeles metro area is all crime and violence-related and that would certainly be a distorted perception . Within this range of stories , ( the newscast ) even reached outside of the L.A. area to tell me about some inmate in Florida . One had to wonder what the heck does that have to do with me and why is that news and why is it the third story in their lineup ? Yes , there ' s something to be said for presenting related stories , but to do_it with this many stories and to make_it the whole top of the newscast before the break is outrageous , unbalanced and unfair . Something terrible has happened to this industry . In the L.A. television market in particular , we are seeing more and more stories on local television_news that have an emphasis on crime and violence . And such presentations must be instilling unnecessary fears in the minds of some , if not many , residents . It has been demonstrated over and over through research that if you have a cumulative presentation on any given topic to which viewers are consistently exposed , it leads people to believe that this must be the way things really are . Is it the case that if you lead an ordinary life and go_about your business on a daily basis , within a given period_of_time you will witness a crime , a violent incident , or you will be a victim of one ? Is this is the only kind of activity that goes_on here that is newsworthy ? I don ' t think it means either of those , and yet by continuing to focus_on and emphasize crime and violence as it occurs in Los Angeles , by devoting an excessive amount of attention to this , it is exactly the impression given to viewers . I work_at USC in South-Central L.A. and I live at the other end of South-Central and I drive through South-Central six to seven days a week . I was at USC when the civil disturbance broke_out . And even driving_home that day I was not as afraid as I am today when there is no immediate threat . What is operative here is my perception that there is a threat -- not from my experience , but from what television is telling me about the environment out there . I think this also feeds into racial and ethnic and cultural stereotypes and misconceptions . It ' s not just black males . It ' s Hispanic individuals , it ' s people coming from different cultures . There are other news_stories about these same classes of individuals that are not being presented on our local television_news . To think that the only thing that makes these people interesting and informative is if they are engaged in some kind of criminal activity or if they ' re victims is terribly erroneous thinking . The broadcast majors here at the School of Journalism produce a half-hour weekly television_news magazine program that airs over 19 cable outlets throughout Southern California . In our programs we do stories on people of varying racial , ethnic and cultural backgrounds within the Los Angeles area . For example , in connection with the City_Council ' s consideration of whether street vendors should be licensed , we told a lot about the background of these people -- where they ' re from , why they ' re street vendors , why the street vendor culture seems to be limited to only a_few particular groups of people . It ' s informative ; it ' s telling another story . Another example : When I came_to L.A. 10 years ago , Watts was predominantly black and had been for a long_time . Watts today is predominantly Hispanic . I bet nine out of 10 people don ' t know that . I have not seen that story . It has nothing to do with some gang running_around Watts , it has nothing to do with some drive-by_shooting in Watts . But local TV news will go_out and do hit-and-miss reporting on drive-by_shootings , on gang incidents , murders and this-and-that and the other . But they won ' t give me a background story that has meaning and interest to me as a resident of Los Angeles . What this industry needs to do is to turn this around . If they want to focus and emphasize the bottom_line , there has got_to be some rapid realization that the bottom_line is also tied to credibility , to viewers ' perceptions of the integrity of a news organization and the responsible presentation of news and information . If the industry keeps going_in this direction , we will increasingly see viewers turning_off those presentations . TV news seems to have strayed greatly from a focus of responsible news presentation . There are many reasons for that . First , we ' re seeing more of the money guys coming_into editorial positions , as opposed to people who previously came from news backgrounds exclusively . And we are seeing an explosion in the technology affecting presentation and distribution . Technology shifts the focus and emphasis from solid news gathering and presentation . News_programs are going &quot; live &quot; almost at the drop of a hat on the most meaningless stories . What is the rationale for going live_over , say , some guy who might have been the victim of a carjacking at a gas_station in the Valley . You have a reporter at the scene , doing a stand-up , saying , &quot; Frank and Jane , right here just a_few hours ago , Bill Porter , 57 , of Van Nuys was a victim of &quot; -- what is the point of that ? We do_it because the technology is there and we have not learned how to make the technology coexist reasonably with the central focus of news presentation . We don ' t know how to make the technology supplement or complement the news rather than drive it . We ' ve gotten technology crazy . It ' s skycam . It ' s satellite technology . It ' s doing_it faster than anyone else . that ' s letting technology drive the wheels of news . It ' s leading us to have an emphasis on negative stories . I ' d like to suggest that people who want to do something about this do what I do . When I see something that bothers me , I pick_up the phone and call the newsroom . I usually ask to speak_to the news director and / or the executive producer . Readers and viewers should also write to the general_manager , to the news director , to the editor of publications like The Times and the Daily News about what they are seeing on local television_news that may concern them .</TEXT>
