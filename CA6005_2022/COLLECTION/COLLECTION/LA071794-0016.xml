   <TEXT> THE DAY ELVIS MET NIXON by Egil &quot; Bud &quot; Krogh ( Pejama Press : $ 18.95 ; 61 pp. ) You ' ve seen the postcard , the T-shirt , the kitchen magnet . Now comes the book , chronicling the fateful half-hour Oval Office summit between the King and the Prez in 1970 . According to author Egil &quot; Bud &quot; Krogh , a Watergate hand who served 4 months and 17 days in federal prison for his role in the Ellsberg break-in , Elvis Presley showed Richard Nixon photos of wife Priscilla and daughter Lisa Marie , police badges he had collected across the nation and the cuff links on his shirt . The President , for his part , handed_out tie clasps and possibly -- Krogh isn ' t sure -- golf_balls , cuff links and pins . Nixon also directed White_House photographer Ollie Atkins to memorialize the scene , and discussed the nation ' s drug problem with his guest . &quot; Just be sure you keep your credibility , &quot; the President advised the King shortly before the session broke_up . Krogh ' s brightly illustrated account is a rather thorough presentation . Indeed , the book takes just as long to pore through as the meeting itself took . By reprinting the 10 frames shot by Atkins , Krogh also demonstrates that pictures are often worth at least a_thousand words . Of particular note are the awkward look_on Nixon ' s face as Elvis showed him his gewgaws and the spare look of Nixon ' s Oval Office . His bookshelves , rather than containing books , were repositories for at least seven life-size models of birds . Krogh says in his introduction : &quot; I don ' t claim that all direct quotes represent exactly what was said in the meeting or at other times during the day.But I ' m comfortable that the words I ' ve quoted are pretty close. &quot; One other thing : The book contains a copy of an April 14 , 1994 , letter from Nixon himself , congratulating Krogh on its publication and adding that he was &quot; greatly impressed by Elvis ' sincerity. &quot; Four days later , Nixon suffered the stroke that led to his death .
