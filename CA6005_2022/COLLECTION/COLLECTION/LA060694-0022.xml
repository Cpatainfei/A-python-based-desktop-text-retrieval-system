   <HEADLINE> THE HISTORIC RESULT OF A MONUMENTAL BLUNDER ; D-DAY WAS MADE INEVITABLE WHEN HITLER DECLARED WAR ON THE UNITED STATES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There had been nothing like it before , and there would be nothing like it ever again . The armada that 50 years ago today filled the_English Channel from Britain ' s southern ports to the northern coast of France was made_up of 5 # 333 ships and boats , more , the historian Samuel Eliot Morison would write , &quot; than there were in all_the world when Elizabeth I was Queen of England. &quot; Within a 24-hour period starting at first_light on June 6 , 1944 , those vessels would land 175 # 000 men and 50 # 000 vehicles on the beaches of Normandy . By the end of that first day nearly 5 # 000 of the American , British and Canadian troops in the invasion force would be casualties , among them paratroopers who had gone_in hours before the first landing_craft reached the beaches . &quot; With our brave allies and brothers-in-arms on other fronts , you will bring_about the destruction of the German war machine , &quot; the supreme Allied commander , Gen . Dwight D . Eisenhower , told his troops that morning . &quot; You will bring_about . . . the elimination of Nazi tyranny . . . . &quot; It was a precise order . Eleven months later it would be fulfilled . D-day , 1944 , had been made inevitable 30 months earlier when Adolf Hitler made the monumental strategic blunder of declaring war on the United States . Once fully involved in the European war , the United States quickly agreed with its British and Soviet allies that defeating Germany would take precedence over the war against Japan . Once it was committed , the United States could mobilize the full potential of its industrial power for the global struggle . In 1939 , as Stephen E . Ambrose notes in his fine account , &quot; D-Day , &quot; Depression-struck U.S. factories were still producing at only half their capacity and unemployment still stood at 20 % . Four years later factory capacity had expanded many times over and U.S. assembly_lines were turning_out a mind-boggling 8 # 000 planes a month , along with thousands of trucks and tanks and millions of other weapons . But in the end victory would depend not just on materiel but on the steadfastness of Allied fighting men . The liberation of Europe could come only when the German army was driven_out of the countries it had begun occupying in 1939 and then was destroyed as an effective force on its home soil . It would come only when Germany was squeezed between Western armies driving across France and Belgium and the Red Army of the Soviet_Union thrusting from the east , where war was waged with particular ferocity . ( As Gerhard L . Weinberg writes in &quot; A World at Arms , &quot; more people were killed on the eastern front -- most of them civilians -- than on all_the rest of the world ' s fronts combined. ) And it was the success of Operation Overlord , the opening of the long-awaited second front in Normandy , that assured the eventual victory . That battle , in all its terror and confusion , is massively and vividly documented , from the level of supreme commander down to the infantry private . To read what the men who went ashore faced and suffered and triumphed over -- and thousands of hours of oral history provide graphic witness to what it was all about -- is at once stirring and horrifying . All wars are cruel and wasteful , all battles are brutal , all victories exact a fearsome price . The price exacted that day on French beaches code-named Utah , Omaha , Gold , Juno and Sword , and the price that would have to be paid in the months ahead , was high . But what was achieved in crushing Nazi despotism was beyond value . A few days after the Normandy landing the great_war correspondent Ernie Pyle began a column with these words : &quot; . . . I want to tell you what the opening of the second front entailed , so that you can know and appreciate and forever be humbly grateful to those both dead and alive who did_it for you. &quot; A half-century later , as the anniversary of that feat of arms is honored , gratitude and respect and humility in recalling the courage and sacrifice of that day continue to be compelled .</TEXT>
