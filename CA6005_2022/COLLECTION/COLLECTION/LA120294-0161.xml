   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; THE GATT VOTE : IMPACT ON BUSINESS ; HOLLYWOOD ' S NEW READING OF PACT SUPPORTS PASSAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There has been no rewrite of the GATT script in the year since European protectionists essentially barred entertainment from the agreement . Nonetheless , Hollywood ' s new reading of the treaty is that GATT , though highly defective in some areas , may_not be so bad after all . A year ago this month , trade negotiators hammered_out the GATT agreement in Geneva that left open the possibility that Europe -- mainly the_French -- could continue to impose barriers on U.S. entertainment exports . At the time , Hollywood cried foul and threatened an international dogfight . * But the industry has since gone beyond quietly accepting its fate , to_the_point of actually supporting passage of the far-reaching trade treaty this week as it finally worked its way through Congress for official ratification . As expected , GATT -- short for the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- passed the Senate late Thursday after approval by the House earlier in the week . It now awaits President Clinton ' s signature . &quot; Even though we were bitterly disappointed last year in the final agreement , to oppose this agreement doesn ' t make_sense . This agreement , defective as it is , is better than no agreement , &quot; said Fritz Attaway , general counsel for the Motion_Picture Assn . of America , the industry ' s chief lobbying arm . Hollywood ' s seeming change of heart stems from two things . First , GATT includes intellectual property protections that the entertainment_industry hopes will stem the growing tide of pirated videos , albums and entertainment software proliferating in such areas as China , Russia and Eastern Europe . Hollywood estimates its piracy losses at $ 2 billion a year . GATT provides_for measures to help battle piracy , with the threat of trade sanctions hanging over countries that fail to address the problem . Second , there is the feeling in the industry that lowering trade_barriers worldwide is good for business overall because it will stimulate the economies of developing nations , which in turn will eventually boost demand for Hollywood ' s products . &quot; When economies boom , people have more money and go_to the movies , &quot; one studio chief said . * Indeed , some executives say there has been a clear surge in the movie business in Mexico , which they attribute in part to the enactment of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . In a statement , MPAA President Jack Valenti , one of GATT ' s most vocal critics a year ago , noted the industry ' s &quot; tremendous disappointment in the European Union ' s unwillingness to commit to tearing_down its trade_barriers against America ' s creative community. &quot; But Valenti went_on to praise the agreement for including the intellectual property protections and the overall opening_up of trade avenues . &quot; Any pact that achieves both those goals is to be lauded , &quot; he said . that ' s not to say there aren ' t concerns . France and a handful of other European_countries are still aggressively limiting the amount of U.S. entertainment allowed into their countries , chiefly that which airs over its television_stations . Relations have been strained in other ways . United International Pictures , the foreign distribution arm of Universal Pictures , Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , has been threatened with being dismantled on antitrust grounds . The dispute is now on the back burner . But Hollywood is encouraged that the enthusiasm for quotas in Europe is inconsistent and that quotas have been enforced only sporadically . Germany and Britain , for example , are lax about enforcement . In one peace overture , Walt Disney Co. , through its Miramax unit , recently said it would promote the distribution of French films and invest up_to $ 30 million in European co-productions . What ' s more , entertainment executives believe that even the_French will eventually face internal pressure to lift barriers as services such_as video on demand develop . * Companies developing these services , the reasoning goes , won ' t sink money into the projects unless they are assured that a wide range of movies and programs will be available on their systems . &quot; It ' s not going_to be comfortable for the_French to sit behind their Maginot line of quotas , &quot; said Jonas Rosenfeld , president of the American Film Marketing Assn .</TEXT>
