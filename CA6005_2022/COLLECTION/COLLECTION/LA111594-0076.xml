   <HEADLINE> MALATHION SPRAYING RESUMES AS HIGH WINDS DIE_DOWN ; MEDFLY : AERIAL PESTICIDE ASSAULT CONTINUES AFTER LAST WEEK ' S POSTPONEMENT WHEN A STORM ROLLED THROUGH THE AREA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite blustery winds and the threat of another postponement , state helicopters sprayed malathion over a 16-square-mile quadrant of eastern Camarillo on Monday night in a continuing effort to eradicate Medflies in this county . Because state regulations prevent the application of the pesticide if winds exceed 10 m.p.h. , state officials had worried that they would have to abort their mission for the second time in two weeks . But by 9:30 p.m. , half an hour after the scheduled takeoff time , winds had dropped below 8 m.p.h. and three helicopters left Camarillo Airport for four hours of low-level spraying of a sticky mixture of corn_syrup and the malathion pesticide . &quot; We had some real concerns this morning about the winds , &quot; said Larry Hawkins , a spokesman for the state Cooperative Medfly Project . Last Wednesday , agriculture officials called_off a planned third application of the mixture when a fast-moving Gulf of Alaska storm rolled through the area . Officials rescheduled the spraying for Monday night when dry , clear skies were predicted . Before the flights , Hawkins had said that 8 to 9 m.p.h. winds would force the helicopters to alter spraying patterns to avoid an unwanted drift of the pesticide . &quot; The pilots will move_over a_couple_of flight lanes if needed so as_to prevent any unnecessary drift , &quot; he said . &quot; We will be constantly feeding them information on wind velocity and direction . If at any point the wind exceeds 10 m.p.h. , they ' ll return to the airport and go_on standby. &quot; As 15 to 20 m.p.h. winds whipped the county Monday , officials said they feared a second delay in spraying , because that could damage the effectiveness of malathion . The pesticide was first sprayed Oct . 12 , then again two weeks later . &quot; We are at a critical_point in the schedule , &quot; said W . Earl McPhail , the county ' s agriculture commissioner . &quot; As the flies emerge from their pupal stage , we want to make_sure there ' s bait out there to attract them . We don ' t want to take any chances. &quot; An 86-square-mile quarantine zone was established after Medflies were discovered Sept . 29 near St . John ' s Seminary . So far , 63 of the pests have been discovered , but there has not been a new find since Oct . 6 . Officials plan to continue applying the pesticide until early next year -- or until three life_cycles of the crop-destroying pest have been completed . Members of GASP ( Group Against Spraying People ) met the pesticide-laden helicopter squadron at the airport Monday night , again protesting the operation by carrying placards in opposition . &quot; We are just praying that the winds stay high , &quot; spokesman Leonard Mehlmauer said .</TEXT>
