   <HEADLINE> GRAF ACCEPTS PIERCE ' S CHALLENGE AS FEAR TAKES A BACK SEAT TODAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steffi Graf , 24 , has won 15 Grand_Slam tournaments , finished second seven times , is 42-1 this year and is seeking her fifth consecutive major title . Mary Pierce , 19 , has never reached the semifinals of a Grand_Slam event , is 19-8 this year and has not won a set against Graf in two meetings . So it was a bit strange that Graf was asked if she feared Pierce today in the semifinals of the_French Open . &quot; I ' m not scared about anything , &quot; the top-ranked Graf replied . Pierce , who has rolled into the semifinals on a blistering pace , losing a record-setting six games in five matches , offered a similar sentiment , saying : &quot; I ' m not afraid of nobody. &quot; But Pierce has not faced the_likes_of Graf during her Roland Garros run the last 10 days , and realizes her next assignment on Center Court will not be easy . &quot; I think for every single point of every game of every set you need to be mentally tough and in very good_shape because she doesn ' t make mistakes , &quot; Pierce said . &quot; She plays very aggressive , and you just have to keep the ball deep and move really well to be_well positioned when Steffi attacks. &quot; Graf is aware of the pressure of facing Pierce , who is playing for France , although she was born in Montreal and lives in Florida . &quot; She has all_the shots to come_up_to the top , &quot; Graf said . Even against her ? &quot; Well , that we will see. &quot; Today ' s other semifinal will match Spain ' s No . 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and No . 3 Conchita Martinez , who are a contrast in development if not styles . Although both grew_up in Catalonia , as did Sergi Bruguera , a men ' s semifinalist here , Sanchez Vicario and Martinez took different paths to the top echelon of women ' s tennis . Sanchez Vicario , 22 , was brought along by the Spanish Tennis Federation , whereas Martinez , 22 , had to go_to Switzerland to get the support she needed to develop her game . Sanchez Vicario has had considerably more success . She won the 1989 French Open and reached Grand_Slam event finals three other times . Martinez will be playing in her second semifinal after advancing that far at Wimbledon last year . &quot; It ' s going_to be a hard match because we know ( Arantxa ) is a fighter , &quot; Martinez said . &quot; If I can be patient . . . I think I have a chance. &quot;</TEXT>
