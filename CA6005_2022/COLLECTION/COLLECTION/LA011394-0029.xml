   <HEADLINE> PUTTING CLOTHES ON THE EMPEROR ; IS NATO FINALLY SERIOUS ABOUT SARAJEVO ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Put_up or shut_up . Monday , as a communique was being drafted that would commit NATO to attack Serb artillery emplacements from the air if the strangulation of Sarajevo continued , President Clinton spoke sternly : &quot; If we are going_to reassert this warning ( issued for the first time last August ) , it cannot be seen as mere rhetoric . Those who attack Sarajevo must understand we are serious . In voting for this language , I expect ( NATO ) to take action when necessary. &quot; Tuesday , the communique was ratified : NATO reaffirmed its readiness under the authority of the Security_Council of the United Nations &quot; to carry_out air strikes in_order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo , the safe areas and other threatened areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. &quot; The Serbs attacking Sarajevo responded to this new threat by immediately meeting the one non-procedural condition NATO had stipulated . They launched a mortar attack that shut_down the Sarajevo airport , halting the airlift on which Sarajevo depends for food . This followed a week of intensified shelling of the airport and of densely populated central Sarajevo . Accordingly , Clinton must now -- immediately -- call_for an emergency NATO summit and at it he must demand that the threatened air strikes be executed . NATO has made the air strikes conditional on a unanimous vote of its 16 member states , thus giving Greece , a NATO member but a Serbian ally , a veto . NATO has also made the strikes conditional on approval by the Security_Council , thus giving U.N. General Secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali , a past opponent of military assistance to the Bosnians , a veto . These escape clauses may exist because some NATO members , rather than take the necessary action , want only not to seem to be avoiding it . But not Clinton . He has already attacked that very escapism : &quot; Failure to act_on promises of action , &quot; he said Monday , &quot; will have great ramifications in the future in other contexts. &quot; In effect , Clinton has given his word that he will not allow the NATO promise to become a damagingly empty one . Let him now be a man of his word and move NATO from talk to action . Greece may stop him . Boutros-Ghali , perhaps with the tacit backing of some of the NATO states , may stop him . But let Clinton not pusillanimously check beforehand to see whether his flag will be saluted before he raises it . He tried that once before , sending Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher on a European diplomatic_mission that left NATO bewildered and Christopher humiliated . The time has come for the President to call several bluffs at once . If he does so , either Sarajevo will be en route to rescue or NATO will be exposed as a paper tiger . Either way , the sooner the better .</TEXT>
