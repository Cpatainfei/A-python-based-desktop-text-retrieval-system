   <TEXT> Everyone loves a winner , right ? If you believe that , it only goes_to show you ' ve never spent any time in Britain . At no time_of_year is it clearer that the_British despise their winners than the weeks leading_up to Oscar night . Around this time , Americans who take an interest in such things are animatedly speculating whether Tom Hanks , Tommy Lee Jones , Winona Ryder or whomever they like will receive a statuette come Oscar night . Should their favored nominees win ( and make the right kind of modest noises in their acceptance speeches ) , then Americans , good-hearted , generous-spirited people that they are , will be genuinely pleased for them . We British approach all this rather differently . We are a nation suffering from the &quot; tall poppy &quot; syndrome -- which means we take cruel delight in cutting_down those individuals who distinguish themselves above others . We just about tolerate people who restrict their success to Britain . For those who have the temerity to achieve fame and respect abroad we reserve our deepest loathing . Especially if they do so in America . More especially still if they do so in Hollywood . This is why , since Oscar nominations were announced , the_British media have been sharpening their knives . Prime targets this year are Daniel Day-Lewis and Emma Thompson . Day-Lewis has already stuck his head above the parapet , having won a surprise Oscar for 1989 ' s &quot; My Left Foot. &quot; This time the media are ready for him ; since this year ' s nomination he has been the subject of newspaper profiles that , in the absence of any sexual scandal or substance_abuse problems surrounding him , simply seek to portray him as an obsessive teetering on the very edge of sanity . His breakdown during a 1989 stage performance of &quot; Hamlet &quot; was exhumed and analyzed for clues to his alleged instability . His preparations for his Oscar-nominated role in &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; were lovingly detailed -- how he had himself locked into a prison_cell on the film set for three days , how he hired men to kick at his cell door , shout abuse at him and douse him with buckets of water to interrupt his sleep . This , said one headline , was &quot; madly obsessive &quot; behavior . An anonymous source said : &quot; A lot of actors pretend to be crazy . But with Daniel you can never be sure it ' s just an act. &quot; Given the parlous state of their film_industry , one might think the_British would be wildly cheering an actor like Day-Lewis , whose success at the very least brings enormous credit to their acting tradition . Instead , the Brits , with a wink and a smirk , prefer to insinuate he ' s gaga . Thompson comes_off even worse . She is someone who , in academy terms , has achieved something even more extraordinary : The year after winning an Oscar for &quot; Howards End , &quot; she is now nominated for two further performances -- in &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; and &quot; In the Name of the Father. &quot; Yet she and her husband , Kenneth Branagh , are chronic irritants to the_British media because they have achieved success at an early age , and because they show every sign of relishing it . Branagh committed the unforgivably immodest sin ( in British eyes ) of writing an autobiography before his 30th birthday ; when it became clear that Hollywood regarded him as a major talent , his fate in his homeland was sealed . ( If Branagh ever wins an Oscar , a good half-dozen journalists in Britain may contemplate suicide. ) Thompson now recalls that the_British press initially approved of her , but implied after she married Branagh that she only got work_through him . &quot; I thought , ' Boy , is that ever mean-spirited , ' &quot; she said . &quot; And sexist. &quot; Now Thompson does not talk to Britain ' s tabloids . But it was a broadsheet film critic , the Sunday Times ' Julie Burchill , who recently launched the most damning attack on her . Reviewing &quot; In the Name of the Father , &quot; Burchill wrote_of Thompson : &quot; Fast becoming the most mannered , irritating actress since Meryl Streep , her performance is a national scandal . She seems like an amateur actress auditioning way_out of her depth . Even seen from behind , not speaking , completely covered , with a raincoat over her head , running , she has the power to irritate and dismay in a way that very few actors do. &quot; This was a review ( in a supposedly respectable paper ) of work that won Thompson a best supporting actress nomination . The problem with Day-Lewis and Thompson , I suspect , is that neither has yet experienced failure or hardship ; their rise to their current preeminence appears effortless . The British need them to suffer a personal crisis , financial problems or a career downturn before being recast as lovable . Both actors might find this too high a price to pay ; yet it is precisely why Anthony Hopkins is respected , even revered , by the same people who long to see Thompson and Day-Lewis stumble . Hopkins had the sense to launch a preemptive strike against fate long before his current run of acclaim ; he already had under his belt a broken marriage , a long bout with alcoholism and a movie career one might charitably describe as undistinguished . Now he affects modest bemusement at his success -- a very British trick . No wonder they love him . In fact , Britain has a long tradition of denigrating its actors and directors who flourish in Hollywood . ( If they also decide to live_in America , the base for most film work , the press accuses them of &quot; turning their backs on Britain. &quot; ) Fifty years ago , some of Laurence Olivier ' s acting colleagues thought it irredeemably vulgar of him to pursue a Hollywood career in tandem with his &quot; serious &quot; British stage work . More recently Michael Caine and Dudley Moore were castigated for going Hollywood . In the mid- ' 80s , Caine was acclaimed in America as an accomplished actor who enhanced every film in which he appeared ; the_British media portrayed him as a marginally talented Cockney riding a lucky break . For a_couple_of years Moore , in &quot; 10 &quot; and &quot; Arthur , &quot; was one of Hollywood ' s leading up-and-coming actors ; the_British wondered why the Oxford graduate was wasting his talent and , worse , living_in L.A. , frying his brain_cells . Here were the two actors making money and enjoying themselves . The Brits hated that . Oscar winner Jeremy Irons ( 1990 ' s &quot; Reversal of Fortune &quot; ) gets flak in the_British press for being aloof and superior . After meeting him , profile writer Lynn Barber wrote : &quot; I just wanted to boil him in oil. &quot; Who ' s next in_line for this treatment ? Step_forward Ralph Fiennes , best supporting actor nominee this year for &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; He seems a good bet for no other reason than the fact he has come a long way quickly ; once the Fleet_Street rat pack get_wind of how much Fiennes can command for a film , the knives will surely be out for him too . Despite our penchant for devouring our actors , we paradoxically love it when , like this year , they are_well represented in the Oscar nominations . We note proudly that in the last five years , nine of 25 best actor nominees have been British . We strut around and tell ourselves , yes , we may have a tiny , underfinanced film_industry , but by God , we can storm Hollywood and teach those wealthy , big-mouthed glamorous Yanks a thing or two about movies . In fact we ' re so keen to see a hefty British contingent_on Oscar night that we temporarily co-opt Irish actors and directors to add_to the total . Given the way the_British have treated the_Irish over the centuries , they might reasonably take a dim view of this , but the_British media ignore such considerations : Day-Lewis thinks_of himself as Irish , but he was born in London , so he ' s British , right ? Liam Neeson ' s from Northern_Ireland , so that makes him British . Jim Sheridan ? Irish through and through , but -- well , let ' s not complicate things , OK ? Brenda Fricker , who won an Oscar for best supporting actress in Sheridan ' s &quot; My Left Foot , &quot; once summed_up this tendency of the_British press memorably : &quot; Win an Oscar and you ' re a British actress . When they find you face down and drunk in a gutter , you ' re Irish. &quot; It ' s a strange phenomenon , then , this British craving for Oscar success combined with hostility to the individuals who achieve it . Presumably if it could somehow become a team sport we would be happier . But even that would not change the schizophrenic attitude the_British hold toward Hollywood -- an uncomfortable blend of wide-eyed fascination and snobbish class-ridden disdain . We secretly want our actors to bring_home armloads of Academy Awards , but we also want to sneer at them for trying in the first place . For the_British , the best of all wins on Monday would be supporting actor nominee Pete Postlethwaite of &quot; In the Name of the Father. &quot; He has it all ; he ' s the perfect &quot; little guy , &quot; the quintessential underdog , a plain man with an unglamorous name and a career unsullied by fame or riches . But if Postlethwaite does win an Oscar to take_home to Britain , he should know his problems are just beginning .</TEXT>
