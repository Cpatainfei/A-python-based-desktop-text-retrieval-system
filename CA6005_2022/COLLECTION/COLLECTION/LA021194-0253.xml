   <HEADLINE> MCA BUYS ' SIGNIFICANT ' STAKE IN O.C. ' S INTERPLAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> MCA Inc. , the Japanese-owned movie and entertainment giant , said Thursday that it has purchased a &quot; significant minority stake &quot; in Interplay Productions Inc. , one of Orange County ' s largest video_game publishers . * Brian Fargo , president of Interplay , said the company was courted by all_of the major Hollywood studios but decided on MCA , parent company of Universal Studios , because of its extensive entertainment holdings -- from books and movies to records and theme parks . &quot; I ' ve been in a unique position as one of the last independent , privately held publishers of a large size , &quot; Fargo said . &quot; My attitude was that it wasn ' t about the money or hype , but the strategic partnership that counted. &quot; Fargo said his company would use the money for internal expansion and acquisitions of other game companies . Neither company would say how much money MCA invested . Lee Isgur , an analyst at Volpe , Welty &amp; Co . in San Francisco , estimated Interplay ' s current market_value at about $ 100 million and said MCA ' s investment may be $ 30 million to $ 40 million . This deal combines Interplay ' s talent for producing interactive games and software with MCA ' s library of movies , records and books -- titles that can be converted into interactive entertainment . For example , Interplay has published computer_games based on Paramount ' s original &quot; Star Trek &quot; television series . MCA ' s Universal Studios , which produced the hit &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; will likely work closely with Interplay on movie-related projects , said Skip Paul , executive_vice_president of MCA . Other opportunities include producing interactive computer_programs that use video and sound of musicians from MCA ' s Geffen Records unit . Interplay recently produced &quot; Xplora 1 &quot; for rock_star Peter Gabriel . The MCA-Interplay partnership is the latest in a series of alliances between Hollywood studios and video_game publishers to create multimedia titles , or those that combine the interactive elements of video_games with the visual and sound content of movies on compact_discs known as CD-ROMs . In the past year , Irvine-based video_game publisher Virgin Interactive Entertainment raised $ 55 million from selling minority stakes to Blockbuster Entertainment Video and Hasbro Inc. And just this week , Virgin announced plans to issue stock to the public , which could raise an estimated $ 23 million . &quot; We have spent the last few years carefully studying the interactive software industry , &quot; Sid Sheinberg , president of MCA , said in a statement . &quot; We have looked_at a number of opportunities in this area , but early on identified Brian Fargo ' s Interplay as the ideal next step for MCA. &quot; Paul said MCA chose to invest in Interplay because of Fargo ' s business style . He said Interplay , which may open an office on the Universal Studios lot , would be completely autonomous . &quot; He is an executive who manages the creative people and product with his own hands , &quot; Paul said . &quot; Sort of like a film studio run_by a filmmaker . Everybody has been talking_about Silicon_Valley and Hollywood . that ' s looking down the wrong freeway . They should have looked_at Hollywood and Orange County. &quot; * Fargo , 31 , founded Interplay 10 years ago as an independent publisher of computer and video_games . Fargo was a whiz kid programmer from Corona del Mar who left college to pursue game design . Mainly on the strength of its in-house game development , Interplay has grown to $ 60 million in annual sales and 140 employees with offices in London and Chicago . As video_games become more sophisticated , Interplay has hired a wide array of talent , including programmers , actors , musicians and special_effects people . Consequently , Interplay ' s Irvine headquarters resembles a movie studio more_than a computer software firm . New media such_as the CD-ROM , or compact_disc , read-only_memory , allow computer_games to store more_than 600 times the data kept_on a floppy computer disk . Such capacity allows Interplay to put more film footage , stereo sound , computer animation and text into its games . And that means the company must license more titles from Hollywood studios that own the rights . &quot; We ' ve made_it on our own for 10 years , and we ' re trained well to survive because there are 100 failures for every success , &quot; he said . * The company ' s top-selling titles include &quot; Battle Chess , &quot; &quot; Mario Teaches Typing &quot; of Super Mario Bros . fame ; and &quot; Star Trek : 25th Anniversary Enhanced CD-ROM. &quot; Last Christmas , Interplay ' s &quot; Clay Fighter , &quot; a parody of violent arcade games , was one of the top-selling titles for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . Under the arrangement , MCA is Interplay ' s sole outside investor . MCA was also granted additional options to increase its minority position . Fargo said the company expects to create joint projects with MCA , but declined to provide details . He said he intends to retain control of the company and operate as an entrepreneur under MCA ' s wing .
