   <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY ; U.S. OPEN OFFERS A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was Day 9 of an ultra-marathon known more commonly as the U.S. Open . After a while , the mind shuts_out everything except backhand cross-court passing_shots and how to spell Kafelnikov . Has the Clinton health-care package passed ? Is there new movement on the crime bill ? Are the Cubans still rafting in armadas toward Miami ? When Pete Sampras lost , did the Fed raise or lower the interest_rates ? The U.S. Open is one of four Grand_Slam tennis tournaments . It is a big deal because it is in the United States , where we have lots of money and assume that events we put_on are important because we are putting them on . Each of the Grand_Slam events is noteworthy for something . The Australian Open is Down Under in the summer , an exotic , faraway place where it is steamy hot in January . The French Open is Paris . Enough said . Wimbledon is everything a tennis tournament ought to be : grass , tradition , London . No night tennis . No catering to TV . Wimbledon is above all that . And then there is the U.S. Open , a 500-pound gorilla . It does what it wants to , when it wants to , and the players and fans and the rest of the world be damned . The American way , certainly . It is a tournament that reflects perfectly the city in which it is played . If you need a break from pushing and shoving and being rude on the streets of Manhattan , the U.S. Open provides an opportunity to come_out to Queens and do those things . One player , when asked his enduring memory of playing here , responded , &quot; The garbage smell. &quot; Frequently , one ponders the ironic significance of this area being named Flushing Meadow . Nevertheless , as you wander around the premises , bruised from the jostling , your hand frequently straying to your wallet , just to make_sure it is still there , your fogged mind ponders some of the sights and sounds of those first nine days . There is Richard Krajicek , a 6-foot-5 player from the_Netherlands , who has won the L.A. Open twice and is one of the few players you figure might be able to make Sampras sweat . Krajicek gets_ahead , 6-0 , in a tiebreaker for the match in an early round , and John McEnroe , doing TV commentating from a nearby booth , says if Krajicek loses the tiebreaker from 6-0 , he will stand on his head and broadcast the next day . Krajicek does , and so does McEnroe . Even when he isn ' t playing , McEnroe adds more creativity and fun to this place than anybody else . Sampras loses a first set to some guy named Roger Smith , from that tennis hotbed , the Bahamas . It is the first set Sampras has lost in his last 10 Grand_Slam matches , and afterward , he talks_about little bumps on the stadium court that make_it somewhat flawed . You want to stand_up and scream at Pete that this is the U.S. Open , and it is New York . Flaws are the attraction here . Stefan Edberg gets upset in a night match , and he talks_about disliking the cold , windy conditions . You ponder this a bit . A guy from Sweden complaining about the cold . Ann Grossman upsets Mary Joe Fernandez , then spends 20 minutes in the interview room talking_about her deceased father , who she says was verbally abusive and overbearing in his attempts to make her into a star player . She talks_about playing_on the concrete tennis_court he built for her inside a barn , where she remembers hitting the ball between the cows and the pigs , and she talks_about working there , five hours a day , every day , for many years . It is fascinating , but you feel as if the interview should have been conducted on a couch and you should be charging $ 120 an hour . It was a special moment . For Grossman , the flood of emotion about her father was understandable , even refreshing . For her , a victory like that at the U.S. Open was huge , was what she had worked for all those hours in the barn . Quite possibly , she had never before been at the interview podium at the U.S. Open . The next day , the New York Times , in its report on the match , lists Fernandez as the winner . * Until Andre Agassi took it back with his thrilling , hard-earned victory Monday over Michael Chang , this tournament belonged_to the Jensen brothers , Murphy and Luke . Criticized loudly by tennis purists for their showmanship , the Jensens nevertheless seemed to be the only act playing this tennis Broadway that was drawing well . On the court , they can play a little bit , although the gimmicks seem to be increasingly getting_in the way of results . But off the court , they are Letterman and Leno . Murphy , asked how he reacts to criticism from other players : &quot; No big deal . Heck , Sampras accused me of cheating in the boys ' 12s. &quot; Luke : &quot; You did. &quot; The Jensens have twin sisters , Rebecca and Rachel , playing_on the tour . It doesn ' t take a genius to figure_out that , one of these days , we will turn_on our TV_sets and have a mixed doubles match featuring Jensen-Jensen vs . Jensen-Jensen . Maybe McEnroe will do the commentating standing on his head . * One of the better things that went_on in the first week , at least from a tennis standpoint , was the play of Ginger Helgeson . She played_at Pepperdine , now lives_in the mountains not far from San Diego and is close to breaking_into the top echelon of women ' s singles . When she beat Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez here , she went_to the net 79 times in three sets . Excluding Gigi Fernandez , who later beat Helgeson , all_the rest of the women in the draw may_not make that many net approaches in the entire two weeks . Women ' s tennis , all too often a drone of never-ending ground_strokes , needs Helgeson . * First thing Tuesday morning , way_out on Court 20 , a junior boys ' match was played between American Mark Loughrin and a player from India named Anirban Baruah . Loughrin , one of the best juniors in the country , won easily . But when he missed on a match_point in the last game , he cursed himself under his breath . A linesman quickly reported that to the chair umpire , who gave the 17-year-old Loughrin a warning . When the match ended , Loughrin went_to a phone and called his parents , Gene and Sherry , back in Greendale , Wis . The first thing he told each of them , in separate calls to their workplaces , was that he won . The second thing he told each of them was that he had received a warning from the chair . Each said he deserved the warning . It was a nice moment . Even at 17 , winning wasn ' t everything . Behaving mattered a lot , too . Now if the rest of this place could just learn that . . . .</TEXT>
