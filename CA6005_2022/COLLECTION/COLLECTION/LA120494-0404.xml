   <HEADLINE> TOUGH ROW TO HOE ; PROMISING FIELD LEAVES PARTNERS WITH BUMPER CROP OF TROUBLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When his truck jounces along the rough road past Conejo Ranch , farmer Jim Roberts sees a tidy green field of baby vegetables -- the same kind of wispy , hopeful bloom that cloaked the field one year ago . But although the Ventura County field looks just as it did last fall , Roberts views it differently . Where he once saw rich dirt and ripe potential , he now sees pain , frustration and anger . It ' s been that kind of year . Since they planted the first seeds during Thanksgiving week of 1993 , Roberts and partners Craig Underwood and Minos Athanassiadis have had to deal with an astounding pileup of troubles on their 60-acre field just outside Camarillo . They have skirmished with neighbors irate about a giant , stinking compost heap on a corner of their property . They have battled biologists who declared one-third of their field a federally protected wetland . They have watched part of a fantastic corn crop wither in the field when they could not unload the ears at decent prices . And they have struggled to find markets in a ruthless industry dominated by a_few agribusiness giants . All this is_on top of the standard farming foes of fickle weather , faltering markets and ferocious pests . Last fall , they cooed and clucked over Conejo Ranch as though it were a newborn ; this year , they anguish and fret over the field as though it were a juvenile_delinquent . A thieving delinquent at that : The field lost $ 50 # 000 in its first year . The crush of woes , Roberts mused , &quot; changes the way you look_at the land. &quot; In the year ' s worst blow , the Environmental Protection Agency recently determined that the farmers destroyed 23 acres of valuable wetland when they clear-cut , drained and leveled Conejo Ranch to prepare it for planting . To atone , the partners must either restore the field to its natural_state or enhance a torn-up wetland elsewhere in the county . They will probably negotiate a deal with the EPA over the next several months . The tab could swing from less than $ 100 # 000 to more_than $ 2 million , depending_on the project , according to wetland consultants . Yet all three partners fiercely believe they will survive . They figure they will do just fine if they keep doing what they have been doing . And that includes farming Conejo Ranch , carrying it along from season to season , struggling through the bad times and waiting for the good . As Roberts explained , &quot; that ' s farming. &quot; Though Conejo Ranch is the only property they own , the partners rent 22 other fields in Ventura County , so they have backup sources of cash . They now grow 100 different vegetables , from purple radishes to yellow potatoes to black-eyed beans , so they can keep revenue flowing even if a_few crops fail . They also have stoic , steady personalities on their side , helping them endure . &quot; These guys all have such stellar characters , &quot; said Rex Laird , executive_director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau . Praising the partners ' buoyancy through turbulence , he added : &quot; Can you imagine if this happened to someone who was just mediocre ? &quot; What happens , of course , is that many farmers fail -- mediocre or not . Fewer Farms The most recent U.S. census disclosed that the number of farms in the United States has dropped below 2 million for the first time since the Civil War . Meanwhile , about 2 million acres of agricultural land vanish each year , the rich soil banished under the concrete crust of development . Ventura County alone lost about 900 acres a year between 1984 and 1990 , according to state statistics . Since the Underwood Ranches partners first tilled Conejo Ranch just one year ago , they have watched the wood-and-steel skeletons of two factory outlet malls and a mega-plex movie_theater sprout on the prime farmland of the Oxnard Plain . And developers have proposed building everything from affordable homes to an exotic-animal zoo in the agricultural greenbelts that stretch between local cities . &quot; The number of people who are making a living from farming is decreasing , &quot; said Eric Vink of the American Farmland Trust , a national conservation group . In launching Conejo Ranch , the partners were aware of the gamble . They were aware , and they were proud : proud_of saving a parcel from development , proud_of coaxing an abandoned lot back into food production . Their 60-acre field , tucked between scrub-spotted hills and a plant-lined creek , had lain vacant for a decade before the partners bought_it in the spring of 1993 . During that long fallow spell , the land had sprouted billowing willows and scrubby underbrush . The tangled vegetation had beckoned quail , coyote , even a family of mountain_lions . Viewing the weedy lot as an eyesore , the farmers eagerly ripped_out the helter-skelter growth and laid_down neat furrows , an elaborate drainage_system , shiny irrigation pipes . &quot; To us , &quot; Underwood said , &quot; it seemed like we were doing a really good thing. &quot; Federal_officials , however , took a different view . After a six-month probe that wrapped_up in late October , biologists from the Environmental Protection Agency determined that the farmers had destroyed a unique riparian ecosystem that linked the Santa Monica Mountains and Conejo Creek . &quot; It provided very , very diverse habitat -- food and shelter for all sorts of animals and birds , &quot; EPA biologist Aaron Setran said . Because the ranchers did not know they were tampering with a wetland when they sent_in their tractors , Setran said , the EPA will not press criminal charges . But the government could still extract a crushing toll by demanding that the farmers replace the &quot; values &quot; of the destroyed habitat . &quot; Agriculture is subjected_to lots of risks . . . but it ' s legislative and regulatory action that can put you out of business the fastest , &quot; said Laird , of the county Farm Bureau . &quot; All the natural disasters we face pale before what state and federal regulators can do. &quot; Long before they tally a final tab , the farmers already consider the EPA ' s verdict oppressive . Just as much as the expense , they resent the implication . &quot; I consider myself an environmentalist , &quot; Roberts said . &quot; that ' s why I do what I do -- to be outside , with nature . This just doesn ' t sit right. &quot; Even local Sierra Club leader Cassandra Auerbach , a stern environmentalist , praised the partners for &quot; trying to be responsible. &quot; While she mourns the destruction of 23 acres of wetland , Auerbach also pities the partners . &quot; It ' s very sad , &quot; she said . The farmers reject such pity . They bristle_at the concerned calls from friends and relatives . They squirm when neighbors troop into their produce stand and gather_up bushels of veggies , buying way more_than they could eat as a none-too-subtle form of charity . &quot; We don ' t want anyone feeling sorry_for us , &quot; Underwood said . &quot; I ' m certain we ' ll get_over this , &quot; Athanassiadis added . Profits , Losses Getting_over it means first bringing Conejo Ranch back into the black . The field ' s inaugural crop of mixed gourmet greens , harvested last winter , sold crisply and racked_up a $ 50 # 000 profit . The next crop , however , flopped . Conejo Ranch ' s summer corn peaked at the wrong time -- when the market was sagging . Customers slid out of their verbal commitments to buy the corn , and sales tumbled . The crop lost $ 100 # 000 . Just as the corn crisis hit , the EPA cranked_up its wetland investigation . Then , neighbors raised a stink about the huge compost heap rotting away on Conejo Ranch ' s southeastern corner . As one last torment , the Mediterranean_fruit_fly invaded Ventura County , landing in a Camarillo orchard just miles from Conejo Ranch . For a while , the farmers feared the Medfly infestation would trigger a boycott of Ventura County produce . Ultimately , the threat fizzled . But the waiting made_for a tense few weeks . Bunched around a Formica table in their office kitchen one recent afternoon , the three partners each sought to come_up with an adjective to describe this most chaotic year . Athanassiadis called it &quot; challenging. &quot; Tipping back his chair and grinning , Roberts offered_up &quot; tiring. &quot; Finally , Underwood selected &quot; enlightening &quot; -- only a slight trace of irony in his voice . &quot; We thought we were doing an exceptional thing on Conejo Ranch , &quot; Underwood explained . &quot; Nothing , it seemed , could have gone better . Then we had the EPA come_down on us , compounded by the compost heap , the Medfly thing . . . . &quot; Sometimes you ' re not rewarded for doing things right , &quot; he said . But according to the EPA , the farmers did not do things right . Before buying Conejo Ranch , they should have consulted with environmental experts , who might have warned them that the moist field , with its clusters of cattails and rushes , could fall_under federal jurisdiction . As Bart Doyle , a Los Angeles wetland attorney , explained : &quot; In California , you should always assume some part of your land is regulated , no matter what you want to do with it. &quot; The Conejo Ranch partners , however , did not assume they would need federal permission to start a farm . And the developers who sold them the parcel did not disclose any constraints on the 60-acre field , Underwood said . &quot; They really didn ' t know it was a wetland , &quot; EPA biologist Setran agreed . &quot; They ' re good_guys caught in a bad place . But we have to look_after the law. &quot; Setran launched his investigation into Conejo Ranch last winter , after reading about the farm ' s swampy origins in The Times . By studying soil samples and examining aerial photos of the field before and after the partners purchased it , Setran determined that the farming operation had destroyed 23 acres of wetland , a violation of the federal Clean Water Act . Ironically , the law would have allowed the farmers to do anything they wanted to on Conejo Ranch if they had first drained the water and let the field dry_up , according to several environmental attorneys . Federal law prohibits only the &quot; discharge &quot; of material into a wetland . That covers any redistribution of soil in a wetland -- from digging a ditch to churning_up earth with a bulldozer . But the law does not ban other activities that would clearly devastate a wetland : chopping_down plants by hand , burning vegetation , pumping out water . Even plowing is considered acceptable . As long as no soil is shifted , landowners can legally destroy a wetland -- and then , once the parcel is dry , build or farm with impunity , lawyers said . &quot; Frankly , to this day you can do all sorts of things in wetlands , &quot; San Francisco attorney David Ivester said . Challenge Considered The Conejo Ranch farmers could still challenge the EPA ' s decision . They are tempted . Yet the thought of going_up against a federal agency scares them . Underwood expects to spend up_to $ 10 # 000 on preliminary consulting studies just to lay out his options -- and he knows an appeal would cost much , much more . &quot; ( EPA officials ) make_it abundantly clear that they have unlimited resources , &quot; he said in frustration . &quot; They ' re saying , basically , ' We can outspend you until you give in. ' &quot; Despite his resources , EPA biologist Setran does hope to avoid a court brawl . So , in a low-key call from his San Francisco office this fall , he urged the partners to negotiate . Generally , the EPA requires offenders to restore two acres of wetland for every one destroyed . The agency also may tack_on another penalty for &quot; temporal loss &quot; -- the number of years the wetland habitat was displaced . And the government usually insists that violators monitor any just restored wetland for at least five years . But in this case , Setran said , the farmers could &quot; make a big dent in their mitigation requirement &quot; by simply planting willows and native shrubs along the border of Conejo Ranch . By creating a wetland corridor along the field ' s southern strip , the partners could open_up a path for animals seeking to cross into Conejo Creek . A cheap fix , the corridor would restore the destroyed habitat ' s most valuable feature without cutting_into Conejo Ranch ' s farming operation . &quot; We could do_it in a way that would barely affect any acreage at all , &quot; Setran promised . The hitch , however , is that the partners would be left with a federally protected wetland on their property for years to come . And for now , they have had more_than enough of the government . To boot the government off their ranch entirely , the partners would have to come_up with an off-site wetland repair project that would satisfy the EPA . They could pull the voracious , bamboolike arundo plants from local arroyos , for example , and replace them with native willows . They could pump water into a onetime pond drained by some previous scofflaw . Or , they could freshen_up the gentle lagoon at Ormond Beach , home to snowy plovers , brown pelicans and other rare_birds . An acceptable mitigation project &quot; could take as little as turning_on a tap &quot; and filling a dried-up pond , wetland consultant Glenn Lukos of Laguna Hills said . At the other extreme , a massive job , complete with grading and excavating , could cost $ 40 # 000 to $ 60 # 000 an acre , he said . The EPA ' s open-ended instructions leave the farmers free to scout the cheapest way to pay their dues . Whatever option they choose , they will never be able to compensate Southern California for the loss of the Conejo Ranch wetland , scientists said -- unless they tear_up their crops , plant native species and let the field go wild for decades . &quot; There was a mosaic to that wetland . . . and you ' ll never , ever replace that , &quot; Setran said . &quot; It was unique unto itself. &quot; Rich and fertile , the Conejo Ranch habitat was also relatively new when the farmers moved_in . Before the weeds took_root in the early 1980s , the field had been worked as farmland for more_than a century , trodden by cattle and tilled by man . In planting Conejo Ranch , the partners fancied they were reinvigorating the land by reviving its agricultural roots . That respect for farming tradition , however , clashed with the environmentalists ' respect for nature , which had reclaimed the land with flair in just a decade . &quot; The question is , &quot; environmental consultant LeeAnne Hagmaire said , &quot; whether food and fiber have more value than a recently created wetland. &quot; Hagmaire votes for baby carrots and Italian arugula above two-striped garter_snakes and southwestern pond turtles . So does Conejo Ranch ' s planting foreman , Natividad Zavala . &quot; By working here , we ' re producing food for this world , &quot; he said . As his crew of harvesters crouched under a stormy November sky to pick carrots , Zavala added : &quot; Look how many mouths you feed with this field . We have to do this to live . Of course , I don ' t want the animals to die . But I don ' t want myself to die , either. &quot; To environmentalists , however , such arguments are too facile . Wetlands , they note , do much more_than shelter animals . They also purify water , filtering man-made contaminants through thick underbrush . And they absorb heavy rainfall , thereby saving downstream homes from flooding . &quot; These kinds of wetlands are so important on so many different levels , &quot; said Carrie Phillips , a biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . &quot; When you ' re talking_about a region that ' s lost over 90 % of its wetlands , ecologically speaking , everything counts. &quot; While they don ' t believe their field counts as a protected wetland , the Underwood Ranches partners are eager to resolve their dispute with the EPA quickly . Although pacifying the EPA could cost a bundle , Underwood insists : &quot; We will not allow that piece of property to threaten the rest of our farming operation. &quot; To stay solvent , the partners must make regular_payments on their $ 420 # 000 bank loan , taken_out to purchase Conejo Ranch in the spring of 1993 . They cannot sell the land to raise cash , not with a wetland designation dooming future development . So that leaves farming . Right now , the field is nourishing its third crop of the year : baby carrots , with a sprinkling of red , gold and candy beets tossed_in as well . Most of the carrots will be sheared of their fluffy tops and stacked in plastic bags bearing Underwood Ranches ' &quot; Sweet Petite &quot; label . About one-third will be sold to markets and restaurants in loose bunches , specks of dirt serving as proof of freshness . To breed shapely , smooth-skinned carrots , the partners experiment with dozens of different seeds each year . Of the 70 varieties tested last season , only one is still up for consideration -- and before it wins approval , it must survive further trials . Not only must the carrot look good , but it must also whisk through the processing machine speedily , without snagging in the gears . &quot; This product_line is very demanding , &quot; Roberts said . &quot; Nothing is ever right 100 % -- we just try to keep improving what ' s there. &quot; Counting_on brisk holiday sales , the partners are hoping their carrot crop will swing Conejo Ranch back into the money , after the $ 100 # 000 loss from summer corn wiped_out the $ 50 # 000 profit from last winter ' s greens . Earlier in the season , Underwood was confident the crop would prove a winner : &quot; The carrots look excellent , &quot; he declared . But since then , the crop has run_into a_few snags . An early cold_snap slowed carrot growth and delayed the second round of harvesting . The feared , armor-clad pests known as nematodes invaded , burrowing into plant roots and deforming a patch of baby carrots . Roberts is also warily watching for the dangerous phythium fungus , which blotches the carrots with black spots . Still , Underwood feels comfortable forecasting a decent return for his company at year ' s end . The 22 rented fields bailed_out Conejo Ranch ' s loss on the corn crop . And the financial fallout from the EPA probe will wait until 1995 . &quot; It ' s been a reasonable year , &quot; Underwood said . &quot; But not a knock-down-the-doors-and-go-to-Las Vegas year , &quot; Roberts broke_in . For enduring 12 months of seemingly endless disasters , the three partners will each earn about $ 70 # 000 . Not a fortune , certainly . But at least they will not have to sacrifice their paychecks to keep the farm running this year . As Roberts concluded : &quot; There will be a Christmas. &quot; &quot; A Christmas , &quot; Underwood amended , &quot; but no bonus. &quot; CONEJO RANCH : THE YEAR IN REVIEW Asked to sum_up the year in three adjectives , the Conejo Ranch partners selected &quot; challenging , &quot; &quot; tiring &quot; and &quot; enlightening. &quot; They could have added frustrating , trying and tense as well . But despite some demoralizing setbacks , all three expressed confidence in Conejo Ranch and in their business . &quot; We ' re used to the ups and downs of farming , &quot; Craig Underwood said . Fall 1993 After clearing Conejo Ranch and preparing the rich soil , the partners plant gourmet greens -- Japanese mizuna , Chinese tatsoi and Italian arugula . They also toss_in some radishes , bok choy and turnips . Sprinkling up_to 2 million seeds in a single acre , they plant the field in strips . By seeding a new patch every week , they ensure a continual harvest throughout the winter . Winter 1993 The greens are harvested , washed and tossed into Underwood Ranches ' bagged gourmet salad . Meanwhile , the partners seek new produce buyers . Most of their vegetables are rushed each evening to the Los Angeles Produce Market . From there , the produce travels through several warehouses before reaching markets and restaurants worldwide . Spring 1994 Conejo Ranch receives its second crop of the year -- sweet , bi-colored corn . The farmers also create a huge compost heap using shredded paper and organic waste from packinghouses . Meanwhile , the Environmental Protection Agency launches an investigation into whether the partners destroyed a wetland while preparing_for planting . Winter 1994 The partners are not yet sure what they will plant this winter . Their decision will depend_on the weather , the market , and the success of harvests gleaned from the 22 rented fields they farm elsewhere in Ventura County . Before they plant seeds of any type , they must plow the ground thoroughly to bury all traces of the potent herbicide they used this fall to protect the carrot crop from weeds . Fall 1994 Corn sales pick_up , and the farmers sell_out all_of their late-season harvest . But , EPA biologists conclude that the partners destroyed 23 acres of wetlands at Conejo Ranch . The EPA orders the farmers to restore part of the field to its natural_state or to enhance an existing wetland elsewhere in the county . Meanwhile , the farmers plant a third crop : baby carrots . Summer 1994 The partners suffer a series of setbacks . Neighbors complain that the compost heap stinks and demand its removal . The EPA intensifies the investigation into possible wetlands destruction . And the corn crop loses money . Unable to find markets for their bountiful crop , the farmers must leave several acres of corn unpicked .
