   <HEADLINE> LATIN_AMERICA ; DID PERU ARMY ALTER CASE TO HIDE DRUG ROLE ? ; CRITICS SAY TRAFFICKER WAS TRIED IN SECRET ON TRUMPED-UP CHARGE TO CONCEAL HIS LINKS WITH CORRUPT MILITARY_OFFICERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera , known as Vaticano ( Vatican ) , was the patriarch of Peruvian cocaine trafficking . The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration helped Colombian authorities capture him in January and deport him to Peru . After a swift trial , Vaticano is serving a life sentence -- not for trafficking but for &quot; treason against the fatherland. &quot; Critics of the secret and summary military trial say charges against Vaticano -- that he collaborated with Maoist terrorists -- were trumped_up to cover_up his collaboration with corrupt military_officers . The controversy has reinforced discouraging doubts about whether the international flow of cocaine can be stopped at its source if Peru , the biggest source of raw cocaine paste , lets such corruption go unpunished . But U.S. officials say there are grounds for optimism . For years , Vaticano conducted business in the Huallaga Valley of eastern Peru , operating landing_strips for drug planes and putting_together big shipments of crude cocaine paste , which was flown to Colombia for refining . Headquarters of his &quot; firm &quot; in recent years was Campanilla , a town on the main_road skirting the eastern foothills of the Andes . His landing_strip there was a widened section of the road . An anti-guerrilla army battalion based in Punta Arenas , a five-minute march away , often posted detachments in Campanilla . Numerous sources have told of a business_relationship between Vaticano ' s firm and the officers at Punta Arenas . &quot; If this guy is sending_out tons after tons of dope right under the nose of an army contingent , obviously someone is getting paid_off , &quot; a U.S. law_enforcement official said . In March , 1992 , Vaticano moved to Cali , Colombia , home of the notorious Cali cartel , now the biggest cocaine-smuggling network . Meanwhile , Vaticano ' s firm continued to operate in the Huallaga Valley . DEA agents knew that Vaticano was in Cali , but they did not know where . In late December , an informant told them where , charging $ 50 # 000 for the information . Colombian authorities arrested Vaticano in January and deported him to Peru for trial in a civilian court on trafficking charges . But then the army charged him with treason against the fatherland under a 1992 anti-terrorist decree , accusing him of giving arms and military information to Maoist guerrillas of the Sendero Luminoso ( Shining Path ) . He was tried in a closed courtroom by an anonymous military judge , who convicted and sentenced him Feb . 19 . Vaticano , 40 , is now imprisoned in the same navy_base where Abimael Guzman , the head of the Sendero Luminoso , is serving a life sentence , also for treason against the fatherland . According to the anti-terrorist decree , Vaticano is to be held incommunicado for the first year of his term , which presumably would prevent anyone from hearing what he might have to say about military links with drug_traffickers . But since his capture , information has leaked_out that implicates army_officers in his trafficking business . Evaristo Castillo , a cashiered army major who conducted a surprise raid on Campanilla in 1992 , has said that an army platoon there was protecting drug_traffickers and refused to cooperate in the raid . Castillo said his commander , Gen . Eduardo Bellido , berated him for raiding Campanilla . &quot; I know a lady in Lima who is the contact between Bellido and practically all_of the drug-trafficking people , &quot; Castillo has told Peruvian human_rights workers . Raul Pena Cabrera , Vaticano ' s lawyer , said in an interview that military commanders apparently fear that Vaticano &quot; could compromise certain military officials in high positions. &quot; Pena said that , in legal testimony , Vaticano &quot; implicated a commander , majors , captains and lieutenants &quot; stationed at the Punta Arenas army_base at different times during two years . &quot; They charged $ 3 # 000 , $ 4 # 000 , $ 5 # 000 per flight &quot; of cocaine paste , Pena said . Gen . Nicolas Hermoza , the army commander , has denied that any military_officers collaborated with Vaticano . But Hermoza acknowledged that 32 members of the army have been expelled for involvement in drug trafficking . While Vaticano ' s case has battered the army with a punishing storm of publicity , there are indications that the military is getting_tougher on traffickers . In late February , an army and police task_force aided by DEA agents made Peru ' s biggest drug seizure ever , grabbing about three tons of cocaine paste in a raid on a secluded airstrip in the Manu national_park .</TEXT>
